5|$|The {{process is}} {{repeated}} multiple times; {{in each of}} the five worlds the group travel through, they find and awaken the corrupted crystals, Airy performs her ritual in the pillar of light, and they are thrown into a new parallel world. In each world, they find variations on the situations they encountered in their own world, and gradually learn several <b>truths</b> <b>about</b> themselves and their adversaries. Nearly all of the Eternian elite they face were taken in by Braev out of compassion as they were rejected by the Orthodoxy, Ringabel is actually a parallel version of Dark Knight Alternis Dim, a close friend of Edea, and Yulyana and DeRosso were key figures in cleansing the original incarnation of the Orthodoxy of corruption. During their travels, both Yulyana and DeRosso give subtle warnings to Tiz and Agnès about Airy's intentions; meanwhile, Ringabel's memories slowly return, and he recalls Airy turning into a monster and murdering the previous incarnations of the party. In truth, Airy is an agent of Ouroboros, an evil being using the crystals as a means of linking all worlds as an energy sources to reach and conquer the Celestial Realm.|$|E

25|$|Chessick also {{acknowledged}} {{the dangers of}} relativism implicit in ontological hermeneutics. He acknowledges that the art and theory of interpretation is not bound by today's methods of science that aim to prevent nihilism and relativism. However, Bernstein {{has pointed out that}} there never could be any hard and fast rules or methods for interpretation because it does not aim to be a science. Gadamer states that the methods of the natural sciences are too impoverished to reveal many <b>truths</b> <b>about</b> human nature and likewise advocated for a hermeneutic approach. Others have made similar arguments for ontological hermeneutics. Chessick writes that the limitations preventing the natural sciences from uncovering certain <b>truths</b> <b>about</b> human nature is precisely why Dilthey initially advocated for a distinction between the natural and human sciences, paving the way for hermeneutics to become a method of inquiry.|$|E
25|$|A major {{question}} {{considered in}} mathematical Platonism is: Precisely {{where and how}} do the mathematical entities exist, {{and how do we}} know about them? Is there a world, completely separate from our physical one, that is occupied by the mathematical entities? How can we gain access to this separate world and discover <b>truths</b> <b>about</b> the entities? One proposed answer is the Ultimate Ensemble, a theory that postulates that all structures that exist mathematically also exist physically in their own universe.|$|E
25|$|While Ethical Culturists {{generally}} {{share common}} beliefs {{about what constitutes}} ethical behavior and the good, individuals are encouraged {{to develop their own}} personal understanding of these ideas. This does not mean that Ethical Culturists condone moral relativism, which would relegate ethics to mere preferences or social conventions. Ethical principles are viewed as being related to deep <b>truths</b> <b>about</b> the way the world works, and hence not arbitrary. However, it is recognized that complexities render the understanding of ethical nuances subject to continued dialogue, exploration, and learning.|$|E

25|$|To use {{a sample}} {{as a guide}} to an entire population, it is {{important}} that it truly represents the overall population. Representative sampling assures that inferences and conclusions can safely extend from the sample to the population as a whole. A major problem lies in determining the extent that the sample chosen is actually representative. Statistics offers methods to estimate and correct for any bias within the sample and data collection procedures. There are also methods of experimental design for experiments that can lessen these issues at the outset of a study, strengthening its capability to discern <b>truths</b> <b>about</b> the population.|$|E
25|$|The ancient Greek {{philosophers}} took {{such questions}} very seriously. Indeed, {{many of their}} general philosophical discussions were carried on with extensive reference to geometry and arithmetic. Plato (424/423BC 348/347BC) insisted that mathematical objects, like other platonic Ideas (forms or essences), must be perfectly abstract and have a separate, non-material kind of existence, {{in a world of}} mathematical objects independent of humans. He believed that the <b>truths</b> <b>about</b> these objects also exist independently of the human mind, but is discovered by humans. In the Meno Plato's teacher Socrates asserts {{that it is possible to}} come to know this truth by a process akin to memory retrieval.|$|E
25|$|Hermeneutic {{therapists}} {{state that}} ontological hermeneutics is ideally situated {{to address these}} issues and limitations because, as these authors state, it is a comprehensive theory of human nature, and it is an open system that enables exploration of therapeutic intervention without deviating from the theory itself. What this means is that therapists integrate multiple therapies simultaneously because what one theory lacks insight into, another theory provides; even though the theories may be contradictory among themselves. Ontological hermeneutics therapists, on the other hand, state that it is comprehensive enough to provide adequate insight into human nature as a starting point, but also provides a framework through dialogue to uncover <b>truths</b> <b>about</b> clients in therapy, therefore evading any problems of contradiction. Since ontological hermeneutics theory is a single theory, it avoids the problems of therapists creating their own forms of therapy.|$|E

Now he goes {{through the motions of}} a hollow existence, unable to admit even to himself the depth of his misery. As his certainties unravel, the night does as well. A fraternity prank goes wrong and propels Bret from his comfort zone into a cross-campus adventure, where he discovers devastating <b>truths</b> <b>about</b> the house president he once idolized. Meanwhile, it becomes clear that the school and society are moving beyond the values that Bret has built his life around: while tech careers have become the hope for a dawning Information Age, his fraternity is a hated and secretly bankrupt enclave slated for demolition. With the help of a beautiful but troubled girl named Caitlin, Bret finds the strength to take a last-ditch stand in an attempt to redeem himself from years of mistakesbefore it becomes too late.|$|E
25|$|That Dasein is a {{relational}} being, being-in-the-world, lead Heidegger to theorize {{about the}} notion of authenticity. Heidegger believed that Dasein’s efforts to understand himself ought to lead to interpreted <b>truths</b> <b>about</b> himself and, in turn, Dasein being exactly who he is {{with others in the}} world. Heidegger postulated that authenticity would lead to better relationships and enrich human experience. However, authenticity is more than just honest interaction and being who one is. For Heidegger, authenticity is also a sense of richer and fuller participation with others. If human interactions produce rich and full outcomes, and are appropriate to the context and situation of the relationship, then they are authentic. Authenticity is not just a mere mindset, it is a relational phenomenon. Anything that Dasein offers in his relationships, verbal or non-verbal, inviting or antagonistist, is authentic only because it is arising out of a particular relationship. That means that the perspectives or opinions that he shares, and the behaviors he demonstrates, are done so because of a particular relationship with a particular person and in that particular place and time.|$|E

500|$|Whitehead also {{described}} religion more technically as [...] "an ultimate craving to infuse into the insistent particularity of emotion that non-temporal generality which primarily belongs to conceptual thought alone."

500|$|... is a Japanese manga series {{written and}} {{illustrated}} by Hajime Isayama. The series began in Kodansha's Bessatsu Shōnen Magazine on September 9, 2009, and has been collected into 23 tankōbon volumes as of August 2017. It is set in a world where humanity lives in cities surrounded by enormous walls; a defense against the Titans, gigantic humanoids that eat humans seemingly without reason. The story initially centers on Eren Yeager and his childhood friends Mikasa Ackerman and Armin Arlert, who join the military to fight the Titans after their hometown is invaded and Eren's mother is eaten. However, as the story progresses and the <b>truths</b> <b>about</b> the Titans are slowly revealed to the reader, the narrative shifts to encompass Historia Reiss, squad leader Levi, Eren's father Grisha, and other supporting characters.|$|E

500|$|Initial {{reactions}} to the novel were varied. The New Yorker declared Lee [...] "a skilled, unpretentious, and totally ingenuous writer", and The Atlantic Monthlys reviewer rated the book [...] "pleasant, undemanding reading", but found the narrative voice—"a six-year-old girl with the prose style of a well-educated adult"—to be implausible. Time magazine's 1960 review of the book states that it [...] "teaches the reader an astonishing number of useful <b>truths</b> <b>about</b> little girls and about Southern life" [...] and calls Scout Finch [...] "the most appealing child since Carson McCullers' Frankie got left behind at the wedding".

Instead Dario Delacio, a stunt double, who stands at 6-foot-8, performs the role of [...] "Doomsday" [...] when the creature appears throughout the season.|$|E
