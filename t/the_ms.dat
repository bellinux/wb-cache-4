5|$|Because of {{the state}} of the {{relationship}} between the two companies <b>the</b> <b>MS</b> was unhappy being wholly reliant on the Met for access to London and, unlike its railway to the north, south of Aylesbury there were several speed restrictions and long climbs, up to 1 in 90 in places. In 1898, <b>the</b> <b>MS</b> and the GWR jointly presented a bill to Parliament for a railway (the Great Western and Great Central Joint Railway) with short connecting branches from Grendon Underwood, north of Quainton Road, to Ashendon and from Northolt to Neasden. The Met protested, claiming that the bill was 'incompatible with the spirit and terms' of the agreements between it and <b>the</b> <b>MS</b> <b>The</b> <b>MS</b> was given authority to proceed, but the Met was given the right to compensation. A temporary agreement was made to allow four MS coal trains a day over the Met lines from 26 July 1898. <b>The</b> <b>MS</b> wished these trains to also use the GWR route from Aylesbury via Princes Risborough into London, whereas the Met considered this was not covered by the agreement. A train scheduled to use the GWR route was not allowed access to the Met lines at Quainton Road in the early hours of 30 July 1898 and returned north. A subsequent court hearing found in the Met's favour, as it was a temporary arrangement.|$|E

40|$|Pep <b>M</b> 5, <b>the</b> pepsin-derived N-terminal half of {{the group}} A streptococcal type 5 M protein {{exhibits}} immunologic crossreaction with type 6 M protein, localizing some of <b>the</b> <b>M</b> 6 -crossreactive epitope(s) within this segment of <b>the</b> <b>M</b> 5 protein. Based on the amino acid sequence of <b>the</b> Pep <b>M</b> 5 protein, two structurally distinct domains have been recognized within its coiled-coil structure. We have now found that peptides derived from both the structurally distinct domains of <b>the</b> Pep <b>M</b> 5 protein contain antigenic epitopes. Furthermore, only the peptides from the C-terminal domain of <b>the</b> Pep <b>M</b> 5 protein crossreacted with rabbit anti-M 6 sera, whereas those from the N-terminal domain did not. Consistent with this, sequence analyses of the arginyl peptides of <b>the</b> Pep <b>M</b> 6 protein, <b>the</b> pepsin-derived N-terminal half of <b>the</b> <b>M</b> 6 protein, revealed extensive homology {{of some of these}} peptides with regions within the C-terminal domain of <b>the</b> Pep <b>M</b> 5 molecule. While an arginyl peptide of <b>the</b> Pep <b>M</b> 6 protein exhibits 84 % homology with region 150 - 186 of <b>the</b> Pep <b>M</b> 5 protein, <b>the</b> C-terminal hexadecapeptide of <b>the</b> Pep <b>M</b> 6 protein is virtually identical with the corresponding region of <b>the</b> Pep <b>M</b> 5 protein.

In addition, one or more epitopes of <b>the</b> <b>M</b> 5 protein that are crossreactive with <b>the</b> <b>M</b> 6 protein may be placed close to the pepsin- susceptible site of <b>the</b> <b>M</b> 5 protein. Previous studies have suggested the N-terminal half of <b>the</b> <b>M</b> proteins to be the variable part of the molecule among <b>the</b> different <b>M</b> protein serotypes. <b>The</b> present results suggest that the N-terminal quarter of <b>the</b> <b>M</b> protein may represent the hypervariable domain of <b>the</b> <b>M</b> molecule...|$|R

5|$|A poor {{supply of}} fresh water and {{dwellings}} without adequate drainage led to a cholera outbreak in the town in 1832. The Ashton Poor Law Union was established in 1837 and covered most {{of what is now}} Tameside. A new workhouse was built in 1850 which provided housing for 500 people. It later became part of Tameside General Hospital. Construction on the Sheffield, Ashton-under-Lyne and Manchester Railway (SA) began in 1837 to provide passenger transport between Manchester and Sheffield. Although a nine-arch viaduct in Ashton collapsed in April 1845, the line was fully opened on 22 December 1845. The SA was amalgamated with the Sheffield and Lincolnshire Junction Railway, the Great Grimsby & Sheffield Railway, and the Grimsby Docks Company in 1847 to form the Manchester, Sheffield and Lincolnshire Railway (MS).

30|$|In <b>the</b> <b>M</b> 2 compartment, a {{white spot}} was present, {{the size of}} which {{was similar to that}} of <b>the</b> <b>M</b> 1 compartment. This white spot was located just on the yellow ring or {{on the edge of the}} inner black disk, without a {{significant}} distortion of <b>the</b> <b>M</b> 1 eyespot, in 6 individuals out of 17 (Fig.  2 a, e, f). In these cases, <b>the</b> <b>M</b> 1 eyespot was almost an exact circle. According to a conventional understanding, the central positioning of the white spot within this eyespot suggests that <b>the</b> <b>M</b> 1 white spot corresponds to the organizing center from which morphogenic signals for the eyespot body were released during development in this particular eyespot. On the other hand, 11 individuals showed a distortion of <b>the</b> <b>M</b> 1 eyespot; in these cases, <b>the</b> <b>M</b> 2 white spot was located completely inside the eyespot (Fig.  2 b–d). This likely occurs from a fusion of <b>the</b> smaller <b>M</b> 2 eyespot and <b>the</b> larger <b>M</b> 1 eyespot. Thus, <b>the</b> <b>M</b> 1 white spot appears to have corresponded to a highly active organizing center and <b>the</b> <b>M</b> 2 white spot to either an inactive or less active organizing center.|$|R

Upon departure from Fort Lauderdale, one of her propeller pods was damaged when it struck a channel wall, forcing the ship to sail at a reduced speed, which resulted in Commodore Warwick's decision to skip several calls on its voyage to Rio de Janeiro. Many of her passengers threatened to stage a sit-in protest because of the missed calls, before Cunard offered to refund the voyage costs. Queen Mary 2 continued to operate at a reduced service speed and several itinerary changes were necessary until repairs had been completed after the ship returned to Europe in June, where Queen Mary 2 {{paid a visit to}} dry dock and the damaged propeller pod was unseated. In November, Queen Mary 2 was drydocked once more at the Blohm + Voss yard in Hamburg (drydock Elbe 17) for the reinstallation of the repaired propeller pod.

Negotiations about the line between the GCR and the Met took several years and in 1906 it was agreed that two tracks from Canfield Place to Harrow would be leased to the GCR for £20,000 a year and the Metropolitan and Great Central Joint Railway was created, leasing the line from Harrow to Verney Junction and the Brill branch for £44,000 a year, the GCR guaranteeing to place at least £45,000 of traffic on the line. Aylesbury station, which had been jointly run by the GWR and the Met, was placed with a joint committee of the Great Western & Great Central and Metropolitan & Great Central Joint Committees, and generally known as Aylesbury Joint Station. The Met & GC Joint Committee took over the operation of the stations and line, but had no rolling stock. The Met provided the management and the GCR the accounts for the first five years before the companies switched functions, then alternating every five years until 1926. The Met maintained the line south of milepost 28.5 (south of Great Missenden), the GCR to the north.|$|E
40|$|By {{electron}} microscopy, the ultrastructure of <b>the</b> <b>M</b> {{line was}} investigated in fibers from frog nonglycerinated semitendinosus muscles at body length and at different degrees of shortening and stretch. <b>The</b> <b>M</b> line appeared as a line of high electron opacity {{in the middle of}} the A band.
