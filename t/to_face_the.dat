5|$|Harvey {{was unable}} to {{maintain}} his from the Australian season after crossing the Tasman <b>to</b> <b>face</b> <b>the</b> New Zealanders.

5|$|However, Australian bowlers such as O'Reilly and Grimmett troubled him by bowling at his leg stump, restricting his scoring as he {{had fewer}} {{effective}} leg-side shots. Occasionally, he displayed discomfort against the fastest bowlers. His team-mate Charlie Barnett {{said that he did}} not relish fast bowling, although he was capable of playing it well in the initial stages of his career. Other colleagues, such as Les Ames, Bob Wyatt and Reg Sinfield, believed that he did not like <b>to</b> <b>face</b> <b>the</b> new ball, and he was occasionally happy for the other batsmen <b>to</b> <b>face</b> <b>the</b> difficult bowling.|$|E

5|$|A {{few days}} later, {{in the wake}} of the scandal, Waugh was widely jeered by an Australian crowd when he walked out to bat on the first day of the Test. In what he {{described}} as the toughest day of his career, Waugh gave an unconvincing and hesitant performance. Waugh managed only seven runs in 36 minutes before being removed by Peter Such, caught and bowled. The cricket writer Peter Roebuck opined that it was the worst home crowd reception for an Australian player that he could remember. Warne was injured at the time and did not play, so he did not have <b>to</b> <b>face</b> <b>the</b> hostile crowd.|$|E
5|$|After Smith's {{teammate}} Jack Clark hit a late-inning {{home run}} {{of his own}} in Game 6 to defeat the Dodgers, the Cardinals moved on <b>to</b> <b>face</b> <b>the</b> Kansas City Royals in the 1985 World Series.

5|$|After regaining the championship, the Acolytes began another {{feud with}} Kane with various partners. On the August 8, 1999 edition of Sunday Night Heat, Kane {{teamed up with}} Road Dogg <b>to</b> <b>face</b> <b>the</b> Acolytes for the WWF Tag Team Championship, in a losing effort. The {{following}} night on Raw, Kane then teamed up with X-Pac <b>to</b> <b>face</b> <b>the</b> Acolytes in another Championship match, where X-Pac delivered a X-Factor to Faarooq into the pinfall, which meant that the Acolytes lost the title. The following week, they lost a rematch for the WWF Tag Team Championship. After losing their rematch, they won a number one contendership for the WWF Tag Team Championship at SummerSlam, where they won a Tag Team Turmoil match. They were unable to regain the WWF Tag Team Championship, as their match against The Big Show and The Undertaker went to a no-contest. After this, they began a feud with the Dudley Boyz, which ended at Unforgiven where they defeated the Dudley Boyz. After their feud with the Dudley Boyz, the Acolytes began a gimmick as card players and beer drinkers, where they hustled many WWF superstars/employees out of their money.|$|E

5|$|After the Morea {{military}} expedition, the Greeks {{only had}} <b>to</b> <b>face</b> <b>the</b> Turkish troops in Central Greece.

In April, Naupaktos was restored to the Greeks; in May, Augustinos Kapodistrias recaptured the symbolic town of Messolonghi. However, it took the military victory of Russia in the Russo-Turkish War of 1828–29 and the Treaty of Adrianople before the independence of Greece was recognised.|$|E

Hogan agreed and entered the ring. Fuji tried to throw salt in Hogan's eyes, but he missed and the salt hit Yokozuna.
