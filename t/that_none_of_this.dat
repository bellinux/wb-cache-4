25|$|Due to {{increasing}} visibility through his books, LaVey {{was the subject}} of numerous articles in the news media throughout the world, including popular magazines such as Look, McCall's, Newsweek, and Time, and men's magazines. He also appeared on talk shows such as The Joe Pyne Show, Donahue and The Tonight Show, and in a feature-length documentary called Satanis in 1970. He would be credited for the mainstreaming of Satanism and witchcraft in the U.S. during the 1960s, 1970s and after. LaVey claimed that he had been appointed consultant to the film Rosemary's Baby, which revolved around a group of fictional Satanists, and that he also had a cameo appearance in the film as the Devil, however critics have argued <b>that</b> <b>none</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> was true. In an article published in Rolling Stone magazine in 1991, the journalist Lawrence Wright revealed that through his own investigative work, he found that many of LaVey's claims about his life had been untrue. Two official biographies have been written on LaVey, including The Devil's Avenger by Burton H. Wolfe, published in 1974 and The Secret Life of a Satanist by Blanche Barton, published in 1990.|$|E
25|$|Protagoras {{states that}} he has two good pieces of {{evidence}} that people agree with him. First, people do not rebuke the ugly, dwarfish, and weak, but pity them, because they cannot help being as they are, yet they punish the unjust and generally feel as though someone is responsible for not knowing {{something that can be}} taught (323d). Second, they do instruct people who are unjust and irreligious, hoping to impart goodness in them. He says that parents begin with their children from earliest childhood, and teachers carry on the task. Protagoras notes <b>that</b> <b>none</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> is surprising, but what would be surprising is if this were not the case (326e). He closes by addressing Socrates' question why, if virtue is teachable, the sons of virtuous men often lack virtue. Protagoras lays out a thought experiment where a hypothetical city state is resting its survival as such to the skill of flute playing. Being {{the most important thing for}} that society, parents would be eager to teach the skill to their sons. Not everyone would be successful though, as we can imagine, as some would have a greater natural inclination than others and often the son of a good flute player would turn out bad and vice versa. Any of them however, even the bad ones, would be better than an average citizen in the real world which might have never been taught how to play. Same goes for virtue, it is considered so important that everyone is taught to a certain degree, to the point that it seems like a part of human nature while it is not (327b–d).|$|E

500|$|Book Eight, War of the Asuras, {{is set in}} the 20th century, {{during the}} [...] "Long War". The world has become divided into three large alliances, the Chinese Empire and its colonies, the {{fractured}} Muslim world (Dar al-Islam), and the democratic Indian and Hodenosaunee Leagues. At the outbreak of war the Muslim states put aside their differences and unite to flight the larger threat of China (whom they fear will soon achieve global hegemony). The Indian and Hodenosaunee Leagues stay neutral at first, but eventually ally with China, as they see the Muslims as their greater enemy, however the Muslims invade northern India {{all the way down to}} Burma to stop the Indians and Chinese from linking up. The war drags on for decades causing major changes in the societies involved, with rapid industrialisation, mass conscription and mass casualties (both sides are forced to use women in the fighting to make up for manpower losses). Being the first industrial war, new devastating weapons and methods are employed, such as trench warfare, poison gas and aerial bombing. The story follows Chinese officers, Kuo, Bai and Iwa as they desperately fight in the trenches of the Gansu Corridor, where the ground has been blasted down to bedrock by sixty years of bombardments (the latest massive artillery pieces lob shells into space on ballistic trajectories). The new Chinese government, the [...] "Fourth Assemblage of Military Talent" [...] (the Qing Dynasty having been overthrown by a military coup during the war) orders a new offensive against the Muslim lines in Gansu. Kuo, Bai and Iwa are told to use poison gas and then frontally assault the enemy trenches. They do this successfully, but are then beaten back by the second line of Muslim defences, losing tens of thousands of soldiers and gaining nothing. However they are then told that their attack was merely a diversion for the real offensive which is being conducted by the Japanese (who have recently been freed by China in exchange for alliance in the war) through Siberia. The Muslims are in retreat but the Japanese get bogged down at the Ural Mountains. In the meantime, Kuo is killed by a shell which penetrates their bunker, Bai and Iwa are then ordered to move with their company south through Tibet to support their Indian allies. At a pass in the Himalayas they witness the Muslim artillery blasting the top of Mount Everest down so that the tallest mountain in the world will be in Muslim lands. After extreme difficulties they manage to breach the Muslim defences at the pass and the Chinese army pours through to meet up with the Indians, turning the course of the war in their favour. However Bai is plagued by visions of his dead friend Kuo, who tells him <b>that</b> <b>none</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> is happening and that he is already dead, killed by the shell earlier. Bai does not know whether he is indeed living real life or is already in the afterlife.|$|E

2500|$|Wednesday 19 February 2014 late in {{the evening}} a leakage was found near a storage tank with {{radioactive}} water. The water contained 230.000.000 bq/l. The water did flow over the barrier around the tank, into the grounds around it. TEPCO estimated that some 100 metric tons were lost. [...] After the waterflow into the tank was cut off, the leakage stopped, According to TEPCO nothing was flown into the ocean nearby. Further investigations were done after the cause of the leakage. A valve was opened by error, this caused an inflow of water to the tank. Around 2 p.m. on 19 Feb. an alarm went off, indicating that the tank was dangerously filled. This alarm was ignored, because no radioactive water was transferred to the tank. The tank, however, got overfilled, and the radioactive access water left the tank along the rain-gutter. Because all rainwater is directed outside the barriers around the tanks, the overflowing radioactive water seeped directly into the grounds. According to TEPCO all leakage was due to human error. The patrols were doubled to twice a day, and the number of workers involved was increased 6 times to 60 people. Because the leak was about 700 meters from the coastal line, TEPCO did believe <b>that</b> <b>none</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> water had reached the ocean.|$|E

40|$|Seabrook is at {{his most}} enjoyable as a writer when he veers {{slightly}} off course from documenting what occurred and offers searing ruminations of his own, {{as is the case}} with his monologue-like portion on the intergenerational incomprehensibility of poverty and lived experience. How can we possibly imagine the lives lived by the working poor crammed into tenements and filthy urban spaces never mind our indentured rural for-bears who were flogged and disgraced in public squares for centuries for daring to beg when ours is an unapologetically consumerist culture? Towards the end of the book the anecdotal stories of contemporary poverty lend colour and texture. However perhaps the book’s biggest flaw is one that Seabrook acknowledges from the start, that the voices of poor people from previous eras are largely absent. <b>This</b> <b>of</b> course is hardly Seabrook’s fault. He rightly points out the poor of earlier centuries were usually observed and judged, not consulted or interviewed, meaning there is scant supply of early first-hand accounts. Another problem is that the rationale behind the book’s structure isn’t entirely clear resulting in overlaps between chapters. <b>That</b> said <b>none</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> detracts from what the book achieves. Pauperland is a crucial reminder that for most of modern history the poor have been vilified, attacked and abused by those in power, all of which furnishes us with some critical context in which to begin to understand the ease with which the period of poor-bashing we currently inhabit was so seamlessly ushered in...|$|R

6000|$|We {{will now}} turn {{to the order of}} reptiles, which gives the most {{striking}} character to the zoology of these islands. The species are not numerous, but the numbers of individuals of each species are extraordinarily great. There is one small lizard belonging to a South American genus, and two species (and probably more) of the Amblyrhynchus--a genus confined to the Galapagos Islands. There is one snake which is numerous; it is identical, as I am informed by M. Bibron, with the Psammophis Temminckii from Chile. (17/2. This is stated by Dr. Gunther [...] "Zoological Society" [...] January 24, 1859, to be a peculiar species, not known to inhabit any other country.) Of sea-turtle I believe there are more than one species, and of tortoises there are, as we shall presently show, two or three species or races. Of toads and frogs there are none: I was surprised at this, considering how well suited for them the temperate and damp upper woods appeared to be. It recalled to my mind the remark made by Bory St. Vincent, namely, <b>that</b> <b>none</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> family are found on any of the volcanic islands in the great oceans. (17/3. [...] "Voyage aux Quatres Iles d'Afrique." [...] With respect to the Sandwich Islands see Tyerman and Bennett's [...] "Journal" [...] volume 1 page 434. For Mauritius see [...] "Voyage par un Officier" [...] etc. Part 1 page 170. There are no frogs in the Canary Islands, Webb et Berthelot [...] "Hist. Nat. des Iles Canaries." [...] I saw none at St. Jago in the Cape de Verds. There are none at St. Helena.) As far as I can ascertain from various works, this seems to hold good throughout the Pacific, and even in the large islands of the Sandwich archipelago. Mauritius offers an apparent exception, where I saw the Rana Mascariensis in abundance: this frog is said now to inhabit the Seychelles, Madagascar, and Bourbon; but on the other hand, Du Bois, in his voyage in 1669, states that there were no reptiles in Bourbon except tortoises; and the Officier du Roi asserts that before 1768 it had been attempted, without success, to introduce frogs into Mauritius--I presume for the purpose of eating: hence it may be well doubted whether this frog is an aboriginal of these islands. The absence of the frog family in the oceanic islands is the more remarkable, when contrasted with the case of lizards, which swarm on most of the smallest islands. May this difference not be caused by the greater facility with which the eggs of lizards, protected by calcareous shells, might be transported through salt-water, than could the slimy spawn of frogs? ...|$|E

She was always patient enough to know when I needed to work and when I could relax. She is a constant source of love and support and continually reminds me of the importance of what I am doing...|$|R
40|$|At {{sufficiently}} high densities, cold dense three-flavor quark {{matter is}} in the color-flavor locked (CFL) phase, in which all nine quarks pair in a particularly symmetric fashion. Once the heaviness of the strange quark (mass m_s) and the requirements of electric and color neutrality are taken into account, the CFL pattern of color superconductivity requires the pairing of quarks that would, {{in the absence of}} pairing, have Fermi momenta that differ by of order m_s^ 2 /μ, with μ the quark number chemical potential. This means that at sufficiently small μ, the "stress" on the pairing is large enough that the system can lower its energy by breaking pairs, resulting in some unconventional color superconductor which includes gapless excitations, spatial inhomogeneity, counter-propagating currents, or all three. In this paper we ask whether there is some less symmetric but still conventional pattern of pairing that can evade the stress. In other words, is there a pattern of pairing in which, once electric and color neutrality are imposed by suitable chemical potentials, pairing only occurs among those quarks whose Fermi momenta would be equal in the absence of pairing? We use graph-theoretical methods to classify 511 patterns of conventional color superconducting pairing, and show <b>that</b> <b>none</b> <b>of</b> them meet <b>this</b> requirement. All feel a stress, and all can be expected to become unstable to gapless modes at a density comparable to that at which the CFL phase becomes unstable.

40|$|Slurs have {{recently}} received {{a great deal}} of attention from philosophers of language. They are thought to be special in both their linguistic properties and their rhetorical effects-that is, in both what they mean and what they do. In this paper, drawing on the work of Elisabeth Camp and Rae Langton, I argue that a wide variety of speech shares the interesting features normally imputed to slurs. In using a slur, Camp argues, a speaker signals allegiance to a derogating perspective. He does not indicate merely that he believes a certain proposition; he indicates that certain features of the world are salient for him and that he experiences them as having a particular kind of disvalue. In her work on hate speech, Langton has argued that speech can be successful not only in its appeal to believe something but also in its appeal to feel or desire something. By presupposing that a hearer feels a certain way, a speaker can make it the case that she feels <b>that</b> way. But <b>none</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> is specific to slurs and hate speech. Non-evaluative terms can function in just the same way. When a speaker uses the expression "You're skinny" as a compliment, for example, she presupposes a particular evaluative perspective. Because the perspective is communicated as part of the not-at-issue content of her utterance, it is especially difficult for her hearers to object. The perspective can thus become taken for granted in the conversation without having been explicitly proposed or argued for. <b>This</b> kind <b>of</b> utterance doesn't merely change hearers' beliefs; it can also change their conative attitudes. And, like uses of slurs and other thick terms, it can change what we have social permission to say and do. by Rose Lenehan. Thesis: S.

5000|$|Early {{the next}} day, Kennedy and Scanlon {{went down to}} the creek to explore, leaving McIntyre to {{attended}} to camp duty. He fired two shots out of his fowling piece at a pair of parrots. These shots were heard by Kelly, who was on the lookout for the police. At about 5pm, McIntyre was at the fire making tea, with Lonigan by him, when they were suddenly surprised by the Kelly gang with the cry, [...] "Bail up; throw up your arms." [...] McIntyre testified that Kelly took his fowling piece, and that all the gang members were armed. (Kelly stated that only two had guns.) Having left his revolver at the tent door, McInytre held up his hands as directed. Lonigan went for cover behind a tree and, at the same time, put his hand on his revolver. Kelly shot him in the temple. He fell to the ground and said, [...] "Oh Christ, I am shot." [...] He died a few seconds later. Kelly remarked, [...] "What a pity; what made the fool run?" [...] Kelly had McIntyre searched and, when they found that he was unarmed, let him drop his hands. They took Lonigan and McIntyre's revolvers, and helped themselves to articles from the tent. Kelly talked to McIntyre and expressed his wonder that the police should have been so foolhardy as to look for him in the ranges. It was evident that he knew the exact state of the camp, the number of police and the description of the horses. He asked where the other two were, and told McIntyre he would kill him if he lied. McIntyre revealed their whereabouts and pleaded for their lives: I told Kelly that they were both countrymen and co-religionists of his own. ... I thought he might be possessed of some of that patriotic-religious feeling which is such a bond of sympathy amongst the Irish people. My opinion is <b>that</b> he possessed <b>none</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> feeling. On the question of religion I believe he was apathetic, and like a great many young bushmen he prided himself more on his Australian birth than he did upon his extraction from any particular race. A favourite expression of his was: 'I will let them see what one native Australian can do.' ...|$|R
