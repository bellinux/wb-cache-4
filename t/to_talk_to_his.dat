5|$|In 2003 Trump {{tried to}} move the Sybase Classic, a LPGA tournament, from Wykagyl Country Club to Trump's club for 2007; the Wykagyl lease would run out in that year. Briarcliff Manor's mayor Peter Chatsky was opposed to the plan; Trump {{attempted}} to persuade the mayor <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> wife, Jean Chatzky, about the financial benefit of hosting the tournament, adding that village residents would be hired for the event. A Trump Organization vice president suggested donating some proceeds to the Briarcliff Manor Public Library's then-proposed expansion or toward improving a village baseball field. The club's special-use permit with the village restricted the course to 300 people and banned large-scale tournaments from taking place there. The discussion between the Trump Organization and village government stopped that year, however in 2004, Trump submitted a new request to bring a LPGA or PGA tournament to the club.|$|E
5|$|In Blessing, Tennessee, Jared Chirp, while {{attempting}} to flee his home, is attacked by rattlesnakes inside his car and killed. Federal agents Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson), after conferring with the completely ordinary Reverend Mackey, go to Reverend Enoch O'Connor's church, Church of God with Signs and Wonders, where Biblical literalism is stressed and snakes are used during his services. As such, O'Connor becomes the prime suspect. Later, a woman named Iris tells Reverend Mackey that she feels guilty because Jared called her on the night he died in order <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> girlfriend, Gracie. Iris, however, refused because Gracie was in bed. Later that night, Iris is bitten when her staple remover turns into a snake; she promptly goes into the bathroom to clean up but is killed when snakes appear everywhere in the bathroom.|$|E
5|$|Rohan begs Rahul to come home, but Rahul refuses. Pooja {{convince}}s Rohan {{to invite}} {{his parents to}} London; Rahul and Nandini are overjoyed to see one another, but Rahul still refuses <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> father. When Yash goes to a store, Anjali stumbles by and Rohan reveals {{that they have been}} living in London the whole time. Yash soon learns that his mother had died and that her last wish was for Yash, Rahul, and Rohan to light her funeral pyre together. Therefore, the entire family attends the funeral, and Nandini tells Yash that she thought he was wrong for disowning Rahul. Rohan and Pooja convince Rahul to talk to Yash, who apologizes and allows Rahul and Anjali into the house. Rohan and Pooja are married, and the family hold a belated celebration of Rahul and Anjali's wedding.|$|E

5|$|Some of his {{selections}} as captain {{were widely}} debated. Following {{incidents in the}} Caribbean, Trueman did not play for England again under Hutton's captaincy, although he was still regarded as an England prospect. Jim Laker was also omitted from the team, possibly because Hutton doubted Laker's commitment. Both Jim McConnon, Laker's replacement, and Vic Wilson were controversial choices for the 1954–55 Australian tour, whose selections Trevor Bailey attributed to Hutton; neither played a substantial role on the tour. A poor communicator, Hutton distanced himself from his team when a stronger lead was required. Trueman and Bailey thought Hutton found it hard <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> players: amateur critics considered this an inevitable consequence of a professional leading other professionals. On the other hand, Hutton {{played a key role}} in the development of fast bowlers Trueman, Tyson and Brian Statham. Tyson and Statham later acknowledged his advice and encouragement as factor in their subsequent success. Cowdrey also acknowledged Hutton's advice and assistance when the former began his career. Furthermore, on the 1954–55 tour of Australia, Hutton took a close interest in him and was a particular comfort when Cowdrey's father died during the tour.|$|E
25|$|Soon afterwards, Libyan media {{reported}} that Megrahi was able <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> mother {{by telephone from}} his hospital bed and The Times, {{at the beginning of}} November, suggested that his condition had not deteriorated significantly.|$|E
25|$|This last {{discrepancy}} may {{be explained}} as Dalin wanting <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> father but not wanting to open the emotional floodgates of a reunion that both want but seem unable {{to take the first}} step towards. Instead Dalin asks Kolea about his parents, and Kolea replies as if he knew them well. On Games Day Germany in 2009 Abnett clarified this discrepancy being caused by the psychic influence of Agun Soric, which meddled with the character's thinking, and made Dalin forget the revealed identity of his father.|$|E

25|$|As a {{conservative}} Christian, Boone declined certain songs and movie roles {{that he felt}} might compromise his beliefs—including a role with sex symbol Marilyn Monroe. In {{one of his first}} films, April Love, the director, Henry Levin, wanted him to give co-star Shirley Jones a kiss (which was not in the script). Since this would be his first onscreen kiss, Boone said that he wanted <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> wife first, {{to make sure it was}} all right with her. He had his own film production company, Cooga Mooga Productions.|$|E
25|$|Although many around Presley {{were worried}} about his {{worsening}} drug dependency, Parker appeared to ignore the problem. Several members of Presley's band later stated that Parker had no idea just how bad the situation was, although others have stood by the suggestion that Parker just didn't want to admit {{there was such a}} problem because he didn't {{know how to deal with}} it and was worried about any negative publicity it would create. According to Parker himself, he did attempt <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> client about the matter, but Presley simply told him to stay out of his personal life.|$|E
25|$|Dumbledore {{recovered}} the ring from Marvolo's estate, recognizing it {{as both a}} Horcrux {{and one of the}} Deathly Hallows. Forgetting that as a Horcrux, it was likely to be protected by curses laid by Voldemort, and blinded by personal desire, Dumbledore attempted to use the Resurrection Stone <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> deceased family. The curse destroyed his hand and began to spread throughout his body. Though the spread was partly contained in the destroyed and blackened hand by Snape, Dumbledore was doomed, having at most a year to live. In their Kings Cross encounter, Dumbledore told Harry that this proved he had learned nothing from his past mistakes and ambitions for using the Hallows, and was {{part of the reason for}} his fear that Harry might also become obsessed with their power if told of them.|$|E

25|$|On 3 October 1939, {{he was the}} {{commanding}} instructor for Haganah Leader's courses held at Yavniel when two British Palestine Police officers discovered a quantity of illegal rifles. Haganah HQ ordered the camp evacuated. Leading a group of 43 men through Wadi Bira, early the following morning, 12 to 15 Arab members of the Transjordan Frontier Force arrested them. Questions were asked about how such a large force was arrested by a much smaller one. Moshe Carmel, the group's deputy commander, was also critical of Dayan's willingness <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> interrogators in Acre prison. On 30 October 1939, most of the group were sentenced to 10 years in prison. Seven months later, Dayan was replaced as the prisoners' representative after {{it was discovered that}} moves were being made to get him an individual pardon. On 16 February 1941, after Chaim Weizmann's intervention in London, they were all released.|$|E
25|$|Patrick {{decides to}} {{continue}} working at General Hospital, and relocates to Port Charles. Robin also decides {{to stay in the}} place she called home for most of her life. The two often disagree on patients' treatment, with Patrick leaning toward more invasive surgeries and Robin wanting to use drug therapies. The opposing physicians quarrel at the hospital on a daily basis. But it is Noah and Patrick's non-existent father/son relationship that helps develop Patrick and Robin's relationship. When he was a teenager, Patrick's mother died during a surgery that Noah was performing. Noah could not forgive himself and turned to alcohol as a result. He became a neglectful father and his relationship with Patrick suffered severely. At the same time, Robin developed her own set of father issues with the re-emergence of a not-so-dead Robert Scorpio. Early on, Robin and Patrick connected because of their dead beat nonexistent fathers. Though her father left shortly after he returned and never fully healed their broken relationship, Robin tried to mend the fence between Patrick and Noah and in a way acted as mediator. Robin and Patrick learn more about each other's pasts and soon Robin is able to convince Patrick <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> father. In conversation, Patrick admits his love for his father and inspires Noah to go to rehab.|$|E
25|$|In Game 2, it was James Shields who got {{the start}} against C. J. Wilson. With runners on the corners in the 3rd inning, Shields went to 1st base for a pickoff attempt, but the throw over was errant, {{allowing}} the runner to score from 3rd base. Ian Kinsler launched a solo homer to left in the 4th, putting Texas up 2–0. In the 5th, Shields {{was removed from the}} game with two on and one out, being replaced by Chad Qualls to face Michael Young. With a 2–2 count, Young checked his swing on a pitch that was called a ball. The Rays appealed to first base umpire Jerry Meals, but Meals ruled that Young held up in time, drawing the ire of the Rays dugout. Replays showed that Young may not have checked in time, and had the ruling been made that he did not, it would have resulted in a strikeout. Instead, Young went deep to center on the very next pitch for a 3-run home run, putting the Rangers up 5–0. Rays manager Joe Maddon went out to the mound <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> pitcher after the home run, but began arguing with home plate umpire Jim Wolf about the check swing, which led to Wolf ejecting Maddon from the game. Texas added another run in the 6th inning, and held the Rays scoreless, winning 6–0 and taking a commanding 2–0 lead in the best-of-five series.|$|E

500|$|The {{top three}} drivers {{appeared}} on the podium to collect their trophies and in the subsequent press conference. Barrichello's maiden Formula One victory was very popular amongst spectators and team personnel, because it came after a set back earlier in his career, not least a serious accident during practice for the 1994 San Marino Grand Prix that left him unconscious. Barrichello dedicated his victory to fellow Brazilian and three-time World Champion Ayrton Senna who had helped him during the early phase of his career. He also revealed {{that it was his}} decision to stay out on dry tyres as he believed he would have an advantage on the straights and the chicanes, although he flat-spotted a tyre in the closing stages of the Grand Prix which reduced his visibility. Häkkinen said that he felt [...] "in control" [...] during {{the first phase of the}} event, although he admitted that he was conservative on the wet tyres and could have secured victory on dry tyres. Coulthard revealed that he utilised tactics performed by Michael Schumacher at the start after he sought clarification on the rules regarding such manoeuvres. He additionally commented that he was unable <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> team via radio in the forest sections which caused him to stay out for an additional lap when Häkkinen pitted.|$|E
500|$|Joy Division {{were due}} to begin their first American tour in May 1980. While Curtis had {{expressed}} a desire to take time off to visit a few acquaintances, he feigned excitement about the tour around the band because {{he did not want to}} disappoint either his bandmates or Factory Records. At the time, Curtis's relationship with his wife, Deborah (the couple had married in 1975 as teenagers), was strained. Contributing factors were his ill health, his excluding her from band activities, and his affair with a young Belgian woman named Annik Honoré whom he had met on a 1979 European tour. The evening before Joy Division were to fly out for their first American tour, Curtis returned to his home in Macclesfield <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> by then estranged wife. He asked her to drop the divorce suit she had filed; later, he told her to leave him alone in the house until he caught a train to Manchester the following morning. Early on 18 May 1980, having spent the night watching the Werner Herzog film Stroszek, Curtis hanged himself in his kitchen. Deborah discovered his body later that day when she returned to their home. It came as a shock both to the band members and their management. In 2005, Wilson recollected: [...] "I think all of us made the mistake of not thinking his suicide was going to happen We all completely underestimated the danger. We didn't take it seriously. That's how stupid we were".|$|E
500|$|Felton (Daniel Baldwin) and Howard (Melissa Leo) {{investigate}} {{the murder of}} an Iowa woman who {{was shot to death}} in front of her husband Robert Ellison (Robin Williams) and two young children during a stick-up. Since the victims are tourists, the case becomes a [...] "red ball" [...] and receives considerable attention from the press, city officials and top police brass. Bayliss (Kyle Secor) tries to interview the two young children, but Ellison stops him, protesting that the experience is too hard on them. After obtaining information from street thugs, the police arrest Marvin (Antonio Charity), who possesses 45-caliber bullets matching those used in the shooting. Marvin tells the detectives that he's a [...] "stone stick-up man" [...] who has robbed dozens of people and never shot anyone because people don't argue with a [...]45-carrying man, and also that he knows he will spend decades in prison anyway because he was involved in the shooting so there is no reason he would lie about being the shooter. A mournful Ellison overhears Felton making jokes about the investigation and bragging about the overtime he expects to receive from it. He angrily demands Felton be thrown off the case, but Gee (Yaphet Kotto) calms him down by explaining the police have to be detached from the victims because they encounter so many. Ellison takes his children back to their hotel room, where his daughter Abby (Julia Devin) is in denial about her mother's death, and his son Matt (Jake Gyllenhaal) angrily refuses <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> father.|$|E

2500|$|Taylor was {{a popular}} member of the England and Derbyshire squads, his {{nickname}} [...] "Chat" [...] deriving from his willingness <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> teammates and listen to their problems. Himself a mediocre batsmen but skilled keeper, Taylor has continued to advocate the picking of capable wicket-keepers over those with lesser ability behind the stumps but greater talent with the bat. He has been vocal over English selection policies since retirement, particularly those of Geraint Jones, Chris Read and Matt Prior.|$|E
2500|$|In May 1974, Acosta {{disappeared}} {{while traveling}} in Mazatlán, Mexico. His son, Marco Acosta, {{believes that he}} was the last person <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> father. Acosta telephoned his son from Mazatlán, telling him that he was [...] "about to board a boat full of white snow." [...] Marco is later quoted in reference to his father's disappearance: [...] "The body was never found, but we surmise that probably, knowing the people he was involved with, he ended up mouthing off, getting into a fight, and getting killed." ...|$|E
2500|$|Until he {{lost his}} wife, Nalinikanta had seen death as the {{ultimate}} end. Losing her led him {{to believe that there}} must be life after death. Nalinikanta became obsessed with this question. His inquiry took him to Madras (now Chennai) to study theosophy at the Theosophical Society at Adyar. Through a medium, he was able <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> <b>his</b> wife, but remained unsatisfied. His discussions at the society led him to search for a yogi who could fulfill his desire to meet his dead wife and educate him in the true philosophy of [...] "life after death".|$|E
