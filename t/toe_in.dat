5|$|After {{starting}} at left offensive tackle from 1970 to 1972, and missing only one game in that span, Key {{was moved to}} left guard for the 1973 season. He played in 12 games in 1973, missing two due to injury, and all 14 games in 1974, despite suffering hand and thumb injuries {{in a game against}} the Washington Redskins. During the 1975 season, he suffered a knee injury during mini-camp in May that required surgery, a dislocated <b>toe</b> <b>in</b> {{the first game of the}} season against the New York Giants that was thought to take at least six weeks to recover from, and a fractured forearm in practice on October 16 that also required surgery. He was placed on injured reserve due to the broken arm on October 17 after playing in only two games during the season. From 1976 to 1978, he played in 40 games and started in 39 of them.|$|E
5|$|Back, leg, {{and neck}} {{injuries}} {{began to take}} a toll on Van Buren in 1950, and his production dropped. He broke his <b>toe</b> <b>in</b> the 1950 off-season and suffered from bone spurs, which caused him to miss the team's four preseason exhibition games and regular season opener. He returned to lead the league in carries for the fourth straight season, but lost the rushing title {{for the first time}} in four years and had career-lows in touchdowns and yards per carry. The Eagles finished with a 6–6 regular season record. Greasy Neale was fired by the Eagles the following February and replaced by Bo McMillin. In 1951, Van Buren played alongside his brother, halfback and linebacker Ebert, whom the Eagles selected in that year's draft out of LSU. The elder Van Buren continued to play through injuries, taking several shots of Novocaine before each game. He had a career-low 327 rushing yards for the season, as the Eagles finished with a losing record for the first time since 1942.|$|E
5|$|Fast {{transient}} response and low distortion are both characteristic of electrostatics. The driver, being only 0.00137-inch thick and weighing only 3mg, is thus capable of stopping and starting seemingly instantaneously with no damping {{necessary to the}} drive units. However, the design also limits bandwidth to between 40Hz and 10kHz. Kohli of TNT noted that upper register starts to taper above 10kHz and then falls off severely beyond 13kHz, and is 15-20dB down at 20kHz. The speaker's design makes them extremely directional, and the general practice is to <b>toe</b> <b>in</b> the speakers to point directly to the listener. Although a slight deviation {{did not seem to}} make a difference, it is in practice not possible for more than one person to enjoy a reasonably balanced sound stage with the ESL.|$|E

5|$|Prior to {{the start}} of the 2014–15 season, Durant was {{diagnosed}} with a Jones fracture in his right foot and was ruled out for six to eight weeks. He subsequently missed the first 17 games of the year, making his season debut for the Thunder on December 2 against the New Orleans Pelicans. On December 18, he injured his ankle against the Golden State Warriors, returning to action on December 31 against the Phoenix Suns to score a season-high 44 points. He then sprained his left big <b>toe</b> <b>in</b> late January. On February 22, he was sidelined again after undergoing a minor procedure to help reduce pain and discomfort in his surgically repaired right foot, and on March 27, he was officially ruled out for the rest of the season after deciding to undergo foot surgery. In just 27 games, he averaged 25.4 points, 6.6 rebounds, and 4.1 assists per game.|$|E

25|$|In {{the summer}} of 1995–96, Australia played home series against Pakistan and Sri Lanka. He took 11 wickets in the first Test against Pakistan but broke his <b>toe</b> <b>in</b> the second.

25|$|Following the New York Marathon, Radcliffe {{suffered}} more injury setbacks: she had {{to withdraw}} from the 2009 London Marathon due to a fractured <b>toe.</b> <b>In</b> March that year, she had a bunion removed which doctors believed was the root cause of her other injuries at that time. She did not run competitively for almost 10 months, but made herself available for inclusion in the 2009 British team for the World Championships in Athletics. She announced that the New York City Half Marathon would be a testing ground for her fitness before the competition.|$|E
25|$|The {{government}} {{plans to}} reorganise its subsidy system, {{which is a}} heavy burden on government finances. In the short term these subsidies are helping to ease the burden but they cannot keep rising indefinitely, {{and sooner or later}} the load will have to be shared out. In the short term, national consumption per capita is expected to rise from the current level of 0.4 tonnes of oil equivalent (toe) to as much as 0.90 <b>toe</b> <b>in</b> 2030, a good indication of development, but a massive challenge as well. The input of renewable energy is a matter of particular importance.|$|E
25|$|Human {{walking is}} {{accomplished}} with a strategy called the double pendulum. During forward motion, the leg {{that leaves the}} ground swings forward from the hip. This sweep is the first pendulum. Then the leg strikes {{the ground with the}} heel and rolls through to the <b>toe</b> <b>in</b> a motion described as an inverted pendulum. The motion of the two legs is coordinated so that one foot or the other is always in contact with the ground. The process of walking recovers approximately sixty per cent of the energy used due to pendulum dynamics and ground reaction force.|$|E

25|$|The cost {{of group}} portraits was usually {{shared by the}} subjects, often not equally. The amount paid might {{determine}} each person's place in the picture, either head to <b>toe</b> <b>in</b> full regalia in the foreground or face only {{in the back of}} the group. Sometimes all group members paid an equal sum, which was likely to lead to quarrels when some members gained a more prominent place in the picture than others. In Amsterdam most of these paintings would ultimately end up in the possession of the city council, and many are now on display in the Amsterdams Historisch Museum; there are no significant examples outside the Netherlands.|$|E
25|$|After graduating, both Orton and Halliwell {{went into}} {{regional}} repertory work: Orton spent {{four months in}} Ipswich as an assistant stage manager; Halliwell in Llandudno, Wales. Both returned to London and began to write together. They collaborated {{on a number of}} unpublished novels (often imitating Ronald Firbank) with no success at gaining publication. The rejection of their great hope, The Last Days of Sodom, in 1957 led them to solo works. Orton wrote his last novel, The Vision of Gombold Proval (posthumously published as Head to <b>Toe),</b> <b>in</b> 1959. He would later draw on these manuscripts for ideas; many show glimpses of his stage-play style.|$|E
25|$|Oklahoma missed {{some key}} players on their defense. Reggie Smith, an All-Conference cornerback, broke his big <b>toe</b> <b>in</b> the Big 12 Championship game {{and missed the}} bowl game. His backup, Lendy Holmes, was ruled academically ineligible and also missed the bowl game. Sophomore {{defensive}} tacke DeMarcus Granger was sent home after being arrested on the suspicion of shoplifting from a local mall. On {{the day of the}} game, it was reported that wide receiver Malcolm Kelly was questionable due to a deep thigh bruise. Because of the losses in the secondary, West Virginia stated they would consider passing more {{to take advantage of the}} less experienced players filling those positions.|$|E

25|$|Stallard {{had never}} ridden a massed event {{on the open}} road in Britain. The English cycle-racing {{authorities}} had, {{since the end of}} the 19th century, banned racing on the roads, fearing the police would ban all cycling as a result. The National Cyclists' Union, the governing body, demanded races be held only on tracks and, later, on circuits such as airfields that were closed to traffic. Although time trials (races between individuals competing against the clock) had started as a revolt against the NCU's ban – the races were held at dawn on courses kept secret from the public with riders dressed from head to <b>toe</b> <b>in</b> black to complete the secrecy – there were no races on open roads between riders starting together.|$|E
25|$|His {{total number}} of bouts is 1795, the third highest ever, his {{total number of}} makuuchi bouts (1378) is the fourth highest ever. His 860 wins are the ninth highest ever; his 938 losses were the most ever {{recorded}} until Kyokutenhō finished his career with 944 losses in 2015. When he had to sit out 1 day of the March 1997 tournament and the whole May 1997 tournament after breaking his big <b>toe</b> <b>in</b> a bout against Kyokushūzan it ended a run of 1359 bouts without absence, the sixth highest ever. 1063 of these were in makuuchi, the fourth highest ever. His 110 tournaments ranked as a sekitori (in the top two divisions) was an all-time record until it was broken by Kaiō in 2010.|$|E
25|$|In 2006, {{two major}} {{productions}} were staged {{within a few}} weeks of one another. The first opened on 29 May at Shakespeare's Globe, directed by Lucy Bailey and starring Douglas Hodge as Titus, Geraldine Alexander as Tamora, Shaun Parkes as Aaron and Laura Rees as Lavinia. Bailey focused on a realistic presentation throughout the production; for example, after her mutilation, Lavinia is covered from head to <b>toe</b> <b>in</b> blood, with her stumps crudely bandaged, and raw flesh visible beneath. So graphic was Bailey's use of realism that at several productions, audience members fainted upon Lavinia's appearance. The production was also controversial insofar as the Globe had a roof installed {{for the first time in}} its history. The decision was taken by designer William Dudley, who took as his inspiration a feature of the Colosseum known as a velarium – a cooling system which consisted of a canvas-covered, net-like structure made of ropes, with a hole in the centre. Dudley made it as a PVC awning which was intended to darken the auditorium.|$|E
