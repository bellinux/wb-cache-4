Sisko appears as expected, and Jake explains everything to him, telling him that his death will give them both a [...] "second chance", and reminds him to dodge the energy discharge.

As they return home together, Sisko gains a greater appreciation for his son, knowing he would have given up his life for his father, even though this future Jake would cease to exist due to his sacrifice of himself to save his father.|$|E

A new diagnsotic tool is exploited to quantify how, over long times, different segments of the same chaotic orbit can exhibit very different amounts of chaos. First passage time experiments are used to study how small perturbations of an individual orbit can dramatically accelerate phase space transport, allowing `sticky' chaotic orbits trapped near regular islands <b>to</b> <b>become</b> <b>unstuck</b> on suprisingly short time scales. Small perturbations are also studied in the context of orbit ensembles with the aim of understanding how such irregularities can increase the efficacy of chaotic mixing. For both noise and periodic driving, the effect of the perturbation scales roughly in amplitude. For white noise, the details are unimportant: additive and multiplicative noise tend to have similar effects and {{the presence or absence of}} a friction related to the noise by a Fluctuation- Dissipation Theorem is largely irrelevant. Allowing for coloured noise can significantly decrease the efficacy of the perturbation, but only when the autocorrelation time, which vanishes for white noise, becomes so large that t here is little power at frequencies comparable to the natural frequencies of the unperturbed orbit. This suggests strongly that noise-induced extrinsic diffusion, like modulational diffusion associated with periodic driving, is a resonance phenomenon. Potential implications for galaxies are discussed. Comment: 15 pages including 18 figures, uses MNRAS LaTeX macro...|$|E

25|$|Left {{unanswered}} by {{the professional}} analyses {{was the question}} of whose open microphone captured the sounds recorded on the Dictabelt, if not Officer H.B. McLain. Jim Bowles, a Dallas police dispatcher supervisor in November 1963, and later Dallas County Sheriff, believes it originated from a particular officer on a three-wheeled motorcycle stationed at the Dallas Trade Mart, the original destination of President Kennedy's motorcade, along the same freeway to Parkland Hospital, which would account {{for the sound of}} sirens rushing by. McLain himself believes that it was from a different officer on a three-wheeler near the Trade Mart, who was known for his whistling.

50|$|As of 2004, the {{marketing}} mascots are a care-free Jamaican cinnamon stick named CinnaMon and an accident-prone apple named Bad Apple.

5000|$|Jamboree is {{the second}} album by Beat Happening, {{released}} in 1988 through K Records/Rough Trade Records.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we analyze the {{changing}} role {{of gold in}} the international monetary system, in particular the persistence of gold holdings by monetary authorities for 20 years following {{the breakdown of the}} Brettone Woods system system and the Second Amendment to the Articles of Agreement of the International Monetary Fund which severed the formal link to gold. We stress four points. First, the gold-exchange standard was a recent arrangement that emerged only around 1900 in response to a set of historically-specific factors which also help to account for it smooth operation. How long those factors would have continued to support it will never be known, due to a great war and then a great depression. Second, a system which relied on inelastically supplied precious metal and elastcially suppled foreign exchange to meet the the world economy's demand for reserves was intrinsically fragile, prone to confidence problems, and a transmission belt for policy mistakes. Third, network externalities, statutory restrictions and habit all contributed to the persistence of the practice of holding gold reserves. But the hold of even factors as powerful as these inevitably weakens with time and the effects of their erosion are reinforced by the rise of international capital mobility, which increases the ease of holding other forms of reserves, both unborrowed and borrowed, and by the shift to greater exchange-rate flexibility, which according to our results diminishes the demand for reserves in general. Fourth and finally, network externalities, in conjunction with central bankers' collective sense of responsibility for the stability of the price of what remains an important reserve asset, suggest that the same factors which have long held in place the practice of holding gold reserves, when they come <b>unstuck,</b> may <b>become</b> <b>unstuck</b> all at once. ...|$|R
40|$|Neoliberalism The {{neoliberal}} {{argument is}} essentially an economic and political philosophy advocating free markets, deregulation, privatization of public assets, more unencumbered free trade, and less government “interference” in economic (and social welfare issues). Neoliberalism promotes a free market economy approach to social issues, to public provision of services and to public spending generally. It {{has been referred to}} as “supply-side economics” and for example rejects the view that governments should try and create more employment directly through industry policy or overall “demand management” in favour of a sole focus on the supply of a flexible skilled yet cheap workforce – hence the importance of “work and learning. ” Neoliberal economics supports greater freedom and recognition of the captains of corporations but has now <b>become</b> <b>unstuck</b> with the argument that some financial institutions are “too big to fail” – which means in effect they are “so big that they can depend on society (that is taxpayers) to prop them up when they topple” (Patel, 2009, p 19). This is a clear contradiction of the neoliberal philosophy of no government interventions in the market. Inequality We live in societies (some would argue in one global society) in which the gap between the richest and the poorest, between those who live full lives in the economically developed countries and those who live “half lives at best” in the less developed countries, is growing (Honderich, 2002, p 6). Many workers in Western countries (or the economic North) have experienced a decline in the value of real wages, and they must struggle to stay abreast of inflation even at low inflation rates, while the incomes of the rich continue to climb. The fallout from the 2008 global financial crisis and the 2010 - 12 attack on national debt will ensure that the “social wage” (public services, education, health care etc) and public pensions will decline in real terms: but not the corporate and bankers bonuses.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{attempts to}} answer one very large question: in what political ways do {{the aesthetics of}} food function? Throughout this dissertation, I articulate moments in food culture when nostalgia (looking backwards to foods of the past) in fact becomes an idealized model for a utopian future. This conflation of looking backward (nostalgia) and looking forward (utopianism) demonstrates {{the ways in which}} time is multiple and multi-directional. In my current work, I address the relationship between nostalgia and utopian thinking in two case studies: the ancient Greek comedies of Aristophanes and cookbooks from the contemporary American South. In these two examples, nostalgia for food is entangled with utopian rhetoric, and moving back towards an agricultural, pre-democratic government is figured as a utopian turn. This nostalgia often operates as a revisionist history that erases slave labor and scarcity. However, what I call "the utopian turn" also offers both new dramatic possibilities for characters on the Greek comic stage and a more inclusive definition of the South for contemporary chefs and cookbook authors. I argue that in these case studies, one might recoup a kernel of utopian thinking from an otherwise conservative, nostalgic turn to an agricultural past. The first half of the dissertation outlines the utopias presented in Aristophanes' comedies, which paradoxically both look back nostalgically to a pre- democratic, agrarian society and represent that society as full of urban, imported luxury foods. In {{the second half of the}} dissertation, using a horizontal approach across popular media, I examine representations of the South from the New Southern Food Movement in which the South's agrarian past is figured as free from labor, in which southern food is figured as gourmet, luxury food. Ultimately, I conclude that food in performance <b>becomes</b> <b>unstuck</b> in time (moving back to an imagined nostalgic past or forwards towards an imagined utopian future) in order to critique contemporary political crises and create aesthetic solutions that point towards a better futur...|$|R
