In the 1970s, after <b>trying</b> <b>and</b> abandoning many others for reasons of sound or maintainability, he settled on the Japanese-made Pearl Drums.|$|E

5|$|After {{turning down}} {{potential}} transfers to West Ham and Torquay, because {{neither he nor}} his wife wanted to live in either place, Irvine decided to sign for Third Division outfit Halifax Town in December 1972. Despite taking a considerable pay cut, he chose Halifax to enable his family to return to live near Burnley. Irvine made a total of 11 first-team appearances for Halifax Town, scoring one goal for the club. He played his last competitive game for the club in the 1–0 win against York City on 13 March 1973, after manager George Mulhall accused Irvine of not <b>trying</b> <b>and</b> not deserving his wage. At the end of the 1972–73 season, the team avoided relegation to the Fourth Division on goal difference. After failing to report for the away game at Walsall on 1May 1973, to play in a testimonial match for Burnley defender John Angus, he was fined two weeks' wages and forced into extra training sessions. In the summer of 1973, Irvine left Halifax Town by mutual consent, his professional football career over at the age of 29. Despite having the option to sign for Rochdale, he joined semi-professional side Great Harwood, who played in the Northern Premier League. At Great Harwood, he played alongside two former Burnley teammates; goalkeeper Adam Blacklaw and midfielder Les Latcham. Irvine remained at the club for a number of months, before leaving midway through the 1973–74 season and retiring from football altogether.|$|E
5|$|The next {{match was}} the {{submission}} match between champion Bret Hart and challenger Bob Backlund, with the aforementioned stipulation {{being that the}} only way to win the match was to have the opposing cornerman (either Owen Hart or Davey Boy Smith) throw in the towel. Bret got the early advantage and wore down Backlund using head locks, but Backlund broke free and attempted a crossface chickenwing on Bret. Bret escaped, but Backlund maintained the advantage by attacking Bret's arm and attempting another crossface chickenwing. Bret used a figure four leglock on Backlund, but Backlund got out of the hold. Bret then applied the Sharpshooter, his signature hold, on Backlund. Owen entered the ring and clotheslined Bret from behind, causing him to break the hold, and exited the ring. Smith then chased Owen around the ring, but fell and was kayfabe knocked unconscious on the ring steps. While Bret was distracted, Backlund applied the crossface chickenwing. Owen looked on in disbelief at what was happening to Bret and went to the ringside area, where their parents Stu and Helen Hart were sitting. Owen begged them to throw Bret's towel in to the ring to save him as Backlund kept the hold locked in for what would eventually total nine and a half minutes. Stu refused to do so, not trusting Owen's motives, but Helen overruled him and tossed the towel into the ring. Owen then ran into the ring and showed the referee Bret's towel, and the match and championship were awarded to Backlund as Owen took off backstage holding the towel over his head triumphantly, saying later that this Thanksgiving would be the best ever due to him having finally cost Bret the WWF World Heavyweight Championship after <b>trying</b> <b>and</b> failing to do so himself.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe {{development}} of trichomes and root hairs in Arabidopsis provide useful {{models for the}} study of cell fate determination in plants. A common network of putative transcriptional regulators, including the small MYB proteins TRIPTYCHON (<b>TRY)</b> <b>and</b> CAPRICE (CPC), is known to influence the patterning of both cell types. Here, we used an activation tagging strategy to identify a new regulator, ENHANCER OF <b>TRY</b> <b>AND</b> CPC 1 (ETC 1). The ETC 1 sequence is similar to <b>TRY</b> <b>and</b> CPC, and ETC 1 overexpression causes a reduction in trichome formation and excessive root hair production. The etc 1 single mutant has no significant phenotype, but it enhances the effect of cpc <b>and</b> <b>try</b> on trichome <b>and</b> root hair development, which shows that ETC 1 function is partially redundant with <b>TRY</b> <b>and</b> CPC. In addition, the etc 1 try cpc triple mutant has novel phenotypes, revealing previously unrecognized roles for these regulators in epidermis development. An ETC 1 promoter–reporter gene fusion is expressed in the developing trichome and non-hair cells, similar to the expression of <b>TRY</b> <b>and</b> CPC. These results suggest that ETC 1, <b>TRY,</b> <b>and</b> CPC act in concert to repress the trichome cell fate in the shoot epidermis and the non-hair cell fate in the root epidermis...|$|R

25|$|The {{basis of}} this {{approach}} is to look at mental illness or distress {{from the perspective of a}} spiritual crisis. Spiritual interventions focus on developing a sense of meaning, purpose and hope for the person in their current life experience. Spiritual interventions involve listening to the person's story and facilitating the person to connect to God, a greater power or greater whole, perhaps by using meditation or prayer. This may be a religious or non-religious experience depending on the individual's own spirituality. Spiritual interventions, along with psychosocial interventions, emphasize the importance of engagement, however, spiritual interventions focus more on caring and 'being with' the person during their time of crisis, rather than intervening and <b>trying</b> <b>and</b> 'fix' the problem. Spiritual interventions tend to be based on qualitative research and share some similarities with the humanistic approach to psychotherapy.|$|E
25|$|After {{numerous}} acts of lawlessness, {{and with}} no established court system, Edgerton supported his nephew, Wilbur F. Sanders, and other residents of Bannack and Virginia City as they organized the Vigilantes. This group began meeting in secret, and began <b>trying</b> <b>and</b> lynching suspected criminals. On January 10, 1864, members of the Vigilance Committee traveled to Sheriff Henry Plummer's home. Plummer was suspected of murder, and the men coaxed him from his sickbed. They then grabbed him, and brought him to a gallows he had constructed for hangings. Then the men put a noose over his neck, and hung him next to two of his deputies who were also accused of being road agents. Along with the lynching of Plummer, the Montana Vigilantes hung 22 road agents. After these actions Edgerton's nephew, Wilbur F. Sanders, was forced to defend the group in Utah courts.|$|E
25|$|After Stalin's {{death in}} 1953, {{many cases of}} the Soviet {{political}} prisoners were re-examined by the Soviet authorities during the de-Stalinization campaign and Poška was {{allowed to return to}} Lithuania in 1959. After his return home Poška worked as a lecturer, a correspondent of several newspapers, {{and the chairman of the}} reestablished Vilnius Esperantist Club in 1964–69. As a former political prisoner, he remained suspect to Soviet authorities and was not allowed to continue academic activities or publish his books until the Perestroika reforms in 1985. Poška continued to travel. For example, in 1960, together with biologist Tadas Ivanauskas, he visited the Tigrovaya Balka Nature Reserve in Tajikistan and later hitchhiked to Leningrad and Moldova. In summer 1972, at age 70, he went on the last large journey. It was a five-week motorbike ride to the Mount Elbrus in the Caucasus Mountains, via the Georgian Military Road to Georgia, Armenia, Azerbaijan and Sukhumi on the Black sea. The last decade of his life Poška spent under the piles of his rescued archive, <b>trying</b> <b>and</b> failing to publish it. His major work, the eight-volume book on his journey to India From the Baltic Sea to the Bay of Bengal, was published by his supporters already after his death.|$|E
