5|$|The {{government}} received American {{news coverage}} during the Democratic Party's 2008 presidential primaries after <b>the</b> <b>details</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> conversation between Barack Obama's economic advisor Austan Goolsbee, and Canadian diplomat Georges Rioux were revealed. Reportedly Goolsbee was reassuring the Canadians that Obama's comments on potentially renegotiating the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) were more political rhetoric than actual policy. The accuracy of these reports has been debated {{by both the}} Obama campaign and the Canadian Government. The news came at a key time nearing the Ohio and Texas primaries, where perceptions among Democratic voters was (and is) {{that the benefits of}} the NAFTA agreement are dubious. Thus the appearance that Obama was not being completely forthright was attacked by his opponent Hillary Clinton.|$|E
5|$|A {{group of}} Louisville Democrats, {{supporters}} of U. S. Senator Jo Blackburn, {{made the first}} formal calls for a new convention.

As Brown had been thought to be a supporter of Goebel, this announcement caused no small stir among Democrats. Representatives of sixty counties attended the August 2 meeting in Lexington. Resolutions endorsing the Democratic platform from the 1896 Democratic National Convention and the candidacy of William Jennings Bryan in 1900 were adopted. Then, ex-governor Brown addressed the crowd. Finally, the representatives agreed to a nominating convention to be held on August 16.|$|E

5|$|After the January 11 congressional hearing, Ross delayed {{enforcement}} of the FEPC directive to await {{the outcome of the}} upcoming union elections. The PRTEU contract with the PTC was expiring on February 11, 1944 and a union election was called for March 14, 1944. Apart from PRTEU, which was still staunchly opposed to promotions of black employees, there were two other unions competing for the right to represent PTC workers: the Transport Workers Union (TWU), which was a Congress of Industrial Organizations (CIO) affiliate, and the Amalgamated Association of Street and Electric Railway and Motor Coach Employees of America, an American Federation of Labor (AFL) affiliate. The TWU said that it would allow promotions of black employees while the Amalgamated Association stayed silent on the matter. The PRTEU leadership tried to campaign on the race issue during the union elections, but the topic was overshadowed by other issues, such as <b>the</b> <b>details</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> new contract with the PTC. After a bitter campaign, the TWU won the union elections, receiving more votes than both of the other unions combined. At the time of the elections many white workers perceived the contract issue to be more important, where the TWU was promising more attractive terms, and they did not consider promotions of black employees a realistic possibility. Despite the TWU victory, animosities from white workers towards the black employees remained and were largely unabated. The negotiations between the TWU and the PTC on a new contract dragged on, {{and in the absence of}} a contract the company continued to resist implementing the FEPC directives.|$|E
5|$|Bede relates that Paulinus told Edwin {{that the}} birth of his and Æthelburg's {{daughter}} at Easter 626 was because of Paulinus' prayers. The birth coincided with a foiled assassination attempt on the king by a group of West Saxons from Wessex. Edwin promised to convert to Christianity and allow his new daughter Eanflæd to be baptised if he won a victory over Wessex. He did not fulfill his promise immediately after his subsequent military success against the West Saxons however, only converting after Paulinus had revealed <b>the</b> <b>details</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> dream the king had before he took the throne, during his exile at the court of King Rædwald of East Anglia. In this dream, according to Bede, a stranger told Edwin that power would be his in the future when someone laid a hand on his head. As Paulinus was revealing the dream to Edwin, he laid his hand on the king's head, which was the proof Edwin needed. A late seventh-century hagiography of Pope Gregory I claims that Paulinus was the stranger in the vision; if true, it might suggest that Paulinus spent some time at Rædwald's court, although Bede does not mention any such visit.|$|E

40|$|Advances that {{facilitate}} electronic publishing and Commerce also heighten threats {{of intellectual property}} theft and unlawful tampering. One approach {{to address this problem}} involves embedding an invisible structure into a host signal to mark its ownership. These structures are called digital watermarks and the associated embedding process is called digital watermarking. One major driving force for research in this area is the need for effective copyright protection scenarios for digital imagery. In such an application a serial number or a message is embedded into the image to protect and to identify the copyright holder. So the objective of watermarking is authenticity check. In this project the discrete wavelet transform <b>of</b> <b>an</b> image is used which transforms the image into two parts: an approximation part and a detail part. So, using this transformation <b>the</b> <b>details</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> image can be extracted. <b>The</b> control <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>details</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> image permits to identify the invisible ones hence watermark can be inserted by changing only <b>the</b> less important <b>details</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> image. <b>The</b> watermark should survive the image processing techniques like compression etc. This project compresses the image by using two different techniques called HUFFMAN and SPIHT Coding techniques...|$|R

The plan was temporarily called off when it was discovered that the British Army's Parachute Regiment was on patrol that evening in the area. Weir returned to Belfast the next day and the attack went ahead that evening, 8 March. There were no casualties, however, as Mitchell's floor plans had been inaccurate, and the customers had fled into the pub's living quarters for safety once the shooting had commenced outside, and the bomb only caused structural damage to the building.|$|E

500|$|Edward was {{ultimately}} a failure as a king; the historian Michael Prestwich observes that he [...] "was lazy and incompetent, liable to outbursts of temper over unimportant issues, yet indecisive {{when it came}} to major issues", echoed by Roy Haines' description of Edward as [...] "incompetent and vicious", and as [...] "no man of business". Edward did not just delegate routine government to his subordinates, but also higher level decision making, and Pierre Chaplais argues that he [...] "was not so much an incompetent king as a reluctant one", preferring to rule through a powerful deputy, such as Piers Gaveston or Hugh Despenser the Younger. Edward's willingness to promote his favourites had serious political consequences, although he also attempted to buy the loyalty of a wider grouping of nobles through grants of money and fees.
