5|$|During the Chunin Exams, Orochimaru plans the {{invasion}} of Konoha with the ninja of Sunagakure to not only kill Hiruzen but also claim the body of Itachi's brother Sasuke Uchiha. To that end, Orochimaru infiltrated the Chunin Exam's Forest of Death round by killing a Grass ninja named Shiore and assuming his identity to personally test Sasuke before branding him with a Curse Mark once satisfied with the youth's abilities. For {{the duration of the}} Exams, Orochimaru laid in wait and secretly murdered the Fourth Kazekage to assume his identity and get close to his mentor as {{the invasion}} begins. However, Orochimaru is forced to retreat when Hiruzen sacrifices himself through the Reaper Death Seal to take away Orochimaru's ability to perform jutsu with his forces pulling back while Sunagakure later learns of Orochimaru's treachery. Wanting to regain the ability to use jutsu, Orochimaru attempts to get aid from Tsunade before seeking out another way to cure himself. When all his efforts prove unsuccessful, Orochimaru sends his Sound Four to fetch Sasuke, hoping that a body-transfer will allow him to use his arms again. Though he waits as long as he can, Sasuke <b>takes</b> <b>too</b> long to arrive and Orochimaru is forced to switch to the body of one of his prisoners instead. Once Sasuke arrives, Orochimaru decides to train him instead until the day that {{he will be able to}} take the body for himself.|$|E

25|$|However, EMTs {{were neither}} trained nor {{authorised}} to provide definitive care for cardiac arrest. They {{could not provide}} defibrillation; intravenous medications; or advanced airway control, such as endotracheal intubation. EMTs saved few, if any, victims of sudden cardiac arrest, largely because cardiac arrest occurred mostly in people's homes. The time required for EMTs to arrive and transport the patient to the closest emergency department was too long for resuscitation to be successful. Not even letter-perfect CPR can save a life if it <b>takes</b> <b>too</b> long for defibrillation and other advanced procedures to occur.|$|E
25|$|Previous {{games in}} the {{franchise}} have featured brief gameplay segments where the player character is accompanied by non-player character (NPC) companions {{in the form of}} United Nations Space Command (UNSC) Marines, non-human allies like the Arbiter, and other Spartans. Halo 5 also equips the player with a persistent fireteam of NPC Spartans, who are present at all times and can receive limited orders using the Xbox controller. During cooperative play, other players assume control of these Spartans; each Spartan has different gameplay attributes. If any Spartan, player-controlled or not, <b>takes</b> <b>too</b> much damage, they enter an incapacitated state, and a teammate must rush over and revive them before they die.|$|E
25|$|Also {{featured}} during ground-based {{levels is}} a feature known as Survival Mode. This mode is activated when a lion <b>takes</b> <b>too</b> much damage. The player character is {{ejected from the}} cockpit and must survive for 10 seconds while the lion repairs itself. During these sequences the character {{is equipped with a}} blaster and must survive on foot, using the same multi-directional gameplay mechanics as when piloting the lion. Once the 10 seconds have elapsed the player character can re-enter the lion's cockpit and resume normal gameplay. Players can also find collectible items throughout the level which can provide their character with an extra life or additional, temporary features such as enhanced firepower.|$|E

25|$|In early development, {{the queen}} lays eggs and {{takes care of}} larvae. Before the {{emergence}} of workers, the queen is responsible for feeding the brood. To feed developing larvae, the queen captures prey by incapacitation, trims it to an appropriate size for carrying, and brings {{it back to the}} nest to further malaxate the item. Males do not contribute to parental care. In fact, many males solicit liquids from developing larvae. Workers forage for food, capture and malaxate prey, defend territories, and monitor the distribution of resources among larvae. The larvae twitch back and forth in their nests {{to attract the attention of}} the workers and queens. When approached by adults, larvae reach back to expose their heads. If this reaction <b>takes</b> <b>too</b> long, workers give the food to another larvae.|$|E
500|$|Roger Jaynes, {{writing in}} the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel {{described}} A Glorious Way to Die as [...] "a dramatic absorbing account of Yamatos last mission". His only complaint was that the book <b>takes</b> <b>too</b> long to [...] "get into", and that the first 90 pages, most of which deal with background information, should have been heavily condensed. But once [...] "Yamato finally leaves port", Jaynes said the book is [...] "a chilling account of how more than 3,000 Japanese sailors obediently sailed to their deaths, knowing they had no air cover and that the American planes were waiting".|$|E

[...] Jack Zink of the Sun-Sentinel wrote that the film [...] "takes a while to hook you into its story.

500|$|Some critics {{found the}} plot to be a {{conventional}} [...] "unravel-the-secret" [...] and [...] "woman on a quest" [...] thriller. Toby Litt wrote that [...] "udged {{just as a}} thriller, Pattern Recognition <b>takes</b> <b>too</b> long to kickstart, gives its big secrets away before it should and never puts the heroine in believable peril". The conclusion, called [...] "unnecessarily pat" [...] by one critic, was compared by Litt with the [...] "ultimate fantasy ending of 1980s movies – the heroine has lucked out without selling out, has kept her integrity but still ended up filthy rich." [...] The review in the Library Journal called the novel a [...] "melodrama of beset geekdom" [...] that [...] "may well reveal the emptiness {{at the core of}} Gibson's other fiction", but recommended it for all libraries due to the author's popularity.|$|E
500|$|Roger Ebert {{enjoyed the}} film, noting its homages {{to the film}} serials of the 1930s–1950s. Although Ebert cited the visual effects as being state of the art, he {{described}} them [...] "as charmingly direct as those rockets in the Flash Gordon serials—the ones with sparklers hidden inside of them, which were pulled on wires in front of papier-mâché mountains." [...] Leonard Maltin wrote that the [...] "film captures {{the look of the}} '30s, as well as the gee-whiz innocence of Saturday matinée serials, but it's talky and <b>takes</b> <b>too</b> much time to get where it's going. Dalton has fun as a villain patterned after Errol Flynn." [...] Peter Travers of Rolling Stone magazine also gave a positive review. [...] "The Rocketeer is more than one of the best films of the summer; it's the kind of movie magic that we don't see much anymore", he continued, [...] "the kind that charms us, rather than bullying us, into suspending disbelief." ...|$|E
500|$|The player's {{health is}} {{represented}} by a red [...] "Crimson Omen" [...] that fades onto the screen the more damage the player takes; staying {{out of the line}} of fire allows the player to recover their health. Depending on the game mode or difficulty, if the player <b>takes</b> <b>too</b> much damage, they enter a downed state where they can crawl around the map to get out of battle and seek help. During this time, a teammate can revive him, an enemy may brutally execute the downed player, or the player may bleed out if too much time has passed. The player can also grab a downed character and use them as a meatshield, allowing the body to absorb damage but forcing the player to use a one-handed pistol. Explosive weapons will simply destroy the character they strike. Like its predecessor, Gears of War 2 features an optional mature content filter, which, when active, makes blood appear as sparks and removes harsh language from the dialogue. Furthermore, progress towards most of the Xbox achievements for the game can be earned in either campaign or multiplayer modes.|$|E

500|$|The game's {{combat system}} {{is called the}} Stride Cross Battle System. The combat takes place across both screens on the DS, with Neku on the {{touchscreen}} and his partner on the top screen, representing the different [...] "zones" [...] of the same local area; the two characters battle the same enemies that exist in both [...] "zones" [...] simultaneously. Neku and his partner are synchronized during battle; they share the same health bar so that even if one character does not take any damage, the pair can fail in battle if the other <b>takes</b> <b>too</b> much. A green [...] "light puck" [...] will pass between the characters during battle; by alternating battle between the character who possesses the puck, damage is increased. The movement of the light puck {{is determined by the}} [...] "sync ratio" [...] between Neku and his partner; the puck stays longer with the character with higher ratios. The player can equip Neku and his partner with clothing that can alter the light puck's speed. The light puck also has the ability to magnify Neku and his partner's attacks as long as when they hold the puck, they are not attacked by an enemy and can continue this in a volley.|$|E

He also takes in a young boy, Haku, as his apprentice, mostly treating him as a tool although he ultimately does care for him. Zabuza is skilled in water-based abilities, but his area of expertise is in assassinations in areas covered by mist. His talents lead to his commission by a criminal named Gato to kill a man named Tazuna, which he is unable to perform due to interference by Tazuna's bodyguard, Kakashi Hatake. Because he <b>takes</b> <b>too</b> long to complete the task, his contract is revoked, and his employer tries to have Zabuza killed. Having been redeemed by Naruto, Zabuza kills him first, though is mortally wounded and dies soon afterwards. He is one of the shinobi resurrected by Kabuto to fight on the Akatsuki side and is defeated, being sealed during a rematch with Kakashi. In the Japanese anime, his voice actor is Unshō Ishizuka, and his English voice actor is Steven Blum.|$|E
