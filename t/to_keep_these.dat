5|$|Exotic {{species of}} fauna {{such as the}} zebra and quagga mussels and the New Zealand mud snail are {{invasive}} species that can greatly impact fish species. Though the mussel species are not known to be in Wyoming, several surrounding regions have reported them. The New Zealand mud snail {{has been found in}} the Shoshone River east of the forest. Forest managers have established a preventative program to try <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>these</b> species from entering forest waterways.|$|E
5|$|Programming of Dynamic Speech Generating devices {{is usually}} done by augmentative {{communication}} specialists. Specialists {{are required to}} cater {{to the needs of}} the patients because the patients usually choose what kinds of words/ phrases they want. For example, patients use different phrases based on their age, disability, interests, etc. Therefore, content organization is extremely time consuming. Additionally, SGDs are rarely covered by health insurance companies. As a result, resources are very limited with regards to both funding and staffing. Dr. John Costello of Boston Children’s Hospital has been the driving force soliciting donations <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>these</b> program running and well-staffed both within his hospital and in hospitals across the country.|$|E

5|$|The Directive Principles of State Policy, {{embodied}} in Part IV of the Constitution, are directions {{given to the}} state to guide {{the establishment of an}} economic and social democracy, as proposed by the Preamble. They set forth the humanitarian and socialist instructions that were the aim of social revolution envisaged in India by the Constituent Assembly. The state is expected <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>these</b> principles in mind while framing laws and policies, even though they are non-justiciable in nature. The Directive Principles may be classified under the following categories: ideals that the state ought to strive towards achieving; directions for the exercise of legislative and executive power; and rights of the citizens which the State must aim towards securing.|$|E
5|$|While US 6 {{was also}} one of the {{original}} 1926 U.S. Highways, the road originally served the portion of the United States east of the Rocky Mountains. The highway was not extended to the Pacific coast until 1937, mostly following the Midland Trail. Around the time the U.S. Highway system was formed, the portion of the Midland Trail through Glenwood Canyon, known as the Taylor State Road, was destroyed by a flood. When US6 was extended, the Works Progress Administration was rebuilding the road through the canyon and the Public Works Administration was nearing completion of a new highway over Vail Pass. In western Colorado, US6 was routed concurrent with US50 from the Utah state line to Grand Junction and eventually replaced US24 from Grand Junction to near Vail. <b>To</b> <b>keep</b> <b>these</b> routes over the Rockies competitive with alternatives in other states, the Colorado Department of Highways relied on ingenuity to keep the roads safe. The department pioneered new machines to clear snow and various bridge and culvert designs to protect the roads from flooding.|$|E

25|$|Several {{nutrient}} cycles {{are important}} in the aquarium. Dissolved oxygen enters the system at the surface water-air interface. Similarly, carbon dioxide escapes the system into the air. The phosphate cycle is an important, although often overlooked, nutrient cycle. Sulfur, iron, and micronutrients also cycle through the system, entering as food and exiting as waste. Appropriate handling of the nitrogen cycle, along with supplying an adequately balanced food supply and considered biological loading, is enough <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>these</b> other nutrient cycles in approximate equilibrium.|$|E

Initially, she attempts <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>these</b> feelings to herself, but the orchestra reveals her increasing inner thoughts.

25|$|A {{legislative}} council for Southern Rhodesia {{was created in}} 1898 to advise the BSAC Administrator and the High Commissioner for South Africa on legal matters. Initially, this had a minority of elected seats, and the electorate was formed almost exclusively of those better-off white settlers who held BSAC shares. Over time as more settlers arrived, disputes between settlers and BSAC grew, and the company attempted <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>these</b> in check by extending the franchise to some non-shareholders. However, in 1914, the Royal Charter was renewed on condition that settlers in Southern Rhodesia were given increased political rights, and from 1914, there was an elected majority on the Southern Rhodesian Legislative Council.|$|E

The soldiers were held in barracks, and they were used as workers for agriculture and industry, except for officers who were not compelled to participate in forced labour and stayed in unoccupied mountain hotels, mainly in Davos.|$|E
25|$|The {{deletion}} {{of parts}} on a vehicle {{is an easy}} way for designers and vehicle owners to reduce parasitic and frontal drag of the vehicle with little cost and effort. Deletion {{can be as simple}} as removing an aftermarket part, or part that has been installed on the vehicle after production, or having to modify and remove an OEM part, meaning any part of the vehicle that was originally manufactured on the vehicle. Most production sports cars and high efficiency vehicles come standard with many of these deletions in order to be competitive in the automotive and race market, while others choose <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>these</b> drag-increasing aspects of the vehicle for their visual aspects, or to fit the typical uses of their customer base.|$|E

Bamford agreed to the proposal that he should operate between the top of King Street and the Crown Inn on Carlton Road, via Coalpit Lane (later Cranbrook Street), on a 20-minute frequency at a fixed charge of 9d. per mile; receipts were collected by a Corporation conductor, but the driver was provided by Bamford’s. The last day of motorbus operation was 15 June. After withdrawal, two of the vehicles were converted into tower waggons.|$|E

25|$|This {{species of}} wasp is not {{particularly}} aggressive. When a young nest is disturbed the foundress will first place her head at the entrance in an alert position. Then she flies quickly around the nest and may fall suddenly to the ground. This falling to the ground has only been observed in Dolichovespula species and its purpose is unclear. When small insects such as ants or spiders crawl on the nest the wasp responds by grabbing them in her mandibles and dropping to the ground. It is usually not necessary for her to try <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>these</b> insects out of the nest as they are rarely seen to try and enter. Once there are some workers in a young nest the queen and workers cooperate to defend it.|$|E
25|$|Every legion {{had a large}} baggage train, which {{included}} 640 mules (1 mule for every 8 legionaries) just for the soldiers' equipment. <b>To</b> <b>keep</b> <b>these</b> baggage trains from becoming too large and slow, Marius had each infantryman carry as much of his own equipment as he could, including his own armour, weapons and 15 days' rations, for about 25–30kg (50–60 pounds) of load total. To make this easier, he issued each legionary a cross stick to carry their loads on their shoulders. The soldiers were nicknamed Marius' Mules because {{of the amount of}} gear they had to carry themselves. This arrangement allowed for the possibility for the supply train to become temporarily detached from {{the main body of the}} legion, thus greatly increasing the army's speed when needed.|$|E
25|$|While {{it is not}} {{normally}} legal <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>these</b> chameleons, {{it is possible to}} obtain special permission from the South African government to do so. These chameleons are better admired than handled. However, taming is possible through gentle and consistent (almost daily) contact, allowing trust to build up. This is typically achieved through careful and slow hand-based feeding of flies, small spiders, grasshoppers, etc. In cold weather, a sensitively handled B. pumilum commonly becomes eager to perch on a human hand for the warmth. To maintain them out of their natural environment requires advanced skills and is a demanding project; they require the right amount and type of ultraviolet exposure and large supplies of specific types of live food that are not easy to supply. They also require moisture, even just tap water sprayed gently onto the foliage with a hose.|$|E
