We present an infrastructure for measuring the precise energy used by a mobile browser <b>to</b> <b>render</b> web pages. We then measure the energy needed <b>to</b> <b>render</b> financial, e-commerce, email, blogging, news and social networking sites. Our tools are sufficiently precise to measure the energy needed <b>to</b> <b>render</b> individual web elements, such as cascade style sheets (CSS), Javascript, images, and plug-in objects. Our results show that for popular sites, downloading and parsing cascade style sheets and Javascript consumes a significant fraction of the total energy needed <b>to</b> <b>render</b> the page. Using the data we collected we make concrete recommendations on how to design web pages so as to minimize the energy needed <b>to</b> <b>render</b> the page. As an example, by modifying scripts on the Wikipedia mobile site we reduced by 30 % the energy needed <b>to</b> download and <b>render</b> Wikipedia pages with no change to the user experience. We conclude by estimating the point at which offloading browser computations to a remote proxy can save energy on the phone...|$|R
