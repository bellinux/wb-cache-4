5|$|The town {{is close}} <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>site</b> <b>of</b> the Radstock rail accident, a rail crash {{that took place}} on the Somerset and Dorset Joint Railway, on 7 August 1876. Two trains {{collided}} on a single track section, resulting in the deaths of 15passengers.|$|E
5|$|At {{least six}} of the twelve {{proteins}} encoded by the rotavirus genome bind RNA. The role of these proteins play in rotavirus replication is not entirely understood; their functions {{are thought to be}} related to RNA synthesis and packaging in the virion, mRNA transport <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>site</b> <b>of</b> genome replication, and mRNA translation and regulation of gene expression.|$|E
5|$|Brain damage, {{or disease}} of the brain can {{manifest}} {{in a wide variety}} of ways. Traumatic brain injury, for example in contact sport, after a fall, or in traffic or work accidents, can be associated with both immediate and longer-term problems. Immediate problems that develop may include bleeding within the skull, compressing the brain tissue or damaging its blood supply, skull fractures, injury to a particular area, deafness, and concussion. In addition <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>site</b> <b>of</b> injury, the opposite side of the brain may be affected, termed a contrecoup injury. Longer-term issues that may develop include post-traumatic stress, hydrocephalus, and chronic traumatic encephalopathy.|$|E

50|$|Electroacupuncture: Electrical {{stimulation}} at an acupuncture point. This may by {{given on}} {{or through the}} surface of the skin. Various combinations of acupuncture points can be selected to induce electropuncture analgesia in animals. Generally, analgesia is achieved near <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>sites</b> <b>of</b> electropuncture.|$|R
5|$|By 1721, the Baptist {{community}} in Taunton had grown large, and reasonably affluent. They {{built a new}} chapel, funded entirely by the congregation, very near <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>site</b> <b>of</b> the original Meeting House. The pastor of the church {{at the time was}} Joseph Jeffries, and during his ministry the church transitioned from a Baptist church to Unitarianism.|$|E
5|$|Common ravens {{have been}} {{observed}} calling wolves <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>site</b> <b>of</b> dead animals. The wolves open the carcass, leaving the scraps more accessible to the birds. They watch where other common ravens bury their food and remember the locations of each other's food caches, so they can steal from them. This type of theft occurs so regularly that common ravens will fly extra distances from a food source to find better hiding places for food. They have also been observed pretending to make a cache without actually depositing the food, presumably to confuse onlookers.|$|E
5|$|Gordon was {{inspired}} to write the episode after walking down the streets of New York and seeing several stone gargoyles on the corner, staring at him. Gordon developed the concept with series creator Chris Carter, who suggested the addition of more psychological aspects to the episode. Originally, the teaser was planned to be filmed at a Catholic hospital, but the shot was relocated <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>site</b> <b>of</b> a historic post office after concerns were raised about attaching a fake gargoyle to the building.|$|E

30|$|Finally, {{we showed}} that GM-CSF may {{regulate}} the homing molecules CCR 2 and CCR 6 on human monocytes [14], which are involved in regulating several aspects of mucosal immunity, including <b>the</b> ability <b>to</b> mediate <b>the</b> recruitment of innate immune cells <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>sites</b> <b>of</b> epithelial inflammation.|$|R
25|$|However, this {{analysis}} showed that the clays did not originate anywhere near <b>the</b> <b>site</b> <b>of</b> Enkomi and that suitable clays are close <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>sites</b> <b>of</b> Kalavasos and Alassa (itself a possible cognate <b>of</b> Alashiya). These <b>sites,</b> especially Kalavasos, were also important Late Bronze Age sites and are located close to sources of copper.|$|R
5|$|In medieval times, {{the wool}} trade was {{important}} in the town's economy, although this declined in the 18th century {{to be replaced by}} other industries such as brewing; the town continues to be a major centre for the production of cider. Shepton Mallet is the closest town <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>site</b> <b>of</b> the Glastonbury Festival, the largest music festival in Europe. Also nearby is the Royal Bath and West of England Society showground which hosts the Royal Bath and West Show, and other major shows and festivals.|$|E
5|$|Soon {{after the}} attack, {{hundreds}} of policemen and army forces personnel and two {{armored personnel carriers}} were brought into Yerevan, positioned on Baghramyan Avenue surrounding the National Assembly building. An anti-terrorist squad from Russia also participated in the operation. Meanwhile, ambulance vehicles rushed <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>site</b> <b>of</b> the shooting. President Robert Kocharyan was directing {{the operation of the}} security forces around the parliament building. While holding around 50 hostages inside the building, the men demanded a helicopter and airtime on national television for a political statement.|$|E
5|$|That {{night the}} {{regiment}} bivouacked at Katib Gannit and returned <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>site</b> <b>of</b> the battle the next day, 6 August, but the Turkish army had withdrawn eastwards. The brigade {{was ordered to}} advance until contact was regained with the Turkish force, which they located around 12:00, {{to the east of}} Oghratina. The regiment remained in contact all day, without suffering any casualties. They also located a telephone wire that the withdrawing Turks had failed to disconnect, enabling them to monitor the German and Turkish command issuing orders.|$|E
50|$|Individuals with LAD {{suffer from}} {{bacterial}} infections {{beginning in the}} neonatal period. Infections such as omphalitis, pneumonia, gingivitis, and peritonitis are common and often life-threatening due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> infant's inability <b>to</b> properly destroy <b>the</b> invading pathogens. These individuals do not form abscesses because granulocytes cannot migrate <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>sites</b> <b>of</b> infection.|$|R

5|$|The Court of Claims {{looked at}} whether the tribe had {{hunting and fishing}} rights and drew the same {{conclusion}} as the Wisconsin Supreme Court—that {{the terms of the}} treaty had to be resolved in the favor of the tribe, citing The Menominee Tribe of Indians v. United States, 95 Ct.Cl. 232 (Ct.Cl., 1941). In that decision, the Court of Claims had observed that the reason the tribe had agreed <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>site</b> <b>of</b> the reservation was that it was well suited for hunting, with plenty of game. The hunting rights by treaty were therefore confirmed.|$|E
5|$|The Medway long barrows all {{conformed}} {{to the same}} general design plan, and are all aligned on an east to west axis. Each had a stone chamber at {{the eastern end of}} the mound, and they each probably had a stone facade flanking the entrance. The chambers were constructed from sarsen, a dense, hard, and durable stone that occurs naturally throughout Kent, having formed out of silicified sand from the Eocene epoch. Early Neolithic builders would have selected blocks from the local area, and then transported them <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>site</b> <b>of</b> the monument to be erected.|$|E
5|$|The hospital's {{design was}} criticised for not {{providing}} {{space for the}} storage of medical files. It was expected that all files would be stored electronically within five years. In the meantime, the paper medical files were transferred <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>site</b> <b>of</b> the old Falkirk Royal Infirmary. An old X-ray department at the hospital was decontaminated and converted into a storage department {{at a cost of}} £40,000, and a taxi company was contracted to move the records between sites.|$|E

5|$|The name Gallox is {{believed}} to be derived from gallows as the village gallows were nearby, when it was called Gallocksbrigge. The bridge is close to Dunster Working Watermill and the base of the hill on which Dunster Castle sits and povides access <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>site</b> <b>of</b> the Deer park. It also falls within the Dunster Conservation Area. It has been in the guardianship of English Heritage since the 1950s.|$|E
5|$|The railroad's Purdy's {{station is}} a short {{distance}} west of the next junction, NY116, after which NY22 crosses under I-684, remaining {{between it and the}} railroad tracks. Turning left onto Hardscrabble Road, it follows the tracks away from the interstate <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>site</b> <b>of</b> the next station, North Salem's hamlet of Croton Falls. Just north of the hamlet, Route22 crosses under the tracks, and is joined by US202. Immediately afterward, the road crosses back under the railroad again and enters Putnam County, following the Croton River north past the spillway of East Branch Reservoir.|$|E
5|$|The six {{survivors}} {{buried the}} bodies {{found on the}} beach, then travelled east along the beach, expecting to reach Cape Town. However, after {{four and a half}} days, they realised their error and returned <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>site</b> <b>of</b> the wreck. Here they subsisted off a cask of oatmeal, while trying to effect repairs to the ship's pinnace, which had been washed ashore. They were discovered six days later on 14 June by a farmer's son, who was out hunting.|$|E

40|$|The {{ability of}} the {{lymphocyte}} cultured in vitro to transform and synthesize deoxyribonucleic has been utilized <b>to</b> locate <b>the</b> <b>site</b> <b>of</b> action of a new antimetabolite 6 -azauridine which acts by inhibiting nucleic acid synthesis. <b>The</b> exact <b>site</b> can be demonstrated by incorporating into the cultures nucleotides occurring distal and proximal <b>to</b> <b>the</b> presumed <b>site</b> <b>of</b> action of 6 -azauridine...|$|R
5|$|When {{neutrophils}} {{release their}} granule contents in the kidney, {{the contents of}} the granule (reactive oxygen compounds and proteases) degrade the extracellular matrix of host cells and can cause damage to glomerular cells, affecting their ability to filter blood and causing changes in shape. In addition, phospholipase products (e.g., leukotrienes) intensify the damage. This release of substances promotes chemotaxis of more neutrophils <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>site</b> <b>of</b> infection, and glomerular cells can be damaged further by the adhesion molecules during the migration of neutrophils. The injury done to the glomerular cells can cause renal failure.|$|E
5|$|By 8:30 am {{a request}} went out {{summoning}} all available tugs <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>site</b> <b>of</b> the grounding {{with the hope}} that {{they would be able to}} free the leviathan before any further damage occurred. An attempt made by Missouris sailors on the day of the grounding met with failure, as did an initial attempt to pull Missouri back into deep water with sixteen tugboats. Before the tugs could lend any further assistance, the naval brass postponed the attempt, pending the outcome of further assessment. Missouri had traversed the shoal nearly 2,500 feet, and to compound her problem she had run aground during an unusually high tide. To add insult to injury, she had become the butt of a number of bad jokes among the American public, the Navy's rival service branches, and the Soviet Union's Atlantic fleet, who were quick to pounce upon the dreadnought's grounding as material for the naval publication Red Fleet.|$|E
5|$|Currently, {{there are}} four sites in Slovenia inscribed on the list and five sites on the {{tentative}} list. The first site in Slovenia {{to be added to}} the list was the Škocjan Caves, inscribed at the 10th UNESCO session in 1986. In the 2010s, three more sites were inscribed, all of them transnational entries: pile dwellings at Ig, part of the Prehistoric pile dwellings around the Alps transnational site, in 2011, Idrija, as part of the transnational site Heritage of Mercury. Almadén and Idrija, in 2012, and two forest reserves, Krokar and Snežnik – Ždrocle Virgin Forests in 2017, as a part of the extension <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>site</b> <b>of</b> Primeval Beech Forests of the Carpathians and the Ancient Beech Forests of Germany. Of these four sites, Škocjan Caves and the Primeval Beech Forests are natural sites while the other two are cultural sites, as determined by the organization's selection criteria.|$|E
