40|$|In {{this paper}} we study {{the sources of}} wage growth. We {{identify}} the contribution to such growth of general, sector specific and firm specific human capital. Our results are interpretable {{within the context of}} a model where the <b>returns</b> <b>to</b> human capital may be heterogeneous and where firms may offer different combinations of entry level wages and firm specific human capital development. We allow for the possibility that wages are match specific and that workers move jobs as a result of identifying a better match. To estimate the average <b>returns</b> <b>to</b> experience, sector tenure and firm specific tenure within this context, we develop an identification strategy which relies on the use of firm closures. Our data source is a new and unique administrative data-set for Germany that includes complete work histories as well as individual characteristics. We find positive <b>returns</b> <b>to</b> experience and firm tenure for skilled workers. The <b>returns</b> <b>to</b> experience for unskilled workers are small and insignificant after 2 years of experience. <b>Their</b> <b>returns</b> <b>to</b> sector tenure are also zero. However, <b>their</b> <b>returns</b> <b>to</b> firm tenure are substantial. 1...|$|R
5|$|Typical {{adult male}} ruffs start to moult {{into the main}} display plumage before <b>their</b> <b>return</b> <b>to</b> the {{breeding}} areas, {{and the proportion of}} birds with head and neck decorations gradually increases through the spring. Second-year birds lag behind full adults in developing breeding plumage. They have a lower body mass and a slower weight increase than full adults, and perhaps the demands made on their energy reserves during the migration flight are the main reason of the delayed moult.|$|E
