Despite their sometimes antiquarian terminology, these texts form <b>the</b> <b>basis</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> knowledge on Byzantine naval affairs. The main surviving texts are the chapters on sea combat (peri naumachias) in the Tactica of Leo the Wise and Nikephoros Ouranos (both drawing extensively from the Naumachiai of Syrianos Magistros and other earlier works), complemented by relevant passages in the De Administrando Imperio of Constantine Porphyrogennetos and other works by Byzantine and Arab writers.|$|E
25|$|The {{notion of}} {{causation}} is {{closely linked to}} the problem of induction. According to Hume, we reason inductively by associating constantly conjoined events. It is the mental act of association that is <b>the</b> <b>basis</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> concept of causation. There are at least three interpretations of Hume's theory of causation represented in the literature: (1) the logical positivist; (2) the sceptical realist; and (3) the quasi-realist.|$|E
25|$|Yang–Mills {{theory is}} a gauge theory {{based on the}} SU(N) group, or more {{generally}} any compact, reductive Lie algebra. Yang–Mills theory seeks to describe the behavior of elementary particles using these non-Abelian Lie groups and {{is at the core}} of the unification of the electromagnetic and weak forces (i.e. U(1) × SU(2)) as well as quantum chromodynamics, the theory of the strong force (based on SU(3)). Thus it forms <b>the</b> <b>basis</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> understanding of the Standard Model of particle physics.|$|E

25|$|As an example, {{suppose that}} {{light in the}} orange range of {{wavelengths}} (approximately 577nm to 597nm) enters the eye and strikes the retina. Light of these wavelengths would activate both the medium and long wavelength cones of the retina, but not equally—the long-wavelength cells will respond more. The difference in the response can be detected by the brain, and this difference is <b>the</b> <b>basis</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> perception of orange. Thus, the orange appearance of an object results from light from the object entering our eye and stimulating the different cones simultaneously but to different degrees.|$|E
500|$|The Pentecostal Holiness Church {{believes}} {{that no amount}} of good works can achieve justification or salvation. This is achieved only [...] "on <b>the</b> <b>basis</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> faith in the shed blood, the resurrection, and the justifying righteousness" [...] of Christ. Good works, however, are a product of salvation. [...] "When we believe on Jesus Christ as our Savior, our sins are pardoned, we are justified, and we enter a state of righteousness, not our own, but His, both imputed and imparted".|$|E
500|$|The social {{implications}} {{of the theory of}} evolution by natural selection also became the source of continuing controversy. Friedrich Engels, a German political philosopher and co-originator of the ideology of communism, wrote in 1872 that [...] "Darwin did not know what a bitter satire he wrote on mankind, and especially on his countrymen, when he showed that free competition, the struggle for existence, which the economists celebrate as the highest historical achievement, is the normal state of the animal kingdom." [...] Herbert Spencer and the eugenics advocate Francis Galton's interpretation of natural selection as necessarily progressive, leading to supposed advances in intelligence and civilisation, became a justification for colonialism, eugenics, and social Darwinism. For example, in 1940, Konrad Lorenz, in writings that he subsequently disowned, used the theory as a justification for policies of the Nazi state. He wrote [...] "...selection for toughness, heroism, and social utility... must be accomplished by some human institution, if mankind, in default of selective factors, is not to be ruined by domestication-induced degeneracy. The racial idea as <b>the</b> <b>basis</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> state has already accomplished much in this respect." [...] Others have developed ideas that human societies and culture evolve by mechanisms analogous to those that apply to evolution of species.|$|E

2500|$|Joel Migdal of the University of Washington {{believes}} weak postcolonial {{states have}} issues rooted in civil society. Rather than seeing {{the state as}} a singular dominant entity, Migdal describes “weblike societies” composed of social organizations. These organizations are a melange of ethnic, cultural, local, and familial groups and they form <b>the</b> <b>basis</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> society. The state is simply one actor in a much larger framework. Strong states are able to effectively navigate the intricate societal framework and exert social control over people’s behavior. Weak states, on the other hand, are lost amongst the fractionalized authority of [...] a complex society.|$|E

2500|$|British art {{historian}} Kenneth Clark wrote that Western Europe's first [...] "great age of civilisation" [...] {{was ready to}} begin around the year 1000.

Abbot Suger of the Abbey of St. Denis is considered an influential early patron of Gothic architecture and believed that love of beauty brought people closer to God: [...] "The dull mind rises to truth through that which is material". Clarke calls this [...] "the intellectual background of all the sublime works of art of the next century and in fact has remained <b>the</b> <b>basis</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> belief of the value of art until today".|$|E

2500|$|The most {{important}} model systems in plant development have been arabidopsis and maize.

The genomes of Arabidopsis thaliana and rice have been completely sequenced, while the others are in process.

While Brassica has been used primarily because of its convenient location in the phylogenetic tree in the mustard family, Antirrhinum majus is a convenient system for studying leaf architecture. Rice has been traditionally used for studying responses to hormones like abscissic acid and gibberelin as well as responses to stress. However, recently, not just the domesticated rice strain, but also the wild strains have been studied for their underlying genetic architectures.|$|E
2500|$|While Schiller's will {{to believe}} is a central theme of Riddle of the Sphinx (appearing mainly in the {{introduction}} and conclusion of his text), in 1891 the doctrine held a limited role in Schiller's philosophy. In Riddles, Schiller only employs {{his version of the}} will to believe doctrine when he is faced with overcoming sceptic and pessimistic methods of philosophy. In 1897, William James published his essay [...] "The Will to Believe" [...] and this influenced Schiller to drastically expanded his application of the doctrine. For a 1903 volume titled Personal Idealism, Schiller contributed a widely read essay titled [...] "Axioms as Postulates" [...] in which he sets out to justify the [...] "axioms of logic" [...] as postulates adopted {{on the basis of the}} will to believe doctrine. In this essay Schiller extends the will to believe doctrine to be <b>the</b> <b>basis</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> acceptance of causality, of the uniformity of nature, of our concept of identity, of contradiction, of the law of excluded middle, of space and time, of the goodness of God, and more.
