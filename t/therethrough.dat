6000|$|So the esquire mounted {{his horse}} again and drave away with all speed and Sir Gareth set spurs to {{his horse and}} also drave away at speed, and Lynette and the dwarf {{followed}} with speed after Sir Gareth. So anon they entered the forest and coursed <b>therethrough</b> for a little ways and then Sir Gareth perceived where at a short distance there was a knight set with his back against a tree defending himself against six great and brawny villains clad in full armor. And Sir Gareth beheld that there were three other villains who lay dead upon the ground, but that the knight was in a sorry case, bleeding from several wounds and very weary with his battle. Thereupon, beholding this, Sir Gareth drew his sword and cried out in a very loud voice: [...] "Have at ye, villains! Have at ye!" [...] and therewith drave into the midst of that contest. And the thieves were astonished at the violence of his coming so that they knew not what to do, for Sir Gareth drave into their midst without let or pause of any sort. And ere they recovered from their astonishment, Sir Gareth struck one of the villains to the earth at a single blow and then he smote down another.
