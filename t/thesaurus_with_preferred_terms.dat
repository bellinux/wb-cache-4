40|$|Objective. To {{provide a}} semantics-based method {{to assist the}} {{translation}} of SNOMED CT into French. To do so, we selected four French-language terminologies: ICD- 10, SNOMED International, MedDRA, MeSH, as they are dedicated to different uses – epidemiology, clinical medicine, adverse reactions, medical literature, respectively – in order to map them to SNOMED Clinical Terms (CT), and thus associate French terms with SNOMED CT concepts. In this way, we measured the number of SNOMED CT concepts {{to be found in}} French-language terminologies. Material and Method. We used the UMLS Metathesaurus. The mapping method was based on the coincidence of identifiers and on the explicit mappings present in the Metathesaurus. Results. The study dealt exclusively <b>with</b> <b>preferred</b> <b>terms</b> (PTs) in the terminologies. The terminologies are mapped with varying success as regards PTs mapped to SNOMED terms (from 52 % to 96 %). Conversely, 45 % of SNOMED CT terms are mapped by uniting the four terminologies. Discussion. A more effective mapping technique than the current method is under consideration. Conclusion. The method presented will be refined. It could certainly provide useful assistance in the translation of SNOMED CT into French. Due to its general nature, it could be used to translate SNOMED CT into other languages than French...|$|R

40|$|Working <b>with</b> a new <b>thesaurus</b> {{dictionary}} {{that contains}} multi-level hierarchy such as MedDRA {{can be a}} challenge.

An example of a hyperlinked dictionary view will also show {{how easy it is to}} navigate the hierarchy of terms. Innovative use of email integration demonstrates how the tool communicates with the users.

40|$|Abstract of Background Paper: Background: While {{documentation}} of clinical aspects of General Practice/Family Medicine (GP/FM) is assured by the International Classification of Primary Care (ICPC), {{there is no}} taxonomy for the professional aspects (context and management) of GP/FM. Aim: To present the development, dissemination, applications, and resulting face validity of the Q-Codes taxonomy specifically designed to describe contextual features of GP/FM, proposed as an extension to the ICPC Development: The Q-Codes taxonomy was developed from Lamberts’ seminal idea for indexing contextual content (1987) by a multi-disciplinary team of knowledge engineers, linguists and general practitioners, through a qualitative and iterative analysis of 1702 abstracts from six GP/FM conferences using Atlas. ti software. A total of 182 concepts, called Q-codes, representing professional aspects of GP/FM, were identified and organised in a taxonomy. Dissemination: The taxonomy is published as an on-line terminological resource, using semantic web techniques and Web ontology language (OWL) (www. hetop. eu/Q). Each Q-code is identified with an Unique Resource Identifier (URI), and provided <b>with</b> <b>preferred</b> <b>terms,</b> formal definitions in eight languages (pt, es, en, fr, nl, ko, vi, tr) and search filters for Medline and web searches. Applications.. This taxonomy has already been used to support queries in bibliographic databases (e. g. Medline), to facilitate indexing of grey literature in GP/FM as congress abstracts, master theses, websites and as an educational tool in vocational teaching, Conclusions: The rapidly growing list of practical applications provides face-validity for the usefulness of this freely available new terminological resource.

40|$|Almost 16 {{years since}} the {{publishing}} of Terminologia Anatomica (TA) by the Federative Committee on Anatomical Terminology (FCAT), there {{has yet to be}} a unified adoption of TA-recommended anatomical terms by anatomists. A survey was sent to members of the American Association of Clinical Anatomists (AACA) to determine the frequency of TA term usage. Most respondents (70. 3 %) received their terminal degrees in anatomy, with 23. 4 % in clinical and anthropological areas. Academically ranked, most respondents were professors (38. 4 %) and most were from North America (81. 1 %). Almost 40 % of respondents were textbook authors. Overall results indicate that the TA <b>preferred</b> <b>term</b> had the highest frequency of usage in only 53 % of the anatomical structures/features surveyed. Compliance <b>with</b> TA <b>preferred</b> <b>terms</b> ranged from 98. 2 % to 3. 6 % usage. Almost 25 % of AACA anatomists were not familiar with the FCAT and over 75 % were concerned about synonymity in anatomical terminology. Data demonstrates that clinical anatomists of the AACA are not consistent in how they use anatomical terminology, as well as how they conform to TA terminology...|$|R
25|$|In September 1911, Vanagaitis started {{publishing}} journal Birutė which began {{using the term}} Lithuania Minor more often, competing <b>with</b> previous <b>preferred</b> <b>term</b> Prussian Lithuania. This reflected {{a shift in the}} understanding of the term Lithuania. The society early on adopted the green–white–red flag that was historically used in the region (its origins are unknown); the flag eventually became the flag of Lithuania Minor. While the society promoted events and symbols from the history of the Grand Duchy of Lithuania (such as the struggles against the Teutonic Order during the Lithuanian Crusade or the image of Grand Duke Vytautas as the great leader), it remained politically loyal to the German Empire. Birutė provided the first alternative to the historical memory promoted by the German Empire or the Church. Prussian Lithuanians knew more about the House of Hohenzollern and Margraviate of Brandenburg than about the Grand Duchy of Lithuania. It was an early attempt at finding own distinctive history and identity, which was continued by other organizations. While Birutė was plagued by lack of leadership and internal disagreements, its amateur concerts and theater performances sought to prove that the Lithuanian language was viable and equal to other languages.|$|R

40|$|In {{this study}} {{detection}} of association between drugs and Adverse Drug Reactions (ADRs), {{is carried out}} by using Naive Bayes method. Adverse event reports submitted to the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) were reviewed to find top 10 drugs causing frequent ADRs for a particular period. The main objective {{of this paper is}} to evaluate drugs associated with list of outcomes provided by FDA.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Idiosyncratic drug {{reactions}} such as hepatotoxicity {{and blood}} dyscrasias represent {{one of the}} major causes of drug withdrawal from the market. According to the reactive metabolite (RM) concept, {{this may be due to}} the metabolic activation of structural alerts (SAs), functionalities in the drug molecule that are susceptible to bioactivation resulting in RMs. The relationship, however, between metabolic activation of SAs in drugs with in vivo toxicity measured as disproportionate reporting of adverse drug reactions (ADRs) to the WHO VigiBase™ database has never been studied. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to investigate whether reported associations of hepatotoxicity between NSAIDs with SAs and NSAIDs with mitigated SAs are disproportionately present in the ADR reporting VigiBase™ database of the WHO collaborating center (the Uppsala Monitoring Centre). The extent of disproportionality of these associations is compared with associations of NSAIDs and hemorrhage, an ADR not associated with the forming of RMs. METHODS: We calculated the reporting odds ratios for five NSAIDs [bromfenac (withdrawn), lumiracoxib (withdrawn), diclofenac, ibuprofen, and naproxen] associated <b>with</b> the MedDRA <b>preferred</b> terms: hepatic failure, hepatic function abnormal, hepatic necrosis, and hepatitis. The disproportionality of the association of these ADRs is compared <b>with</b> the <b>preferred</b> <b>term</b> hemorrhage. RESULTS: The results show that hepatotoxicity is more disproportionately reported in the WHO database for NSAIDs with SAs (bromfenac, lumiracoxib, diclofenac) than for NSAIDs where SAs are mitigated (ibuprofen and naproxen). This difference in reporting between NSAIDs with SAs and with mitigated SAs is not observed for the ADR hemorrhage, an ADR not associated with the forming of RMs. CONCLUSIONS: This study shows that although spontaneous reports have many limitations, the findings are in line with previous research on the reactive metabolite concept. Whether SAs and the number of SAs in the NSAIDs actually play a role in the observed hepatotoxicity must be investigated in future studies...|$|R
