5|$|Although the IPA offers over 160 symbols for transcribing speech, only a {{relatively}} small subset of these {{will be used to}} transcribe any one language. It is possible to transcribe speech with various levels of precision. A precise phonetic transcription, in which sounds are described in a great deal of detail, is known as a narrow transcription. A coarser transcription which ignores some of this detail is called a broad transcription. Both are relative terms, and both are generally enclosed in square brackets. Broad phonetic transcriptions may restrict themselves to easily heard details, or only to details <b>that</b> <b>are</b> <b>relevant</b> <b>to</b> the discussion at hand, and may differ little if at all from phonemic transcriptions, but they make no theoretical claim that all the distinctions transcribed are necessarily meaningful in the language.|$|E
5|$|Expanding {{and moving}} out of their {{homeland}} in Scandinavia and northern Germany, the Germanic peoples had lived in today's Poland for several centuries, during which period many of their tribes also migrated out in the southern and eastern directions (see Wielbark culture). With {{the expansion of the}} Roman Empire, the Germanic tribes came under the Roman cultural influence. Some written remarks by Roman authors <b>that</b> <b>are</b> <b>relevant</b> <b>to</b> the developments on Polish lands have been preserved; they provide additional insight when compared with the archeological record. In the end, as the Roman Empire was nearing its collapse and the nomadic peoples invading from the east destroyed, damaged or destabilized the various Germanic cultures and societies, the Germanic people left eastern and central Europe for the safer and wealthier southern and western parts of the European continent.|$|E

25|$|As was {{indicated}} in the ex parte Fewings case, considerations <b>that</b> <b>are</b> <b>relevant</b> <b>to</b> a public authority's decision are of two kinds: there are mandatory relevant considerations (that is, considerations that the statute empowering the authority expressly or impliedly identifies as those that {{must be taken into}} account), and discretionary relevant considerations (those which the authority may take into account if it regards them as appropriate). Vasiliou v. Secretary of State for Transport (1991) {{is an example of a}} case in which a court found that a particular mandatory relevant consideration was to be implied into a statute. The Court of Appeal of England and Wales held that the Secretary of State for Transport had failed to take into account the fact that an order to close off a particular street for redevelopment would have caused the applicant a substantial loss of business.|$|E
25|$|If, in the {{exercise}} of its discretion on a public duty, an authority takes into account considerations which the courts consider not to be proper, then {{in the eyes of the}} law it has not exercised its discretion legally. On the other hand, considerations <b>that</b> <b>are</b> <b>relevant</b> <b>to</b> a public authority's decision are of two kinds: there are mandatory relevant considerations (that is, considerations that the statute empowering the authority expressly or impliedly identifies as those that must be taken into account), and discretionary relevant considerations (those which the authority may take into account if it regards them as appropriate). If a decision-maker has determined that a particular consideration is relevant to its decision, it is entitled to attribute to it whatever weight it thinks fit, and the courts will not interfere unless it has acted in a Wednesbury-unreasonable manner. This is consistent with the principle that the courts are generally only concerned with the legality of decisions and not their merits.|$|E

500|$|Good slotted {{lines are}} {{precision}} made instruments. [...] They {{need to be}} because mechanical defects can affect accuracy. [...] Some of the mechanical issues <b>that</b> <b>are</b> <b>relevant</b> <b>to</b> this include backlash of the vernier, concentricity of {{the inner and outer}} conductor, circularity of the outer conductor, centrality and straightness of the inner conductor, variations in cross-section, and the ability of the carriage to maintain a constant probe depth. [...] Issues with probe tuning and disturbances to the field have already been discussed, but the insulated spacers holding the centre conductor in place can also disturb the field. [...] Consequently, these are made as discrete as is compatible with mechanical strength. [...] However, the greatest source of inaccuracy is usually not the slotted line itself, but the characteristics of the detector diode.|$|E
500|$|Some animals may assess rivals through {{specific}} characteristics <b>that</b> <b>are</b> <b>relevant</b> <b>to</b> their fighting abilities; however, some animals, instead, use conventional {{characteristics to}} determine the competitive ability of their rivals. Conventional characteristics are signals that are indicative of the rival’s abilities but are not {{a reflection of the}} animal’s physiological or physical agonistic abilities. Polistes exclamans uses facial patterns as a conventional characteristic {{to determine the}} agonistic abilities of competitive rivals. Larger wasps have a greater amount of brown pigmented clypei. Wasps use these pigmented clypei to determine the viability of challenging a rival. The more pigmented the clypei or the larger the Polistes exclamans, the more likely the Polistes exclamans will be willing to challenge a rival. The less pigmented the clypei or the smaller the Polistes exclamans, the less willing it would be to challenge a rival. This assists in the minimization of the “costs of conflict during dominance competition among nest-founding queens.” ...|$|E

500|$|Most street {{newspapers}} {{report on}} issues regarding homelessness and poverty, sometimes {{functioning as a}} main source of information on policy changes and other practical issues <b>that</b> <b>are</b> <b>relevant</b> <b>to</b> the homeless but may go unreported in mainstream media. [...] Many feature contributions from the homeless and the poor in addition to articles by activists and community organizers, including profiles of individual street newspaper vendors. [...] For example, {{the first edition of}} Washington, D.C.'s Street Sense included a description of a prominent homeless community, an interview with a congresswoman, an editorial about {{the costs and benefits of}} taking a job, several poems about homelessness, a how-to column, and a section for recipes. A 2009 issue of the Lawrence, Kansas-based Change of Heart included a story on the recent bulldozing of a homeless camp, a review of a book on homelessness, a description of the Family Promise organization for homeless support, and a list of community resources; much of this content was submitted by the homeless.

500|$|Controversy {{surrounding}} The Big Issue, the world's {{most widely}} circulated street newspaper, {{is a good}} example of these two schools of thought. [...] The Big Issue is mostly a tabloid covering celebrity news; while it is sold by the homeless and generates a profit that is used to benefit the homeless, the content is not written by them and there is little coverage of social issues <b>that</b> <b>are</b> <b>relevant</b> <b>to</b> them. [...] In the late 1990s when the London-based paper began making plans to enter markets in the United States, many American street newspaper publishers reacted defensively, saying they could not compete with the production values and mainstream appeal of the professionally produced The Big Issue or that The Big Issue did not do enough to provide a voice to the homeless. The reaction to The Big Issue raised what is now an ongoing conflict between commercialized, professional papers and more grassroots-style ones, with papers such as The Big Issue emulating mainstream papers and magazines in order to generate a large profit to invest in homeless issues and others focusing on political and social issues rather than on content that will generate money. [...] Some street newspaper proponents believe that the primary aim of the papers should be to give homeless individuals a voice and to [...] "fill the void" [...] in mainstream media coverage, whereas others believe it should be to provide homeless individuals with jobs and an income.|$|E

Blige, [...] "The One". It premiered on VEVO on April 12, 2010. In an exclusive with Rap-Up, when asked about how the connection came about, Mandler said, [...] "I’m {{a big fan of}} Drake and I was really excited when he called me about doing it, and really put a lot into making it special and capturing what I think is an image he hasn’t had yet. Here’s a guy whose lyrical presence does not equal his visual presence yet, by any means. That’s something that he and I spoke a lot about. He felt strongly that nobody had really captured him, and some of the videos that had been done were less iconic than he would like to be represented as." [...] On Drake and the song he said, [...] "It’s so refreshing that he’s confident, but he’s not arrogant. I think that dimensionality is so important in a genre that is very one note with words like “bravado” and “swagger” and “arrogance” and “promiscuity.” Here’s a guy that’s finally putting a duality to the words and saying, “Yeah, I have all that and I do all that, but I’m also somebody that’s asking, is that what I should be doing with my life?" [...] When asked of the concept of the [...] "Over" [...] video, Mandler said that it was something that would not be expected. Mandler explained, [...] "Drake and I were very conscious about trying to push the limits and trying to push things forward. He came to me because he wanted to throw away the conventions of a medium, and take chances and be daring and take certain themes <b>that</b> <b>are</b> <b>relevant</b> <b>to</b> him and try to visualize them in not the obvious way".|$|E
