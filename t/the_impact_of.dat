40|$|Identifying <b>the</b> <b>impacts</b> <b>of</b> various design {{strategies}} on {{satisfying the}} requirements of the target system is one of the important tasks in requirement engineering. In this paper, we proposed a systematic approach to analyze and reason <b>the</b> positive/negative <b>impacts</b> <b>of</b> design strategies on imprecise requirements. In our approach, we use fuzzy logic to capture the elasticity of requirements, to represent requirements, and to identify relationships between requirements. In order to analyze <b>the</b> <b>impacts</b> <b>of</b> design strategies on requirements, we explicitly represent design strategies in terms of requirements. We also developed a systematic reasoning scheme for reasoning <b>the</b> <b>impacts</b> <b>of</b> design strategies on requirements using the identified requirement-requirement and requirement-design relationships. The goal <b>of</b> identifying <b>the</b> <b>impacts</b> <b>of</b> design strategies on requirements is to reduce the conflicts between requirements and design strategies, to guide design engineers in evaluating design alterna [...] ...|$|R

This paper uses fixed-effect regression to estimate <b>the</b> <b>impacts</b> <b>of</b> foreign remittances on income and consumption of remittances-receiving households, and subsequently investigate <b>the</b> <b>impacts</b> <b>of</b> foreign remittances on poverty and inequality in Vietnam. It is found that receiving foreign remittances has increased household income and consumption remarkably, but decreased poverty slightly for the remittance recipients. In addition, foreign remittances have increased inequality, albeit at a small magnitude. ...|$|R

The Bellerive Foundation program encouraged eco-tourism, aiming to reduce <b>the</b> <b>impact</b> <b>of</b> outdoor adventure sports on the fragile alpine habitat. During its years of operation, Alp Action successfully launched over 140 projects in seven countries. It found inspiration in the system of national parks of the Canadian Rockies.|$|E

40|$|This paper investigates <b>the</b> <b>impacts</b> <b>of</b> non-constant {{return to}} scale, {{oligopsony}} power, and oligopoly power on farm value {{share with the}} approach of equilibrium displacement model. Our paper contrasts to the current literature that non-constant return to scale, oligopoly power, and oligopsony power are all incorporated into one generalized model which enables us to investigate <b>the</b> <b>impacts</b> <b>of</b> these three factors on the determination and changes of farm value share systematically. Our results imply that non-constant return to scale and market power {{is central to the}} understanding of farm value share. These in turn indicate that overlooking <b>the</b> <b>impacts</b> <b>of</b> market power and degree of return to scale may overestimate or underestimate <b>the</b> <b>impacts</b> <b>of</b> exogenous shocks on the changes on farm value share.
