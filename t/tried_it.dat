A second BT20 was {{completed}} at the Italian track and Brabham <b>tried</b> <b>it</b> in practice for the race, but decided to race his Old Nail, which he felt was fitted with a stronger engine. As at Reims, Brabham successfully slipstreamed the race leaders early on, but an oil leakage stopped the car after 8 laps. Neither Surtees nor Stewart finished the race and Brabham clinched his third world championship.|$|E

A caller questioned whether Hayes was under the influence of a substance, and Carolla and co-host Teresa Strasser asked Hayes if he had ever used marijuana. After some confusion on what was being asked, Hayes replied that he had only ever <b>tried</b> <b>it</b> once. During the interview the radio hosts made light of Hayes's awkward answers, and replayed Hayes comments as sound drops—often simulating conversation with his co-hosts. Hayes stated during this interview that he was no longer on good terms with Trey Parker and Matt Stone.|$|E
25|$|Surdam {{argues that}} the {{blockade}} was a powerful weapon that eventually ruined the Southern economy, {{at the cost of}} few lives in combat. Practically, the entire Confederate cotton crop was useless (although it was sold to Union traders), costing the Confederacy its main source of income. Critical imports were scarce and the coastal trade was largely ended as well. The measure of the blockade's success was not the few ships that slipped through, but the thousands that never <b>tried</b> <b>it.</b> Merchant ships owned in Europe could not get insurance and were too slow to evade the blockade; they simply stopped calling at Confederate ports.|$|E
25|$|In How to Rock Climb, John Long {{notes that}} for {{moderately}} skilled climbers simply {{getting to the}} top of a route is not enough; how one gets to the top matters. In rock climbing, style refers to the method of ascending the cliff. There are three main styles of climbing: on-sight, flash, and redpoint. To on-sight a route is to ascend the wall without aid or any foreknowledge. It is considered the way to climb with the most style. Flashing is similar to on-sighting, except that the climber has previous information about the route including talking about the beta with other climbers. Redpointing means to make a free ascent of the route after having first <b>tried</b> <b>it.</b>|$|E

25|$|Journalist Denis Jenkinson was Moss's navigator. He had {{intended}} to go with John Fitch, whose idea it had been to take a navigator, but when Mercedes assigned a 300 SL to Fitch, the American agreed to Jenkinson riding with Moss in the faster SLR. Jenkinson {{had come up with}} the idea of pace notes in the form of a roller map of the route on which he had noted its hazards—an innovation that helped Moss compete against drivers with greater local knowledge. Jenkinson used hand signals to tell him about the road ahead. Radio communication had proved ineffective when they <b>tried</b> <b>it,</b> because when Moss was fully concentrated on his driving he was oblivious to Jenkinson's voice.|$|E
25|$|In 1952, {{learning}} of the stimulating side effects of isoniazid, the Cincinnati psychiatrist Max Lurie <b>tried</b> <b>it</b> on his patients. In the following year, he and Harry Salzer reported that isoniazid improved depression in two thirds of their patients and coined the term antidepressant to describe its action. A similar incident took place in Paris, where Jean Delay, head of psychiatry at Sainte-Anne Hospital, heard of this effect from his pulmonology colleagues at Cochin Hospital. In 1952 (before Lurie and Salzer), Delay, with the resident Jean-Francois Buisson, reported {{the positive effect of}} isoniazid on depressed patients. The mode of antidepressant action of isoniazid is still unclear. It is speculated that its effect is due to the inhibition of diamine oxidase, coupled with a weak inhibition of monoamine oxidase A.|$|E
25|$|The {{principal}} results {{which were}} {{expected from the}} exploration of the Mekong may be summed up in a few words.

Were the rapids, of whose existence we knew, an absolute barrier? Were the islands of Khon an impassable difficulty?

To gather information respecting the sources of the latter, if it proved impossible to reach them; to solve the different geographical problems which would naturally offer, was {{the first part of the}} programme the commission had to carry out.|$|E

25|$|Internal {{beta testing}} of the game within Blizzard began in 2012. A closed beta was {{launched}} in August 2013, while the game was put into open beta in January 2014. These beta testing periods were {{used to evaluate the}} game's balance, adjusting cards they found to be too powerful or too weak, and making sure no single Hero or deck type dominated the game. As they approached the game's release in March 2014, Blizzard found that it was hard to generate interest in getting people to try the game, believing that once they <b>tried</b> <b>it</b> they would be drawn into the game; those they asked to try the game felt that Hearthstone wasn't the type of game they would be interested in playing. At this point, Blizzard opted to make Hearthstone free to play supported by microtransactions for less patient players. This helped to significantly boost the game's popularity on release.|$|E
25|$|The Bene Gesserit {{develop their}} {{physical}} abilities {{as well as}} their mental abilities. A trained Sister has full control over each muscle in her body through training known as prana-bindu. This allows her to bend the last joint in her little toe while remaining otherwise motionless, bend and contort her body in ways that most would consider impossible, or put a remarkable amount of force behind a physical blow. The mental part of prana-bindu, or prana-nervature (prana stands for breath, bindu stands for musculature) is the precise control of the totality of nerves in the human body. In Dune, Reverend Mother Mohiam tests Paul with a nerve induction device ("the box") that causes the sensation of intense pain. Paul learns that he {{is not the only one}} to have <b>tried</b> <b>it,</b> but is perhaps specially resistant; this conversation points to a widespread use of it as a tool among the Bene Gesserit to measure self control, nerve control, and as Mohiam puts it, crisis and observation.|$|E
25|$|The {{most popular}} type of {{substance}} that is smoked is tobacco. There {{are many different}} tobacco cultivars which are made into {{a wide variety of}} mixtures and brands. Tobacco is often sold flavored, often with various fruit aromas, something which is especially popular for use with water pipes, such as hookahs. The second most common substance that is smoked is cannabis, made from the flowers or leaves of Cannabis sativa or Cannabis indica. The substance is considered illegal in most countries in the world and in those countries that tolerate public consumption, it is usually only pseudo-legal. Despite this, a considerable percentage of the adult population in many countries have <b>tried</b> <b>it</b> with smaller minorities doing it on a regular basis. Since cannabis is illegal or only tolerated in most jurisdictions, there is no industrial mass-production of cigarettes, meaning that {{the most common form of}} smoking is with hand-rolled cigarettes (often called joints) or with pipes. Water pipes are also fairly common, and when used for cannabis are called bongs.|$|E

25|$|The 3–3–1–3 {{was formed}} of a {{modification}} to the Dutch 4–3–3 system Ajax had developed. Coaches like Louis van Gaal and Johan Cruyff {{brought it to}} even further attacking extremes and the system eventually {{found its way to}} Barcelona, where players such as Andrés Iniesta and Xavi were reared into 3–3–1–3's philosophy. It demands intense pressing high up the pitch especially from the forwards, and also an extremely high defensive line, basically playing the whole game inside the opponents' half. It requires extreme technical precision and rapid ball circulation since one slip or dispossession can result in a vulnerable counter-attack situation. Cruyff's variant relied on a flatter and wider midfield, but Van Gaal used an offensive midfielder and midfield diamond to link up with the front three more effectively. Marcelo Bielsa has used the system with some success with Argentina's and Chile's national teams and is currently one of the few high-profile managers to use the system in competition today. Diego Simeone had also <b>tried</b> <b>it</b> occasionally at River Plate.|$|E

She {{was in the}} cast of Crucifixus, a Passion play, which opened on November 12, 1907, at the , 1044 South Hope Street, in Los Angeles, before a good-sized audience. In early June 1908, she {{appeared}} in the Owen Davis play How Baxter Butted In, a melodramatic comedy, at the Los Angeles Theatre on Spring Street. The cast included Lulu Warrenton {{and a number of}} others. Glaum then toured as an ingenue with a road show in Why Girls Leave Home. She earned $25 a week and furnished her own gowns, which she made herself. After reaching Chicago, she played ingenues in the Imperial Stock Company there {{for a year and a}} half, appearing in The Lion and the Mouse and The Squaw Man, among other plays. While performing in a summer stock engagement in Toledo, she created the ingenue role in Officer 666. Its playwright, Augustin MacHugh, her theatre director in Toledo, <b>tried</b> <b>it</b> out there before Broadway ever saw the successful farce.|$|E
25|$|It was his batting {{that got}} the fans on their feet – not the high scores, but the {{determination}} to stay and grit it out against the Australians. So, with mentor Alan Knott, Russell turned up early for the second Test at Lord's, and for twenty minutes had the MCC ground staff boys throw plastic balls at him – without Russell batting a stroke, just ducking and diving to miss the short deliveries. That day, he also adopted some suitably pungent language {{in response to the}} Aussies' sledging, and after he had scored 64 not out, the Aussies never <b>tried</b> <b>it</b> on him again. In the third Test at Edgbaston, he scored 42, the second highest score of the first innings. But his greatest achievement was to come in the fourth Test at Old Trafford, where in the summer of the South African cricket rebels and near-certain defeat, for six hours he held up Aussie celebrations by scoring his highest-ever score in cricket, 128 not out, to almost save the Test for England. It was also his maiden century in all forms of cricket, an achievement only matched by one other Englishman in the twentieth century - Billy Griffith against West Indies in 1947–48 – but it was largely forgotten in the furore of the South African debacle, and the loss of the series. Russell finished the Ashes series as England's third-most-successful batsman, with 314 runs and an average of 39.25.|$|E

25|$|Bulgaria, a poor rural {{nation of}} 4.5 million people, sought to acquire Macedonia, {{but when it}} <b>tried</b> <b>it</b> {{suffered}} defeat in 1913 in the Second Balkan War. In the Great War Bulgaria at first stayed neutral. However its leaders still hoped to acquire Macedonia, which was controlled by an Ally, Serbia. In 1915, joining the Central Powers seemed the best route. Bulgaria mobilized a very large army of 800,000 men, using equipment supplied by Germany. The Bulgarian-German-Austrian invasion of Serbia in 1915 provided a quick victory, {{but by the end}} of that year Bulgaria was also fighting the British and French—as well as the Romanians in 1916 and the Greeks in 1917. Bulgaria was ill-prepared for a long war; the absence of so many soldiers sharply reduced agricultural output. Much of its best food was smuggled out to feed lucrative black-markets elsewhere. By 1918 the soldiers were not only short of basic equipment like boots, but they were being fed mostly corn bread with a little meat. Germany increasingly took control, and Bulgarian relations with its ally the Ottoman Empire soured. The Allied offensive in September 1918 destroyed the remnants of Bulgarian military power and civilian morale. Troops mutinied and peasants revolted, demanding peace. By that month's end Bulgaria signed an armistice, giving up its conquests and its military hardware. The Bulgarian Czar abdicated and Bulgaria's war ended. The Treaty of Neuilly-sur-Seine in 1919 stripped Bulgaria of its conquests, reduced its army to 20,000 men, and demanded reparations of £100 million.|$|E
25|$|The out of form Bill Lawry hung on grimly for an {{hour for}} 16 runs before he {{was caught in the}} slips by Tom Graveney off Fred Trueman, who took {{advantage}} of the freshened pitch and hit Bobby Simpson with a nasty rising ball. Neil Harvey cut Brian Statham for four and was caught by Ken Barrington in the gully when he <b>tried</b> <b>it</b> off the next ball. This left Australia 42/2 at lunch, but Simpson and Brian Booth added 86 runs in the afternoon session and opened up after tea. Booth hit Fred Titmus for six and overtook Simpson despite his 75-minute start. Their stand was ended in an eventful over from Ted Dexter (3/65); a diving Barrington missed Booth on the first ball, and the batsmen ran a single; Simpson was caught behind on the second ball, having made 71 in 237 minutes, Norm O'Neill took a single off the third ball and Booth hit a boundary off the fifth ball only to be taken by wicket-keeper Alan Smith for 77 with the last ball of the over. Dexter struck again before stumps, Barry Shepherd spooning a catch to Titmus at wide mid-off and Trueman had Ken Mackay caught at slip by Graveney in his last over with the old ball. O'Neill and Richie Benaud saw out the new ball and Australia finished the day at 225/6, a lead of 287 runs. Trueman and Statham fired down the new ball in the morning, but Titmus dropped Benaud on the first ball of the day. O'Neill was out to Trueman, caught by Cowdrey at slip, and Garth McKenzie became Smith's fifth catch of the match, taken off Statham. Alan Davidson came in for 14 balls before he was bowled by Statham (3/71) and Benaud and Wally Grout added 35 for the last wicket before the captain was caught for 48 by Barrington off Trueman (4/60). Benaud had refused to declare before lunch and make a game of it, but with the Ashes at stake and Davidson unable to bowl he dared not take the risk. As it was Australia made 293, setting England 356 to win in just over four hours.|$|E
