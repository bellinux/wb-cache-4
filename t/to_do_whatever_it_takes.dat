Noting that the crossover [...] "wasted some of its potential by delivering two mostly standalone episodes," [...] the Arrow episode was [...] "more consistently entertaining and satisfying than the first". He enjoyed Captain Boomerang suggesting {{he could be the}} [...] "most memorable villain to debut this season". Schedeen enjoyed the teams continuing to cross paths, the drama between Barry and Ollie, and [...] "the balance between light and dark [...] needed". Alasdair Wilkins of The A.V. Club gave the episode an [...] "A-", saying it [...] "..can just cut loose and have some [...] fun for an hour," [...] noting that Barry [...] "is one of the only characters able to call Oliver out on his more mopey strains of bullshit".

500|$|Critics {{praised the}} {{character}} development of Shane in the episode, {{as well as}} the execution of Otis. Nate Rawlings of Time felt that it was a dark moment for the series, and felt that it added anticipation to future development. He wrote: [...] "At some point, Shane will have to come clean with Rick about what happened to Otis. Given Rick’s extremely rigid morale [...] code and Shane’s now demonstrated willingness <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>whatever</b> <b>it</b> <b>takes</b> to survive, the showdown promises to be bigger than just a battle of two alpha males. The Rick/Shane divide is a battle of two leaders with different ideas of humanity and survival." [...] Mark Maurer of The Star-Ledger opined that [...] "both the multi-layered opening [...] illustrates how Shane’s impulsive nature makes him a valuable if ruthless warrior." [...] Handlen appreciated the character development of Shane, writing, [...] "Shane has long been the dark horse of the group, the one most likely to go off the morality reservation, and this reveal works well to bring him that much closer to darkness. It's not the subtlest moment [...] but, given how friendly and cool Otis was, and given how well the two seemed to be working together, it's a strong twist." [...] He added that because of the death of Otis, the show now has a sense of direction. [...] "His decision to sacrifice Otis is easy enough to rationalize; somebody had to get back for Carl's sake, Shane was faster, and both of them probably weren't going to make it. That's the beauty of it. In a certain light, he made the right choice." [...] Morgan Jeffrey wrote: [...] "This week's installment delivered even more scares than usual — Shane's escape from the high school was almost unbearably tense." ...|$|E

2500|$|Maxine McCarty Gray, {{played by}} Tyne Daly: She is Amy's widowed mother.

She is willing <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>whatever</b> <b>it</b> <b>takes</b> to help the {{children}} in her care, even bending the law. She is an opinionated, strong-willed woman, very set in her ways, and capable of holding long grudges (she has not spoken to her brother in over 12 years), but loving to her family. Her relationship with daughter Amy is often not easy, since they are so much alike. After a troubled courtship, she becomes engaged to a wealthy businessman, Jared Duff, but he dies 48 hours before their wedding (a storyline twist necessitated by the unexpected death of the actor Richard Crenna, who played the character). She later becomes involved in a very complicated, on again off again relationship to her landscape designer Ignacio Messina. She has two heart attacks in the last season and has to undergo open heart surgery, but makes certain lifestyle changes and recovers well. At the end of the series she accepts Ignacio's marriage proposal and is set to retire again, becoming a foster parent to the last child she helped.|$|E

2500|$|A {{final twist}} in Steven's story was his {{involvement}} in a seemingly unrelated plotline that had been running simultaneously to Steven's personal dilemma, the disappearance of his half sister Lucy (Melissa Suffield). In episodes that aired in May 2008, {{it was revealed that}} Steven had been hiding his runaway sister in a caravan, poisoning her mind against Ian and persuading her to flee the country. Explaining his character's motives, Sidwell said, [...] "It’s all about Ian again. Steven wants all Ian’s love and attention and he feels Lucy is getting in the way. She’s the one who gets most of Ian’s time and energy and he thinks getting her out of the picture will leave Ian all for him [...] He’s been brainwashing her into thinking Ian doesn’t care if she never goes home again [...] His real plan is to keep her out of Ian’s life for good [...] He craves Ian’s full attention and is willing <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>whatever</b> <b>it</b> <b>takes</b> to make that happen. He doesn’t exactly plan to be evil but he is dangerous." [...] In the end Steven's plan was discovered by his grandmother Pat, leading Steven to attempt to suffocate her to death before she revealed the truth to Ian. An EastEnders source told Digital Spy: [...] "Steven hits rock bottom when Pat finds out that he's been hiding Lucy for all these weeks while his family have been frantically searching for her [...] when Pat realises that Steven knows where Lucy is, he takes drastic steps to prevent his beloved nan from revealing all to Ian. He goes from confused to psycho in a matter of minutes, grabbing a pillow and pushing it onto her face." [...] Sidwell added, [...] "Steven is deadly! He is willing <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>whatever</b> <b>it</b> <b>takes</b> to get what he wants [...] including murder." [...] The murder attempt was stopped by Ian, and after discovering the truth from Pat, Ian chased Steven to London's St. Pancras Station (where he was intending to put Lucy on the Eurostar to Paris) and convinced Lucy to return home. Sidwell commented, [...] "Steven is such a good manipulator he thinks Lucy will side with him. He’s shocked when she doesn’t and when she agrees to go home with Ian." [...] In Steven's final scenes, Ian rejects Steven as his son once again, telling him [...] "I never give up on my family. But you're not my family, are you? You're your mother's son and you're Simon's son, and that really used to hurt. Now I thank God I never produced anything as sick and twisted as you." [...] Steven then departed from Walford after Ian vowed to kill him if he ever saw him again.|$|E
