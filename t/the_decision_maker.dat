25|$|Visualization of the Pareto {{front is}} one of the a posteriori {{preference}} techniques of multi-objective optimization. The a posteriori preference techniques (see, for example,) provide an important class of multi-objective optimization techniques. Usually the a posteriori preference techniques include four steps: (1) computer approximates the Pareto front, i.e. the Pareto optimal set in the objective space; (2) <b>the</b> <b>decision</b> <b>maker</b> studies the Pareto front approximation; (3) <b>the</b> <b>decision</b> <b>maker</b> identifies the preferred point at the Pareto front; (4) computer provides the Pareto optimal decision, which output coincides with the objective point identified by <b>the</b> <b>decision</b> <b>maker.</b> From {{the point of view of}} <b>the</b> <b>decision</b> <b>maker,</b> the second step of the a posteriori preference techniques is the most complicated one. There are two main approaches to informing <b>the</b> <b>decision</b> <b>maker.</b> First, a number of points of the Pareto front can be provided in the form of a list (interesting discussion and references are given in) or using Heatmaps.|$|E

25|$|On {{the other}} hand, a fourth type of {{generating}} {{a small sample}} of solutions is included in and. An example of interactive method utilizing trade-off information is the Zionts-Wallenius method, where <b>the</b> <b>decision</b> <b>maker</b> is shown several objective trade-offs at each iteration, and (s)he is expected to say whether (s)he likes, dislikes or is indifferent with respect to each trade-off. In reference point based methods (see e.g.), <b>the</b> <b>decision</b> <b>maker</b> is expected at each iteration to specify a reference point consisting of desired values for each objective and a corresponding Pareto optimal solution(s) is then computed and shown to him/her for analysis. In classification based interactive methods, <b>the</b> <b>decision</b> <b>maker</b> is assumed to give preferences in the form of classifying objectives at the current Pareto optimal solution into different classes indicating how the values of the objectives should be changed to get a more preferred solution. Then, the classification information given is taken into account when new (more preferred) Pareto optimal solution(s) are computed. In the satisficing trade-off method (STOM) three classes are used: objectives whose values 1) should be improved, 2) can be relaxed, and 3) are acceptable as such. In the NIMBUS method, two additional classes are also used: objectives whose values 4) should be improved until a given bound and 5) can be relaxed until a given bound.|$|E
25|$|In {{the case}} of bi-objective problems, informing <b>the</b> <b>decision</b> <b>maker</b> {{concerning}} the Pareto front is usually carried out by its visualization: the Pareto front, often named the tradeoff curve in this case, can be drawn at the objective plane. The tradeoff curve gives full information on objective values and on objective tradeoffs, which inform how improving one objective is related to deteriorating the second one while moving along the tradeoff curve. <b>The</b> <b>decision</b> <b>maker</b> takes this information into account while specifying the preferred Pareto optimal objective point. The idea to approximate and visualize the Pareto front was introduced for linear bi-objective decision problems by S.Gass and T.Saaty. This idea was developed and applied in environmental problems by J.L. Cohon. A review of methods for approximating the Pareto front for various decision problems with {{a small number of}} objectives (mainly, two) is provided in.|$|E
25|$|The above {{aspiration}} levels {{refer to}} desirable objective function values forming a reference point. Instead of mathematical convergence {{that is often}} used as a stopping criterion in mathematical optimization methods, a psychological convergence is often emphasized in interactive methods. Generally speaking, a method is terminated when <b>the</b> <b>decision</b> <b>maker</b> is confident that he/she has found the most preferred solution available.|$|E

25|$|In {{a priori}} methods, {{preference}} information is first asked from the DM {{and then a}} solution best satisfying these preferences is found. In a posteriori methods, a representative set of Pareto optimal solutions is first found and then the DM must choose one of them. In interactive methods, <b>the</b> <b>decision</b> <b>maker</b> is allowed to iteratively search for the most preferred solution. In each iteration of the interactive method, the DM is shown Pareto optimal solution(s) and describes how the solution(s) could be improved. The information given by <b>the</b> <b>decision</b> <b>maker</b> is then taken into account while generating new Pareto optimal solution(s) for the DM to study in the next iteration.

More information and examples of different methods in the four classes are given in the following sections.|$|E

25|$|Bayesian {{decision}} theory {{can be applied}} to all four areas of the marketing mix. Assessments are made by a decision maker on the probabilities of events that determine the profitability of alternative actions where the outcomes are uncertain. Assessments are also made for the profit (utility) for each possible combination of action and event. <b>The</b> <b>decision</b> <b>maker</b> can decide how much research, if any, needs to be conducted in order to investigate the consequences associated with the courses of action under evaluation. This is done before a final decision is made, but {{it should be noted that}} in order to do this costs would be incurred, time used and may overall be unreliable. For each possible action, expected profit can be computed, that is a weighted mean of the possible profits, the weights being the probabilities. <b>The</b> <b>decision</b> <b>maker</b> can then choose the action for which the expected profit is the highest. The theorem provides a formal reconciliation between judgment expressed quantitatively in the prior distribution and the statistical evidence of the experiment.|$|E

25|$|As an example, {{consider}} two-stage linear programs.

The optimal policy from such a model is a single first-stage policy and a collection of recourse decisions (a decision rule) defining which second-stage action should be taken in response to each random outcome.|$|E
25|$|There are two generic ideas how to {{visualize}} the Pareto front in high-order multi-objective decision problems (problems with more than two objectives). One of them, which is applicable {{in the case of}} a relatively small number of objective points that represent the Pareto front, is based on using the visualization techniques developed in statistics (various diagrams, etc. – see the corresponding subsection below). The second idea proposes the display of bi-objective cross-sections (slices) of the Pareto front. It was introduced by W.S. Meisel in 1973 who argued that such slices inform <b>the</b> <b>decision</b> <b>maker</b> on objective tradeoffs. The figures that display a series of bi-objective slices of the Pareto front for three-objective problems are known as the decision maps. They give a clear picture of tradeoffs between three criteria. Disadvantages of such an approach are related to two following facts. First, the computational procedures for constructing the bi-objective slices of the Pareto front are not stable since the Pareto front is usually not stable. Secondly, it is applicable in the case of only three objectives. In the 1980s, the idea W.S. Meisel of implemented in a different form – in the form of the Interactive Decision Maps (IDM) technique.|$|E
2500|$|In {{interactive}} {{methods of}} optimizing multiple objective problems, the solution process is iterative and <b>the</b> <b>decision</b> <b>maker</b> continuously {{interacts with the}} method when searching for the most preferred solution (see e.g. Miettinen1999, Miettinen2008).

40|$|An {{innovative}} negotiation {{framework for}} resolving complex construction conflicts and disputes {{has been developed}} in this research. The unique feature of the proposed negotiation framework is that it {{takes into account the}} attitudes of <b>the</b> <b>decision</b> <b>makers,</b> which is an important human factor in construction negotiation at both the strategic and tactical levels of <b>decision</b> making. At <b>the</b> strategic level, the Graph Model for Conflict Resolution (GMCR) technique has been systematically employed as a method of determining the most beneficial strategic agreement that is possible, given the competing interests and attitudes of <b>the</b> <b>decision</b> <b>makers.</b> At <b>the</b> tactical level, a previously agreed-upon strategic decision has been analyzed in depth using utility functions {{in order to determine the}} trade-offs or concessions needed for <b>the</b> <b>decision</b> <b>makers</b> to reach a mutually acceptable resolution of the negotiation issues. A real-life case study of a brownfield construction negotiation has been used to illustrate how the proposed methodology can be applied and to demonstrate the importance and benefits of incorporating the attitudes of <b>the</b> <b>decision</b> <b>makers</b> into <b>the</b> negotiation process to better identify the most feasible resolutions. The proposed attitude-based negotiation framework constitutes a new systems engineering methodology that will assist managers in tackling real-world controversies, particularly in the construction industry. The negotiation framework has been implemented into a convenient negotiation decision support system that automates the proposed negotiation methodology. The research is expected to improve negotiation methodologies for construction disputes, thereby saving significant amounts of time and resources. The proposed methodology may also assist <b>decision</b> <b>makers</b> in overcoming <b>the</b> challenges of conventional negotiation processes because the incorporation of the attitudes of <b>the</b> <b>decision</b> <b>makers</b> results in a more accurate identification of tradeoffs, greater recognition of the level of satisfaction of <b>the</b> <b>decision</b> <b>makers,</b> and enhanced generation of optimum solutions...|$|R
