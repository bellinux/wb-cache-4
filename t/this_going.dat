The Super Kings won the toss and elected to bat first, But they made slow star from the {{starting}} also {{they lost their}} first three wickets in 29 runs. But later on contributions of 37 and 30 from middle order batsmen Subramaniam Badrinath and skipper Dhoni rescued Super Kings and helped to build up their innings. In later part of the innings a cameo of 24 runs from Srikkanth Anirudha helped Super Kings post a total of 142 for 7 on the board. Ryan Harris took three wickets for 29 runs. To chase down 142, the chargers started very slow. They lost their first wicket at 19 runs with skipper Adam Gilchrist departing after scoring 15 runs.

He stated that once he got inside the studio, however, his skepticism vanished as he saw the group's [...] "excitement being back in the studio together", calling the process [...] "natural". The members of the group stated that the first week of recording was spent solely on conversations about the happenings in their lives while being apart from each other as they hadn't spent quaility time for a long period.

2500|$|From her {{official}} American {{debut in}} New York's Aeolian Hall on 20 January 1913, Leginska's {{popularity in the}} U.S. was growing, aided by both the careful staging of her performances, with well-thought-out lighting and decor {{to focus on the}} performer, and her distinctive style of dressing (favoring menswear) eagerly copied by her young fans, as well as her diminutive size and her youthful appearance that not only made the musical youth more likely to relate to her, but often misled not only her audiences but even the reviewers who would express their astonishment that a person so [...] "young" [...] displayed such skill as hers (<b>this</b> <b>going</b> on all the way into Leginska's late thirties, as made evident in the Detroit News critic Robert Kelly's description of her perform at 37). In 1923, Leginska went to London to study orchestral conducting with Eugene Goossens. She also studied conducting with Robert Heger, conductor of the Bavarian State Opera in Munich, proceeding to conduct as guest conductor with major orchestras in Munich, Paris, London or Berlin, taking advantage of her earlier contacts established when she performed as a pianist, as well as agreeing to also perform in a concerto on the programs. Being a woman conductor also helped her attract attention, as a novelty. She conducted a performance of her orchestral suite Quatre sujets barbares. In 1925, she made her debut as a conductor in the United States with the New York Symphony Orchestra in Carnegie Hall, after which she appeared with the Boston People's Orchestra in the spring and then performing at the Hollywood Bowl in the summer of 1925. She had suffered nervous breakdowns in 1909, 1925 and 1926. In 1926 she announced a permanent retirement from performing as a pianist and focused on conducting, composing and teaching.|$|E

[...] Marcus Carey, a security researcher for Rapid7, said that the hackers had penetrated the databases of LinkedIn in the preceding days. He expressed concerns {{that they may have}} had access to the website even after the attack. Michael Aronowitz, Vice President of Saveology said, [...] "Everyday hundreds of sites are hacked and personal information is obtained. Stealing login information from one account can easily be used to access other accounts, which can hold personal and financial information." [...] Security experts indicated that the stolen passwords were encrypted {{in a way that was}} fairly easy to decrypt, which was one of the reasons for the data breach.

2500|$|Each {{locomotive}} bore a name: {{for example}} D825 was Intrepid. All except D800 and D812 were named after Royal Navy vessels, thus the [...] "Warship diesel" [...] moniker {{used to refer}} to the class. D800 was named Sir Brian Robertson after the Chairman of the British Transport Commission at the time. D812 was planned to carry the name Despatch but was eventually named Royal Naval Reserve 1859–1959. All except these two bore a subtitle [...] "Warship Class" [...] in smaller letters underneath the main name. A nice touch was that throughout the production series examples (including the NBL-built D833–865) the names were allocated alphabetically. This caused some difficulty when Swindon was unexpectedly given an order for five more locomotives (which became D866–870); a shortage of Warship names beginning with Z required some names for the higher numbered NBL examples to be reallocated. The original livery for all D800s was BR green with a light grey waistband and red bufferbeams. In the mid-1960s the WR decided upon maroon as its new house colour for mainline diesel locomotives, <b>this</b> <b>going</b> very much against standard schemes imposed by BR's overall management. In November 1966 the first D800 (D864) appeared in the new BR blue scheme with D864 carrying an experimental 'Burnt Umber' paint scheme around the lower skirting (an attempt to mask out brake dust). Half yellow nose ends appeared from January 1962 and eventually two Green, several Maroon and all Blue-liveried locomotives received full yellow ends. Green livery was eradicated by 1970 when D810 was repainted, this being the last green member of the class in service, although D800 had still carried the green livery when withdrawn in 1968. A handful of Maroon examples, including D809, D815 & D817 remained in traffic until 5 October 1971, and were finally withdrawn in this colour scheme, although by now wearing full yellow ends. Three of the early withdrawals, D801, D840 and D848, met their end in maroon with small yellow panels. After withdrawal of steam in 1968, the [...] "D" [...] prefix was dropped from locomotive running numbers when repaints occurred – so for example, D832 became just 832 as there was now no chance of it conflicting with a steam locomotive number.|$|E
2500|$|Numerous {{interior}} and exterior locations used to suit {{the needs of the}} story, were filmed in Los Angeles, California. Within a 5-month shooting schedule, 3 weeks were spent shooting at studio locations. Production designer Jack Collis, explained how the film integrates a minority group (the aliens) into the film saying, [...] "The idea was to bring in this alien group, assimilate them into our society, and get them a locale that would be a part of Los Angeles, ... It would look almost as if a group of Koreans or Vietnamese that had moved into the area. This group would have established their own community. They have their own language, their own signs." [...] The film crew installed fictional alien language signs along Western Avenue and Santa Monica Boulevard. Colored drawings were made of all stores {{on both sides of the}} street for two full blocks. Painted and electrical signs were designed for each building. Graffiti was also carefully planned out. The film crew did their own painting and even took a big blank concrete wall and inserted alien graffiti for a scene involving an early physical confrontation between the main characters. Essentially, the alphabet of the alien citizens had to be designed as an integral part of their environment. He commented how the crew [...] "came up with individual alphabets and then combined them into certain words like, say, 'enter' and 'open', so that we could repeat them, ..." [...] while also mentioning how they [...] "brought in a language expert to give us something the actors could be comfortable with." [...] The Hawthorns, a well known family of sign painters, created most of the alien signs. Collis even mused how at one point, store owners liked, and wouldn't want to take down the alien graffiti used during filming on their properties. Collis recalled how the alien language resembled [...] "a flowing design more like hand writing than lettering, that looks almost like a heartbeat graph. Occasionally, we'd underline it as though it came from sort of electronic machine, like an IBM report. It turned out to be such a simple thing once we got it going, but we had to go through a process of 'what is <b>this</b> <b>going</b> to look like?' before we got what we wanted." ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{the first}} session with Stannard and Rowe, they wrote [...] "Feed Your Love", a slow, soulful song which was {{eventually}} recorded and mastered for the album but not released because it was considered too rude and racy for their target audience. Similarly, [...] "C U Next Tuesday", a song initially meant for the album, was never released supposedly due to the initials of the song's title spelling the word [...] "cunt" [...] which {{is considered by many}} to be vulgar. Having completed that session, the girls wanted to write something more uptempo, so they started to write the song that would be the lead of the album, [...] "Wannabe", which was recorded in under an hour—mainly because they had already written parts of the songs beforehand. The next song they recorded was a slow ballad and the third track on and single from the album, [...] "2 Become 1". The song was inspired by the special relationship which had developed between Halliwell and Rowe during the session. [...] "Mama" [...] was written by the Spice Girls with songwriting partners Matt Rowe and Richard Stannard. In an interview about the writing process between the group and the duo, Rowe credits Mel B as the one who came up with the song's concept. During the writing process, each member wrote a small verse in a different corner of the recording studio, while the chorus was finished around the piano with a guitar. Then, the producers added a gospel choir filled with the group's harmonies at the end of the song. In May 1995, the group was introduced to Paul Wilson and Andy Watkins, the songwriters and production duo known as Absolute. Watkins commented about their first meeting, [...] "They played us a few tracks, which we didn't particularly like. So we thought, this is OK. We can work with this." [...] A songwriting session was booked within the next few days at Absolute's studio located on Tagg's Island near Chertsey, but the musical association between them did not seem to go well at the beginning. Wilson remembered, [...] "When they started to sing it was never quite right: from our point of view. It was very poptastic." [...] Watkins recalled, [...] "After two sessions we phoned our managers and said 'This just ain't happening'." [...] It was at this point that Watkins and Wilson heard [...] "Wannabe" [...] for the first time. When speaking about the song, Wilson said, [...] "We listened to it and we didn't get it at all. It was so different to what we were doing. We thought is <b>this</b> <b>going</b> to work?".|$|E
