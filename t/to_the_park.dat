40|$|This paper {{responds}} to points made by Low (Solar Phys. 2010. doi: 10. 1007 /s 11207 - 010 - 9619 -z) with regard <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Parker</b> problem as formulated in Craig and Sneyd (Solar Phys. 232, 41, 2005). We first point out that, since Low focuses mainly on interpreting approximate linearized solutions <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Parker</b> problem, his approach cannot address key issues relating <b>to</b> <b>the</b> finite amplitude stability and dynamic accessibility of potential equilibria. Further difficulties are shown to surround Low’s assertion that non-linear equilibria derived by magneto-frictional relaxation of <b>the</b> <b>Parker</b> problem should be discounted. We conclude that both linear and non-linear approaches <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Parker</b> problem appear remarkably consistent: they demonstrate {{the development of}} smooth 3 D equilibria as opposed <b>to</b> <b>the</b> routine collapse <b>to</b> singular current sheets. The online version of the article of B. C. Low “The Craig–Sneyd Analytic Solutions <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Parker</b> Problem” can be found under doi: 10. 1007 /s 11207 - 010 - 9619 -z...|$|R

5|$|The United States Army had {{jurisdiction}} over the national park from 1891 to 1914, followed by {{a brief period of}} civilian stewardship. The newly formed National Park Service took over the park's administration in 1916. Improvements <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>park</b> helped to increase visitation during this time. Preservationists led by Muir and the Sierra Club failed to save Hetch Hetchy Valley from becoming a reservoir in 1923. In 1964, 89 percent of the park was set aside in a highly protected wilderness area, and other protected areas were added adjacent <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>park.</b> The once-famous Yosemite Firefall, created by pushing red hot embers off a cliff near Glacier Point at night, was discontinued in the mid-to-late 20th century along with other activities that were deemed to be inconsistent with protection of the national park.|$|E
