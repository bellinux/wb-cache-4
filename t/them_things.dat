500|$|In {{selecting}} which {{single to}} release first, Usher and the label considered various marketing strategies. With many potential lead singles that could fare well in music markets, they were choosing between [...] "Yeah!" [...] and [...] "Burn". Even though [...] "Burn" [...] {{was just what}} the label was looking for, they believed that [...] "Yeah!" [...] would be a blockbuster. Meanwhile, they felt [...] "Burn" [...] also failed to meet their expectations: [...] "'Burn' being a great song is one thing, but it's one of <b>them</b> <b>things</b> where people said, 'It's strong, but can we make history with that?' At {{the end of the}} day, you want an event." ...|$|E
500|$|..... Like with 'Everytime' I {{wrote the}} whole thing from scratch on the piano. Musically there was no track or anything. I was just at my house and I did {{the whole thing}} by myself. And then I went and I played it for [...] and I just {{basically}} told him exactly how I wanted the song to sound. And he was so amazing because there's a lot of producers you tell <b>them</b> <b>things</b> and they don't get it. And you're like oh, that's not the right way. He got it just right. He was amazing. And so that song specifically, you know, I did everything." ...|$|E
500|$|Meanwhile, Kenneth is {{throwing}} his rule-filled [...] "Secret Santa Fun Swap", {{much to the}} writers' chagrin. Frank, Toofer, and Lutz proclaim they are strict adherents of [...] "Verdukianism," [...] a religion they make up on the spot, and have Kenneth give <b>them</b> <b>things</b> they claim to need for [...] "Merlinpeen," [...] the Verdukian Holiday of Mouth Pleasures (such as meat-lover's pizza and having their teeth flossed by a blonde virgin). Their famous holiday song is, [...] "Oh, Meatbowl of Verduke, you bring me such pizza. Meatbowl." [...] When Tracy Jordan (Tracy Morgan) tells Kenneth that they made up their religion, he goes into shock {{at the idea that}} all religions are made up by man. His faith is restored when the three are arrested for the bomb threat Liz called in, using their phone.|$|E
6000|$|Marston {{mentioned}} some articles Wyndham {{had talked}} about, {{and the other}} nodded. [...] "You go make me dash and you get <b>them</b> <b>thing.</b> Agent man fool man; him no savvy black man's way in bush." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "White man fool man! Black man fix <b>them</b> <b>thing</b> different," [...] Rupert remarked {{with his}} cruel grin. Then he {{indicated}} Marston and added in good English: [...] "This fellow {{is certainly a}} fool, but his boyish scruples have beaten my cleverest schemes." ...|$|R

500|$|Roger Ebert {{wrote that}} [...] "as preposterous moneymakers go, it's ambitious and well-made. The acting {{from the large}} cast is of a high standard, Craig and Ford {{were more or less}} born into their roles, and {{director}} Jon Favreau actually develops his characters and gives <b>them</b> <b>things</b> to do, instead of posing them in front of special effects." [...] He lamented [...] however that the film was not a pure Western, saying of the aliens, [...] "here is more genuine suspense when [...] starts shooting up the town than when countless aliens appear". Salons Andrew O'Hehir offered a mixed response, claiming the film to be well made and clever, and singling out Craig and Ford for their performances. O'Hehir was, however, critical of the combination of western and science-fiction elements, calling it [...] "a mediocre western clumsily welded to a mediocre alien shoot-'em-up".|$|E
500|$|The {{group was}} unable to bring the large amounts of Faygo needed for their concerts to their European tours without a sales permit visa because customs {{believed}} that the group had intended to sell the soda at their concerts. As a result, the group's European record label purchased similar quantities of another soda and created fake Faygo stickers to label the bottles. According to Bruce, [...] "The craziness was this: {{they were not the}} regular two-liter bottles we're used to; they were some other amount... maybe one-and-a-half-liter bottles. Over there, they make their plastic bottles taller and thinner...when you're doing what we do with them—that makes a world of difference". During a performance in England, Bruce recounts that he [...] "rocketed one of them bottles off my foot and that motherfucker shot straight up and out like a guided Patriot missile, right towards the disco ball high above the crowd...The bottle nailed the disco ball, and... came falling down... on top of some English kid's head.... We must've knocked fifteen or twenty people flat-out cold on that tour...Shaggy and I both had black eyes and several injuries and bruises ourselves from <b>them</b> <b>things</b> hittin' us".|$|E
500|$|Though [...] "Yeah!" [...] was now completed, {{the label}} still had [...] "Burn" [...] on queue {{for the lead}} single. Usher's friend and former A rep Kawan [...] "KP" [...] Prather commented: [...] "'Burn' being a great song is one thing, but it's one of <b>them</b> <b>things</b> where people said, 'It's strong, but can we make history with that?' At {{the end of the}} day, you want an event." [...] Usher was unsure if [...] "Yeah!" [...] was the right choice. After Lil Jon leaked [...] "Yeah!" [...] to street DJs across the United States, Usher opted [...] "Burn" [...] as the lead single of the album and was already {{planning}} for its music video. The song was not intended to be a proper single and only a teaser for Usher's fans after waiting for years. However, the responses of [...] "Yeah!" [...] were overwhelmingly favorable, and [...] "Yeah!" [...] was released as the first single instead of [...] "Burn", which became the second single from the album. The single was released in the United States on January 27, 2004 as a CD single and 12" [...] single. LaFace Records sent [...] "Yeah!" [...] to US contemporary hit radio on February 7, 2004. In the United Kingdom, it was released as a CD single, containing the album and instrumental version of the song, and two unreleased tracks from the album, [...] "Red Light" [...] and [...] "Sweet Lies".|$|E

500|$|For In the Zone, Spears {{worked with}} hit {{producers}} such as Bloodshy & Avant, R. Kelly, Diddy, Christopher Stewart, Moby, Guy Sigsworth and The Matrix. She first started writing songs for In the Zone during the Dream Within a Dream Tour. Spears commented about writing while touring, [...] "The {{only thing that}} was scary {{to me is that}} I didn't know if they were good. [...] You can’t trust anybody. You have to go with your feelings." [...] Spears commented that she was an autobiographical songwriter, although not to the point she felt self-exploited. Following the end of the tour, Spears invited her friend and backing vocalist Annet Artani to her home in Los Angeles. They started writing songs at the piano, and shortly after, they traveled to Lake Como in Lombardy, Italy. Among the tracks they worked on was [...] "Everytime", which Artani confirmed to be written as a response to Justin Timberlake's [...] "Cry Me a River", as well as [...] "Shine", written by Spears about her sister Jamie Lynn, which was left unfinished. Earnest recording of the album began in May 2003. Spears commented that although she did not know initially what direction she wanted to go with the album, she took time to work with different producers and to find those who she had chemistry with. The first song recorded for In the Zone was [...] "Touch of My Hand", and Spears said it [...] "really did provide a balance {{for the rest of the}} record. We just went from there." [...] Following the recording sessions for [...] "Everytime", Spears complimented Sigsworth, saying, [...] "I just basically told him exactly how I wanted the song to sound. And he was so amazing because there's a lot of producers you tell <b>them</b> <b>things</b> and they don't get it. And you're like oh, that's not the right way. He got it just right. He was amazing." ...|$|E
2500|$|Jessome became {{close friends}} with several wrestlers while touring with RAW among these being Lincoln Steen who {{claimed he was}} a {{practical}} joker. He once joked during an interview about learning [...] "a great deal of invaluable lessons while {{on the road with}} <b>them,</b> <b>things</b> like don't trust Duke MacIsaac with a sharpie if you pass out in Mike Hughes’ van." [...] In late-2001, Jessome injured his knee and remained out of action for several months. When RAW resumed operations early the following year, Jessome {{was one of the main}} stars to rejoin the promotion.|$|E
2500|$|Rather, {{they carry}} earlier things with <b>them,</b> <b>things</b> which are {{intricately}} involved. One has one's times according to where one stands corporeally, above all {{in terms of}} classes. Times older than the present continue to effect older strata; here {{it is easy to}} return or dream one's way back to older times. [...] In general, different years resound in the one that has just been recorded and prevails. Moreover, they do not emerge in a hidden way as previously but rather, they contradict the Now in a very peculiar way, awry, from the rear. [...] Many earlier forces, from quite a different Below, are beginning to slip between.|$|E

2500|$|In 1954, Holloway's {{loyalty to}} the Naval Academy landed him in {{professional}} trouble for {{the only time in}} his career. Testifying before a congressional committee in favor of the proposed creation of the United States Air Force Academy, Holloway declared that he was sick and tired of sending Naval Academy graduates to the Air Force and admitted that he did everything possible to prevent such [...] "desertions." [...] Called to account by an infuriated Deputy Secretary of Defense Roger M. Kyes, Holloway stood by his words. [...] "What's wrong with that?" [...] he demanded. [...] "We don't want our boys going to the Air Force. We teach <b>them</b> <b>things</b> we don't want used against us later." ...|$|E
2500|$|Prior to the Act, most {{financial}} services companies were already offering both saving and investment opportunities to their customers. On the retail/consumer side, a bank called Norwest Corporation, which would later merge with Wells Fargo Bank, {{led the charge}} in offering all types of {{financial services}} products in 1986. American Express attempted to own participants in almost every field of financial business (although there was little synergy among <b>them).</b> <b>Things</b> culminated in 1998 when Citibank merged with Travelers Insurance, creating CitiGroup. [...] The merger violated the Bank Holding Company Act (BHCA), but Citibank was given a two-year forbearance {{that was based on}} an assumption that {{they would be able to}} force a change in the law. The Gramm–Leach–Bliley Act passed in November 1999, repealing portions of the BHCA and the Glass–Steagall Act, allowing banks, brokerages, and insurance companies to merge, thus making the CitiCorp/Travelers Group merger legal.|$|E
2500|$|The {{exhibition}} was condemned outright by some art critics and social commenters who rejected {{the very existence}} of an exhibition of motorcycles at the Guggenheim. [...] They saw it as a failure of the museum to carry out its social role as a leader and educator of the public's understanding of art. [...] Rather than guide the masses toward works they might not have considered or been aware of, The Art of the Motorcycle showed <b>them</b> <b>things</b> they already were familiar with, and already liked; in other words, pandering to the lowest common denominator by giving people more of what they wanted and none of what they needed. [...] To the extent that the exhibition responded to desires other than what made the [...] public feel good, the Guggenheim was catering to the marketing needs of the shows sponsors, in particular BMW. [...] They saw a great cultural institution renting itself out as an exhibition hall for a mere trade show.|$|E

2500|$|Witness George Lopez, once {{friends with}} the accuser's family, gave the family money, but had a falling out when the father kept asking for more. [...] Lopez also {{described}} an incident when the Arvizos allegedly tried to frame him for stealing $300 from Gavin's wallet. This allegation was used to illustrate a pattern of family behavior. [...] However, the accuser's sister, Davellin, testified that these problems were all caused by her father before the divorce. Other popular comedians testified about their run-ins with the Arvizos. Chris Tucker claimed he had felt sorry for them and had taken them out, bought <b>them</b> <b>things,</b> and given them money; but he felt the Arvizos expected too much, calling him their [...] "brother" [...] and taking advantage of him. He testified that he had warned Michael Jackson about the family, whom he called [...] "cunning." [...] Jay Leno testified that Gavin Arvizo, with a woman directing him in the background, called him and praised him lavishly.

2500|$|UCI {{director}} Pat McQuaid urged team {{directors and}} the riders to take responsibility: [...] "The teams {{need to have}} {{more control over their}} riders.."They are the ones who need to clean out the riders who are iffy, they need to ensure they can guarantee that everyone of their riders is riding clean and riding fairly. The evidence {{is that most of the}} time these riders are dealing with individuals from outside their team and the sport whether it be pseudo doctors and chemists who are promising <b>them</b> <b>things.</b> That has got to stop. More and more riders...are speaking out and it's the younger generation of riders coming in that are going to be the future of the sport. They have to come into a system that is completely ethically correct. But at the end of the day, the rider is the one who makes the decisions..We are in the process of changing that culture and it will change in time. We need to weed out the bad apples.
