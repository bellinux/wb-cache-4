40|$|Abstract—This {{study is}} to fill up a {{research}} gap on examining the differences in normative beliefs (namely <b>acceptance</b> <b>of</b> weaknesses, <b>acceptance</b> <b>of</b> provoked aggression, and <b>acceptance</b> <b>of</b> unprovoked aggression) among different subtypes of aggressors and non-aggressors (reactive aggressors, proactive aggressors, reactive-proactive aggressors, and non-aggressors). 2, 236 students (1, 372 males and 864 females), aged from 11 to 18, completed a self-reported questionnaire. Results revealed that (a) schoolchildren with reactive-proactive aggression have <b>the</b> highest <b>acceptance</b> <b>of</b> provoked aggression, <b>the</b> highest <b>acceptance</b> <b>of</b> unprovoked aggression, and <b>the</b> lowest <b>acceptance</b> <b>of</b> weakness; (b) schoolchildren with proactive aggression have higher <b>acceptance</b> <b>of</b> unprovoked aggression and lower <b>acceptance</b> <b>of</b> weakness than reactive aggressors; and (c) schoolchildren without aggression have <b>the</b> lowest <b>acceptance</b> <b>of</b> provoked aggression, <b>the</b> lowest <b>acceptance</b> <b>of</b> unprovoked aggression, and <b>the</b> highest <b>acceptance</b> <b>of</b> weakness.

However, <b>the</b> user <b>acceptance</b> <b>of</b> m-commerce is below expectation (Harris et al., 2005). Researches <b>of</b> <b>the</b> user <b>acceptance</b> <b>of</b> m-commerce have proven the positive user adoption determinants based on <b>the</b> user <b>acceptance</b> models <b>of</b> information systems (IS), but only few explore the negative adoption factors. This paper extends <b>the</b> unified theory <b>of</b> <b>acceptance</b> and use <b>of</b> technology (UTAUT) model {{for the study of}} the negative emotion and behaviour that affects <b>the</b> user <b>acceptance</b> <b>of</b> m-commerce. <b>The</b> extended UTAUT model aims to help m-commerce service providers to understand both the positive and negative factors that can significantly explain user adoption intention and use behaviour so that they can adjust their strategies for providing successful m-commerce services. It also provides an extended base for further research on <b>the</b> user <b>acceptance</b> models <b>of</b> new IS. ...|$|R
5|$|The {{first major}} sign of dissent {{occurred}} in 1989 when a WCG minister, Gerald Flurry, published a manuscript outlining {{what he and}} others believed were disturbing trends in the work, including {{the beginnings of the}} doctrinal departure from what had been established by Armstrong. Flurry and another minister, John Amos, were disfellowshipped and went on to form the Philadelphia Church of God (PCG). The PCG began an alternative radio program and magazine, and {{over the next several years}} a few thousand WCG members left to join the PCG. Despite this, Tkach continued to implement additional changes in thinking including: the shift in emphasis away from observing world events primarily through the lens of prophetic interpretation; the removal of the prohibition of interracial marriage; the allowance of work on the Sabbath; <b>the</b> <b>acceptance</b> <b>of</b> the trinitarian doctrine; and <b>the</b> <b>acceptance</b> <b>of</b> the validity of other Christian denominations, among many other changes. Older Armstrong publications that supported the church's once unique doctrines were allowed to go out-of-print.|$|E
5|$|Argentina {{was still}} {{divided by the}} {{aftermath}} of the Dirty War. Menem proposed an agenda of national reconciliation. First, he arranged the repatriation of the body of Juan Manuel de Rosas, a controversial 19th century governor, and proposed to reconcile his legacy with those of Bartolomé Mitre and Domingo Faustino Sarmiento, who also fought in the Argentine Civil Wars. Menem intended to use the reconciliation of these historical Argentine figures {{as a metaphor for the}} reconciliation of the Dirty War. However, although the repatriation and acceptance of Rosas was a success, <b>the</b> <b>acceptance</b> <b>of</b> the military regime was not.|$|E
5|$|At {{the start}} of the 20th century, {{physicians}} thought low back pain was caused by inflammation of or damage to the nerves, with neuralgia and neuritis frequently mentioned by them in the medical literature of the time. The popularity of such proposed causes decreased during the 20th century. In the early 20th century, American neurosurgeon Harvey Williams Cushing increased <b>the</b> <b>acceptance</b> <b>of</b> surgical treatments for low back pain. In the 1920s and 1930s, new theories of the cause arose, with physicians proposing a combination of nervous system and psychological disorders such as nerve weakness (neurasthenia) and female hysteria. Muscular rheumatism (now called fibromyalgia) was also cited with increasing frequency.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. We {{continue}} the work initiated in [1 – 3], where <b>the</b> <b>acceptance</b> logic, a modal logic for modelling {{individual and collective}} acceptances was introduced. This logic is aimed at capturing <b>the</b> concept <b>of</b> <b>acceptance</b> qua member <b>of</b> an institution {{as the kind of}} attitude that agents are committed to when they are “functioning as members <b>of</b> an institution”. <b>Acceptance</b> logic {{can also be used to}} model judgement aggregation: it deals with how a collective <b>acceptance</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> members of an institution about a certain fact ϕ is created from <b>the</b> individual <b>acceptances</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> members of the institution. The contribution of this paper is to present a tableau method for <b>the</b> logic <b>of</b> <b>acceptance.</b> <b>The</b> method automatically decides whether a formula <b>of</b> <b>the</b> logic <b>of</b> <b>acceptance</b> is satisfiable thereby providing an automated reasoning procedure for judgement aggregation in <b>the</b> logic <b>of</b> <b>acceptance.</b> Key words: Semantic tableaux method, acceptance logic, judgement aggregation, discursive dilemma...|$|R

5|$|Behavioral therapy may {{be useful}} for chronic pain. There are several types available, {{including}} operant conditioning, which uses reinforcement to reduce undesirable behaviors and increase desirable behaviors; cognitive behavioral therapy, which helps people identify and correct negative thinking and behavior; and respondent conditioning, which can modify an individual's physiological response to pain. Medical providers may develop an integrated program of behavioral therapies. The evidence is inconclusive as to whether mindfulness-based stress reduction reduces chronic back pain intensity or associated disability, although it suggests that it {{may be useful}} in improving <b>the</b> <b>acceptance</b> <b>of</b> existing pain.|$|E

In protest, Zohgby resigned his position as patriarchal vicar of Alexandria. Maximos IV died in 1967; his successor, Maximos V Hakim, {{was a friend of}} Zoghby's and a fellow Egyptian. In August 1968 the Melkite Synod elected Zoghby archbishop of Baalbek to replace the recently deceased eparch, Joseph Malouf. Installed as archbishop there on September 9, 1968, he led the small eparchy during the Lebanese Civil War. In 1982 he was kidnapped by pro-Iranian terrorists.|$|E

In 1524, the French astronomer Oronce Finé constructed an ivory sundial, which still exists; later, in 1570, the Italian astronomer Giovanni Padovani published a treatise including instructions for the manufacture and laying out of mural (vertical) and horizontal sundials. Similarly, Giuseppe Biancani's Constructio instrumenti ad horologia solaria (c.1620) discusses how to construct sundials.|$|E

To address this problem, we introduce <b>the</b> input <b>acceptance</b> <b>of</b> a TM as its ability to commit transactions, we upper-bound <b>the</b> input <b>acceptance</b> <b>of</b> existing TMs and propose a new TM with higher input acceptance...|$|R

However, Arab states of the Persian Gulf—Arafat's usual source for financial backing—still refused to provide him and the PLO with any major donations for siding with Iraq during the 1991 Gulf War.

5|$|The {{eighteenth century}} saw the {{beginnings}} of a fragmentation of the Church of Scotland that had its foundation in the Reformation.

Ecclesiastical patronage, the right of local lairds or other notables to appoint ministers to a parish, had been abolished at the Glorious Revolution, but it was reintroduced in the Patronage Act of 1711, resulting in frequent protests from the kirk.|$|E
