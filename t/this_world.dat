5|$|Christian Analytic philosopher Alvin Plantinga criticized Malcolm's and Hartshorne's arguments, {{and offered}} an alternative. He argued that, if Malcolm does prove the {{necessary}} {{existence of the}} greatest possible being, it follows {{that there is a}} being which exists in all worlds whose greatness in some worlds is not surpassed. It does not, he argued, demonstrate that such a being has unsurpassed greatness in <b>this</b> <b>world.</b>|$|E

5|$|In {{contrast}} to the intense single character focus of his first novel, ¡Ecue-Yamba-O! (Praised Be the Lord!), Carpentier offers a diversified understanding of black society and its beliefs in The Kingdom of <b>This</b> <b>World.</b> There exists remarkable respect for accuracy on all sides including historical facts, character names, place names, and even street names. This adds to the key blend of marvellous fantasy and historical accuracy.|$|E

5|$|One {{common goal}} of early Daoism was to extend life by {{achieving}} immortality. The Celestial Masters believed {{that in order}} to achieve immortality, one was not supposed to extend life in the current world, but rather 'feign death' in <b>this</b> <b>world,</b> and be reborn on the other side. In order to feign death, an adept had to have perfectly harmonized internal spirits. When someone with refined internal spirits died in <b>this</b> <b>world,</b> their spirit would venture to the Palace of Grand Darkness where their form would be refined and then reborn in a perfected state on the other side. There are no surviving texts that describe what kind of place the 'other side' was. Those that failed to harmonize their internal spirits prior to death would be reborn in the underground earth-prisons, where they would be subject to eternal torment and toil.|$|E

5|$|The Kingdom of <b>This</b> <b>World</b> {{has a deep}} {{focus on}} the nature of revolution, and the novel itself {{can be viewed as a}} {{reflection}} of Carpentier's ideological perspective towards revolutions. Carpentier tries to establish the idea that a distinction must be made between revolutions and reactions. While a revolution produces progress, a reaction does not.|$|E
5|$|The Kingdom of <b>This</b> <b>World</b> is {{considered}} to be Alejo Carpentier's first great novel. He is praised for his skillful inclusion of Haitian voodoo, myth, and history in the work, as well as for contributing to the definition of Latin American identity. Although the presence of magic realism in The Kingdom of <b>This</b> <b>World</b> has been acclaimed by critics and discussed at length within the academic community, this concern is paralleled by a lack of interest in Carpentier's technical work in the novel. In particular, his vision of time has been widely ignored. The Kingdom of <b>This</b> <b>World</b> has also been criticized for its narrative organization, which predominantly relies on opposition rather than on succession: the novel does not present history in terms of a sequence of events and their consequences. The gaps within chronological time that occur throughout this novel as well as the sudden changes of perspective and minimal transitional narrative have led some to criticize the book for the chaotic first impression it gives the reader.|$|E
5|$|The {{brutality}} of the Spanish American dictatorship is omnipresent in The Kingdom of <b>This</b> <b>World</b> through the images of torture, fire, suppression, and hungry dogs for example. Carpentier's characters often find consolation in sexuality (which {{is closely related to}} the sadism of the violence theme) after experiencing violence.|$|E

50|$|The story {{takes place}} largely on Roanoke Island, which {{is governed by}} Ananias Dare. His {{daughter}} Virginia and Peter Parquagh (<b>this</b> <b>world's</b> Spider-Man) are fighting an invasion of dinosaurs, and tensions between the colonists and Native Americans are increasing, with Englishman Norman Osborne attempting to cheat the natives out of the island. Unrest about metahumans is also increasing, led by newspaperman J. Jonah Jameson. Osbourne is quick to blame this on the natives and Rojhaz (<b>this</b> <b>world's</b> Captain America).|$|R

5|$|The plot {{revolves}} around {{a teenage boy}} and his dog, to whom the player must assign names. Most of the game {{takes place in the}} fictional world of Evermore. The player explores four main areas within <b>this</b> <b>world,</b> corresponding to different historical eras: Prehistoria contains cavemen and dinosaurs; Antiqua boasts a Colosseum and pyramid theme; Gothica contains medieval castles and is populated by dragons; and Omnitopia is a futuristic space station.|$|E

Coincidentally, the losing manager in that year's World Series was Terry Francona, who had managed the Red Sox to both the 2004 and 2007 championships.|$|E

Dare touches the rift caused by Roger's arrival. She has the ability to transform into white-furred animals when frightened, which she later learns to control, and appears to be the equivalent to Alpha Flight's Snowbird who has a similar appearance and powers, though Neil Gaiman had denied this.|$|E
5|$|Written by David Wiltshire, {{this was}} an {{unsolicited}} script for a six-part story.

Wiltshire was never commissioned to develop the storyline further.|$|E
