5|$|Continued ingress {{of water}} from the roof and from unroofed {{exterior}} walkways above <b>the</b> <b>ceiling</b> level had caused seepage which carried down salts from the building mortar and deposited them on <b>the</b> <b>ceiling</b> through evaporation. In places this caused the surface of the frescoes to bubble and lift. Although discolouration was a serious problem, bubbling was not, because the thinness and transparency of the paint which Michelangelo employed on the greater part of <b>the</b> <b>ceiling</b> permitted the salts to pass through rather than accumulating beneath the surface.|$|E
5|$|That {{part of the}} {{restoration}} in the Sistine Chapel which has caused the most concern is <b>the</b> <b>ceiling,</b> painted by Michelangelo. The emergence of the brightly coloured Ancestors of Christ from the gloom sparked a reaction of fear that the processes being employed in the cleaning were too severe. Despite warnings, the work on <b>the</b> <b>ceiling</b> proceeded and, according to critics such as James Beck, their worst fears were confirmed once <b>the</b> <b>ceiling</b> was completed.|$|E

5|$|The Sistine Chapel is 40.9metres {{long and}} 14metres wide. <b>The</b> <b>ceiling</b> rises to 13.4metres above {{the main floor}} of the chapel. The vault is of quite a complex design and it is {{unlikely}} that it was originally intended to have such elaborate decoration. Pier Matteo d'Amelia provided a plan for its decoration with the architectural elements picked out and <b>the</b> <b>ceiling</b> painted blue and dotted with gold stars, {{similar to that of the}} Arena Chapel decorated by Giotto at Padua.|$|E
5|$|The {{iconography}} of <b>the</b> <b>ceiling</b> has had various interpretations in the past, {{some elements of}} which have been contradicted by modern scholarship. Others, such as the identity of the figures in the lunettes and spandrels, continue to defy interpretation. Modern scholars have sought, as yet unsuccessfully, to determine a written source of the theological program of <b>the</b> <b>ceiling</b> and have questioned {{whether or not it was}} entirely devised by the artist himself, who was both an avid reader of the Bible and a genius. Also of interest to some modern scholars is the question of how Michelangelo's own spiritual and psychological state is reflected in the iconography and the expression of <b>the</b> <b>ceiling.</b> One such speculation is that Michelangelo was tormented by conflict between homosexual desires and passionate Christian beliefs.|$|E
5|$|Their {{painting}} demonstrates, {{more than}} any other figures on <b>the</b> <b>ceiling,</b> Michelangelo's mastery of anatomy and foreshortening and his enormous powers of invention. In their reflection of classical antiquity they resonate with Pope Julius' aspirations to lead Italy towards a new 'age of gold'; at the same time, they staked Michelangelo's claim to greatness. However, a number of critics were angered by their presence and nudity, including Pope Adrian VI who wanted <b>the</b> <b>ceiling</b> stripped.|$|E

5|$|Because of {{the height}} of <b>the</b> <b>ceiling</b> and the inaccessibility of <b>the</b> <b>ceiling</b> frescoes, the precise nature of the damage and the {{problems}} that would be encountered by the restoration team could not be entirely foreseen until after the decision to restore was taken, and the scaffolding was in place. According to Colalucci, the continued scientific analysis and {{the response of the}} restorers to the particular problems was an ongoing part of the process, rather than the conservation team deciding on a single treatment for every part of the building.|$|E

5|$|Between 1710 and 1713 {{a further}} {{restoration}} {{was carried out}} by the painter Annibale Mazzuoli and his son. They used sponges dipped in Greek wine which Colalucci suggests was necessitated by the accretion of grime caused by soot and dirt trapped in the oily deposits of the previous restoration. Mazzuoli then worked over <b>the</b> <b>ceiling,</b> according to Colalucci, strengthening the contrasts by overpainting details. They also repainted some areas the colours of which were lost because of the efflorescence of salts. Areas of repainting were hatched or treated with a linear brushstroke. Colalucci states that Mazzuoli also applied a great deal of glue varnish. The restoration concentrated on <b>the</b> <b>ceiling</b> and less attention was paid to the lunettes.|$|E

5|$|Following {{his success}} in Sydney, Jackson was tapped to direct the audio design and {{production}} at the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, where he directed the opening ceremony and the closing ceremony. His sound design for BC Place Stadium did not have loudspeakers at ground level aimed up at the seating areasâ€”Jackson determined that this approach would produce too much uncontrolled reverberation from sound waves bouncing off <b>the</b> <b>ceiling.</b> Instead, he configured two rings of loudspeakers hung from <b>the</b> <b>ceiling</b> 100ft (30m) above the ground, aimed downward. The inner ring held 8 arrays each composed of 12 Clair Brothers i3 line array speakers and the outer ring held 12 arrays of 7 Clair Brothers i3 line array speakers, augmented by 16 subwoofers. The lot was powered by 160 Lab.gruppen amplifiers which were also hung from <b>the</b> <b>ceiling,</b> and were networked via Dante in a triple-redundant configuration. Two DiGiCo D5 digital mixing consoles served as main and backup for the main audience sound, and two Yamaha PM1Ds handled main and backup duties for monitor mixing. Other equipment included dual-redundant Optocore fibre connections, two Dolby Lake Processors, and time code generated by two pairs of Fairlights which also handled audio cues timed to the action on the field.|$|E
5|$|For {{the central}} section of <b>the</b> <b>ceiling,</b> Michelangelo has taken four episodes {{from the story}} of Adam and Eve as told in the first, second and third {{chapters}} of Genesis. In this sequence of three, two of the panels are large and one small.|$|E
5|$|If {{the temple}} is small it {{will consist of}} only a closed mantapa (enclosed with walls {{extending}} {{all the way to}} <b>the</b> <b>ceiling)</b> and the shrine. The closed mantapa, well decorated inside and out, is larger than the vestibule connecting the shrine and the mantapa and has four lathe-turned pillars to support <b>the</b> <b>ceiling,</b> which may be deeply domed. The four pillars divide the hall into nine bays. The nine bays result in nine decorated ceilings. Pierced stone screens (Jali or Latticework) that serve as windows in the navaranga (hall) and Sabhamantapa (congregation hall) is a characteristic Hoysala stylistic element.|$|E

5|$|In {{the same}} year 1506, Pope Julius {{conceived}} a program to paint <b>the</b> <b>ceiling</b> of the Sistine Chapel. The walls of the chapel had been decorated twenty years earlier. The lowest of three levels is painted to resemble draped hangings and was (and sometimes still is) hung on special occasions with the set of tapestries designed by Raphael. The middle level contains a complex scheme of frescoes illustrating the Life of Christ {{on the right side}} and the Life of Moses on the left side. It was carried out by some of the most renowned Renaissance painters: Botticelli, Ghirlandaio, Perugino, Pinturicchio, Signorelli and Cosimo Rosselli. The upper level of the walls contains the windows, between which are painted pairs of illusionistic niches with representations of the first thirty-two popes. A draft by Matteo d'Amelia indicates that <b>the</b> <b>ceiling</b> was painted blue like that of the Arena Chapel and decorated with gold stars, possibly representing the zodiacal constellations. It is probable that, because the chapel was the site of regular meetings and Masses of an elite body of officials known as the Papal Chapel who would observe the decorations and interpret their theological and temporal significance, it was Pope Julius' intention and expectation that the iconography of <b>the</b> <b>ceiling</b> was to be read with many layers of meaning.|$|E
5|$|On February 28, 2001, the Nisqually {{earthquake}} {{rocked the}} 5th Avenue Theatre. At the time, actors were on stage rehearsing the musical 1776. The theatre suffered minimal damages with no structural {{damage from the}} quake. Earthquake repairs included removal and replacement of 72 plaster ceiling supports and the repair of numerous cracks and damaged decorative plaster pieces in <b>the</b> <b>ceiling.</b> Contractors had to install scaffolding tall enough to reach the highest interior crevice in <b>the</b> <b>ceiling</b> eight stories upâ€”the first time that area had been reached in 75 years. The chandeliers had to be lowered for repair and maintenance. As part of the repair work, Turner Construction provided services for seismic upgrades to the Skinner Building.|$|E
