500|$|Several of Jackson's songs {{have been}} leaked onto the Internet without gaining an {{official}} release. One example involved the song [...] "A Place with No Name", a 24-second snippet {{of which was}} leaked by website TMZ.com following Jackson's death in 2009. At {{the time of the}} leak, it was claimed that there were [...] "hundreds" [...] of unreleased songs by the musician, and that they could be issued for several years to come. Commenting on the subject, the curator of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, Jim Henke, noted that any future releases would garner significant attention. [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> to see amazing interest in any released Michael Jackson material that will come out in the future or a year from now on." [...] On March 16, 2010, Sony Music Entertainment signed a record-breaking $250million deal with Jackson's estate to retain distribution rights to his recordings until 2017 and release ten posthumous albums—some of which will feature unreleased material—over the next decade.|$|E
500|$|In June 2009, singer Michael Jackson {{died at the}} age of 50 {{following}} cardiac arrest. Three {{weeks after}} Jackson's death, celebrity news website TMZ.com (who were the first media outlet to report his death) obtained a 24-second snippet of a song entitled [...] "A Place with No Name", and released it on the Internet. At the time of the leak [...] there were news reports that there was a [...] "vast vault" [...] and [...] "dozens and dozens" [...] of unreleased Jackson songs that could be issued for several years to come. The curator of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, Jim Henke, commented that any future Jackson releases would receive a significant amount of attention, stating, [...] "What we have seen happen in the last three weeks is that the albums that are out here right now are selling in amazing numbers. I <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> to see amazing interest in any released Michael Jackson material that will come out in the future or a year from now on." ...|$|E
2500|$|It's getting bad, Dad. [...] A {{stewardess}} was stabbed. [...] They {{seem to have}} {{knives and}} Mace. [...] They said they have a bomb. [...] It's getting very bad on the plane. The plane is making jerky movements. I don't think the pilot is flying the plane. [...] I <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> down. I think they intend to go to Chicago or someplace and fly into a building. Don't worry, Dad. [...] If it happens, it'll be very fast...Oh my God...oh my God, oh my God." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But {{suppose there}} shouldn't be any men there, Bob, and <b>we</b> should <b>be</b> {{caught in the}} grounds; They would <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> to steal something." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "My! what a crowd!" [...] exclaimed Tom, as he {{surveyed}} the multitude. [...] "I didn't <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> to have such an audience as this!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "One would <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> {{to travel}} {{for a month}} in some wilderness, to judge from the weight of our haversacks," [...] {{observed}} Wallace, after trudging along for some time in silence.|$|R
2500|$|Moffat {{had always}} {{intended}} for Amy and Rory {{to get married}} [...] "from the off". Gillan stated, [...] "What I love about that relationship is that we really saw it develop {{to get to the}} stage where they were happy together. Because we started off at a point where Amy didn't want to be committed to him, and he absolutely did, and that just gave us somewhere to go with it, rather than just them being happy together. So it was interesting, and it evolved, and Rory really became a hero in the process". She was pleased that the audience was able to see Amy's life [...] "pan out", starting {{when she was a child}} and through her marriage and daughter. Gillan stated that the aftermath of [...] "A Good Man Goes to War" [...] would [...] "change her in a big way for the long run and I <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> to get to see Amy in a really different light". According to Moffat, by the seventh series, Amy and Rory had become [...] "a crack team"; so used to being the Doctor's companions that instead of marvelling at him they [...] "treat him like a big kid they have to look after".|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{think you}} are the one who is fresh!" [...] {{retorted}} Tom. [...] "Do you <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> to train with such fellows as you? Not much!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "If you <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> {{to live on}} that scale," [...] I said, {{looking at}} the table with an irritated eye, [...] "you are jolly well mistaken." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "In any case, it isn't {{my job to}} {{talk about}} it," [...] Baring {{continued}} apologetically. [...] "We've just {{got a lot of}} fresh regulations out. Any one would <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> to war to-morrow." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I guess I {{can explain}} that," [...] said Ben. [...] "I {{was talking to}} my cousin about it, down at the drug store. Just as <b>we</b> <b>were</b> coming out, after having some soda, I saw Nat {{behind one of the}} partitions. He must have heard all we said, and I suppose it made him mad to <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> to have a good time, and that he wouldn't be in it." ...|$|R
5000|$|... "it's so difficult. We've {{got this}} amazing A-list cast, and Harold Pinter adapted it. But {{the problem is}} no one really wants to do film of Shakespeare at the moment. It's expensive. Everyone says 'Well, you know, it's a tragedy...' In fact my {{favourite}} comment on this script was 'it's very downbeat...' And I said, It was a tragedy to begin with!!! I mean did you <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> to re-write {{it and make it}} a comedy?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> {{to have a}} fine trip over," [...] {{said the}} senator's son, {{on the evening of}} the second day. [...] "Don't you think so, Dave?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Things {{are looking}} up," [...] cried the Colonel. [...] "By George, I <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> {{to come through}} all right. The Gippy Camel Corps are hot on our trail." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Far from it," [...] replied Barney. [...] "Bring your {{rope and}} the swords. I <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> {{to find the}} rescuing of the Princess Emma the easiest part of our adventure." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Now, Frank," [...] said he, {{when his}} mirth was {{somewhat}} appeased, [...] "it's your turn. Here's my hand. Good-bye; farewell!" [...] Then, seeing me stand rigid and indignant, and holding Clara to my side--"Man!" [...] he broke out, [...] "are you angry? Did you <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> {{to die with}} all the airs and graces of society? I took a kiss; I'm glad I had it; and now you can take another if you like, and square accounts." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I <b>think</b> <b>we</b> must <b>be</b> <b>going</b> back now," [...] {{said the}} widow timidly, {{withdrawing}} her hand, which Blair had again mysteriously got possession of in her confusion.|$|R
5000|$|On November 6, 1976, the 64-member {{board of}} {{directors}} of the NAACP elected Hooks executive director of the organization. In the late 1970s the membership had declined from a high of about 500,000 to only about 200,000. Hooks was determined to add to the enrollment and to raise money for the organization’s severely depleted treasury, without changing the NAACP’s goals or mandates. [...] "Black Americans are not defeated," [...] he told Ebony soon after his formal induction in 1977. [...] "The civil rights movement is not dead. If anyone <b>thinks</b> that <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> to stop agitating, they had better think again. If anyone <b>thinks</b> that <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> to stop litigating, they had better close the courts. If anyone <b>thinks</b> that <b>we</b> <b>are</b> not <b>going</b> to demonstrate and protest, they had better roll up the sidewalks." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It will be--trust my Uncle Dunston for that," [...] {{answered}} Dave. [...] "My, but isn't it jolly to <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> back {{to school}} in the auto instead of by train!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Do {{you know}} what I think?" [...] said Songbird, who stood at the stern looking toward the distant hills. [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> to have more wind than we'll want before night." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> to {{have some}} good times while {{we are on the}} Pacific coast," [...] {{observed}} Tom Rover, while he and Sam were waiting for Dick and the cabman to return.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Glad to meet her, I am sure,' Mr. Murdoch said, with a humility {{altogether}} {{uncommon to}} him. 'I am {{very glad to}} <b>think</b> that <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> to travel together, Miss Myrtle.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, love, {{unless one}} dreams. Well, I think that I must have dreamt. What was the dream now? Rachel weeping--Rachel weeping--my love, I <b>think</b> that <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> to live here, and I think--I think----" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You may {{do as you}} like," [...] Mrs. Doolan said indignantly; [...] "but if you <b>think</b> that <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> to do {{anything}} so cruel and unjust, you are entirely mistaken, I can tell you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Don't take on, Sadie," [...] {{said her}} aunt; [...] "remember what the {{minister}} said just now, {{that we are}} all right there in the hollow of God's hand. Where do you <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>going,</b> Mr. Stephens?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No, but I don't <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> to get lost. What place do {{you call}} this?" [...] the eldest Rover continued, {{thinking}} to ask some questions himself, and thus keep the fellow from becoming too inquisitive.|$|E
6000|$|She {{reached out}} her little gloved hand, and as Mose took it her eyes searched his face. [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> to be friends." [...] Her voice was affectedly musical as she added: [...] "Come and see me, won't you?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You look pale," [...] {{the sister}} said, [...] "and your hand {{is hot and}} feverish. I will send you up some tisane. It is the heat, no doubt. I <b>think</b> that <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> to have thunder." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I do not <b>think</b> that <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> {{to fight}} the Genoese galleys," [...] Francis answered. [...] "Certainly we shall not do so if we can help it. They are vastly {{stronger}} than we are; but I {{do not know that}} we need fear them for all that." ...|$|R
5000|$|The Queen's Plate was Scatter the Gold's {{first win}} and fifth start. Because of his winless record and {{his lack of}} recent racing experience, the colt was not {{expected}} to be a serious contender. However, he won by 4-1/4 lengths after passing the frontrunners near the eighth post. In the Prince of Wales Stakes, he had such a poor start that his jockey feared he may have grabbed a quarter, and he was fourth of seven horses {{at the top of the}} final stretch. Nevertheless, he overtook all three leaders to win the race by a neck. Kabel later remarked, [...] "He had me pretty worried. I didn't <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> to get any part of it until down the backside he started to run hard".|$|R
6000|$|... "I <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> {{to have a}} good time," [...] one of {{the others}} said as they went forward. [...] "We ain't likely to capture {{anything}} very big in this cockle-shell, and I look upon it as a sort of pleasure ship." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{certainly}} is very handy," [...] said Peter politely. [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> {{to have more}} rain, and I'd better be {{getting back to the}} dear Old Briarpatch. Very much obliged to you, Mr. Toad. I think you are very wonderful." ...|$|E
6000|$|For {{half an hour}} {{they walked}} on in silence, then Hugh said, [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>going</b> wrong, Master Rupert, for we are not {{descending}} now; {{and we ought to}} have been {{at the foot of the}} hill, if we had been right, by this time." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Where <b>think</b> {{you that}} <b>we</b> <b>are</b> <b>going,</b> Roger? I {{will give you}} fifty guesses, and would warrant {{that you would not}} come at the truth." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "'Will,' Greta--'will'; {{how often}} must I tell you? I <b>think</b> <b>we</b> should <b>be</b> going--it is very late--your father--so {{very kind of}} you, but I <b>think</b> <b>we</b> should <b>be</b> <b>going.</b> Scruff!" [...] Miss Naylor gave the floor two taps. The terrier backed into a plaster cast which came down on his tail, and sent him flying through the doorway. Greta {{followed}} swiftly, crying: ...|$|R
6000|$|Supper was over, {{and most}} of the people in the village <b>were</b> {{thinking}} of <b>going</b> to bed, when Abner said to Mary, [...] "Let us each take a spade, and I will carry a pail, and we will go out upon the beach for a walk. If any one should see us, they would <b>think</b> that <b>we</b> <b>were</b> <b>going</b> to dig for clams." ...|$|R
