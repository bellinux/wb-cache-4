This all contributed to ASL's wide use over a large geographical area, atypical of a sign language.|$|E

5|$|Between 1916—when the {{university}} introduced a Doctorate of Philosophy for research—and 1939, {{there were few}} post-graduate students, and {{only one or two}} undergraduates took Arabic in final examinations each year. The subject grew in popularity after the Second World War: Gibb had an international reputation <b>that</b> <b>attracted</b> foreign students, while others from the United Kingdom who had spent time in the Middle East during the war were interested in studying Arabic language and culture. Julia Bray, the current holder , was appointed in 2012. She is the 15th Laudian Professor, and the first woman to hold the position.

5|$|Between 1996 and 1999, the {{administration}} added crucifixes to many classroom walls, a change <b>that</b> <b>attracted</b> national attention. Before 1996, crucifixes had hung only in hospital rooms and historic classrooms. Some of these crucifixes are historic works of art, and are noted as such. According to Imam Yahya Hendi, the school's on-campus Muslim cleric, pressure {{to remove the}} crucifixes comes from within the Catholic community, while he and other campus faith leaders have defended their placement. The Intercultural Center is an exception to this controversy, rotating displays of various faith and culture symbols in the lobby. In 2009, Georgetown's religious symbols were brought back to national attention after the university administration concealed the name of Jesus in preparation for President Barack Obama's speech on campus.|$|E
5|$|By {{the second}} half of the eighteenth century, the abbey, by then {{partially}} roofless and overgrown with trees and ivy, had become a famous ruin <b>that</b> <b>attracted</b> the attention of artists, dramatists and poets. In the nineteenth century, Netley became a popular tourist attraction (the novelist Jane Austen was among those who visited) and steps were taken to conserve the ruins. Archaeological excavations directed by Charles Pink and Reverend Edmund Kell took place in 1860. During the same period the owners decided to remove many of the Tudor additions to the building to create a more medieval feel to the site, resulting in the loss of much evidence of the abbey's post-Dissolution story.|$|E

Southern Unitarianism was generally less organized than the variety popular in New England. He was generally not outspoken about his religious beliefs.

In 1955, new geography rooms were constructed, followed three years later by a new gymnasium. Although not first used until two years later, a swimming pool was constructed in 1964 at the cost of £9,000.

5|$|Nasib {{attended}} Maktab Anbar, a preparatory {{school in}} Damascus <b>that</b> <b>attracted</b> {{the children of}} the elite and produced several future Arab nationalists.
