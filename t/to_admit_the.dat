5|$|It is {{not clear}} whether the members of the Ministerium {{intended}} for this to be a permanent break, or a temporary protest. Regardless, it became permanent when the officials at the next Gathering of the General Synod refused <b>to</b> <b>admit</b> <b>the</b> delegates from the Ministerium. Thus, the Ministerium found themselves on their own.|$|E

Jedburgh, under orders from the CIA, enters the hot cell and steals the plutonium.

5|$|The block {{voting system}} was used, with each peer casting as many votes {{as there were}} seats to be filled. The system, however, {{permitted}} the party with {{the greatest number of}} peers, normally the Conservatives, to procure a disproportionate number of seats, with opposing parties sometimes being left entirely unrepresented. The Lord Clerk Register was responsible for tallying the votes. The return issued by the Lord Clerk Register was sufficient evidence <b>to</b> <b>admit</b> <b>the</b> representative peers to Parliament; however, unlike other peers, Scottish representatives did not receive writs of summons.|$|E

5|$|The Actor Rebellion of 1733 was {{an event}} that {{took place at the}} Theatre Royal, Drury Lane in London, England when the actors who worked there, disapproving of the changes in the management, {{attempted}} to seize control. Before the rebellion, the theatre was controlled by the managers Theophilus Cibber, John Ellys, and John Highmore. When Theophilus lost his share and was denied a bid to run the theatre, he, along with other actors, attempted to take over the theatre by controlling the lease. When the shareholders found out, they refused <b>to</b> <b>admit</b> <b>the</b> actors to the building and the theatre was closed for several months. The fight spilled over to the contemporary newspapers, which generally sided with the managers.|$|E
5|$|The Union Greenback {{convention}} had reconvened {{at nearby}} Farwell Hall and sent an emissary to the National Greenbackers. The delegates voted {{to join the}} other faction in a special conference committee to work for reunification, then adjourned until 7:30 that evening. While {{they waited for the}} committees to finish their work, the delegates listened to speeches by several prominent Greenbackers, including Denis Kearney, a California labor leader, and William Wallace, a Canadian parliamentarian and advocate for currency reform. Meanwhile, the Credentials Committee voted narrowly <b>to</b> <b>admit</b> <b>the</b> Union Greenbackers, as well as a delegation from the Socialist Labor Party. The Committee on Permanent Organization voted to recommend Richard F. Trevellick, a Michigan trade union organizer, as the permanent chairman of the convention. None of the reports were finished by the appointed time, so the convention adjourned again until 10:45 Thursday morning.|$|E
5|$|Years go by as Scar squanders the kingdom's {{resources}} and allows his army of hyenas to wreak havoc upon the Pride Lands, which turn barren. Meanwhile, an alive and adult Simba is visited by Mufasa's ghost, who encourages {{him to return}} to the Pride Lands and take his rightful place as king. Aided by his friends Nala, Timon and Pumbaa, Simba arrives at Pride Rock and witnesses Scar striking his mother Sarabi and confronts Scar, who demands that Simba admit to the pride that he killed Mufasa. As he prepares to throw Simba off Pride Rock and have him meet a similar fate to that of his father, Scar whispers that {{he was the one who}} killed Mufasa. Enraged, Simba tackles Scar and forces his uncle <b>to</b> <b>admit</b> <b>the</b> truth to the pride, initiating a ferocious battle between the pride, Timon, Pumbaa, Zazu, Rafiki and Scar's hyenas. Scar tries to escape, but is cornered by Simba on the top of Pride Rock; Scar begs for mercy and even attempts to blame his crimes on the hyenas, unaware that they are listening nearby. Simba ignores Scar and gives him one last chance to run away and never return. When Simba's back is turned, Scar attacks him and they fight. Simba bests Scar in combat and throws him over the cliff edge and into a pit. Scar survives the fall, but is attacked and killed by the vengeful hyenas.|$|E

25|$|By 1911, {{almost half}} of the Japanese {{immigrants}} were women who landed in the U.S. to reunite with their husbands. After the Gentleman's agreement, a number of Nisei, the second-generation Japanese, were born in California. Yet, it did not stop some white Americans from segregating Japanese immigrants. The Issei were a role model of American citizens by being hardworking, law-abiding, devoted to family and the community. However, some Americans did not want <b>to</b> <b>admit</b> <b>the</b> virtues of the Issei.|$|E
25|$|Running {{the length}} of the {{northern}} side of the southern garden wall to the east and west of the great gate are galleried arcades.

25|$|The idea of {{emptiness}} {{as lack of}} inherent existence has {{very little to do}} with what the Buddha himself said about emptiness. His teachings on emptiness — as reported in the earliest Buddhist texts, the Pali Canon — deal directly with actions and their results, with issues of pleasure and pain. To understand and experience emptiness in line with these teachings requires not philosophical sophistication, but a personal integrity willing <b>to</b> <b>admit</b> <b>the</b> actual motivations behind your actions and the actual benefits and harm they cause.|$|E
25|$|The Oilers {{lost most}} of the players from 1978–79 when the NHL held a {{reclamation}} draft of players who had bolted to the upstart league as they were allowed to protect two goaltenders and two skill players. Originally, Gretzky was not eligible to be protected; under the rules of the time, he normally would have been placed in the Entry Draft pool. However, Pocklington had signed him to a 21-year personal services contract in 1979 and Pocklington used the contract to force the NHL <b>to</b> <b>admit</b> <b>the</b> Oilers and allow the Oilers to keep Gretzky.|$|E

50|$|Undergraduate Admission {{is highly}} selective, having an {{acceptance}} rate of approximately 25%.

However, being <b>admitted</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> university doesn't assure admission to a chosen departmental program, or major. In 2007, only 60% of those <b>admitted</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> university got accepted into their chosen major.

25|$|Peters was {{recalled}} to Berlin {{and employed}} in the Imperial Colonial Office from 1893 to 1895, while official accusations were brought against him of excesses in regard to his treatment of the native population. In a session of the Reichstag on 13 March 1896 August Bebel, chairman of the Social Democratic Party, finally made the killings public, citing from a self-exculpatory letter by Peters to Bishop Alfred Tucker. Peters denied {{the authenticity of the}} letter but had <b>to</b> <b>admit</b> <b>the</b> executions. After three investigations he was, during 1897, dishonorably deprived of his commission for misuse of official power, losing all his pension benefits.|$|E
25|$|The Van Wickle Gates, {{dedicated}} on June 18, 1901, have a pair {{of smaller}} side gates that are open year-round, and a large central gate that is opened two days a year for Convocation and Commencement. At Convocation the gate opens inward <b>to</b> <b>admit</b> <b>the</b> procession of new students. At Commencement the gate opens outward for the procession of graduates. A Brown superstition is that students who walk through the central gate a second time prematurely will not graduate, although walking backwards is said to cancel the hex. Members of the Brown University Band famously flout the superstition by walking through the gate three times too many, as they annually play {{their role in the}} Commencement parade.|$|E
