50|$|Sunflowers {{were the}} {{earliest}} crop planted in spring. Sunflowers were planted in clumps {{around the edges}} of fields. Maize was next planted. Indian planting techniques are called Three Sisters agriculture. About five seeds were sown in a low mound of soil. The mounds were spaced about five feet apart. When the maize plants were a few inches high, climbing beans and squash seeds were planted between the mounds. The large squash leaves shaded the soil, preserving moisture and crowding out weeds. The beans fixed nitrogen in the soil and climbed up the corn stalks as support. The Wichita, and possibly other southern peoples, planted or <b>tended</b> <b>thickets</b> <b>of</b> low-growing Chickasaw Plum trees separating and bordering their maize fields. Tobacco was planted in separate fields and tended by old men. Women did most of the other farming, although men assisted in clearing land.|$|R

40|$|We {{present the}} {{approach}} and {{results of an}} intuitive, expert-based mapping exercise to identify subtropical thicket (including Acocks’ (1953) Valley Bushveld, Noorsveld and Spekboomveld) vegetation types as features for conservation planning. The study area comprised 105 500 km 2 in southern and south-eastern South Africa, the planning domain for the Subtropical Thicket Ecosystem Planning (STEP) Project. We developed a four-tier typological hierarchy based on geography, floristics, structure and grain. This yielded 112 unique thicket vegetation types, 78 <b>of</b> which comprised <b>thicket</b> clumps in a matrix of non-thicket vegetation (mosaics). By identifying mosaics, we expanded the subtropical thicket concept and increased its extent {{in the study area}} by between 1. 8 and 2. 8 times that of earlier assessments. We also compiled a list of plant species that yielded a rich flora of 1 558 species, 20 % of which are endemic to our expanded thicket biome. Consistent with previous studies, endemics were strongly associated with succulent members of the Aizoaceae, Asphodelaceae, Euphorbiaceae, Apocynaceae and Crassulaceae. We discuss our results in terms of Acocks’ (1953) typology {{as well as those of}} more recent treatments, and comment on the evolution <b>of</b> subtropical <b>thicket</b> vegetation.

40|$|Subtropical {{transitional}} thicket, traditionally {{known as}} valley bushveld, covers {{a significant proportion}} of the eastern Cape. This paper attempts to classify the subtropical transitional thicket into syntaxonomic and structural units and relate it to other thicket types on a continental basis. Twelve sites along a rainfall gradient were sampled for floristic and structural attributes. The floristic data were classified using TWINSPAN. Results indicate that the class subtropical transitional thicket has at least two orders of vegetation, namely kaffrarian thicket and kaffrarian succulent <b>thicket.</b> Two forms <b>of</b> <b>thicket</b> were recognized for both these orders viz. mesic kaffrarian thicket and xeric kaffrarian thicket for the kaffrarian thicket and mesic succulent thicket and xeric succulent thicket for the kaffrarian succulent <b>thicket.</b> Ordination <b>of</b> site data by DECORANA grouped sites according to these vegetation categories and in a sequence along axis 1 to which the rainfall gradient can be clearly related. Variation within the mesic kaffrarian thicket was however greater than between some <b>of</b> the other <b>thicket</b> types, indicating that more data are required before these forms <b>of</b> <b>thicket</b> can be formalized. Composition, endemism, diversity and the environmental controls on the distribution <b>of</b> the <b>thicket</b> types are discussed...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the {{influence}} of edaphic conditions on the spatial structure <b>of</b> banded <b>thickets</b> or tiger bush (brousse tigrée). It is based on two sites in West Africa, with similar climatic conditions but located on contrasting substrates. The spatial structure was described with standardized characteristics including thicket spacing, thicket/inter-thicket contrast, upslope/downslope asymmetry and species zonation throughout the vegetation band. Recruitment and senescence features of woody stands were emphasized {{in order to understand}} current dynamics. Data were collected on transects oriented perpendicular to the contours and so to the thickets as well. A standardized analytical procedure was applied to data from both sites to ensure consistent and thorough delineation <b>of</b> <b>thickets.</b> The overall periodicity <b>of</b> <b>thickets,</b> the woody flora and the dominant species #Combretum micranthum$ were similar at the two sites. However, thicket spacing, thicket/inter-thicket contrast and upslope/downslope floristic asymmetry <b>of</b> the <b>thickets</b> were higher in the less favourable site. Also seedlings were less abundant, with a greater dependence on pre-existing thickets. Not all banded vegetation systems show sharp contrasts and are strongly asymmetric, since such characteristics are likely to be reinforced by adverse environmental conditions. As a consequence, current dynamics may be more diverse than expected. Quantified inter-sites comparisons can greatly help to classify African banded vegetation systems and to discuss potential dynamic outcomes. (Résumé d'auteur...|$|R

40|$|The {{origin and}} affinities of {{southern}} African subtropical thicket have been misunderstood and neglected. This formation was only recognised as a biome distinct from savanna and karoo {{in the mid}} 1990 s. One hypothesis states {{that it is a}} young vegetation type, assembled from forest, savanna and karoo elements after Holocene climatic amelioration. Others have suggested an ancient history for thicket. Here we review fossil and phylogenetic data in order to provide a better assessment of the origins <b>of</b> <b>thicket.</b> Albeit patchy, the fossil data are suggestive of a Palaeogene origin for this formation. A review of molecular phylogenetic data <b>of</b> extant <b>thicket</b> lineages indicated three major patterns: (i) ancient Cretaceous elements, including Encephalartos and the Strelitziaceae, (ii) basally branching lineages — many of which dominate contemporary thicket — that evolved in the Eocene (e. g. in the Celastraceae, Sapindaceae, Didiereaceae, Crassulaceae: Cotyledonoideae), and (iii) lineages derived from adjacent biomes that diversified in thicket in association with Neogene climatic deterioration (e. g. Aizoaceae, Asteraceae). We provide a narrative account of the evolution <b>of</b> <b>thicket,</b> which concludes that it is an ancient formation, extending back at least to the Eocene and derived initially from elements in the forest formations that prevailed in Upper Cretaceous and early Palaeogene times. As a biome, thicket is not uniquely southern African, being part of a formation that was globally widespread in the Eocene and which is extant {{in many parts of the}} world. Future research on the origins <b>of</b> <b>thicket</b> should focus on providing dates for major dichotomies as a complement to the rapid emergence of molecular phylogenies, as well as data on the genetic variation in populations of taxa categorised as ancient or young, and widespread or range-restricted...|$|R
