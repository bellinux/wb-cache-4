At least 149deaths were attributed to this storm, while it also caused $10million (1903USD) in damage in Jamaica alone. The third cyclone made landfall in Florida twice in mid-August, leaving 14fatalities and about $500,000 in damage. Only a few days later, the fourth cyclone struck New Jersey. The storm impacted many areas in <b>the</b> <b>Mid-Atlantic</b> region of the United States and caused 57deaths and about $8million in damage.

5|$|Some cotton {{crops in}} the Southeast United States {{received}} needed rainfall from Danny, {{while others were}} harmed, as 100,000 acres of cotton fields in Alabama were too heavily damaged for their crop to be salvaged.

A severe drought had been in place in <b>the</b> <b>Mid-Atlantic</b> region during the month of July. The high amount of rainfall caused by Danny helped to ease dry conditions in portions of <b>the</b> <b>Mid-Atlantic,</b> but not sufficiently to stop the drought from developing further in most areas from northern Virginia to southern New England.|$|E
