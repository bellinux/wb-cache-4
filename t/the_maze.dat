5|$|In Sabre Wulf, {{the player}} guides the pith-helmeted adventurer Sabreman through a {{two-dimensional}} maze. The player must reconstruct an amulet from its four pieces scattered throughout <b>the</b> <b>maze</b> {{to bypass the}} guardian at its exit, a cave {{that leads to the}} game's sequel, Underwurlde. <b>The</b> <b>maze</b> is presented in flip-screens such that the player views one static tile of the maze's grid at a time. For example, when Sabreman reaches the left edge of one screen, he continues <b>the</b> <b>maze</b> at the right edge of the next screen.|$|E
5|$|Reviewers {{complained of}} the game's high price, which was {{nearly double the}} average. Crash {{wondered}} if the cost might lead to more piracy. Critics also noted a bug in two-player mode, repeat screens from elsewhere in <b>the</b> <b>maze,</b> and the frustratingly narrow window in which sabre swings register as enemy hits. CVG recommended drawing a map of <b>the</b> <b>maze,</b> without which {{it was easy to}} get lost. While Sabre Wulf had some flicker issues, said Sinclair User, the game altogether met Ultimate's high quality benchmarks.|$|E
5|$|Whedon {{stated that}} <b>the</b> <b>maze</b> of red {{curtains}} {{on the stage}} in Willow's dream are not a direct homage to Twin Peaks, as some have posited, but rather represent the safety and comfort of being with her girlfriend Tara, and are a sexual metaphor as well.|$|E
50|$|It is {{necessary}} to navigate and shoot through several mazes in a first-person view {{in order to proceed}} through <b>the</b> game. <b>The</b> <b>mazes</b> account for a large amount of the frustration players encounter with this game. The instruction manual contains maps for <b>the</b> <b>mazes.</b>|$|R
50|$|Once {{the runner}} had passed <b>the</b> Mirror <b>Maze,</b> <b>the</b> runner {{had to find}} two of several Power Sticks that were hidden in the {{mountains}} between <b>the</b> Mirror <b>Maze</b> and <b>the</b> Honeycomb <b>Maze.</b> (Occasionally there was a Power Stick hidden in <b>the</b> Mirror <b>Maze</b> itself.) Once <b>the</b> runner found two, they entered <b>the</b> Honeycomb <b>Maze.</b> In this section, the runner had to lower their visor and rely on the partner to guide them through the network of doors and walls.|$|R

5|$|A third person, former UDR soldier John James Somerville (aged 37, a lorry-helper and {{the brother}} of Wesley), was arrested {{following}} an RUC raid in Dungannon on 26 September 1980. He was charged with the Miami Showband murders, the attempted murder of Stephen Travers, and the murder of Patrick Falls in 1974. He was given {{a total of four}} life sentences (three for the murders of the Miami Showband members and one for the Falls murder) on 9 November 1981; he had pleaded not guilty. The three convicted UVF men, although admitting to having been at the scene, denied having shot anyone. None of the men ever named their accomplices, and the other UVF gunmen were never caught. The three men were sent to serve their sentence in <b>the</b> <b>Maze</b> Prison, on the outskirts of Lisburn. Fortnight Magazine reported that on 1 June 1982, John James Somerville began a hunger strike at <b>the</b> <b>Maze</b> to obtain special category status. Crozier, McDowell, and Somerville were released after 1998 {{under the terms of the}} Belfast Agreement.|$|E
5|$|All puzzles {{are based}} on a {{mechanic}} of tracing a path through a maze-like route from a starting point, represented as a circle, to a goal point, represented as a line segment with a rounded end, without crossing one's path. The goal of these puzzles is not always to simply complete <b>the</b> <b>maze</b> but to find the right path that completes the puzzle correctly. Mazes may have several starting points and goals; the player may have to find the right starting point that can complete <b>the</b> <b>maze,</b> or they may {{have to figure out how}} to reach a specific end point to trigger an event in the surrounding environment such as moving a platform. The puzzles include a symbolic language that denotes the mechanics for that maze. For example, puzzles that present mazes with black and white squares in the spaces between traceable paths require the player to find a path through <b>the</b> <b>maze</b> that separates these squares by color. Other puzzles require the player to use the environment to determine how to solve the puzzle, such as studying a nearby tree with branches that mimic the puzzle, or by observing symbols on nearby floors and walls that align with the puzzle's configuration. The puzzles within each island section {{are based on}} common mechanic, often with a sequence of puzzles appearing early in each section that are designed to help the player identify and understand the mechanic and meaning of the symbols. Later puzzles combine two or more different mechanics into the same puzzle using the consistent symbolic language.|$|E
5|$|An {{example of}} this type of {{decomposition}} into interdigitating trees can be seen in some simple types of mazes, with a single entrance and no disconnected components of its walls. In this case both <b>the</b> <b>maze</b> walls and the space between the walls {{take the form of a}} mathematical tree. If the free space of <b>the</b> <b>maze</b> is partitioned into simple cells (such as the squares of a grid) then this system of cells can be viewed as an embedding of a planar graph, in which the tree structure of the walls forms a spanning tree of the graph and the tree structure of the free space forms a spanning tree of the dual graph. Similar pairs of interdigitating trees can also be seen in the tree-shaped pattern of streams and rivers within a drainage basin and the dual tree-shaped pattern of ridgelines separating the streams.|$|E

5|$|Frequently pictured posing by {{the famous}} Number 10 front door, Humphrey's primary duties {{involved}} catching {{mice and rats}} in <b>the</b> <b>maze</b> of Downing Street buildings.

5|$|Suddenly, {{an image}} of Discord on the stained-glass windows comes to life, teasing the ponies and Celestia. Discord claims to have taken the Elements and alludes to {{where they can be}} located. Twilight {{believes}} Discord is referring to the hedge maze near the castle and the six race there. Discord appears in his true form and challenges the ponies to a game, telling them that the only rules are they are not allowed to fly or use magic (enforcing this rule by making the unicorns' horns and Pegasi's wings vanish), and that if any of them leave the game, he automatically wins. Despite their handicap, the ponies enter <b>the</b> <b>maze,</b> but they are soon separated by Discord's magic. He is able to individually test Applejack, Pinkie Pie, Rarity, and Fluttershy against their respected Elements, making them be momentarily hypnotized, lose some of their color, and become a polar opposite of their Element. Twilight encounters each of them after this point, aware of their personality shift, but oblivious to their encounter with Discord. Soon, they find Rainbow Dash, having regained her wings, flying away from <b>the</b> <b>maze</b> and betraying not only her Element of Loyalty, but also forfeiting the game by leaving; <b>the</b> <b>maze</b> falls around them and Discord boasts his victory, warning of an incoming storm of chaos.|$|E
5|$|After Ashtar escapes into <b>the</b> <b>Maze</b> of Darkness, Robert tells Ryu about Ashtar's plot to {{take over}} the world by using the full power of his sword, the Dark Sword of Chaos. Robert implores Ryu to stop Ashtar before his Dark Sword reaches full power. After battling through <b>the</b> <b>Maze</b> of Darkness and into the World of Chaos, Ryu hears echoes of Ashtar's plan in the distance. Ryu then catches up with Ashtar. He {{releases}} Irene, but immediately after releasing her he stabs her with the Dark Sword. Robert then shows up, only to find out that Irene has been mortally wounded; Ashtar then blasts Robert with energy from his Dark Sword and then challenges Ryu to battle. Ryu defeats Ashtar, and before he dies, he says that the forces of Darkness will soon awaken and implores the forces of Chaos to engulf the world into darkness. While he is saying this, the Dark Sword of Chaos vanishes into thin air. After Ashtar's death, Irene tells Ryu that an evil altar that Ashtar prepared to open the Gate of Darkness must be destroyed. Ryu then leaves Irene behind and tells Robert to take her and leave the World of Chaos.|$|E

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>mazes</b> {{started out}} as {{extremely}} simple, but continually grew in complexity until most could not be solved by trial and error. The walls in <b>the</b> <b>mazes</b> were all at 90 degrees, and involved simple commands {{in any of the}} four directions to progress, with the player always facing {{in the direction of the}} last place he moved. One of <b>the</b> later <b>mazes</b> also featured invisible walls so that the player had to identify whether he was making progress or not by text in the game.|$|R

5|$|An {{announcement}} was made that Brosnan and director Martin Campbell will team up once again for a film adaptation of an Ernest Hemingway novel, Across the River and into the Trees, in which Brosnan will {{play the role of}} the protagonist, Colonel Cantwell. However, according to Campbell, the film's production and development fell apart due to financial issues hence its delay, but as of October 2017, it is back in the pipeline for which he's hopeful to begin working on, soon. Brosnan later joined Jamie Dornan and Cillian Murphy in a film based on the events of <b>The</b> <b>Maze</b> Prison Escape, titled H-Block which is to be directed by Jim Sheridan.|$|E
5|$|On Innistrad, a plane {{inspired}} heavily by gothic horror, its {{guardian angel}} has gone missing. Darkness {{has started to}} consume the plane, and the players must discover that the Helvault, a magical prison, has been holding the archangel Avacyn as well as demons. Thalia, a cathar of the Church of Avacyn, broke open the Helvault and released Avacyn {{as well as all}} of the demons. In the Return to Ravnica block, players were encouraged to affiliate themselves with a guild and take control of the city of Ravnica by completing <b>the</b> <b>maze</b> discovered by Niv - Mizzet.|$|E
5|$|The Doctor—a time {{travelling}} alien {{played by}} Matt Smith—and his companion Amy Pond (Karen Gillan) are summoned by River Song, a mysterious {{woman from the}} Doctor's future. She takes them to the planet Alfava Metraxis, where the spaceship Byzantium has crashed. Hidden inside is a Weeping Angel, a creature that can only move when unobserved by others. With the help of Father Octavian (Iain Glen) and his militarised clerics, the Doctor, Amy and River Song travel through a stone labyrinth to reach the ship. On the way, they discover that all the statues in <b>the</b> <b>maze</b> are Angels, which are slowly restoring and planning to trap them in the labyrinth.|$|E

5000|$|Pac-Man World (1999): The {{flagship}} again {{appears in}} a Pac-Man game, {{and it must be}} collected in order to access <b>the</b> <b>mazes.</b>|$|R
5|$|The player uses a {{joystick}} to control Pac-Man, navigating {{him through a}} maze of consumable dashes called Video Wafers,  opposed by a quartet of multi-colored ghosts. The goal of the game is to consume all the wafers in each level in order to proceed to the next one in search of the highest possible score. The four ghosts roam <b>the</b> <b>maze,</b> trying to kill Pac-Man. If any of the ghosts touches Pac-Man, he loses a life; when all lives have been lost, the game ends. Each game starts with four lives, and the player is awarded a bonus life upon successful completion of each level, up to a maximum of nine lives in reserve at any given time.|$|E
5|$|As the company's only engineer, Bristow rapidly {{developed}} a prototype himself before turning the game over to new hire Lyle Rains {{to develop into}} a finished product, codenamed K2 Tank. Rains added <b>the</b> <b>maze</b> and central minefield to the game design and developed the final hardware, including the simple control scheme. Peter Takaichi designed a large custom cabinet to house it. Tank {{was one of the}} first games to use integrated circuit-based memory—specifically, mask ROM (read-only memory)—to store graphical data, rather than the diode arrays that previous arcade games used; it is sometimes claimed in sources to be the very first, but was preceded at minimum by Atari's Gran Trak 10 (1974). Integrated circuit-based memory thereafter became the standard for arcade and console video games. Before the game could be completed, in September 1974 Atari announced plans to merge itself and Kee Games back together; Tank was released that November just prior to the merger in December 1974.|$|E
5|$|Eugenides {{and several}} critics {{compared}} Cal's condition to mythical creatures {{described by the}} ancient Greeks. The author alluded his protagonist's nature and heritage to the Minotaur, the half-man and half-bull creature. Cal's father is conceived after his grandparents' attendance of a theatric play entitled The Minotaur. The puzzle of Cal's genetic identity is akin to the creature's labyrinth, and the thread that leads out of <b>the</b> <b>maze</b> is held here by his paternal grandmother, a former silk farmer. Frances Bartkowski, a scholar of English, named Callie in her puberty as a chimera. The mythical monster is an analogy for a complex personality, a mixture of body parts from various animals that each represents a human aspect or characteristic. Similarly, adolescent Callie is an amalgamation of her genes, neither male nor female, neither adult nor child, and yet all {{of them at the}} same time.|$|E

5|$|Mr. Krabs tells SpongeBob and Squidward {{that it is}} {{a perfect}} {{opportunity}} for his business rival, Plankton to steal the Krabby Patty formula. Mr. Krabs has hired Patrick as a security guard so he does not have to pay for a real one, and SpongeBob spectacularly decorates the Krusty Krab. Patrick, Squidward, and Mr. Krabs follow SpongeBob into the freezer where he shows them a giant Krabby Patty ice sculpture that he made himself. However, in attempt to take the ice sculpture outside, they accidentally knock SpongeBob out the open freezer door; he then rebounds off the kitchen door and back into the freezer. The impact shuts the door and it locks, trapping all four friends inside. Mr. Krabs remembers that {{there is a way to}} escape without using the door, which is through the ventilation system. While finding their way through <b>the</b> <b>maze</b> of air vents, they look back at some memorable moments in their lives.|$|E
5|$|Near {{the corners}} of <b>the</b> <b>maze</b> are four larger, {{flashing}} consumables known as Power Pills that provide Pac-Man with the temporary ability to eat the ghosts and earn bonus points. When a Power Pill is in effect the enemies turn blue and try to evade Pac-Man. When a ghost is eaten its disembodied eyes return to the nest (center box) to respawn. The blue ghosts turn reddish during the last moments of a Power Pill’s effect, signaling that {{they are about to}} become dangerous again, and the length of time for which the enemies remain vulnerable varies from one level to the next, becoming shorter as the game progresses. The final consumable items are the Vitamins, which appear periodically directly below the nest.|$|E
5|$|On 17 February 1979, China retaliated against Vietnam's {{invasion}} of Kampuchea by attacking along the Sino-Vietnam border, and within ten days {{had reached the}} provincial capitals. Fighting bogged down due to <b>the</b> <b>maze</b> of tunnels the Chinese encountered; nevertheless, the Chinese army captured Cao Bằng on 2 March and Lạng Sơn on 4 March, reportedly advancing towards Hanoi at a high speed, though not on good terms with its supply lines. However, the following day, China {{announced that it would}} not move deeper into Vietnam, apparently after meeting fierce and unexpectedly harsh resistance by well trained and equipped Vietnamese forces, supplied with American technology left behind from the Vietnam War. Confident that the threat of invasion had been a success, the Chinese subsequently withdrew their forces. Although China failed to decisively win the 27-day conflict, the diversion of troops from Kampuchea facilitated a strong resurgence in Khmer Rouge insurgent operations, making it unavoidable for the young PRK regime in Kampuchea to implement conscription, and requiring Vietnam to station a large portion of its army along the Sino-Vietnamese border.|$|E
