5|$|Saudi Arabia {{uses the}} bench trial system. Its courts observe few formalities. The country's first {{criminal}} procedure code {{was introduced in}} 2001 and contains provisions borrowed from Egyptian and French law. Human Rights Watch, in a 2008 report, noted <b>that</b> <b>judges</b> were either ignorant of the criminal procedure code or were aware of it but routinely ignored the code.|$|E
5|$|Cameroon's {{legal system}} is {{largely based on}} French civil law with common law influences. Although {{nominally}} independent, the judiciary falls {{under the authority of}} the executive's Ministry of Justice. The president appoints judges at all levels. The judiciary is officially divided into tribunals, the court of appeal, and the supreme court. The National Assembly elects the members of a nine-member High Court of Justice <b>that</b> <b>judges</b> high-ranking members of government in the event they are charged with high treason or harming national security.|$|E

5|$|Patton did {{not stop}} with the {{juvenile}} justice system, however. He encouraged passage of a bill that required that violent offenders serve at least 85percent of their sentences (up from the 50percent previously mandated), while requiring <b>that</b> <b>judges</b> consider home incarceration for first-time, non-violent offenders. The bill also allowed judges to sentence criminals to life without parole; previously, life without parole for 25years had been the harshest non-capital sentence. The bill passed the legislature in 1999.|$|E
5|$|The {{view has}} been taken <b>that</b> <b>judges</b> may assign meaning to vague {{constitutional}} provisions or statutes {{on the basis of}} their own ideological preferences, hence disregarding Parliament's intention. This criticism arguably does not suggest the need to abandon interpretation by reference to the legislature's intention, but serves to highlight the importance of the need to use the power of interpretation in an appropriate manner.|$|E
5|$|The Selle Français stud {{book has}} long allowed {{crossbreeding}} {{with four other}} breeds: the Thoroughbred, Arabian, Anglo-Arabian and French Trotter. Today, restrictions exist to harmonize the stud book with directives for other European warmblood breeds. For a Selle Français to be registered, it must be from two registered Selle Français parents or from {{a cross between a}} Selle Français and a facteur de selle français (non-Selle Français horse that has passed stud book selection procedures). Stallions must pass through a selection process before their progeny is allowed to be registered as Selle Français. The process involves an approval committee <b>that</b> <b>judges</b> stallions on criteria based on the age, breed and nationality of the horses. The qualification criteria involve the conformation, gaits, performance and are scored against national indices.|$|E

50|$|The initial {{criticism}} of Judge X made by Peruzzi, that he adopted unjust decisions, was not deemed excessive. However the second criticism stating <b>that</b> <b>Judge</b> X had willfully committed errors with malicious intent or even negligence implied <b>that</b> <b>Judge</b> X abandoned his ethical responsibilities as a judge, and was deemed excessive as the defendant provided no useful evidence demonstrating Judge X’s malice.|$|R

5|$|The {{capabilities}} and reactionary {{nature of the}} judges have been criticized. The main complaint reportedly made by Saudis privately is <b>that</b> <b>judges,</b> who have wide discretion in interpreting the Sharia, have no knowledge, and are often contemptuous, of the modern world. Reported examples of judges' attitudes include rulings banning {{such things as the}} children’s game Pokémon, telephones that play recorded music, and sending flowers to hospital patients. Saudi judges come from a narrow recruitment pool. By one estimate, 80% of the 600+ Saudi judges and almost all senior judges come from Qasim, a province {{in the center of the}} country with less than 5% of Saudi's population, but known as the strict religious Wahhabi heartland of Saudi Arabia. Senior judges will only allow like-minded graduates of select religious institutes to join the judiciary and will remove judges that stray away from rigidly conservative judgments.|$|E
5|$|The {{government}} {{tried to}} enforce a controversial media law that would see Clarín lose licenses and be forced to sell most of its assets. The law was initially sanctioned as a competition law for the media, but critics pointed {{out that it is}} only being used to further the campaign against Clarín. The government had little interest in enforcing measures of the law that were not related to Clarín. Clarín launched a constitutional challenge against some articles of the law with the judiciary. The government released an anti-Clarín advertisement claiming it refused to obey the law and may be subverting democracy. The conflict led to disputes with the judiciary. Minister Julio Alak said that extending an injunction that allowed Clarín to keep its assets during the trial would be an insurrection, and it was rumored <b>that</b> <b>judges</b> who did not rule as the government wished might face impeachment. The court extended the inunction.|$|E

No judge shall {{be removed from office}} unless he has been guilty of a criminal offense or subjected to disciplinary measure, or declared to be under interdiction. No judge shall, except in accordance with law, be suspended or transferred or have his salary reduced. Judges shall be appointed from those persons who have passed the Examination of Judicial Officials, completed the Training Course for Judicial Officials and possessed distinguished records after a term of practice.|$|E

Dennis Lynch, a lawyer, {{wrote an article}} about <b>Judge</b> <b>that</b> appeared on the website catholic.org. Lynch claimed <b>that</b> <b>Judge</b> was not gay and that any attempt to define him as gay was due to [...] "homosexual activists" [...] who wanted to [...] "attack the Catholic Church" [...] and turn the priest into a [...] "homosexual icon". Others refuted Lynch’s claims with evidence <b>that</b> <b>Judge</b> did in fact identify himself as gay, both to others and in his personal journals.|$|R

25|$|Leo and Chen {{also suggest}} that the two tests are similar in most respects, with only a narrow gap between them, and would produce the same result in most cases. They caution <b>that</b> <b>judges,</b> rather than {{concerning}} themselves with the labels given to the tests for bias, should be wary of taking extraneous matters into consideration, no matter which test is applied. The case of Locabail (UK) Ltd. v. Bayfield Properties Ltd. (1999) identified two particular issues for judges to be mindful of– special knowledge and legal sophistication. The authors concluded their analysis by suggesting that the true importance of the matter lies not in which test is used, but in ensuring <b>that</b> <b>judges</b> have taken into account all relevant circumstances and excluded extraneous considerations which {{would not have been}} applicable to the general public.|$|E
25|$|In an {{interview}} broadcast on Iraqi television on 6 September 2005, Iraqi president Jalal Talabani said <b>that</b> <b>judges</b> had directly extracted confessions from Saddam Hussein {{that he had}} ordered mass killings and other crimes during his regime and that he deserves to die.

50|$|Cooper family {{tradition}} has it <b>that</b> <b>Judge</b> Cooper {{was killed by}} a blow to the head sustained during an argument with a political opponent after a public meeting in Albany, New York on December 22, 1809.

25|$|Reliance on old maxims is now deprecated.

25|$|In a 2005 {{speech at}} Case Western Reserve University, Gorsuch said <b>that</b> <b>judges</b> {{should strive to}} apply the law as it is, {{focusing}} backward, not forward, and looking to text, structure, and history to decide what a reasonable reader {{at the time of}} the events in question would have understood the law to be—not to decide cases based on their own moral convictions or the policy consequences they believe might serve society best.|$|E

40|$|Can’t one truly <b>judge</b> <b>that</b> one is <b>judging?</b> Matthew Soteriou {{provides}} {{an analysis of}} authoritatively knowing one’s own mental acts which depends on a surprising assumption: One cannot truly <b>judge</b> <b>that</b> one is <b>judging.</b> After briefly criticizing his account of one’s awareness <b>that</b> one is <b>judging,</b> I critically scrutinize two of his arguments against the possibility of truly <b>judging</b> <b>that</b> one is <b>judging.</b> Firstly, assuming such a possibility leads to a regress. Secondly, the second-order judgement inevitably replaces the first-order judgement such as to make the former wrong. Matthew Soteriou (2005) has provided a thorough analysis of our intuitive claims to be directly and authoritatively aware of our own mental activity. Soteriou opposes non-occurrent belief and conscious judgement. The latter is a mental act, the former is not. Conscious judgement is identified with occurrent belief (Soteriou 2005, 96). While one can have a non-occurrent belief that one is believing that p despite not believing that p, one’s non-occurrent belief that one is now <b>judging</b> <b>that</b> p cannot be subject to such a mistake. Whenever one is <b>judging</b> <b>that</b> p, one has a non-occurrent belief <b>that</b> one is <b>judging</b> <b>that</b> p (Soteriou 2005, 95). Whenever one has a non-occurrent belief <b>that</b> one is <b>judging</b> <b>that</b> p, this belief cannot be false...|$|R
