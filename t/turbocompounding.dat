The model of a 6 -cylinder turbocharged engine (Holset HDX 55 V) was calibrated using an experimental BSFC map to predict engine exhaust thermodynamic conditions such as exhaust mass flow rate and exhaust temperature under various operating conditions. These engine exhaust conditions were then utilized to feed the inlet conditions for both the ORC and <b>turbocompounding</b> models, evaluating the available exhaust energy to be recovered by each technology. Firstly the ORC system model was simulated to obtain the power that can be generated from the system. Having this additional power converted to useful work, the BSFC was observed to reduce around 2 – 5 % depending upon engine’s speed and BMEP. The initial model of the engine was then modified by considering a second turbine representing <b>turbocompounding</b> heat recovery system. The BSFC was increased due to the back-pressure from the second turbine, but the energy generated from the turbine was sufficient to reduce the BSFC further. However, by application of <b>turbocompounding</b> no improvement in BSFC was achieved at low engine’s speeds.

A common method of recovering this energy is turbocharging.

40|$|For an {{internal}} combustion engine, a large quantity of fuel energy (accounting for approximately 30 % {{of the total}} combustion energy) is expelled through the exhaust without being converted into useful work. Various technologies including <b>turbocompounding</b> and the pressurized Brayton bottoming cycle {{have been developed to}} recover the exhaust heat and thus reduce the fuel consumption and CO 2 emission. However, the application of these approaches in small automotive power plants has been relatively less explored because of the inherent difficulties, such as the detrimental backpressure and higher complexity imposed by the additional devices. Therefore, research has been conducted, in which modifications were made to the traditional arrangement aiming to minimize the weaknesses. The turbocharger of the baseline series <b>turbocompounding</b> was eliminated from the system so that the power turbine became the only heat recovery device on the exhaust side of the engine, and operated at a higher expansion ratio. The compressor was separated from the turbine shaft and mechanically connected to the engine via continuous variable transmission (CVT). According to the results, the backpressure of the novel system is significantly reduced comparing with the series <b>turbocompounding</b> model. The power output at lower engine speed was also promoted. For the pressurized Brayton bottoming cycle, rather than transferring the thermal energy from the exhaust to the working fluid, the exhaust gas was directly utilized as the working medium and was simply cooled by ambient coolant before the compressor. This arrangement, which is known as the inverted Brayton cycle (IBC) was simpler to implement. Besides, it allowed the exhaust gasses to be expanded below the ambient pressure. Thereby, the primary cycle was less compromised by the bottoming cycle. The potential of recovering energy from the exhaust was increased as well. This paper analyzed and optimized the parameters (including CVT ratio, turbine and compressor speed and the inlet pressure to the bottoming cycle) that are sensitive to the performance of the small vehicle engine equipped with inverted Brayton cycle and novel <b>turbocompounding</b> system, respectively. The performance evaluation was given in terms of brake power output and specific fuel consumption.

(c) Thermoelectric generator for the direct conversion of the extracted exhaust gas heat to electrical energy. (d) Rankine cycle system operating with H 2 O or R 245 ca as working medium. A heat recuperator is installed to improve the thermodynamic efficiency of the organic Rankine cycle. The potential use of EGR and charge air cooler as major components of Rankine cycle system is also examined. A <b>turbocompounding</b> simulation model has been developed by including operating charts for turbocharger and power turbine. Thus, an estimation of the power turbine operation on turbocharger and engine performance. A separate finite element model has been also conducted to evaluate the performance of a thermoelectric generator installed in a diesel engine. A thermodynamic simulation model for Rankine cycle has been developed including a sub-model for the description of heat transfer between the hot fluid and the working medium. The developed simulation tool provides the optimum Rankine cycle operating points at each engine load. Thus, the model estimates the dimensions of the system heat exchangers. The theoretical analysis provided the following results: # The electrical turbocompound improves the overall bsfc when the turbocharger efficiency increases. # The installation of a power turbine downstream of the turbocharger turbine reduces further the overall bsfc compared to the previous technique at all engine loads. # The improvement of specific fuel consumption is negligible when using thermoelectric generators for exhaust gas heat recovery. # The maximum reduction in the overall bsfc is achieved with the installation of the organic Rankine cycle system for heat exploitation from exhaust gas, EGR and charge air cooler. # The significant increase of the total rejected heat from Rankine cycle and diesel engine to the ambience is the major disadvantage of the system. The size reduction of the required cooling system is feasible with the modification of Rankine cycle operation at full engine load. # The use of Rankine cycle system for exhaust gas temperature management proved to be beneficial for the improvement of SCR catalyst efficiency and its protection during active filter regeneration. # The size estimation of the Rankine cycle components proved that the installation of the system on a heavy duty truck is feasible. ...|$|E

40|$|Engine {{boosting}} via turbocharging is {{a method}} to increase the engine power output with minimal or no increase in engine parasitic, frictional and pumping losses. Turbocharging in conjunction with engine down-sizing and down-speeding allows a reduction of engine fuel consumption, while maintaining a high engine power output. However, turbocharging introduces a lag in engine transient response, caused by the finite amount of time required by the turbocharger to accelerate, which has to be minimized. Electric turbocharger assistance consists of coupling an electric motor/generator to a standard turbocharger. The scope of the motor/generator {{is to increase the}} power available to accelerate the rotor assembly, so that the time to boost is reduced. The motor/generator could also be utilized to brake the turbocharger to control boost and avoid over-speeds, thus replacing the conventional waste-gate. Furthermore, electric assistance allows <b>turbocompounding</b> to be implemented. <b>Turbocompounding</b> improves the engine efficiency by utilizing the turbine and motor/generator to recuperate additional exhaust flow energy. In this thesis, the electric turbocharger assistance impact on the turbocharger and engine performance is studied. An electrically assisted turbocharger prototype has been developed by industrial partners and it has been tested by the author of this thesis. The performance of the turbocharger turbine and motor/generator has been characterized over the full speed range and the impact of the electric assistance on the turbine flow has been investigated experimentally.

A two-stage turbocharger air system with intercooling and aftercooling was selected to meet engine boost and BMEP requirements. A <b>turbocompound</b> turbine stage is incorporated for exhaust energy recovery. The concept engine cost was estimated to be 43 percent higher compared to a Caterpillar 3176 engine. The higher initial engine cost is predicted to be offset by reduced operating costs due the lower fuel consumption...|$|R
