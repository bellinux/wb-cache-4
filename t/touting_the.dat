5|$|By late 2004, Brokaw {{had retired}} from his {{anchoring}} duties at NBC, ceding the reins to Brian Williams; Rather planned {{to step down}} in March 2005. Jennings and ABC saw an opportunity to gain viewers, and initiated a publicity blitz <b>touting</b> <b>the</b> anchor's foreign reporting experience. However, despite having almost always reported {{from the scene of}} any major news story, Jennings was sidelined by an upper respiratory infection in late December 2004; he was forced to anchor from New York during the aftermath of the Asian tsunami, while his competitors traveled to the region. For Jennings, the situation was agonizing.|$|E
5|$|Upon {{the signing}} of the treaty, Tyler {{complied}} with the Texans' demand for military and naval protection, deploying troops to Fort Jesup in Louisiana and a fleet of warships to the Gulf of Mexico. In the event that the Senate failed to pass the treaty, Tyler promised the Texas diplomats that he would officially exhort both houses of Congress to establish Texas as a state of the Union upon provisions authorized in the Constitution. Tyler's cabinet was split on the administration's handling of the Texas agreement. Secretary of War William Wilkins praised the terms of annexation publicly, <b>touting</b> <b>the</b> economic and geostrategic benefits with relation to Great Britain. Secretary of the Treasury John C. Spencer was alarmed at the constitutional implications of Tyler's application of military force without congressional approval, a violation of the separation of powers. Refusing to transfer contingency funds for the naval mobilization, he resigned.|$|E
5|$|Croc's {{maneuvering}} {{abilities are}} somewhat {{comparable to that}} of Mario's in Super Mario 64, with his primary methods of movement consisting of the abilities to run, jump, climb, and swim using either the analog stick or the D-pad, as well as <b>touting</b> <b>the</b> abilities to perform a sidestep and a 180-degree quick turn as other methods of maneuver. Croc's main method of attack consists of a full-circle tail swipe that is used to defeat enemies and bosses, as well as a hit drop move {{that can be used to}} break open crates containing collectibles. Croc's in-game health is represented by the crystals that the player collects throughout the game; when Croc is hurt by an enemy, all of his crystals are lost and scattered around him in several directions (similar to a mechanic commonly used in Sonic the Hedgehog). If Croc is hurt while he has no crystals, the player loses a life and is sent back to the beginning of the segment of the level they are currently in.|$|E

25|$|Anglers {{of the era}} who {{ventured into}} the Esopus valley were usually advised by guidebooks and {{magazine}} articles <b>touting</b> <b>the</b> Catskills' trout populations to bypass the main stream {{in favor of the}} tributaries, since the Esopus itself was generally too warm for brook trout, the favored species at that time, and still too polluted by runoff from the tanneries. In the 1880s pioneering fish farmer Seth Green advocated the stocking of rainbow trout in streams where the brook trout population was beginning to thin {{as a result of the}} fishing pressure, as they could handle warmer water better. Other anglers feared that, if introduced, the more aggressive rainbows would displace the native brooks.|$|E
25|$|With the 1940s and {{the coming}} of World War II, Hayden's focus shifted from public works to war-time needs. He lobbied a variety of Arizona groups to make land {{available}} and <b>touting</b> <b>the</b> favorable year-round flying weather, he assisted {{with the creation of}} a number of military bases throughout his home state, including the Luke and Williams training bases. An Army Desert Training Center built in southwestern Arizona and southeastern California was also used by American troops preparing for the North African campaign. As the United States prepared for possible war, Hayden in August 1940 advocated the use of volunteers instead of conscription to obtain needed manpower. He also introduced amendments prohibiting payment of money to avoid military service, draftees procuring substitutes, and securing of enlistments by the paying of bounties.|$|E

[...] <b>Touting</b> <b>the</b> benefits of the CD's comparatively vast storage space, Sega and its third-party developers produced a number of games for the add-on that include digital video in their gameplay or as bonus content, as well as re-releasing several cartridge-based games with high-fidelity audio tracks. [...] In 1993, Sega released the Sega CD 2, a smaller and lighter version of the add-on designed for the Genesis II, at a reduced price compared to the original. [...] A limited number of games were later developed that use both the Sega CD and the Sega 32X add-ons.|$|E
500|$|The Double Supreme was {{promoted}} {{in a series}} of advertisements created by the New York firm of Ammirati Puris Lintas (APL).

[...] A second advertisement featured actors playing McDonald's employees going to Burger King to get the new sandwich because they had realized that they preferred the Burger King product over the sandwich they normally sold. The attack ads were the result of the comparatively strong sales year for Burger King in 1996 coupled with domestic sales problems for McDonald's, leaving BK acting in a [...] "cocky" [...] manner towards its main rival.|$|E

500|$|This {{development}} had {{a ripple}} effect throughout both regions and in the Paris markets. Both Champagne and Burgundy were deeply concerned with the [...] "healthiness" [...] reputation of their wines, even {{to the extent of}} paying medical students to write theses <b>touting</b> <b>the</b> health benefit of their wines. These theses were then used as advertising pamphlets that were sent to merchants and customers. The Faculty of Medicine in Reims published several papers to refute Fagon's claim that Burgundy wine was healthier than Champagne. In response, Burgundian winemakers hired physician Jean-Baptiste de Salins, dean of the medical school in Beaune, to speak to a packed auditorium at the Paris Faculty of Medicine. Salins spoke favorably of Burgundy wine's deep color and robust nature and compared it to the pale red color of Champagne and the [...] "instability" [...] of the wine to travel long distances and the flaws of the bubbles from when secondary fermentation would take place. The text of his speech was published in newspapers and pamphlets throughout France and had a damaging effect on Champagne sales.|$|E
500|$|Skelton {{also added}} a routine {{he had been}} {{performing}} since 1928. Originally called [...] "Mellow Cigars", the skit entailed an announcer who became ill as he smoked his sponsor's product. Brown and Williamson, the makers of cigarettes, asked Skelton to change {{some aspects of the}} skit; he renamed the routine [...] "Guzzler's Gin", where the announcer became inebriated while sampling and <b>touting</b> <b>the</b> imaginary sponsor's wares. While the traditional radio program called for its cast to do an audience warm-up in preparation for the broadcast, Skelton did just the opposite. [...] After the regular radio program had ended, the show's guests were treated to a post-program performance. [...] He would then perform his [...] "Guzzler's Gin" [...] or any of more than 350 routines for those who had come to the radio show. [...] He updated and revised his post-show routines as diligently as those for his radio program. [...] As a result, studio audience tickets for Skelton's radio show were in high demand; there were times where up to 300 people needed to be turned away for lack of seats.|$|E
500|$|Golan shelved the low-budget rewrites and {{attempted}} to finance an independent production from the original big-budget script, already budgeted, storyboarded and laid out. At Cannes in May 1989, 21st Century announced a September start date, with ads <b>touting</b> <b>the</b> script by [...] "Barney Cohen, Ted Newsom & John Brancato and Joseph Goldman." [...] As standard practice, Golan pre-sold the unmade film to raise production funds, with television rights bought by Viacom and home video rights by Columbia Pictures, which wanted to establish a studio franchise. Stephen Herek was attached as director at this point. Golan submitted this [...] "new" [...] screenplay to Columbia in late 1989 (actually the 1985 script with an adjusted [...] "1989" [...] date) and the studio requested yet another rewrite. Golan hired Frank LaLoggia, who turned in his draft but grew disenchanted with 21st Century. Neil Ruttenberg was hired for one more draft, which was also [...] "covered" [...] by script readers at Columbia. Columbia’s script analysts considered all three submissions [...] "essentially the same story." [...] A tentative production deal was set. Said Stan Lee in 1990, [...] "21st Century [...] supposed to do Spider-Man and now they're talking to Columbia {{and the way it}} looks now, Columbia may end up buying Spider-Man from 21st Century." ...|$|E
