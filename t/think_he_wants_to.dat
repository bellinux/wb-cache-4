500|$|Azaria played Gargamel in the computer-animated/live-action {{adaptation}} of The Smurfs (2011). Azaria wore a prosthetic nose, ears, buck teeth, eyebrows and a wig, {{as well as}} shaving his head. He spent approximately 130 hours in the make-up chair {{over the course of}} the production. Azaria considered Gargamel's voice to be the most important part of his performance. The producers wanted an [...] "old, failed, Shakespearean actor" [...] voice, but Azaria felt this would lack energy and wanted something more Eastern European. He eventually selected a voice similar to that of Paul Winchell's from the cartoon. Azaria disliked the cartoon when it first aired, and considered Gargamel too one-dimensional a character and [...] "just this straight villain"; he opted to make Gargamel [...] "more sarcastic" [...] than in the cartoon, but [...] "discovered that there's no way to play Gargamel without screaming your head off at certain points – ramping him up and getting him very upset over Smurfs". He interpreted him as [...] "very lonely", adding that [...] "he hates the Smurfs because they're such a happy family. He wants in really badly. I <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> be embraced as a Smurf". Azaria worked with the writers to [...] "infuse" [...] the script with some of his ideas about the character, [...] "particularly with the 'married' relationship between Gargamel and [...] Azreal [...] " [...] which Azaria conceived.|$|E
500|$|The episode {{introduced}} Criss as Blaine, a gay {{member of}} a rival glee club, the Dalton Academy Warblers. In September 2010, a casting call was released for an actor to portray a [...] "cute, charismatic, gay high school junior" [...] who would lead a competing glee club. Criss had auditioned for Glee several times before, once {{for the role of}} Finn Hudson. The character breakdown for Blaine was the first he believed he had a chance of securing, and indeed his audition was successful. Blaine was introduced primarily as a mentor to Kurt. Criss explained, [...] "At this point, Kurt's [...] has been such a sense of discord in his life. Blaine finds [...] empowering. He embraces who he is, and sees Kurt [...] the same things that he had to deal with, and I <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> impart that knowledge." [...] Murphy described Blaine as a character with [...] "great self-loathing" [...] and regret for having run away from his own tormentors; he intended this to form part of his story arc for the season, as Blaine tries to set right some past mistakes. Neither he nor Criss knew whether Blaine would eventually become Kurt's boyfriend—a role originally intended for new club member Sam Evans (Chord Overstreet) until the producers decided to change Sam to heterosexual and paired him with Quinn—but based on the characters' chemistry and the [...] "immediate outcry" [...] from fans who wanted to see them as a couple, Murphy later decided to pair them romantically.|$|E

You <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> be one of these things?" [...] The line [...] "Sit down or so help me god I'll have you shot" [...] appears once {{near the end of}} the song.|$|E

2500|$|Some {{controversy}} concerning biblical {{accuracy and}} {{content in the}} writing of the script arose over statements from Ridley Scott that he would be looking to natural causes for the miracles, including drainage from a tsunami for the parting of the Red Sea. [...] According to Scott, the parting of the Red Sea was inspired by a tsunami believed to have been triggered by an underwater earthquake off the Italian coast around 3000 BC. This, combined with statements from Christian Bale about Moses, whom he portrayed ("I think the man was likely schizophrenic {{and was one of the}} most barbaric individuals that I ever read about in my life"), raised criticism. Those who voiced their concern included author Brian Godawa saying, [...] "It's accurate to portray Moses as an imperfect hero, so Christians won't take issue with that, but to be so extreme as to call him one of the most barbaric people in history, that sounds like he's going out of his way to distance himself from the very people you’d <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> appeal to." [...] Another was the CEO of Faith-Driven Consumer, Chris Stone, saying about Bale's comments [...] "There's nothing in the biblical history that supports that. It's an indication that there will be a tremendous disconnect between Bale’s interpretation and the expectations of the market" [...] and suggesting that Christians will not go to cinemas to see the film.|$|E

6000|$|... "What do I make of it? Can't you see, Sam? Tom {{was trying}} <b>to</b> <b>think.</b> <b>He</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> get {{something}} that was hidden away in his memory--his own name, and mine and yours, and Nellie's, {{and the name of}} Brill.

6000|$|... "I don't {{mean about}} his letting me think he didn't ca'e for me, so long. But don't you <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> {{do what is}} right! Mr. Gregory, I mean." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Leslie {{passed her}} up the gangway," [...] said another man, adding, with a suggestive laugh as he {{answered}} another question: [...] "Why did he do it?

500|$|In {{the spring}} of 449 BC, Pericles {{proposed}} the Congress Decree, {{which led to a}} meeting ("Congress") of all Greek states in order to consider the question of rebuilding the temples destroyed by the Persians. The Congress failed because of Sparta's stance, but Pericles' intentions remain unclear. Some historians <b>think</b> that <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> prompt a confederation with the participation of all the Greek cities; others <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> assert Athenian pre-eminence. According to the historian Terry Buckley the objective of the Congress Decree was a new mandate for the Delian League and for the collection of [...] "phoros" [...] (taxes).|$|R

5000|$|I thought <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> me <b>to</b> audition, and so I {{was just}} very relaxed and casual about the news. I didn't <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> hire me, I knew that's not how things worked. The next day, they told me, you know that offer you didn't sound too excited about? It's an offer, not an audition. I flipped out. I didn't know how he was doing this! The next week I was in New Orleans.|$|R
5000|$|In 2013 Varney {{generated}} controversy for his {{commentary on}} Pope Francis, who had criticized the wealth gap and denounced unfettered capitalism {{as a system}} which [...] "rules rather than serves." [...] Varney stated, [...] "I go to church to save my soul. It’s {{got nothing to do}} with my vote. Pope Francis has linked the two. He has offered direct criticism of a specific political system.

5000|$|The two {{scholars}} {{also discussed}} Parsons' debate with Schütz and especially why Parsons had ended his encounter with Schutz. Parsons found that Schutz, rather than attempting to build social science theory, tended to get consumed in philosophical detours. Parsons wrote to Voegelin: [...] "Possibly {{one of my}} troubles in my discussion with Schuetz {{lies in the fact}} that by cultural heritage I am a Calvinist. I do not want to be a philosopher - I shy away from the philosophical problems underlying my scientific work. By the same token I don't <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> be a scientist as I understand the term until he has settled all the underlying philosophical difficulties. If the physicists of the 17th century had been Schuetzes there might well have been no Newtonian system." ...|$|E
5000|$|There {{was also}} {{speculation}} {{that he would}} return in Queens of the Stone Age during their summer tour due to Josh Homme's dedication of [...] "New Fang" [...] to Nick for [...] "new beginnings". However, this proved to be false. In March 2011, Oliveri stated: [...] "The last time I saw them play was a benefit for Brian O'Connor in L.A., from the Eagles of Death Metal. I was down there and I mentioned to them, [...] "Why don't I come up and do [...] "Millionaire" [...] or something, and sing it and not play bass?" [...] Josh was like, [...] "Nah, I don't think that's a good idea yet." [...] It's kind of in his court for stuff like that. I don't <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>wants</b> <b>to</b> give anybody the wrong idea. I don't necessarily know if that would happen. And he's got a good band—he's taking the band in the direction he wants it to go." ...|$|E

5000|$|In September 2012, Dylan {{commented on}} I'm Not There in an {{interview}} published in Rolling Stone. When journalist Mikal Gilmore asked Dylan whether he liked the film, he responded: [...] "Yeah, I {{thought it was all}} right. Do you think that the director was worried that people would understand it or not? I don't <b>think</b> <b>he</b> cared one bit. I just <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> make a good movie. I thought it looked good, and those actors were incredible." ...|$|R
