25|$|The Viet Cong Russian {{roulette}} {{scenes were}} shot in real circumstances, with real rats and mosquitoes, {{as the three}} principals (De Niro, Walken, and Savage) were tied up in bamboo cages erected along the River Kwai. <b>The</b> <b>woman</b> <b>who</b> <b>was</b> given the task of casting the extras in Thailand had much difficulty finding a local to play the vicious-looking individual who runs the game.

De Niro suggested that Walken be slapped for real by one of the guards without any warning. The reaction on Walken's face was genuine. Producer Deeley has said that Cimino shot the brutal Vietcong Russian roulette scenes brilliantly and more efficiently than any other part of the film.|$|E
25|$|The first legal {{initiative}} to outlaw the devadasi system {{dates back to}} the 1934 Bombay Devadasi Protection Act. This act pertained to the Bombay province as it existed in the British Raj. The Bombay Devadasi Protection Act made dedication of women illegal, whether consensual or not. According to this act, marriage by a devadasi was to be considered lawful and valid, and the children from such wedlock were to be treated as legitimate. The Act also laid down grounds for punitive action that could be taken against any person or persons found to be involved in dedications, except <b>the</b> <b>woman</b> <b>who</b> <b>was</b> being dedicated. Those found guilty of such acts could face a year’s imprisonment, a fine, or both. The 1934 Act also provided rules, which were aimed at protecting the interests of the devadasis. Whenever there was a dispute over ownership of land involving a devadasi, the local Collector was expected to intervene.|$|E

He made a proper lifesaving approach and towed the unconscious woman to shore. Commander Robert E. Hunt, NOAA Corps, and Lieutenant Paul E. Pegnato, NOAA Corps, both also of Ferrel, came to Langankes medical assistance, with Hunt using cardiopulmonary resuscitation to revive her and Pegnato administering oxygen and first aid to stabilize her condition.

For saving and assisting Langanke, the three men received the Department of Commerce Gold Medal in 1987.|$|E
