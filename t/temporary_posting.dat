500|$|Evans was {{promoted}} to group captain in January 1969 and appointed Director of Air Force Plans. In this position he proposed and organised the gift of 23 of the RAAF's old CAC Sabres to the Indonesian Air Force, following an earlier presentation of 10Sabres to the Royal Malaysian Air Force. He completed studies at the Royal College of Defence Studies, London, in 1972. [...] Returning to Australia, he {{was promoted}} to air commodore and appointed Director-General Plans and Policy, Air Force, in January 1973. He served as Officer Commanding RAAF Base Amberley from February 1975 until April 1977. In this role he qualified as a pilot on the recently delivered F-111C swing-wing bomber, as well as the UH-1 Iroquois helicopter. Following his tour as Amberley base commander, Evans {{was promoted to}} air vice marshal and became Chief of Air Force Operations (CAFOPS). He held this newly created position for the next two years, broken by a <b>temporary</b> <b>posting</b> as Deputy Chief of the Air Staff between January and August 1978. As CAFOPS, Evans played a major part in developing the RAAF's plans for the defence of Australia. Following America's announcement in the 1969 Guam Doctrine that its allies would have to assume greater self-reliance in their military affairs, Australia's strategic thought underwent a change from its earlier policy of [...] "forward defence" [...] to a more localised defensive posture. While the consensus among RAAF planning staff was to adopt a [...] "repulsion" [...] concept of attacking an enemy force along the air and sea approaches to northern Australia, Evans considered that this did not go far enough in exploiting the long-range offensive capabilities of such aircraft as the F-111. Convinced that Australia's numerically small forces would be hard-pressed to dislodge an invader that had gained a foothold on the continent, he refined the [...] "repulsion" [...] stance into what he termed an [...] "anti-lodgement" [...] strategy, focussing on defeating the enemy at its potential staging bases north of Australia and then, as a last resort, on the approaches closer to home. The Air Force's role in shaping an overall strategy that took advantage of the [...] "air-sea gap" [...] was later acknowledged in the Federal government paper The Defence of Australia 1987. Evans was appointed an Officer of the Order of Australia on 26January 1981 for his achievements as CAFOPS.|$|E

40|$|Initially {{this study}} {{started with the}} main {{objective}} of examining the English language environment available to the learners in a remote locality. However, when it was {{realized that there was}} no English language environment outside the English language classroom, the issue was approached {{from the perspective of the}} instructors and their instructions as they were the main source of English language exposure which the learners received. The main subjects of this study were a group of 25 pupils and three English language teachers in School A. Qualitative approach was used to gather data through observation, interviews and documents. Field and formal analysis were carried out using interpretative and descriptive statistics. In order to validate the findings, cross checking and triangulation were carried out. The study revealed that subjects received very minimal English language exposure. Whatever little exposure they received in class were of poor quality. The teacher was the only source of exposure through their English language class. As such, the English language teachers had a vital role to play. However, the "qualified" teachers were not motivated to teach. They treated School A as a <b>temporary</b> <b>posting</b> while awaiting a more permanent posting to a school or district of their choice. While they "buy" their time teaching was not very close to their heart. Thus, could these teachers motivate their students to learn? When they did teach they were hardly ever prepared and made numerous errors in English. Whatever little homework given was seldom returned by the students and if completed and handed in, the work was hardly looked at. In short the findings suggest that the reluctance of the English language teachers in the milieu of the rustic learners has resulted in the remoteness of English language in School A...|$|E
