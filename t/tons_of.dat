5|$|Bivalves {{have been}} an {{important}} source of food for humans at least since Roman times and empty shells found in middens at archaeological sites are evidence of earlier consumption. Oysters, scallops, clams, ark clams, mussels and cockles are the most commonly consumed kinds of bivalve, and are eaten cooked or raw. In 1950, the year in which the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) started making such information available, world trade in bivalve molluscs was 1,007,419 tons. By 2010, world trade in bivalves had risen to 14,616,172 tons, up from 10,293,607 tons a decade earlier.

50|$|In 1999-2000, {{the mill}} had 1,939 looms for hessian, 1,103 for sacking and 234 for carpet backing cloth (CBC).

The Adamjee Jute Mill has more manpower than it actually requires for production of hessian, sacking and CBC. Also, the man-days required to produce these items have also increased {{in the last five}} years. The mill has, however, achieved some improvements in terms of use of raw materials. In 1995-1996, the raw jute required to produce a <b>ton</b> <b>of</b> hessian per <b>ton</b> was 1,672 kg, a <b>ton</b> <b>of</b> sacking 1,494 kg and a <b>ton</b> <b>of</b> CBC 1,813 kg.
