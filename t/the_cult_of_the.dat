5|$|Hence, the Pyramid Texts of {{the pyramid}} of Unas {{incorporate}} instructions for ritual actions and words to be spoken, suggesting that they were precisely those performed and recited during <b>the</b> <b>cult</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> king in his mortuary temple.|$|E
5|$|The first {{hypothesis}} {{is that this is}} due to a change of ideology. The advent of the 5th dynasty marks the growing importance of <b>the</b> <b>cult</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sun as hinted by the Westcar Papyrus. This is also directly evidenced by the large sun temples built at Abusir throughout the dynasty, a tradition initiated by Userkaf. Finally, the Abusir Papyri demonstrate the strong connection between <b>the</b> <b>cult</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sun and the mortuary cult of the pharaohs of this dynasty: offerings for a deceased ruler were first consecrated in a sun temple before being dispatched to his mortuary temple. Thus, Userkaf located his mortuary temple to the south of the main pyramid so that the sun would shine directly into it all year round.|$|E

5|$|The {{culture and}} monuments of ancient Egypt {{have left a}} lasting legacy on the world. <b>The</b> <b>cult</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> goddess Isis, for example, became popular in the Roman Empire, as obelisks and other relics were transported back to Rome. The Romans also {{imported}} building materials from Egypt to erect Egyptian-style structures. Early historians such as Herodotus, Strabo, and Diodorus Siculus studied and wrote about the land, which Romans came to view {{as a place of}} mystery.|$|E
5|$|In the Early Dynastic Period (c. 3100–2686BC), {{the first}} pharaohs built funerary {{complexes}} {{in the religious}} center of Abydos following a single general pattern, with a rectangular mudbrick enclosure. In the Old Kingdom (c. 2686–2181BC) that followed the Early Dynastic Period, royal funerary monuments greatly expanded, while most divine temples remained comparatively small, suggesting that official religion in this period emphasized <b>the</b> <b>cult</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> divine king more than the direct worship of deities. Deities closely connected with the king, such as the sun god Ra, received more royal contributions than other deities. Ra's temple at Heliopolis {{was one of the}} great religious centers of the age, and several Old Kingdom pharaohs built large sun temples in his honor near their pyramids. Meanwhile, the small provincial temples retained a variety of local styles from Predynastic times, unaffected by the royal cult sites.|$|E

5|$|Jocelin (or Jocelyn) (died 1199) was a twelfth-century Cistercian monk and cleric {{who became}} the fourth Abbot of Melrose before {{becoming}} Bishop of Glasgow, Scotland. He was probably born in the 1130s, and in his teenage years became a monk of Melrose Abbey. He rose {{in the service of}} Abbot Waltheof, and {{by the time of the}} short abbacy of Waltheof's successor Abbot William, Jocelin had become prior. Then in 1170 Jocelin himself became abbot, a position he held for four years. Jocelin was responsible for promoting <b>the</b> <b>cult</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> emerging Saint Waltheof, and in this had the support of Enguerrand, Bishop of Glasgow.|$|E
5|$|Other {{offering}} rituals {{took place}} at noon and at sunset, though the sanctuary was not reopened. Some ceremonies other than offerings also took place daily, including rituals specific to a particular god. In <b>the</b> <b>cult</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sun god Ra, for instance, hymns were sung {{day and night for}} every hour of the god's journey across the sky. Many of the ceremonies acted out in ritual the battle against of the forces of chaos. They might, for instance, involve the destruction of models of inimical gods like Apep or Set, acts that were believed to have a real effect through the principle of heka.|$|E
5|$|Sometime {{after the}} {{translation}} of the relics of Oswald of Northumbria to Bardney Abbey by Osthryth between 675 and 679, Wilfrid, along with Hexham Abbey, began to encourage and promote <b>the</b> <b>cult</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> dead king. Barbara Yorke sees this advocacy as {{a major factor in}} the prominence given to Oswald in Bede's Historia ecclesiastica gentis Anglorum. Historian D. P. Kirby regards Wilfrid's championing of Oswald as being a contributing factor in Wilfrid's expulsion from York in 678. Kirby believes that Ecgfrith felt Wilfrid was promoting Oswald's branch of the Northumbrian royal family over his own. One of Wilfrid's protégés, Willibrord, became a missionary to the Frisians in 695, perhaps inspired by Wilfrid's example. Willibrord may have felt it expedient to leave Northumbria, where he was known as one of Wilfrid's followers.|$|E

5|$|The {{mysteries of}} Isis were {{religious}} initiation rites performed in <b>the</b> <b>cult</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> goddess Isis in the Greco-Roman world. They were modeled on other mystery rites, particularly the Eleusinian Mysteries {{in honor of}} the Greek goddess Demeter, and originated sometime between the third century BCE and the second century CE. Despite their mainly Hellenistic origins, the mysteries did allude to beliefs from ancient Egyptian religion, in which the worship of Isis arose. By undergoing the mystery rites, initiates signaled their dedication to Isis, although they were not required to worship her exclusively. The rites were seen as a symbolic death and rebirth, and they may have been thought to guarantee that the initiate's soul, with the goddess's help, would continue after death in a blissful afterlife.|$|E
5|$|The reigns of Djedkare Isesi and of Unas were a time {{of changes}} in Ancient Egyptian {{religion}} and in the ideology of kingship, changes that are first demonstrable under Unas. A statistical analysis of clay seal fragments bearing Horus names of pharaohs of the Fifth Dynasty points to a marked decline of <b>the</b> <b>cult</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> king during Unas' time on the throne. This continued under Unas' successor Teti, for whom we know only two seals bearing his Horus name. This trend reflects the lessening of the king's power {{in conjunction with the}} growth of the administration and priesthood.|$|E
5|$|Around 1350BC, the {{stability}} of the New Kingdom seemed threatened further when Amenhotep IV ascended the throne and instituted a series of radical and chaotic reforms. Changing his name to Akhenaten, he touted the previously obscure sun deity Aten as the supreme deity, suppressed the worship of most other deities, and attacked the power of the temple that had become dominated by the priests of Amun in Thebes, whom he saw as corrupt. Moving the capital to the new city of Akhetaten (modern-day Amarna), Akhenaten turned a deaf ear to events in the Near East (where the Hittites, Mitanni, and Assyrians were vying for control). He was devoted to his new religion and artistic style. After his death, <b>the</b> <b>cult</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Aten was quickly abandoned, the priests of Amun soon regained power and returned the capital to Thebes. Under their influence the subsequent pharaohs Tutankhamun, Ay, Horemheb, and possibly even Neferneferuaten/Nefertiti herself worked to erase all mention of Akhenaten's heresy, now known as the Amarna Period.|$|E

5|$|<b>The</b> Eye <b>of</b> Ra was {{involved}} {{in many areas of}} ancient Egyptian religion, including in <b>the</b> <b>cults</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> many goddesses who are equated with it.

2500|$|The Eleusinian Mysteries, (Greek: [...] ) were annual {{initiation}} ceremonies in <b>the</b> <b>cults</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> goddesses Demeter and Persephone, held {{in secret}} at Eleusis (near Athens) in ancient Greece. The mysteries began in about 1600 B.C. in the Mycenean period and continued for two thousand years, becoming a major festival during the Hellenic era, and later spreading to Rome.|$|R
5|$|Isis {{was one of}} many non-Greek deities whose cults {{became part}} of Greek and Roman {{religion}} during the Hellenistic period (323–30 BCE), when Greek people and culture spread to lands across the Mediterranean and most of those same lands were conquered by the Roman Republic. Under the influence of Greco-Roman tradition, some of these cults, including that of Isis, developed their own mystery rites. The mysteries of Isis could have emerged {{as far back as the}} early third century BCE, after the Greek Ptolemaic dynasty had taken control of Egypt. The Ptolemies promoted <b>the</b> <b>cult</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> god Serapis, who incorporated traits of Osiris and of Greek deities like Dionysus and the underworld god Pluto. Isis's cult was conjoined with that of Serapis. She too was reinterpreted to resemble Greek goddesses, particularly Demeter, while retaining many of her Egyptian characteristics. The mysteries of Isis, modeled on those in Demeter's honor at Eleusis, could have been developed at the same time, as part of this mingling of Greek and Egyptian religion.|$|E
5|$|The cult of Thor {{was linked}} up with men's {{habitation}} and possessions, and with {{well-being of the}} family and community. This included the fruitfulness of the fields, and Thor, although pictured primarily as a storm god in the myths, was also concerned with the fertility and preservation of the seasonal round. In our own times, little stone axes from the distant past have been used as fertility symbols and placed by the farmer in the holes made by the drill to receive the first seed of spring. Thor's marriage with Sif of the golden hair, about which we hear little in the myths, seems to be a memory of the ancient symbol of divine marriage between sky god and earth goddess, when he comes to earth in the thunderstorm and the storm brings the rain which makes the fields fertile. In this way Thor, as well as Odin, may be seen to continue <b>the</b> <b>cult</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sky god which was known in the Bronze Age.|$|E
5|$|The name of Djedkare Isesi's {{principal}} wife is not known. An important queen consort {{whose name}} is lost was very likely {{the owner of a}} large pyramid complex located to the northeast of Djedkare's pyramid in Saqqara. This could indicate that she was the mother of Djedkare's successor, Unas, or that Djedkare owed the throne to her. The very high status of this queen is suggested by some features of her funerary complex that are otherwise reserved to kings: her pyramid has its own satellite pyramid, has a causeway leading from a valley temple up to a mortuary temple devoted to <b>the</b> <b>cult</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> queen and had an entrance hall pr-wrw, an open courtyard and a square antechamber. Furthermore, some reliefs showing the queen had been reworked with royal insignia and vultures added above her head. Since the construction of the queen's pyramid was apparently undertaken after the planning of Djedkare's pyramid and her relief had been reworked, the Egyptologist Klaus Baer suggests that this queen may have ruled after the death of Djedkare, playing an important role in his succession. This is rejected by other Egyptologists, such as Michel Baud, owing to the lack of evidence for a regency or interregnum between Djedkare and Unas.|$|E
