25|$|Passion {{begins with}} a long {{introductory}} foray into the Western philosophical tradition of human nature before moving onto a four-part meditation of human experience and expression. In part one, he sets out to define passion as the noninstrumental dealings that we have with others; they organize and are organized around the need and danger that is at <b>the</b> <b>heart</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> relations with others. This definition is developed out of {{the argument that the}} individual is in constant conflict in the world: at once attempting to assert the self as individual and establish difference, but at same time to gain acceptance by others. We are thus defined by the mutual need and reliance upon each other, and the mutual fear of each other in acceptance or rejection. Passion {{is at the heart of}} this reciprocal and infinite terror and longing for each other.|$|E
25|$|Robert Bork's America {{is a land}} {{in which}} women would be forced into back-alley abortions, blacks would sit at {{segregated}} lunch counters, rogue police could break down citizens' doors in midnight raids, schoolchildren could not be taught about evolution, writers and artists could be censored at the whim of the Government, and {{the doors of the}} Federal courts would be shut on the fingers of millions of citizens for whom the judiciary is—and is often the only—protector of the individual rights that are <b>the</b> <b>heart</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> democracy... President Reagan is still our president. But he should not be able to reach out from the muck of Irangate, reach into the muck of Watergate and impose his reactionary vision of the Constitution on the Supreme Court and the next generation of Americans. No justice would be better than this injustice.|$|E
500|$|The Millennium Ecosystem Assessment (MEA) report 2005 defines {{ecosystem}} services as benefits people obtain from ecosystems, and distinguishes four categories, namely provisioning, regulating, supporting, and cultural. A fundamental tenet {{is that a}} few species of arthropod are well understood for their influence on humans (such as honeybees, ants, mosquitoes, and spiders). [...] However, insects offer ecological goods and services. The Xerces Society calculates {{the economic impact of}} four ecological services rendered by insects: pollination, recreation (i.e. [...] "the importance of bugs to hunting, fishing, and wildlife observation, including bird-watching"), dung burial, and pest control. The value has been estimated at $153 billion worldwide. As the ant expert E. O. Wilson observed: [...] "If all mankind were to disappear, the world would regenerate back to the rich state of equilibrium that existed ten thousand years ago. If insects were to vanish, the environment would collapse into chaos." [...] A Nova (TV Series) segment on the American Public Broadcasting Service framed the relationship with insects in an urban context: [...] "We humans like to think that we run the world. But even in <b>the</b> <b>heart</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> great cities, a rival superpower thrives... These tiny creatures live all around us in vast numbers, though we hardly even notice them. But in many ways, it is they who really run the show. The Washington Post stated: [...] "We are flying blind in many aspects of preserving the environment, and that's why we are so surprised when a species like the honeybee starts to crash, or an insect we don't want, the Asian tiger mosquito or the fire ant, appears in our midst. In other words: Start thinking about the bugs." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{doctrine}} {{was stated}} again by Clinton in the culminating chapter of Hard Choices, her 2014 memoir {{of her time}} as secretary:... It was {{no coincidence that the}} places where women's lives were most undervalued largely lined up with the parts of the world most plagued by instability, conflict, extremism, and poverty. This was a point lost on many of the men working across Washington's foreign policy establishment, but over the years I came to view it {{as one of the most}} compelling arguments for why standing up for women and girls was not just the right thing to do but also smart and strategic ... the correlation was undeniable, and a growing body of research showed that improving conditions for women helped resolve conflicts and stabilize societies. [...] "Women's issues" [...] had long been relegated to the margins of U.S. foreign policy and international diplomacy, considered at best a nice thing to work on but hardly a necessity.

2500|$|The year 1940 saw the {{collapse}} of Carol II's regime. The unexpected cession of Bessarabia to the Soviets shocked Romanian society and greatly angered Iorga. At the two sessions of the Crown Council held on June 27, {{he was one of}} six (out of 21) members to reject the Soviet ultimatum demanding Bessarabia's handover, instead calling vehemently for armed resistance. Later, the Nazi-mediated Second Vienna Award made Northern Transylvania a part of Hungary. This loss sparked a political and moral crisis, eventually leading to the establishment of a National Legionary State with Ion Antonescu as Conducător and the Iron Guard as a governing political force. In the wake of this reshuffling, Iorga decided to close down his Neamul Românesc, explaining: [...] "When a defeat is registered, the flag is not surrendered, but its fabric is wrapped around the heart. <b>The</b> <b>heart</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> struggle was the national cultural idea." [...] Perceived as Codreanu's murderer, he received renewed threats from the Iron Guard, including hate mail, attacks in the movement's press (Buna Vestire and Porunca Vremii) and tirades from the Guardist section in Vălenii. He further antagonized the new government by stating his attachment to the abdicated royal.|$|E
2500|$|Rolf echoed similar sentiments in a 2013 {{article for}} Democracy, writing: [...] "If we invest time, energy, and capital into {{rigorous}} research, development, testing, and scaling up of new strategies and organizations that put workers' interests at <b>the</b> <b>heart</b> <b>of</b> <b>our</b> democracy, we can rebuild the American Dream. Now {{is a time}} for creativity and courage, risk and experimentation." [...] In 2013, The Seattle Times wrote that Rolf's mission is to persuade the more traditional leaders within the movement [...] "to accept that innovation is your new religion". He advocates for the use of social networking services by unions in order to engage young people, and believes that, like corporations, unions must invest in development, entrepreneurship and research in order to be successful in their efforts. Rolf believes [...] "a completely new and disruptive force" [...] is necessary to help the middle class, which will require [...] "bold moral and economic choices". He criticizes corporations that outsource or subcontract workers on a low-wage, part-time or temporary basis in order to avoid paying for the benefits required for full-time employees. Rolf has expressed concern about increased student loan debt, cost of housing increases that are greater than family income increases, and payroll tax increases during a time of simultaneous corporate tax decreases, and he is critical of trickle-down economics. He advocates for a $15-per-hour minimum wage to help address these issues. Rolf believes that minimum wage increases help local and small businesses.|$|E
