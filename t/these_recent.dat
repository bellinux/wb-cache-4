5|$|Prior to NYC Ferry, {{there had}} been many ferries that traversed the East River and Hudson River, {{although}} by the 1960s, almost all ferry services citywide had been discontinued due to the popularity of road and rail transit across the rivers. Ferries in New York City saw a revival in the 1980s and 1990s. As a result of two studies in 2011 and 2013 that showed the impacts of <b>these</b> <b>recent</b> ferries, the city officially proposed its own ferry service in 2013, separate from existing New York City ferry systems such as NY Waterway, New York Water Taxi, and the Staten Island Ferry.|$|E
5|$|That night Quatermass {{travels with}} {{journalist}} Hugh Conrad to the prefab town where they meet with construction workers {{who say that}} work has been suspended for all except the 'zombies' ('marked' people). They claim that the meteorites are only over-shots from the plant after one of them lands in a pub. <b>These</b> <b>recent</b> meteorites are falling in hundreds and being collected by special guard teams {{then returned to the}} plant. Quatermass steals a guard's uniform from a lorry to gain entry to the plant. As he does this Conrad returns to the pub to telephone his newspaper and reveal everything about the secret alien invasion, but he becomes 'marked' before he can finish. The construction workers, however, hear what he says and decide to take action. Meanwhile, Quatermass is inside a pressure dome, where he sees guards putting meteorites into the tanks of poisonous slime that killed Ward, where together, in the recreated atmosphere of a moon of Saturn, they combine and grow into the first of the enormous ammonid alien creatures.|$|E

For 3 weeks in that month, the United States military carried out at least a dozen operations, including commando raids and airstrikes, many of these raids and strikes taking place in the Tora Bora region of Nangarhar Province. American commanders in Afghanistan said they believed that between 90 and 100 Islamic State militants had been killed in <b>these</b> <b>recent</b> operations.|$|E
25|$|Mexican law {{enforcement}} agencies have not consistently undertaken serious efforts to locate parentally abducted children. Location of the child remains undetermined for eight of the cases included in the September 2000 Compliance Report and in all six of the cases added to this report. In June 2000, Mexico passed a law making familial child abduction a federal crime and forming a federal police unit charged with investigating crimes against children, including the location of missing children. <b>These</b> <b>recent</b> actions may result in improved efforts to locate children.|$|E
25|$|The {{industrial}} infrastructure of bridges and factories {{to the rear}} is a notable feature of the composition.

Their appearance is punctuated by sails of sailing-boats and the strikingly coloured head of the central figure. These factories and trains were noisy and smelly, but Seurat does not permit this to dominate the painting; for all that the chimneys belch, they seem powerless to disrupt the settled scene.|$|E
40|$|The paper surveys recent {{analyses}} of rising unemployment in Europe {{based on the}} concept of the natural rate. It argues that there is a continuity of analysis from the classics through Keynes to <b>these</b> more <b>recent</b> approaches. Theories of efficiency wages, hysteresis, and insiders/outsiders are related to a core theory in which the unemployment benefit is the basic source of rigidity. It is argued that <b>these</b> more <b>recent</b> approaches are either variations of or additions to this core theory, and that in its absence they would fail to explain unemployment.

5000|$|Prior to {{and since}} the United States Supreme Court rulings in District of Columbia v. Heller (2008) and McDonald v. Chicago (2010), Spitzer also argues that history and prior law {{do not support the}} individualist {{interpretation}} of the Second Amendment reflected in <b>these</b> two <b>recent</b> court rulings. Since the cases were handed down, he wrote: [...] "The Heller and McDonald rulings established, as a matter of law, an individual rights interpretation of the Second Amendment.

25|$|Emerging {{research}} suggests that gay men from religious backgrounds are likely to come out online via Facebook and Blogs as it offers a protective interpersonal distance. This largely contradicts the growing movement in social media research indicating that online use, particularly Facebook, can lead to negative mental health outcomes such as increased levels of anxiety. While {{further research is needed}} to assess whether these results generalize to a larger sample, <b>these</b> <b>recent</b> findings open the door to the possibility that gay men's online experiences may differ from heterosexuals' in that it may be more likely to provide mental health benefits than consequences.|$|E
25|$|After gaining independence, {{larger numbers}} of {{indigenous}} Sub-Saharan African peoples (Haalpulaar, Soninke, and Wolof) entered Mauritania, moving into the area north of the Senegal River. Educated in French language and customs, many of <b>these</b> <b>recent</b> arrivals became clerks, soldiers, and administrators in the new state. This occurred as the French militarily suppressed the most intransigent Hassane tribes in the north. This changed the former balance of power, and new conflicts arose between the southern populations and Moors. Between these groups stood the Haratin, a very large population of Arabized slaves of sub-Saharan African origins, who {{is part of the}} Arab society, integrated into a low-caste social position.|$|E
25|$|The bath complex was {{partially}} cleaned of accumulated silt {{in the beginning}} of the 20th century. Despite continuous flooding, the hot springs section was in use in the 1950s. In 1992, the Roman Bridge that was also still in use was reconstructed with some distortions, disregarding the interests of conservationists. Also, in 1992, some rather shabby reconstruction work had been done in Allianoi itself, as a modern building was constructed over the historical remains. The complex was put out of use after heavy flooding in February 1998. Some of the site has been used as farmland. <b>These</b> <b>recent</b> elements were removed in 2003 by the excavation team and the major parts of the Bath Complex beneath them started to come to light.|$|E

25|$|Since {{the early}} 1990s, most {{typically}} {{in the city}} of Bamenda, marches by groups of older women have been referred to as Takembeng. These protests involve groups of 30 to a couple hundred older women marching or protesting through the city, often taking part with other political protests affiliated with the main opposition party in Cameroon, the SDF. While the other protesters are quite loud and active at these protests, the Takembeng women remain largely silent while marching (which distinguishes the current manifestations from the earlier versions). Similarly, unlike the earlier practices, <b>these</b> <b>recent</b> movements include women from a variety of different ethnic groups. Although rural women provide a core part of the movement, it also includes urban women who live in Bamenda.|$|E
25|$|People with OI {{are born}} with {{defective}} connective tissue, or without {{the ability to make}} it, usually because of a deficiency of Type-I collagen. This deficiency arises from an amino acid substitution of glycine to bulkier amino acids in the collagen triple helix structure. The larger amino acid side-chains create steric hindrance that creates a bulge in the collagen complex, which in turn influences both the molecular nanomechanics and the interaction between molecules, which are both compromised. As a result, the body may respond by hydrolyzing the improper collagen structure. If the body does not destroy the improper collagen, the relationship between the collagen fibrils and hydroxyapatite crystals to form bone is altered, causing brittleness. Another suggested disease mechanism is that the stress state within collagen fibrils is altered at the locations of mutations, where locally larger shear forces lead to rapid failure of fibrils even at moderate loads as the homogeneous stress state found in healthy collagen fibrils is lost. <b>These</b> <b>recent</b> works suggest that OI must be understood as a multi-scale phenomenon, which involves mechanisms at the genetic, nano-, micro- and macro-level of tissues.|$|E
