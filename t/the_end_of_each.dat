5|$|Caterpillars mature {{through a}} series of {{developmental}} stages known as instars. Near <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>each</b> stage, the larva undergoes a process called apolysis, mediated by the release of a series of neurohormones. During this phase, the cuticle, a tough outer layer made of a mixture of chitin and specialized proteins, is released from the softer epidermis beneath, and the epidermis begins to form a new cuticle. At <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>each</b> instar, the larva moults, the old cuticle splits and the new cuticle expands, rapidly hardening and developing pigment. Development of butterfly wing patterns begins by the last larval instar.|$|E
