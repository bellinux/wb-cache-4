Later, after Franco's {{attack on the}} couple during their honeymoon, Jason held Sam as they gazed at the stars because <b>they</b> <b>made</b> <b>her</b> feel safe. Jason and Sam star-gazed several times throughout the year. Stars emerged again on February 8, 2012, after Sam and Jason learned {{that they were going}} to be parents. Jason took Sam back to the honeymoon cabin he had built for them and they stargazed. They also promised each other that they would teach their child all about the constellations.|$|E
25|$|Her fame {{spread in}} no time across Lebanon after the show and the reviews were so good <b>they</b> <b>made</b> <b>her</b> father change his mind and give her his blessings to pursue in singing {{as long as she}} {{continues}} her higher education. Later on, Majida graduated from the Lebanese University after receiving her BA in Arabic Literature. In 1975, Majida released her first single “Am Behlamak” (Im dreaming of you, Lebanon) with collaboration with Lebanese poet Said Akl and musician Elias Rahbani.

She also revealed that she ran in shoes {{that she had not}} broken in and <b>they</b> <b>made</b> <b>her</b> feet bleed. The actress added [...] "It was incredibly stressful but I guess it was stress in a good way. There were months of preparation involved so that it could run like clockwork. So I guess it was stressful in the sense the emotional stakes were heightened for a two-week period. It was exhausting and I think we can all say we were happy once it was over. But the final result was worth it." [...] McGregor filmed his final scene out of sequence at the Melbourne studios. He explained that they had already shot Mark's last scene on location, then went back inside to do the studio shots. He revealed [...] "The final thing I filmed was a conversation between Mark and Kyle, where they're saying goodbye. It was a bit sad, but it was basically just these two guys hugging each other – with the cast and crew watching!" ...|$|E
500|$|It is night time, and as Dot Branning (June Brown) makes {{herself a}} cup of cocoa at home, she records a message on a tape {{recorder}} for her husband Jim (John Bardon), who is in hospital recovering from a stroke. Dot tells Jim everyone is missing him, and {{that she has been}} dreading recording the message. She talks about her Christian faith and remembers her childhood, her first marriage to Charlie Cotton (Christopher Hancock) and her friendship with Ethel Skinner (Gretchen Franklin). She talks about when she was evacuated to Wales during the Second World War and how she did not cry when she left her mother. She says she was happy moving away to live with her guardians, a Welsh couple named Gwen and Will, as <b>they</b> <b>made</b> <b>her</b> feel special, and recalls the happiest day of her life. She remembers how Will would sing [...] "Pretty Baby" [...] to her at night, but says since then everyone she has cared about has died. She finishes by telling Jim that the hospital staff want to send him home, but she fears she {{will not be able to}} cope and concludes she is better on her own.|$|E
500|$|After {{roles in}} the comedy-drama Postcards from the Edge (1990) and the comedy-fantasy Defending Your Life (1991), Streep starred with Goldie Hawn in farcical black comedy, Death Becomes Her (1992), with Bruce Willis as their co-star. Streep persuaded writer David Koepp to rewrite several of the scenes, {{particularly}} {{the one in which}} her character has an affair with a younger man, which she believed was [...] "unrealistically male" [...] in its conception. The seven-month shoot was the longest of Streep's career, during which she got into character by [...] "thinking about being slightly pissed off all of the time". Due to Streep's allergies to numerous cosmetics, special prosthetics had to be designed to age her by ten years to look 54, although Streep believed that <b>they</b> <b>made</b> <b>her</b> look nearer 70. Longworth considers Death Becomes Her to have been [...] "the most physical performance Streep had yet committed to screen, all broad weeping, smirking, and eye-rolling". Although it was a commercial success, earning $15.1million in just five days, Streep's contribution to comedy was generally not taken well by critics. [...] Times Richard Corliss wrote approvingly of Streep's [...] "wicked-witch routine" [...] but dismissed the film as [...] "She-Devil with a make-over" [...] and one which [...] "hates women".|$|E

60|$|They {{were afraid}} to leave her behind, she said, lest she should have headed a party. No doubt M. le Prince dreaded her influence, {{and so did the}} Queen. <b>They</b> had <b>made</b> <b>her</b> father issue his {{commands}} without warning lest she should disobey.|$|R
2500|$|While {{creating}} the album, Lopez {{listened to a}} vast range of blues and soul music, which she listened to growing up. Artists such as Stevie Wonder, Luther Vandross and Michael Jackson among other had a profound influence on the album's sound. According to Lopez, she attempts to [...] "elicit a similar feeling" [...] in her own songwriting from these artists' songs on the album, because <b>they</b> <b>made</b> <b>her</b> [...] "heart sing". Vandross and Wonder's records [...] "just stay with you" [...] according to Lopez, who wanted to make something that was true to her upbringing {{as well as her}} current love life.|$|E
2500|$|In 1950, Rosebud Yellow Robe {{was hired}} by Twentieth-Century Fox to {{undertake}} a national publicity tour for the movie [...] "Broken Arrow". The movie, directed by Delmer Daves, starred James Stewart as Tom Jeffords, Jeff Chandler as Cochise and Jay Silverheels as Geronimo. The film is based on historical figures but fictionalizes their story in dramatized form. Broken Arrow was nominated for three Academy Awards, and won a Golden Globe award for Best Film Promoting International Understanding. [...] Film historians reported that the movie {{was one of the}} first major Westerns since the Second World War to portray the Indians sympathetically. Rosebud was interviewed by newspapers during the tour and explained that there were no such things as Indian princesses, and that the myth started when Pocahontas went to England and the English named her [...] "Lady Rebecca." [...] The Americans decided that she must be royalty, so <b>they</b> <b>made</b> <b>her</b> [...] "princess." [...] It's an old English rather an old Indian custom." [...] Rosebud voiced complaints about the portrayals of Indians on radio, screen and television to [...] "a new generation of children learning the old stereotypes about whooping, warring Indians, as if there weren't anything else interesting about us." ...|$|E

500|$|Maureen Ryan {{from the}} Chicago Tribune was {{critical}} about the character's initial development.

60|$|The {{second and}} third and fourth days {{endlessly}} wore away, and Helen believed <b>they</b> had <b>made</b> <b>her</b> old.

60|$|Yet {{there was}} still one other difficulty. If <b>they</b> <b>made</b> <b>her</b> seem to abjure, that would free her from the death-penalty. They could keep her in a prison of the Church, {{but they could not}} kill her.|$|E
60|$|She {{had lost}} the sympathy but not the respect of <b>her</b> hearers. <b>They</b> <b>made</b> way for <b>her</b> with sullen {{deference}} as she {{passed out on the}} platform. But her adversary, profiting by the last opportunity, burst into an ironical laugh.|$|R
60|$|They dashed on, finding {{people on}} the watch for tidings, and meeting bodies of the National Guard, and when at length they reached the Place Vendome, they found the whole {{establishment}} watching for them, and Virginia flew to meet them on the stairs, throwing her arms round her sister, while Lady Conway started forward with the agitated joy, and almost anger, of one who felt injured by the fright <b>they</b> had <b>made</b> <b>her</b> suffer.|$|R
50|$|Lana Turner's 1937 film <b>They</b> Won't Forget <b>made</b> <b>her</b> {{the first}} Sweater girl, an {{informal}} look {{for young women}} relying on large breasts pushed up and out by bras, which continued to be influential into the 1950s, and was arguably the first major style of youth fashion.|$|R

60|$|Yet it did {{not very}} much matter how she looked or what happened. Beyond all was the {{assurance}} of her dearness to him. Suddenly she darted away from him again.

Dorn caught up with her. His strong hands on her shoulders felt masterful, and the sweet terror <b>they</b> inspired <b>made</b> <b>her</b> struggle to get away.|$|R
50|$|Vandaryeva first {{coaches were}} World and European champions Andrei Kulebin and Andrei Kotsur. It was <b>they,</b> who have <b>made</b> <b>her</b> a champion.
