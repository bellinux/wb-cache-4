40|$|This paper {{presents}} a finite layer procedure for Biot's consolidation analysis of layered soils using a cross-anisotropic elastic constitutive model. The program is first verified using published results. Then, using this program, {{the influences of}} cross-anisotropy on <b>the</b> immediate <b>settlement,</b> <b>the</b> final <b>settlement,</b> and <b>the</b> consolidation behaviour are investigated by changing one model parameter at one time. The results obtained using the cross-anisotropic elastic model are compared with results using an isotropic elastic model. It is found that the cross-anisotropy has very large influences on <b>the</b> immediate <b>settlement,</b> <b>the</b> final <b>settlement,</b> and <b>the</b> consolidation behaviour. Curves or tables of <b>the</b> immediate <b>settlement</b> coefficients, <b>the</b> final <b>settlement</b> coefficients, and <b>the</b> average degree of consolidation are obtained and presented in the paper.
