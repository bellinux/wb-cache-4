40|$|Nucleation of {{promoter}} melting in bacteria is {{coupled with}} RNA polymerase (RNAP) binding to a conserved − 10 promoter element {{located at the}} upstream edge of the transcription bubble. The mechanism of downstream propagation of the transcription bubble to include the transcription start site is unclear. Here we introduce new model downstream <b>fork</b> <b>junction</b> promoter fragments that specifically bind RNAP and mimic the downstream segment of promoter complexes. We demonstrate that RNAP binding to downstream <b>fork</b> <b>junctions</b> is coupled with DNA melting around the transcription start point. Consequently, certain downstream <b>fork</b> <b>junction</b> probes can serve as transcription templates. Using a protein beacon fluorescent method, we identify structural determinants of affinity and transcription activity of RNAP-downstream <b>fork</b> <b>junction</b> complexes. Measurements of RNAP interaction with double-stranded promoter fragments reveal that the strength of RNAP interactions with downstream DNA plays {{a critical role in}} promoter opening and that the length of the downstream duplex must exceed a critical length for efficient formation of transcription competent open promoter complex...|$|R
50|$|On 7 September 1964 the Silloth branch closed completely. In 1968 the southward spur from <b>Forks</b> <b>Junction</b> to Bog Junction was closed.|$|R
40|$|The rate-limiting step in {{transcriptional}} initiation typically {{is opening}} the promoter DNA {{to expose the}} template strand. Opening is tightly regulated, but how it occurs is not known. These experiments identify an activity, recognition of specific DNA <b>fork</b> <b>junctions,</b> and {{suggest that it is}} critical to bacterial promoter opening. This activity is both sequence and structure specific; it recognizes the bases that constitute the upstream double-stranded/single-stranded boundary of the open complex. Promoter mutations known to reduce opening rates lead to comparable reductions in <b>fork</b> <b>junction</b> binding affinity. The activity acts to establish the upstream boundary of melted DNA and works in conjunction with two single-stranded DNA binding activities that recognize separately the two melted strands. The junction binding activity is contained within the sigma factor component of the holoenzyme. The activity occurs in both a typical prokaryotic transcription system and in a eukaryotic-like bacterial system that responds to enhancers and needs ATP. Thus DNA opening catalyzed by <b>fork</b> <b>junction</b> binding may occur in a variety of systems in which DNA must be opened to be copied...|$|R
50|$|Prior to the {{junction}} with the A14 being created, {{there was a}} simple <b>fork</b> <b>junction,</b> opened in 1971, joining the M6 to the M1. At that stage traffic, travelling from Birmingham on the M6, wishing to travel North and East left the M6 at junction 1 to join the A426 road.|$|R
25|$|The rock {{formation}} {{underlying the}} area around the Oconaluftee-Raven <b>Fork</b> <b>junction</b> contains some of the oldest exposed rocks in the Eastern United States. This formation, which is composed primarily of an Early Precambrian basement rock known as granite gneiss, was formed over a billion years ago from the gradual accumulation of marine sediment and igneous rocks.|$|R
50|$|On 8 August 1852 the Maryport and Carlisle Railway {{opened a}} west-to-north curve from <b>Forks</b> <b>Junction</b> to Citadel, {{enabling}} {{direct access to}} Carlisle without reversal; from this time goods traffic also used this new connection. The new approach crossed the Canal line on the level; the M&CR were required to appoint a person to make signals at the passage of trains.|$|R
50|$|The short-line Grand Forks Railway {{is based}} out of Grand Forks. The company owns just 3.5 miles of track, which connects Roxul and Interfor with the Grand <b>Forks</b> <b>Junction</b> {{at the south}} end of town.

50|$|Queen's Road East (皇后大道東) runs between Wan Chai and Happy Valley. At {{the western}} end, Queen's Road East starts at a <b>fork</b> <b>junction</b> with Queensway and Hennessy Road near Justice Drive. Although {{situated}} inland {{and south of}} five trunk routes (Gloucester Road, Jaffe Road, Lockhart Road, Hennessy Road and Johnston Road) from the Victoria Harbour, Queen's Road East runs along the old, original shoreline of Hong Kong Island.|$|R
40|$|Bacterial RNA polymerases (RNAPs) are {{targets for}} antibiotics. Myxopyronin binds to the RNAP switch regions to block {{structural}} rearrangements needed for formation of open promoter complexes. Bacterial RNAPs containing the major variant p 54 factor are activated by enhancer-binding proteins (bEBPs) and transcribe genes whose products {{are needed in}} pathogenicity and stress responses. We show that (i) enhancer-dependent RNAPs help Escherichia coli {{to survive in the}} presence of myxopyronin, (ii) enhancer-dependent RNAPs par-tially resist inhibition by myxopyronin and (iii) ATP hydrolysis catalysed by bEBPs is obligatory for functional interaction of the RNAP switch regions with the transcription start site. We demonstrate that enhancer-dependent promoters contain two barriers to full DNA opening, allowing tight regula-tion of transcription initiation. bEBPs engage in a dual switch to (i) allow propagation of nucleated DNA melting from an upstream DNA <b>fork</b> <b>junction</b> and (ii) complete the formation of the transcription bubble and downstream DNA <b>fork</b> <b>junction</b> at the RNA synthesis start site, resulting in switch region-dependent RNAP clamp closure and open promoter complex formation...|$|R
40|$|The {{opening of}} {{specific}} segments of DNA {{is required for}} most types of genetic readout, including σ 70 -dependent transcription. To learn how this occurs, a series of single point mutations were introduced into σ 70 region 2. These were assayed for duplex DNA binding, DNA opening and DNA double strand–single strand <b>fork</b> <b>junction</b> binding. Band shift assays for closed complex formation implicated a series of arginine and aromatic residues within a minimal 26 amino acid region. Permanganate assays implicated two additional aromatic residues in DNA opening, known to form a parallel stack of the type that can accept a flipped-out base. Substitution for either of these aromatics {{had no effect on}} duplex probe recognition. However, when a single unpaired – 11 nucleotide is added to the probe, the mutants fail to bind appropriately to give heparin resistance. A model for DNA opening is presented in which duplex recognition by regions 2. 3, 2. 4 and 2. 5 of sigma positions the pair of aromatic amino acids, which then create the <b>fork</b> <b>junction</b> required for stable opening...|$|R
40|$|Results of binding assays using DNA <b>fork</b> <b>junction</b> probes {{indicate}} that sigma 54 contains multiple determinants that regulate melting to allow RNA polymerase {{to remain in}} closed promoter complexes in order to respond to enhancers. Gel mobility shift studies {{indicate that}} the - 12 promoter element and parts of sigma 54 act {{together to form a}} molecular switch that controls melting. The DNA sequences and the sigma 54 N-terminus help direct polymerase to the location within the - 12 promoter element where melting will initiate. However, the <b>fork</b> <b>junction</b> that would lead to melting does not form, due to the action of an inhibitory DNA element. Such unregulated melting is inhibited further by the lack of availability of the single-strand binding elements, which are needed to spread opening from the junction to the transcription start site. Thus, in the absence of looping enhancer protein, proper regulation is maintained as the sigma 54 polymerase remains bound in an inactive state. These complex protein-DNA interactions allow the controls over protein recruitment and DNA melting to be separated, enhancing the diversity of accessible mechanisms of transcription regulation...|$|R
50|$|Both {{of those}} lines were {{completed}} by 1893, when the Cherry Springs Railroad Company was created and completed {{the connection of}} 9 mi from Hull to about 2 mi from Cherry Springs, PA. The Cherry Springs Railroad literally connected the 14 mi Buffalo and Susquehanna Railroad (of 1891) with the 14 mi Susquehanna Railroad. This connecting line proceeded north west from Conrad, up the hill, to just past the first switchback, {{to the top of}} the hill, at Cross <b>Fork</b> <b>Junction.</b>|$|R
5000|$|If the [...] "modernisation" [...] {{seemed to}} {{concentrate}} on closing facilities, {{a major step forward}} was the resignalling of the Carlisle station area with a modern power signal box early in 1973. 74 route miles of the West Coast Main Line were taken into its control area, together with stubs to fringe signal boxes on many branches. The Bog <b>Junction</b> to <b>Forks</b> <b>Junction</b> route was reinstated as part of this work, to handle steel block trains between Workington and Tyne Yard.|$|R
5000|$|Starting at the {{junction}} with the A724, the road parallels the M74, following the original A74 (now B7078) before descending into the forested Clyde Valley as it skirts around the town of Larkhall. The road follows the meanders of the River Clyde, with some tight bends, sheer drops and adverse cambers. This section of the road passes through some villages before climbing {{the edge of the}} Clyde Valley to meet the A73 at a busy <b>forked</b> <b>junction</b> just north of Lanark.|$|R
25|$|The {{town has}} statues of three famous locals: Rupert Brooke, Thomas Hughes and William Webb Ellis. The Rupert Brooke statue is {{situated}} at the <b>forked</b> <b>junction</b> of Regent Street on the green and commemorates his contribution to poetry. Thomas Hughes' statue stands in the gardens of the Temple Reading Rooms (the central library of Rugby school) on Barby Road. Since England won the Rugby World Cup in 2003, the William Webb Ellis statue outside Rugby School {{is one of the}} most visited parts of the town.|$|R
40|$|Enhancer-dependent {{transcriptional}} activators {{that act}} upon the σ 54 bacterial RNA polymerase holoenzyme {{belong to the}} extensive AAA+ superfamily of mechanochemical ATPases. Formation and collapse of the transition state for ATP hydrolysis engenders direct interactions between AAA+ activators and the σ 54 factor, required for RNA polymerase isomerization. A DNA <b>fork</b> <b>junction</b> structure present within closed complexes serves as a nucleation point for the DNA melting seen in open promoter complexes and restricts spontaneous activator-independent RNA polymerase isomerization. We now provide physical evidence showing that the ADP·AlFx bound form of the AAA+ domain of the transcriptional activator protein PspF changes interactions between σ 54 -RNA polymerase and a DNA <b>fork</b> <b>junction</b> structure present in the closed promoter complex. The results suggest that one functional state of the nucleotide-bound activator serves to alter DNA binding by σ 54 and σ 54 -RNA polymerase and appears to drive events that precede DNA opening. Clear evidence for a DNA-interacting activity in the AAA+ domain of PspF was obtained, suggesting that PspF may make a direct contact to the DNA component of a basal promoter complex to promote changes in σ 54 -RNA polymerase–DNA interactions that favour open complex formation. We also provide evidence for two distinct closed promoter complexes with differing stabilities...|$|R
40|$|The {{distribution}} of lesions in DNA caused by (+/-) - 7 beta, 8 alpha-dihydroxy- 9 alpha, 10 alpha-epoxy- 7, 8, 9, 10 -tetrahydrobenzo [alpha]pyrene (B[alpha]P diol epoxide-I) was studied in synchronized C 3 H/ 10 T 1 / 2 cells treated in S phase. Sites of carcinogen modification of DNA {{were identified by}} polyclonal rabbit antibodies elicited against DNA modified with B[alpha]P diol epoxide-I in vitro. This antigenic DNA contained trans-(7 R) -N 2 -[10 -(7 beta, 8 alpha, 9 alpha-trihydroxy- 7, 8, 9, 10 -tetrahydrobenzo[alpha]pyrene) -yl]- deoxyguanosine; other adducts were not detected by liquid chromatography. In this study, DNA replication forks with antibodies bound to B[alpha]P diol epoxide-I adducts were detected by electron microscopy. The frequency of replication forks containing carcinogen adducts associated with the <b>fork</b> <b>junction</b> {{was found to be}} 8 -fold higher than expected for an average distribution. The proportion of replication forks that were apparently blocked {{at the site of the}} DNA damage increased when replication was allowed to occur after carcinogen exposure. These results support the conclusions that the <b>fork</b> <b>junction</b> is particularly vulnerable to adduction by B[alpha]P diol epoxide-I and that B[alpha]P diol epoxide-I adducts block the displacement of replication forks during DNA synthesis in intact cells...|$|R
50|$|Thiruvankulam is {{a suburb}} {{of the city of}} Kochi, in the state of Kerala, India. It is a part of Tripunithura Municipality and Kochi {{metropolitan}} area. In the days of the Kochi and Travancore kingdoms, Thiruvankulam was a border village. The Kavaleeshwaram stream, now a canal, separated the two kingdoms. The Kochi - Madurai National Highway (NH 49) passes through Thiruvankulam. It is a major <b>fork</b> <b>junction</b> on the highway from Kochi, going east towards Muvattupuzha and south towards Kottayam. Karingachira serves as a terminus of the Airport-Seaport road connecting Nedumbaseery and the Kochi port.|$|R
50|$|Wrexham's Croes Newydd {{locomotive}} shed {{was the last}} of the GWR 'northlight' designs, being a roundhouse and depending on a central turntable for access. It was built by the Great Western Railway and opened in 1902, to replace outdated facilities at Wheatsheaf junction. It was located in the centre of a large <b>fork</b> <b>junction,</b> with the Chester to Shrewsbury line running along one edge, and the branch being the Wrexham and Minera Branch. The sheds also featured a GWR combined water tower and coaling stage, of a design which was later to become standardised.|$|R

The estimated cost of Chouteau Lock & Dam was $ 31.8 million.|$|R
50|$|This is {{the last}} section of A72, where it is the {{secondary}} route on another primary road. It shares this 6 mile section with the A701. Just south of Blyth Bridge, it meets with the A721 which connects the western Scottish Borders towns of Peebles and Galashiels with the M8 at Newhouse. Less than a mile after this junction, it leaves {{the course of the}} A701. This junction of the A72 and A701 at Blyth Bridge is dangerous for travellers heading north as it is a <b>fork</b> <b>junction</b> which approaches the A72 from a higher position and on a very sharp bend.|$|R
50|$|There was {{an earlier}} east-to-north curve at St Nicholas {{that had been}} {{provided}} for M&CR trains to back into Citadel station in 1851. From the provision of the <b>Forks</b> <b>Junction</b> curve in 1852 M&CR trains ran in direct, and the curve had been used only for turning M&CR engines on the triangle it formed. The spur needed to be relocated {{to make way for}} the new main line, and a new east-to-north curve east of the new main line was opened for use by goods traffic on 30 April 1862. It was a single line at first, and was approved for doubling on 13 June 1864.|$|R

50|$|The A1151 {{starts at}} a {{roundabout}} where it meets the A147 (St Crispins dual carriageway and flyover to the west, and Barrack Street to the east) {{on the northern}} part of the Norwich inner ring road. The A1151 has various street names along its route, starting with Charlton Road, then Bull Close Road. At the junction with Magdalen Street and Magpie Road, the A1151 turns right, heading north, by the name of Magdalen Road. At the next Y-shaped <b>fork</b> <b>junction,</b> Magdalen Road continues on the left fork but changes into the B1150, whereas the A1151 takes the right fork, becoming Sprowston Road, and continues in a northeasterly direction.|$|R
40|$|Abasic substitutions in the {{non-template strand}} and {{promoter}} sequence {{changes were made}} to assess the roles of various promoter features in σ 70 holoenzyme interactions with <b>fork</b> <b>junction</b> probes. Removal of – 10 element non-template single strand bases, leaving the phosphodiester backbone intact, did not interfere with binding. In contrast these abasic probes were deficient in promoting holoenzyme isomerization to the heparin resistant conformation. Thus, {{it appears that the}} melted – 10 region interaction has two components, an initial enzyme binding primarily to the phosphodiester backbone and a base dependent isomerization of the bound enzyme. In contrast various upstream elements cooperate primarily to stimulate binding. Features and positions most important for these effects are identified...|$|R
40|$|Transcription {{initiation}} by the ς 54 -RNA polymerase holoenzyme {{requires an}} enhancer-binding protein that {{is thought to}} contact ς 54 to activate transcription. To identify potential enhancer-binding protein contact sites in ς 54, we compared the abilities of wild-type and truncated forms of Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium ς 54 {{to interact with the}} enhancer-binding protein DctD in a chemical cross-linking assay. Removal of two regions in the amino-terminal portion of ς 54, residues 57 to 105 and residues 144 to 179, prevented cross-linking, but removal of either region alone did not. In addition, deletion of 56 amino-terminal residues of ς 54 (region I) reduced the affinity of the protein for a <b>fork</b> <b>junction</b> DNA probe...|$|R
50|$|Helicases adopt {{different}} {{structures and}} oligomerization states. Whereas DnaB-like helicases unwind DNA as ring-shaped hexamers, other enzymes {{have been shown}} to be active as monomers or dimers. Studies have shown that helicases may act passively, waiting for uncatalyzed unwinding to take place and then translocating between displaced strands, or can play an active role in catalyzing strand separation using the energy generated in ATP hydrolysis. In the latter case, the helicase acts comparably to an active motor, unwinding and translocating along its substrate as a direct result of its ATPase activity. Helicases may process much faster in vivo than in vitro due to the presence of accessory proteins that aid in the destabilization of the <b>fork</b> <b>junction.</b>|$|R
50|$|When {{the first}} Compter burned down a {{replacement}} court room {{was built on}} the site and was in use from 1685. Its front was adorned with a statue of James II, just after his accession, the City's coat of arms and the Bridge House Mark. The court room was on the first floor, the ground floor was leased out as a tavern, 'The King's Arms'. The site is located at the <b>fork</b> <b>junction</b> of Borough High Street and Southwark Street, occupied now by the building which is named 'Town Hall Chambers' being licensed premises at the ground floor and apartments above.

50|$|In {{the early}} 1890s, the Buffalo and Susquehanna Railroad built a branch line {{to a small}} area known as Cross Fork. Eventually, the Lackawanna Lumber Company owned a big mill in Cross Fork, and the town quickly grew and became a center of logging {{activity}} for the Buffalo and Susquehanna Railroad. At its peak the town had about 2500 residents when the timber supply was exhausted and the Lackawanna mill closed in 1909. When the stave and heading mill closed in 1912, the population quickly fell from 2000 to 60. The stave mill was dismantled and shipped to Betula on the Potato Creek Railroad. In 1913, the B&S ended passenger service and abandoned the line. Tracks were removed in 1914 from Cross <b>Fork</b> <b>Junction</b> to Cross <b>Fork.</b>|$|R
