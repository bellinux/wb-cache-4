50|$|Tanks {{are often}} {{referred}} to by weight-based classifications such as 'light', 'medium' or 'heavy', and by extension the role that this size of tank was suitable for. There were many names given to different <b>tank</b> <b>types,</b> and similar names did not assure similar design goals. Some light tanks were relatively slow, and some were fast. Some heavy tanks had large-calibre, low-velocity, anti-infantry bunker-busters, and some had high-velocity anti-tank guns. Furthermore, expected weights for a given <b>tank</b> <b>type</b> vary over time; a medium tank of 1939 could weigh less than a light tank of 1945.|$|R

40|$|This {{document}} is a Phase I deliverable for the Single-Shell Tank Analysis of Record effort. This {{document is}} not the Analysis of Record. The intent of this document is to guide the Phase II detailed modeling effort. Preliminary finite element models {{for each of the}} <b>tank</b> <b>types</b> were developed and different case studies were performed on {{one or more of these}} <b>tank</b> <b>types.</b> Case studies evaluated include thermal loading, waste level variation, the sensitivity of boundary effects (soil radial extent), excavation slope or run to rise ratio, soil stratigraphic (property and layer thickness) variation at different farm locations, and concrete material property variation and their degradation under thermal loads. The preliminary analysis document reviews and preliminary modeling analysis results are reported herein. In addition, this report provides recommendations for the next phase of the SST AOR project, SST detailed modeling. Efforts and results discussed in this report do not include seismic modeling as seismic modeling is covered by a separate report. The combined results of both static and seismic models are required to complete this effort. The SST AOR project supports the US Department of Energy's (DOE) Office of River Protection (ORP) mission for obtaining a better understanding of the structural integrity of Hanford's SSTs. The 149 SSTs, with six different geometries, have experienced a range of operating histories which would require a large number of unique analyses to fully characterize their individual structural integrity. Preliminary modeling evaluations were conducted to determine the number of analyses required for adequate bounding of each of the SST <b>tank</b> <b>types</b> in the Detailed Modeling Phase of the SST AOR Project. The preliminary modeling was conducted in conjunction with the Evaluation Criteria report, Johnson et al. (2010). Reviews of existing documents were conducted at the initial stage of preliminary modeling. These reviews guided the topics that were explored in the SST preliminary modeling. The reviews determined the level of detail necessary to perform the analyses of the SSTs. To guide the Phase II detailed modeling effort, preliminary finite element models for each of the <b>tank</b> <b>types</b> were developed and different case studies were performed on one or more of these <b>tank</b> <b>types.</b> Case studies evaluated include thermal loading, waste level variation, the sensitivity of boundary effects (soil radial extent), excavation slope or run to rise ratio, soil stratigraphic (property and layer thickness) variation at different farm locations, and concrete material property variation and their degradation under thermal loads. Conclusions were derived from case studies on one of the <b>tank</b> <b>types</b> when no additional runs of similar cases on other <b>types</b> of <b>tanks</b> were found necessary to derive those conclusions. The document reviews provided relatively complete temperature histories for <b>Type</b> IV <b>tanks.</b> The temperature history data for Type I, II, and III tanks was almost nonexistent for years prior to 1975. Document reviews indicate that there might be additional useful data in the US Department of Energy, Richland Operations Office (DOE-RL) records in Seattle, WA, and these records need to be reviewed to extract data that might have been disregarded during previous reviews. Thermal stress analyses were conducted using different temperature distribution scenarios on <b>Type</b> IV <b>tanks.</b> Such studies could not be carried out for other <b>tank</b> <b>types</b> due to lack of temperature history data. The results from <b>Type</b> IV <b>tank</b> analyses indicate that factors such as temperature distribution in the tank waste and rate of rise in waste temperature have a significant impact on the thermal stresses in the tank structures. Overall, the conclusion that can drawn from the thermal stress analyses is that these studies should be carried out for all <b>tank</b> <b>types</b> during the detailed analysis phase with temperature values that are reasonably close to the typical temperature histories of the respective <b>tank</b> <b>types.</b> If and/or when additional waste temperature data is acquired for <b>tank</b> <b>Type</b> I, II, and III tanks, additional cases need to be considered as tank structural integrity is sensitive to thermal loads. A few case studies were also performed using Type IV-b models to comprehend the effects of excavation boundaries, change in soil stratigraphy (layer thickness and properties), and radial extent of soil in the finite element models. The result from the case studies indicates that the slight variation in soil stratigraphy has little effects on the tank sections force and moment demands under mechanical loads. The case study for excavation slope or backfill transition boundary indicated that inclusion of such boundary yields conservative demands in the wall region while demands at other locations remain unaffected. Hence this excavation slope will be modeled in the detailed analysis of SSTs...|$|R
