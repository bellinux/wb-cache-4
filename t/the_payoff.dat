5|$|There are {{numerous}} applications of matrices, both {{in mathematics and}} other sciences. Some of them merely {{take advantage of the}} compact representation of a set of numbers in a matrix. For example, in game theory and economics, <b>the</b> <b>payoff</b> matrix encodes <b>the</b> <b>payoff</b> for two players, depending on which out of a given (finite) set of alternatives the players choose. Text mining and automated thesaurus compilation makes use of document-term matrices such as tf-idf to track frequencies of certain words in several documents.|$|E

25|$|The Realtors stepped {{their offense}} {{on the third}} quarter, even leading at some points. But James Yap scored 20 of his 30 teams in <b>the</b> <b>payoff</b> period to lead Purefoods into a Game 7.

25|$|Hunt put {{pressure}} on the White House and the Committee to Re-Elect the President for cash payments to cover legal fees, family support, and expenses, for himself and his fellow burglars. Key Nixon figures, including Haldeman, Charles Colson, Herbert W. Kalmbach, John Mitchell, Fred LaRue, and John Dean eventually became entangled in <b>the</b> <b>payoff</b> schemes, and large amounts of money were passed to Hunt and his accomplices, to try to ensure their silence at the trial, by pleading guilty to avoid prosecutors' questions, and afterwards. Tenacious media, including The Washington Post and The New York Times, eventually used investigative journalism to break open <b>the</b> <b>payoff</b> scheme, and published many articles that proved to be {{the beginning of the end}} for the cover-up. Prosecutors had to follow up once the media reported. Hunt also pressured Colson, Dean, and John Ehrlichman to ask Nixon for clemency in sentencing, and eventual presidential pardons for himself and his cronies; this eventually helped to implicate and snare those higher up.|$|E
5000|$|The {{dilemma is}} {{described}} by a 2 x 2 payoff matrix that allows each player to choose between a cooperative and a competitive (or defective) move.

25|$|If {{this game}} is a {{coordination}} game, then the following inequalities hold in <b>the</b> <b>payoff</b> matrix for player 1 (rows): A>B,D>C, and for player 2 (columns): a>c,d>b.

This setup can be extended {{for more than two}} strategies (strategies are usually sorted so that the Nash equilibria are in the diagonal from top left to bottom right), as well as for a game with more than two players.|$|E

25|$|A typical {{case for}} a {{coordination}} game is choosing {{the sides of the}} road upon which to drive, a social standard which can save lives if it is widely adhered to. In a simplified example, assume that two drivers meet on a narrow dirt road. Both have to swerve in order to avoid a head-on collision. If both execute the same swerving maneuver they will manage to pass each other, but if they choose differing maneuvers they will collide. In <b>the</b> <b>payoff</b> matrix in Fig. 2, successful passing is represented by a payoff of 10, and a collision by a payoff of 0.|$|E
25|$|There {{is an easy}} {{numerical}} way {{to identify}} Nash equilibria on a payoff matrix. It is especially helpful in two-person games where players have more than two strategies. In this case formal analysis may become too long. This rule {{does not apply to}} the case where mixed (stochastic) strategies are of interest. The rule goes as follows: if the first payoff number, in <b>the</b> <b>payoff</b> pair of the cell, is the maximum of the column of the cell and if the second number is the maximum of the row of the cell - then the cell represents a Nash equilibrium.|$|E
25|$|Gameplay {{is similar}} to the 1990 U.S. revival; two rounds are played, with all six celebrities {{participating}} in both rounds, and each match is worth 50 points (100 points starting in season 2). The third round is called Match-Up!, with each contestant given 45 seconds to match/his her chosen celebrity partner, and successful matches are again worth 50 points (100 starting in season 2). The contestant with more points {{at the end of this}} round wins the game and receives the cash equivalent of their score (for example, if the champion's final score was 450 points, <b>the</b> <b>payoff</b> would be $450).|$|E
50|$|In game theory, a bimatrix {{game is a}} {{simultaneous}} game for two players in which each player has {{a finite number of}} possible actions.

An alternative type of solutions are share functions which assign to every player its share in <b>the</b> <b>payoffs</b> to be distributed...|$|R
25|$|Based on the {{analysis}} above, {{it is not}} hard to conclude that the threat of revolution constantly incentivizes the rich to democratize. The theory also resonates with Clark, Golder and Golder's paper Power and Politics: Insights from an Exist, Voice and Loyalty Game, in which the government decides between predate and not to predate citizens based on <b>the</b> <b>payoff</b> while the citizen has the option to exit (migrate to other countries), remain loyal and voice their concerns at a cost (protest). Similarly, this game also provides insights into how variables like exit payoff, cost of voicing and value of loyalty change state's behavior as to whether or not to predate.|$|E
25|$|The unique subgame perfect {{equilibrium}} (and every Nash equilibrium) {{of these}} games {{indicates that the}} first player take the pot on the very {{first round of the}} game; however, in empirical tests, relatively few players do so, and as a result, achieve a higher payoff than <b>the</b> <b>payoff</b> predicted by the equilibria analysis. These results are taken to show that subgame perfect equilibria and Nash equilibria fail to predict human play in some circumstances. The Centipede game is commonly used in introductory game theory courses and texts to highlight the concept of backward induction and the iterated elimination of dominated strategies, which show a standard way of providing a solution to the game.|$|E
25|$|In their model, {{a country}} starts as a nondemocratic {{society in which}} a small rich group {{controls}} most of the wealth and rules the poor majority. As the ruling class, the rich receive taxation from the economy's output and they decide on the taxation rate as {{the only means of}} extraction. The poor majority can either take what is offered to them by the rich after they tax the output (the economy's output after tax divided by the population size), or they can choose to revolutionize against the ruling class, which comes with a certain cost. In a revolution, the poor's ultimate payoff is the benefit of the revolution minus the cost of the revolution. Under that circumstance, <b>the</b> <b>payoff</b> of the rich ruling class is split between, when the poor revolutionizes, the punishment for the ruling class and when the poor acquiesces, the taxation income.|$|E
5000|$|If {{both players}} cooperate, they both receive the reward R for cooperating. If both players defect, they both receive <b>the</b> {{punishment}} <b>payoff</b> P.

30|$|Also, if X grows {{arbitrarily}} large <b>the</b> <b>payoffs</b> {{of players}} 2 and 3 grow arbitrarily large relatively {{to those of}} players 1 and 4 and therefore, if players 2 and 3 are treated kindly (by players 1 and 4), not only them, but the other member of their groups would have kind feelings and {{would want to be}} kind in return. Because in the outcome that maximizes the sum of <b>the</b> <b>payoffs</b> players 1 and 4 maximize <b>the</b> material <b>payoffs</b> of their opponents and Q(X) is a kind-game, both players are kind.|$|R
40|$|People tend {{to think}} by analogies. We {{investigate}} whether thinking-by-analogy matters for investors 2 ̆ 7 willingness-to-pay for a risky asset in a laboratory experiment. We find that thinking-by-analogy has a strong influence when the assets in question have similar (but not identical) <b>payoffs.</b> <b>The</b> hypothesis of thinking-by-analogy or coarse thinking clearly outperforms other hypotheses including the hypothesis of arbitrage-free or rational pricing. When the similarity between <b>the</b> <b>payoffs</b> is reduced, <b>the</b> risk neutral and risk averse hypotheses outperform the hypothesis of thinking-by-analogy.

25|$|Coordination {{games are}} {{closely linked to}} the {{economic}} concept of externalities, and in particular positive network externalities, the benefit reaped from being in the same network as other agents. Conversely, game theorists have modeled behavior under negative externalities where choosing the same action creates a cost rather than a benefit. The generic term for this class of game is anti-coordination game. The best-known example of a 2-player anti-coordination game is the game of Chicken (also known as Hawk-Dove game). Using <b>the</b> <b>payoff</b> matrix in Figure 1, a game is an anti-coordination game if Bnbsp&>nbsp&A and Cnbsp&>nbsp&D for row-player 1 (with lowercase analogues b > d and c > a for column-player 2). {Down, Left} and {Up, Right} are the two pure Nash equilibria. Chicken also requires that Anbsp&>nbsp&C, so a change from {Up, Left} to {Up, Right} improves player 2's payoff but reduces player 1's payoff, introducing conflict. This counters the standard coordination game setup, where all unilateral changes in a strategy lead to either mutual gain or mutual loss.|$|E
25|$|Title {{insurance}} differs {{in several}} respects from {{other types of}} insurance. Where most insurance is a contract where the insurer indemnifies or guarantees another party against a possible specific type of loss (such as an accident or death) at a future date, title insurance generally insures against losses caused by title problems that have their source in past events. This often results in the curing of title defects or the elimination of adverse interests from the title before a transaction takes place. Title insurance companies attempt to achieve this by searching public records to develop and document the chain of title and to detect known claims against or defects in the title to the subject property. If liens or encumbrances are found, the insurer may require that steps be taken to eliminate them (for example, obtaining a release of an old mortgage or deed of trust that has been paid off, or requiring <b>the</b> <b>payoff,</b> or satisfying involuntary liens such as abstracts of judgment and tax liens) before issuing the title policy. In the alternative, it may except from the policy's coverage those items not eliminated. Title plants are sometimes maintained to index the public records geographically, {{with the goal of}} increasing searching efficiency and reducing claims. In some states title plants are required to index the real-property records geographically and also maintain a name file for judgments, probates and other general matters.|$|E
500|$|For non-playable races, {{the team}} {{designed}} Smarties to have oversized heads, bulging eyes, and idiotic personalities for comedic effects.

Standard enemies include Reaper Guards (male Reapers with no magical ability, who serve as common soldiers), {{as well as}} fauna such as the insectoid Rippers, beast-of-burden Sonaks, and bat-like Verms.|$|E
30|$|The FE {{evaluates the}} {{kindness}} of a player towards another player (for clarity we will refer to both players as “giver” and “receiver”) {{as a function of}} <b>the</b> <b>payoffs</b> <b>the</b> receiver gets. Because <b>the</b> <b>payoffs</b> of <b>the</b> receiver depend not only on the actions of the giver, but also on her own actions, the FE assumes that a player (“spectator”), who can be the giver or the receiver, evaluates the kindness based on <b>the</b> <b>payoffs</b> <b>the</b> spectator believes the giver wants to give to the receiver. For this, Rabin assumes that the spectator has beliefs not only about the actions of the receiver, but also about the beliefs the giver has about the actions of the receiver). The SRE extends the concept of reciprocity for more players, by assuming that the spectator has beliefs about the actions of all other players and about the beliefs of the giver.|$|R
