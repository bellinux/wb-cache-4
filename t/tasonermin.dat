TNF, being an endogenous pyrogen, is able to induce fever, apoptotic cell death, cachexia, inflammation and to inhibit tumorigenesis and viral replication and respond to sepsis via IL1 & IL6 producing cells. [...] Dysregulation of TNF production has been implicated {{in a variety of}} human diseases including Alzheimer's disease, cancer, major depression, psoriasis and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD).
