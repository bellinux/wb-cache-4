5|$|Myers {{resigned}} from the bank in 1867 and moved to Hornellsville, New York. There he bought a photography gallery and ran <b>the</b> <b>business</b> <b>for</b> several years. Myers met Mary Hawley in Hornellsville and married her on November 8, 1871. She was 7 years younger, being born in 1849. In 1873 Myers took up an interest in making hydrogen gas and ballooning. The couple moved back to Mohawk from Hornellsville in 1875 and began activities of balloon manufacturing and flying. Mary became his lab assistant and later a balloon pilot known as Carlotta, the Lady Aeronaut.|$|E
5|$|After the war, {{he started}} selling {{bicycles}} and motorbikes {{in a small}} shop in Brunswick Street, in the Kensington Fields area of Liverpool. He began selling and recharging batteries in 1925, opening a shop {{in the front room}} of his family's three-storey Georgian terraced house, called Phillips’ Battery Charging Depot, and had to install large accumulators in the cellar. Phillips ran <b>the</b> <b>business</b> <b>for</b> 30 years, even during WWII, but due to a decline in demand for batteries in the early 1950s (most people having electricity by then) he started selling household electrical goods. By late 1954, the shop was only selling records and record players; customers would buy recordings of American Country and Western, and Big Band music. As Phillips had supplied batteries to the Burtonwood air base during the war, he could buy and sell the latest records from America via his contacts there.|$|E

5|$|Coffin {{moved to}} the Cincinnati area in 1847, where {{he took over the}} {{management}} of a wholesale warehouse of free-labor goods. With the intention of returning to Newport, Indiana, after fulfilling his obligation in Cincinnati, Coffin rented out his Newport business and made arrangements for his Indiana home to continue serving as an Underground Railroad stop. At Cincinnati his first task was working with the eastern organizations to set up a steady supply of free-labor goods for the business. The enterprise's ongoing problem was the poor quality of its goods. Coffin had difficulty procuring free goods, such as cotton, sugar, and spices, whose quality was competitive with the goods produced by slave labor. With inferior quality goods to sell, he had a difficult time finding purchasers for the goods. The problem plagued <b>the</b> <b>business</b> <b>for</b> years, causing the enterprise constant financial struggles.|$|E
5|$|In 1922, Robertson-Cole {{underwent}} a major reorganization as the company's founders departed, though the corporation remained under majority British ownership. The flagship U.S. distribution business {{changed its name}} to Film Booking Offices of America, a banner under which R-C had released more than a dozen independent productions. The West Coast studio apparently continued to make films under the Robertson-Cole name for some time, but FBO ultimately became the primary identity of <b>the</b> <b>business</b> <b>for</b> production as well as distribution. Between the 1922 reorganization and October 1923, one of the company's new American investors, Pat Powers, was effectively in command. Powers had previously led his own filmmaking company, part of the multiple merger that created the large Universal studio in 1912. Powers apparently changed the name of Robertson-Cole/FBO to the Powers Studio for a brief period, though there is no record of the company ever having produced or released a film under that banner. In 1923, the studio launched a series of boxing-themed shorts, Fighting Blood, starring George O'Hara. He would become an FBO mainstay, often paired with Alberta Vaughn, in such comedy series as The Pacemakers (1925). Most of O'Hara's and Vaughn's films for the studio were two-reelers—a measure of film length indicating a running time of about twenty minutes.|$|E

25|$|Stokes {{returned}} to England in 1857, where he married his cousin Julia. He {{returned to}} the Swan River Colony with his pregnant wife, however she died after giving birth.

25|$|By 1880, {{the company}} was in serious {{financial}} difficulties. The Russian debts were never paid, and a dubious method was used to write off the loss made on the marine engines. Despite a successful call to shareholders for more money, the company chose voluntary liquidation as the best option in July 1880. Liquidators ran <b>the</b> <b>business</b> <b>for</b> {{three and a half}} years, during which time turnover increased and profits of £9,419 were made. In September 1883, the second Yorkshire Engine Company was launched, by issuing 2,400 shares valued at £25, giving a capital of £60,000. Few locomotive manufacturers were profitable at the time.|$|E

Scott was Seddon's preferred candidate for the Liberal Party, as {{he was also a}} prohibitionist and would thus draw votes from Tommy Taylor, whom Seddon tried to keep out of Parliament.|$|E

25|$|The only {{variation}} to {{this arrangement}} occurred between May 1, 1857 to May 1, 1861, when Morgan's other son-in-law, Charles A. Whitney, joined the firm as co-manager. During this period, Morgan conveyed the Works to {{the ownership of}} Quintard and Whitney for the sum of $250,000, giving Whitney a one-third {{stake in the company}} and Quintard the remainder. The two manager-owners took out a $67,000 mortgage on the property to raise operating capital. After Whitney left the firm to pursue other business interests, Morgan returned as sole owner, purchasing <b>the</b> <b>business</b> <b>for</b> its sale price of $250,000 as of a few years prior, and settling the mortgage himself.|$|E
25|$|Having a keen {{investment}} eye for value, Slim {{adhered to}} his value investment practices {{with a long}} history of buying stakes in companies he sees as undervalued. Much of Slim's business dealings involved a simple strategy, which is to buy a business and hang on to it for its cash flow or eventually sell the stake at a greater profit in future, thereby netting the capital gains as well as reinvesting the initial principal into a new business. In addition, his conglomerate structure allows Slim to purchase numerous stakes that it is made nearly recession proof if one or more sectors of the economy do not do well. Slim also doesn't address the finer details of the business but instead focuses on business fundamentals where his strategy is buy an asset at an undervalued price for its underlying cash flow and eventually sell his stake for greater profit when the asset gains value, or simply hang to <b>the</b> <b>business</b> <b>for</b> its cash flow.|$|E
