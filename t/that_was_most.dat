5|$|Being a quintessential part of vespers, evensong or matins, the Magnificat was, already {{for over}} a century before Bach's composition, the liturgical text <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>most</b> often set to music apart from the Mass ordinary. In Protestantism there was no Latin text more often set to music than the Magnificat. Also {{settings}} of the German text of the Magnificat were current from the early 17th century, without one form suppressing the other.|$|E

5|$|Blue's Clues {{was set in}} the home—the {{environment}} <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>most</b> {{familiar and}} secure for preschoolers—and looked like no other children's television show. Each episode was in development, from idea development to final production, for approximately one year. Writers created a goal sheet, which identified their objectives based on the show's curriculum and audience needs. Script drafts, once developed {{and approved by the}} show's creators and research team, were tested at public and private schools, day care centers, preschools, and Head Start programs by three researchers, who would narrate the story {{in the form of a}} storybook and take notes about the children's responses. The writers and creators revised the scripts based on this feedback. A rough video, in which the host performed from the revised script in front of a blue screen with no animation, was filmed and retested. The script was revised based on the audiences' responses, tested a third time with animation and music added, and incorporated into future productions.|$|E
5|$|Gaudí also practiced landscaping, {{often in}} urban settings. He aimed to place his {{works in the}} most {{appropriate}} natural and architectural surroundings by studying the location of his constructions thoroughly and trying to naturally integrate them into those surroundings. For this purpose, he often used the material <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>most</b> common in the nearby environment, such as the slate of Bellesguard and the grey Bierzo granite in the Episcopal Palace, Astorga. Many of his projects were gardens, such as the Güell Park and the Can Artigas Gardens, or incorporated gardens, as in the Casa Vicens or the Güell Pavilions. Gaudí's harmonious approach to landscaping is exemplified at the First Mystery of the Glory of the Rosary at Montserrat, where the architectural framework is nature itself—here the Montserrat rock—nature encircles the group of sculptures that adorned {{the path to the}} Holy Cave.|$|E
5|$|In early 2010, Collingwood led the England Twenty20 {{team to the}} 2010 World Twenty20 championship. Collingwood {{appeared}} in all seven games, struggling with the bat as he scored only 61 runs at 10.16, with the ball he only bowled one over for ten runs, however his prowess in the field continued – his four catches the joint highest with the wicket keeper, Craig Kieswetter, for the England team. It was Collingwood's captaincy <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>most</b> praised, as he led England to their first ever ICC trophy, hitting the winning runs in their seven-wicket victory over Australia in the final.|$|E

5|$|The Dorset is {{an ancient}} breed <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>most</b> likely {{developed}} from horned sheep that lived in the valleys and pastures of southwestern England. Dorset Horn sheep were imported into the United States in 1860, and the first U.S. national flock book was formed in 1891. Today, the Dorset is found in two varieties globally, Horned and Polled. In the Horn variety, both ewes and rams have horns, while the polled variety have no horns at all. Polled Dorsets are ideal for commercial settings {{because they do not}} have horns that can get caught in fencing or cause damage when they butt.|$|E
5|$|William Morton Wheeler {{comments}} that P. longiceps were possibly an arboreal nesting species. This means the ant {{did not live}} in the soil and nested in trees instead. He assumed this due to its long legs, strong claws and long mandibles; Prionomyrmex was also assumed to be predacious, equipped with a well developed and powerful sting <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>most</b> likely used to kill prey. Prionomyrmex may have preferred a jungle habitat at low elevations, and is even more primitive in its body structure than Myrmecia. Female stylopids were known to parasite Prionomyrmex ants.|$|E

25|$|The Norwegian sealing vessel Spidsbergen with captain Nils Fredrik Rønnbeck and harpooner Johan Petter Aidijärvi aboard sailed {{northeast}} from Svalbard in 1865 {{in search}} of suitable sealing sites and found an archipelago <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>most</b> likely Franz Josef Land. They named the area Nord-Øst Spidsbergen (Northeast Spitsbergen) or Rønnebeck Land. However, an announcement of the discovery was never made and the archipelago remained unknown until the following expedition. It {{was at that time}} common to keep newly discovered areas secret to avoid competition for sealing and whaling from other vessels.|$|E

Paterno was angered that Penn State wide receiver Tony Johnson caught a pass with both feet in bounds according to the stadium's video replay board, but the play was ruled an incompletion.|$|E

25|$|The minaret, which {{occupies}} {{the center of}} the northern facade of the complex's enclosure, is 31.5 meters tall and is seated on a square base of 10.7 meters on each side. It is located inside the enclosure and does not have direct access from the outside. It consists of three tapering levels, the last of which is topped with a small ribbed dome <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>most</b> probably built later {{than the rest of the}} tower. The first and second stories are surmounted by rounded merlons which are pierced by arrowslits. The minaret served as a watchtower, as well as to call the faithful to prayer.|$|E
25|$|Since polluting {{nations were}} to be held {{responsible}} for harms caused to another nation's environment, this was not applicable in the arbitration because the players involved were sub-groups of each nation's population and the populus <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>most</b> affected were not the sovereign states but the sub-groups. Although Canada accepted responsibility for the actions of the smelting plant, conflict resolution put the onus on Canada to compensate for COMINCO's past pollution rather than forcing COMINCO to prevent future harm to U.S. soil. The legacy of this decision includes the eventual creation of regulatory regimes to prevent environmental degradation, which allow nations to put states in charge of taking positive steps to control pollution. The failure by states to meet these responsibilities means they are breaching international law.|$|E
25|$|Indian Christian art and {{architecture}} during the British Raj has expanded into several different styles {{as a result of}} extensive church building {{in different parts of the}} country. The style <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>most</b> patronised is generally referred to as the British Regency style which included Neo-Gothic and Gothic Revival architecture. Most Protestant cathedrals and churches in India conform to this style. St. Paul's Cathedral, Kolkata is a typical example of the Gothic Revival style. St. Mary's church, Chennai, the first Anglican Church built east of the Suez is one of the first examples of British colonial architecture in India. French and Danish influences on Christian art {{and architecture}} in India can be seen in their respective colonies. Today one can see a harmonious blending of the East and the West in the Christian {{art and architecture}} of India.|$|E
