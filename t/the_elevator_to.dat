5|$|On {{very rare}} occasions, a {{combination}} of the weight distribution of the train, the force of the launch, and the wind can stall a train {{on the top of the}} tower. When this happens, a mechanic takes <b>the</b> <b>elevator</b> <b>to</b> the top and pushes the train down the hill.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>elevator</b> <b>to</b> the {{commuter}} rail platform was also temporarily {{out of service}} for maintenance during the same period; a shuttle bus ran between Harvard, Porter and Waltham. The Red Line elevator was returned to service on June 22, 2012, and {{the commuter}} rail elevator returned to service on July 30, 2012.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of a 2006 {{settlement}} of a lawsuit filed by the Boston Center for Independent Living and a group of individuals, the MBTA installed additional elevators at Porter and four other busy MBTA subway stations. <b>The</b> <b>elevator</b> <b>to</b> the Red Line was out of service for 15 months beginning in March 2011 for car replacement and the installation of a second, redundant, elevator. An accessible shuttle bus ran between Porter and Davis.|$|E

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>elevator</b> is a {{moveable}} part of {{the horizontal}} stabilizer, hinged {{to the back of}} the fixed {{part of the}} horizontal tail. <b>The</b> <b>elevators</b> move up and down together. When the pilot pulls the stick backward, <b>the</b> <b>elevators</b> go up. Pushing the stick forward causes <b>the</b> <b>elevators</b> <b>to</b> go down. Raised elevators push down on the tail and cause the nose to pitch up. This makes the wings fly at a higher angle of attack, which generates more lift and more drag. Centering the stick returns <b>the</b> <b>elevators</b> <b>to</b> neutral and stops the change of pitch. Some aircraft, such as an MD-80, use a servo tab within <b>the</b> <b>elevator</b> surface <b>to</b> aerodynamically move the main surface into position. The direction of travel of the control tab will thus be in a direction opposite to the main control surface. It is for this reason that an MD-80 tail looks like it has a 'split' elevator system.|$|R
5|$|Joseph Meegar (Ebon Moss-Bachrach), a shy {{delivery}} boy {{who lives}} with his mother (Marylouise Burke), arrives late for work and delivers a package to an office building where he comes across Bethany (Diane Davis), a receptionist with whom he's infatuated. Afterward, while in an elevator, Bethany notices Meegar has pictures of her on his cell phone. Meegar's angst then apparently causes <b>the</b> <b>elevator</b> <b>to</b> fall to the underground parking lot levels, killing all but Meegar. He is able to walk away unharmed, but is then startled as all the car alarms go off around him.|$|E
5|$|Unarmed at first, Hawkins {{entered the}} south {{entrance}} of the Von Maur department store at about 1:36p.m. CST (19:36 UTC). After walking a short distance into the store, he scanned the area, turned around and left. Returning six minutes later through the same entrance, he proceeded directly to the elevator at his immediate right, {{this time with a}} Century WASR-10 (a commercial copy of the AKM (7.62×39mm) semi-automatic rifle) stolen from his stepfather's house, along with two 30-round magazines taped together, concealed in a sweatshirt. He took <b>the</b> <b>elevator</b> <b>to</b> the top floor.|$|E
5|$|In {{an article}} {{published}} in the newspaper Fremover (Narvik, Norway), in May 1994, the English aviation engineer Hugh Tyrer stated that the cause of the accident was probably due to fatigue in the end piece of the transfer mechanism to the elevator. The end piece was in such a state that it would have failed sooner or later in ordinary use. Following this discovery in the wreck, Widerøe had grounded all their Twin Otters and checked these pieces, but without finding any other defect parts. de Havilland Canada had also sent an alert to all operators of the Twin Otter to check the component, and had canceled the contract with the subcontractor. On 800 operating Twin Otters, 86 end pieces were replaced shortly after the accident, although none had fatigue similar to that of LN-BNS. The commission's chair, Ragnar Rygnestad, stated that they had not considered the end piece {{to be part of the}} cause of the accident, and that they therefore had not stress-tested it or <b>the</b> <b>elevator</b> <b>to</b> see what forces were needed to cause a crack. Rygnestad stated that the board knew about the fatigue. He also said that he had no problems with the opening of a new inquiry. Widerøe stated that they trusted the report from the Accident Investigation Board.|$|E

25|$|In 1943, the Lisbon Electric Tramway Ltd. {{solicited}} {{the city}} council to authorize the transfer of <b>the</b> <b>elevator</b> <b>to</b> the Companhia da Carris.

25|$|During {{the fair}} it cost $2 to take <b>the</b> <b>elevator</b> <b>to</b> its {{observation}} deck. The tower {{served as a}} restaurant and featured food items such as the Sunburger and a rum and fruit juice cocktail called the Sunburst. In {{the early morning hours}} on May 12, 1982, a shot was fired from outside the fair site and shattered one of the sphere's windows. No one was ever arrested for the incident.|$|E
25|$|Each Nike battery {{consisted}} {{of two or three}} areas; IFC, LA and general. The LA consisted to a maximum of four launching sections, each section {{consisted of}} an underground storage area, an elevator to move missiles to and from the surface launchers, and four aboveground firing locations. One of these locations was directly above the elevator, the others were reached by manually pushing the missiles off <b>the</b> <b>elevator</b> <b>to</b> the launcher along rails. The LA also had a control van to control and monitor the LA activities and maintenance facilities.|$|E
5000|$|This {{activity}} typically {{takes place}} when there isn't much movement with <b>the</b> <b>elevators,</b> which lowers <b>the</b> risk and involvement. Accomplices will sometimes press {{buttons on the}} inside of <b>the</b> <b>elevators</b> <b>to</b> provide <b>the</b> movement. Movement can also be provided by means of service controls located on top of <b>the</b> <b>elevator</b> car, which allow complete control over the movement of <b>the</b> <b>elevator,</b> but at a reduced speed.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>elevator</b> {{paradox is}} a paradox first noted by Marvin Stern and George Gamow, {{physicists}} who had offices on different floors of a multi-story building. Gamow, {{who had an}} office {{near the bottom of}} the building noticed that <b>the</b> first <b>elevator</b> <b>to</b> stop at his floor was most often going down, while Stern, who had an office near the top, noticed that <b>the</b> first <b>elevator</b> <b>to</b> stop at his floor was most often going up.|$|R
50|$|The IRT {{portion of}} the station is very deep and {{requires}} <b>the</b> use of <b>elevators</b> <b>to</b> reach <b>the</b> platform after fare control, which is on a full length mezzanine above the higher IND portion. Another set of <b>elevators</b> connecting <b>the</b> IND platforms and tracks to the mezzanine, and an <b>elevator</b> between <b>the</b> mezzanine <b>to</b> the street, make that portion handicapped-accessible. The IRT section is not ADA accessible since the platforms have no <b>elevators</b> (reaching <b>the</b> <b>elevators</b> <b>to</b> fare control requires climbing short staircases).|$|R
25|$|On 21 July 1980, Bitar {{was shot}} dead in Paris. That morning, he {{received}} a telephone call to meet a journalist {{at the office of}} al-Ihiyyaa al-Arabi. As he was exiting <b>the</b> <b>elevator</b> <b>to</b> enter his office, his assassin fired two shots {{to the back of his}} head. The identity of his killer was never discovered, but it was reported that Assad ordered the assassination. At the time, Bitar had reported to local authorities in France that he had received death threats by mail and telephone. He took personal measures by limiting his movements.|$|E
25|$|Hightower {{claimed that}} the natives were angry to have their beloved god taken, and that they {{threatened}} that the idol would curse him. On New Year's Eve, 1899, Hightower {{held a press conference}} about his expedition to Africa, followed by a huge party. Hightower boasted about how he acquired the idol and denied claims of it being cursed. Just as he left the party, he mocked the idol, using its head to put out his cigar. Around midnight, he entered <b>the</b> <b>elevator</b> <b>to</b> retire to his private apartments in the hotel penthouse. As the elevator neared the top, the idol came to life.|$|E
25|$|Linklater {{assembled}} the cast {{for two weeks}} of rehearsals in Austin, Texas before principal photography began in order to fine-tune the script. The result was a fusion of Linklater's writing, the novel and the actors' input. To prepare for their respective roles, Cochrane came up with his character five minutes before he got on <b>the</b> <b>elevator</b> <b>to</b> work; Downey Jr. memorized his dialogue by writing it all out in run-on sentences, studying them and then converting them to acronyms; and Reeves relied on the book, marking down each scene in the screenplay to the corresponding page.|$|E
50|$|Depending on {{the static}} margin, humans {{may not be}} able to use control inputs <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>elevators</b> <b>to</b> control <b>the</b> pitch of the vehicle. Typically, {{computer}} based autopilots are required to control the vehicle when it has negative static stability - usually described as negative static margin.|$|R
25|$|It is {{possible}} that the turbulence caused the torque tube driving <b>the</b> port <b>elevator</b> <b>to</b> break; this would allow <b>the</b> port <b>elevator</b> <b>to</b> move freely, but the pilots would still retain approximately half of their attitude control. The aircraft also had a defective push–pull rod and worn steering cables, although it is not certain if this was part of the cause.|$|R
50|$|A set of rails led aft from <b>the</b> catapults <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>elevators</b> {{and into}} <b>the</b> hangars. For catapult-assisted launches, {{aircraft}} would be hoisted in the hangar onto a portable collapsible catapult carriage, raised on <b>the</b> <b>elevators</b> <b>to</b> flight deck level and then trundled {{forward on the}} rails to the catapult starting positions, the same system as employed on Graf Zeppelin.|$|R
25|$|Because Taihōs hangars were {{completely}} enclosed, mechanical ventilation {{was the only}} means of exhausting fouled air and replacing it with fresh. Ventilation duct gates were opened on either side of hangar sections No. 1 and No. 2 and, for a time, the carrier's aft elevator was lowered to try to increase the draught. But even this failed to have any appreciable effect and, in any case, air operations were resumed about noon, requiring <b>the</b> <b>elevator</b> <b>to</b> be periodically raised as aircraft were brought up to the flight deck. In desperation, damage control parties used hammers to smash out the glass in the ship's portholes.|$|E
25|$|He took <b>the</b> <b>elevator</b> <b>to</b> the {{executive}} reception {{area on the}} third floor and, as soon as the doors opened, fired at receptionists Sharon Needy, whom he killed, and Angela Bowman, whom he paralyzed with a shot in the back. Searching for Standard Gravure's President, Michael Shea, and other supervisors and managers of the plant, Wesbecker calmly walked through the hallways, deliberately shooting at people. He killed James Husband and injured Forrest Conrad, Paula Warman and John Stein, a bindery supervisor whom he shot in the head and abdomen. Wesbecker then headed {{down the stairs to the}} pressroom, where he killed Paul Sallee and wounded Stanley Hatfield and David Sadenfaden, two electricians from Marine Electric who were working on a broken machine.|$|E
25|$|Kileak: The DNA Imperative is a first-person shooter, {{in which}} the player {{controls}} an International Peacekeeping Force (IPKF) polar operative Matt Coda in an armored SJ 107 assault suit. The player can advance and retreat, move {{from side to side}} and rotate the camera in any direction. The game is set in a South Pole observation base, which is composed of floors connected by elevators. On each floor, the player must find an elevator in order to proceed to the level below. The requirements are varied between floors, with many levels requiring the use of key cards to open locked doors, while some doors are opened by puzzle solving. On reaching <b>the</b> <b>elevator</b> <b>to</b> the next floor, the player can save their progress to a memory card that fits into the accompanying PlayStation.|$|E
5000|$|When {{the flight}} was 13 {{kilometers}} away from the runway, the crew set the flaps at 15°. At 8 kilometers from the runway the aircraft entered the glide path, after which the flaps were set to 35°. 16 seconds later, the crew increased the engine power to maintain a consistent speed of 260 km/h. The flight was already, 40 meters above the glidepath and the pilots adjusted <b>the</b> <b>elevators</b> from 1 <b>to</b> 5° deflection, only for <b>the</b> <b>elevators</b> <b>to</b> spontaneously go to 15° deflection.|$|R
50|$|Two WWA {{employees}} {{had been scheduled}} to perform routine off-hours maintenance on the DNS servers that Monday morning.

25|$|Back at the garden, Lucy is {{planting}} seeds {{around the}} well, when Jacinda arrives {{to take her}} to Bainbridge Island across the lake, so they can be together and escape from Victoria. When they arrive at the town line, Jacinda's car breaks down and <b>the</b> <b>elevator</b> <b>to</b> the docks has been closed, which Lucy believes means they're trapped in Hyperion Heights, much like the residents of Storybrooke were. At the police station, Victoria interrupts Henry and Rogers to ask the officer to help find Lucy and Jacinda, believing that Henry knows something. Victoria's daughter Ivy and Officer Rogers find the pair, who have decided to stay and fight Victoria's claim. As Ivy gives Rogers Lucy's Once Upon a Time book, and insists that it be thrown away, Rogers catches sight of a specific page featuring a picture of Emma Swan.|$|E
25|$|In 1960, age 64, Breuning was {{diagnosed}} with colon cancer. It was successfully treated and the cancer did not return. Breuning {{did not have any}} other health issues until he broke his hip at the age of 108. He spent eight days in the hospital and was totally healed in 21 days. In November 2007 at the age of 111, Breuning was fitted with hearing aids. The week before his 113th birthday in September 2009, Breuning fell and bruised his scalp, but was otherwise unhurt. Breuning was in excellent health, walking unaided and refusing to use <b>the</b> <b>elevator</b> <b>to</b> reach his second floor apartment until he broke his hip. Breuning began to slow down physically in his last year, requiring first a walker and then a motor scooter to get around although his mental state was undiminished to the end.|$|E
25|$|It is {{uncertain}} which Allied unit {{was first to}} reach the Kehlsteinhaus; several claim the honor, compounded by confusion with the town of Berchtesgaden, which was taken on May 4 by forward elements of the 7th Infantry Regiment of the 3rd Infantry Division. Reputedly members of the 7th {{went as far as}} <b>the</b> <b>elevator</b> <b>to</b> the Kehlsteinhaus, with at least one individual claiming he and a partner continued on to the top. However, the 101st Airborne maintains it was first both to Berchtesgaden and the Kehlsteinhaus. Also, elements of the French 2nd Armored Division, Laurent Touyeras, Georges Buis and Paul Répiton-Préneuf, were present on the night of May 4 to 5, and took several photographs before leaving on May 10 at the request of US command, and this is supported by testimonies of the Spanish soldiers who went along with them.|$|E
5000|$|February 1963: Northwest Airlines Flight 705 - A Northwest Airlines Boeing 720B was {{hit with}} a {{powerful}} updraft (it suddenly began climbing at 9,000 ft. per minute) while climbing through 17,000 ft as it tried to fly between thunderstorms shortly after takeoff. The nose pitched up so high that the pilot reacted by using full nose-down trim on the horizontal stabilizer (HS), while simultaneously pushing <b>the</b> <b>elevators</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> full down position. Then, an equally powerful down draft hit the plane and it went straight down in a matter of seconds. The pilot then pulled back on the yoke, moving <b>the</b> <b>elevators</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> full up position. This imposed high G-load on the plane, resulting in binding of the horizontal stabilizer jackscrew, such that it remained in a full trimmed down position. The plane came apart in the air, before hitting the ground.|$|R
