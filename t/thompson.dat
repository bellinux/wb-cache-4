5|$|Boston manager Art Ross {{predicted}} that <b>Thompson,</b> now 35, would {{play for the}} Red Wings {{for at least another}} five seasons; however, <b>Thompson</b> remained with the team for only two seasons before retiring from playing.

5|$|Brimsek {{started the}} 1938–39 {{season with the}} Reds, {{but he would not}} stay long with them. During an NHL {{exhibition}} game, <b>Thompson</b> got injured and it was unlikely that <b>Thompson</b> would recuperate in time for the beginning of the regular season. Needing a replacement, Brimsek was called up by the Bruins. In his NHL debut, Brimsek helped his team defeat the Toronto Maple Leafs by a score of 3–2. He started in net for one more game, a 4–1 victory against the Red Wings, before being sent back down to the Reds as <b>Thompson</b> recovered. Art Ross, the Bruins' coach and general manager, had seen enough of Brimsek during his two stints in Boston to contemplate promoting Brimsek full-time with the Bruins. <b>Thompson</b> was traded to the Detroit Red Wings for goaltender Normie Smith and $15,000.00 U.S. cash on November 16, 1938, after playing only five games with the Bruins. Ross then proceeded to promote Brimsek as the team's new starting goalie. This did not sit well with Bruins fans as <b>Thompson</b> was a favorite and he was the reigning Vezina Trophy winner.|$|E

5|$|Former Georgetown University {{basketball}} coach John <b>Thompson</b> had originally booked a ticket on Flight 77. As {{he would tell}} the story {{many times in the}} following years, including a September 12, 2011 interview on Jim Rome's radio show, he had been scheduled to appear on that show on September 12, 2001. <b>Thompson</b> was planning to be in Las Vegas for a friend's birthday on September 13, and initially insisted on traveling to Rome's Los Angeles studio on the 11th. However, this did not work for the show, which wanted him to travel {{on the day of the}} show. After a Rome staffer personally assured <b>Thompson</b> that he would be able to travel from Los Angeles to Las Vegas immediately after the show, <b>Thompson</b> changed his travel plans.

5|$|From {{the time}} <b>Thompson</b> took control until {{shortly after the}} Second World War, the News-Miner lacked a {{dedicated}} connection to the Associated Press.

This system later was replaced by a dedicated contract with the Alaska Communications System, but that contract limited the News-Miner to no more than 9,000 words per day of messages.|$|E
5|$|Having won the battle, Nelson {{needed to}} send despatches to his commander, Vice-Admiral Earl St. Vincent {{reporting}} on {{the destruction of the}} French Mediterranean fleet. These messages were entrusted to Captain Edward Berry, who had served as Nelson's flag captain on HMS Vanguard during the battle. <b>Thompson</b> was ordered to escort Berry to St. Vincent, believed to be with the blockade squadron off Cadiz, in Leander. Although Leander had not suffered serious damage in the battle, <b>Thompson</b> had manning problems: casualties from the Battle of Santa Cruz de Tenerife in July 1797 had never been replaced, 14 men had been wounded in the battle at Aboukir Bay and two officers and fifty men had been detached to man the captured French prizes. This left <b>Thompson</b> with just 282 men on board Leander. Following Nelson's orders, <b>Thompson</b> sailed on 5 August.|$|E
