This will then hopefully lead to an sharp increase in productivity and a certain satisfaction for the particular individual, as they will soon realise they have more time do other necessary tasks and commitments.|$|E

5000|$|Temporal {{motivation}} theory (TMT) is an integrative motivational theory. Developed by Piers Steel and Cornelius J. König, {{the theory}} emphasizes {{time as a}} critical, motivational factor. The argument for a broad, integrative theory stems from {{the absence of a}} single theory that can address motivation in its entirety. Thus, it incorporates primary aspects of multiple major theories, including expectancy theory, hyperbolic discounting, need theory and cumulative prospect theory. According to Schmidt, Dolis and Tolli, Temporal Motivation Theory [...] "may help further the understanding of the impact of time, and particularly deadlines, on dynamic attention allocation." [...] The Temporal Motivation Theory formula can be applied to <b>the</b> <b>human</b> <b>behaviour,</b> procrastination and to goal setting. According to Lord, Diefenforff, Schmidt and Hall, the theory [...] "models the motivating power of approaching deadlines, arguing that the perceived utility of a given activity increases exponentially as the deadline nears. These and similar ideas have been applied to the pervasive phenomenon of procrastination".|$|E
