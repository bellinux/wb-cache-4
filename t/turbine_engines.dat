5|$|Danton was a semi-dreadnought {{battleship}} of the French Navy and {{the lead}} ship of her class. She was a technological leap in battleship development for the French Navy, as {{she was the first}} ship in the fleet with <b>turbine</b> <b>engines.</b> However, like all battleships of her type, she was completed after the Royal Navy battleship , and as such she was outclassed before she was even commissioned.|$|E
5|$|In 1913–1914 two Kaiser-class ships, Kaiser and König Albert {{took part}} in a major {{overseas}} tour to South America and South Africa. The cruise was designed to demonstrate German power projection, as well as to test the reliability of the new <b>turbine</b> <b>engines</b> on long-range operations. Both ships had returned to the German bases in the North Sea by the outbreak of World War I.|$|E
5|$|Of the 218tonnes of {{platinum}} sold in 2014, 98tonnes {{were used}} for vehicle emissions control devices (45%), 74.7tonnes for jewelry (34%), 20.0tonnes for chemical production and petroleum refining (9.2%), and 5.85tonnes for electrical applications such as hard disk drives (2.7%). The remaining 28.9tonnes went to various other minor applications, such as medicine and biomedicine, glassmaking equipment, investment, electrodes, anticancer drugs, oxygen sensors, spark plugs and <b>turbine</b> <b>engines.</b>|$|E
50|$|As {{the name}} suggests, gas <b>turbine</b> <b>engine</b> {{compressors}} provide the compression {{part of the}} gas <b>turbine</b> <b>engine</b> thermodynamic cycle. There are three basic categories of gas <b>turbine</b> <b>engine</b> compressor: axial compressor, centrifugal compressor and mixed flow compressor.

40|$|The {{stability}} of start-up process of <b>turbine</b> <b>engine</b> {{is the foundation}} of its operation. The process of starting performance optimization is very complex, and the experiment is dangerous, so it is very necessary to make the simulation study on the <b>turbine</b> <b>engine</b> starting process. In this paper, the mathematical model of <b>turbine</b> <b>engine</b> in starting process was established, according to the JetCat-P 400 <b>turbine</b> <b>engine</b> starting process principle, using the experimental data of engine ground operation and the actuator voltage data. The simulation results showed the validity of the model...|$|R
2500|$|A <b>turbine</b> <b>engine</b> {{failure occurs}} when a <b>turbine</b> <b>engine</b> in an {{aircraft}} unexpectedly stops producing thrust or power production due to a malfunction other than fuel exhaustion, although the term [...] "turbine engine failure" [...] can also apply to failure of any <b>turbine</b> <b>engine,</b> such as ground based turbines used in power plants, turbine-engined vessels (i.e. CODAG [...] ) and vehicles, etc.|$|R
5|$|Arthur William Radford {{was born}} on 27 February 1896 in Chicago, to John Arthur Radford, a Canadian-born {{electrical}} engineer, and Agnes Eliza Radford (née Knight). The eldest of four children, he was described as bright and energetic in his youth. When Arthur {{was six years old}} the family moved to Riverside, Illinois, where his father {{took a job as a}} managing engineer with Commonwealth Edison Company. John Radford managed the first steam <b>turbine</b> <b>engines</b> in the United States, at the Fisk Street Generating Station.|$|E
5|$|Leipzig and Nürnberg {{were the}} {{follow-on}} class {{to the three}} Königsberg-class ships. They were built to a modified design, which included returning the aft turrets to the centerline. Another major change was a new gear system that allowed the diesel and <b>turbine</b> <b>engines</b> to run at the same time, which permitted a lighter propulsion system to reach the same speed of the earlier ships. They were also fitted with bulbous bows to improve their hydrodynamic efficiency. The two cruisers were not identical: Leipzig had a superstructure similar to the Königsbergs, while Nürnberg was built with a much larger structure. Nürnberg was also completed with a much stronger anti-aircraft battery.|$|E
5|$|Operational {{experience}} had found Blackburn's Firebrand strike fighter {{to be far}} from suited to carrier operations. In particular, the pilot sat near the wing's trailing edge, looking over a very long and wide nose which gave a particularly poor view for landing. The Firecrest had also been rendered obsolete {{by the arrival of}} gas <b>turbine</b> <b>engines,</b> and while Blackburn did draw up proposals for turboprop-powered derivatives of the Firecrest, (as the B-62 (Y.A.6) with the Armstrong Siddeley Python engine), these went unbuilt, with orders instead going to Westland for the Wyvern. The two flying prototypes remained in use until 1949, being sold back to Blackburn in 1950, and were later scrapped.|$|E

The ship was also provided with an emergency [...] Rover gas <b>turbine</b> <b>engine,</b> the first gas <b>turbine</b> <b>engine</b> installed in a Canadian naval vessel. This gave the ship a maximum speed of 20 kn. The ship had a complement of 11 officers and 131 ratings.|$|R
5000|$|The {{aircraft}} gas <b>turbine</b> <b>engine</b> system, patent number 5,867,979, is a gas <b>turbine</b> <b>engine</b> that {{is mounted}} on an aircraft, which the system generates and utilizes electrical and other power. The gas <b>engine</b> <b>turbine</b> system’s core {{is made up of}} a compressor, a three shaft propulsive gas <b>turbine</b> <b>engine,</b> which has three electrical generators. Each generator is connected to one segment of the shaft, {{which is part of the}} engine. Then a propulsive fan is driven by the compressor and the generators. [...] The engine including many independent shafts is connected to the <b>turbine</b> <b>engine,</b> which is connected to the compressor that is connected to the fan. Each of the shafts independently and directly is powered by an electrical generator.|$|R
5|$|Ordered {{under the}} {{contract}} name Ersatz Hagen {{as a replacement}} for the obsolete coastal defense ship , Kaiserin was laid down at the Howaldtswerke dockyard in Kiel in November 1910. She was launched on 11 November 1911, after which fitting-out work was completed. At the launching ceremony, Admiral Hans von Koester gave a speech and Princess Victoria Louise christened the ship. A dockyard crew delivered the ship to the Navy on 13 May 1913; she was commissioned into the fleet the following day. During trials the ship's <b>turbine</b> <b>engines</b> were damaged, and Kaiserin did not join the fleet until 13 December 1913.|$|E
5|$|The two cruisers {{ordered in}} the 1905–1906 program {{represented}} a continuation in the slow, upward trend in displacement, {{though the two}} ships had the same top speed as the earlier Königsberg-class ships. Like the preceding classes, one ship was equipped with <b>turbine</b> <b>engines,</b> and one with reciprocating machinery; {{this was to be}} the last time a German cruiser utilized the older triple-expansion engines. All subsequent designs adopted steam turbines universally. Dresden and Emden had very active and short careers. Both vessels served on foreign stations for the majority of their careers; Emden was assigned to the East Asia Squadron after she entered service, and Dresden spent much time off the North American Atlantic coast.|$|E
5|$|Upon commissioning, {{the ship}} was {{assigned}} to the Atlantic Fleet, alongside her sister Delaware. Her first overseas cruise came in November 1910, when she steamed across the Atlantic to visit France and Britain. North Dakota also took part in the invasion of Vera Cruz in 1914. Unlike her sister, North Dakota remained off the American coast {{for the duration of the}} United States' involvement in World War I. Hugh Rodman, the commander of the American expeditionary force, specifically requested that North Dakota be kept stateside; he felt her <b>turbine</b> <b>engines</b> were too unreliable for the ship to be deployed to a war zone.|$|E

40|$|A {{software}} {{was developed for}} estimating the overall design layout details of gas <b>turbine</b> <b>engine</b> starter. Using this software {{the weight of a}} gas <b>turbine</b> <b>engine</b> starter to develop a power of 96 KW was calculated for different combinations of compressor pressure ratio and turbine entry temperatures. The weight estimation of the gas <b>turbine</b> <b>engine</b> starter was validated with the weights of the commercially available starters. For three commercially available starters supplied by the sponsorer the off-design performance were predicted at different flight and altitude condition. These three commercial starter performance were compared. This software package {{can be used as a}} preliminary tool to asses the performance of gas <b>turbine</b> <b>engine</b> starters...|$|R
5000|$|Huebner {{described}} the automobile <b>turbine</b> <b>engine</b> as {{something similar to}} that of a jet aircraft engine. It had one spark plug and about 80% fewer parts than a typical conventional piston engine in most cars. The <b>turbine</b> <b>engine</b> in the test cars produced 130 horsepower and idled at around 20,000 revolutions per minute. When the car was driven at 120 miles per hour, the <b>turbine</b> <b>engine</b> ran at its maximum speed of 60,000 revolutions per minute. The automobile <b>turbine</b> <b>engine</b> could operate using diesel fuel, unleaded gasoline, kerosene, and JP-4 jet fuel, although it could not run on leaded gasoline without being damaged. Chrysler claimed it could burn a variety of fuels from peanut oil to perfume.|$|R
5|$|The British ships {{set off in}} pursuit, and by 12:50, Sturdee's two battlecruisers had {{overtaken}} the Germans. A minute later, he {{gave the}} order to open fire at the trailing German ship, Leipzig. Von Spee ordered the three small cruisers to try to escape to the south, while he turned back with Scharnhorst and Gneisenau {{in an attempt to}} hold off the British squadron. Sturdee had foreseen this possibility, and so had ordered his armored and light cruisers to pursue the German light cruisers. The battlecruisers quickly overwhelmed von Spee's armored cruisers, and destroyed them with heavy loss of life. Dresden, with her <b>turbine</b> <b>engines,</b> was able to outpace her pursuers, and was the only German warship to escape destruction. Lüdecke decided to take his ship into the islands off South America to keep a steady supply of coal available.|$|E
5|$|The nickel-based {{superalloys}} {{have improved}} creep strength {{with the addition}} of rhenium. The alloys normally contain 3% or 6% of rhenium. Second-generation alloys contain 3%; these alloys were used in the engines for the F-15 and F-16, whereas the newer single-crystal third-generation alloys contain 6% of rhenium; they are used in the F-22 and F-35 engines. Rhenium is also used in the superalloys, such as CMSX-4 (2nd gen) and CMSX-10 (3rd gen) that are used in industrial gas <b>turbine</b> <b>engines</b> like the GE 7FA. Rhenium can cause superalloys to become microstructurally unstable, forming undesirable TCP (topologically close packed) phases. In 4th- and 5th-generation superalloys, ruthenium is used to avoid this effect. Among others the new superalloys are EPM-102 (with 3% Ru) and TMS-162 (with 6% Ru), as well as TMS-138 and TMS-174.|$|E
