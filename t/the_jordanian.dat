5|$|As the SAS {{operation}} concluded, the Chinooks ferried {{prisoners and}} bodies from Gberi Bana to <b>the</b> <b>Jordanian</b> battalion of UNAMSIL. From there, the bodies would {{be identified and}} buried, and those prisoners identified as West Side Boys would be {{handed over to the}} Sierra Leonean Police. Operation Barras also freed 22 Sierra Leonean civilians who had been held captive by the West Side Boys—the men were used as servants and put through crude military training by the West Side Boys, possibly with the intention of forcing them to fight in the future, while the women were used as sex slaves. Planners had been concerned that West Side Boys might try to conceal themselves among the civilians and so the civilians were also restrained and taken to <b>the</b> <b>Jordanian</b> peacekeepers' base to be identified. A 23rd civilian was caught in the crossfire and killed during the assault.|$|E

Dayton, the {{rationale}} for choosing this location [...] "is pretty simple.

The Israelis trust <b>the</b> <b>Jordanians,</b> and <b>the</b> <b>Jordanians</b> were anxious to help." ...|$|R

50|$|After the 1967 war, {{the army}} was rearmed. In 1968, the army defended Jordan against Israeli troops that had invaded Jordanian {{territory}} in pursuit of Palestinian guerrillas - the Battle of Karameh. Palestinians claim a victory just for resisting Israeli troops; <b>the</b> <b>Jordanians</b> say that they forced the Israelis back; the Israelis say that they pulled back after hitting the Palestinians at which time they were bombed by <b>the</b> <b>Jordanians.</b>|$|R
5|$|By 25 September, <b>the</b> <b>Jordanian</b> army {{achieved}} dominance, and {{two days}} later Arafat and Hussein agreed to a ceasefire in Amman. <b>The</b> <b>Jordanian</b> army inflicted heavy casualties on the Palestinians—including civilians—who suffered approximately 3,500 fatalities. After repeated violations of the ceasefire from both the PLO and <b>the</b> <b>Jordanian</b> Army, Arafat called for King Hussein to be toppled. Responding to the threat, in June 1971, Hussein ordered his forces to oust all remaining Palestinian fighters in northern Jordan, which they accomplished. Arafat {{and a number of}} his forces, including two high-ranking commanders, Abu Iyad and Abu Jihad, were forced into the northern corner of Jordan. They relocated near the town of Jerash, near the border with Syria. With the help of Munib Masri, a pro-Palestinian Jordanian cabinet member, and Fahd al-Khomeimi, the Saudi ambassador to Jordan, Arafat managed to enter Syria with nearly two thousand of his fighters. However, due to the hostility of relations between Arafat and Syrian President Hafez al-Assad (who had since ousted President Salah Jadid), the Palestinian fighters crossed the border into Lebanon to join PLO forces in that country, where they set up their new headquarters.|$|E
5|$|In July 1962, Algeria became {{independent}} of France. As a staunch {{political and financial}} supporter of the Algerian independence movement, Nasser considered the country's independence to be a personal victory. Amid these developments, a pro-Nasser clique in the Saudi royal family led by Prince Talal defected to Egypt, along with <b>the</b> <b>Jordanian</b> chief of staff, in early 1963.|$|E
5|$|Jordan {{signed a}} {{military}} pact with Egypt just before Israel launched {{a preemptive strike}} on Egypt to begin the Six-Day War in June 1967, where Jordan and Syria joined the war. The Arab states were defeated and Jordan {{lost control of the}} West Bank to Israel. The War of Attrition with Israel followed, which included the 1968 Battle of Karameh where the combined forces of <b>the</b> <b>Jordanian</b> Armed Forces and the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) repelled an Israeli attack on the Karameh camp on <b>the</b> <b>Jordanian</b> border with the West Bank. Despite the fact that the Palestinians had limited involvement against the Israeli forces, the events at Karameh gained wide recognition and acclaim in the Arab world. As a result, the time period following the battle witnessed an upsurge of support for Palestinian paramilitary elements (the fedayeen) within Jordan from other Arab countries. The fedayeen activities soon became a threat to Jordan's rule of law. In September 1970, <b>the</b> <b>Jordanian</b> army targeted the fedayeen and the resultant fighting led to the expulsion of Palestinian fighters from various PLO groups into Lebanon, in a civil war that became known as Black September.|$|E
50|$|The Israelis {{broke through}} the compound's western gate and began {{clearing}} the building with grenades, before General Odd Bull, commander of the UN observers, compelled the Israelis to hold their fire, telling them that <b>the</b> <b>Jordanians</b> had already fled. The Israelis proceeded to take the Antenna Hill, directly behind Government House, and clear {{out a series of}} bunkers to the west and south. The fighting, often conducted hand-to-hand, continued for nearly four hours before <b>the</b> surviving <b>Jordanians</b> fell back to trenches held by the Hittin Brigade, which were steadily overwhelmed. By 6:30 pm, <b>the</b> <b>Jordanians</b> had retreated to Bethlehem, having suffered about 100 casualties. All but ten of Dreizin's soldiers were casualties, and Dreizin himself was wounded three times.|$|R
50|$|From the American Colony, the paratroopers moved {{towards the}} Old City. Their {{plan was to}} {{approach}} it via the lightly defended Salah al-Din Street. However, they made a wrong turn onto the heavily defended Nablus Road. The Israelis ran into fierce resistance. Their tanks fired at point-blank range down the street, while the paratroopers mounted repeated charges. Despite repelling repeated Israeli charges, <b>the</b> <b>Jordanians</b> gradually gave way to Israeli firepower and momentum. The Israelis suffered some 30 casualties - half the original force - while <b>the</b> <b>Jordanians</b> lost 45 dead and 142 wounded.|$|R

5|$|On May 25, 1948, {{during the}} battle for the Old City, {{commander}} of <b>the</b> <b>Jordanian</b> Arab Legion, Major Abdullah el-Tell, wrote to Otto Lehner of the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement to warn that unless the Haganah abandoned its positions in the synagogue and its adjoining courtyard, he would be forced to attack it. Moshe Russnak, commander of the Haganah in the Old City, ignored his request, knowing that if the Hurva fell, {{the battle for the}} Jewish Quarter would soon be lost. On May 26, 1948, <b>the</b> <b>Jordanian</b> Arab Legion delivered an ultimatum to the Jews to surrender within 12 hours; otherwise the Hurva would be bombarded.|$|E
5|$|Palestinian groups used to {{initiate}} few attacks on Israeli targets {{from both the}} West Bank and Jordan before the Six-Day War, some of which caused Israel to retaliate which {{became known as the}} Reprisal operations. Following the seizure of the West Bank from Jordan in the June 1967 Six-Day War, Israel destroyed the existing Palestinian group Fatah networks there. In early 1968, however, Fatah guerrillas began raiding Israel from bases on <b>the</b> <b>Jordanian</b> side of the river. Most of these attacks were blocked by the Israel Defense Forces. At times, Jordanian Army infantry and artillery units gave the Fatah squads covering fire, leading to frequent direct skirmishes between the IDF and <b>the</b> <b>Jordanian</b> Army.|$|E

5|$|AQI {{launched}} {{a series of}} attacks in Jordan in late 2005 that were partially based out of Anbar. The group had already unsuccessfully attacked the Trebil checkpoint along <b>the</b> <b>Jordanian</b> border with Anbar Province in December 2004. In August, two US warships in Aqaba, the USS Kearsarge and the USS Ashland, were attacked with rockets; the cell which carried out the attacks then fled into Iraq. On 9 November, three Iraqis from Anbar carried out suicide bombings in Amman, killing 60. A fourth bomber, also from Anbar, was caught.|$|E

5|$|During the 1948 Arab-Israeli War the Old City {{together}} with the Wall was controlled by Jordan. Article VIII of the 1949 Armistice Agreement provided for Israeli Jewish access to the Western Wall.
