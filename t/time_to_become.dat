5|$|Diffusion {{may also}} have had a {{significant}} effect on the evolution of primordial cosmic magnetic fields, fields which may have been amplified over <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>become</b> galactic magnetic fields. However, these cosmic magnetic fields may have been damped by radiative diffusion: just as acoustic oscillations in the plasma were damped by the diffusion of photons, so were magnetosonic waves (waves of ions travelling through a magnetised plasma). This process began before the era of neutrino decoupling and ended at the time of recombination.|$|E
5|$|In 1942, {{the ship}} was requisitioned by the War Shipping Administration, which {{transferred}} her to the Soviet Union {{under the terms of}} Lend-Lease in December 1942. She was assigned to the Far East Shipping Company under her new name of SSTashkent, but sailed with the Soviet Pacific Fleet throughout the war. She delivered cargo and troops in support of the Soviet invasion of Japanese-held territories in August 1945. After the war, the ship remained a part of the Soviet merchant fleet until 1966. She was transferred to North Korea at that <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>become</b> a fish processing facility, and was scrapped in 1969.|$|E
40|$|We {{construct}} {{families of}} pairs of Heegaard splittings {{that must be}} stabilized several <b>times</b> <b>to</b> <b>become</b> equivalent. The first such pair differs only by their orientation. These are genus n splittings of a closed 3 -manifold that must be stabilized at least n − 2 <b>times</b> <b>to</b> <b>become</b> equivalent. The second {{is a pair of}} genus n splittings of a manifold with toroidal boundary that must be stabilized at least n − 4 <b>times</b> <b>to</b> <b>become</b> equivalent. The last example is a pair of genus n splittings of a closed 3 -manifold that must be stabilized at least 1 2 n − 3 <b>times</b> <b>to</b> <b>become</b> equivalent, regardless of their orientations. All of these examples are splittings of manifolds that are obtained from simpler manifolds by gluing along incompressible surfaces via “sufficiently complicated” maps...|$|R

5|$|Rail {{transportation}} {{in the village}} began in 1880 with the small Whitson's Station on the New York City & Northern Railroad (later the New York and Putnam Railroad); the station was rebuilt by Walter Law in 1906 {{in the style of}} his Briarcliff Lodge, with Mission style furniture and rugs. The old station was moved to Millwood, New York around that <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>become</b> its station; it fell out of use and was demolished May 9, 2012, although plans exist {{for the construction of a}} replica. Law's Briarcliff station became the public library in 1959.|$|E
5|$|The smell {{has been}} {{described}} as initially faint and honey-sweet, but strengthening over <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>become</b> overpowering, sickly-sweet and objectionable. Young specimens first emerge from the ground resembling a white egg covered by a universal veil, which then breaks, leaving the volva as a remnant. The spore print is white, a common feature of Amanita. The transparent spores are globular to egg-shaped, measure 8–10μm (0.30.4mil) long, and stain blue with iodine. The gills, in contrast, stain pallid lilac or pink with concentrated sulfuric acid.|$|E
5|$|Unlike {{atmospheric}} convection—the ordinary {{process of}} lower, warm air rising—inversions leave cooler air suspended below warm air, preventing the lower air from rising and trapping airborne pollutants that would ordinarily disperse in the atmosphere. Such weather events are common, {{but they are}} usually followed by a strong cold front that brings an influx of clean air and disperses pollutants before they have enough <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>become</b> highly concentrated; in this case, a cold front approaching west through southern Canada was delayed. When explained in less formal terms, the process of an inversion causing a smog event {{has been compared to}} a lid that holds in pollutants or a balloon that fills with pollutants. In general, smog events occur not because of a sudden increase in a region's output of pollution, but rather because weather conditions like stagnant air prevent the dispersal of pollutants that were already present.|$|E

5|$|The two new Panther battalions – the 51st and 52nd – {{together}} {{equipped with}} 200 Panthers, {{for which the}} offensive had been delayed, were attached to the Großdeutschland Division in the XLVIII Panzer Corps of Army Group South. With the 51st and 52nd Battalions arriving on 30 June and 1 July, the two units had little time to perform reconnaissance or to orient themselves to the terrain they found themselves in. This was a breach of the methods of the Panzerwaffe, considered essential for the successful use of armour. Though led by experienced panzer commanders, many of the tank crews were new recruits and had little <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>become</b> familiar with their new tanks, let alone train together {{to function as a}} unit. The two battalions came direct from the training ground and lacked combat experience. In addition, the requirement to maintain radio silence until the start of the attack meant that the Panther units had little training in battalion-level radio procedures. Furthermore, the new Panthers were still experiencing problems with their transmissions, and proved mechanically unreliable. By the morning of 5 July, the units had lost 16 Panthers due to mechanical breakdown, leaving only 184 available for the launching of the offensive.|$|E
5|$|Ultimately Chongju was {{the furthest}} north that the 27th British Commonwealth Brigade was to penetrate, and on 1 November, {{while still in}} divisional reserve, the brigade was ordered to pull back to Pakchon {{in an attempt to}} {{consolidate}} the western flank. Immediately following their success at Unsan, the Chinese 117th Division of the 39th Army—under the overall command of Zhang Jiecheng—attacked southward, intending to cut off the retreating UN forces and in so doing eliminate the remnants of the ROK 1st Infantry Division and US 1st Cavalry Division by cutting the road junction at Pakchon. Meanwhile, the Chinese 38th and 40th Armies approached along the Chongchon River from the east. 3 RAR remained at Chongju, however, {{due to a lack of}} transport, while the remainder of the brigade moved south; now the most forward element on the US Eighth Army's left flank, the battalion soon became isolated without communications or armour and artillery support. Finally, on 2 November, US Army trucks became available, and the battalion completed its move south without incident, harbouring in the bed of the Taeryong River that evening. Meanwhile, it was announced that Green would be temporarily replaced by Walsh, who he had himself replaced in Japan several months before. Walsh, by then an observer at US Eighth Army headquarters, was urgently posted back to 3 RAR to resume command, despite his lack of operational experience as an infantry commander. Taking over amid difficult circumstances following Green's death, and with little <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>become</b> acquainted with the battalion, Walsh's inexperience soon told as the local situation deteriorated.|$|E
