5|$|Human Entertainment's Dance Aerobics was {{an early}} rhythm-based video game {{released}} in 1987, and allows players to create music by stepping on Nintendo's Power Pad peripheral for the NES video game console. The 1996 title PaRappa the Rapper has been credited as the first true rhythm game, and {{as one of the}} first music-based games in general. It requires players to press buttons in the order that they appear on the screen, a basic mechanic that formed <b>the</b> <b>core</b> <b>of</b> <b>future</b> rhythm games. The success of PaRappa the Rapper sparked the popularity of the music game genre. In 1997, Konami released the DJ-themed rhythm game Beatmania in Japanese arcades. Its arcade cabinet features buttons similar to those of a musical keyboard, and a rubber pad that emulates a vinyl record. Beatmania was a surprise hit, inspiring Konami's Games and Music Division to change its name to Bemani in honor of the game, and to begin experimenting with other rhythm game concepts. Its successes include GuitarFreaks, which features a guitar-shaped controller, and 1998's Pop'n Music, a game similar to Beatmania in which multiple colorful buttons must be pressed. While the GuitarFreaks franchise continues to receive new arcade releases in Japan, it was never strongly marketed outside of the country. This allowed Red Octane and Harmonix to capitalize on the formula in 2005 with the Western-targeted Guitar Hero. In general, few Japanese arcade rhythm games were exported abroad because of the cost of producing the peripherals and the resulting increases in retail prices. The 1999 Bemani title DrumMania featured a drum kit controller, and could be linked with GuitarFreaks for simulated jam sessions. Similarly, this concept was later appropriated by Harmonix for their game Rock Band.|$|E

40|$|Several {{arguments}} {{suggest that}} quasars at z > 4 {{may be in}} <b>the</b> <b>cores</b> <b>of</b> <b>future</b> giant ellipticals, and forming at the very highest peaks of the primordial density field. A strong bias-driven primordial clustering is then expected in these fields, which are naturally interpreted as <b>the</b> <b>cores</b> <b>of</b> <b>future</b> rich clusters. High-redshift quasars can thus be used as markers {{of some of the}} earliest galaxy formation sites. Recent discoveries of (proto) galaxy companions of z > 4 quasars, and hints of strong clustering among high-z quasars give some support to this idea. The frequency of companions is much higher than is expected for a general field, or the upper limits for comparable redshifts in the HDF. Clustering of quasars themselves at z > 3 or 4 may reflect the primordial large-scale structure. Comment: Invited review, to appear in Fundamental Parameters in Cosmology, proc.

50|$|Taichung Station has {{the biggest}} space of all THSR stations. It {{is located in}} Wuri (烏日) District, 8 km from downtown. The station is elevated. The {{development}} included the High Speed Railway Station, Taiwan Railway Station, bus transit, parking lots, public squares, supporting facilities, and the road system for the adjacent areas.The architectural image of the Taichung Station integrates the regional transit through middle Taiwan and is a gateway to Taichung. It is <b>the</b> <b>core</b> <b>of</b> <b>future</b> development and will determine {{the image of the}} entire city. The planning had three levels: regional, citywide and street-level. The building group with vertical volume is designed in accordance with regional considerations; the stations with the same structure are designed in accordance with city-level concerns; the supporting facilities are designed to respond to the street-level needs of the site.In addition to the images and local elements applied in design, the capacity of the buildings, the nature of the space, the potential of the neighboring districts, the convenience of the traffic square, and the contrast of vertical and horizontal volumes of the buildings that constitute the skyline are all considered. The horizontal volume of the station is due to the conditions of the site, the functions, and development regulations. Therefore, the contrast created by the vertical volumes of the supporting structures can characterize the space and enhance the image of the architecture in the surroundings. The images of the supporting facilities are suggestive, and the image of the stations is revealing.The three stories above ground are constructed of SRC, and the structure is shared by the building and the rails. A foyer, bus transit area, generator room, parking lot, and taxi waiting lines are on the ground floor. The lobby, shops, and staff offices are on the second floor.

Nanostructuring (decreasing dimensions) and nanoarchitecturing (combining or assembling several nanometer-scale building blocks) are landmarks in the development of high-performance electrodes for with long cycle lifes and high safety. Numerous works reviewed herein have shown higher performances for such electrodes, but mostly give diverse values that show no converging tendency towards future development. The lack of knowledge about interface processes and defect dynamics of electrodes, as well as the missing cooperation between material scientists, electrochemists, and battery engineers, are reasons for the currently widespread trial-and-error strategy of experiments. A concerted action between all of these disciplines is a prerequisite for the <b>future</b> development <b>of</b> electrochemical energy storage devices...|$|R

Then, we conduct a comprehensive statistical analysis on the constructed futures trading networks. Empirical results show that the futures trading networks exhibit features such as scale-free behavior with interesting odd-even-degree divergence in low-degree regions, small-world effect, hierarchical organization, power-law betweenness distribution, disassortative mixing, and shrinkage of both the average path length and the diameter as network size increases.
