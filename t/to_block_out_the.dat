A male figure in a red Phrygian cap (a symbol of the French and American Revolutions) reclines with his arm around the waist of a female figure (identified as a bacchante by Sarah Burnage of the University of York). The female figure shades her eyes, either against the brightness of the angel or <b>to</b> <b>block</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> horror taking place in front of her.|$|E
5|$|The scenes {{on board}} the Queen Anne were filmed aboard the famous {{passenger}} liner RMS Queen Mary, which has long {{been used as a}} hotel. The X-Files crew spent a total of eleven days filming on the Queen Mary, and erected wrap-around scaffolding on the bridge in order <b>to</b> <b>block</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> lights of nearby Long Beach, California. To make it look like it was raining during the scenes on the bridge, the crew installed large sprinkler systems to provide a constant supply of water. Unhappy with the remodeled style of the ship's corridors and ballroom, Carter had portions of the ship recarpeted and redecorated to give the finished episode a late-1930s style.|$|E

5|$|Shots {{where the}} {{spacecraft}} had parts in motion or the perspective changed were shot by directly filming the model. For most shots {{the model was}} stationary and camera was driven along a track on a special mount, the motor of which was mechanically linked to the camera motor—making it possible to repeat camera moves and match speeds exactly. Elements of the scene were recorded on same piece of film in separate passes to combine the lit model, stars, planets, or other spacecraft in the same shot. In moving shots of the long Discovery One spacecraft, {{in order to keep}} the entire model in focus, multiple passes had to be made with the lighting on it blocked out section by section. In each pass the camera would be focused on the one lit section. Many matting techniques were tried <b>to</b> <b>block</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> stars behind the models, with film makers sometimes resorting to hand tracing frame by frame around the image of the spacecraft (rotoscoping) to create the matte.|$|E
25|$|In {{the first}} Test at Sophia Gardens, Strauss failed to {{capitalise}} on two starts, scoring 30 and 17; his second-innings dismissal, caught off a top-edged cut off Nathan Hauritz, was particularly poor. On a good batting wicket Australia racked up 674 for 6 declared, with Simon Katich (122), Ricky Ponting (150), Marcus North (125 not out) and Brad Haddin (121) all scoring centuries. In the second innings, only a dogged 5¾-hour 74 from Paul Collingwood and tail-end contributions salvaged a draw for England, with final pair James Anderson and Monty Panesar left <b>to</b> <b>block</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> final 11½ overs of the match.|$|E
25|$|A {{crowd of}} a couple of hundred saw Bangladesh's opening batsman Javed Omar hit three {{boundaries}} in the opening overs, but he was run out by Russel Arnold, and from then on, Bangladesh lost wickets regularly. No partnership passed 30 until that of the very last wicket, by which time it was all too late. Dilhara Fernando started the procession, deceiving Tushar Imran and Mohammad Ashraful to send them back for single-figure scores, and joint top-scorer Shahriar Nafees was fourth to fall, giving a return catch to Dilshan. Following Nafees' dismissal, Bangladesh quickly crashed to 103 for 8, with fast bowler Farveez Maharoof taking three wickets. Eventually, Bangladesh needed 143 for the last wicket off 98 deliveries, and Khaled Mashud and Tapash Baisya opted <b>to</b> <b>block</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> overs instead - while the Sri Lankan captain gave the ball to his spinners to get the match over with quickly, the three seamers Chaminda Vaas, Fernando and Maharoof only bowling 20 of a possible 30 overs.|$|E

500|$|Filming was {{conducted}} in and around Slough, Buckinghamshire and Maidenhead, Berkshire over five weeks between May and June 1960. The Slough location shooting made use of [...] the AP Films Studio itself (doubling as the gang's warehouse), a café {{on the other side}} of the road (as the main hideout), the woods of Burnham Beeches and various points along the A4 road. Halliford Studios in Shepperton, Surrey was also used briefly for filming.

Such an eruption might cause the immediate deaths of millions of people several hundred miles from the eruption, and perhaps billions of deaths worldwide, due to the failure of the monsoon, resulting in major crop failures causing starvation on a massive scale.|$|R
500|$|Neela Debnath of The Independent commented {{positively}} on the show's continuing {{exploration of}} the Daleks and the more [...] "adult tone", praising {{the performance of the}} three leads. Radio Times writer Patrick Mulkern stated that it [...] "ticks all [...] boxes as a Doctor Who fan of more than 40 years standing", describing it as [...] "clever, fast, funny, eerie, surprising and tearjerking". Nick Setchfield of SFX gave the episode five out of five stars, calling it a [...] "strong, cinematically-minded series opener" [...] which succeeded in making the Daleks scary. He also praised Coleman's debut, Smith's performance, the special effects, and Amy and Rory's emotional subplot. io9 reviewer Charlie Jane Anders noted that the plot [...] "is mostly just an excuse to explore the Doctor's ongoing relationship with the Daleks, and to show how sad it's gotten". Both Anders and Mulkern (the latter citing a Doctor Who veteran, Katy Manning) noted that Oswin's fascination with eggs, required for making soufflés, is really just a mental trick <b>to</b> <b>block</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> [...] "exterminate" [...] ("eggs-terminate") conditioning; this literary device is woven throughout the episode as a series of subtle hints, as Rory is confused by a dormant Dalek, initially misinterpreting him as saying [...] "eggs".|$|E
500|$|Filming was {{originally}} {{set to begin}} in early 1998. In the summer of 1997, Superman Lives entered pre-production, with an art department employed under production designer Rick Heinrichs. Burton hired Wesley Strick to rewrite Smith's script. Smith was disappointed, stating, [...] "The studio was happy with what I was doing. Then Tim Burton got involved, and when he signed his pay-or-play deal, {{he turned around and}} said he wanted to do his version of Superman. So who is Warner Bros. going back to? The guy who made Clerks, or the guy who made them half a billion dollars on Batman?" [...] When Strick read Smith's script, he was annoyed with the fact that [...] "Superman was accompanied/shadowed by someone/something called the Eradicator." [...] He also felt that [...] "Brainiac's evil plot of launching a disk in space <b>to</b> <b>block</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> sun and make Superman powerless was reminiscent of an episode of The Simpsons, with Mr. Burns doing the Brainiac role." [...] However, after reading The Death and Return of Superman, Strick was able to understand some of the elements of Smith's script. Strick's rewrite featured Superman as an existentialist, thinking of himself to be an outsider on Earth. Superman is threatened by Brainiac and Lex Luthor, who later amalgamate into [...] "Lexiac," [...] described by Strick as [...] "a schizo/scary mega-villain." [...] Superman is later resurrected by the power of 'K,' a natural force representing the spirit of Krypton, as he defeats Lexiac.|$|E
500|$|Manners {{noted that}} [...] "Closure" [...] {{was one of}} the first episodes in which the {{production}} staff was able to [...] "shoot in Los Angeles with the sun out". According to Manners, the show was struggling with the fact that [...] "we weren't in Vancouver anymore and that our show had suddenly become very bright and cheery". To amend this, Bill Roe, director of photography, used tree branches and c-stands <b>to</b> <b>block</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> sunlight. [...] The first scene with the walk-ins rising up from their grave, shot at Griffith Park above the playground, was [...] "tricky," [...] according to director Kim Manners. Manners felt uncomfortable telling the children to rise out of [...] "graves", feeling it could psychologically hurt them, so instead the crew called the holes in the ground [...] "forts." [...] The scenes taking place at April Air Force Base was shot in San Bernardino, California at a closed airfield, the former Norton Air Force Base. On the airbase was a large abandoned house complex of over 400 buildings constructed and used by the United States military. [...] According to Manners, the entire area was [...] "eerie", and many of the houses still had furniture in them. Originally, the producers wanted to name the fictitious air force March Air Force Base. However, the presence of an actual air force base with the same name necessitated a change to April Air Force Base. One of the shots in the April Air Force Base was filmed at a sound stage in Los Angeles. The scene at the restaurant was shot in a location on Sepulveda Boulevard, at a hotel that had been standing there for 30 to 40 years.|$|E

As of January 2013, {{it had an}} 87% {{approval}} from 67 reviews listed at Rotten Tomatoes, with an average rating of 7.6/10. The consensus states: [...] "A tragic, hard-hitting story about a teenager trapped in a life of prostitution." [...] Metacritic gives a score of 82 out of 100, based on 26 critics, indicating [...] "universal acclaim". It was rated with four stars out of five possible in the British film magazine Empire, where reviewer Michael Hayden praised the performance by Oksana Akinshina while comparing the film to both the social realism of Ken Loach and [...] "the darkest of fairy tales, complete with wicked aunts and guardian angels." [...] Manohla Dargis of the Los Angeles Times noted {{that the image of}} the girl lured into prostitution might be a cliché, but held the director's honest intention as an acceptable excuse: [...] "Moodysson wants us to see that there's a real person under the platitudes". She also noted that while the story might be unpleasant to take part of, the discomfort is surpassed by the sheer quality of the film: [...] "This isn't an easy film -- only a memorable one." [...] A negative review came from Sight & Sounds Tony Rayns. Rayns dismissed the film as melodramatic and lacking in substance, while also criticizing the stylistic choice of the dream sequences, as well as the soundtrack's composition: [...] "The most extreme case is [...] use of Rammstein's 'Mein Herz brennt', played at woofer-challenging volume over the opening and closing scenes. ... Even if we take the volume {{as a metaphor for the}} girl's wish <b>to</b> <b>block</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> world, it's absurd to imagine that Lilja would ever relate to or even listen to a Rammstein track in German.

60|$|My {{reflector}} in {{my present}} instrument is, I {{am a little}} ashamed to confess, nothing better than a piece of looking-glass fixed to an axle within the camera, near its top left-hand edge. One end of the axle protrudes, and has a short arm; when I push the arm back, the mirror is raised; when I push it forward it drops down. I used a swing-glass because the swing action is very true, and as my apparatus was merely a provisional working model made of soft wood, I {{did not like to}} use sliding arrangements which might not have acted truly, or I should certainly have employed a slide with a rectangular glass prism, on account of the perfect reflection it affords. And let me say, that a prism of 2 inches square in the side is quite large enough for adjustment purposes, for it is only the face of the portrait that is wanted to be seen. I chose my looking-glass carefully, and selected a piece that was plane and parallel. It has not too high a polish, and therefore does not give troublesome double reflections. In fact, it answers very respectably, especially when we consider that perfection of definition is thrown away on composites. I thought of a mirror silvered {{on the front of the}} glass, but this would soon tarnish in the gaslight, so I did not try it. For safety against the admission of light unintentionally, I have a cap to the focusing-screen in the roof, and a slide in the fixed body of the instrument immediately behind the reflector and before the dark slide. Neither of these would be wanted if the reflector was replaced by a prism, set into one end of a sliding block that had a large horizontal hole at the other end, and a sufficient length of solid wood between the two <b>to</b> <b>block</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> passage of light both upwards and downwards whenever the block is passing through the half-way position.|$|E
