25|$|Traditionally rods {{are made}} from bamboo, while {{contemporary}} rods are usually made from fibreglass or carbon fibre. In contrast with nets, which are usually used in subsistence and commercial fishing, fishing rods are more often used in recreational fishing and competitive casting. Fishing rods come in many sizes, actions, lengths and configurations depending on whether {{they are to be}} used for small, medium or large fish or in different fresh or salt water situations. Various <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>fishing</b> rods are designed for specific <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>fishing.</b> Fly rods are used to cast artificial flies, spinning rods and bait casting rods are designed to cast baits or lures. Ice fishing rods are designed to fish through small holes in ice covered lakes. Trolling rods are designed to drag bait or lures behind moving boats.|$|E

25|$|The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has {{listed the}} Antilles {{catshark}} under Data Deficient, {{as there is}} little known of deepwater fishery activities within its range.

25|$|Unlike other casting methods, {{fly fishing}} {{can be thought}} of as a method of casting line rather than lure. Non-flyfishing methods rely on a lure's weight to pull line from the reel during the forward motion of a cast. By design, a fly is too light to be cast, and thus simply follows the unfurling of a {{properly}} cast fly line, which is heavier and tapered and therefore more castable than lines used in other <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>fishing.</b>|$|E
40|$|Productivity and {{marketing}} channel are {{factors that can}} influence fishermen income. The objective {{of the study is}} to examine factors that will affect the fishermen income in Tuba Island, Langkawi. Incomes of fishermen are determined by <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>fishing</b> gears, boat size, demographic factors, <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>fish</b> that the fishermen catch, and the way the fishermen market their fish. Questionnaire was distributed to 201 fishermen households in Tuba Island, an island which is undergoing rapid development. The results indicated that landing areas, <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>fishing</b> gears and <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>fish</b> has significant effect to the fishermen income. It also showed that government support activities, such as the landing jetty have an impact on marketing <b>of</b> <b>fish</b> caught by these fishermen. The finding suggests that improving the marketing channel and improving the fishery resources should be emphasized by policy makers...|$|R

25|$|Research vessels – a {{fisheries}} research vessel (FRV) requires platforms which {{are capable of}} towing different <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>fishing</b> nets, collecting plankton or water samples {{from a range of}} depths, and carrying acoustic fish-finding equipment. Fisheries research vessels are often designed and built along the same lines as a large fishing vessel, but with space given over to laboratories and equipment storage, as opposed to storage of the catch. An example of a {{fisheries research}} vessel is FRV Scotia.|$|E
25|$|Although {{fishing vessel}} {{designed}} increasingly began to converge around the world, local conditions still often led {{the development of}} different <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>fishing</b> boats. The Lancashire nobby was used down the north west coast of England as a shrimp trawler from 1840 until World War II. The Manx nobby was used around the Isle of Man as a herring drifter. The fifie was also used as a herring drifter along {{the east coast of}} Scotland from the 1850s until well into the 20th century.|$|E
25|$|In the Dutch fishery, a {{last was}} a {{measurement}} of the fish loaded into the various <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>fishing</b> boat in use (e.g. a bomschuit, buis, sloep or logger). The last of these could take 35 to 40 last of fish, the exact amount depending on the location. In the South Holland fishing villages of Scheveningen and Katwijk, it amounted to 17 crans (kantjes) of herring; in Vlaardingen 14 packed tons. A cran (kantje) held about 900 to 1,000 herring. In Flanders a last was about 1,000kg of herring. The term fell out of use when the herring fishery disappeared.|$|E

The Lancashire nobby was used down the north west coast of England as a shrimp trawler from 1840 until World War II. The bawley and the smack were used in the Thames Estuary and off East Anglia, while trawlers and drifters were use on the east coast. Herring fishing started in the Moray Firth in 1819. The Manx nobby was used as a herring drifter around the Isle of Man, and fifies were used as herring drifters along the east coast of Scotland from the 1850s until well into the 20th century.|$|E
25|$|Harmless and of no {{commercial}} value, the roughtail catshark is {{too small}} to be caught on most <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>fishing</b> gear but is taken incidentally in shrimp trawls. Shark expert Stewart Springer reported in 1966 that it was frequently caught in shrimp trawls along the entire coast of Florida. The impact of trawl fisheries on this species in United States waters is unknown; its depth and spawning habitat preferences may offer a degree of protection from fishing pressure. Similarly, shrimp trawling activity off Central America does not extend into the depths occupied by this species. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has therefore assessed the roughtail catshark as of Least Concern.|$|E
25|$|Artisan {{fishing boats}} are usually small {{traditional}} fishing boats, appropriately {{designed for use}} on their local inland waters or coasts. Many localities {{around the world have}} developed their own traditional <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>fishing</b> boats, adapted to use local materials suitable for boat building and to the specific requirements of the fisheries and sea conditions in their area. Artisan boats are often open (undecked). Many have sails, but they do not usually use much, or any mechanised or electronic gear. Large numbers of artisan fishing boats are still in use, particularly in developing countries with long productive marine coastlines. For example, Indonesia has reported about 700,000 fishing boats, 25 percent of which are dugout canoes, and half of which are without motors. The Philippines have reported a similar number of small fishing boats. Many of the boats in this area are double-outrigger craft, consisting of a narrow main hull with two attached outriggers, commonly known as jukung in Indonesia and banca in the Philippines.|$|E

500|$|The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has {{assessed}} the leopard shark as of Least Concern. It is highly susceptible to local depletion {{due to its}} slow growth rate and low level of exchange between regional stocks. It was considered for, but is not managed under, the U.S. Pacific Fishery Management Council's (PMC) 1982 Groundfish Management Plan. In 1992, the State of California imposed a recreational minimum size limit of [...] and a possession limit of three fish, a move that was strongly supported and promoted by the sport fishing community. In 1993, the State also instituted a minimum size limit of [...] for the commercial harvesting of all sharks and rays, including for the aquarium trade. In addition, Californian restrictions {{on the use of}} certain <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>fishing</b> gear in near-shore waters confer good protection to this shark's core population. These management measures seem to have successfully reduced fishing mortality and halted the population decline from the 1980s; the status of the leopard shark off California is regarded as secure, with demographic models estimating an annual population increase of 3ndash&6% with sustainable fishing.|$|E
2500|$|According to {{an article}} in AAAS & Science, over 8 million sea turtles have died {{over the past twenty}} years due to {{injuries}} caused by being accidentally caught by fishing boats. Fisheries often use large-scale nets and hook systems that are indiscriminate and catch whatever comes along, be it sea turtle, dolphin, or even shark. [...] What is known as “bycatch” is a large contributor to sea turtle deaths, as seen in Baja California. Longline, trawl, and gillnet fishing are three <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>fishing</b> with the most sea turtle accidents. [...] Deaths occur often because of drowning, where the sea turtle was ensnared and could not come up for air. Another dangerous aspect of fishing that is common is when sea turtles inadvertently swallow sharp hooks, which can get stuck within the soft tissue of the throat and stomach, or damage vital organs and intestines.|$|E
2500|$|Also {{known as}} [...] "power value" [...] or [...] "rod weight". Rods may be {{classified}} as ultra-light, light, medium-light, medium, medium-heavy, heavy, ultra-heavy, or other similar combinations. Power is often an indicator of what <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>fishing,</b> species of fish, or size of fish a particular pole may be best used for. Ultra-light rods are suitable for catching small bait fish and also panfish, or situations where rod responsiveness is critical. Ultra-Heavy rods are used in deep sea fishing, surf fishing, or for heavy fish by weight. While manufacturers use various designations for a rod's power, there is no fixed standard, hence application of a particular power tag by a manufacturer is somewhat subjective. Any fish can theoretically be caught with any rod, of course, but catching panfish on a heavy rod offers no sport whatsoever, and successfully landing a large fish on an ultralight rod requires supreme rod handling skills at best, and more frequently ends in broken tackle and a lost fish. Rods are best suited {{to the type of}} fishing they are intended for.|$|E

2500|$|The finds at Ayub Cave in South Cotabato again {{verified}} {{the great}} pottery {{tradition of the}} Philippines. In terms of quantity and quality, these artifacts have no match in Southeast Asia for such an early time period. One interesting {{question is whether or}} not the Philippines ever developed an export industry for pottery. Generally it is known that the Thais had developed quite a flourishing industry, which is sometimes considered unique in SE Asia. However, it is well documented that the Philippines was in fact a major destination of pottery buyers from the islands of Japan at least. Japanese texts mention trading expeditions to the island of Rusun (Luzon) going well back before the Spanish period. What they sought were the highly prized Rusun and Namban jars. In fact, these jars were far more precious than gold to the Japanese because of their ability to act as tea canisters. Japanese texts were very specific about these jars being made in Luzon. The Tokiko, for example, calls the Rusun and Namban jars, Ru-sun tsukuru or Lu-sung ch'i (Chinese), which means simply [...] "made in Luzon." [...] In the Tokiko it mentions that all Rusun jars had this marking known as the rokuru (wheel mark). Those familiar with Philippine ethnography will know that this spiral is commonly used by many of the Philippine tribes. The following symbols were used to identify which kiln was used to make the jar: identified [...] "Imbe" [...] jars, meant jars coming from Bizen kiln, and mark three times meant a canister from the same oven. A jar with this mark is said to be made of Namban clay. This marking corresponds to the syllable la in Pampanga; Tagbanua for ka ("Chinese Pottery," [...] Field Museum of Natural History-Anth., vol.xii, Jul.1912) Of course, the symbol for la can also be the same as that for lu, and so this might correspond to the symbol said to stand for Lu in Rusun-no kokuji (Luzon national writing). According to the Tokiko, certain types of Rusun jars were distinguished by this character. De Morga mentions that Japanese traders were still coming in large numbers for these jars during his time, and that they were willing to spend great sums for them. Apparently work on these jars continued in the North, possibly among the unconquered Igorots, for De Morga had no knowledge of such current production. Later, the knowledge may have again trickled down to Vigan, where a flourishing industry of Burnay jar manufacture survives to this day. Although the Japanese described very high quality jars coming from the Philippines, not all were of elegant nature. In fact, De Morga had some disdain for some of the jars that the Japanese were buying, so they could have been similar to the well-known balanga and other jars in use today. These jars are generally handed down as heirlooms and are noted for their qualities in enhancing the fermentation process. Possibly one of the Japanese uses for the Rusun jars was fermentation of products like Kombucha and Umeboshi plums. Indeed, a Japanese acquaintance stated that their family in rural Japan used old Rusun jars for exactly this purpose up to this day. The Filipinos were skilled in all <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>fishing</b> and fisheries. In the south, the basnig, a Viking-like ship, was and is the vessel of choice among the Bisayans for ocean fishing. The salambao is a type of raft that utilizes a large fishing net which is lowered into the water via a type of lever made of two criss-crossed poles. Night fishing was accomplished with the help of candles similar to the copal of Mexico. These candles were made from a particular type of resin. Fish corrals, like the ones still used today, were also employed by the ancient Filipino. However, the area in which the Filipino most astonished Westerners was in their advanced aquaculture: ...|$|E
