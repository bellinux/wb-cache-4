500|$|The golden ratio (roughly {{equal to}} 1.618) {{was known to}} Euclid. The golden ratio has {{persistently}} been claimed in modern times to {{have been used in}} art and architecture by the ancients in Egypt, Greece and elsewhere, without reliable evidence. The claim may derive from confusion with [...] "golden mean", which to the Ancient Greeks meant [...] "avoidance of excess in either direction", not a ratio. Pyramidologists since the nineteenth century have argued on dubious mathematical grounds for the golden ratio in pyramid design. The Parthenon, a 5th-century BC temple [...] in Athens, has been claimed to use the golden ratio in its façade and floor plan, but these claims too are disproved by measurement. The Great Mosque of Kairouan in Tunisia has similarly been claimed to use the golden ratio in its design, but the ratio does not appear in the original parts of the mosque. The historian of architecture Frederik Macody Lund argued in 1919 that the Cathedral of Chartres (12th century), Notre-Dame of Laon (1157–1205) and Notre Dame de Paris (1160) are designed according to the golden ratio, drawing regulator lines <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>his</b> <b>case.</b> Other scholars argue that until Pacioli's work in 1509, the golden ratio was unknown to artists and architects. For example, the height and width of the front of Notre-Dame of Laon have the ratio 8/5 or 1.6, not 1.618. Such Fibonacci ratios quickly become hard to distinguish from the golden ratio. After Pacioli, the golden ratio is more definitely discernible in artworks including Leonardo's Mona Lisa.|$|E

5000|$|Two {{conflicting}} perspectives {{exist for}} {{the early history of}} Seattle. There is the [...] "establishment" [...] view, which favors the centrality of the Denny Party (generally the Denny, Mercer, Terry, and Boren families), and Henry Yesler. A second, less didactic view, advanced particularly by historian Bill Speidel and others such as Murray Morgan, sees David Swinson [...] "Doc" [...] Maynard as a key figure, perhaps the key figure. In the late nineteenth century, when Seattle had become a thriving town, several members of the Denny Party still survived; they and many of their descendants were in local positions of power and influence. Maynard was about ten years older and died relatively young, so he was not around <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>his</b> own <b>case.</b> The Denny Party were generally conservative Methodists, teetotalers, Whigs and Republicans, while Maynard was a drinker and a Democrat. He felt that well-run prostitution could be a healthy part of a city's economy. He was also on friendly terms with the region's Native Americans, while many of the Denny Party were not. Thus Maynard was not on the best of terms with what became the Seattle Establishment, especially after the Puget Sound War.

60|$|For {{this reason}} the talker favored {{the reading of}} criticism, {{especially}} the kind of criticism that quoted. He would even {{go so far as}} to say that there was no just and honest criticism without quotation. The critic was bound <b>to</b> <b>make</b> out <b>his</b> <b>case,</b> or else abdicate his function, and he could not <b>make</b> out <b>his</b> <b>case,</b> either for or against an author, without calling him to testify. Therefore, he was in favor of quotational criticism, for fairness' sake, as well as for his pleasure; and it was for the extension of it that he now contended. He was not sure that he wished to send the reader to the authors quoted in all cases. The reader could get through the passages cited a pretty good notion of the authors' quality, and as for their quantity, that was often made up of commonplaces or worse. In the case of the old poets, and most of the English classics, there was a great deal of filth which the reader would be better for not taking into his mind and which the most copiously quotational critics would hardly offer him. If any one said that without the filth one could not get a fair idea of those authors, he should be disposed to distinguish, and to say that without the filth one could not get a fair idea of their age, but of themselves, yes. Their beauty and their greatness were personal to them; even their dulness might be so; but their foulness was what had come off on them from living at periods when manners were foul.|$|R

The Speaker wishes {{to be seen as}} dutiful and devout by the Friend. To do so, the Third Quatrain employs language that evokes thoughts of a religious servant who makes sacrifice. According to Greene, [...] "In this secularized sacrament, the dutiful poet freely makes an offering intended to manifest the inwardness and simplicity of his own devotion, knowing, or thinking that he knows, that his oblation will win him the unmediated, inner reciprocity which is his goal". Greene adds that the [...] "unformulated implication of the work as a whole seems to be that expense is never truly recuperated". Though the Speaker is seeking a relationship of reciprocity through means not employed by the other suitors, he still uses the art of poetry <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>his</b> <b>case</b> for the affection of the Friend. Greene sees this as the wedge between the Speaker and the object of his affection. He says, [...] "Language is condemned to be compound; poetry is art; it shapes and forms and distorts; it introduces inequalities, like the inequality between an offering and an exchange, or the inequality between a secular offering and the sacramental body of Christ".

There has been an attempt made to persuade the neighbourhood, quite lately, that the name is irreligious and unworthy of an enlightened people, like this of West Chester; but it has met with no great success.

He has got half-a-dozen of the more sentimental part of our society to call the neck Dibbleton; but the attempt is not likely to succeed in the long run, as we are not a people much given to altering the language, any more than the customs of our ancestors.

The Saturday Review commented, [...] "the court has evaded the real point with a slipperiness (for we cannot say dexterity) not wholly worthy of the candour we expect from officers and gentlemen." [...] Captain Gerald Noel of Nile, who had given evidence critical of Camperdowns actions, wrote to Markham observing that things might have turned out better had he been on any ship other than Camperdown, and that in his opinion Captain Johnstone was incompetent. Charles Beresford and Admiral of the Fleet Sir Geoffrey Phipps Hornby published a joint letter in the United Service Gazette that: [...] "Admiral Markham might have refused to perform the evolution ordered, and the Victoria might have been saved. Admiral Markham, however, would have been tried by court-martial, and no one would have sympathised with him as it would not have been realized that he had averted a catastrophe. Unconditional obedience is, in brief, the only principle on which those in service must act."

40|$|Between May and December 2011, a wave {{of student}} protests {{occurred}} in the Chilean capital of Santiago and other major cities throughout the country. The protests were a response to government proposals to allow further privatisation of the higher education sector, {{in the context of}} a country whose education system has been judged by UNESCO to promote inequality and division along class lines (UNESCO/Muñoz 2011). In response to the occupation of schools and huge public marches organised by university students, Sebastian Piñera – Chile’s first right-wing President since the Pinochet era – announced the ‘Gran Acuerdo Nacional de la Educación’ (Grand National Agreement on Education). Following more demonstrations in July, the Gran Acuerdo was amended and announced again in August, and a third version was unveiled at the end of August. Drawing on the critical discourse analytical frameworks offered by Fairclough (2001) and Wodak (1999, 2009), this paper considers the argumentation strategies employed by President Piñera in these successive high-profile policy proposals announced in relatively quick succession throughout July and August. It considers how the students’ position and actions are framed in relation to the position of the government, and how the students’ perceived cause is discursively constructed by Piñera in order <b>to</b> then <b>make</b> <b>his</b> own <b>case.</b> The study also draws on Aristotle’s three-part model of the means of persuasion (through personality and stance, arousal of emotion, and reasoning.

I look not only at the elite voices and institutional discourse (Thornborrow 2002) of the government and Presidency, but also critically analyse the ‘grassroots’ voices emerging from students and other participants in the protests, asking whether similar discursive strategies are apparent in their discourse, or whether these voices and discourses are constructed in different wa...|$|R
