50|$|There are {{two basic}} ways to {{calculate}} water and wastewater <b>tariff</b> <b>levels</b> {{for the purpose of}} comparing <b>tariff</b> <b>levels</b> between cities: One way is to calculate an average tariff for the utility. This is done by dividing total tariff revenues by the total consumption billed across all usage categories and all levels of consumption. Another way is to determine a typical level of consumption and calculate the residential tariff that corresponds to this consumption. Depending on which of these two methods is used the resulting tariff can vary significantly for the same utility.|$|R

The average household water and sewage bill in England and Wales was £330 in 2008-09. According to a 2006 survey by NUS Consulting Group the average water tariff (price) without sewerage in the U.K. for large consumers was the equivalent of US$1.90 per cubic metre. This was the third-highest tariff among the 14 mostly OECD countries covered by the report. A study commissioned by the German industry association BGW in 2006, compared the average household water {{and sanitation}} bill (as opposed to the tariff per cubic metre that the NUS study used as a comparator) in four EU countries. This study showed that water bills in England and Wales were the highest among the four countries. Average water bills (excluding sanitation) were 295 euro per year in England and Wales, higher than in Germany, France (85 euro) or Italy (59 euro).|$|E

Marginal tariff reductions increase (decrease) the desirability of merger at sufficiently low (high) <b>tariff</b> <b>levels.</b> In the neighborhood of free trade, for sufficiently low cost savings from merger, trade liberalization increases the desirability of merger whilst decreasing the profitability, implying that mergers should be actively encouraged by competition authorities.

25|$|<b>Tariff</b> <b>levels</b> are set at {{the local}} level, but need to be {{approved}} by the national-level regulatory agency EWURA.

Tariffs are generally low and have not been revised in the last years. In Dar es Salaam the average water tariff in 2008 was TZ599 or US$0.46 per m3. Lindi had the highest average water tariff: TZS833 or US$0.64 per m3. The average urban water tariff was TZS437,4 equivalent to US$0.34 per m3.|$|R

50|$|A TRQ {{combines}} two {{policy instruments}} that nations historically {{have used to}} restrict imports: quotas and tariffs. In a TRQ, the quota component works together with a specified <b>tariff</b> <b>level</b> to provide the desired degree of import protection. Essentially, a TRQ is a two-tiered tariff. The first Q imports entering within the quota portion of a TRQ are usually subject to a lower, tariff rate called the Inside tariff quota rate or ITQR. Imports above the quota's quantitative threshold (Q) face a much higher (usually prohibitive) Outside tariff quota rate or OTQR. The Q units are called the quota volume, and this volume serves as the cut off between the ITQR and the OTQR.|$|E
50|$|Post-World-War-II {{changes to}} the Smoot-Hawley tariffs {{reflected}} a general tendency of the United States to reduce its tariff levels unilaterally while its trading partners retained their high levels. The American Tariff League Study of 1951 compared the free and dutiable tariff rates of 43 countries. It found that only seven nations had a lower <b>tariff</b> <b>level</b> than the US (5.1%), while eleven nations had free and dutiable tariff rates higher than the Smoot-Hawley peak of 19.8% including the United Kingdom (25.6%). The 43-country average was 14.4% which was 0.9% higher than the US level of 1929 demonstrating that few nations were reciprocating in reducing their levels as the U.S. reduced its own.|$|E

50|$|<b>Tariff</b> <b>level.</b> Water and {{sanitation}} tariffs in many Brazilian cities are relatively high {{compared to other}} Latin American cities. According to the urban water {{and sanitation}} information system SNIS the average water tariff of utilities participating in the system (which provide water services to 95% of the urban population) {{was the equivalent of}} US$0.68/m3 and the average sanitation tariff was US$0.67/m3, for a total of US$$1.35/m3 for those connected to the sewer network. This compares to US$0.81/m3 in Chilean cities, US$0.79/m3 in Argentine cities and US$0.51/m3 in Peruvian cities. The ratio of sanitation to water tariffs of almost 1:1 is very high for Latin America and close to the ratio of the actual cost of the two services, while in most other Latin American countries sewer tariffs remain much lower than water tariffs.|$|E
