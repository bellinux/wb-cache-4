40|$|Background: thermotactile <b>thresholds</b> and vibrotactile <b>thresholds</b> are {{measured}} {{to assist the}} diagnosis of the sensorineural component of the hand-arm vibration syndrome (HAVS). Objectives: this study investigates whether thermotactile and vibrotactile <b>thresholds</b> distinguish between fingers with and without numbness and tingling. Methods: in 60 males reporting symptoms of the hand-arm vibration syndrome, thermotactile <b>thresholds</b> for detecting hot and cold temperatures and vibrotactile <b>thresholds</b> at 31. 5 and 125 Hz were measured on the index and little fingers of both hands. Results: in fingers reported to suffer numbness or tingling, hot <b>thresholds</b> increased, cold <b>thresholds</b> decreased, and vibrotactile <b>thresholds</b> at both 31. 5 and 125 Hz increased. With sensorineural symptoms on all three phalanges (i. e. numbness or tingling scores of 6), both thermotactile <b>thresholds</b> and both vibrotactile <b>thresholds</b> had sensitivities greater than 80 % and specificities around 90 %, with areas under the receiver operating characteristic curves around 0. 9. There were correlations between all four <b>thresholds,</b> but cold <b>thresholds</b> had greater sensitivity and greater specificity on fingers with numbness or tingling on only the distal phalanx (i. e. numbness or tingling scores of 1) suggesting cold <b>thresholds</b> provide better indications of early sensorineural disorder. Conclusions: thermotactile <b>thresholds</b> and vibrotactile <b>thresholds</b> can provide useful indications of sensorineural function in patients reporting symptoms of the sensorineural component of HAVS. </p...|$|R

First continuity and higher derivative of <b>thresholding</b> function {{can be obtained by}} setting adjustment factors, second the difference between the value of the original signal and the one quantized is unlimitedly decreased, finally, according to the noisy signal features and the distributional difference of noise energy, the effective <b>thresholding</b> function can be obtained with different adjustment factors. Objective assessment parameters of de-noising image quality are calculated from the experiment of Matlab simulation, which suggests that the impact of de-noising algorithm with the new <b>thresholding</b> function is better than the traditional soft and hard <b>thresholding</b> de-noising algorithms, furthermore, which lays a good foundation on image enhancement, feature extraction and edge detection.
