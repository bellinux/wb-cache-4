5|$|A 136-page art {{book titled}} Last Exile Aerial Log was {{published}} in February 2005 but has since been discontinued. It {{was published in}} Japanese and was never translated for English-language release. The book contains detailed character sketches and descriptions as well as <b>technical</b> <b>manuals</b> for aircraft {{that appeared in the}} series. It also includes exclusive interviews with members of the production staff.|$|E
5|$|Many readers {{praised the}} series for its {{attention}} to detail and realism {{in the area of}} military tactics and procedures. Much of this was due to Hama's military experience (he was drafted into the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers during the Vietnam war), but he also did a large amount of research in order to be as up-to-date as possible. He frequented Sky Books, a military-oriented bookstore in New York, and read many U.S. Army field manuals and <b>technical</b> <b>manuals,</b> and also credits his friend Lee Russel, a military historian, for helping him with research.|$|E
5|$|Sea {{trials for}} Petropavlovsk were {{scheduled}} to begin sometime in late 1941, {{and according to the}} training program, the Soviet crew would not begin training until a month before the trials. It was decided that Soviet officers would train at German naval schools in the Fall of 1941, and that five officers would train aboard Seydlitz when the ship was commissioned for trials. German instructors would also be sent to Leningrad to train engine-room personnel. At the time of the commissioning of Petropavlovsk, the relevant German training and <b>technical</b> <b>manuals</b> would be sent to the Soviet Navy, albeit in German only.|$|E

5|$|The museum's {{library is}} a {{national}} reference collection on modern conflict, and holds works on all aspects of warfare, including regimental or unit histories (such as 789 rare German unit histories from the First World War), <b>technical</b> <b>manuals,</b> biographical material and works on war's social, cultural, economic, political and military aspects. The library also holds printed ephemera such as the Imperial War Museum Stamp Collection, leaflets and ration books, printed proclamations, newspapers, trench magazines (such the Wipers Times) and trench maps. In 2012 the museum reported its library collection to contain over 80,000 items of historic importance (such as maps, proclamations and rare books) and a further 254,000 items of reference material.|$|E
5|$|Galland, who {{was born}} in Westerholt, Westphalia became a glider pilot in 1929 before he joined Lufthansa. In 1932, he {{graduated}} as a pilot at the Deutsche Verkehrsfliegerschule (German Commercial Flyers' School) in Braunschweig before applying to join the Reichswehr of the Weimar Republic later in the year. Galland's application was accepted, but he never took up the offer. In February 1934, he was transferred to the Luftwaffe. In 1937, during the Spanish Civil War, he volunteered for the Condor Legion and flew ground attack missions in support of the Nationalists under Francisco Franco. After finishing his tour in 1938 Galland was employed in the Air Ministry writing doctrinal and <b>technical</b> <b>manuals</b> about his experiences as a ground-attack pilot. During this period Galland served as an instructor for ground-attack units. During the German invasion of Poland in September 1939, he again flew ground attack missions. In early 1940 Galland managed to persuade his superiors to allow him to become a fighter pilot.|$|E
5|$|Rio de Janeiro was {{primarily}} evaluated during the Applicant phase, accurately on March 14, 2008, when the IOC Working Group released its report {{after four days}} of meetings, giving a weighted-average score of 6.4 to the bid. It {{was based on a}} thorough technical analysis of the projects presented on the Application File, which was developed by the Rio de Janeiro bid committee after having access to the Olympic Games Knowledge Management database as well as the official IOC <b>Technical</b> <b>Manuals.</b> The Working Group composed of several experts assessed the city's potential for staging successful Olympic Games according to eleven criteria presented in the Application File. Rio de Janeiro's highest score came from Government support, legal issues and public opinion due to the strong government commitment, and its lowest from Safety and security due to the city's chronic problems of violence. Experience in major events also yielded good scores, while a shortage in the number of required hotel rooms undermined the accommodation theme. The Working Group also gave an 8.3 score to Tokyo, 8.1 to Madrid, 7.0 to Chicago, 6.9 to Doha, 5.3 to Prague and 4.3 to Baku; being the basis for the selection to the Candidature phase. On September 18, 2008, after the shortlist which concluded the Application phase, the IOC announced the composition of its Evaluation Commission. The commission inspected the four Candidate cities under the leadership of Nawal El Moutawakel, who also chaired the Evaluation Commission for the bid process of the 2012 Summer Olympics and Paralympics.|$|E

25|$|The museum's library {{contains}} an extensive collection of rare {{items such as}} aircraft manufacturer company newsletters/magazines, <b>technical</b> <b>manuals</b> for both military and civilian aircraft, industry magazines dating back to World War II and before, historic photographs and other invaluable references on aircraft operation and manufacturing.|$|E
25|$|In {{most cases}} <b>technical</b> <b>manuals</b> were not available, so {{everything}} was worked {{out on a}} trial and error basis. The {{state of the art}} was quite common among all airplane manufacturers of that time. In most cases, Japanese flight instruments were replaced by US instruments for those aircraft intended for flight, but engine instruments were retained as they were calibrated for the function they served. US radio equipment and a new oxygen system also replaced Japanese types.|$|E
25|$|The F–K formula {{was first}} used by the Army for {{assessing}} the difficulty of <b>technical</b> <b>manuals</b> in 1978 and soon after became a United States Military Standard. Pennsylvania was the first U.S. state to require that automobile insurance policies be written at no higher than a ninth-grade level (14–15 years of age) of reading difficulty, {{as measured by the}} F–K formula. This is now a common requirement in many other states and for other legal documents such as insurance policies.|$|E

The written descriptions are diagrammed for the reader to better understand various football tactics and skills as they are applied in the real world, at the highest levels.|$|E
25|$|Doctor Atomic (2005): An {{opera in}} two acts, about Robert Oppenheimer, the Manhattan Project, and the {{creation}} and testing of the first atomic bomb. The libretto of Doctor Atomic by Peter Sellars draws on original source material, including personal memoirs, recorded interviews, <b>technical</b> <b>manuals</b> of nuclear physics, declassified government documents, and the poetry of the Bhagavad Gita, John Donne, Charles Baudelaire, and Muriel Rukeyser. The opera takes place in June and July 1945, mainly {{over the last few}} hours before the first atomic bomb explodes at the test site in New Mexico. Characters include Dr. J. Robert Oppenheimer and his wife Kitty, Edward Teller, General Leslie Groves, and Robert Wilson.|$|E
500|$|Owners of {{mainframe}} {{systems and}} minicomputers could purchase additional memory, interface boards and peripherals from third party suppliers; {{so it was}} predictable that owners of the Altair 8800 computer would do the same. MITS's delays in delivery of systems and accessories accelerated the formation of Altair compatible suppliers. The first ones started appearing in mid-1975 and by July 1976 complete computers systems were readily available. The <b>technical</b> <b>manuals</b> for the Altair 8800 provided electrical schematics of the 100 pin computer bus allowing others to design compatible boards. There was not a proper technical standard {{at the time and}} some [...] "compatible" [...] boards did not work with other [...] "compatible" [...] boards. Later, the industry developed the S-100 bus standard.|$|E

500|$|When Khan's sleep chamber malfunctions, he is {{transported to}} Enterprise, where he reawakens and learns {{he is in}} the 23rd century. Given spacious {{quarters}} while Botany Bay is towed to a starbase, Khan fascinates and charms the ship's historian, Marla McGivers (Madlyn Rhue), while using his access to the ship's <b>technical</b> <b>manuals</b> to learn how to take over and operate Enterprise. McGivers agrees to help Khan revive the other supermen, allowing him to organize an attempted takeover. To coerce the Enterprise crew to cooperate with him, Khan places Captain James T. Kirk (William Shatner) in the ship's decompression chamber and threatens to kill Kirk unless the crew submits. McGivers cannot stand by as her Captain dies and frees Kirk, who neutralizes Khan's men by using a neural gas. Khan heads to engineering and sets the ship's engines to self-destruct, whereupon he is incapacitated by Kirk. Captain Kirk conducts a hearing, sentencing Khan and his followers to exile on an uncolonized world, Ceti Alpha V. Khan accepts Kirk's challenge—invoking the fall of Lucifer in Milton's Paradise Lost—and McGivers joins Khan rather than face court-martial. Spock (Leonard Nimoy) wonders what the [...] "seed" [...] Kirk has planted will bear in a hundred years.|$|E
