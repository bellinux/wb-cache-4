5|$|All 29 {{items of}} gold {{jewellery}} were analysed, with silver and copper found <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>present.</b> Results were typical for Roman silver in hoards of the period, {{in terms of}} the presence of copper alloyed with the silver to harden it, and trace elements.

5|$|Although the Egyptians {{believed}} their gods <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>present</b> {{in the world}} around them, contact between the human and divine realms was mostly limited to specific circumstances. In literature, gods may appear to humans in a physical form, but in real life the Egyptians were limited to more indirect means of communication.|$|E

5|$|During {{his time}} in Norway, Reich {{attempted}} to ground his orgasm theory in biology, exploring whether Freud's metaphor of the libido was in fact electricity or a chemical substance, an argument Freud had proposed in the 1890s but had abandoned. Reich argued that conceiving of the orgasm as nothing but mechanical tension and relaxation could not explain why some experience pleasure and others do not. He {{wanted to know what}} additional element had <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>present</b> for pleasure to be felt.|$|E
5|$|Gliese 581c {{is likely}} to lie outside the {{habitable}} zone. No direct evidence has been found for water <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>present,</b> and it is probably not present in the liquid state. Techniques like the one {{used to measure the}} extrasolar planet HD 209458 b may in the future be used to determine the presence of water in the form of vapor in the planet's atmosphere, but only in the rare case of a planet with an orbit aligned so as to transit its star, which Gliese 581c is not known to do.|$|E

5|$|Gods were assumed <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>present</b> {{throughout}} the world, capable of influencing natural {{events and the}} course of human lives. People interacted with them in temples and unofficial shrines, for personal reasons {{as well as for}} larger goals of state rites. Egyptians prayed for divine help, used rituals to compel deities to act, and called upon them for advice. Humans' relations with their gods were a fundamental part of Egyptian society.|$|E
5|$|In 2002, {{exhibitions}} and performances were also permitted {{to be held}} at Speakers' Corner.

5|$|In a book {{he wrote}} in the 1970s, Audisio argued that the {{decision}} to execute Mussolini taken at the meeting in Dongo of the partisan leaders on 28 April constituted a valid judgment of a tribunal under Article 15 of the CNLAI's ordinance on the Constitution of Courts of War. However, the lack of a judge or a Commissario di Guerra (required by the ordinance <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>present)</b> casts doubt on this assertion.|$|E

5|$|Increased dietary {{selenium}} {{reduces the}} effects of mercury toxicity, although it is effective only at low to modest doses of mercury. Evidence suggests that the molecular mechanisms of mercury toxicity includes the irreversible inhibition of selenoenzymes that are required to prevent and reverse oxidative damage in brain and endocrine tissues. An antioxidant, selenoneine, which is derived from selenium and has been found <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>present</b> {{in the blood of}} bluefin tuna, is the subject of scientific research regarding its possible roles in inflammatory and chronic diseases, methylmercury detoxification, and oxidative damages.|$|E
5|$|Montgomery {{was one of}} {{the most}} {{prominent}} Allied commanders and the German high command expected him <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>present</b> for any invasion of France.

While in London, in February 1944, Clarke, the London Controlling Section and Ops (B) drafted Copperhead in support of Vendetta.|$|E
5|$|On May 2, 1683, the Captain of the frigate HMS Falcon was sailing from England to the West Indies and beckoned {{the other}} {{officers}} <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>present</b> as he broke open his secret instructions.

A sloop in convoy, HMS Bonetta (sometimes Bonito), was designated to do most of the searching, but the Falcon would act as aid and protection. These instructions were from Sir John Narborough, a rear admiral and commissioner of the Royal Navy, who also had the ear of King Charles II.|$|E

5|$|Osteochondrosis, or {{surficial}} pits in bone {{at places}} where bones articulate, {{is also known}} in Edmontosaurus.

The underlying cause of the condition is unknown. Genetic predisposition, trauma, feeding intensity, alterations in blood supply, excess thyroid hormones, and deficiencies in various growth factors have been suggested. Among dinosaurs, osteochondrosis (like tumors) is most commonly found in hadrosaurids.|$|E

5|$|PSR B1534+11 is {{a system}} {{consisting}} of two neutron stars orbiting each other, {{one of which is}} a pulsar with a period of 37.9 milliseconds. Situated approximately 1000 parsecs distant, the system was used to test Albert Einstein's theory of general relativity, validating the system's relativistic parameters to within 0.2% of values predicted by the theory. The X-ray emission from the system has been found <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>present</b> when the non-pulsar star intersects the equatorial pulsar wind of the pulsar, and the system's orbit has been found to vary slightly.|$|E
