5|$|Arsenal went on {{to finish}} second in 1925–26, five points behind Chapman's old side Huddersfield Town, as they became the first club in England to win three titles in succession. It {{proved to be an}} early dawn for Arsenal, who spent {{most of the rest of}} the 1920s in mid-table, as Chapman <b>took</b> <b>his</b> <b>time</b> finding the right players to fit his new system, {{outlining}} a five-year plan for success. He retained relatively few players of his predecessor Knighton's era – Bob John, Alf Baker and Jimmy Brain being the exceptions – and instead looked to bring in talent from elsewhere.|$|E
5|$|Wacław Jędrzejewicz, in Piłsudski: A Life for Poland, {{describes}} Piłsudski as very deliberate in his decision-making. He collected {{all available}} pertinent information, then <b>took</b> <b>his</b> <b>time</b> weighing it before {{arriving at a}} final decision. Piłsudski drove himself hard, working all day and all night. He maintained a spartan lifestyle, eating plain meals alone at an inexpensive restaurant. Though Piłsudski was popular {{with much of the}} Polish public, his reputation as a loner (the result of many years' underground work), as a man who distrusted almost everyone, led to strained relations with other Polish politicians.|$|E

Bell continued to bat positively and posted his 10th half century. England managed to add 80 runs for no loss, going into lunch at 99/1.|$|E

25|$|Sussex Sharks {{sealed the}} National League Division Two title by fielding first and bowling Yorkshire Phoenix out for 99. Only wicket-keeper Simon Guy passed 20, as Yorkshire fell in two periods - first to 37 for 5 thanks to three wickets from Luke Wright, and then, after Guy, Anthony McGrath and Mark Cleary {{had taken them}} to 90 for 6, they lost their last four men for nine runs. Sussex captain Chris Adams <b>took</b> <b>his</b> <b>time</b> in the reply, using 83 balls to hit 49 as Sussex' batsmen rode home to an eight-wicket victory.|$|E
25|$|The 2003 pick-ups were {{filmed in}} the Wellington studio car park, with {{many parts of}} sets and blue-screens used to finish off scenes, which the design team had to work 24 hours {{to get the right}} sets ready for a {{particular}} day. The shoot continued for two months, and became an emotional time of farewells for the cast and crew. The film has the most extensive list of re-shoots given for the trilogy.

Jackson also re-shot scenes in and around Mount Doom, and Théoden's death, right after Bernard Hill was meant to wrap.|$|E
25|$|Essex {{came back}} from a 120-run first innings deficit, after Derbyshire had used {{a day and a half}} for their first innings at The County Ground, Derby. Derbyshire struck runs at a rate of 2.75 an over, but four batsmen still made fifties, and {{especially}} Luke Sutton <b>took</b> <b>his</b> <b>time</b> at the crease. His 88 took five hours, and he faced 241 deliveries. However, Derbyshire's tactic of attrition seemed to work – after making 426, all while Danish Kaneria was bowling (the Pakistani leg spinner bowled 60.1 overs, taking six for 111), Derbyshire immediately got breakthroughs with the ball. Essex were 18 for 3 before the Flower brothers – Grant and Andy – put on 60 for the fourth wicket to help close the gap. By stumps, Essex were 113 for 4 from 50 overs.|$|E

500|$|Arsenal came {{second in}} Chapman's first season, their best finish at that time, but this {{proved to be}} a false dawn; for the next few seasons they stayed in mid-table as Chapman <b>took</b> <b>his</b> <b>time</b> to [...] {{assemble}} his side, slotting new signings such as winger Joe Hulme, forward Jack Lambert and defenders Tom Parker and Herbie Roberts into his new formation. In 1926–27, Arsenal reached their first FA Cup final, only to lose 1–0 to Cardiff City, after Arsenal's goalkeeper Dan Lewis let a harmless-looking shot slip through his arms and into the net; it was the only occasion in history that the FA Cup has been won by a club from outside England.|$|E
500|$|Early in 1931 Fender {{offered to}} resign as Surrey's captain, to give Jardine more {{experience}} of leadership before he assumed the England captaincy, but Surrey declined. Fender scored 916 runs and took 84 wickets that season. However, the Surrey committee were becoming disillusioned with Fender as captain {{after he had}} missed matches in 1930 {{to work as a}} journalist. Another point of contention was that Fender, against the wishes of the committee, preferred to keep in-form professional players in the team instead of playing amateurs when they were available. There were disagreements over [...] expenses, and the committee disapproved when Fender declared Surrey's innings closed after one ball, to make up time in a rain-affected match. A series of other controversial incidents further antagonised the committee. As a result, Fender was dismissed in January 1932, a move rumoured in the press for some time and which was quickly leaked. The club [...] released a statement which said Fender would only stand down if a suitable replacement could be found, before Jardine was officially appointed in March. It is likely that the uncertainty arose because Jardine <b>took</b> <b>his</b> <b>time</b> in accepting the position. Fender supported Jardine's appointment, and pledged to continue playing under his captaincy.|$|E
500|$|In 934 Olaf Guthfrithson succeeded {{his father}} Guthfrith as the Norse King of Dublin. The {{alliance}} between the Norse and the Scots was cemented by the marriage of Olaf to Constantine's daughter. By August 937 Olaf had defeated his rivals {{for control of the}} Viking part of Ireland, and he promptly launched a bid for the former Norse kingdom of York. Individually Olaf and Constantine were too weak to oppose Æthelstan, but together they could hope to challenge the dominance of Wessex. In the autumn they joined with the Strathclyde Britons under Owain to invade England. Medieval campaigning was normally conducted in the summer, and Æthelstan could hardly have expected an invasion on such a large scale so late in the year. He seems to have been slow to react, and an old Latin poem preserved by William of Malmesbury accused him of having [...] "languished in sluggish leisure". The allies plundered English territory while Æthelstan <b>took</b> <b>his</b> <b>time</b> gathering a West Saxon and Mercian army. However, historian Michael Wood praises his caution, arguing that unlike Harold in 1066, he did not allow himself to be provoked into precipitate action. When he marched north, the Welsh did not join him, and they did not fight on either side.|$|E

500|$|Secretariat raced in Meadow Stables' blue-and-white-checkered colors. He never raced {{in track}} bandages, but {{typically}} wore a blinker hood, mostly {{to help him}} focus, but also {{because he had a}} tendency to run in towards the rail during races. In January 1972, he joined trainer Lucien Laurin's winter stable at Hialeah. Secretariat gained a reputation as a kind horse, likeable and unruffled in crowds or by the bumping that occurs between young horses. He had the physique of a runner, but at first was awkward and clumsy. He was frequently outpaced by more precocious stable mates, running a quarter-mile in 26 seconds compared to 23 seconds by his peers. His regular exercise riders were Jim Gaffney and Charlie Davis. Davis was not initially impressed. [...] "He was a big fat sucker", Davis said. [...] "I mean, he was big. He wasn't in a hurry to do nothin'. He <b>took</b> <b>his</b> <b>time.</b> The quality was there, but he didn't show it until he wanted to." [...] Gaffney though recalled his first ride on Secretariat in early 1972 as [...] "having this big red machine under me, and from that very first day I knew he had a power of strength that I have never felt before..." ...|$|E
500|$|The Imperial {{court in}} Vienna criticized Daun for {{his failure to}} act; the Empress and her ministers worried that the Russians and the French would {{drop out of the}} {{coalition}} if there were no action. [...] Daun, a cautious and diligent commander, <b>took</b> <b>his</b> <b>time</b> to make his plans. The Strohmberg, one of the heights abutting Hochkirch, anchored Daun's left flank, and he deployed the remainder of his force southward across the road between Bautzen and Loebau. This also gave him control of an important junction between Görlitz in the east and Zittau in the south. He anchored the far right end of his line in another wooded hill south of the road, called the Kuppritzerberg. The Prussians neither increased their security nor deployed their troops in response to the Austrian presence. Daun also took into account that his men were eager to fight a battle and that they outnumbered the Prussians by more than two-to-one. His men made a great production of hewing the trees in a nearby forest, action which Frederick interpreted as efforts to create field works, not, as it was actually intended, to build a road through the thick wood. Daun also had discovered a secret weakness of Frederick's. His own personal secretary had been sending Frederick information on Daun's plans, secreted in deliveries of eggs; upon discovering this, Daun promised the man his life in return for his cooperation in continuing to send Frederick misinformation. Daun's plan, which he had kept secret, was an early morning sweep through the woods with 30,000 specially picked troops, around Frederick's flank, to enclose him. The Prussian army would be asleep, both literally and figuratively, when the Austrian army struck.|$|E

Meanwhile, the unexpected stopover and mounting uncertainty demoralized both enlisted men and career officers.

2500|$|Lloyd {{returned}} to WCW in January 2001, and Glacier was now {{played out in}} the angle as a superhero parody, with him pledging to watch Smiley's back during matches. In separate contests against Mike Awesome and Bam Bam Bigelow on Thunder, an overpowered Smiley lost decisively both times because Glacier <b>took</b> <b>his</b> <b>time</b> coming to the ring in order to interact with fans. He then entered the ring after the fact to pose for the fans before pushing Smiley out of the way to perform his old kata routine. Though Lloyd never wrestled an actual match, the gimmick was a surprisingly mild success given the previous history of the character (a fan during the Bigelow match was seen on camera holding a sign that read [...] "Glacier is My Hero"), but the angle abruptly ended and Glacier was not seen again following a skit on the February 7 edition of Thunder in which he was pummeled offscreen by Sean O'Haire inside his dressing room.|$|E
2500|$|During the War of 1812, while President Madison was urging Federalists {{to join in}} [...] "united support" [...] against Britain in a war {{they were}} given little reason to {{cooperate}} in, he gave Henry Dearborn senior command of the northeast sector which ranged from the Niagara River to the New England coast. Dearborn had favor with Madison as a Revolutionary War veteran who rose {{to the rank of}} colonel and for serving as Secretary of War under President Jefferson, and especially for helping Jefferson draft the Military Peace Establishment Act, which served to remove many Federalist officers from the ranks of the military. Subsequently, Madison's choice for commanding general of the northeast theater was not well received by most Federalists. [...] At age 61, however, Dearborn was now overweight, slow and insecure, and he found it difficult to inspire confidence among the men under his command. In March he suffered a minor injury from a fall, and it is suggested that Dearborn <b>took</b> <b>his</b> <b>time</b> recovering. When the war broke out he spent even more time in Boston, fearing, as did Vice President Elbridge Gerry, that the Federalists were once again plotting a northeastern secession and ready to install a [...] "Hanoverian"-like monarchy in opposition to them.|$|E
2500|$|Michigan won the 1916 game by a {{score of}} 14–13. Syracuse jumped to a 13–0 lead, but Michigan came back with 14 points in the fourth quarter. After an injury sidelined quarterback Cliff Sparks earlier in the game, backup Harold Zeiger scored both touchdowns, and left halfback John Maulbetsch {{converted}} both kicks for points after touchdown. The first touchdown, with four minutes remaining in the game, resulted in a holding penalty moved {{the ball to the}} Syracuse six-yard line. After two unsuccessful line plays, the Wolverines lined up for a fake field goal, and Zeiger picked up the ball and ran around the right side for a touchdown. With two minutes remaining, Maurice Dunne intercepted a Syracuse pass at the 45-yard line. Cedric Smith threw to Dunne for 33 yards, and Syracuse was then penalized when Syracuse's coach Hollenbach stepped onto the field. [...] The penalty advanced the ball to Syracuse's six-yard line. [...] On second down, Zeiger ran four yards for a touchdown. [...] With the game riding on the attempt at extra point, [...] "Maulbetsch <b>took</b> <b>his</b> <b>time,</b> finally kicking the ball squarely between the uprights."

2500|$|Watson's {{first major}} {{championship}} win {{came at the}} 2012 Masters Tournament. He began the final round at six-under-par, three strokes off the lead, held by Peter Hanson. On the back nine, Watson bogeyed the par-3 12th hole to return to even par for the round. He then recorded four consecutive birdies for a round of 68 (-4) and tied for the 72-hole lead with fourth-round playing partner Louis Oosthuizen at ten-under-par. In the sudden-death playoff, Oosthuizen and Watson both made par on the uphill 18th hole. On the next hole, the downhill 10th, both drove their tee shots towards the woods {{to the right of}} the hole. Oosthuizen's landed in the rough [...] away, while Watson's ball landed deep in the woods on pine straw, [...] from the pin without a clear shot to the green. Watson executed a miraculous recovery shot with 40 yards of hook on his 52-degree gap wedge and stopped the ball within fifteen feet of the hole. Oosthuizen's approach shot landed short of the green, but he chipped past the hole and narrowly missed his lengthy putt for par. Watson trickled his birdie putt a foot past the hole, <b>took</b> <b>his</b> <b>time</b> on the very short par putt, then made it for the emotional victory. The win took him to a world ranking of four, a career-high at the time.|$|E
2500|$|Ken Barrington {{started as}} a free-scoring {{off-side}} player, but – determined to regain {{his place in the}} England Test team – he opened his stance and became a defensive leg-side player. In the 1960s he was the backbone of the England team, whose batting had proved so fragile to the Australian bowling in the 1958-59 Ashes series, but he was a match-saver rather than a match-winner, always best in a crisis. The selectors, press and public thought that he surrendered the initiative too much to the bowlers, but a batsman of his calibre could not be ignored. He was a great worrier and had trouble sleeping during a Test match or if he was not out overnight, which led in turn to exhaustion. As a batsman he was a nervous waiter in the dressing room and preferred to bat at number three to reduce the tension. He would smoke cigarettes to calm himself down and would watch closely to see how the wicket was playing. Barrington <b>took</b> <b>his</b> <b>time</b> walking out to the crease and the Australian wicket-keeper Wally Grout said [...] "Whenever I saw Ken coming to the wicket, I thought the Union Jack was trailing behind him". Once there he would inspect the pitch and subject it to [...] "incessant prodding", and would hold up play if the captain changed the field so that he could inspect it. A nervous starter he would make 20–30 runs quickly enough, but gave chances to the bowlers, who tried to take advantage of this. Once settled he would slow down and would sink into lethargy until he neared his century, which four times in Tests he brought up with a massive pull for six. Yet there was method even in this, fielding captains tended to add close-fielders in the 'nervous nineties', so Barrington just hit the ball over their heads into the outfield.|$|E
