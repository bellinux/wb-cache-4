5|$|Only Roman {{citizens}} (both plebeians and patricians) had {{the right}} to confer magisterial powers (potestas) on any individual magistrate. The most important power was imperium, which was held by consuls (the chief magistrates) and by praetors (the second highest-ranking ordinary magistrate). Defined narrowly, imperium simply gave a magistrate the authority to command a military force. Defined more broadly, however, imperium gave a magistrate the constitutional authority to issue commands (military, diplomatic, civil, or otherwise). A magistrate's imperium was at its apex while <b>the</b> <b>magistrate</b> was abroad. While <b>the</b> <b>magistrate</b> was in the city of Rome itself, however, he had to completely surrender his imperium, so that liberty (libertas) was maximized.

50|$|In 1293, {{the larger}} guilds objected the large {{influence}} the nobility {{had on the}} city government. After these guilds did well in the council elections, the council sought to shift power from <b>the</b> <b>magistrates</b> to <b>the</b> council. All sorts of allegations were made against <b>the</b> <b>magistrates</b> and it came to violent scenes between <b>the</b> <b>magistrates</b> and <b>the</b> council. The council impounded the book in which all land transfers were registered and demanded that it be kept under auspices of the Burding, the citizen's council, rather than {{under the auspices of}} the Burgrave's court and the Schultheiß. The key of the book was taken away from <b>the</b> <b>magistrates.</b> In <b>the</b> following year, the archbishop gave in to these demands. Duke Albert I of Saxony sold the post of Burgrave of Magdeburg for 900 Marks to Eric, who was reimbursed by the city. Eric undertook to enfeoff the same person with the posts of Burgrave and Schultheiß. Lay magistrates were to be selected by the city council and the five guild masters and their selection confirmed by the archbishop. Conveyancing would henceforth be done in the Burgrave's court. Later that year, the city also purchased the post of Schultheiß. Thus, the city council found itself in a significantly different position: they now needed to realize their newly gained powers vis-à-vis <b>the</b> <b>magistrates.</b> In March 1295, the city council transferred jurisdiction of real estate and inheritance cases to the Burgrave's court, allowing <b>the</b> <b>magistrates</b> to focus on criminal offences. <b>The</b> <b>magistrates</b> objected to this transfer. The city council also used its privilege to select new magistrates, ignoring objections from <b>the</b> old <b>magistrates</b> who were still in office.|$|R
