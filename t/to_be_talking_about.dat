25|$|For all its {{usefulness}} in resolving questions regarding infinite sets, naive set theory has some fatal flaws. In particular, it is prey to logical paradoxes {{such as those}} exposed by Russell's paradox. The discovery of these paradoxes revealed that not all sets which {{can be described in}} the language of naive set theory can actually be said to exist without creating a contradiction. The 20th century saw a resolution to these paradoxes {{in the development of the}} various axiomatizations of set theories such as ZFC and NBG in common use today. However, the gap between the very formalized and symbolic language of these theories and our typical informal use of mathematical language results in various paradoxical situations, as well as the philosophical question of exactly what it is that such formal systems actually propose <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about.</b>|$|E
25|$|Ecofeminism {{and deep}} ecology {{have been in}} {{dialogue}} for some time now, and while the debate between them has been very fruitful over the years, the exploration of their relationship remains important. As valuable as our individually reconnecting {{with the natural world}} may be, and as much as such experiences should be encouraged, some have questioned whether this approach is sufficient, given the magnitude of the threat that human encroachment poses to the nonhuman world. With this in mind, the call has been made for a broader challenge to the dominant culture than deep ecological experience may offer. This call has come most forcefully from another school of environmental ethics: ecofeminism. While sharing with deep ecologists a general concern for biocentrism and an appreciation for personal interaction with nonhuman reality, ecofeminists have also offered some harsh criticism of Leopold, Callicott, and advocates of the deep ecological approach, as well as extensionists like Singer and Regan. Like deep ecology, ecofeminism is not a singular theory, and covers a broad range of thought; in rough terms, its criticism of other forms of nature ethics is grounded in an attempt to synthesize the insights of environmental ethics and animal advocacy with a feminist analysis of Western ethics and culture. The resulting attempt to rethink our relationship to the animal and nature casts speciesism and anthropocentrism as symptoms of a deeper patriarchy in the Western tradition that needs to be deconstructed before a successful animal ethic can be produced. As Josephine Donovan details, there is evidence to suggest a strong emotional and philosophical affinity among Anglo-American antivivisectionists and suffragettes, who viewed their causes as common responses to Enlightenment rationalism and scientism, and jointly sought a “feminizing” of culture that would liberate human and animal alike. Ecological feminism began as a critique and rejection of the western cultural worldview with its overemphasis on rationality, and linearity. It argued against a Cartesian science which elevated the material and objective above the spiritual and the subjective as appropriate ways of knowing the world. Like deep ecology, ecological feminism stresses the importance of experience, and personal experience at that. However, the ecofeminists seem <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> experience in a sense more related to bioregionalism than deep ecology.|$|E

This was the best result in the Libertarian Party's history by raw vote number, though under the 1.1 percentage of the vote won by Ed Clark in 1980. Despite falling short of his stated goal of 5%, Johnson stated, [...] "Ours is a mission accomplished."

He also commented that [...] "the song kind of takes us there, I say 'kind of' because the first line used <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> until a child was born, but it was instantly a Christmas song... but it does, the first verse goes through talking about how we were completely separated until the cross, basically." [...] Regarding the chorus of the song, Millard said [...] "the whole idea of the chorus and the sense that it brings in, with the tons of voices singing, is the fact that there's a day thats going to come when we are going to worship and be as one." ...|$|E

Pellegrini {{did not see the}} game against Arsenal as a [...] "friendly", and expected his opponents to provide a good test for Manchester City in the Shield match and thereafter in the league season. He was satisfied overall with the club's transfer activity during the summer, in particular praising goalkeeper Willy Caballero. When asked about Wenger's comments about Manchester City, he retorted: [...] "As a manager we have enough problems with our own teams <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> other teams." [...] Pellegrini expressed his belief that Lampard's transfer was not done by underhand tactics – [...] "we didn’t spend any money in bringing him from New York City to Manchester City," [...] and added the player was not offered a contract to remain at Chelsea.|$|E

500|$|In {{the summer}} of 1958, Hoyland {{prompted}} controversy by offering the island to the American TV quiz show Bid 'n' Buy as a prize. After an outcry {{on both sides of}} the Atlantic, the show's producers settled for offering a car instead. In December 1960, he sold Stroma to James Simpson, an islander whose family had moved to farm on the mainland near the Castle of Mey in 1943. Simpson had not originally intended to buy the island but happened <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> it with a lawyer: [...] "I said, 'I see Stroma was sold last week, and it's not sold this week. Is it on the market?' 'Yes,' he said, 'Stroma's for sale.' I said, [...] "What kind of money?" [...] So he told me what kind of money, and there and then, the lawyer wrote that I, James Simpson, offered to buy the island of Stroma at a certain figure, and I signed my name at the end of it." [...] His wife was not enthusiastic about the purchase: [...] "Lena nearly flew at me for being so stupid. She says, 'Stroma? What on earth are you going to do with an island?'". He was successful in his bid and used the island to graze his animals, repopulating it with around 200 sheep and 30 cattle.|$|E

2500|$|Cantrell is {{critical}} of religion and Young Earth Creationism, satirizing them both in Alice In Chains' 2013 Album, The Devil Put Dinosaurs Here.

[...] "No one in the band claims to be an expert on religion, but the title of the song [...] comes from something {{that a lot of people}} actually believe in". Cantrell also stated that he’s sick of the hypocrisy that’s taken over many facets of organized religion. [...] "I think there’s overwhelming evidence that things aren’t working right now.

[...] Immediately following DeVoe's phone call, Hoppus and Barker began laying down new ideas. Recording in Barker's basement and Hoppus' dining room, by necessity everything was electronic, with the two musicians experimenting with electronic drums, samples, keyboards and direct computer recordings. While away on a trip in April 2005, Hoppus participated in an interview with MTV News in which he revealed the band's existence, saying [...] "Right now, Travis and I are using the time off to start this project called Plus-44 [...] It's very exciting, like a breath of fresh air." [...] When the two regrouped, they decided to stop giving interviews about the new project. [...] "It was strange <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> music that we were just in the very first steps of writing," [...] recalled Hoppus. [...] "It didn’t feel right to talk about yet." [...] The band's name is a reference to the country code needed when placing a phone call to the United Kingdom, where Hoppus and Barker first discussed making music alone. [...] "When we first started talking about ever doing anything outside of blink was on the last European tour where Tom was telling us that he needed to take a year off from the band. [...] We never did anything about it until Tom quit the band, but that's where it first started," [...] said Hoppus. The basement recordings were ambient and quiet by necessity. [...] "We were recording and we didn't want the cops showing up at our house at 2 a.m. because we were recording drums," [...] remembered Hoppus.|$|E
