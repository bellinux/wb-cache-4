5000|$|Two {{transmitters}} {{operated on}} 101.6 FM. The {{first of these}} was situated in Medstead which is close to Four Marks.

50|$|The <b>transmitter</b> <b>covered</b> two sectors (roughly {{north and}} south) and its array was 200 m long and 30 m high. The power of each sector was about 3MW. The {{receiver}} was a building 100m x 100m containing 2 passive electronically scanned array radars {{as well as}} the command and control centre for the A-35 system. The range of the system was 2500 km.|$|R

25|$|Commercial {{television}} {{could be}} received in Cornwall from 1961, with the combined launches of Westward Television and the Caradon Hill transmitting station. There was an additional transmitter at Stockland Hill, but this covered {{the east of}} Westward's region, namely east Devon, West Dorset and south Somerset. Only the Caradon Hill <b>transmitter</b> <b>covered</b> Cornwall, which meant that reception was virtually non-existent in the West of the county, until the Redruth transmitting station was built in 1964.|$|R

50|$|The Biedenkopf <b>transmitter</b> <b>covers</b> {{mostly the}} very mountainous region around {{the cities of}} Waldeck and Frankenberg to the north, {{as well as the}} area to the south up to the city of Limburg an der Lahn. It also happens to reach far into the east and {{south-east}} direction including Frankfurt am Main. The signals don't reach into the west at all because of the unsuitable geography, and the Taunus mountain range restricts the range to the south.|$|R
50|$|The {{most common}} type of {{receiver}} before vacuum tubes was the crystal set, although some early radios used some type of amplification through electric current or battery. Inventions of the triode amplifier, motor-generator, and detector enabled audio radio. The use of amplitude modulation (AM), with which more than one station can simultaneously send signals (as opposed to spark-gap radio, where one <b>transmitter</b> <b>covers</b> the entire bandwidth of spectra) was pioneered by Fessenden and Lee de Forest.|$|R

50|$|The {{invention}} of amplitude-modulated (AM) radio, {{so that more}} than one station can send signals (as opposed to spark-gap radio, where one <b>transmitter</b> <b>covers</b> the entire bandwidth of the spectrum) is attributed to Reginald Fessenden and Lee de Forest. On Christmas Eve 1906, Reginald Fessenden used an Alexanderson alternator and rotary spark-gap transmitter to make the first radio audio broadcast, from Brant Rock, Massachusetts. Ships at sea heard a broadcast that included Fessenden playing O Holy Night on the violin and reading a passage from the Bible.|$|R

50|$|Due to the {{geographical}} conditions, Delta Radio used five <b>transmitters</b> to <b>cover</b> its transmission area, which broadcast on four separate frequencies.

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} unlimitedThe dependence of received power on range witnin and belcvv atmospheric ducts {{was measured in}} conditions of elevated, nonhomogeneous, multilayered ducts. An aircraft with UHF <b>transmitter</b> <b>covered</b> the range to 150 nm. from a shore based receiver. Range dependent maxima and minima in received power were detected at tne surface in elevated duct conditions. The results were compared to predictions from ray, waveguide multi- mode, and single mode theories. Ray and single mode theories were inadequate to predict power patterns over the horizon. Multi-mode theory yielded qualitative agreement for conditions of deep, low elevated ducts. Agreement for higher, thinner ducts was poor. Multilayered duct systems were observed and produced interference patterns without recognizable period with range. [URL] Commander, United States Nav...|$|R
