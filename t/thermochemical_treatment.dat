50|$|Alonizing is a {{diffusion}} metallizing {{process in}} that it is a <b>thermochemical</b> <b>treatment</b> that involves enriching the surface layer of an object with one or more metallic elements. Specifically, alonizing is the diffusion of aluminum into the surface of a base metal through high temperature vapors. The types of metals that can be alonized include all types of wrought and cast steels (i.e. plain carbon and low alloy grades, ferritic and austenitic steels, highly alloyed nickel-chromium steels, etc.). This process results in an alloy with the surface properties of aluminum while retaining the base metal’s inherent strength and rigidity. Therefore, alonizing does not change the high-temperature mechanical properties of the base metal, which is the advantage of alonizing over simply creating an aluminum alloy (aluminizing the surface versus aluminum throughout the alloy).|$|E

40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} this article is to {{evaluate}} the development efficiency of classical steel <b>thermochemical</b> <b>treatment.</b> The criterion assumed for dividing the technologies into groups was the <b>thermochemical</b> <b>treatment</b> kind. Three technology groups were selected to realised researches, as follows: nitriding, carburising and diffusion boriding. Design/methodology/approach: In the framework of foresight-materials science researches: a group of matrices characterising technology strategic position was created, materials science experiments using: light microscope, transmission and scanning electron microscopes, X-ray diffractometer, microhardness tester, work-stands for testing of thermal fatigue resistance and mechanical fatigue strength, abrasion and corrosion resistance were conducted and technology roadmaps were prepared. Findings: The outcarried researches pointed out the great industrial importance of nitriding and carburising and good perspectives for these technology groups. However, diffusion boriding is obsolete and will slowly leave the market. Research limitations/implications: Researches concerning steel <b>thermochemical</b> <b>treatment</b> constitute a part of a larger research project aimed at identifying, researching, and characterizing the priority innovative technologies in the field of materials surface engineering.

30|$|Figure 6 {{illustrates}} the temperature dependencies of χ for specimens # 3 (cobalt catalyst). The XRD analysis reveals {{the presence of}} Co particles for this specimen (Fig. 3, curve 1). As {{it can be seen}} from Fig. 6, a complex temperature behavior of χ is observed for the source specimen. The observed specific behavior of the χ(T) curves is thought to be caused by phase transformations of cobalt upon heating (in particular, by its partial oxidizing). The X-ray studies do not reveal presence of Co or cobalt oxides at any subsequent stages of the <b>thermochemical</b> <b>treatment.</b> This could be caused by a high dispersity of Co or cobalt oxide particles. However, the thermomagnetic studies allow qualitative analysis of the transformations in the ferromagnetic phases resulting from the <b>thermochemical</b> <b>treatment.</b> Washing of the source specimen in a hydrochloric acid solution (# 3 -C) leads to a substantial (more than tenfold) reduction of χ. However, no significant changes in the character of the χ(T) curve were observed. This observation suggests that such the <b>thermochemical</b> <b>treatment</b> procedure does not in general allow a complete removal of the catalyst refuses. A different situation is observed at further stages of the <b>thermochemical</b> <b>treatment.</b> Annealing of the source NCM specimen and the subsequent washing in a hydrochloric acid solution (# 3 -TC) results in a sharp decrease (more than by two orders) of the χ-values. Moreover, the magnetic susceptibility is almost independent of temperature. This indicates an extremely low content of the metal catalyst in specimen # 3 -TC. Thus, the proposed scheme of NCM cleaning from cobalt catalyst refuses is quite efficient. This conclusion is in agreement with the data of the X-ray microprobe analysis (see Table 1).|$|E
