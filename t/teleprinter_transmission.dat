5000|$|The Colossus {{computers}} {{were used to}} help decipher intercepted radio teleprinter messages that had been encrypted using an unknown device. Intelligence information revealed that the Germans called the wireless <b>teleprinter</b> <b>transmission</b> systems [...] "Sägefisch" [...] (sawfish). This led the British to call encrypted German teleprinter traffic [...] "Fish", and the unknown machine and its intercepted messages [...] "Tunny" [...] (tunafish).|$|E
5000|$|Bletchley Park decrypts of {{messages}} enciphered with the Enigma machines {{revealed that the}} Germans called one of their wireless <b>teleprinter</b> <b>transmission</b> systems [...] "Sägefisch" [...] (sawfish) which led British cryptographers to refer to encrypted German radiotelegraphic traffic as Fish. The code Tunny (tunafish) was the name given to the first non-Morse link, and it was subsequently used for the Lorenz SZ machines and the traffic enciphered by them.|$|E
5000|$|In {{the summer}} of 1941, Tutte was {{transferred}} {{to work on a}} project called Fish. Intelligence information had revealed that that the Germans called the wireless <b>teleprinter</b> <b>transmission</b> systems [...] "Sägefisch" [...] (sawfish). This led the British to use the code Fish for the German teleprinter cipher system. The nickname Tunny (tunafish) was used for the first non-Morse link, and it was subsequently used for the Lorenz SZ machines and the traffic that they enciphered.|$|E
50|$|Continuous wave (CW) is on-and-off keying of a carrier, {{used for}} Morse code {{communications}} and Hellschreiber facsimile-based <b>teleprinter</b> <b>transmissions.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Cryptanalysis of the Enigma {{enabled the}} western Allies in World War II to read {{substantial}} amounts of secret Morse-coded radio communications of the Axis powers that had been enciphered using Enigma machines. This yielded military intelligence which, along with that from other decrypted Axis radio and <b>teleprinter</b> <b>transmissions,</b> was given the codename Ultra. This was considered by western Supreme Allied Commander Dwight D. Eisenhower to have been [...] "decisive" [...] to the Allied victory.|$|R
50|$|Studies {{have been}} {{conducted}} on the readability and legibility of all caps text. Scientific testing from the 20th-century onwards has generally indicated that all caps text is less legible and readable than lower-case text. In addition, switching to all caps may make text appear hectoring and obnoxious for cultural reasons, since all-capitals is often used in transcribed speech {{to indicate that the}} speaker is shouting. All-caps text is common in comic books, as well as on older <b>teleprinter</b> and radio <b>transmission</b> systems which often do not indicate letter case at all.|$|R
5000|$|Maidenhead {{locators}} {{are also}} {{commonly referred to}} as QTH Locator, grid locators or grid squares, although the [...] "squares" [...] are distorted on any non-equirectangular cartographic projection. Use of the terms QTH locator and QRA locator was initially discouraged, as it caused confusion with the older QRA locator system. The only abbreviation recommended to indicate a Maidenhead reference in Morse code and radio <b>teleprinter</b> <b>transmission</b> was [...] "LOC", as in [...] "LOC KN28LH".|$|E
5000|$|In June 1941, the British [...] "Y" [...] {{wireless}} intercept stations, {{as well as}} receiving Enigma-enciphered Morse code traffic, {{started to}} receive non-Morse traffic which was initially called NoMo. NoMo1 was a German army link between Berlin and Athens, and NoMo2 a temporary air force link between Berlin and Königsberg. The parallel Enigma-enciphered link to NoMo2, which was being read by Government Code and Cypher School at Bletchley Park, revealed that the Germans called the wireless <b>teleprinter</b> <b>transmission</b> systems [...] "Sägefisch" [...] (sawfish). This led the British to use the code Fish dubbing the machine and its traffic Tunny.|$|E
5000|$|During World War II {{despatch}} riders {{were often}} referred to as Don Rs (from phonetic for D in [...] "DR") in Commonwealth forces. [...] In World War II, Royal Corps of Signals soldiers carried out the role and the Royal Signals Motorcycle Display Team was formed from their number. They were also used by the Royal Air Force and the Royal Navy, where they maintained contact with land bases and some of the riders were members of the Women's Royal Naval Service. In the UK Bletchley Park used to receive transmissions from the listening stations (Y-stations) by despatch riders, although later this was switched to <b>teleprinter</b> <b>transmission.</b>|$|E
5000|$|... "Speed", {{intended}} to be roughly comparable to words per minute, is the standard term introduced by Western Union for a mechanical <b>teleprinter</b> data <b>transmission</b> rate using the 5-bit ITA2 code that was popular in the 1940s and for several decades thereafter. Such a machine would send 1 start bit, 5 data bits, and 1.42 stop bits. This unusual stop bit time is actually a rest period to allow the mechanical printing mechanism to synchronize {{in the event that}} a garbled signal is received. This is true especially on High frequency radio circuits where selective fading is present. Selective fading causes the mark signal amplitude to be randomly different from the space signal amplitude. Selective fading, or Rayleigh fading can cause two carriers to randomly and independently fade to different depths. [...] Since modern computer equipment cannot easily generate 1.42 bits for the stop period, common practice is to either approximate this with 1.5 bits, or to send 2.0 bits while accepting 1.0 bits receiving.|$|R
