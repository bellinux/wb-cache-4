50|$|Most {{electro-mechanical}} designs {{incorporate a}} lead screw and lead nut. Some use a ball screw and ball nut. In either case the screw may be connected to a motor or manual control knob either directly or {{through a series of}} gears. Gears are typically used to allow a smaller (and weaker) motor spinning at a higher rpm to be geared down to provide the torque necessary to spin the screw under a heavier load than the motor would otherwise be capable of driving directly. Effectively this sacrifices actuator speed in favor of increased actuator thrust. In some applications the use of worm gear is common as this allow a smaller built in dimension still allowing great <b>travel</b> <b>length.</b>|$|E
50|$|Running through Columbus Day {{weekend in}} October, Granville's Harvest Fair attracts vendors {{and people from}} all over New England. The fair {{stretches}} along Route 57 from the Granville Village School to the Granville Town Hall (1.4 miles) and has shops lining the streets with a majority of the fair centered at the school, town hall and the town green. A busing system would travel between these three points, however, as of 2012 the fair removed the town hall from being the last stop in exchange for the Nobel and Cooley Drum Factory located on Water St. This reduced the overall <b>travel</b> <b>length</b> of the buses in half from 1.4 miles to 0.7 mile.

50|$|Since the 1950s, {{evidence}} has existed that neurons {{in the central}} nervous system generate an action potential, or voltage spike, that travels both through the axon to signal the next neuron and backpropagates through the dendrites sending a retrograde signal to its presynaptic signaling neurons. This current decays significantly with <b>travel</b> <b>length</b> along the dendrites, so effects are predicted to be more significant for neurons whose synapses are near the postsynaptic cell body, with magnitude depending mainly on sodium-channel density in the dendrite. It is also dependent on the shape of the dendritic tree and, more importantly, on the rate of signal currents to the neuron. On average, a backpropagating spike loses about half its voltage after traveling nearly 500 micrometres.|$|E

5000|$|The goal of many {{laboratories}} {{around the}} world is creating semiconductors that can operate faster than current technology. Specifically, electrons within the transistor will be able to actively travel with no collisions. [...] Research shows that with low velocities come unstable electron flow. Thus, when the electrons have a high velocity and long distance over which they can remain ballistic, then {{they will be able to}} travel through semiconductor material without being scattered. Currently, the silicon Metal Oxide Semiconductor Field-Effect Transistor (MOSFET) is the main and leading research circuit. However, researchers predict that finding the ideal semiconductor will increase the dimensions of the transistor, even greater than the current silicon. In the early 1960s, there has been speculation that replacing the silicon with metal would increase the energy barrier between electrons and the semiconductor. Scientists now are also currently trying to improve two aspects of the standard transistor. The first is the common emitter, which is an amplifier used as a reference point between the point and collector. Scientists are trying to reduce the width of the emitter, in belief that it would increase the speed of electrons. The second is the base of the transistor. Scientists are trying to make the base as thin as possible, even as thin as 70 nanometers, so that there is a less <b>travel</b> <b>length</b> and time for the electrons through the base. When a device exceeds its permitted power consumption, there will be a leakage current. The ideal transistor should maintain a low to no leakage current. In order for this to happen, the device will have to operate in low temperatures, again meaning that it will have to use very little power. A prototype of the transistor has recently been created by the Cornell Nanofabrication Facility.|$|E

A set of 420 sorted marked pebbles (0. 032 < D < 0. 512 m) was displaced across the stream and their movements were checked periodically. After introducing a criterion to define incipient motion condition based on the ratio between pebble <b>travel</b> <b>length</b> and diameter, {{it is possible to}} establish the initiation of movements.

30|$|The Bell Crank {{system is}} the one {{with a pair of}} wheels on a bell crank, each bogie {{connected}} by a short arm and lever to a central spring running the tank length [9]. This system had too much interconnection but decent <b>travel</b> <b>length</b> and tended to make the tank sway back and forth a lot in motion. The single and double Torsion Bar system is a common modern-type tank suspension and can be found today on many fast track layers. The original structure and concept appeared on the German tiger tanks [10]. A steel bar runs under the bottom of the tank and twists with a short trailing arm connected to it and carrying a wheel. As the wheels hit bumps, the bar twists to absorb the impact. This system is compact, light, simple to manufacture and can provide decent <b>travel</b> <b>length.</b>|$|E

30|$|Later on, leaf-sprung bogies are {{introduced}} in the tank suspension design [3, 4]. The system is made {{of a pair of}} wheels carried on leaf sprigs or leaf-sprung arms. When one wheel is raised like by contacting terrain, the other is lowered to keep uniform track pressure, which is rather light, maintenance-friendly, has decent <b>travel</b> <b>length</b> and keeps the tracks from slipping. Since the friction of the leaves sliding over each other dampens oscillation, no shock absorbers are needed. This cheap and effective system was quickly adopted widely and modified into various forms [3, 4].|$|E

40|$|A {{range of}} early {{studies have been}} {{conducted}} to illustrate human mobility patterns using different tracking data, such as dollar notes, cell phones and taxicabs. Here, we explore human mobility patterns based on massive tracking data of US flights. Both topological and geometric properties are examined in detail. We found that topological properties, such as traffic volume (between airports) and degree of connectivity (of individual airports), including both in- and outdegrees, follow a power law distribution but not a geometric property like <b>travel</b> <b>lengths.</b> The <b>travel</b> <b>lengths</b> exhibit an exponential distribution rather than a power law with an exponential cutoff as previous studies illustrated. We further simulated human mobility on the established topologies of airports with various moving behaviors and found that the mobility patterns are mainly attributed to the underlying binary topology of airports and {{have little to do with}} other factors, such as moving behaviors and geometric distances. Apart from the above findings, this study adopts the head/tail division rule, which is regularity behind any heavy-tailed distribution for extracting individual airports. The adoption of this rule for data processing constitutes another major contribution of this paper.
