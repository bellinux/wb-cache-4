25|$|We now {{proceed to}} the general definition: A family of bounded {{operators}} {T'x}x∈ X with T'x ∈ L(H'x) {{is said to be}} strongly measurable if and only if its restriction to each X'n is strongly measurable. <b>This</b> <b>makes</b> <b>sense</b> because H'x is constant on X'n.|$|E
25|$|Anatomists {{and other}} {{researchers}} focused exclusively on human anatomy, on the other hand, tend to elaborate this definition in various ways and, consequently, {{there are hundreds of}} definitions. Some anatomists restrict opposition to when the thumb is approximated to the fifth digit (little finger) and refer to other approximations between the thumb and other digits as apposition. To anatomists, <b>this</b> <b>makes</b> <b>sense</b> as two intrinsic hand muscles are named for this specific movement (the opponens pollicis and opponens digiti minimi respectively).|$|E
25|$|Fish {{generally}} prefer larger shoals. <b>This</b> <b>makes</b> <b>sense,</b> as larger shoal usually {{provide better}} protection against predators. Indeed, {{the preference for}} larger shoals seems stronger when predators are nearby, or in species that rely more on shoaling than body armour against predation. Larger shoals may also find food faster, though that food {{would have to be}} shared amongst more individuals. Competition may mean that hungry individuals might prefer smaller shoals or exhibit a lesser preference for very large shoals, as shown in sticklebacks.|$|E

25|$|Fish tend {{to prefer}} shoals {{made up of}} {{individuals}} that match their own size. <b>This</b> <b>makes</b> <b>sense</b> as predators {{have an easier time}} catching individuals that stand out in a shoal. Some fish may even prefer shoals of another species if this means a better match in current body size. As for shoal size however, hunger can affect the preference for similarly-sized fish; large fish, for example, might prefer to associate with smaller ones because of the competitive advantage they will gain over these shoalmates. In golden shiner, large satiated fish prefer to associate with other large individuals, but hungry ones prefer smaller shoalmates.|$|E
25|$|Aggressiveness also {{arises from}} a need of space. Young pike {{tend to have}} their food robbed by larger pike. Pike are {{aggressive}} if not given enough space because they are territorial. They use a form of foraging known as sit-and-wait. Unlike species such as perch, pike undergo bursts of energy instead of actively chasing down prey. As such, {{a fair amount of}} inactive time occurs until they find prey. Hunting efficiency decreases with competition; the larger the pike, the larger the area controlled by that particular pike. An inverse relation to vegetation density and pike size exists, which is due to the possibility of cannibalism from the largest pike. <b>This</b> <b>makes</b> <b>sense,</b> as the smaller pike need more vegetation to avoid being eaten. Large pike do not have this worry and can afford the luxury of a large line of sight. They prefer a tree structure habitat.|$|E

2500|$|Standard {{deviation}} {{may serve}} as a measure of uncertainty. [...] In physical science, for example, the reported standard deviation of a group of repeated measurements gives the precision of those measurements. [...] When deciding whether measurements agree with a theoretical prediction, the standard deviation of those measurements is of crucial importance: [...] if the mean of the measurements is too far away from the prediction (with the distance measured in standard deviations), then the theory being tested probably needs to be revised. <b>This</b> <b>makes</b> <b>sense</b> since they fall outside the range of values that could reasonably be expected to occur, if the prediction were correct and the standard deviation appropriately quantified.

2500|$|When {{the player}} wants to attack, they move their piece onto a square {{occupied}} by an opposing piece. Both players then reveal their piece's rank; the weaker piece (see exceptions below) {{is removed from}} the board. If the engaging pieces are of equal rank, both are removed. A piece may not move onto a square already occupied unless it attacks. [...] Two pieces have special attack powers. One special piece is the Bomb which only Miners can defuse. It immediately eliminates any other piece striking it, without itself being destroyed. Each player also has one Spy, which succeeds only if it attacks the Marshal, or the Flag. If the Spy attacks any other piece, or is attacked by any piece (including the Marshal), the Spy is defeated. [...] The original rules contained a provision that following a strike, the winning piece immediately occupies the space vacated by the losing piece. [...] <b>This</b> <b>makes</b> <b>sense</b> when the winning piece belongs to the player on move, but no sense when the winning piece belongs to the player not on move. [...] The latter part of the rule has been quietly ignored in most play.|$|E
2500|$|Local legend {{states that}} to {{counteract}} this resistance, Bowman ordered that {{the construction of}} the walls would start at the top floor and work its way down, so the project could not be canceled. This has been traced to an account in November 21, 1943, issue of At Ease, a tabloid related to local military personnel on campus, which stated that [...] "the masonry was started from the top downward." [...] Construction photographs show that this was not the case, and that some stonework was done on the first floor before any other stonework was begun. One engineer with the company working on the Cathedral explained that the exterior walls of the Cathedral are not load-bearing. Because of this, many similar buildings would start construction at the third or fourth floors. Practically, <b>this</b> <b>makes</b> <b>sense,</b> as it allows easy movement of building materials and equipment {{into and out of the}} building. Instead, in the Cathedral's case, the issue was one of the stone that would be used in lower stories. In fact, the quarry was not prepared to deliver the stone on schedule, so construction was delayed, and work began on the higher stories.|$|E
