40|$|It {{is known}} that for any finite/co-finite set of primes there exists a network which has a rate 1 {{solution}} {{if and only if}} <b>the</b> <b>characteristic</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> finite field belongs to the given set. We generalize this result to show that for any positive rational number k/n, and for any given finite/co-finite set of primes, there exists a network which has a rate k/n fractional linear network coding solution if and only if <b>the</b> <b>characteristic</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> finite field belongs to the given set. For this purpose we construct two networks: N_ 1 and N_ 2; the network N_ 1 has a k/n fractional linear network coding solution if and only if <b>the</b> <b>characteristic</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> finite field belongs to the given finite set <b>of</b> primes, and <b>the</b> network N_ 2 has a k/n fractional linear network coding solution if and only if <b>the</b> <b>characteristic</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> finite field belongs to the given co-finite set of primes. Recently, a method has been introduced where characteristic-dependent linear rank inequalities are produced from networks whose linear coding capacity depends on <b>the</b> <b>characteristic</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> finite field. By employing this method on the networks N_ 1 and N_ 2, we construct two classes of characteristic-dependent linear rank inequalities. For any given set <b>of</b> primes, <b>the</b> first class contains an inequality which holds if <b>the</b> <b>characteristic</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> finite field does not belong to <b>the</b> given set <b>of</b> primes but may not hold otherwise; the second class contains an inequality which holds if <b>the</b> <b>characteristic</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> finite field belongs to <b>the</b> given set <b>of</b> primes but may not hold otherwise. We then use these inequalities to obtain an upper-bound on the linear coding capacity of N_ 1 and N_ 2. Comment: arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv: 1610. 0800...|$|R

He considered Acanthopholididae to be the sister clade to Stegosauridae, and also stated that it might include Hylaeosaurus, which he found had most of <b>the</b> <b>characteristics</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> family.

Along with Ankylosaurus, Acanthopholididae was defined to form a subfamily of Nodosauridae. In 1923 he divided up the family into two subfamilies without comment.
