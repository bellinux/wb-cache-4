Besides, you want quiet and rest. I have been round to the landlord, to tell him that I am going away, and to pay him a month's rent, instead of notice. I should think the best way would be for you to take a large room for yourself, or two rooms not so large--one of them for you to live in, and the other to store everything there is here. I know that you will look after them, and keep them well. Of course, you will pick out all the <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> use in your room. It will be very lonely for you, living all by yourself, but you know numbers of people here; and you might engage a girl to stay with you, for some small wages and her food. Now, you must think over what your food and hers will cost, and the rent. Of course, I want you to live comfortably; you have always been a friend rather than a servant, and my mother had the greatest trust in you." ...|$|E
6000|$|But before I {{begin to}} {{describe}} Vissarion I shall throw a sop to you [...] as a chatelaine; that may give you patience {{to read the}} rest. The [...] Castle {{needs a lot of}} things to make it comfortable--as you would [...] consider it. In fact, it is absolutely destitute of everything of a [...] domestic nature. Uncle Roger had it vetted on the defence side, and [...] so far it could stand a siege. But it couldn't cook a dinner or go [...] through a spring-cleaning! As you know, I am not much up in domestic [...] matters, and so I cannot give you details; but you may take it that [...] it wants everything. I don't mean furniture, or silver, or even [...] gold-plate, or works of art, for it is full of the most magnificent [...] old <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>can</b> imagine. I think Uncle Roger must have been [...] a collector, and gathered a lot of good things in all sorts of [...] places, stored them for years, and then sent them here. But as to [...] glass, china, delft, all sorts of crockery, linen, household [...] appliances and machinery, cooking utensils--except of the [...] simplest--there are none. I don't think Uncle Roger could have lived [...] here more than on a temporary picnic. So far as I only am concerned, [...] I am all right; a gridiron and a saucepan are all I want--and I can [...] use them myself. But, dear Aunt Janet, I don't want you to pig it. [...] I would like you to have everything you can imagine, and all of the [...] very best. Cost doesn't count now for us, thanks to Uncle Roger; and [...] so I want you to order all. I know you, dear--being a woman--won't [...] object to shopping. But it will have to be wholesale. This is an [...] enormous place, and will swallow up all you can buy--like a [...] quicksand. Do as you like about choosing, but get all the help you [...] can. Don't be afraid of getting too much. You can't, or of being [...] idle when you are here. I assure you that when you come there will [...] be so much to do and so many things to think of that you will want to [...] get away from it all. And, besides, Aunt Janet, I hope you won't be [...] too long. Indeed, I don't wish to be selfish, but your boy is [...] lonely, and wants you. And when you get here you will be an EMPRESS. [...] I don't altogether like doing so, lest I should offend a [...] millionairess like you; but it may facilitate matters, and the way's [...] of commerce are strict, though devious. So I send you a cheque for [...] 1,000 pounds for the little things: and a letter to the bank to [...] honour your own cheques for any amount I have got.|$|E
