40|$|From the {{algebraic}} perspective, {{the basic}} {{concept of the}} classical Leontief I-O (Input-Output) analysis lies in the distinction between two principal kinds of coefficient matrices: 2 ̆ 2 technical 2 ̆ 2 and 2 ̆ 2 structural. 2 ̆ 2 It is not universally recognized that neither of these expresses exactly the <b>total</b> <b>flow</b> (<b>total</b> relationships) between elements of an I-O system. Without knowledge of <b>total</b> <b>flow</b> it has been impossible to answer correctly many important theory and policy questions. In this dissertation, an initial step is taken {{to bridge the gap}} by providing a 2 ̆ 2 third choice. 2 ̆ 2 This is another coefficient (and flow) matrix that quantifies the <b>total</b> <b>flow</b> and thereby depicts adequately the full complexity of I-O relations. It is shown that <b>total</b> <b>flow</b> analysis is a useful tool in dealing with various I-O kinds of problems in economics, ecology, and other disciplines. ^ The dissertation is composed of two parts. ^ Part One: Defining <b>Total</b> <b>Flow</b> in an Ecosystem Input-Output Model. The concept of <b>total</b> <b>flow</b> is introduced. <b>Total</b> <b>flow</b> analysis is treated as a subdomain of ecological flow analysis. Its basic notions are presented and illustrated with empirical data for a particular small aquatic ecosystem [...] that of Cone Spring. The applicability of the <b>total</b> <b>flow</b> concept to specific ecology problems (such as trophic relationships, cycling of nutrients, and others) is indicated. ^ Part Two: Measuring Connectedness of Input-Output Models. The concept of scalar measures of the degree of internal connectedness in I-O models is considered. A number of measures, drawn from the economic and the ecological I-O literatures, are examined. It is shown that none of the measures represent connectedness adequately. The concept of the <b>total</b> <b>flow</b> is reviewed and applied as a basis for calculation of several indexes, such as the average <b>total</b> <b>flow</b> coefficient and the average internal multiplier, both of which are sensitive to (1) number, (2) diversity and (3) volume of I-O linkages and express appropriately the overall connectedness. ...|$|R

Injury to the mucosa, produced by a surfactant administered as a suppository, doubled <b>total</b> <b>flow</b> in areas where the damage was most severe and revealed an ability of the intramural vascular beds to react independently.

50|$|Manifold vacuum {{is caused}} by a {{different}} phenomenon than venturi vacuum, which is present inside carburetors. Venturi vacuum {{is caused by}} the venturi effect which, for fixed ambient conditions (air density and temperature), depends on the <b>total</b> mass <b>flow</b> through the carburetor. In engines that use carburetors, the venturi vacuum is approximately proportional to the <b>total</b> mass <b>flow</b> through the <b>engine</b> (and hence the total power output). As ambient pressure (altitude, weather) or temperature change, the carburetor may need to be adjusted to maintain this relationship.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Workflow {{technology}} is an emerging paradigm for systematic modeling and orchestration of job flow for enterprise and scientific applications. This paper introduces BPEL 4 Job, a BPEL-based design for fault handling of job flow in a distributed computing environment. The {{features of the}} proposed design include: a two-stage approach for job flow modeling that separates base flow structure from fault-handling policy, a generic job proxy that isolates the interaction complexity between the <b>flow</b> <b>engine</b> and the job scheduler, and a method for migrating flow instances between different <b>flow</b> <b>engines</b> for fault handling in a distributed system.

40|$|The paper {{considers}} a flowshop scheduling {{problem of a}} manufacturing cell that contains families of jobs whose setup times are dependent on the manufacturing sequence of the families. Two objectives, namely the makespan and <b>total</b> <b>flow</b> time, have been considered simultaneously in this work. Since minimisation {{of each of these}} two objectives is an Np-Hard problem, a Multi-Objective Genetic Algorithm (MOGA) has been proposed to deal with the bi-criteria optimisation problem. The performance of the proposed MOGA is compared with the makespan and <b>total</b> <b>flow</b> time lower bounds. The proposed MOGA obtained solutions that only deviate by an average of 1 % from the lower bounds. Future research will develop more efficient lower bounds for the <b>total</b> <b>flow</b> time and also compare the proposed method with other multiobjective meta-heuristics.
