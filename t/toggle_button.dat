50|$|Version 17.0 was {{released}} on September 9, 2009. Several features have been updated in this release, including SONAR, now dubbed SONAR 2. It now uses more information to determine if an application is truly malicious. Norton Insight can present users with information about the origins, activities, and performance of applications along with reputation data. A new feature codenamed Autospy helps users understand what Norton did when malware was found. Previous releases removed threats on sight and quietly warned users, potentially confusing when users are deceived in downloading rogue security software. Much of this information {{is placed on the}} back of the main window; a <b>toggle</b> <b>button</b> switches between the sides.Symantec has also added Windows 7 support. Aside from that, Symantec has also added the Norton Download Insight to prevent drive by drive downloads.|$|E

They {{can also be}} programmed to change the device's [...] "state". The n52 has 4 different color-coded states, indicated by 3 LEDs below the fifteenth button. If a user changes {{the state of the}} device from the normal one, the red, green, or blue LED lights up, and all other controls now represent a different function. The state-button can be set to act as a temporary shift button that works while it is pressed, a <b>toggle</b> <b>button,</b> or it can be set to work until it is pressed again. In total, this allows up to 104 different functions. The software can recognize games by their executable filenames, and automatically load the appropriate profile when that game is started. User-created profiles, which are technically single files, can be submitted to Belkin via e-mail, making them available for others to download.|$|E

40|$|The ForceFeedback Slider (FFS) is a {{one-dimensional}} actuated slider using a motor {{to produce}} tangible interaction with position and force as {{input and output}} parameters. To create a new concept, we have built a mixing desk, placed six FFSs (two implemented here) into a partially realized SliderBox, and added a LED and two <b>toggle</b> <b>buttons</b> to each slider for additional interactivity. We have developed a tool called BounceSlider for improvising music. This application for real time music performance and composition uses a slider handle that {{can act as a}} ball. Users can lift and release the handle to set the ball in motion and produce a particular sound each time it bounces against the baseline. Based on physical characteristics, the user can create different sounds and loops by changing two settings: gravity (speed) and bounce type (ball physical characteristics). BounceSlider allows the user to create and save loops of Musical Instrument Digital Interface (Midi) with up to five sounds at a time...|$|R

30|$|Due to {{differences}} between desktop and collaborative environments, iPCA-CE {{is designed to}} support multi-touch input. From our previous study with iPCA [6], only important and frequently used interaction features were replicated as touchable buttons in iPCA-CE. A total of 16 touchable buttons and 2 tab buttons were designed for interaction in iPCA-CE: nine buttons for interacting with represented data items (Figure 2 B- 6), six buttons for controlling the application (Figure 2 B- 7), one <b>toggle</b> <b>button</b> (Figure 2 B- 8) for expanding and collapsing the slider-bars panel, and two tab buttons (Figure 2 B- 9) for managing annotations and findings.|$|E
40|$|AbstractEmbedded Components in MapleTM 10 {{enable us}} to embed simple {{graphical}} interface components for example, a button, in our document.

We could embed Button, <b>Toggle</b> <b>Button,</b> Combo Box, Check Box, List Box, Text Area, Label, Slider, Plot and Function. This latest feature has similarity as Maplet which previously introduced in Maple 8. The significant difference between these two Maple components is Maplet could be view with Maplet Viewer without having to launch a Maple session where as for the Embedded Components; it could only be view with a launched Maple session.

40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} component-based 3 D object {{manipulation}} framework using a magnet metaphor for 2 D and 3 D integrated toolkit system. The authors {{have been studying}} component based 3 D software development systems. For the development of 3 D graphics applications, the layout of 3 D objects is important factor. However, it is very laborious work {{and it takes a}} long time because 3 D objects have six degrees of freedom (DOF) and it is not easy to lay out them using a standard 2 D input device, i. e., a mouse device. In the real world, every object exists contacting with other objects and then it has three DOF, i. e., x-y translation and z-axis rotation because the gravity exists. Then, the authors introduced new component that behaves like the magnet to simulate the simplified gravity effect for positioning 3 D objects. Furthermore, 3 D graphics applications need 2 D graphical components for the interface of interactive operations, e. g., pop-up menus, <b>toggle</b> <b>buttons,</b> pull-down menus and so on. This paper also proposes the construction of such 2 D interfaces using 3 D primitives. The new 3 D component using a magnet metaphor also makes it easier to construct such 2 D-like 3 D graphical user interfaces...|$|R

40|$|Time Scale Creator (TSCreator), a {{geological}} chart generator, displays any portion of Earth history including chemo- magneto-, and other aspects. TSCreator {{is used by}} many universities, petroleum companies, and international geological surveys. In order {{to improve the quality}} of Time Scale Creator, tools were developed to provide users with more friendly graphical user interfaces (GUIs), accurate scaling of specific isotope, internationalization of data input and output, and smart depth scaling in wells to age conversion. To implement such tools, research for algorithm and common methods was basically done by searching articles online and reading posts on forums for Java developers. <b>Toggle</b> <b>buttons</b> indicating moving status of time lines were inserted into the tool bar of Crossplot frame. Internationalization was improved by accepting both European and American number formats in text boxes and entries of data packs. Strontium, an isotope used to interpret rates of mountain belt uplift and continental drift, was given four decimal place precision whereas other isotopes have standard two to three decimal places precision. Finally, an algorithm for naturally dividing depth range was inserted for depth scales in Depth/ Age Conversion. The Depth-Age system will be used with university lab modules. These developed tools enhance user experience and performance of Time Scale Creator. The improvements were already used by two university workshops in China, and will be used by petroleum-exploration workshops in Australia. An article about this system is planned for publication...|$|R

50|$|<b>Toggles</b> {{and simple}} <b>buttons</b> {{had been made}} {{throughout}} England since time immemorial to meet local needs. Buttons were traded between towns by itinerant peddlers. {{but there was no}} organised trade or centres of production beyond this. Around 1600, men's upper-body clothing was beginning its transition from the doublet to the coat. Buttons became larger, more prominent and became a specialist item made by button-makers, rather than tailors.|$|R
50|$|In {{addition}} to the standard 12-button keypad, the MicroTAC had buttons for Power, Function, Name/Menu, End, Send, Clear, Store, and Recall. The {{left side of the}} phone featured two buttons for adjusting the volume up and down. While in alpha mode, the volume <b>buttons</b> <b>toggled</b> between upper-case and lower-case text. The model sold for between U.S. $2,495 and U.S. $3,495, and was produced into the early 1990s before being replaced by newer versions.|$|R
30|$|One {{method for}} {{overcoming}} this inherent difference {{is to use}} a multitude of gestures to describe each possible operation. However, given the number of features in iPCA-CE, creating a gesture for each feature will inevitably confuse the user and steepen the learning curve, thereby lowering the usability of the system. We therefore take a “low-tech” approach by creating buttons along the borders of each portal (see Figure 2 B). The majority of the features in iPCA-CE can be performed by activating or <b>toggling</b> these <b>buttons.</b> However, for the user’s convenience, a few popular gestures that have been widely adopted by multi-touch devices (such as the iPhone) have been incorporated into the iPCA-CE interface. These gestures include resizing, zooming, and rotation by using two fingers simultaneously. During our user study, we observed that these gestures were intuitive for participants and did not introduce usability concerns during their analyses.|$|R

50|$|Another {{advancement}} {{made possible}} by the replacement of mechanical control by all electric systems was that the signalman's user interface could be enhanced to further improve productivity. The smaller size of electric <b>toggles</b> and push <b>buttons</b> put more functionality within reach of an individual signalman. Route-setting technology automated the setting of individual points and routes through busy junctions. Computerised video displays removed the physical interface altogether, replacing it with a point-and-click or touchscreen interface. Finally, the use of Automatic Route Setting removed the need for any human input at all as common train movements could be fully automated according to a schedule or other scripted logic.|$|R
