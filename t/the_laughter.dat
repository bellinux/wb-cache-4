5|$|A second joint {{appearance}} {{took place}} in Beverly Hills. According to Nixon campaign adviser Bill Arnold, Douglas arrived late, while Nixon was already speaking. Nixon ostentatiously looked at his watch, provoking laughter from the audience. <b>The</b> <b>laughter</b> recurred as Nixon, sitting behind Douglas as she spoke, fidgeted to indicate his disapproval {{of what she was}} saying; she appeared bewildered at <b>the</b> <b>laughter.</b> Douglas concluded her remarks and Nixon rose to speak again, but she did not stay to listen.|$|E

Before portraying Tim—a minor insignificant character—in multiple episodes, Tim Cunningham portrays Chuck, who works at the lab that mutates viruses. Jacqueline Cassel and Teddy Bergeron are credited as a couple, to whom Diane shows her botched artwork.|$|E

5|$|After Cain's disappearance, Mary becomes {{head of the}} Hargreaves. Augusta {{possesses}} Alexis, {{and seeks}} out Mary in the mausoleum Cain had built before leaving to confront Alexis. Augusta reveals that she manipulated Alexis into abusing his sons and trying to resurrect her for her amusement. Before she can kill Mary, Augusta triggers Cain's trap in the mausoleum and dies. Years later, Mary is married to Oscar and pregnant with their child, although she still waits for his return. Crehador, a medium close to Cain, sets up a tea party for Mary, fulfilling Cain's promise; he then reminisces on how he found Cain being held by Riff's corpse within the ruined tower. The bunkoban-exclusive epilogue expands the ending slightly. It shows an elderly Mary, who lies on her deathbed attended by a woman nearby and hears <b>the</b> <b>laughter</b> of Jizabel's ghost as he plays with his pet sheep. Sensing a presence nearby, she dies, and taking the form of her ten-year-old self, her soul joins Cain hand-in-hand at a tea party with their friends and loved ones—although they exist as spirits, a boy nearby can hear them.|$|E

40|$|The Histoire comique de Francion (1623 [...] 1633) of Charles Sorel marks {{a passage}} in <b>the</b> history of <b>laughter,</b> from <b>the</b> Renaissance to the {{classical}} period. Sorel defines the Histoire comique as a realistic genre by opposing it to the heroic, pastoral and burlesque genres. Whereas Rabelaisian works showed an ambivalent and carnivalesque <b>laughter,</b> <b>the</b> tone of Sorel's Francion is both satirical and univocal. The carnivalesque and popular traditions are mocked {{for the benefit of}} an elitist rationalism. The Francion shows a hero who distances himself from the popular culture to become a honnete homme. In order to respect <b>the</b> bienseances, <b>laughter</b> becomes spiritual, abstract and moderated. It attacks humans' ridiculous shortcomings instead of mocking the dominating classes as did <b>the</b> carnivalesque <b>laughter</b> in a debunking process. <b>The</b> polite <b>laughter</b> of <b>the</b> Francion distinguishes itself from the corporeal, excessive and regenerating laughter that one finds in Rabelais. The satire of Francion prepares for more serious endeavors...|$|R

25|$|After {{many months}} of waiting at Oscott College, Barberi finally secured {{possession}} of Aston Hall {{and so in}} February, 1842, after twenty-eight years of effort, he established the Passionists in England, at Aston Hall, Staffordshire. The reception of Barberi and his fellow Passionists was less than welcoming. The local Catholics feared the arrival of these newcomers would cause renewed persecutions. Barberi was also met with ridicule; his attempts to read prayers in English were met with <b>the</b> <b>laughter</b> of his congregation. The community increased in numbers and as the people of Aston grew to know Barberi they became enamoured of him and Barberi soon began to receive {{a steady stream of}} converts. A centre was also set up in neighboring Stone where Barberi would say Mass and preach to the local populace.|$|E

25|$|In 1926 {{he reached}} {{the quarterfinals of the}} French International Hard Court Championship partnering Béla von Kehrling; they were {{defeated}} by eventual victors Howard Kinsey and Vincent Richards. Also in 1926 he won the Rot-Weiss Tennis Club of Berlin tournament, a victory which caused a major scandal. Count Salm threw derogatory verbal abuses to his 18-old opponent Herman Wetzel, who had enough and walked off the court in the second set. The judges overruled the first decision and awarded the match to Salm, reasoning that Wetzel had voluntarily left the court. It was the second time within a year that Salm's misbehavior stirred international controversy and as a result an official ban was requested on the Austrian to deny him access to tournaments. On another occasion in 1928, while he was participating in the mixed doubles at Cannes, he drew attention when he walked off the court in outrage during a match after a ball flew in from outside, distracting him so that he lost the point. He came back when he heard <b>the</b> <b>laughter</b> of the spectators. His partner, Blanche Gladys Duddell, wife of Edward Murray Colston, 2nd Baron Roundway, was also upset by the count's actions and her husband officially protested during this interruption to ensure that the rules prevented the count from leaving the court again.|$|E
