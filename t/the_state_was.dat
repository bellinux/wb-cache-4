The rains caused flooding along streets and low-lying areas, but property generally escaped unscathed. The flooding did cause locally heavy crop damage; some farmers lost 50% of their soybean crop, and the pecan crop was damaged after earlier being affected by Hurricane Elena.

50|$|Scholars in {{international}} relations can be broken up into two different practices, realists and pluralists, of what they believe <b>the</b> ontological <b>state</b> of <b>the</b> <b>state</b> <b>is.</b> Realists believe {{that the world is}} one of only states and interstate relations and the identity of <b>the</b> <b>state</b> <b>is</b> defined before any international relations with other <b>states.</b> On <b>the</b> other hand, pluralists believe that <b>the</b> <b>state</b> <b>is</b> not <b>the</b> only actor {{in international}} relations and interactions between <b>states</b> and <b>the</b> <b>state</b> <b>is</b> competing against many other actors.|$|R
5000|$|Another {{theory of}} the {{ontology}} of <b>the</b> <b>state</b> <b>is</b> that <b>the</b> <b>state</b> <b>is</b> a spiritual or [...] "mystical entity" [...] with its own being, distinct from the members of <b>the</b> <b>state.</b> <b>The</b> German Idealist philosopher Georg Hegel (1770-1831) was perhaps the greatest proponent of this theory.
