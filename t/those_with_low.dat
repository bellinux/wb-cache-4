5|$|For {{those with}} pain {{localized}} {{to the lower}} back due to disc degeneration, fair evidence supports spinal fusion as equal to intensive physical therapy and slightly better than low-intensity nonsurgical measures. Fusion may be considered for <b>those</b> <b>with</b> <b>low</b> back pain from acquired displaced vertebra that does not improve with conservative treatment, although {{only a few of}} those who have spinal fusion experience good results. There are a number of different surgical procedures to achieve fusion, with no clear evidence of one being better than the others. Adding spinal implant devices during fusion increases the risks but provides no added improvement in pain or function.|$|E
5|$|The Giotto and Vega {{missions}} gave {{planetary scientists}} their first view of Halley's surface and structure. Like all comets, as Halley nears the Sun, its volatile compounds (<b>those</b> <b>with</b> <b>low</b> boiling points, such as water, carbon monoxide, {{carbon dioxide and}} other ices) begin to sublime from the surface of its nucleus. This causes the comet to develop a coma, or atmosphere, up to 100,000km across. Evaporation of this dirty ice releases dust particles, which travel with the gas away from the nucleus. Gas molecules in the coma absorb solar light and then re-radiate it at different wavelengths, a phenomenon known as fluorescence, whereas dust particles scatter the solar light. Both processes are responsible for making the coma visible. As a fraction of the gas molecules in the coma are ionized by the solar ultraviolet radiation, pressure from the solar wind, a stream of charged particles emitted by the Sun, pulls the coma's ions out into a long tail, which may extend more than 100millionkilometers into space. Changes in the flow of the solar wind can cause disconnection events, in which the tail completely breaks off from the nucleus.|$|E
5|$|This {{serves to}} {{increase}} {{the diversity of the}} antibody pool and impacts the antibody's antigen-binding affinity. Some point mutations will result in the production of antibodies that have a weaker interaction (low affinity) with their antigen than the original antibody, and some mutations will generate antibodies with a stronger interaction (high affinity). B cells that express high affinity antibodies on their surface will receive a strong survival signal during interactions with other cells, whereas <b>those</b> <b>with</b> <b>low</b> affinity antibodies will not, and will die by apoptosis. Thus, B cells expressing antibodies with a higher affinity for the antigen will outcompete those with weaker affinities for function and survival allowing the average affinity of antibodies to increase over time. The process of generating antibodies with increased binding affinities is called affinity maturation. Affinity maturation occurs in mature B cells after V(D)J recombination, and is dependent on help from helper T cells.|$|E

25|$|Feelings of {{depression}} {{can cause a}} child to overeat. Researchers provided an in-home interview to 9,374 adolescents, in grades seven through 12 and discovered {{that there was not}} a direct correlation with children eating in response to depression.

Antidepressants, however, seem to have very little influence on childhood obesity. Researchers provided a depression questionnaire to 487 overweight/obese subjects and found that 7% of <b>those</b> <b>with</b> <b>low</b> depression symptoms were using antidepressants and had an average BMI score of 44.3, 27% of those with moderate depression symptoms were using antidepressants and had an average BMI score of 44.7, and 31% of those with major depression symptoms were using antidepressants and had an average BMI score of 44.2.|$|E
25|$|Recent {{research}} {{reveals a}} potential taste receptor called the CD36 receptor. CD36 was targeted {{as a possible}} lipid taste receptor because it binds to fat molecules (more specifically, long-chain fatty acids), {{and it has been}} localized to taste bud cells (specifically, the circumvallate and foliate papillae). There is a debate over whether we can truly taste fats, and supporters of our ability to taste free fatty acids (FFAs) have based the argument on a few main points: there is an evolutionary advantage to oral fat detection; a potential fat receptor has been located on taste bud cells; fatty acids evoke specific responses that activate gustatory neurons, similar to other currently accepted tastes; and, there is a physiological response to the presence of oral fat. Although CD36 has been studied primarily in mice, research examining human subjects' ability to taste fats found that those with high levels of CD36 expression were more sensitive to tasting fat than were <b>those</b> <b>with</b> <b>low</b> levels of CD36 expression; this study points to a clear association between CD36 receptor quantity and the ability to taste fat.|$|E
