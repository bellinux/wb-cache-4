Spores of antagonistic micro-organisms {{present on the}} flowers can successfully compete with the possible pathogens. Honeybees and bumblebees {{can be used for}} transporting these antagonistic micro-organisms from the hive into flowers in order to prevent infections of the flowers. It is unavoidable that this antagonistic material also enters the brood nest of <b>the</b> <b>bees.</b> Since a healthy brood nest is an essential stimulant for the foraging activities of <b>the</b> <b>bees</b> and knowing that fungi and yeast may be able to cause infections of the brood, the effect of two antagonistic micro-organisms is tested on <b>the</b> honey <b>bee</b> and <b>bumble</b> <b>bee</b> brood. Eggs and larvae were contaminated and during the larval and pupal phase, samples were taken and checked for the presence these antagonistic micro-organisms. The antagonistic micro-organisms were not found in the samples and no significant changes in the broodnest were observed.

40|$|Recent {{research}} has demonstrated colony-level sublethal effects of imidacloprid on <b>bumble</b> <b>bees,</b> affecting foraging and food consumption, and thus colony growth and reproduction, at lower pesticide concentrations than for honey bee colonies.

50|$|Danish {{zoologist}} Johan Christian Fabricius first identified Apis florea in 1787. A. florea is {{a member}} of the Apis genus.

A. florea is native to southeast Asia, and therefore one of the most phylogenetically basal bees. This suggests that honeybees originated in this region, with A. florea being one of the oldest and potentially similar to ancestors; therefore its first appearance in phylogeny occurs before that of A. mellifera and A. cerena. A. mellifera most likely evolved from A. florea and then migrated to Europe. A. florea, a dwarf honeybee, is a sister species of Apis andreniformis. These sister species are the most ancient honeybee lineage, most likely diverging in the Bartonian era.|$|R

40|$|International audienceThe insect growth {{regulators}} (IGRs) are ecdysone or {{juvenile hormone}} mimics, or chitin synthesis inhibitors.

40|$|Bees provide vital {{pollination}} {{services to}} the majority of flowering plants in both natural and agricultural systems. Unfortunately, both native and managed bee populations are experiencing declines, threatening the persistence of these plants and crops. Agricultural chemicals are one possible culprit contributing to bee declines. Even fungicides, generally considered safe for bees, have been shown to disrupt honey <b>bee</b> development and impair <b>bumble</b> <b>bee</b> behavior. Little is known, however, how fungicides may affect <b>bumble</b> <b>bee</b> colony growth. We conducted a controlled cage study {{to determine the effects of}} fungicide exposure on colonies of a native <b>bumble</b> <b>bee</b> species (Bombus impatiens). Colonies of B. impatiens were exposed to flowers treated with field-relevant levels of the fungicide chlorothalonil over the course of one month. Colony success was assessed by the number and biomass of larvae, pupae, and adult <b>bumble</b> <b>bees.</b> <b>Bumble</b> <b>bee</b> colonies exposed to fungicide produced fewer workers, lower total bee biomass, and had lighter mother queens than control colonies.

40|$|Abstract Background Regulation {{of worker}} {{behavior}} by dominant queens or workers is {{a hallmark of}} insect societies, but the underlying molecular mechanisms and their evolutionary conservation are not well understood. Honey <b>bee</b> and <b>bumble</b> <b>bee</b> colonies consist of a single reproductive queen and facultatively sterile workers. The queens' influences on the workers are mediated largely via inhibition of juvenile hormone titers, which affect division of labor in honey bees and worker reproduction in <b>bumble</b> <b>bees.</b> Studies in honey bees identified a transcription factor, Krüppel-homolog 1 (Kr-h 1), whose expression in worker brains is significantly downregulated {{in the presence of}} a queen or queen pheromone and higher in forager bees, making this gene an ideal candidate for examining the evolutionary conservation of socially regulated pathways in Hymenoptera. Results In contrast to honey <b>bees,</b> <b>bumble</b> <b>bees</b> foragers do not have higher Kr-h 1 levels relative to nurses: in one of three colonies levels were similar in nurses and foragers, and in two colonies levels were higher in nurses. Similarly to honey bees, brain Kr-h 1 levels were significantly downregulated in the presence versus absence of a queen. Furthermore, in small queenless groups, Kr-h 1 levels were downregulated in subordinate workers with undeveloped ovaries relative to dominant individuals with active ovaries. Brain Kr-h 1 levels were upregulated by juvenile hormone treatment relative to a vehicle control. Finally, phylogenetic analysis indicates that KR-H 1 orthologs are presence across insect orders. Though this protein is highly conserved between honey <b>bees</b> and <b>bumble</b> <b>bees,</b> there are significant differences between orthologs of insects from different orders. Conclusions Our results suggest that Kr-h 1 is associated with juvenile hormone mediated regulation of reproduction in <b>bumble</b> <b>bees.</b> <b>The</b> expression of this transcription factor is inhibited by the queen and associated with endocrine mediated regulation of social organization in two species of bees. Thus, KR-H 1 may transcriptionally regulate a conserved genetic module that is part of a pathway that has been co-opted to function in social behavior, and adjusts the behavior of workers to their social environmental context. </p...|$|R
