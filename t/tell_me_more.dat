25|$|Grossmith {{partnered with}} Edwardes's former associate, Pat Malone, {{to produce a}} series of mostly adaptations of {{imported}} shows at the Winter Garden between 1920 and 1926: Sally (1921), The Cabaret Girl (1922, with book by Wodehouse and music by Jerome Kern), The Beauty Prize (1923, with Wodehouse and Kern), a revival of Tonight's the Night (1923), Primrose (1924, with music by George Gershwin), <b>Tell</b> <b>Me</b> <b>More</b> (1925, with words by Thompson and music by George Gershwin) and Kid Boots (1926 with music by Harry Tierney), many of them featuring Leslie Henson. Grossmith co-wrote some of the Winter Garden pieces, directed many of his own productions and starred in several, notably as Otis in Sally. Several of the later productions lost money, and Grossmith and Malone ended the partnership.|$|E

2500|$|In 1950, Fo {{asked to}} work with [...] on a variety show {{performed}} by radio actors, beginning a collaboration that would last until 1954. Fo delighted audiences with stories of his upbringing, which, [...] Parenti was very impressed by, describing them as [...] "absolutely original, with an extraordinary humour, wit and personification. When the show was over we'd go for walks round the lake and he'd <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> <b>more</b> stories. In this way we originated a project in which we would work together on {{a new type of}} revue, one which didn't copy reality, but which involved people and took a stand." ...|$|E

[...] He has given numerous radio interviews on shows such as NPR's <b>Tell</b> <b>Me</b> <b>More,</b> covering such topics as Guantanamo Bay and Supreme Court nominations. [...] Additionally, he has written opinion pieces for The Washington Post, Los Angeles Times, and USA Today, covering issues ranging from immigration to sexual predators.

2500|$|Merkerson {{made her}} {{television}} debut as Reba the Mail Lady on Pee-wee's Playhouse. [...] "It {{was one of}} those wild things where I went to audition. And I thought I was funny and the person I auditioned for didn't, and so I had blown the job and I guess weeks later they got new casting people," [...] Merkerson said on the NPR program <b>Tell</b> <b>Me</b> <b>More.</b> [...] "I didn't know who Pee-wee Herman was, so if, you know, for fans of the show, if they watch like the first episode that I ever did, I think it was a big party and he just kept making me laugh because I had never seen the character before. And the director was angry and he was like how can we get through this scene? And I said I {{have to look at the}} plate. So the entire [...] he's serving hors d'oeuvres, I'm looking at the plate, and we're still good buddies. He still, to this day, knows how to make me laugh like no one else, Paul Reubens". Merkerson has also appeared on The Cosby Show, among other series.|$|E
2500|$|The {{term was}} coined by Angular Records founder Joe Daniel and was {{featured}} on the [...] "An Angular Disco" [...] flyer used to advertise Klaxons's first gig. Klaxons later declared they were not new rave, describing it as a [...] "joke that's got out of hand" [...] and that the term was originally ironic, not serious. In reaction to the media overkill of the [...] "genre", Klaxons banned the use of glowsticks at their gigs in April 2007, saying that [...] "We kept getting asked to explain it. The whole idea of new rave {{was to take the}} piss out of the media by making them talk about something that didn't exist, just for our own amusement. And they'd say, I appreciate that, but can you <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> <b>more</b> about new rave?" [...] Los Angeles Times critic Margaret Wappler comments that the [...] "minimalist dance-punk of LCD Soundsystem, the analog classicism of Simian Mobile Disco, the fanatical electro-thrash of Justice, the international amalgam of M.I.A., the agitated funk of [...] (Chk Chk Chk) and the art-schooled disco-sleaze of Cansei de Ser Sexy" [...] contributed to the thriving 'new rave' dance scene, which led to a rediscovery of indie rockers, and a critical and intellectual revolution in dance music.|$|E
