50|$|After {{arriving}} in San Francisco without incident, the original carbon paper <b>filament</b> <b>bulbs</b> {{were replaced by}} a shipment of newer bamboo <b>filament</b> <b>bulbs,</b> sent by Edison himself. The chief engineers of Columbia sent a letter of satisfaction to Edison complimenting the superior performance of the light system, stating {{that none of the}} lights gave out after 415 hours and 45 minutes of constant use. Columbia safely arrived in Portland on August 24, 1880. Despite this, insurance companies were reluctant at first to underwrite the brand new vessel.|$|R
50|$|Lifespan of LED {{emitters}} {{is reduced}} by high operating temperatures. In {{the absence of a}} heat sink, LED <b>filament</b> <b>bulbs</b> may use a high thermal conductivity gas inside the bulb to aid heat dissipation.|$|R
25|$|LEDs are {{increasingly}} being adopted for signal functions such as parking lamps, brake lamps and turn signals as well as daytime running lamps, as in those applications they offer significant advantages over <b>filament</b> <b>bulbs</b> with fewer engineering challenges than headlamps pose.|$|R

The CHMSL (pronounced [...] ) is also {{sometimes referred to as}} the [...] "centre brake lamp", the [...] "third brake light", the [...] "eye-level brake lamp", the [...] "safety brake lamp", or the [...] "high-level brake lamp". The CHMSL may produce light by a single central <b>filament</b> <b>bulb,</b> a row or cluster of <b>filament</b> <b>bulbs</b> or LEDs, or a strip of Neon tube.|$|R
50|$|Antique <b>filament</b> light <b>bulbs,</b> Edison light bulbs, {{and vintage}} light bulbs all refer to carbon- or early tungsten-filament lamps. Most of these bulbs are reproductions {{of the wound}} <b>filament</b> <b>bulbs</b> made popular by Edison Electric Light Company {{at the turn of}} the 20th century. They are easily {{identified}} by the long and complicated windings of their internal filaments, and by the very warm-yellow glow of the light they produce (many of the bulbs emit light at a color temperature of 2200-2400K).|$|R
50|$|In 1909 the Mazda {{name was}} created for the {{tungsten}} <b>filament</b> light <b>bulb.</b> GE sold bulbs under this trademark starting in 1909. GE promoted the mark as identifying tungsten <b>filament</b> <b>bulbs</b> with predictable performance and life expectancy. GE also licensed the Mazda name, socket sizes, and tungsten filament technology to other manufacturers to establish a standard for lighting. Bulbs were soon sold by many manufacturers with the Mazda name licensed from GE, including British Thomson-Houston in the United Kingdom, Toshiba in Japan, and GE's chief competitor Westinghouse.|$|R
25|$|In 2006 {{the first}} series-production low beam, front {{position}} light and sidemarker function LED headlamps were factory-installed on the Lexus LS 600h / LS 600h L presented in 2007 for 2008 models. The high beam and turn signal functions use <b>filament</b> <b>bulbs.</b> The headlamp is supplied by Koito.|$|R
50|$|Tungsten-filament bulbs of the Mazda type were {{initially}} more costly than carbon <b>filament</b> <b>bulbs,</b> but used less electricity. Often electrical utilities would trade new lamps for consumers' burned-out bulbs. In {{at least one}} case the authority regulating energy rates required the utility to use only tungsten bulbs {{so as not to}} inflate customer's energy use.|$|R
50|$|The light {{emitting}} tubes of fluorescent lights {{are too big}} to easily be used to produce a directional beam, but they are several times as efficient as incandescent <b>filament</b> <b>bulbs</b> and are useful for area illumination. They have partly replaced fuel lanterns for camping use, but are now being replaced by more compact and potentially even more efficient LEDs.|$|R

5000|$|The modest {{success of}} the Moore tubes was among the drivers for {{developing}} better filaments for standard incandescent light <b>bulbs.</b> Tungsten <b>filament</b> <b>bulbs</b> were a sufficient improvement over carbon filaments that the Moore tubes [...] "gradually disappeared from the market, leaving only short carbon-dioxide tubes in use for color matching, in which they excelled because of their daylight color. The General Electric Company absorbed the two Moore companies and Moore's patents in 1912. Moore himself rejoined General Electric's laboratory force." ...|$|R
25|$|Various {{forms of}} {{incandescent}} light bulbs had numerous inventors; however, {{the most successful}} early bulbs were those that used a carbon filament sealed in a high vacuum. These were invented by Joseph Swan in 1878 in Britain and by Thomas Edison in 1879 in the US. Edison’s lamp was more successful than Swan’s because Edison used a thinner filament, giving it higher resistance and thus conducting much less current. Edison began commercial production of carbon <b>filament</b> <b>bulbs</b> in 1880. Swan's light began commercial production in 1881.|$|R

50|$|Outwardly, {{the units}} were {{virtually}} {{identical to the}} earlier Class 303 units built in 1960. The interiors were also very similar, although the Class 311s had fluorescent lighting (unlike the Class 303s which were fitted with tungsten <b>filament</b> <b>bulbs).</b> The larger fleet of class 303 units had been built by Pressed Steel at their factory in Linwood, Paisley. By the time the Class 311 were required, Pressed Steel no longer built railway carriages, so Cravens of Sheffield worked to the same original drawings, updated at a few points, to build the trains.|$|R
5000|$|Carbon <b>filament</b> <b>bulbs</b> {{were the}} first commercially viable {{electric}} light bulbs to hit the consumer market in 1882. [...] In 1904, a tungsten filament was shown to be more efficient and longer lasting than the carbonized bamboo filament used previously. [...] The introduction of a neutral gas to the glass envelope (or bulb) also helped to improve lifespan and brightness of the bulb. [...] To produce enough light, these lamps required the use of extremely long filaments, and remained so until {{the development of more}} efficiently wound tungsten filaments.|$|R

50|$|On 13 December 1904, Hungarian Sándor Just and Croatian Franjo Hanaman {{were granted}} Hungarian patent no. 34541 for the world's first {{tungsten}} <b>filament</b> <b>bulb</b> that lasted longer and produced brighter light than a carbon filament. The co-inventors licensed their patent to the company, {{which came to}} be named Tungsram after the eponymous tungsten incandescent bulbs, which are still called Tungsram bulbs in many European countries. In 1934, Tungsram incorporated a patent by Imre Bródy for bulbs filled with krypton gas, providing for longer bulb lifetime. During WW1 mass production of radio tubes began and became the most profitable division of the company.|$|R
50|$|The fifth {{generation}} car has {{a totally}} redesigned electrical system. Control modules {{are used for}} everything from the radio to the powertrain, transmitting over Controller Area Network (CAN) buses. Transmission of signals is done digitally at 500 kilobits per second, which reduces the number of wires needed, and thus reduces the chance for faults. Cars equipped with halogen headlamps have a 'VW' logo integrated into the bulb shield. In most of the world, the rear lights use light-emitting diodes (LEDs). However, in North America, standard <b>filament</b> <b>bulbs</b> with a different design are used, to comply with FMVSS 108.|$|R
40|$|Using high {{spatial and}} {{temporal}} resolution Hα data from the New Vacuum Solar Telescope (NVST) and simultaneous observations from the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO), we present a rare event on the interaction between <b>two</b> <b>filaments</b> (F 1 and F 2) in AR 11967 on 2014 January 31. The adjacent <b>two</b> <b>filaments</b> were almost perpendicular to each other. Their interaction was driven by the movement of F 1 and started when the <b>two</b> <b>filaments</b> collided with each other. During the interaction, the threads of F 1 continuously slipped from the northeast to the southwest, accompanied by the brightenings at the junction of <b>two</b> <b>filaments</b> and the northeast footpoint of F 2. Part of F 1 and {{the main body of}} F 2 became invisible in Hα wavelength due to the heating and the motion of F 2. At the same time, bright material initiated from the junction of <b>two</b> <b>filaments</b> were observed to move along F 1. The magnetic connectivities of F 1 were found to be changed after their interaction.
