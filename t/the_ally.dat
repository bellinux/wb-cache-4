5000|$|Another {{military}} {{battle that}} utilized the counterattack tactic was the Battle of Austerlitz on December 2, 1805. While fighting the Austrian and Russian armies, Napoleon purposely {{made it seem}} as if his men were weak from the fighting in several cases. Napoleon had his men retreat in an attempt to lure <b>the</b> <b>Allies</b> to battle. He purposely left his right flank open and vulnerable. This deceived <b>the</b> <b>Allies</b> into attacking and <b>the</b> <b>Allies</b> fell into Napoleon's trap. When <b>the</b> <b>Allied</b> troops went to attack Napoleon’s right flank, Napoleon quickly filled up the right flank so the attack was not effective.  However, on <b>the</b> <b>Allied</b> side, a large gap was left open in the middle of <b>the</b> <b>Allied</b> front line due to troops leaving to attack the French right flank. Noticing the large hole in the middle of <b>the</b> <b>Allied</b> lines, Napoleon attacked the middle and had his forces also flank around both sides, eventually surrounding <b>the</b> <b>Allies.</b> With <b>the</b> <b>Allies</b> completely surrounded, <b>the</b> battle was over. The Battle of Austerlitz was a successful counterattack because the French army defended off <b>the</b> <b>Allied</b> attack and quickly defeated <b>the</b> <b>Allies.</b> Napoleon deceived <b>the</b> <b>Allies.</b> He made his men seem weak and near defeat.|$|R

25|$|Administration {{officials}} have long accused Iran of supporting Shiite militias in attacks on American forces in Iraq.

5|$|On {{the second}} day of the battle, news reached <b>the</b> <b>Allies</b> that their lines of retreat were no longer threatened; they {{therefore}} resolved to maintain their position. They staged a hit-and-run attack on some Cilician ships, capturing and destroying them. On the third day, however, the Persian fleet attacked <b>the</b> <b>Allies</b> lines in full force. In a day of savage fighting, <b>the</b> <b>Allies</b> held on to their position, but suffered severe losses (half the Athenian fleet was damaged); nevertheless, <b>the</b> <b>Allies</b> inflicted equal losses on the Persian fleet. That evening, <b>the</b> <b>Allies</b> received news of the fate of Leonidas and <b>the</b> <b>Allies</b> at Thermopylae. Since <b>the</b> <b>Allied</b> fleet was badly damaged, and since it no longer needed to defend the flank of Thermopylae, they retreated from Artemisium to the island of Salamis.|$|R
25|$|Following <b>the</b> <b>Allied</b> {{victory in}} North Africa <b>the</b> <b>Allies</b> invaded Sicily in Operation Husky on 10 July 1943, with amphibious and {{airborne}} landings.

25|$|In 1782, Louis XVI sealed an {{alliance}} with the Maratha Peshwa Madhav Rao Narayan. As a consequence Bussy moved his troops to Ile de France (Mauritius) and later contributed to the French effort in India in 1783.

Between February 1782 until June 1783, Suffren fought the English admiral Sir Edward Hughes, and collaborated with the rulers of Mysore. An army of 3,000 French soldiers collaborated with Hyder Ali to capture Cuddalore.|$|E
25|$|In November 1942 the VII Army Corps of the Regio Esercito {{occupied}} Corsica {{as part of}} the German led {{response to}} <b>the</b> <b>Ally</b> landings in Africa, leaving the island still under the formal sovereignty of Vichy France. Because of the lack of partisan resistance at first, and to avoid problems with Marshal Philippe Pétain, no Corsican units were formed under Italian control (except for a labour battalion formed in March 1943). However, a Resistance movement based on local inhabitants loyal to France and boosted by Free French leaders developed, opposing the irredentist propaganda and the Italian occupation, and was repressed by Italian fascist forces and subsequently by German troops.|$|E

5|$|Simultaneous {{with the}} battle at Thermopylae, an Allied naval force of 271 triremes defended the Straits of Artemisium against the Persians, thus {{protecting}} the {{flank of the}} forces at Thermopylae. Here <b>the</b> <b>Allied</b> fleet held off the Persians for three days; however, on the third evening <b>the</b> <b>Allies</b> received news of the fate of Leonidas and <b>the</b> <b>Allied</b> troops at Thermopylae.

5|$|Later on that day, a deserter {{from the}} Persian fleet, a Greek called Scyllias, swam into <b>the</b> <b>Allied</b> camp. He brought {{bad news for}} <b>the</b> <b>Allies</b> — whilst most of the Persian fleet was {{undergoing}} repairs, the Persians had detached 200 seaworthy ships to sail around the outer coast of Euboea, to block the escape route of <b>the</b> <b>Allied</b> fleet. <b>The</b> Persians {{did not want to}} attack <b>the</b> <b>Allies</b> yet, because they thought <b>the</b> <b>Allies</b> would simply flee, and so they sought to trap them. <b>The</b> <b>Allies</b> resolved to go and meet this detachment, to prevent being trapped, though they planned to leave by nightfall to prevent the Persians becoming aware of their plans.|$|R

25|$|The Protestant de Heere, {{who died}} in 1584, had {{previously}} designed tapestries for Catherine de' Medici in France. In his last years, he was working in Flanders for William the Silent, {{the founder of the}} House of Orange-Nassau and <b>the</b> <b>ally</b> of Catherine de' Medici's youngest son François, Duke of Anjou. In 1582, de Heere designed the decorations for Anjou's Joyous Entry into Ghent, de Heere's home town. Between 1582, when Anjou was installed as the duke of Brabant, and his death in 1584, when he still held the town of Cambrai, the French prince opposed the forces of Alexander Farnese, Duke of Parma, governor of the Spanish Netherlands. He met with little success, however, owing to a desperate shortage of funds to pay his troops. Art historian Roy Strong has questioned Yates's finding that the tapestries were produced in Antwerp under Lucas de Heere, suggesting that they contain Brussels markings.|$|E
25|$|The Romans arrayed {{in their}} {{customary}} triple line formation with their left wing {{resting on the}} river. The Roman reinforced legions occupied {{the center of this}} formation and the Latins, <b>the</b> <b>Ally</b> legions, on their wings. In all, there were 20,000 men of the legion. Behind them, Scipio held his 16 elephants in reserve, fully aware that the North African forest elephants (now extinct) could not face the larger Indian/Syrian stock on equal terms. On the right Scipio placed the allied Pergamene army under Eumenes and the Achaean peltasts, 3,000 in all to cover the flank of the legions. Next to them he placed his cavalry, nearly 3,000 strong, 800 of them Pergamenes, the rest legionary cavalry. According to Livy, in the extreme right he posted the Trallian and Cretan horsemen, each body numbering 500 troopers, but most probably, these are the light troops and archers named by Appian to be intermingled among the cavalry. Livy also mentions 2,000 Macedonian and Thracian volunteers, who are left to guard the Roman camp. Domitius was stationed with four squadrons of cavalry on the right wing, Scipio kept command of the center and gave command of the left to Eumenes.|$|E

500|$|Furthermore, {{the late}} empire {{maintained}} a central {{feature of the}} forward defence of the Principate: a system of treaties of mutual assistance with tribes living on the imperial frontiers. The Romans would promise to defend <b>the</b> <b>ally</b> from attack by its neighbours. In return, <b>the</b> <b>ally</b> would promise to refrain from raiding imperial territory, and prevent neighbouring tribes from doing the same. Although the allies would officially be denoted tributarii (i.e. subject to paying tribute to Rome, in cash or in kind), in practice the loyalty of <b>the</b> <b>ally</b> was often secured by gifts or regular subsidies from Rome. This practice was applied on all the frontiers. The Romans continued to assist the client tribes to defend themselves in the 4th century. For example, Constantine I's army constructed two massive lines of defensive earthworks, 100–250km beyond the Danube, totalling c. [...] in length, the Devil's Dykes in Hungary/Romania and the Brazda lui Novac de Nord in Romania. Garrisoned by a mix of Roman and native troops, their purpose was to protect Dacian and Sarmatian tributary tribes of the Tisza and Wallachian plains against Gothic incursions. This created a Transdanubian buffer zone, extending from Aquincum (Budapest) {{all the way to}} the Danube delta, obviously contradicting the proposition that the empire's Danubian border provinces were themselves envisaged as buffer zones. (This was especially unlikely in the case of these regions, as the Illyrian emperors and officer class that dominated the late army would hardly relish seeing their native provinces reduced to combat zones).|$|E
