5|$|NY31A {{begins at}} a four-way {{intersection}} {{in the southern}} portion of the village of Medina. At this junction, NY31 <b>travels</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> west and to the north (eastbound), NY63 <b>travels</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> north and to the south, and NY31A <b>travels</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> east as Maple Ridge Road. It leaves the village shortly afterward, entering a rural area of Orleans County dominated by open fields. The route heads due east to Millville, a small hamlet situated at the junction of NY31A and East Shelby Road in northeastern Shelby. At {{the eastern edge of}} the community, NY31A meets West County House Road, the former routing of NY31A toward Knowlesville.|$|E

50|$|In King's Quest II: Romancing the Stones {{there is}} an impassible swamp, a tangled forest and a town that were added <b>to</b> <b>the</b> north of Kolyma to prevent too much <b>travel</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> north. More areas can be seen beyond the town but the narrator points {{out that there is}} nothing of {{interest}} for your character <b>to</b> <b>travel</b> that way. On the southern edge of Kolyma are boulders, logs and rocky outcroppings that prevent <b>travel</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> south. A mountain blocks <b>travel</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> east and <b>the</b> ocean blocks <b>travel</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> west (the player will drown if they try to swim too far). Whereas in the original there were no boundaries <b>to</b> <b>the</b> north and the south and the map would just 'wrap around'.|$|R

5|$|Deep vein {{thrombosis}}, or deep {{venous thrombosis}} (DVT), is {{the formation of a}} blood clot (thrombus) within a deep vein, most commonly the legs. Nonspecific signs may include pain, swelling, redness, warmness, and engorged superficial veins. Pulmonary embolism, a potentially life-threatening complication, is caused by the detachment (embolization) of a clot that <b>travels</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> lungs. Together, DVT and pulmonary embolism constitute a single disease process known as venous thromboembolism. Post-thrombotic syndrome, another complication, significantly contributes to the health-care cost of DVT.|$|E

5|$|NY33A {{begins at}} an {{intersection}} with NY33 {{just east of}} the village of Bergen in the town of the same name. From this point, NY33 <b>travels</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> west and to the northeast while NY33A heads east. Less {{than a quarter of a}} mile (0.4km) from its western terminus, NY33A meets Interstate490 (I-490) at exit2. In this area, I-490 straddles the border between Genesee County and Monroe County; thus, the westbound portion of the interchange is in Genesee County while the eastbound half is in Monroe County.|$|E
5|$|Nynaeve, {{under the}} {{instruction}} of Cadsuane, locates Tam al'Thor, Rand's father, who meets with Rand {{in an attempt to}} break his emotional isolation.

Rand <b>Travels</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Seanchan-held city of Ebou Dar, intending to destroy their entire army, but he becomes reluctant to act after seeing how peaceful the city is. Nearly mad with rage and grief, he <b>Travels</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> top of Dragonmount, the location where he killed himself in a past life. Angry at the futility of life bound to the Wheel, he uses the Choedan Kal to draw enough power to destroy the world. Lews Therin, a voice in Rand's head from his past life, suggests that by being reborn one has the opportunity to do things right. Agreeing, Rand turns the power of the Choedan Kal against itself, destroying it. Rand is finally able to laugh again.|$|E

Katarn leaves Jade behind as he <b>travels</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> asteroids to destroy them.|$|E
5|$|The {{method of}} Foucault replaces the {{cogwheel}} by a rotating mirror. Because the mirror keeps rotating while the light <b>travels</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> distant mirror and back, {{the light is}} reflected from the rotating mirror at a different angle on its way out than it {{is on its way}} back. From this difference in angle, the known speed of rotation and the distance to the distant mirror the speed of light may be calculated.|$|E
5|$|The {{sinoatrial node}} {{is found in}} {{the upper part of the}} right atrium near to the {{junction}} with the superior vena cava. The electrical signal generated by the sinoatrial node travels through the right atrium in a radial way that is not completely understood. It <b>travels</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> left atrium via Bachmann's bundle, such that the muscles of the left and right atria contract together. The signal then <b>travels</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> atrioventricular node. This is found at the bottom of the right atrium in the atrioventricular septum—the boundary between the right atrium and the left ventricle. The septum is part of the cardiac skeleton, tissue within the heart that the electrical signal cannot pass through, which forces the signal to pass through the atrioventricular node only. The signal then travels along the bundle of His to left and right bundle branches through to the ventricles of the heart. In the ventricles the signal is carried by specialized tissue called the Purkinje fibers which then transmit the electric charge to the heart muscle.|$|E
