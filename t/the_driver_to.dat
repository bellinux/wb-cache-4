An {{electronic device}} called the Tamar Tag can be affixed to a vehicle window, which allows <b>the</b> <b>driver</b> <b>to</b> travel at half-fare. Tolls are only payable when travelling eastbound from Saltash to Plymouth.|$|E
5|$|After 1912 thirty-one M7 {{locomotives}} were {{equipped with}} push-pull train capabilities with {{the provision of}} a primitive cable and pulley device. This was a modification {{that was designed to}} save time on country branch lines where the locomotive would usually have to run around its train {{in order to make a}} return journey. As a result, it was possible for <b>the</b> <b>driver</b> <b>to</b> drive his train from a cab located at the front of a designated push-pull coach, leaving the fireman to tend the fire and operate the injectors on the locomotive footplate.|$|E

A log book is simply a notebook with a grid pattern on every page, dividing the 24-hour day into 15-minute (1/4-hour) segments. Drivers are required to make carbon copies of each page, so one page may be kept with <b>the</b> <b>driver</b> (<b>to</b> be produced upon inspection by DOT officers), and so the other copy may be sent to the driver's employer.|$|E
5|$|Muntz {{designed}} a stereo tape player called the Autostereo for cars {{and had it}} inexpensively manufactured in Japan. The Autostereo could play a complete album without changing tracks or turning the tape over, did not suffer from skipping or premature wear as the phonograph-based players did, and its number of knobs and controls were minimized to allow <b>the</b> <b>driver</b> <b>to</b> concentrate on the road. The tape player gave customers greater control over their listening experiences, because the tapes never ran advertisements or public service announcements, unlike radio broadcasts. Muntz sold the players and cartridges from his own stores and through franchises in Florida and Texas.|$|E

His jobs are all managed by auto shop owner Shannon, who persuades Jewish mobsters Bernie Rose and Nino to {{purchase}} a car for <b>the</b> <b>Driver</b> <b>to</b> race. The Driver meets his new neighbor, Irene, and grows close to her and her young son, Benicio. Their budding relationship is interrupted when Irene's husband, Standard Gabriel, is released from prison.|$|E
5|$|A {{series of}} initial ideas were {{presented}} to the Southern Railway management by Bulleid that incorporated double-ended running, giving the locomotive driver maximum visibility in either direction without a boiler or tender obscuring his view. The need for a turntable to turn the locomotive was therefore eliminated, although the initial designs were rejected by the operating department because of problems with welding technique. The accepted design included two 0-6-0 steam bogies with weight-saving sleeve valves and chains to couple the driving axles. The boiler was offset to provide space for a communication corridor, allowing <b>the</b> <b>driver</b> <b>to</b> access both cabs without leaving the locomotive, an arrangement which led to later problems. The firebox, near {{the centre of the}} locomotive, was fed by the fireman from a third cab, linked to both driving cabs by the communication corridor. The entire ensemble was placed on a common frame and thus often referred to as an 0-6-6-0 tank engine, even though the actual notation is 0-6-0+0-6-0 since both engine units pivoted as on a Garratt, Double Fairlie or Meyer locomotive.|$|E
5|$|Modern winter service {{vehicles}} will usually {{also have a}} satellite navigation system connected to a weather forecast feed, allowing <b>the</b> <b>driver</b> <b>to</b> choose the best areas to treat and to avoid areas in which rain is likely, which can wash away the grit used—the most advanced can even adapt to changing conditions, ensuring optimal gritter and plow settings. Most run on wheels, often with snow chains or studded tires, but some are mounted on caterpillar tracks, with the tracks themselves adapted to throw the snow towards {{the side of the}} road. Off-road winter {{service vehicles}} mounted on caterpillar tracks are known as snowcats. Snowcats are commonly fitted with snowplows or snow groomers, and are used by ski resorts to smooth and maintain pistes and snowmobile runs, although they can also be used as a replacement for chairlifts.|$|E

5|$|The guide-wheel, which {{protrudes}} {{just ahead of}} the front wheels, is {{the most important part of}} the bus when travelling on the O-Bahn. It is connected directly to the steering mechanism, and steers the bus by running along the raised edge of the track. While it is not strictly necessary for drivers to hold the steering wheel when travelling on the O-Bahn because of the guide-wheel, safety procedures require <b>the</b> <b>driver</b> <b>to</b> be alert to their circumstances at all times. A rumble strip before stations is a reminder that they need to resume control. The guide-wheel is the most delicate part of the system and is designed to snap off upon sharp impact; before the O-Bahn was in place, a number of buses were fitted with guide-wheels for their ordinary routes to test their durability. Drivers were forced to be more cautious on their normal trips after numerous guide-wheel-to-kerb impacts.|$|E
5|$|One {{accident}} at the Mousetrap, a complex interchange, had national ramifications. On August 1, 1984, a truck carrying six torpedoes for the U.S. Navy overturned. The situation was made worse {{as no one}} answered at the phone number provided with the cargo, and an unknown liquid was leaking {{from one of the}} torpedoes. It took more than three hours before any military personnel arrived on the scene, U.S. Army personnel from a nearby base. The incident left thousands of cars stranded and Denver's transportation network paralyzed for about eight hours. Approximately 50 residents in the area were evacuated. Investigations later revealed that the truck driver did not follow a recommended route provided by state troopers, who specifically warned <b>the</b> <b>driver</b> <b>to</b> avoid the Mousetrap. The Navy promised reforms after being criticized for providing an unstaffed phone number with a hazardous cargo shipment, a violation of federal law, and failing to notify Denver officials about the shipment. The Mousetrap was grandfathered into the Interstate Highway system, with some structures built in 1951. The incident provided momentum to rebuild the interchange with a more modern and safer design. Construction began in several phases in 1987 and the last bridge was dedicated in 2003.|$|E
5|$|Section 1(2) of the Act {{creates an}} offence which {{includes}} {{all the elements}} of the section 1(1) offence with an additional element of intending or being reckless as to the endangering of life. The offence lies in possible effects of the defendant's actions and it is not therefore necessary to prove an actual danger to life. However, there must be a connection between the damage and the mental state of the defendant. In R v. Steer (1986), the defendant fired a gun intending to injure another person, but missed and hit a window instead; it was held that although the intention to endanger life and the fact of damage coexisted, the damage itself did not endanger life. This approach was extended in R v. Webster (1995), in which the relationship between the damage caused and the damage intended was explored. That case involved the throwing of heavy items into the paths of moving vehicles, and it was held that a defendant may be guilty if he intends to endanger life by the actual damage intended, or is reckless that life will be endangered by that damage. Therefore, although a defendant does not necessarily intend to endanger life when he intends to break a car window, ignoring the likely risk that this will cause <b>the</b> <b>driver</b> <b>to</b> swerve into the path of another vehicle, perhaps fatally, constitutes recklessness and is a sufficient causative nexus.|$|E
5|$|The {{second part}} of {{qualifying}} started problematically, as the red {{light at the end}} of the pitlane, indicating that cars had to stop, was still on when the clock began to run. A marshal with a green flag then indicated <b>the</b> <b>drivers</b> <b>to</b> take <b>to</b> <b>the</b> track. During the session, Lewis Hamilton set the fastest time, but a mistake by Nico Rosberg meant that Vettel was able to place second. Daniil Kvyat was <b>the</b> first <b>driver</b> <b>to</b> be eliminated, lining up behind <b>the</b> two McLaren <b>drivers,</b> with debutant Vandoorne out-qualifying his teammate Button. Nico Hülkenberg was <b>the</b> only <b>driver</b> <b>to</b> go out to improve his time, managing to proceed into Q3 in eighth place, leaving Grosjean, Max Verstappen and Carlos Sainz Jr. behind.|$|R

5|$|The {{report on}} the {{disaster}} indicated that it was necessary, with the signals concerned being on the right hand side of the train {{and because of the}} limited visibility from the left hand side of a steam locomotive, for either the fireman to observe those signals (but with the driver being responsible for asking him to do so) or for <b>the</b> <b>driver</b> <b>to</b> cross over the footplate from his left hand driving position to observe them from the other side. In the event, the driver did neither, and neither driver nor fireman looked out for the aspect of the signals. The report ascribed blame to the driver, but recommended that the class be fitted with wider windscreens to improve visibility, noting that, in fog with less than 80 yards' visibility, the three signals involved would not be visible at all from the driver's side of the footplate; however, it noted that, even from a Schools class locomotive with its much smaller boiler, it was unlikely that these signals could be seen from the driver's side in the dense foggy conditions of the incident. The report did not suggest that poor lifting of smoke obstructed visibility.|$|E
5|$|The {{video is}} set at night and opens with Brown, {{dressed in a black}} suit, {{drinking}} alcohol in the streets, before hailing a futuristic hover-cab. Brown asks the cab driver {{to take him to the}} best spot in town. He then asks <b>the</b> <b>driver</b> <b>to</b> turn up the air conditioner because he's hot, but the driver turns up the music instead, while wearing a horse mask on his head. As the song begins, Brown exits the cab and arrives at a street party filled with people wearing animal heads. He then enters a club, where he performs the first dance sequence in the video with his male backup dancers. During the first chorus, Brown arrives inside the main room of the club filled with flashing lights and people dancing while wearing animal heads. After a hat gets tossed to him by one of his dancers in the crowd, Brown and his backup dancers perform another dance sequence as the queen of the party watches them from her perch. These party scenes are intercut with scenes of Brown dancing alone in another room surrounded by flashing lights and speakers in the background.|$|E

25|$|Centaurus I {{featured}} {{several major}} design adjustments from both previous series of cars. Due {{to a change}} in the North American Solar Challenge rules for 2008 requiring <b>the</b> <b>driver</b> <b>to</b> sit upright, the team was faced with the task of allowing <b>the</b> <b>driver</b> <b>to</b> do this while still minimizing aerodynamic drag.
