5|$|Cells cannot {{function}} if DNA damage corrupts <b>the</b> <b>integrity</b> <b>and</b> {{accessibility of}} essential {{information in the}} genome (but cells remain superficially functional when non-essential genes are missing or damaged). Depending {{on the type of}} damage inflicted on the DNA's double helical structure, a variety of repair strategies have evolved to restore lost information. If possible, cells use the unmodified complementary strand of the DNA or the sister chromatid as a template to recover the original information. Without access to a template, cells use an error-prone recovery mechanism known as translesion synthesis as a last resort.|$|E

The third mobilisation of the army took place in September 1939 in response to the German attack on Poland; Henri Guisan was elected as the General-in-Chief.|$|E

40|$|The {{increasing}} {{complexity in}} Military Command and Control (C 2) systems {{has led to}} greater vulnerability due to system availability <b>and</b> <b>integrity</b> caused by internal vulnerabilities and external threats. Several studies have proposed measures of availability <b>and</b> <b>integrity</b> for <b>the</b> assets in the C 2 systems using precise and certain measures (i. e., {{the exact number of}} attacks on <b>the</b> availability <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>integrity,</b> <b>the</b> number of countermeasures for <b>the</b> availability <b>and</b> <b>integrity</b> attacks, <b>the</b> effectiveness of <b>the</b> availability <b>and</b> <b>integrity</b> countermeasure in eliminating the threats, and the financial impact of each attack on <b>the</b> availability <b>and</b> <b>integrity</b> of <b>the</b> assets). However, these measures are often uncertain in real-world problems. The source of uncertainty can be vagueness or ambiguity. Fuzzy logic and fuzzy sets can represent vagueness and ambi-guity by formalizing inaccuracies inherent in human decision-making.
