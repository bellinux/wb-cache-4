40|$|The mode {{of action}} of {{colloidal}} bismuth subcitrate (CBS), a colloidal bismuth preparation often used {{in the treatment of}} gastroduodenal ulcers, is unknown. The precipitation characteristics of CBS were determined by <b>titration</b> <b>with</b> <b>hydrochloric</b> <b>acid</b> and gastric juice. The precipitation pH were 4. 0 and 3. 5 respectively. Preoperative administration of CBS resulted in a preferential accumulation of bismuth in chronic gastric ulcers as determined by tissue bismuth assays. CBS and gastric glycoprotein formed an in vitro complex which markedly retarded the migration of H+. One of the mechanisms by which CBS promotes ulcer healing is through its behaviour as a diffusion barrier to hydrochloric acid. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E

5000|$|Laboratory syntheses of {{kaolinite}} at {{room temperature}} and atmospheric pressure have been described by DeKimpe et al. (1961). [...] From those tests the role of periodicity becomes convincingly clear. For DeKimpe et al. (1961) had used daily additions of alumina (as AlCl3 + 6 H2O) and silica (in the form of ethyl silicate) during at least two months. In addition adjustments of the pH took place every day by way of adding either <b>hydrochloric</b> <b>acid</b> or sodium hydroxide. Such daily additions of Si and Al to the solution in combination <b>with</b> the daily <b>titrations</b> <b>with</b> <b>hydrochloric</b> <b>acid</b> or sodium hydroxide during at least 60 days will have introduced the necessary element of periodicity. Only now the actual role {{of what has been}} described as the “aging” (Alterung) of amorphous alumino-silicates (as for example Harder, 1978 [...] had noted) can be fully understood. For time as such is not bringing about any change in a closed system at equilibrium, but a series of alternations, of periodically changing conditions (by definition taking place in an open system), will bring about the low-temperature formation of {{more and more of the}} stable phase kaolinite instead of (ill-defined) amorphous alumino-silicates.|$|R

40|$|An ideal {{preparation}} of 45 S 5 bioactive glass sus-pensions/slurries for root canal disinfection should combine high pH induction with capacity for con-tinuing release of alkaline species. The hypothesis {{of this study}} was that more material per volume of bioactive glass slurry is obtained with a micromet-ric material (< 5 µm particle size) or a micrometric/ nanometric hybrid, rather than a solely nanometric counterpart. This should correlate with alkaline capacity and antimicrobial effectiveness. Slurries at the plastic limit were prepared with test and refer-ence materials in physiological saline. Total mass and specific surface area of glass material per vol-ume were determined. Continuous <b>titration</b> <b>with</b> <b>hydrochloric</b> <b>acid</b> was performed, and antimicro-bial effectiveness was tested in extracted human premolars mono-infected with E. faecalis ATTC 29212 (N = 12 per material). While the nanometric slurry had a 12 -fold higher specific surface area than the micrometric counterpart, the latter had a considerably higher alkaline capacity and disin-fected significantly better (Fisher’s exact test, P < 0. 05).

The slow complex formation kinetics has been followed spectrophotometrically for several days on samples with different ligand molar fractions ranging from 0. 1 to 1, keeping the ligand and metal concentration below 8 x 10 (- 4) M. For the potentiometric titration, the ligand concentrations were kept constant at 10 (- 3) M, and the 0. 25, 0. 5, 0. 75 and 1. 00 metal/ligand ratios were titrated in the pH range 2. 5 - 11 for each ligand.

40|$|We {{report the}} first direct {{measurements}} of the contribution of phytoplankton and bacterial cells to the measured alkalinity of unfiltered seawater. Phytoplankton and bacterial cells suspended in seawater make {{a significant contribution to}} the measured alkalinity of unfiltered seawater; their contribution is probably next to that of borate ion in most seawater samples. This nonnegligible contribution of particulate organic matter to the measured alkalinity is due largely to the presence of negatively charged surface groups on the phytoplankton and bacterial cells that react with protons during <b>titration</b> <b>with</b> <b>hydrochloric</b> <b>acid.</b> The contribution of organic particles to the measured alkalinity of unfiltered seawater could potentially be an important factor when evaluating the accuracy of presently available carbonate thermodynamic models using at-sea carbon system parameters that include measured alkalinity. The concept of the total alkalinity of seawater has evolved in tandem with improvements in analytical techniques and in our understanding of the acid–base processes that occur in seawater (Dickson 1992). Seawater is not a simple solution containing only carbonic and boric acids; it often contains additional bases that react with protons during the titration of seawater with acid. The total alkalinity of seawater (A T) is thus defined as the number of moles of hydrogen ions equivalent to the excess of bases (proton acceptors) formed from weak acids with pK � 4. 5 at 25 �C and zero ionic strength over acids (proton donors) with pK � 4. 5 in 1 kg of seawater sample (Dickson 1981) ...|$|E

The method is based on multi-parametric curve-fitting end can also be applied to salts of dibasic acids with unknown equilibrium constants. The systematic error is not more than 1 %. The titration and cal-culation takes less than 20 min. In the potentiometric <b>titration</b> <b>with</b> <b>hydrochloric</b> <b>acid</b> of hydroxide and carbonate of concentrations less than 0. 01 M it is often impossible to deter-mine the equivalence point of hydroxide from the inflexion point or first derivative [11. The calculation of the hydroxide concentration from the equivalence-points of carbonate is not very accurate. Straightforward Gran plots are sometimes curved, while more sophisticated linearization techniques require accurate values of the equilibrium constants [2, 3]. Another method with at least comparable versatility is multiparametric curve-fitting [4 -S]. This paper describes the adaptation of the Wentworth method [9], as used earlier by Bos [S] for the titration of mixtures of a weak and a strong acid with sodium hydroxide, for the determination of hydroxide and carbonate in 2. 89 M (3. 00 m) sodium chloride solutions. Four parameters from the charge-balance equation are adjusted to obtain a centrations of hydroxide and carbonate, and both of carbonate. Theory The symbols are defined in Table 1.

40|$|PURPOSE: To {{compare the}} caries prevalence, saliva {{buffering}} capacity (SBC), oral hygiene (OH), dietary habits, family income (FI) {{and frequency of}} visits to a dental office (Do) between Brazilian children living in areas with and without fluoridated public water supply. METHODS: Forty-six 5 - 7 -year-old preschoolers were selected in Itatiba, SP, Brazil; 19 were from a fluoridated area, and 27 were from a non-fluoridated area. The caries index was determined according to the World Health Organization criteria, and the SBC was assessed by <b>titration</b> <b>with</b> <b>hydrochloric</b> <b>acid.</b> The FI, frequency of OH and visits to Do were estimated by questionnaire. The dietary habits were assessed with a diet chart. The {{differences between the groups}} were analyzed with Mann-Whitney-U tests (&# 945;= 0. 05). RESULTS: Children from the non-fluoridated area showed significantly higher dmft/DMFT than those from the fluoridated area, but they showed significantly lower SBC, OH frequency and FI. No significant differences were observed between the areas for dietary habits and visits to Do. CONCLUSION: Children from fluoridated areas showed higher salivary buffering capacity, family income and oral hygiene frequency as well as lower caries prevalence, supporting the beneficial effect of fluoride in the tap water for caries prevention. OBJETIVO: Comparar prevalência de cárie, capacidade tamponante da saliva (CTS), higiene bucal (HB), hábitos dietéticos, renda familiar (RF) e frequência de visita a consultórios odontológicos (Co) entre crianças brasileiras residentes em áreas de água de abastecimento público fluoretadas e não fluoretadas. METODOLOGIA: Quarenta e seis crianças entre 5 - 7 anos foram selecionadas em Itatiba-SP-Brasil, sendo 19 pertencentes à área fluoretada e 27 à área não fluoretada. O índice de cárie foi determinado de acordo com o critério da Organização Mundial de Saúde e a CTS foi medida por titulação com ácido clorídrico. A RF, frequência de HB e visita ao Co foram estimadas por questionário. Os hábitos dietéticos foram avaliados com diário de dieta. As diferenças entre as variáveis foram analisadas pelo teste de Mann Whitney (&# 945;= 0, 05). RESULTADOS: As crianças da área não fluoretada apresentaram significativamente maior ceod/CPOD que àquelas da área fluoretada, porém significativamente menor CTS, HB e RF. Com relação a hábitos dietéticos e visitas ao Co, não foi observada diferença significativa entre as áreas. CONCLUSÃO: As crianças da área fluoretada apresentaram maior capacidade tamponante da saliva, renda familiar e frequência de higiene bucal, assim como menor prevalência de cárie, reforçando o efeito benéfico do flúor nas águas de abastecimento para prevenir a cárie...|$|E
40|$|In this thesis, {{stepwise}} <b>titration</b> <b>with</b> <b>hydrochloric</b> <b>acid</b> {{was used}} to obtain chemical reactivities and dissolution rates of ground limestones and dolostones of varying geological backgrounds (sedimentary, metamorphic or magmatic). Two different ways of conducting the calculations were used: 1) a first order mathematical model {{was used to}} calculate extrapolated initial reactivities (and dissolution rates) at pH 4, and 2) a second order mathematical model was used to acquire integrated mean specific chemical reaction constants (and dissolution rates) at pH 5. The calculations of the reactivities and dissolution rates were based on rate of change of pH and particle size distributions of the sample powders obtained by laser diffraction. The initial dissolution rates at pH 4 were repeatedly higher than previously reported literature values, whereas the dissolution rates at pH 5 were consistent with former observations. Reactivities and dissolution rates varied substantially for dolostones, whereas for limestones and calcareous rocks, the variation can be primarily explained by relatively large sample standard deviations. A list of the dolostone samples in a decreasing order of initial reactivity at pH 4 is: 1) metamorphic dolostones with calcite/dolomite ratio higher than about 6 % 2) sedimentary dolostones without calcite 3) metamorphic dolostones with calcite/dolomite ratio lower than about 6 % The reactivities and dissolution rates were accompanied by {{a wide range of}} experimental techniques to characterise the samples, to reveal how different rocks changed during the dissolution process, and to find out which factors had an influence on their chemical reactivities. An emphasis was put on chemical and morphological changes taking place at the surfaces of the particles via X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS) and Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM). Supporting chemical information was obtained with X-Ray Fluorescence (XRF) measurements of the samples, and Inductively Coupled Plasma-Mass Spectrometry (ICP-MS) and Inductively Coupled Plasma-Optical Emission Spectrometry (ICP-OES) measurements of the solutions used in the reactivity experiments. Information on mineral (modal) compositions and their occurrence was provided by X-Ray Diffraction (XRD), Energy Dispersive X-ray analysis (EDX) and studying thin sections with a petrographic microscope. BET (Brunauer, Emmet, Teller) surface areas were determined from nitrogen physisorption data. Factors increasing chemical reactivity of dolostones and calcareous rocks were found to be sedimentary origin, higher calcite concentration and smaller quartz concentration. Also, it is assumed that finer grain size and larger BET surface areas increase the reactivity although no certain correlation was found in this thesis. Atomic concentrations did not correlate with the reactivities. Sedimentary dolostones, unlike metamorphic ones, were found to have porous surface structures after dissolution. In addition, conventional (XPS) and synchrotron based (HRXPS) X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy were used to study bonding environments on calcite and dolomite surfaces. Both samples are insulators, which is why neutralisation measures such as electron flood gun and a conductive mask were used. Surface core level shifts of 0. 7 ± 0. 1 eV for Ca 2 p spectrum of calcite and 0. 75 ± 0. 05 eV for Mg 2 p and Ca 3 s spectra of dolomite were obtained. Some satellite features of Ca 2 p, C 1 s and O 1 s spectra have been suggested to be bulk plasmons. The origin of carbide bonds was suggested to be beam assisted interaction with hydrocarbons found on the surface. The results presented in this thesis are of particular importance for choosing raw materials for wet Flue Gas Desulphurisation (FGD) and construction industry. Wet FGD benefits from high reactivity, whereas construction industry can take advantage of slow reactivity of carbonate rocks often used in the facades of fine buildings. Information on chemical bonding environments may help to create more accurate models for water-rock interactions of carbonates...|$|E
