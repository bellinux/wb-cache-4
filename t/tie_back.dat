Under new management with Owen Coyle at the helm, Bolton took the lead midway through the first half with Kevin Davies scoring a predatory strike.

500|$|With James Beattie {{unavailable}} {{for the playoffs}} following a red card in {{the final game of}} the season against Exeter City, manager Danny Wilson was faced with a selection crisis ahead of the critical games against Stevenage. [...] With only one senior striker available a patched up side contested a dour first-leg where neither team created many chances. [...] United did manage to keep a clean sheet however and took the <b>tie</b> <b>back</b> to Bramall Lane with the scores level at 0–0.|$|E
2500|$|Most priesthoods were {{reserved}} to high status, male Roman citizens, usually magistrates or ex-magistrates.

6000|$|She {{found it}} very lovely, {{and sat down on}} a cracker keg to enjoy it with a heart full of the {{innocent}} sentiment of her years. Fortunately, Dr. Alec saw her before she had time to catch cold, for coming out to <b>tie</b> <b>back</b> the door-flap of his tent for more air, he beheld the small figure perched in the moonlight.

60|$|She {{had hidden}} the packs near the tallest bunch of greasewood along the trail; {{and when she}} halted behind it she had no fear of being seen from the corrals. She got the packs. The light one was not hard to <b>tie</b> <b>back</b> of the saddle, but the large one was a very {{different}} matter. She decided to carry it in front. There was a good-sized rock near, upon which she stepped, leading Sage King alongside; and after an exceedingly trying moment she got up, holding the pack. For a wonder Sage King behaved well.|$|E

Nay, do YOU forgive ME. Give me the bonnet, and let that be done which now must be done. Give me my bonnet, or I go without it; surely I am not to be delayed by so trifling a want as that--I, who have gone for years with only a strap of deer's hide to <b>tie</b> <b>back</b> my hair. Trifle not, but give it me, or I must go bareheaded, since to stay is impossible." ...|$|E
2500|$|A Phoenix toy {{was created}} {{based on the}} first X-Men movie. Three {{different}} variants were released. The first had her with an open top, no bra, and her hair down. The second had a redesigned head with her hair <b>tied</b> <b>back,</b> and a bra painted on underneath her open top.

50|$|Suggested {{development}} of the field has been for a subsea <b>tie</b> <b>back</b> which would potentially make {{it one of the}} world's longest. The <b>tie</b> <b>back</b> would connect it to an 800-megawatt power plant to be located near Oranjemund. The field would be crucial in meeting Namibia's growing energy demand, as the country is currently facing a power crisis. The commissioning of Kudu gas and the additional power capacity of 400 MW (half of the total capacity of 800 MW is determined to benefit Namibia), the looming power shortages could be prevented.|$|E

5000|$|The Seri Wawasan Bridge is a {{longitudinally}} asymmetric cable‐stayed box-girder {{bridge with}} a inverted-Y shape concrete/steel pylon 96m high. The main span, 165m long, {{is supported by}} 30 pairs of forward stay cables, anchored on the 75° forward‐inclined pylon and on the outer edges of the bridge deck, arranged in a fan shape pattern from the side elevation. To counter balance these front stays, a combination of 21 pairs of cable backstays and structural steel <b>tie</b> <b>back</b> was used. The back stay anchored at the (next-) highest point of the pylon is anchored at the curved backstay anchorage point (next-) nearest to the pylon, creating a crisscross‐over pattern from the side elevation, which adds to the aesthetic of the bridge. The overall complexity of the back stay <b>tie</b> <b>back</b> structure, however, may be aesthetically distracting. [...] The inclined concrete pylon and the backstays are anchored into bore piled foundation off the roadway in precinct 8.|$|E
