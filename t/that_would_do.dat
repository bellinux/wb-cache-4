Popularity of the breed peaked in the 1920s, however, and after World War II, {{population}} numbers declined as farmers began to favour pig breeds <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>do</b> well in intensive indoor farming. The breed association was merged with the National Pig Breeders Association (later the British Pig Association) in 1949.|$|E
5|$|By 1880 {{the railway}} had six {{locomotives}} at its disposal. No. 1–2 were Class 14 that were intended as helping {{power to get}} trains up the steep climb from Gudå to Storlien. No. 3–6 were Class 9 locomotives <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>do</b> the main haulage from Gudå into Trondheim. In 1883, NSB's other two Class 14 locomotives were transferred from the Smaalenene Line. The initial fleet consisted of 24 passenger and nine breaking cars, all from Skabo. The line featured the first bogie cars in the country, with a single entrance {{at the end of}} each car, instead of individual doors for each compartment. There were also 37 closed freight cars, 40 lumber cars, 20 boxcars, 100 flatcars and three milk cars. At first all trains were mixed freight and passenger.|$|E

Minimum pressure lowered to , and the maximum winds increased to 100mph, Category2 on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale. The storm quickly reached Category3, a major hurricane, and soon after, Category4. As it did so, its eye became ragged, while its lateral {{movement to the}} northwest rose to 17mph around the southern periphery of a strong deep-layer ridge over the United States. By September 1, the hurricane reached its peak intensity of 160mph (260km/h) and a minimum pressure of 921mb (hPa). It had reached Category5, the second of three such powerful storms <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>do</b> so during the season.|$|E

25|$|In {{the early}} days of the {{computer}} industry, programming was done in assembly language or machine code, which encouraged powerful and easy-to-use instructions. CPU designers therefore tried to make instructions <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>do</b> as much work as feasible. With the advent of higher level languages, computer architects also started to create dedicated instructions to directly implement certain central mechanisms of such languages. Another general goal was to provide every possible addressing mode for every instruction, known as orthogonality, to ease compiler implementation. Arithmetic operations could therefore often have results as well as operands directly in memory (in addition to register or immediate).|$|E
25|$|As {{early as}} 1897, the {{railroad}} had {{been interested in}} alternatives to steam power, namely, internal-combustion engines. The railroad's shops in Aurora had built an unreliable three-horsepower distillate motor in that year, but it was hugely impractical (requiring a massive 6,000-pound flywheel) and had issues with overheating (even with the best metals of the day, its cylinder heads and liners would warp and melt {{in a matter of}} minutes) and was therefore impractical. Diesel engines of that era were obese, stationary monsters and were best suited for low-speed, continuous operation. None of <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>do</b> in a railroad locomotive; however, there was no diesel engine suitable for that purpose then.|$|E

In 1998, President Bill Clinton signed one into law making baseball's employment practices subject to antitrust law, a largely moot point since by then free agency was well established (minor league players, however, remain bound to their parent clubs). Flood himself was remembered as much for this case as for his playing career {{when he died in}} 1997.

[...] Woolfolk's best {{game as a}} Wolverine was the October 10, 1981 contest against Michigan State. The Wolverines beat the Spartans, 38-20, and Woolfolk rushed for 253 yards in 39 carries. After the game, Coach Bo Schembechler said: [...] "I wondered what a kid like <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>do</b> if he ran {{as much as the}} guy on the West Coast (Marcus Allen). I didn't plan on this, but he proved he can do it. Butch is going to be our all-time leading ground gainer. There isn't any way they're going to stop him now. And so be it."

Larry Flick of Billboard magazine said that [...] "they are surprisingly adept at weaving warm and romantic imagery over a sweet melody" [...] adding that [...] " [...] will delight in the track's arrangement of soft harmonies and delicate acoustic guitar riffs".

He felt that the inclusion of paranormal elements to the story did nothing to make the narrative less convincing, and observes Hergé's recurring depiction of his character's disturbing dreams. Farr opined that the Inca costumes were drawn with [...] "a care and flamboyance <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>do</b> great credit to a major opera house production", while the Andean landscapes were [...] "worthy of a Cecil B.

Hergé biographer Benoît Peeters noted that Prisoner of the Sun was one of the Adventures to have [...] "most caught the imagination", something that he attributed to its [...] "exceptional setting or the strength of the plot".|$|E
500|$|Sumner next {{served under}} General Nathanael Greene, {{who arrived in}} the {{southern}} theater in December 1780 and directed Sumner to recruit further Continental soldiers from North Carolina. [...] On June 2, 1781, Greene ordered Sumner {{to join him in}} South Carolina, which he did along with 350 new recruits on August 1. [...] Despite the passage of a draft law in North Carolina, the number of men under his command fluctuated from day to day because of both temporary and permanent desertions. [...] These desertions eventually elicited his personal apology to Greene, as Sumner felt unable to control the ebb of soldiers in camp. [...] On September 8, his regiments were positioned on the right flank of the Continental Army at the Battle of Eutaw Springs, where his units served a vital role in halting several British assaults. Greene commented on the North Carolinians' actions at Eutaw Springs, stating that they [...] "fought with a degree of obstinacy <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>do</b> honor to the best of veterans".|$|E

Once he took his seat in December 1863, Garfield was frustrated that Lincoln seemed reluctant to press the South hard. Many radicals, led in the House by Pennsylvania's Thaddeus Stevens, wanted rebel-owned lands confiscated, but Lincoln threatened to veto any bill <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>do</b> that on a widespread basis. Garfield, in debate on the House floor, supported such legislation and, discussing England's Glorious Revolution, hinted that Lincoln might be thrown out of office for resisting the bills.

500|$|An {{encounter}} with the work and ideas of photographic pioneer Eadweard Muybridge appears to have spurred Edison to pursue {{the development of a}} motion picture system. On February 25, 1888, in Orange, New Jersey, Muybridge gave a lecture that may have included a demonstration of his zoopraxiscope, a device that projected sequential images drawn around the edge of a glass disc, producing the illusion of motion. The Edison facility was very close by, and the lecture was possibly attended by both Edison and his company's official photographer, William Dickson. Two days later, Muybridge and Edison met at Edison's laboratory in West Orange; Muybridge later described how he proposed a collaboration to join his device with the Edison phonograph—a combination system that would play sound and images concurrently. No such collaboration was undertaken, but in October 1888, Edison filed a preliminary claim, known as a caveat, with the U.S. Patent Office announcing his plans to create a device <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>do</b> [...] "for the Eye what the phonograph does for the Ear". It is clear that it was intended as part of a complete audiovisual system: [...] "we may see & hear a whole Opera as perfectly as if actually present". In March 1889, a second caveat was filed, in which the proposed motion picture device was given a name, Kinetoscope, derived from the Greek roots [...] ("movement") and [...] ("to view").|$|E
