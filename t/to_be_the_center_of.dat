5|$|Head {{injury is}} present in ancient myths that may date back before {{recorded}} history. Skulls found in battleground graves with holes drilled over fracture lines suggest that trepanation {{may have been used}} to treat TBI in ancient times. Ancient Mesopotamians knew of head injury and some of its effects, including seizures, paralysis, and loss of sight, hearing or speech. The Edwin Smith Papyrus, written around 1650–1550BC, describes various head injuries and symptoms and classifies them based on their presentation and tractability. Ancient Greek physicians including Hippocrates understood the brain <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>center</b> <b>of</b> thought, probably due to their experience with head trauma.|$|E
5|$|In early 1928, Chaplin {{began writing}} the script with Harry Carr. The plot {{gradually}} grew from an initial concept Chaplin had considered after {{the success of}} The Circus, where a circus clown goes blind and has to conceal his handicap from his young daughter by pretending that his inability to see are pratfalls. This inspired the Blind Girl. The first scenes Chaplin thought up were of the ending, where the newly cured blind girl sees the Little Tramp for the first time.

5|$|Before {{tools such}} as the {{telescope}} were invented, early study of the stars was conducted using the naked eye. As civilizations developed, most notably in Mesopotamia, Greece, Persia, India, China, Egypt, and Central America, astronomical observatories were assembled, and ideas {{on the nature of}} the Universe began to be explored. Most of early astronomy actually consisted of mapping the positions of the stars and planets, a science now referred to as astrometry. From these observations, early ideas about the motions of the planets were formed, and the nature of the Sun, Moon and the Earth in the Universe were explored philosophically. The Earth was believed <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>center</b> <b>of</b> the Universe with the Sun, the Moon and the stars rotating around it. This is known as the geocentric model of the Universe, or the Ptolemaic system, named after Ptolemy.|$|E

5|$|Scientific {{investigation}} {{has resulted in}} several culturally transformative shifts in people's view of the planet. In the West, belief in a flat Earth was displaced {{by the idea of}} spherical Earth, credited to Pythagoras in the 6th century BC. Earth was further believed <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>center</b> <b>of</b> the universe until the 16th century when scientists first theorized that it was a moving object, comparable to the other planets in the Solar System. Due to the efforts of influential Christian scholars and clerics such as James Ussher, who sought to determine the age of Earth through analysis of genealogies in Scripture, Westerners before the 19th century generally believed Earth to be a few thousand years old at most. It was only during the 19th century that geologists realized Earth's age was at least many millions of years.|$|E

25|$|Comprehension is {{severely}} affected {{in patients with}} Wernicke’s aphasia. Wernicke’s area has been thought <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>center</b> <b>of</b> language processing, specifically processing of meaning. While patients are still left with some comprehension, they {{are not able to}} repeat a sentence spoken to them or participate in an action requested by another speaker. A case study done by Ellis et al. discussed a patient who underwent several types of testing, one of which was a word-picture test. The conclusion of the test showed that while the patient understood what the image was, he had trouble retrieving the word and understanding the instructions. This case study suggests that it is language comprehension that is affected in Wernicke's aphasia and not a drop in intelligence.|$|E
25|$|The Catholicon – On {{the east}} side {{opposite}} the Rotunda is the Crusader structure housing the main altar of the Church, today the Greek Orthodox catholicon.

Since 1996 this dome is topped by the monumental Golgotha Crucifix which the Greek Patriarch Diodoros I of Jerusalem consecrated. It was at the initiative of Gustav Kühnel to erect a new crucifix at the Church of the Holy Sepulchre in Jerusalem that would not only be worthy of the singularity of the site, but that would also become a symbol of the efforts of unity in the community of Christian faith.|$|E
25|$|Johnson {{said in his}} {{autobiography}} that he pleaded with NACA to do model tests in its wind tunnel. They already had experience of models thrashing around violently at speeds approaching those requested {{and did not want}} to risk damaging their tunnel. Gen. Arnold, head of Army Air Forces, ordered them to run the tests, which were done up to Mach 0.74. The P-38's dive problem was revealed <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>center</b> <b>of</b> pressure moving back toward the tail when in high-speed airflow. The solution was to change the geometry of the wing's lower surface when diving in order to keep lift within bounds of the top of the wing. In February 1943, quick-acting dive flaps were tried and proven by Lockheed test pilots. The dive flaps were installed outboard of the engine nacelles, and in action they extended downward 35° in 1.5 seconds. The flaps did not act as a speed brake; they affected the pressure distribution in a way that retained the wing's lift.|$|E
40|$|We {{present the}} {{necessary}} and sufficient {{conditions for a}} curve <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>center</b> curve of an analytic and flat embedding of the Mobius strip (or an orientable cylinder) into euclidean 3 -space. Using these conditions we extend an example by G. Schwarz into a continuous family of analytic and flat Mobius strips. This family is split into two connected components. We give a topological argument that explains this behaviour. 1 Introduction The works [5] and [6] of G. Schwarz focus on flat and analytic embeddings of the Mobius strip into euclidean 3 -space. The article [6] presents an analytic, algebraic, and flat embedding of the Mobius strip into euclidean 3 -space. Through an analysis of his construction we have found necessary and sufficient conditions for a curve <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>center</b> curve of an analytic and flat embedding of the Mobius strip (or the orientable cylinder) into euclidean 3 -space. By a Mobius strip respectively an orientable cylinder we mean a geometric object obtained as follo [...] ...|$|R

25|$|As day broke, the Tigris Corps {{found itself}} {{advancing}} through a heavy fog. On left bank, Younghusband's brigades began their {{advance in the}} mid-morning. Approximately two hours into the advance, the brigades paused in their movements to break for lunch. At midday, the fog began to clear and turn into an unseasonably hot day. As the British and Indian battalions were cooking their food, the Ottoman forces launched a spoiling attack. Even though it was driven back, the left bank Tigris Corps' attack on the left bank was further delayed. Eventually, Younghusband's troops reached their positions and launched their attack. However, the objectives of their attack turned out <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>center</b> <b>of</b> the left bank defenses. Through {{the rest of the}} afternoon, Younghusband's brigades failed to make much headway against the Ottoman defenders. With no cover on the ground, the assault battalions came under fire at long range from rifle, machinegun, and artillery. Few units made it closer than 300 yards before having to dig in for some cover.|$|E

In a 1996 The Washington Post gig review, Mark Jenkins wrote that Stereolab started out favoring an [...] "easy-listening syncopation", but eventually reverted to a [...] "messier, more urgent sound" [...] characteristic of their earlier performances. In another review Jenkins said that the band's live songs [...] "frequently veer into more cacophonous, guitar-dominated territory", in contrast to lighter albums like Cobra and Phases Group.... In the Minneapolis Star Tribune Jon Bream compared the band's live sound to feedback-driven rock bands like The Velvet Underground, Sonic Youth and My Bloody Valentine. Several critics have said that Stereolab lacked stage presence, arguing that Sadier's vocal delivery was too subdued and that the band tended to play instead of perform its music.
