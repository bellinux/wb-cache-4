In a 1995 interview, he discussed the influence that musician Prince had on his approach to recording the album, stating [...] "I was {{one of those guys who}} read the album credits and I realized that Prince was a true artist. He wrote, produced, and performed, and that's <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> to do it." [...] For the album, D'Angelo and the production personnel utilized antiquated, vintage equipment, including Wurlitzer musical instruments and dated effects boxes, as well as modern electronic devices such as drum machines and computers. Notable instruments used by D'Angelo were the Fender Rhodes electric piano and the Hammond organ. The album was later mastered by engineer Herb Powers Jr. at The Hit Factory mastering studio in New York City.|$|E

Jonas Åkerlund directed both daytime and nighttime versions for the song, which featured different colors and styles. The daytime video leaked onto the Internet on September 17, 2010, before it was given an official release. In a press statement given by Rihanna, the singer revealed how she was exited to work with Doritos on the project, saying: [...] "I'm really excited about 'Who's That Chick?' and {{wanted to find a}} fresh and unique way to share it with my fans... When I saw how cool the augmented reality performance Doritos created was, I knew this was it.

His decision of making a sequel was explained by him in an interview: [...] "I am wary of sequels having to be made. With Don 2 I could finally make an action thriller <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> to. Good story, classic action and simple plot which has one goal and work towards it effectively and dramatically." [...] The film was a major success in India {{and went on to}} become the year's highest-grossing Bollywood production abroad with a worldwide gross of 210 crore. It received mixed to positive reviews from critics, with Khalid Mohammed stating: [...] "Throughout, you can’t help feeling that Farhan Akhtar could have made three far more valuable films out of the budget squandered on this thriller where cars are smashed as if they were tea cups." ...|$|E

From the beginning, Eleanor had a contentious relationship with her controlling mother-in-law. The townhouse that Sara gave to Eleanor and Franklin was connected to her own residence by sliding doors, and Sara ran both households in the decade after the marriage. Early on, Eleanor had a breakdown in which she explained to Franklin that [...] "I did not like to live in a house which was not in any way mine, one that I had done nothing about and which did not represent <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> to live", but little changed. Sara also sought to control the raising of her grandchildren, and Eleanor reflected later that [...] "Franklin's children were more my mother-in-law's children than they were mine".

500|$|Weingartner said he {{received}} an offer large enough that [...] "I {{would not have to}} work {{for the rest of my}} life" [...] from an American studio but refused it, opting to produce the film with his own studio, y3film, and coop99, an Austrian studio. A low-budget film, it was funded by a €250,000 loan Weingartner obtained with his parents' house as collateral. His second feature film, The Edukators was shot with hand-held digital cameras, allowing the director [...] "to explore the space and give actors license to go wherever they wanted." [...] Weingartner wanted a technically simple film focused on the actors. His decision to have a low budget was measured: [...] "More money means more pressure. This way, I used a limited crew and was able to set the shooting schedule <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> it - usually. The huge advantage of this kind of film-making is that it's rapid." [...] Most of the film was shot in Berlin, except for scenes in the Austrian Alps.|$|E
500|$|The novel {{presents}} Eli as an androgynous boy, castrated {{centuries before}} by a sadistic vampire nobleman. The film handles {{the issue of}} Eli's gender more ambiguously: a brief scene in which Eli changes into a dress offers {{a glimpse of a}} suggestive scar but no explicit elaboration. When Oskar asks Eli to become his girlfriend, Eli tries to tell Oskar [...] "I'm not a girl". An actress plays Eli's character, but her voice was considered to be too high pitched, so it was dubbed by voice actress Elif Ceylan. According to an interview with the director, as the film was originally conceived, flashbacks explained this aspect in more detail, but these scenes were eventually cut. In the end, Ajvide Lindqvist was satisfied with the adaptation. When Alfredson showed him eight minutes of footage for the first time, he [...] "started to cry because it was so damn beautiful". He subsequently described the film as a [...] "masterpiece". [...] "It doesn't really matter that [...] didn't want to do it <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> it in every respect. He could obviously never do that. The film is his creative process", he said.|$|E

500|$|The band {{recorded}} {{their debut}} album, Unknown Pleasures in April 1979 at Strawberry Studios, Stockport. Producer Martin Hannett significantly altered their live sound, {{a fact that}} greatly displeased the band at the time. Hook said in 2006 that the album [...] "definitely didn't turn out sounding <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> it But now I can see that Martin {{did a good job}} on it There's no two ways about it, Martin Hannett created the Joy Division sound". The album cover was designed by Peter Saville, who would go on to provide artwork for future Joy Division releases. Unknown Pleasures was released in June and sold through its initial pressing of 10,000 copies. Tony Wilson said that the relative success of the album turned the indie label into a true business and a [...] "revolutionary force" [...] that operated outside of the major record label system. Reviewing the album for Melody Maker, writer Jon Savage described the album as an [...] "opaque manifesto" [...] and declared [...] "eaving the twentieth century is difficult; most people prefer to go back and nostalgise. Oh boy. Joy Division at least set a course in the present with contrails for the future—perhaps you can't ask for much more. Indeed, Unknown Pleasures may very well be one of the best, white, English, debut LPs of the year".|$|E
500|$|The 2006–07 {{season was}} the year Nowitzki was named the league's Most Valuable Player. He shot a career-best 50.2% from the field, and {{recorded}} averages of 24.6 points, 8.9 rebounds, and 3.4 assists and led the Mavericks to a franchise-high 67 wins, which meant Dallas earned the first seed of the 2007 NBA Playoffs. He averaged 50% from the field, 40% for three pointers, and 90% from the free throw line becoming, at the time, only the fourth player in NBA history to join the 50–40–90 club. Nowitzki was touted as the overwhelming favorite for the Most Valuable Player award, and was expected to lead the Mavericks to an easy win against the eighth-seed Golden State Warriors, despite the Warriors having won all three regular-season meetings against Dallas. However, the Mavericks ended up losing to the Warriors in six games, marking {{the first time a}} #8 seed had beaten the #1 in a best-of-seven series in NBA history. In the clinching Game 6, Nowitzki shot just 2–13 from the field for only eight points. Defended by Stephen Jackson, Nowitzki averaged nearly five points less than his regular-season average in that series and shot 38.3% from the field as compared to 50.2% during the regular season. He described that loss as a low point in his career: [...] "This series, I couldn't put my stamp on it <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> to. That's why I'm very disappointed." [...] In spite of this historic playoffs loss, Nowitzki was named the NBA's regular-season Most Valuable Player and beat his friend and back-to-back NBA MVP Nash with more than 100 votes. He also became the first European player in NBA history to receive the honor.|$|E

[...] Schoolboy Q further commented on the album as he {{compared}} it to past releases including 2012's Habits & Contradictions and his independent debut, Setbacks. The rapper stated that the major difference between the three projects is that he wasn't forced to compromise on Oxymoron: [...] "It's me. This album is really me. It's my life.
