5|$|Berry {{first saw}} {{baseball}} player David Justice on TV playing in an MTV celebrity baseball game in February 1992. When {{a reporter from}} Justice's hometown of Cincinnati told her that Justice was a fan, Berry gave her phone number to the reporter to give to Justice. Berry married Justice shortly after midnight on January 1, 1993. Following their separation in February 1996, Berry stated publicly <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>so</b> depressed that she considered taking her own life. Berry and Justice were officially divorced on June 24, 1997.|$|E
25|$|Anglo-Belgian {{control of}} Lake Tanganyika was secured by mid-1916, though {{the war in}} Africa dragged on for another two years. Most of {{the men of the}} naval {{expedition}} returned to Britain, where Spicer-Simson was awarded the Distinguished Service Order but was reprimanded for some of his antagonistic behaviour toward his Belgian allies and was not given another command. The Belgians for their part appointed him a Commander of the Order of the Crown, and awarded him the Croix de guerre. The exploits on Lake Tanganyika caught the public imagination, and were adapted by C. S. Forester for his book The African Queen, later made into the film The African Queen, directed by John Huston. A British naval force features in the book, consisting of two motor boats named HMS Amelia and HMS Matilda. The legacy of the Battle for Lake Tanganyika also continues in the survival of Spicer-Simson′s nemesis, Graf von Götzen. She was raised by the Belgians and towed to Kigoma, but sank at her moorings in a storm. She was raised again by the British in 1921 under their mandate for Tanganyika, where it was found <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>so</b> well preserved by the greasing, that little work needed to be done to repair her. She returned to service on 16 May 1927 under the name Liemba, and still sails Lake Tanganyika.|$|E
500|$|Kelly {{asserted}} that Valiente [...] "deserves credit for having helped transform the Craft {{from being the}} hobby {{of a handful of}} eccentric Brits into being an international religious movement". Describing her as [...] "a major personality in the development" [...] of Wicca, Hutton also expressed the view that [...] "her enduring greatness lay in the very fact <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>so</b> completely and strong-mindedly dedicated to finding and declaring her own truth, {{in a world in which}} the signposts to it were themselves in a state of almost complete confusion".|$|E

6000|$|... "Why, what they're {{all talking}} about. <b>That</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> <b>so</b> awfully radiant. <b>That</b> <b>she's</b> so tremendously happy. It's the question," [...] he explained, [...] "of {{what in the}} world she has to make her so." ...|$|R
500|$|Lady Dalhousie died {{suddenly}} on 22 January 1839 {{in the home}} of Dean Ramsay aged 52. One report mentions <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>so</b> dedicated to her studies that she died with a list of plants in her hand. The collection {{that she and her husband}} had made was sold in 1985; parts went to the Nova Scotia Museum, the National Gallery of Canada, the Library and Archives Canada and the Provincial Archives of New Brunswick. Three hundred plant specimens collected by the Countess of Dalhousie at Sorel between 1826 and 1828 are maintained in the herbarium (HAM) at Royal Botanical Gardens (Ontario).|$|E
500|$|Francesco Sisci, Asia {{editor of}} La Stampa, {{supported}} {{the possibility that}} the self-immolators were Falun Gong practitioners, writing in the Asia Times that [...] "no one believed that the government could have paid a mother to torch herself and her daughter, or <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>so</b> loyal to the Communist Party that she pretended to be a Falungong member and kill herself and her only daughter, even if Falungong master Li Hongzhi forbade suicide..." [...] In Sisci's view, Chinese officials made a mistake by arresting foreign journalists on Tiananmen —"independently filmed news footage of the proceedings could have been the best proof of Falungong madness. Instead, when the government reported the episode, it looked like propaganda." ...|$|E
500|$|Those who {{adopted a}} more {{negative}} {{view at the}} time of the film's release came mostly from the classical music community. Many took fault with Stokowski's rearrangements and abridgements of the music. Igor Stravinsky, the only living composer whose music was featured in the film, expressed displeasure at how in Stokowski's arrangement of The Rite of Spring, [...] "the order of the pieces had been shuffled, and the most difficult of them eliminated", and criticized the orchestra's performance, observing that the simplification of the score [...] "did not save the musical performance, which was execrable". Other composers and music critics leveled criticism at the premise of the film itself, arguing that presenting classical music with visual images would rob the musical pieces of their integrity. Composer and music critic Virgil Thomson praised Fantasound which he thought offered [...] "good transmission of music", but disliked the [...] "musical taste" [...] of Stokowski, with exception to The Sorcerer's Apprentice and The Rite of Spring. Olin Downes of The New York Times too hailed the quality of sound that Fantasound presented, but said, [...] "much of Fantasia distracted from or directly injured the scores". Film critic Pauline Kael dismissed parts of Fantasia as [...] "grotesquely kitschy". Some parents resisted paying the higher roadshow prices for their children, and several complained that the Night on Bald Mountain segment had frightened them. There were also a few negative reactions that were more political in nature, especially since the film's release happened at a time when Nazi Germany reigned supreme in Europe. One review of the film in this manner, written by Dorothy Thompson for The New York Herald Tribune on November 25, 1940, was especially harsh. Thompson claimed that she [...] "left the theater in a condition bordering on nervous breakdown", because the film was a [...] "remarkable nightmare". Thompson went on to compare the film to rampant Nazism, which she described as [...] "the abuse of power" [...] and [...] "the perverted betrayal of the best instincts". Thompson also claimed that the film depicted nature as being [...] "titanic" [...] while man was only [...] "a moving lichen on the stone of time". She concluded that the film was [...] "cruel", [...] "brutal and brutalizing", and a negative [...] "caricature of the Decline of the West". In fact, Thompson claimed <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>so</b> distraught by the film that she even walked out of it before she saw the two last segments, Night on Bald Mountain and Ave Maria, because she did not want to be subject to any more of the film's [...] "brutalization".|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, yes," [...] {{said the}} bishop. [...] "I think <b>she</b> <b>is</b> happy in these matters. I do flatter myself <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> <b>so.</b> Of course, Miss Dunstable, you are {{accustomed}} to things on a much grander scale." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I haven't {{the least}} idea; I {{am not in}} secret {{correspondence}} with him!" [...] And Mrs. Penniman wished indeed <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>were,</b> <b>so</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> might let him know how Catherine abused her, after all she had done.|$|R
6000|$|... "I wish to die {{at peace}} with you and all the world. I am {{innocent}} in word, in thought. I shall not insult another person by saying <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> <b>so.</b> If you believe me, give me your hand." ...|$|R
2500|$|On 7 March 1816, Cockatrice, Kirkpatrick, master, from Gorée to Liverpool, {{put into}} Lisbon {{in a very}} leaky state. After a survey, the {{surveyors}} reported <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>so</b> [...] "strained and shaken" [...] as to be unworthy of repair.|$|E
2500|$|During 2006 {{and early}} 2007, Greig played Beatrice {{in a much}} {{acclaimed}} production of Much Ado About Nothing for which she won a Laurence Olivier Award, and Constance in King John, {{as part of the}} Royal Shakespeare Company's The Complete Works season. Whilst the win itself was a surprise, her acceptance speech was received very well as being highly entertaining, claiming <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>so</b> excited that she had wet her dress. The speech was apparently completely improvised. Backstage, when told not to tell her mother about her wetting her dress, she told the host that her mum was dead before dedicating her award to her [...] "dead mum". She also won the Critics' Circle Theatre Award for [...] "Best Shakespearean Performance" [...] in Much Ado About Nothing, becoming the first woman to win the award, and was nominated for [...] "The FRANCO'S Best Actress in a Play" [...] in the Whatsonstage Theatregoers' Choice Awards.|$|E
2500|$|Upon {{their arrival}} at Elstree Studios, Wendy Carlos and Rachel Elkind were shown {{the first version}} of the film by Kubrick: [...] "The film was a little on the long side. There were great gobs of scenes that never made it to the film. There was a whole strange and mystical scene in which Jack Nicholson discovers objects that have been {{arranged}} in his working space in the ballroom with arrows and things. He walks down and thinks he hears a voice and a ghost throws a ball back to him. None of that made it to the final film. We scored a lot of those. We didn't know what was going to be used for sure". Carlos has said <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>so</b> disillusioned by Kubrick's actions that she vowed never to work with him again. Her own music was released in its near entirety in 2005 as part of her Rediscovering Lost Scores compilation.|$|E

6000|$|... "No. As I told you, I {{had only}} just {{discovered}} <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>so,</b> when I heard a footstep in the distance. But I shall see her again, tomorrow or next day." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "She {{might have}} left it in Baslehurst if she liked," [...] said Rachel, [...] "or I would have carried it for her {{as far as the}} bridge, only <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>so</b> angry with me when she went." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "One of the reasons," [...] he said, [...] "why I {{would have}} {{preferred}} to come with Mrs. Munger <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> <b>so</b> heart and soul with mo in my little scheme.

60|$|On {{the next}} day Captain Scarborough came, {{according}} to his promise, but nothing that he could say would induce Florence to come into his presence. Her mother declared <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>so</b> ill {{that it would be}} wicked to disturb her.|$|E

6000|$|Clara as {{she spoke}} had {{come up to the}} bank, and now looked wistfully down at the stepping-stones. She had crossed them scores of times, {{sometimes}} with her brother, and often by herself. Why was it <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>so</b> anxious to cross them now? ...|$|E

60|$|Now <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>so</b> near, {{he was as}} if {{turned to}} stone. The wild longing was still in him to clasp her in his arms, to hold her closely, tenderly to his heart, yet {{he would not have}} touched her for a kingdom.|$|E
60|$|Whether or no {{the husband}} was in earnest, it might clearly be judged, from the wife's face and tone, <b>that</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>so.</b> On the next morning, George {{went up to}} London, and the two women were left alone in their dull house at Hadley.|$|E
