5|$|Early fur {{traders and}} explorers noted {{regional}} trading centers, and archaeological evidence has shown {{some to be}} of considerable antiquity. One such trading center in the Weiser area existed as early as 4,500 years ago. The Fremont culture may have contributed <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>historic</b> Shoshones, {{but it is not}} well understood. Another poorly understood early cultural component is called the Midvale Complex. The introduction of the horse to the Snake River Plain around 1700 helped in establishing the Shoshone and Northern Paiute cultures.|$|E
5|$|Green Archaeoastronomy {{is named}} after {{the cover of the}} book Archaeoastronomy in the Old World.

The basic methods were developed by Alexander Thom during his extensive surveys of British megalithic sites.|$|E

5|$|However, {{there were}} exceptions; in the 7th century a Merovingian kingdom still {{retained}} {{at least one}} active Roman horse breeding centre. The Spanish also retained many quality horses, in part due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>historic</b> reputation of {{the region as a}} horse-breeding land, and partially due to the cultural influences related to the Islamic conquest of the Iberian peninsula between the 8th and 15th centuries.|$|E
5|$|In 1935, {{the palace}} {{including}} the entire estate {{was purchased by}} the City of Braunschweig.

Originally built as the Tremont Opera House in 1870, the structure was extensively renovated to serve various functions, from offices and stores to the National Hotel.

5|$|After a {{slow start}} <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>historic</b> campaign, Loxton struck form midway through the English summer and forced {{his way into the}} team for the last three Tests. He played a {{prominent}} role in the Fourth Test, scoring an aggressive and counterattacking 93 that helped Australia pry the initiative from England; the tourists eventually won the match. In 1949–50, Loxton cemented his position in the national team, playing in all five Tests in South Africa and scoring his only century at international level. He remained a regular member of the Test team until a form slump during the 1950–51 home season; he was dropped after three Tests against England and never played for Australia again. Loxton continued to play for Victoria in domestic competition until retiring {{at the end of the}} 1957–58 season.|$|E

5|$|An {{estimated}} 5,000 {{buildings were}} damaged beyond repair. In the Qazvin province, 120 buildings were demolished and 50 villages suffered massive damage. In the neighboring Hamadan province, 45 villages were destroyed. A {{large majority of}} houses in the region were single-story masonry buildings, and virtually all of these collapsed. As non-engineered structures, these could not withstand seismic forces, with structural failure and collapse resulting from wall-to-wall separation {{and the lack of}} structural integrity and of a proper lateral system of resisting. Newer structures built in accordance with the Iranian code of practice for seismic-resistant design fared much better. Damage <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>historic</b> Kharaqan tomb towers, which were in a good state of preservation before the event, suggests that the earthquake was possibly {{one of the most powerful}} in the region for approximately 900 years.|$|E
5|$|As a yearling, Oxbow {{was sent}} to the Keeneland sales, where he was {{purchased}} for $250,000 by bloodstock agent Eddie Kane, acting on behalf of Brad M. Kelley's Bluegrass Hall.

Prior to 2013, Calumet Farm had not had a winning horse in a Triple Crown race since 1968.|$|E
5|$|BL-80 {{continues}} {{to the east}} past Aria Boulevard, which to the north connects to I-80, and to the south leads <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>historic</b> Wendover Air Force Base, where the 509th Composite Group was stationed while it prepared to conduct atomic bomb attacks against Japan during 1944 and 1945. The highway briefly parallels the Shafter Subdivision of the Union Pacific Railroad's Central Corridor, which was formerly part of the Feather River Route of the Western Pacific Railroad. As the highway travels east towards a half trumpet interchange with I-80, the number of lanes drops from five to two. Traffic from BL-80 can access eastbound I-80 or turn off onto Frontage Road; however, to access westbound I-80, travelers must continue eastbound until the next exit and turn around. Traffic into Wendover can access BL-80 from both directions of I-80, and from Frontage Road.|$|E

5|$|Carter also {{reflects}} on the intriguing possibility, however remote, that a discovery in an unexplored library might one day bring some of this missing music to light. As of 2015 this has not occurred; however, a setting of Rinuccini's libretto by the British composer Alexander Goehr was performed at London's Royal Opera House on 15 September 1995, under the title Arianna. Goehr worked from Rinuccini's original script and, as a tribute <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>historic</b> opera, incorporated sections of Monteverdi's setting of the lament into his score.|$|E
5|$|Deal Castle was {{increasingly}} resembling a private house, rather than purely a fortification, and {{this led to}} arguments in 1829 {{as to whether it}} should be subject to local taxation as a private dwelling, or continue to be exempt as a military site. The captaincy had long since become an honorary position, given out as a reward by the Crown. In 1898, the War Office agreed that the Office of Works should be consulted over any external alterations <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>historic</b> castle, and that the Office of Works would be responsible for paying for any resulting work. The War Office finally concluded in 1904 that the castle no longer had any value either as a defence or as a barracks, and transferred it entirely to the Office of Works. When the captain was not in residence it was opened to visitors.|$|E
