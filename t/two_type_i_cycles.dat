The model used is one with four inter sub-lattice frequencies where each sub-lattice is treated as a random alloy. Coupling is achieved between the <b>two</b> <b>types</b> of <b>cycles,</b> <b>i.</b> e., with the vacancy starting on one sub-lattice and finishing on either sub-lattice and with a vacancy starting on the other sub-lattice and finishing on either sub-lattice. An expression for the tracer correlation factor is derived in terms of atom vacancy exchange frequencies and atomic concentrations. Results from this expression are compared with Monte Carlo calculations and also results from a previous Manning-type random alloy approach to the problem...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this article is to show the {{relationship}} between branding and brand management in small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). Traditionally, branding was associated with large and global corporations. However, we often forget that small and medium-sized enterprises also deal with their own names (brands) in their own way. The study identified four types of businesses, regardless of their association with brands. We named these four types, as follows: Ignorant; User; Low-Cost Producer; and Differentiation Producer. If the first <b>two</b> <b>types</b> (<b>i.</b> e. Ignorant and User) differ primarily in the extent to which they use simple branding activities, and are used mainly in the local market where the enterprises tend to operate, we found that the last <b>two</b> <b>types</b> (<b>i.</b> e. low-cost producers and differentiation producers) design their branding strategies in accordance with their generic strategies and mode of growth...|$|R

Sedimentological characteristics distin-guish the Jefferson City and Cotter dolomites from the underlying Gasconade and Roubidoux formations.
