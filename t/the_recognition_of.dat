30|$|As can be {{seen from}} Fig.  1, <b>the</b> overall <b>recognition</b> rate <b>of</b> <b>the</b> LBP-PCA {{algorithm}} is low, <b>the</b> <b>recognition</b> rate <b>of</b> LBP- 2 DLDA algorithm is located between LBP-PCA algorithm and the research algorithm of this study and in <b>the</b> <b>recognition</b> process, and <b>the</b> <b>recognition</b> rate <b>of</b> W-LBP- 2 DLD algorithm is significantly higher than LBP.PCA algorithm and LBP- 2 DLDA algorithm. With the increase of the number of samples in the early stage, <b>the</b> <b>recognition</b> rate <b>of</b> <b>the</b> three <b>recognition</b> algorithms increased faster. However, when the number of samples reaches six, <b>the</b> <b>recognition</b> rate tends to be stable. It {{can be seen}} from the figure that the algorithm of this study uses the W-LB algorithm to extract the face feature information more fully in feature extraction and makes the algorithm have better <b>recognition</b> ability. From <b>the</b> comparison test of the ORL face database, we can conclude that <b>the</b> <b>recognition</b> rate <b>of</b> this algorithm is higher than the traditional LBP algorithm and LBP-PCA algorithm, which has certain feasibility.|$|R
5|$|In 2012, two new phylogeny-aware tools appeared. One {{is called}} PAGAN that was {{developed}} by the same team as PRANK. The other is ProGraphMSA developed by Szalkowski. Both software packages were developed independently but share common features, notably the use of graph algorithms to improve <b>the</b> <b>recognition</b> <b>of</b> non-homologous regions, and an improvement in code making these software faster than PRANK.|$|E
5|$|Proposed {{mechanisms}} for <b>the</b> <b>recognition</b> <b>of</b> worker-laid eggs or active reproductive workers include marker hydrocarbons {{on the surface}} of queen-laid eggs, cuticle hydrocarbons on reproductive workers, and recognition of nest-mates. In rare cases, worker-laid eggs carry mimicked queen hydrocarbons and escape policing, a condition known as the anarchic syndrome.|$|E
5|$|Termites can {{distinguish}} nestmates and non-nestmates through chemical communication and gut symbionts: chemicals consisting of hydrocarbons {{released from the}} cuticle allow <b>the</b> <b>recognition</b> <b>of</b> alien termite species. Each colony has its own distinct odour. This odour {{is a result of}} genetic and environmental factors such as the termites' diet and the composition of the bacteria within the termites' intestines.|$|E

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>recognition</b> <b>of</b> Beonna as a {{historical}} figure leaves the 'Hun' element in the word Hunbeanna detached. Beanna is itself a hypocoristic form of a two-part name, and the 'nn' in the name has been interpreted as representing a geminate consonant.|$|E
5|$|Æthelstan {{followed}} up his {{advances in the}} north by securing <b>the</b> <b>recognition</b> <b>of</b> the Welsh kings. For the next seven years, the record {{of events in the}} north is blank. Æthelstan's court was attended by the Welsh kings, but not by Constantine or Owain. This absence of record means that Æthelstan's reasons for marching north against Constantine in 934 are unclear.|$|E
5|$|A {{controversy}} exists about <b>the</b> <b>recognition</b> <b>of</b> Peleinae and Patholopinae, {{comprising the}} genera Pelea and Pantholops respectively, as subfamilies. In 2000, American biologist George Schaller and palaeontologist Elisabeth Vrba suggested {{the inclusion of}} Pelea in Reduncinae, though the grey rhebok, the sole species of Pelea, is highly different from kobs and reduncines in morphology. Pantholops, earlier classified in the Antilopinae, was later placed in its own subfamily, Pantholopinae. However, molecular and morphological analysis supports the inclusion of Pantholops in Caprinae.|$|E

5|$|Anamorphic or {{imperfect}} fungi {{are those that}} seem to lack a sexual stage in their life cycle, and typically reproduce {{by the process of}} mitosis in structures called conidia. In some cases, the sexual stage—or teleomorph stage—is later identified, and a teleomorph-anamorph relationship is established between the species. The International Code of Botanical Nomenclature permits <b>the</b> <b>recognition</b> <b>of</b> two (or more) names for one and the same organisms, one based on the teleomorph, the other(s) restricted to the anamorph. The anamorphic state of S.coccinea is Molliardiomyces dudleyi.|$|E

5|$|Before <b>the</b> <b>recognition</b> <b>of</b> {{more than}} one species, {{differences}} in population density were noted between southern forests like Kirindy and northern forests near Ambanja. Later, it was recognized that Coquerel's giant mouse lemur was found in lower densities than the northern giant mouse lemur. The former range between 30 and 210individuals per square kilometer (250acres), with lower densities in open areas of the forest, while the latter has been recorded with 385 to 1,086individuals per km2. However, {{in the case of}} the northern giant mouse lemur, populations were found in more isolated forest fragments and it is thought that their consumption of introduced cashew and mango help sustain these higher populations.|$|E

The airline decided to move to Nagoya Airfield, after the opening of Chūbu Centrair International Airport. On February 17, 2005, J-Air realized its dream and relocated to its new home at Nagoya Airfield. In order to strengthen <b>the</b> <b>recognition</b> <b>of</b> the JAL brand and improve customer convenience, the airline disposed its own flight numbers and changed to JAL flight numbers from April 1, 2005.|$|E

On 25 July the same year, Riego de Dios took the Romblon capital and captured Spanish officials. Four days later, the Spanish politico-military governor Don Carlos Mendoza formally signed the surrender of Romblon’s district government, ending {{more than three hundred}} years of Spanish rule in the archipelagic province.|$|E
