5|$|In 2010, <b>the</b> <b>car</b> <b>was</b> {{fitted with}} a GPS {{tracking}} device, and the Astoria-Warrenton Chamber of Commerce makes location information {{available to the public}} on its website. The data is updated online every two minutes while the trolley is running.|$|E
5|$|Murray had {{designed}} {{a car for}} the 1979 season called the BT47 that had a Chaparral 2J-type box rear end with twin variable geometry fans on the rear to maximize ground effect. <b>The</b> <b>car</b> <b>was</b> never built due to the FIA closing the loophole in the regulations for the 1979 season.|$|E
5|$|Shortly {{before its}} public {{unveiling}} at the New York Motor Show in April 1964 <b>the</b> <b>car</b> <b>was</b> renamed from Thunderbolt to Tiger, inspired by Sunbeam's 1925 land-speed-record holder.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>cars</b> <b>are</b> {{connected}} {{to one another}} by a mechanical type H tightlock knuckle coupler. All trainlined electrical connections between <b>the</b> <b>cars</b> <b>are</b> made through six trainline jumper cables. Air connections between <b>the</b> <b>cars</b> <b>are</b> made through two air hoses, brake pipe and main reservoir.|$|R
50|$|The {{friction}} between the upper driving pulley and the cable was insufficient to move <b>the</b> <b>cars</b> when <b>the</b> <b>cars</b> <b>were</b> unbalanced, i.e. <b>the</b> upper <b>car</b> <b>was</b> empty and <b>the</b> lower <b>car</b> <b>was</b> fully loaded. If the situation was reversed and <b>the</b> upper <b>car</b> <b>was</b> fully loaded, <b>the</b> cable slipped round the wheel so that the speed of <b>the</b> <b>cars</b> could not <b>be</b> controlled by braking the pulley.|$|R
25|$|When <b>the</b> <b>cars</b> <b>were</b> {{modified}} {{to run to}} the Wirral railway, heaters and air compressors <b>were</b> added. <b>The</b> <b>cars</b> <b>were</b> replaced by vehicles similar to the Wirral Railway units in 1956–57.|$|R
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>car</b> <b>was</b> {{assembled}} in a purpose-built factory at Wykham Mill, Bloxham near Banbury in Oxfordshire. HRH The Princess of Wales officially opened the factory and unveiled the first production XJ220 in October 1991.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>car</b> <b>was</b> {{initially}} {{designed in}} 1979 as a short notice {{replacement for the}} team's Alfa Romeo-engined BT48, after Brabham team owner Bernie Ecclestone decided to end {{his relationship with the}} Italian engine manufacturer. The BT49 was created in only six weeks using elements of the BT48 chassis together with the widely used Cosworth DFV engine. It is a single seater with an open cockpit and exposed wheels. The monocoque chassis is made from aluminium alloy and carbon fibre composites. <b>The</b> <b>car</b> <b>was</b> fitted with controversial hydropneumatic suspension and water-cooled brakes at different points in its life.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>car</b> <b>was</b> waved {{through three}} {{security}} checkpoints without stopping before arriving at its destination {{well within the}} base. Sixteen people {{were waiting for the}} car near a building set up to debrief al-Balawi. Al-Balawi got out of the vehicle and detonated the explosives hidden in his suicide vest.|$|E
50|$|Stolen <b>cars</b> <b>are</b> sold {{in foreign}} {{countries}} for several reasons. In underdeveloped countries, there are often fewer rules and less enforcement of laws pertaining to plates and title paperwork, so <b>the</b> <b>car</b> <b>is</b> {{less likely to be}} noticed. Criminals are also hopeful that there is little incentive {{on the part of the}} victim to search in other countries, as even if <b>the</b> <b>car</b> <b>is</b> found, recovery may cost more (in detective, legal, and transportation fees) than <b>the</b> <b>car</b> <b>is</b> actually worth. This is especially true if <b>the</b> stolen <b>car</b> <b>is</b> of low value.|$|R
5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>car</b> <b>is</b> {{also won}} as a prize for {{completing}} the Supercar Nostalgia Cup in Gran Turismo 5 for the PlayStation 3, and <b>the</b> <b>car</b> <b>is</b> {{carried over into}} Gran Turismo 6.|$|R
5000|$|... == Model == According to Jeep, The Jeep Renegade is {{made from}} minimal components, the chassis and <b>the</b> <b>car</b> {{interior}} <b>are</b> made from {{a single piece of}} aluminum. The floor of <b>the</b> <b>car</b> <b>is</b> designed in such a fashion that any water is immediately discharged outside. <b>The</b> <b>car</b> <b>is</b> reportedly fully recyclable.|$|R
5|$|The initial {{high speed}} runs, {{with the car}} {{configured}} in production specification (catalytic converters connected, lower rev-limit of 7400rpm) achieved a maximum recorded speed of , the same speed as previously reached at Fort Stockton during testing. Brundle reported that <b>the</b> <b>car</b> <b>was</b> hitting the rev limiter during the run.|$|E
5|$|After {{the first}} pit stops, the Mercedes drivers had {{to manage their}} tyres in order to cover from a {{possible}} attack by Ferrari, who had an extra set of fresh tyres saved from qualifying. Rosberg however complained over the radio about Hamilton {{in front of him}} driving too slow, which caused him to back into the charging Ferraris. He was unable to risk driving too close behind Hamilton, because dispersed air from the back of <b>the</b> <b>car</b> <b>was</b> accelerating tyre degradation. Hamilton was therefore asked by the team to pick up the pace.|$|E
5|$|Birdy concedes to Al's {{wishes of}} {{pursuing}} another venture. After they purchase a 1953 Ford and restore it, Al's father, Mr. Columbato, registers the vehicle. Al drives Birdy to an Atlantic City boardwalk, but are arrested {{the next day}} after Mr. Columbato reports the car stolen. After bailing the boys out of jail, Mr. Columbato sells the vehicle. Birdy later confronts him, claiming that <b>the</b> <b>car</b> <b>was</b> not his to sell, and refuses a sum of money offered to him on principle.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>cars</b> <b>were</b> {{delivered}} as 5 NUB sets {{of seven}} cars, normally marshalled as HFN, FN, FN, BN, BN, FN and HFN. <b>Car</b> numbers <b>were</b> 2177-2211 and <b>the</b> <b>cars</b> being numbered sequentially within each set. <b>The</b> BN <b>cars</b> <b>were</b> first class <b>cars</b> and sat 56 passengers in seven semi-partitioned sections. <b>The</b> FN <b>cars</b> <b>were</b> second class <b>cars</b> and could seat 78 passengers. <b>The</b> HFN <b>cars</b> <b>were</b> second class brake vans and could seat 68 passengers.|$|R
50|$|Tromp and Cilibrasi (2004) {{showed that}} Rush Hour is still PSPACE-complete when <b>the</b> <b>cars</b> <b>are</b> of size 2 only. They also conjectured that Rush Hour is still nontrivial when <b>the</b> <b>cars</b> <b>are</b> of size 1 only.|$|R
50|$|Pulling <b>the</b> <b>car</b> {{backward}} (hence <b>the</b> name) {{winds up}} an internal coil spring. When released, <b>the</b> <b>car</b> <b>is</b> propelled {{forward by the}} spring. When the spring has unwound and <b>the</b> <b>car</b> <b>is</b> moving, <b>the</b> motor is disengaged by a clutch or ratchet and <b>the</b> <b>car</b> then rolls freely onward.|$|R
5|$|For 1968, Austrian Jochen Rindt {{replaced}} Hulme, who {{had left}} to join McLaren. Repco produced a more powerful version of their V8 to maintain competitiveness against Ford's new Cosworth DFV, but it proved very unreliable. Slow communications between the UK and Australia had always made identifying and correcting problems very difficult. <b>The</b> <b>car</b> <b>was</b> fast—Rindt set pole position twice during the season—but Brabham and Rindt finished only three races between them, and ended the year with only ten points.|$|E
5|$|From 1973 to 1987, 1947 IE alum Pete George {{maintained}} the Ramblin' Wreck at the Hapeville Ford Plant. George would mastermind the 1974 change of colors {{as well as}} a major refurbishment of the Wreck in 1982 in time for Georgia Tech's 1985 centennial celebration. <b>The</b> <b>car</b> <b>was</b> completely disassembled, rebuilt, and repainted by late 1982.|$|E
5|$|In 1903 the District tested two seven-car trains with {{different}} control and brake systems on its unopened line between Ealing and South Harrow. Access to <b>the</b> <b>car</b> <b>was</b> by platforms with lattice gates at their ends and hand operated sliding {{doors on the}} car sides. Later some trailer cars were fitted with driving controls and two and three car trains operated from Mill Hill Park to Hounslow and South Harrow and later Uxbridge until they were withdrawn in 1925.|$|E
50|$|The series {{used the}} Tatuus FA010B chassis. This <b>car</b> <b>is</b> {{also used in}} Formula Abarth and other {{regional}} championships. <b>The</b> <b>car</b> <b>is</b> built to Formula 3 safety regulations to ensure the drivers safety. <b>The</b> <b>car</b> <b>is</b> powered by a 1400cc Fiat-FPT engine producing 190hp.|$|R
50|$|After {{three years}} of service, <b>the</b> <b>cars</b> <b>were</b> {{brought back to the}} factory in 1955 to be updated to 1956 Imperial appearance, in which form they {{continue}} to exist to the present day. The front and rear, including grilles, bumpers and trim, were replaced. Internally, the engines were updated with 4-barrel carburetors, and fully automatic Powerflite transmissions <b>were</b> installed. <b>The</b> <b>cars</b> <b>were</b> all repainted. After <b>the</b> rebuild, <b>the</b> <b>cars</b> <b>were</b> donated to <b>the</b> respective cities.|$|R
50|$|Each program {{features}} exceptional {{racing and}} street <b>cars</b> from <b>the</b> marque. Generally, <b>the</b> <b>cars</b> <b>are</b> presented {{in chronological order}} of their production dates. For each car, de Cadenet describes the historical background and impetus for its design. Important mechanical aspects of <b>the</b> <b>car</b> <b>are</b> also pinpointed and described by de Cadenet. <b>The</b> <b>cars</b> <b>are</b> then filmed as de Cadenet enters the cockpit, straps himself in, starts the engine, and test drives them.|$|R
5|$|In the 1960s {{and early}} 1970s, drivers who had reached Formula One often {{continued}} {{to compete in}} Formula Two. In 1966 MRD produced the BT18 for the lower category, with a Honda engine acting as a stressed component. <b>The</b> <b>car</b> <b>was</b> extremely successful, winning 11 consecutive Formula Two races {{in the hands of}} the Formula One pairing of Brabham and Hulme. Cars were entered by MRD and not by the Brabham Racing Organisation, avoiding a direct conflict with Repco, their Formula One engine supplier.|$|E
5|$|It is rumoured that Briatore {{arranged}} {{an agreement}} with Red Bull that, if they offered Webber a race seat, Renault would supply them with engines. On 26 January 2007 the new Red Bull RB3 challenger was unveiled in Spain, and Webber drove the car in a shakedown in Barcelona on the same day. The car featured heavy revisions to the team's previous cars and looked very much like designer Adrian Newey's previous cars which had either won or {{come close to the}} World Title. <b>The</b> <b>car</b> <b>was</b> fitted with a Renault RS27 engine.|$|E
5|$|Jordan's new car, the EJ10B, {{was also}} {{introduced}} that weekend; {{the team had}} used their primary 2000 car, the EJ10, for the previous ten races. Originally due to be introduced at the previous race in Austria, <b>the</b> <b>car</b> <b>was</b> required to undergo Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile (FIA) safety tests on its bodywork and Jordan wanted to develop more spare parts for the EJ10B, delaying the car's race début.|$|E
5000|$|A [...] {{version of}} the Beast came out later. <b>The</b> <b>car</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> same as the older Beast, with a 0-60 mph of 2.9 seconds, but the only {{difference}} being that <b>the</b> <b>car</b> <b>is</b> more powerful. <b>The</b> weight is at 750 kg, which makes <b>the</b> <b>car's</b> power-to-weight ratio <b>be</b> set to [...] per ton.|$|R
50|$|It {{was decided}} that two-thirds of <b>the</b> <b>cars</b> <b>were</b> to be dumped in water in excess of 2000 m deep, {{followed}} by {{the sinking of the}} ship in waters of a similar depth. Although the dumping of <b>the</b> <b>cars</b> <b>was</b> started, it was not completed as such action was in violation of the London Dumping Convention, due to the plastics contained in <b>the</b> <b>cars.</b> Reijin <b>was</b> sunk in deep water.|$|R

5|$|Kud Wafter was {{released}} in Japan on June 25, 2010 as a limited edition version for Windows as a DVD. As a bonus, it came bundled with the visual novel's original soundtrack and a game demo of Key's ninth game Rewrite. Takahiro Baba, the president of VisualArt's, the publisher of Kud Wafter, announced via his Twitter account in April 2010 that 100,000 copies of Kud Wafter would be produced in its initial release. To advertise Kud Wafter, Good Smile Racing took Shinji Orito's 2003 Honda Fit and made it into an itasha (a car featuring illustrations of anime-styled characters) with images of Kudryavka. <b>The</b> <b>car</b> <b>was</b> driven around and showcased throughout Japan between April 19 and June 26, 2010. <b>The</b> <b>car</b> <b>was</b> put onto the Japanese Yahoo! Auction website on June 25, 2010 and sold for 1,699,000 yen after starting the auction at 1 yen.|$|E
5|$|On 17 May 2010, Oliver Fricker trespassed and vandalised car 1048 (trainset 047/048) with {{graffiti}} at Changi Depot. The graffiti {{was initially}} mistaken for an advertisement {{and was not}} spotted until <b>the</b> <b>car</b> <b>was</b> filmed and the video was uploaded to YouTube by a trainspotter. Fricker was {{convicted and sentenced to}} seven months' imprisonment and caning. The public perceived this incident to have serious security implications, as the depot was considered a sensitive installation.|$|E
5|$|On 26 March 1957, {{motor car}} 66.03 and center car 18821 were damaged {{in a fire}} at Kristiansand. Both were retired due to the large damages.
