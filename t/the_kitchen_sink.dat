In the episode Thumbelina's Wild Ride, Thumbelina (voiced by Debby Ryan with her singing voice {{provided}} by Shannon Chan-Kent) is hired to babysit for Goldie and Bear. The two friends are initially put off by her small stature, thinking she's almost helpless.

Goldie and Bear try to save her, but soon see that Thumbelina is resourceful, agile, and can lift several times her own weight. She saves herself from the river and even rescues the kids when they fall in trying to save her. The kids take an instant liking to Thumbellina and can't {{wait for the next}} time she babysits.|$|E

25|$|Sim {{was among}} the top British film stars of the early- and mid-1950s, but his films of the late 1950s are {{considered}} by the critic Michael Brooke to be of lesser quality, because of poor scripts or lack of innovative direction. Sim made no films in the decade between 1961 and 1971; {{it is not clear}} whether this was, as Brooke suggests, because he found the scripts offered to him unacceptable or, as Simpson proposes, because film makers in the 1960s thought him unsuited to <b>the</b> <b>kitchen</b> <b>sink</b> dramas then fashionable.|$|E
25|$|Participants in {{the ritual}} may dip {{themselves}} three times under the water, honoring the Holy Trinity, to symbolically wash away their sins from the past year, and to experience a sense of spiritual rebirth. Orthodox priests are on hand to bless the water, and rescuers are on hand to monitor {{the safety of the}} swimmers in the ice-cold water. Others limit their participation in the Epiphany rites to those conducted inside churches, where priests perform the Great Blessing of Waters, both on Epiphany Eve and Epiphany (Theophany) proper. The water is then distributed to attendees who may store it to use in times of illness, to bless themselves, family members, and their homes, or to drink. Some Russians think any water – even from the taps on <b>the</b> <b>kitchen</b> <b>sink</b> – poured or bottled on Epiphany becomes holy water, since all the water in the world is blessed this day. In the more mild climate of the southern city of Sochi meanwhile, where air and water temperatures both hover in the low to mid 10 degree Celsius range (50 degrees Fahrenheit) in January, thousands of people jump into the Black Sea at midnight each year on Epiphany and begin to swim in celebration of the feast.|$|E
25|$|Jameson’s {{research}} {{showed that}} the kinetics of flotation of fine particles was a strong function of the bubble diameter and {{that the way to}} improve recoveries was to use small bubbles in the order of 300µm in diameter. What was needed was a practical method of making such bubbles in large quantities, of the order of billions per second. The device needed to be simple to construct and operate, capable of running for long periods with minimal maintenance, and should be resistant to blockage by stray large particles in the feed. He began to look at the theory of bubble breakup in sheared flows, that is, in flow fields in which layers of liquid slide over each other. Lewis and Davidson had recently published a theory to predict the maximum size of bubbles in a well-characterised flow environment. By balancing the forces acting on a bubble in a shearing flow, including the disruptive dynamic stresses from the liquid motion and the restoring force of surface tension, it was possible to predict the critical shear rate required to produce a bubble of given size. Jameson then looked for simple and practical ways of generating the required shear rates, and found inspiration in <b>the</b> <b>kitchen</b> <b>sink.</b> If a jet of water from a tap plunges into a basin full of water, a shear layer develops around the jet, that entrains air from the atmosphere into the water, and at the same time, breaks up the entrained air into fine bubbles. The effect is magnified if there is a detergent in the water. Detergents, known as frothers, are used in flotation to prevent bubble coalescence, and to create stable froths. By the correct choice of jet velocity and diameter, it is possible to provide a controlled shear environment that can generate bubbles of a suitable size for flotation, with the added advantage that the air is naturally aspirated by the jet, so {{there is no need for}} a compressor or blower. Thus the idea of the Jameson Cell was born.|$|E

But I'm very proud of the script. David Duchovny and I worked quite closely on the story and {{he had a lot of}} input, and then I sat down and wrote the script". He felt that the episode ended the season in the best manner possible, asking more questions than it answered.

Paste magazine writer Bonnie Stiernberg called Pete Campbell [...] "one of the most complex, underrated characters on TV today" [...] and called the dripping sink [...] "more like a fucking geyser in reality, and if he doesn’t do something to plug it up soon, he’s going to drown." [...] Jordan Bartel of the Chicago Tribune called the episode [...] "a classic" [...] and saw a possible Emmy nomination for Vincent Kartheiser, but felt <b>the</b> <b>kitchen</b> <b>sink</b> symbolism and ending voiceover was a little heavyhanded. Maureen Ryan of The Huffington Post praised Lane's character and Slattery's direction during the fight sequence, singling out Don, Bert, and Roger's reactions as [...] "absolute comedy gold". She also compared the Pete character to former U.S. President Richard Nixon because: [...] "there's a sense with Pete that there's always a chip on his shoulder and he'll eternally feel misunderstood and undervalued. He'll always inspire a mixture of pity and exasperation, because he's smart and insightful, but he can be a piece of work." ...|$|E

He found the gameplay challenging, being forced to conserve energy as the game [...] " [...] everything but <b>the</b> <b>kitchen</b> <b>sink</b> at [...] ". Rignall agreed with Leadbetter on the game's difficulty, which along with the secret rooms and power-ups to be discovered made Alisia Dragoon an excellent action platform game that had long-lasting appeal. [...] Of the hundreds of Genesis games, Mega magazine rated Alisia Dragoon among the top 100 games, calling it [...] " [...] the best dragon-based platform game around."

500|$|Sutcliffe's few {{surviving}} works reveal {{influence from}} the British and European abstract artists contemporary with the Abstract Expressionist {{movement in the}} United States. His earlier figurative work is reminiscent of <b>the</b> <b>kitchen</b> <b>sink</b> school, particularly of John Bratby, though Sutcliffe was producing abstract work {{by the end of}} the 1950s, including The Summer Painting, purchased by Moores. Sutcliffe's works bear some comparison with those of John Hoyland and Nicolas de Staël, though they are more lyrical (Sutcliffe used the stage name [...] "Stu de Staël" [...] when he was playing with the Beatles on a Scottish tour in spring 1960). His later works are typically untitled, constructed from heavily impastoed slabs of pigment in the manner of de Staël, whom he learned about from Surrey born, art college instructor, Nicky Horsfield, and overlaid with scratched or squeezed linear elements creating enclosed spaces. Hamburg Painting no. 2 was purchased by Liverpool's Walker Art Gallery and is one of a series entitled Hamburg in which the surface and colour changes produced atmospheric energy. European artists (including Paolozzi) were also influencing Sutcliffe at the time. The Walker Art Gallery has other works by Sutcliffe, which are Self-portrait (in charcoal) and The Crucifixion. Lennon later hung a pair of Sutcliffe's paintings in his house (Kenwood) in Weybridge, and McCartney had a Paolozzi sculpture in his Cavendish Avenue home.|$|E

[...] However, as the character has been developed on screen and given a bigger role, he has attracted more positive commentary from reviewers. Ben Rawson-Jones of Digital Spy describes his {{role in the}} episode [...] "Meat" [...] as [...] "forming a clever contrast with the activities of Torchwood". He praised the verisimilitude of Rhys' relationship with Gwen, describing their domestic argument as [...] "a unique spin on <b>the</b> <b>kitchen</b> <b>sink</b> melodrama usually seen in EastEnders" [...] which delivers [...] "a real impact and emotional honesty due to the wonderfully earnest performances from Kai Owen and Eve Myles". Jack Kibble-White of Den of Geek states that [...] "in the main having Rhys run alongside Captain Jack and the rest worked well" [...] and he cites the character's wedding to Gwen as a series highlight. TV Squad's Jason Hughes feels that the character's marriage to Gwen is [...] "handled in a painfully honest way" [...] and serves as [...] "a true definition of [...] "love" [...] written with subtlety and perfection". Alan Stanley Blair enjoyed the rapport between Owen and Price (PC Andy) in the episode [...] "Exit Wounds" [...] stating, that it [...] "was also an interesting dynamic" [...] and that the two [...] "could potentially carry their own sitcom", a view corroborated by AfterElton's Steven Frank.|$|E

Robert Copsey of Digital Spy wrote, [...] "Max Martin and Shellback chuck the Pinks, Keshas and Katy Perrys into <b>the</b> <b>kitchen</b> <b>sink</b> and add a generous coat of gloss and shimmer (and Auto-Tune) to create what is {{ultimately}} an audacious, unabashed and, crucially, authentic pop stomper that remains true to what Glee is all about".
