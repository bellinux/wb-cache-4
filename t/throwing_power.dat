25|$|On June 14, 2010, Calderón {{returned}} to action after {{nine months of}} recovery, his opponent was Jesús Iribe. He opened the contest by employing his usual technical style. In the second round Iribe was able to score a flash knockdown following a straight punch, Calderón was uninjured and resumed. Iribe tried to exploit his advantage by pressuring the offensive, {{but was unable to}} score power punches while receiving combinations. Calderón continued boxing throughout the fourth round, becoming increasingly more offensive in the fifth. This pattern continued during the following three rounds. Iribe was able to score some punches in the ninth, but Calderón dominated the tenth and eleventh rounds. Iribe attempted to close the fight by <b>throwing</b> <b>power</b> punches, but received several counter punches while doing so. The judges scored the fight 116-111 and 118-109 in favor of Calderón. This was his 18th victory in a championship contest, which made him the most successful Puerto Rican champion in history, surpassing Félix Trinidad and Wilfredo Gómez, both of whom are tied with 17.|$|E
2500|$|On August 25, 2007, Calderón {{defeated}} Hugo Cázares by {{split decision}} {{to become the}} WBO and Lineal Light Flyweight Champion. Calderón entered the ring accompanied by a display of fireworks, before a crowd that featured several media personalities, including Oscar De La Hoya. The size difference between both pugilists was evident since the moment that they stood {{next to each other}} prior {{to the beginning of the}} fight. Early in the fight Calderón's tactic consisted of connecting fast consecutive combinations while avoiding Cázares' punches. With this strategy he managed to stun Cazares with uppercuts and straight punches. During the fight the crowd displayed support for Calderón, at one point chanting [...] "Olé" [...] when his adversary's punches missed. In the third round Cázares displayed a more fluid offensive, but in the fifth he presented a strategy that consisted of only <b>throwing</b> <b>power</b> punches which seemed to benefit Calderón. In the seventh round Ivan's offensive pace slowed which benefited Hugo who improved on the offensive aspect. In the eighth round Cázares connected several hard punches which led to Calderón to rely on holds to slow his offense, in this round Cázares scored a knockdown. In the ninth he was in a defensive stance, and during the last rounds he continued this pattern and only connected solidly in the tenth round while Cázares missed several of the punches he threw. At the conclusion of the fight the judges awarded scores of 116-111 for Cázares and 115-112 twice for Calderón. With this victory he became the eleventh Puerto Rican boxer to win multiple world championships and unified this championship with the minimum division's one until he vacated it following the announcement that he was going to continue in the light flyweight division. The Ring also recognized Calderón as their champion, dethroning Cázares.|$|E
