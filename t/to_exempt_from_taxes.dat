The analysis {{focuses on the}} implications of this and other pension tax regimes for intergenerational equity, national living standards, labour supply, saving and social welfare.

60|$|The proper {{officers}} of the Treasury have deemed themselves required by {{the law of the}} United States upon the subject to demand a tax upon the incomes of foreign consuls in this country. While such a demand may not in strictness be in derogation of public law, or perhaps of any existing treaty between the United States and a foreign country, the expediency of so far modifying the act as <b>to</b> <b>exempt</b> <b>from</b> <b>tax</b> the income of such consuls as are not citizens of the United States, derived from the emoluments of their office or from property not situated in the United States, is submitted to your serious consideration. I make this suggestion upon the ground that a comity which ought <b>to</b> be reciprocated <b>exempts</b> our consuls in all other countries from taxation to the extent thus indicated. The United States, I think, ought not to be exceptionally illiberal to international trade and commerce.|$|R

25|$|The formal nobility in Finland {{dates back}} to 1280 when it was agreed in the entire Swedish realm by the Decree of Alsnö that magnates who could afford to {{contribute}} to the cavalry with a heavily equipped horse-soldier were <b>to</b> be <b>exempted</b> <b>from</b> <b>tax</b> - at least <b>from</b> ordinary land <b>taxes</b> - as the clergy already had been.

50|$|The {{institution}} of Swedish (and Finnish) nobility {{dates back to}} 1280, when it was stated by King Magnus III in the Decree of Alsnö that magnates who could afford to contribute a mounted soldier to the cavalry were <b>to</b> be <b>exempted</b> <b>from</b> <b>tax</b> - at least <b>from</b> ordinary <b>taxes</b> - just as the clergy already had been. The archaic Swedish term for nobility, frälse, also included the clergy {{with respect to their}} exemption <b>from</b> <b>tax.</b> Generally, the nobility grew from wealthier or more powerful members of the peasantry, those who were capable of assigning work or wealth to provide the requisite cavalrymen.|$|R

50|$|So, for example, the Double Tax Treaty {{with the}} UK {{looks at a}} period of 183 days in the German tax year (which {{is the same as}} the {{calendar}} year); thus, a citizen of the UK could work in Germany from 1 September through the following 31 May (9 months) and then claim <b>to</b> be <b>exempt</b> <b>from</b> German <b>tax.</b>|$|R
5000|$|After {{the decay}} of the ritsuryō system, a feudal system of manors developed. Landowners or nameholders commended shares of the revenue {{produced}} (called shiki) to more powerful leaders often at the court, in order <b>to</b> be <b>exempted</b> <b>from</b> <b>taxes</b> and <b>to</b> subvert the Chinese-style [...] "equal fields" [...] system, whereby land was redistributed after certain periods of time. In the Kamakura period a hierarchy of nameholder, manor stewards (jitō), shugo (military provincial governor), and the shogun in Kamakura had evolved. These shōen were completely free from interference from the government, which therefore had no say or control of what occurred within the shōen's boundaries.|$|R

Araneta donated the US$10,000 prize money she won as Miss International to Manila Boys Town and Girls Home, a place where indigent and out of school youth are housed, in Marikina City, Philippines. This led the Congress to pass a resolution <b>to</b> <b>exempt</b> her <b>from</b> paying <b>taxes.</b>|$|R
40|$|The United States is {{generally}} a tax haven for foreign portfolio investors: the United States <b>exempts</b> <b>from</b> <b>tax</b> most U. S. source interest and capital gains, but <b>taxes</b> dividends <b>from</b> U. S. companies; tax treaties generally eliminate U. S. tax on interest {{and reduce the}} 30 % statutory rate on dividends. Foreign investors in U. S. mutual funds have not been treated as favorably. Fund distributions (other than of net capital gains) were originally treated as taxable dividends, regardless of the fund’s underlying income. Interest or short-term capital gains earned by the mutual fund — {{which would have been}} tax exempt if directly earned by a foreign investor — were converted into taxable dividend income when distributed. To encourage foreign investment in U. S. mutual funds, Congress in 2004 modified the mutual fund distribution rules <b>to</b> <b>exempt</b> <b>from</b> <b>tax</b> fund dividends that are attributable to the fund’s U. S. source interest income or short-term capital gains. The stated goal of the legislation was to tax foreign investors on the same basis as if they had directly earned their share of a fund’s income. These provisions fail to fully achieve this goal by denying pass-through treatment for foreign source interest and dividends. This policy appears to be aimed at preventing foreign investors from using a U. S. mutual fund to obtain U. S. treaty benefits. Foreign source income should retain its source and character when distributed to foreign shareholders. This tax treatment is consistent with the tax results a foreign investor realizes when he or she invests directly or through a partnership and encourages foreign investment in mutual funds that invest globally. The treaty shopping concerns may be illusory. To address potential treaty abuse, Congress could consider limiting the pass- through of foreign source income to treaty residents...|$|R
5000|$|The {{dependency}} on donors can also force NPJ centers {{to depend on}} credibility for funding, and therefore improve their standards. For example, three major NPJs, the Center for Public Integrity, ProPublica and the Center for Investigative Reporting are succeeding greatly, winning Pulitzer Prizes, and in return receiving more donor-based funding. According to a study, many reporters felt the nonprofit funding model gives them greater freedom to choose stories based on merit and public impact rather than popularity. Unlike mainstream media, which relies more on business strategies, NPJ centers {{do not need to}} show their philanthropic funders an immediate return on investment. [...] They are, therefore, less subjected to agenda-setting commercial pressures than mainstream media. Their non-profit nature also allows them <b>to</b> be <b>exempted</b> <b>from</b> <b>taxes</b> <b>from</b> the federal government.|$|R

In 1557 the town burned in a fire, and King Zygmunt August allowed its owner, Aleksander Porycki <b>to</b> <b>exempt</b> residents <b>from</b> <b>taxes</b> for the period of 10 years. Poryck belonged to several szlachta families, including the Koniecpolski and Czacki families. In 1806, Tadeusz Czacki built here two empire style palaces. Located at the lake, one palace housed a large library (the so-called Poryck Library), in which a number of Polish national treasures was kept. Also, Czacki had a rare collection of fine china. Second palace served as a family residence. In 1816, Poryck was visited by Julian Ursyn Niemcewicz, who described his stay here in his “Historic Travels”.|$|R

40|$|Acidic or {{alkaline}} direct ethanol {{fuel cells}} (DEFCs) {{can be a}} sustainable alternative for power generation if they are fuelled with bio-ethanol. However, {{in order to keep}} the fuel cheap, ethanol has <b>to</b> be <b>exempted</b> <b>from</b> <b>tax</b> on spirits by denaturing. In this investigation the potential denaturing agents fusel oil, tert-butyl ethyl ether, and Bitrex were tested with regard to their compatibility with fuel cells. Experiments were carried out both in sulphuric acid and potassium hydroxide solution. Beside, basic electrochemical tests, differential electrochemical mass spectrometry (DEMS) and fuel cell tests were conducted. It was found that fusel oil is not suitable as denaturing agent for DEFC. However, tert-butyl ethyl ether does not seem to hinder the ethanol conversion as much. Finally, a mixture of tert-butyl ethyl ether and Bitrex can be proposed as promising candidate as denaturing agent for use in acidic and alkaline DEFC...|$|R

50|$|The {{history of}} Głogów begins on April 22, 1570, when a local nobleman Krzysztof Glowa of Nowosielce (Jelita coat of arms) issued a document, upon which {{a brand new}} town called Głowów was to be founded in a forest along a {{merchant}} route to Sandomierz. According to Glowa’s plans, the town was to become an ideal Renaissance urban center, competing with the nearby Rzeszow. Architects, employed by Glowa, designed a large market square (168/168 meters), with plots for 40 houses. Furthermore, special plots were fashioned for gardens, church, rectory, bath house, hospital, mill, brewery and folwark. According to the original plans, Głowów was to have 200 houses, whose residents were <b>to</b> be <b>exempted</b> <b>from</b> <b>taxes</b> for 20 years. Two fairs a year were planned, markets took place every Tuesday, and the inhabitants were permitted to brew their own beer. The shape of the municipal government and court was based on Magdeburg rights town law.|$|R

[...] The Boardwalk Pavilion lost its tax-exempt status in 2007 because the state ruled that it no longer met the requirements as a place open to all members of the public. From 1989 until the Pavilion lost its tax-exempt status, the OGCMA had received $500,000 in annual tax breaks through the state's Green Acres program. The boardwalk and beach remain tax-exempt.|$|R

One of his first tasks was to tour across Europe, to raise support for the Order and try to {{organize}} another Crusade. He met the newly invested Pope Boniface VIII, who agreed to grant the Templars the same privileges at Cyprus as they had held in the Holy Land. Charles II of Naples and Edward I also pledged varying types of support, either continuing <b>to</b> <b>exempt</b> the Templars <b>from</b> <b>taxes,</b> or pledging future support towards building a new army.|$|R
5000|$|In some jurisdictions, like Austria, death {{gives rise}} to the local {{equivalent}} of gift tax. This was the UK model before the Inheritance Tax in 1986 was introduced, when estates were charged to a form of gift tax called Capital Transfer Tax. Where a jurisdiction has both gift tax and inheritance tax, it is usual <b>to</b> <b>exempt</b> inheritances <b>from</b> gift <b>tax.</b> Also, it is common for inheritance taxes to share some features of gift taxes, by taxing some transfers which happen during the lifetime of the giver rather than on death. The UK, for example, subjects [...] "lifetime chargeable transfers" [...] (usually gifts to trusts) to inheritance tax.|$|R
50|$|Within Section I of the Court's opinion the Court {{sought to}} detail the {{provisions}} which outlined the requirements {{needed in order}} for an organization <b>to</b> be <b>exempt</b> <b>from</b> the <b>taxes</b> and receive tax-deductibles {{as stated in the}} Internal Revenue Code of 1954, specifically Section 501(c)(3).Additionally under the Internal Revenue Code of 1954, for organizations that had their 501(c)(3) status revoked, a provision allowed for litigation concerning the legality of the IRS's action after the assessment and attempted collection of taxes. A legal suit could also be brought forward in a federal District Court or in the Court of Claims following the collection of any federal tax and the denial of a refund by the IRS.|$|R
