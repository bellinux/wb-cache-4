5|$|In {{response}} to communist witch-hunts, many witnesses and employees {{chose to use}} <b>the</b> <b>fifth</b> <b>amendment</b> protection against self-incrimination to avoid divulging information about their political beliefs. Government agencies and private organizations, in response, established polices which inferred communist party membership for anyone who invoked <b>the</b> <b>fifth</b> <b>amendment.</b> The national ACLU was divided on whether to defend employees who had been fired merely for pleading <b>the</b> <b>fifth</b> <b>amendment,</b> but the New York affiliate successfully assisted teacher Harry Slochower in his Supreme Court case which reversed his termination.|$|E

5|$|According to Prof. Whittington, Cantril was {{the first}} {{challenge}} to a federal statute under the Due Process Clause of <b>the</b> <b>Fifth</b> <b>Amendment</b> to be considered by the Court. In later cases, the Court has noted the several possible holdings {{that could have been}} intended in Cantril.|$|E
50|$|The {{district}} court granted the injunction on January 15, 1980 {{and found that}} the Hyde <b>Amendments</b> violated <b>the</b> <b>Fifth</b> <b>Amendment's</b> Due Process clause and the First Amendment's Establishment clause.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Fifth</b> <b>Amendment's</b> {{right to}} counsel {{attaches}} upon invocation (i.e., when an attorney is requested). The Sixth Amendment's right to counsel attaches when adversarial proceedings begin (i.e., at the arraignment). The presumption in Jackson attempted to analogize <b>the</b> <b>Fifth</b> <b>Amendment's</b> right against self-incrimination through Edwards v. Arizona to the Sixth Amendment's right to counsel, essentially not allowing police interrogation after the right attached. Under Montejo, {{in the case}} where the Defendant has not asserted his <b>Fifth</b> <b>Amendment's</b> right to counsel but rather relies on his Sixth Amendment's right to counsel, police may reinitiate interrogation after his Miranda rights have been read. However, if a Defendant has asserted his <b>Fifth</b> <b>Amendment's</b> right to counsel and adversarial proceedings have begun, police may not reinitiate questioning without counsel present and waiver under Edwards, or unless the Defendant initiates the conversation and police get a waiver.|$|R

5|$|In its 1969 Leary v. United States {{decision}} the Supreme Court {{held the}} Marijuana Tax Act to be unconstitutional, since it violated <b>the</b> <b>Fifth</b> <b>Amendment</b> privilege against self-incrimination. In response, Congress passed the Controlled Substances Act as Title II of the Comprehensive Drug Abuse Prevention and Control Act of 1970, which repealed the Marijuana Tax Act.|$|E
5|$|In 1909, Liliʻuokalani {{brought an}} {{unsuccessful}} {{lawsuit against the}} United States under <b>the</b> <b>Fifth</b> <b>Amendment</b> seeking {{the return of the}} Hawaiian Crown Lands. The US courts invoked an 1864 Kingdom Supreme Court decision over a case involving the Dowager Queen Emma and Kamehameha V, using it against her. In this decision the courts found that the Crown Lands were not necessarily the private possession of the monarch in the strictest sense of the term.|$|E
5|$|In <b>the</b> <b>Fifth</b> <b>Amendment</b> to the Constitution of 1906, {{the lion}} and sun motif in {{the flag of}} Iran was {{described}} as a passant lion that holds a saber in its paw and with the sun in its background. A decree dated September 4, 1910 specified the exact details of the logo, including the lion's tail ("like an italic S"), the position {{and the size of the}} lion, his paw, the sword, and the sun.|$|E

50|$|Justice Reed {{based his}} {{decision}}, in part, on the Court's 1937 decision in Palko v.

5000|$|The truth is, the writ of {{habeas corpus}} shall not be suspended, and despite <b>the</b> <b>Fifth</b> <b>Amendment's</b> command that no person shall be {{deprived}} of life, liberty or property without due process of law, both of these constitutional safeguards were denied by military action under Executive Order 9066...|$|R
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Fifth</b> <b>Amendment</b> {{protects against}} double {{jeopardy}} and self-incrimination and guarantees {{the rights to}} due process, grand jury screening of criminal indictments, and compensation for the seizure of private property under eminent domain. The amendment {{was the basis for}} the court's decision in Miranda v. Arizona (1966), which established that defendants must be informed of their rights to an attorney and against self-incrimination prior to interrogation by police.|$|E
5|$|The Marshall Court also issued {{important}} opinions regarding criminal procedure. Although the Court did {{not explicitly}} cite or quote constitutional provisions, its opinions remain influential {{in interpreting the}} Double Jeopardy Clause of <b>the</b> <b>Fifth</b> <b>Amendment</b> and venue provision of Article Three. The Court also laid down the common law rules of evidence in federal courts, including the hearsay exception for party admissions and the narrowing of the best evidence rule.|$|E
5|$|The Vicinage clause has {{its roots}} in medieval English {{criminal}} procedure, the perceived abuses of criminal vicinage and venue during the colonial period and Anti-federalist objections to the United States Constitution. The clause {{is one of the few}} constitutional criminal procedure provisions that has not been incorporated to apply to proceedings in state courts, along with the Grand Jury Clause of <b>the</b> <b>Fifth</b> <b>Amendment</b> and (possibly) the Excessive Bail Clause of the Eighth Amendment.|$|E
5000|$|TWR {{brought their}} initial {{challenge}} before the United States District Court for the District of Columbia against the Commissioner of Internal Revenue, the Secretary of the Treasury, and the United States. TWR challenged the prohibition against substantial lobbying as violative of the First Amendment and {{the equal protection}} component of <b>the</b> <b>Fifth</b> <b>Amendment's</b> due process clause, and sought declaratory judgment that it qualified for the exemption granted by § 501(c)(3), claiming that § 501(c)(3)'s prohibition against substantial lobbying is unconstitutional under the First Amendment by imposing an [...] "unconstitutional burden" [...] on the receipt of tax-deductible contributions, and is also unconstitutional under the equal protection component of <b>the</b> <b>Fifth</b> <b>Amendment's</b> Due Process Clause because the Code permits taxpayers to deduct contributions to veterans' organizations that qualify for tax exemption under § 501(c)(19).|$|R
50|$|The Court {{only had}} the issue before it of whether government-induced {{temporary}} flooding was categorically exempt from the scope of <b>the</b> <b>Fifth</b> <b>Amendment's</b> Takings Clause. In a unanimous, eight-justice opinion delivered by Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, the Court ruled {{that there was no}} basis in its Takings Clause jurisprudence for such an exemption.|$|R
50|$|Although the Court {{held that}} {{evidence}} obtained {{in violation of}} substantive due process must be excluded in criminal prosecutions, the court declined to incorporate a broad exclusionary rule for all constitutional violations. Likewise, the Court left unanswered {{the question of whether}} evidence obtained through involuntary blood samples violates <b>the</b> <b>Fifth</b> <b>Amendment's</b> privilege against self incrimination.|$|R
5|$|A Miranda warning is an {{explanation}} of a suspect's rights that must be given by law enforcement before interrogation. It stems from the 1966 Miranda v. Arizona case, and is based primarily on <b>the</b> <b>Fifth</b> <b>Amendment</b> right against self-incrimination. If a defendant in custody is not notified of their rights via a Miranda warning, any confession they give may not be admissible in court. If a defendant is not in police custody, however, police are free to question suspects without informing them of their rights, and their statements may still be admissible.|$|E
5|$|Petit {{jury and}} venue provisionsboth {{traceable}} to enumerated complaints in the Declaration of Independenceare included in Article Three of the United States Constitution. More criminal procedure provisions {{are contained in}} the United States Bill of Rights, specifically the Fifth, Sixth, and Eighth Amendments. With {{the exception of the}} Grand Jury Clause of <b>the</b> <b>Fifth</b> <b>Amendment,</b> the Vicinage Clause of the Sixth Amendment, and (maybe) the Excessive Bail Clause of the Eighth Amendment, all of the criminal procedure provisions of the Bill of Rights have been incorporated to apply to the state governments.|$|E
5|$|Schmerber v. California, , was a {{landmark}} United States Supreme Court {{case in which}} the Court clarified the application of the Fourth Amendment's protection against warrantless searches and <b>the</b> <b>Fifth</b> <b>Amendment</b> privilege against self-incrimination for searches that intrude into the human body. Until Schmerber, the Supreme Court had not yet clarified whether state police officers must procure a search warrant before taking blood samples from criminal suspects. Likewise, the Court had not yet clarified whether blood evidence taken against the wishes of a criminal suspect may be used against that suspect {{in the course of a}} criminal prosecution.|$|E
50|$|Not all clauses of all {{amendments}} {{have been}} incorporated. For example, {{states are not}} required to obey <b>the</b> <b>Fifth</b> <b>Amendment's</b> requirement of indictment by grand jury. Many states choose to use preliminary hearings instead of grand juries. It is possible that future cases may incorporate additional clauses of the Bill of Rights against the states.|$|R
50|$|Twining v. New Jersey, 211 U.S. 78 (1908) was {{an early}} case of the U.S. Supreme Court. In this case, the Court {{established}} the Incorporation Doctrine by concluding that while certain rights enumerated in the Bill of Rights might apply to the states under the Fourteenth Amendment's Due Process Clause, <b>the</b> <b>Fifth</b> <b>Amendment's</b> right against self-incrimination is not incorporated.|$|R
5000|$|Ochoa v. Hernandez y Morales, : <b>the</b> <b>Fifth</b> <b>Amendment's</b> {{requirement}} that [...] "no person shall [...] [...] [...] {{be deprived of}} [...] [...] [...] property, without due process of law" [...] was held, by the Supreme Court, to apply in Puerto Rico, {{even though it was}} not a State and thus not [...] "part" [...] of the United States.|$|R
5|$|Some second-tier {{defendants}} {{were unable to}} post bail because the government refused to permit the Civil Rights Congress (CRC) legal defense fund to provide bail funding. The CRC had run afoul of the judicial system because it had posted bail for the 1949 trial defendants, and four of those defendants skipped bail in 1951. Leaders of the CRC were called {{before a grand jury}} and asked to identify the donors who had contributed money to the bail fund. Novelist Dashiell Hammett, a manager of the CRC fund, invoked <b>the</b> <b>Fifth</b> <b>Amendment,</b> refused to identify donors, and was sentenced to six months in prison.|$|E
5|$|United States v. Lanza {{was one of}} {{a series}} of cases {{involving}} Prohibition. Lanza committed acts allegedly in violation of both state and federal law, and was first convicted in Washington state court, then prosecuted in federal district court. He alleged the second prosecution in violation of the Double Jeopardy Clause of <b>the</b> <b>Fifth</b> <b>Amendment.</b> Taft, for a unanimous court, allowed the second prosecution, holding that the state and federal governments were dual sovereigns, each empowered to prosecute the conduct in question.|$|E
5|$|Hearings into Teapot Dome {{began in}} October 1923, after Harding's death. Fall had left office earlier that year, but he denied {{receiving}} any money from Sinclair or Doheny; Sinclair agreed. The following month, Walsh learned that Fall had spent lavishly on expanding and improving his New Mexico ranch. Fall reappeared {{and stated that}} the money had come as a loan from Harding's friend and The Washington Post publisher Edward B. McLean, but McLean denied it when he testified. Doheny told the committee that he had given Fall the money in cash as a personal loan out of regard for their past association, but Fall invoked <b>the</b> <b>Fifth</b> <b>Amendment</b> right against self-incrimination when he was compelled to appear again, rather than answer questions.|$|E

40|$|In Lynch v. Morales-Santana, the Supreme Court will {{consider}} whether the Immigration and Nationality Act’s physical presence requirement scheme violates <b>the</b> <b>Fifth</b> <b>Amendment’s</b> equal protection guarantee. Under 8 U. S. C. §§ 1401 (a) (7) and 1409 (c) (1952), an unwed U. S. citizen father wishing to convey citizenship at-birth to his child born abroad cannot do so unless {{he has been}} physically present in the United States for ten {{years prior to the}} child’s birth. In contrast, an unwed citizen mother only needs to be physically present for one continuous year. This commentary argues that because §§ 1401 and 1409 facially discriminate against unwed citizen fathers the Supreme Court should hold that the different physical presence requirements violate <b>the</b> <b>Fifth</b> <b>Amendment’s</b> equal protection guarantee. The Court should remedy this violation by applying the shorter one-year continuous presence requirement to both unwed citizen mothers and fathers...|$|R
50|$|Bravo-Fernandez v. United States, 580 U.S. ___ (2016), {{was a case}} {{in which}} the Supreme Court of the United States {{clarified}} the application of <b>the</b> <b>Fifth</b> <b>Amendment's</b> Double Jeopardy Clause to cases in which a jury returns irreconcilable verdicts that convict a defendant on one count and acquit a defendant on another count when both counts rely upon the same ultimate fact.|$|R
5|$|However, {{during the}} 1960s, the Court under Chief Justice Warren took the process much further, making almost all {{guarantees}} of the Bill of Rights binding upon the states. Thus, although the Court failed to accept Black's theory of total incorporation, {{the end result}} of its jurisprudence is very close to what Black advocated. Today, the only parts of the first eight amendments that have not been extended to the states are the Third and Seventh Amendments, the grand jury clause of <b>the</b> <b>Fifth</b> <b>Amendment,</b> the Eighth Amendment's protection against excessive bail, and the guarantee of the Sixth Amendment, as interpreted, that criminal juries be composed of 12 members and be unanimous in their verdicts.|$|E
5|$|In a 5–4 opinion, the Court {{held that}} forced {{extraction}} {{and analysis of}} a blood sample is not compelled testimony; therefore, it does not violate <b>the</b> <b>Fifth</b> <b>Amendment</b> privilege against self-incrimination. The Court also held that intrusions into the human body ordinarily require a search warrant. However, the Court ruled that the involuntary, warrantless blood sample taken {{in this case was}} justified under the Fourth Amendment's exigent circumstances exception because evidence of blood alcohol would be destroyed by the body's natural metabolic processes if the officers were to wait for a warrant. In 2013, the Supreme Court clarified in Missouri v. McNeely that the natural metabolism of alcohol in the bloodstream is not a per se exigency that would always justify warrantless blood tests of individuals suspected of driving under the influence of alcohol.|$|E
5|$|Lara then {{requested}} a rehearing en banc {{by the full}} court. The request was granted, and the full court reversed {{the decision of the}} three-judge panel, ordering that the federal indictment be dismissed on the grounds of double jeopardy. While the court noted that <b>the</b> <b>Fifth</b> <b>Amendment</b> allowed prosecution by two separate sovereigns, such as the federal government and a state government, it found that an Indian tribe derived its authority to prosecute offenders from the ICRA, which was federal law. The court noted that in previous Supreme Court rulings, the determination of tribal jurisdiction was based on the tribal membership of the individual, not on his race as an Indian. This meant that double jeopardy attached. The United States then appealed to the Supreme Court, which granted certiorari to hear the case.|$|E
50|$|In 1954 with Spottswood William Robinson III, he was {{the lead}} counsel on Bolling v. Sharpe, the {{companion}} case to Brown v. Board of Education.

Bolling was decided under <b>the</b> <b>Fifth</b> <b>Amendment's</b> due process clause while Brown was decided under the Fourteenth Amendment's Equal Protection Clause.|$|R

50|$|In some jurisdictions, persons {{detained}} {{under the}} doctrine of Terry must identify themselves to police upon request. In Hiibel v. Sixth Judicial District Court of Nevada, 542 U.S. 177 (2004), the Court held that a Nevada statute requiring such identification violated neither the Fourth Amendments prohibition against unreasonable searches and seizure nor, in the circumstances of that case, <b>the</b> <b>Fifth</b> <b>Amendments</b> privilege against self-incrimination.|$|R
