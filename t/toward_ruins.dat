50|$|The {{effect of}} a {{character}} assassination driven by an individual is not {{equal to that of}} a state-driven campaign.The state-sponsored destruction of reputations, fostered by political propaganda and cultural mechanisms, can have more far-reaching consequences. One of the earliest signs of a society's compliance to loosening the reins on the perpetration of crimes (and even massacres) with total impunity is when a government favors or directly encourages a campaign aimed at destroying the dignity and reputation of its adversaries, and the public accepts its allegations without question. The mobilisation <b>toward</b> <b>ruining</b> the reputation of adversaries is the prelude to the mobilisation of violence in order to annihilate them. Official dehumanisation has always preceded the physical assault of the victims.|$|R

50|$|Capitalist {{production}} collects {{the population}} together in great centres, and causes the urban population {{to achieve an}} ever-growing preponderance. This has two results. On the one hand it concentrates the historical motive force of society; on the other hand, it disturbs the metabolic interaction between man and the earth, i.e. it prevents the return to the soil of its constituent elements consumed by man {{in the form of}} food and clothing; hence it hinders the operation of the eternal natural condition for the lasting fertility of the soil...But by destroying the circumstances surrounding that metabolism...it compels its systematic restoration as a regulative law of social production, and in a form adequate to the full development of the human race...All progress in capitalist agriculture is a progress in the art, not only of robbing the worker, but of robbing the soil; all progress in increasing the fertility of the soil for a given time is a progress <b>toward</b> <b>ruining</b> the more long-lasting sources of that fertility...Capitalist production, therefore, only develops the techniques and the degree of combination of the social process of production by simultaneously undermining the original sources of all wealth—the soil and the worker.|$|R

50|$|The film shows DiCaprio visiting various {{regions of}} the globe {{exploring}} the impact of man-made global warming. As a narrator, DiCaprio comments these encounters as well as archive footages.

The film also documents, in part, the production of DiCaprio's 2015 film The Revenant.|$|R
60|$|In a {{few minutes}} more Magdalen {{was out in the}} east garden. The sky was clear and sunny; but the cold shadow of the house rested on the garden walk and chilled the midday air.

60|$|While thus talking we {{had been}} walking at a {{reasonably}} rapid pace <b>toward</b> the <b>ruins</b> of the arsenal, and were now arrived so near {{that it was possible}} to see the red-coated sentries pacing to and fro in front of the building. At one side a number of soldiers were bivouacked, probably that they might be on hand in case the prisoners attempted to rise against the keepers, and here, there, everywhere were curious ones--perhaps some interested as were we--gazing at the small building where were so many brave fellows, most likely penned up like cattle.|$|R

When the Penhoëls leave, he does not hesitate to cross swords with Robert, but he knows which side is bread is buttered and he makes up with Robert when they are thrown out by Pontalès.|$|R
60|$|Meanwhile the nearer {{splash of}} oars {{indicated}} {{the approach of}} the unseen boat. The broker had barely time to conceal himself behind the cabin before a number of uncouth-looking figures clambered up the hill <b>toward</b> the <b>ruined</b> rendezvous. They were dressed like the previous comer, who, as they passed through the open door, exchanged greetings with each in antique phraseology, bestowing at the same time some familiar nickname. Flash-in-the-Pan, Spitter-of-Frogs, Malmsey Butt, Latheyard Will, and Mark-the-Pinker, were the few sobriquets the broker remembered. Whether these titles were given to express some peculiarity of their owner he could not tell, for a silence followed as they slowly ranged themselves upon the floor of the cabin in a semicircle around their cadaverous host.|$|R

Finding that the Monster is unable to locate the notes of the long-dead doctor, Talbot seeks out Baroness Elsa Frankenstein (Ilona Massey) the daughter of Ludwig, posing as a potential buyer of the estate, hoping she knows their hiding place. She declines to assist Talbot, but the pair are invited to the [...] "Festival of the New Wine" [...] by the Burgomeister (Lionel Atwill).|$|R

When, soon after their marriage, she had by various means made it plain that {{he was expected to}} keep his distance and leave her largely to her own devices it had been a relief that he had fallen in with her views without protest, though it had been evident that it had grievously hurt him. Then his forbearance and apparent content with the situation had by degrees grown galling, and now, when at last he seemed inclined to assert himself, she was not displeased. It had, as she had admitted to Alison, begun to dawn on her that she had somehow never recognized her husband's good qualities, and that there were unexpected possibilities in the simple farmer. Besides this, she was seized with a fit of wholly genuine penitence.|$|R
