5|$|An atom can be ionized by {{removing}} {{one of its}} electrons. The electric charge causes <b>the</b> <b>trajectory</b> <b>of</b> an atom to bend when it passes through a magnetic field. The radius by which <b>the</b> <b>trajectory</b> <b>of</b> a moving ion is turned by the magnetic field {{is determined by the}} mass of the atom. The mass spectrometer uses this principle to measure the mass-to-charge ratio of ions. If a sample contains multiple isotopes, the mass spectrometer can determine the proportion of each isotope in the sample by measuring the intensity of the different beams of ions. Techniques to vaporize atoms include inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy and inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry, both of which use a plasma to vaporize samples for analysis.|$|E

5|$|Conversely, {{one might}} expect that {{inertial}} motions, once identified by observing the actual motions of bodies and making allowances for the external forces (such as electromagnetism or friction), {{can be used to}} define the geometry of space, as well as a time coordinate. However, there is an ambiguity once gravity comes into play. According to Newton's law of gravity, and independently verified by experiments such as that of Eötvös and its successors (see Eötvös experiment), there is a universality of free fall (also known as the weak equivalence principle, or the universal equality of inertial and passive-gravitational mass): <b>the</b> <b>trajectory</b> <b>of</b> a test body in free fall depends only on its position and initial speed, but not on any of its material properties. A simplified version of this is embodied in Einstein's elevator experiment, illustrated in the figure on the right: for an observer in a small enclosed room, it is impossible to decide, by mapping <b>the</b> <b>trajectory</b> <b>of</b> bodies such as a dropped ball, whether the room is at rest in a gravitational field, or in free space aboard a rocket that is accelerating at a rate equal to that of the gravitational field.|$|E
5|$|Crossing Madagascar {{for a third}} time, Elita closely {{followed}} <b>the</b> <b>trajectory</b> <b>of</b> its second passage, emerging into the Indian Ocean near Manakara on February3. Despite initial forecasts of re-intensification, Elita accelerated southeastward and lost its remaining convection, leaving its center exposed {{under the influence of}} a strong upper-level trough. The structure resembled a subtropical cyclone as the surface circulation became broader. Late on February4, the JTWC discontinued advisories, and the MFR classified Elita as an extratropical cyclone on the next day. For the next week, the remnants of Elita meandered to the southeast of Madagascar. On February11, the residual circulation tracked southwestward, only to accelerate southeastward away from the region on February13, when the MFR ceased monitoring the system.|$|E

5|$|Two {{established}} meteor showers {{originate from}} within Corvus' boundaries. German astronomer Cuno Hoffmeister discovered and named the Corvids in 1937, after observing them between June 25 and July 2.

The shower has been tentatively linked with 4015 Wilson–Harrington. In January 2013, the MO Video Meteor Network published the discovery of the Eta Corvids, assigning some 300 meteors seen between January 20 and 26. Their existence was confirmed by data analysis later that year.|$|E

5|$|Although entries of meteoroids into Earth's {{atmosphere}} {{are very}} common, recording a similar flight through the upper {{layers of the}} atmosphere is quite rare. Probably the first one reliably verified happened on 20 July 1860 above the American state of New York. The Czechoslovak–Polish fireball is sometimes compared to the 1972Great Daylight Fireball above Utah, the United States, and Alberta, Canada, {{which is the first}} scientifically observed and studied event of this type. The 1972 fireball was more than a thousand times as massive and it got 40km closer to Earth's surface. Observational data from both of them helped to develop a method for computing the grazing trajectories of such bodies, which was later used when calculating <b>the</b> <b>trajectory</b> <b>of</b> another Earth-grazing meteoroid, observed on 29 March 2006 above Japan.|$|E
5|$|Because the {{fireball}} {{was recorded}} by two cameras of the European Fireball Network, {{it was possible}} to calculate <b>the</b> <b>trajectory</b> <b>of</b> its flight through the atmosphere, and afterward also the characteristics of both its pre- and post-encounter orbit in the Solar System. The calculations were published by Czech astronomers Pavel Spurný, Zdeněk Ceplecha, and Jiří Borovička of the Ondřejov Observatory, who specialize in meteor observations. They demonstrated that the swing by the earth significantly altered the meteoroid's orbit. Its aphelion (the farthest it travels from the Sun) and orbital period were lowered to almost half of their original values. The object was initially in a highly inclined orbit (71°) and ended in an orbit with a slightly higher inclination (74°).|$|E

Political upheaval in the north, such as Wang Mang's usurpation, had caused Han migrants to resettle in the south. The Han Dynasty's military expansion widened its commercial ties in addition acquiring large amounts of new territories. The empire's conquest of Minyue and Nanyue spoke of its vast size that it bordered the ancient kingdoms of Southeast Asia.

The coffee crop was harvested prior to the arrival of the hurricane, though heavy rainfall and severe flooding ruined the crop for later years. Additionally, strong winds downed shading trees for the coffee crop on the southern peninsula. One official estimated it would require three years for the coffee crop to be replanted and regrown.|$|E
5|$|The {{development}} of the mass spectrometer allowed the mass of atoms to be measured with increased accuracy. The device uses a magnet to bend <b>the</b> <b>trajectory</b> <b>of</b> a beam of ions, {{and the amount of}} deflection is determined by the ratio of an atom's mass to its charge. The chemist Francis William Aston used this instrument to show that isotopes had different masses. The atomic mass of these isotopes varied by integer amounts, called the whole number rule. The explanation for these different isotopes awaited the discovery of the neutron, an uncharged particle with a mass similar to the proton, by the physicist James Chadwick in 1932. Isotopes were then explained as elements with the same number of protons, but different numbers of neutrons within the nucleus.|$|E
5|$|Wind {{tunnel and}} flight {{simulator}} {{tests were conducted}} to help to understand <b>the</b> <b>trajectory</b> <b>of</b> the aircraft after the engine detached and the left wing slats retracted. Those tests established that {{the damage to the}} wing's leading edge and retraction of the slats increased the stall speed of the left wing from 124 knots (143mph) to 159 knots (183mph). The DC-10 incorporates two warning devices that might have alerted the pilots to the impending stall: the slat disagreement warning light, which should have illuminated after the uncommanded retraction of the slats, and the stick shaker on the captain's control column, which activates close to the stall speed. Both of these warning devices were powered by an electric generator driven by the number one engine. Both systems became inoperative after the loss of that engine. The first officer's control column was not equipped with a stick shaker; the device was offered by McDonnell Douglas as an option for the first officer, but American Airlines chose not to have it installed on its DC-10 fleet. Stick shakers for both pilots became mandatory in response to this accident.|$|E
