30|$|A {{tentative}} quantification of the aminopropyl {{groups is}} based on thermogravimetry (Figure 3 b) and the available surface area (0.96 m 2 /g) of the ZnO wires, as calculated by the BET model from nitrogen sorption measurements (as reported in Additional file 1 : Figure S 1). The weight loss of the functionalized sample is slightly higher {{with respect to the}} sample with unfunctionalized ZnO, in particular, the first derivative of the <b>thermogravimetric</b> <b>curve</b> (DTG, red dot curve) shows a peak from 300 °C to 400 °C, indicative of the loss of organic materials. The weight loss in this temperature range can be generally attributed to the materials adsorbed or anchored to the ZnO surface, including the amine functionalizing agent. Calculation based on the weight loss of both samples returns a value of about 2 μmol/g of sample (0.37 mg/g) of organic material; thus, in absence of any contamination, one could assume this value as the maximum amount of aminopropyl group attached to the surface. By taking into account the value of specific surface area, the hypothetic maximum aminopropyl group density is about 0.38 mg/m 2 or 1.78 molecules/nm 2. From the <b>thermogravimetric</b> <b>curve,</b> we also calculated about 2.11 mg/g (2.19 mg/m 2) of hydroxyl groups on the bare ZnO surface (black curve), whereas after the functionalization with APTMS, the groups are reduced to 1.17 mg/g (1.22 mg/m 2). This decrease of hydroxyl group is clearly attributed to the effective anchoring of the aminopropyl groups to the ZnO surface, since an average of two/three methoxysilane ending groups of the APTMS molecule condense with the respective hydroxyl group on the ZnO surface during the functionalization reaction (Figure 1, left).|$|E
