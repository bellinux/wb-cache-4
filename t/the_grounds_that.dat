5|$|George Wimpey became Taylor Wimpey {{through a}} {{corporate}} merger and submitted an application in 2010 {{to build a}} further 15 homes on the site.

5|$|George's {{marriage}} to Sophia Dorothea was dissolved, not on <b>the</b> <b>grounds</b> <b>that</b> {{either of them}} had committed adultery, but on <b>the</b> <b>grounds</b> <b>that</b> Sophia Dorothea had abandoned her husband. With the agreement of her father, George had Sophia Dorothea imprisoned in Ahlden House in her native Celle, where she stayed until she died {{more than thirty years}} later. She was denied access to her children and father, forbidden to remarry and only allowed to walk unaccompanied within the mansion courtyard. She was, however, endowed with an income, establishment, and servants, and was allowed to ride in a carriage outside her castle, albeit under supervision. Melusine von der Schulenburg acted as George's hostess openly from 1698 until his death, and they had three daughters together, born in 1692, 1693 and 1701, respectively.|$|E

5|$|He was {{the only}} Republican senator {{to vote against the}} Freedom to Farm Act in 1996, saying that it catered to special {{interests}} rather than representing true reform of farm subsidies policy.

5|$|In 1891, German {{botanist}} Otto Kuntze {{challenged the}} generic name Banksia L.f., on <b>the</b> <b>grounds</b> <b>that</b> the name Banksia {{had previously been}} published in 1775 as Banksia J.R.Forst & G.Forst, referring to the genus now known as Pimelea.
