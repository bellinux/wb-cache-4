40|$|Abstract—As {{benchmark}} {{programs for}} microprocessor architectures, network-on-chip (NoC) <b>traffic</b> <b>patterns</b> are essential tools for NoC performance assessments and architecture explorations. The fidelity of NoC <b>traffic</b> <b>patterns</b> has profound influence on NoC studies. For the first time, {{this paper presents}} a realistic traffic benchmark suite, called MCSL, and the methodology used to generate it. The publicly released MCSL benchmark suite includes a set of realistic <b>traffic</b> <b>patterns</b> for 8 real applications and covers popular NoC architectures. It captures not only the communication behaviors in NoCs but also the temporal dependencies among them. MCSL benchmark suite can be easily incorporated into existing NoC simulators and significantly improve NoC simulation accuracy. We developed a systematic traffic generation methodology to create MCSL based on real applications. The methodology uses formal computational models to capture both communication and computation requirements of applications. It optimizes application mapping and scheduling to faithfully maximize overall system performance and utilization before extracting realistic <b>traffic</b> <b>patterns</b> through cycle-accurate simulations. Experiment results show that MCSL benchmark suite {{can be used to}} study NoC characteristics more accurately than traditional random <b>traffic</b> <b>patterns.</b> I...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—Recently, network coding {{has gained}} much {{popularity}} and several practical routing schemes {{have been proposed}} for wireless mesh networks that exploit interflow network coding for improved throughput. However, the evaluation of these protocols either assumed simple topologies and <b>traffic</b> <b>patterns</b> such as opposite flows along a single chain, or small, dense networks which have ample overhearing of each other’s transmissions in addition to many overlapping flows. In this paper, we seek to answer the fundamental question: how much performance benefit from network coding can be expected for general <b>traffic</b> <b>patterns</b> in a moderate-sized wireless mesh network? We approach this question via an empirical study of both coordinated and opportunistic coding based protocols subject to general <b>traffic</b> <b>patterns.</b> Our study shows the performance benefits under both types of coding for general <b>traffic</b> <b>patterns</b> are extremely limited. We then analyze and uncover fundamental reasons for the limited performance benefits. I...|$|R
