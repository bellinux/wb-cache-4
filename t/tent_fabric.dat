50|$|The basic dome has a {{rectangular}} floor and two poles which cross at the peak; each pole {{runs in a}} smooth curve from one bottom corner, up to the peak, and then down to the diagonally opposite bottom corner. There are usually special fittings at each corner which fit into sockets {{at the ends of}} each pole - pole tension keeps everything in shape. The poles can run on either the inside or outside of the <b>tent</b> <b>fabric.</b> When located on the interior, poles are held in place by a variety of means including hook and loop style straps, clips, and other fastening hardware. Poles that are located {{on the outside of the}} <b>tent</b> <b>fabric</b> are attached via fabric pole sleeves or plastic clips. Dome tents do not require guy ropes and pegs for structural integrity as they are considered free-standing, but must be pegged down in high winds.|$|E
50|$|A basic tunnel tent uses {{two or more}} {{flexible}} poles, arranged as parallel hoops, with <b>tent</b> <b>fabric</b> attached to form a half-cylinder or tapering tunnel. The most common designs have a sleeping area {{at one end and}} a vestibule area at the other, though vestibules (possibly extended) at each end are not uncommon, or vis-a-vis sleeping at either end and a central opening to a common vestibule area are made too.|$|E
5000|$|Both tents' {{panels and}} poles were {{inherited}} by Martha Washington's grandson, George Washington Parke Custis. He passed {{them on to}} his daughter, Mary Anna Custis Lee, and her husband, Robert E. Lee. Their enslaved housekeeper, Selina Norris Gray, kept the <b>tent</b> <b>fabric</b> safe when Union Army soldiers ransacked Arlington House during the American Civil War. The tents were among the Washington artifacts seized {{by the federal government}} in January 1862, and the grounds of Arlington House were converted into Arlington National Cemetery.|$|E
5000|$|Freeform / Stretch / Flex Tents have {{developed}} since 2000 driven predominantly by companies in South Africa and in Australia. The {{composition of the}} fabric differs slightly between those from South Africa and those in Australia. Stretch <b>Tent</b> <b>Fabrics</b> have been produced using Nylon and Polyester. Since 2007 Stretch Tents have been introduced into Europe {{by some of the}} South African companies such as Intent. Stretch Tents utilize aluminum, wooden and bamboo poles capped by molded polypropylene or rubber domes that push through the stretched fabric, creating tension between the ground and the fabric. The fabric can be sculpted into various organic and curvaceous forms to provide shade and rain cover for events. The tensioned fabric must be made rigid and the tent form allow water run-off and resistance to wind load before erection is complete.|$|R
50|$|Single skin (USA: single wall): Only one {{waterproof}} {{layer of}} fabric is used, comprising at least roof and walls. To minimize condensation {{on the inside}} of the tent, some expedition <b>tents</b> use waterproof/breathable <b>fabrics.</b>|$|R
25|$|Tent cities: Ad hoc campsites of {{tents and}} improvised shelters {{consisting}} of tarpaulins and blankets often near industrial and institutionally zoned real estate such as rail yards, highways and high transportation veins. A few more elaborate tent cities, such as Dignity Village, are actually hybrids of tent cities and shantytowns. Tent cities frequently consist only of <b>tents</b> and <b>fabric</b> improvised structures, with no semi-permanent wood structures at all.|$|R
5000|$|Fjällräven ( [...] , Swedish for Arctic fox) is a Swedish company specialising {{in outdoor}} equipment—mostly {{clothing}} and rucksacks. Fjällräven {{was founded in}} 1960 by Åke Nordin (1936 - 2013). The original product was an external frame rucksack. The Fjällräven rucksack proved comfortable, durable, and, along with outdoor clothing made from <b>tent</b> <b>fabric,</b> it made the brand well known in just a decade. The company has a strong market presence in the Nordic countries. It is also represented in other European countries, especially Germany. Among its more well-known products are Greenland jackets and various versions of the Kånken rucksack.|$|E
50|$|Tents are {{the most}} common form of shelter used on the mountain. These may vary from simple tarps to much heavier designs {{intended}} to withstand harsh mountain conditions. In exposed positions, windbreaks of snow or rock may be required to shelter the tent. One of the downsides to tenting is that high winds and snow loads can be dangerous and may ultimately lead to the tent's failure and collapse. In addition, the constant flapping of the <b>tent</b> <b>fabric</b> can hinder sleep and raise doubts about the security of the shelter. When choosing a tent, alpinists tend to rely on specialised mountaineering tents that are specifically designed for high winds and moderate to heavy snow loads. Tent stakes can be buried in the snow ("deadman") for extra security.|$|E
50|$|<b>Tent</b> <b>fabric</b> {{may be made}} of many {{materials}} including cotton (canvas), nylon, {{felt and}} polyester. Cotton absorbs water, so it can become very heavy when wet, but the associated swelling tends to block any minute holes so that wet cotton is more waterproof than dry cotton. Cotton tents were often treated with paraffin to enhance water resistance. Nylon and polyester are much lighter than cotton and do not absorb much water; with suitable coatings {{they can be very}} waterproof, but they tend to deteriorate over time due to a slow chemical breakdown caused by ultraviolet light. The most common treatments to make fabric waterproof are silicone impregnation or polyurethane coating. Since stitching makes tiny holes in a fabric seams are often sealed or taped to block these holes and maintain waterproofness, though in practice a carefully sewn seam can be waterproof.|$|E

50|$|With the Byzantine army crushed, Michael Dokeianos {{fell back}} to the port of Bari, {{requesting}} new reinforcements from Sicily. Instead, Dokeianos was transferred to Sicily and replaced by Exaugustus Boioannes. The victory at Montemaggiore provided the Normans with their first significant acquisition of war booty, including military equipment, horses, <b>tents,</b> precious <b>fabrics,</b> as well as gold and silver vessels. The enrichment of the soldiers in turn attracted more knights to join the rebellion. The 1041 Lombard-Norman revolt {{was followed by a}} third and final battle, the Battle of Montepeloso in September.|$|R

40|$|ExoBuilding {{explores the}} novel design space that emerges when an individual‟s {{physiological}} {{data and the}} fabric of building architecture are linked. In its current form ExoBuilding is a tent-like structure that externalises a person‟s physiological data in an immersive and visceral way. This is achieved by mapping abdominal breathing to its shape and size, displaying heart beat through sound and light effects and mapping electro dermal activity to a projection on the <b>tent</b> <b>fabric.</b> The research is positioned in relation to previous work and the iterative development of ExoBuilding from to-scale to full-size prototype is described. The design process, feedback gathered alongside and observations allow the discussion of wider issues: the different scales possible, the temporal nature of the data, ownership and ambiguity of that data, ranges of control and the aggregation of data in a building context. This leads to the presentation of {{directions for future research}} at this exciting boundary between Architecture, HCI and medical science...|$|E

50|$|The zipper {{may be used}} {{to secure}} an article of clothing, a <b>tent</b> or other <b>fabric</b> enclosure, luggage, or other soft container. Another popular method of {{securing}} clothing presses a thin and sharpened wire through the fabric using a brooch or safety pin. A buckle is used in place of a zipper at times. Buttons are another way to secure clothing, and require dexterous fingers to properly use. Snap fasteners (also named poppers and press studs) and the hook and loop fastener are a few less common zipper alternatives.|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: Concern has mounted {{over health}} effects caused by {{exposure}} to flame retardant additives used in consumer products. Significant research efforts have focused particularly on exposure to polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs) used in furniture and electronic applications. However, little attention has focused on applications in textiles, particularly textiles meeting a flammability standard known as CPAI- 84. In this study, we investigated flame retardant applications in camping tents that met CPAI- 84 standards by analyzing 11 samples of tent fabrics for chemical flame retardant additives. Furthermore, we investigated potential exposure by collecting paired samples of tent wipes and hand wipes from 27 individuals after tent setup. Of the 11 fabric samples analyzed, 10 contained flame retardant additives, which included tris(1, 3 -dichloroisopropyl) phosphate (TDCPP), decabromodiphenyl ether (BDE- 209), triphenyl phosphate, and tetrabromobisphenol-A. Flame retardant concentrations were discovered to {{be as high as}} 37. 5 mg/g (3. 8 % by weight) in the <b>tent</b> <b>fabric</b> samples, and TDCPP and BDE- 209 were the most frequently detected in these samples. We also observed a significant association betwee...|$|E
40|$|Thin-film {{photovoltaics}} (TFPV) on {{lightweight and}} flexible substrates offer {{the potential for}} very high solar array specific power (W/kg). ITN Energy Systems, Inc. (ITN) is developing flexible TFPV blanket technology that has potential for specific power greater than 2000 W/kg (including space coatings) {{that could result in}} solar array specific power between 150 and 500 W/kg, depending on array size, when mated with mechanical support structures specifically designed {{to take advantage of the}} lightweight and flexible substrates. (1) This level of specific power would far exceed the current state of the art for spacecraft PV power generation, and meet the needs for future spacecraft missions. (2) Furthermore the high specific power would also enable unmanned aircraft applications and balloon or high-altitude airship (HAA) applications, in addition to modular and quick deploying tents for surface assets or lunar base power, as a result of the high power density (W/sq m) and ability to be integrated into the balloon, HAA or <b>tent</b> <b>fabric.</b> ITN plans to achieve the high specific power by developing single-junction and two-terminal monolithic tandem-junction PV cells using thin-films of high-efficiency and radiation resistant CuInSe 2 (CIS) partnered with bandgap-tunable CIS-alloys with Ga (CIGS) or Al (CIAS) on novel lightweight and flexible substrates. Of the various thin-film technologies, single-junction and radiation resistant CIS and associated alloys with gallium, aluminum and sulfur have achieved the highest levels of TFPV device performance, with the best efficiency reaching 19. 5 % under AM 1. 5 illumination conditions and on thick glass substrates. (3) Thus, it is anticipated that single- and tandem-junction devices with flexible substrates and based on CIS and related alloys will achieve the highest levels of thin-film space and HAA solar array performance...|$|E
40|$|The {{selection}} of the best performing structural system (among steel, timber laminated, concrete, <b>fabric</b> <b>tents)</b> for medium span (30 - 50 m) sports halls and swimming pools in Greece formed the impetus for this research. Decision-making concerning {{selection of}} the structural system is difficult in this sector of construction, as was explained in the “Long Span Structures” conference (November 1990, Athens. Greece). From the literature {{it has been found}} that most building appraisals end up at the level of data analysis and draw conclusions on the individual aspects they investigate. These approaches usually focus on a fraction of the problem, examining it very deeply and theoretically. Their drawback is loss of comprehensiveness and ability to draw conclusions on an overall level and consequently being applicable to the existing conditions. Research on an inclusive level is sparse. In this particular research project, an inclusive appraisal approach was adopted, leading to the identification of three main variables: resources, human-user-satisfaction, and technical. Consequently, this led to a combination of purely quantitative and qualitative data. Case studies were conducted on existing buildings in order to assess the actual performance of the various alternative structural systems. This paper presents the procedure followed for the identification of the research variables and the focus {{on the development of the}} model of quantification. The latter is of vital importance if the problem of incompatibility of data is to be solved, overall relation of findings is to be achieved and holistic conclusions are to be drawn...|$|R
40|$|AbstractSports are an {{integral}} part of human life and their practice is a common pleasure among people all over the world. Once nature does not provide the required climate conditions for that to happen, humans can take action. Based on that concept, a consortium of three Dutch companies (Zwarts & Jansma Architects, Royal HaskoningDHV, and Polyned) presents a sharp, cool and innovative idea that can facilitate sport's industry in desert-covered areas; the Shaded Dome™. The Shaded Dome™ is a semi-permanent facility, comprised of an air-supported dome excluding any internal supports. A very light and highly resistant outer <b>fabric</b> <b>tent</b> (the Shade) covers it, transforming it into an astonishing state-of-the-art building. A grid of cavity struts links the two layers, creating a peripheral structural system that supports the whole structure. A pleasant internal microclimate is enabled by a constant natural airflow between the dome and the shade together with the use of a custom made combination of several membrane materials. This passive design element provides protection from extreme climatological conditions like solar radiation, wind, high air temperature, humidity and precipitation. The first real-scale models are already under development and the results are extremely encouraging. The current tests show an almost 20 oC temperature decline between the dome's skins, reducing consequently the need for high demanding cooling systems. Next to that the Shaded Dome™ requires limited transport volume, and can be constructed and dismantled in a matter of days. Thus, the preponderant fabrication plan promotes the sources’ economy, the efficient materials’ use, the reusability of the product and the self-support of its energy needs, highlighting that way a new concept on the asset management of future sport infrastructure. Moving into an era where the need for dynamic constructions is becoming more and more intense, the Shaded Dome™ can constitute an easy to build, quick and fit-for-purpose solution which can efficiently meet any sport infrastructure requirements...|$|R
