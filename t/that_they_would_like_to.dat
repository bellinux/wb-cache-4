5|$|In 1989, {{while doing}} {{promotion}} for the album, the band were asked what shows {{they would like}} to appear on. The band jokingly replied (possibly while intoxicated) <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> appear on Dance Party USA, since it was the most absurd option they could think of at the time. Much to their surprise, they were booked on the show, and made an appearance.|$|E

5|$|By 1875 {{encroachment}} on Malvern's wastelands by landowners {{had reached}} new heights and {{action was taken}} by the people of Malvern and the Commons Society to preserve the hills and common land and to prevent encroachment. Local lords of the manor indicated <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> give their rights to the wastes to the public. After preventing the enclosure of a common in 1882, negotiations were initiated with the owners of the northern hills and the first Malvern Hills Act was secured in parliament in 1884. Later Acts empowered the Malvern Hills Conservators to acquire land to prevent further encroachment on common land and by 1925 they had bought much of the manorial wastelands.|$|E

5|$|The episode makes {{references}} to Family Guy itself. When Bonnie, Lois and Cleveland's new girlfriend come to dance at The Drunken Clam, they state <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> make the bar their place to hang out, after Peter grabs Joe's gun and kills himself. It {{turns out that}} this was only Peter's imagination as he snaps out of it when Joe starts talking to him; Peter answers {{that he was having}} a Scrubs fantasy moment. Quagmire responds to Peter's moment by stating that Scrubs is the best show people are not watching. Cleveland replies that he hates shows that leave the story for a gag or joke, referring to the numerous cutaways Scrubs and Family Guy contain. While in the hospital Peter realizes that Mr. Pewterschmidt and Dr. Hartman have a similar voice, then Mr. Pewterschmidt comes into the room and they both start talking about how their voices sound alike; this is a reference to the show's creator Seth MacFarlane as he voices both characters.|$|E

Buffett stated that people need to “avoid at all cost” the initial, longer list, as it would hinder the achievement of the top-five.|$|E
25|$|Before any {{fighting}} resumed, {{some on the}} Chinese side {{sent out}} peace feelers {{to the court of}} Ava. The Burmese also sent signals <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> give diplomacy a chance, given their preoccupations in Siam. But the emperor, with Fuheng's encouragement, made it clear that no compromise with the Burmese could be made. The dignity of the state demanded a full surrender. His aim was to establish direct Qing rule over all Burmese possessions. Emissaries were sent to Siam and Laotian states informing them of the Chinese ambition and seeking an alliance.|$|E

25|$|The National Trust {{charged a}} private toll fee for navigation. Ten {{years after the}} re-opening, the Queen Mother {{performed}} the same ceremony for the Upper Avon Navigation, which had been derelict {{for more than a}} century, and the canal became part of a through route to the River Severn once more. In 1986, the National Trust indicated <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> hand control of the canal back to the British Waterways Board, and held discussions on 7 October 1986. The canal was transferred on 1 April 1988, authorised by an order of the Secretary of State, which provided £1.5 million, phased over five years, to enable the canal to be brought up to standard.|$|E
25|$|Realizing {{that the}} 17th Street Elementary school {{provided}} better books and educational benefits, Mendez {{and her husband}} Gonzalo, decided <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> have their children and nephews enrolled in there. Thus, in 1943, when her daughter Sylvia Mendez was only eight years old, she accompanied her aunt Sally Vidaurri, her brothers and cousins to enroll at the 17th Street Elementary School. Her aunt was told by school officials that her children, who had light skin, would be permitted to enroll - but that neither Sylvia Mendez nor her brothers would be allowed because they were dark-skinned and had a Hispanic surname. Mrs. Vidaurri {{stormed out of the}} school with her children, niece and nephews, and recounted her experience to her brother Gonzalo and her sister-in-law.|$|E

Malaysia Airlines reported <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> stress that at no point was the aircraft [...] "hijacked".

50|$|The bestial {{signs in}} the zodiac are Aries, Taurus, Leo and Capricorn. Because they {{are not able to}} express {{themselves}} in the manner <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>like,</b> <b>they</b> often become frustrated at their inability to fully communicate. Individuals strongly affected by these signs quite often have difficulty reading and writing as well as speaking, and therefore need extra tuition to help them to overcome those hurdles.|$|R
50|$|Many {{sporting}} {{and other}} events are unable to get the advertisers <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>like.</b> This is another form of remnant advertising.

500|$|The first artist {{given an}} {{official}} proposal to represent Greece in the 2005 contest was Sakis Rouvas, the Greek entrant in the 2004 contest. During {{a press conference}} on 15 June 2004 discussing plans for the 50th contest, the network announced <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> have him represent them again if he liked. ERT was expecting an answer by mid-July but Rouvas' response did not come until the 22nd of the month. He considered it, but ultimately felt that another artist should receive the opportunity. ESCToday mentioned that Rouvas' [...] "decision is expected to sadden Greek fans, who generally supported the idea of him competing again." [...] ERT would continue to ask Rouvas to represent them every year until he finally accepted again in 2009.|$|E

[...] He criticized McLachlan's [...] "monumental banality" [...] and summed the album up as [...] "renormalized pop at its most unnecessary." [...] A reviewer for Rolling Stone criticized the album's slow tempo, commenting that [...] "if you {{want a piece of}} her nirvana, you have to go along at her protracted, glacial pace." [...] They said that McLachlan is too [...] "rigid in her introspection" [...] and <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> hear her [...] "work up a good head of steam".|$|E
500|$|Much of Albert Victor's time at {{his post}} in Aldershot was spent drilling, which he disliked, {{though he did}} like to play polo. He passed his examinations, and in March 1887, he was posted to Hounslow where he was {{promoted}} to captain. He was given more public engagements, visited Ireland and Gibraltar, and opened the Hammersmith suspension bridge. Of his private life, a childhood friend of Albert Victor later recalled that it was uneventful: [...] "his brother officers had said <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>like</b> <b>to</b> make a man of the world of him. Into that world he refused to be initiated." [...] However, letters dated 1885 and 1886 from Albert Victor to his doctor at Aldershot (known only as [...] "Roche") detail that he was taking medicine for 'glete' (gleet), then a term for gonorrhea discharge.|$|E
