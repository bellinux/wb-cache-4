25|$|In 1851, William {{returned}} to London {{with his wife}} and two children (Frederick and Louise), on the occasion of The Great Exhibition. For the first time, Victoria met her future husband and, despite the age difference (she was eleven years old and he was nineteen), they got along very well. To promote the contact between the two, Queen Victoria and Prince Albert asked their daughter to guide Frederick through the exhibition, and during the visit the princess was able to converse in perfect German, while the prince was only able <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>words</b> in English. The meeting was therefore a success, and, years later, Prince Frederick would recall the positive impression that Victoria made on him during this visit, with her mixture of innocence, intellectual curiosity and simplicity.|$|E

Following the ceremony, a fiasco ensued, {{centered}} on the category for Outstanding Writing for a Drama Series. The West Wing episode [...] "In Excelsis Deo" [...] won, which was awarded to Sorkin and Rick Cleveland, while it was reported in a The New York Times article that Cleveland had been ushered off the stage by Sorkin without being given a chance <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>words.</b> The story behind The West Wing episode is based on Cleveland's father, a Korean war veteran who spent {{the last years of}} his life on the street, as Cleveland explains in his FreshYarn.com essay titled [...] "I Was the Dumb Looking Guy with the Wire-Rimmed Glasses". A back and forth took place between Sorkin and Cleveland in a public web forum at Mighty Big TV where Sorkin explained that he gives his writers [...] "Story By" [...] credit on a rotating basis [...] "by way of a gratuity" [...] and that he had thrown out Cleveland's script and started from scratch. In the end, Sorkin apologized to Cleveland. Cleveland and Sorkin also won the [...] at the 53rd Writer Guild of America Awards for [...] "In Excelsis Deo".|$|E

500|$|In her {{civilian}} identity, Barbara Gordon, Ph.D., {{is depicted}} as a career woman with a doctorate in library science, {{as well as being}} head of Gotham City public library, [...] "presumably one of the largest public libraries in the DC Comics version of reality." [...] She was given a regular backup slot in Detective Comics starting with issue #384 (February 1969), alternating issues with Robin until issue #404, after which she had the backup slot to herself. Frank Robbins wrote nearly all of these backups, which were penciled first by Gil Kane and later by Don Heck. Barbara Gordon’s Batgirl exceeded the earlier Bat-Girl and Batwoman characters in popularity, and readers requested for her to appear in other titles. Although some readers requested that Batwoman also continue to appear in publication, DC responded to the fan-based acclaim and criticism of the new character in an open letter in Detective Comics #417 (1971), stating: [...] "I'd like <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>words</b> about the reaction some readers have to Batgirl. These are readers who remember Batwoman and the other Bat-girls from years back... They were there because romance seemed to be needed in Batman's life. But thanks to the big change and a foresighted editor, these hapless females are gone for good. In their place stands a girl who is a capable crime-fighter, a far cry from Batwoman who constantly had to be rescued [...] Batman." ...|$|E
2500|$|French anatomist Henri Marie Ducrotay de Blainville {{published}} {{notes on}} Baartman's dissection in 1816, which were republished by Cuvier in the Memoires du Museum d'Histoire Naturelle in 1817. [...] "Her personality," [...] Cuvier wrote {{of her in}} his monograph, [...] "was lively, her memory good and, after a gap of some weeks, she recognised someone she had seen only the once. She spoke reasonable Dutch, which she had learned in The Cape, knew some English, and was beginning <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>words</b> in French. She danced according to the fashion of her own country, and played on the instrument they call the 'jew's harp' quite by ear ... her shoulders, back, and upper chest were graceful ... Her arms (rather slender) were very well-made, and her hand charming. Her foot was also very pretty..." [...] Despite his impressions of her, Cuvier interpreted her remains, in accordance with his theories on racial evolution, as evidencing ape-like traits. He thought her small ears {{were similar to those}} of an orangutan and also compared her vivacity, when alive, to the quickness of a monkey.|$|E
2500|$|Demobilized {{from the}} British army {{in late spring}} 1946, without money or job and despondent about his future, Norman {{followed}} the advice of Dr.Selig Brodetsky. Dr. H. Rosenblum, the editor of Haboker, a Tel Aviv daily that later became Yediot Aharonot, noted in late 1945 that Dr. Weizmann deeply resented the sudden intrusion and reception of Norman {{when he arrived in}} Britain. Norman spoke to the Zionist conference in London. [...] Haboker reported, [...] "Something similar happened at the Zionist conference in London. The Chairman suddenly announced to the meeting that in the hall there was Herzl's grandson who wanted <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> <b>words.</b> [...] The introduction was made in an absolutely dry and official way. [...] It was felt that the chairman looked for—and found—some stylistic formula which would satisfy the visitor without appearing too cordial to anybody among the audience. [...] In spite of that there was a great thrill in the hall when Norman mounted on the platform of the praesidium. [...] At that moment, Dr.Weizmann turned his back on the speaker and remained in this bodily and mental attitude until the guest had finished his speech." [...] The 1945 article went on to note that Norman was snubbed by Weizmann and by some in Israel during his visit because of ego, jealousy, vanity and their own personal ambitions. [...] Brodetsky was Chaim Weizman's principal ally and supporter in Britain.|$|E
