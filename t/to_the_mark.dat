The result of the game was another 0–0 tie, making it the seventh time in nine games the Panhandles were held scoreless. Chris Willis stated this tie was {{not as bad as}} the previous weeks because the Athletics had old players from the Akron Indians, a winning team in the Ohio League.|$|E

5|$|In 2006, Apple secured Taiwanese {{rights to}} the iPad mark from the Taiwanese company Proview Electronics; in China the iPad mark was still owned by the {{subsidiary}} of Proview Electronics, Shenzhen company Proview Technology, as of April 2012. Proview Technology sued Apple over the rights <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>mark</b> in China in 2011; Apple counter-sued but lost and then appealed, with the case before the Xicheng district court, where Proview claimed $1.6 billion USD in damages. Apple paid Proview approximately $53,000 – $55,000 for the mark in 2009. In February 2012, Proview sued Apple in the Santa Clara Superior Court, alleging several permutations of fraud (intentional misrepresentation, concealment, inducement) and unfair competition. Apple paid $60 million to Proview to end the dispute in a court-mediated settlement in the Higher People's Court of Guangdong province; the U.S. case {{was thrown out of}} court.|$|E
5|$|None of {{the three}} telescopes was constructed, {{although}} several design {{studies were carried out}} and some scale models were made. This was partly due to the changing political climate over the time (the period was from a Labour Party government under Harold Wilson to a Conservative Party one under Margaret Thatcher), and partly to the financial constraints of astronomical research in the UK at the time. Also, at a vital time, it became necessary to upgrade the Lovell Telescope <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Mark</b> IA, which subsequently overran in terms of cost.|$|E
5|$|The {{reductions}} were self-sufficient {{indigenous communities}} of 2,000–4,000 inhabitants, usually headed by two Jesuit priests and the cabildo (town council and cacique (tribal leader), who retained their functions {{and played the}} role of intermediaries between the native peoples and the Jesuits. However, {{the degree to which the}} Jesuits controlled the indigenous population for which they had responsibility and the degree to which they allowed indigenous culture to function is a matter of debate, and the social organization of the reductions have been variously described as jungle utopias on the one hand, to theocratic regimes of terror, the former description being much closer <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>mark.</b>|$|E

Jenny and Dean are brought into {{question}}ing; however Jenny tells Megan that Callum was giving it to her, to go on an art course. Samantha talks to Frank again, but when they question him about Irina {{but he does not}} know her. They find out that Irina was Callum's nurse, for his arthritis and that Callum was going to help Irina get her son from Belgrade to the US. Irina confesses that she did cut up Callum, but did not kill him. Irina found Callum dead, so cut him up so that she could forge the last immigration document to get her son to her as Callum had not finished it. Irina tells Megan where the head is, and they find a fracture on his head. Megan and Samantha go back to Callum’s apartment, and Megan demonstrates why Irina couldn’t have killed Callum due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>mark</b> on the wall being too high to be Irina. Megan traces metal to Callum's landlord, Mike Walsh (Kelly AuCoin). Samantha infers that because Cal was under rent control, Mike killed him so a paying client could stay in the apartment. Meanwhile, Lacey Fleming (Mary Mouser) asks if she can go to Megan's work, for a school project. Lacey arrives, and speaks with Dr. Kate Murphy (Jeri Ryan), discussing her work. Lacey tries to get Kate to allow her to see the body, however she refuses. Lacey speaks to Ethan, Curtis Brumfield (Windell Middlebrooks) and later Megan, who shows her pictures of bodies, telling her about her job.|$|E

25|$|The modem is {{sometimes}} called the terminal unit and is an electronic device which is connected between the teleprinter and the radio transceiver. The transmitting part of the modem converts the digital signal transmitted by the teleprinter or tape reader to {{one or the other}} of a pair of audio frequency tones, traditionally 2295/2125Hz (US) or 2125/1955Hz (Europe). One of the tones corresponds <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>mark</b> condition and the other to the space condition. These audio tones, then, modulate an SSB transmitter to produce the final audio-frequency shift keying (AFSK) radio frequency signal. Some transmitters are capable of direct frequency-shift keying (FSK) as they can directly accept the digital signal and change their transmitting frequency according <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>mark</b> or space input state. In this case the transmitting part of the modem is bypassed.|$|E

40|$|This study {{analyzes}} three unmarked-marked verbal pairs {{that exist}} in the Neo-Aramaic dialects of Christian Barwar and Christian Urmi. Each pair is analyzed for the opposing forms 2 ̆ 7 formal and functional differences, with an emphasis on function. It is argued that despite the fact that <b>the</b> morphemes affixed <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>marked</b> forms are aspectual prefixes, <b>the</b> <b>marked</b> forms 2 ̆ 7 main functional differences from their unmarked counterparts are pragmatic ones. Chapter I presents an introduction <b>to</b> <b>the</b> study, including information about the dialects analyzed and the study itself. Chapter II focuses on <b>the</b> <b>marked</b> forms that signal relationships between events in the discourse. This chapter first explores the unmarked qaṭəl form versus <b>the</b> <b>marked</b> bəd-qaṭəl form, wherein it is argued that <b>the</b> <b>marked</b> form signals <b>to</b> <b>the</b> listener <b>to</b> interpret <b>the</b> <b>marked</b> event in relation to another event in the nearby discourse. The same unmarked qaṭəl form is then presented in opposition <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>marked</b> i-qaṭəl form, and it is claimed that <b>the</b> <b>marked</b> form indicates a sequence-final event. Chapter III is an analysis of the unmarked qṭille form versus <b>the</b> <b>marked</b> qəm-qaṭəl form, and it is determined that <b>the</b> <b>marked</b> form is used <b>to</b> represent <b>the</b> event {{from the point of view}} of the object.
