60|$|The {{contrast}} between {{the interior of the}} town and its external aspect, was as striking as it was full of pain. With the exception of the dull high street, which had the usual characteristics of a small agricultural market town, some sombre mansions, a dingy inn, and a petty bourse, Marney mainly consisted of a variety of narrow and crowded lanes formed by cottages built of rubble, or unhewn stones without cement, and from age, or badness of the material, looking as if they could scarcely hold together. The gaping chinks admitted every blast; the leaning chimneys had lost half their original height; the rotten rafters were evidently misplaced; while in many instances the thatch, yawning in some parts to admit the wind and wet, and in all utterly unfit for its original purpose of giving protection from the weather, looked more like the top of a dunghill than a cottage. Before the doors of these dwellings, and often surrounding them, ran open drains full of animal and vegetable refuse, decomposing into disease, or sometimes in their imperfect course filling foul pits or spreading into stagnant pools, while a concentrated solution of every species of dissolving filth was allowed <b>to</b> <b>soak</b> <b>through</b> and thoroughly impregnate the walls and ground adjoining.|$|E
50|$|Onehunga is {{slightly}} unusual {{in that it}} has a substantial underground freshwater source, the Onehunga aquifer, which it owes <b>to</b> rainwater <b>soaking</b> <b>through</b> the lava flows around One Tree Hill. While most of drinking water of the Auckland area is drawn from reservoirs in the Hunua and Waitakere Ranges, around 5% is drawn from the Onehunga aquifer. The up to 20,000 m³ that are daily drawn from the source receive treatment in a local plant before being fed into the freshwater supply network. In contrast, while the waters of Western Springs also seep through the city's lava fields, they are no longer used as a source of drinking water.|$|R

Nash succumbed to his wounds on October 7 at a private residence near Kulpsville, Pennsylvania. His final words are alleged to have been [...] "From the first dawn of the Revolution I have been ever {{on the side of}} liberty and my country". He was buried in the Towamencin Mennonite Meetinghouse Cemetery in Towamencin Township, Pennsylvania, on October 9, 1777, along with other officers who had perished at Germantown. Most of the Continental Army's senior officers, including Washington himself, attended the funeral service. Nash's friend and colleague, Alexander Martin, who later became Governor of the State of North Carolina and who had witnessed Nash's wounding, subsequently composed a funeral poem in the fallen general's honor.|$|R

5|$|As it happened, the Japanese commander, Major General Masutaro Nakai of the 20th Division, {{had ordered}} a {{sizeable}} force {{to move to}} Kaiapit {{under the command of}} Major Yonekura Tsuneo. Yonekura's force included the 9th and 10th Companies of the 78th Infantry Regiment, the 5th Company of the 80th Infantry Regiment, a heavy machine-gun section, a signals section and an engineer company—a total of about 500 troops. From Kaiapit it was to threaten the Allied position at Nadzab, creating a diversion to allow the Japanese garrison at Lae time to escape. The main body left Yokopi in the Finisterre Range on 6 September but was delayed by heavy rains that forced the troops <b>to</b> move, <b>soaking</b> wet, <b>through</b> muddy water for much of the way. Only the advance party of this force had reached Kaiapit by 18 September, by which time Lae had already fallen. Yonekura's main body, moving by night to avoid being sighted by Allied aircraft, was by this time no further from Kaiapit than King, but had two rivers to cross. Since both were heading for the same objective, a clash was inevitable.|$|R

5000|$|Green planted roofs: A {{green roof}} is a roof that is {{partially}} or completely covered with vegetation {{and a growing}} medium, planted over a waterproofing membrane. A green roof typically consists of many layers, including an insulation layer; a waterproof membrane, often vinyl; a drainage layer, usually made of lightweight gravel, clay, or plastic; a geotextile or filter mat that allows water <b>to</b> <b>soak</b> <b>through</b> but prevents erosion of fine soil particles; a growing medium; plants; and, sometimes, a wind blanket. Green roofs are classified as either intensive or extensive, depending on the depth of planting medium and amount of maintenance required. Traditional roof gardens, which are labor-intensive and require a reasonable depth of soil to grow large plants are considered intensive, while extensive green roofs are nearly self-sustaining and require less maintenance.|$|E
5000|$|Road {{slipperiness}} {{can contribute}} to car accidents. In 1997, over 53,000 accidents were caused by slippery roads in the United Kingdom out of an estimated 4,000,000 accidents (or approximately 1.3 per cent) [...] A small change in road slipperiness can have a drastic effect on surface friction: decreasing the coefficient of friction from 0.45 to 0.35, equivalent to adding a dusting of wet snow, increased the accident rate by almost 1000%. As such, road agencies {{have a number of}} approaches to decreasing road slipperiness. Most roads are designed with a convex camber to provide sufficient drainage, thereby allowing surface water to drain out of the road. Trouble sections include entrances and exits of banked outercurves, where the cross slope is close to zero. Unless these sections have a longitudinal grade of at least 0.4-0.5%, the drainage gradient (resultant to crossfall and longitudinal grade) will be lower than 0.5% so water will not run off the road surface. Storm drains may be installed at regular intervals and modern paving materials are designed to provide high friction in most conditions. Permeable paving allows water <b>to</b> <b>soak</b> <b>through</b> the paving material, reducing slipperiness in very adverse conditions.|$|E
40|$|There are a {{great number}} of {{architectural}} styles that are readily adapted to the small houses of Nebraska. There are certain elements that must be taken into consideration: It is highly desirable that the roofs have enough pitch that the rains of summer and the snows of winter will not remain on the roof long enough <b>to</b> <b>soak</b> <b>through</b> and ruin the plaster beneath. The walls should be thick enough or well enough insulated so that a minimum of heat will be required in winter and to provide protection for the natural heat in summer. The source of building materials is an important item to Nebraskans. Lumber is the most economical material because of its unlimited supply from nearby sources and the multitude of uses to which it can be put. In certain sections of the country stone can be procured and in practically all parts of the country brick can be made to economical advantage. The American often wants to enjoy the freedom of suburban or country life, but he wants, at the same time, all the conveniences of the city dweller. As things stand now, it is difficult to give him both at a price he can pay. It is our problem, then, to devise a plan that will give the average Nebraskan a private house and garden, together with cooperative utilities and services, at a total cost within his means.

40|$|Introduction: The fern {{test was}} first {{described}} by Kardos and Tamasi in 1955 {{as a test}} used to determine rupture of amniotic membranes. The test is done by collection of fluid from the vagina which is then allowed to dry for 10 minutes on a slide. The slide is then inspected with microscopy for evidence of ferning. Accurate determination of rupture of membranes is important due to its significant implications on the management of obstetrical patients. Case: EC is a 23 year old G 1 P 0 at 40 and 3 / 7 weeks gestation who presented to an outpatient facility with a chief complaint of vaginal fluid leaking. Approximately 12 hours prior she had leaked sufficient vaginal fluid to wet her underwear, but not sufficient <b>to</b> <b>soak</b> <b>through</b> her pants. She denied loss of vaginal fluid since then. A speculum exam revealed {{a small amount of}} pooling in the vaginal vault. A sample of this fluid was obtained. Fern test was negative and vaginal pH was 4. 5. Her history was concerning for premature rupture of membranes (PROM) so she was further evaluated with an Amnisure test which was positive. She was subsequently admitted with PROM for induction of labor. Discussion: The fern test has been noted to have a sensitivity as high as 100 %, with most studies reporting a sensitivity at least 90 % or greater. These statistics can be very misleading as most of these studies were done in patients who were in labor. The sensitivity of the fern test is much lower in patients who are not in labor. A more recent study reported a sensitivity of 51 % and a specificity of 70 % for detecting PROM in patients who were not in labor. It was noted that sensitivity was slightly higher and specificity slightly lower for medical students and residents when compared to gynecologists. The sensitivity of the Amnisure test has been reported to be 98 % to 99 % with specificity ranging from 88 % to 100 %. Rupture of membranes has previously been diagnosed either by visualization of fluid leaking from the cervical os or having 2 of the following: vaginal pooling, positive fern test, or positive nitrazine test. Conclusion: The fern test is only one of several methods {{that can be used to}} assess rupture of membranes. Base on this recent study, ferning should not be relied on to rule out rupture of membranes in a nonlaboring patient with clinical history suspicious for PROM...|$|E
