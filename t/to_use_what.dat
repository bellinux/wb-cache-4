U.S. Route104 was assigned to all of Ridge Road , replacing then-NY31 west of Rochester. As a result, NY31 was shifted southward onto most of NY3 from Niagara Falls to Rochester, including between Middleport and Medina. NY31 was realigned on January1, 1949, to follow its current alignment between the two villages. The former routing of NY31 was redesignated as NY31E, a northerly alternate route of NY31.|$|E

5|$|In 1908, the New York State Legislature created Route36, an {{unsigned}} legislative route {{extending from}} Owego to Seneca Falls via Ovid. From Ovid north to Seneca Falls, Route36 followed {{what is now}} NY414 (via NY96 and County Route148 or CR148 in Romulus). The portion of modern NY414 between Watkins Glen and Ovid became Route45 on June16, 1911; however, the route was realigned one year later <b>to</b> <b>use</b> <b>what</b> is now NY96A from Lodi to Interlaken instead. When {{the first set of}} posted routes in New York were assigned in 1924, the Owego–Interlaken and Ovid–Romulus segments of legislative Route36 became part of NY15, which continued northwest from Romulus to Rochester. From Interlaken to Ovid, NY15 initially followed the post-1912 alignment of legislative Route45 to Lodi and the pre-1912 routing of Route45 to Ovid.|$|E

Here, NY66 turned onto what is now CR9 and proceeded north to Ghent, where it joined its modern alignment. On its north end, NY66 originally ended at NY45 (now NY43) {{just south of the}} Sand Lake town line.
