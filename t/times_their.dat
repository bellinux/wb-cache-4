5|$|After Hogg's father died, {{he had to}} {{opportunity}} to move into his family home north of London. Although he initially considered doing so, he chose to stay in London due to the expense that maintaining a large home would involve.

The family led a quiet and stable life together, though at <b>times</b> <b>their</b> finances were strained.|$|E

5|$|Hydrogen sponge alloys {{can contain}} lanthanum. These alloys {{are capable of}} storing up to 400 <b>times</b> <b>their</b> own volume of {{hydrogen}} gas in a reversible adsorption process.

5|$|In February 1996 it was {{reported}} that a survey of 19 countries by the World Economic Forum magazine World Link had found that political leaders and senior civil servants of Singapore had the highest salaries. The pay of the Singapore Prime Minister (S$1.1 million, or US$812,858) was almost five times the average pay of the chief political executives of the nations surveyed (US$168,291). Senior civil servants were paid US$292,714, almost three <b>times</b> <b>their</b> counterparts' average pay.|$|E

5|$|Nuthatches are omnivorous, eating mostly insects, {{nuts and}} seeds. They forage for insects hidden in or under bark by {{climbing}} along tree trunks and branches, sometimes upside-down. They forage within their territories when breeding, {{but they may}} join mixed feeding flocks at other <b>times.</b> <b>Their</b> habit of wedging a large food item in a crevice and then hacking at it with their strong bills gives this group its English name.|$|E
5|$|Royal Navy Lynxes {{worked in}} {{combination}} with US Seahawks during the Gulf War. The American helicopters lacked an effective anti-ship missile, but had superior surveillance capability compared to the British Lynx. They would locate hostile boats for the British helicopters, which would then attack the target with its Sea Skua missiles. In total, Lynx helicopters flew nearly 600sorties during the Gulf War, while their crews and engineers maintained flying rates three <b>times</b> <b>their</b> norm.|$|E
5|$|Some insects, {{occupying the}} {{biological}} niches that they do, {{need to be}} incredibly maneuverable. They must find their food in tight spaces and be capable of escaping larger predators – or they may themselves be predators, and need to capture prey. Their maneuverability, from an aerodynamic viewpoint, is provided by high lift and thrust forces. Typical insect fliers can attain lift forces up to three <b>times</b> <b>their</b> weight and horizontal thrust forces up to five <b>times</b> <b>their</b> weight. There are two substantially different insect flight mechanisms, and {{each has its own}} advantages and disadvantages – just because odonates have a more primitive flight mechanism does not mean they are less able fliers; they are, in certain ways, more agile than anything that has evolved afterward.|$|E

5|$|Barcelona had {{previously}} played 36 Copa del Rey Finals, a record bettered only by Real Madrid with 39. However, Barcelona {{had won the}} competition a record 26 <b>times.</b> <b>Their</b> most recent appearance in the final was the previous year's edition, in which they lost 12 to Real Madrid at the Mestalla in Valencia. Their most recent win was in 2012, beating Athletic Bilbao 30 at the Vicente Calderón Stadium in Madrid. Their only previous final at the Camp Nou was a victory in 1963. The last team to play a Copa del Rey Final at their own ground was Real Madrid, who lost in 2013 to Atlético Madrid and 2002 to Deportivo de La Coruña at their Santiago Bernabéu Stadium.|$|E
5|$|Bulkers are {{designed}} to be easy to build and to store cargo efficiently. To facilitate construction, bulkers are built with a single hull curvature. Also, while a bulbous bow allows a ship to move more efficiently through the water, designers lean towards simple vertical bows on larger ships. Full hulls, with large block coefficients, are almost universal, and as a result, bulkers are inherently slow. This is offset by their efficiency. Comparing a ship's carrying capacity in terms of deadweight tonnage to its weight when empty is one way to measure its efficiency. A small Handymax ship can carry five times its weight. In larger designs, this efficiency is even more pronounced: Capesize vessels can carry more than eight <b>times</b> <b>their</b> weight.|$|E
5|$|Each of {{the eight}} legs of a spider {{consists}} of seven distinct parts. The part closest to and attaching the leg to the cephalothorax is the coxa; the next segment is the short trochanter that works as a hinge for the following long segment, the femur; next is the spider's knee, the patella, which acts as the hinge for the tibia; the metatarsus is next, and it connects the tibia to the tarsus (which may {{be thought of as}} a foot of sorts); the tarsus ends in a claw made up of either two or three points, depending on the family to which the spider belongs. Although all arthropods use muscles attached to the inside of the exoskeleton to flex their limbs, spiders and a few other groups still use hydraulic pressure to extend them, a system inherited from their pre-arthropod ancestors. The only extensor muscles in spider legs are located in the three hip joints (bordering the coxa and the trochanter). As a result, a spider with a punctured cephalothorax cannot extend its legs, and the legs of dead spiders curl up. Spiders can generate pressures up to eight <b>times</b> <b>their</b> resting level to extend their legs, and jumping spiders can jump up to 50 <b>times</b> <b>their</b> own length by suddenly increasing the blood pressure in the third or fourth pair of legs. Although larger spiders use hydraulics to straighten their legs, unlike smaller jumping spiders they depend on their flexor muscles to generate the propulsive force for their jumps.|$|E

5|$|Early investors earned {{three to}} four <b>times</b> <b>their</b> money back due to {{increasing}} property values in Southern California, high occupancy rates, and increasing storage rental prices. By the mid-1980s, Public Storage was raising $200 to $300 million in investments each year. The RELP format allowed the firm to continue building more locations in the 1970s and 1980s {{when most of the}} industry had halted growth because of higher interest rates on loans. In the mid-1980s, co-founder Volk retired and his interest in Public Storage was purchased by Hughes. Forbes estimated that by this time the company was worth $800 million.|$|E
5|$|For {{security}} reasons, GCHQ {{moved its}} own computers and technical infrastructure to the Doughnut, which caused {{the cost of}} its move to increase from £41m to £450m over two years. The moves of MI5 and the SIS to new buildings had also cost more than three <b>times</b> <b>their</b> original estimates due to issues with transferring computers. HM Treasury paid £216m toward a newly agreed budget of £308m, having initially refused to finance the original high figure. The final cost of GCHQ's move to their new headquarters was more than seven times the original estimate.|$|E
5|$|From 2000 to 2002, the Lakers, led by Shaquille O'Neal and Kobe Bryant, {{won three}} {{straight}} NBA Championships. O'Neal won the finals MVP all three <b>times.</b> <b>Their</b> first championship {{came at the}} expense of the Indiana Pacers, whom the Lakers defeated in 6 games. During their 2001 postseason run, the Lakers swept their first 3 series and won the Finals in 5 games, finishing with an unprecedented 15–1 record, the best postseason record in NBA history. Their opponent in the Finals that year were the Philadelphia 76ers, led by Allen Iverson. In the 2002 NBA Finals, the Lakers swept the New Jersey Nets, leading almost the entire time in each game; only for a short while after the beginning of Game 4 did the New Jersey Nets gain any significant lead in any game.|$|E
