The paper explores the antecedents of managerial ideology and the logic to how and why <b>trade</b> <b>unions</b> are opposed. It concludes that as ideology drives managerial decollectivising strategies, lessons can be learnt for future union organisin...|$|R

40|$|Much of the {{literature}} on the relationship between <b>trade</b> <b>union</b> members and their union assumes that the gender of the member influences this relationship in a number of ways. Using survey data of members of one white-collar union, we test this proposition, focusing specifically on the impact of gender on attitudes towards trade unionism. participation in <b>trade</b> <b>union</b> activities, and priorities for <b>trade</b> <b>union</b> action. We conclude that, with the exception of relative weightings of priorities, gender is not a significant influence on these variables. A number of gender-related differences within <b>trade</b> <b>unions</b> are readily discernible. The Australian Bureau of Statistics data on <b>trade</b> <b>unions</b> shows a 1986 unionization rate of 63 per cent for male employees and 44 per cent for female employees (ABS 1986), and the proportion of official union positions held by females is substantially less than the female share of total, membership (Horsley et al. 1980; Wilkinson 1983).
