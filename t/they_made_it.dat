5|$|A poor {{start to}} the 1966–67 season {{prevented}} another push for the title, and Leeds eventually finished in fourth place. <b>They</b> <b>made</b> <b>it</b> to the FA Cup semi-finals, before Chelsea knocked them out with a 1–0 win. In Europe they beat DWS (Netherlands), Valencia (Spain), Bologna (Italy) and Kilmarnock (Scotland) to reach the Inter-Cities Fairs Cup final against Dinamo Zagreb (Yugoslavia); Zagreb won 2–0 at the Stadion Maksimir and held Leeds to a 0–0 draw at Elland Road to leave Leeds with another second-place finish.|$|E

5|$|In 1944, Hilliard {{returned}} to entertainment acoustics with Altec Lansing. Improving on the Shearer Horn System, Hilliard worked with Jim Lansing and Blackie Blackburn {{to develop the}} loudspeaker system of the 20th century: the Voice of the Theatre (VOTT). Arriving in the marketplace in 1945, it offered better coherence and clarity at high power levels. The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences immediately began testing its sonic characteristics; <b>they</b> <b>made</b> <b>it</b> the movie theater industry standard in 1955. Production of the long-lived VOTT continued into the 1990s.|$|E
5|$|John Palliser {{crossed the}} Rockies through a pass in 1858 {{that led to}} the {{headwaters}} of the Palliser River, a tributary of the Kootenay River now named in his honor. (However, at first, his party referred to it as Palliser's River.) His expedition made it downstream to Columbia Lake, but had some trouble making their way back to Alberta; the return route that they had chosen proved too dangerous to negotiate. After trading for some horses and new supplies from a band of Ktunaxa, <b>they</b> <b>made</b> <b>it</b> back over the Rockies later that year through North Kootenay Pass near Lower and Upper Kananaskis Lakes, after traveling up the Elk River.|$|E
5|$|Martin {{played in}} his third Canadian Olympic Trials in 2005. The event was a {{disappointment}} for the team, which finished with a 4–5 record. However, later in the season, <b>they</b> <b>made</b> <b>it</b> to the 2006 Tim Hortons Brier, Martin's first Brier appearance in six years. The team finished the round robin tied in second place with an 8–3 record. However, in the page playoff 3 vs. 4 game, Martin's rink was edged by Nova Scotia's Mark Dacey 8–7. The team would later win the 2006 Canada Cup of Curling.|$|E

5|$|Although Zahir was {{bereft of}} friends in Istanbul and Damascus, he was forging a new {{alliance}} with the increasingly autonomous Mamluk ruler of Egypt and the Hejaz, Ali Bey al-Kabir. Ali Bey shared a common interest with Zahir to subdue Damascus as he sought to extend his influence to Syria for strategic purposes vis-a-vis his conflict with the Sublime Porte. He had dispatched 15,000-20,000 Egyptian troops to the port cities of Gaza and Jaffa under commander Ismail Bey. Together, Zahir and Ismail crossed the Jordan Valley with their armies and moved north toward Damascus. <b>They</b> <b>made</b> <b>it</b> as far as Muzayrib, but Ismail abruptly halted his army's advance after confronting Uthman Pasha as he was leading the Hajj caravan {{in order to avoid}} harming the Muslim pilgrims. Ismail considered attacking the governor at that point to be a grave religious offense. He subsequently withdrew to Jaffa.|$|E
5|$|Murray next competed at the London 2012 Summer Olympics in singles, doubles, {{and mixed}} doubles. He partnered his brother Jamie Murray in doubles and {{suffered}} a first-round exit to Austria (Jürgen Melzer and Alexander Peya) in three sets. In the mixed doubles, Murray was partnered by Laura Robson. <b>They</b> <b>made</b> <b>it</b> {{all the way}} to the finals where they lost to the Belarusian top seeds (Victoria Azarenka and Max Mirnyi) in three sets, settling for the silver medal. In singles, Murray lost only one set on his way to the finals where he met Federer, defeating him in straight sets, for the loss of just 7 games. By winning the Olympic gold medal, Murray became the first British man to win the Olympic singles gold medal in tennis since Josiah Ritchie in 1908, and only the 7th man in the open era to win two medals at the same Olympic Games.|$|E
5|$|Pugliese {{then joined}} the Buffalo, New York-based National Wrestling Federation (NWF). Once again, he found success teaming with Dominic DeNucci. The pair competed {{in a tournament}} for the vacant NWF World Tag Team Championship in January 1972; <b>they</b> <b>made</b> <b>it</b> to the final round but lost to the team of Mitsu Arakawa and Yoshino Sato. Pugliese and DeNucci {{continued}} to challenge for the title, and they defeated Arakawa and Sato in March to win the belts. They dropped the belts to Don and Johnny Fargo in May but regained them in a rematch the same month. Later that month, however, the Fargos regained the belts. Pugliese and DeNucci were unable to regain them, but Pugliese teamed up with Luis Martinez to win the title in December. Records are unclear as to whom they won the belts from and how they lost them.|$|E

5|$|Rocksteady {{intended}} for Batman, Catwoman, and Robin to offer three different playing experiences. Other villains from Batman's comic history {{were selected to}} show that the prison was a melting pot of people from Gotham. The developers believed that providing a small part of each villain's story rather than focusing on a select few allowed the player to meet many more characters and effectively conveyed the feeling of being in a superprison filled with supervillains. Rocksteady decided early on that the Joker would die in the story, and developed the idea of him poisoning Batman with the same affliction, in order to show how the two diametrically opposed characters would interact in pursuit of a shared goal. Warner Bros. and Dini did not oppose killing off the character {{as long as it was}} not done for shock value, and as long as <b>they</b> <b>made</b> <b>it</b> clear that Batman was not at fault, since he would not intentionally kill someone.|$|E
5|$|Seeking {{to improve}} his team's fortunes, Fletcher made several moves over the {{following}} seasons to rework the Flames roster. His goaltending tandem of Bouchard and Myre had begun to feud with each other by the 1977–78 season as both sought more playing time. Fletcher responded by naming Bouchard his number one goaltender and trading Myre to the St. Louis Blues for three players. <b>They</b> <b>made</b> <b>it</b> into the playoffs again but were the only team to fall to a team with fewer points than them, the Detroit Red Wings, in a best-of-three series, 2 games to 0. In March 1979, Fletcher completed an eight player trade that sent franchise-leading scorer Tom Lysiak and four players to the Chicago Black Hawks for three players, led by defenseman Phil Russell. Fletcher hoped that the addition of Russell would help his team achieve playoff success.|$|E
5|$|The Red Wings {{returned}} to the playoffs in 1984 where they suffered a first round defeat to the St. Louis Blues. In the 32 seasons since then they have made the playoffs 30 times, including 25 consecutive seasons from 1991 to 2016. They {{returned to}} the Finals {{for the first time}} since 1966 in 1995 where they were swept by the New Jersey Devils in four games. However, in 1997 <b>they</b> <b>made</b> <b>it</b> back to the Finals, winning the series in four straight games over the Philadelphia Flyers. They repeated as champions in the following season with a four-game sweep of the Washington Capitals. Their most recent championships were in 2002 and 2008, with their most recent Finals appearance in 2009 where they lost to the Pittsburgh Penguins.|$|E

5|$|The {{official}} {{investigation by}} the FBI was aided by another prisoner, Allen West, {{who was part of}} the escapees' group but was left behind. West's false wall kept slipping so he held it in place with cement, which set. When Morris and the Anglins accelerated the schedule, West desperately chipped away at the wall, {{but by the time he}} got out, his companions were gone. Articles belonging to the prisoners, including plywood paddles and parts of the raincoat raft were discovered on nearby Angel Island. The FBI's investigation from 1962 to December 1979 was finally treated as closed. The official report on the escape concludes that the prisoners drowned in the cold waters of the bay while trying to reach the mainland, it being unlikely that <b>they</b> <b>made</b> <b>it</b> the 1.25 miles to shore due to the strong ocean currents and the cold sea water temperatures ranging between 50 and 55 degrees Fahrenheit.|$|E
5|$|Villadarias {{decided to}} send a force of 2,000 men– {{nearly a third of}} his entire army– divided into two groups: an initial force of 500 to seize the heights at night, {{followed}} by a further 1,500 the following daybreak. The first 500 set off at dusk on 11 November, led by a Colonel Figueroa and guided by Simón Susarte. <b>They</b> <b>made</b> <b>it</b> {{to the top of the}} Rock, reaching its southernmost peak near where O'Hara's Battery stands today, and descended part-way down the west side where they sheltered overnight in St. Michael's Cave. At daybreak they climbed the Philip II Wall, which extends up the west side of the Rock, and killed the English sentries in the lookout point at Middle Hill. A drummer boy bringing food to the lookout saw the invaders and raised the alarm.|$|E

So I felt like, well, I've finally got this thing going but it's dead. Flood and I had to record Broken under a {{different}} band name, because if TVT found out we were recording, they could confiscate all our shit and release it. Jimmy Iovine got involved with Interscope, and we kind of got slave-traded. It wasn't my doing. I didn't know anything about Interscope. And I was real pissed off at him at first because it was going from one bad situation to potentially another one. But Interscope went into it like they really wanted to know what I wanted. It was good, after I put my raving lunatic act on.|$|E
