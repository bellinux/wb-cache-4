5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Commission</b> <b>has,</b> and {{continues}} to, also {{provide support for}} war graves outside its traditional mandate. In 1982, the British Ministry of Defence requested the Commission's assistance to design and construct cemeteries in the Falkland Islands for those killed during the Falklands War. Although these cemeteries are not Commonwealth War Graves Commission cemeteries, the Commission manages the administrative responsibilities for them. Since 2005, <b>the</b> <b>Commission</b> <b>has</b> carried out similar management duties {{on behalf of the}} British Ministry of Defence for cemeteries and graves of British and Imperial soldiers who died during the Second Boer War. In 2003, Veterans Affairs Canada employed the Commission to develop an approach to locate grave markers for which the Canadian Minister of Veterans Affairs has responsibility. As of 2011, the Commission conducts a twelve-year cyclical inspection programme of Canadian veterans' markers installed {{at the expense of the}} Government of Canada.|$|E
5|$|The Commission is {{currently}} {{responsible for the}} continued commemoration of 1.7million deceased Commonwealth military service members in 153countries and approximately 67,000civilians who {{died as a result}} of enemy action during World War II. Commonwealth military service members are commemorated by name on either a headstone, at an identified site of a burial, or on a memorial. As a result, the Commission {{is currently}} responsible for the care of war dead at over 23,000 separate burial sites and maintenance of more than 200memorials worldwide. The vast majority of burial sites are pre-existing communal or municipal cemeteries and parish churchyards located in the United Kingdom, however <b>the</b> <b>Commission</b> <b>has</b> itself constructed approximately 2,500 war cemeteries worldwide. <b>The</b> <b>Commission</b> <b>has</b> also constructed or commissioned memorials to commemorate the dead who have no known grave; the largest of these is the Thiepval Memorial.|$|E

5|$|On February 2, 1425, Bartolomeo Valori and Cosimo de' Medici {{requested}} 400 of the 800florins {{that had}} been deposited with the Calimala, likely for work already completed. This deposit was insurance in case the executors left the tomb unfinished and the Calimala was forced to pay for its completion, {{as it had been}} obliged to with the finger reliquary. This request is also the most direct piece of evidence for Cosimo's involvement with the commissioning. Despite this document, Vasari's claim in his Vite of 1550 that Cosimo was responsible for the handling of <b>the</b> <b>commission</b> <b>has</b> been questioned.|$|E

The governor of New York then appoints them to three-year terms. The commissioners serve without pay, but are compensated for business related expenses.

Further, <b>the</b> <b>commission</b> <b>has</b> been often returned to review its earlier reports in the wake of changed scenarios and the aptness of law in such situations.
