50|$|<b>Triplane</b> <b>{{fracture}}</b> is {{a fracture}} at the epiphyseal plate of the tibia in early adolescence with {{involvement of the}} epiphysis and metaphysis of the tibia. The link presents two types of imaging. The first four images (figures 1-4) are radiographic images while the last 3 are CT scans of the left distal tibia and fibula. The first radiographic image is an anterior-posterior view of the distal third of the left tibia and fibula. The image presents a fracture of the distal epiphyseal plate of the tibia and fibula. The primary imaging (radiograph) identifies the abnormality in the anatomy of subject’s left distal tibia and fibula. However, {{it is difficult to}} view the extent of the fracture and classify the fracture based on radiographic image. Figure four is a CT scan of the posterior aspect of the left distal tibia and fibula. Note that in this image the extent of the fracture is more visible extending to the epiphysis and metaphysis. The type of fracture is a Salter-Harris type IV. The CT scan was an appropriate choice of advance imaging which helps clinicians determine the extent of the fracture and enable us to address the problem appropriately.|$|E
40|$|Background. The <b>triplane</b> <b>fracture,</b> {{a unique}} {{transitional}} physeal injury, is classically {{described in the}} distal tibia. A small number of additional anatomic locations are documented in the orthopaedic literature. Methods. Available literature surrounding triplane fractures was reviewed. We describe a rare case of a proximal tibial <b>triplane</b> <b>fracture</b> in a thirteen-year-old girl, suffered during a skiing accident. Results. Using arthroscopically assisted percutaneous reduction techniques an anatomic reduction was achieved. Conclusion. We outline the surgical and postoperative techniques for management of this unique injury...|$|E
40|$|Background: To {{identify}} the fracture confi guration and treatment results {{for patients with}} <b>triplane</b> and Tillaux <b>fractures</b> in the ankle joint. Methods: A retrospective study was performed on 14 patients with a {{more than one year}} follow-up. This study investigated the fracture confi guration, concomitant fi bula fracture, treatment methods and complications. The treatment outcomes were analyzed using modifi ed Weber protocol. Results: Among the 14 cases, 11 were <b>triplane</b> <b>fractures</b> and 3 were Tillaux fractures. Seven were two part <b>triplane</b> <b>fractures,</b> and 4 were three part <b>triplane</b> <b>fractures.</b> Eight were lateral <b>triplane</b> <b>fractures,</b> and 3 were medial <b>triplane</b> <b>fractures.</b> A fi bula fracture was accompanied by 7. The fibular fracture comprised of oblique fractures in all cases. A closed and open reduction was performed in 6 and 8 cases, respectively. All but one showed excellent treatment outcomes at the final follow-up. Traumatic arthritis developed in 1 case. Conclusions: Precisely detecting the fracture confi guration by computed tomography and understanding the injury mechanism have greatly improved the outcomes of <b>triplane</b> <b>fractures</b> and Tillaux fractures of the ankle in adolescent patients...|$|R
50|$|It {{occurs in}} older {{children}} {{at the end of}} growth. Variability in fracture pattern is due to progression of physeal closure as anterolateral part of distal tibial physis is the last to close. When the lateral physis is the only portion not fused, external rotation may lead to Tillaux or <b>Triplane</b> <b>fractures.</b>|$|R
40|$|In {{patients}} with immature skeletons, ligamentous injuries rarely accompany ankle fractures. In this article, we report about deltoid ligament tears and syndesmotic disruptions accompanying <b>triplane</b> ankle <b>fractures</b> in two children, and make recommendations {{as to the}} evaluation and treatment of children with such injuries...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: We {{studied the}} cases of nine {{adolescent}} patients with a Salter-Harris Type-Ill fracture of the lateral portion of the distal tibial epiphysis (sometimes called the juvenile Tillaux fracture) and eight patients with a <b>triplane</b> <b>fracture</b> of the distal tibial epiphysis. The mechanism of both injuries was postulated to be external rotation of the foot on the leg. There were both two-fragment and three-fragment triplane fractures in the series. The three-fragment triplane fractures oc-curred in younger patients, and surgical treatment was more frequently administered. The pattern of closure of the distal tibial growth plate in the adolescent strongly influenced the type of fracture. The <b>triplane</b> <b>fracture</b> of the distal end of the tibia and the isolated fracture of the lateral portion of the distal tibia...|$|E
40|$|We {{report the}} case of a 14 -year-old boy who {{sustained}} a displaced <b>triplane</b> <b>fracture</b> of the distal radius. This was treated with closed reduction and application of a cast with good clinical and radiological results. We discuss (for the first time) the reasons for the rarity of this fracture at the distal radius compared to the distal tibia...|$|E
40|$|<b>Triplane</b> <b>fracture</b> is an {{uncommon}} subtype of physeal fracture {{that occurs in}} three planes (trasverse, sagital and coronal), more frequent in the distal end of the tibial of the adolescents. The arthoscopic – assisted treatment might be useful to limit the surgical exposure and to check the appropriate reduction of the articular surface in selected patients...|$|E
40|$|Objectives: To {{illustrate}} {{the types of}} injuries seen by the {{accident and emergency department}} {{as a result of the}} use of non-motorized 'microscooters' in children, and to increase awareness of scooter-related <b>triplane</b> <b>fractures</b> of the ankle. Study design: A retrospective study conducted in an accident and emergency department of a district general hospital on all children who had a scooter-related limb injury over a 6 -month period and were referred for orthopaedic review. Methods: The analysis involved a case note review. Information recorded included the injury sustained, protective equipment worn at the time of the accident and management by the orthopaedic team. Results: Scooter injuries accounted for 10 fractures in this period. There were three 'triplanar' injuries, which required operative fixation, and three injuries requiring manipulation under anaesthesia. No protective gear was worn by any of the patients. Conclusion: The popularity of microscooters seems to represent a significant risk of bony injury in the paediatric population. Medical personnel who manage acute paediatric trauma should be aware of scooter-related triplanar ankle injuries...|$|R
40|$|We have {{reviewed}} 15 {{cases of}} <b>triplane</b> <b>fracture</b> of the distal tibia. The {{mechanism of injury}} is lateral rotation and the anatomical pattern of the fracture depends {{on the state of}} the growth plate at the time of injury. In seven of our cases the anteromedial part of the growth plate was fused, but in eight children the plate was completely open. In six of these eight children there was a hump or projection of the medial growth plate. It is suggested that this hump stabilises the anteromedial part of the epiphysis in a manner similar to the partial anteromedial fusion seen in older children, and that this accounts for the occurrence of <b>triplane</b> <b>fracture</b> in the presence of an open growth plate. Most epiphyseal injuries can be classified according to Salter and Harris (1963), but some are too complex to fit into this scheme. One such injury is the <b>triplane</b> <b>fracture</b> ofthe distal tibia, first described by Marmor in 1970. The fracture is in three planes: 1. Coronal, through the posterior tibial metaphysis and seen either as a Salter-Harris Type II or Type IV injury on the lateral radiograph. 2. Transverse, through the growth plate. 3. Sagittal, through the distal tibial epiphysis and seen as a Salter-Harris Type III injury on the anteroposterior radiograph. Other workers have investigated these fractures using conventional tomography and computed tomo-graphy. The injury may result in two main fragment...|$|E

Pediatric Triplane and Tillaux fractures represent a continuum of Salter-Harris injuries of the distal tibia. Over an 18 -month period in children 12 to 15 years of age, the distal tibial physis closes first centrally, than medially and finally laterally. It is this unique and asymmetric pattern that makes them vulnerable to these injuries, with the Tillaux fracture historically occurring in slightly older children than the <b>triplane</b> <b>fracture.</b> However, we present a case and discussion of a 13 -year-old male who incurred simultaneous Tillaux and Triplane fractures...|$|E
