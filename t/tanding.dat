40|$|In this article, {{the author}} argues that {{migration}} scholars can gain a wider unders- <b>tanding</b> of historical African migration through {{the examination of}} marriage migration in particular. These specific migrations, which are especially visible in civil legal records of the Kayes region (Mali) from 1905 to 1925, shed light on women’s mobility (social and geographical) {{in and out of}} marriage. These documents also show the gradual restriction of this mobility by colonial and local authorities. The circumventing strategies used by some women to counter these restrictions relied mainly upon historical family migration networks. But these strategies would gradually become obsolete owing to patrilinear family networks proving ultimately to be much stronger thanks in particular to the colonial authorities’ support...|$|E

Simulation is based on data obtained from experiments using motion capture system VICON and force plate AMTI. In the model AnyBody Modeling System is introduced to help solve the redundancy problem and obtain results of muscle activities, muscle forces and joint forces. From the mo del, hip and knee joint forces could be analyzed under normal standing posture. Also, activities of the musculus rectus femoris and several other muscles of the lower limbs can be obtained. From the results it could be concluded that stress es at joints are much stronger than theoretical reasoning because of the functio ns of relevant soft tissues such as muscles, tendons and so on.
