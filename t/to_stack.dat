5|$|The {{setting was}} principally based on Norway, and the {{cultural}} influences in the film come from Scandinavian culture. Several landmarks in Norway appear in the film, including the Akershus Fortress in Oslo, the Nidaros Cathedral in Trondheim, and Bryggen in Bergen. Numerous other typical cultural Scandinavian elements are {{also included in the}} film, such as stave churches, trolls, Viking ships, a hot spring, Fjord horses, clothes, and food such as lutefisk. A maypole is also present in the film, as well as the brief appearance of runes in a book that Anna and Elsa's father opens to figure out where the trolls live. A scene where two men argue over whether <b>to</b> <b>stack</b> firewood bark up or bark down is a reference to the perennial Norwegian debate over how <b>to</b> <b>stack</b> firewood properly. The film also contains several elements specifically drawn from Sámi culture, such as the usage of reindeer for transportation and the equipment used to control these, clothing styles (the outfits of the ice cutters), and parts of the musical score. Decorations, such as those on the castle pillars and Kristoff's sled, are also in styles inspired by Sámi duodji decorations. During their field work in Norway, Disney's team, for inspiration, visited Rørosrein, a Sámi family-owned company in the village Plassje that produces reindeer meat and arranges tourist events. Arendelle was inspired by Nærøyfjord, a branch of Norway's longest fjord Sognefjorden, which has been listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site; while a castle in Oslo with beautiful hand-painted patterns on all four walls served as the inspiration for the kingdom's royal castle interior.|$|E
5|$|The {{ruins of}} the city’s walls are even now discerned in the road between Siri to Qutub Minar and also in {{isolated}} patches behind the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT), in Begumpur, Khirki Masjid near Khirki village, Satpula and many other nearby locations; at some sections, as seen at Satpula, the fort walls were large enough to have few in built store rooms <b>to</b> <b>stack</b> provisions and armory. The mystery of the city’s precincts (complex) has unfolded over the years with later day excavations revealing {{a large number of}} monuments in the villages and colonies of South Delhi. Due to compulsions of urban expansion of the Capital City of Delhi, Jahanpanah is now part of the upscale urban development of South Delhi. The village and the wealth of ruins scattered all around are now enclosed by South Delhi suburbs of Panchshil Park South, Malviya Nagar, Adchini, the Aurobindo Ashram, Delhi branch and other smaller housing colony developments. It is hemmed in the NorthSouth direction between the Outer Ring Road and the Qutb Complex and on the eastwest direction by the Mehrauli road and the Chirag Delhi road, with Indian Institute of Technology located {{on the other side of}} the Mehrauli road as an important landmark.|$|E

In packaging line the product is first scaled, then sealed in the package, detected for open flap and metals, double-checked the weight and last packed in large cases.|$|E

25|$|When cooking over a campfire, it is {{possible}} to use old-style lipped cast-iron Dutch ovens as true baking ovens, to prepare biscuits, cakes, breads, pizzas, and even pies. A smaller baking pan can be placed inside the ovens, used and replaced with another as the first batch is completed. It is also possible <b>to</b> <b>stack</b> Dutch ovens on top of each other, conserving the heat that would normally rise from the hot coals on the top. These stacks can be as high as 5 or 6 pots.|$|E
25|$|When fetal {{hemoglobin}} production is switched off after birth, normal children begin producing adult hemoglobin (HbA). Children with sickle-cell disease instead begin producing a defective form of hemoglobin called hemoglobin S which aggregates together and forms filaments that cause {{red blood cells}} to change their shape from round to sickle-shaped. These defective red blood cells have a greater tendency <b>to</b> <b>stack</b> {{on top of one}} another and block blood vessels. These invariably lead to so-called painful vaso-occlusive episodes, which are a hallmark of the disease.|$|E
25|$|There are {{two types}} of thylakoids—granal thylakoids, which are {{arranged}} in grana, and stromal thylakoids, which are in contact with the stroma. Granal thylakoids are pancake-shaped circular disks about 300–600 nanometers in diameter. Stromal thylakoids are helicoid sheets that spiral around grana. The flat tops and bottoms of granal thylakoids contain only the relatively flat photosystem II protein complex. This allows them <b>to</b> <b>stack</b> tightly, forming grana with many layers of tightly appressed membrane, called granal membrane, increasing stability and surface area for light capture.|$|E

25|$|Since it {{was quite}} easy <b>to</b> <b>stack</b> {{interconnections}} (wires) inside the embedding matrix, the approach allowed designers to forget completely about the routing of wires (usually a time-consuming operation of PCB design): Anywhere the designer needs a connection, the machine will draw a wire in straight line from one location/pin to another. This led to very short design times (no complex algorithms to use even for high density designs) as well as reduced crosstalk (which is worse when wires run parallel to each other—which almost never happens in Multiwire), though the cost is too high to compete with cheaper PCB technologies when large quantities are needed.|$|E
25|$|The game {{is based}} on the Russian {{stacking}} matryoshka dolls, an idea coined by Double Fine's art director, Lee Petty, who saw the dolls as a means to replace the standard player interface used in graphical adventure games. The player controls the smallest doll, Charlie Blackmore, who has the ability <b>to</b> <b>stack</b> and unstack into larger dolls and use their abilities to solve puzzles to allow Charlie to free his older siblings {{and put an end to}} child labor enforced by the antagonist, the Baron. Puzzles within the game have multiple solutions, and include additional puzzles and challenges that allow the player to explore the game's world outside of the main story.|$|E
25|$|The {{idea was}} to build an {{offshore}} terminal with docks equipped with Dashaveyor tracks instead of a conventional container shipping port on land. An operator would load containers onto Dashaveyor cars, which would then enter a tunnel to move them at high speed to the shore. There they would exit the tunnel and automatically drive the container to its storage location, and optionally lift it <b>to</b> <b>stack</b> them. In a Dashaveyor equipped port, a single vehicle would pick up, move and stack the containers. Normally each of these steps required a separate, manned, vehicle. Additionally, the ships never had to enter port, which had major advantages in terms of siting and construction.|$|E

25|$|In the 1950s, most railroads {{took the}} cue from circuses and started loading their own flatcars in this manner. But, loading even {{up to six}} {{automobiles}} onto one flat car left {{a large amount of}} space above the vehicles that was unused. The natural solution was to take the temporary assemblies that were used <b>to</b> <b>stack</b> and load vehicles within boxcars and permanently attach them to the flatcars. The assemblies, also called racks, created two levels on which automobiles could be loaded. To complete the flatcar, foldaway bridges were added {{to the ends of the}} flatcar decks to allow the vehicles to be driven the entire length of a train for loading. Such flatcars eliminated the need for specialized equipment to load and unload boxcar racks. All they needed now was a ramp at the right height.|$|E
40|$|The Golgi {{apparatus}} in mammalian {{cells is}} composed of flattened cisternae that are densely packed <b>to</b> form <b>stacks.</b> We have used the Golgi stacking protein GRASP 65 as a tool <b>to</b> modify the <b>stacking</b> state of Golgi cisternae.

Cells with an unstacked Golgi showed a higher transport rate compared <b>to</b> cells with <b>stacked</b> Golgi membranes. Vesicle budding from unstacked cisternae in vitro was significantly increased compared <b>to</b> <b>stacked</b> membranes. These results suggest that Golgi cisternal stacking can directly regulate vesicle formation and thus the rate of protein transport through the Golgi.

Race organisers saw fit to demote Ferrari on the stage results, penalise him on both time – 30 seconds penalty on the general classification – and a 25-point deduction, while he was fined also.

25|$|Rectangles {{have been}} the most popular and common {{geometric}} form for buildings since the shape is easy <b>to</b> <b>stack</b> and organize; as a standard, it is easy to design furniture and fixtures to fit inside rectangularly shaped buildings. But triangles, while more difficult to use conceptually, provide a great deal of strength. As computer technology helps architects design creative new buildings, triangular shapes are becoming increasingly prevalent as parts of buildings and as the primary shape for some types of skyscrapers as well as building materials. In Tokyo in 1989, architects had wondered whether it was possible to build a 500-story tower to provide affordable office space for this densely packed city, but with the danger to buildings from earthquakes, architects considered that a triangular shape would have been necessary if such a building was ever to have been built (it hasn't by 2011).|$|E
