5|$|On 2 July 2008, U.S. District Court judge Brian Cogan of the Eastern District of New York {{dismissed}} the families' suits {{against all the}} U.S. based defendants under the premise of forum non-conveniens. Without ruling on <b>the</b> <b>merits</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cases, and while allowing discovery to continue, Cogan recommended the Brazilian court system as a more appropriate jurisdiction for the dispute.|$|E
5|$|Three parties filed merit briefs: the Capobiancos as petitioners, {{and both}} Brown and the Cherokee Nation as respondents. 32 {{different}} amici curiae briefs were filed arguing <b>the</b> <b>merits</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> case.

5|$|Bache's major {{accomplishment}} was {{the establishment}} of Liszt's music in England, to which he selflessly devoted himself between 1865 and his death in 1888. This was {{at the height of}} the War of the Romantics, when conservative and liberal musical factions openly argued about the future of classical music and <b>the</b> <b>merits</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> compositions written in their respective schools. Bache featured several of the orchestral and choral works through an annual series of concerts, which he single-handedly funded, organised and promoted. Likewise, he played an annual series of solo recitals that incorporated Liszt's piano music.|$|E

5|$|By {{recasting}} {{a difference}} of judgment over <b>the</b> <b>merits</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> early work on the hydrogen bomb project into {{a matter of a}} security risk, Teller effectively damned Oppenheimer in a field where security was necessarily of paramount concern. Teller's testimony thereby rendered Oppenheimer vulnerable to charges by a Congressional aide that he was a Soviet spy, which resulted in the destruction of Oppenheimer's career.|$|E
5|$|Errors of law {{committed}} by public authorities when they act or make decisions {{are within the}} jurisdiction of the High Court of Singapore to correct by way of judicial review. On the other hand, the Court is generally unwilling to intervene where the alleged error is one that concerns the facts of the matter. The rationale for this rule is that it is the Court's role in judicial review of administrative action to scrutinize the legality and not <b>the</b> <b>merits</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> decisions of public authorities.|$|E

5|$|Justice Stevens wrote a brief {{dissenting opinion}} {{arguing that the}} case should have been {{dismissed}} because the Illinois legislature has largely reduced penalties for marijuana possession, which made it ridiculous for the officers to rush to get a warrant. He said {{that even if he}} reached <b>the</b> <b>merits</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> question, he would affirm and hold the search unconstitutional because the majority misapplied a balancing of “privacy-related and law enforcement-related concerns". He wanted to give broader protection to the idea of the home as a place for protection, even if the home in this case was a trailer.|$|E
5|$|Scholars today remain {{divided on}} <b>the</b> <b>merits</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{electronic}} barrier {{system and the}} efficacy of the bombing campaigns that it directed. The claims of destruction made by the U.S. Air Force, both during and after the war, were originally taken as given. The only exception to this rule was at the CIA, which discounted Air Force claims at the time by as much as 75 percent. This was understandable {{due to the fact that}} the Vietnamese were basically silent during the 1970s and 1980s.|$|E
5|$|The {{third and}} final Part lists some of Kennedy's reservations. He would not say that the {{defendant}} must be present at all stages of the trial. There should be a reluctance to consider the applicability of Article 75 of Protocol I, since the U.S. never signed it and thus it is not binding. Kennedy writes that he feels {{it was not necessary}} to delve into the validity of the conspiracy charge, and he expresses no view on <b>the</b> <b>merits</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> other limitations of the commission noted in Part V of the Decision.|$|E

5|$|A {{court of}} enquiry was held the {{following}} month in Liverpool by the Board of Trade, and focused particularly on {{the roles of the}} captains in the tragedy as well as the design of the Liverpool lifeboat. The court found that no-one was to blame for the loss of either Ellen Southard or the Liverpool lifeboat. Captain James Martin and his crew were praised for their gallantry in getting everyone off the ship, and absolved of any blame with respect to the capsizing of the lifeboat. The lifeboat was furthermore found to be of sound design and suitably adapted to her role, but debate continued for many years about <b>the</b> <b>merits</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> tubular design vs the self-righting one, as well as the requirement for lifeboats to be powered.|$|E
5|$|Academics have {{expressed}} scepticism {{as to whether}} the doctrine of legitimate expectation should apply to substantive rights. Thio Li-ann argues that legitimate expectations should relate only to procedural rather than substantive rights. Procedural protection only has a minimal impact on the administrative autonomy of the relevant public authority, since the court is only concerned with {{the manner in which the}} decision was made and not whether the decision was fair. Thus, the ultimate autonomy of public authorities is never placed in jeopardy. Conversely, as Mark Elliot posits, giving effect to a substantive legitimate expectation impinges on the separation of powers. The authority has been entrusted by Parliament to make decisions about the allocation of resources in public interest. Applying legitimate expectation substantively allows the courts to inquire into <b>the</b> <b>merits</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> decision. Such interference with the public authority's discretion would be overstepping their role and exceeding their proper constitutional function.|$|E
5|$|Even {{though the}} GRC scheme is {{intended}} to ensure minority representation in Parliament, {{it can be said}} that the scheme emphasizes racial consciousness and hence widens the gap between races. It may undermine the esteem of minority candidates as they would not be sure if they are elected on their own merit, or due to the scheme and <b>the</b> <b>merits</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> rest of the team of MPs. This would result in minority candidates resenting that they are dependent on the majority to enter Parliament, and the majority candidates believing that minority candidates have insufficient ability. It has also been claimed that the GRC scheme demeans the majority of Singaporeans as it assumes that they are not able to see the value or merit of minority candidates, and only vote for candidates with whom they share a common race, culture and language.|$|E

5|$|Hanna-Barbera {{dismissed}} creator Peter Lawrence in 1996 {{and hired}} new producers {{to finish the}} show. John Eng and Cosmo Anzilotti completed Lawrence's work; David Lipman, Davis Doi, and Larry Houston wrote new episodes with reworked character designs akin to those of classic Quest. Each team produced half of the show's fifty-two episodes. While Lawrence's team crafted stories of real-world mystery and exploration, later writers used science fiction and paranormal plots. Turner supported the show through a massive marketing campaign with thirty-three licensees. Real Adventures debuted with an unprecedented wide release on Cartoon Network, TBS, and TNT, airing twenty-one times per week. Critics have debated <b>the</b> <b>merits</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> show's animation, writing, and spirit compared to classic Quest, {{but it has also}} received praise in those categories.|$|E
5|$|In early 1999, Yoshiki Okamoto, {{then head}} of Capcom's screenwriter {{subsidiary}} Flagship, proposed his idea of remaking the original The Legend of Zelda for the Game Boy Color to Shigeru Miyamoto, the game designer at Nintendo who created the series. Okamoto was eventually asked to develop six Zelda games for the Game Boy Color: two based on earlier installments and four original entries into the series. Okamoto wanted to release them in quick succession of four to five months, and held on to his concept of bringing the first game to the handheld console to make young children experience <b>the</b> <b>merits</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> original Zelda, {{but also as a}} test for the development team to move on to a more ambitious sequel if {{it turned out to be}} successful.|$|E
5|$|McCormack {{transferred}} to the United States Air Force on 25 July 1950. After leaving the AEC in August 1951, he became Special Assistant to the Deputy Chief of Staff of the Air Force for Development. In January 1952 he was appointed Director of Nuclear Applications at the Air Research and Development Center in Baltimore, Maryland. He was subsequently promoted to major general, and became Deputy Commander of the Air Research and Development Command. He was called to testify at the Oppenheimer security hearing. Like other witnesses, McCormack testified that Oppenheimer was loyal, and that while {{the two men had}} disagreed over <b>the</b> <b>merits</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Super, that he saw nothing dishonest or disloyal in Oppenheimer's opposition to it.|$|E
25|$|The {{presiding}} judge, John T. Raulston, {{was accused}} of being biased towards the prosecution and frequently clashed with Darrow.

He also warned the jury not to judge <b>the</b> <b>merit</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> law (which would become <b>the</b> focus <b>of</b> <b>the</b> trial) but on <b>the</b> violation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Act, which he called a 'high misdemeanor.'

5|$|Since {{the court}} had no {{capacity}} to review <b>the</b> <b>merits</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> decision and conclude whether Jehovah's Witnesses were a threat to public order, it was sufficient that the Minister had made Order 179 with {{the view that the}} existence of Jehovah's Witnesses, which forbade national service, was contrary to public peace, welfare and good order. The judge also remarked that notion of public peace, welfare and good order in the SA was similar to the concept of public order envisaged by Article 15(4) of the Constitution. Thus the rationale of maintaining public order behind Order 179 fell within the permitted categories spelt out in both section 24(1)(a) of the SA and Article 15(4) respectively.|$|E
5|$|The {{official}} histories had {{on occasion}} been threatened with political interference, {{particularly with the}} change in government in 1949. Kippenberger, a person of high standing with both {{the government and the}} ordinary New Zealander, was a strong advocate for the project, and was able to convince the new government of <b>the</b> <b>merits</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> official histories. Kippenberger encouraged a positive atmosphere at the War History Branch, despite a tight budget and at times crowded work conditions. He was proud of its rate of output, which exceeded the efforts of the better resourced official histories of Australia and Great Britain. By 1963, the War History Branch he had presided over for much of its life had produced nearly 50 major volumes.|$|E
5|$|VHEMT {{was founded}} in 1991 by Les U. Knight, an American activist who became {{involved}} in the environmental movement in the 1970s and thereafter concluded that human extinction was the best solution to the problems facing the Earth's biosphere and humanity. Knight publishes the group's newsletter and serves as its spokesman. Although the group is promoted by a website and represented at some environmental events, it relies heavily on coverage from outside media to spread its message. Many commentators view its platform as unacceptably extreme, though other writers have applauded VHEMT's perspective. In response to VHEMT, some journalists and academics have argued that humans can develop sustainable lifestyles or can reduce their population to sustainable levels. Others maintain that, whatever <b>the</b> <b>merits</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> idea, the human reproductive drive will prevent humankind from ever voluntarily seeking extinction.|$|E
