25|$|<b>Transmissivity</b> is {{determined}} by the percentage of light transmitted per the incident light. <b>Transmissivity</b> is usually the same from both first and second surfaces. The combined transmitted and reflected light, subtracted from the incident light, measures the amount absorbed by both the coating and substrate. For transmissive mirrors, such as one-way mirrors, beam splitters, or laser output couplers, the <b>transmissivity</b> of the mirror is an important consideration. The <b>transmissivity</b> of metallic coatings are often determined by their thickness. For precision beam-splitters or output couplers, the thickness of the coating must be kept at very high tolerances to transmit the proper amount of light. For dielectric mirrors, the thickness of the coat must always be kept to high tolerances, but it is often more the number of individual coats that determine the <b>transmissivity.</b> For the substrate, the material used must also have good <b>transmissivity</b> to the chosen wavelengths. Glass is a suitable substrate for most visible-light applications, but other substrates such as zinc selenide or synthetic sapphire may be used for infrared or ultraviolet wavelengths.|$|E

40|$|We {{propose a}} new {{algorithm}} for sky calibration of the L-band radiometers JLBARA and ELBARA II, introducing the effective <b>transmissivities</b> of the instruments. The suggested approach {{was tested using}} experimental data obtained at the Selhausen test site, Germany. It was shown that for JLBARA the effective <b>transmissivities</b> depend strongly on the air temperature and decrease with increasing air temperature, while for ELBARA II such strong dependence was not observed. It was also shown that the effective <b>transmissivities</b> account for the antenna and feed cable loss effects, and for the variations of the radiometer gain due to air temperature changes. The new calibration algorithm reduces significantly the bias of brightness temperature estimates for both radiometers, especially for JLBARA. © 2012 IEEE...|$|R

40|$|Coupling {{agents are}} {{required}} when using therapeutic ultrasound (US) to maximize acoustic {{contact between the}} transducer and the insonated tissue. US beam power is attenuated to varying extents by different couplants and this may influence treatment efficacy, since therapeutic effects are dose-dependent. It is therefore important to know how well different couplants transmit US. In this study, the transmission characteristics {{of a range of}} gel couplants were measured using a radiation force balance. Data were collected for gels commonly used by UK therapists and at the powers and frequencies advocated for low-intensity therapeutic practice. <b>Transmissivities</b> of standard couplants relative to degassed water varied between 95 % and 108 % (nominal 95 % confidence intervals between 0 % and 11 %).

25|$|Because {{of their}} high {{porosity}} and permeability, sand and gravel aquifers have higher hydraulic conductivity than clay or unfractured granite aquifers. Sand or gravel aquifers would thus be easier to extract water from (e.g., using a pumping well) because {{of their high}} <b>transmissivity,</b> compared to clay or unfractured bedrock aquifers.|$|E
25|$|Hydraulic {{conductivity}} (K) and <b>transmissivity</b> (T) are indirect aquifer properties (they {{cannot be}} measured directly). T is the K integrated over the vertical thickness (b) of the aquifer (T=Kb when K is constant {{over the entire}} thickness). These properties are measures of an aquifer's ability to transmit water. Intrinsic permeability (κ) is a secondary medium property which {{does not depend on}} the viscosity and density of the fluid (K and T are specific to water); it is used more in the petroleum industry.|$|E
25|$|Mirrors can be {{manufactured}} {{to a wide}} range of engineering tolerances, including reflectivity, surface quality, surface roughness, or <b>transmissivity,</b> depending on the desired application. These tolerances can range from low, such as found in a normal household-mirror, to extremely high, like those used in lasers or telescopes. Increasing the tolerances allows better and more precise imaging or beam transmission over longer distances. In imaging systems this can help reduce anomalies (artifacts), distortion or blur, but at a much higher cost. Where viewing distances are relatively close or high precision is not a concern, lower tolerances can be used to make effective mirrors at affordable costs.|$|E

40|$|One of many {{applications}} of geohydraulic modelling is assessing {{the suitability of}} a site to host a nuclear waste repository. This modelling task is complicated by scale-dependent heterogeneity and coupled thermo-hydro-mechanical (THM) processes. The objective here was to develop methods for (i) upscaling flow and transport in fractured media from detailed-scale data and (ii) accounting for THM-induced effects on regional-scale transport. An example field data set was used for demonstration. A systematic framework was developed where equivalent properties of flow, transport, and stress-effects were estimated with discrete fracture network (DFN) modelling, at some block scale, and then transferred to a regional-scale stochastic continuum (SC) model. The selected block scale allowed a continuum approximation of flow, but not of transport. Instead, block-scale transport was quantified by transit time distributions and modelled with a particle random walk method at the regional scale. An enhanced SC-upscaling approach was developed to reproduce the DFN flow results more simply. This required: (i) weighting of the input well-test data by their conductivity-dependent test volumes and (ii) conductivity-dependent correlation structure. Interestingly, the best-fitting correlation structure resembled the density function of DFN <b>transmissivities.</b> Channelized transport, over distances exceeding the block scale, was modelled with a transport persistence length. A linear relationship was found between this persistence length and the macroscale dispersion coefficient, with a slope equal to a representative mean block-scale dispersion coefficient. A method was also developed to combine well-test data and rock-mechanical data in estimating fracture <b>transmissivities,</b> and its application was demonstrated. Finally, an overall sequential THM analysis was introduced allowing the estimation {{of the significance of}} waste-related thermo-mechanical (TM) effects on regional transport; here TM effects are calculated separately and their impact on fracture <b>transmissivities</b> were incorporated into the hybrid framework. For the particular case, their effects on regional-scale transport were small...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{mechanism}} of the unidirectional transmission in metal subwavelength gratings with different surfaces is investigated theoretically. This kind of unidirectional transmission belongs to the extraordinary optical transmission assisted by the surface plasmon polariton (SPP). The SPP wave comes through the multi-reflection process and finally transforms into the transmission wave. The difference of amplitude <b>transmissivities</b> and reflectivities at different surfaces in opposite incident directions results in the unidirectional transmission. A division method is proposed to calculate the parameters of subwavelength gratings with asymmetric surfaces...|$|R

Given vertical flow profiles collected under both ambient and stressed (pumping or injection) conditions, the user can estimate fracture (or layer) <b>transmissivities</b> and far-field hydraulic heads.

2500|$|When a {{soil layer}} {{is above the}} water table, it is not {{saturated}} and does {{not contribute to the}} <b>transmissivity.</b> When the soil layer is entirely below the water table, its saturated thickness corresponds to the thickness of the soil layer itself. When the water table is inside a soil layer, the saturated thickness corresponds to the distance of the water table {{to the bottom of the}} layer. As the water table may behave dynamically, this thickness may change from place to place or from time to time, so that the <b>transmissivity</b> may vary accordingly.|$|E

40|$|A field {{experiment}} was performed with an L- and X-band radiometer operating at 1. 4 GHz and 11. 4 GHz in a deciduous forest in Julich (Germany) from September to November 2004. The radiometers were {{installed on the}} ground being directed upwards through the canopy. In this position downwelling microwave radiation was measured during the defoliation of the forest with a time resolution of 4 h. Simultaneously we measured the air and soil temperatures. Based on these data, the <b>transmissivities</b> of the forest canopy were estimated at different foliation states. Typical L-band <b>transmissivities</b> determined for the foliated and the defoliated states were 0. 41 and 0. 46, confirming the semi-transparency of the canopy at low microwave frequencies. Due to the anisotropic crown structure the L-band brightness temperatures were slightly horizontally polarized {{to the same degree}} for any state of the vegetation. From this we conclude that branches are the prevailing emitters of the canopy whereas leaves and trunks are less relevant for L-band observations. In the X-band, the canopy was opaque in the foliated state and became semi-transparent in the course of defoliation indicating that leaves are an important radiation source at this wavelength. Our results provide the experimental evidence to quantify the radiation properties of a deciduous forest canopy. This is crucial for interpreting the microwave radiation emitted from forested areas measured from space-borne microwave sensing platforrns. (C) 2007 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved...|$|R

Measurements were made with an improved drop tube design, which ensures a relatively isothermal high-temperature gas column. Data were collected with an FTIR-spectrometer, allowing for much better spectral resolution than most previous high-temperature measurements. The measured data were compared with the HITEMP database, {{as well as with the}} data of Phillips for the 2. 7 µm band of H 2 O.

We use a line-by-line approach to obtain the parameters of our model, which are tabulated as functions of the temperature and of a non dimensional line-width parameter.

An evaluation of computed reservoir <b>transmissivities</b> and well capacities indicated that a linear model fitted the interference test data significantly better than a radial model.

40|$|A fully {{mechanistic}} model based on diffusion equations for gas transport in a flooded rice system is presented. The model has transport descriptions for various compartments in the water-saturated soil {{and within the}} plant. Plant parameters were estimated from published data and experiments independent of the validation experiment. An independent experiment is described in which the diffusion coefficient of sulfurhexafluoride (SF 6) in water-saturated soil was determined. The model was validated by experiments in which transport of SF 6 through soil and plant was monitored continuously by photoacoustics. The independent default settings could reasonably predict gas release dynamics in the soil-plant system. Calculated <b>transmissivities</b> and concentration gradients at the default settings show that transport within the soil was the most limiting step in this system, which explains why most gases are released via plant-mediated transport. The root-shoot interface represents the major resistance for gas transport within the plant. A sensitivity analysis of the model showed that gas transport in such a system is highly sensitive to the estimation of the diffusion coefficient of SF 6, which helps to understand diel patterns found for greenhouse gas emissions, and to the root distribution with depth. This can be understood from the calculated <b>transmissivities.</b> The model is less sensitive {{to changes in the}} resistance at the root-shoot interface and in the root fraction active in gas exchange. The model thus provides an understanding of limiting steps in gas transport, but quantitative predictions of in situ gas transport rates will be difficult given the plasticity of root distribution...|$|R
