40|$|Abstract: The Java medaka (Oryzias javanicus) has {{recently}} been highlighted as potential indicator for <b>tropical</b> <b>aquatic</b> <b>ecosystem.</b> However, unlike its Japanese counterpart the Japanese medaka (Oryzias latipes) which has been extensively studied, little information can be obtained on Java medaka population in Malaysia. Despite the growing interest and studies on {{the fish in the}} Asian region, its distribution and locality are not well known and this complicates sampling activity in the field as well as obtaining living specimen for laboratory culture purposes. Java medaka population can be easily found in the west coast of Peninsular Malaysia and can withstand wide range of salinity level from estuary and brackish water to freshwater river. However, the fish is not present in the east coast and several factors contributing to their non-distribution are discussed in this paper. The finding provides the first record on the detailed occurrence and distribution of Java medaka fish in Peninsular Malaysia and can also serve as a guide for fish collectors or enthusiast in the country to engage closely with the subject...|$|E
40|$|Objective: To {{investigate}} {{the use of}} a biomarker for assessment of the effects on the tropical chironomid, Chironomus javanus (C. javanus), Kiffer of sediment contaminated with an insecticide (chlorpyrifos). Methods: A wide range of biological responses to the tropical chironomid exposed were measured, including survival, growth rate and Acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity. Results: The measured median lethal concentration (96  h LC 50) of chlorpyrifos to C.  javanus was 0. 056 (95 % CI 0. 024 – 0. 124)  μg/kg. For sub-chronic levels of chlorpyrifos between 0. 001 and 0. 25  μg/kg administered for 10 days, the effects on the growth of C.  javanus were reduced (larva size, head structure width and dry weight) at the significance level (P <  0. 01) and the effects were concentration dependent. Following exposure to chlorpyrifos at the level of 0. 001  μg/kg for 48 and 96  h, the AChE activity in C.  javanus was inhibited compared with control samples (P <  0. 05). Conclusions: This study demonstrated that C.  javanus was sensitive when exposed to chlorpyrifos. This species could serve as a potential biomarker for assessing pesticide contamination at low environmental persistence and provides limited effects data on the sensitivity of tropical biota to contaminants for ecological risk assessment of organophosphate pesticides in the <b>tropical</b> <b>aquatic</b> <b>ecosystem...</b>|$|E
40|$|African {{tropical}} lakes provide vital {{ecosystem services}} including {{food and water}} {{to some of the}} fastest growing human populations, yet they are among the most understudied ecosystems in the world. The consequences of climate change and other stressors on the tropical lakes of Africa have been informed by long-term analyses, but these studies have largely focused on the massive Great Rift Valley lakes. Our objective was to evaluate how recent climate change has altered the functioning and services of smaller tropical lakes, which are far more abundant on the landscape. Based on a paired analysis of 20 years of high-resolution water column data and a paleolimnological record from a small crater lake in western Uganda, we present evidence that even a modest warming of the air (, 0. 9 uC increase over 20 years) and changes in the timing and intensity of rainfall can have significant consequences on the dynamics of this common tropical lake type. For example, we observed a significant nonlinear increase (R 2 adj = 0. 23, e. d. f. = 7, p, 0. 0001) in thermal stability over the past 20 years. This resulted in the expansion of anoxic waters and consequent deterioration of fish habitat and appears to have abated primary production; processes that may impair ecosystem services for a vulnerable human population. This study on a system representative of small tropical crater lakes highlights the far-reaching effects of global climatic change on tropical waters.

40|$|Climate {{change and}} {{biodiversity}} loss {{have been reported}} as major disturbances in the biosphere which can trigger changes in the structure and functioning of natural ecosystems. Nonetheless, empirical studies demonstrating how both factors interact to affect shifts in <b>aquatic</b> <b>ecosystems</b> are still unexplored. Here, we experimentally test how changes in rainfall distribution and litter diversity affect the occurrence of the algae-dominated condition in tank bromeliad ecosystems. Tank bromeliads are miniature <b>aquatic</b> <b>ecosystems</b> shaped by the rainwater and allochthonous detritus accumulated in the bases of their leaves. Here, we demonstrated that changes in the rainfall distribution were able to reduce the chlorophyll-a concentration in the water of bromeliad tanks affecting significantly the occurrence of algaedominated conditions. On the other hand, litter diversity {{did not affect the}} algae dominance irrespective to the rainfall scenario. We suggest that rainfall changes may compromise important self-reinforcing mechanisms responsible for maintaining high levels of algae on tank bromeliads ecosystems. We summarized these results into a theoretical model which suggests that tank bromeliads may show two different regimes, determined by the bromeliad ability in taking up nutrients from the water and by the total amount of light entering the tank. We concluded that predicted climate changes might promote regime shifts in <b>tropical</b> <b>aquatic</b> <b>ecosystems</b> by shaping their structure and the relative importance of other regulating factors. </p...|$|R

In situ tests were carried out in freshwater drainage channels (farm channels) that supply vegetable crops and receive considerable pesticide spray drift, and at channels outside farms (main channels). Moreover a pesticide-free farm was used as reference site. The endpoints analysed were: survival of the larvae, body length increment, capsule width increment, cholinesterase activity and glutathione S-transferase activity. Seasonal change was investigated as rainy season and dry season. Deleterious effects were observed at some farms especially during the rainy season when farmers apply heavier doses of pesticides.

40|$|The {{occurrence}} of emerging biological contaminants including antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) and Faecal Indicator Bacteria (FIB) is still little investigated {{in developing countries}} under tropical conditions. In this study, the total bacterial load, the abundance of FIB (E. coli and Enterococcus spp. (ENT)), Pseudomonas spp. and ARGs (blaTEM, blaCTX-M, blaSHV, blaNDM and aadA) were quantified using quantitative PCR in the total DNA extracted from the sediments recovered from hospital outlet pipes (HOP) and the Cauvery River Basin (CRB), Tiruchirappalli, Tamil Nadu, India. The abundance of bacterial marker genes were 120, 104 and 89 fold higher for the E. coli, Enterococcus spp. and Pseudomonas spp., respectively at HOP when compared with CRB.

40|$|To protect <b>tropical</b> <b>aquatic</b> <b>ecosystems,</b> {{water quality}} {{guidelines}} (WQGs) are often derived based on toxicity data of chemical contaminants using temperate species as surrogates {{because there is}} a lack of such toxicity data from tropical species. Such adoptions of temperate information could result in an unknown safety margin and might lead to over- or under-protection of tropical ecosystems. Therefore, this study systematically compared differences in chemical sensitivities between temperate and <b>tropical</b> <b>aquatic</b> species using the species sensitivity distribution (SSD) approach. Temperate and tropical saltwater species displayed different sensitivities for ten chemicals but showed similarity towards cadmium. Temperate saltwater species were more sensitive to unionised ammonia (NH 3), chromium, lead, nickel and tributyltin, whereas tropical saltwater species were more sensitive to copper, mercury, zinc, pentachlorophenol and phenol. Temperate freshwater species were more sensitive to arsenic, cadmium, chromium, copper, mercury, nickel, zinc, carbaryl, chlorpyrifos, DDT, lindane and malathion than their tropical counterparts, while tropical freshwater species tended to be more sensitive to 〖NH〗_ 3, lead, chlordane and phenol. Extrapolation factors of two and five were recommended for deriving tropical WQGs from temperate information to protect tropical saltwater and freshwater ecosystems, respectively. The results also indicated a general declining trend in chemical sensitivities from algae to crustaceans, molluscs, worms, and then fishes for both freshwater and saltwater. Both algae and crustaceans are sensitive to diverse chemicals and hence suitable for toxicity testing. Since temperature and pH can influence the physicochemical properties, bioavailability and thus toxicity of a chemical to aquatic organisms, the second part of this study aimed to investigate the relationships between chemical toxicity and temperature or pH. The acute median lethal or effective concentrations of 13 chemicals and 10 metals/metalloids towards various freshwater species were compared among different temperature and pH groups, respectively. The results suggested that in most cases, freshwater species exhibited the highest tolerance towards chemicals at an optimal temperature (T_opt) where the chemical toxicity was the lowest, and the chemical toxicity increased with increasing or decreasing temperature from T_opt). As reflected by SSDs at different temperatures for seven chemicals, the relationship between chemical toxicity and temperature followed the same pattern at the community level. At individual species level, relationships between metal toxicity and pH were more variable and could be classified into three models: (1) decreasing toxicity with increasing pH, (2) increasing toxicity with increasing pH, and (3) minimal toxicity at optimal pH (〖pH〗_opt), with increasing toxicity as pH increases or decreases from 〖pH〗_opt. As reflected by SSDs at different pH values for four metals, the relationship between chemical toxicity and pH conformed to the model (1) at the community level. With these conceptual models revealed in this study, it is feasible to derive site- and seasonal-specific WQGs at different temperature or pH conditions. The present results will be useful to environmental authorities for developing WQGs and conducting risk assessment in order to safeguard valuable <b>tropical</b> <b>aquatic</b> <b>ecosystems</b> and unique biodiversity therein.

The sustainability of ecosystems in the coastal zone and its wildlife is therefore vital. This review addresses these issues by considering current views on climate change and the United Nations Millennium Development Goals. Models show how international, national and local organisations impact on human communities and on ecosystems and wildlife, and how community sustainability is linked with ecosystem sustainability. Research is described on ecosystem sustainability and biodiversity in the coastal zone. This focuses on marine sedimentary ecosystems in the intertidal and sub littoral zone. Colonisation of sediment by living organisms changes the sedimentary ecosystem. Interactions between organisms living in sediment and the physical and chemical properties of sediment are also important. Sediment microorganisms reduce sediment permeability. This reduces in faunal biodiversity. Beds of the cord grass Spartina at the edges of estuaries make water flow turbulent. This alters potential flood risks and riverbank or estuarine erosion. Changes in temperate and <b>tropical</b> <b>aquatic</b> <b>ecosystems</b> have a central role in determining the abundance and sustainability of larger organisms.

Therefore, before hatching experiments, methods to verify viable resting eggs in ephippia must be considered. This study aimed to evaluate the number of eggs per ephippium of Daphnia from two <b>tropical</b> <b>aquatic</b> <b>ecosystems</b> and the efficiency of some methods for decapsulating resting eggs. To evaluate the influence of methods on hatching rates, three different conditions were tested: immersion in sodium hypochlorite, manually decapsulated resting eggs and intact ephippia. The immersion in hypochlorite solution could evaluate differences in numbers of resting eggs per ephippium between the ecosystems studied. The exposure to sodium hypochlorite at a concentration of 2 % for 20 minutes was the most efficient method for visual evaluation and isolation of the resting eggs. Hatching rate experiments with resting eggs not isolated from ephippia were underestimated (11. 1 ± 5. 0 %), showing the need of methods to quantify and isolate viable eggs. There were no differences between the hatching rate of resting eggs submitted to hypochlorite solution (47. 2 ± 7. 34 %) and manually decapsulated (53. 7 ± 13. 24 %).

40|$|AIM: The aim of {{the present}} study was to {{identify}} which environmental factors affect the seasonal phytoplankton structure in different types of <b>tropical</b> <b>aquatic</b> <b>ecosystems.</b> Phytoplankton sampling was performed bi-monthly from August 2009 to June 2110 at three sites in the Solon de Lucena Lake, Jaguaribe River and Águas Minerais reservoir. METHODS: The environmental variables were water temperature, transparency, depth, degree of infestation of aquatic macrophytes, air temperature, wind speed, solar radiation and precipitation. The phytoplankton community was studied in terms of richness, density, diversity and evenness. The data were treated with analysis of variance and canonical correspondence analysis. RESULTS: Spatial variations in the data only occurred between ecosystems (p < 0. 05). The reservoir and river exhibited typical phytoplankton of lotic environments, with a greater richness of Bacillariophyta (52. 8 % and 47. 8 %, respectively). The lake exhibited the typical richness lentic environments, with the greatest contribution from Chlorophyta (52. 8 %). This ecosystem was characterized by an absence of macrophytes, a low degree of water transparency (0. 3 ± 0 m) and high algal density (89, 903 ± 38, 542 ind. mL- 1), with a dominance of Aphanocapsa nubilum. In the river environment, the lesser diversity (0. 64 ± 0. 24 bit. ind- 1) was associated to lesser richness (2. 4 ± 0. 5 spp.) and lesser evenness (0. 39 ± 0. 19) in comparison to the other ecosystems. The influence of macrophytes in the river and reservoir contributed toward the introduction of metaphytes and epiphytes in the phytoplankton, which was explained by the direct relationship between the density of these species and macrophytes. CONCLUSION: Thus, water transparency and macrophytes were the main factors related to fluctuations between the different <b>aquatic</b> <b>ecosystems</b> studied...|$|R

Coupling between viruses and bacteria was studied, focusing both on hydrologic dynamics and anthropogenic forced turbidity in the system (Lake Batata). Samples were taken during four hydrologic seasons at both natural and impacted sites to count virus-like particles (VLP) and bacteria. In parallel, virus-infected bacteria were identified and quantified by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Viral abundance ranged from 0. 5 × 107 ± 0. 2 × 107 VLP ml− 1 (high-water season, impacted site) to 1. 7 × 107 ± 0. 4 × 107 VLP ml− 1 (low-water season, natural site). These data were strongly correlated with the bacterial abundance (r 2 = 0. 84; P < 0. 05), which ranged from 1. 0 × 106 ± 0. 5 × 106 cells ml− 1 (high water, impacted site) to 3. 4 × 106 ± 0. 7 × 106 cells ml− 1 (low water, natural site). Moreover, the viral abundance was weakly correlated with chlorophyll a, suggesting that most viruses were bacteriophages. TEM quantitative analyses revealed that the frequency of visibly infected cells was 20 %, with 10 ± 3 phages per cell section. In general, we found a low virus-bacterium ratio (< 7). Both the close coupling between the viral and bacterial abundances and the low virus-bacterium ratio suggest that viral abundance tends to be driven by the reduction of hosts for viral infection. Our results demonstrate that viruses are controlled by biological substrates, whereas in addition to grazing, bacteria are regulated by physical processes caused by turbidity, which affect underwater light distribution and dissolved organic carbon availability...|$|R

Nevertheless, not much {{research has been}} done on the impact of pesticides on <b>tropical</b> <b>aquatic</b> <b>ecosystems,</b> which are often contaminated by runoff-related pesticide inputs due to unpredictable and torrential rainfalls. This study aimed to: (i) adapt and evaluate a short-term sublethal in situ assay using post-exposure feeding as an endpoint, to the tropical cladoceran species Diaphanosoma brachyurum (collected at the Pedra do Cavalo dam in the Paraguacu River basin, Bahia, Brazil), and, (ii) assess the role of the standard species Daphnia magna as an adequate laboratory surrogate. Lethal and sublethal (post-exposure feeding) responses were assessed for the two species. To evaluate these responses under environmentally realistic exposure conditions, a runoff event was simulated in an agricultural area previously contaminated with different deltamethrin concentrations. The resultant runoff water was used to set up microcosms with different dilutions, simulating the entrance of runoff water in an adjacent lentic system. An in situ assay with D. brachyurum was performed inside the microcosms, allowing to discriminate the effects due to deltamethrin from those due to other potential stressors associated with the experimental design (e. g. organism handling, load of suspended particles, microcosm design). Water samples were collected from microcosms to conduct a laboratory assay with D. magna. The in situ methodologies revealed to be suitable to conduct assays with D. brachyurum under tropical conditions, since all exposed organisms were successfully retrieved from the chambers. Furthermore, none of the potential stressors associated with the experimental design influenced the daphnids' performance. The tropical cladoceran species, exposed under more realistic conditions, revealed to be more sensitive than the laboratory standard species: lethal effects were only observed for D. brachyurum and sublethal effects were noticed at a lower deltamethrin concentration for this species than for D. magna.

However, {{few studies have}} focused on the effect of the interaction between these factors on bacterial processes, and none have been performed in <b>tropical</b> <b>aquatic</b> <b>ecosystems.</b> We analyzed the main and interactive effects of changes in water temperature and N and P concentrations on bacterioplankton production (BP), respiration (BR) and growth efficiency (BGE) in tropical coastal lagoons. We used a factorial design with 3 levels of water temperature (25, 30 and 35 °C) and 4 levels of N and/or P additions (Control, N, P and NP additions) in five tropical humic lagoons. When data for all lagoons were pooled together, a weak interaction was observed between the increase in water temperature and the addition of nutrients. Water temperature alone had the greatest impact on bacterial metabolism by increasing BR, decreasing BP, and decreasing BGE. An increase of 1 °C lead to an increase of ~ 4 % in BR, a decrease of ~ 0. 9 % in BP, and a decrease of ~ 4 % in BGE. When data were analyzed separately, lagoons responded differently to nutrient additions depending on DOC concentration. Lagoons with lowest DOC concentrations showed the strongest responses to nutrient additions: BP increased in response to N, P and their interaction, BR increased in response to N and the interaction between N and P, and BGE was negatively affected, mainly by the interaction between N and P additions. Lagoons with the highest DOC concentrations showed almost no significant relationship with nutrient additions. Taken together, these results show that different environmental drivers impact bacterial processes at different scales. Changes of bacterial metabolism related to the increase of water temperature are consistent between lagoons, therefore their consequences can be predicted at a regional scale, while the effect of nutrient inputs is specific to different lagoons but seems {{to be related to the}} DOC concentration...|$|R

Nevertheless, not much {{research has been}} done on the impact of pesticides on <b>tropical</b> <b>aquatic</b> <b>ecosystems,</b> which are often contaminated by runoff-related pesticide inputs due to unpredictable and torrential rainfalls. This study aimed to: (i) adapt and evaluate a short-term sublethal in situ assay using post-exposure feeding as an endpoint, to the tropical cladoceran species Diaphanosoma brachyurum (collected at the Pedra do Cavalo dam in the Paraguaçu River basin, Bahia, Brazil), and, (ii) assess the role of the standard species Daphnia magna as an adequate laboratory surrogate. Lethal and sublethal (post-exposure feeding) responses were assessed for the two species. To evaluate these responses under environmentally realistic exposure conditions, a runoff event was simulated in an agricultural area previously contaminated with different deltamethrin concentrations. The resultant runoff water was used to set up microcosms with different dilutions, simulating the entrance of runoff water in an adjacent lentic system. An in situ assay with D. brachyurum was performed inside the microcosms, allowing to discriminate the effects due to deltamethrin from those due to other potential stressors associated with the experimental design (e. g. organism handling, load of suspended particles, microcosm design). Water samples were collected from microcosms to conduct a laboratory assay with D. magna. The in situ methodologies revealed to be suitable to conduct assays with D. brachyurum under tropical conditions, since all exposed organisms were successfully retrieved from the chambers. Furthermore, none of the potential stressors associated with the experimental design influenced the daphnids’ performance. The tropical cladoceran species, exposed under more realistic conditions, revealed to be more sensitive than the laboratory standard species: lethal effects were only observed for D. brachyurum and sublethal effects were noticed at a lower deltamethrin concentration for this species than for D. magna...|$|R

40|$|Hypoxia in {{freshwater}} ecosystems of the Australian wet tropics occurs naturally, but {{is increasing}} {{as a result}} of anthropogenic influences. Diel cycling of dissolved oxygen (DO) concentration (fluctuating hypoxia) is common in the region. Laboratory experiments sought to identify relationships between severity of fluctuating hypoxia and sublethal effects on ventilation, feeding and growth for juvenile barramundi (Lates calcarifer), eastern rainbowfish (Melanotaenia splendida splendida) and sooty grunter (Hephaestus fuliginosus). Fish continued to feed and grow under daily exposure to severe fluctuating hypoxia treatments for several weeks. Ventilation rates increased in a significant direct quadratic relationship with the severity of hypoxia treatments and increasing hypoxia caused ventilatory behaviour changes in all species. Barramundi and rainbowfish attempted aquatic surface respiration and were more tolerant of severe hypoxia than was sooty grunter; barramundi and rainbowfish {{are also more likely to}} experience hypoxia in the wild. There was a significant quadratic relationship between growth and minimum DO saturation for barramundi. Although all three species were tolerant of hypoxia, anthropogenic stressors on <b>tropical</b> Australian <b>aquatic</b> <b>ecosystems</b> may increase the frequency and severity of hypoxic conditions causing a concomitant increase in fish kill events...|$|R
40|$|Trophic {{studies are}} key {{components}} in animal ecology and fisheries research. Although stomach samples are often obtained from fisheries, diet studies that consider {{the influence of}} fisheries on dietary results are still lacking. Here, the diet of the draughtboard shark Cephaloscyllium laticeps, an abundant mesopredator in Tasmanian waters, was investigated. Stomach samples were obtained from gillnet and craypot fisheries sourced from 4 regions: central (100 % gillnet), east coast (63 % gillnet, 37 % craypot), northwest (100 % gillnet), and southwest Tasmania (100 % craypot). Overall, C. laticeps consumed the same prey types in all regions, but the importance of some prey varied significantly between regions. Generalized linear models showed that region was the main factor affecting prey abundance in the diet. Fishing method had some influence on the abundance of some prey (crabs, octopus, and other molluscs (gastropods and bivalves)), but the effect of fishing method on pot-related species such as Jasus edwardsii (lobster) and octopus was not as prevalent as expected. The common occurrence of C. laticeps as a bycatch species and its high consumption of targeted fishery species (lobsters and octopus) indicates that C. laticeps has a strong interaction with the fisheries. Therefore, {{the relationship between these}} fishery species and C. laticeps should be considered in food web studies in Tasmanian waters. Fil: Barnett, Adam. Deakin University.

40|$|Até o momento não há um estudo que objetivou sintetizar a {{magnitude}} e variação do papel dos invertebrados aquáticos sobre a decomposição do detrito foliar em ambientes aquáticos. Além disso, existe uma falta de conhecimento sobre qual é o impacto geral desses pequenos organismos na decomposição foliar. Além do mais, existe um quantidade de controvérsias sobre como e quais devem ser os fatores mais influentes nesse processo ecológico. O objetivo deste estudo foi através de uma abordagem meta-analítica, entender como estes organismos afetam a decomposição foliar em ecossistemas aquáticos, e como este efeito varia de acordo com aspectos ecológicos e metodológicos. Foram incluídos estudos que avaliaram as taxas de decaimento exponencial na presença e ausência de invertebrados, sendo abordadas apenas as variáveis presentes em mais de 90 % dos estudos do banco de dados. Como esperado, a presença dos invertebrados acelera a decomposição foliar e su{{a magnitude}} do efeito em escala global é consistente. Este efeito não difere em relação ao tipo de ecossistema (lótico ou lêntico), temperatura ou latitude. Portanto, esta análise contradiz o argumento que invertebrados tem um maior papel na decomposição em ecossistemas de altas latitudes enquanto microrganismos deveriam ser mais importantes mais próximo aos trópicos. Não observou-se nenhum viés ou quanto aos métodos de exclusão dos invertebrados ou ainda quanto a diferença entre as malhas. Apesar de ser difícil afirmar que não existem efeitos aditivos da exclusão experimental ou ainda a diferença entre as malhas. Provavelmente outros parâmetros não foram incluídos nesta análise poderiam explicar o efeito dos invertebrados na decomposição foliar, entretanto um insuficiente número de parâmetros disponíveis dificultam mais avaliações. Esta síntese conclui que o papel acelerador dos invertebrados detritívoros deveria ser incluída em modelos biogeoquímicos. Mais especificamente, estes modelos deveriam incorporar parâmetros como a origem do detrito e a duração experimental. There is no study aimed to synthesize {{the magnitude and}} variation of aquatic invertebrates for the decomposition of leaf litter in <b>aquatic</b> <b>ecosystems.</b> Furthermore, {{there is also a}} lack of knowledge about what is the overall impact of these small organisms on leaf decomposition. Moreover, {{there are a number of}} controversies that are the most influential factors on one of the most important processes of aquatic ecology. For example, the influence of latitude and temperature or yet the methodology employed for measuring the effect of the aquatic detritivorous invertebrates. Therefore the aim of our study was, through a meta-analytic review, understand how these organisms affect the decomposition of foliar detritus in <b>aquatic</b> <b>ecosystems,</b> and how this effect varies according to the methodological and environmental parameters most used. Through the evaluation of decomposition rates (k) in the presence and absence of these invertebrates 104 independent studies satisfied our selection criteria and were included in the database. To intention present representativeness of the sample, each used parameter in this analysis need to be present in over 90 % of the selected studies. No publication bias was detected, although we verified a significant decrease in the invertebrate decomposition effect in longer experimental duration, indicating that short experiments reveal higher detritivoria while longer experiments manifest lower mass loss. As expected, these results cast reveal that in general the presence of invertebrates accelerates the decomposition process. Furthermore the global effect size, these effect are consistent and do not differ in relation to <b>aquatic</b> <b>ecosystem</b> types (lotic, lentic or marine), temperature or latitude of the experiments, even presenting a slight increase importance of invertebrates in the decomposition process toward lower latitudes. Therefore, this analysis contradicts the argument that invertebrates have a greater role in the decomposition of <b>aquatic</b> <b>ecosystems</b> at higher latitudes while microorganisms would be more important at minors. Temperature result also contradicts the preview and results of this and other reviews where it could reveal some variation of invertebrate effect. No weakness of invertebrate exclusion methods (mesh bags, electric field or toxic) or even the standardized mesh bag difference (a standardized difference between coarse and fine mesh bags) was found. In contrast to the most of literature, these parameters did not show any significant relationship with the effect size. However should be difficult affirm there is no additive effects of experimental exclusion or also standardized mesh size difference. Conversely, other factors interfere significantly in the decomposition mediated by invertebrates such as detritus origin (allochthonous or autochthonous) and experimental duration. Probably other parameters besides the not included in this analysis could explain the effect of invertebrates on leaf decomposition, however an insufficient number of available parameters hamper this assay. We conclude that this synthesis indicates that the role of detritivorous invertebrates should be included in biogeochemical models, which consider nutrient cycling in temperate or <b>tropical</b> <b>aquatic</b> <b>ecosystems.</b> More specifically these models should incorporate environmental parameters such as detritus origin, as well methodological parameters such as experimental duration...|$|R
