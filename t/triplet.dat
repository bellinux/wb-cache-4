5|$|Natural {{selection}} {{has led to}} codon assignments of {{the genetic}} code that minimize the effects of mutations. A recent hypothesis suggests that the <b>triplet</b> code was derived from codes that used longer than <b>triplet</b> codons (such as quadruplet codons). Longer than <b>triplet</b> decoding would increase codon redundancy and would be more error resistant. This feature could allow accurate decoding absent complex translational machinery such as the ribosome, such as before cells began making ribosomes.|$|E

Statistically significant excess of the hierarchical configurations for the galaxy <b>triplets</b> of the Local Supercluster (LS) is established. The samples of the Interacting, Northern and Southern galaxy <b>triplets</b> do not demonstrate the same excess. Our results testify that the model of the dark matter concentrated in the halo of individual galaxies is convenient for dynamically young systems to which the most of LS <b>triplets</b> belong, whereas the model of the dark matter concentrated in the <b>triplet’s</b> volume is more convenient for the compact <b>triplets.</b> Key words: galaxies, galaxy <b>triplets,</b> Local Supercluster, dark matter...|$|R

40|$|Using {{functional}} {{magnetic resonance}} imaging (fMRI), the present study examined the neural mechanisms involved in recognizing spatial configurations of a scene from multiple viewpoints. Prior to scanning, participants were instructed to learn a desktop array of seven objects relative to an intrinsic direction that was different from the participants' viewpoint. During scanning, participants recognized <b>triplets</b> of objects from the previously memorized scene and from a mirror reflection of the scene at different perspectives. Half of the <b>triplets</b> included two objects located along the instructed intrinsic direction (intrinsic <b>triplets)</b> and the other half did not (non-intrinsic <b>triplets).</b> Consistent with previous mental rotation studies, bilateral intraparietal sulcus and bilateral middle frontal gyrus showed increasing activation with the angular disparity between the test view and the study view. The right intraparietal sulcus was more activated to the non-intrinsic <b>triplets</b> than the intrinsic <b>triplets.</b> The anterior cingulate cortex was more deactivated in recognizing non-intrinsic <b>triplets</b> and novel views. These findings are consistent with the behavioral results that recognition was easier for intrinsic <b>triplets</b> than for non-intrinsic <b>triplets</b> and easier for the familiar view than for novel views (Mou et al., 2008 a) ...|$|R

5|$|Persistent carbenes {{can exist}} in the singlet or the <b>triplet</b> states with the singlet state carbenes being more stable.

5|$|The {{permutations}} of B1 are {{the number}} of ways to relabel the 9 digits, 9! = 362880. Counting the permutations for B2 is more complicated, because the choices for B2 depend on the values in B1. (This is a visual representation of the expression given above.) The conditional calculation needs a branch (sub-calculation) for each alternative. Fortunately, there are just 4 cases for the top B2 <b>triplet</b> (r21): it contains either 0, 1, 2, or 3 of the digits from the B1 middle row triplet(r12). Once this B2 top row choice is made, {{the rest of the}} B2 combinations are fixed. The Band1 row <b>triplet</b> labels are shown on the right.|$|E
