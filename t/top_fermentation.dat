50|$|<b>Top</b> <b>{{fermentation}}</b> or high fermentation is a brewing {{method for}} beer whereby the yeast floats {{on top of}} the wort. The yeast is Saccharomyces cerevisiae. <b>Top</b> <b>fermentation</b> is done at an ambiant temperature of 15-25 °C, {{depending on the type of}} beer.|$|E
50|$|<b>Top</b> <b>fermentation</b> is {{a process}} that is {{difficult}} to control, because unwanted bacteria might contaminate the brew due to the high ambiant temperature. The final result of a brew might vary quite drmamtically. After the first fermentation the beer is tasted and for certain beers fermented again. This second fermentation can be done in an open tub or in the bottle. In the latter case the beer is bottled with added extra sugar and yeast.|$|E
5000|$|Tooheys Old {{is a dark}} ale type of beer {{produced}} in Australia by Tooheys. It has been brewed since 1869 and Tooheys began bottling it in 1970. It has 4.41% alcohol per volume while only containing 132 calories. It is on tap in many bars in New South Wales, Australian Capital Territory, South Australia and Queensland. It is made with <b>top</b> <b>fermentation</b> ale yeast, lightly hopped with black malt giving it a very dark, almost blackish, colour.|$|E

50|$|In the brewing {{industry}} flocculation {{has a different}} meaning. It {{is a very important}} process in fermentation during the production of beer where cells form macroscopic flocs. These flocs cause the yeast to sediment or rise to the <b>top</b> of a <b>fermentation</b> {{at the end of the}} fermentation. Subsequently, the yeast can be collected (cropped) from the <b>top</b> (ale <b>fermentation)</b> or the bottom (lager fermentation) of the fermenter in order to be reused for the next fermentation. While it appears similar to sedimentation in colloidal dispersions, the mechanisms are different.|$|R
50|$|An artisanal (non-conglomerate) brewer, Brunehaut employs ancient Belgian brewing recipes, {{dating from}} the First Crusade and {{documented}} from 1096. Combining <b>top</b> (in-bottle) <b>fermentation</b> with modern production technologies, Brewmaster Damien Delneste's signature beers include Dubble and Tripel bottle-conditioned ales, consistent with 1000+-year-old Belgian brewing tradition.|$|R
50|$|Uley Brewery was {{established}} in the 1980s, in a Grade II listed building that {{had been part of the}} 1833 Price Brewery which closed at the end of the 19th century. The brewery was purchased and refitted by current owner Chas Wright, complete with custom-made brewing vessels. The brewery is situated above a natural spring, and uses Maris Otter barley malt (sourced from Tuckers Maltings, Newton Abbot), Fuggles and Goldings hops, and a traditional method of <b>top</b> <b>fermentation.</b> Its range of ales includes Old Spot Prize Ale, a 5% abv old ale, and Uley Bitter, a 4% abv cask bitter.|$|E
50|$|FEMSA's brands today include Tecate, Sol, Dos Equis, Carta Blanca, Superior, Indio, Bohemia, and Noche Buena. Grupo Modelo's brands include Corona, Corona Light, Negra Modelo, Modelo Especial, Victoria, Estrella, Léon, Montejo, and Pacifico. Most {{of these}} beers are lagers brewed in large {{industrial}} plants, and made with minimal malt. Except for some dark beers, such as Dos Equis Ambar, León Negra, Negra Modelo, and Noche Buena, which are Vienna-style beers, almost all beer produced in Mexico is pilsner. Beers with <b>top</b> <b>fermentation</b> had been produced in Mexico. The Cervecería Toluca {{was founded in}} 1865 by a Swiss especially to produce this type of beer, but the introduction of Bohemian-style beers through the giant brewery Cuauhtémoc would define Mexican beer as pilsner.|$|E
40|$|The {{saccharide}} spectrum, as {{a distribution}} of fractions of different molecular mass, of sixteen beers {{was determined by}} ultracentrifugation using filters with cut-offs of 1, 5, 10 and 50 kDa. The saccharide concentrations in the filtrates were determined by density measurements. The saccharide composition was examined through HPAEC-PAD. The results were compared with the values of classic features of beers. The newly developed method provides additional information of the beers and is a simple and fast tool for exploring {{the effect of the}} saccharide spectrum on the industrial characteristics. The results revealed that similar <b>top</b> <b>fermentation</b> beers and similar lager beers have different saccharide spectra...|$|E

50|$|Currently, {{a popular}} {{fermentation}} lock that mounts on <b>top</b> of the <b>fermentation</b> vessel is the three-piece fermentation lock. Other models contain three bulbous chambers {{allowing for a}} broader range of pressure equalization.

40|$|In model {{oxidized}} media, six theaspirane-derived compounds {{were identified}} by gas chromatography-high resolution mass spectrometry: 4 -hydroxy- 7, 8 -dihydro-β-ionone, 6 -hydroxy- 7, 8 -dihydro-α-ionone, dihydrodehydro-β-ionone, two monoepoxides, and a derived alcohol. Only 4 -hydroxy- 7, 8 -dihydro-β-ionone and dihydrodehydro-β-ionone have been described previously in the literature. Investigation of hop revealed five of these compounds in free form together with theaspirane (especially in the Mosaic variety), while the Citra and Amarillo hop varieties emerged as very interesting {{for the release of}} theaspirane, 4 -hydroxy- 7, 8 -dihydro-β-ionone, and dihydrodehydro-β-ionone from glucoside precursors. For the first time, theaspirane, 4 -hydroxy- 7, 8 -dihydro-β-ionone, 6 -hydroxy- 7, 8 -dihydro-α-ionone, and both monoepoxides were found in a fresh commercial <b>top</b> <b>fermentation</b> beer (only theaspirane, 4 -hydroxy- 7, 8 -dihydro-β-ionone, and dihydrodehydro-β-ionone have recently been mentioned as Gueuze constituents) ...|$|E
40|$|When {{bound to}} the {{envelope}} of viruses, factor H (FH), a soluble regulator of complement activation, contributes to the protection against a potent immune defense mechanism, the complement-mediated lysis (CML). Thus, removing FH from the surface renders viruses, such as HIV, susceptible to CML. For a proof of concept, we developed a construct consisting of recombinant bifunctional single-chain variable fragment (scFv) based on a monoclonal antibody against Friend murine leukemia virus (F-MuLV) envelope protein gp 70, which was coupled to specific binding domains (short consensus repeats 19 - 20; SCR 1920) of FH. We used Pichia pastoris as expression system in common shake flasks and optimized expression in high density bench <b>top</b> <b>fermentation.</b> Specific binding of recombinant scFv was proven by flow cytometry. The recombinant scFv-SCR significantly enhanced CML of F-MuLV in vitro implying that FH binding to the viral surface was impaired by the scFv-SCR. This novel concept to enhance virolysis may provide a new approach for antiviral treatment...|$|E
40|$|The diploma {{thesis is}} divided into two main parts. The first part is a compilation of {{available}} publications devoted to the beer production. This theoretical summary is focused mainly on the wort fermentation and discusses important and commonly used brewing yeast strains of the bottom and <b>top</b> <b>fermentation.</b> Moreover, the metabolism of yeast cells, resources essential to their life cycle and compounds that occur in the final product are described in the thesis. The second part of the thesis is a practical part containing data from the research focused on top-fermenting yeast strains available on the Czech market. The selected top-fermenting yeast strains were used for the wort fermentation created by the unified production technology. Obtained beer samples were subsequently analysed by laboratory techniques as well as by sensory analysis. In conclusion, this thesis compares the amount of the alcohol, true extract and original wort in individual beer samples. Additionally, the amount of residual sugars, and glycerol and ethanol levels in these samples were compared by HPLC analysis...|$|E

2500|$|Saccharomyces cerevisiae {{is used in}} brewing beer, when it is {{sometimes}} called a top-fermenting or top-cropping yeast.

40|$|The {{development}} and applications of biosensors {{in the food}} industry has had a rapid grown due to their sensitivity, specificity and simplicity of use with respect to classical analytical methods. In this study, glucose and ethanol amperometric biosensors integrated with a wireless telemetry system were developed and used for the monitoring of <b>top</b> and bottom <b>fermentations</b> in beer wort samples. The collected data were in good agreement with those obtained by reference methods. The simplicity of construction, the low cost and the short time of analysis, combined with easy interpretation of the results, suggest that these devices could be a valuable alternative to conventional methods for monitoring fermentation processes in the food industry...|$|R
40|$|SUMMARY: Four {{strains of}} lactobacilli, {{isolated}} from the contaminant flora of English <b>top</b> <b>fermentation</b> brewers ’ yeasts, {{were found to be}} heterofermentative. Two strains were tentatively identified as Lactobacillus brevis. For growth, all the strains required exogenous supplies of a number of growth factors of the vitamin B complex, a pyrimidine, a t least one purine and at least 14 amino acids. The ability of hypo-xanthine to substitute for both adenine and guinane in one strain of L. brevis is especially notable. L-Arginine, essential for the growth of all strains, increased the rate and final amount of growth in glucose medium of both strains of L. brevis, when it was supplied in relatively high concentration. Suspensions of the organisms con-verted arginine into ornithine, ammonia and a small amount of citrulline. Maltose, fructose and L-arabinose were better substrates for the growth of all strains than glucose, which, as major source of energy, supported little or no growth of the two unidentified strains. All the strains transformed fructose into mannitol. The rate and extent of growth of most strains on hexoses and the rate of growth of all strains on maltose were increased by the presence of acetate. Whereas the strains of L. brewi...|$|E

40|$|Aflatoxin B 1 (AFB 1) is a {{contaminant}} {{of grain}} and fruit and {{has one of}} the highest levels of carcinogenicity of any natural toxin. AFB 1 and the fungi that produce it can also contaminate the raw materials used for beer and wine manufacture, such as corn and grapes. Therefore, brewers must ensure strict monitoring to reduce the risk of contamination. In this study, the fate of AFB 1 during the fermentation process was investigated using laboratory-scale bottom and <b>top</b> beer <b>fermentation</b> and wine fermentation. During fermentation, cool wort beer samples and wine must samples were artificially spiked with AFB 1 and the levels of AFB 1 remaining after fermentation were analyzed. AFB 1 levels were unchanged during both types of fermentation used for beer but were reduced to 30 % of their initial concentration in wine. Differential analysis of the spiked and unspiked wine samples showed that the degradation compound was AFB 2 a, a hydrated derivative of AFB 1. Thus, the results showed that the risk of AFB 1 carryover was still present for both types of beer fermentation but was reduced in the case of wine fermentation because of hydration...|$|R

40|$|The {{partition}} of surfactants {{and of a}} biosurfactant-producing microorganism was studied in polyethylene glycol and dextran aqueous two-phase systems. In the presence of sodium phosphate, surfactants distributed themselves according to their charge. Cationic surfactants preferred the bottom phase, while anionic surfactants were attracted to the top phase. Increasing the phosphate molarity, the pH, the polymer concentration or molecular weight all resulted in a more one-sided surfactant partitioning. Biosurfactant partition was weaker than synthetic surfactant partition due to their weaker effective charge and lack of strong specific affinity {{for one of the}} polymers. Bacillus subtilis cells partitioned very strongly to the bottom phase. Its biosurfactant, surfactin, was found in slightly larger quantities in the <b>top</b> phase. Batch <b>fermentations</b> were carried out in an aqueous two-phase system. Bacterial growth was not inhibited by the high polymer concentration. Surfactin was produced earlier and in larger quantities than in the regular mineral salts medium...|$|R
50|$|Harvesting {{takes place}} {{by hand and}} each parcel is worked by the same team of workers to {{increase}} the teams' familiarity with the individual vines. The harvest of the white grapes takes place very early due to the proximity {{to the city of}} Bordeaux which results in a warmer microclimate and thus earlier ripening. The white grapes are picked as late as possible, sorted and then pneumatically pressed in whole bunches. There is no skin contact and fermentation takes place in oak barrels with indigenous yeast. After sorting in the field, the red grapes are destemmed, crushed and moved to a special double-tank with fermentation taking place in the <b>top</b> and malolactic <b>fermentation</b> in the bottom, using gravity to move the wine. Previously ageing took place in 100% new oak casks lasting 18 months. This has been reduced to 35% new casks and wine destined for the second wine Le Clarence is aged in 25% new oak. The white wine is aged in 40-45% new oak for 10-12 months. Château Haut-Brion has its own cooperage.|$|R
5000|$|Throughout the {{fermentation}} process, {{carbon dioxide}} is released as a byproduct of the conversion of sugar into alcohol. The carbon dioxide seeks {{to escape from the}} must by rising {{to the top of the}} mixture, pushing the grape skins and other materials to the top as well. This forms what is known as a cap that is visible on <b>top</b> of the <b>fermentation</b> vessel. At this point, a very limited amount of the must comes into contact with the skins, and winemakers seek to correct this by pushing down the cap (either with equipment or the traditional method of treading with their feet) or by pumping wine out from under and over onto the cap. This process of [...] "pumping over" [...] or [...] "punching down" [...] the cap is done often throughout the fermentation process, depending on the extent of maceration the winemaker desires. [...] An efficient and modern method of maceration is the [...] "pneumatage process" [...] in which compressed air or gas is sequentially injected into the juice. The bubbles created during the pneumatage process uses gravity and the weight of the juice to circulate the wine juice with the cap of skins and grape solids allowing for greater extraction of aroma, coloring agents and tannins to diffuse into the wine juice ("must").|$|R
