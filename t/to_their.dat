5|$|A toddler who is {{securely}} {{attached to his}} or her parent (or other familiar caregiver) will explore freely while the caregiver is present, typically engages with strangers, is often visibly upset when the caregiver departs, and is generally happy to see the caregiver return. The extent of exploration and of distress are affected, however, by the child's temperamental make-up and by situational factors as well as by attachment status. A child's attachment is largely influenced by their primary caregiver's sensitivity <b>to</b> <b>their</b> needs. Parents who consistently (or almost always) respond <b>to</b> <b>their</b> child's needs will create {{securely attached}} children. Such children are certain that their parents will be responsive <b>to</b> <b>their</b> needs and communications.|$|E

5|$|Active and cheerful, the Russian Toy was {{originally}} bred {{both as an}} anti-rat dog and a watch dog. The second quality is still active in the breed, {{and they can be}} very vocal.

To pay for the military buildup, Congress imposed new taxes on property: the Direct Tax of 1798. It was the first (and last) such federal tax.

5|$|Bats seem to {{make use}} of {{particularly}} strong venomotion, a rhythmic contraction of venous wall muscles. In most mammals, the walls of the veins provide mainly passive resistance, maintaining their shape as deoxygenated blood flows through them, but in bats they appear to actively support blood flow back to the heart with this pumping action. Due <b>to</b> <b>their</b> relatively small and lightweight bodies, bats are not at risk of blood flow rushing <b>to</b> <b>their</b> heads when roosting.|$|E
