5|$|An infant with an anxious-avoidant {{pattern of}} {{attachment}} will avoid or ignore the caregiver—showing little emotion when the caregiver departs or returns. The infant will not explore very much {{regardless of who}} is there. Infants classified as anxious-avoidant (A) represented a puzzle in the early 1970s. They did not exhibit distress on separation, and either ignored the caregiver on their return (A1 subtype) or showed some <b>tendency</b> to approach together with some <b>tendency</b> to ignore or {{turn away from the}} caregiver (A2 subtype). Ainsworth and Bell theorized that the apparently unruffled behaviour of the avoidant infants was in fact a mask for distress, a hypothesis later evidenced through studies of the heart-rate of avoidant infants.|$|E

At high forward speeds, the precession is usually too slow, contributing to an uncontrolled bike’s <b>tendency</b> to understeer and eventually fall over without ever having reached the upright position. This instability is very slow, on the order of seconds, and is easy for most riders to counteract. Thus a fast bike may feel stable even though it is actually not self-stable and would fall over if it were uncontrolled.|$|E
40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to present a {{synthesis}} of transnational <b>tendencies</b> in multinational enterprises (MNEs), to theoretically analyse the result and to study whether managers in MNEs have experienced the predicted <b>tendencies.</b> Design/methodology/approach – The synthesis is based on an extensive literature review which is analysed by transaction cost economics. Identified <b>tendencies</b> are studied in a survey of managers in MNEs. Research limitations/implications – The study provides an overview of a fragmented research area and suggests explanations for new <b>tendencies</b> described in the literature. The empirical study suggests that some <b>tendencies</b> have been more prevalent than others. Practical implications – The survey was conducted with MNEs with substantial activities in Sweden. It investigates how managers perceive changes that have occurred during the past several years.

40|$|Systemising” and “Empathising” are two {{cognitive}} <b>tendencies</b> {{that individuals}} rely {{on to make}} sense of the world. Systemising involves the observation of environmental contingencies and the consequent formulation of concrete rules to predict events. Empathising is the drive to attribute affective states to others, and to guide responses based on these inferences. High Anxiety is linked to negative, and erroneous, interpretations of social information, and it is possible that the introduction of systems, and therefore predictive utility, might appeal to anxious individuals. It was hypothesised that individuals with high trait anxiety levels would report higher systemising <b>tendencies</b> and lower empathising <b>tendencies</b> than their less anxious peers. A total of 223 participants completed measures of trait anxiety, empathising and systemising <b>tendencies,</b> and autistic traits. Consistent with the hypotheses, individuals with higher levels of trait anxiety demonstrated high systemising <b>tendencies</b> and relatively low empathising <b>tendencies,</b> whilst their less anxious peers demonstrated balanced <b>tendencies</b> in both domains. The High Anxiety group also scored highest on the self-reported measure of autistic traits. This research has identified anxiety as a potential facilitator of divergence in cognitive <b>tendencies,</b> which will be further enhanced by studies in clinical populations...|$|R

This study aims to measure Jordanian consumers' ethnocentric <b>tendencies</b> towards Arabian products and to explore how such ethnocentric <b>tendencies</b> vary based on their demographic variables. Data were collected from a total of 372 Arab Jordanian consumers who live in Amman city {{during the winter of}} 2008. The findings of the current study indicate that Jordanian consumers have strong ethnocentric <b>tendencies</b> towards purchasing products of Arab countries. Moreover, the findings reveal that Jordanian consumers' ethnocentric <b>tendencies</b> towards purchasing Arabian products did not vary by gender, marital status, income and age. However, geographical location proved to have significant influence on Jordanians' ethnocentric <b>tendencies</b> towards products made in Arab countries. Overall, the concept of consumer ethnocentrism can help Arab and global marketers to develop more effective marketing strategies. </p...|$|R
40|$|The present thesis {{presents}} {{a body of}} research examining collectivistic (vs. individualistic) <b>tendencies</b> in status hierarchies. The literature on natural hierarchies (social class, gender and ethnicity) shows that individualistic <b>tendencies</b> are conspicuous in high-status groups, whereas collectivistic <b>tendencies</b> are prominent in low-status groups. These status differences are assumed to stem from specific socialization processes that occur in high-status and in low-status groups. This thesis extends this perspective by proposing a mere status hypothesis which states that socialization processes are sufficient but not necessary to predict the status discrepancy on collectivistic (vs. individualistic) <b>tendencies.</b> It is argued that the mere asymmetry on a valued dimension between the ingroup and a relevant outgroup would drive collectivistic or individualistic <b>tendencies</b> depending on the ingroup status. A pilot study and sixteen studies tested this hypothesis and explored the boundary conditions in which status differences on collectivistic (vs. individualistic) <b>tendencies</b> are observed...|$|R

A secondary aim was to study the aetiology of emotion attribution ability and its association with psychopathic <b>tendencies</b> and autistic traits. Based on data from a sample of 642 twin pairs, the genetic and nonshared environmental influences related to psychopathic <b>tendencies</b> were largely unique to each phenotype. Common environmental influences between psychopathic <b>tendencies</b> and autistic traits overlapped. Poorer emotion attribution ability was associated with increased psychopathic <b>tendencies</b> and autistic traits, and these associations were mainly explained by common genetic factors...|$|R
