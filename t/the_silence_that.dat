5|$|Without speech, the Scoobies {{resort to}} {{gestures}} or writing. Humorous misperceptions arise from this gesturing when, for example, Buffy mimes driving in a stake—as though killing a vampire—too {{close to her}} pelvis, causing the Scoobies to think she is suggesting masturbating to rid the town of The Gentlemen. In the belfry, while Buffy and Riley are fighting The Gentlemen, Buffy indicates that Riley should smash the box from her dream. He misunderstands and breaks a jar beside it, looks up and grins, awaiting Buffy's approval. The clumsiness of the characters' gesturing is in direct contrast to the grace of The Gentlemen, who communicate easily through gestures and other visual signals. Their communication is simple and direct; nods, head tilts, and hand movements, achieve exactly what they want it to. The Scoobies, however, are confused and accomplish {{the opposite of what}} they intend. When they are rendered silent they are also rendered useless, unsure of how to fight The Gentlemen. According to two Buffy essayists, part of the horror stemming from the arrival of The Gentlemen is <b>the</b> <b>silence</b> <b>that</b> makes the people of Sunnydale helpless, easy victims.|$|E
25|$|On 21 May 1971, Kamanin {{arrived at}} Baikonur {{for his last}} mission launch. Soyuz 11 lifted off 6 June, docked with the station, and {{completed}} the program, but the crew was killed by decompression on their landing run. Kamanin was at the mission control at Eupatoria throughout their fatal descent and left his own transcript of conversation and <b>the</b> <b>silence</b> <b>that</b> followed.|$|E
500|$|While {{there is}} no {{consensus}} as to what specifically has caused <b>the</b> <b>silence</b> <b>that</b> has grown between the speaker and his muse, sonnet 102 seems to be an attempt to mend the relationship by claiming that he still loves as strongly as he ever has. Katherine Duncan-Jones has given the following overview: [...] "Still claiming to have fallen silent, the poet claims that he loves just as much, though he shows it less, for fear of wearisome repetition." ...|$|E

40|$|In this {{dissertation}} I {{begin with}} <b>the</b> claim <b>that</b> <b>silence</b> {{is part of}} moral life. Moral philosophy must {{make every attempt to}} bring within it all that is part of moral life. The dissertation produces a methodology for learning how to see some of <b>the</b> <b>silences</b> <b>that</b> I claim for moral life and it shows <b>the</b> importance of <b>silence</b> to continuing moral self-formation...|$|R
500|$|Some inter-war architects {{developed}} this approach further. Some traditional classical memorials had been criticised in both England and Germany as being fussy and overly ornate. Men such as Lutyens took the classical principles, but simplified {{them until the}} design became almost abstract. These memorials used abstract, beautiful designs intended to remove the viewer from the real world, and focus them on an idealised sense of self-sacrifice, {{a continuation of the}} principle of a [...] "beautiful death". In many ways the simplified, but still classical, forms of memorials like the Cenotaph meant that mourners could read their own thoughts and concerns onto the memorial. Where dead soldiers were shown, they were depicted in an image of serenity and peace, often physically distanced from the viewer on a high platform, the entire effect reflected by <b>the</b> <b>silence</b> <b>that</b> traditionally surrounds ceremonies at the Cenotaph.|$|E
500|$|The {{memorial}} forms a {{sharp contrast}} with both the earlier monuments of the South African War and most monuments contemporary to the First World War. Memorials of the South African War typically included figures of soldiers, sometimes dying in conflict, but always heroically in a [...] "beautiful death". Classical symbolism was often used to distance the event of death from the observer, as typified in William Colton's work at Worcester. Most First World War memorials reacted to the criticism of this approach by adopting cleaner architectural forms, but still retaining the ideal of a [...] "beautiful death", an approach which {{can be seen at}} Lutyens' Southampton Cenotaph, the precursor to his more famous Cenotaph on Whitehall. These memorials frequently used abstract, beautiful designs intended to remove the viewer from the real world, and focus them on an idealised sense of self-sacrifice. Soldiers in these memorials were still frequently depicted as Homeric warriors, and classical ideals and symbols remained popular, as can be seen at the Machine Gun Corps Memorial by Francis Derwent Wood, close to the Royal Artillery Memorial itself. Where dead soldiers were shown, they were depicted in an image of serenity and peace, often physically distanced from the viewer on a high platform, the entire effect reflected by <b>the</b> <b>silence</b> <b>that</b> traditionally surrounds ceremonies at the Cenotaph.|$|E

In this work—particularly Francis’ white dress and the peaceful landscape he inhabits—modern viewers often feel a palpable sense of <b>the</b> <b>silence</b> <b>that</b> was Brewster’s world.|$|E

2500|$|In his audition, Parsons so {{impressed}} series creator Chuck Lorre that Lorre {{insisted on a}} second audition to see if Parsons could replicate the performance. Parsons was cast as Sheldon Cooper, a physicist with social apathy who frequently belittles his friends and the waitress who lives across the hall. The role requires Parsons to [...] "rattle off line after line of tightly composed, rhythmic dialogue, as well as then do something with his face or body during <b>the</b> <b>silence</b> <b>that</b> follows." [...] Parsons credits his University of San Diego training with giving him the tools to break down Sheldon's lines.|$|E

2500|$|Rich's theatre {{specialized}} in what contemporaries called [...] "spectacle." [...] Today {{we might call}} them [...] "special effects." [...] His stagings would endeavour to present actual cannon shots, animals, and multiple illusions of battle. Rich began his work as “Lun” the Harlequin character in 1717, wearing a leotard with diamond shaped patches, and encouraging <b>the</b> <b>silence</b> <b>that</b> became normal for the pantomime character. By 1728, Rich was synonymous with lavish (and successful) productions. Rich performed multiple roles as the “Harlequin” character type while the Company Manager at Lincoln’s Inn Fields, including Harlequin Doctor Faustus. Rich was praised for his movement style, allowing each limb {{to tell a story}} in shows, such as in Harlequin Sorcerer where he portrayed the harlequin being hatched from an egg.|$|E
2500|$|Scissoring is {{commonly}} used as an umbrella term for all forms of tribadism, and many lesbian and bisexual women are unaware {{that some of the}} sexual acts they include in their lovemaking are aspects of and are formally labeled tribadism, as tribadism {{is commonly}} omitted from mainstream sex research. Judith Halberstam, in her book Female Masculinity, stated, [...] "If we trace {{the use of the term}} forward into present, we find that tribadism is one of those rarely discussed but often practiced sexual activities, and <b>the</b> <b>silence</b> <b>that</b> surrounds it now is as puzzling as the discourse it produced in earlier centuries." [...] She added that Sigmund Freud [...] "had nothing to say" [...] with regard to the topic, [...] "and few contemporary lesbian sex books even discuss it".|$|E
2500|$|Israeli {{organization}} B'Tselem {{states that}} there have been [...] "grave violations" [...] of Palestinian human rights in Hebron because of the [...] "presence of the settlers within the city." [...] The organization cites regular incidents of [...] "almost daily physical violence and property damage by settlers in the city", curfews and restrictions of movement that are [...] "among the harshest in the Occupied Territories", and violence by Israeli border policemen and the IDF against Palestinians who live in the city's H2 sector. According to Human Rights Watch, Palestinian areas of Hebron are frequently subject to indiscriminate firing by the IDF, leading to many casualties. One former IDF soldier, with experience in policing Hebron, has testified to Breaking <b>the</b> <b>Silence,</b> <b>that</b> on the briefing wall of his unit a sign describing their mission aim was hung that read: [...] "To disrupt the routine of the inhabitants of the neighbourhood." [...] Hebron mayor Mustafa Abdel Nabi invited the Christian Peacemaker Teams to assist the local Palestinian community in opposition to what they describe as Israeli military occupation, collective punishment, settler harassment, home demolitions and land confiscation.|$|E
