5|$|<b>The</b> <b>argument</b> <b>is</b> {{extended}} to 'all the organized {{parts of the}} works of nature'. Paley considers whether chance alone could explain these, and concludes not.|$|E
5|$|Another {{well-known}} artefact with {{an astronomical}} use is the Antikythera mechanism. In this case {{analysis of the}} artefact, and reference to the description of similar devices described by Cicero, would indicate a plausible use for the device. <b>The</b> <b>argument</b> <b>is</b> bolstered {{by the presence of}} symbols on the mechanism, allowing the disc to be read.|$|E
25|$|Normal order: The leftmost, {{outermost}} redex {{is always}} reduced first. That <b>is,</b> whenever possible <b>the</b> <b>arguments</b> <b>are</b> substituted into <b>the</b> body of an abstraction before <b>the</b> <b>arguments</b> <b>are</b> reduced.|$|R
50|$|By contrast, <b>the</b> <b>arguments</b> <b>are</b> <b>the</b> values {{supplied}} to the procedure {{when it is}} called. Unlike the parameters, which form an unchanging part of the procedure's definition, <b>the</b> <b>arguments</b> may vary from call to call. Each time a procedure is called, {{the part of the}} procedure call that specifies <b>the</b> <b>arguments</b> <b>is</b> called <b>the</b> <b>argument</b> list.|$|R
50|$|The {{question}} of well-definedness of a function classically arises when the defining equation of a function does not (only) refer to <b>the</b> <b>arguments</b> themselves, but (also) to elements of <b>the</b> <b>arguments.</b> This <b>is</b> sometimes unavoidable when <b>the</b> <b>arguments</b> <b>are</b> cosets and <b>the</b> equation refers to coset representatives.|$|R
5|$|The frailty of <b>the</b> <b>argument</b> <b>is</b> that {{it implies}} that God, a being which does not suffer from transworld depravity by the {{assumption}} of omnibenevolence, is unable to recreate a transworld-depravity-free being, which is seemingly contradictory to the assumption of omnipotence.|$|E
5|$|Rowan {{was known}} {{throughout}} his life as an avid gamester. On January 29, 1801, Rowan joined Dr. James Chambers and three other men for a game of cards at Duncan McLean's Tavern in Bardstown. After several beers and games of whist, Chambers suggested playing Vingt-et-un for money instead. Rowan had determined not to gamble during this session of gaming, but impaired by the alcohol, he agreed. After a few hands, an argument broke out between Chambers and Rowan. The exact nature of <b>the</b> <b>argument</b> <b>is</b> not known. Some accounts claim it was over who was better able to speak Latin and Greek; others suggest that general insults were exchanged between the two men. A brief scuffle followed the disagreement.|$|E
5|$|The {{sale of the}} Olympic brand {{has been}} controversial. <b>The</b> <b>argument</b> <b>is</b> that the Games have become indistinguishable from any other commercialised {{sporting}} spectacle. Specific criticism was levelled at the IOC for market saturation during the 1996 Atlanta and 2000 Sydney Games. The cities were awash in corporations and merchants attempting to sell Olympic-related wares. The IOC {{indicated that they would}} address this to prevent spectacles of over-marketing at future Games. Another criticism is that the Games are funded by host cities and national governments; the IOC incurs none of the cost, yet controls all the rights and profits from the Olympic symbols. The IOC also takes a percentage of all sponsorship and broadcast income. Host cities continue to compete ardently for the right to host the Games, even though there is no certainty that they will earn back their investments. Research has shown that trade is around 30 percent higher for countries that have hosted the Olympics.|$|E

25|$|<b>The</b> <b>argument</b> <b>was</b> made in <b>the</b> {{nineteenth century}} by a scholar hostile {{to what the}} Malleus stood for that the {{approbation}} was a forgery by Institoris and that Sprenger {{had nothing to do}} with the composition. The evidence for this is in my view very tenuous (and <b>the</b> main <b>argument</b> <b>is</b> clearly invalid). Nonetheless, once <b>the</b> <b>argument</b> <b>was</b> put forward, it took on a life of its own, and people continue to advance arguments in favor of the idea that Sprenger's involvement was a falsification perpetrated by Institoris, despite the fact that this <b>argument</b> <b>was</b> vitiated from <b>the</b> start.|$|R

25|$|This {{means that}} these sines and cosines are {{different}} functions, {{and that the}} fourth derivative of sine will be sine again only if <b>the</b> <b>argument</b> <b>is</b> in radians.|$|E
25|$|This {{argument}} {{usually involves}} scientists who {{were no longer}} alive when evolution was proposed or whose field of study did not include evolution. <b>The</b> <b>argument</b> <b>is</b> generally rejected as specious by those who oppose creationism.|$|E
25|$|This argument, {{associated}} with Willard Quine and Hilary Putnam, {{is considered by}} Stephen Yablo {{to be one of}} the most challenging arguments in favor of the acceptance of the existence of abstract mathematical entities, such as numbers and sets.

25|$|In sum, <b>the</b> <b>argument</b> <b>is</b> that an {{understanding}} of the mental disorders must not only have a specific knowledge of brain constituents and genetics (inside-the-skin) but also the context (outside-the-skin) in which these parts operate (Koch and Laurent, 1999). Only by joining neurology and psychiatry, it is argued, can this nexus be used to reduce human suffering.|$|E
25|$|The {{arguments}} presented are not {{in general}} arguments against the moral right of Kosovo Albanians to self-determination, but focus on the legality or otherwise of the unilateral action of the Provisional Institutions of Self-Government. As UNSCR 1244 vested all authority in Kosovo in the Special Representative of the Secretary-General, <b>the</b> <b>argument</b> <b>is</b> that the Provisional Institutions had no power to declare independence.|$|E
25|$|The {{mammary gland}} {{is thought to}} have derived from apocrine skin glands. It has been {{suggested}} that the original function of lactation (milk production) was keeping eggs moist. Much of <b>the</b> <b>argument</b> <b>is</b> based on monotremes (egg-laying mammals). The original adaptive significance of milk secretions may have been nutrition or immunological protection. This secretion gradually became more copious and accrued nutritional complexity over evolutionary time.|$|E

25|$|Extrapolation is {{projecting}} {{historical data}} {{into the future}} on the same basis; if prices have risen at a certain rate in the past, {{they will continue to}} rise at that rate forever. <b>The</b> <b>argument</b> <b>is</b> that investors tend to extrapolate past extraordinary returns on investment of certain assets into the future, causing them to overbid those risky assets in order to attempt to continue to capture those same rates of return.|$|E
25|$|In response, {{opponents of}} the bill {{including}} Martin Lee have argued that a potentially repressive bill is more acceptable {{in a system of}} parliamentary democracy and that under British rule, the potential impact of security laws was minimised by the fact that political leaders would suffer political damage if they attempted to enforce these laws. <b>The</b> <b>argument</b> <b>is</b> that in the case where Hong Kong becomes authoritarian, there are fewer restrictions which prevent them drafting bad laws.|$|E
25|$|One {{aspect of}} <b>the</b> <b>argument</b> <b>is</b> that {{by having a}} single toll road system for the state that {{controls}} the major commuter routes into Chicago and the major circumferential route around the city, commuters and long-haul truckers who use the original system that was built in 1958 are subsidizing the subsequent routes, I-88 to Dixon and I-355 in DuPage County. As a result, instead of the original routes becoming freeway, the revenues from the original system subsidized less intensively used routes {{that could not be}} financed on a stand-alone basis.|$|E

25|$|Parasitism {{has been}} {{suggested}} {{as part of the}} explanation of the evolution of secondary sex characteristics in breeding male animals, such as the plumage of peacocks and the manes of male lions. <b>The</b> <b>argument</b> <b>is</b> that female hosts select males for breeding based on such characteristics because they act as honest signals of costly handicaps. A possible mechanism for this, suggested by Ivar Folstad and Andrew Karter, is that the male hormone testosterone encourages the growth of secondary sex characteristics such as manes, but at the price of reducing an animal's immune defences.|$|E
25|$|According to a {{contrary}} {{school of}} thought, there lay not empowerment but disempowerment in the late-medieval promotion of affective piety. In this view {{the women and}} men who practised it were in effect taking a kind of drug (affective ecstasy, so to speak) which kept them fixated on a particular sentimental construction of the ‘humanity’ of Christ, and diverted attention from aspects of his ministry which could pose serious problems for the medieval Church. <b>The</b> <b>argument</b> <b>is</b> that alternative, more challenging, and hence institutionally marginalized delineation of what was important in Christ’s ‘humanity’ and ministry remained visible in heterodox contexts, or lurked in otherwise orthodox writing such as Langland’s.|$|E
25|$|While this {{provides}} a valid proof (for matrices over the complex numbers), <b>the</b> <b>argument</b> <b>is</b> not very satisfactory, since the identities {{represented by the}} theorem do {{not in any way}} depend {{on the nature of the}} matrix (diagonalizable or not), nor on the kind of entries allowed (for matrices with real entries the diagonalizable ones do not form a dense set, and it seems strange one would have to consider complex matrices to see that the Cayley–Hamilton theorem holds for them). We shall therefore now consider only arguments that prove the theorem directly for any matrix using algebraic manipulations only; these also have the benefit of working for matrices with entries in any commutative ring.|$|E
