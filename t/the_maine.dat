5|$|No {{records of}} <b>the</b> <b>Maine</b> Coon's exact origins and date of {{introduction}} to the United States exist, so several competing hypotheses have been suggested. The breed was popular in cat shows in the late 19th century, but its existence became threatened when long-haired breeds from overseas were introduced in the early 20th century. <b>The</b> <b>Maine</b> Coon has since made a comeback and {{is now one of}} the more popular cat breeds in the world.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Maine</b> Coon {{was denied}} {{provisional}} breed status—one {{of the three}} steps required for a breed not yet recognized by the CFA {{to be able to}} compete in championship competitions—by the CFA three times, which {{led to the formation of}} <b>the</b> <b>Maine</b> Coon Cat Club in 1973. The breed was finally accepted by the CFA under provisional status on 1 May 1975, and was approved for championship status on 1 May 1976. The next couple of decades saw a rise in popularity of <b>the</b> <b>Maine</b> Coon, with championship victories and an increase in national rankings. In 1985, the state of Maine announced that the breed would be named the official State Cat. Today <b>the</b> <b>Maine</b> Coon is the third most popular cat breed, according to the number of kittens registered with the CFA.|$|E

5|$|The {{generally}} accepted hypothesis among breeders is that <b>the</b> <b>Maine</b> Coon is {{descended from the}} pairings of local short-haired domestic cats and long-haired breeds brought overseas by English seafarers (possibly by Captain Charles Coon) or 11th-century Norsemen. The connection to the Norsemen {{is seen in the}} strong resemblance of <b>the</b> <b>Maine</b> Coon to the Norwegian Forest Cat, another breed that {{is said to be a}} descendant of cats that traveled with the Norsemen.|$|E

5|$|In 1837, <b>the</b> <b>Maine</b> Temperance Society split {{over whether}} they should seek to ban wine as well as spirits; Dow sided with the anti-wine forces, who formed their own organization, <b>the</b> <b>Maine</b> Temperance Union. That year James Appleton, a Whig {{representative}} in the state legislature, proposed a prohibition law, and Dow spoke often and forcefully {{in favor of the}} effort, which was unsuccessful. Appleton proposed a similar law in 1838 and 1839, but despite his and Dow's best efforts, he continued to be defeated.|$|E
5|$|In 1858, Blaine {{ran for a}} seat in <b>the</b> <b>Maine</b> House of Representatives, and was elected. He ran {{for reelection}} in 1859, 1860, and 1861, and was {{successful}} each time by large majorities. The added responsibilities led Blaine to reduce his duties with the Advertiser in 1860, and he soon ceased editorial work altogether. Meanwhile, his political power was growing as he became chairman of the Republican state committee in 1859, replacing Stevens. Blaine was not a delegate to the Republican convention in 1860, but attended anyway as an enthusiastic supporter of Abraham Lincoln. Returning to Maine, he was elected Speaker of <b>the</b> <b>Maine</b> House of Representatives in 1861 and reelected in 1862. With {{the outbreak of the}} Civil War in 1861, he supported Lincoln’s war effort and saw that <b>the</b> <b>Maine</b> Legislature voted to organize and equip units to join the Union Army.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 20th century, <b>the</b> <b>Maine</b> Coon's {{popularity}} {{began to decline}} {{with the introduction of}} other long-haired breeds, such as the Persian, which originated in the Middle East. The last recorded win by a Maine Coon in a national cat show for over 40 years was in 1911 at a show in Portland, Oregon. The breed was rarely seen after that. The decline was so severe that the breed was declared extinct in the 1950s, although this declaration was considered to be exaggerated and reported prematurely at the time. The Central Maine Cat Club (CMCC) was created in the early 1950s by Alta Smith and Ruby Dyer in attempts to increase the popularity of <b>the</b> <b>Maine</b> Coon. For 11 years, the CMCC held cat shows and hosted exhibitions of photographs of the breed and is noted for creating the first written breed standards for <b>the</b> <b>Maine</b> Coon.|$|E

5|$|The ancestral {{origins of}} <b>the</b> <b>Maine</b> Coon are unknown — {{there are only}} {{speculation}} and folk tales. One such folk tale involves Marie Antoinette, the Queen of France, who was executed in 1793. The story goes that before her death, Antoinette attempted to escape France {{with the help of}} Captain Samuel Clough. She loaded Clough's ship with her most prized possessions, including six of her favorite Turkish Angora cats. Although she did not make it to the United States, her pets safely reached the shores of Wiscasset, Maine, where they bred with other short-haired breeds and developed into the modern breed of <b>the</b> <b>Maine</b> Coon.|$|E
5|$|A myth {{which is}} trait-based, though genetically impossible, {{is the idea}} that the modern Maine Coon descended from {{ancestors}} of semi-feral domestic cats and raccoons. This myth is likely based on the common color of the breed (brown tabby) and its bushy tail. Another idea is that <b>the</b> <b>Maine</b> Coon originated from the matings of domestic cats and wild bobcats, which could explain the tufts of hair that are so commonly seen on the tips of the ears.|$|E
5|$|After his defeat, Dow {{continued}} to promote prohibition around the country, and was gratified {{to see it}} spread to eleven states. He also made efforts to refute the charge made by his enemies (including his cousin John Neal) that <b>the</b> <b>Maine</b> law was ineffective and that drinking had actually increased in Portland during Dow's term in office. In 1854, Dow ran for mayor again unsuccessfully; as the Whig Party began to break apart, Dow attracted support from the Free Soilers and the Know Nothings, a nativist party. By the next year, those two parties began to join anti-slavery Whigs in a new party, the Republicans. They soon controlled the state legislature and, with Dow's encouragement, strengthened the enforcement provisions of <b>the</b> <b>Maine</b> law. Dow ran again for mayor in 1855 and was narrowly re-elected to the office he had left three years earlier.|$|E
