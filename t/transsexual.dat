5|$|Another legend {{about the}} demon Araka {{associates}} Mohini with Krishna {{rather than the}} god himself. The demon Araka had become virtually invincible because he had never laid eyes on a woman (extreme chastity). Krishna {{takes the form of}} the beautiful Mohini and marries him. After three days of marriage, Araka's bonds of chastity are broken, and Krishna kills him in battle. Transgender Hijras consider Krishna-Mohini to be a <b>transsexual</b> deity.|$|E
40|$|No {{differences}} in personality variables between {{primary and secondary}} <b>transsexuals</b> were found. The differential diagnosis suggested between primary and secondary <b>transsexuals</b> {{is likely to be}} clinical useful, even though it can be hardly assessed with a test of personality like the Rorschach. Furthermore, Italian <b>transsexuals</b> seemed to be characterized by impaired reality testing and introspection marked by anxiety, and negative self-image compared to Belgian <b>transsexuals.</b> A different social perception of <b>transsexuals</b> in the two European countries might be responsible of the difficulty encountered by the Italian <b>transsexuals</b> in the adaptation to social reality. Finally, since no major differences between the two sample Italian and Belgian <b>transsexuals</b> were shown, the Rorschach Comprehensive System can be suggested as a valuable assessment tool of personality in European multicenter studies on Gender Identity Disorders subjects.

50|$|Little {{is known}} about erotic {{plasticity}} in <b>transsexuals.</b> Sexual reassignment surgery and hormone therapy (i.e. testosterone) in female-to-male <b>transsexuals</b> produce an increase in their sexual desire, but it is uncertain how erotic plasticity plays a role. Heterosexual female-to-male <b>transsexuals</b> - those who are sexually attracted to women - have more sexual partners than nonheterosexual female-to-male <b>transsexuals,</b> but again, erotic plasticity's role in this - if one actually exists - is uncertain.|$|R
5000|$|In the 2005 {{study by}} Smith and van Goozen, their {{findings}} {{in regards to}} female-to-male <b>transsexuals</b> were different from their findings for male-to-female <b>transsexuals.</b> Smith and van Goozen's study included 52 female-to-male <b>transsexuals,</b> who were categorized as either homosexual or non-homosexual. Smith concluded that female-to-male <b>transsexuals,</b> regardless of sexual orientation, reported more GID symptoms in childhood, and a stronger sense of gender dysphoria. Smith wrote that she found some differences between homosexual and non-homosexual female-to-male <b>transsexuals.</b> Smith says that non-homosexual female-to-males reported more gender dysphoria than any group in her study. Smith says [...] "It is of interest, though, that a few female-to-male <b>transsexuals</b> reported to have been sexually aroused in adolescence when dressing in male clothes, as this has never been reported before." ...|$|R
5|$|In {{the early}} 2010s, British public-service {{broadcaster}} Channel 4 resolved {{to improve the}} accuracy and depth of their representation of transgender people. My <b>Transsexual</b> Summer was the first transgender programme they created after making this resolution. Channel 4 broadcast the series in November 2011. It was rebroadcast in the UK on More4 in 2012, and on ABC2 in Australia in 2013. Also in 2013, two of the show's participants themselves started making documentary short films and videos about transgender.|$|E

5|$|Julie Walters was a {{long term}} {{collaborator}} of Wood's, although unlike Wood and Walters, their previous television series together, only Wood's name remained in the title. This was because in the interim, Wood was getting viewers of it turning up to her solo stand up shows expecting to see a double act. This didn't stop Wood making Walters almost as prominent in this newer series. She played many two handers with Wood {{as well as other}} roles such as Margery the daytime television host, a mad shoe shop lady, the elderly waitress in the Two Soups sketch, and a <b>transsexual</b> hairdresser. Most famously, she was the char-lady Mrs Overall in Acorn Antiques. She later revealed that alongside her starring role in Educating Rita, it's the part she's still recognised the most by the public for.|$|E

The present study examined whether the voice change in female-to-male <b>transsexuals</b> is indeed as straightforward as it is assumed. Results from a sample survey involving 16 female-to-male <b>transsexuals</b> and longitudinal data from two clients suggest that the voice change in female-to-male <b>transsexuals</b> is not always totally unproblematic.

5|$|At {{the start}} of Wandering Son, Shuichi Nitori is a young, {{feminine}} child assigned male at birth (AMAB) {{in the fifth grade}} who transfers into a new school. Shuichi quickly becomes friends with another student, tall, boyish Yoshino Takatsuki. Yoshino soon learns of Shuichi's desire to be a girl. In a show of friendship, Yoshino confesses a similar desire to be a boy. Shuichi also becomes friends with Saori Chiba and Kanako Sasa, two other girls in the class. Saori instantly takes a liking to Shuichi and continuously encourages Shuichi to wear feminine clothes. After Shuichi, Yoshino, and their friends enter sixth grade, Shuichi meets Makoto Ariga, another AMAB student their age from another class who also secretly wants to be a girl. Shuichi and Yoshino become friends with an adult <b>transsexual</b> woman named Yuki who is living with a man named Shiina. Shuichi's older sister Maho becomes a model and eventually becomes friends with Maiko, a teen model whom she idolizes, and two other teen models: Tamaki Satō and Anna Suehiro. Maho gets a boyfriend, Riku Seya, and Shuichi confesses a crush on Yoshino, but Yoshino cannot reciprocate Shuichi's feelings. After Saori learns of this, she confesses she likes Shuichi, but Shuichi too cannot return her feelings. This results in a falling-out between Shuichi's friends as they prepare to enter junior high school.|$|E
5|$|Divine {{considered}} {{himself to be}} male, and was not transgender or <b>transsexual.</b> He was gay, and during the 1980s had an extended relationship with a married man named Lee, who accompanied him almost everywhere that he went. They later separated, and Divine went on to have a brief affair with gay porn star Leo Ford, which was widely reported upon by the gay press. According to his manager Bernard Jay, Divine regularly engaged in sexual activities with young men that he would meet while on tour, sometimes becoming infatuated with them; in one case, he met {{a young man in}} Israel whom he wanted to bring back to the United States, but was prevented from doing so by Jay. This image of promiscuity was disputed by his friend Anne Cersosimo, who claimed that Divine never exhibited such behavior when on tour. Divine initially avoided informing the media about his sexuality, even when questioned by interviewers, and would sometimes hint that he was bisexual, but {{in the latter part of}} the 1980s changed this attitude and began being open about his homosexuality. Nonetheless, he avoided discussing gay rights, partially at the advice of his manager, realizing that it would have had a negative effect on his career.|$|E

50|$|Researchers have {{recently}} found several demographic features that homosexual <b>transsexuals</b> {{tend to have}} in common. Ken Zucker(2002) and Yolanda Smith (2005) independently found that homosexual <b>transsexuals</b> are of lower average IQ, social class, and age. They were on average in their mid-teens to mid-20s when they reported to a gender clinic for sex reassignment.The homosexual <b>transsexuals</b> {{are more likely to}} have recent immigrant status, non-intact families, non-Caucasian race, and childhood behavior problems).

40|$|We use the {{workplace}} experiences of <b>transsexuals</b> – individuals who change their gender typically with hormone therapy and surgery – to provide {{new insights into}} the longstanding question of what role gender places in shaping workplace outcomes. Using an original survey of a sample of male-to-female and female-to-male <b>transsexuals,</b> we document their earnings and employment experiences of <b>transsexuals</b> before and after their gender transitions. We find that while <b>transsexuals</b> have the same human capital after their transitions, their workplace experiences often change radically. For many male-to-female <b>transsexuals,</b> becoming a woman brings a loss of authority and pay, and often harassment and termination. On the other hand, for many female-to-male <b>transsexuals,</b> becoming a man brings increases in workplace respect, authority, and, in some cases, earnings. These findings challenge the omitted variables explanations for the gender pay gap and illustrate the often hidden and subtle processes that produce gender inequality in workplace outcomes. 2 Before and After: Gender Transitions, Human Capital, and Workplace Experience...|$|R
40|$|In {{spite of}} the {{potential}} clinical utility of defense mechanisms {{in the assessment of}} gender identity disorder patients as candidates to sex reassignment surgery, there is paucity of research in this field. The aim of the present study is therefore to ascertain whether the defensive profile of MtF and FtM <b>transsexuals</b> seeking sex reassignment surgery can be defined more primitive, immature and maladaptive than that of the two control groups. We compared the defensive profiles as assessed through the REM- 71 (Steiner et al., 2001) of 104 MtF <b>transsexuals,</b> 46 FtM <b>transsexuals</b> and two control groups of males and females. Our results show that MtF <b>transsexuals</b> present an overall more primitive defensive array than that of both control groups, while FtMs show a profile not dissimilar from that of both control groups. Our results support the hypothesis that MtF <b>transsexuals</b> are characterized by higher proneness to psychopathology than the general population and show a more immature level of psychological functioning than FtM <b>transsexuals...</b>|$|R

25|$|Like other trans people, <b>transsexual</b> {{people may}} refer to {{themselves}} as trans men or trans women. <b>Transsexual</b> people desire to establish a permanent gender role {{as a member of}} the gender with which they identify, and many <b>transsexual</b> people pursue medical interventions as part of the process of expressing their gender.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: Transsexualism {{occurs with}} an {{estimated}} prevalence of 2. 4 : 100, 000 male-to-female (MTF) and 1 : 100, 000 female-to-male (FTM) <b>transsexuals.</b> As sex reassignment surgery involves surgery of the urethra and <b>transsexuals</b> are substituted life-long with the cross gender hormones there could possibly arise micturition disorders. Aim {{of the study was}} to determine if <b>transsexuals</b> have an increased risk of micturition disorders and if so which. STUDY DESIGN: Between January and July 2003 we examined 25 <b>transsexuals</b> whereof 18 were MTF and 7 were FTM <b>transsexuals</b> using King's Health Questionnaire, visual analogue scale for patient's well being, perineal and transabdominal ultrasound, urine dipstick and uroflow measurement. RESULTS: 17 out of 25 patients considered themselves very happy. In MTF <b>transsexuals,</b> a diverted stream, overactive bladder and stress urinary incontinence was a common problem. Prostate volume was small with 20 g and palpation did not confirm and solid or suspicious lesions. None of the patients had significant residual urine but MTF <b>transsexuals</b> had a reduced urinary flow. We could not detect a current urinary tract infections in any of the patients. CONCLUSION: <b>Transsexuals</b> have an increased risk for the development of micturition disorders including stress urinary incontinence and overactive bladder compared to age-matched control groups and should be counselled preoperatively. Reasons for the development of incontinence might be surgery including pudendal nerve damage, hormonal reasons and ageing...|$|R
40|$|Ó The Author(s) 2011. This {{article is}} {{published}} with open access at Springerlink. com Two independent empirical articles have recently {{appeared in the}} literature that, taken together, bear out an hypothesis Blanchard (2008) postulated in the Archives about brain development in transsexualism: [T]he brains of both homosexual and heterosexual maleto-female <b>transsexuals</b> probably differ from the brains of typical heterosexual men, but in different ways. In homosexual male-to-female <b>transsexuals,</b> the difference does involve sex-dimorphic structures, {{and the nature of}} the difference is a shift in the female-typical direction. If there is any neuroanatomic intersexuality, it is in the homosexual group. In heterosexual male-to-female <b>transsexuals,</b> the difference may not involve sex-dimorphic structures at all, {{and the nature of the}} structural difference is not necessarily along the male–female dimension. (p. 437) Blanchard’s prediction follows from studies that have repeatedly shown that the homosexual male-to-female <b>transsexuals</b> are‘‘female-shifted’’in multiple, sexually dimorphic characteristics, whereas the heterosexual male-to-female <b>transsexuals</b> are not (Blanchard, 1989 a, 1989 b). For example,homosexual maleto-female <b>transsexuals</b> are sexually attracted to natal males, express greater interest in female-typical activities (even in childhood), and are naturally effeminate in mannerism. In contrast, heterosexual male-to-female <b>transsexuals</b> are indistinguishable from nontranssexual natal males on these variables. The heterosexual <b>transsexuals</b> are still distinct from typical males in other ways, however, such as by manifesting ‘‘autogynephilia’’—the erotic interest in or sexual arousal in response to being or seeming female. The consistent detection of cross-sex features amon...|$|R

25|$|Around {{the same}} time as Benjamin's book, in 1965, the term {{transgender}} was coined by John Oliven. By the 1990s, <b>transsexual</b> had come to be considered a subset of the umbrella term transgender. The term transgender is now more common, and many transgender people prefer the designation transgender and reject <b>transsexual.</b> The term <b>transsexual,</b> however, continues to be used, and some people who pursue medical assistance (for example, sex reassignment surgery) to change their sexual characteristics to match their gender identity prefer the designation <b>transsexual</b> and reject transgender. One perspective offered by <b>transsexual</b> people who reject a transgender label for that of transsexed is that, for people who have gone through sexual reassignment surgery, their anatomical sex has been altered, whilst their gender remains constant.|$|E
25|$|Some <b>transsexual</b> {{people live}} {{heterosexual}} lifestyles (see heteronormative), while some identify as gay, lesbian, or bisexual.

5000|$|Brain-based {{research}} has repeatedly shown that female-to-male <b>transsexuals</b> have several male-like characteristics in neuroanatomy. In 2010, {{a team of}} neuroscientists compared 18 female-to-male <b>transsexuals</b> with 24 male and 19 female gynephilic controls, using an MRI technique called diffusion tensor imaging or DTI. [...] DTI is a specialized technique for visualizing white matter of the brain, and white matter structure {{is one of the}} differences in neuroanatomy between men and women. The study found that the white matter pattern in female-to-male <b>transsexuals</b> was shifted in the direction of biological males, even before the female-to-male <b>transsexuals</b> started taking male hormones (which can also modify brain structure).|$|R
50|$|In another study, Rametti {{and colleagues}} used {{diffusion}} tensor imaging (DTI) to compare 18 androphilic male-to-female <b>transsexuals</b> with 19 gynephilic males and 19 androphilic cisgender females.

40|$|Abstract: On {{the basis}} of both Geschwind andBehan's (1984) theory—that {{at least part of}} the genesis of left-handedness can be {{ascribed}} to overexposure to testosterone during fetal development—andDorner's (1980;Dorneretal., 1991) theory—that transsexuality emerges from prenatal over- or underexposure to androgens infemale-to-male (FTM) andmale-to-female (MTF) <b>transsexuals,</b> respectively—it was predicted that thefrequency of left-handedness in FTM <b>transsexuals</b> would be higher than in the general population. In MTF <b>transsexuals,</b> by contrast, thefrequency of left-handedness was expected to be lower or the same as in the general population. Results showed that the prevalence of lefthandedness in both FTM and MTF <b>transsexuals</b> is nearly two times higher than in the general population. The generally higher prevalence of left-handedness among <b>transsexuals,</b> combined with the absence of the predicted sex difference, indicates that either Dorner's theory on the etiology of transsexuality or Geschwind's model of the genesis of left-handedness, or both, need to be revised...|$|R
