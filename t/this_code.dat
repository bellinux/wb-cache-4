5|$|The {{images of}} Uttararama follow a {{different}} style from {{the images of the}} previous Anuradhapura period, and show some significant differences. The identity of the standing image is subject to a certain amount of dispute among historians and archaeologists, some of whom argue that it depicts the monk Ananda rather than the Buddha. Each of the images have been carved in a way that uses a maximum possible area of the rock, and their heights seem to have been decided based on the height of the rock itself. Each statue appears to have had its own image house, as indicated by the remains of brick walls at the site. The Uttararama was where Parakramabahu I held a congregation of monks to purify the Buddhist priesthood, and later drew up a code of conduct for them. <b>This</b> <b>code</b> of conduct has been recorded in an inscription on the same rock face containing the images of the Buddha.|$|E
5|$|From {{the time}} of the ancient world, at least, plants have been {{classified}} in two ways. On the one hand there is the detached academic, philosophical or scientific interest in plants themselves: this groups plants by their relationship to one another according to their similarities and differences in structure and function. Then there is the practical, utilitarian or anthropocentric interest which groups plants according to their human use. Cultivated plant taxonomy is concerned with the special classification categories needed for the plants of agriculture, horticulture and forestry as regulated by the Cultivated Plant Code. <b>This</b> <b>Code</b> serves not only the scientific interests of formal nomenclature, it also caters for the special utilitarian needs of people dealing with the plants of commerce. Those cultigens given names governed by the Cultivated Plant Code fulfill three criteria: they have special features considered of sufficient importance to warrant a name; the special features are the result of deliberate human breeding or selection and are not found in wild populations (except in rare cases where the special features represent desirable part of natural variation found in wild populations that is not covered by a scientific name); it is possible to perpetuate the desirable features by propagation in cultivation.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, {{we propose}} {{the use of}} the {{multi-frame}} Gaussian mixture model-based block quantizer for the coding of Mel frequencywarped cepstral coefficient (MFCC) features in distributed speech recognition (DSR) applications. <b>This</b> <b>coding</b> scheme exploits intraframe correlation via the Karhunen-Lo eve transform (KLT) and interframe correlation via the joint processing of adjacent frames together with the computational simplicity of scalar quantization. The proposed coder is bit-rate scalable, which means that the bitrate can be adjusted without the need for re-training of the quantizers. Static parameters such as the probability density function (PDF) model and KLT orthogonal matrices are stored at the encoder and decoder and bit allocations are calculated `on-the-fly' without intensive processing. <b>This</b> <b>coding</b> scheme is evaluated in this paper on the Aurora- 2 database in a DSR framework. It is shown that <b>this</b> <b>coding</b> scheme achieves high recognition performance at lower bitrates, with a word error rate (WER) of 2. 5 % at 800 bps, which is less than 1 % degradation from the baseline word recognition accuracy, and graceful degradation down to a WER of 7 % at 300 bps...|$|R

5|$|The {{objective}} of Apollo11 was to land safely {{rather than to}} touch down with precision on a particular spot. Three minutes into the lunar descent burn, Armstrong noted that craters were passing about two seconds too early, which meant the Eagle would probably touch down beyond the planned landing zone by several miles. As the Eagles landing radar acquired the surface, several computer error alarms appeared. The first was a code 1202 alarm, and even with their extensive training, neither Armstrong nor Aldrin was aware of what <b>this</b> <b>code</b> meant. They promptly received word from CAPCOM Charles Duke in Houston that the alarms were not a concern; the 1202 and 1201 alarms were caused by an executive overflow in the lunar module computer. As described by Buzz Aldrin in the documentary In the Shadow of the Moon, the overflow condition was caused by his own counter-checklist choice of leaving the docking radar on during the landing process, so the computer had to process unnecessary radar data {{and did not have}} enough time to execute all tasks, dropping lower-priority ones. Aldrin stated that he did so with the {{objective of}} facilitating re-docking with the CM should an abort become necessary, not realizing that it would cause the overflow condition.|$|E
