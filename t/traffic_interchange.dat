5|$|The South Mountain Freeway, {{presently}} under construction, is a southerly bypass of Downtown Phoenix {{which will}} {{run along the}} southern edge of the Ahwatukee neighborhood of Phoenix and pass just to the south and west of South Mountain Park. It begins at the already complete <b>traffic</b> <b>interchange</b> of the Santan Freeway and Interstate 10. Heading west along the Pecos Road alignment through Ahwatukee, the freeway straddles the border with the Gila River Indian Reservation. Turning northwest and eventually north, the freeway will follow the 59th and 55th Avenue alignments north to its terminus with Interstate 10 in west Phoenix.|$|E
25|$|The airport's {{master plan}} calls for a fourth (third parallel) runway to be built {{southeast}} of I-70 sometime in the future. Between 2002 and 2004 the Indiana Department of Transportation (INDOT) rebuilt a portion of this Interstate highway running through {{the south end of}} the airport's property. The realigned freeway allows a future taxiway bridge to the proposed fourth runway to cross overhead and has a new <b>traffic</b> <b>interchange</b> for the midfield terminal complex. This I-70 exit (#68) is now the airport's main entrance, replacing the entrance at Sam Jones Expressway (which was built as the Airport Expressway) and High School Road. Provision has been made for future Light Rail Transit (LRT) access to the Weir Cook terminal complex.|$|E

40|$|The paper {{considers}} {{urban road}} network in combination with elements of transport infrastructure which are presented as noise sources. Acoustic analysis {{of the level of}} noise produced by transport accounts only railway track spans and highways as linear sources of noise. Within the study road network elements and objects of transport infrastructure were classified; <b>traffic</b> <b>interchanges</b> and objects of transport infrastructure were presented as spatial noise source, which provides relevance of this study. The purpose of the research is development of methods for analyzing noise parameters of road networks and objects of transport infrastructure, as well as analysis of noise level in the residential territories caused by the combination of linear and spatial noise sources. The results of analysis and measurements demonstrate that evaluation of noise level caused by transport of the near-highway territory without the account of <b>traffic</b> <b>interchanges</b> as spatial noise sources leads to downward bias of noise level up to 10 dBA...|$|R

Guilford serves few customers in Brunswick. East of Brunswick, the state recently refurbished the Rockland Branch to FRA Class 3 standards. The Maine Eastern Railroad was recently named {{to operate the}} railway with seasonal passenger excursions and limited freight <b>traffic</b> <b>interchanging</b> with Guilford in Brunswick.|$|R

Multi-decked bridges over the Allegheny and Monongahela were attached to the central building. Pedestrians, cars, and trucks would cross on separate decks. Both bridges passed beneath the central structure, where <b>traffic</b> <b>interchanges</b> allowed travelers to head into the city, across either of the bridges, or up into the Civic Center itself. Open spaces on the site were occupied by parks, an outdoor concert area built to accommodate 15,000 people, and a zoo.|$|R
