40|$|Most {{distributed}} {{object-oriented programming}} languages typically support a medium-grain parallel programming style for a virtual machine {{composed of a}} network of workstations. While the application of conventional compiler optimizations make the <b>threads</b> <b>of</b> computation efficient, it is the support for interactions between the <b>threads</b> <b>of</b> computation across the processors that promises significant impact over the performance of distributed programs. Interactions between the <b>threads</b> <b>of</b> computations are best supported by explicit programming abstractions. We present a distributed object-oriented programming language called Pragati, and its support for interaction paradigms in multi-threaded computations via a number of examples. We observe that the programming abstractions of Pragati help capture a wide range of interaction behaviour between the <b>threads</b> <b>of</b> distributed application...|$|R

5|$|Long {{before the}} first incarcerees arrived in March 1942, Manzanar was home to Native Americans, who lived mostly in villages near several creeks in the area.

5|$|Sericulture, the rearing of silkworms, {{was first}} {{adopted by the}} Chinese during the Shang dynasty. The only species farmed commercially is the domesticated silkmoth. When it spins its cocoon, each larva {{produces}} an exceedingly long, slender <b>thread</b> <b>of</b> silk. The larvae feed on mulberry leaves and in Europe, only one generation is normally raised each year as this is a deciduous tree. In China, Korea and Japan however, two generations are normal, and in the tropics, multiple generations are expected. Most production of silk occurs in the Far East, with a synthetic diet being used to rear the silkworms in Japan.|$|E
5|$|In 1912, Brinkley {{left his}} family to try to regain the <b>thread</b> <b>of</b> his education, this time in St. Louis, Missouri. He was unable to pay Bennett Medical College the tuition he owed them, so they refused to forward his {{scholastic}} records {{to any of the}} medical schools that Brinkley had approached. Instead, Brinkley bought a certificate from a shady diploma mill known as the Kansas City Eclectic Medical University and returned home. On February 11, 1913, his daughter Naomi Beryl Brinkley was born. The family of five immediately moved to New York City, and shortly thereafter to Chicago. When Brinkley refused to give up his goal of becoming a doctor, Sally Brinkley left him one final time, taking the three girls home to North Carolina.|$|E
5000|$|A {{downside}} of SIMT execution {{is the fact}} that thread-specific control-flow is performed using [...] "masking", leading to poor utilization where a processor's threads follow different control-flow paths. For instance, to handle an IF-ELSE block where various <b>threads</b> <b>of</b> a processor execute different paths, all threads must actually process both paths (as all <b>threads</b> <b>of</b> a processor always execute in lock-step), but masking is used to disable and enable the various threads as appropriate. Masking is avoided when control flow is coherent for the <b>threads</b> <b>of</b> a processor, i.e. they all follow the same path of execution. The masking strategy is what distinguishes SIMT from ordinary SIMD, and has the benefit of inexpensive synchronization between the <b>threads</b> <b>of</b> a processor.|$|R

5|$|A final {{reason for}} the Second Settlement was to give the Principate {{constitutional}} stability and staying power in case something happened to Princeps Augustus. His illness of early 23 BC and the Caepio conspiracy showed that the regime's existence hung by the thin <b>thread</b> <b>of</b> the life of one man, Augustus himself, who suffered from several severe and dangerous illnesses throughout his life. If he were to die from natural causes or fall victim to assassination, Rome could be subjected to another round of civil war. The memories of Pharsalus, the Ides of March, the proscriptions, Philippi, and Actium, barely twenty-five years distant, were still vivid {{in the minds of}} many citizens. Proconsular imperium was conferred upon Agrippa for five years, similar to Augustus' power, in order to accomplish this constitutional stability. The exact nature of the grant is uncertain but it probably covered Augustus' imperial provinces, east and west, perhaps lacking authority over the provinces of the Senate. That came later, as did the jealously guarded tribunicia potestas.|$|E

5|$|By {{the time}} the strip ended in March 1995 Melchester were in dire straits, {{on the verge of}} bankruptcy, and their {{long-term}} future far from certain. When the strip returned in Match of the Day magazine in May 1997, much of the monthly comic's new continuity was ignored, although the basic <b>thread</b> <b>of</b> the club having struggled against relegation and being severely in debt was continued. It was revealed in the first strip that in the intervening years, while Rovers had managed to survive the threat of bankruptcy, a bribery scandal had caused a mass exodus of players and eventual relegation to Division One. Rocky, meanwhile, was playing for fierce local rivals Melborough, after a bitter falling-out with his father over a car accident in Italy in which his mother, Penny, had been killed. Roy, who had quit football as a result, was blamed by some (including his son) for the accident, even though he had no memory of it, and the precise circumstances surrounding the event were never resolved.|$|E
5|$|Later {{that year}} Czarniecki {{received}} territories from the king, {{along with the}} office of Crown oboźny. In 1653 he led a unit to Ukraine, ransacking much of the Cossack-held lands, although the attrition among the troops was high. During that campaign Czarniecki was wounded at Monastyryska. He continued his suppression campaign in 1654, and the following January took part in the battle of Okhmativ. In May 1655 he was called from Ukraine to Warsaw, as the king John Casimir Vasa, respected his experience and requested his presence at a new war council, convened to discuss the looming <b>thread</b> <b>of</b> the war with Sweden. At that time his reputation was significant; Sejm often passed resolutions applauding him for his efforts to reclaim Ukraine, and he was even held in much consideration by the Ottomans, then temporarily allied with the Commonwealth. On 14 May 1655 he received the office of the castellan of Kiev, a position that made him a member of the Senate of Poland.|$|E

The funiculus of Crucibulum species is markedly different from those of Cyathus species: in Crucibulum, the purse is a rounded knob 0.3–0.5mm wide, attached to the underside of the peridiole. Attaching the purse directly to the wall of the peridium is a stout yellow-grey cord 0.1mm wide and about 2.5mm long.|$|E

5|$|The fruiting bodies, or perida, are funnel- or barrel-shaped, 6–15mm tall, 4–8mm wide at the mouth, {{sometimes}} short-stalked, {{golden brown}} to blackish brown in age. The outside {{wall of the}} peridium, the ectoperidium, is covered with tufts of fungal hyphae that resembles shaggy, untidy hair. However, in older specimens this outer layer of hair (technically a tomentum) may be completely worn off. The internal wall of the cup, the endoperidium, is smooth and grey to bluish-black. The 'eggs' of the bird's nest – the peridioles – are blackish, 1–2mm in diameter, and there are typically about 20 in the cup. Peridioles are often attached to the fruiting body by a funiculus, a structure of hyphae that is differentiated into three regions: the basal piece, which attaches it to the inner wall of the peridium, the middle piece, and an upper sheath, called the purse, connected to the lower surface of the peridiole. In the purse and middle piece is a coiled <b>thread</b> <b>of</b> interwoven hyphae called the funicular cord, attached at {{one end to the}} peridiole and at the other end to an entangled mass of hyphae called the hapteron. However, Brodie reports that sometimes C.stercoreus is found without a funiculus, which has led some authors to misidentify this species with the genus Nidula.|$|E
5|$|The peridioles {{are about}} 1 to 1.5mm wide and rarely up to 2mm wide. They are disc-shaped, but may appear angular due to {{pressure}} from neighbouring peridioles.

The funiculus is differentiated into three regions: the basal piece, which attaches it to the inner wall of the peridium, the middle piece, and an upper sheath, called the purse, connected to the lower surface of the peridiole. Inside the purse and middle piece is a coiled <b>thread</b> <b>of</b> interwoven hyphae called the funicular cord, attached at {{one end to the}} peridiole and at the other end to an entangled mass of hyphae called the hapteron.
