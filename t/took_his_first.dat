5|$|Akshaya Tritya is {{considered}} holy and supremely auspicious by Jains. It {{is believed that}} Rishabhanatha <b>took</b> <b>his</b> <b>first</b> ahara (alms) after becoming an ascetic on this day. Rishabhanatha, Jains believe, was the first monk of the present half cycle of time (avasarpini). Therefore, people {{did not know how}} to offer food (ahara) to monks. King Shreyansa of Hastinapur offered sugarcane juice (ikshu-rasa) to Rishabhanatha. Jains attach great importance to this day as it was only after one year that Rishabhanatha was offered food. The day is celebrated in the Jain tradition on the third day of the bright fortnight of the month Vaishaka (usually April).|$|E
