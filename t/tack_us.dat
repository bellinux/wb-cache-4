6000|$|There was {{no reply}} to {{this for a}} moment, and then I was asked--"To <b>tack,</b> and give <b>us</b> a little chance, by drawing him away for a few minutes. We are armed, and will come out to your assistance." ...|$|R
60|$|I came on deck to {{find the}} Ghost heading up close on the port tack and cutting in to {{windward}} of a familiar spritsail close-hauled on the same <b>tack</b> ahead of <b>us.</b> All hands were on deck, for they knew that something was to happen when Leach and Johnson were dragged aboard.|$|R
5000|$|In 1985, [...] "Hot Water" [...] {{and another}} True Colours song, [...] "The Chant Has Begun", were <b>tacked</b> onto the <b>US</b> version of Level 42's {{breakthrough}} album, World Machine, {{in place of}} [...] "I Sleep on My Heart," [...] "Dream Crazy" [...] (which only appeared on the European CD version of the album), and [...] "Coup D'Etat." [...] "Hot Water" [...] was released as the US follow-up single to the World Machine breakthrough single, [...] "Something About You" [...] in 1986; it peaked at #87.|$|R
50|$|<b>Tack</b> strip (<b>US)</b> (also {{known as}} gripper rod (UK), carpet gripper, Smoothedge (Can), tackless strip, and gripper edge) {{is a thin}} piece of wood, between 1 to 2 m long and about 3 cm wide, studded with {{hundreds}} of sharp nails or tacks used in the installation of carpet. They are nailed, tack side up, to {{the perimeter of the}} area being carpeted. After the underlay is installed, the carpet is cut to fit, stretched over the area and firmly anchored to the edges of floor via the tack strips. The strip has two functions: first, the tacks grip the carpet and permanently hold it in place and second, the carpet edge is jammed into the gap between the tack strip and the wall which gives it a finished look with little effort. This method allows a high quality, long lasting installation to be completed quickly and easily.|$|R
6000|$|The {{ship was}} off Bedlow's, {{and the pilot}} had begun to shorten sail, when a {{schooner}} crossed our fore-foot, beating down. I had been too much occupied with the general movement of the bay, to notice one small craft; but, this vessel happening to <b>tack</b> quite near <b>us,</b> I could not but turn my eyes in her direction. At that instant I heard a shout from Neb, who was furling one of the royals. It {{was one of those}} irrepressible [...] "nigger gollies" [...] that often escaped from the fellow involuntarily.|$|R
60|$|When {{we reached}} the great bend just above Middlesex, where the river runs east thirty-five miles to the sea, we at length lost the aid of this propitious wind, though we {{contrived}} to make one long and judicious <b>tack</b> carry <b>us</b> nearly to the locks of the canal. We were here locked through at noon by our old friend, the lover of the higher mathematics, who seemed glad to see us safe back again through so many locks; {{but we did not}} stop to consider any of his problems, though we could cheerfully have spent a whole autumn in this way another time, and never have asked what his religion was. It is so rare to meet with a man out-doors who cherishes a worthy thought in his mind, which is independent of the labor of his hands. Behind every man's busy-ness there should be a level of undisturbed serenity and industry, as within the reef encircling a coral isle there is always an expanse of still water, where the depositions are going on which will finally raise it above the surface.|$|R
6000|$|... "She sails in this {{squadron}} of Recalde. The Armada was minded to smoke {{us out of}} Plymouth; and God's grace it was they tried not: but their orders from home are too strait, and so the slaves fight like a bull in a tether, no farther than their rope, finding thus the devil a hard master, as do most in the end. They cannot compass our quick handling and <b>tacking,</b> and take <b>us</b> for very witches. So far so good, and better to come. You and I know the length of their foot of old. Time and light will kill any hare, and they will find it {{a long way from}} Start to Dunkirk." ...|$|R
6000|$|I say [...] "soused": for I {{confess that}} the shock belied {{the promise of}} our easy descent. The Lunardi floated: but it also drove before the wind. And as it dragged the car after it like a tilted pail, the four drenched and blinded aëronauts {{struggled}} through the spray and gripped the hoop, the netting--nay, dug their nails into the oiled silk. In its new element the machine became inspired with a sudden infernal malice. It sank like a pillow if we tried to climb it: it rolled us over in the brine; it allowed us no moment for a backward glance. I spied a small cutter-rigged craft <b>tacking</b> towards <b>us,</b> a mile and more to leeward, and wondered if {{the captain of the}} brig had left our rescue to it. He had not. I heard a shout behind us; a rattle of oars as the bowmen shipped them; and a hand gripped my collar. So one by one we were plucked--uncommon specimens!--from the deep; rescued from what Mr. Sheepshanks a minute later, as he sat on a thwart and wiped his spectacles, justly termed [...] "a predicament, sir, as disconcerting as any my experience supplies." ...|$|R
40|$|Citizen {{response}} to adverse or potentially adverse situations {{has been a}} growing phenomenon since the 1970 ’s (Boyte, 1980; Henig, 1982). Issues regarding these situations may include consumerism, anti-crime, riot mitigation, the environment, and natural or man-caused disasters. In order to accomplish various tasks in regard to these various issues, grass roots social movement organizations (SMO’s) are often mobilized by concerned citizens. Using data from a nationwide study {{we look at the}} relationship between one type of SMO, an emergent citizen group (ECG) in a disaster –related situation, and selected key local organizations. In this analysis, a collective behavior and organizational approach are combined. This <b>tack</b> allows <b>us</b> to analyze the ECG as it develop within its organizational set (see Evan, 1976), and even analyze the emergence of an organizational set (see Ross, 1980). Using the ECG as our focal organization we look at the dominant direction of the flow of information between it and the key organizations as a fundamental factor of influence within the issue-organization set. The consequences of the ECG’s legitimacy and successes are then discussed in light of the patterns of relations or characteristics with {{the other members of the}} organizational set.

60|$|When we {{had been}} sailing for an hour, Good, who was searching the horizon with the spy-glass, {{suddenly}} announced joyfully that he saw land, and pointed out that, from {{the change in the}} colour of the water, he thought we must be approaching the mouth of a river. In another minute we perceived a great golden dome, not unlike that of St Paul's, piercing the morning mists, and while we were wondering what in the world it could be, Good reported another and still more important discovery, namely, that a small sailing-boat was advancing towards us. This bit of news, which we were very shortly able to verify with our own eyes, threw us into a considerable flutter. That the natives of this unknown lake should understand the art of sailing seemed to suggest that they possessed some degree of civilization. In a few more minutes it became evident that the occupant or occupants of the advancing boat had made us out. For a moment or two she hung in the wind as though in doubt, and then came <b>tacking</b> towards <b>us</b> with great swiftness. In ten more minutes she was within a hundred yards, and we saw that she was a neat little boat -- not a canoe 'dug out', but built more or less in the European fashion with planks, and carrying a singularly large sail for her size. But our attention was soon diverted from the boat to her crew, which consisted {{of a man and a}} woman, nearly as white as ourselves.|$|R
