40|$|Physiological {{responses}} of the labrid fish Notolabrus celidotus to temperature change, found <b>thermal</b> <b>compensation</b> to be more advanced in cold environmental temperatures compared to warm environmental temperatures. N. celidotus was acclimated for 28 days to 8, 14 and 24 ºC and metabolism, ventilatory and circulatory function, condition factor, swimming ability, thermal tolerance and hypoxia tolerance investigated. N. celidotus acclimated to 8 ºC almost achieved full <b>thermal</b> <b>compensation,</b> which resulted in, resting and maximum oxygen consumption not being significantly different to 14 ºC acclimated fish. In contrast, N. celidotus acclimated to 24 ºC achieved only partial or no metabolic <b>thermal</b> <b>compensation.</b> This resulted in high resting oxygen consumption and a reduced aerobic scope for activity, which had detrimental affects on other physiological parameters investigated. <b>Thermal</b> <b>compensation</b> was achieved for the resting ventilation rate of the 8 ºC acclimated fish, which is most likely {{needed in order to}} meet the high oxygen demands incurred by metabolic <b>thermal</b> <b>compensation.</b> No <b>thermal</b> <b>compensation</b> was achieved for any other ventilation rate or for heart rate, at any acclimation temperature. <b>Thermal</b> <b>compensation</b> at the level of heart and ventilation rate of the 24 ºC acclimated fish, would have been limited by the lack of metabolic <b>thermal</b> <b>compensation.</b> A low condition factor of the 24 ºC acclimated fish would also have occurred due to the lack of metabolic <b>thermal</b> <b>compensation,</b> which would have caused high-energy demands and the utilization of energy stores. Thermal tolerance ranges shifted in the direction of temperature change for all acclimation groups, which indicates <b>thermal</b> <b>compensation</b> must have occurred to some degree at a variety of organizational levels. Swimming ability reflected metabolic <b>thermal</b> <b>compensation,</b> with the swimming ability of the 8 ºC acclimated fish being similar to the 14 ºC acclimated fish. In comparison, the 24 ºC acclimated fish had a diminished swimming ability, which is likely to have occurred due to the reduced aerobic scope for activity of these fish and the low condition factor. The findings suggest that the increasing temperatures associated with climate change will cause N. celidotus to migrate to cooler waters in order to survive. This response will have a large effect on New Zealand’s marine ecosystem as N. celidotus is abundant in New Zealand waters and is an important part of the food chain. Additionally, the response of N. celidotus may be an indicator of the response of other New Zealand species to climate change, which could cause huge upset to New Zealand commercial fisheries...|$|R

40|$|Temperature plays a {{critical}} role in determining the biology of ectotherms. Many animals have evolved mechanisms that allow them to compensate biological rates, i. e. adjust biological rates to overcome thermodynamic effects. For low energy-organisms, such as bivalves, the costs of <b>thermal</b> <b>compensation</b> may be greater than the benefits, and thus prohibitive. To examine this, two experiments were designed to explore <b>thermal</b> <b>compensation</b> in Unio tumidus. Experiment 1 examined seasonal changes in behaviour in U. tumidus throughout a year. Temperature had a clear effect on burrowing rate with no evidence of compensation. Valve closure duration and frequency were also strongly affected by seasonal temperature change, but there was slight evidence of partial compensation. Experiment 2 examined oxygen consumption during burrowing, immediately following valve opening and at rest in summer (24 °C), autumn (14 °C), winter (4 °C), and spring (14 °C) acclimatized U. tumidus. Again, there was little evidence of burrowing rate compensation, but some evidence of partial compensation of valve closure duration and frequency. None of the oxygen compensation rates showed any evidence of <b>thermal</b> <b>compensation.</b> Thus, in general, there was only very limited evidence of <b>thermal</b> <b>compensation</b> of behaviour and no evidence of <b>thermal</b> <b>compensation</b> of oxygen compensation rates. Based upon this evidence, we argue that there is no evolutionary pressure for these bivalves to compensate these biological rates. Any pressure may be to maintain or even lower oxygen consumption as their only defence against predation is to close their valves and wait. An increase in oxygen consumption will be detrimental in this regard so the cost of <b>thermal</b> <b>compensation</b> may outweigh the benefits...|$|R

They have broad application in precision mechanical devices and Micro-Electro Mechanical Systems (MEMS) but may lose accuracy and produce undesirable displacements when subjected to temperature changes. These undesirable effects can be reduced by using sensors in combination with control techniques and/or by applying special design techniques to reduce such undesirable effects at the design stage, a process generally termed ""design for precision"".

The performance of thermal error prediction mainly depends on the accuracy and robustness of predictive model and the input temperature variables. Selection of temperature-sensitive measuring points is the premise of <b>thermal</b> error <b>compensation.</b> In the <b>thermal</b> error <b>compensation</b> scheme for heavy-duty computer numerical control (CNC) machine tools, the identification of temperature-sensitive points still lacks an effective method due to its complex structure and heat generation mechanisms. In this paper, an optimal selection method of temperature-sensitive measuring points has been proposed. The optimal measuring points are acquired through three steps. First, the degree of temperature sensitivity is defined and used to select the measuring points with high sensitivity to thermal error. Then, the first selected points are classified with fuzzy clustering and grey correlation grade. Finally, the temperature-sensitive measuring points are selected with analysis of location of temperature sensors.
