40|$|This paper {{presents}} a new digital-ticket circulating scheme and trust management scheme for a digital ticket. A digital ticket is a digital medium that guarantees certain {{rights of the}} owner and it includes software licenses, resource access tickets, event tickets, and plane <b>tickets.</b> <b>The</b> circulation of digital tickets comprises three types of principal transactions: issuance, transfer, and redemption. Depending on the application, various conditions must be satisfied to execute these transactions, e. g., only qualified shops can issue <b>the</b> <b>tickets</b> and only a certain agent can <b>transfer</b> <b>the</b> <b>tickets.</b> This paper introduces circulation control tickets, which are required to issue, transfer, redeem a ticket, and proposes specifying <b>the</b> required control <b>ticket</b> types in <b>the</b> <b>ticket</b> to be circulated itself using <b>the</b> Generalized <b>Ticket</b> Definition Language. <b>The</b> <b>ticket</b> circulating system issues, transfers, or redeems a <b>ticket</b> only if <b>the</b> control <b>tickets</b> are owned by the participants of the transacti [...] ...|$|R

The show was free but open only to those who had tickets to RE~TG, whether they had obtained a refund or <b>transferred</b> <b>the</b> <b>ticket</b> to a later concert at All Tomorrow's Parties, in December 2004.

40|$|AbstractThis work is {{integrated}} in <b>the</b> SmartCITIES Cloud <b>Ticketing</b> project from Link Consulting SA, aiming at proposing a multi-tenancy {{implementation of a}} <b>ticketing</b> system on <b>the</b> Amazon cloud platform. The SmartCITIES project introduced the “thin device” concept, which allows <b>transferring</b> <b>the</b> traditional <b>ticketing</b> operations to a cloud platform, increasing elasticity and providing interoperability. This approach raises several concerns, namely security issues and latency in communications. A gate in a public transportation device has to check ticket validity in less than 300 ms. With this in mind, we propose a Cloud Ticketing Communication Testing Platform (SmartSales), developed to benchmark <b>the</b> normal <b>ticketing</b> operations (e. g., sale, recharge and validation), while providing insights on the latency, according to several levels of security, available network and Cloud topology. Several metrics associated with the round-trip time (RTT) of communications made by the prototype were collected to explore possible situations where the “thin device” concept can be used. The acquired results point towards the possible migration of most e-ticketing systems with <b>the</b> SmartCITIES Cloud <b>Ticketing</b> project architecture to the Cloud...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a new electronic commerce scheme that provides consumers with a one stop check-out {{service for the}} purchase of a set of items from multiple autonomous shops. In this scheme, a consumer collects a transaction ticket, a specific form of digital-right, from each shop for each purchase representing the right to said purchase, and <b>transfers</b> <b>the</b> collected <b>tickets</b> to a check-out agent when the customer finally decides to complete all purchases selected. This approach allows for the autonomy of inventory/reservation databases in each shop without requiring them to provide transaction control interfaces, e. g., prepare, commit, and rollback, which are traditionally required to avoid the situation in which an item put into a shopping cart not exist at the check-out phase. It also enables the redemption of digital coupons or gift certificates together with transaction <b>tickets</b> at <b>the</b> same time in a uniform manner. 1.

5000|$|In 2009, TicketMaster started {{adoption}} of a [...] "paperless" [...] restricted ticketing, in which tickets could not be resold. Under this system, customers prove their purchase by showing a credit card and ID. The measure was taken in response to ticket scalping and resale markup of tickets on secondary markets and adopted during Miley Cyrus (2009) World Wonder Tour, although Ticketmaster first experimented it with AC/DC's Black Ice World Tour (2008-10). TicketMaster has since changed {{the name of the}} system to [...] "Credit Card Entry". The system requires large groups to enter together with the person who purchased tickets. Some events have <b>Ticket</b> <b>Transfer</b> which allows <b>the</b> <b>tickets</b> to change ownership and allow for tickets to be transferred through Ticketmaster's proprietary systems. These cannot be later resold or transferred via other companies systems such as StubHub.|$|R
50|$|Free <b>transfers</b> between <b>the</b> two {{stations}} were available on Mondays to Fridays from December 18, 1967, until 1968, by providing paper tickets to passengers, who would exit one station {{and follow the}} sidewalk in order to enter the other. The tunnel now permits leaving a train in one station and walking underground to one in the other, and takes away <b>the</b> need for <b>transfer</b> <b>tickets.</b> <b>The</b> entire station complex was fully renovated in 1998. There are three elevators to street level - one each located on the southwestern and northwestern corners of Sixth Avenue and 42nd Street, {{and one on the}} western side of Sixth Avenue between 39th and 40th Streets - but there are no elevators to either platform level, so the station complex is not fully ADA-accessible.|$|R
25|$|On April 4, 2016, Translink's new fare gates were {{implemented}} for ridership on SkyTrain and SeaBus. To open the fare gates, to enter or exit the system, a Compass Card must be used.

Neither FareSavers nor <b>the</b> <b>transfer</b> <b>tickets</b> {{may be used to}} open fare gates. Compass Cards work on all transit services using a tap in method to pay fares. Tap out however is not required on buses. The cards may be loaded with monthly passes, day passes, or stored value, or any combination, with the ability to auto-load the fare choice. Annual passes have been eliminated.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. We {{describe}} a new network service, the “ticket server”. This service provides “tickets ” that a client can attach {{to a request}} for a network service (such as sending email or asking for a stock quote). The recipient of such a request (such as the email recipient or the stockbroker) can use the ticker server to verify that <b>the</b> <b>ticket</b> is valid and that <b>the</b> <b>ticket</b> hasn’t been used before. Clients can acquire tickets ahead of time, independently of the particular network service request. Clients can maintain their stock of tickets either on their own storage, or as a balance recorded by <b>the</b> <b>ticket</b> server. Recipients of a request can tell <b>the</b> <b>ticket</b> server to refund <b>the</b> attached <b>ticket</b> to <b>the</b> original client, thus incrementing the client’s balance at <b>the</b> <b>ticket</b> server. For example, an email recipient might do this if the email wasn’t spam.
