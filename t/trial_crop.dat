Long-term trials like the DOK-trial offer unique opportunities for this kind of research. The DOK-trial compares the three systems mentioned above on the basis of the same intensity of organic fertilization (i. e. the same number of animals per area), the same crop rotation and the same soil tillage.

We deduced the following specifications: (1) to take into account the very short period after harvest in which analyses have to be returned, the tool has to perform automated identification and quantification of environmental constraints in each <b>trial</b> (<b>crop</b> diagnosis) and automated analysis of genotype by environment interaction.

40|$|Background:  Salvage {{therapeutic}} {{options for}} biochemical failure after primary radiation-based therapy include radical prostatectomy, cryoablation, high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU), brachytherapy (for post-EBRT patients) and androgen deprivation therapy (ADT). ADT and salvage prostate cryoablation (SPC) are two commonly considered treatment options for RRPC. However, {{there is an}} urgent need for high-quality clinical studies to support evidence-based decisions on treatment choice. Our study aims to determine the feasibility of randomising men with RRPC for treatment with ADT and SPC. Methods:  The randomised controlled <b>trial</b> (<b>CROP)</b> was developed, which incorporated protocols to assess parameters relating to cryotherapy procedures and provide training workshops for optimising patient recruitment. Analysis of data from the recruitment phase and patient questionnaires was performed. Results:  Over a period of 18 months, 39 patients were screened for eligibility. Overall 28 patients were offered entry into the trial, but only 7 agreed to randomisation. The majority reason for declining entry into the trial was an unwillingness to be randomised into the study. ‘Having the chance of getting cryotherapy’ was the major reason for accepting the trial. Despite difficulty in retrieving cryotherapy temperature parameters from prior cases, 9 of 11 cryotherapy centres progressed through the Cryotherapists Qualification Process (CQP) and were approved for recruiting into the CROP study. Conclusions:  Conveying equipoise between the two study arms for a salvage therapy was challenging. The use of delayed androgen therapy may {{have been seen as}} an inferior option.

40|$|The {{opportunity}} for commercial production of Agave in Australia {{stems from the}} substantial carbohydrate and fibre content of Agave, the nature of carbohydrates stored, the pre-existence of an Agave ethanol-producing industry in Mexico, demand for biofuel feedstocks, impressive water-use efficiencies of plants with the CAM pathway, and legislation mandating the ethanol content of fuel in Australia, where an estimated 748 ML will be required for blending with petrol by 2010 – 2011, compared with about 440 ML in 2009. Agave has potential as a crop for areas of seasonally limited rainfall in Australia, a judgement based upon desktop analyses and agronomic experience of growing Agave in Australia before 1915. Development of a viable Australian Agave farming system requires production be located in suitable regions, efficient propagation methods, mechanized production, and viable business plans at grower, processor and marketing levels. Growers and processors agree that Agave will not be grown commercially until plants are grown, maintained and harvested in Australia, product is produced and tested, and yield and risks are evaluated. To this end, Agave were imported into Australia from Mexico and a tissue culture propagation technique developed. A <b>trial</b> <b>crop</b> of Agave tequilana was planted in northern Queensland and CO 2 exchange, nitrogen and water dynamics, carbohydrate content, and system inputs and outputs are being monitored.

40|$|In {{this study}} results are {{presented}} of investigations {{on the development of}} a cucumber crop in a closed rockwool system and on the potential change in microbial suppressiveness due to different disinfection methods after inoculating part of the plants with the fungal pathogen Pythium aphanidermatum. Two trials were executed at which the core treatments were disinfection (UV, slow filtration and no disinfection as control), while additional treatments were priming half of the systems before planting either with an 'old' nutrient solution from a former cucumber crop (spring trial) or an actinomycetes suspension (autumn <b>trial).</b> <b>Crop</b> developments (yield, disease and root development) and composition of the microflora were recorded. Non-inoculated plants showed that disinfection is needed either with UV or slow (sand) filtration to avoid spread of the pathogen; yield and root development was better and disease symptoms were less compared to the control. The hypothesis that passive disinfection might realise a more suppressive environment against Pythium aphanidermatum could not be proved, since inoculated plants showed a similar yield, disease and root development after the different disinfection treatments. Priming the nutrient solution with an 'old' solution did not show significant differences in the composition of the microflora either by plate-counts or by PCR-DGGE. However, the addition of actinomycetes before planting resulted a 100 to 1000 fold increase of the actinomycetes population in the cropping system up {{to the end of the}} trial. In the spring trial, differences within the microflora as a result of the disinfection treatments were only detected for pseudomonads. In the autumn trial, differences in numbers of pseudomonads, actinomycetes and fungi were significant in the treated nutrient solution, but not in the drain.

40|$|The {{majority}} of the people living in sub-Saharan Africa earn their living mainly by farming. Infertile soils and variable climate make it difficult to reach sufficient crop yields every year and therefore food security can be low. Soil quality reduction due to erosion and nutrient depletion due to limited addition and maintenance of nutrients is a common problem. One feasible measure to increase soil fertility is addition of biochar, charcoal produced during pyrolysis (organic material, usually wood, heated under low oxygen conditions), which generally is used as fuel for cooking. This Minor Field Study is a BSc thesis based on studies of biochar as soil amendment in Kenya. The project had three main objectives. The first aim was to, through visits, describe smallholder farming systems in three areas in Western, Central and Eastern Kenya. Interviews, observation and sampling of characteristic organic materials were performed in each area. The second aim was to measure whether biochar application to soil can increase crop yields and if so, if there are any differences between biochar originating from different feedstock organic materials. The third aim was to return to the involved farmers and discuss and present the results as well as the possible practical benefits. All the visited farms were small-scale systems with no or few external inputs. The farming systems were similar in all three areas, though some differences were found, e. g. dominating types of crops. Most of the farmers were interested in using biochar as soil amendment- if it would be proven to have beneficial effects and be economically viable. The results from analyses showed that nutrient concentration correlated with the yield from pot trials where three treatments stood out: biochar from cassava stems, coffee leaves and fresh banana leaves. Biochar from these materials in general had the highest nutrient concentration as well as pot <b>trial</b> <b>crop</b> yield, indicating a fertilizer effect. Plant materials with different properties may be important for plant growth, but biochar rate seems to be a more significant factor, confirmed by the statistical test. The great need of improvement in soil fertility and the farmers’ interest towards biochar indicate that this approach might be possible to use in the future. However, more research on the subject is necessary if {{it is going to be}} implemented in the field, since these farmers cannot afford failures...|$|E

The objectives of this work were to study the combination of no-till and the use of different crops and amounts of residues and their management on the evolution of soil organic matter. In two <b>trials,</b> <b>crops</b> were established under no-till over 3 years using different levels of wheat straw and their management and one treatment with residues of chickpea. Initial and final soil organic matter contents were analysed. The results indicate that the higher the amount of residues returned to the field the higher the increase of soil organic matter. Maintenance of straw compared to in situ feeding enhances the build-up of soil organic matter. Chickpea as a low biomass producing crop with a low C/N ratio of its residues showed no positive effect in terms of soil organic matter improvement. The results suggest that the return of cereal residues instead of its removal or grazing in combination with no-till for crop establishment can contribute considerably to improve the low soil organic matter levels found in Mediterranean environments...|$|R

40|$|Irrigation {{science in}} recent years has been driven largely by the {{technology}} requirements of large schemes where production would be impossible without irrigation. In these schemes the aim is often to remove water as a constraint to production, whereas in many sugar producing areas of Australia there is insufficient irrigation water to supplement rainfall fully and yields are often limited by water. Irrigation strategies developed for full irrigation systems may not always apply to supplementary systems with limited water. Drawn together in this paper are the results of replicated field <b>trials,</b> <b>crop</b> simulations and investment analysis to consider the long term benefits of installing and implementing supplementary irrigation in the Mackay and Atherton regions of Queensland, Australia. Large yield responses were obtained from relatively small but well-timed applications of water in two field experiments.

Mean response to irrigation simulated with the APSIM-Sugarcane model was similar to mean measured response. Simulations were then conducted to predict yearly fluctuations in yield response to supplementary irrigation applied in a variety of ways including winch, centre pivot and trickle irrigation systems, different scheduling options, different water allocations, different crop classes and diffcrent soils. Many of these options affected yield response probability and some had a profound effect on the financial investment feasibility of supplementary irrigation. Change in net present value over a 20 -year term due to irrigation was as high as +$l 20 000 for a trickle system on a sandy soil at Mackay and as low as-$l 96 000 for a winch system on a clay soil at Atherton...|$|R
40|$|Sorghum (Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench) {{is a major}} staple crop of Burkina Faso where farmers {{continue}} to cultivate photoperiod-sensitive guinea landraces {{as part of the}} strategy to minimize risk and ensure yield stability. In the Boucle du Mouhoun region, however, sorghum farmers appear to have insufficient varietal choice due to cropping systems having shifted towards more intensive cultivation of cotton and maize, and rainfall patterns having decreased over the past decade. In search for new varietal options that can respond to this changing context, researchers decided to give farmers access to ex-situ national collections along with the opportunity to evaluate recent improved varieties. From 2002 to 2007, researchers and farmers worked closely together to implement on-farm testing, including varietal selection <b>trials,</b> <b>crop</b> management and multi-locational trials. Farmers' choices tend to differ among groups, villages and years, with the exception of four particular landraces: two originating from a collection carried out in the Mouhoun region more than 30 years previous to this research, and two other landraces that came from the dissimilar agro-ecological zones of Burkina Faso. These four were the most commonly selected landraces out of 36 cultivars that covered both improved and landrace varieties. Farmers' selection criteria were focused on adaptation to agro-climatic conditions as well as specific grain qualities for processing and consumption. The potential usefulness of each variety was verified via multi-locational trials. The paper also shows that wide dissemination of experimental seed, not just across the Mouhoun region but also at a national scale, was largely achieved through collaboration with a strong farmer organisation in conjunction with farmer training programs focused on the on-farm seed production and the commercialisation of this seed.
