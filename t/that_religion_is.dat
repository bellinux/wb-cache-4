5|$|In his {{biography}} of Hick, David Cheetham notes {{a criticism of}} Hick's theory: waiting for eschatological verification could make religious belief provisional, preventing total commitment to faith. Cheetham argues that such criticism is misapplied because Hick's theory was not directed to religious believers but to philosophers, who argued <b>that</b> <b>religion</b> <b>is</b> unverifiable and therefore meaningless.|$|E
5|$|Wittgenstein {{believed}} <b>that</b> <b>religion</b> <b>is</b> {{significant because}} it offers a particular way of life, rather than confirming the existence of God. He therefore believed that religious language is confessional– a confession of what someone feels and believes– rather than consisting of claims to truth. Wittgenstein believed that religious language is different from language used to describe physical objects because it occupies a different language game.|$|E
5|$|Bahá'í teachings are in {{some ways}} similar to other monotheistic faiths: God is {{considered}} single and all-powerful. However, Bahá'u'lláh taught <b>that</b> <b>religion</b> <b>is</b> orderly and progressively revealed by one God through Manifestations of God who are the founders of major world religions throughout history; Buddha, Moses, Jesus, and Muhammad being the most recent in the period before the Báb and Bahá'u'lláh. As such, Bahá'ís regard the major religions as fundamentally unified in purpose, though varied in social practices and interpretations. There is a similar emphasis on the unity of all people, openly rejecting notions of racism and nationalism. At the heart of Bahá'í teachings {{is the goal of}} a unified world order that ensures the prosperity of all nations, races, creeds, and classes.|$|E

50|$|In Book I of the Discourses, Machiavelli expresses an {{interesting}} view of Fortune {{and its role}} in shaping history. While discussing the religion of the Romans, Machiavelli acknowledges that Numa Pompilius introduced religion as a social tool to keep the people in line and obedient. The way in which Numa used religion to tame a savage people convinces Machiavelli <b>that</b> <b>religion</b> <b>was</b> absolutely necessary for maintaining a government. But despite Machiavelli’s belief <b>that</b> <b>religion</b> <b>was</b> a fictional social construct, he still believes in the power and influence of fortune. For Machiavelli fortune plays a large role in affecting history; without fortune the Roman government would have never broken from the cycle of government demonstrated by Polybius. Fortune acted as a similar force to the role of gods, yet it was completely different in the sense <b>that</b> <b>religion</b> <b>was</b> man made and fortune existed naturally and benefited those who demonstrated good virtues.|$|R

Burke's religious thought was grounded in the belief <b>that</b> <b>religion</b> <b>is</b> the foundation of civil society. He sharply criticised deism and atheism, and emphasised Christianity as a vehicle of social progress. Born in Ireland to a Catholic mother and a Protestant father, Burke vigorously defended the Anglican Church, but also demonstrated sensitivity to Catholic concerns. He linked the conservation of a state (established) religion with the preservation of citizens' constitutional liberties and highlighted Christianity's benefit not only to the believer's soul, but also to political arrangements.|$|E

25|$|The {{majority}} of U.S. adults self-identify as Christians, while {{close to a}} quarter claim no religious affiliation. According to a 2014 study by the Pew Research Center, 70.6% {{of the adult population}} identified themselves as Christians, with 46.5% professing attendance at a variety of churches that could be considered Protestant, and 20.8% professing Catholic beliefs. The same study says that other religions (including Judaism, Buddhism, Hinduism, and Islam) collectively make up about 6% of the population. According to a 2012 survey by the Pew forum, 36% of U.S. adults state that they attend services nearly every week or more. According to a 2016 Gallup poll, Mississippi (with 63% of its adult population described as very religious, saying <b>that</b> <b>religion</b> <b>is</b> important to them and attending religious services almost every week) is the most religious state in the country, while New Hampshire (with only 20% of its adult population described as very religious) is the least religious state.|$|E
25|$|I cannot {{understand}} why we idle discussing religion. If we are honest—and scientists have to be—we must admit <b>that</b> <b>religion</b> <b>is</b> a jumble of false assertions, with no basis in reality. The very idea of God {{is a product of}} the human imagination. It is quite understandable why primitive people, who were so much more exposed to the overpowering forces of nature than we are today, should have personified these forces in fear and trembling. But nowadays, when we understand so many natural processes, we have no need for such solutions. I can't for the life of me see how the postulate of an Almighty God helps us in any way. What I do see is that this assumption leads to such unproductive questions as why God allows so much misery and injustice, the exploitation of the poor by the rich and all the other horrors He might have prevented. If religion is still being taught, it is by no means because its ideas still convince us, but simply because some of us want to keep the lower classes quiet. Quiet people are much easier to govern than clamorous and dissatisfied ones. They are also much easier to exploit. Religion is a kind of opium that allows a nation to lull itself into wishful dreams and so forget the injustices that are being perpetrated against the people. Hence the close alliance between those two great political forces, the State and the Church. Both need the illusion that a kindly God rewards—in heaven if not on earth—all those who have not risen up against injustice, who have done their duty quietly and uncomplainingly. That is precisely why the honest assertion that God is a mere product of the human imagination is branded as the worst of all mortal sins.|$|E

500|$|The text is a composite. Some {{of it is}} Leland's {{translation}} into English of {{an original}} Italian manuscript, the Vangelo (gospel). Leland reported receiving the manuscript from his primary informant on Italian witchcraft beliefs, a woman Leland referred to as [...] "Maddalena" [...] and whom he called his [...] "witch informant" [...] in Italy. The rest of the material comes from Leland's research on Italian folklore and traditions, including other related material from Maddalena. Leland had been informed of the Vangelos existence in 1886, but it took Maddalena eleven years to provide him with a copy. After translating and editing the material, it took another two years for the book to be published. Its fifteen chapters portray the origins, beliefs, rituals, and spells of an Italian pagan witchcraft tradition. The central figure of <b>that</b> <b>religion</b> <b>is</b> the goddess Aradia, who came to Earth to teach the practice of witchcraft to peasants {{in order for them}} to oppose their feudal oppressors and the Roman Catholic Church.|$|E

Chapter 10 discusses whether morality can be determined without the concept of God. Hitchens asserts that atheists [...] "have a fundamental inability to concede that to be effectively absolute, a moral code needs to be beyond human power to alter". He also describes as flawed his brother's assertion in God is Not Great that [...] "the order to love thy neighbour 'as thyself' is too extreme and too strenuous to be obeyed". Hitchens ends the chapter by stating, [...] "in all my experience in life, I have seldom seen a more powerful argument for the fallen nature of man, and his inability to achieve perfection, than those countries in which man sets himself up to replace God with the State". Hitchens begins Chapter 11 by asserting, [...] "those who reject God's absolute authority, preferring their own, are far more ready to persecute than Christians have been ... Each revolutionary generation reliably repeats the savagery". He cites as examples the French revolutionary terror; the Bolshevik revolution; the Holodomor and the Soviet famine of 1932–33; the barbarity surrounding Joseph Stalin's five-year plans, repeated in the Great Leap Forward in China; atrocities committed by the Khmer Rouge; and human rights abuses in Cuba under Fidel Castro. Hitchens then quotes a number of prominent communist thinkers' pronouncements on morality, including George Lukacs stating, [...] "Communist ethics make it the highest duty to accept the necessity of acting wickedly. This is the greatest sacrifice the revolution asks from us", and Leon Trotsky's claiming that [...] "morality, more than any other form of ideology, has a class character".|$|E
