The work focuses on how power curve estimations can introduce systematic errors that affect overall forecast performance. The results of the study highlight the importance of: accurately modelling the wind speed-to-power output relationships at higher wind speeds; <b>taking</b> account <b>of</b> power <b>curve</b> trends when training models; and the need to incorporate long-term (months to years) power curve variability into the forecast updating process...|$|R

At impurity concentration in the transition layer about and over 101 ¹⁸ cm-³, its thickness goes down, and it shows up as individual inclusions in the GaAs lattice.

In this paper we have analyzed blind signature schemes based on RSA and with <b>taking</b> advantage <b>of</b> elliptic <b>curve</b> cryptography to achieve the security goals. Blind signature scheme {{is one of the}} security protocol to obtain signature from a signer such that signer sign the message without reading the content of the message and also he could not link the protocol with the resulting message signature pair [7]. Blind signature scheme is used to achieve certain security goals like blindness, untraceability, authenticity, unforgeability [1]. We have analyzed blind signature scheme to achieve the security goals using Elliptic Curve Cryptosystem. Elliptic curve cryptography (ECC) is an approach to public-key cryptography based on the algebraic structure <b>of</b> elliptic <b>curves</b> over finite fields. The use <b>of</b> elliptic <b>curves</b> in cryptography was initially presented by Neal Koblitz and Victor S. Miller. Elliptic curve cryptosystem has advantages in terms of smaller key size and lower computational overhead in comparison with public key cryptosystem [2]. Many researchers have been presented the secure blind signature scheme with their own goals and limitations. Two properties a blind signature scheme should hold digital signature and blind signature. By using concept <b>of</b> Elliptic <b>Curve</b> Cryptosystem and blinding algorithm, the signer generates the blind signature without reading content of the message [5]. The scheme avoids the collision between different digital signatures generated by the same singer. The blind signature is a secure technique can be applied in e-business and other applications. Blind signature schemes are widely used for various applications of E-commerce like digital payment systems and electronic voting system etc where to maintain the privacy of consumer is necessary [9]...|$|R

40|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} requirements imposed to the modern mechanisms is economic feasibility. Therefore, considered as advanced are mechanical transducers of rotary motion to translational one, where rolling friction is mainly realized. They include planetary roller-screw mechanisms (PRSM). PRSM has a large variety of features. The design feature of PRSM is multiple starts of screw and nut thread. Rollers, as a rule, are made single-threaded. Number of screw thread starts which equals to a number of nut thread starts, has an effect on almost all performance characteristics of PRSM. This article covers comprehensively enough the influence of screw thread starts quantity on: kinematical parameters of PRSM, transfer function, mechanism radial dimensions, efficiency, power values, required characteristics of electric motor. As a result of investigations the graphs of dimensionless parameters vs. number of screw thread starts have been plotted, which are demonstrative and common. Being high enough the PRSM efficiency can vary within 20 … 25 % and more. It depends on a variety of mechanism part parameters; primarily on geometrical ones, as well as on a number of screw thread starts. Previously the methods of PRSM design calculation consisted in determination of the main geometric parameters of mechanism parts, then in determination of mechanism efficiency. At that, it was not always possible to design the economically feasible PRSM structure. Introduction of a dimensionless value – a relation of PRSM part thread pitch to average screw thread diameter – contributed to successive plotting of the assemblage <b>of</b> <b>curves</b> for relation <b>of</b> efficiency to the indicated ratio and a number of screw thread starts. By <b>taking</b> this assemblage <b>of</b> <b>curves</b> as a basis, the method of economically feasible PRSM structures calculation and design was proposed.   The essence of the developed method lies in that selection or definition of a number of screw thread starts helps to determine the relation of PRSM parts thread pitch to average diameter of screw thread which provides the maximum possible efficiency. Given further are check calculations confirming the operation capability of the selected PRSM design. </p...|$|R
