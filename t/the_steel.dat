5|$|Quenching {{involves}} heating <b>the</b> <b>steel</b> {{to create}} the austenite phase then quenching it in water or oil.

In this application the annealing (tempering) process transforms some of the martensite into cementite, or spheroidite and hence it reduces the internal stresses and defects.

5|$|Annealing is {{the process}} of heating <b>the</b> <b>steel</b> to a {{sufficiently}} high temperature to relieve local internal stresses. It does not create a general softening of the product but only locally relieves strains and stresses locked up within the material.

The temperature required to anneal a particular steel depends on the type of annealing to be achieved and the alloying constituents.|$|E

These closures caused a ripple effect, as railroads, mines, and other factories across the region lost business and closed. The local economy suffered a depression, marked by high unemployment and underemployment, as laid-off workers took lower-paying, non-union jobs. Pittsburgh suffered as elsewhere in the Rust Belt with a declining population, and like many other U.S. cities, it also saw white flight to the suburbs.|$|E

40|$|AbstractFusion {{welded joint}} of RAFM steel {{as in other}} {{ferritic}} steels possesses lower creep rupture strength than the base st el. The failure in the joint {{is associated with the}} soft intercritical region of heat affected zone, which is subjected to peak temperatures in between Ac 1 and Ac 3 during weld thermal cycle. In this investigation effort has been initiated to understand the effect of tungsten in softening the 9 Cr-W RAFM steels on intercritical temperature exposure. Metallographic investigations were carried out on <b>the</b> heat-treated <b>steels</b> by optical and transmission electron microscopes. <b>The</b> <b>steels</b> at all heat treated conditions had tempered martensitic structure. Refinement of prior austenitic grain of <b>the</b> <b>steels</b> was noticed on soaking in the intercritical temperature range. The grain size of <b>the</b> <b>steels</b> increased with soaking at temperatures well above the Ac 3 transformation temperature. TEM investigation revealed that the martensitic laths were decorated with M 23 C 6 type of carbides and the presence of MX type of (Ta,V) C carbides inside the laths. Hardness, tensile and creep tests were carried on <b>the</b> <b>steels</b> to elucidate <b>the</b> effects of soaking at temperatures in and around Ac 1 and Ac 3 transformation temperatures.
