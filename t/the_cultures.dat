5|$|As a {{cultural}} critic, Said {{is known for}} the book Orientalism (1978), {{a critique of the}} cultural representations that are the bases of Orientalism—how the Western world perceives the Orient.

As a foundational text, Orientalism was controversial among the scholars of Oriental Studies, philosophy, and literature.|$|E

5|$|For millennia, archery {{has played}} a pivotal role in Chinese history. Because <b>the</b> <b>cultures</b> {{associated}} with Chinese society spanned a wide geography and time range, the techniques and equipment associated with Chinese archery are diverse.

5000|$|The {{conflict}} {{was one of}} principles; <b>the</b> <b>Culture</b> went to war because the Idirans' fanatical imperial expansion, justified on religious grounds, threatened <b>the</b> <b>Culture's</b> [...] "moral right to exist".

5|$|In the laboratory, {{bacteria}} are usually grown using solid or liquid media. Solid growth media, such as agar plates, {{are used to}} isolate pure cultures of a bacterial strain.

The use of selective media (media with specific nutrients added or deficient, or with antibiotics added) can help identify specific organisms.|$|E
