5|$|A {{follow-up}} to , Battle for Naboo is a fast-paced, arcade-style action game. Each of the game's 15levels introduces mission objectives {{that must be}} completed to progress <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>level.</b> Enemy aircraft are primarily composed of Trade Federation Droid starfighters and air mines. Ground defenses are more varied and include battle and destroyer droids, laser and missile turrets, Armored Assault Tanks (AATs), Multi-troop transports (MTTs), gunboats and Single trooper aerial platform (STAPs).|$|E
5|$|As {{with its}} predecessor, {{gameplay}} is centred around Nights {{flying through the}} dreams of the two children. The main objective {{of the game is}} to fly through rings while gathering enough keys to proceed <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>level.</b> Development of Journey of Dreams began shortly after the release of Shadow the Hedgehog in 2005, and was headed by Sonic Team veteran Takashi Iizuka. The team took steps to ensure that the game stayed faithful to the original, while incorporating a variety of new mechanics and features. The game's setting was designed to resemble England, especially parts of London.|$|E

5|$|Jedi Knight is {{primarily}} a first-person shooter, although it does offer {{the choice of a}} third-person view. The game consists of twenty-one levels with objectives which the player must complete before being able to continue <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>level.</b> There are weapons available in each level and after level three, the player has the use of a lightsaber, along with the Force. In addition to being an effective weapon, the lightsaber is also a useful tool for the player, providing light in dark areas, deflecting incoming blaster fire and cutting through some obstacles.|$|E

5|$|There {{are four}} {{official}} levels of competition: local/scrimmage, regional, state, and national (Rounds 1, 2, 3, and 4 respectively). With {{the exception of}} Round 1, only the top finishers in each round advance <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>level.</b> California, the state with the largest Academic Decathlon, holds local scrimmages using the Round 1 tests, which are largely for practice and do not determine whether a team can compete at the regional level, which uses Round 2 tests. In the 2008–09 season, 43 states participated in statewide Academic Decathlons, though only 35 and an international school participated in the national competition.|$|E
5|$|Whack Ball is {{comparable}} to Breakout: the player controls a large ball with the Menacer to push a smaller on-screen ball into color-changing bricks that line the wall.

Players who hit flashing bricks are punished. Inadvertently guiding the ball {{through a hole in}} the wall ends the game.|$|E
5|$|According to Kohlberg, someone {{progressing}} to {{a higher}} stage of moral reasoning cannot skip stages. For example, an individual cannot jump from being concerned mostly with peer judgments (stage three) to being a proponent of social contracts (stage five). On encountering a moral dilemma and finding their current level of moral reasoning unsatisfactory, however, an individual will look <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>level.</b> Realizing {{the limitations of the}} current stage of thinking is the driving force behind moral development, as each progressive stage is more adequate than the last. The process is therefore considered to be constructive, as it is initiated by the conscious construction of the individual, and is not in any meaningful sense a component of the individual's innate dispositions, or a result of past inductions.|$|E

5|$|Gasketball is a part-basketball, part-puzzler shot-matching sports {{video game}} where players flick {{basketballs}} through 2D physics puzzles (with flippers, portals, circular saw blades, and gravity switches) into a basketball hoop. Some puzzles include banking the basketball shot off multiple surfaces {{before making the}} basket. In the HORSE-style games, the player must match the exact setup of the opponent's shot, such as hitting the floor before entering the hoop. In the campaign, players get more points for making the shot without retrying, and have five attempts to make the hoop before moving <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>level</b> shamefully. Players are awarded medals {{for the quality of}} their performance {{at the end of each}} chapter. Gold medals unlock new modes of play in the chapter. Every chapter has a unique theme, such as a construction site or outer space.|$|E
5|$|In Mission Mode, {{the player}} must {{complete}} missions, each with objectives {{that range from}} collecting coins to attacking enemies. In each mission, the player controls a pre-specified character. There are seven levels with eight missions in each. After completing each mission, the player's performance is given a grade of stars (three, two, or one) or letters (A, B, C, D, or E). After all eight missions in a level are complete, the player must complete a boss mission to advance <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>level.</b> Once the first six levels are complete, and the rank {{of at least one}} star has been obtained on every mission, the seventh level is unlocked.|$|E
5|$|Massaro {{also began}} a feud with then WWE Women's Champion, Raw's Melina, who was angry over the {{publicity}} Massaro had been receiving {{because of the}} cover. On the March 9 episode of SmackDown!, the rivalry was taken <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>level</b> when a catfight broke out on the inaugural edition of Miz TV. On the March 16 episode of SmackDown!, Ashley teamed up with London and Kendrick in a losing effort to the MNM (Mercury & Nitro & Melina) in a six-person mixed-tag-team match. On the March 23 episode of SmackDown!, Ashley would get a catfight after Melina attempted to make an interference during Kendrix and Paul's match with MNM. On the March 26 episode of Raw, Ashley teamed up with Torrie Wilson and Candice Michelle in a winning effort defeating Melina, Hall and Victoria. At WrestleMania 23, Massaro unsuccessfully challenged Melina for the WWE Women's Championship in a LumberJill match to retain her title.|$|E

5|$|Mysteries of the Sith is {{primarily}} a first-person shooter, but offers {{the choice of a}} third-person view. Unlike Dark Forces II, where the player's actions within the game dictate whether the story ends with the light side or the dark side ending, Mysteries of the Sith has a single, morally positive course. The player progresses through the game in a linear fashion; there are fourteen levels and each has set objectives that the player must complete before being able to continue <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>level.</b> Within each level the player can encounter both hostile and non-hostile non-player characters (NPCs). As well as including some enemies that featured in Dark Forces II, Mysteries of the Sith adds twenty new monsters, including a rancor. Some non-hostile NPCs may help the player by attacking enemies.|$|E
5|$|Throughout the game, {{the player}} must {{investigate}} the surroundings through finding and entering doors. These doors contain shops where players can buy equipment, rooms which provide additional information {{needed in the}} quest, traps which contain powerful enemies, and exits <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>level</b> which can be opened after finding a key. Some of the doors in the game are hidden and can only be found through by trial and error. At {{the beginning of the}} game, shops are visible and are clearly marked with the appropriate signs. Later on in the game, as Wonder Boy gets closer to the MEKA Dragon, the shop doors become unmarked while others are traps set by the level's bosses; {{near the end of the}} game, many of the shops are invisible and contain more powerful weapons. There are four types of shops throughout the game: boot shops allow the player to buy boots which make Wonder Boy jump higher and run faster, armor shops contain armor which makes Wonder Boy incur less damage from enemy attacks, shield shops contain shields which allow him to repel fire from enemies, and magical shops allow players to purchase Magic Weapons. There are also various rooms in the game which the player can enter and receive additional assistance in the quest: taverns where players can buy drinks and receive information from the bartender, Fortune Teller rooms where players may receive information about future events, and hospitals which allow players to refill their life meter and Hourglass Timer for a small price. Other rooms contain a boss in which the player must defeat to get the key <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>level,</b> to earn additional gold, or to upgrade to a more powerful sword.|$|E
5|$|Defender is a {{two-dimensional}} side-scrolling shooting game {{set on the}} surface of an unnamed planet. The player controls a space ship as it navigates the terrain, flying either to the left or right. A joystick controls the ship's elevation, and five buttons control its horizontal direction and weapons. The object is to destroy alien invaders, while protecting astronauts on the landscape from abduction. Humans that are abducted return as mutants that attack the ship. Defeating the aliens allows the player to progress <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>level.</b> Failing to protect the astronauts, however, causes the planet to explode and the level to become populated with mutants. Surviving the waves of mutants results in the restoration of the planet. Players are allotted three ships to progress through the game and are able to earn more by reaching certain scoring benchmarks. A ship is lost if it is hit by an enemy, or hit by an enemy projectile, or if a hyperspace jump goes wrong (as they randomly do). After exhausting all ships, the game ends.|$|E
30|$|Each {{level of}} {{threshold}} in TTSD {{acts as a}} filter to separate noisy pixels from the rest and passes only those pixels <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>levels</b> which are not detected as noisy pixels. Therefore, TTSD keeps on separating the noisy pixels after each level and probes the noise-free pixels level by level unless the three proposed statistical conditions of noisiness are verified. For every central pixel in a sliding window, unique threshold value is determined based on the surrounding pixel values. Therefore, the performance of detection in TTSD enhances.|$|R

5|$|Donkey Kong Country uses {{a series}} of map screens to track the players' progress. Between each level, players control their {{character}} on the map screen, navigating <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>level</b> they want to play. Each level on the map is marked with an icon: unfinished levels are marked by Kremlings (the game's main enemy), while friendly areas are marked {{by members of the}} Kong family. Every individual world map screen has one boss enemy {{at the end of the}} course, which must be defeated to travel back to the main map screen of the whole island. It is possible to access previous world maps without defeating the boss by finding Funky Kong and borrowing his barrel plane. Players use this ability to select the world from the main screen, then the level within it. During play the game interface hides most game-related information, such as the number of bananas, letters, and animal tokens collected, as well as the number of lives remaining. When an item is collected, the relevant information briefly appears on the screen.|$|E
5|$|In Challenge mode, {{the player}} must sneak around and deliver food to hungry NPCs. Hunger is {{indicated}} above thought bubbles which float above {{the heads of}} the NPCs. An NPC with a burger icon over their head is able to be given food, but they will lose their appetite if they spot the player. NPCs move around the map in a set pattern and have a narrow cone of vision to detect player. Erik Brudvig of IGN described this narrow cone of vision as being similar to those of Metal Gear Solid. NPCs can also detect the player by excessive noise, the amount of sound a player is making is indicated by a noise meter. Challenges can be failed if a player alerts NPCs to their presence. Successful delivery of an item requires sneaking up behind an NPC or surprising them from a hiding place. Points are awarded based on how hungry a character is, the player's stealth and proximity to the NPC and style points on delivery. When presenting food, a Flourish meter appears which quickly fills and empties, requiring a timed button press. The higher the flourish meter, the more style points. Each level has 20 associated challenges and fulfilling half the challenges on a level opens the way <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>level.</b> Once all 80 challenges are completed, an alternative costume is unlocked. Gamerscore is rewarded for achieving certain goals or style on the Xbox 360 version.|$|E
5|$|In the {{campaign}} mode, {{the objective of}} each level is the acquisition of the Portal Gem, usually {{in the possession of}} the heroic guardian of the realm, although it is sometimes in the possession of a rival keeper. Whoever has the Portal Gem must be defeated, so Horny can enter and claim it. The final level involves defeating King Reginald, overlord of the entire realm of Harmonia. Some levels have more specific conditions relating to this goal: for example, there is one level in which the player races against the clock to obtain the Portal Gem in the possession of a rival keeper before the heroes invade and try to do the same. If the heroes recover the Portal Gem, the player loses. Other game modes include My Pet Dungeon and Skirmish. In My Pet Dungeon, the player constructs a dungeon without campaign-style objectives, and can control if, when, and how heroes invade. Instead, there are criteria based on the dungeon composition and related activities, and there is no requirement to proceed <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>level</b> on completion. Skirmish involves competing against computer-controlled rival keepers, and the player can customize conditions such as which rooms and spells are available. Multiplayer is supported over IPX and TCP/IP and is otherwise similar to Skirmish. A patch added elite creatures (stronger than their normal counterparts) to the latter three modes. Elite creatures are attracted by constructing rooms with very specific tile arrangements.|$|E
