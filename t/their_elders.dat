5|$|The 13th century saw popular {{outbursts of}} ecstatic piety {{in support of}} the Crusades such as that {{resulting}} in the Children's Crusade in 1212. Large groups of young adults and children spontaneously gathered, believing their innocence would enable success where <b>their</b> <b>elders</b> had failed. Few, if any at all, journeyed to the Eastern Mediterranean. Though little reliable evidence survives for these events, they provide an indication of how hearts and minds could be engaged for the cause.|$|E
5|$|In 1985, {{producers}} Ben Mandelson and Roger Armstrong visited Madagascar {{in search}} of artists to record for a planned album of Malagasy music. Rakoto Frah soon came to their attention, and they offered him a full-length album of his own. Two of Rakoto Frah's granddaughters provided vocals for this album, which was entitled Rakoto Frah: Flute Master of Madagascar. From the mid-1980s onward, Rakoto Frah enjoyed a revival in popularity, particularly among the youth, {{many of whom were}} seeking to reconnect with the traditions of <b>their</b> <b>elders.</b> In addition to recording numerous tracks and albums of his own, the flutist often appeared as a guest artist on the albums of others. Rakoto Frah again {{became one of the most}} famous and respected musicians within Madagascar and among the most recognized Malagasy performers in the world music circuit.|$|E
5|$|While {{humans have}} the ability to learn any language, they only do so if they grow up in an {{environment}} in which language exists and is used by others. Language is therefore dependent on communities of speakers in which children learn language from <b>their</b> <b>elders</b> and peers and themselves transmit language to their own children. Languages are used by those who speak them to communicate and to solve a plethora of social tasks. Many aspects of language use can be seen to be adapted specifically to these purposes. Due {{to the way in which}} language is transmitted between generations and within communities, language perpetually changes, diversifying into new languages or converging due to language contact. The process is similar to the process of evolution, where the process of descent with modification leads to the formation of a phylogenetic tree.|$|E

5|$|When {{high school}} {{students}} followed the lead of <b>their</b> <b>elders</b> and demonstrated, Diệm had them arrested as well. Two of the detained students were paraded {{at a press conference}} in which they falsely admitted to being communists who had brainwashed their entire school, having been tortured to force their confession. At Trung Vuong, an elite girls' high school, the students hung up banners attacking Diệm and the Nhus, while students from the corresponding boys' schools became violent, smashing school windows and erecting banners that insulted Madame Nhu in explicit language. More than 1000 students from Saigon's leading high school, most of them children of public servants and military officers, were sent to re-education camps. The result was that many army officers and senior civil servants had to lobby to have their children or younger siblings released from jail, causing a further drop in morale among government and military officials. In more extreme cases, brawls broke out between police officers arresting students, and the students' parents, many of whom were military officers and/or public servants.|$|E

30|$|Elders are {{not always}} role models {{in the strict sense}} of the term. To quote Widmer (quoted by Oris et al. 2007) “interaction can also take the form of {{rejection}} or rebellion”. Some younger siblings thus construct their educational pathways as a reaction against their perception of <b>their</b> <b>elder</b> siblings. An elder sibling’s failure might encourage younger siblings not to repeat the same pattern. Conversely, in conditions of high unemployment, younger siblings are often affected by <b>their</b> <b>elder</b> siblings’ experiences of unemployment, job insecurity and over qualification. They might decide not to work hard at school as <b>their</b> <b>elder</b> siblings did, because they see it as “pointless”.|$|R

25|$|From their {{earliest}} recorded history, the Chinese {{observed a}} number of naming taboos, avoiding the names of <b>their</b> <b>elders,</b> ancestors, and rulers out of respect and fear.

25|$|With the {{originality}} {{with which}} they approached problems, the young team made La Voix du Tunisien a popular newspaper. They soon stood out from <b>their</b> <b>elders</b> of the Destour by establishing a new thinking: They {{were in favor of}} the inviolability of the national personality and political sovereignty of the Tunisian people plus a gradual emancipation of the country, by advocating for a nationalism that fought against a regime and not against civilization. But their new thinking soon started a fight with Khairallah about the management of the newspaper. It ended with the resignation of the five editors who decided to found their own paper. A drafting committee gathering Habib and M'hamed Bourguiba, Guiga, Sfar, El Materi and Ali Bouhajeb, a pharmacist friend, created L'Action Tunisienne. Its first edition was published on November 1, 1932. Disappointed in the resigned moderation of <b>their</b> <b>elders,</b> the team worked on defending lower classes and expressing colonial inequalities.|$|E

25|$|Next, Dawkins {{discusses}} {{specifically the}} idea of religion seen as a virus {{in the sense of}} a meme. He begins by explaining how a child is genetically programmed to believe without questioning the word of authority figures, especially parents – the evolutionary imperative being that no child would survive by adopting a sceptical attitude towards everything <b>their</b> <b>elders</b> said. But this same imperative, he claims, leaves children open to infection by religion.|$|E
25|$|By law and custom, Muscovite Russia was {{a patriarchal}} society that subordinated women to men, {{and the young}} to <b>their</b> <b>elders.</b> Peter the great relaxed the second custom, but not the {{subordination}} of women. A decree of 1722 explicitly forbade any forced marriages by requiring both bride and groom to consent, while parental permission still remained a requirement. But during Peter's reign, only the man could get rid of his wife by putting her in a nunnery.|$|E

25|$|Slate Magazines Julia Turner compares Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince to the War on Terror in {{the context}} of the fight against Osama bin Laden saying Voldemort takes up {{terrorism}} by destroying bridges, murdering innocents, and forcing children to kill <b>their</b> <b>elders.</b> She also notes the parallels in the community's response saying Fred and George Weasley's shop makes a mint selling Shield Cloaks and the new Minister of Magic jails an innocent man, hoping to stave off panic and create the impression that he's taking action.|$|E
25|$|The Filipinos to {{an extent}} {{resisted}} Christianisation because they felt an agricultural obligation and connection with their rice fields, as large villages took away their resources and they feared the compact environment. This also took away from the encomienda system that depended on land, therefore, the encomenderos lost tributes. However, the missionaries continued their proselytising efforts, one strategy being targeting noble children. These scions of now-tributary monarchs and rulers were subjected to intense education in religious doctrine and the Spanish language, with the theory that they in turn could convert <b>their</b> <b>elders,</b> and eventually, the nobleman's subjects.|$|E
25|$|Legal status {{can thus}} {{lead to a}} {{restructuring}} of traditional family roles. Family members who may have previously been the primary breadwinners {{in the country of}} origin may be unable to find gainful employment due to their undocumented status. Family members who are legal citizens and thus have access to a wider range of employment opportunities may therefore hold a greater measure of power within the family. When these family members are children, who might traditionally be expected to defer to <b>their</b> <b>elders,</b> such an imbalance in legal status may create an upheaval in the traditional familial relations.|$|E
