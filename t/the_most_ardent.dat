5|$|Women {{were among}} <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>ardent.</b> In some {{municipalities}} the women organized themselves into women's sections and in others even in exclusively female Fasci. The strongest and most numerous presence of women {{was in the}} Fascio of Piana degli Albanesi, where over a thousand of the 3,500 members were women in a town of 9,000 inhabitants. For the Fasci the women abandoned the Church, but not the religious sentiment, to protest against the priests, {{who had tried to}} frighten them and isolate them with the threat of excommunication. In Piana the women organised a boycott of annual religious procession in protest of the priest’s opposition to the movement in 1893.|$|E

The remnants of the Lancastrian court party coalesced support around Henry Tudora relatively unknown scion of the Beauforts. They had been amongst <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>ardent</b> supporters of the House of Lancaster and were descended illegitimately from John of Gaunt by his mistress Katherine Swynford. However John of Gaunt and Katherine subsequently married and their children were legitimated by the Pope and by Parliament {{during the reign of}} Richard II. Henry IV had tried to debar them from the succession by use of his royal prerogative to avoid competition with the House of Lancaster’s claims to the throne but this was of limited effect. By some calculations of primogeniture, there were as many as 18 peopleincluding both his mother and future wifewith what some might claim a better right to the throne. By 1510, this figure had increased with the birth of an additional 16 possible Yorkist claimants.|$|E
5|$|On local issues, Howard was an {{advocate}} of opening Richmond to gambling facilities, {{which led to the}} River Rock Casino Resort. He was supportive of heritage preservation measures but opposed Richmond's tree preservation bylaw. He was the only one on council who preferred the elevated option for the Canada Line (then known as the Richmond-Airport-Vancouver Line), whereas the other councillors preferred the ground level option or no SkyTrain extension at all. He was {{an advocate}} for building a convention centre and <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>ardent</b> supporter of removing a 55-acre piece of land from the Agricultural Land Reserve as a possible location for it, though the removal was refused. When the possibility of the city constructing a speed-skating oval associated with the 2010 Winter Olympics came, Howard was a vocal supporter. He travelled to Lillehammer, Norway, in 2004 as part of a committee to investigate similar facilities built for the 1994 Winter Olympics. He also traveled to Pierrefonds, Quebec and Asia as part of the sister city program. He was not supportive of proposals to build a new soccer facility or financially contributing to tall ships tourism attractions. Because previous councils had made funding commitments {{at the expense of the}} city's reserve funds rather than the tax base, Howard's time on council was marked with consistent property tax increases around 3 to 4% each year. Howard unsuccessfully lobbied other councillors to hire more police officers. He became the subject of a lawsuit, along with other Richmond First councillors, alleging a conflict-of-interest occurred after they approved a rezoning allowing a controversial pub.|$|E

5|$|Furthermore, the Prime Minister's {{own party}} was {{breaking}} down underneath him. There {{had been no}} official party platform yet agreed to, and individual members had a wide degree of latitude to determine the issues they ran on, leading to frequent government defections on legislation. The government's existing nine-seat majority shrank during 1928 and 1929 over various issues, {{as a result of}} by-elections, and several leading figures who had previously worked with Bruce became increasingly sharp critics of him.

25|$|About {{this time}} the band {{switched}} to wearing leather stage outfits. This fitted their 'bad-boy' image and had a more practical outcome—it was routine for the band to have their clothes and hair literally torn off by frantic fans, {{and the cost of}} buying expensive stage clothes which were being shredded nightly was sending them broke. But the leather gear—which resisted even <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>ardent</b> fans—provided them with their longest-wearing outfits in years, and Keays maintains it saved them thousands of dollars.|$|E
25|$|This {{concerns}} {{itself with}} fiery religious fanaticism stoked {{up by the}} sudden death of a loved one. The idea behind the song is that even <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>ardent</b> supporter of peace can be drawn into violent conflict if their faith is shattered beyond repair. The title reflects the onset of spiritual darkness that pervades and eventually clouds the mind through irrevocable grief and irretrievable loss. Without sounding too political, one can draw a parallel with the current clime of terrorism, where normally peaceful religious groups are being incensed to hatred.|$|E
25|$|In {{response}} to continued British interference with American shipping (including {{the practice of}} impressment of American sailors into the British Navy), and to British aid to American Indians in the Old Northwest, the Twelfth Congress—led by Southern and Western Jeffersonians—declared war on Britain in 1812. Westerners and Southerners were <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>ardent</b> supporters of the war, given their concerns about defending national honor and expanding western settlements, and having access to world markets for their agricultural exports. New England was making a fine profit and its Federalists opposed the war, {{almost to the point}} of secession. The Federalist reputation collapsed in the triumphalism of 1815 and the party no longer played a national role.|$|E

50|$|The {{publication}} of the writers Adam Buenosayres, considered {{by many as the}} fundamental novel of Argentine literature, did not have the expected repercussion, possibly due to the poets open sympathies for the government of Juan Domingo Perón, the controversial populist leader greatly influenced by his radical wife Evita.

25|$|Before 1956 and {{according}} to the 1948 census there were 65,639 Egyptian Jews, including Karaites. Jews participated in all aspects of Egypt's social, economic and political life; one of <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>ardent</b> Egyptian nationalists, Yaqub Sanu' (Abu Naddara), was Jewish, as were the musician Dawoud Husni, popular singer Leila Mourad and filmmaker Togo Mizrahi. For a while, Jews from across the Ottoman Empire and Europe were attracted to Egypt due to the relative harmony that characterized the local religious landscape in the 19th and early 20th centuries. After the 1956 Suez Crisis, a great number of Jews were expelled by Gamal Abdel Nasser. Their Egyptian citizenship was revoked and their properties were confiscated. A steady stream of emigration of Egyptian Jews followed, reaching a peak after the Six-Day War with Israel in 1967. As of mid-2016, there were a total of 6 Jews remaining in Egypt (including their spiritual leader, Magda Tania Haroun), all women over the age of 65.|$|E
25|$|The {{election}} of Lincoln in 1860 inspired one of <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>ardent</b> secessionists in Louisiana, its governor, Thomas Overton Moore, {{who had taken}} office on January 23, 1860. Governor Moore interdicted {{an effort to make}} New Orleans a “free city”, or neutral area in the conflict. A solid Democrat, Moore organized an effective and discreet movement that voted Louisiana out of the Union in a secession convention that represented only 5 per cent of the citizens of Louisiana. Moore also ordered the Louisiana militia to seize the Federal arsenal at Baton Rouge, and the Federal forts (Fort Jackson and Fort St. Philip that blocked approach upriver to New Orleans, Fort Pike that guarded the entrance to Lake Pontchartrain, the New Orleans Barracks south of the city, and Fort Macomb, which guarded the Chef Menteur Pass). These military moves were ordered on January 8, 1861, before the secession convention. With military companies forming all over Louisiana, the convention itself was anti-climactic, voting Louisiana out of the Union 113 to 17. The outbreak of hostilities in the area of Fort Sumter, South Carolina, led to the story of New Orleans in the Civil War.|$|E
25|$|The {{process of}} {{preserving}} the sites of the Pajarito Plateau proved difficult and time-consuming, partly because interactions among the affected parties were complex, and partly because when Roosevelt passed the reins of government to William Howard Taft, enthusiasm in the White House for preserving such sites was diminished. Another factor {{had to do with}} Hewett's own personality. He had many supporters, but also many critics, and some of the latter complained that his real goal was to ensure that he, Edgar L. Hewett, D.Sc., Director of the School of American Research, would have access to, and control of, the Plateau's sites—while his rivals would not. Negotiations over a new monument were long and contentious, but finally, on February 11, 1916, President Woodrow Wilson proclaimed the new Bandelier National Monument, naming it for Adolph Bandelier who had died recently. The monument was rather smaller than Hewett had hoped, covering only Frijoles Canyon, some comparatively empty land to the southwest, and an outlier (now Tsankawi), and omitting among others the very significant Puye Cliff Dwellings near Santa Clara Pueblo. However, even <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>ardent</b> preservationists had to admit that, from the standpoint of protecting Puebloan sites, Bandelier was much better than nothing.|$|E

And these days, it's hard not to find any pop record that provokes those adjectives rather cheering." [...] Music critic Robert Christgau termed Laundry Service [...] "the Cher album Cher never made" [...] and attributed this to Shakira's blend of Middle Eastern styles in her music; he commented that the [...] "stylistic appetite of this Colombian superstar is pure rock en Español" [...] and appreciated Shakira's confident songwriting. Christgau also noted Shakira's strong vibrato and constant changing of timbre in her vocals. Lisa Oliver from Yahoo! Music said that Shakira's experimentation with different styles yield [...] "results ranging from corking to minging," [...] but experienced difficulty with the formatting of the CD, saying [...] "the biggest problem with 'Laundry Service' is the anti-copying device that renders the CD useless in anything other than a conventional CD player [...] A shame then, because this Latino hottie could dilate the musical pupils of even <b>the</b> <b>most</b> <b>ardent</b> homebody if only they could get off the computer long enough to hear it." ...|$|E
