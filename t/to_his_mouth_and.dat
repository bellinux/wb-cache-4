500|$|The stage {{antics of}} Santiago often contrasted with his {{generally}} quiet demeanor; he often experimented with his guitar and equipment during songs. Deal's husband, John Murphy, said that during performances of [...] "Vamos", which features guitar feedback throughout, Santiago used to [...] "whack {{the crap out}} of his amp", often picking up the amplifier and moving it around. During some solos, Santiago would often pull the guitar up <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>mouth</b> <b>and</b> break guitar strings with his teeth.|$|E

Initially used to mop up behind the two brigades bearing {{the brunt of the}} New Zealand attack, it was decided that the battalion would be used for [...] This attack, to be launched on 2 November, was designed to breach the German lines and establish a corridor through which British armour could break out from Alamein. His battalion subordinate to the British 151 Infantry Brigade for the operation, Baker was unhappy with the lack of detail in the planning of the operation.

His wounds, <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>mouth</b> <b>and</b> tongue, were serious and he was repatriated to New Zealand where he would spend nearly a year in extensive rehabilitation. His exploits as commander of the 28th Battalion were recognised with an award of the Distinguished Service Order, which was gazetted in 1944.|$|E

60|$|So saying, he put {{the flute}} <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>mouth,</b> <b>and</b> ran {{up and down a}} long flourish.|$|E
60|$|And so saying, Jack {{once more}} brought his hat-rim <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>mouth,</b> <b>and</b> {{slightly}} bending forward, stood mute.|$|E
60|$|The clerk was silent; he put {{his hand}} helplessly <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>mouth,</b> <b>and</b> then dropped it at his side again.|$|E
60|$|Captain Brisket gave {{a hoarse}} laugh and winked at Mr. Stobell; that gentleman, merely pausing <b>to</b> empty <b>his</b> <b>mouth</b> <b>and</b> drink half {{a glass of}} beer, winked back.|$|R
6000|$|Says Turpin, 'You shall {{eat your}} words, [...] With a sarse of leaden bul-let'; [...] So {{he puts a}} pistol <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>mouth,</b> [...] <b>And</b> he fires it down his gul-let.|$|R

60|$|The night {{proved to}} be unusually warm, for the breeze which was usually {{stirring}} had died down completely. Dave fell into a fitful doze, from which he awoke about midnight <b>to</b> find <b>his</b> <b>mouth</b> <b>and</b> throat quite parched.|$|R
60|$|It was Lawyer Maxwell's turn {{to become}} dumb. In his {{astonished}} abstraction he forgot <b>to</b> wipe <b>his</b> <b>mouth,</b> <b>and</b> gazed at Gabriel with his nervous smile {{as if his}} client had just perpetrated a practical joke of the first magnitude.|$|R
6000|$|Billy {{took the}} tiller in silence. After {{a little while}} Gaff drew his son's ear near <b>to</b> <b>his</b> <b>mouth,</b> <b>and</b> {{said in a low}} whisper-- ...|$|E

60|$|This Essper {{did with}} dexterity and quiet, {{displaying}} {{at the same}} time a small white hand, on the back of which was marked a comet and three daggers.

Mr. Grin grows to an {{enormous}} size, bursting out of the cage and floating away as Molly {{and the boys}} flee. The Mollusks are furious and pursue them.|$|R
