2500|$|A central {{timing and}} firing system was on board Atlanta to direct photo planes, smoke rockets and {{hundreds}} of recording instruments, the synchronization of which was essential. The test shots resembled a small nuclear explosion, creating a shock wave {{on the water and}} an expanding shock condensation cloud. The fireball and mushroom cloud were present (but obviously no radiation or dangerous fallout was produced). The blast created an overpressure of 10 psi on the target, a moving wall of highly compressed air with maximum wind speeds of 294mph. An overpressure blast of that magnitude is equivalent to a [...] burst at roughly 8000 feet and is sufficient to be lethal and capable of destroying reinforced concrete buildings. Knowing the yield of the blast, this also implies the Atlanta was placed around 800 feet away from ground zero for that particular test. Two blimps were also destroyed high above ground, and a life size mannequin placed on the deck facing the blast was violently thrown over. The first test Bravo also produced a large amount of rock ejecta that caused secondary damage. To solve this problem, the second shot was placed over a five-foot mound of sand, and the last shot Delta was detonated over the previous crater <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>back</b> filled with 39,000 cubic yards of sand.|$|E

60|$|So spake the lady; {{and after}} that Sir Percival gave her gramercy and therewith he and Sir Ector took their departure. And so they {{travelled}} some little while by {{the margin of the}} lake as the lady with the sparrow-hawk had directed, and by and by they came to that part of the lake <b>that</b> <b>was</b> <b>back</b> of the castle. Here they beheld a vessel such as the lady had described, and they beheld a hut beside the margin of the lake; and when they called there came forth out of the hut the ferryman and two others who were his sons. Of these Sir Percival made demand that they should transport him across the lake to the island and thereupon the ferryman immediately prepared to do so.|$|E
6000|$|Two {{hours later}} by his watch, Thomas Gradman, {{stirring}} in his swivel chair, closed the last drawer of his bureau, and putting into his waistcoat pocket {{a bunch of}} keys so fat that {{they gave him a}} protuberance on the liver side, brushed his old top hat round with his sleeve, took his umbrella, and descended. Thick, short, and buttoned closely into his old frock coat, he walked toward Covent Garden market. He never missed that daily promenade to the Tube for Highgate, and seldom some critical transaction on the way in connection with vegetables and fruit. Generations might be born, and hats might change, wars be fought, and Forsytes fade away, but Thomas Gradman, faithful and grey, would take his daily walk and buy his daily vegetable. Times were not what they were, and his son had lost a leg, and they never gave him those nice little plaited baskets to carry the stuff in now, and these Tubes were convenient things--still he mustn't complain; his health was good considering his time of life, and after fifty-four years in the Law he was getting a round eight hundred a year and a little worried of late, because it was mostly collector's commission on the rents, and with all this conversion of Forsyte property going on, it looked like drying up, and the price of living still so high; but it was no good worrying--"The good God made us all"--as he was in the habit of saying; still, house property in London--he didn't know what Mr. Roger or Mr. James would say if they could see it being sold like this--seemed to show a lack of faith; but Mr. Soames--he worried. Life and lives in being and twenty-one years after--beyond that you couldn't go; still, he kept his health wonderfully--and Miss Fleur was a pretty little thing--she was; she'd marry; but lots of people had no children nowadays--he had had his first child at twenty-two; and Mr. Jolyon, married while he was at Cambridge, had his child the same year--gracious Peter! <b>That</b> <b>was</b> <b>back</b> in '69, a long time before old Mr. Jolyon--fine judge of property--had taken his Will away from Mr. James--dear, yes! Those were the days when they were buyin' property right and left, and none of this khaki and fallin' over one another to get out of things; and cucumbers at twopence; and a melon--the old melons, that made your mouth water! Fifty years since he went into Mr. James' office, and Mr. James had said to him: [...] "Now, Gradman, you're only a shaver--you pay attention, and you'll make your five hundred a year before you've done." [...] And he had, and feared God, and served the Forsytes, and kept a vegetable diet at night. And, buying a copy of John Bull--not that he approved of it, an extravagant affair--he entered the Tube elevator with his mere brown-paper parcel, and was borne down into the bowels of the earth.|$|E

Jyamao notes the more extreme nature of the jokes surrounding the yakuza characters {{in comparison to the}} jokes involving cross-dressing, and that some jokes such as those involving drugs would not be humorous today. Manga commentator Nobunaga Minami lauded Eguchi for being a pioneer in drawing characters with a high fashion sense in Stop!! Hibari-kun!, which he says effectively changed fashion in shōnen manga from being seen as a [...] "symbol" [...] to now being treated as an [...] "accessory". Eguchi's attention to detail is also praised, such as drawing Kōsaku wearing Chuck Taylor All-Stars in one chapter.|$|E
