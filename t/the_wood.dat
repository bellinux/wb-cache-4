5|$|Although <b>the</b> <b>wood</b> {{recovered}} from the Levels was visually intact, it was extremely degraded and very soft. Where possible, pieces of wood in good condition, or the worked ends of pegs, were taken away and conserved for later analysis. The conservation process involved keeping <b>the</b> <b>wood</b> in heated tanks in a solution of polyethylene glycol and, by a process of evaporation, gradually replacing the water in <b>the</b> <b>wood</b> with the wax {{over a period of}} about nine months. After this treatment <b>the</b> <b>wood</b> was removed from the tank and wiped clean. As the wax cooled and hardened, the artefact became firm and could be handled freely.|$|E
5|$|For proper {{protection}} of <b>the</b> <b>wood</b> turtle,in-depth land surveys of its habitat to establish population numbers are needed. One emerging {{solution to the}} highway mortality problem, which primarily affects nesting females, is the construction of under-road channels. These tunnels allow <b>the</b> <b>wood</b> turtle to pass under the road, a solution that helps prevent accidental deaths. Brochures and other media that warn people to avoid keeping <b>the</b> <b>wood</b> turtle as a pet are currently being distributed. Next, leaving nests undisturbed, especially common nesting sites and populations, is the best solution to enable <b>the</b> <b>wood</b> turtle's survival.|$|E
5|$|Formerly in {{the genus}} Clemmys, <b>the</b> <b>wood</b> turtle {{is now a}} member of the genus Glyptemys, a {{classification}} that <b>the</b> <b>wood</b> turtle shares with only the bog turtle. It and the bog turtle have a similar genetic makeup, which is marginally {{different from that of the}} spotted turtle (Clemmys guttata), the only current member of the genus Clemmys. <b>The</b> <b>wood</b> turtle has undergone extensive scientific name changes by various scientists over the course of its history. Today, there are several prominent common names for <b>the</b> <b>wood</b> turtle, including sculptured tortoise, red-legged tortoise, and redleg.|$|E

5|$|The eastern box turtle (Terrapene c. carolina) and Blanding's turtle {{are similar}} in {{appearance}} to <b>the</b> <b>wood</b> turtle and all three live in overlapping habitats. However, unlike <b>the</b> <b>wood</b> turtle, both Blanding's turtle and the eastern box turtle have hinged plastrons {{that allow them to}} completely close their shells. The diamondback terrapin (Malaclemys terrapin) has a shell closely resembling <b>the</b> <b>wood</b> turtle's; however its skin is gray in color, and it inhabits coastal brackish and saltwater marshes. The bog turtle and spotted turtle are also similar, but neither of these has the specific sculptured surface found on the carapaces of <b>the</b> <b>wood</b> turtle.|$|E

5|$|Cheddar Wood and {{the smaller}} Macall's Wood form a {{biological}} Site of Special Scientific Interest from what remains of <b>the</b> <b>wood</b> of the Bishops of Bath and Wells in the 13thcentury and of King Edmund the Magnificent's wood in the 10th. During the 19thcentury, its lower fringes were grubbed out to make strawberry fields. Most of these {{have been allowed to}} revert to woodland. <b>The</b> <b>wood</b> was coppiced until 1917. This site compromises a wide range of habitats which include ancient and secondary semi-natural broadleaved woodland, unimproved neutral grassland, and a complex mosaic of calcareous grassland and acidic dry dwarf-shrub heath. Cheddar Wood is one of only a few English stations for starved wood-sedge (Carex depauperata). Purple gromwell (Lithospermum purpurocaeruleum), a nationally rare plant, also grows in <b>the</b> <b>wood.</b> Butterflies include silver-washed fritillary (Argynnis paphia), dark green fritillary (Argynnis aglaja), pearl-bordered fritillary (Boloria euphrosyne), holly blue (Celastrina argiolus) and brown argus (Aricia agestis). The slug Arion fasciatus, which has a restricted distribution in the south of England, and the soldier beetle Cantharis fusca also occur.|$|E

5|$|During the night, the 113th and 114th Infantry Brigades {{were ordered}} out of <b>the</b> <b>wood</b> and the 115th Brigade {{assembled}} in their place.

Evans, wanted to launch a surprise attack but was overruled. The subsequent bombardment to support the attack fell short in places, hitting British troops and provoking German artillery fire. As well as the friendly fire, the barrage also caught German troops in the open as they fled from <b>the</b> <b>wood.</b> The remaining Germans offered determined resistance and the 16th Welsh were held up by machine gun fire {{and the use of}} a flamethrower. Despite this, the brigade was able to clear Mametz Wood {{by the end of the}} day.

5|$|Generally, in {{cabinets}} or {{display cases}} that are entirely or partially made of wood, the hydrolysis of acetyl groups in <b>the</b> <b>wood</b> hemicelluloses creates acetic acid. The {{rate at which the}} acetic acid is produced is proportional to the concentration of esters in <b>the</b> <b>wood,</b> the humidity, the temperature, and the overall acidity of the environment. Acidic fumes can also be released from formaldehyde which can occur in wood as a degradation product of lignin. Acidic fumes can also be given off from ubiquitous formaldehyde resins (commonly urea-formaldehyde resins).|$|E

However, when Le Fur attempts to smuggle <b>the</b> <b>wood</b> out of the country, he is killed by a bomb at the airport and the cross is taken by a man named Helmut Gunsche.

5|$|In February 1931, {{the woods}} were {{included}} in a sale by King's College to the urban district council.

King's had also wished to present <b>the</b> <b>wood</b> as a gift but was required by the University and College's Act to receive payment as it was the trustee of the land. Middlesex County Council contributed 75% of the cost, as the urban district council argued that many of those who would make use of the land would be recreational day-trippers from outside the district. Under a 999-year lease, the council agreed to maintain <b>the</b> <b>wood</b> and ensure no new building was constructed without the permission of the county council.
