5|$|Muhammad and {{the other}} prophets of Islam, bored of living in jannah (heaven) and weary of singing the praises of Allah, request {{permission}} to return to Earth. Disappointed by the prophets' request, Allah calls on Muhammad <b>to</b> <b>explain</b> <b>why</b> <b>he</b> wishes to return, as Allah had already granted him many things. Muhammad replies that he wishes to conduct research, to discover why so few Muslims are coming to heaven. Allah, after removing his glasses, responds that the people had been poisoned by Sukarno's policy of Nasakom and grants Muhammad permission to investigate further.|$|E
5|$|Brian, {{the family}} dog, asks Kevin <b>to</b> <b>explain</b> <b>why</b> <b>he</b> deserted the army, with Kevin {{telling him that}} he had grown tired of the war, and had befriended many of the Iraqis, leading him to want to try to escape. Kevin and the family then begin {{fighting}} over the United States's occupation of Iraq, with Brian sympathizing with him, and several others, including Quagmire's Dad, a war veteran, disagreeing with Kevin's choice to desert the army. Joe then begins to take his son to jail. Kevin reminds his father of a time when he let a homeless man get away with stealing a can of tomato soup to feed his hungry family, for whom he had felt sorry. Emotional and sympathetic, Joe agrees to let his son off the hook, and the two make amends.|$|E
5|$|Captain America {{was put on}} hold {{during the}} 2007–2008 Writers Guild of America strike. However, in January 2008, Marvel Entertainment reached an interim {{comprehensive}} agreement with the Writers Guild of America that would put writers immediately back to work on various projects that were under the company's development. On May 5, 2008 (after the success of Iron Man), Marvel announced the film The First Avenger: Captain America (the working title) for release in May 6, 2011 (before being pushed back to July 22). Louis Leterrier, director of The Incredible Hulk, viewed some of the concept art being created for the film and was impressed enough to offer his services, but Marvel turned him down. Johnston finally signed on in November 2008, and he hired Christopher Markus & Stephen McFeely to rewrite. Feige cited Johnston's directorial work on October Sky and The Rocketeer and his special effects work on the original Star Wars trilogy <b>to</b> <b>explain</b> <b>why</b> <b>he</b> was an appropriate choice. Raiders of the Lost Ark was an influence on the film, because they hoped the film would not feel like a period piece.|$|E

50|$|The {{story begins}} with Karl's violent {{arrival in the}} Holy Land of AD 28, where his time machine, a womb-like, fluid-filled sphere, cracks open and becomes useless. By interpolating {{numerous}} memories and flashbacks, Moorcock tells the parallel story of Karl's troubled past in 20th century London, and tries <b>to</b> <b>explain</b> <b>why</b> <b>he's</b> willing <b>to</b> risk everything to meet Jesus. We learn that Karl has chronic problems with women, homosexual tendencies, {{an interest in the}} ideas of Jung, and many neuroses, including a messiah complex.|$|R
25|$|At {{the start}} of season three, another 90-minute {{retrospective}} aired in which Jessica says goodbye to Benson, using the flashback clips to try <b>to</b> <b>explain</b> <b>why</b> <b>he</b> should stay.

25|$|The two {{horsemen}} of {{this particular}} apocalypse—the external deficit and the swift rise of Central Bank credit—would have made 1988 a bad year no matter what else happened. But President García guaranteed financial disaster by his totally unexpected decision in July 1987 to nationalize the banks not already under government ownership. No one has yet been able <b>to</b> <b>explain</b> <b>why</b> <b>he</b> decided to do so. It would {{not seem to have}} been a move necessary for any component of his program, or needed for government control in a banking sector in which it already had a dominant position. In any case, the action underlined the unilateral character of economic policy action under Peru's presidential system and wrecked any possibilities of further cooperation with private sector leadership. Private investment began to fall, and the whole economy followed it down shortly thereafter.|$|E

25|$|On another {{modeling}} shoot, Erica has {{an accident}} and suffers injuries to her back. With the help of Dr. Jonathan Kinder, she becomes addicted to the medication she takes for her injury. Dimitri tries to warn her about Jonathan, but she will not listen, thus putting a strain on their marriage again. While {{under the influence of}} the increasingly higher doses of drugs Jonathan gives her, Erica has sex with him. Her dependence on her supplier grows until she finally has to admit she has an addiction and checks herself into the Betty Ford Center. Once she is out, Erica and Dimitri start finding their way back to each other. This does not sit well with Jonathan. The doctor drugs Erica and tricks Dimitri into thinking they are still sleeping together. After seeing his wife in bed with another man, Dimitri files for divorce and finds comfort with an equally as devastated Maria Santos Grey. Erica has no idea what Jonathan did or why Dimitri is angry with her. Dimitri shuts her out and refuses <b>to</b> <b>explain</b> <b>why</b> <b>he</b> divorced her. Erica does not find out what happened until she and her new friends Janet Green and Skye Chandler (each of whom was wronged by Kinder) corner Jonathan and he confesses. He gets the upper hand on the women and is about to assault Erica when Dimitri comes to her rescue. Jonathan is sent to prison.|$|E
25|$|J.T. and Colleen become {{embroiled in}} Lily Winters' (Christel Khalil) drama with {{internet}} predator Kevin Fisher (Greg Rikaart). They discourage Lily from being with him. After Lily engages in illegal intercourse with him, Colleen tells Lily's parents, Neil (Kristoff St. John) and Drucilla (Victoria Rowell). They have him arrested. In retaliation, Kevin attempts to murder Colleen by locking {{her in a}} freezer inside a burning building. J.T. rescues her and carries {{her out of the}} building. The couple moves on from the Kevin ordeal as J.T. begins to focus on his music career. This serves as a roadblock in their romance as Colleen becomes jealous of J.T.'s closeness with other girls in his music video. During a press conference, he also lies to a reporter about not having a girlfriend. Though he attempts <b>to</b> <b>explain</b> <b>why</b> <b>he</b> did that, Colleen decides to move back to New York to live with her mother so she will not be {{standing in the way of}} J.T.'s career. During her time away, he develops romantic feelings for his long-time friend Brittany, who plans to marry Bobby Marsino (John Enos III). Colleen returns to Genoa City briefly and J.T. deals with his feelings for both her and Brittany. She ultimately leaves town again and returns in 2006 intent on reuniting with J.T. However, he is dating Mackenzie Browning (then played by Rachel Kimsey) at the time. Colleen attempts to break them up. Ultimately, Mac's dependence on Kevin during her pregnancy and miscarriage, as well as J.T.'s cheating with Victoria Newman (Amelia Heinle), break the couple up. Not long after that, he and Colleen reunite.|$|E
500|$|As Mulberry Street is Geisel's first children's book, Donald Pease {{calls it}} [...] "the scene of origin {{for all of}} Dr. Seuss's children's books". After several books in prose, Geisel {{returned}} to verse for 1940's Horton Hatches the Egg, using the same [...] "galloping, rollicking, anapestic tetrameter rhyme scheme" [...] he had used for Mulberry Street.

500|$|The {{reception}} to {{the novel}} {{was so bad that}} Fleming wrote to Michael Howard at Jonathan Cape, <b>to</b> <b>explain</b> <b>why</b> <b>he</b> wrote the book: [...] "I had become increasingly surprised to find my thrillers, which were designed for an adult audience, being read in schools, and that young people were making a hero out of James Bond... So it crossed my mind to write a cautionary tale about Bond, to put the record straight in the minds particularly of younger readers... the experiment has obviously gone very much awry".|$|E
500|$|The law in Wales at {{that time}} {{permitted}} condemned men to atone for their crimes by making a payment to their victims. Cragh's friends and family rallied round to offer 100 cows to deBriouze for his release, but the offer was refused. The substantial scale of the proposed compensation indicates that Cragh was an important man, although some witnesses described him as a thief rather than a rebel. Historian Jussi Hanska has suggested that de Briouze's refusal to accept the offer strengthens the case for Cragh being a rebel, {{as there is no}} other convincing reason <b>to</b> <b>explain</b> <b>why</b> <b>he</b> should have opted to [...] "decline good income just to hang a thief".|$|E
500|$|As a result, Cho escaped {{compliance}} with the court order for mandatory mental health treatment as an outpatient, even though Virginia law required community services boards to [...] "recommend a specific course of treatment and programs" [...] for mental health patients and [...] "monitor the person's compliance."

50|$|As {{with other}} members of the UU faculty, the Librarian is {{referred}} to uniquely by his office and not by a name. If the Librarian's name were known, he could be changed back into a human, and he has since The Last Continent carefully excised his name from the records of the University. The Discworld Companion hints that he may once have been Dr. Horace Worblehat, which goes most of the way <b>to</b> <b>explaining</b> <b>why</b> <b>he</b> is happier as an orang-utan. The Art of Discworld confirms that the Librarian was indeed Dr. Horace Worblehat, and that his fears of turning back into human are baseless at most. Rincewind is apparently the only wizard who still remembers the Librarian's name, but he has agreed not to tell anyone, possibly because the Librarian is capable of bouncing the head of a man on the pavement when holding him by the ankle.|$|R

500|$|Meanwhile, Jim (John Krasinski) {{arrives at}} work wearing a tuxedo in {{response}} to a memo written by Dwight (Rainn Wilson), about [...] "professionalism in the workplace". This leads to an awkward first encounter with Charles as Jim has <b>to</b> <b>explain</b> <b>why</b> <b>he</b> wore a tuxedo. This does not amuse Charles, who seems to lack a sense of humor. Jim's activity throughout the day is scrutinized by Charles, more so when Charles notes Jim's idea of a [...] "two-way petting zoo" [...] for Michael's party. When Jim tries to smooth things over with Charles, Charles condescends to Jim, questioning the necessity of Jim's position as Assistant Regional Manager, referring to it as made-up. When Charles leaves, Jim tries to say goodbye, with no response. Jim jokes that his career could be over.|$|E
500|$|By then {{a teacher}} at the 1st School for Boys, on Română Street, Creangă was ordered out of his secular {{assignment}} in July 1872, when news of his status and attitude reached Education Minister Christian Tell. Upset by the circumstances, and objecting in writing on grounds that it did not refer to his teaching abilities, he fell back on income produced by a tobacconist's shop he had established shortly before being dismissed. This stage marked a final development in Creangă's conflict with the church hierarchy. Summoned <b>to</b> <b>explain</b> <b>why</b> <b>he</b> was living the life of a shopkeeper, he responded in writing by showing his unwillingness to apologize, and indicated that he would only agree to face secular courts. The virulent text notably accused the church officials of being his enemies on account of his [...] "independence, sincerity, honesty" [...] in supporting the cause of [...] "human dignity". After the gesture of defiance, the court recommended his defrocking, its decision being soon after confirmed by the synod.|$|E
500|$|Immediately {{the effects}} of the Hoover Dike were seen. An {{extended}} drought occurred in the 1930s; with the wall preventing water from leaving Lake Okeechobee and canals and ditches removing other water, the Everglades became parched. Peat turned to dust. Salt ocean water intruded into Miami's wells; when the city brought in an expert <b>to</b> <b>explain</b> <b>why,</b> <b>he</b> discovered that the water in the Everglades was the area's groundwater—here, it appeared on the surface. In 1939, a million acres (4,000km²) of Everglades burned, and the black clouds of peat and sawgrass fires hung over Miami. Scientists who took soil samples before draining did not take into account that the organic composition of peat and muck in the Everglades make it prone to soil subsidence when it becomes dry. Naturally occurring bacteria in Everglades peat and muck assist with the process of decomposition under water, which is generally very slow, partially due to the low levels of dissolved oxygen. When water levels became so low that peat and muck were at the surface, the bacteria interacted with much higher levels of oxygen in the air, rapidly breaking down the soil. In some places, homes had to be moved to stilts and [...] of soil was lost.|$|E

500|$|Although Howarth was {{familiar}} with campus fraternity life while attending George Washington University, he did not base Todd or his other roles on anyone he knew.

It's just as easy to pretend I'm a bad guy as it is to pretend I'm a good guy," [...] Howarth said. Playing a rapist was like playing any other role because [...] " [...] it's all make-believe". He was perplexed by writers' need to redeem villains. [...] "Todd's a pretty interesting character just the way he is," [...] Howarth said in late 1994. [...] "There's no need to fix it if it's not broken. I don't know where the whole notion of redeeming characters comes from. People used to say to me, 'I hope you get redeemed so you can stay on the show.' Well, Todd hasn't been redeemed, and he's still on the show."
