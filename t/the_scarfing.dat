40|$|<b>The</b> <b>scarfing</b> {{processing}} {{experiment was}} carried out for a steel slab moving at a constant speed with <b>the</b> <b>scarfing</b> torch fixed. The temperature histories inside the slab were recorded by two sets of thermocouples in different depths. A two-step computational model of heat transfer in scarfing processing has been developed in FLUENT. The model features in detail heat conduction from both the hot slag coating and <b>the</b> <b>scarfing</b> reaction to the steel slab surface, and it solves for steady state heat advection in the Step- 1 model followed by the Step- 2 model of transient heat transfer calculation. The combination of these two steps is able to give the complete prediction of a temperature history of 122. 2 sec. The temperature predictions agree well with the experimental measurements. The high temperature region (1100 oC ~ 1500 oC) {{is found to be}} mainly located in a depth of 0. 5 mm near the slab surface. The fraction of heat conducted from the hot slag coating into the slab is 5. 4 % while that from <b>the</b> <b>scarfing</b> reaction is 10. 3 %. The simulations clearly explain the measurements and suggest practical implications. Section II. Background Scarfing processing has been used widely to remove surface defects from steel and other semi-finished as-cast products for over 70 years. The first automated scarfing machine used in production was built and installed in 1935. Steel slabs produced from continuous casting often exhibit surface defects, including inclusions, pits and cracks, such as shown in Fig. 1. In order to obtain advanced high strength steels (AHSS) for automotive parts or other high-quality-products, these surface defects should be avoided during the casting process or removed during post-processing using <b>the</b> <b>scarfing</b> technique...|$|E
40|$|Lobe-forced mixer is one typical {{example of}} the passive flow {{controllers}} owing to its corrugated trailing edge. Besides the spanwise Kelvin–Helmholtz vortex shedding, streamwise vortices are also generated within its mixing layer. The geometrical configuration of the lobe significantly affects {{these two types of}} vortices, which in turn affects the mixing performance of the mixer. In the present investigation, characteristics of mixers with five different configurations were examined and evaluated for two velocity ratios (r = 1, 0. 4). The mixers have only one lobe in order to eliminate any possible interactions between neighboring vortices generated by the adjacent lobes. Hot-wire anemometer was used to examine the Kelvin–Helmholtz vortices via the spectrum analysis while laser Doppler anemometer was employed to examine the streamwise vortices. It was found that there were two main frequencies for the Kelvin–Helmholtz vortices {{in the wake of the}} mixer; and the Strouhal numbers approached their respective maximum values at high Reynolds number. The rectangular mixer had similar mixing performance with the semicircular one; and both of them were better than the triangular mixer. The scalloping modification enhanced mixing by generating additional streamwise vortices while <b>the</b> <b>scarfing</b> modification could not improve the mixing performance.

40|$|With the {{increasing}} number of composite applications in aircrafts, it is essential to supply repair concepts with respect to the material properties. In addition to the carbon fiber reinforced composites with a thermoset matrix system, other matrix systems like highperformance thermoplastics have been continuously gaining market share. In comparison to other matrix systems, highperformance thermoplastics have advantages like their ability to reshape and to weld after the first molding process. These advantages can be used to develop new repair concepts. The developing repair concept concentrates mainly on two steps between the detection of the damage and the post repair inspection. One of the steps is <b>the</b> <b>scarfing</b> out with the purpose to remove the damaged area. To simplify this step, the inclusion of a laser support to the repairing process was investigated. As a non-contact, thermal treatment, a UV Laser offers a ply-by-ply removal and can generate a precise stepped-lap repair geometry. With the help of these new possibilities, a load path conforming repair geometry can be developed. Another important step is the application of the repair patch by heating up the interface zone between the patch and the undamaged area. The necessary heat can be generated with the help of inductive heated metallic sheet. The results of the investigations regarding the laser support and the inductive heating will be presented in this paper...|$|E

40|$|SummaryIntroductionScarf osteotomies of {{the first}} {{metatarsal}} and metatarsophalangeal arthrodesis {{are the two most}} frequent surgical forefoot reconstructive procedures. HypothesisWe compared functional results of isolated arthrodesis {{of the first}} metatarsophalangeal joint with an isolated <b>Scarf</b> osteotomy of <b>the</b> first metatarsal. Materials and methodsThis was a retrospective, observational, continuous study of patients operated between 1993 and 2008. After patients who had undergone a procedure on the lateral rays, extremely elderly patients, lost to follow-up patients and those with incomplete questionnaires had been excluded, there remained two comparable groups of 25  patients. Mean age was 60 in the arthrodesis group [41 – 70] and 59. 8 in <b>the</b> <b>Scarf</b> group [47 – 71]. <b>The</b> <b>Scarf</b> group included 25 hallux valgus (100 %) compared to 16 hallux valgus (64 %) and nine hallux rigidus (36 %) in the arthrodesis group. Complications were recorded. Evaluation of functional results was based on the most recent functional or quality of life scores (AOFAS, FFI, FAAM, SF 36) and a questionnaire on physical and athletic ability. ResultsThere {{was no significant difference in}} the rate of complications between the two groups. There was no difference in pain according to the AOFAS score with 35. 6 / 40 (± 6. 5) in <b>the</b> <b>Scarf</b> group and 34. 5 (± 5. 9) in the arthrodesis group. Global satisfaction was also similar between <b>the</b> <b>Scarf</b> and arthrodesis groups: 91. 4 % and 90 % of very satisfied or satisfied patients, respectively. The FFI score was higher in <b>the</b> <b>Scarf</b> group than in the arthrodesis group: 8. 6 (± 20. 1) and 19. 8 (± 17. 7) respectively. Functional results were better in <b>the</b> <b>Scarf</b> group than in the arthrodesis group with a FAAM Daily Activity score of 80. 2 (± 12. 1) compared to 68 (± 7. 2), a FAAM Sports Activity score of 29. 7 (± 6. 7) compared to 25. 2 (± 7. 6) and a FAAM Global Function score of 94 % (± 10. 8) compared to 87 % (± 15. 7), respectively. The Global SF 36 score was higher in <b>the</b> <b>Scarf</b> group than in the arthrodesis group: 70. 9 % (± 14. 1) and 62. 3 % (± 20. 6) respectively, which was due to a higher Mental Health score in <b>the</b> <b>Scarf</b> group: 68. 7 % (± 14. 2) and 60. 4 % (± 19. 3) respectively. In the area of sports activities <b>the</b> <b>Scarf</b> group practiced more hiking than the arthrodesis group (74 % versus 42 % respectively). There was no difference for other activities.
