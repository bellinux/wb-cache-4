They are not prone to {{fighting}} but {{have been known to}} chase small pets, due to their sighthound nature. They also have a tendency <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>up</b> <b>on</b> furniture. Whippets are touch sensitive, meaning that they tend to jump or overreact when touched unexpectedly.|$|E

Go-go dancing originated in the early 1960s, by some accounts when women at the Peppermint Lounge in New York City began <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>up</b> <b>on</b> tables and dance the twist. Other accounts claim that go-go dancing originated at, and was named for, the very popular South L.A. rock club Whiskey A Go Go which opened in January 1964. Many 1960s-era clubgoers wore miniskirts and knee-high, high-heeled boots, which eventually came to be called go-go boots, to night clubs.|$|E
2500|$|Minton's Playhouse {{became so}} popular {{in those days}} that the house band began to develop ways of weeding out the musicians who couldn't play that wanted to sit in.

2500|$|Vinnie Roe made {{a winning}} debut in a maiden race at Leopardstown in June, staying on {{strongly}} <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>up</b> <b>on</b> {{the line and}} beat the filly Affianced by a head.

2500|$|Day ten {{brought the}} lightest winds {{seen in the}} 34th America's Cup. The start of the first race was pushed back by five minutes, due {{to the need to}} shift one of the marks on the start line. Oracle had the better start in the [...] winds, and luffed Team New Zealand at the reach mark. The first {{downward}} leg was very {{different from the rest of}} the racing, as neither boat was able <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>up</b> <b>on</b> its foils. Aotearoa appeared to be the stronger boat in the light breeze, and rounded the leeward gate 1:42 ahead of the Americans. The Kiwi boat continued to extend their lead during the third leg and the main concern turned to whether they would be able to cross the finish line within the 40 minute race limit. Unfortunately for them, despite being ahead by more than 1,000 metres in winds of between [...] near the end of the fourth leg, with 90% of the race complete, the time expired forcing the abandonment of the race.|$|E
