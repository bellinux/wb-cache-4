5|$|The folly and {{absurdity of}} the Queen in {{allowing}} this trumpery must strike every sensible and well-thinking mind, and I am astonished the ministers <b>themselves</b> <b>do</b> not insist on her at least going to Osborne during the Exhibition, as no human being can possibly answer for what may {{occur on the}} occasion. The idea... must shock every honest and well-meaning Englishman. But it seems everything is conspiring to lower us {{in the eyes of}} Europe.|$|E
5|$|To {{deal with}} embrittlement, the entire target chamber was {{designed}} to be easily rolled out of the center of the building on rails to the maintenance building where it could be rebuilt. The chamber was expected to last four years, and be replaced in one month. The optical system is decoupled from the chamber, which isolates it from vibrations during operation and means that the beamlines <b>themselves</b> <b>do</b> not have to be realigned after chamber replacement.|$|E

25|$|Nausea and {{vomiting}} caused by tramadol {{is thought to}} be due to activation of the 5-HT3 receptor via increased serotonin levels. In accordance, the 5-HT3 receptor antagonist metoclopramide can be used to treat tramadol-associated nausea {{and vomiting}}. Tramadol and desmetramadol <b>themselves</b> <b>do</b> not bind to the 5-HT3 receptor.|$|E
25|$|Capsaicin {{is present}} in large {{quantities}} in the placental tissue (which holds the seeds), the internal membranes, {{and to a lesser}} extent, the other fleshy parts of the fruits of plants in this genus. The seeds <b>themselves</b> <b>do</b> not produce any capsaicin, although the highest concentration of capsaicin {{can be found in the}} white pith around the seeds.|$|E

25|$|Heterokont chloroplasts {{appear to}} derive from those of red algae, rather than {{directly}} from prokaryotes as occurred in plants. This suggests they had a more recent origin than many other algae. However, fossil evidence is scant, and only with {{the evolution of the}} diatoms <b>themselves</b> <b>do</b> the heterokonts make a serious impression on the fossil record.|$|E
25|$|Many ethnic Russians emigrated back to Russia, which {{contributed to}} their decline in the 2000s, The {{demographics}} of ethnic Russians <b>themselves</b> <b>do</b> not differ significantly {{from that of the}} Russian Federation. Ethnic Russians as a whole have a higher Fertility rate than that of Latvians, The fertility rate rise correlates to the increase of the TFR of Russia.|$|E
25|$|Likewise, the campsites {{are rather}} {{different}} {{between the two}} wilderness areas. Boundary Waters' campsites have designated fire grates in the fire ring and a small fiberglass latrine. Quetico's campsites are far less used than BWCAW and many are not marked on maps. The sites <b>themselves</b> <b>do</b> not have a latrine (participants must dig a cat-hole at least 150 feet away from water and camp) nor {{do they have a}} fire grate.|$|E

25|$|Rare {{variations}} are {{not classified}} as polymorphisms, and mutations by <b>themselves</b> <b>do</b> not constitute polymorphisms. To {{qualify as a}} polymorphism, some kind of balance must exist between morphs underpinned by inheritance. The criterion is that {{the frequency of the}} least common morph is too high simply {{to be the result of}} new mutations or, as a rough guide, that it is greater than 1% (though that is far higher than any normal mutation rate for a single allele).|$|E
25|$|Concerning the {{lifespan}} of drones and Minds, {{given the}} durability of Culture technology and the aforementioned options of mindstate backups, {{it is reasonable to}} assume that they live as long as they choose. Even Minds, with their utmost complexity, are known to be backed up (and reactivated if they for example die in a risky mission, see GSV Lasting Damage). It is noted that even Minds <b>themselves</b> <b>do</b> not necessarily live forever either, often choosing to eventually sublime or even committing suicide (as does the double-Mind GSV Lasting Damage due to its choices in the Culture-Idiran war).|$|E
25|$|This {{ethnic group}} label {{has been used}} by other Malagasy and foreigners to {{describe}} the people who traditionally inhabited the southwestern coast of Madagascar, bounded inland by the Menarandra and Onilahy rivers. The people <b>themselves</b> <b>do</b> not use this label or identify as part of a single ethnic group, however, and prefer to identify along other kinship or geopolitical lines; the name Mahafaly holds no meaning for the people originating from this area and instead is a label imposed from the outside. The majority of the population is concentrated {{along the banks of the}} rivers that run through the otherwise largely arid territory.|$|E

25|$|Some hidden {{headlamps}} <b>themselves</b> <b>do</b> not move, {{but rather}} are covered {{when not in}} use by panels designed to blend in with the car's styling. When the lamps are switched on, the covers are swung out of the way, usually downward or upward, for example on the 1992 Jaguar XJ220. The door mechanism may be actuated by vacuum pots, as on some Ford vehicles of the late 1960s through early 1980s such as the 1967–1970 Mercury Cougar, or by an electric motor as on various Chrysler products of the middle 1960s through late 1970s such as the 1966–1967 Dodge Charger.|$|E
25|$|In November 1998, Earache Records {{released}} Who Dares Wins, {{a compilation}} featuring various older recordings, including the Spearhead and Cenotaph EPs. The band members <b>themselves</b> <b>do</b> {{not approve of}} the compilation's release and warn not to buy it, considering it a cheap cash-in from Earache. Originally, it was titled No Guts - No Glory but the title was changed because one song on Mercenary has the same title and Metal Blade objected. Following the release of Mercenary, the band embarked {{on a tour of}} Europe, called Into the Killing Zone, with Dave Ingram on vocals. Alex Thomas departed since he lacked interest in the musical direction of Bolt Thrower.|$|E
25|$|The seeds <b>themselves</b> <b>do</b> {{not contain}} {{significant}} amounts of opiates. But a poppy tea consumed in some areas and {{often referred to as}} doda has been controversial for containing ground opium poppy plant, especially the seed head, and contains significant levels of opiates. Popular in some South Asian communities, doda is created by grinding dried poppy husks or poppy seeds into a fine powder and then ingesting the mix with hot water or tea. In Canada, doda is made from poppy plants brought in from Afghanistan and Arizona under the guise of legal purposes such as floral arrangements, but is sold illegally from some meat markets.|$|E

25|$|An {{alternative}} view, {{from the}} world of the Semantic Web focuses instead on making all things (not just those electronic, smart, or RFID-enabled) addressable by the existing naming protocols, such as URI. The objects <b>themselves</b> <b>do</b> not converse, but they may now be referred to by other agents, such as powerful centralized servers acting for their human owners.Integration with the Internet implies that devices will use an IP address as a unique identifier. Due to the limited address space of IPv4 (which allows for 4.3 billion unique addresses), objects in the IoT will have to use the next generation of the Internet protocol (IPv6) to scale to the extremely large address space required.|$|E
25|$|Regulation of adrenarche and its {{relationship}} to maturation of the hypothalamic-gonadal axis is not fully understood, and some evidence suggests it is a parallel but largely independent process coincident with or even preceding central puberty. Rising levels of adrenal androgens (termed adrenarche) can usually be detected between 6 and 11 years of age, even before the increasing gonadotropin pulses of hypothalamic puberty. Adrenal androgens {{contribute to the development of}} pubic hair (pubarche), adult body odor, and other androgenic changes in both sexes. The primary clinical significance of the distinction between adrenarche and gonadarche is that pubic hair and body odor changes by <b>themselves</b> <b>do</b> not prove that central puberty is underway for an individual child.|$|E
25|$|Two points x and y are {{separated}} if {{each of them}} has a neighbourhood {{that is not a}} neighbourhood of the other; that is, neither belongs to the other's closure. More generally, two subsets A and B of X {{are separated}} if each is disjoint from the other's closure. (The closures <b>themselves</b> <b>do</b> not have to be disjoint.) All of the remaining conditions for separation of sets may also be applied to points (or to a point and a set) by using singleton sets. Points x and y will be considered separated, by neighbourhoods, by closed neighbourhoods, by a continuous function, precisely by a function, if and only if their singleton sets {x} and {y} are separated according to the corresponding criterion.|$|E
