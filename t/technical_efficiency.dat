40|$|This paper {{tests the}} impact of risk and {{competition}} on efficiency in the Chinese banking industry over the period 2003 - 2013. Comprehensive types of risk-taking behaviour are considered including credit risk, liquidity risk, capital risk, and insolvency risk. Competition {{is measured by the}} Lerner index. The results are cross-checked using an alternative econometric technique as well as an alternative competition indicator. The findings show that the technical and pure <b>technical</b> <b>efficiencies</b> of Chinese commercial banks are significantly and negatively affected by liquidity risk. They further show that greater competition precedes declines in technical and pure <b>technical</b> <b>efficiencies</b> of Chinese commercial banks. The results suggest that Chinese bank efficiency is significantly affected by bank diversification, banking sector development, stock market development, inflation and GDP growth rate. The findings also indicate that, compared to state-owned commercial banks, joint-stock commercial banks and city commercial banks have lower technical and pure <b>technical</b> <b>efficiencies...</b>|$|R

500|$|Russell then {{inquires}} {{into the}} power that reason has over a community, as contrasted with fanaticism. It {{would seem that the}} power of reason is that it is able to increase the odds of success in practical matters by way of <b>technical</b> <b>efficiency.</b> The cost of allowing for reasoned inquiry is the tolerance of intellectual disagreement, which in turn provokes scepticism and dims the power of fanaticism. Conversely, it would seem that a community is stronger and more cohesive if there is widespread agreement within it over certain creeds, and reasoned debate is rare. If these two opposing conditions are both to be fully exploited for short-term gains, then it would demand two things: first, that some creed be held both by the majority opinion (through force and propaganda), and second, that the majority of intellectual class concurs (through reasoned discussion). In the long-term, however, creeds tend to provoke weariness, light scepticism, outright disbelief, and finally, apathy. (Russell 1938:123–125) ...|$|E

40|$|This {{study was}} carried out to analyze the {{comparative}} analysis of efficiencies of artisanal fisheries in Ijebu Waterside of Ogun State. The objectives determined gross margin analysis; estimate the <b>technical</b> <b>efficiencies</b> of both the manually propelled technology (MPT) and motorized technology (MT) of artisanal fishery systems and determining the factors influencing the <b>technical</b> <b>efficiencies</b> of artisanal fisheries in the study area. A multistage sampling technique was used to select a total of 400 Artisans from the study area. Primary data were collected using structured questionnaire as interview guide, on the socio-economic characteristics, production inputs and output prices.

Stochastic production frontier model was used to estimate the <b>technical,</b> <b>efficiencies</b> of both motorized and manually propelled technologies in artisanal fishery system {{as well as the}} factors influencing the <b>technical,</b> <b>efficiencies</b> of the artisans. The results of the comparison of the MPT and (MT) revealed that the average income per month for MPT was N 361, 847. 48 and the amount accruable per month for the MT was N 560, 755. 57. The results of the comparison of catch efficiency and inefficiency function showed that in MPT, fishing gear, vessel length, number of crew/skippers, quantity of bait and battery were all significant at 5 percent probability level while for MT, fishing gear, outboard engine, battery and miscellaneous quantity were the significant factors. The mean catch efficiency of MPT was 0. 92 compared to MT with 0. 98. However, the comparison of the inefficiency shows that education, age, and household size are significant factors while education is significant factors in both MPT and MT respectively.

2500|$|The trouble though is, {{that this}} productive/unproductive {{distinction}} {{is not easily}} made in practice, given changes in the market, in social-organizational efficiency, and in production techniques, {{and it does not}} necessarily {{have anything to do with}} whether a worker produces something tangible or not. What looks like an efficiency gain from [...] "weeding out" [...] seemingly unproductive activity may in fact not be an efficiency gain in total, or it may be very difficult to prove that it is. If fewer workers are made to do more work, intensifying labor, then accidents, illness or errors may increase. In the real world, <b>technical</b> <b>efficiency</b> and financial efficiency are not necessarily the same thing at all. Hence there is continual debate in management theory about these issues, with few [...] "general" [...] answers being available, since much depends on the specific organizational technique of enterprises. The only [...] "general" [...] answer there is, is to recast the accounting for every detailed activity that workers perform as a statistically observable input-output relationship which results in a [...] "product", even if the [...] "product" [...] is no real product at all, but some kind of service or performance result. By describing a labor-service or a task performance as a product, it seems identifiably productive, although substantively it may not create any new product. In Marxist theory, this is called the [...] "commodification of services": each specific service is accounted for as a specific alienable product with a certain price tag, and managed accordingly. Eventually, many services which have to be performed by trained staff are replaced by mass-produced things, because that is more profitable and cheaper to buy. For example, a teacher is replaced with an instruction video.|$|E

60|$|The {{methods and}} traditions of British {{politics}} maintain the form of two great parties, with rider groups seeking to gain specific ends {{in the event of}} a small Government majority. These two main parties are more or less heterogeneous in composition. Each, however, has certain necessary characteristics. The Conservative Party has always stood quite definitely for the established propertied interests. The land-owner, the big lawyer, the Established Church, and latterly the huge private monopoly of the liquor trade which has been created by temperance legislation, are the essential Conservatives. Interwoven now with the native wealthy are the families of the great international usurers, and a vast miscellaneous mass of financial enterprise. Outside the range of resistance implied by these interests, the Conservative Party has always shown itself just as constructive and collectivist as any other party. The great landowners have been as well-disposed towards the endowment of higher education, and as willing to co-operate with the Church in protective and mildly educational legislation for children and the working class, as any political section. The financiers, too, are adventurous-spirited and eager for mechanical progress and <b>technical</b> <b>efficiency.</b> They are prepared to spend public money upon research, upon ports and harbours and public communications, upon sanitation and hygienic organisation. A certain rude benevolence of public intention is equally characteristic of the liquor trade. Provided his comfort leads to no excesses of temperance, the liquor trade is quite eager to see the common man prosperous, happy, and with money to spend in a bar. All sections of the party are aggressively patriotic and favourably inclined to the idea of an upstanding, well-fed, and well-exercised population in uniform. Of course there are reactionary landowners and old-fashioned country clergy, full of localised self-importance, jealous even of the cottager who can read, but they have neither the power nor the ability to retard the constructive forces in the party as a whole. On the other hand, when matters point to any definitely confiscatory proposal, to the public ownership and collective control of land, for example, or state mining and manufactures, or the nationalisation of the so-called public-house or extended municipal enterprise, or even to an increase of the taxation of property, then the Conservative Party presents a nearly adamantine bar. It does not stand for, it IS, the existing arrangement in these affairs.|$|E

30|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to measure the TFEE as input {{efficiency}} using the SFA metafrontier framework and to apply it to Japanese regions. In order to take into account of technology difference of multiple groups, in this paper, we incorporate the metafrontier technique into the model of Honma and Hu (2014 a). In contrast to Huang et al. (2014) that take the output-oriented <b>technical</b> <b>efficiencies,</b> we adopt the TFEE as an input-oriented efficiency measure to shed light on energy use. For this purpose, we classified Japanese 47 prefectures into two groups whether a region has at least a designated city, which has many functions normally performed by a prefectural government. The group TFEE for a DMU is measured among DMUs using the same technology to that DMU. The TGR is measured among all DMUs using the ideal energy consumption which is the real energy consumption multiplied by the group frontier TFEE of that DMU. While the former estimates the within-group <b>technical</b> <b>efficiencies,</b> the latter captures the technology gap on the basis of a distance between the metafrontier and the group frontier. The metafrontier TFEE is defined as a product of the group TFEE and the TGR.|$|R
40|$|Biological {{diversity}} {{is known to}} play an important role in generating and maintaining ecosystem productivity and other functions, and has consequently become a central focus of many efforts to preserve ecosystem services. Theoretical parallels suggest the diversity of fishing fleets may have a similarly important role in determining the productivity and ecological impacts of fisheries, but this possibility has rarely been explored. Here I present theoretical analyses showing that the diversity of métiers - combinations of technology, target species, and fishing grounds - and <b>technical</b> <b>efficiencies</b> in a fishing fleet have important impacts on the productivity, profitability, and ecological impacts of fisheries, particularly mixed-stock or multispecies fisheries. Diversification of métiers can increase yields and reduce threats to weak stocks in both managed and unmanaged multispecies fisheries. Diversification of <b>technical</b> <b>efficiencies</b> creates opportunities for larger profits in managed fisheries, but often decreases yields and worsens impacts on weak stocks in unmanaged fisheries. These results suggest that the potential impact of management may be highest in fisheries with diverse fleets.
