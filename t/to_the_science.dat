5|$|Expedition to the Barrier Peaks is a 1980 {{adventure}} module for the Dungeons & Dragons role-playing game {{written by}} Gary Gygax.

It {{takes place on}} a downed spaceship; the ship's crew has died of an unspecified disease, but functioning robots and strange creatures still inhabit the ship. The player characters fight monsters and robots, and gather the futuristic weapons and colored access cards that are necessary for advancing the story.|$|E

5|$|Expedition to the Barrier Peaks {{was first}} {{played at the}} Origins II {{convention}} in 1976, where {{it was used to}} introduce Dungeons & Dragons players <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>science</b> fiction game Metamorphosis Alpha. In 1980, TSR published the adventure, updated for first edition Advanced Dungeons & Dragons rules. The adventure was not updated for later rules systems, but a Wizards.com article did provide a conversion to Future Tech. It included a separate booklet of illustrations, in both color and black and white. The adventure is an old-time favorite of many Dungeons & Dragons fans, including Stephen Colbert. It was ranked the fifth-best Dungeons & Dragons adventure of all time by Dungeon magazine in 2004, and received positive reviews from White Dwarf and The Space Gamer magazines. The other adventures in the S series include S1 Tomb of Horrors, S2 White Plume Mountain, and S4 Lost Caverns of Tsojcanth.|$|E
5|$|Galileo made {{original}} contributions <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>science</b> {{of motion}} through an innovative combination of experiment and mathematics. More typical {{of science at}} the time were the qualitative studies of William Gilbert, on magnetism and electricity. Galileo's father, Vincenzo Galilei, a lutenist and music theorist, had performed experiments establishing perhaps the oldest known non-linear relation in physics: for a stretched string, the pitch varies as the square root of the tension. These observations lay {{within the framework of the}} Pythagorean tradition of music, well-known to instrument makers, which included the fact that subdividing a string by a whole number produces a harmonious scale. Thus, a limited amount of mathematics had long related music and physical science, and young Galileo could see his own father's observations expand on that tradition.|$|E

5|$|In {{addition}} to his duties as a professional herald, Brooke-Little held three administrative positions at the College of Arms. From 1974 until 1982, he served as Registrar, with responsibility to enter all new grants and confirmations of arms into the College records. Brooke-Little's signature {{can be found on}} the reverse of the letters patent for every grant made during this period. In addition, he served as the College's librarian from 1974 until 1994 and the treasurer of the College of Arms from 1978 until 1995. He was also the director of the Heralds' Museum at the Tower of London from 1991 to 1997; this museum is no longer operating. Although Brooke-Little enjoyed prominence as a professional officer of arms and as an author on heraldic subjects, his role in founding the Heraldry Society, and in guiding the society and editing its journal for many years, was perhaps his greatest contribution <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>science</b> of heraldry.|$|E

Concerned about her financial situation, her old friend William Buckland persuaded the British Association for the Advancement of Science and the British government to award her an annuity, known as a civil list pension, in return for her many contributions <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>science</b> of geology.

5|$|The New Hospital for Women {{moved to}} No.144 Euston Road in 1888, and was rebuilt by J.M. Brydon two years later.

The Euston Road premises closed in 1993, its services transferred to University College Hospital. The current hospital is at No.235. The Wellcome Trust, a private medical research charity, was established in 1936 and has premises at No.183 and No.210 Euston Road. Its library holds about half a million books, including more than 6,000 Sanskrit manuscripts and the largest collection of Hindi and Punjabi medical documents in Europe.
