5|$|According to the {{government}} of Tamaulipas, most of the damage in the state was in farmland and in residents' dwellings, primarily near Matamoros, Valle Hermoso, Reynosa and San Fernando. In Matamoros, part of the city lost power and running water; in Valle Hermoso, two schools were damaged; in Reynosa, 180people were evacuated from low-lying areas in five districts of the city, while in San Fernando, <b>the</b> <b>main</b> <b>highway</b> through the city was closed, and traffic on the bridge over the Conchos River was restricted to one lane.|$|E
50|$|In June 1931, the Railway Department {{informed}} <b>the</b> <b>Main</b> <b>Highways</b> Board that {{it would}} increase the charges for the Rakaia Bridge.

Some months later, negotiations were started for <b>the</b> <b>Main</b> <b>Highways</b> Board to buy the existing bridge for it to become an exclusive road bridge. Meanwhile, the Railway Department desired a new bridge as trains were getting heavier.|$|R

5|$|Kingston Road was {{formerly}} Ontario Highway 2, and was <b>the</b> <b>main</b> <b>highway</b> through Scarborough until {{the building of}} the Highway 401, which runs east-west across the middle of Scarborough, with six to eight lanes in each direction. The short, minor freeway Highway 2A runs parallel to Lake Ontario {{in the eastern part of}} Scarborough. In the 1960s, Metropolitan Toronto planned to build a second east-west highway across Scarborough. It was intended to link Highway 2A with an eastern extension of the Gardiner Expressway. The highway, known as the Scarborough Expressway, was cancelled due to public opposition.|$|E
5|$|M-130 was the {{designation}} of a former state trunkline highway in the southeastern corner of the US state of Michigan. It ran from a junction with US Highway23/M-50 (US23/M-50) northward across the River Raisin and then turned southeasterly along North Custer Road {{on the north side}} of the river to Monroe. The highway designation was commissioned in 1929 and used until 1955. M-130 had a spur route that was created in 1938 and lasted until <b>the</b> <b>main</b> <b>highway</b> was removed from the state highway system. Both highways are now under local control.|$|E

The highway ended at the State Ferry Docks on the southeast side of the city next to the Coast Guard station.|$|E
5|$|The Friends of Richmond Park (FRP) {{was founded}} in 1961 to protect the park.

In 1969, plans by the then Greater London Council to assign the park's roads to the national highway were revealed by the Friends and subsequently withdrawn.

5|$|US41 {{was first}} {{designated}} as a US Highway in 1926. A section of the highway originally served as part of Military Road, a connection between Fort Wilkins and Fort Howard during the Civil War. US41 replaced the original M-15 designation of the highway which dated back {{to the formation of}} the Michigan state trunkline highway system. M-15 ran from Menominee through Marquette to Houghton and ended in Copper Harbor. Realignments and construction projects have expanded the highway to four lanes in Delta and Marquette counties and have created three business loops off <b>the</b> <b>main</b> <b>highway.</b>|$|E

5|$|Between Lake Michigan Beach and the {{northern}} terminus south of Mackinaw City, most of US31 forms {{a portion of the}} Lake Michigan Circle Tour (LMCT) except where the various business loops run between <b>the</b> <b>main</b> <b>highway</b> and Lake Michigan. Additionally, much of the highway from the Indiana–Michigan state line to Ludington is built to freeway standards. Two notable exceptions are a short segment along Napier Avenue between the St. Joseph Valley Parkway and I-94 near Benton Harbor, and between Holland and Ferrysburg. The remainder of US31 is a two- or four-lane highway with some sections in cities comprising five lanes. The entire length of the highway is listed on the National Highway System, a network of roads important to the US's economy, defense, and mobility.|$|E
5|$|Business U.S. Highway 8 (Bus. US8) in Rhinelander, Wisconsin, was {{a locally}} {{maintained}} business loop highway routing through the {{central business district}} of the city.

The local authorities erected signs along this route to designate it as a business loop of <b>the</b> <b>main</b> <b>highway</b> south of town.
