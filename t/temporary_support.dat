25|$|The {{simplest}} kind of vault is {{the barrel}} vault (also called a wagon or tunnel vault), {{which is generally}} semicircular in shape. The barrel vault is a continuous arch, the length being greater than its diameter. As in building an arch, a <b>temporary</b> <b>support</b> is needed while rings of voussoirs are constructed and the rings placed in position. Until the topmost voussoir, the keystone, is positioned, the vault is not self-supporting. Where timber is easily obtained, this <b>temporary</b> <b>support</b> is provided by centering consisting of a framed truss with a semicircular or segmental head, which supports the voussoirs until the ring of the whole arch is completed. With a barrel vault, the centering can then be shifted on to support the next rings.|$|E

25|$|The {{driving force}} behind the {{development}} of bioresorbable metals is primarily due to their ability to provide metal-like mechanical properties while degrading safely in the body. This is especially relevant in orthopaedic applications, where although many surgeries only require implants to provide <b>temporary</b> <b>support</b> (allowing the surrounding tissue to heal), the majority of current bio-metals are permanent (e.g. stainless steel, titanium). Degradation of the implant means that intervention or secondary surgery will not be necessary to remove the material {{at the end of its}} functional life, providing significant savings in both cost and time for the patient and health care system. In addition, the corrosion products of current bio-metals (which will still corrode in the body to some degree) can generally not be considered biocompatible.|$|E

500|$|Construction on the Brookville Tunnel, or the [...] "middle" [...] or [...] "second tunnel" [...] as it {{was then}} called, was begun {{sometime}} between 1849 and 1851. [...] The earth encountered at Brookville was of a much weaker quality than at the Greenwood Tunnel, rendering the digging of the tunnel both an extremely dangerous and difficult task. [...] Although the eastern section of the ridge was composed of firm and sturdy rock, the majority of the tunnel passed through a mixture of frail slate that was formed at a steep angle, soapstone, and clay. [...] When exposed to air, this mixture would often disintegrate causing large amounts of earth to fall into the tunnel bore. On two occasions during the tunnel's construction, though great care was taken to provide <b>temporary</b> <b>support,</b> major cave-ins occurred forming craters on top of the ridge, as much as [...] above the tunnel. [...] Another slide occurred {{on the outside of the}} western portal that blocked the entrance to the tunnel and prevented workers from repairing the damage from the two internal cave-ins.

In order to fill this gap, this paper deals with the effects in service of the staggered erection of steel cable-stayed bridges built on <b>temporary</b> <b>supports.</b> To do so, a criterion based on the minimization of the bending energy in terms of stay forces is applied to several cable-stayed bridges.

2500|$|Modern {{knowledge}} {{of the effect of}} earthquakes on structures led to a program to retrofit the Golden Gate to better resist seismic events. The proximity of the bridge to the San Andreas Fault places it at risk for a significant earthquake. Once thought {{to have been able to}} withstand any magnitude of foreseeable earthquake, the bridge was actually vulnerable to complete structural failure (i.e., collapse) triggered by the failure of supports on the [...] arch over Fort Point. A $392million program was initiated to improve the structure's ability to withstand such an event with only minimal (repairable) damage. One challenging undertaking is completing this program without disrupting traffic. A complex electro-hydraulic synchronous lift system was custom built for construction of <b>temporary</b> <b>support</b> towers and a series of intricate lifts, transferring the loads from the existing bridge onto the temporary supports.
