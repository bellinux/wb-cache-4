40|$|Research was {{developed}} in the period 1970 - 1995, within long-term stationary experiments, on cambic chernozem at the Research Institute for Cereals and Industrial Crops of Fundulea. Continuous classical tillage was compared with periodical alternation with surface disk harrow tillage, as well as with other works of soil breaking up with tools without furrow <b>turning</b> (<b>chisel,</b> paraplow). In wheat, yield was not significantly affected by soil tillage method, thus ensuring high fuel savings by temporary ploughing elimination. Surface tillage by disking produced a significant yield decrease in maize, due to increased soil compaction and weed infestation of the crop. Rationalization of ground tillage for wheat and maize crops could be achieved within an adequate crop rotation, in which the land may be prepared for wheat by disking or chiseling and for maize by deeper ploughing. Key words: bulk density, fuel consumption, ground tillage...|$|E

Self-excited vibrations can arise due to repeated cutting {{of the same}} surface, that lead to instability. A flexible multibody system model {{of the system is}} the basis for a subsequent analysis of the stability of the process. Stability analysis is done using an approximation as a time-discrete system via the semi-discretization method. An adaptronic <b>turning</b> <b>chisel</b> comprising a piezo actuator and sensors is then used in combination with different control concepts to improve the stability of the process. The effectiveness of the different strategies is compared based on the influence on the stability charts. A classic H∞ controller based on a model of the coupled system of workpiece and tool can only yield some improvements, when an additional measurement of the workpiece displacement is added. Incorporating knowledge on the cutting process coupling workpiece and tool using a gain scheduled H∞ controller allows further improvements. However, robustness with respect to model uncertainties, notably concerning the force law, remains an issue...|$|E
5000|$|The {{earliest}} screws {{tended to}} be made of wood, and they were whittled by hand, with or without the help of turning on a lathe with hand-controlled <b>turning</b> tools (<b>chisels,</b> knives, gouges), as accurately as the whittler could manage. It is likely that sometimes the wood blanks that they started from were tree branches (or juvenile trunks) that had been shaped by a vine wrapped helically around them while they grew. (In fact, various Romance words for [...] "screw" [...] come from the word root referring to vines.) Walking sticks twisted by vines show how suggestive such sticks are of a screw.|$|R
6000|$|He {{was very}} thoughtful. Leaning on the balustrade, {{he looked out}} across the sunlit valley, <b>turning</b> his boldly <b>chiselled</b> profile to his companion. At last he spoke slowly, reflectively: [...] "But if this were really so--a mere blunder--I see no {{sufficient}} grounds to threaten him with capital punishment. His subsequent desertion, if he has deserted--I mean if nothing has happened to him--is really the graver matter of the two." ...|$|R
5000|$|Cold Chisel's debut self-titled {{album in}} 1978 had been {{produced}} by Peter Walker. For their second album, Breakfast at Sweethearts, the record company, Elektra Records, {{decided to use}} a more experienced producer. Batchens was chosen due to his work with Sherbet and Clapton. According to Australian journalist, Ed Nimmervoll, Batchens [...] "was not all that keen on the band's individual performances {{in the studio and}} made them do things over and over". Although [...] "he smoothed out the rough edges", however he [...] "lost some of the life". Meanwhile, [...] "the more sophisticated approach tended to highlight the quality of the songs". Nimmervoll noted that the [...] "band had their reservations, but they were reasonably happy with the results". Breakfast at Sweethearts proved to be their commercial breakthrough, <b>turning</b> Cold <b>Chisel</b> into platinum selling superstars. After attempting to record a follow-up single with Batchens, Cold Chisel decided to record their next album, East (1980), with Mark Opitz producing.|$|R
5000|$|The {{cotton press}} was built around 1798 for baling ginned cotton. It is {{constructed}} of pegged and doweled oak. It has a 16 in diameter oak screw that was hand <b>chiseled.</b> <b>Turning</b> the screw compressed cotton into a wooden frame {{to form a}} bale. The press has a small rectangular, shingled hip roof to protect the machinery from the weather. Four beams forming a pyramidal frame support the screw. Two long shingled booms that are hinged to the screw extend out from the machine. These booms or poles have been called [...] "buzzard wings." [...] Mules or oxen were used to rotate the screw. The cotton press was either built by or for Stephen Berry or [...] "Buck Swamp" [...] John Bethea.|$|R
40|$|Ancient Japanese texts {{inform us}} that many Korean Buddhist statuettes were {{introduced}} into the archipelago in the VIth century. These testimonies {{are more or less}} trustworthy, but the works themselves have disappeared. If one can accept the fact that Koreans coming to settle in Japan brought images of the Buddha from their country, or that Japanese brought back such images from the peninsula, it is nonetheless difficult to state precisely what might have been these first productions which illustrated the continental religion officially adopted by Japan in 538. These imported productions soon aroused echos : some natives of the continent, who were already japanized, grasped in their <b>turn</b> the sculptor's <b>chisel.</b> Here again little is known about these first attempts to model in matter the forms of the new " gods ". Deciphering the ancient texts describing these events is both a perilous and a fascinating task. Trying to read between the lines while remaining within the range of truth is practically detective's business. The art historian when he studies Japanese Buddhist sculpture in its beginnings is rather like the author of detective's novels. But he has of course to set bounds to his imagination and constantly refer to the written sources and to any material indication that may help in supporting his theories. He has to avoid slipping from science into fiction. If one goes carefully through everything that has been written in the course of years on the new art that sprang up in Japan in the VIth century, it is possible to reconstruct, with little risk of error, the beginnings of that artistic period {{that is one of the}} glories of Japan. Information given by the ancient texts cannot be accepted just as it is. One has to understand the sources implicitly, without however falling into excessive extrapolation, to sift the facts through an objective criticism and to compare them strictly with the few certainties in one's possession. Such an approach that involves venturing into the forest of imagination, yet without abandoning reason's paths allows us to catch a glimpse, even through a haze, of the early beginnings of Buddhist sculpture in Japan when that country first opened itself to the continental culture.
