5|$|Following the European tour, Butthole Surfers {{experienced}} more upheaval when Nervosa left around Christmas 1985, {{as she was}} tired of the living conditions associated with constant touring and had a desire to be with family. She was replaced by another female drummer, Kytha Gernatt, who was dubbed Cabbage Gomez, Jr. in the press soon after joining the band. Cabbage had previously performed with Kathleen Lynch (a.k.a. Kathleen, a.k.a. Ta-Da <b>the</b> <b>Shit</b> Lady) in the band Easturn Stars; Lynch gained fame as Butthole Surfers' infamous naked dancer from 1986 to 1989. Kramer also left during this period and was replaced by Jeff Pinkus, who gave the band's bass position its longest period of stability by staying until 1994.|$|E

500|$|In his own words, Ocean {{calls the}} album [...] "nostalgic." [...] He explains, [...] "it's {{a longing for}} the past. That's what this record felt like." [...] The lyrical content, {{according}} to Ocean, relates to heartbreak and other familiar tropes of interpersonal relationships: [...] "I wasn't {{trying to make a}} record that people could relate to. I was just trying to make a record with <b>the</b> <b>shit</b> that I wanted to express. <b>The</b> <b>shit</b> that I wanted to get off my chest. [...] A lot of this record is influenced by one relationship, but I don't owe that whole project to one situation. It doesn't matter what the details of it are." [...] Discussing the writing process behind the album, he mused that he was just inspired to tell stories. He continued, [...] "you gotta make sure the listener is listening to you, so if you put it into a song, often times, if the song is striking enough, then you can really deliver the story most effectively while keeping the ear of the listener the whole time. I guess it all starts with the stories for me." ...|$|E

[...] "They found out that while they were calling us niggers and alligator bait, I was running for touchdowns and Willis was knocking <b>the</b> <b>shit</b> out of them," [...] Motley once said. [...] "So they stopped calling us names and started trying to catch up with us." [...] Focused exclusively on winning, Brown did not tolerate racism within the team.|$|E

500|$|Del Toro {{acknowledged}} this message's simplicity, {{but said}} {{he would have liked to}} have seen adventure films with similar morals when he was a child.

500|$|Later in 2003, The Hurricane [...] "discovered" [...] Rosey's {{potential}} as a superhero and christened him as [...] "Rosey, the Super Hero in Training" [...] (<b>the</b> <b>S.H.I.T.).</b> Rosey was involved in numerous sketches involving him training to be a superhero, including helping an old lady {{to cross the street}} and attempting to get changed into his superhero costume in a phonebox. Rosey and The Hurricane teamed regularly together during this time, wrestling against teams including Chris Jericho and Christian and Evolution. On the July 19, 2004, episode of Raw, Rosey appeared with a new costume, seemingly graduated to a full superhero, officially turning him into a fan favorite.|$|E

One show in Washington, D.C. with GWAR saw Kathleen take the stage to dance in nothing but gold body paint and antique wooden snow shoes. At another particularly wild concert in 1986, Haynes and Lynch, by now completely bald, reportedly engaged in sexual intercourse while on stage, as Leary used a screwdriver to vandalize the club's speakers. This came after only five songs, during which time Haynes had started a small fire.|$|E

500|$|MacFarlane is {{passionate about}} {{his support for}} gay rights.

[...] He went on to say, [...] "I'm incredibly passionate about my support for the gay community and what they're dealing with at this current point in time". MacFarlane continued, [...] "Why is it that Johnny Spaghetti Stain in fucking Georgia can knock a woman up, legally be married to her, and then beat <b>the</b> <b>shit</b> out of her, but these two intelligent, sophisticated writers who have been together for 20 years can't get married?" ...|$|E
500|$|Pretty on the Inside {{has had an}} {{influence}} on multiple alternative rock acts, being specifically mentioned by Spinnerette frontwoman Brody Dalle in an interview as a seminal album {{in the development of}} her music. British rock band Nine Black Alps also noted the album as a major influence on their third release, Locked Out from the Inside (2009), and indie singer-songwriter Scout Niblett cited it as a major influence on her: [...] "For me, the thing that I loved about them and her [...] was the anger, and aggressiveness, along with the tender side", said Niblett. [...] "That was something I hadn't seen before in a woman playing music. That was hugely influential and really inspiring. Women up 'til then were kind of one-dimensional, twee, sweet, ethereal, and that annoys <b>the</b> <b>shit</b> out of me." ...|$|E
500|$|Davis {{used the}} show to {{audition}} two new members—tenor saxophonist Azar Lawrence and guitarist Dominique Gaumont. Lawrence was the most highly regarded young saxophonist at the time, while Gaumont was enlisted by Davis in response to incumbent guitarist Reggie Lucas's demand for a pay raise. Although it was unexpected, Liebman later characterized the move as typical of the trumpeter: [...] "What he was doing—which he often does at big kinda gigs like that—is change <b>the</b> <b>shit</b> up, by doing something totally out. Totally unexpected. I mean, we had been a band together {{on the road for}} a year...

500|$|Although The Marble Index was {{generally}} unnoticed {{when it was}} released, it was praised by the countercultural East Village Other and International Times; however, most critics found [...] "her desolate soundscapes inaccessible." [...] Anne Marie Micklo of Rolling Stone gave the album a positive review, calling side two [...] "a really worthwhile venture into musical infinity". A cult following emerged around it, which included music journalist Lester Bangs, who wrote in a 1978 article entitled [...] "Your Shadow Is Scared of You: An Attempt Not to Be Frightened by Nico": [...] "The Marble Index is the greatest piece of 'avant-garde classical', 'serious' music of {{the last half of}} the 20th century so far." [...] Although Bangs praised the album, he also wrote that it [...] "scared <b>the</b> <b>shit</b> out of [...] " [...] and described the listening experience as [...] "self-torture".|$|E
500|$|The band wasn't {{without a}} guitarist for very long. In October 1988, Kiedis and Flea found a {{replacement}} for McKnight in teenage guitarist, John Frusciante. Flea had originally directed Frusciante to audition for the band Thelonious Monster. An avid Red Hot Chili Peppers fan, Frusciante was, according to Flea, [...] "a really talented and knowledgeable musician. He [...] knows all <b>the</b> <b>shit</b> I don't know. I basically know nothing about music theory and he's studied it to death, inside and out. He's a very disciplined musician—all he cares about are his guitar and his cigarettes." [...] Frusciante was also not very familiar with the funk genre: [...] "I wasn't really a funk player before I joined the band. I learned everything I needed to know about how to sound good with Flea by studying Hillel [...] playing and I just took it sideways from there." ...|$|E
500|$|The period {{following}} Enema of the State saw {{the band}} experience great transition. [...] "We {{had gone from}} playing small clubs and sleeping on people's floors to headlining amphitheaters and staying in five-star hotels," [...] recalled Hoppus in 2013. [...] "After years of hard work, promotion, and nonstop touring, people knew who we were, and listened to what we were saying... it scared <b>the</b> <b>shit</b> out of us." [...] The band was rushed into recording the follow-up, as according to DeLonge, [...] "the president of MCA was penalizing us an obscene amount of money because our record wasn't {{going to be out}} in time for them to make their quarterly revenue statements. [...] And we were saying, 'Hey, we can't do this right now, we need to reorganize ourselves and really think about {{what we want to do}} and write the best record we can.' They didn't agree with us." ...|$|E

500|$|During {{the song}} [...] "The Electric Co.", Bono left {{the stage and}} climbed up a {{lighting}} rig to display a white flag. In a 2004 interview, the Edge said that Bono [...] "scared <b>the</b> <b>shit</b> out of [...] " [...] by climbing onto the rig and risking electrocution by the live wires in close proximity. Bono said [...] "good night" [...] to the crowd on nearly {{a half a dozen}} occasions so that the post-production crew would have several choices of songs with which to end the film. Backstage, the band members were disappointed that the crowd did not initially chant [...] "how long to sing this song?" [...] after the band had left the stage following the final song, [...] "40", which had become a tradition. However, tour manager Dennis Sheehan hid underneath the crowd barrier and began singing the refrain into a microphone without being asked. Eventually, the crowd joined in; the film was edited to disguise the fact that the singing was organised.|$|E
500|$|The album {{features}} aggressive multi-tracking of D'Angelo's voice, {{a technique}} {{similar to the}} production of Sly & the Family Stone's There's a Riot Goin' On (1971) and Marvin Gaye's Let's Get It On (1973). The multi-tracking on Voodoo significantly affected the clarity of D'Angelo's vocals. In Voodoos liner notes, Saul Williams wrote of its heavy use of multi-tracking, stating [...] "You might respond, 'Lyrics? Yo, I can't even understand half <b>the</b> <b>shit</b> that D'Angelo be saying. That nigga sounds like Bobby McFerrin on opium'. And I'd say, 'You're right. Neither can I. But I am drawn {{to figure out what it}} is that he's saying. His vocal collaging intrigues me'". Music writers have also noted the production style and sound of Voodoo as reminiscent of the sound of the P-Funk opus Mothership Connection (1975), Gaye's downtempo disco-soul record I Want You (1976), and Miles Davis's jazz fusion works In a Silent Way (1969) and Bitches Brew (1970).|$|E
500|$|Hordern was a self-confessed [...] "lazy bugger" [...] {{when it came}} to role preparation.

He said: [...] "I am bored of the intellectual view of the theatre. Actually, it scares <b>the</b> <b>shit</b> out of me, my view being that an actor should learn the lines without too much cerebral interference." [...] In 1951, he asked Byam Shaw how best to rehearse unfamiliar roles. [...] The director advised him to [...] "never read up on them" [...] before going on to say [...] "read the plays as much as [...] but never read the commentators or critics". It was advice which Hordern adopted for the role of King Lear, {{and for the rest of}} his career. The critic Brian McFarlane, writing for the British Film Institute, said that Hordern, despite his relaxed attitude, [...] "had one of the most productive careers of any 20th century British actor".|$|E
