5|$|In cyclic neutropenia, {{there is}} a {{reduction}} in the level of circulating neutrophils in <b>the</b> <b>blood</b> <b>that</b> occurs about every 21 days. Opportunistic infections commonly occur and aphthous-like ulceration is worst during this time.|$|E
5|$|The first {{evidence}} of {{presence of a}} neutralizing substance in <b>the</b> <b>blood</b> <b>that</b> could counter infections came when Emil von Behring along with Kitasato Shibasaburō in 1890 developed effective serum against diphtheria. This they did by transferring serum produced from animals immunized against diphtheria to animals suffering from it. Transferring the serum thus could cure the infected animals. Behring was awarded the Nobel Prize for this work in 1901.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} {{alterations}} are {{visible to the}} naked eye as pentimenti. A piece of paper draped over the edge of the table is clearly visible in outline, despite having been painted over with detailing of the table itself. Sigismunda's index finger which was bent towards and perhaps touching the heart has been straightened, but the outline of the tip is still visible on the surface of the heart. A looped cord in the top right-hand corner is poorly concealed under the topmost layer of paint. It is also known that, to attempt to appease critics, Hogarth repainted the fingers of Sigismunda so that <b>the</b> <b>blood</b> <b>that</b> was previously there would no longer be visible.|$|E

5|$|Hyponatremia, {{an unusually}} {{low level of}} sodium in <b>the</b> <b>blood</b> <b>that</b> may cause {{confusion}} and seizures, is found in 40% of cases. This {{may be caused by}} low cortisol levels or by inappropriate release of antidiuretic hormone (ADH) from the posterior pituitary. Several other hormonal deficiencies may develop in the subacute phase. 50% have a deficiency in thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), leading to undersecretion of thyroid hormone by the thyroid gland and characteristic symptoms such as fatigue, weight gain, and cold intolerance. 75% develop a deficiency to gonadotropins (LH and FSH), which control the reproductive hormone glands. This leads to a disrupted menstrual cycle, infertility and decreased libido.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>blood</b> <b>that</b> spurts {{out of the}} Klingon's wounds {{was created}} using {{computer}} generated imagery; the animators {{had to make sure}} that the blood floated in a convincing manner while still looking interesting and not too gory. The effects artist looked at NASA footage of floating globules of water to inform the physics of the blood particles. Initially, the blood was to be colored green, but the filmmakers realized that McCoy had referred to Spock as green-blooded.|$|E
5|$|Flies have {{a mobile}} {{head with a}} pair of large {{compound}} eyes {{on the sides of the}} head, and in most species, three small ocelli on the top. The compound eyes may be close together or widely separated, and in some instances are divided into a dorsal region and a ventral region, perhaps to assist in swarming behaviour. The antennae are well-developed but variable, being thread-like, feathery or comb-like in the different families. The mouthparts are adapted for piercing and sucking, as in the black flies, mosquitoes and robber flies, and for lapping and sucking as in many other groups. Female horse-flies use knife-like mandibles and maxillae to make a cross-shaped incision in the host's skin and then lap up <b>the</b> <b>blood</b> <b>that</b> flows. The gut includes large diverticulae, allowing the insect to store small quantities of liquid after a meal.|$|E

5|$|The {{clitoral}} glans doubles {{in diameter}} upon arousal, and, upon further stimulation, it becomes less visible {{as it is}} covered by the swelling of tissues of the clitoral hood. The swelling protects the glans from direct contact, as direct contact at this stage can be more irritating than pleasurable. Vasocongestion eventually triggers a muscular reflex, which expels <b>the</b> <b>blood</b> <b>that</b> was trapped in surrounding tissues, and leads to an orgasm. A short time after stimulation has stopped, especially if orgasm has been achieved, the glans becomes visible again and returns to its normal state, with a few seconds (usually 5–10) to return to its normal position and 5–10 minutes to return to its original size. If orgasm is not achieved, the clitoris may remain engorged for a few hours, which women often find uncomfortable. Additionally, the clitoris is very sensitive after orgasm, making further stimulation initially painful for some women. Masters and Johnson documented the sexual response cycle, which has four phases and is still the clinically accepted definition of the human orgasm.|$|E
5|$|Two {{recently}} designed national flags {{resemble the}} Japanese flag. In 1971, Bangladesh gained independence from Pakistan, and it adopted a national flag {{that had a}} green background, charged with an off-centered red disc that contained a golden map of Bangladesh. The current flag, adopted in 1972, dropped the golden map and kept everything else. The Government of Bangladesh officially calls the red disc a circle; the red color symbolizes <b>the</b> <b>blood</b> <b>that</b> was shed to create their country. The island nation of Palau uses a flag of similar design, but the color scheme is completely different. While the Government of Palau does not cite the Japanese flag as an influence on their national flag, Japan did administer Palau from 1914 until 1944. The flag of Palau is an off-centered golden-yellow full moon on a sky blue background. The moon stands for peace and a young nation while the blue background represents Palau's transition to self-government from 1981 to 1994, when it achieved full independence.|$|E
5|$|Whereas many {{dipteran}} larvae are aquatic or live in enclosed terrestrial locations, {{the majority}} of adults live above ground and are capable of flight. Predominantly they feed on nectar or plant or animal exudates, such as honeydew, for which their lapping mouthparts are adapted. The flies that feed on vertebrate blood have sharp stylets that pierce the skin, the insects inserting anticoagulant saliva and absorbing <b>the</b> <b>blood</b> <b>that</b> flows; in this process, certain diseases can be transmitted. The bot flies (Oestridae) have evolved to parasitize mammals. Many species complete their life cycle inside the bodies of their hosts. In many dipteran groups, swarming is a feature of adult life, with clouds of insects gathering in certain locations; these insects are mostly males, and the swarm may serve the purpose of making their location more visible to females.|$|E

25|$|The {{mechanism}} of aortic insufficiency (AI), comprises {{the pressure in}} the left ventricle falling below the pressure in the aorta, the aortic valve {{is not able to}} completely close. This causes a leaking of blood from the aorta into the left ventricle. This means that some of <b>the</b> <b>blood</b> <b>that</b> was already ejected from the heart is regurgitating back into the heart. The percentage of blood that regurgitates back through the aortic valve due to AI is known as the regurgitant fraction. This regurgitant flow causes a decrease in the diastolic blood pressure in the aorta, and therefore an increase in the pulse pressure. Since some of <b>the</b> <b>blood</b> <b>that</b> is ejected during systole regurgitates back into the left ventricle during diastole, there is decreased effective forward flow in AI.|$|E
25|$|The flag of Ghana, {{consisting}} of the colours red, gold, green, and a black star, became the new flag in 1957 when Gold Coast gained its name Ghana. It was designed by Theodosia Salome Okoh; the red represents <b>the</b> <b>blood</b> <b>that</b> was shed towards independence, the gold represents the industrial minerals wealth of Ghana, the green symbolises the rich grasslands of Ghana, and the black star is {{the symbol of the}} Ghanaian people and African emancipation.|$|E

[...] which was a reference to the alleged involvement of Hawke in the resignation of former Labor leader, Bill Hayden. The question outraged Hawke, who criticised Carleton for his [...] "damned impertinence".|$|R
25|$|BBB can {{be broken}} centripetally (the most normal) or centrifugally. Several {{possible}} biochemical disrupters were proposed. Some hypotheses about how the BBB is compromised revolve around the presence of compounds in <b>the</b> <b>blood</b> <b>that</b> could interact with vessels only in the NAWM areas. The permeability of two cytokines, Interleukin 15 and LPS, {{may be involved in}} BBB breakdown. Breakdown is responsible for monocyte infiltration and inflammation in the brain. Monocyte migration and LFA-1-mediated attachment to brain microvascular endothelia is regulated by SDF-1alpha through Lyn kinase.|$|E
25|$|Generally, {{sacrifice}} can {{be divided}} into two types: autosacrifice and human sacrifice. The different forms of sacrifice are reflected in the imagery used to evoke ideological structure and sociocultural organization in Mesoamerica. In the Maya area, for example, stele depict bloodletting rituals performed by ruling elites, eagles and jaguars devouring human hearts, jade circles or necklaces that represented hearts, and plants and flowers that symbolized both nature and <b>the</b> <b>blood</b> <b>that</b> provided life. Imagery also showed pleas for rain or pleas for blood, with the same intention to replenish the divine energy.|$|E
25|$|Acute MI (as {{may occur}} {{due to the}} sudden rupture of a chorda tendinae or {{papillary}} muscle) causes a sudden volume overload of both the left atrium and the left ventricle. The left ventricle develops volume overload because with every contraction it now has to pump out not only the volume of blood {{that goes into the}} aorta (the forward cardiac output or forward stroke volume) but also <b>the</b> <b>blood</b> <b>that</b> regurgitates into the left atrium (the regurgitant volume). The combination of the forward stroke volume and the regurgitant volume is known as the total stroke volume of the left ventricle.|$|E

25|$|The primary endosymbionts {{are thought}} to help the host either by {{providing}} nutrients that the host cannot obtain itself or by metabolizing insect waste products into safer forms. For example, the putative primary role of Buchnera is to synthesize essential amino acids that the aphid cannot acquire from its natural diet of plant sap. Likewise, the primary role of Wigglesworthia, it is presumed, is to synthesize vitamins that the tsetse fly does not get from <b>the</b> <b>blood</b> <b>that</b> it eats. In lower termites, the endosymbiotic protists {{play a major role}} in the digestion of lignocellulosic materials that constitute a bulk of the termites' diet.|$|E
25|$|The heart pumps oxygenated {{blood to}} the body and deoxygenated {{blood to the}} lungs. In the human heart there is one atrium and one {{ventricle}} for each circulation, and with both a systemic and a pulmonary circulation there are four chambers in total: left atrium, left ventricle, right atrium and right ventricle. The right atrium is the upper chamber of {{the right side of}} the heart. <b>The</b> <b>blood</b> <b>that</b> is returned to the right atrium is deoxygenated (poor in oxygen) and passed into the right ventricle to be pumped through the pulmonary artery to the lungs for re-oxygenation and removal of carbon dioxide. The left atrium receives newly oxygenated blood from the lungs as well as the pulmonary vein which is passed into the strong left ventricle to be pumped through the aorta to the different organs of the body.|$|E
25|$|In December 1648, in {{an episode}} that {{became known as}} Pride's Purge, a troop of {{soldiers}} headed by Colonel Thomas Pride forcibly removed from the Long Parliament all {{those who were not}} supporters of the Grandees in the New Model Army and the Independents. Thus weakened, the remaining body of MPs, known as the Rump, agreed that Charles should be tried on a charge of treason. Cromwell was still in the north of England, dealing with Royalist resistance, when these events took place, but then returned to London. On the day after Pride's Purge, he became a determined supporter of those pushing for the king's trial and execution, believing that killing Charles {{was the only way to}} end the civil wars. Cromwell approved Thomas Brook's address to the House of Commons, which justified the trial and execution of the King on the basis of the Book of Numbers, chapter 35 and particularly verse 33 ("The land cannot be cleansed of <b>the</b> <b>blood</b> <b>that</b> is shed therein, but by the blood of him that shed it.").|$|E
