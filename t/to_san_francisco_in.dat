5|$|Campbell {{moved from}} Seattle <b>to</b> <b>San</b> <b>Francisco</b> <b>in</b> 1975, {{getting a job}} in a {{hospital}} near The Castro and immersing himself in the political and social life of the community, which had become a center for the LGBT community over the previous few years. By 1981, he had enrolled in a training program at University of California, San Francisco, to become an adult health nurse practitioner, with a view to focusing on healthcare in the gay and lesbian community.|$|E
5|$|Milk {{moved from}} New York City <b>to</b> <b>San</b> <b>Francisco</b> <b>in</b> 1972 amid a {{migration}} {{of gay and}} bisexual men to the Castro District. He {{took advantage of the}} growing political and economic power of the neighborhood to promote his interests, and three times ran unsuccessfully for political office. His theatrical campaigns earned him increasing popularity, and Milk won a seat as a city supervisor in 1977, his election made possible by, and a key component of, a shift in San Francisco politics.|$|E
5|$|Sarria and Parker worked {{together}} through both seasons of the New York fair, Expo 67 in Montreal, HemisFair '68 in San Antonio, Texas and Expo '74 in Spokane, Washington, after which Sarria retired. He and Parker moved to Phoenix, Arizona, where Sarria lived until returning <b>to</b> <b>San</b> <b>Francisco</b> <b>in</b> 1977. He remained politically active, endorsing the candidacies of Harvey Milk for the Board of Supervisors. In 1977, Milk {{would win the}} board seat that Sarria had sought in 1961.|$|E

5|$|Stackpole {{returned}} <b>to</b> <b>San</b> <b>Francisco</b> <b>in</b> 1912 {{and married}} Adele Barnes, two months younger than he, an art student of Xavier Martinez {{and one of}} the first graduates of the California Academy of Arts and Crafts. Adele Stackpole was a perfectionist in many ways, including the precision of her bookplate engravings and the demands she placed on her relationships. On June 15, 1913, the Stackpoles' son Peter was born in San Francisco.|$|E
5|$|In 1904, Hunter made a {{visit to}} Paris, funded by his {{earnings}} as an illustrator. He {{was inspired by the}} numerous artistic experiences there, and became fully resolved to take up oil painting. When he returned <b>to</b> <b>San</b> <b>Francisco</b> <b>in</b> 1905, he began preparing for his first solo exhibition, which was to be held the following year. However, Hunter's early work was destroyed in the fire that followed the 1906 San Francisco earthquake, and he returned to Scotland shortly afterwards, settling in Glasgow. Initially he continued to make his living there primarily as an illustrator. His oil painting began with still lifes on black backgrounds, influenced by the Dutch style.|$|E
5|$|Born in Watts, Los Angeles, to {{a middle-class}} African-American family, Sylvester {{developed}} {{a love of}} singing through the gospel choir of his Pentecostal church. Leaving the church after the congregation expressed disapproval of his homosexuality, he found friendship {{among a group of}} black cross-dressers and transgender women who called themselves The Disquotays. Moving <b>to</b> <b>San</b> <b>Francisco</b> <b>in</b> 1970 at the age of 22, Sylvester embraced the counterculture and joined the avant-garde drag troupe The Cockettes, producing solo segments of their shows which were heavily influenced by female blues and jazz singers like Billie Holiday and Josephine Baker. During the Cockettes' critically panned tour of New York City, Sylvester left them to pursue his career elsewhere. He came to front Sylvester and his Hot Band, a rock act that released two commercially unsuccessful albums on Blue Thumb Records in 1973 before disbanding.|$|E

5|$|He faced {{considerable}} {{opposition to}} his plan from John Considine, who controlled all three gaming operations in town. Although gambling was illegal, Considine {{had worked out}} an agreement with Police Chief C.S. Reed. Earp partnered with an established local gambler named Thomas Urguhart, and they opened the Union Club saloon and gambling operation in Seattle's Pioneer Square. The Seattle Star noted two weeks later that Earp's saloon was earning a large following. Considine unsuccessfully tried to intimidate Earp, but his saloon continued to prosper. On March 23, 1900, the state of Washington filed charges against several gamblers, including Earp and his partner. The club's furnishings were confiscated and burned. The Earps returned briefly <b>to</b> <b>San</b> <b>Francisco</b> <b>in</b> April 1900, but {{within a couple of}} months, Wyatt and Josephine returned to Oregon and caught the SS Alliance for Alaska.|$|E
5|$|Pflueger {{volunteered for}} World War I in 1917, {{working for the}} Quartermaster Corps to design base facilities. He was first {{stationed}} in Washington, D.C. and then sent to San Juan, Puerto Rico {{to take part in}} base expansion there. Returning <b>to</b> <b>San</b> <b>Francisco</b> <b>in</b> 1919, Pflueger once again focused on the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company, who now wished for a further doubling in size, extending their Stockton Street frontage 140 feet to California Street, and adding a seventh floor. A massive new entrance incorporating 17 Ionic columns was erected, topped by a pediment displaying a tableau carved by Armenian sculptor Haig Patigian. The Neoclassic-style project was completed in 1920. In 1984, the building was designated San Francisco Landmark No. 167.|$|E
5|$|The Earps {{moved back}} <b>to</b> <b>San</b> <b>Francisco</b> <b>in</b> 1891 in part so Sadie could {{be closer to}} her {{half-sister}} Henrietta's family. Earp developed {{a reputation as a}} sportsman and a gambler. He held onto his San Diego properties, but when their value fell, he could not pay the taxes. He was forced to sell the lots. He continued to race horses, but by 1896, he could no longer afford to own them. He raced them on behalf of the owner of a horse stable in Santa Rosa that he managed for her. From 1891 to 1897, they lived in at least four different locations in the city: 145 Ellis St., 720 McAllister St., 514A Seventh Ave. and 1004 Golden Gate Ave. In Santa Rosa, Earp personally competed in and won a harness race.|$|E

5|$|The Oaks {{finished}} second in the league behind the Seals in 1946, winning {{the first round of the}} playoffs against Los Angeles before losing <b>to</b> <b>San</b> <b>Francisco</b> <b>in</b> the finals. They finished fourth in 1947, beating San Francisco in the first round before losing to Los Angeles. Stengel managed the Oaks for a third year in 1948, with the roster heavy with former major leaguers. Among the younger players on the team was 20-year-old shortstop Billy Martin. Stengel was impressed by Martin's fielding, baseball acuity, and, when there were brawls on the field, fighting ability. The Oaks clinched the pennant on September 26, and defeated Los Angeles and the Seattle Rainiers to win the Governors' Cup. The Sporting News named Stengel the Minor League Manager of the Year.|$|E
5|$|While many of {{his colleagues}} saw action in the Mexicanâ€“American War, Sherman {{performed}} administrative duties in the captured territory of California. Along with fellow Lieutenants Henry Halleck and Edward Ord, Sherman embarked from New York on the 198-day journey around Cape Horn aboard the converted sloop USS Lexington. Due to the confined spaces aboard-ship, Sherman grew close to Halleck and Ord, and in his Memoirs references a hike with Halleck to the summit of Corcovado overlooking Rio de Janeiro in Brazil, notable as the future spot of the Cristo Redentor statue. Sherman and Ord reached the town of Yerba Buena, in California, two days before its name was changed <b>to</b> <b>San</b> <b>Francisco.</b> <b>In</b> 1848, Sherman accompanied the military governor of California, Col. Richard Barnes Mason, in the inspection that officially confirmed that gold had been discovered in the region, thus inaugurating the California Gold Rush. Sherman, along with Ord, assisted in surveys for the sub-divisions of the town that would become Sacramento.|$|E
5|$|Starting in the 1850s {{during the}} California Gold Rush, {{the city of}} Sacramento rapidly grew around the {{confluence}} of the Sacramento River and its tributary the American River, near the middle of the Central Valley of California. The city's increasing population necessitated the construction of an extensive system of levees on the two rivers to prevent flooding. These early flood control works were insufficient; in 1862, the city was inundated so completely that the state government was temporarily moved <b>to</b> <b>San</b> <b>Francisco.</b> <b>In</b> 1956, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers built the Folsom Dam at {{the confluence of the}} North and South Forks of the American River to provide flood control for the Sacramento metropolitan area. However, the Folsom Dam with a capacity of just 1 million acre feet (1.2 km3) compared to the annual American River flow of 2.7 million acre feet (3.3 km3) proved inadequate. A flood in 1955 filled the Folsom Reservoir to capacity, before the dam was even completed; it has also overflowed many times since.|$|E

5|$|The ship then steamed {{back down}} <b>to</b> <b>San</b> <b>Francisco</b> <b>in</b> early July. There, {{she joined the}} Great White Fleet, which had {{departed}} Hampton Roads, Virginia, the previous year on {{the first leg of}} its global cruise. The Great White Fleet then began its crossing of the Pacific, with a visit to Hawaii on the way. Stops in the South Pacific included Melbourne, Sydney, and Auckland. After leaving Australia, the fleet turned north for the Philippines, stopping in Manila, before continuing on to Japan where a welcoming ceremony was held in Yokohama. Three weeks of exercises followed in Subic Bay in the Philippines in November. The ships passed Singapore on 6 December and entered the Indian Ocean; they coaled in Colombo before proceeding to the Suez Canal and coaling again at Port Said, Egypt. The fleet called in several Mediterranean ports before stopping in Gibraltar, where an international fleet of British, Russian, French, and Dutch warships greeted the Americans. The ships then crossed the Atlantic to return to Hampton Roads on 22 February 1909. There, they conducted a naval review for President Theodore Roosevelt.|$|E
5|$|US 50 {{was created}} in 1926 {{as part of the}} {{original}} U.S. Highway system. The original route planned in 1925 ran from Wadsworth, Nevada east to Annapolis, Maryland along several auto trails including the Lincoln Highway, Midland Trail, and the National Old Trails Road. The final 1926 plan had US 50 running from Sacramento, California east to Annapolis with a gap in west Utah that was bridged by running the route north via Salt Lake City before rerouting it to U.S. Route 6 in the 1950s. US 50 was extended west from Sacramento <b>to</b> <b>San</b> <b>Francisco</b> <b>in</b> the 1930s, replacing U.S. Route 48; this was reversed in 1964 when Interstate 580 replaced much of the route between the two cities. In addition, US 50 was extended east from Annapolis to Ocean City prior in 1949, replacing a portion of U.S. Route 213. US 50 had two split configurations into U.S. Route 50N and U.S. Route 50S, one in Kansas and another in Ohio and West Virginia; both of these instances have been removed.|$|E
