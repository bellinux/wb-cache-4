5|$|The aquatic larvae {{are found}} {{in a wide variety}} of {{habitats}} such as streams, rivers, lakes, ponds, spring seeps and <b>temporary</b> <b>waters</b> (vernal pools). The larvae of many species use silk to make protective cases, which are often strengthened with gravel, sand, twigs, bitten-off pieces of plants, or other debris. The larvae exhibit various feeding strategies, with different species being predators, leaf shredders, algal grazers, or collectors of particles from the water column and benthos. Most adults have short lives during which they do not feed.|$|E
2500|$|To {{complete}} their lives, tadpole shrimps {{depend on the}} changing nature of the <b>temporary</b> <b>waters</b> they inhabit. During the dry season (summer and fall), their offspring stay inside the eggs. As the pool fills with rainwater during the winter and spring, they hatch and feed on fairy shrimps and other invertebrates. The first larval stage (the metanauplius) is orange in color. It has a single eye, six legs, and develops through instars (growth stages). Each instar ends with shedding the exoskeleton. The number of segments and appendages increases as Triops [...] grow, and they slowly change to greyish brown. In approximately eight days, they reach maturity and lay eggs. Adult Triops die as the pools dry up. Triops generally live for about 20–90 days if the pool does not dry up.|$|E

40|$|<b>Temporary</b> <b>water</b> {{trading is}} an {{established}} and growing {{phenomenon in the}} Australian irrigation sector. However, decision support and planning tools that incorporate economic and biophysical factors associated with <b>temporary</b> <b>water</b> trading are lacking. In this paper the integration of an economic trading model with a hydrologic water allocation model is discussed. The integrated model is used to estimate the impacts of <b>temporary</b> <b>water</b> trading and physical water transfers. The model can incorporate economic and biophysical drivers of water trading. The economic model incorporates the key trade drivers of commodity prices, seasonal water allocations and irrigation deliveries. The hydrologic model {{is based on the}} Resource Allocation Model (REALM) framework, which facilitates hydrologic network simulation modelling. It incorporates water delivery system properties and operating rules for the main irrigation and urban centres in a study area. The proposed integration method has been applied to a case study area in northern Victoria, Australia. Simulations were conducted for wet and dry spells, a range of commodity prices and different irrigation distribution system configurations. Some example analyses of scenarios incorporating water trading were undertaken. From these analyses potential bottlenecks to trade that constrain the economic benefits from <b>temporary</b> <b>water</b> trading were identified. Furthermore, it was found that in certain areas of the system, trading can make impacts of long drought spells worse for water users, e. g. irrigators. Thus, the integrated model can be used to quantify short-term and long-term third party impacts arising from <b>temporary</b> <b>water</b> trading. These findings also highlight the need to link "paper trades" (estimated by economic models) to physical water transfers (estimated by biophysical models). 1842 Hydrology: Irrigation 1880 Hydrology: Water management (6334) 6344 Policy Sciences: System operation and management Irrigation Water transfer Systems modelling Goulburn-Broken Catchment...|$|R

40|$|<b>Temporary</b> <b>waters,</b> in general, are {{fascinating}} habitats {{in which}} to study the properties of species adapted to living in highly variable environments. Species display a remarkable array of strategies {{for dealing with the}} periodic loss of their primary medium that sets them apart from the inhabitants of permanent water bodies. Survival of individuals typically depends on exceptional physiological tolerance or effective migrational abilities, and communities have their own, distinctive hallmarks. This paper will broadly overview the biology of temporary ponds, but will emphasize those in temperate forests. In particular, links will be sought between aquatic community properties, the nature of the riparian vegetation, and forestry practices. Quite apart from their inherent biological interest, <b>temporary</b> <b>waters</b> are now in the limelight both from a conservation per-spective, as these habitats come more into conflict with human activities, and a health-control perspective, as breeding habitats for vectors of arboviruses.
