30|$|<b>Tropospheric</b> <b>scintillation</b> {{intensity}} {{has been}} proven to increase with high carrier frequency, low elevation angle, and small receiving antenna. In general, signal fade caused by rain attenuation on communication signals is more significant compared to signal fade caused by <b>tropospheric</b> <b>scintillation.</b> However, considerations regarding <b>tropospheric</b> <b>scintillation</b> when designing the link budget become vital for low-fade-margin systems that operate at high frequency and low elevation angle (Mandeep et al. 2006). A satellite communication system that operates at a high frequency (> 10  GHz) and a low elevation angle (< 10 °) may experience more degradation from scintillation than from rain attenuation. Typically, satellite links above 10  GHz may suffer from <b>tropospheric</b> <b>scintillation</b> fluctuations of up to several decibels peak-to-peak with duration of the scintillation events, of a few seconds.|$|E
30|$|<b>Tropospheric</b> <b>scintillation</b> is {{receiving}} more attention {{because of the}} demand for higher bandwidth due to the congestion on the C and Ku bands. Higher-frequency bands tend {{to be affected by}} <b>tropospheric</b> <b>scintillation,</b> which is an event that causes the rapid fluctuation of the magnitude and phase of millimeter radio waves to occur in satellite communication systems. When the signal encounters turbulence in the atmosphere, rapid variations in the refractive index along the path will lead to fluctuations in the signal level received (Mandeep and Hassan 2004; Mandeep et al. 2006; Karasawa et al. 1988 a). These fluctuations, called scintillations, are generally constant around the mean signal level. <b>Tropospheric</b> <b>scintillation</b> depends on the season and daily weather conditions. On satellite links, significant scintillation effects are mainly caused by strong turbulence in clouds and usually occur in the summer afternoon (Mandeep and Hassan 2004).|$|E
30|$|<b>Tropospheric</b> <b>scintillation</b> is a {{phenomenon}} that will cause signal degradation in satellite communication with low fade margin. Few studies of scintillation have been conducted in tropical regions. To analyze <b>tropospheric</b> <b>scintillation,</b> we obtain data from a satellite link installed at Bandung, Indonesia, at an elevation angle of 64.7 ° and a frequency of 12.247  GHz from 1999 to 2000. The data are processed and compared with the predictions of several well-known scintillation prediction models. From the analysis, {{we found that the}} ITU-R model gives the lowest error rate when predicting the scintillation intensity for fade at 4.68 %. However, the model should be further tested using data from higher-frequency bands, such as the K and Ka bands, to verify the accuracy of the model.|$|E

Data from an experiment using the 20 GHz Olympus satellite beacon were analyzed to evaluate the performance of short-baseline site-diversity systems. Results indicate that with a baseline separation of about 50 m the signals received by the main and diversity terminals become decorrelated. Examination of several high-scintillation events shows that such a diversity technique could substantially increase the uptime of low-power-margin VSAT systems. The performance of microscale diversity for several baseline separations is evaluated in terms of a parameter called diversity recovery. Applications and conditions under which microscale diversity performs best are addressed...|$|R
40|$|One of {{the most}} recent and {{promising}} atmospheric remote sensing technique is the GPS radio occultation. The inversion of phase measurements collected by a GPS receiver placed on a Low Earth Orbit when it is rising or setting with respect to the transmitter, allows the retrieval of accurate and high vertical resolution atmospheric profiles. One of the main problems affecting the tracking of occulted GPS signals is the premature phase lock loss, due in particular to anomalous propagation phenomena (i. e., multipath, defocusing, <b>tropospheric</b> <b>scintillations,</b> etc.) occurring through the lower troposphere. Such effects may cause the refractivity close to Earth's surface to be unretrieved or negatively biased (when compared with the meteorological analysis). One of the possible solutions to mitigate the signal fading through the lower atmosphere is the adoption of open-loop tracking channels in the hardware design of the receivers. This is the strategy implemented in the new GPS radio occultation receiver (ROSA) developed by the Italian Space Agency. Some insight about the prediction model for the incoming frequency needed for open-loop purposes and its validation with real occultation data are given. Moreover, a measurement campaign with the ROSA bread-board is planned for the next 2006 year {{on the top of a}} mountain, in order to test and to validate the receiver.

Impairments due to rain attenuation and <b>tropospheric</b> <b>scintillations</b> will significantly affect new technologies for this spectrum. Heavy rain at Ka-band can easily produce 30 dB of attenuation along the propagation path. Propagation experiments being conducted in seven different climatic zones involve multiyear attenuation measurements along the satellite-earth slant path. Measurements in the B 2 climatic zone {{are made with}} an ACTS propagation terminal located in northeast Colorado. In order to gain more understanding about the physical processes {{that are responsible for}} Ka-band attenuation, the Colorado State University CHILL S-band polarimetric radar is used to take radar measurements along the slant path. The Colorado Front Range experiences a variety of weather conditions throughout the year ranging from upslope rain conditions to winter storms. Four such events measured along the slant path are illustrated in this paper. They include two convective cases and two “bright-band ” cases. The S-band polarimetric radar data is used to initialize radar-based attenuation-prediction models, which are applied to the four precipitation events described. The comparisons of predicted attenuation to measured attenuation are quite good.

40|$|An {{increase}} in the demand for satellite communications {{has led to an}} overcrowding of the current spectrums being used - mainly at C and Ku bands. To alleviate this overcrowding, new technology is being developed to open up the Ka-band for communications use. One of the first experimental communications satellites using this technology is NASA's Advanced Communications Technology Satellite (ACTS). In Sept. 1993, ACTS was deployed into a geostationary orbit near 100 deg W longitude. The ACTS system employs two Ka-band beacons for propagation experiments, one at 20. 185 GHz and another at 27. 505 GHz. Attenuation due to rain and <b>tropospheric</b> <b>scintillations</b> will adversely affect new technologies proposed for this spectrum. Therefore, before being used commercially, propagation effects at Ka-band must be studied. Colorado State University is one of eight sites across the United States and Canada conducting propagations studies; each site is equipped with the ACTS propagation terminal (APT). With each site located in a different climatic zone, the main objective of the propagation experiment is to obtain monthly and yearly attenuation statistics. Each site also has secondary objectives that are site dependent. At CSU, the CSU-CHILL radar facility is being used to obtain polarimetric radar data along the ACTS propagation path. During the expected two to four year period of the project, it is hoped to study several significant weather events. The S-band radar will be used to obtain Ka-band attenuation estimates and to initialize propagation models that have been developed, to help classify propagation events measured by the APT. Preliminary attenuation estimates for two attenuation events will be shown here - a bright band case that occurred on 13 May 1994 and a convective case that occurred on 20 Jun. 1994. The computations used to obtain Ka-band attenuation estimates from S-band radar data are detailed. Results from the two events are shown...|$|R
