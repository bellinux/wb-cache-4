In {{an interview with}} Japanese magazine S Cawaii, Hamasaki said about the sound of Rock 'n' Roll Circus; [...] "... basically has a feeling of [...] "back-to-basics." [...] A feeling of Ayumi Hamasaki, and less of adventure. More digging down into the foundation. Which isn't to say I'm taking a step backward.

500|$|During {{his time}} in Nelson, Constantine made a deep {{impression}} and remained a [...] celebrity there even after leaving the town; [...] his general community involvement was such [...] that a regional historian described him as a [...] "local champion". He appreciated the greater freedom he enjoyed in Nelson as compared with Trinidad, where racial issues predominated. Although Nelson suffered {{from the effects of}} the Depression, Constantine's high earnings were never a source of resentment; of {{his time in}} Nelson he wrote: [...] "If I had not come... I could not have been <b>the</b> <b>person</b> <b>I</b> am today... I am a better citizen for the time I have spent in Nelson." ...|$|E

Commenting about the success of his singles, Songz stated that [...] "they're very strong records and they're not just radio records. They're records that embody <b>the</b> <b>person</b> <b>I</b> am as well as the artist I am. I think they're more definitive of who I am than any other album I've had. I've grown as an artist. I've been doing this [...] now. As I've matured, I've learned how to exude that of which I want to be felt. I've learned what my fans want from me and things of that nature." ...|$|E
500|$|Kemper again {{brought his}} victims {{back to his}} mother's house, this time {{beheading}} them {{in his car and}} carrying a headless corpse into his mother's house to have sex with. He then dismembered the bodies, removed the bullets to prevent identification and, the next morning, discarded their remains. Remains were found at Eden Canyon a week after the murders, and more were found near Highway 1 in March. When questioned in a later interview as to why he removed his victim's head before having sex with the body, he explained: [...] "The head trip fantasies were a bit like a trophy. You know, the head is where everything is at, the brain, eyes, mouth. That's <b>the</b> <b>person.</b> <b>I</b> remember being told as a kid, you cut off the head and the body dies. The body is nothing after the head is cut off... well, that's not quite true, there's a lot left in the girl's body without the head." ...|$|E

[...] Ament said that [...] "Pilate" [...] concerned a question he was asking himself, dealing with a recurring dream Ament had with being old sitting with his dog on the porch, while [...] "Low Light" [...] was the answer, and that it deals with [...] "a kind of gratefulness at finding that place of calm and peace at my center and getting a glimpse of <b>the</b> <b>person</b> <b>I</b> could choose to be." ...|$|E

500|$|On 11 December 1980 Hodgson {{asked to}} see a priest, Father Frank Moran, to whom he confessed {{that he was having}} nightmares and the face of a woman he had killed [...] "kept coming back to him". He said that the murder had {{happened}} in Southampton the previous year and [...] "that he was particularly troubled because this was around the anniversary of her death". He repeated the confession to a prison officer the following day, and subsequently wrote a note which stated: [...] "After much deliberation and thought and confession with the priest here in Wandsworth, after all the trouble I have caused, not only to you, the police, but myself, the mental torture I have gone through, the family of the person concerned, I must for my own sanity and the punishment I will receive for this horrible crime, I wish now that it was me that was dead and not <b>the</b> <b>person</b> <b>I</b> killed at the Tom Tackle pub. ... I did the murder, why I don't know. So all I can say is let justice be done".|$|E
500|$|Rodman {{experienced}} a tough loss when coach Chuck Daly, {{whom he had}} admired as a surrogate father, resigned in May; Rodman skipped the preseason camp and was fined $68,000. The following 1992–1993 season was even more tumultuous. Rodman and Annie Bakes, {{the mother of his}} daughter Alexis, were divorcing after a short marriage, an experience which left him traumatized. The Pistons won only 40games and missed the 1993 NBA Playoffs entirely. One night in February 1993, Rodman was found asleep in his car with a loaded rifle. Four years later in his biography As Bad As I Wanna Be, he confessed having thought about suicide and described that night as an epiphany: [...] "I decided that instead [...] I was gonna kill the impostor that was leading Dennis Rodman to a place he didn't want to go... So I just said, 'I'm going to live my life the way I want to live it and be happy doing it.' At that moment I tamed [...] my whole life around. I killed <b>the</b> <b>person</b> <b>I</b> didn't want to be." [...] The book was later adapted for a TV movie Bad As I Wanna Be: The Dennis Rodman Story. Although he had three years and $11.8million remaining on his contract, Rodman demanded a trade. On October 1, 1993, the Pistons dealt him to the San Antonio Spurs.|$|E

[...] He also points out he was a socialist at a time when [...] "the media was on the whole slavishly worshipping of Thatcher". He said of his political views [...] "I believe in the politics of Clement Attlee. I'm a Welfare State Labour voter." ...|$|E
