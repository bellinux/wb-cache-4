40|$|ABSTRACT Purpose: To compare {{perceptions}} {{of the quality of}} ophthalmological services offered to outpatients from <b>the</b> public <b>healthcare</b> system to those from <b>the</b> private <b>healthcare</b> system, and to determine which measures are seen as necessary and a priority for improving the quality of care. Methods: This was a prospective observational study on 200 patients, 101 and 99 of whom were from the public and private healthcare systems, respectively. All patients underwent an ophthalmological examination at an ophthalmology hospital in Belo Horizonte, Minas Gerais, Brazil. Personal interviews were conducted using two structured questionnaires adapted from the modified SERVQUAL scale. Results: Overall, patients from <b>the</b> private <b>healthcare</b> system were significantly more dissatisfied than those from <b>the</b> public <b>healthcare</b> system. In both systems, reliability was considered {{to be the most important}} determinant of quality, and it presented the highest level of dissatisfaction. Satisfaction with <b>the</b> public <b>healthcare</b> system was significantly greater than that with <b>the</b> private <b>healthcare</b> system in terms of the tangibles, reliability, responsiveness, and assurance determinants of the SERVQUAL scale. Conclusions: Institutions must plan, execute, evaluate, and monitor measures that seek to improve the overall patient satisfaction with the quality of services provided, particularly in <b>the</b> private <b>healthcare</b> system, and special attention must be paid to reliability in both <b>healthcare</b> systems. <b>The</b> identification and monitoring of <b>the</b> quality of <b>healthcare</b> services through <b>the</b> periodic use of the SERVQUAL scale may provide healthcare managers with information so that they can identify, plan, and monitor necessary and priority measures. This could be a key strategy for improving the quality of outpatient health services in the public and private systems...|$|R

5|$|Norway has {{a unified}} police, {{which means that}} there is a single police {{organization}} and that police power and prosecutor power is not granted to other agencies within Norway. The sole exception is the military police, albeit which only has jurisdiction over military personnel and on military installations, except during martial law. The police are decentralized and generalized to allow a more flexible resource allocation, while remaining under political control. This entails that police officers have no geographical or sector limitations to their powers. The Police Act and several special laws regulate the agencies and the officer's powers and responsibilities. The police are required to assist other public institutions, including <b>the</b> <b>healthcare</b> authorities, and can be asked by other agencies to assist when it is necessary to enact a decision by force. Conversely, the police can ask for assistance from the Coast Guard when necessary. The police are responsible for all responses against terrorism and sabotage unless Norway is under armed attack.|$|E
