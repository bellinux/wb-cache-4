25|$|Since its inception, Stu Ungar and Johnny Moss are {{the only}} players to have won the Main Event three times. However, Moss's first victory came in a {{different}} format, as he was elected winner by vote of his fellow players {{at the conclusion of}} what was then a timed event. Moss (if the first time win by vote is counted), Ungar, Doyle Brunson, and Johnny Chan are <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> have won the Main Event in consecutive years.

25|$|In late 2005 {{the police}} warned Pararajasingham of {{a plot to}} kill him {{and as a result}} he avoided going to Batticaloa unless it was necessary. However, on Christmas Eve 2005 Pararajasingham and Sugunam {{travelled}} from Colombo to Batticaloa along with two police bodyguards. Pararajasingham wanted to attend the midnight mass at St. Mary's Cathedral, Batticaloa being given by Bishop Kingsley Swampillai but a worried Sugunam suggested that attend mass on Christmas morning. However, Pararajasingham insisted that they go that night. <b>The</b> <b>only</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> knew of the Pararajasinghams' decision to attend midnight mass were their police bodyguards. That evening, at around 10.30pm, they arrived at St. Mary's Cathedral but on finding the cathedral deserted they left, only to return later with Robin, Sugunam's brother, and his family.|$|E

25|$|Two women, Angela Wright and Rose Jourdain, made {{statements}} to Senate staffers {{in support of}} Hill. Ultimately, however, Wright and Jourdain were dismissed by the Judiciary Committee without testifying. The reasons why Wright was not called (or chose not to be called) to testify are complex and {{a matter of some}} dispute; Republican Senators wanted to avoid the prospect of a second woman describing inappropriate behavior by Thomas, while Democratic Senators were concerned about Wright's credibility and Wright herself was reluctant to testify after seeing the Committee's treatment of Hill, including Pennsylvania Senator Arlen Specter stating that he felt Hill's testimony was perjurious in its entirety. During the Thomas nomination proceedings, Wright and Hill were <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> publicly alleged that then-Judge Thomas had made unsolicited sexual advances, and Hill {{was the only one who}} testified to that effect.|$|E

A former member is someone who resigns from the band or who has not attended a practice or performance {{for at least three}} years. Both playing and auxiliary members have voting rights as long as they meet certain annual criteria laid out in the Standing Rules of the Bylaws.

To Armstrong it came as no surprise—the room was full of veterans of Project Gemini, <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>people</b> <b>who</b> could fly the lunar missions. Slayton talked about the planned missions and named Armstrong to the backup crew for Apollo 9, which at that stage was planned to be a medium Earth orbit test of the Lunar Module-Command/Service Module combination.
