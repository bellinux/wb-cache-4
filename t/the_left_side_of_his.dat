5|$|On the 39th lap, Castroneves overtook Bräck {{around the}} outside at turn three and moved into third place, and Fernández got ahead of Bräck {{around the outside}} at the same corner two laps later. Takagi drove {{to the inside of}} the third turn {{underneath}} Servià, and both drivers made contact with the side of their cars; Servià became briefly airborne and heavily damaged <b>the</b> <b>left</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> car when he hit the outside wall which caused the fifth caution. Servià was unhurt but Takagi managed to continue without any apparent damage. The race resumed on lap 45 with de Ferran leading Tagliani. Castroneves hit the rear-end of Tagliani's car on the following lap but both drivers continued without damage. The sixth caution was shown on the 49th lap when Takagi hit the right-rear wheel of Moreno's car in the turn three right-hand corner.

50|$|Hemispatial neglect, {{also called}} {{unilateral}} neglect, often occurs {{when people have}} damage to their right hemisphere. This damage often leads to a tendency to ignore <b>the</b> <b>left</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> one's body or even <b>the</b> <b>left</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> an object that can be seen. Damage to <b>the</b> <b>left</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> brain (<b>the</b> <b>left</b> hemisphere) rarely yields significant neglect <b>of</b> the right <b>side</b> <b>of</b> the body or object in the person's local environments.|$|R
40|$|Subjects with hemispatial neglect often exhibit {{representational}} neglect: {{a failure}} to report details from <b>the</b> <b>left</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> mentally visualized images. This failure could reflect impaired ability to generate <b>the</b> <b>left</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mental image, or it could reflect failure to explore <b>the</b> <b>left</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> a normally generated mental image. When subjects with hemispatial neglect look at pictures or drawings, their attention tends to be drawn to objects on the right side, thereby aggravating their failure to explore <b>the</b> <b>left</b> <b>side.</b> If representational neglect represents {{a failure to}} explore <b>the</b> <b>left</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> a normally generated mental visual image, then it should be improved by blindfolding, which removes the attention-catching right-sided stimuli. However, if representational neglect represents a failure to generate <b>the</b> <b>left</b> <b>side</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mental visual image, then blindfolding should have little impact on reporting of details of the image...|$|R
