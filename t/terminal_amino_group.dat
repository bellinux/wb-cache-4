To enhance the electrophilicity of carboxylate group, the negatively charged oxygen must first be [...] "activated" [...] into a better leaving group. DCC is used for this purpose. The negatively charged oxygen will act as a nucleophile, attacking the central carbon in DCC. DCC is temporarily attached to the former carboxylate group forming a highly electrophilic intermediate, making nucleophilic attack by the <b>terminal</b> <b>amino</b> <b>group</b> on the growing peptide more efficient.|$|E
5000|$|Lysyl oxidase is an {{important}} enzyme {{for the creation of}} crosslinks between collagen triple-helices in connective tissue. By oxidizing the <b>terminal</b> <b>amino</b> <b>group</b> of lysine, an aldehyde is created. This aldehyde can undergo several reactions with neighboring aldehydes or amines to create strong covalent cross-links between collagen tertiary structures in bone and cartilage. The main product of these reactions is the aldimine compound dehydrohydroxylysinonorleucine. [...] This unique crosslink can be formed by the Schiff base mechanism in which the lone pair of electrons on a primary amine react with the carbonyl carbon of an aldehyde. Other crosslinks include the formation of an α,β-unsaturated ketone via aldol condensation and hydroxylysinonorleucine.|$|E
5000|$|Trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid (C6H3N3O9S) is an nitroaryl {{oxidizing}} acid.

The aromatic nitro compounds may explode {{in the presence}} of a base such as sodium hydroxide or potassium hydroxide even {{in the presence of}} water or organic solvents because of the explosive tendencies of aromatic nitro compounds which increase in the presence of multiple nitro groups.

40|$|The {{influences}} of thiol monolayers having <b>terminal</b> <b>amino</b> <b>groups</b> on the electron transfer rate for indigotetrasulfonate {{have been examined}} by cyclic voltammetry and ac impedance spectroscopy. The electron transfer rate for indigotetrasulfonate decrease with increasing pH at a bare Au electrode. The adsorption of indigotetrasulfonate ion onto 4 -aminothiophenol monolayer, at low pH values, resulted primarily from an electrostatic attraction between the protonated <b>terminal</b> <b>amino</b> <b>groups</b> and the anions. An increase in solution pH, however, 4 -aminothiophenol, cystamine, and 4 -mercaptopyridine monolayer-modified electrode showed a increase in electrochemical reversibility with deprotonation of the <b>terminal</b> <b>amino</b> <b>groups.</b> Whereas 11 -amino- 1 -undecanethiol, which is longchain thiol having <b>terminal</b> <b>amino</b> <b>groups</b> impedes the electrode reaction of [Co (phen) 3] 3 +, this monolayer raised the apparent rate constant for indigotetrasulfonate to twice that observed at a bare Au in pH 6. Furthermore, {{in the presence of}} ethylenediamine or triethylenetetramine at pH 8, indigotetrasulfonate was obtained the reversible wave using at a bare Au. We propose a chemical interaction between the amine groups of the thiol monolayer and the carbonyl groups of indigotetrasulfonate.

50|$|In {{cells from}} Fanconi anaemia patients, FA core complex {{induction}} of FANCD2 ubiquitination is not observed, assumably a result from impaired complex formation {{due to the}} lack of a working FANCA protein. Ultimately, regardless of specific mutation, it is disruption of this FA/BRCA pathway that results in the adverse cellular and clinical phenotypes common to all FANCA-impaired Fanconi anaemia sufferers. Interactions between BRCA1 and many FANC proteins have been investigated. Amongst known FANC proteins, most evidence points for a direct interaction primarily between FANCA protein and BRCA1. Evidence from yeast two-hybrid analysis, coimmunoprecipitation from in vitro synthesis, and coimmunoprecipitation from cell extracts shows that the site of interaction is between the <b>terminal</b> <b>amino</b> <b>group</b> of FANCA and the central part of BRCA1, located within amino acids 740-1083.|$|E
50|$|Klein et al first {{suggested}} a water molecule assisted mechanism. A single water molecule possibly {{held in place}} by hydrogen bonding with the carboxylate group of the persistent Asp144 residue transfers protons from the GAR-N to the THF-N. The nucleophilic nitrogen on the <b>terminal</b> <b>amino</b> <b>group</b> of GAR attacks the carbonyl carbon of the formyl group on THF pushing negative charge onto the oxygen. Klein suggests that His108 stabilizes the transition state by hydrogen bonding with the negatively charged oxygen and that the reformation of the carbonyl double bond results in breaking the THF-N - formyl bond. Calculations by Qiao et al suggest that the water assisted stepwise proton transfer from Gar-N to THF-N is 80-100 kj/mol more favorable than the concerted transfer suggested by Klein. The mechanism shown is suggested by Qiao et al, whom admittedly did not consider surrounding residues in their calculations.|$|E
