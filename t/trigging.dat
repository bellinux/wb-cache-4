50|$|Low Level Jet (LLJ): LLJs {{originate}} {{in a low}} pressure area over the northern Andes and provide moisture for subtropical latitudes. During summer, they operate as localised wind maximum within the lower 1-2 km of the atmosphere, channelled by the Andes, terminating in southeastern South America. They are controlled by Amazonian wind patterns, which are influenced and controlled by patterns of insolation. They transport large amounts of moisture from the Amazon basin to the monsoonal anitcyclone over Bolivia. A suppressed SACZ and increased convection in the sub-tropical plains {{is associated with a}} strengthening of the LLJ. These phases are linked to short-term extreme precipitation events in the plains of central Argentina. When the LLJ is weak, there is enhanced SACZ and suppressed convection to the south and extreme heat waves over the sub-tropical regions.

This is the assumption that, generally, the stimulation (or ‘triggering’) of a disposition temporally precedes the manifesting of that disposition.

I will then argue that on either of these views about triggering, a {{case can be made}} against the view that the triggering of a disposition always occurs before the manifesting of that disposition. More precisely, if the first view about triggering is accepted, and certain plausible assumptions about dispositions are put into place, a metaphysical argument can be formulated for the claim that the stimulation of a disposition never occurs before that disposition manifests. If the second view about triggering is accepted, the question concerning simultaneity becomes an empirical one. There are, however, examples of dispositional interaction which, on the second view about triggering, clearly seem to involve simultaneity. ...|$|E

Here, we asked whether treatment with free radical scavengers could improve the dystrophic pattern of mdx muscles. Five-week-old mdx mice were treated for 2 weeks with alpha-lipoic acid/l-carnitine. This treatment decreased the plasmatic creatine kinase level, the antioxidant enzyme activity, and lipid peroxidation products in mdx diaphragm. Free radical scavengers also modulated the phosphorylation/activity of some {{component of the}} mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascades: p 38 MAPK, the extracellular signal-related kinase, and the Jun kinase. beta-Dystroglycan (beta-DG), a multifunctional adaptor or scaffold capable of interacting with components of the extracellular signal-related kinase-MAP kinase cascade, was also affected after treatment. In the mdx muscles, beta-DG (43 kd) was cleaved by matrix metalloproteinases into a 30 -kd form (beta-DG 30). We show that the proinflammatory protein nuclear factor-kappaB activator decreased after the treatment, leading to a significant reduction of matrix metalloproteinase activity in the mdx diaphragm.

40|$|This study {{demonstrates}} that the nanopore terraces constructed on a multilayer graphene sheet could be employed to con-trol the conformation and transportation of an ssDNA for nanopore sequencing. As adsorbed on a terraced graphene na-nopore, the ssDNA has no in-plane swing nearby the nanopore, and can be locked on graphene terraces in a stretched con-formation. Under biasing, the accumulated ions near the nanopore promote the translocation of the locked ssDNA, and also disturb the balance between the driven force and resistance force acted on the nucleotide in pore. A critical force {{is found to be}} necessary in <b>trigging</b> the kickoff of the ssDNA translocation, implying an inherent field effect of the terraced graphene nanopore.
