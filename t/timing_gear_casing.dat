C. motors {{with the help of}} ANSYS workbench software. <b>Gear</b> box <b>casing</b> {{is a part of the}} gear box, it provides support to the shaft and bearings. Thus the <b>gear</b> box <b>casing</b> is an important component to be taken into account while designing. <b>Gear</b> box <b>casing</b> i. e. the top and bottom cover casing is typically made up of an aluminum material using casting process. The objective of the project is to build the model (<b>Gear</b> box <b>casing)</b> and to analyze the <b>gear</b> box <b>casing</b> used for permanent magnet DC motors for Static stress and Modal analysis. The load for static stress analysis is calculated by Rope and pulley method setup. The <b>gear</b> box <b>casing</b> is modeled using CATIA V 5 software and analyzed using ANSYS workbench software. The static stress analysis is used to analyze the stresses and deformations of the <b>gear</b> box <b>casing</b> and the modal analysis is executed to govern the vibration features (Mode shapes and natural frequencies) of <b>gear</b> box <b>casing</b> in order to prevent the resonance for <b>gear</b> box <b>casing</b> component. The results obtained by the stress analysis is found to be in a good agreement and modal analysis i. e. vibrational characteristics like frequency and mode shapes are presented and are within the limits...|$|R

50|$|Trains of <b>timing</b> <b>gears</b> are {{commonly}} used in diesel overhead camshaft engines used in heavy trucks. They are less commonly used in overhead camshaft engines in light trucks or automobiles.|$|R
50|$|Over the years, the Tech IV engine {{has proved}} to be a {{reliable}} workhorse for owners when not pushed to its limits. All 1978-1990 Iron Duke L-4's are outfitted with a micarta camshaft gear that meshes directly with a steel gear on the crankshaft (no timing chain), a design also used by the Chevrolet inline six. 1991-92 VIN R and U engines received a timing chain. The <b>timing</b> <b>gear</b> has a tendency to crumble a tooth anytime after 80,000 miles. The cam gear simply shears a tooth at startup and the engine won't start; because of the non-interference design of the engine, no further damage occurs. When the cam gear loses a tooth, the camshaft AND distributor stop rotating during engine cranking. Replacing the gear requires heating the new gear in hot oil and quickly installing it for a shrink(interference) fit on the cam stub. One upgrade is the use of the aluminum camshaft <b>timing</b> <b>gear</b> from a Chevrolet 250 inline six with the Iron Duke's crankshaft <b>timing</b> <b>gear.</b>|$|R

25|$|The Boarhound was {{evaluated}} alongside the Armstrong Whitworth Atlas, de Havilland Hyena and Vickers Vespa. The Jupiter's variable <b>timing</b> <b>gear</b> gave poorer power at low altitudes, a disadavantage for an army cooperation aircraft, and the Atlas was considered superior.|$|R
50|$|As a more applied example, {{the result}} of a DEA simulationon a Yanmar tractor model (body in blue: chassis/cabin steel frame and windows) is shown here to the left.In the cited work, the {{numerical}} DEA results are compared with experimental measurements at frequencies between 400 Hz and 4000 Hzfor an excitation {{on the back of the}} <b>gear</b> <b>casing.</b> Both results agree favorably. The DEA simulation can be extended to predict thesound pressure level at driver's ear.|$|R
5000|$|A {{short block}} is an engine {{sub-assembly}} comprising {{the portion of}} the cylinder block below the head gasket but above the oil pan. An in-block cam engine includes the camshaft, <b>timing</b> <b>gear,</b> and any balance shafts. Overhead cam engines don't include those parts.|$|R
5000|$|On modern engines without {{rocker arms}} they are internationally known as [...] "valve cover" [...] but are {{sometimes}} referred to as a [...] "cam cover" [...] or [...] "timing cover" [...] if they also cover the <b>timing</b> <b>gear(s)</b> and belt or chain.|$|R
50|$|In theory, {{it is also}} {{possible}} to provide an overdrive top gear, another indirect gear, but of a speed-up ratio rather than the reduction ratio of the other gears. The direct-drive ratio then becomes the second-to-top or third gear. This arrangement was used on some early cars, but was uncommon. Where overdrive is provided for a RWD car, this is almost always done by adding a separate overdrive gearbox to the output driven shaft of the gearbox, usually outside the <b>gear</b> <b>casing.</b>|$|R

Maximum boost was 25psi (170 kPa gauge; or an absolute pressure of 270 kPa or 2.7atm). On the Hornet the Merlin 130 was fitted in the port nacelle: the Merlin 131, fitted in the starboard nacelle, was converted to a [...] "reverse" [...] or left-hand tractor engine using an additional idler gear in the reduction <b>gear</b> <b>casing.</b>|$|R
50|$|Production of the Model 2 {{began in}} 1947. Initial {{problems}} like noisy <b>timing</b> <b>gears</b> were remedied with special quality control measures, which included having the production foreman test and personally approve each engine {{that left the}} plant. The 1948 Model 3 DeliverCycle, a three-wheeled commercial vehicle used for parking enforcement by city police departments, was developed from the Model 2. Production of the DeliverCycle began in 1948.|$|R
50|$|Lobe {{pumps are}} similar to {{external}} gear pumps in operation in that fluid flows around {{the interior of the}} <b>casing.</b> Unlike external <b>gear</b> pumps, however, the lobes do not make contact. Lobe contact is prevented by external <b>timing</b> <b>gears</b> located in the gearbox. Pump shaft support bearings are located in the gearbox, and since the bearings are out of the pumped liquid, pressure is limited by bearing location and shaft deflection.|$|R
