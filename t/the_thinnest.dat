5|$|While parody {{sometimes}} {{served as}} {{a special kind of}} translation, some translations returned the compliment by providing a parodic version of the Elegy in their endeavour to accord to the current poetic style in the host language. An extreme example was provided by the classicised French imitation by the Latin scholar John Roberts in 1875. In place of the plain English of Gray’s “And all that beauty, all that wealth e’er gave”, he substituted the Parnassian Tous les dons de Plutus, tous les dons de Cythère (All the gifts of Plutus and of Cytherea) and kept this up throughout the poem in a performance that its English reviewer noted as bearing only <b>the</b> <b>thinnest</b> relation to the original.|$|E
5|$|Generally, each {{household}} prepares one badnjak, {{although more}} are cut in some regions. Depending {{on the local}} custom, Montenegrin Serbs may fell two, three, an arbitrary number greater than two, or the number equal to the male members of household plus one. The latter means {{that each of the}} males has a log associated with him, with the thickest log representing the head of household and <b>the</b> <b>thinnest</b> linked to the family's prosperity. If there is only one man in the household, three rather than two logs are prepared. The logs may be cut from different species of tree. In parts of the Bay of Kotor, each household prepares four sets of badnjaks, as they are burned there not only on Christmas Eve, but also on the eves of New Years Day, Epiphany, and the Feast of Saint Sava.|$|E

40|$|The media play a {{key role}} in {{promoting}} <b>the</b> <b>thin</b> ideal. A qualitative study, in which we used in depth interviews and thematic analysis, was undertaken to explore the attitudes of 142 obese individuals toward media portrayals of <b>the</b> <b>thin</b> ideal. Participants discussed <b>the</b> <b>thin</b> ideal as a social norm that is also supported through the exclusion of positive media portrayals of obese people. They perceived <b>the</b> <b>thin</b> ideal as an ‘unhealthy’ mode of social control, reflecting on their personal experiences and their concerns for others. Participants’ perceptions highlighted the intersections between <b>the</b> <b>thin</b> ideal and gender, grooming and consumerism. Participants’ personal responses to <b>the</b> <b>thin</b> ideal were nuanced – some were in support of <b>the</b> <b>thin</b> ideal and some were able to critically reflect and reject <b>the</b> <b>thin</b> ideal. We consider how <b>the</b> <b>thin</b> ideal may act as a form of synoptical social control, working in tandem with wider public health panoptical surveillance of body weight...|$|R

Based on {{the rapid}} {{response}} advantages and test problems of <b>the</b> <b>thin</b> film resistor, <b>the</b> analysis {{and research on}} two aspects are focused: First, <b>the</b> <b>thin</b> film resistor {{is used as a}} current sensor which is applied in high-voltage DC transformer. The structure and performance of <b>the</b> <b>thin</b> film resistor are analyzed and simulated. Second, the dynamic characteristics of <b>the</b> <b>thin</b> film resistor are tested by indirect temperature measurement method. The problem of current rapid temperature measurement is solved. The dynamic temperature characteristic curve of <b>the</b> <b>thin</b> film resistor is analyzed by using multi-exponential spectral analysis method. The thermal characteristics of the fine structure for <b>the</b> <b>thin</b> film resistor are described by spectral characteristics. Moreover, more test information of the fine structure from comprehensive test results is separated to guide the improvement of <b>the</b> <b>thin</b> film resistor structure...|$|R

However, the wing is significantly thinner to allow better high-speed performance and has a thickness/chord ratio of only 3.8% at the root and 3.2% at the tip; this wing was <b>the</b> <b>thinnest</b> built in Europe {{at that time and}} one of <b>the</b> <b>thinnest</b> in the world.

5000|$|In {{the typical}} [...] "direct print" [...] method, the plate is inked, <b>the</b> <b>thin</b> paper (dampened) {{is placed on}} the inked plate and trimmed to size, paste is applied to <b>the</b> <b>thin</b> paper, and <b>the</b> {{ensemble}} (plate plus thin paper with paste) is placed on a dampened backing sheet.

An advantage of this method is that <b>the</b> <b>thin</b> paper will be exactly the desired size, since it is trimmed to size and then quickly affixed in place.|$|R
40|$|In this paper, the {{bioethanol}} production with <b>the</b> <b>thin</b> stillage recirculation in mashing was investigated. The mashing {{was performed}} with recirculation of: 0, 10, 20 and 30 % of <b>the</b> <b>thin</b> stillage. <b>The</b> <b>thin</b> stillage recirculation was repeated six times. In the experiment without <b>the</b> <b>thin</b> stillage, <b>the</b> recirculation bioethanol yield (compared to the theoretical yield) was 97. 96 %, which implicates that the experiment conditions were chosen and performed well. With {{the addition of}} <b>the</b> <b>thin</b> stillage, <b>the</b> bioethanol yield increased and was above 100 %. Higher bioethanol yield than 100 % {{can be explained by}} the fact that <b>the</b> <b>thin</b> stillage contains carbohydrates, amino acids and yeast cells degradation products. The bioethanol yield increased with the increased number of thin stillage recirculation cycles. Dry matter content in fermenting slurry increased with <b>the</b> increased <b>thin</b> stillage quantity and the number of <b>the</b> <b>thin</b> stillage recirculation cycles (8. 04 % for the first and 9. 40 % for the sixth cycle). Dry matter content in thin stillage increased with <b>the</b> increased <b>thin</b> stillage quantity and <b>the</b> number of <b>thin</b> stillage recirculation cycles. Based on the obtained results it can be concluded that thin stillage recirculation increased the bioethanol yield.

This means these bits tend to bind in metal; given a workpiece of sufficient thinness, they have a tendency to punch through and leave the bit's cross-sectional geometry behind.|$|E
40|$|A {{electrostatic}} adhesion tester for thin film conductors.

25|$|Long draw is spun from a carded rolag. The rolag is spun {{without much}} {{stretching}} of the fibres from the cylindrical configuration. This {{is done by}} allowing twist into a short section of the rolag, and then pulling back, without letting the rolag change position in one's hands, until the yarn is the desired thickness. The twist will concentrate in <b>the</b> <b>thinnest</b> part of the roving; thus, when the yarn is pulled, the thicker sections with less twist will tend to thin out. Once the yarn is the desired thickness, enough twist is added to make the yarn strong. Then the yarn is wound onto the bobbin, and the process starts again.|$|E
25|$|Artillery {{was rarely}} placed inside a village {{because of the}} danger of the {{buildings}} catching fire and detonating the ammunition. Instead the guns were placed alongside a village or on a hill behind it. On the battlefield, the light artillery was stationed in the front line or covering the flanks. Typically, howitzers were assigned to a battery to use their long-range shell fire. In order to achieve mutual support, batteries were placed 600–900 paces apart. If action was imminent, the cannons would be loaded in advance and two matches kept lit.
