5000|$|For {{distinguished}} and conspicuous gallantry and intrepidity at {{the risk}} of his life above and beyond the call of duty, while pilot of an airplane of Bombing Squadron 5, Lt. Powers participated, with his squadron, in 5 engagements with Japanese forces in the Coral Sea area and adjacent waters during the period 4 to 8 May 1942. Three attacks were made on enemy objectives at or near Tulagi on 4 May. In these attacks he scored a direct hit which instantly demolished a large enemy gunboat or destroyer and is credited with 2 close misses, 1 of which severely damaged a large aircraft tender, the other damaging a 20,000-ton transport. He fearlessly strafed a gunboat, firing all his ammunition into it amid intense antiaircraft fire. This gunboat was then observed to be leaving a heavy oil slick in its wake and later was seen beached on a nearby island. On 7 May, an attack was launched against an enemy airplane carrier and other units of the enemy's invasion force. He fearlessly led his attack section of 3 Douglas Dauntless dive bombers, to attack the carrier. On this occasion he dived in the face of heavy antiaircraft fire, to an altitude well below the safety altitude, {{at the risk}} of his life and almost certain damage to his own plane, in order that he might positively obtain a hit in {{a vital part of the}} ship, which would insure her complete destruction. This bomb hit was noted by many pilots and observers to cause a tremendous explosion engulfing the ship in a mass of flame, smoke, and debris. The ship sank soon after. That evening, in his capacity as Squadron Gunnery Officer, Lt. Powers gave a lecture to the squadron on point-of-aim and diving technique. During this discourse he advocated low release point in order to insure greater accuracy; yet he stressed the danger not only from enemy fire and the resultant low pull-out, but from own bomb blast and bomb fragments. Thus his low-dive bombing attacks were deliberate and premeditated, since he well knew and realized the dangers of such tactics, but went far beyond the call of duty in order to further the cause which he knew to be right. The next morning, 8 May, as the pilots of the attack group left the ready room to man planes, his indomitable spirit and leadership were well expressed in his own words, [...] "Remember <b>the</b> <b>folks</b> <b>back</b> <b>home</b> are counting on us. I am going to get a hit if I have to lay it on their flight deck." [...] He led his section of dive bombers down to the target from an altitude of 18,000 feet, through a wall of bursting antiaircraft shells and into the face of enemy fighter planes. Again, completely disregarding the safety altitude and without fear or concern for his safety, Lt. Powers courageously pressed home his attack, almost to the very deck of an enemy carrier and did not release his bomb until he was sure of a direct hit. He was last seen attempting recovery from his dive at the extremely low altitude of 200 feet, and amid a terrific barrage of shell and bomb fragments, smoke, flame and debris from the stricken vessel.|$|E

40|$|Transcription begins] CAMP BARKELEY, TEXAS Thursday, Jan. 28, 1943 Dear Miss Blaney, I’m {{sitting on}} my bunk in Hutment (?) No. 9 writing this note at about 2 : 15 P. M. The reason I am here and not {{drilling}} is I am on the sick list. When I first arrived in Texas, I caught one of those Texas colds as {{did most of the}} boys from the East. Today is the first time mine really got the better of me. However, this is not supposed to be a “sob” letter. The package from the B. S. C. ’s Cigarette Committee came last week, but this has been my first opportunity to write and express my sincere thanks for it. I wish I could really put into words how a gift such as the one from B. S. C. makes a soldier feel. I am not a soldier as yet, but still in the processing stage, however they call us soldiers. I was just rereading your letter and I came to the part “where you are. ” Right now I am 12 miles from Abilene, Texas, but we had our first overseas alert Monday and probably within a month we will be enroute for parts unknown, at least to us. It gave us all a funny feeling, but we all agreed that we were a little bit anxious to get over. So you see it will be a little difficult to keep you posted. I shall do my best though to drop you a card once in awhile. My duties, as I guess I told you, are taking dictation from our Regtl. Commander, Col. McCoy, an old World War I soldier, Major Whitsett, the Executive Officer, and Lt. Writner, the Adjutant. They keep me busy and up till Tuesday night, I worked until 1 or 2 o’clock in the morning. You see it is the largest Truck Regiment in the Army and as a result this Headquarters is BUSY. We have about 4 companies on maneuvers and several more in active duty. The remainder is at Cp Barkeley (Cp is abbrev. for Camp). It is nice working at Hq even though the hours are long. Every officer in the Regiment drops in and the Military Correspondence is interesting. I have this advantage over most of the boys as I take all the confidential “stuff” but of course I am sworn to secrecy. The Military abbreviations and the set-up of Military Correspondence is, of course, quite different from civilian life and it is a fine thing that Bryant installed a course in the Military this year. By the way, a fellow with a working knowledge of Shorthand “gets places” in the Army. We have just had a cold spell here and it looks as though we were [sic] in for a hot spell now. The weather here is more changeable than in New England. I heard you are having quite a storm there. I feel sorry for <b>the</b> <b>folks</b> <b>back</b> <b>home</b> [...] what with no oil [...] rationing of food stuffs, etc. You see in the Army we get everything [...] even butter. There is also a great deal of waste which is unnecessary. Our three meals are very large, so much so that I have given up eating breakfast. (I can stand it.) I am losing weight, not so much as I thought though. I just purchased a San Antonio paper, The San Antonio Light, and the War news is very encouraging. San Antonio is about 2 - 3 hours ride from here, I think. Our American fliers are doing a nice job over there in the Rhineland. The news in your letter was also interesting. And I certainly shall feel free to ask for anything. That was very very nice of you. I always did feel very much at home at Bryant. Please remember me to everyone at Bryant and especially the B. S. C. and pray for all the boys in the Service. Very sincerely, 								Nick Coracci 								[Transcription ends...|$|E

Yes, it was the Bryant Service Club’s letter to Bryant Alumni. A courier of glad tidings and news of my Alma Mater. When a fellow receives such a note {{from a group of}} people like you [...] people who are practically strangers to him and yet people who are the friendliest of his friends who exert all their efforts to keep him in good spirits in this period of his life [...] you can feel sure that your mission has been thoroughly accomplished. I am certain, too, that the other boys must feel as I do about your letters. Your letters are as welcome as the sun over here in England. Old Sol does not get out very often in the land of John Bull. O, he does stick his head {{out in front of the}} fog every once in awhile, but he is disinclined, I think, to cope with the inclemency of the weather over here. However, in spite of the atmospheric conditions existing in the UK, the country is a very beautiful one [...] everything which Shelley, Byron, Shakespeare, and all the other great English authors have written about it is true. It is quite relaxing to stroll over the terrain and past old churches and graveyards [...] you just know what Thomas Gray was trying to put across about the latter. Meandering through the sanctum sanctorum of God’s animals, you feel that you are walking about the countryside of New England [...] the rolling landscape, green green grass, daffodils, etc. You just know that the next person who speaks to you will have a New Hampshire drawl, or a Maine patois, or the provincialisms of Vermont. Instead, you hear a bright “Cheerio” which, of course, puts you right back in the United Kingdom. The natives here are very friendly and try everything in their power to keep the Yanks happy. No matter how amicable they are, though, they cannot take the place of <b>the</b> <b>folks</b> <b>back</b> <b>home.</b> The inimitable “Hya Joe” or “Hello, Bryant Alumnus” cannot be supplanted by their “Cheerio” however bright it may be. And speaking of the “folks back home,” please remember me to Dr. Jacobs, Mr. Gardner Jacobs, Mr. Allan, Miss Blaney, the faculty and clerical force, and the student body of Bryant. I think of them all quite often. As you can see from the heading of this letter, I am a member of an Army headquarters and because I am a part of such an organization it is best that I do not attempt to inform you of anything I might do. I am sure you will appreciate my reticence. I can tell you that I am secretary to the Colonel who is at the head of our section. Quite a number of you are looking forward to your graduation which will take place soon. May I admonish each one of you “that the cemeteries are filled with indispensable men” and that when you do enter the business world or the professional world, you are just about to begin your life of study. That which you have just completed is the preliminary period which is requisite prior to the actual undertaking of your career. Everything will be new to you [...] study everything thoroughly, learn to make quick decisions, and above all give your very best to the employer who has placed his confidence in you. Great rewards will be forthcoming, but they will be commensurate with your efforts. May success always accompany your endeavors. Good luck to all of you at Bryant and thanks from the bottom of my heart for remembering me. I have not received your package as yet, but when I do I am sure I shall enjoy its contents immensely.
