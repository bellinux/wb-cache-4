5|$|Margunn Bjørnholt and Ailsa McKay {{argue that}} the {{financial}} crisis of 2007–08 and the response to it revealed a crisis of ideas in mainstream economics and within the economics profession, and call for a reshaping of both the economy, economic theory and the economics profession. They argue that such a reshaping should include new advances within feminist economics that take as their starting point the socially responsible, sensible and accountable subject in creating an economy and economic theories <b>that</b> <b>fully</b> acknowledge care for each other {{as well as the}} planet.|$|E
5|$|While the {{procession}} was an actual historic event, Matejko took many artistic liberties, such as including persons {{who were not}} in fact present or had died earlier. He did so because he intended the painting to be a synthesis of {{the final years of}} the Commonwealth. He also felt that there was no real historic moment or location <b>that</b> <b>fully</b> captured the spirit of the Constitution, and so he, the artist, needed to create such a moment.|$|E
5|$|William Bryan and {{his wife}} donated land and built a school at nearby Glenore in 1862. The Bryans left a bequest <b>that</b> <b>fully</b> funded the school until 1914, when the state's {{education}} department assumed responsibility for {{the building and the}} teacher's salary. By 1921 56 students were attending. The building had been condemned by 1926 and a new brick school building was built a short distance away. Following a direction by Mrs Bryan in her bequest, the school was used at times for religious services, by Methodists and Anglicans. Due to low attendance the school was closed in 1941 and the few remaining pupils continued schooling at Whitemore.|$|E

5|$|Harihara's nephew and protégé, the {{dramatic}} poet Raghavanka of Hampi, whose style {{is compared to}} that of 10th-century poet Ranna, was the first to establish the shatpadi metre in Kannada literature in the epic Harishchandra Kavya (1200). According to L. S. Seshagiri Rao, it is believed that in no other language has the story of King Harishchandra been interpreted in this way. The writing is an original in tradition and inspiration <b>that</b> <b>fully</b> develops the potential of the shatpadi metre. The narration has many noteworthy elegiac verses such as the mourning of Chandramati over the death of her young son Lohitashva from snake bite. The very writing that made Raghavanka famous was rejected by his guru, Harihara. His other well-known writings, adhering to strict Shaiva principles and written to appease his guru, are the Siddharama charitra (or Siddharama Purana), a larger than life stylistic eulogy of the compassionate 12th-century Veerashaiva saint, Siddharama of Sonnalige; the Somanatha charitra, a propagandist work that describes the life of saint Somayya (or Adaiah) of Puligere (modern Lakshmeshwar), his humiliation by a Jain girl and his revenge; the Viresvara charita, a dramatic story of the blind wrath of a Shaiva warrior, Virabhadra; the Hariharamahatva, an account of the life of Harisvara of Hampi; and Sarabha charitra. The last two classics are considered lost.|$|E
5|$|In 1544 Henry VIII bequeathed {{the castle}} to Thomas Howard, the Duke of Norfolk, but the {{property}} continued to decline. By the 1570s the castle and its earthworks {{had been allowed}} to become infested with rabbits, whose warrens caused extensive damage; a survey suggested <b>that</b> <b>fully</b> renovating the castle would cost £2,000, and that even if it were pulled down and sold for the value of its materials, it would only realise £66. At the end of the century, the inner bailey was finally cleared of most of its buildings; the new lodgings were pulled down, along with most of the west range and the old Norman chapel, leaving only the ruined keep, alongside the latrines and the newer chapel, although what these last two were then used for is uncertain. The foundations of the old chapel were slowly covered up by the earth defences.|$|E
5|$|In most {{variations}} Black has {{the opportunity}} to play Bb4+, a move whose advisability depends on White's possible answers. If White blocks the check with Nb1–c3 then Black should capture the knight only if White is forced to take back with the pawn, after which the isolated, doubled pawns are a positional advantage for Black <b>that</b> <b>fully</b> compensates the loss of the bishop pair, and even the gambitted pawn. Due to its immunity to pawn attacks, the c5-square may be used by Black as a stronghold for his pieces. Piece exchanges can be good for Black even if he is a pawn down, as he can hope to exploit the crippled pawn structure in the ending. On the other hand, if White can recapture with a piece, the trade on c3 typically concedes the bishop pair for insufficient compensation.|$|E

5|$|The primary {{method of}} {{controlling}} A. aegypti is by eliminating its habitats. This {{is done by}} getting rid of open sources of water, or {{if this is not}} possible, by adding insecticides or biological control agents to these areas. Generalized spraying with organophosphate or pyrethroid insecticides, while sometimes done, is not thought to be effective. Reducing open collections of water through environmental modification is the preferred method of control, given the concerns of negative health effects from insecticides and greater logistical difficulties with control agents. People can prevent mosquito bites by wearing clothing <b>that</b> <b>fully</b> covers the skin, using mosquito netting while resting, and/or the application of insect repellent (DEET being the most effective). However, these methods appear not to be sufficiently effective, as the frequency of outbreaks appears to be increasing in some areas, probably due to urbanization increasing the habitat of A. aegypti. The range of the disease appears to be expanding possibly due to climate change.|$|E

25|$|The Shah {{decided to}} {{continue}} on his plan of liberalization, and decided to negotiate rather than to use force against the still nascent protest movement. He promised <b>that</b> <b>fully</b> democratic elections for the Majlis would be held in 1979. Censorship was relaxed, and a resolution was drafted to help reduce corruption within the royal family and the government. Protesters were tried in civilian courts rather than by military court-martials, and were quickly released.|$|E
25|$|Between 2002 and 2004, 73% {{of heating}} fires and 27% of all {{residential}} {{fires in the}} United States {{were found to be}} caused by failure to clean out creosote buildup. Since 1990, creosote buildup has caused 75% fewer fires.

Above 2500 meters dwarf conifers and rhododendrons predominate {{in the harsh}} “elfin forest”, so called because a lack of topsoil and nutrients means <b>that</b> <b>fully</b> mature trees grow to measure only a few meters in height.

25|$|Turkeys {{are usually}} baked or roasted in an oven for several hours, often while the cook prepares the {{remainder}} of the meal. Sometimes, a turkey is brined before roasting to enhance flavor and moisture content. This is necessary because the dark meat requires a higher temperature to denature all of the myoglobin pigment than the white meat (which is very low in myoglobin), so <b>that</b> <b>fully</b> cooking the dark meat tends to dry out the breast. Brining makes it possible to fully cook the dark meat without drying the breast meat. Turkeys are sometimes decorated with turkey frills prior to serving.|$|E
25|$|The Phillies pitched two no-hit {{games at}} the stadium, the only nine-inning no-hitters in stadium history. Both were against the San Francisco Giants. Terry Mulholland pitched the first on August 15, 1990, in a 6–0 Phillies win. Kevin Millwood pitched the second on April 27, 2003, and beat the Giants 1–0, upstaging the Phillie Phanatic's {{birthday}} promotion that afternoon. The Montréal Expos' Pascual Pérez pitched a five-inning no-hitter shortened by rain on September 24, 1988.

25|$|On January 1, 1991, {{commercial}} aviation in Europe was completely liberalized and the existing capacities {{led to an}} aggressive competition among the airlines. In a national referendum on December 6, 1992, Swiss citizens rejected {{taking part in the}} European Economic Area, EEA. This referendum was a significant disservice to Swissair, an airline with a minute domestic market: Its planes were not allowed to take up passengers during intermediate landings in EEA countries (e.g., Zurich – Frankfurt – New York), and Swissair was not allowed to offer tickets for sections <b>that</b> <b>fully</b> lie in EEA member countries (e.g., Zurich – Frankfurt – Paris).

25|$|The government, therefore, was {{determined}} to allow no increase of his already overgrown authority, and Mazarin made an attempt, which for the moment proved successful, both to find him employment and to tarnish his fame as a general. He was sent to lead the revolted Catalans. Ill supported, {{he was unable to}} achieve anything, and, being forced to raise the siege of Lleida, he returned home in bitter indignation. In 1648, however, he received the command in the important field of the Low Countries, and at Lens (19 August) a battle took place, which, beginning with a panic in his own regiment, was retrieved by Condé's coolness and bravery, and ended in a victory <b>that</b> <b>fully</b> restored his prestige.|$|E
25|$|During {{the course}} of his deception, Reavis managed to {{convince}} a number of prominent persons to support his efforts. He obtained legal and political support from Roscoe Conkling, Robert G. Ingersoll and James Broadhead. Business leaders such as Charles Crocker and John W. Mackay in turn provided financial support. Initial exposure of the fraud occurred when an unfavorable Surveyor General report caused the claim to be summarily dismissed. In response to this action, Reavis sued the U.S. government for US$11 million in damages ($ in present-day terms). The suit in turn prompted the U.S. government to perform a detailed investigation <b>that</b> <b>fully</b> exposed the forgeries Reavis had planted in a variety of locations.|$|E
