5|$|During {{the summer}} break, Jack's girlfriend CNBC host Avery Jessup (Elizabeth Banks) {{moved in with}} him. Avery decides to redecorate Jack's apartment. He is not keen on the idea, but not wanting <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>no</b> or give into Avery's demands, decides to employ the Fabian strategyâ€”named after Fabius Maximus, a Roman general who {{employed}} a strategy of avoiding battles, instead wearing the enemy down by attrition. Jack is successful in avoiding redecorating the apartment; he agrees to knock down a wall instead. At {{the end of the}} episode, however, he realizes that Avery has emulated the military genius of Hannibal, outmaneuvering his Fabian strategy, and he ecstatically realizes they are a perfect match, far beyond the level of mere soul-mates.|$|E
5|$|Within {{the scope}} of a popular {{comparison}} that draws parallels between House and Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's Sherlock Holmes, Wilson is equivalent to Doctor Watson. In two-parts episodes such as Euphoria, Part 1 and Euphoria, Part 2, and House's Head and Wilson's Heart, Wilson's voice is heard narrating the story, while Dr. Watson is the character who narrates the stories in most of Sherlock Holmes novels. Leonard has said that his character and House were originally intended to play roles similar to Dr. Watson and Sherlock Holmes, respectively, in the series although he believes that House's team has {{assumed the role of}} Watson since the show has begun. Producer Katie Jacobs believes that Wilson and House both hide from mature relationships, which brings the two closer together. She has said that {{the difference between the two}} characters is that Wilson finds it hard <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>no</b> because he wants to please the other person. The similarities between Dr. Wilson and Dr. Watson was also one of the reasons that made Leonard choose House over Numb3rs.|$|E

25|$|A {{consequence}} {{of the law of}} conservation of energy is that a perpetual motion machine of the first kind cannot exist, that is <b>to</b> <b>say,</b> <b>no</b> system without an external energy supply can deliver an unlimited amount of energy to its surroundings. For systems which do not have time translation symmetry, it may not be possible to define conservation of energy. Examples include curved spacetimes in general relativity or time crystals in condensed matter physics.|$|E
25|$|Management which models {{the use of}} {{articulated}} dissent {{contributes to}} the use of articulated dissent among its employees (Kassing & Avtgis, 1999). Subordinates who witness their supervisors successfully articulating dissent may be more likely and more willing to adopt similar strategies. However, a supervisor must keep in mind that expressing dissent can be very difficult and uncomfortable for lower-level managers and employees. Therefore, supervisors should not only take actions to encourage dissent, they must be willing to seek out individuals willing <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>no</b> to them (Roberto, 2005).|$|E

25|$|IMF {{policies}} have been repeatedly criticised for {{making it difficult for}} indebted countries <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>no</b> to environmentally harmful projects that nevertheless generate revenues such as oil, coal, and forest-destroying lumber and agriculture projects. Ecuador for example had to defy IMF advice repeatedly to pursue the protection of its rainforests, though paradoxically this need was cited in IMF argument to support that country. The IMF acknowledged this paradox in the 2010 report that proposed the IMF Green Fund, a mechanism to issue special drawing rights directly to pay for climate harm prevention and potentially other ecological protection as pursued generally by other environmental finance.|$|E
25|$|The {{view that}} {{sexuality}} is victimization teaches girls {{to be careful}} of being sexually victimized and taken advantage of. Educators who hold this perspective encourage sexual education, but focus on teaching girls how <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>no,</b> teaching them of the risks of being victims and educate them about risks and diseases of being sexually active. This perspective teaches adolescents that boys are predators and that girls are victims of sexual victimization. Researchers state that this perspective does not address the existence of desire within girls, does not address the societal variables that influence sexual violence and teaches girls to view sex as dangerous only before marriage. In reality, sexual violence can be very prevalent within marriages too.|$|E
25|$|States {{have a right}} <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>no</b> {{to retail}} FDI within their jurisdiction.

Finally, in future, states can always introduce regulations and India can change the law to ensure the benefits of retail reforms reach the poorest and weakest segments of Indian society, free and fair retail competition does indeed lead to sharply lower inflation than current levels, small farmers get better prices, jobs created by organised retail pay well, and healthier food becomes available to more households.|$|E

25|$|It is {{considered}} to be an outstanding edible species with a distinctively sweet or nutty flavor. However, great caution must be exercised to properly identify it, as the deadly Amanita ocreata (and occasionally Amanita phalloides) is also found in the same habitat at the same time of year, and can often be found in close proximity to each other. A. ocreata and A. phalloides have thin universal veil remnants, a sac-like volva, an annulus, a non-striate pileus margin, and a pileus that is a different color than A. velosa. These differences can fade as the fruiting body ages, making it important to collect only specimens that have all of their identifying characteristics intact. Some authorities go so far as <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>no</b> Amanita should be considered for eating.|$|E
25|$|On 5 December 1995, Solana {{became the}} new Secretary-General of NATO, {{replacing}} Willy Claes {{who had been}} forced to resign in a corruption scandal. His appointment created controversy as, in the past, he had been an opponent of NATO. He had written a pamphlet called 50 Reasons <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>no</b> to NATO, and had been on a US subversives list. On 30 May 1982 Spain joined NATO. When PSOE came to power later that year, Solana and the party changed their previous anti-NATO positions into an atlanticist, pro-NATO stance. On 12 March 1986 Spain held a referendum on whether to remain in NATO, with the government and Solana successfully campaigning in favour. When criticised about his anti-NATO past, Solana argued that he was happy to be its representative as it had become disassociated from its Cold War origins.|$|E
25|$|On the January 20 {{episode of}} Raw, Eric Bischoff made an {{announcement}} about how Stone Cold Steve Austin {{walked out on}} Vince McMahon {{during the summer of}} 2002 with no explanation and {{that he would like to}} give Steve Austin an opportunity to give his side of the story. Bischoff also invited Steve Austin to make an appearance at next month's No Way Out. The following week, Bischoff stated that Austin has agreed to tell his story in the Raw magazine. On the February 3 episode of Raw, Bischoff headed to Texas, to sign Austin to the Raw brand. But, he was unsuccessful in doing so, as he couldn't locate Austin anywhere. The following week on Raw, Bischoff (kayfabe) fired Jim Ross, after Bischoff stated that it was Ross' fault that Austin hasn't signed yet to the brand. Vince McMahon, who the previous week stated he would fire Bischoff and Chief Morley for the way they were running Raw the last couple of weeks, asked Bischoff if he'd signed Austin yet, which prompted Bischoff <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>No.</b> J.R. informed McMahon that Austin would be at No Way Out, which led to McMahon booking a match between Bischoff and Austin for the pay-per-view.|$|E

25|$|When {{comparing}} the sexual self-concepts of adolescent girls and boys, {{researchers found that}} boys experienced lower sexual self-esteem and higher sexual anxiety. The boys stated they were less able to refuse or resist sex at a greater rate than the girls reported having difficulty with this. The authors state {{that this may be}} because society places so much emphasis on teaching girls how to be resistant towards sex, that boys donâ€™t learn these skills and are less able to use them when they want <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>no</b> to sex. They also explain how societyâ€™s stereotype that boys are always ready to desire sex and be aroused may contribute to the fact that many boys may not feel comfortable resisting sex, because it is something society tells them they should want. Because society expects adolescent boys to be assertive, dominant and in control, they are limited in how they feel it is appropriate to act within a romantic relationship. Many boys feel lower self-esteem when they canâ€™t attain these hyper-masculine ideals that society says they should. Additionally, there is not much guidance on how boys should act within relationships and many boys {{do not know how to}} retain their masculinity while being authentic and reciprocating affection in their relationships. This difficult dilemma is called the double-edged sword of masculinity by some researchers.|$|E
500|$|Steven Zaillian (writer of Schindler's List) {{was offered}} the chance to write the {{adaptation}} after Tally passed, but he also declined. He explained that [...] "I was busy. And I wasn't sure I was interested. You can almost never win when you do a sequel." [...] David Mamet was the first screenwriter to produce a draft, which, according to Ridley Scott and the producers, needed major revisions. Stacey Snider, co-chairman of Universal Pictures (a co-production deal was struck between Universal and MGM) said on the rejection of Mamet's screenplay: [...] "There's no way David was going to read 15 pages of our notes and then be available {{to work on the}} script day-to-day." [...] Mamet was preparing to direct his own film. Zaillian, who had already passed, reconsidered and became involved in the project, saying: [...] "It's hard <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>no</b> to Dino once and it's almost impossible <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>no</b> to him twice." [...] A script review at ScreenwritersUtopia.com describes the Mamet draft as [...] "stunningly bad" [...] but found Zaillian's rewrite to be [...] "gripping entertainment".|$|E

Thomas credits him with holding the Liberal Party together through his strength, but blames him for failing to heal its underlying divisions. [...] Sifton was originally selected as Premier {{in the hopes that}} he would lead the Liberal Party to continued dominance of provincial politics in Alberta. [...] His success in this regard was mixed: although he led the party to victory in the 1913 and 1917 elections, its majorities declined each time. Moreover, his victories were marred by accusations of unethical electoral tactics.|$|E

50|$|According to Lorenzo Cotula, {{laws are}} usually {{published}} in the official gazette, few people outside legal circles have access to legal information.
