5|$|By 14:00 the 4th Parachute Brigade was {{no further}} forward. With {{casualties}} mounting, Brigadier Hackett asked General Urquhart's permission to withdraw {{south of the}} railway line. His intention was to move through Wolfheze and into Oosterbeek where the division's support units waited.

In 2005, Nelson and several other business partners formed Willie Nelson Biodiesel ("Bio-Willie"), a company that is marketing bio-diesel bio-fuel to truck stops. The fuel is made from vegetable oil (mainly soybean oil), and can be burned without modification in diesel engines.|$|E
5|$|Many elite {{research}} {{medical centers}} {{are located in}} Texas. The state has nine medical schools, three dental schools, and two optometry schools.

5|$|On {{the morning}} of August19, the storm {{remained}} slightly weakened from its peak strength. As a Category4 hurricane with wind speeds between 140mph (220km/h) and 145mph (230km/h), the center of Hurricane Dean passed 90mi (150km) south of Haiti, and that evening passed 25mi (40km) south of Jamaica. Two weather stations {{on the island of}} Jamaica, one at Ingleside and <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>at</b> Morant Bay, both reported in excess of 13in (33cm) of rainfall.

The racetracks required 85,000 vacuum tubes. Where possible, off-the-shelf components were used, but all too many components of the calutrons were unique. Two purchasing departments were established, one in Boston near Stone & Webster for facility equipment, and <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>at</b> Oak Ridge for construction supplies.|$|E
5|$|The Battle of Kupres (Bosnian, Croatian, Serbian: Bitka za Kupres) was {{a battle}} of the Bosnian War, fought between the Bosnian Croat Territorial Defence Force (Teritorijalna obrana – TO) {{supported}} by the Croatian Army (Hrvatska vojska – HV) troops {{on one side and}} the Yugoslav People's Army (Jugoslovenska narodna armija – JNA), augmented by the Bosnian Serb TO on <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>at</b> the Kupres Plateau, on 3–11 April 1992. During the fighting on 8 April, the Bosnian Croat TO was reorganised as the Croatian Defence Council (Hrvatsko vijeće obrane – HVO). The objective of the battle was to control the strategic Kupres Plateau, a major supply route.|$|E
5|$|The Harrier GR.1 {{made its}} first flight on 28 December 1967. It officially entered service with the RAF on 18 April 1969 when the Harrier Conversion Unit at RAF Wittering {{received}} its first aircraft. The aircraft were built in two factories—one in Kingston upon Thames, southwest London, and <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>at</b> Dunsfold Aerodrome, Surrey—and underwent initial testing at Dunsfold. The ski-jump technique for launching Harriers from Royal Navy aircraft carriers was extensively trialled at RNAS Yeovilton from 1977.

5|$|The first {{components}} of the Mulberry harbours were brought across on D+1 and the structures were in use for unloading by mid-June.

Severe storms on 19 June interrupted the landing of supplies and destroyed the Omaha harbour. The repaired Arromanches harbour was able to receive around 6,000 tons of materiel daily and was in continuous use {{for the next ten}} months, but most shipments were brought in over the beaches until the port of Cherbourg was cleared of mines and obstructions on 16 July.|$|E
5|$|The {{intricacies of}} Laotian affairs, and U.S. and North Vietnamese {{interference}} in them, {{led to a}} mutual policy of each ignoring <b>the</b> <b>other,</b> <b>at</b> least in the public eye. However, this didn't prevent the North Vietnamese from violating Laos's neutrality by protecting and expanding their supply conduit, and by supporting their Pathet Lao allies in their war against the central government. U.S. intervention {{came in the form}} of building and supporting a CIA-backed clandestine army in its fight with the Communists and constantly bombing the trail. They also provided heavy support for the Laotian government.|$|E
5|$|The {{period between}} Stillman's Run and the Battle of Apple River Fort {{was filled with}} war-related {{activity}} and events. A series of attacks at Buffalo Grove, the Plum River settlement, Fort Blue Mounds and the war's most famous incident, the Indian Creek massacre, all took place between mid-May and late June 1832. The week preceding the Battle of Apple River Fort was an important turning point for the militia: between June 16–18 two key battles, one at Waddams Grove and <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>at</b> Horseshoe Bend, {{played a key role}} in changing public perception about the militia after its defeat at Stillman's Run.|$|E

5|$|There are two {{medical schools}} in the territory, one based at the Chinese University of Hong Kong and <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>at</b> the University of Hong Kong. Both have links with public sector hospitals. With respect to {{postgraduate}} education, traditionally many doctors in Hong Kong have looked overseas for further training, and many took British Royal College exams such as the MRCP(UK) and the MRCS(UK). However, Hong Kong has been developing its own postgraduate medical institutions, in particular the Hong Kong Academy of Medicine, and this is gradually taking over the responsibility for all postgraduate medical training in the territory.|$|E
5|$|Two fossils {{have been}} {{interpreted}} as isolated lower premolars of Ferugliotherium, {{but neither is}} still regarded as such. Two other teeth {{have been identified as}} upper premolars of Ferugliotherium; as with the jaw fragment, they may also represent an indeterminate multituberculate. One of the two preserves two longitudinal rows of cusps, of which one contains four and <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>at</b> least two cusps. The other is more poorly preserved, but may represent the same tooth position. These teeth resemble multituberculate upper premolars.|$|E
5|$|Bronze {{vessels are}} made and placed one above <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>at</b> {{different}} levels; they are filled with pure water.

The water dripping (from above) enters two inflow receivers (alternately), the left one being for the night and the right one for the day. On the covers of each (inflow receiver) there are small cast statuettes in gilt bronze; the left (night) one is an immortal and the right (day) one is a policeman. These figures guide the indicator-rod (lit. arrow) with their left hands, and indicate the graduations on it with their right hands, thus giving the time.|$|E

5|$|Defeat at the Battle of Ajnadayn left Syria {{vulnerable}} to the Muslim army. Khalid decided to capture Damascus, the Byzantine stronghold. At Damascus, Thomas, son-in-law of Byzantine Emperor Heraclius, {{was in charge of}} the city's defense. Receiving intelligence of Khalid’s march towards Damascus he prepared the city's defences. He wrote to Emperor Heraclius, who was at Emesa that time, for reinforcement. Moreover, Thomas, in order to delay or halt Khalid's advance and to attain time to prepare for a siege, sent his armies to move forward. Two of his armies were routed first at Yaqusa in mid-August and <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>at</b> Maraj as-Saffar on 19 August. Meanwhile, Heraclius' reinforcements reached Damascus before the other column of Heraclius reached the city which Khalid laid siege to on 20 August. To isolate Damascus from the rest of the region, Khalid placed the detachments south on the road to Palestine and in north at the Damascus-Emesa route, and several other smaller detachments on routes towards Damascus. Heraclius' reinforcements were intercepted and routed by Khalid at the Battle of Sanita-al-Uqab 30km from Damascus.|$|E
5|$|During the {{afternoon}} of August16, officials issued a mandatory evacuation order for residents in St. Joseph Peninsula State Park and Stone State Park on Cape San Blas in Gulf County, Florida.

Voluntary evacuation orders were also given to residents living in low-lying areas along the coastline. Although no plans {{were put in place}} to open shelters, the Emergency Operations Center in Washington County raised their activation level to stage two. In Franklin County, the Emergency Operations Center was placed at stage three and voluntary evacuation orders were issued for Alligator Point. After an afternoon briefing, officials in Walton County declared a State of Emergency based on available information on the storm. In Wakulla County, the American Red Cross opened a shelter in Crawfordville at a local church.|$|E
5|$|Ferguson {{has been}} Manager of the Month the most {{times with a}} record twenty-seven awards. Harry Redknapp has had six spells {{managing}} Premier League football clubs (West Ham United, Portsmouth, Southampton, Portsmouth again, Tottenham Hotspur and Queens Park Rangers) winning a Manager of the Month award {{in each of those}} spells. Eight other managers have won an award with two or more clubs: Martin O'Neill with Leicester City, Aston Villa and Sunderland, Brendan Rodgers with Swansea City and Liverpool, Stuart Pearce with Nottingham Forest and Manchester City, Gordon Strachan with Coventry City and Southampton, Sam Allardyce with Bolton Wanderers and West Ham United, Mauricio Pochettino with Southampton and Tottenham Hotspur, Rafael Benítez with Liverpool and Chelsea and Claudio Ranieri with Leicester City and Chelsea.

Stuart Pearce also won consecutive awards; one {{at the end of the}} 2004–05 season, and <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>at</b> the start of the 2005–06 season. Antonio Conte is the only manager in Premier League history to have won the award in three successive months (with Chelsea from October to December 2016). The award has been shared on one occasion, in March 2002, when Liverpool manager Gérard Houllier was jointly awarded Manager of the Month with caretaker manager Phil Thompson, who had deputised while Houllier was absent for medical reasons.|$|E
