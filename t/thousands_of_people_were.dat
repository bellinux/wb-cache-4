In Manzanillo, Colima, 40 percent of all homes were destroyed, and four ships in the harbor were sunk. Large {{portions}} of Colima and Jalisco were isolated by flooding. Hundreds of people were stranded. Minatitlán, Colima, suffered especially, as 800people out of its population of 1000 were dead or missing, according to a message sent to President Adolfo López Mateos.

About 8,000residents of the city of Álamo were rendered homeless. Flooding in Poza Rica forced the rescue of dozens of people from their cars and homes. Several homes in the city were swept away, while debris such as tree branches and trash blocked water runoff. Water, mudslides, and rocks blocked numerous roads in the area. In combination with Hurricane Kristy in the Pacific Ocean, approximately 50,000people were left homeless in Mexico. At least 20fatalities were attributed to Debby.|$|E

A significant portion of the people deported to Kola were peasants from southern Russia subjected to dekulakization. Prisoner labor was often used when building new factories and for manning those which were operational: in 1940, for example, the whole Severonikel Metallurgy Mining Complex was turned over to the NKVD system.|$|E

5|$|Tropical Storm Rachel was {{the only}} {{tropical}} cyclone to make landfall during the 1990 Pacific hurricane season. The twenty-fourth tropical depression and eighteenth named storm, Rachel developed on September27 from a tropical wave southwest of mainland Mexico. After becoming a tropical depression, the system tracked slowly southwestward and eventually curved northwestward. The depression intensified into a tropical storm after three days and was named Rachel by the National Hurricane Center. Rachel continued to steadily strengthen, and peaked as a strong 65mph (100km/h) tropical storm on October2. After attaining peak intensity, Rachel re-curved to make a landfall in southern Baja California Sur {{and again in the}} Mexican Mainland on October3. The storm produced heavy rainfall across northern Mexico and the Southwestern United States. <b>Thousands</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>were</b> left homeless and 18 fatalities were reported.|$|E
5|$|As Prapiroon neared Hong Kong, <b>thousands</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>were</b> {{stranded}} in airports {{as hundreds of}} flights {{in and out of}} the area were cancelled. Twenty cargo containers in the harbour were tipped over and one person was injured by the falling containers. A total of 381 flights were cancelled and 725 were delayed, affecting about 10million people. Compensation costs from the travel delays amounted to $1.9million (2006USD). According to airport authorities, the storm caused the worst disruption in the airport's 20-year history. Winds were recorded up to 103km/h (63mph) in the harbour. The highest gust was recorded on Green Island at 193km/h (119mph). Seven people were injured by objects blown around by the wind. A cargo vessel, with a crew of 23, ran aground near the harbour. No injuries were reported from the incident. Two other incidents with vessels occurred near Ma Wan and Tuen Mun. Seven hundred trees were blown down and another 1,600 sustained damage. Maximum rainfall from Prapiroon was estimated at 8.1in (207.5mm). Two landslides were also reported and about 200 hectares of farmland was damaged. A storm surge of 2.71m (8.89ft) was recorded.|$|E
5|$|Cyclone Fanele {{struck the}} country during a series of {{government}} protests, and consequently the national government provided little response to the storm. Instead, United Nations (UN) agencies quickly provided relief to affected citizens. The World Food Programme prepared 87metric tons (MT) of cereal and 13MT of various types of pulses. Five United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) trucks arrived in Morondova on January25 with various supplies. In {{the days after the}} storm, contaminated floodwaters resulted in cases of dysentery. To prevent the spread of disease, UNICEF provided vaccines, de-worming tablets, and water cleaning devices. Within three days of the storm's landfall, the agency also began distributing health kits and bed nets. As many schools were affected, UNICEF set up temporary classrooms in tents, while workers began fixing and cleaning the damaged buildings. Despite the quick response by the UN, <b>thousands</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>were</b> left without aid. The Malagasy Red Cross deployed its volunteers to affected areas, although disrupted transportation services and the political situation hindered relief efforts.|$|E

5|$|Five Days at Memorial: Life and Death in a Storm-Ravaged Hospital is a 2013 non-fiction book by the American {{journalist}} Sheri Fink. The book {{details the}} aftermath of Hurricane Katrina at Memorial Medical Center in New Orleans in August 2005, and is an expansion of a Pulitzer Prize-winning article written by Fink and published in The New York Times Magazine in 2009. It describes the events that took place at Memorial Medical Center over five days as <b>thousands</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>were</b> trapped in the hospital without power. The triage system put into effect deprioritized critically ill patients for evacuation, {{and a number of}} these patients were euthanized by medical and nursing staff shortly before the entire hospital was evacuated on the fifth day of the crisis. Fink examines the legal and political consequences of the decision to euthanize patients and the ethical issues surrounding euthanasia and health care in disaster scenarios. The book was well received by most critics and won three awards, including a National Book Critics Circle Award for non-fiction.|$|E
5|$|On 6 June 1944, American, British and Canadian forces {{established}} a western front with the D-Day landings in Normandy. On 20 July 1944, Hitler narrowly survived a bomb attack. He ordered brutal reprisals, resulting in 7,000arrests and {{the execution of}} more than 4,900people. The failed Ardennes Offensive (16 December 1944– 25 January 1945) was the last major German campaign of the war as Soviet forces entered Germany on 27 January. Hitler's refusal to admit defeat and his repeated insistence that the war be fought to the last man led to unnecessary death and destruction in the closing months of the war. Through his Justice Minister Otto Georg Thierack, Hitler ordered that anyone who {{was not prepared to}} fight should be summarily court-martialed and <b>thousands</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>were</b> put to death. In many areas, people looked for ways to surrender to the approaching Allies in spite of exhortations of local leaders to continue the struggle. Hitler also ordered the intentional destruction of transport, bridges, industries and other infrastructure—a scorched earth decree—but Armaments Minister Albert Speer was able to keep this order from being fully carried out.|$|E
5|$|In Pennsylvania, washed-out {{rail lines}} {{prevented}} operation along the Delaware, Lackawanna and Western Railroad for several weeks, and lines reopened after about two months. The expense of reopening, {{and the loss}} of being closed, led to the railroad merging with the Erie Railroad to become the Erie Lackawanna Railway in 1960. One stranded train along the line prompted a helicopter to rescue 235people. Flooding along the Lehigh River destroyed 15industrial plants, which left more than 15,000people near Allentown, Pennsylvania without work temporarily. The mayor of Scranton {{declared a state of emergency}} due to the floods, ordering all businesses to close. United States Army soldiers provided water to residents after the town lost its water supply. Elsewhere, the Pennsylvania National Guard was on duty on streets in damaged towns, including 50 to prevent looting in Upper Black Eddy, which was one of the hardest hit towns. Helicopters assisted in discovering bodies at Camp Davis, where many deaths occurred during the storm. Statewide, <b>thousands</b> <b>of</b> <b>people</b> <b>were</b> left homeless. In Stroudsburg, there was a food shortage, and officials enacted a curfew, after reports of looting. In the same city, water was shipped in milk cartons to the flood victims, which later inspired a Federal Civil Defense Administration proposal to use water packaged in milk containers in the event of a nuclear attack. The state government implemented a tax on cigarettes to help pay for storm damage, which lasted for about two years; this was partially due to a lack of significant funding from the federal government. Pennsylvania also enacted an increase in the gasoline tax that was later made permanent to pay for the Interstate Highway System. The two taxes, each an increase of 1penny, totaled $71million, a part of which was set aside for future disasters. The experience of the storm's aftermath provided the basis for the aftermath for Hurricane Agnes in 1972. In New Jersey, Governor Robert B. Meyner declared the floods as at the time the state's worst natural disaster.|$|E
