25|$|How {{far south}} {{the area of}} Sami {{population}} in Norway extended in the past, is an uncertain topic, and is currently debated among historians and archeologists. The Norwegian historian Yngvar Nielsen was commissioned by the Norwegian government in 1889 to determine <b>this</b> <b>question</b> <b>in</b> order to settle the contemporary question of Sami land rights. He concluded that the Sami had lived no further south than Lierne in Nord-Trøndelag county until around 1500, when they had started moving south, reaching the area around Lake Femunden in the 18th century. This hypothesis is still accepted among many historians, but {{has been the subject}} of scholarly debate in the 21st century. In favour of Nielsen's view, it is pointed out that no Sami settlement to the south of Lierne in medieval times has left any traces in written sources. This argument is countered by pointing out that the Sami culture was nomadic and non-literary, and as such would not be expected to leave written sources. In recent years, the number of archaeological finds that are interpreted as indicating a Sami presence in Southern Norway in the Middle Ages, has increased. These include foundations in Lesja, in Vang in Valdres and in Hol and Ål in Hallingdal. Proponents of the Sami interpretations of these finds assume a mixed populations of Norse and Sami people in the mountainous areas of Southern Norway in the Middle Ages.|$|E

Tolman's theories about [...] "cognitive maps" [...] in humans and animals. [...] O'Keefe and his student Dostrovsky in 1971 discovered neurons in the rat hippocampus that appeared to them to show activity related to the rat's location within its environment. [...] Despite skepticism from other investigators, O'Keefe and his co-workers, especially Lynn Nadel, continued to investigate <b>this</b> <b>question,</b> <b>in</b> a line of work that eventually led to their very influential 1978 book The Hippocampus as a Cognitive Map. [...] There is now almost universal agreement that hippocampal function {{plays an important role}} in spatial coding, but the details are widely debated.|$|E

500|$|Over time, a split of {{authority}} grew among lower courts {{with regard to}} whether the Fourth Amendment's exigent circumstances exception allowed officers to always conduct warrantless blood tests on individuals suspected of {{driving under the influence}} of alcohol because evidence of alcohol was being destroyed by the body's natural metabolic processes. States that recognized this per se exigency argued that [...] "nce police arrest a suspect for drunk driving, each passing minute eliminates probative evidence of the crime." [...] In 2012, the Court granted review in Missouri v. McNeely to resolve <b>this</b> <b>question.</b> <b>In</b> a 5–4 opinion, the Court rejected the theory that the natural dissipation of blood alcohol constituted a per se exigency. Instead, the court affirmed the basic principle from Schmerber that absent [...] "an emergency that justifie acting without a warrant," [...] police may not conduct warrantless blood testing on suspects. Consequently, exigency in drunk driving cases [...] "must be determined case by case based on the totality of the circumstances." ...|$|E

Connecticut the Court had held that a right to privacy was implicit in the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution. In Bowers, the Court held that this right did not extend to private, consensual sexual conduct, at least insofar as it involved homosexual sex. The majority opinion in Bowers, written by Justice Byron White, framed the legal question as whether the constitution confers “a fundamental right upon homosexuals to engage in sodomy.” The opinion answered <b>this</b> <b>question</b> <b>in</b> the negative, stating that “to claim that a right to engage in such conduct is ‘deeply rooted in this Nation’s history and tradition’ or ‘implicit {{in the concept of}} ordered liberty’ is, at best, facetious.” ...|$|E

He argued that countries like US, Japan, UK, Germany and Netherlands have abandoned EVMs and are using paper-ballot system and demanded that a printed receipt {{should be given to}} every voter after casting the vote. His PIL to investigate the working of EVM was dismissed by the Delhi High Court on 17 January 2012. The court refused to give any direction to the Election Commission to bring back paper-ballot system or use of printed receipts. The Commission argued that the use of paper is not feasible due to the huge size of Indian electorate. The court further asked the Election Commission to [...] "immediately begin a process of wider consultations" [...] and the Parliament [...] "to go into <b>this</b> <b>question</b> <b>in</b> depth and decide".|$|E
2500|$|It was Brouwer, finally, {{who gave}} the theorem its first patent of nobility. His goals were {{different}} from those of Poincaré. This mathematician was inspired by the foundations of mathematics, especially mathematical logic and topology. His initial interest lay in an attempt to solve Hilbert's fifth problem. In 1909, during a voyage to Paris, he met Henri Poincaré, Jacques Hadamard, and Émile Borel. The ensuing discussions convinced Brouwer of the importance of a better understanding of Euclidean spaces, and were the origin of a fruitful exchange of letters with Hadamard. For the next four years, he concentrated on the proof of certain great theorems on <b>this</b> <b>question.</b> <b>In</b> 1912 he proved the hairy ball theorem for the two-dimensional sphere, as well as the fact that every continuous map from the two-dimensional ball to itself has a fixed point. These two results in themselves were not really new. As Hadamard observed, Poincaré had shown a theorem equivalent to the hairy ball theorem. The revolutionary aspect of Brouwer's approach was his systematic use of recently developed tools such as homotopy, the underlying concept of the Poincaré group. In the following year, Hadamard generalised the theorem under discussion to an arbitrary finite dimension, but he employed different methods. Hans Freudenthal comments on the respective roles as follows: [...] "Compared to Brouwer's revolutionary methods, those of Hadamard were very traditional, but Hadamard's participation in the birth of Brouwer's ideas resembles that of a midwife more than that of a mere spectator." ...|$|E
