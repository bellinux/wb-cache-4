5|$|A {{key to this}} matchup was for Ball State {{to force}} Arkansas State quarterback Adam Kennedy to be one-dimensional, {{limiting}} his ability to run the football, and thus forcing him to pass, attacking the Cardinals' defensive strong point, their secondary. For Arkansas State, establishing a rushing attack early and utilizing it often was paramount, as Ball State did not defend against the run particularly well during the regular season, however at the same time, Arkansas State needed to limit turnovers as <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>all</b> season (13 lost all season – seventh nationally); creating them was a strength for Ball State (30 created all season (including 10 in previous 4 games) – seventh nationally).|$|E
5|$|During its {{deployment}} to Iraq, {{the brigade}} undertook many responsibilities, including providing logistics for airdrops and major combat operations including Operation Marne Torch. The brigade {{also created a}} Combat Logistics Patrol academy, training for combat situations during convoy operations, including improvised explosive device detection and removal, and first aid. The brigade also dispatched optometry teams to soldiers {{in the region to}} ensure <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>all</b> the eyesight testing they needed. The brigade returned to the continental United States in early 2008 {{along with the rest of}} the 82d Airborne Division, and was recognized by President George W. Bush in a welcome home speech.|$|E

5|$|In {{preparation}} for {{her marriage to}} Mardjan, Atikah is secluded at home. Learning of this betrothal, Rachmat goes to Doerachman and, after fighting Mardjan and his men, takes the hadji to the village where he and Atikah had initiated development programs. As <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>all</b> worked in Doerachman's name, the villagers do not fear him, but respect him. This, {{and the extent of}} the developments, makes Doerachman realise that hoarding his wealth for himself does not make him as happy as using it for charity. The two, accompanied by Asmadi, hurry back to Doerachman's home, only to find Mardjan and his men sitting relaxedly on the front porch.|$|E
5|$|The company {{adapted the}} old {{gas station and}} café to act as the community's chamber of {{commerce}} and visitor center while preserving the building's architectural features and historical authenticity. Old photographs and interviews with residents were used to aid the company in uncovering the buildings original details. They peeled away decades of paint layers and fabric to find the original interior and exterior colors. One of the more difficult aspects was in restoring the neon accents. While historical photographs showed where neon existed, <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>all</b> been taken during the daytime when the neon lights were off, {{making it difficult to}} determine what color the lights originally were.|$|E
5|$|The {{most likely}} {{theory is that}} Leonidas chose to form a rearguard so that the other Greek contingents could get away. If all the troops had retreated, the open ground beyond the pass would have allowed the Persian cavalry to run the Greeks down. If <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>all</b> {{remained}} at the pass, {{they would have been}} encircled and would eventually have all been killed. By covering the retreat and continuing to block the pass, Leonidas could save more than 3,000 men, who would be able to fight again.|$|E

5|$|Acadians {{continued}} {{to survive in}} the region, overcoming the results of the raids. Scott sailed back to the region to search for Beausoleil and to weaken the Acadians before the winter. He arrived in Moncton near midnight on 12 November, but the tide of the Petitcodiac River prevented him from sending more than twelve men. They came back the next morning with 16 prisoners. Scott was told that the area was virtually defenceless, so he sent three parties to La Chapelle (now Bore Park in Moncton), Silvabro (now Lewisville), and Jagersome (now Dieppe). Scott recorded no deaths or prisoners, but all buildings in sight were burned, and cattle were brought back onto the vessel. Additional raids by Scott between 14 and 17 November captured a dozen Acadian prisoners, burned settlements, and uncovered Beausoleil's own schooner. The crew sent an Acadian prisoner on the 17th to request the surrender of the remaining residents, but when he returned, he reported that <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>all</b> begun to flee to Cocagne, Shediac, and the settlements around the Miramichi River. This prompted Scott to return to Fort Frederick in Saint John.|$|E
5|$|Dobell {{launched}} the Second Battle of Gaza in April 1917 {{with a full}} scale frontal assault supported by naval gunfire, tanks and poison gas. It ended even more unsatisfactorily, and Dobell was relieved of command of Eastern Force on 19 April. His place was taken by Chetwode, while Chauvel took over the Desert Column, thereby becoming the first Australian to reach the rank of lieutenant general. Command of the Anzac Mounted Division passed to Chaytor. In June, during the Stalemate in Southern Palestine, General Sir Edmund Allenby took over the EEF from Murray. Allenby moved his headquarters to Palestine and re-organised his command along more regular lines. Eastern Force was abolished and two corps headquarters were formed, XX Corps under Chetwode and XXI Corps under Lieutenant General Edward Bulfin. The three corps commanders were professional soldiers, none of whom had graduated from a military college or a staff college, <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>all</b> been commissioned from the militia or volunteers.|$|E
5|$|During {{their brief}} existence, Wicked Lester {{performed}} in public twice. The first show {{took place at}} the Rivoli Theatre in South Fallsburg, New York on April 23, 1971. The second, in late summer 1971, was at an Atlantic City, New Jersey hotel hosting a B'nai B'rith Youth Organization event. Not long after that show, the band suffered a major setback when <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>all</b> of their musical gear stolen. After a chance meeting with Electric Lady Studios engineer Ron Johnsen, Wicked Lester was given the opportunity to record some demos in late 1971. Johnsen, who produced the demo tape, shopped it to a few labels, with no success. Eventually the tape was screened by Epic Records, who purchased the masters and agreed to fund the recording of a full album. One of the conditions, however, was that Stephen Coronel be fired and replaced with a better guitarist.|$|E

5|$|Financial aid and {{incentives}} did not deliver {{the expected results}} for the hajduks, as they {{did not wish to}} settle in the assigned lands. Conflicts ensued between the hajduks and local people in Puljština, with kidnappings, hajduk attacks on fishermen and boats, and also revenge killings. The hajduks were enraged, and could not cope with the Istrian climate. Many of them moved to Senj, where the Uskoks were still active. During this time, Pivljanin and Njegošević were the most active in moving hajduks into the Habsburg Monarchy, and they travelled to Karlovac to negotiate. Some hajduks independently returned to the Bay of Kotor, where the provveditore of Kotor put some on galleys, imprisoned some at Klis, and exiled some, after killing others using old convictions as a pretext. When harambaša Njegošević was persecuted, the hajduks again sent Pivljanin to Venice as their envoy. In his plea to the Doge of Venice, dated 27March 1673, Pivljanin asked that the persecution of hajduks cease, stating that <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>all</b> been pardoned by an amnesty issued by Barbaro. The request was partly met, and some hajduks were freed.|$|E
5|$|The {{previous}} {{title in}} the series, Fire Emblem Awakening, was planned {{to be the last}} in the series due to decreasing sales. The game was a worldwide commercial success, prompting Nintendo to greenlight a new entry. Fates was co-developed by regular Fire Emblem developer Intelligent Systems and Nintendo SPD, with the main staff of Awakening returning to their respective roles for Fates: they were Intelligence System's Kouhei Maeda as director, Nintendo SPD director Genki Yokota, Nintendo producer Hitoshi Yamagami, art director Toshiyuki Kusakihara, and character designer Yūsuke Kozaki. Yokota's work on the game ran parallel with his work on Xenoblade Chronicles X. Masahiro Higuchi, Awakenings project manager, came on board as a producer. According to the original staff, the request for a sequel was a shock as <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>all</b> developed Awakening assuming it would be the last in the series. During its early design stages, Fates was given the working title Fire Emblem 3DS II. The game's cutscenes were animated by Studio Anima, while storyboarding was handled by Spooky Graphic. To develop the multiple versions, one core team worked on the game's shared assets, while additional teams handled individual level design.|$|E
5|$|The {{program was}} founded on the Monterey Peninsula, California, in 1958 by Dr. Béla H. Bánáthy, a Hungarian {{immigrant}} who taught at the language school. In the 21st century, there are two programs in California: one in Concord, sponsored by the White Stag Association, and one in Monterey, sponsored by the White Stag Leadership Development Academy. Bánáthy drew from his youth experience at the 1933 World Jamboree in Gödöllő, Hungary; he named the program after the mythological white stag used as an emblem at the jamboree. Years later, in June 1951 Bánáthy met two other Hungarians teaching at the Army Language School. <b>They</b> <b>had</b> <b>all</b> escaped Hungary before Soviet occupation, Joe Szentkiralyi and Paul Sujan, who had also attended the 1933 World Jamboree.

5|$|Đính's {{political}} stay was brief, as General Nguyễn Khánh, who was disgruntled at {{not receiving}} a high position after Diệm's removal, deposed the MRC {{with the support}} of Khiệm on 30 January 1964, without firing a shot. Khánh used the coup to exact retribution against Generals Đôn, Đính, Xuan and Lê Văn Kim. Khánh had them arrested, claiming that {{they were part of a}} neutralist plot with the French government of President Charles de Gaulle to make a peace deal with North Vietnam that would not end communism. Khánh noted <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>all</b> served in the French-backed VNA prior to 1955, although he had as well. He also accused the four generals of discussing such a plan with some visiting politicians from de Gaulle's party during a dinner, although Đính and his accused colleagues denied that the meeting was anything more than social. The generals were flown to Mỹ Khe beach, near Đà Nẵng.|$|E
5|$|In 1970, {{ten years}} {{prior to the start of}} the game, {{suspected}} serial killer Yō Haibara kidnapped five girls from their rooms in a sanatorium on Rougetsu, an island south of Honshu. The girls were rescued from a cavern beneath the sanatorium by detective Chōshirō Kirishima, who had been pursuing Haibara, but <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>all</b> lost their memories. Two years later, a catastrophe strikes Rougetsu Island which kills off the inhabitants. Eight years later, in the present, two of the rescued girls have died in mysterious circumstances and two of the survivors, Misaki Asō and Madoka Tsukimori, return to discover the truth about their pasts. Despite being warned by her mother not to return to the island, fellow survivor Ruka Minazuki goes there to find Misaki and Madoka. Shortly before Ruka's arrival, Madoka is killed by hostile spirits. Chōshirō, the detective who rescued them, also returns to the island to both find Ruka and continue his pursuit of Haibara. During her exploration, Ruka learns that she and Misaki are suffering from a malady known as the Hidden Moon Disease, which affects their memories and identity and is spread by touch and vision. Each character also collects pieces of a mask used in a local ritual dance to ease the passing of souls into the afterlife. During the course of the story, it is revealed that Misaki arranged their return to the island so their illness might be cured, and that Chōshirō himself died ten years before, and is now helping the girls guided by the benevolent spirit of Ruka's mother Sayaka.|$|E
5|$|The Mark III Mod 0 Fat Man {{was ordered}} {{to be put into}} {{production}} in mid-1946. High explosives were manufactured by the Salt Wells Pilot Plant, which had been established by the Manhattan Project as part of Project Camel. A new plant was established at the Iowa Army Ordnance Plant. Mechanical components were made or procured by the Rock Island Arsenal. Electrical and mechanical components for about 50 bombs were stockpiled at Kirtland Army Air Field by August 1946, but only nine plutonium cores were available. Production of the Mod 0 ended in December 1948, by which time there were still only 53 cores available. It was replaced by improved versions, known as Mods 1 and 2, which contained a number of minor changes, the most important of which was that they did not charge the X-Unit firing system's capacitors until released from the aircraft. The Mod 0s were withdrawn from service between March and July 1949, and by October <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>all</b> been rebuilt as Mods 1 and 2. Some 120 Mark III Fat Man units were added to the stockpile between 1947 and 1949, when it was superseded by the Mark 4 nuclear bomb. The Mark III Fat Man was retired in 1950.|$|E

5|$|The airline {{was founded}} by {{shipowner}} Ludvig G. Braathen and initially flew to destinations in Asia. The original fleet consisted of Douglas aircraft; these were first used for long-haul flights, but were gradually shifted for use in medium- and short-haul charter services. The airline started domestic services in 1954, with all its scheduled routes flown domestically until 1987. However, it continued to fly charter services from both Norway and Sweden, mostly to the Mediterranean. For Norwegian routes, Braathens first used a fleet of Herons, which were replaced with the Fokker F27 from 1958. The airline became the launch customer of the Fokker F28 in 1969 and also took delivery of Boeing 737-200 aircraft. The jet aircraft were at first used for charter, but later also for domestic services. All later deliveries would consist of Boeing aircraft, and after 1977 Braathens operated only jets. Between 1986 and 1989 the airline operated only the 737-200. By 1994, <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>all</b> been replaced with 737-400 and -500. Braathens entered the Swedish internal market in 1997 by purchasing Transwede and Malmö Aviation. This gave the airline {{a wider range of}} aircraft, including the 737-700, Fokker 100 and BAe 146. The losses suffered under a price war with Scandinavian Airlines (SAS) and Color Air in 1998 and 1999 caused the airline to be taken over by the SAS Group in 2001. Braathens and SAS Norway merged to form SAS Braathens in 2004.|$|E
