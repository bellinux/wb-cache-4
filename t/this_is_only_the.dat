25|$|A. fulvescens {{refers to}} the sexual state, or teleomorph, of the organism. Chrysosporium keratinophilum is {{regarded}} by some mycologists as the asexual state, or anamorph, however others argue that <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>only</b> <b>the</b> asexual state of Aphanoascus keratinophilus. Aphanoascus fulvescens, Aphanoascus terreus, Aphanoascus canadensis, Aphanoascus reticulisporus, and Keratinophyton durum or Anixiopsis biplanata are the species that are currently accepted under the genus Aphanoascus.|$|E

25|$|In {{addition}} to the input statistics, Croatian NGOs GONG and Transparency International Croatia have decided to hire a media analysis agency which calculated {{the amount of money}} that was necessarily spent on advertising on television, radio and print media.

25|$|Students usually sit at tables, not desks (usually two at one table), {{sometimes}} {{arranged in}} a semicircle or another geometric or functional shape. During exams in classrooms, the tables are sometimes arranged in columns with one pupil per table (if permitted by the room's capacities) {{in order to prevent}} cheating; at many schools, <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>only</b> <b>the</b> case for some exams in the two final years of school, i.e. some of the exams counting for the final grade on the high school diploma.|$|E

25|$|While hiring {{discrimination}} {{is the most}} highly visible aspect of economic discrimination, it is often the most uncommon. Increasingly strong measures against discrimination have made hiring discrimination {{much more difficult for}} employers to engage in. However <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>only</b> <b>the</b> case in formal hiring arrangements, with corporations or others subject to public scrutiny and overview. Private hiring, such as apprenticeships of electricians, plumbers, carpenters, and other trades is almost entirely broken down along racial lines, with almost no women in these fields and most minorities training those of their own race.|$|E
25|$|After the battle, Gandalf warns Aragorn that <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>only</b> <b>the</b> {{beginning}} of hostilities. However, {{he points out}} that Sauron fears Aragorn, as he knows of Aragorn's bloodline, and that he can inspire the men of Gondor. He also says the forces of good have one major advantage over Sauron; the Ring is hidden, and that they should attempt to destroy it has not entered Sauron's mind. He expects them {{to use it as a}} weapon, never imagining it is being brought closer to him every day.|$|E
25|$|The Priory Church of St Peter {{with its}} monastery (Dunstable Priory) {{was founded in}} 1132 by Henry I for Augustinian Canons in Dunstable, Bedfordshire, England. St Peter’s today is a large and {{impressive}} building, but <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>only</b> <b>the</b> nave of what remains of an originally much larger Augustinian priory church. The monastic buildings consisted of a dormitory for the monks, an infirmary, stables, workshops, bakehouse, brewhouse and buttery. There was also a hostel for pilgrims and travellers, the remains of which is known today as Priory House. Opposite the Priory {{was one of the}} royal palaces belonging to Henry I, known as Kingsbury.|$|E

25|$|Plants in {{the area}} {{typically}} have large responses to the change in climate with each season. Monsoon season is the largest of these effects, with leaf buds following {{only a few months}} after the rains begin. Flowering season occurs in the months preceding the summer monsoon. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>only</b> <b>the</b> peak flowering season, with plants flowering throughout the year. Due to the early flowering, fruit is ripe and seeds are dispersed at the beginning of the rains. There are also areas where plants have little response to the seasons, particularly those areas that experience moist conditions, caused by the elevations. These plants may maintain leaves through times when other areas are in the dry season, during which most deciduous trees have no leaves.|$|E
25|$|Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood was {{developed}} by Ubisoft Montreal. Montreal also worked on both of the other main Assassin's Creed games in the series and was thus chosen to lead production for the third installment. A new Assassin's Creed episode featuring multiplayer was announced during Ubisoft's 2009 fiscal third quarter results while not revealing its name. In early May 2010, a GameStop employee published on the internet some images of a pre-order box featuring the Assassin's Creed: Brotherhood title while Ubisoft was teasing the game on Facebook and Twitter. Ubisoft then confirmed the authenticity of these pictures. Brotherhood has not been numbered unlike Assassin's Creed II because players, and even developers themselves would have expected a new setting and a new ancestor while <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>only</b> <b>the</b> continuation of Ezio's story.|$|E
25|$|To {{judge by}} the {{accounts}} of wholesale massacres in 115 BCE, the number of Jewish residents in Cyrenaica, Cyprus, and Mesopotamia was also large. At the commencement {{of the reign of}} Caesar Augustus, there were over 7,000 Jews in Rome (though <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>only</b> <b>the</b> number that is said to have escorted the envoys who came to demand the deposition of Archelaus; compare: Bringmann: Klaus: Geschichte der Juden im Altertum, Stuttgart 2005, S. 202. Bringmann talks about 8,000 Jews who lived in the city of Rome.). Many sources say that the Jews constituted a full one-tenth (10%) {{of the population of the}} ancient city of Rome itself. Finally, if the sums confiscated by the governor Lucius Valerius Flaccus in the year 62/61 BCE represented the tax of a didrachma per head for a single year, it would imply that the Jewish population of Asia Minor numbered 45,000 adult males, for a total of at least 180,000 persons.|$|E

25|$|Boa constrictors are ovoviviparous, {{giving birth}} to live young. They {{generally}} breed in the dry season—between April and August—and are polygynous, thus males may mate with multiple females. Half of all females breed in a given year, and {{a larger percentage of}} males actively attempt to locate a mate. Due to their polygynous nature, many of these males will be unsuccessful. As such, female boas in inadequate physical condition are unlikely to attempt to mate, or to produce viable young if they do mate. Reproduction in boas is almost exclusively sexual. Males ordinarily have a ZZ pair of sex determining chromosomes, and females a ZW pair. In 2010, a boa constrictor was shown to have reproduced asexually via parthenogenesis. The Colombian Rainbow boa, Epicrates maurus was found to reproduce by facultative parthenogenesis resulting in production of WW female progeny. The WW females were likely produced by terminal automixis (see Figure), a type of parthenogenesis in which two terminal haploid products of meiosis fuse to form a zygote, which then develops into a daughter progeny. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>only</b> <b>the</b> third genetically confirmed case of consecutive virgin births of viable offspring from a single female within any vertebrate lineage.|$|E

500|$|On June 22, 2017, Swanigan {{was drafted}} {{in the first round}} (26th overall) by the Portland Trail Blazers. On July 3, 2017, Swanigan signed with the Portland Trail Blazers. On being drafted, Swanigan said: [...] "Being {{selected}} tonight in the NBA Draft is a dream come true. I have been thinking of this moment for a long time. I know <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>only</b> <b>the</b> first step in my professional career, but I am extremely excited for to begin this journey". Painter said, [...] "We are thrilled that Biggie has achieved his lifelong dream of being selected in the NBA Draft. It’s been an incredibly tough road for him to get to this point and no one deserves it more than he does". Swanigan was the first Purdue basketball player to be drafted at the sophomore level or lower. During the 2017 NBA Summer League, Swanigan recorded 16.1 points, 10.6 rebounds, 2.25 assists and 1.4 steals per game in all eight games the Trail Blazers played in during the event, including the Summer League Championship game, where they ultimately lost to the Los Angeles Lakers. Despite that, Swanigan would earn All-Summer League First Team honors for leading the Trail Blazers into the Summer League Finals.|$|E
