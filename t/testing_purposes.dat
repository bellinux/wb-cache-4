5|$|Little {{is known}} about West Alseks {{subsequent}} civilian career until early 1929. In February of that year, West Alsek, still under USSB ownership, was selected for the addition of pulverized coal-fired boilers for <b>testing</b> <b>purposes.</b> Coal pulverizers would take coal—often cheaper, inferior grades normally unsuitable for marine use—and grind them into coal dust. This dust would then be mixed with air and automatically injected into the boilers {{without the need for}} hand-feeding. West Alsek entered the Todd Brooklyn shipyard to undergo the conversion in late February.|$|E
5|$|By {{this point}} the Air Ministry was desperate to get any unit into service. Satisfied with his visit in May, Dowding {{suggested}} that the Mk. I {{was good enough for}} operational <b>testing</b> <b>purposes.</b> On 11 June 1939, AI was given the highest priority and provisions were made to supply 11 additional Blenheims to No 25 squadron at RAF Hawkinge (for a total of 21). Since each of the parts came from different suppliers, and the fitters were unfamiliar with any of it, members of the AI team would have to hand-assemble the components as they arrived and instruct the fitters on the sets.|$|E

40|$|International audienceThis {{paper is}} about {{generating}} tests from dynamic selection criteria called <b>test</b> <b>purposes,</b> {{in addition to}} structural tests, obtained from static selection criteria. We present a method that re-uses a behavioral model and an abstract test concretization layer developed for structural testing, and relies on additional <b>test</b> <b>purposes.</b> We propose, in the B framework, a process of test generation that uses the symbolic animation mechanisms of Leirios Test Generator (LTG) based on constraint solving, and guided by the <b>test</b> <b>purposes.</b> We build for that a B model that is the synchronized product of a behavioral B abstract model and a <b>test</b> <b>purpose</b> described as a labeled transition system. We prove the correctness of this method, and show some experimental results obtained on the IAS case study. IAS is an industrial smart-card platform dedicated to the operations of Identification, Authentication and electronic Signature. Our experiments show that the tests obtained from <b>test</b> <b>purposes</b> are complementary to the structural tests...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThis paper {{presents}} an approach for {{the generation of}} <b>test</b> <b>purposes</b> {{in the form of}} labelled transition systems from specifications of properties in CTL. The approach is aimed at adapting the model checking process, by extending search algorithms to perform further analysis so that examples and counter-examples can be extracted. An algorithm for the generation of <b>test</b> <b>purposes</b> through analysis over the examples and counter-examples is presented, along with a case study to show the correspondence between the CTL properties and the generated <b>test</b> <b>purposes...</b>|$|R

5|$|During 2002, the Comanche program {{underwent}} heavy restructuring; consequently, {{the number}} of Comanches that were intended to be purchased was dropped down to 650 rotorcraft. At the time, the projected total cost for the full production of the Comanche in such numbers stood at $26.9 billion. Originally, he EMD phase had been planned to last for six years, as well as having involved {{a total of five}} Comanches being constructed to participate in the testing regime. During 2003, production on the third RAH-66, which was intended to be the first EMD-conformant helicopter, was started. Subsequently, eight RAH-66s were to be constructed for operational <b>testing</b> <b>purposes.</b> As planned, the initial production RAH-66s were to be completed to a Block I configuration, which would have included the majority of the rotorcraft's planned weapons and sensors. From the 16th Comanche onwards, deliveries would have been made to the Block II standard, which was to have all of the planned capabilities included.|$|E
5|$|For <b>testing</b> <b>purposes,</b> a {{new engine}} {{consisting}} of six Armstrong Siddeley Viper jet engines blowing across the outer rim of an impeller was designed {{under the name}} PV-704, PV stood for Private Venture. The PV-704 was a stop-gap design built into a bunker-like building behind the Avro Experimental Test facility. It was intended to test various Project 1794 concepts and provide the USAF with test data to show {{the viability of the}} concept. The original plan to initially test the Viper Engine Rig was to have continued into free flight testing. Unfortunately, testing was anything but smooth; the test model suffered from hazardous oil leaks, resulting in three fires. It eventually got to the point that staff were afraid of the machine, even when safely ensconced in a booth constructed of bullet-proof glass and quarter-inch-thick steel. A final, disastrous and nearly lethal engine test in 1956 which involved a Viper jet engine running wild, convinced Frost that a less dangerous test vehicle was necessary.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{addresses}} timed {{test cases}} generation using <b>test</b> <b>purposes</b> given as Message Sequence Charts (MSCs). A <b>test</b> <b>purpose</b> is a partial behaviour {{of the system}} under <b>test.</b> Test <b>purposes</b> are very important in testing because they help {{reduce the number of}} test cases while guaranteeing acceptable faults coverage. The adoption of MSCs as a model for <b>test</b> <b>purposes</b> is very important because they have a graphical representation {{that can be used to}} express clearly what the user wants to test. The approach presented in this paper is fundamentally based on timed input output automata (TIOA) theory.
