For instance, one of these stretches the 50 km distance between Amsterdam and Utrecht.|$|R

However, the Oberkommando der Wehrmacht (German high command; OKW) was convinced that preparations would take at least until the following year. After furious arguments, Hitler reluctantly agreed <b>to</b> <b>wait.</b> <b>In</b> May 1940, three massive German army groups overran France and the Low Countries in little more than six weeks.|$|E

5|$|Ferdinand ordered 400 men {{to enter}} the saps; these men would storm the castle once the mine had been detonated. The {{remainder}} of his cavalry and foot soldiers were <b>to</b> <b>wait</b> <b>in</b> the fields below. Some sources assert that the fuse was lit at around 1:00 pm, although the 19th-century local historian Heinrich Joseph Floß argued that these sources are mistaken, and that the explosion clearly occurred in the morning. All sources agree that the explosion, with a dreadful crack, propelled chunks of the towers and walls high into the air. Almost half the Godesburg collapsed instantly. According to a newspaper report dated 13 January 1584, debris raining on the valley below damaged several houses, and destroyed some of them completely.|$|E

5|$|The third Chinook carried {{half of the}} {{enhanced}} A Company group from 1 PARA to Magbeni. The helicopter hovered low above the landing zone that had been identified by the second SAS observation team and the paras jumped from the rear ramp. The observation team had warned that the ground was wet but {{had been unable to}} determine the depth of the water, so the paras were surprised to find themselves jumping into a chest-deep swamp. The majority of the first group immediately waded through the swamp to get to the nearby tree line and from there to the village, but a small party tasked with securing the landing zone had <b>to</b> <b>wait</b> <b>in</b> the swamp for the Chinook to pick up the remaining members of the company group and return to insert them at the landing zone.|$|E
5|$|During a {{party at}} the {{community}} centre, Fatboy smuggles in alcohol and kisses Denise Fox (Diane Parish), angering her husband Lucas (Don Gilet), who throws Fatboy out and begins angrily preaching to him. This causes Fatboy to argue with Mercy. During the argument, Mercy pushes him and he falls onto a tree in the Square's gardens planted in memory of Lucas's ex-wife Trina (Sharon Duncan Brewster), snapping it. Fatboy enlists the help of Mercy, Leon and ZsaZsa to replace it, but as they dig it up, they uncover a dead body, that of Denise's ex-husband Owen Turner (Lee Ross), who Lucas murdered eight months previously. The next day, Fatboy comforts Mercy and to cheer her up, they play rounders. However, they smash Dot Branning's (June Brown) window and she makes Fatboy fix it. He does a bad job so she insists he pay for a professional, asking Fatboy <b>to</b> <b>wait</b> <b>in</b> her house for the professional to arrive. While he waits, he plays dominoes with Dot's husband Jim (John Bardon) and when Dot returns, she is impressed with Fatboy's politeness when he offers to clean the new window and make her a cup of tea.|$|E

5|$|On July 5, 2009, the G {{was once}} again {{extended}} south at all times to Church Avenue. This was required for overhaul of the Culver Viaduct, which caused the express tracks at Smith–Ninth Streets and Fourth Avenue/Ninth Street—used to switch G trains between tracks after they terminated at Smith–Ninth Streets—to be temporarily taken out of service. This had several benefits. First, five stations previously served by only the F train had more frequent service. Additionally, riders from northern Brooklyn and Long Island City had a direct route to Kensington. Finally, since the Church Avenue terminal had four tracks to store terminating G trains, as opposed to only one storage track at Smith–9th Streets, this reduced delays on both services because terminating G trains could switch to the storage tracks without having <b>to</b> <b>wait</b> <b>in</b> the station for another train to leave, as had occurred at Smith–Ninth Street. On July 19, 2012, MTA officials made this extension permanent because it provided more direct connections between Kensington and north Brooklyn.|$|E
5|$|Wanting {{to reunite}} with Victoria, Victor tricks Emily into taking {{him back to}} the Land of the Living by pretending he wants her to meet his parents. She agrees to this and takes him to see Elder Gutknecht, the kindly ruler of the underworld, to return Victor and Emily {{temporarily}} to the Land of the Living. Once back home, Victor asks Emily <b>to</b> <b>wait</b> <b>in</b> the forest while he rushes off to see Victoria and confess his wish to marry her as soon as possible, to which she gladly returns his feelings. Just as they are about to share a kiss, Emily arrives and sees the two of them together. Feeling betrayed and hurt, she angrily drags Victor back to the Land of the Dead. Victoria tells her parents that Victor has been forcibly wed to a dead woman, but no one believes her. With Victor gone, Victoria's parents decide to marry her off against her will to a presumed-wealthy newcomer in town named Lord Barkis Bittern, who appeared at the wedding rehearsal.|$|E
5|$|Final Fantasy V was {{directed}} by Final Fantasy series creator Hironobu Sakaguchi who, prior {{to the release of}} Final Fantasy IX, called it his favorite Final Fantasy game. The character, image, and title logo designs were created by series illustrator and image designer Yoshitaka Amano, while the actual character sprites were designed by Kazuko Shibuya. The monsters were designed by Tetsuya Nomura. Amano has stated that he counts his depictions of both Faris from Final Fantasy V and Terra from Final Fantasy VI among his favorite Final Fantasy designs. The writing of the scenario text was a collaborative effort between Sakaguchi and Yoshinori Kitase. Sakaguchi conceived the plot and was in charge of it, while Kitase tried to include more humor to lighten up the relatively serious story. The Job System was designed by Hiroyuki Ito, who worked on the game as a battle planner alongside Akihiko Matsui. Mode7 effects were used in the airship sequences, which moving in the airship would cause the planet to rotate on its axis. In total, Square employed a team of 45 people to create the game, and 16Mbits of space were used to accommodate for the sprites, animations, and detailed background. According to GamePro in a May1993 issue, the Japanese authorities had asked Square not to release the game during a school day because schoolchildren would skip class <b>to</b> <b>wait</b> <b>in</b> line for the game.|$|E

5000|$|In the New York City area, [...] "on line" [...] (two words) {{refers to}} the state of <b>waiting</b> <b>in</b> a line or queue; for example, {{standing}} on a sidewalk waiting for a table at a restaurant. Elsewhere <b>in</b> AmE, one <b>waits</b> [...] "in line". In BrE and AmE, going [...] "online" [...] (one word) refers to using the Internet.

In BrE, queue is the universal term and no variants of line are used <b>in</b> relation <b>to</b> <b>waiting</b> <b>in</b> turn. In BrE, people talk of standing in a queue, queuing up, joining the queue, sitting in a queue (for example, when driving) and simply queuing; Britons may be confused by the expression [...] "in line", thinking that a row rather than a column of people is meant.|$|R
