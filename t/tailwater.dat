25|$|Fishing {{has always}} been popular in Arkansas, and the sport and the state {{have benefited from the}} {{creation}} of reservoirs across the state. Following the completion of Norfork Dam, the Norfork <b>Tailwater</b> and the White River have become a destination for trout fishers. Several smaller retirement communities such as Bull Shoals, Hot Springs Village, and Fairfield Bay have flourished due to their position on a fishing lake. The Buffalo National River has been preserved in its natural state by the National Park Service and is frequented by fly fishers annually.|$|E
500|$|In {{regulations}} {{adopted in}} 1985 and amended in 2008, New York's Department of Environmental Conservation (DEC) divides the river into four water-quality regions {{similar to those}} in the 1983 USGS study. The first [...] from the Saw Mill's mouth is affected by the Hudson's tides and thus is often salty like the river at that point. It is considered Saline Class B surface water, to be kept suitable for primary and secondary contact recreation such as swimming, boating and fishing, and capable of supporting [...] "fish, shellfish and wildlife propagation and survival." [...] The next section extends to the <b>tailwater</b> at the Yonkers sewage plant impoundment, and is Class C fresh water, with the same purposes, to the extent that [...] "other factors" [...] do not limit them. From there to the Woodlands Lake inlet is the third section, designated as Class A fresh water, to be kept clean enough for drinking. The remainder to the source is the fourth section, designated Class B, or fresh water kept to the same standards as the salt water above the river's mouth. Tributaries, named and unnamed, and subtributaries are generally held to the same standards as the section into which they drain.|$|E

[...] The barrier, made up of dragon's teeth and a deep ditch, spans the Rhône valley north of Saint-Maurice. The Courset stream runs in the ditch. The <b>tailwater</b> stream from the Lavey hydroelectric station affords an additional barrier, while the power station is itself fortified, with covering fire from the Fort de Cindey.|$|E
2500|$|Beech Fork State Park is in Cabell County and Wayne County, West Virginia, roughly [...] {{south of}} {{downtown}} Huntington. The park {{is on the}} <b>tailwater</b> shores of Beech Fork Lake, a flood control impoundment of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers on the Beech Fork of Twelvepole Creek. Since its development in the mid 1970s, Beech Fork State Park {{has proven to be}} a popular recreation spot for the residents of nearby Barboursville and Huntington, as well as those living in the surrounding region. The park is about [...] south of the Hal Greer exit (Exit 11) of Interstate 64. Access to the park is also available from Exits 8, 15, and 20 of I-64. The Beech Fork Lake Dam and Marina are about a 20-mile (40 minute) drive from the park.|$|E

5000|$|Fishing {{for trout}} is {{popular in the}} upper {{portions}} of the river from the Beaver Lake <b>tailwaters</b> in northwestern Arkansas, through its course through southwest Missouri(including all of Lake Taneycomo), and back down through Arkansas to the Highway 58 bridge in Guion. The river has long been ranked {{one of the top}} trout fisheries in the country. Fishing is popular in these waters for a number of trout species including rainbow, brown, and cutthroat trout. [...] A number of trout fishing resorts lie on the <b>tailwaters</b> of Bull Shoals Lake and the North Fork River. Fishing for white bass is also popular in these waters.|$|R
50|$|The Norfork <b>Tailwater</b> is {{the segment}} of the North Fork River below Norfork Dam in north central Arkansas.

The Norfork <b>Tailwater</b> is home to brown, rainbow, cutthroat, and brook trout, {{as well as other}} fish. A trout hatchery (the Norfork National Fish Hatchery) near Quarry Park keeps the <b>tailwater</b> stocked with trout, while the dam’s cold water output provides suitable habitat for these cool-water game fish.|$|E

50|$|<b>Tailwater</b> also {{refers to}} surface runoff {{resulting}} from crop irrigation. Irrigation {{practices such as}} flood irrigation and sprinkler irrigation can result in applied water {{in excess of the}} infiltration rate of the soil. Sloped fields can allow for the excess water to run off the field, and discharge to a drainage channel or natural water body. <b>Tailwater</b> can carry pollutants such as silt, nutrients (from fertilizers), and pesticides.|$|E
50|$|Without {{some form}} of equalization, however, the <b>tailwaters</b> would run dry when the {{turbines}} shut down. This would result in extremely low levels of water, causing serious problems for the plants and animals that live {{in and around the}} stream or river.|$|R
50|$|If completed, the dam's {{designed}} {{main purpose}} is to provide protection from {{a failure of the}} unstable Mosul Dam upstream. In addition, the hydroelectric power station would have an installed capacity of 170 MW and the dam would further regulate <b>tailwaters</b> from Mosul Dam.|$|R

5000|$|In general, therefore, {{the power}} station {{operator}} today {{is required to}} regulate the flow {{in order to ensure}} a specified minimum level of water flow into the <b>tailwaters.</b> During periods when the turbines are running (peak current generation) the equalizing basin fills up; during periods when the turbines are shut down, the basin drains gradually.|$|R
5000|$|The dam's {{reservoir}} is {{fed by the}} <b>tailwaters</b> of the Tianshengqiao-I Dam 7 km upstream.

5000|$|<b>Tailwater</b> {{refers to}} waters located {{immediately}} downstream from a hydraulic structure, {{such as a}} dam (excluding minimum release such as for fish water), bridge or culvert.|$|E
50|$|In {{the first}} {{situation}} (Scenario A), the jump is formed {{right at the}} apron, as it would {{if there was no}} downstream control. However, in the next scenario (Scenario B), the downstream <b>tailwater</b> depth has some control imposed on it such that it is less than the conjugate to y1. In this case, the jump travels downstream and initiates at a point where the upstream flow depth (y1’) has risen to the conjugate of the new downstream <b>tailwater</b> depth (yd). This rise from y1 to y1’ is caused by frictional resistance in the channel; and velocity decrease, the depth increase. In this image, y1’ and y2’ represent the conjugate depths of the hydraulic jump where y2’ assumes the depth of yd. In contrast, in the third setup (Scenario C), there is a downstream control that forces the <b>tailwater</b> elevation to a depth above the original conjugate depth. Here, yd is greater than the required depth so the jump is pushed upstream. In this scenario, the sluice gate inhibits the movement of the jump upstream so that the upstream conjugate cannot be attained. This leads to a situation known as a submerged or drowned hydraulic jump. These scenarios demonstrate how influential the role of <b>tailwater</b> is to jump formation and location.|$|E

5000|$|Within the US, {{brown trout}} {{introductions}} have created self-sustaining fisheries throughout the country. Many are considered [...] "world-class" [...] {{such as in}} the Great Lakes and in several Arkansas <b>tailwaters.</b> Outside the US and outside its native range in Europe, introduced brown trout have created [...] "world-class" [...] fisheries in New Zealand, Patagonia and the Falklands.|$|R

5000|$|Great Falls Dam is a {{hydroelectric}} dam on the Caney Fork, {{straddling the}} county line between White County and Warren County in the U.S. state of Tennessee. It {{is the only}} dam outside the Tennessee River watershed {{owned and operated by}} the Tennessee Valley Authority. The dam impounds the 1830 acre Great Falls Lake, and its <b>tailwaters</b> feed into Center Hill Lake. [...] The completion of Great Falls Dam in 1917 was an engineering triumph, marking the first successful attempt to impound the volatile and flood-prone Caney Fork. The dam is also notable for its design, utilizing a mostly underground conduit to carry water from the reservoir via a tributary to the Power House 0.75 mi downstream from the dam. Great Falls Dam is named for the rapids and waterfalls on the Caney Fork downstream from the dam. The section of river below the Power House is world-renowned for whitewater kayaking. The dam and its <b>tailwaters</b> are surrounded by Rock Island State Park.|$|R
