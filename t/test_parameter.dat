As such, there is {{demand for a}} standardized approach to data quality control, as well as interoperability of data among sensor networks. The National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON) has begun constructing their first terrestrial observing sites with 60 locations expected to be distributed across the US by 2017. This will result in over 14 000 automated sensors recording more than > 100 Tb of data per year. These data are then used to create other datasets and subsequent "higher-level" data products. In anticipation of this challenge, an overall data quality assurance plan has been developed and the first suite of data quality control measures defined. This data-driven approach focuses on automated methods for defining a suite of plausibility <b>test</b> <b>parameter</b> thresholds. Specifically, these plausibility tests scrutinize data range, persistence, and stochasticity on each measurement type by employing a suite of binary checks.

While these tests have been used elsewhere, we apply them in a novel approach by calculating their relevant <b>test</b> <b>parameter</b> thresholds.

We investigated their levels and utility in comparison to cancer antigen (CA) 15 - 3 in patients with breast cancer (BC) and in relation to the control groups.

The results demonstrated significant differences in the concentration of the <b>tested</b> <b>parameters</b> and CA 15 - 3 between groups of patients with BC and healthy patients or patients with benign breast tumor. The plasma levels of VEGF and tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase- 1 were significantly higher in advanced tumor stages. The <b>tested</b> <b>parameters</b> were comparable to CA 15 - 3 values of the diagnostic sensitivity, specificity, the predictive values of positive and negative test results, and the area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve.

It supports several coverage criteria for state models, including state coverage, transition coverage, and basic and extended round-trip coverage.

When the state model is modified due to requirements change, the hand-crafted <b>test</b> <b>parameters,</b> if still valid, are automatically reused.

In addition to test code, we also automatically generate state wrapper aspects in AspectJ, which facilitates comparing actual object states to expected states during test execution. This enables the automated verdict of pass/failure for the test cases without need to modify the source code of the class under test.
