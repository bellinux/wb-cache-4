5|$|Although lynchings and racially {{motivated}} murders {{had occurred}} throughout the South for decades, {{the circumstances surrounding}} Emmett Till's murder and the timing acted as a catalyst to attract national attention <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> <b>of</b> a 14-year-old boy who had allegedly been killed for breaching a social caste system. Till's murder aroused feelings about segregation, law enforcement, relations between the North and South, the social status quo in Mississippi, {{the activities of the}} NAACP and the White Citizens' Councils, and the Cold War, all of which were played out in a drama staged in newspapers all over the U.S. and abroad.|$|E

25|$|Atiyah and Singer's first {{published}} proof used K-theory rather than cobordism. If i is any inclusion of compact manifolds from X to Y, they defined a 'pushforward' operation i! on elliptic operators of X to elliptic operators of Y that preserves the index. By taking Y {{to be some}} sphere that X embeds in, this reduces the index theorem <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> <b>of</b> spheres. If Y is a sphere and X is some point embedded in Y, then any elliptic operator on Y is the image under i! of some elliptic operator on the point. This reduces the index theorem <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> <b>of</b> a point, where it is trivial.|$|E
