60|$|She twitched one of {{her long}} glossy braids over her <b>thin</b> <b>shoulder</b> {{and held it up}} before Matthew's eyes. Matthew was not used to {{deciding}} on the tints of ladies' tresses, but in this case there couldn't be much doubt.|$|E
60|$|The Lord of Stoutenburg {{was not a}} man who {{had been}} taught to curb his temper; he had always given way to his passions, {{allowing}} them as the years went on to master every tender feeling within him; for years now he had sacrificed everything to them, to his ambition, to his revenge, to his loves and hates. Now that this fool of a girl tried to thwart him as he thought, he allowed his fury against her full rein, to the exclusion of reason, of prudence, or ordinary instincts of chivalry. He stooped over her like a great, gaunt bird of prey and his thin claw-like hand fastened itself on her <b>thin</b> <b>shoulder.</b>|$|E
6000|$|Catherine Ames {{looked at}} him {{critically}} across the supper table. She loved him in her way, with all her heart, {{but she was not}} in the least blind to his defects. She did not mince matters with herself or with other people. Roger was a sallow, plain-featured fellow, small and insignificant looking. And, as if this were not bad enough, he walked with a slight limp and had one <b>thin</b> <b>shoulder</b> a little higher than the other--"Jarback" [...] Temple he had been called in school, and the name still clung to him. To be sure, he had very fine grey eyes, but their dreamy brilliance gave his dull face an uncanny look which girls did not like, and so made matters rather worse than better. Of course looks didn't matter so much {{in the case of a}} man; Steve Millar was homely enough, and all marked up with smallpox to boot, yet he had got for wife the prettiest and smartest girl in South Bay. But Steve was rich. Roger was poor and always would be. He worked his stony little farm, from which his father and grandfather had wrested a fair living, after a fashion, but Nature had not cut him out for a successful farmer. He hadn't the strength for it and his heart wasn't in it. He'd rather be hanging over a book. Catherine secretly thought Roger's matrimonial chances very poor, but it would not do to discourage the b'y. What he needed was spurring on.|$|E

6000|$|She {{turned her}} face to the fire, gripped her hands upon her elbows, and drew her <b>thin</b> <b>shoulders</b> {{together}} in a shrug. [...] "Ugh!" [...] she said.|$|R

50|$|A {{spaghetti}} strap (also called noodle strap) {{is a very}} <b>thin</b> <b>shoulder</b> strap used {{to support}} clothing, while providing minimal shoulder straps over otherwise bare shoulders. It is commonly used in garments such as swimwear, camisoles, crop tops, bras, cocktail dresses, and evening gowns, so-named for its resemblance to the thin pasta strings called spaghetti.|$|E
5000|$|A sundress is a dress {{intended}} to be worn in warm weather. Typically, it is an informal or casual dress in a lightweight fabric, most commonly cotton, and usually loose-fitting.

A sundress is typically worn without a layering top and is not typically worn over a blouse, sweater or t-shirt.|$|E
60|$|As well as {{she could}} Lily {{explained}} all this to the woman, who lay with her face buried in the girl's lap. Lily's arms were about her <b>thin</b> <b>shoulders</b> in an agony of pity.|$|R

5000|$|In 1929 Chanel {{offered a}} handbag {{inspired}} by soldier's bags. Its <b>thin</b> <b>shoulder</b> strap allowed {{the user to}} have her hands free. Following her comeback, Chanel updated the design in February 1948, creating {{what would become the}} [...] "2.55" [...] (named for the date of its creation). Whilst details of the classic bag have been reworked, such as the 1980s update by Karl Lagerfeld where the clasp and lock were redesigned to incorporate the crossed C's Chanel logo and leather was interlaced through the shoulder chain, the bag has retained its basic form. In 2005, the Chanel firm released an exact replica of the original 1955 bag to commemorate the 50th anniversary of its creation.|$|E
40|$|It {{was a very}} warm, soft spring afternoon. In {{the newly}} green park Miss Harvey felt quite pleased with herself. She had been really daring at the store today. Her replies to the sallies of her companions had smacked of the woman of the world spirit that she so admired and of which she felt herself mistress. She tossed her <b>thin</b> <b>shoulder</b> in a poorly {{executed}} gesture of bold daring...|$|E

60|$|He {{turned into}} the dusky gloom of the shop, {{and sat down at}} the table, rubbing his hands softly. A small, husky sob came from behind a pile of carpets. It was the Hindu child obediently facing towards the wall. His <b>thin</b> <b>shoulders</b> worked with grief.|$|R
6000|$|... "Come now, Stumps," [...] said Slagg, in {{a serious}} voice, as {{he sat down on}} the bed, put an arm round his old comrade's <b>thin</b> <b>shoulders,</b> and made him lie down, [...] "if you go to excite {{yourself}} like that, I'll--I'll--quit the room, an' I won't come back for an hour or more." ...|$|R
60|$|The {{figure was}} slender and almost wizened, the <b>thin</b> <b>shoulders</b> round with an {{habitual}} stoop, the lean shanks were {{encased in a}} pair of much-darned, coarse black stockings. It was the figure of an old man, with a gentle, clear-cut face furrowed by a forest of wrinkles, and surmounted by scanty white locks above a smooth forehead which looked yellow and polished like an ancient piece of ivory.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] she said, [...] "I {{am looking}} rather well, tonight; but don't you think {{effective}} {{would have been}} a better word?" [...] She smiled across her aunt at him out of a cloud of pink, from which her <b>thin</b> <b>shoulders</b> and slender neck emerged, and her arms, gloved to the top, fell into her lap; one of them seemed to terminate naturally in the fan which sensitively shared the inquiescence of her person.|$|R
6000|$|But tonight Anne did {{not feel}} this so keenly. Ruby was strangely quiet. She said not a word about parties and drives and dresses and [...] "fellows." [...] She lay in the hammock, with her {{untouched}} work beside her, and a white shawl wrapped about her <b>thin</b> <b>shoulders.</b> Her long yellow braids of hair--how Anne had envied those beautiful braids in old schooldays!--lay {{on either side of}} her. She had taken the pins out--they made her head ache, she said. The hectic flush was gone for the time, leaving her pale and childlike.|$|R
60|$|Her mother, without replying, {{went out}} to the kitchen. Vera {{followed}} her. Frank, left alone with his father, moved uneasily, and bent his <b>thin</b> <b>shoulders</b> lower over his book. Siegmund remained with his arms on his knees, looking into the grate. From the kitchen came the chinking of crockery, and soon the smell of coffee. All the time Vera was heard chatting with affected brightness to her mother, addressing her in fond tones, using all her wits to recall bright little incidents to retail to her. Beatrice answered rarely, and then with utmost brevity.|$|R
60|$|Two {{little girls}} were {{standing}} in the lane below. The elder, who had spoken in that small, anxious voice, had a pale little face with pointed chin; her hair, the color of over-ripe corn, hung fluffy on her <b>thin</b> <b>shoulders,</b> her flower-like eyes, with something motherly in them already, were the same hue as her pale-blue, almost clean, overall. She had her smaller, chubbier sister by the hand, and, having delivered her message, stood still, gazing up at Tod, as one might at God. Tod dropped his hoe.|$|R
6000|$|He {{shrugged his}} <b>thin</b> <b>shoulders.</b> [...] "Eh bien, mon bon," [...] says he, [...] "I dare swear {{you know your}} own game better than do I." [...] And he cast a look up the stairs, of which I quite missed the meaning. Indeed, I was wholly indifferent. The doctor and his like had passed out of my life, and I {{believed}} they were soon to disappear from our Western Hemisphere. The report I had heard was now confirmed, that his fortune was dissipated, and that he lived entirely off these young rakes who aspired to be macaronies.|$|R
60|$|Mary, {{instead of}} replying, {{suddenly}} sat, or fell, {{down on the}} hay and began to cry. Instantly Faith had flung herself down beside her and {{put her arm around}} the <b>thin,</b> shaking <b>shoulders.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "Charmingly so. Why don't you do {{that sort}} of thing when you can?" [...] {{answered}} her brother, glancing at her <b>thin,</b> bare <b>shoulders,</b> and hands rendered nearly useless by the tightness of the gloves.|$|R
60|$|She {{jumped out}} of bed and hastily wrapped a cloak round her <b>thin</b> girlish <b>shoulders,</b> and slipped her feet into a pair of heelless shoes, then she opened her bedroom door and looked out upon the landing.|$|R
6000|$|... "There, there, don't cry," [...] he said, {{patting her}} <b>thin</b> little <b>shoulder</b> with his big, sunburned paw. [...] "You'll make {{yourself}} sick {{if you go}} on crying, and we can't get along without you at Gull Point Farm." ...|$|R
50|$|Matilda’s {{father is}} a {{rectangular}} man with sharp, <b>thin</b> <b>shoulders</b> who is a doctor, and in fact, asks that he be called, “Doctor.” He serves the rich, and because of this, has one-percentage point interests in many businesses around the country - an accidental fortune. He is a scheming man, and other than a few disagreements between Benn, and the man, no conflicts occur until he attempts {{to take advantage of}} Benn’s uncle, a man who, as executor of the will of the Crader mother, undersold, and unfairly bought the Crader home, selling the land to a company which built a tower there, resulting in millions of dollars of profit for Uncle Vilitzer, and pennies for the Crader children. Because Vilitzer controlled the judge, neither Benn nor Kenneth’s mother received their fair share, and the Doctor hopes to correct this, so that Matilda will have a rich husband.|$|R
6000|$|Carol relaxed, {{and found}} that she was shockingly tired. She had carried them on her <b>thin</b> <b>shoulders.</b> She could not keep it up. She longed for her father, that artist at {{creating}} hysterical parties. She thought of smoking a cigarette, to shock them, and dismissed the obscene thought before it was quite formed. She wondered whether they could for five minutes be coaxed {{to talk about something}} besides the winter top of Knute Stamquist's Ford, and what Al Tingley had said about his mother-in-law. She sighed, [...] "Oh, let 'em alone. I've done enough." [...] She crossed her trousered legs, and snuggled luxuriously above her saucer of ginger; she caught Pollock's congratulatory still smile, and thought well of herself for having thrown a rose light on the pallid lawyer; repented the heretical supposition that any male save her husband existed; jumped up to find Kennicott and whisper, [...] "Happy, my lord? [...] . No, it didn't cost much!" ...|$|R

60|$|Lida was a mite of ten {{and looked}} younger, {{because she was}} such a small, wizened little creature. To-night, as she sidled boldly enough up to the manse girls, {{she looked as if she}} had never been warm since she was born. Her face was purple and her pale-blue, bold little eyes were red and watery. She wore a tattered print dress and a ragged woollen comforter, tied across her <b>thin</b> <b>shoulders</b> and under her arms. She had walked the three miles from the harbour mouth barefooted, over a road where there was still snow and slush and mud. Her feet and legs were as purple as her face. But Lida did not mind this much. She was used to being cold, and she had been going barefooted for a month already, like all the other {{swarming}} young fry of the fishing village. There was no self-pity in her heart as she sat down on the tombstone and grinned cheerfully at Faith and Una. Faith and Una grinned cheerfully back. They knew Lida slightly, having met her once or twice the preceding summer when they had gone down the harbour with the Blythes.|$|R

60|$|He pondered this as {{he walked}} steadily, holding his {{umbrella}} carefully by the wood, just below the crook of the handle, so as to keep the ferule off the ground, and not fray the silk in the middle. And, with his <b>thin,</b> high <b>shoulders</b> stooped, his long legs moving with swift mechanical precision, this passage through the Park, where the sun shone with a clear flame on so much idleness--on so many human evidences of the remorseless battle of Property, raging beyond its ring--was like the flight of some land bird across the sea.|$|R
