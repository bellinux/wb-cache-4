5|$|The Elements of Botany (1836), an {{introductory}} textbook, {{was the first}} of Gray's many works. In this book Gray espoused the idea that botany was useful not only to medicine, but also to farmers. Gray and Torrey published the Flora of North America together in 1838. By the mid-1850s the demands of teaching, research, gardening, collecting, and corresponding had become so great, and he had become so influential, that Gray wrote two high school-level texts in the late 1850s: First Lessons in Botany and Vegetable Physiology (1857) and How Plants Grow: A Simple Introduction to Structural Botany (1858). The publishers pressured Gray to make these two books non-technical enough so <b>that</b> <b>high</b> <b>school</b> students and non-scientists could understand them. As with most scientists in American academic institutions, Gray found it difficult to concentrate purely on research.|$|E
5|$|Zahorchak {{spearheaded the}} {{establishment}} of the Keystone Exams, state-created math, science and social studies tests <b>that</b> <b>high</b> <b>school</b> students would be required to pass a majority of in order to graduate. The measure was met with criticism by the Pennsylvania School Boards Association and others who felt the plan would be expensive and would undermine local school boards' authority to set graduation requirements. The PSBA agreed to support the Keystone Exams under a compromise that schools might not have to give the tests if their own final exams are rigorous enough. The Keystone Exams were approved in 2009 and will first take effect starting with the class of 2015. Zahorchak also established the state's Standards Aligned System, which created a standardized set of diagnostic tests and curriculum guides for local school districts. The standards were aligned to six components: a curriculum framework, assessment systems, best teaching practices, emotional support practices, proven research resources and best interventions for accommodations for children who struggle. Within two years, most public school districts within Pennsylvania were using Standards Aligned System in some form.|$|E

5|$|The Aniplex {{producer}} of Angel Beats!, Hironori Toba, was interviewed in the November 2009 issue of Dengeki G's Magazine, where he commented that a 13-episode anime with about 21 minutes per episode {{was not enough}} to tell the whole story of Angel Beats! Maeda had envisioned. Therefore, the various additional media, such as the illustrated short stories and manga, contain some of the story that was unable to make it into the anime because of time constraints. Toba wanted fans of the series to be able to enjoy it to the fullest by exploring all of the media types. Maeda found it tiring to go back and forth between Osaka and Tokyo for business meetings {{when he was in the}} process of writing the script, and found it difficult to write an entire script by himself, since he had never done that before with any of the games he produced as a member of Key. It was only after the script was done that Maeda was able to work on the music, which he greatly enjoyed and never tired of it. Maeda composed about 15 songs for Girls Dead Monster and spent about two days each composing each song. He made sure to create songs for Girls Dead Monster <b>that</b> <b>high</b> <b>school</b> girls would compose, including the lyrics. Due to this, Maeda pointed out that the opening and ending theme songs for Angel Beats!, which Maeda also composed, sound like they were composed by a different person compared to the Girls Dead Monster songs.|$|E

25|$|The Town of Enfield and its Board of Education {{voted in}} May 2010 for the {{redistricting}} of Enfield Public Schools and {{consolidation of the}} town's two high schools due to decreases in student enrollment. From the 1970s through 2016, the Enfield Public School district consisted of two high schools. During a 2012 study, student population trends projected through the year 2021 showed significant decreases. Enrollment data from the most recent Prowda, Ph.D. Report, released February 19, 2012, indicated <b>that</b> <b>high</b> <b>school</b> age enrollment for the town of Enfield has fallen from 2075 students in 2008 to 1812 students in the recently completed 2011-12 school year. Future Prowda enrollment projections show further declines to 1575 students in 2015 and 1334 students by the year 2020. Enrico Fermi High School opened in 1971 {{not long after the}} present Enfield High School opened due to large graduating classes of the baby boomer generation when double sessions were required and graduating classes exceeded 700 students each session. Graduating sizes for each school today are presently around 200 students. As of 2012, Enfield High School enrolled approximately 800 students while Enrico Fermi High School enrolled approximately 1,000 students.

500|$|Bevel, {{a veteran}} of earlier nonviolent student protests with the Nashville Student Movement and SNCC, had been named SCLC's Director of Direct Action and Nonviolent Education. After {{initiating}} the idea he organized and educated the students in nonviolence tactics and philosophy. King hesitated to approve the use of children, but Bevel believed that children were appropriate for the demonstrations because jail time for them would not hurt families economically {{as much as the}} loss of a working parent. He also saw that adults in the black community were divided about how much support to give the protests. [...] Bevel and the organizers knew <b>that</b> <b>high</b> <b>school</b> students were a more cohesive group; they had been together as classmates since kindergarten.

500|$|His {{family moved}} often {{as his father}} worked at jobs along the West Coast, {{although}} they did not move at all between 1940 and 1949. Settled in Piedmont, California, the Eastwoods lived in a very wealthy part of town, had a swimming pool, belonged to the country club, and each parent drove their own car. Clint attended Piedmont Junior High School. Shortly before he was to enter Piedmont High School, he rode his bike on the school's sports field and tore up the wet turf; this resulted in his being asked not to enroll. Instead, he attended Oakland Technical High School, where he was held back due to poor academic scores and scheduled to graduate in January 1949 as a midyear graduate, {{although it is not}} clear if he ever did. [...] "Clint graduated from the airplane shop. I think that was his major," [...] joked classmate Don Kincade. Another high school friend, Don Loomis, echoed [...] "I don't think he was spending that much time at school because he was having a pretty good time elsewhere."

500|$|Concussions {{are also}} an issue outside of {{professional}} football. In a 2010 study by Purdue University and Indiana University, an estimated 43,000 to 67,000 football players suffer a concussion every season. However, because many injuries go unreported, the true number may exceed 100,000. The study, [...] "Detected Cognitive Impairment in High School Football Players Without Clinically Diagnosed Concussion", {{was published in}} 2013 in the Journal of Neurotrauma and observed 21 high school players throughout a season; [...] it determined that even players who would not be diagnosed with a concussion based on their symptoms can display notable impairments via MRIs and verbal or cognitive testing, indicating that the current tests used on the sideline to assess concussions may not be adequate. A 2013 study by the National Academy of Sciences found that concussion rates in college football exceed those in any other sport, and <b>that</b> <b>high</b> <b>school</b> players have twice the risk of sustaining a concussion as collegiate players. The study found that, as reported by athletic trainers, college football players sustain 6.3 concussions for every 10,000 athletic exposures (meaning an individual practice or game), and the rate for high school football players is 11.2. The high school concussion figure is nearly double that of the next-highest sport, lacrosse. The study, funded by a $75,000 donation from the NFL to the Centers for Disease Control Foundation, also found {{that there is no}} evidence that newer helmet technology decreases the risk for concussions.|$|E
500|$|Although not a ratings success, {{the series}} was a {{critical}} success from its first season.

[...] In her review, Paige Wiser of the Chicago Sun Times said that [...] "on Veronica Mars, wholesome is out; gritty reality is in.

[...] Joyce Millman of The Phoenix felt that {{the series was}} [...] "a character study masquerading as a high-school drama". Joy Press of The Village Voice saw the series as [...] "a sharp teen noir in the making. Tinged with class resentment and nostalgia for Veronica's lost innocence, this series pulses with promise." [...] Michael Abernethy of PopMatters said that [...] "intrigue, drama, and humor, Veronica Mars is also a lesson book for the disenfranchised. Few TV series aim so high; even fewer succeed so well." [...] James Poniewozik of Time labeled it as one of the six best dramas on television. He praised Bell as [...] "a captivating star", and said that the series [...] "uses its pulp premise to dramatize a universal teen experience: that growing up means sleuthing out the mystery of who you really are." [...] Kay McFadden of The Seattle Times called the series an update to the [...] "classic California film noir". She felt that Veronica Mars was the best new series on UPN, and that the title character was potentially [...] "this season's most interesting character creation". McFadden described the series as [...] "Alias in its attitude, Raymond Chandler in its writing and The O.C. in its class-consciousness."

2500|$|There {{are other}} {{official}} rules of admission in certain top high schools. If a prestigious {{senior high school}} wants to admit 800 students a year, the admissions office ranks students’ scores from highest to lowest and then selects their first 700 students. The other 100 positions are provided to students who don't meet the requirement standard but still want to study at that school. [...] These prospects need to pay extra school fees. A student can’t perform badly in zhongkao, if their scores {{are close to the}} requirement standard, they could still study in that top school if they can afford the expenses. Those who study in <b>that</b> <b>high</b> <b>school</b> must also place maximum 2 points below the standard requirement. Usually, 0.5 points is a standard. For instance, if you are 2 points below the standard requirement, you pay four times as much as the student who gets 0.5 points below the standard requirement. The admissions of the 100 students which are required to pay the school fees usually do not get the same admission letters as normal students receive, but they can still study and live with normal students in the same high school with the same teacher.|$|E
2500|$|The {{consensus}} view is <b>that</b> <b>high</b> <b>school</b> {{grades are}} probably {{the single most important}} factor in winning admission. Maintaining high grades is particularly important for the fall semester of twelfth grade, as well as winter grades if applying by regular admission, and there is a report that colleges are paying greater attention to a student's grades throughout twelfth grade. Particularly important is academic performance in core courses, and having a high grade point average based on good grades in AP-level or honors courses. Colleges evaluate applicants often by examining how a student has successfully exploited what a high school has had to offer. High school guidance counselor Erin Day of Summit High School in New Jersey suggested that of the top five criteria for getting into college, having good grades were first, second, and third most important overall (test scores were fourth, extracurricular activities and essay were fifth). An ideal academic record is one of increasingly better grades in courses of progressive difficulty. Hernandez wrote that colleges looked for patterns with both grades and test scores; high grades with low test scores suggested a hard-working student, but high test scores with low grades suggested a picture of a lazy student. Ninth grade grades generally do not count much, but trends are important—an upward trend in grades was a positive factor, a decline a negative one. Public universities are more likely to evaluate applicants based on grades and test scores alone, while private universities tend to be more [...] "holistic" [...] and consider other measures, according to one view.|$|E
