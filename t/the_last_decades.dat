5|$|Aspirin's {{popularity}} declined {{after the}} development of acetaminophen/paracetamol in 1956 and ibuprofen in 1962.

Aspirin sales revived considerably in <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>decades</b> of the twentieth century, and remain strong in the twenty-first with widespread use as a preventive treatment for heart attacks and strokes.|$|E

5|$|Although {{absolute}} {{in theory}} and in principle, the sultan's powers were limited in practice. Political decisions had {{to take into account}} the opinions and attitudes of important members of the dynasty, the bureaucratic and military establishments, as well as religious leaders. Beginning in <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>decades</b> of the sixteenth century, the role of the Ottoman sultans in the government of the empire began to decrease, in a period known as the Transformation of the Ottoman Empire. Despite being barred from inheriting the throne, women of the Imperial Harem—especially the reigning sultan's mother, known as the Valide Sultan—also played an important behind-the-scenes political role, effectively ruling the empire during the period known as the Sultanate of Women.|$|E
5|$|Beginning in <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>decades</b> of the Cold War, American and European {{critics of}} the UN {{condemned}} the organization for perceived mismanagement and corruption. In 1984, the US President, Ronald Reagan, withdrew his nation's funding from UNESCO (the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization, founded 1946) over allegations of mismanagement, followed by Britain and Singapore. Boutros Boutros-Ghali, Secretary-General from 1992 to 1996, initiated a reform of the Secretariat, reducing {{the size of the}} organization somewhat. His successor, Kofi Annan (1997–2006), initiated further management reforms in the face of threats from the United States to withhold its UN dues.|$|E

Around 32,000 English settled in Valparaíso, influencing the port city to the extent of making it virtually a British colony during <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>decades</b> of the 19th century {{and the beginning of the}} 20th century.
