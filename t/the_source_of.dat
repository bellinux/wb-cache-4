40|$|International audienceToday, {{researchers}} studying <b>the</b> <b>sources</b> <b>of</b> law {{have two}} challenges facing them. First, they must study <b>the</b> material <b>sources</b> <b>of</b> law. Indeed, these material <b>sources</b> <b>of</b> law are traditionally left out, {{although they are}} very important {{and more and more}} original works can be carried on them. Second, they must rethink <b>the</b> formal <b>sources</b> <b>of</b> law. As more and more new types of norms and new types <b>of</b> <b>sources</b> <b>of</b> norms born, researchers have to take them seriously. Therefore, this study invites to advance research on <b>the</b> <b>sources</b> <b>of</b> law so that it does not become archaic and adapts to changes in the world of law. Research on <b>the</b> <b>sources</b> <b>of</b> law, such as research on law in general, must be dynamic and pragmatic...|$|R

40|$|This article {{argues that}} the {{mainstream}} view according to which <b>the</b> <b>sources</b> <b>of</b> international law constitute {{a set of rules}} for the identification of other legal rules is a comforting parable that has eroded international lawyers’ critical attitude, contributing to the general disrepute <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>sources</b> <b>of</b> international law. Instead, <b>the</b> <b>sources</b> <b>of</b> international law are better understood as a set of communitarian constraints irreducible to rules. This article concludes that shedding the comforting idea <b>of</b> rules in <b>the</b> <b>sources</b> <b>of</b> international law allows international lawyers to avoid what will be described in the following paragraphs as the pitfalls of infinite regress and circularity inherent in ruleness while simultaneously facilitating the possibility of communication that is required for legal argumentation to take place among professional international lawyers...|$|R

30|$|It can be {{observed}} that both cyclic load and generator control equipment (GCE) were reported as <b>the</b> <b>sources</b> <b>of</b> forced oscillations.
