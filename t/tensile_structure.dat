40|$|AbstractIn recent years, {{the textile}} {{industry}} {{developed a new}} generation of advanced textile materials for the construction sector designed {{to address the needs of}} one of the largest markets for textile products. Examples of the advanced textiles developed include fabrics for the rehabilitation of buildings, geotextiles for the consolidation of a wide range of soil structures and the high performance technical textiles for <b>tensile</b> <b>structures.</b> When combine with innovative sensors the fabrics provide an useful tool for the constant monitoring of the structures and can be used to record the mechanical performance or detect anomalies in the expected use of the structures by measuring applied loads, deformations, operating temperatures or other important parameters. This work highlights recent advances in sensor embedded textiles for structural health monitoring of <b>tensile</b> <b>structures.</b> Attention is paid on ease of application, integration in the textile and the use of established and relatively low cost sensing methodologies. The real innovation lies therefore in transferring these methods to unexplored technological fields for smart textiles such as <b>tensile</b> <b>structures...</b>|$|R

50|$|On {{the left}} {{site of the}} Icestadion stands an open air ice skating rink. In 1980 {{it was decided to}} build a roof over the open air rink in order to have it {{operational}} during the whole year independent of the weather conditions. The German architectural firm Ackermann und Partner designed an elegant light-weight <b>tensile</b> <b>structure</b> spanning 100 meters length-wise. The building was completed in 1983. In 2004 the ice skating rink was closed and is now used to play Indoorsoccer.|$|E
50|$|The barrier {{was called}} the Luminous Veil. Designed by {{architect}} Dereck Revington and engineers at Halcrow Yolles and completed in 2003, the Luminous Veil consists of over 9,000 steel rods, 12.7 cm apart and 5 m high, stretched to cantilevered girders. The <b>tensile</b> <b>structure</b> was difficult to analyze and required several tests at the University of Toronto. Initially, cost prohibited the planned lighting to be installed on the top horizontal member. The lighting installation was completed in July 2015. The Luminous Veil received in 1999 a Canadian Architect Award of Excellence.|$|E
50|$|Most of the {{habitable}} {{areas are}} underground, {{tucked into the}} hillside, reducing the need for energy-driven air conditioning, while maintaining the original green ground coverage. Wind scopes provide natural ventilation and lighting deep within the habitable areas. Earth insulation reduces energy consumption and stabilizes cyclical temperature variations. The complex is one of India's best examples of energy efficient and sustainable architecture. It is also known {{for the use of}} a lightweight <b>tensile</b> <b>structure</b> over the dining hall providing soft, energy-free light. A recent addition is an underground conference hall that accommodates up to 80 people.|$|E
