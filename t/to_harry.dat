In August 1943, Price conducted a brief dig in the cellars of the ruined house and discovered two bones thought to be of a young woman.

5|$|Fleming was {{not happy}} with the book, owing to the {{reactions}} by critics and fans, and attempted to suppress elements of it where he could: he blocked a paperback edition in the United Kingdom and only gave permission for the title to be used when he sold the film rights <b>to</b> <b>Harry</b> Saltzman and Albert R. Broccoli, rather than any aspects of the plots. However, a British paperback edition was published after his death, and the Bond film character of Jaws is loosely based on one of the characters in the book.|$|E
5|$|Flight of the Hippogriff is a steel {{roller coaster}} {{designed}} for families, located adjacent <b>to</b> <b>Harry</b> Potter and the Forbidden Journey. The ride opened in 2000 as the Flying Unicorn. Similar to the Dragon Challenge, this ride was re-themed {{prior to the}} opening of the Wizarding World. The roller coaster's back-story is that Hogwarts's Care of Magical Creatures professor, Hagrid, is teaching young wizards to fly on a hippogriff (as Harry does in Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban) by using a wicker replica of the creature. A recreation of Hagrid's Hut is passed on the way for a lesson from Hagrid himself on how to properly approach a hippogriff.|$|E

Conversely, the longest period of time between two players hitting for the cycle was 5 years, 1 month, and 10 days, a drought lasting from Bill Joyce cycle in 1896 <b>to</b> <b>Harry</b> Davis in 1901.|$|E
