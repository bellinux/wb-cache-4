5|$|Meanwhile in Scranton, {{the office}} is left without a {{receptionist}}. Not wanting to get roped into being receptionist again, Pam Halpert (Jenna Fischer) defies Andy Bernard's (Ed Helms) orders to answer the phone. With {{the rest of the}} staff similarly declining to answer the phone, Andy is left with no choice but to take on the receptionist's role himself, and performs the job with unexpected gusto. He orders new magazines for <b>the</b> <b>waiting</b> <b>area,</b> cooks mini-pizzas as reception snacks, color-coordinates the desk, and brings in a mail cart to deliver mail. Pam and Darryl Philbin (Craig Robinson) attempt {{to talk him out of}} his newfound enjoyment, believing it to be linked to his lingering feelings for Erin, to no success.|$|E
5|$|Since 2006, {{there have}} been a number of {{terrorist}} attacks, including explosions in a landmark holy place, a court and a temple. The 2006 Varanasi bombings were a series of bombings that occurred across the Hindu holy city of Varanasi on 7 March 2006. At least 28 people were killed and as many as 101 others were injured. The blasts occurred simultaneously shortly after 18:00 IST. The first blast took place at 18:20 in the crowded Sankat Mochan Hanuman Temple near the Banaras Hindu University. Other blasts followed at the Varanasi Cantonment Railway Station near <b>the</b> <b>waiting</b> <b>area</b> next to the travel office. Initially, another blast was reported in the stationary Shivganga Express bound for Delhi.|$|E
5|$|The main {{building}} designed by Lange is in historicism and was originally built in two stories in brick. A third was {{added in the}} 1950s, some {{with some of the}} original feel being lost in the addition, since it was not stylistically true. In 1965 two annexes were built, one on each side and in two stories. The western was used for offices and the other as part of the waiting area—these were both in line with the historicist style. They replaced a cargo expedition and a restaurant building, respectively. In 1995 the bus station was moved from the city center at Leüthenhaven to the central station, and the eastern annex was razed in favor of a postmodernistic glass and concrete building. In addition to the bus station it features and extension of <b>the</b> <b>waiting</b> <b>area,</b> offices, a restaurant and a parking lot.|$|E

5|$|The video {{starts with}} a woman exiting the taxi {{and going to the}} Los Angeles Union Station. A man exits a car and follows her. Wade then plays the first verse and first chorus in <b>the</b> <b>waiting</b> <b>area</b> of the L. A. Union Station. As the band plays the second verse, they are shown playing at the rooftop with Iron Mountain clearly visible. When the chorus plays again, they are shown at the roof with lights from the {{buildings}} of Downtown Los Angeles at night. When Wade sings the bridge, he is {{on the roof of the}} Roosevelt Hotel in Hollywood Boulevard. The man and the woman are also seen running in the boarding area of the Los Angeles Union Station. They later meet up and kiss in one of the boarding platforms of the station in front of a train which later starts to move. The video ends with the band sitting down in the waiting hall.|$|E

5000|$|The bus {{terminal}} is underground, one level above the concourse level; {{it consists of}} a large outdoor <b>waiting</b> <b>area</b> serving as its bus platforms, with a relatively modest indoor <b>waiting</b> <b>area.</b> Because some of the bus platforms are far away from <b>the</b> indoor <b>waiting</b> <b>area,</b> it is practical to wait outdoors for some routes due to the way TTC {{bus terminal}}s work; unfortunately, because it is underground, the air quality on the bus platforms can be poor during busy hours. Stairs connect <b>the</b> indoor <b>waiting</b> <b>area</b> to a usually-unmanned pedestrian entrance/exit on the ground level just outside Fairview Mall.|$|R

25|$|Owing to its {{proximity}} to central London and its location in the London Docklands area, London City Airport is small compared with several other airports serving London, such as Heathrow, Gatwick, Stansted or Luton. The airport features one single, two-storey passenger terminal building. The ground floor contains the check-in desks and some service facilities {{as well as a}} staircase leading to the security control on the upper level after which the airside waiting area and several more shops can be found. <b>The</b> <b>waiting</b> <b>area</b> is connected to piers on both sides where corridors on the upper floor lead to the departure gates on the ground level.

25|$|Each {{contestant}} that auditions {{is given}} a number by the production team and remains in <b>the</b> <b>waiting</b> <b>area</b> until called out into the wings, giving them {{a certain amount of}} time to prepare their act. Upon being allowed onto the main stage, they will usually be asked by one of the judges for their name and what they plan to perform, along with other details such as age, occupation, personal background, and what they wish to achieve if they won. After this, they are then given three minutes to conduct their performance before both the judges and a live audience, with some acts being supported by a backing track provided by the production team. If at any time, the judges find the performance to be unconvincing, boring or completely wrong, they may use the buzzer before them, which changes the Xs from white to red; if all the judges press their buzzers, then the performance is immediately over.|$|E

500|$|Union Station Associates spend {{hundreds}} of thousands of dollars on a full renovation of the building for combined use by Amtrak and commercial tenants. The exterior was restored to the original 1885 specifications. However, some of the interior work modified the station far from its original configuration. A mezzanine was built over half <b>the</b> <b>waiting</b> <b>area</b> to provide restaurant seating, and the floor of the rest was cut out to create an atrium. The basement became the passenger waiting area, with a newsstand and a plant shop occupying additional space. New, wider platforms were built to improve the boarding experience. The renovated station was celebrated and rededicated in July 1976. The New London Day, which five years before called the station an [...] "eyesore", ran their coverage under the headline [...] "We were wrong!" [...] New London Union Station was the first station in the country to be restored for Amtrak use. It represented a [...] "watershed" [...] in historic preservation as one of the first industrial age structures in New England to be reused – a shift away from the previous attitude that valued only Colonial buildings – as well as the recognition of the historic value of the old downtowns of New England's port cities.|$|E
