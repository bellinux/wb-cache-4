5|$|The {{principle}} of individual freedom in society was already {{one of the}} central points in the FPÖ (and VdU's) programme during the 1950s. The party did not regard its liberalism and its pan-German, nationalist positions as contradictory. From the late 1980s through the 1990s, the party developed economically, supporting tax reduction, less state intervention and more privatisation. Starting in the late 2000s, the party has taken a more populist tack, combining this position with support for <b>the</b> <b>welfare</b> <b>state.</b> It criticised unemployment and alleged welfare-state abuse by immigrants which, it said, threatened <b>the</b> <b>welfare</b> <b>state</b> and pensioners' benefits.|$|E
5|$|The party also notably want {{to invest}} more of Norway's oil wealth in {{infrastructure}} (particularly roads, broadband capacity, hospitals, schools and nursing homes) and <b>the</b> <b>welfare</b> <b>state.</b> This position, that has used {{a sense of a}} welfare crisis to support demands to spend more of the oil fund now rather than later, is part of its electoral success.|$|E
5|$|The {{party had}} no strong {{economic}} preferences, and generally supported a mixed economy.

50|$|<b>The</b> hidden <b>welfare</b> <b>state</b> {{is almost}} {{half the size of}} <b>the</b> visible <b>welfare</b> <b>state.</b> In 1995, <b>the</b> {{government}} spent 900 billion dollars on <b>the</b> visible <b>welfare</b> <b>state</b> and 400 billion dollars on tax expenditures via corporate welfare, military welfare, and social <b>welfare.</b> <b>The</b> hidden <b>welfare</b> <b>state</b> provides goods and services directly comparable to those provided in <b>the</b> visible <b>welfare</b> <b>state</b> of direct spending. Similar to public assistance and social insurance programs of <b>the</b> visible <b>welfare</b> <b>state,</b> there are tax expenditures for corporations, military contractors, Wall Street, income security, health, employment and training, housing, education, and social services. The United States government spends as much, or more, on social services and on employment training through the tax code as it does through direct spending.|$|R
40|$|We {{examine the}} {{determinants}} of happiness from a comparative perspective. We use data from the 2002 International Social Survey Programme with roughly 40, 000 individuals nested within 30 countries. We apply a multi-level modeling approach to formulate the specific interactions between the macro and micro. We focus on public social expenditures and taxes as proxy measures of state intervention at the macro-level, and happiness as the specific measure of <b>welfare</b> outcome at <b>the</b> micro-level. Our study suggests that happiness in <b>the</b> <b>welfare</b> <b>states</b> closely reflects <b>the</b> redistribution of wealth and resources in these countries. We find clear evidence that happiness is transferred from the low-risk to high-risk individuals in <b>the</b> <b>welfare</b> regimes. For example, we find that married persons are significantly happier, but single persons are significantly less happy in <b>the</b> <b>welfare</b> <b>states.</b> This finding suggests that pro-family ideology of <b>the</b> <b>welfare</b> <b>states</b> protects families from social risk and improves their well-being {{at the cost of}} single persons. Further, we find that the happiness gap between the high versus the low-income earners is considerably smaller in <b>the</b> <b>welfare</b> <b>states,</b> suggesting that happiness is transferred from the privileged to the less privileged...|$|R

5|$|Gordon Brown was an {{important}} figure in Blair's Labour government and {{played a key role}} in developing the party's philosophy. Brown served as Shadow Chancellor of the Exchequer from 1992 to 1997 and was appointed Chancellor of the Exchequer following Labour's election victory in 1997. He attempted to control public spending and sought to increase the funding for education and healthcare. His economic strategy was market-based, attempting to reform <b>the</b> <b>welfare</b> <b>state</b> through a tax credit scheme for poorer working families, and he assigned the Bank of England to set interest rates.|$|E
5|$|The {{death of}} Hugh Grosvenor, 1st Duke of Westminster in 1899 was a pivotal {{point in the}} {{development}} of Mayfair, following which all redevelopment schemes not already in operation were cancelled.

Land value fell around Mayfair, and some leases were not renewed.|$|E
5|$|Under the {{leadership}} of Heinz-Christian Strache, the FPÖ has focused on describing itself as a Heimat and social party. This means that the party promotes {{its role as a}} guarantor of Austrian identity and social welfare. Economically, it supports regulated liberalism with privatisation and low taxes, combined with support for the welfare state; however, it maintains that it will be impossible to uphold <b>the</b> <b>welfare</b> <b>state</b> if current immigration policies are continued.|$|E
40|$|Feminist {{criticism}} has uncovered {{significant differences in}} <b>the</b> approach of <b>welfare</b> <b>states</b> to women’s employment and the family not captured by more mainstream, class-based approaches. At the same time, a coherent explanation for gendered variation {{has been slow to}} develop. Exploring the French, Ger-man, and Swedish cases, this article develops a theory of welfare-state devel-opment that links <b>the</b> <b>welfare</b> <b>state’s</b> approach to women and the family to the state’s response to labor-market conditions during crucial periods of labor shortage. These three cases suggest a trade-off between the economy’s de-pendence on immigrant labor and <b>the</b> <b>welfare</b> <b>state’s</b> willingness to adapt to the specific interests of working mothers. This suggests a link between seemingly unrelated differences in immigration policy and the state’s support for working mothers...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{analyses}} {{the evolution}} of <b>the</b> <b>welfare</b> <b>states</b> in <b>the</b> majority of OECD countries during the pre-globalisation (1946 – 80) and globalisation (1980 – 2000) periods. Our purpose {{is to find out}} whether globalisation has produced a convergence towards a smaller <b>welfare</b> <b>state,</b> funded increasingly by non-mobile factors such as labour, property and consumption rather than by mobile factors such as capital. The data presented here challenge the claims about such a convergence, showing that social public expenditures and public employment have continued to expand during the globalisation period in most OECD countries. We also show that <b>the</b> <b>welfare</b> <b>states</b> remain rooted in the political traditions that have governed them...|$|R
40|$|Has the {{financial}} crisis fundamentally weakened Europe’s <b>welfare</b> <b>states?</b> Luis Moreno assesses <b>the</b> development of <b>welfare</b> <b>states</b> in Europe in the post-war period.

5|$|Until the mid-1970s, the Conservative Party {{was mostly}} {{controlled}} by one-nation conservatives. The {{rise of the}} New Right in conservative politics led to a critique of one-nation conservatism which contended that Keynesian economics and welfarism had damaged the economy and society. The Winter of Discontent of 1978–79 was portrayed by the New Right as illustrative of the overextension of the state. Figures such as Margaret Thatcher believed that to reverse the national decline, {{it was necessary to}} revive old values of individualism and challenge the dependency culture created by <b>the</b> <b>welfare</b> <b>state.</b>|$|E
5|$|After {{the failure}} of his first marriage, Waugh {{converted}} to Catholicism in 1930. His traditionalist stance led him to strongly oppose all attempts to reform the Church, and the changes by the Second Vatican Council (1962–65) greatly disturbed his sensibilities, especially {{the introduction of the}} vernacular Mass. That blow to his religious traditionalism, his dislike for <b>the</b> <b>welfare</b> <b>state</b> culture of the postwar world and the decline of his health, darkened his final years, but he continued to write. To the public, Waugh displayed a mask of indifference, but he was capable of great kindness to those whom he considered to be his friends. After his death in 1966, he acquired a following of new readers through the film and television versions of his works, such as the television serial Brideshead Revisited (1981).|$|E
5|$|As {{leader of}} the Moderate Party, Reinfeldt tended to be less {{forceful}} in his criticism of the Swedish welfare state than his predecessors. He instead proposed reforms to Sweden's welfare state, which included cutting taxes for the lowest income earners and reducing unemployment benefits, {{in order to encourage}} the jobless to return to work. He toned down calls within the party for dismantling large portions of the Swedish welfare state, stating that change must come gradually from the bottom up and not be dictated from the top down. His goal was said to be to fine-tune <b>the</b> <b>welfare</b> <b>state,</b> by focusing on getting people off welfare benefits and into employment. He worked to shift the conservatives toward the middle ground by convincing voters that he would fix rather than dismantle the public welfare system.|$|E
40|$|Epidemiological {{studies have}} {{consistently}} shown that population health varies significantly by <b>welfare</b> <b>state</b> regime. However, {{these studies have}} focused exclusively on <b>the</b> <b>welfare</b> <b>states</b> of Europe, North America and Australasia.

40|$|Summaries After the {{spectacular}} economic crisis of late 1997, {{there has been}} a call for social welfare reform as well as economic restructuring in East Asia. Covering Japan, South Korea and Taiwan, this article first seeks to identify {{the strengths and weaknesses of}} <b>the</b> East Asian <b>welfare</b> <b>states.</b> Second, it examines the pressures for reform of <b>the</b> <b>welfare</b> systems. Finally, it addresses the question of whether the low spending East Asian welfare regimes will be maintained in the future. The strength. of <b>the</b> East Asian <b>welfare</b> <b>states</b> mainly lies in their promotion of an ideology of developmentalism and their relatively low cost; while their weakness is that they tend to reinforce socio?economic inequalities. Economic recession and socio?economic pressures as well as inefficiencies within <b>the</b> <b>welfare</b> <b>states</b> create pressure for change. The governments in Japan, South Korea and Taiwan have responded with reform measures appropriate to these nations' social and political context.

5|$|Schwartz {{argues that}} Lincoln's American {{reputation}} grew {{slowly in the}} late 19th century until the Progressive Era (1900–1920s) when he {{emerged as one of}} the most venerated heroes in American history, with even white Southerners in agreement. The high point came in 1922 with the dedication of the Lincoln Memorial on the National Mall in Washington, D.C. In the New Deal era liberals honored Lincoln not so much as the self-made man or the great war president, but as the advocate of the common man who they believe would have supported <b>the</b> <b>welfare</b> <b>state.</b> In the Cold War years, Lincoln's image shifted to emphasize the symbol of freedom who brought hope to those oppressed by communist regimes.|$|E
5|$|The {{institution}} of <b>the</b> <b>welfare</b> <b>state</b> was by 1957 accepted by both major parties. Diefenbaker promised {{to expand the}} national health insurance scheme to cover tubercular and mental health patients. He characterized the old age pension increase which the Liberal government was instituting as a mere pittance, not even enough {{to keep up with}} the cost of living. Diefenbaker noted that the increase only amounted to twenty cents a day, using that figure to ridicule Liberal contentions that an increase would add to the rate of inflation. All three opposition parties promised to increase the pension, with the Social Crediters and CCF even stating the specific amounts it would be raised by.|$|E

40|$|The {{analyses}} of the national reforms in <b>the</b> <b>welfare</b> <b>states</b> over <b>the</b> last decades were partly focused on this notion of convergence. In the eighties and the nineties, the transformation in many <b>welfare</b> <b>states</b> provided a literature on the retrenchment of <b>the</b> <b>welfare</b> <b>states</b> which explained <b>the</b> trends as a bottom race or a downward convergence. The economic literature has provided a large range of measurements of convergence in per capita GDP between countries. These indicators have mainly been based on the deviation measurement (σ-convergence), the differences between growth rates (β-convergence), or {{the changes in the}} ranks of countries (γ-convergence). The analyses on the convergence/ divergence in <b>the</b> social <b>welfare</b> <b>states</b> often used <b>the</b> same indicators as in economic studies. In this exploratory paper we would like to re-think the measurement of convergence on the basis of attractiveness between pairs of countries because many national reforms have been inspired by the existence of specific policies in some leading countries which became 'models' for the other ones. This paper proposes a methodology for distinguishing the countries which are attracted by some other ones, from the countries which are attractors (models). The first results on OECD data partly contradict the idea of a downward convergence of <b>the</b> social <b>welfare</b> <b>states</b> in <b>the</b> eighties and the nineties...|$|R

30|$|Esping-Andersen {{identified}} {{three types of}} <b>welfare</b> <b>states.</b> First, <b>the</b> liberal <b>welfare</b> <b>state.</b> In this case, {{the state has a}} relatively weak position in structuring the social and economic life of its households, and social benefits provided by the state are means-tested and targeted at the lowest income stratum, which leads to stigmatization and residualization of state benefit recipients. The United States can be seen {{as an example of a}} liberal <b>welfare</b> <b>state.</b> <b>The</b> second is <b>the</b> social democratic <b>welfare</b> <b>state,</b> with a far stronger role of the state. Here, social benefits are more generous, and universal in provision, leading to far lower degrees of income inequality, and less stigmatization of the poorest households. In between these two types are <b>the</b> conservative, corporatist <b>welfare</b> <b>states.</b> They do not embrace a universal social system as <b>the</b> social democratic <b>welfare</b> <b>states</b> do, but state provisions are generous as in <b>the</b> social democratic <b>welfare</b> <b>state.</b>|$|R
