Few oral products have a marketing authorization for therapeutic use in children. Preliminary data indicate differences in bioavailability among the various vitamin E compounds. Our objective was to review published data on oral vitamin E therapy in neonates and children {{in order to establish}} dosage recommendations at a local level. Methods A literature search was conducted, including Medline Ovid, EMBASE (1980 -Feb 2008), Cochrane databases, product monographs, handbooks, and textbooks. Results The main vitamin E compounds being used in children are α-tocopherol, α-tocopheryl acetate, and <b>tocofersolan.</b> The most data are available on tocopheryl acetate, both in neonates and older children. In children with malabsorption disorders, <b>tocofersolan</b> appears to have an increased bioavailability compared to tocopherol or tocopheryl acetate.

Published data on pharmacokinetics and dosages for clinical use are few and heterogeneous. No pharmacokinetic studies were found for <b>tocofersolan</b> in neonates and infants. There are few comparative studies on pharmacokinetics, therapeutic use, and adverse drug reactions (ADRs) in children. Dosages used in clinical studies and dosage recommendations in handbooks differ considerably. Conclusions The differences in dosing recommendations in children may be due to lack of systematic studies. Existing published data on oral vitamin E do not provide a basis for evaluation of dosage recommendations in children. Comparative clinical studies are required for scientific evaluation of pharmacokinetics, dosage regimens, and efficacy/ADR assessments in children...|$|E
40|$|Deficiency in vitamin E, {{a natural}} antioxidant, participates in {{abnormal}} erythrocyte membrane lipids, structural alterations and hemolysis in advanced cirrhosis. Poor absorption of fat-soluble vitamins limits full correction of deficiency with standard formulations in cirrhosis with cholestasis. The {{aim of the}} present study was to examine safety and effects of <b>tocofersolan,</b> a water-soluble derivative of vitamin E, on erythrocyte membrane lipids and anemia in patients with biopsy-proven advanced cirrhosis, vitamin E deficiency and hemolysis...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVES: D-Alpha-tocopheryl {{polyethylene}} glycol 1000 succinate (<b>Tocofersolan,</b> Vedrop), {{has been developed}} in Europe to provide an orally bioavailable source of vitamin E in children with cholestasis. The aim was to analyze the safety/efficacy of Vedrop in {{a large group of}} children with chronic cholestasis. METHODS: Two hundred seventy-four children receiving Vedrop for vitamin E deficiency or for its prophylaxis were included from 7 European centers. Median age at treatment onset was 2 months and median follow-up was 11 months. Vedrop was prescribed at a daily dose of 0. 34 mL/kg (25 IU/kg) of body weight. Three methods were used to determine a sufficient serum vitamin E status: vitamin E, vitamin E/(total cholesterol), vitamin E/(total cholesterol + triglycerides). RESULTS: Before Vedrop therapy, 51 % of children had proven vitamin E deficiency, 30 % had normal vitamin E status and 19 % had an unknown vitamin E status. During the first months of treatment, vitamin E status was restored in the majority of children with insufficient levels at baseline (89 % had a normal status at 6 months). All children with a normal baseline vitamin E status had a normal vitamin E status at 6 months. Among children with an unknown vitamin E status at baseline, 93 % had a normal vitamin E status at 6 months. A sufficient vitamin E status was observed in 80 % of children with significant cholestasis (serum total bilirubin > 34. 2  μmol/L). No serious adverse reaction was reported. CONCLUSIONS: Vedrop seems a safe and effective oral formulation of vitamin E that restores and/or maintains sufficient serum vitamin E level in the majority of children with cholestasis, avoiding the need for intramuscular vitamin E injections...|$|E
