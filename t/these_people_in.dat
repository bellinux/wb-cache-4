He stated that certain mysteries were explained to him based on new interpretations of sacred texts such as the Bible. He said that, on 7 October 1975, he was contacted by one of the Elohim, who took him to another planet to meet Buddha, Moses, Jesus and Muhammad. He stated that his second book, Les extra-terrestres m'ont emmené sur leur planète ("Extraterrestrials Took Me To Their Planet"), relates the teaching he received from <b>these</b> <b>people.</b> <b>In</b> this book, Raël describes harmonious and peaceable beings, who were free of money, sickness, and war.|$|E
5|$|The {{growth of}} {{political}} consciousness started after {{the establishment of}} the Bombay Presidency Association on 31 January 1885. The Bombay Millowners' Association was formed in February 1875 by Dinshaw Maneckji Petit in order to lourdes central school protect interests of workers threatened by possible factory and tariff legislation by the British. The first session of the Indian National Congress was held in Bombay from 28–31 December 1885. The Bombay Municipal Act was enacted in 1888 which gave the British Government wide powers of interference in civic matters. The Victoria Terminus of the Great Indian Peninsular Railway, one of the finest stations in the world, was completed in May 1888. The concept of Dabbawalas (lunch box delivery man) originated in the 1890s when British people who came to Bombay did not like the local food. So the Dabbawala service was set up to bring lunch to <b>these</b> <b>people</b> <b>in</b> their workplace straight from their home. On 11 August 1893, a serious communal riot took place between the Hindus and Muslims, when a Shiva temple was attacked by Muslims in Bombay. 75 people were killed and 350 were injured. In September 1896, Bombay was hit by a bubonic plague epidemic where the death toll was estimated at 1,900 people per week. Around 850,000, amounting to half of the population, fled Bombay during this time. On 9 March 1898, there was a serious riot which started with a sudden outbreak of hostility against the measures adopted by Government for suppression of plague. The riot led to a strike of dock and railway workers which paralysed the city for a few days. The significant results of the plague was the creation of the Bombay City Improvement Trust on 9 December 1898 and the Haffkine Institute on 10 January 1899 by Waldemar Haffkine. The Dadar-Matunga-Wadala-Sion scheme, the first planned suburban scheme in Bombay, was formulated in 1899–1900 by the Bombay City Improvement Trust to relieve congestion in the centre of the town, following the plague epidemics. The cotton mill industry was adversely affected during 1900 and 1901 due to the flight of workers because of the plague.|$|E

25|$|In early 1941, the Nazi German {{government}} arranged another resettlement for {{all those}} who had refused to leave in 1939 or 1940. The action was called the Nachumsiedlung. This time around no compensation was offered for any property or belongings left behind and this group of resettlers were treated with intense suspicion or considered traitors because they had refused Hitler's first call to leave the Baltics in 1939. Most of these arrivals were first settled in filtration camps.

These Pre-Roman Iron Age peoples lived in sedentary communities, who had built villages, and whose society was hierarchical.

500|$|Of Episode 6, The Mirrors Charlie Catchpole wrote [...] "Although I wouldn't want to {{bump into}} any of <b>these</b> <b>people</b> <b>in</b> a wine bar, I found I really cared about their {{unravelling}} relationships, their sad sexual misadventures, their petty jealousies" [...] and concluded by calling the series [...] "Exquisitely written, stylishly produced, superbly performed." [...] In The Times, Paul Hoggart summarised all six episodes as [...] " [...] a tightrope between satire and sentimentality, frequently falling off on the sugary side", but wrote positively of the writing, directing, acting, and editing. He approved of the deliberately unhappy ending, {{looking forward to seeing}} how Rachel's departure would be resolved in the second series.

When asked whether the series still wanted to pursue stories about Inhumans such as James, Whedon said they are [...] "still in our world, so we still have some of <b>these</b> <b>people</b> <b>in</b> the mix ... but right now we’re on the Ghost Rider kick."

However, Twitter responded by acquiring SecondSync and Parisian social TV firm Mesagraph three months later.
