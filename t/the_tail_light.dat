5|$|The plane {{took off}} {{normally}} from runway 17 (today's runway 18) at 12:55am Central Time on Tuesday, February 3. Dwyer, {{the owner of}} the flight service company, witnessed the take-off from a platform outside the control tower. He was able to see clearly the aircraft's tail light for most of the brief flight, which started with an initial left turn onto a northwesterly heading and a climb to 800ft. <b>The</b> <b>tail</b> <b>light</b> was then observed gradually descending until it disappeared out of view. Around 1:00am, when Peterson failed to make the expected radio contact, repeated attempts to establish communication were made, at Dwyer's request, by the radio operator, but they were all unsuccessful.|$|E
25|$|To {{meet the}} {{requirement}} of amber rear turn indicators, <b>the</b> <b>tail</b> <b>light</b> lens assembly for the Australian models included an amber lens.|$|E
25|$|The styling of the GTV, while distinctive, {{can be seen}} {{to share}} many design {{features}} derived from the Montreal supercar, as translated down to a simpler and thus more marketable vehicle. Examples of this are the bonnet line, which while briefer, still has 'scallops' for the headlights, and <b>the</b> <b>tail</b> <b>light</b> clusters which resemble those of the Montreal. The door shape is similar, and in a sharing of parts, both vehicles employ the same door handles.|$|E
50|$|The North American {{versions}} shipped with incandescent <b>tail</b> <b>lights,</b> {{identical to}} <b>the</b> <b>tail</b> <b>lights</b> found on <b>the</b> GTI, instead of <b>the</b> LED <b>tail</b> <b>lights</b> used in <b>the</b> {{rest of the}} world.|$|R
50|$|For 2007, Dodge changed <b>the</b> <b>tail</b> <b>lights.</b>|$|R
50|$|In August 1972, <b>the</b> <b>tail</b> <b>lights</b> were {{updated from}} 1 piece <b>tail</b> <b>light</b> (affectionately called 1-tail) to <b>tail</b> <b>lights</b> with {{distinctive}} turn signals. The rear center garnish was also redesigned. The fuel tank was {{moved from the}} trunk bottom to behind the rear seats; the fuel filler was moved from a concealed location between <b>the</b> <b>tail</b> <b>lights</b> to <b>the</b> left C pillar.|$|R
25|$|The detectives {{return to}} the lake in Discovery Park where Rosie's body was found. Linden notes {{that no one has}} said what {{happened}} there. Holder suggests they inform the Larsens. They find Terry in the Larsen garage and tell her they found Rosie's killer, but do not say who it is. After Terry goes upstairs, Linden notices <b>the</b> <b>tail</b> <b>light</b> on Terry's car is broken, recalling Jasper describing the car that dropped his father off on the night of Rosie's murder as having a broken tail light. In Rosie's room, they confront Terry about being at the lake when Rosie died. As Stan and Mitch enter the room, Terry apologizes, asking them to not be mad at her.|$|E
25|$|Along {{with the}} base and sports models, Ford also marketed two luxury-oriented variants. The first of the two, known as the Fairmont {{employed}} the same six-cylinder engine as the Futura and GLi. Building on the equipment level of the Futura, the Fairmont gained, automatic climate control air conditioning, trip computer, power rear windows, oil pressure and battery level gauges, front and rear illuminated footwells, electric aerial and full velour interior. Exterior wise, a more prominent chrome front grille, a larger bonnet bulge, and differently shaped headlamps distinguished the Fairmont from other EL models, as did 15-inch, 12-spoke alloy wheels. The Fairmont was also fitted with chrome insert side body mouldings and carried over <b>the</b> <b>tail</b> <b>light</b> lenses from the previous EF model.|$|E
25|$|Second {{generation}} {{sales in}} Japan began October 7, 1993, and an introductory price of Â¥2,753,000 for the twin turbo GT (approx USD $25,250 at 1993 yen exchange rate), with an introduction for model year 1995 in North America {{with a full}} body and chassis revision. The exterior was designed by Olivier Boulay, who was hired by Subaru on a short-term basis. <b>The</b> <b>tail</b> <b>light</b> appearance on both the sedan and wagon {{was influenced by the}} taillights on the SVX. In 1996, Subaru decided to make AWD standard equipment in all vehicles produced for the North American market, which would be the case until 2012. Subaru still offered a choice between FWD and AWD for its domestic market vehicles for this generation. The increased ground clearance Outback was introduced with this generation in 1995 with AWD only internationally, and the air suspension with height control was no longer offered.|$|E
50|$|The primary {{changes to}} the 1972 Cutlass were the front grilles and <b>the</b> <b>tail</b> <b>lights.</b>|$|R
50|$|For 1975, bumpers were {{enlarged}} and <b>the</b> <b>tail</b> <b>lights</b> were {{enclosed in}} a full-width anodised aluminium trim piece.|$|R

2500|$|Suzuki {{commissioned}} Italian {{industrial designer}} Giorgetto Giugiaro for the RE5 styling. The [...] "tin can" [...] instrument cluster encompassed the usual lights and a low-fuel warning light, total loss oil tank light and digital gear indicator. [...] The tubular [...] "can" [...] motif {{was also used}} in <b>the</b> <b>tail</b> <b>light,</b> and spherical indicator lights finished off the [...] "rotary" [...] theme.|$|E
2500|$|In {{addition}} to the modifications needed for Australian standards and market requirements, changes included the use of [...] "local content" [...] sourced parts and components (such as seats, carpeting, lights, heaters, and even unique [...] "R"-logo wheel covers) that reduced the tariff added to each car. All AMI Matadors were right-hand drive and continued to use the dash and instrument dials of the U.S 1967 Rambler Ambassador. Also reused throughout the whole production run was the split-bench front seat and door cards of the U.S 1971 Matador which were both Australian-made. Despite the reused interior, all exterior model year changes corresponded to those of U.S. production As red rear flashers were prohibited in Australia, amber-coloured trailer lights were retrofitted {{to the rear of}} all AMI-assembled Matadors, drilled into the tail gate of the station wagons or mounted over or behind the reversing lens of <b>the</b> <b>tail</b> <b>light</b> assembly of the sedans, and then re wired so the turn signals would flash orange.|$|E
2500|$|All {{the quality}} and {{engineering}} upgrades and revisions seen on AMC cars for 1972 were also present in Mexico. The 1972 VAM Javelin saw considerable improvements {{in terms of both}} performance and sportiness. Heavy duty springs and shocks along with front sway bar were passed on to the standard equipment list, as also were power front disk brakes and power steering, all regardless of transmission. Units equipped with the four-speed manual transmission changed to a rear differential gear ratio of 3.31:1 and included a center console with locking compartment as standard equipment. The [...] "Shift-Command" [...] Borg-Warner automatic transmissions were replaced by the new [...] "Torque Command" [...] Chrysler-built A998 TorqueFlite. The chromed grille applied on <b>the</b> <b>tail</b> <b>light</b> lenses and the new rectangular grid front grille of the AMC Javelins arrived for the VAM models. The exterior included for the first time factory stripe designs. The interior saw new seat patterns and a new three-spoke sports steering wheel with an [...] "American Motors" [...] legend on the transparent plastic cap of the horn button. A new steering column design with a built-in safety lever to engage the steering lock came and the mechanism blocking the shifters to ignition switch departed.|$|E

2500|$|The GTO {{became a}} {{separate}} Pontiac model (model number 242) in 1966, {{instead of being}} an [...] "option package" [...] on the Tempest LeMans. The entire GM [...] "A" [...] body intermediate line was restyled that year, gaining more curvaceous styling with kicked-up rear fender lines for a [...] "Coke-bottle" [...] look, and a slightly [...] "tunneled" [...] backlight. <b>The</b> <b>tail</b> <b>light</b> featured a rare louvered cover, only seen on the GTO. Overall length grew only fractionally, to , still on a [...] wheelbase, while width expanded to [...] Rear track increased one inch (2.5cm). Overall weight remained about the same. The GTO was available as a pillared coupe, a hardtop (without B-pillars), and a convertible. Also an automotive industry first, plastic front grilles replaced the pot metal and aluminum versions seen on earlier years. New Strato bucket seats were introduced with higher and thinner seat backs and contoured cushions for added comfort and adjustable headrests were introduced as a new option. The instrument panel was redesigned and more integrated than in previous years with the ignition switch moved from the far left of the dash {{to the right of}} the steering wheel. Four pod instruments continued, and the GTO's dash was highlighted by walnut veneer trim.|$|E
2500|$|The Torino model line-up was {{the same}} as 1973, with two exceptions. The Gran Torino Sport no longer was {{available}} with the [...] "Sportsroof" [...] fastback roofline, and the new [...] "Gran Torino Elite" [...] was introduced. The Gran Torino Elite was developed by Ford to help respond to Chevrolet's ever popular Monte Carlo. The Elite, was designed as an entry level [...] "personal luxury" [...] vehicle, for those who couldn't afford a Thunderbird, and was in the same price range as the Monte Carlo. The Elite was described by Ford as [...] " [...] A totally new 2-door hardtop[...].with Thunderbird-inspired styling, solid engineering and personal luxury[...].plus mid-size economy." [...] The Elite wasn't totally new, as Ford described, but it did have a number of unique features. The Elite had unique front sheet metal, with styling that was indeed inspired by the Thunderbird. It had twin headlamps surrounded by chrome bezels and parking lamps on the outer edges of the pointed front fenders. Its grille was large and rectangular arching across the front. The quarter panels and doors were shared with the Mercury Montego and Mercury Cougar and did not have the sweeping body line like other Torinos. <b>The</b> <b>tail</b> <b>light</b> panel also featured larger tail lights that ran the full width of the car; the centre portion being non-functional. The Elite came standard with a 351-2V V8 engine, automatic transmission, and radial tires. It also featured standard luxury items such as a vinyl roof, opera windows, split bench seat, [...] "Westminster" [...] cloth upholstery, woodgrain trim, and complete instrumentation.|$|E
2500|$|In 2002, {{a concept}} Bel Air {{convertible}} was {{shown at the}} North American International Auto Show. It features a few styling and design cues from the best remembered tri-five (1955â57) models, such as the chrome windshield frame, traffic light viewfinder, and a gas filler cap behind <b>the</b> <b>tail</b> <b>light,</b> similar to 1956â1957 Chevy's gas cap behind the chrome trim {{on the back of}} the tail fin, but more reminiscent of the 1948â1958 Cadillac gas cap tail light. It also features the same body on frame hydroforming technology (used in the frame rails of the Corvette and GMâs midsize sport-utility vehicles) and a sheet metal body, on a [...] wheelbase, and a [...] track. Suspension is short long arm up front and Hotchkiss drive in the rear. It rides on five-spoke aluminum wheels with [...] red line tires and anti lock discs all-round. The elegant, yet simple interior features a twin-element instrument panel, column-mounted gearshift and bench seats covered in soft high-tech fabrics colored red to match the exterior that are cleverly designed to slide forward for easier backseat entry. It also served as a showcase for their new turbocharged inline five-cylinder concept engine based on the L52 (Vortec 3500), straight-5 truck engine. According to a September 2002 GM press release, the all-aluminum 3.5L (211 cu in) 20-valve DOHC engine, with a bore of 93.0mm (3.7in), and a stroke of 102.0mm (4in), that delivers up to 315 horsepower and [...] of torque, mated to a Hydra-Matic 4L60-E electronically controlled four-speed automatic. A virtual [...] "turbo boost" [...] button on the steering wheel activates the powertrain control module to trigger a more aggressive spark and fueling calibration for maximum horsepower. It also led the 13th Annual Stater Brothers Route 66 Rendezvous as the official vehicle in September 2002. General Motors has shown no interest in producing the car.|$|E

2500|$|The 1974 {{model year}} saw more {{revisions}} to the Torino line. Government safety regulations now required that the rear bumpers must also meet the [...] standard, so all Torinos had the rear bumper and tail lamp panel redesigned. The new rear bumpers were much larger, square shaped, and sat lower on the body. No longer was there a roll pan located below the bumper as on the 1972â73 models. The tail lights were beveled rectangular wrap-around units which eliminated the need for rear side marker lights. The fuel filler neck moved to a position above the bumper, rather than below as on 1972â73 models. It was now behind an access door {{in the center of}} <b>the</b> <b>tail</b> <b>light</b> panel just below the trunk lock, rather than behind the licence plate. The front fascia for Gran Torinos was revised for 1974. The new grille was of similar shape to the 1973, but was slightly larger and divided into 8 equal sized vertical sections. The grille had a much finer mesh pattern with vertical parking lamps in the outer sections embossed with the grille pattern {{on the surface of the}} lens. The grille emblem was changed and the front bumper was revised to be slightly more pointed, and the bumper guards were moved more towards the center of the bumper compared to 1973 models. The license plate bracket was relocated to the driver's side of the bumper. Torino models carried on with the same front fascia as 1973; however, its front bumpers were revised similarly to the Gran Torinos and the license plate remained in the center. Gran Torino Broughams featured a full width red lens across the rear, but the centre portion was non-functional. Broughams and Squires had a stand-up hood ornament inplace of the emblem on the grille.|$|E

50|$|The federalized Khamsin {{went on sale}} in 1975. These models {{required}} fitting a solid {{version of}} <b>the</b> glass <b>tail</b> panel. <b>The</b> <b>tail</b> <b>lights</b> had to be moved downward, to the rear bumpers' former location; the new, protruding bumper was mounted below <b>the</b> <b>tail</b> <b>lights.</b> This new configuration of components left the exhaust tips unable to clear the bumper, a problem resolved flipping the exhaust resonators upside down. The front bumper was also replaced by a bigger one. Square side markers found their way {{on the front and}} rear wings.The engine had to be revised too, gaining smog control equipment (air injection, thermal reactors in the exhaust manifolds, different carburettors and leaner fuel mixture) and losing 5 hp.|$|R
