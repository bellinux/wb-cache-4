5|$|In {{a note on}} torsion, Thompson {{mentions}} Charles Darwin's {{treatment of}} climbing plants which often spiral around a support, noting that Darwin also observed that the spiralling stems were themselves twisted. Thompson disagrees with Darwin's teleological explanation, that the twisting makes the stems stiffer in <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>way</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> twisting of a rope; Thompson's {{view is that the}} mechanical adhesion of the climbing stem to the support sets up a system of forces which act as a 'couple' offset from the centre of the stem, making it twist.|$|E

There was also a classification for teams, in which the times of the best three cyclists per team on each stage were added together; the leading team {{at the end of}} the race was the team with the lowest total time.|$|E

5|$|The {{traditional}} view of equites cohortales (the cavalry arm of cohortes equitatae), as expounded by G.L. Cheesman, {{was that}} they were just a mounted infantry with poor-quality horses. They would use their mounts simply to reach the battlefield and then would dismount to fight. This view is today discredited. Although it is clear that equites cohortales did not match equites alares (ala cavalrymen) in quality (hence their lower pay), the evidence is that they fought as cavalry in <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>way</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> alares and often alongside them. Their armour and weapons were the same as for the alares.|$|E
5|$|Flying at {{low level}} {{provided}} protection against fighters as well. Radars {{of the era}} {{did not have the}} ability to look down; if the radar were aimed down to detect targets at a lower altitude, the reflection of the ground would overwhelm the signal returned from a target. An interceptor flying at normal altitudes would be effectively blind to bombers far below it. The interceptor could descend to lower altitudes {{to increase the amount of}} visible sky, but doing so would limit its radar range in <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>way</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> missile sites, as well as greatly increasing fuel use and thus reducing mission time. The Soviet Union would not introduce an interceptor with look-down capability until 1972 with the High Lark radar, and even this model had very limited capability.|$|E
5|$|For {{the points}} classification, which awarded a purple (or cyclamen) jersey to its leader, cyclists were given points for {{finishing}} {{a stage in}} the top 15; additional points could also be won in intermediate sprints. The green jersey was awarded to the mountains classification leader. In this ranking, points were won by reaching the summit of a climb ahead of other cyclists. Each climb was ranked as either first, second or third category, with more points available for higher category climbs. The Cima Coppi, the race's highest point of elevation, awarded more points than the other first category climbs. The Cima Coppi for this Giro was the Passo Pordoi. The first rider to cross the Pordoi Pass was Italian Claudio Chiappucci. The white jersey was worn by the leader of young rider classification, a ranking decided <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>way</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> general classification, but only riders born after 1 January 1968 were eligible for it.|$|E

5|$|In {{the same}} period, {{different}} helms {{began to be}} used for different ranks: sovereigns' and knights' helms faced forwards (affronté), whereas those of peers and gentlemen faced to the right (dexter). In the medieval period crests would always have faced <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>way</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> helm, but {{as a result of these}} rules, the directions of the crest and the helm might be at variance: a knight whose crest was a lion statant, would have the lion depicted as looking over the side of the helm, rather than towards the viewer. Torses also suffered artistically, being treated not as silken circlets, but as horizontal bars.|$|E
5|$|It {{soon became}} {{evident that the}} Dominicans needed to {{reestablish}} themselves in Ciudad Real, and the hostilities with the colonists were calmed. In 1547, while de las Casas was in Spain, Francisco Marroquín, bishop of Guatemala, placed the first stone for the new Dominican convent in Ciudad Real. The Dominicans dedicated themselves to destroying indigenous temples and idols, and preached sermons with destructive imagery, such as from the Book of Revelation, that were more familiar to the Mesoamerican worldview. Saints were associated with animals, in much <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>way</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> Indians identified themselves with nahual spirit-forms. Different Mesoamerican otherworlds were tied to Christian concepts, where the Mictlan world of the dead became Hell, Ihuicatl became Heaven, and Tlalocan became Paradise.|$|E
5|$|The format {{used in the}} 2007 World Cup {{involved}} 16 teams allocated {{into four}} groups of four. Within each group, the teams played {{each other in a}} round-robin format.

The Super 8 teams played the other six teams that progressed from the different groups. Teams earned points in <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>way</b> <b>as</b> <b>the</b> group stage, but carried their points forward from previous matches against the other teams who qualified from the same group to the Super 8 stage. The top four teams from the Super 8 round advanced to the semi-finals, and the winners of the semi-finals played in the final.|$|E
