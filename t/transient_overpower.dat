A parametric study has been performed to determine the optimum combination of lattice pitch, rod diameter, and channel shape-further referred to as geometry-for maximizing power given specific transient conditions for pressurized water reactors (PWR) loaded with either U 02 or UZrH 1. 6 fuel. Several geometries have been examined with the VIPRE subchannel analysis tool along with MATLAB scripts previously developed to automate VIPRE execution. The transients investigated were a large break {{loss of coolant accident}} (LBLOCA), am <b>overpower</b> <b>transient,</b> and a complete loss of flow accident. The maximum achievable power for each geometry is defined as the highest power that can be sustained without exceeding any of the steady state or transient limits. The limits were chosen based on technical feasibility and safety of the reference core and compared with the final safely analysis report (FSAR) of the reference core, the South Texas Project Electric Generating Station (STPEGS), whenever possible. This analysis was performed for two separate pressure drop limits of 29 and 60 psia for both a square array with grid spacers and a hexagonal array with wire wraps. (cont.) The square core geometry sustaining the highest power (4820. 0 MW) for both the hydride and oxide fueled has a pitch of 9. 0 mm and a rod diameter of 6. 5 mm and was limited by the complete loss of flow accident. Both of these maximum power geometries occurred at the 60 psia pressure drop case. The maximum power of the 29 psia pressure drop case (4103. 9 MW) for both fuel types occurred at a pitch of 9. 7 mm and a rod diameter of 6. 5 mm. The maximum power for the hexagonal arrayed cores occurred at the same hydrogen to heavy metal ratio as the square cores. The hydride fueled core power (5123. 2 MW) was limited by the <b>overpower</b> <b>transient</b> while the oxide fueled core power (4996. 1 MW) was limited by the <b>overpower</b> <b>transient.</b> The pressure drop constraint was not limiting for either fuel type for either pressure drop case for the wire wrapped cores. by Jarrod Michael Trant.

The reactor primary and secondary systems have been implemented by assembling both component models already available in a specific thermal-hydraulic library, and ad hoc developed nuclear component models suitably modified according to the specific DEMO configuration. The resulting overall plant simulator, incorporating also the balance of plant, consists in the following essential parts: core, integrated steam generator/primary pump block, cold and hot legs, primary coolant cold pool, turbine, heat sink, secondary coolant pump.

The reactor transient responses following both postulated accident initiators such as Unprotected <b>Transient</b> of <b>OverPower</b> (UTOP), Loss of Heat Sink (ULOHS) and Loss of Flow (ULOF), and an emergency SCRAM event have been studied in MATLAB/SIMULINK® environment. A benchmark analysis has been then performed by means of the SAS 4 A/SASSYS- 1 Liquid Metal Reactor Code System with the purpose of providing verification for the analytical outcomes of the nonlinear model and indicating how the latter relate to more realistic one-dimensional calculations.

40|$|In this paper, a control-oriented {{modelling}} and simulation {{tool for}} the study of the Advanced Lead-cooled Fast Reactor European Demonstrator (ALFRED) plant dynamics is presented. It has been developed in order to perform design-basis transient analyses aimed at providing essential feedbacks for the system design finalization. The simulator has been meant to be modular, open and efficient. In this perspective, an object-oriented modelling approach has been adopted, by employing the reliable, tested and well documented Modelica language. Simulation of core behaviour is based on point kinetics for neutronics and one-dimensional heat transfer models for thermal-hydraulics, coherently with ALFRED specifications. An effort has been spent to model the bayonet-tube Steam Generator (SG) foreseen to be installed within the reactor vessel. The primary loop model has been built by connecting the above-mentioned components (taking into account suitable time delays) and by incorporating the cold pool, which has revealed to be fundamental for an accurate definition of the time constants characteristic of the system because of its large thermal inertia. The description of the overall plant has been finalized by connecting standard turbine, condenser and other components of the balance of plant. Afterwards, the reactor responses to three typical transient initiators have been simulated (i. e., reduction of feedwater mass flow rate, variation of the turbine admission valve coefficient and <b>transient</b> of <b>overpower).</b> Simulation outcomes confirm the strong coupling between core and SG, besides showing the characteristic time constants of the various component responses.

The understanding of MFCI phenomena is essential for study of debris coolability and characteristics during post-accident heat removal.

The test elements were pre-irradiated in the PNL- 10 assembly in EBR-II to 5 at. % burnup at 30 kW/m. The pre-irradiation in EBR-II caused a fuel-restructuring range characteristic of a low-to-moderate power microstructure for FTR. Failure predictions indicated that fuel with this microstructural characteristic would fail at a lower energy deposition than fuel irradiated at higher power. Data from test-vehicle sensors, hodoscope, and postmortem examinations were used to construct {{the sequence of events}} occurring within the test zone. The sequence occurred incoherently across the test cluster, the initial event occurring abruptly at about 29 times nominal power level at an estimated stored energy of about 925 kJ/kg with 50 % of the fuel above the solidus at the suspected failure site. After the initial failure, about 2 % of the total mass of test fuel was ejected above the original top of the active fuel column. Sodium voiding occurred rapidly. A fuel-debris blockage also apparently prevented further fuel dispersal. Inherent test-vehicle limitations, loss of flow-tube geometry, and nontypical power generation after failure may have caused a departure from the fuel motion predicted for FTR conditions.

40|$|Historically, {{unprotected}} transients {{have been}} viewed as design basis events that can significantly challenge sodium-cooled fast reactors. The perceived potential consequences of a severe unprotected transient in a sodium-cooled fast reactor include an energetic core disruptive accident, vessel failure, and a large early release. These consequences can be avoided if unprotected transients are properly defended against, potentially improving the economics of sodium fast reactors. One way to defend against such accidents is to include a highly reliable reactor protection system. The perceived undesirability of the consequences arising from an unprotected transient has led some sodium fast reactor designers to consider incorporating several design modifications to the reactor protection system, including: self-actuated shutdown systems, articulated control rods, and seismic anticipatory scram systems. This study investigates the performance of these systems in sodium fast reactors. To analyze {{the impact of these}} proposed design alternatives, a model to analyze plant performance that incorporates uncertainty analysis is developed using RELAP 5 - 3 D and the ABR- 1000 as the reference design. The performance of the proposed alternatives is analyzed during unprotected loss of flow and unprotected <b>transient</b> <b>overpower</b> scenarios, each exacerbated by a loss of heat sink. The recently developed Technology Neutral Framework is used to contextually rate performance of the proposed alternatives. Ultimately, this thesis offers a methodology for a designer to analyze reactor protection system design efficacy. The principle results of this thesis suggest that when using the Technology Neutral Framework as a licensing framework for a sodium-cooled fast reactor, the two independent scram systems of the ABR- 1000 's reactor protection system perform well enough to screen unprotected transients from the design basis. While a regulator may still require consideration of accidents involving the failure of the reactor protection system, these events will not drive the design of the system. However, self-actuated shutdown systems may be called for to diversify the reactor protection system. Of these, the Curie point latch marginally reduces the conditional cladding damage probability for metal cores because of their rapid inherent feedback effects, but is more effective for the more sluggish oxide cores given reasonably long pump coastdown times. Flow levitated absorbers are highly effective at mitigating unprotected loss of flow events for both fuel types, but are limited in response during unprotected <b>transient</b> <b>overpower</b> events. When considered from a risk-informed perspective, a clear rationale and objective is needed to justify the inclusion of an additional feature such as self-actuated shutdown systems. The use of articulated safety rods as one of the diverse means of reactivity insertion and the implementation of an anticipatory seismic scram system may be the most cost-effective alternatives to provide defense in depth in light of the sodium fast reactor's susceptibility to seismic events. by Jacob D.

The simulator, realized in the MATLAB/SIMULINK® environment, is composed of five essential parts: core, steam generator, primary pump, collectors, and coolant cold pool. An analytical lumped-parameter core model has been developed to treat the coupling between neutronics and thermal-hydraulics. For the steam generator a moving boundary approach has been adopted, allowing to get the physical behavior while satisfying the controller specifications, besides assuring coherence with the zero-dimensional core modeling. The complete primary loop model has been assembled by connecting the above-mentioned main subsystems through the hot and cold collectors, and by adding the remaining components blocks. Five different transients have been then simulated to analyze the whole system dynamic behavior in a control-oriented perspective: three scenarios have been initiated by acting on the secondary water side (i. e., enhancement of feedwater mass flow rate and temperature, and turbine admission valve coefficient variation), and two by perturbing the primary side nominal state (i. e., simulations of Unprotected Loss of Flow, ULOF, and of Unprotected <b>Transient</b> of <b>OverPower,</b> UTOP).

Different inert and absorbing matrices {{as well as}} lattice configurations were assessed {{in order to identify}} suitable fuel and core design configurations. Monte Carlo transport and burnup codes were used in the analyses. The lattice pin pitch was varied to optimize the source efficiency and coolant void worth while respecting key thermal and material-related design constraints posed by fuel and cladding. A HfN matrix appeared to provide a good combination of neutronic, burnup, and safety characteristics: maintaining a hard neutron spectrum, yielding acceptable coolant void reactivity and source efficiency, and alleviating the burnup reactivity swing. A conceptual design of a (TRU,Hf) N fueled, lead-bismuth eutectic-cooled accelerator-driven system was developed. Twice higher neutron fission-toabsorption probabilities in Am isotopes were achieved compared to reactor designs relying on ZrN or YN inert matrix fuel. The production of higher actinides in the fuel cycle is hence limited, with a Cm fraction in the equilibrium fuel being; 40 % lower than for cores with ZrN matrix-based fuel.

40|$|This work {{contributes}} to the Hydride Fuels Project, a collaborative effort between UC Berkeley and MIT aimed at investigating {{the potential benefits of}} hydride fuel use in light water reactors (LWRs). Core design is accomplished for both hydride and oxide-fueled cores over a range of geometries via steady-state and transient thermal hydraulic analyses, which yield the maximum power, and fuel performance and neutronics studies, which provide the achievable discharge burnup. The final optimization integrates the outputs from these separate studies into an economics model to identify geometries offering the lowest cost of electricity, and provide a fair basis for comparing the performance of hydride and oxide fuels. This work focuses on the steady-state and transient thermal hydraulic as well as economic analyses for PWR cores utilizing wire wraps in a hexagonal array with UZrH 1. 6 and UO 2. It was previously verified that square and hexagonal arrays with matching rod diameters and H/HM ratio have the same thermal hydraulic performance. In this work, this equivalence is extended to hexagonal wire wrap arrays, and verified by comparing the thermal hydraulic performance of a single hexagonal wire wrap core with its equivalent square array core with grid spacers. A separate neutronics equivalence is developed, {{based on the assumption that}} arrays with matching rod diameters and H/HM ratios will have identical neutronic performance. Steady-state design limits were separated into hard limits, which must be satisfied, or soft limits, which serve to keep the design reasonable. Design limits were placed on the pressure drop, critical heat flux (CHF), vibrations, and fuel and cladding temperature. Vibrations limits on the wire wrap assemblies were imposed for flow induced vibrations (FIV) and thermal hydraulic vibrations (THV). (cont.) An analysis of the fretting wear of wire wraps was performed, which outperformed the analogous fretting wear analysis for grid spacers. A CHF study found wire wraps to outperform grid spacers. LOCA and <b>overpower</b> <b>transient</b> analyses were performed for wire wraps. The <b>overpower</b> <b>transient</b> was analyzed over a range of geometries, and found to be more limiting than the steady-state analysis. The LOCA was analyzed for various powers at the reference geometry and another geometry of interest. Through all of these analyses, it was determined that the thermal hydraulic performance of UZrH 1. 6 and UO 2 are very similar. The optimal wire wrap designs were found to have significantly higher maximum powers than the reference core, allowing for uprates up to - 54 %. This is due to improved vibrations, pressure drop, and CHF. The steady-state and transient analyses were combined with fuel performance and neutronic studies into an economics model that determines the optimal geometries for incorporation into existing PWR's. The model also provides a basis for comparing the performance of UZrH 1. 6 to UO 2 for a range of core geometries. Results presented herein show cost savings for oxide fuel with wire wraps over grid spacers of at least 0. 8 mils/kWe-hr, or 4 %, due to power increases predicted by the thermal hydraulic analyses. Wire wrap UZrHI. 6 has a COE savings over U 02 of 0. 7 mils/kWe-hr, or 4 %. Due to the large power uprates possible, a utility could achieve a cost savings of up to 10. 9 mils/kWe-hr, or 40 %, with a UZrH 1. 6 wire wrap uprate instead of building a new core. by Peter Ray Diller.

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{the implications of}} using a risk-informed licensing framework to inform the design of Sodium Fast Reactors. NUREG- 1860, more {{commonly known as the}} Technology Neutral Framework (TNF), is a risk-informed licensing process drafted by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission's (NRC) Office of Nuclear Regulatory Research. The TNF determines the acceptability of accident sequences by examining the 95 th percentile estimate of both the frequency and quantity of radioactive material release and compares this value to predetermined limits on a Frequency-Consequence Curve. In order to apply this framework, two generic pool type sodium reactors, one using metal fuel and one using oxide fuel, were modeled in RELAP 5 - 3 D {{in order to determine the}} transient response of reactors to unprotected <b>transient</b> <b>overpower</b> and unprotected loss of flow events. Important transient characteristics, such as the reactivity coefficients, were treated as random variables which determine the success or failure of surviving the transient. In this context, success is defined as the cladding remaining intact and the avoidance of sodium boiling. In order to avoid running an excessive amount of simulations, the epistemic uncertainties around the random variables are sampled using importance sampling. For metallic fuel, the rate of fuel/cladding eutectic formation has typically been modeled as an Arrhenius process which depends only on the temperature of the fuel/cladding interface. Between the 1960 s and the 1990 s, numerous experiments have been conducted which indicate that the rate of fuel/cladding eutectic formation is more complex, depending upon fuel/cladding interfacial temperature, fuel constituents (uranium metal or uranium zirconium), cladding type (stainless steel 316, D 9 or HT 9), linear power, plutonium enrichment and burnup. This thesis improves the modeling accuracy of eutectic formation through the application of multivariable regression using a database of fuel/cladding eutectic experiments and determines that the remaining uncertainty governing the rate of eutectic formation should not significantly affect the frequency of cladding failure for tested cladding options. The general conclusion from this thesis is that when using NUREG- 1860 to license metal or oxide fueled SFRs, it is steady state, not transient, cladding considerations which control optimal operating temperature, currently corresponding to an approximate core outlet temperature of 550 °C. Metallic cores traditionally have been designed with core outlet temperatures of 510 °C and increasing this temperature to 550 °C may decrease the busbar cost by 19 % when combined with the adoption of a Supercritical-CO₂ power conversion cycle, reduced containment requirements, and Printed Circuit Heat Exchangers. While both fuel types will be shown to meet the NUREG- 1860 requirements, the frequency of radiation release for unprotected loss of flow and unprotected <b>transient</b> <b>overpower</b> events for metallic fuel has been shown to be orders of magnitude lower than for oxide fuel. by Matthew R.

According to the project task definition, the pin failure and fuel dispersion scenarios in severe accidents have to be extensively studied for reactor safety analysis. In this paper, the unprotected severe transients analyses for the MYRRHA-FASTEF critical core were performed using SIMMER-III code. The aim of the current work was to obtain a deeper understanding of core material redistribution processes before and after pin damage, since the Archimedes force could move pellets, chunks and fuel particles upwards out of the core and redistribute them into the upper pool region and peripheral structures. Starting the simulations with the steady state calculation, relevant parameters reflect good agreement with the design operational conditions. For the transients three postulated severe accident scenarios were proposed that may possibly lead to pin failure and furthermore core damage: unprotected loss of flow (ULOF), unprotected <b>transient</b> <b>overpower</b> (UTOP) and unprotected blockage accident (UBA), where in particular the entrance of fuel assembly is blocked as a side window is still open. The three transients, starting from the steady state conditions, have been investigated.

As a matter of fact, the Molten Salt Fast Reactor (MSFR) has been recognized as a long term alternative to solid-fuelled fast neutron systems and has been identified as reference Gen-IV configuration. Although considerable studies have been carried out for the analysis of the graphite-moderated MSR dynamics, the adoption of a fast spectrum configuration without graphite in the core is expected to notably modify the dynamic behavior of the system, thus requiring further investigation. In this paper, a preliminary analysis of the MSFR dynamics is performed allowing for the evaluation of the impact of some safety parameters (e. g., feedback coefficients and delayed neutron fraction) on the system behavior for different fuel cycle strategies. For this purpose, a simplified non-linear onedimensional model of the primary circuit has been developed and the dynamic response of the system has been investigated with reference to different significant transient initiators, namely: unprotected <b>transient</b> <b>overpower,</b> unprotected loss of flow, and unprotected loss of heat sink.

50|$|The IFR uses {{metal alloy}} fuel (uranium/plutonium/zirconium) {{which is a}} good {{conductor}} of heat, unlike the LWR's (and even some fast breeder reactors') uranium oxide which is a poor conductor of heat and reaches high temperatures at the center of fuel pellets. The IFR also has a smaller volume of fuel, since the fissile material is diluted with fertile material by a ratio of 5 or less, compared to about 30 for LWR fuel. The IFR core requires more heat removal per core volume during operation than the LWR core; but on the other hand, after a shutdown, there is far less trapped heat that is still diffusing out and needs to be removed. However, decay heat generation from short-lived fission products and actinides is comparable in both cases, starting at a high level and decreasing with time elapsed after shutdown. The high volume of liquid sodium primary coolant in the pool configuration is designed to absorb decay heat without reaching fuel melting temperature. The primary sodium pumps are designed with flywheels so they will coast down slowly (90 seconds) if power is removed. This coast-down further aids core cooling upon shutdown. If the primary cooling loop were to be somehow suddenly stopped, or if the control rods were suddenly removed, the metal fuel can melt as accidentally demonstrated in EBR-I, however the melting fuel is then extruded up the steel fuel cladding tubes and out of the active core region leading to permanent reactor shutdown and no further fission heat generation or fuel melting. With metal fuel, the cladding is not breached and no radioactivity is released even in extreme <b>overpower</b> <b>transients.</b>|$|R
40|$|In this paper, a {{preliminary}} {{approach to the}} definition of a suitable control strategy for the Advanced Lead Fast Reactor European Demonstrator (ALFRED), developed within the European 7 th Framework Program, has been undertaken. The Generation IV reactors offer new challenges for what concerns the nuclear power plant control since several constraints both on primary and secondary loops have to be faced, differently from the conventional Light Water Reactors. A simulator of the ALFRED plant has been developed in a previous work (Ponciroli et al., 2014) with the main purpose of studying the system free dynamics and stability features in a control-oriented perspective. Based on the outcomes of these investigations, in the present work, the possibility of adopting decentralized control schemes has been investigated. Accordingly, Single Input Single Output control laws have been applied directly to the selected couples of inputeoutput variables, which have been identified first {{on the basis of the}} preliminary plant dynamics analyses, and then confirmed by the indications of the Relative Gain Array method. Afterwards, two different control schemes have been studied depending on the number of available inputs, and then implemented and compared in order to evaluate the effect of each control action on the associated potential control strategy effectiveness. As a last step, the ALFRED control system has been finalized. The regulator design has been set up based on a simultaneous feedforward-feedback scheme incorporating four closed feedback loops. A controlled power reduction and a controlled <b>overpower</b> <b>transient</b> have been simulated in order to assess the performance of the two proposed control schemes. Results show that both the adopted control strategies can assure an efficient control of the thermal power while guaranteeing an effective control of lead and steam temperatures as well.

40|$|This report {{advances}} the Hydride Fuels Project, {{a collaborative}} effort between UC Berkeley and MIT aimed at investigating {{the potential benefits of}} hydride fuel use in light water reactors (LWRs). This effort involves implementing an appropriate methodology for design and optimization of hydride and oxide fueled cores. Core design is accomplished for a range of geometries via steady-state and transient thermal hydraulic analyses, which yield the maximum power, and fuel performance and neutronics studies, which provide the achievable discharge burnup. The final optimization integrates the outputs from these separate studies into an economics model to identify geometries offering the lowest cost of electricity, and provide a fair basis for comparing the performance of hydride and oxide fuels. This report builds on the considerable work which has already been accomplished on the project. More specifically, it focuses on the steady-state and transient thermal hydraulic and economic analyses for pressurized water reactor (PWR) cores utilizing UZrH[subscript 1. 6] and UO[subscript 2]. A previous MIT study established the steady-state thermal hydraulic design methodology for determining maximum power from square array PWR core designs. In lieu of a detailed vibrations analysis, the steady-state thermal hydraulic analysis imposed a single design limit on the axial flow velocity. The wide range of core geometries considered and the large power increases reported by the study makes it prudent to refine this single limit approach. This work accomplishes this by developing and incorporating additional design limits into the thermal hydraulic analysis to prevent excessive rod vibration and wear. The vibrations and wear mechanisms considered are: vortex-induced vibration, fluid-elastic instability, turbulence-induced vibration, fretting wear, and sliding wear. Further, the transients investigated are an <b>overpower</b> <b>transient,</b> a large break loss of coolant accident (LBLOCA), and a complete loss of flow accident. In parallel with this work, students at UC Berkeley and MIT have undertaken the neutronics and fuel performance studies. With these results, and the output from the steady-state thermal hydraulic analysis with vibrations and wear imposed design limits, as well as transient thermal hydraulic analysis, an economics model is employed to determine the optimal geometries for incorporation into existing PWRs. The model also provides a basis for comparing the performance of UZrH[subscript 1. 6] to UO[subscript 2] for a range of core geometries. Though this analysis focuses only on these fuels, the methodology can easily be extended to additional hydride and oxide fuel types, and will be in the future. Results presented herein do not show significant cost savings for UZrH[subscript 1. 6], primarily because the power and energy generation per core loading for both fuels with square arrays supported by grid spacers are similar. Furthermore, the most economic geometries typically do not occur where power increases are reported by the thermal hydraulics. However, preliminary analysis with the lower pressure drop characteristics of wire wraps compared to grids suggest that hexagonal array cores with wire wraps will allow tight (P over D ≺ 1. 25) packing which yield significantly better power performance. This should allow hydride fuel to outperform oxide fuel since this tight core region is not accessible to oxide cores, because of neutronic constraints...|$|R
40|$|A 2400 MWth liquid-salt cooled {{flexible}} {{conversion ratio}} reactor was designed, utilizing the ternary chloride salt NaCl-KCl-MgCI 2 (30 %- 20 %- 50 %) as coolant. The reference design uses a wire-wrapped, hex lattice core, {{and is able}} to achieve a core power density of 130 kW/ 1 with a core pressure drop of 700 kPa and a maximum cladding temperature under 650 'C. Four kidney- shaped conventional tube-in-shell heat exchangers are used to connect the primary system to a 5450 C supercritical CO 2 power conversion system. The core, intermediate heat exchangers, and reactor coolant pumps fit in a vessel approximately 10 meters in diameter and less than 20 meters high. Lithium expansion modules (LEMs) were used to reconcile conflicting thermal hydraulic and reactor physics requirements in the liquid salt core. Use of LEMs allowed the design of a very favorable reactivity response which greatly benefits transient mitigation. A reactor vessel auxiliary cooling system (RVACS) and four redundant passive secondary auxiliary cooling systems (PSACS) are used to provide passive heat removal, and are able to successfully mitigate both an unprotected station blackout transient as well as protected transients in which a scram occurs. Additionally, it was determined that the power conversion system can be used to mitigate both a loss of flow accident and an unprotected <b>transient</b> <b>overpower.</b> by Robert C. Petroski.

40|$|PASCAR is a 100 MWt/ 35 MWe lead-bismuth-cooled small modular reactor which {{requires}} no on-site refueling and well suits {{to be used}} as a distributed power source in either a single unit or a cluster for electricity, heat supply, and desalination. This paper includes both steady-state and transient performance evaluations for neutronics and thermal-hydraulics. Through design optimization studies for minimizing a burn-up reactivity loss, the metallic fuels-loaded core was designed with less than 1 $ reactivity swing over 20 -year cycle. A radial peaking power location shows the slow inward migration from outer enrichment zones while maintaining peaking factor within 1. 35, reducing radiation damage and corrosion duty of high temperature environments. Equipped with coolant flow path large enough to ensure low pressure drop, this reactor is intended to operate by only natural circulation of chemically inert coolant within relatively low temperature range, 320 - 420 degrees C. Peak outlet temperature is nearly 450 degrees C where an Al-containing duplex cladding has sufficient corrosion resistance. Despite of 50 % decrease of fuel thermal conductivity after swelling, inherent negative reactivity feedback and passive decay heat removal capability could secure an ample safety margin of peak fuel centerline temperature in tow safety analyses, unprotected <b>transient</b> <b>overpower</b> and unprotected loss of heat sink. The likelihood of loss of coolant, loss of flow, and local blockage is virtually eliminated by employing respectively a double-walled vessel, pump-less cooling, and cross-flow allowed open square assemblies. Simple fabrication, modular construction, and long burning cycle would compensate for economic disadvantages over smaller power and lower temperature than those of conventional fast reactors.

40|$|From {{a series}} of five tests {{conducted}} in EBR-II, a substantial data base has been established {{on the performance of}} mixed-oxide fuel elements in a liquid-metal-cooled reactor under slow-ramp <b>transient</b> <b>overpower</b> conditions. Each test contained 19 preirradiated fuel elements with varying design and prior operating histories. Elements with aggressive design features, such as high fuel smear density and/or thin cladding, were included to accentuate transient effects. The ramp rates were either 0. 1 or 10 % {Delta}P/P/s and the overpowers ranged between {approx} 60 and 100 % of the elements` prior power ratings. Six elements breached during the tests, all with aggressive design parameters. The other elements, including all those with moderate design features for the reference or advanced long-life drivers for PNC`s prototype fast reactor Monju, maintained their cladding integrity during the tests. Posttest examination results indicated that fuel/cladding mechanical interaction (FCMI) was the most significant mechanism causing the cladding strain and breach. In contrast, pressure loading from the fission gas in the element plenum was less important, even in high-burnup elements. During an overpower transient, FCMI arises from fuel/cladding differential thermal expansion, transient fuel swelling, and, significantly, the gas pressure in the sealed central cavity of elements with substantial centerline fuel melting. Fuel performance data from these tests, including cladding breaching margin and transient cladding strain, are correlatable with fuel-element design and operating parameters. These correlations are being incorporated into fuel-element behavior codes. At the two tested ramp rates, fuel element behavior appears to be insensitive to transient ramp rate and {{there appears to be no}} particular vulnerability to slow ramp transients as previously perceived...|$|E
40|$|Heavy liquid metal (HLM - lead or lead bismuth eutectic) is {{considered}} as a candidate coolant for next-generation fast reactor and accelerate-driven systems (ADS), due to its favorable chemical, thermo-physical and neutronic properties in comparison with sodium which {{has been used as}} coolant in fast breeder reactors (FBRs). To perform design-base-accident analysis for the HLM-cooled reactors, the well-known transient thermal-hydraulic analysis codes (e. g., RELAP 5 and TRACE) are being applied to the reactors with the new coolant. Since these codes were originally developed for light water reactors (LWRs), validations are necessary to ensure the codes to count all influences of the thermo-physical properties of HLM. In this thesis, the TRACE code is employed to simulate the transients performed on the TALL test facility which is a medium-size loop for thermal-hydraulic study of lead bismuth eutectic (LBE). The objectives of the present work are two-fold: i) to interpret the transients performed on the test facility; ii) to qualify the capabilities of the TRACE code for HLM-cooled system by using the experimental data and then perform separate-effect study beyond the experimental conditions. The transients related to safety issues such as loss of heat sink, loss of primary pump, loss of both primary/secondary pumps, overpower and accelerator trip are chosen in the simulations. In addition, the operational transients, the startup and the shut-down of the system are also simulated, respectively. Two configurations of the facility are considered: Configuration-A with a core tank, and Configuration-B with a fuel rod simulator. The separate-effect study is conducted to investigate the effects of coolant inventory, LBE flow resistance and mass flowrate in the secondary loop on natural circulation in the primary loop. Generally speaking, for all the cases analyzed in the present study, the calculation results have a good agreement with the experimental data for the primary side (LBE) parameters (e. g., variations in temperature and mass flowrate). Specifically, the simulation for the transient loss of heat sink indicates the same tendency as in the experiment in term of temperature: it is rising at the inlet and outlet of the core simulator, as well as at those of the intermediate heat exchanger. The temperature keeps going up till the resumption of the heat sink as a protective measure, and then it decreases sharply at the very beginning and gradually returns to steady-state conditions. For the transient loss of primary pump, the temperature level is elevated and a significant natural circulation in the primary loop obtained. The simulation well reproduces the establishing process of natural circulation and final flowrate, but it overestimates the peak temperature. Such simulation outcome II applies to the transient ―loss of both primary and secondary pumps‖, except for a further elevated temperature. The calculation results of the <b>transients</b> startup and <b>overpower</b> are perfectly matching the experimental data, especially when approaching the final steady state, while the transients of shutdown and heater trip are underestimated in their final temperatures but the trends are well captured in both the transients. In general, the transient time to a steady state or the maximum temperature level of Configuration-B is much shorter than that of Configuration-A, mainly because of the larger inventory of LBE in Configuration-A. The separate-effect study also shows that the LBE inventory in the primary loop plays a mitigative role in the transients. For the loss of primary pump transient, decrease in primary flow resistance and increase in secondary flowrate all contributes to passive safety.

40|$|In this thesis, the {{feasibility}} {{to use a}} medium sized sodium cooled fast reactor fully loaded with MOX fuel for efficient transmutation of americium is investigated by simulating the safety performance of a BN 600 -type fast reactor loaded with different fractions of americium in the fuel, using the safety parameters obtained with the SERPENT Monte Carlo code. The focus is on americium mainly due to its long-term contribution to the radiotoxicity of spent nuclear fuel and its deterioration on core's safety parameters. Applying the SAS 4 A/SASSYS transient analysis code, it is demonstrated that the power rating needs to be reduced by 6 % for each percent additional americium introduction into the reference MOX fuel, maintaining 100 K margin to fuel melting, {{which is the most}} limiting failure mechanism. Safety analysis of a new Accelerator Driven System design with a smaller pin pitch-to-diameter ratio comparing to the reference EFIT- 400 design, aiming at improving neutron source efficiency, was also performed by simulating performance for unprotected loss of flow, unprotected <b>transient</b> <b>overpower,</b> and protected loss-of-heat-sink transients, using neutronic parameters obatined from MCNP calculations. Thanks to the introduction of the austenitic 15 / 15 Ti stainless steel with enhanced creep rupture resistance and acceptable irradiation swelling rate, the suggested ADS design loaded with nitride fuel and cooled by lead-bismuth eutectic could survive the full set of transients, preserving a margin of 130 K to cladding rupture during the most limiting transient. The thesis concludes that efficient transmutation of americium in a medium sized sodium cooled fast reactor loaded with MOX fuel is possible but leads to a severe power penalty. Instead, preserving transmutation rates of minor actinides up to 42 kg/TWhth, the suggested ADS design with enhanced proton source efficiency appears like a better option for americium transmutation.

The approach discussed in this chapter is applied to different case studies in order to demonstrate the MPM adequacy to perform preliminary safety analysis. In particular, two innovative Generation IV systems are taken into account, namely the Molten Salt Reactor (MSR) and the Lead-cooled Fast Reactor (LFR). The MPM approach is particularly well suited to the MSR, which features a liquid fuel that also serves as coolant.

Both transients are simulated showing that the multi-physics modelling gives additional information when compared to simplified thermal-hydraulic description. As for the LFR, the ULOF transient represents a minor accident because of the weaker coupling between thermal-hydraulic conditions and neutronics, whereas the insertion of prompt reactivity must be considered as a main accident scenario in the safety analysis. In this chapter, the MPM theoretical basis is first summarized, and compared with the classical CCT approach.

40|$|In {{order to}} fulfill the goals set forth by the Generation IV International Forum, the current NERI funded {{research}} has focused on the design of a Gas-cooled Fast Reactor (GFR) operating in a Breed and Burnm (B&B) fuel cycle mode. B&B refers to a once-through fuel cycle where low enriched uranium (less than 5 w/o 235 U in U) subcritical assemblies are loaded into the core in equilibrium, yet in-situ plutonium breeding carries the fuel through a discharge burnup on the order of 150 MWD/kgHM. The B&B fuel cycle meets the GenIV goals of sustainability, economics, and proliferation resistance by increasing fuel burnup without the need for spent fuel reprocessing, recycle, or reuse of any kind. The neutronic requirements for B&B are strict and require an ultra-hard neutron spectrum. Therefore, the GFR is ideally suited for this fuel cycle. In the present work the B&B GFR concept evolved into two practical reactor designs, both of which build on extensive previous gas-cooled reactor design experience. The first version is the "demonstration" concept using highly neutronically reactive U 15 N fuel in a hexagonal pin fuel array that is nearly 50 v/o fuel. The core is helium cooled, with an outlet temperature of 570 °C. The helium primary circuit is coupled to a steam Rankine power conversion system essentially identical to that for the British Advanced Gas-cooled Reactors. One advantage of the low coolant temperature compared to other GenIV GFR concepts is that it allows for the use of oxide dispersion strengthened stainless steels (ODS) in core. The fuel is manufactured using advanced vibration compaction techniques, clad in ODS, and vented in order to achieve the high burnup goal. The second version, the "advanced" concept builds on the experience of the demonstration concept to develop a B&B GFR without the need for expensive U' 5 N fuel. In order to substitute the nitride fuel with carbide, significantly higher heavy metal loadings are required (60 v/o fuel for UC versus 50 v/o fuel for U' 5 N) which are not practically achievable with a conventional pin fuel array. Therefore, an innovative tube-in-duct assembly design was proposed to achieve B&B operation with the less neutronically reactive carbide fuel. The advanced core offers significantly reduced natural uranium requirements and lower equilibrium fuel cycle costs (5 mills/kWhre) compared with conventional light water reactors (7 mills/kWhre), as the burnup is tripled for the same reload enrichment. (cont.) The B&B GFR designs, though requiring active decay heat removal, are semi-self-regulating from a reactivity feedback standpoint and are designed to withstand all plausible accident scenarios, including loss of flow, loss of heat sink, and <b>transient</b> <b>overpower</b> all without scram. Reactor pressure vessel blowdown (LOCA) was investigated and while the B&B GFR has a low positive coolant void reactivity (less than 1 $), the added reactivity during blowdown is compensated through other strong negative reactivity feedback mechanisms, thereby allowing for the safe operation of the B&B GFR. by Peter Yarsky.

40|$|Recently, MIT's Center for Advanced Nuclear Energy Systems {{developed}} a new high burnup annular fuel that features {{both internal and external}} cooling. Implementation of this fuel design in current pressurized water reactors (PWRs) will allow power uprates up to 50 % while maintaining or improving its existing thermal and safety margins. Each annular fuel assembly is arranged in a 13 x 13 array but has the same side dimensions as a 17 x 17 solid fuel assembly. Even at much higher power densities, the peak fuel temperatures are substantially lower and the MDNBR is comparable to that of solid fuel at 100 % power. The main motivation for utilizing this fuel is the lower capital construction cost per kilowatt of electrical production compared to new reactors using solid fuel. To elaborate on the previous work, three remaining issues were addressed: the shutdown margin deficiency at 50 % uprated power, effect of inner channel flow restrictions due to crud buildup and obstructions, and the economic impact of a fleet of reactors using high burnup annular fuel. All of the work was done using computer codes specializing in core neutronics, thermal hydraulics, and fuel cycle analysis. The reduced shutdown margin was found to be caused mainly by a reduction in control material volume coupled with a higher power density. This issue was resolved by changing the control material from traditional Ag-In-Cd to 25 wt% B- 10 enriched B₄C. Increasing the control rod surface area was also investigated as a possible solution but it was revealed that any departure from the cylindrical shape would lead to a reduction in control volume which resulted in decreased rod worth. Simultaneous oxide growth and crud buildup on the inner cladding of the annular fuel was simulated in a whole core thermal-hydraulics model to determine the maximum thickness that the annular fuel can tolerate while maintaining an MDNBR greater than 1. 3 under <b>transient</b> <b>overpower</b> conditions. (cont.) Under very conservative conditions, the maximum tolerable thickness was calculated to be a uniform 50 [mu]m layer of combined oxide and corrosion on the inner and outer cladding surfaces of the hot rod. Under full power conditions, the fuel was found to be able to tolerate a 35 - 40 % blockage of the hot rod's inner channel. However, the prospect of plugging can be regarded as very hypothetical since debris filters in PWRs have a mesh spacing smaller than the fuel's inner channel diameter. The fuel cycle analysis code CAFCA SD was modified to include the capability to model the effect of LWRs using high burnup annular fuel on the US fuel cycle. At a given date, annular fuel can be introduced to the once-through fuel cycle via Generation II reactor uprates or construction of Generation Ill reactors. Results showed that constructing new 1. 5 GWe reactors using annular fuel resulted in the greatest reduction in the cost of electricity due to its low capital construction cost. Total spent fuel was also reduced due to the reduced amount of reactors required to fulfill power demand. However, compared to traditional 4. 5 wt% enriched solid fuel, using the higher enriched annular fuel for an entire fleet of LWRs would require a greater uranium mining rate. Overall, all three of these studies alleviate some concerns about annular fuel and serve to boost its attractiveness and feasibility for use on an industrial scale. by Bo Feng. Thesis (S. M. and S.
