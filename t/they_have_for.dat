25|$|Indigenous Australians have a {{long history}} with the flora of Western Australia. <b>They</b> <b>have</b> <b>for</b> over 50,000 years {{obtained}} detailed information on most plants. The information includes its uses as sources for food, shelter, tools and medicine. As Indigenous Australians passed the knowledge along orally or by example, most of this information has been lost, along many of the names they gave the flora. It was not until Europeans started to explore Western Australia that systematic written details of the flora commenced.|$|E
25|$|The {{music critic}} and {{producer}} Joachim-Ernst Berendt took an eminent position at this time, influencing German jazz {{mainly in the}} 1960s and 1970s.

25|$|Bud Selig (then-Commissioner of Baseball) said in 2014 that he {{had never}} {{received}} a complaint about the logo.

25|$|An on-site warden at {{the park}} (http://www.chillinghamwildcattle.com) leads small groups on foot to find the Chillingham cattle herd; on some days they are evident {{in one of the}} easily {{accessible}} meadows, while on rare occasions they can be difficult to find without a fair bit of walking, given the tangled woodlands and the amount of space <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>for</b> roaming. Just to the east of the park is the summit of Ros Hill. The cattle are not visible from this viewpoint, which does however give an impressive view over much of north Northumberland. With support from Defra, a network of paths has been created around the periphery of Chillingham Park (http://countrywalks.defra.gov.uk).|$|E

25|$|On November 6, 2007, Zuckerberg {{announced}} Beacon, {{a social}} advertising system that enabled people {{to share information}} with their Facebook friends based on their browsing activities on other sites.

The program came under scrutiny because of privacy concerns from groups and individual users.

25|$|Piezon & Donaldson {{argue in}} a 2005 {{analysis}} that special {{attention should be}} paid to the physical separation, social isolation, and temporal distance associated with distance education courses, which may induce social loafing. In terms of group size, they assert that there is no significant gain in small groups larger than six unless the group is brainstorming, and that the optimal group size may be five members. Suggestions that <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>for</b> online groups include clarifying roles and responsibilities, providing performance data for comparison with other groups, and mandating high levels of participation consisting of attending group meetings, using the discussion board, and participating in chats.|$|E
25|$|Neural field {{models are}} another {{important}} tool in studying neural oscillations {{and are a}} mathematical framework describing evolution of variables such as mean firing rate in space and time. In modeling the activity {{of large numbers of}} neurons, the central idea is to take the density of neurons to the continuum limit, resulting in spatially continuous neural networks. Instead of modelling individual neurons, this approach approximates a group of neurons by its average properties and interactions. It is based on the mean field approach, an area of statistical physics that deals with large-scale systems. Models based on these principles have been used to provide mathematical descriptions of neural oscillations and EEG rhythms. <b>They</b> <b>have</b> <b>for</b> instance been used to investigate visual hallucinations.|$|E

25|$|Player {{and team}} {{strategy}} {{varies depending on}} the size and layout of the field and the total number and experience level of players. The most basic strategy is to coordinate with the team to distribute the team members across the field roughly perpendicular to the line between starting stations to cover all potential lines of advance; a team that runs all in the same direction is easily flanked by opponents moving around the field on the opposite side. A second basic goal is to control as much of the field as possible, as early as possible, either by being the first to get to advantageous obstacles on the field or by quickly eliminating one or more opponents {{to reduce the number of}} directions each player has to watch for incoming paint. The more territory that the members of a team have behind them, the more options <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>for</b> choosing effective cover and changing position to get a good shot at one or more opponents, and because the field is of finite size, the fewer options the opposing team has.|$|E

500|$|Before {{the area}} was urbanized, mammals such as bighorn sheep, mule deer, coyote, wolves, beaver, muskrat and jack rabbits would have been seen along the river.

The final count of the hunt included [...] "two bears, two wolverines, two wildcats, 783 wolves, 409 foxes, 31 minks, nine eagles, 530 magpies, hawks and owls, and 1,026 ravens." [...] None of the original large mammals is found along the Jordan River today; <b>they</b> <b>have,</b> <b>for</b> the most part, been replaced by raccoons, red foxes and domestic pets.

They then try to rob a corner shop and Joanna tells Alan to sit on the shopkeeper to restrain her, but this causes Alan to accidentally suffocate her. Back at the hospital, Boyce begins to miss Alan after discovering his replacement is worse than him.

In [...] "Masquerade" [...] and [...] "Booster", Lois convinces Clark to develop an alter-ego as a way of hiding his true identity as the heroic [...] "Blur".
