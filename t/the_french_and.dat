5|$|According to {{historian}} Jean-Francois Lozier, {{the factors}} influencing {{the course of}} war and peace throughout the region of New-France were not exclusive to the relations between <b>the</b> <b>French</b> <b>and</b> Iroquois, or those between <b>the</b> <b>French</b> <b>and</b> British crowns. A number of factors provide context for the Lachine Massacre.|$|E
5|$|At {{the start}} of the siege, Gibraltar was garrisoned by around 2,000 Dutch, English, Austrian and pro-Habsburg Spanish troops facing a besieging force of up to 8,000 French, pro-Bourbon Spanish and Irish troops. The {{defenders}} were able to hold off the numerically superior besieging force through exploiting Gibraltar's geography and the small town's fortifications, though they were frequently short of manpower and ammunition. The besiegers were undermined by disputes between <b>the</b> <b>French</b> <b>and</b> Spanish officers and terrible conditions in their trenches and bastions, which led to outbreaks of epidemic disease and undermined morale. Sea power proved crucial, as the French navy sought unsuccessfully to prevent the Grand Alliance shipping in fresh troops, ammunition and food. Three naval battles were fought during the siege, two of which were clear defeats for <b>the</b> <b>French</b> <b>and</b> the last of which resulted in the siege being abandoned as hopeless after nine months of fruitless shelling. The outcome was disastrous for <b>the</b> <b>French</b> <b>and</b> Bourbon Spanish side, which was said to have lost 10,000 men against only 400 for the Grand Alliance.|$|E

5|$|On July 6, <b>the</b> <b>French</b> <b>and</b> American armies met at White Plains, {{north of}} New York City. Although Rochambeau had almost 40 years of warfare experience, he never {{challenged}} Washington's authority, telling Washington {{he had come}} to serve, not to command.|$|E

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>French</b> <b>and</b> Indian War {{was between}} the nations of Great Britain and France, along with the {{numerous}} Native American Nations allied with both. <b>The</b> <b>French</b> <b>and</b> Indian war was the North American theater of the Seven Years' War being fought in Europe at the time. Growing population in British territory throughout North America forced expansion west; however, this was met with resistance from <b>the</b> <b>French</b> <b>and</b> their Native American allies. French forces began entering British territory, building numerous forts in preparation to defend the newly acquired land. The {{beginning of the war}} favored <b>the</b> <b>French</b> <b>and</b> their Native American allies, who were able to defeat British forces time and again, and it was not until 1756 that the British were able to hold off their opposition. Pittsburgh was a center for fighting during <b>the</b> <b>French</b> <b>and</b> Indian War, namely because of the geographical location at the center where three rivers unite: the Allegheny, the Monongahela and the Ohio. The location of present-day Pittsburgh provided an advantage in naval control. Ownership of this point provided not only naval dominance, but it also expanded economic ventures, enabling shipments to be sent and received with relative ease. French and British forces both claimed ownership to this region; the French installing Fort Duquesne and the British with Fort Pitt. Fort Pitt was established in 1758 after French forces abandoned and destroyed Fort Duquesne. <b>The</b> <b>French</b> <b>and</b> Indian War came to an end in 1763, after British forces were able to secure Quebec and Montreal from <b>the</b> <b>French</b> <b>and</b> on February 10, the Treaty of Paris was signed. The French were forced to surrender their territory in North America, giving England control {{all the way to the}} Mississippi River. The effects of this war were heavily felt in the North American British colonies. England imposed many taxes on colonists in order to control the newly acquired territory. These tensions would soon culminate into a war for independence as well as a shift in power for dominance in the economic world.|$|E

5|$|While France {{respected}} the deadline, the Libyans limited themselves to retiring some forces, while maintaining at least 3,000 men stationed in Northern Chad.
