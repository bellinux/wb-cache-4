500|$|While some {{commentators}} claimed Mercury hid his sexual orientation from the public, others {{claimed he was}} [...] "openly gay". In December 1974, when asked directly, [...] "So how about being bent?" [...] by the New Musical Express, Mercury replied, [...] "You're a crafty cow. Let's put it this way: there were <b>times</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> young and green. It's a thing schoolboys go through. I've had my share of schoolboy pranks. I'm not going to elaborate further." [...] Homosexual acts between adult males {{over the age of}} 21 had been decriminalised in the United Kingdom in 1967, only seven years earlier. In the 1980s, he would often distance himself from his partner, Jim Hutton, during public events. In October 1986, The Sun claimed Mercury had [...] "confessed to a string of one-night gay sex affairs".|$|E
500|$|In a 1988 {{interview}} with Barbara Walters, Fonda expressed regret {{for some of}} her comments and actions, stating:I {{would like to say}} something, not just to Vietnam veterans in New England, but to men who were in Vietnam, who I hurt, or whose pain I caused to deepen because of things that I said or did. I was trying to help end the killing and the war, but there were <b>times</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> thoughtless and careless about it and I'm very sorry that I hurt them. And I want to apologize to them and their families. [...] I will go to my grave regretting the photograph of me in an anti-aircraft gun, which looks like I was trying to shoot at American planes. It hurt so many soldiers. It galvanized such hostility. It was the most horrible thing I could possibly have done. It was just thoughtless.|$|E
500|$|At times Kiedis {{has also}} resented singing the song, {{especially}} during instances {{when he felt}} distanced from the song's lyrics. In the past few years, however, Kiedis has experienced a revival in interest: [...] "Although there have been <b>times</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> over , I've rediscovered it and now I feel close to it and it still has power, and life, and purpose as a song." [...] Frusciante believed that the flexibility of [...] "Under the Bridge" [...] has contributed to its success: [...] "A {{lot of the time}} {{that is one of the}} ingredients of a hit; you can hear it over and over and it will still always mean new things, but you do go through cycles." [...] Flea believes that the reason [...] "Under the Bridge" [...] had a recent revival in relevancy was due to Frusciante's return to the band from 1998 to 2009 after quitting in 1992. Flea believed that it was vital to have the four members who wrote the track together.|$|E

500|$|Other {{times on}} the set were not as smooth. The shoot was an arduous {{experience}} that [...] "cemented Cameron's formidable reputation as 'the scariest man in Hollywood'. He became known as an uncompromising, hard-charging perfectionist" [...] and a [...] "300-decibel screamer, a modern-day Captain Bligh with a megaphone and walkie-talkie, swooping down into people's faces on a 162ft crane". Winslet chipped a bone in her elbow during filming and had been worried that she would drown in the 17m-gallon water tank the ship was to be sunk in. [...] "There were <b>times</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> genuinely frightened of him. Jim has a temper like you wouldn't believe," [...] she said. [...] "'God damn it!' he would yell at some poor crew member, 'that's exactly what I didn't want!'" [...] Her co-star, Bill Paxton, was familiar with Cameron's work ethic from his earlier experience with him. [...] "There {{were a lot of}} people on the set. Jim is not one of those guys who has the time to win hearts and minds," [...] he said. The crew felt Cameron had an evil alter ego and so nicknamed him [...] "Mij" [...] (Jim spelt backwards). In response to the criticism, Cameron stated, [...] "Film-making is war. A great battle between business and aesthetics." ...|$|E
2500|$|Jun Kusanagi {{was born}} in Tokyo on June 5, 1978. When asked to what she {{attributed}} her figure, Kusanagi commented, [...] "I go to fitness club, facial cares, and I do exercise at my home too… I did sit-ups a lot of <b>times.</b> <b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> high school, I could do 200." ...|$|E
2500|$|Hanks {{followed}} Philadelphia {{with the}} 1994 hit Forrest Gump which grossed a worldwide total of over $600 {{million at the}} box office. Hanks remarked: [...] "When I read the script for Gump, I saw {{it as one of}} those kind of grand, hopeful movies that the audience can go to and feel... some hope for their lot and their position in life... I got that from the movies a hundred million <b>times</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> a kid. I still do." [...] Hanks won his second Best Actor Academy Award for his role in Forrest Gump, becoming only the second actor to have accomplished the feat of winning consecutive Best Actor Oscars. (Spencer Tracy was the first, winning in 1937–38. Hanks and Tracy were the same age at the time they received their Academy Awards: 37 for the first and 38 for the second.) ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Well," [...] she said, quietly, [...] "it {{was a great}} responsibility, {{and there}} were <b>times</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> horribly afraid. Still, events have proved me right, and I {{think it is the}} {{greatest}} compliment I could pay you when I say that it was to make Carrie safe I did it." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "I hope not, father," [...] she sighed, {{a little}} wistfully. [...] "There <b>are</b> <b>times</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> very {{dissatisfied}} with myself, and to-night, <b>I</b> <b>am</b> afraid, {{is one of}} them." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "By George!" [...] said he, [...] "this {{seems like}} good old <b>times.</b> <b>When</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> young {{and there was}} women on board, they all got a little sea-sick; but nowadays, with these ball-and-socket ships, you never hear {{of that sort of}} thing. A sea-sick woman is the most natural thing I have struck yet on this cruise." ...|$|E
60|$|I {{hope you}} will meet with {{complete}} success, and I am sorry I cannot be there to witness it and help you rejoice.

"Four Eyes used to {{call him}} the Frozen Pirate--whatever that means--the Tyrant of the Frost, the Cave Bear, the Beast Primitive, the King of the Caribou, the Bearded Pard, and lots of such things. Four Eyes loved words like these. He taught me most of my English. He was always making fun. You could never tell. He called me his cheetah-chum after <b>times</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> angry. What is cheetah? He always teased me with it." ...|$|E
60|$|It {{was fine}} summer weather again, and, as I walked along, the <b>times</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> a little {{helpless}} creature, {{and my sister}} did not spare me, vividly returned. But they returned with a gentle tone upon them that softened even the edge of Tickler. For now, the very breath of the beans and clover whispered to my heart that the day must come {{when it would be}} well for my memory that others walking in the sunshine should be softened as they thought of me.|$|E
6000|$|... "I am not {{prepared}} to admit that," [...] he replied. [...] "You had a very considerable social position at the <b>time</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> in office. It was {{up to you to}} make that good." ...|$|R
