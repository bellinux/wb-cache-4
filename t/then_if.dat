40|$|In {{this paper}} we study {{the case of}} {{monotonic}} rule-based systems which use a forward chaining algorithm to make deductions and a query algorithm to compute queries {{to be asked to}} the user in order to be closer to the expected goal (as Guru [?], IS [?] or Nexpert [?]). Unfortunately in many systems the query algorithm is not consistent with the deduction algorithm. Queries asked by these systems are often useless. We show that computing a query for those systems is equivalent to making abductive reasoning in three-valued logic and we propose a formalization of useful queries for expert systems. We give two definitions of intelligent queries and two levels to compute them: The logical level which aims at computing a list of intelligent queries, and the heuristic level which aims at choosing which query of that list it will ask the user. These are three examples: <b>If</b> b <b>then</b> a <b>If</b> b <b>then</b> a <b>If</b> b and c <b>then</b> a <b>If</b> c <b>then</b> b <b>If</b> c <b>then</b> a <b>If</b> d <b>then</b> a <b>If</b> d <b>then</b> b <b>If</b> d <b>then</b> b <b>If</b> e <b>then</b> b [...] ...|$|R

Therefore Black generally tries to hinder the c4–c5 push with moves like d7–d6, b7–b6 or Rf8–d8 (if this creates a hidden vis-à-vis between the Rd8 and the Qd2).|$|E
5|$|Now, {{the next}} player {{to the right}} plays a card {{following}} the same rules as the second player: if possible, a card of the same suit as the first player's card must be played, higher than the first two cards if possible; or {{if this is not}} possible, then lower; if no card of the same suit is held, <b>then</b> <b>if</b> possible, a trump card must be played; if no trump card is held, then any card may be played.

5|$|The WHO {{guidelines}} recommend prompt {{oral administration}} of drugs when pain occurs, starting, {{if the person}} is not in severe pain, with non-opioid drugs such as paracetamol, dipyrone, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs or COX-2 inhibitors. <b>Then,</b> <b>if</b> complete pain relief is not achieved or disease progression necessitates more aggressive treatment, mild opioids such as codeine, dextropropoxyphene, dihydrocodeine or tramadol are added to the existing non-opioid regime. If this is or becomes insufficient, mild opioids are replaced by stronger opioids such as morphine, while continuing the non-opioid therapy, escalating opioid dose until the person is painless or the maximum possible relief without intolerable side effects has been achieved. If the initial presentation is severe cancer pain, this stepping process should be skipped and a strong opioid should be started immediately in combination with a non-opioid analgesic.|$|E

5|$|The new {{brigadier general}} {{was placed in}} command of the Albany post, serving under Major General Jeffery Amherst. In 1759, shortly after {{capturing}} Ticonderoga without a fight, General Amherst learned of the death of General John Prideaux whose expedition had captured Fort Niagara. Amherst then ordered Gage to take Prideaux's place, and to take Fort de La Présentation (also known as Fort La Galette) {{at the mouth of the}} Oswegatchie River on Lake Ontario. When Amherst learned that the French had also abandoned Fort St. Frédéric, he sent a messenger after Gage with more explicit instructions to capture La Galette and <b>then,</b> <b>if</b> at all possible, to advance on Montreal.|$|E

5|$|Independent twin sets or {{independent}} doubles {{consists of two}} independent cylinders and two regulators, each with a submersible pressure gauge. This system is heavier, more expensive to buy and maintain and more expensive to fill than a single cylinder set. The diver must swap demand valves during the dive to preserve a sufficient reserve of gas in each cylinder. If this is not done, <b>then</b> <b>if</b> a cylinder should fail the diver may end up having an inadequate reserve. Independent twin sets do not work well with air-integrated computers as they usually only monitor one cylinder. The complexity of switching regulators periodically to ensure both cylinders are evenly used may be offset by the redundancy of two entirely separate breathing gas supplies. The cylinders may be mounted as a twin set on the diver's back, or alternatively can be carried in a sidemount configuration where penetration of wrecks or caves requires it, and where the cylinder valves are in easy reach.|$|E
5|$|Where {{the late}} army {{appears to have}} evolved to some extent is in battle tactics. The older army of the Principate had relied on a barrage of heavy {{javelins}} (pila) followed by an infantry charge, which was often sufficient to shatter, or at least disorganise, the barbarian line. After that, legionaries were trained to engage in aggressive hand-to-hand combat, using the gladius short-sword to execute quick thrusts at the abdomen of their enemies, {{in a similar manner}} to more recent bayonet drill. In close combat, the Romans had the crucial advantage of superior armour, and such tactics very often resulted in the rout of the less well-equipped and trained barbarian foe. The mounted archers and slingers in front of the main infantry line would loose their missiles on the enemy before the infantry lines engaged and would then hastily retreat to the rear of their own infantry line, whence, in conjunction with the foot archers already there, they would loose a continuous rain of missiles on the enemy foot by shooting over the heads of their own infantry. The cavalry's task on each wing was to scatter the enemy cavalry facing them and <b>then,</b> <b>if</b> possible, to encircle the main body of enemy infantry and attack them from the flanks and rear.|$|E
5|$|Vertical jumps (high {{jump and}} pole vault) set a bar at a {{particular}} height. The competitor must clear the bar without knocking it off the standards that are holding the bar (flat). Three failures in a row ends the competitor's participation in the event. The competitor has the option to PASS their attempt, {{which can be used}} to strategic advantage (of course that advantage is lost if the competitor misses). A pass could be used to save energy and avoid taking a jump that would not improve their position in the standings. After all competitors have either cleared, passed or failed their attempts at a height, the bar goes up. The amount the bar goes up is predetermined before the competition, though when one competitor remains, that competitor may choose their own heights for the remaining attempts. A record is kept of each attempt by each competitor. After all competitors have taken their attempts, the one jumping the highest is the winner, and so on down the other competitors in the event. Ties are broken by first, the number of attempts taken at the highest height (fewest wins), and <b>then</b> <b>if</b> still tied, {{by the total number of}} misses in the competition as a whole. The bar does not go back to a lower height except to break a tie for first place or a qualifying position. If those critical positions are still tied after applying the tiebreakers, all tied competitors take a fourth jump at the last height. If they still miss, the bar goes down one increment where they again jump. This process continues until the tie is broken.|$|E
