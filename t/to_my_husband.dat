500|$|Gaven {{resided in}} Los Angeles from 1991 to 1993, {{when she had}} to move to New York City to act in The Who's Tommy. However, her stay in the city was short because of the {{allergic}} reaction and she moved back to Los Angeles. While performing in musicals, Gaven had to be protective of her vocal cords and this affected her personal life. She told Miller in 1997 that [...] "you have to give up so much of your life", and gave the example that when [...] "somebody coughs behind me [...] I immediately say <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>husband,</b> 'We may have to move.'" [...] She also had to avoid shouting. Gaven is currently married to Seth Gaven who owns AV Squad, a film marketing company.|$|E
500|$|Winehouse was {{released}} from the London Clinic 24 hours after returning from a temporary leave to perform at Nelson Mandela's 90th birthday and at a concert in Glastonbury, and continued receiving treatment as an outpatient. In July 2008, Winehouse stated that she had been diagnosed with [...] "some areas of emphysema" [...] and said she was getting herself together by [...] "eating loads of healthy food, sleeping loads, playing my guitar, making music and writing letters <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>husband</b> every day." [...] She also kept a vertical tanning bed in her flat. Winehouse began precautionary testing on her lungs and chest on 25 October 2008 at the London Clinic for what was reported as a chest infection. Winehouse {{was in and out of}} the facility and was granted permission to set her own schedule regarding home leave. She returned to the hospital on 23 November 2008 for a reported reaction to her medication.|$|E
500|$|She {{disagreed}} with Fox News' Chris Wallace in 2006 when Wallace {{asked why the}} American people were beginning to lose confidence in President Bush, saying, [...] "Well, I don't think they are. And I don't really believe those polls. I travel around the country, I see people, I see their response <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>husband,</b> I see their response to me. There {{are a lot of}} difficult challenges right now in the United States... All of those decisions that the President has to make surrounding each one of these very difficult challenges are hard. They're hard decisions to make. And of course some people are unhappy about what some of those decisions are. But I think people know that he is doing what he thinks is right for the United States, that he's doing what he – especially in the war on terror, what he thinks he is obligated to do for the people in the United States, and that is to protect them... When his polls were really high they weren't on the front page." ...|$|E

No grief of mine shall {{interfere}} with <b>my</b> duty <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>husband's</b> partner. I will speak to the young man myself. Bring him here this evening, after business-hours. And don't leave us just yet; I want to put a question to you relating <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>husband's</b> affairs, in which I am deeply interested." [...] Mr. Hartrey returned to his chair. After a momentary hesitation, my aunt put her question in terms which took us all three by surprise.|$|R
500|$|There is {{controversy}} over authorship of Frankenstein, as both Shelley {{and her husband}} collaborated on the story. The extent to which Percy Shelley contributed to the novel is unknown. Since Frankenstein was published anonymously in 1818, readers and critics argued over its origins and {{the contributions of the}} two Shelleys to the book. [...] There are differences in the 1818, 1823, and 1831 editions, and Mary Shelley wrote, [...] "I certainly did not owe the suggestion of one incident, nor scarcely of one train of feeling, <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>husband,</b> and yet but for his incitement, it would never have taken the form in which it was presented to the world." [...] She wrote that the preface to the first edition was Percy's work [...] "as far as I can recollect." [...] James Rieger concluded Percy's [...] "assistance at every point in the book's manufacture was so extensive that one hardly knows whether to regard him as editor or minor collaborator", while Anne K. Mellor later argued Percy only [...] "made many technical corrections and several times clarified the narrative and thematic continuity of the text." [...] Charles E. Robinson, editor of a facsimile edition of the Frankenstein manuscripts, concluded that Percy's contributions to the book [...] "were no more than what most publishers' editors have provided new (or old) authors or, in fact, what colleagues have provided to each other after reading each other's works in progress." ...|$|E

2500|$|On 1 November, Nanavati {{returned}} home {{from one of his}} assignments and finding Sylvia aloof and distant, he questioned her. Sylvia, who now doubted Prem's intention to marry her, confessed about the affair to her husband. Nanavati dropped his family at the Metro Cinema, for a show he had promised to take them to, but excused himself and headed straight to confront Prem Ahuja. When Sylvia was asked in court, why she went to the theatre, leaving her agitated husband behind, she answered, [...] "I was upset myself and I did not think clearly then. I was not indifferent <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>husband</b> killing himself… It is difficult to explain these things to children, so I took them to the cinema.|$|E

2500|$|... "The motifs I {{was able}} to select from this milieu (the workers' lives) offered me, in a simple and forthright way, what I {{discovered}} to be beautiful.... People from the bourgeois sphere were altogether without appeal or interest. All middle-class life seemed pedantic to me. On the other hand, I felt the proletariat had guts. It was not until much later...when I {{got to know the}} women who would come <b>to</b> <b>my</b> <b>husband</b> for help, and incidentally also to me, that I was powerfully moved by the fate of the proletariat and everything connected with its way of life.... But what I would like to emphasize once more is that compassion and commiseration were at first of very little importance in attracting me to the representation of proletarian life; what mattered was simply that I found it beautiful." ...|$|E
