Such a shell would not suffer from <b>the</b> <b>drawbacks</b> of massive compressive pressure, nor are the mass requirements of such a shell {{as high as the}} rigid form. Such a shell would, however, have the same optical and thermal properties as the rigid form, and would be detected by searchers in a similar fashion (see below).|$|E
5|$|The Headphone Masterpiece is {{the debut}} album by American {{recording}} artist Cody Chesnutt. He recorded the album {{in his home}} bedroom with a 4-track recorder and played guitar, bass, keyboard, and an organ. A 36-song double album, The Headphone Masterpiece features neo soul and lo-fi music, and distorted, overdubbed production. It was written and arranged by Chesnutt, whose ironic and sincere lyrics reflect on personal experiences such as {{falling in love with}} his wife and reconciling his love for rock and roll with <b>the</b> <b>drawbacks</b> of the rock lifestyle.|$|E
5|$|The {{second and}} more {{important}} friendship was with Fanny (Frances) Blood, introduced to Wollstonecraft by the Clares, a couple in Hoxton who became parental figures to her; Wollstonecraft credited Blood with opening her mind. Unhappy with her home life, Wollstonecraft struck {{out on her own}} in 1778 and accepted a job as a lady's companion to Sarah Dawson, a widow living in Bath. However, Wollstonecraft had trouble getting along with the irascible woman (an experience she drew on when describing <b>the</b> <b>drawbacks</b> of such a position in Thoughts on the Education of Daughters, 1787). In 1780 she returned home, called back to care for her dying mother. Rather than return to Dawson's employ after the death of her mother, Wollstonecraft moved in with the Bloods. She realized during the two years she spent with the family that she had idealized Blood, who was more invested in traditional feminine values than was Wollstonecraft. But Wollstonecraft remained dedicated to her and her family throughout her life (she frequently gave pecuniary assistance to Blood's brother, for example).|$|E

5|$|To {{minimize}} <b>the</b> <b>drawbacks</b> of the inclined belt, it sloped {{outward from}} the keel, then back in towards the armored deck. This meant that shells fired at relatively close range would hit the upper portion of the belt at an angle, which maximized armor protection. However, {{the effectiveness of the}} upper portion of the belt was degraded at longer ranges, because plunging shells would strike it at an angle closer to the perpendicular, increasing their ability to penetrate the armor. It did reduce the area that needed to be covered by the armored deck, which saved additional weight. This enabled the upper belt to be thicker, which to an extent ameliorated the vulnerability to plunging fire. Because the belt was internal, it provided the opportunity to extend it to the inner portion of the double bottom, which gave the ship better underwater protection than the North Carolinas. Ultimately, the complex double incline belt armor was abandoned when it became apparent that a single slanted belt could provide similar protection, and save several hundred tons of weight.|$|E

25|$|Among <b>the</b> <b>drawbacks</b> of the {{technique}} are {{the limited number of}} gamma ray sources and the requirement that samples be solid in order to eliminate the recoil of the nucleus.

25|$|One of <b>the</b> <b>drawbacks</b> {{of crystal}} sets {{is that they}} are {{vulnerable}} to interference from stations near in frequency to the desired station; that is to say, they have low selectivity. Often two or more stations are heard simultaneously. This is because the simple tuned circuit does not reject nearby signals well; it allows a wide band of frequencies to pass through, that is, it has a large bandwidth (low Q factor) compared to modern receivers.|$|E

25|$|Trivers {{argues that}} {{friendship}} and various social emotions evolved {{in order to}} manage reciprocity. Liking and disliking, he says, evolved to help present day humans' ancestors form coalitions with others who reciprocated and to exclude {{those who did not}} reciprocate. Moral indignation may have evolved to prevent one's altruism from being exploited by cheaters, and gratitude may have motivated present day humans' ancestors to reciprocate appropriately after benefiting from others' altruism. Likewise, present day humans feel guilty when they fail to reciprocate. These social motivations match what evolutionary psychologists expect to see in adaptations that evolved to maximize the benefits and minimize <b>the</b> <b>drawbacks</b> of reciprocity.|$|E

25|$|The Sidewinder is {{an attempt}} to {{overcome}} <b>the</b> <b>drawbacks</b> of the stacked design. It does this by reorienting the coils so that while electrically cancelling they are on opposite poles of a magnet. Thus, unlike stacked coils, output is hotter since the net effect is to add rather than subtract the signal between the coils; thus, the impedance can be lower, avoiding overwinding to obtain sufficient output. There is less signal cancellation. Sonically these sit somewhere between a true P-90 and a stacked pickup. They don't chime but they aren't nasal or lifeless either. They are ideal candidates for overdriven sounds where loss of sparkle is less important than avoiding hum amplification. These type of pickups have the same appearance of P-90s.|$|E
25|$|There is {{emerging}} evidence {{from studies of}} cord bloods that both sensitization and the acquisition of tolerance can begin in pregnancy, however the window of main danger for sensitization to foods extends prenatally, remaining most critical during early infancy when {{the immune system and}} intestinal tract are still maturing. There is no conclusive evidence to support the restriction of dairy intake in the maternal diet during pregnancy in order to prevent. This is generally not recommended since <b>the</b> <b>drawbacks</b> in terms of loss of nutrition can out-weigh the benefits. However, further randomised, controlled trials are required to examine if dietary exclusion by lactating mothers can truly minimize risk to a significant degree and if any reduction in risk is out-weighed by deleterious impacts on maternal nutrition.|$|E
25|$|While {{this reform}} was {{eventually}} accomplished, other challenges must be surmounted.
