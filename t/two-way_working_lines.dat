50|$|As {{the second}} {{illustration}} shows, a low pressure ratio fan (such as that {{used on a}} high bypass ratio turbofan) has a range of <b>working</b> <b>lines.</b> At high flight speeds, the ram pressure ratio factors up the cold nozzle pressure ratio, causing the nozzle to choke. Above the choking condition, the <b>working</b> <b>lines</b> tend to coalesce into a unique steep straight line. When the nozzle unchokes, the <b>working</b> <b>line</b> starts to become more curved, reflecting the curvature of the nozzle characteristic. With falling flight Mach number, the cold nozzle pressure ratio decreases. Initially this has no effect upon {{the position of the}} <b>working</b> <b>line,</b> apart from the curved (unchoked) tail, which becomes longer. Eventually, the cold nozzle will become unchoked at lower flight Mach numbers, even at full throttle. The <b>working</b> <b>lines</b> will now become curved, gradually migrating towards surge as flight Mach number decreases. The lowest surge margin <b>working</b> <b>line</b> occurs at static conditions.|$|R
50|$|Because a {{high-pressure}} compressor 'sees' the {{choked flow}} {{capacity of the}} high-pressure turbine, the compressor <b>working</b> <b>line</b> is hardly affected by flight conditions. The slope of the <b>working</b> <b>line</b> approximates to a constant corrected outlet flow.|$|R
5000|$|The Netherton tunnel {{was built}} with a width of 27 ft to allow <b>two-way</b> <b>working</b> of narrowboats; and is brick lined throughout. It has towpaths running through it, {{one on each}} side, which enabled horse-drawn narrowboats to be pulled through it. Chainage (distance) markers are still visible on the Eastern wall. The tunnel was fitted, from the start, with gas {{lighting}} over the towpaths, though this was later converted to electricity {{and it is now}} unlit.|$|R
50|$|Being a high {{pressure}} ratio device, the <b>working</b> <b>line</b> is relatively shallow. If the unit had no variable geometry, {{there would be}} handling problems, because the surge line would be very steep and cross the <b>working</b> <b>line</b> at part-flow.|$|R

In the industrial applications for tundish <b>working</b> <b>lining</b> a wet slurry mix is mostly used. The slag chemistry and strong impact metal stream are resulting in considerable wear of the originally well function in refractory <b>working</b> <b>lining.</b> This work focuses on the phases formed during slag infiltration which accelerates refractory wear rates in the slag zone of tundish <b>working</b> <b>lining</b> and causes corrosion of the magnesia.

50|$|However, ultra-high {{bypass ratio}} turbofans {{have a very}} low design fan {{pressure}} ratio (e.g. 1.2, on the bypass section). Consequently, even at cruise flight speeds, the cold (or mixed final) propelling nozzle is unchoked. The fan <b>working</b> <b>lines</b> become more spread-out with flight Mach number, because they move bodily up the map, towards the top right hand corner. As a result, the static <b>working</b> <b>line</b> can be well into surge.|$|R
50|$|During a Slam Deceleration, the {{opposite}} trend is observed; the transient compressor <b>working</b> <b>line</b> goes below the steady state line.|$|R
5000|$|In the mid-1960s, {{the main}} streets of Shoreditch (Old Street, Shoreditch High Street and Curtain Road, Great Eastern Street) were formed into a mile-long one-way system, which became {{associated}} with traffic congestion, poor conditions for walking and cycling, high speeds, high collision rates, and delays for bus services. The gyratory system {{came to be}} seen as [...] "the main factor holding back the cultural regeneration of South Shoreditch" [...] and [...] "a block to economic recovery". Following a lengthy campaign, the then newly formed Transport for London agreed to revert most of the streets to <b>two-way</b> <b>working,</b> a project which was completed in late 2002.|$|R
50|$|Owing to {{the nature}} of the {{constraints}} involved, the fan <b>working</b> <b>lines</b> of a mixed turbofan are somewhat steeper than those of the equivalent unmixed engine.|$|R
50|$|From 7 January 2005 until 17 September 2006, {{the loop}} via Heathrow Terminal 4 {{was closed to}} allow the {{connection}} of a spur line to the now operational Heathrow Terminal 5 station. All underground services reverted to <b>two-way</b> <b>working</b> into Terminals 2 & 3, which again became the temporary terminus; shuttle buses served Terminal 4 from the Hatton Cross bus station. For a brief period in summer 2006, the line terminated at Hatton Cross and shuttle buses also ran to Terminals 2 & 3 while the track configuration and tunnels were altered for the Terminal 5 link from that station. The station at Terminal 5 opened on 27 March 2008 {{on the same day}} Terminal 5 opened.|$|R
50|$|One {{solution}} {{is to have a}} variable area cold (or mixed) nozzle. Increasing the nozzle area at low flight speeds brings the fan <b>working</b> <b>line</b> away from surge.|$|R
50|$|At {{the other}} extreme, some high bypass ratio civil turbofans control the fan <b>working</b> <b>line</b> {{by using a}} convergent-divergent nozzle with an {{extremely}} low (less than 1.01) area ratio on the bypass (or mixed exhaust) stream. At low airspeeds, such a setup causes the nozzle {{to act as if}} it had variable geometry by preventing it from choking and allowing it to accelerate and decelerate exhaust gas approaching the throat and divergent section, respectively. Consequently, the nozzle exit area controls the fan match, which, being larger than the throat, pulls the fan <b>working</b> <b>line</b> slightly away from surge. At higher flight speeds, the ram rise in the intake chokes the throat and causes the nozzle's area to dictate the fan match; the nozzle, being smaller than the exit, causes the throat to push the fan <b>working</b> <b>line</b> slightly toward surge. This is not a problem, however, for a fan's surge margin is much greater at high flight speeds.|$|R
5000|$|Some high-bypass-ratio civil turbofans use an {{extremely}} low area ratio (less than 1.01), convergent-divergent, nozzle on the bypass (or mixed exhaust) stream, {{to control the}} fan <b>working</b> <b>line.</b> The nozzle acts {{as if it has}} variable geometry. At low flight speeds the nozzle is unchoked (less than a Mach number of unity), so the exhaust gas speeds up as it approaches the throat and then slows down slightly as it reaches the divergent section. Consequently, the nozzle exit area controls the fan match and, being larger than the throat, pulls the fan <b>working</b> <b>line</b> slightly away from surge. At higher flight speeds, the ram rise in the intake increases nozzle pressure ratio {{to the point where the}} throat becomes choked (M=1.0). Under these circumstances, the throat area dictates the fan match and, being smaller than the exit, pushes the fan <b>working</b> <b>line</b> slightly towards surge. This is not a problem, since fan surge margin is much better at high flight speeds.|$|R
50|$|On 6 January 1969 the Waverley Route {{closed to}} through traffic, {{together}} with the connecting spur from Port Carlisle Branch Junction to Canal Junction, and the line to the reversing siding at Stainton Junction for trains from Kingmoor Yard; the last named was only six years old. The portion of the Waverley route as far as Longtown was retained until 31 August 1970, when the line was shortened to serve only RAF Brunthill, {{just north of the}} bridge where the Waverley Route had crossing the Caledonian, main line. The line between Mossband Junction and Bush-on-Esk, on the old Longtown to Gretna line, was retained for the time being to serve an ordnance depot, reverting to <b>two-way</b> <b>working</b> for the purpose.|$|R

40|$|The {{space charge}} induced Q-shifts were {{measured}} either {{by comparing the}} radial positions of a given non-linear resonance with and without a stack, or by means of RF deflecting fields. The first consequence of these Q-shifts is a displacement of the <b>working</b> <b>line</b> in the stability diagram towards low order non-linear res-onances. A secondary effect is a progressive reduction of the radial derivatives of the Q's {{at the edges of}} the stack with increasing intensity, which makes the stack unstable in these regions. These results were used to derive "prestressed " <b>working</b> <b>lines</b> which are suited to high intensity stacks...|$|R
5000|$|The IP {{compressor}} outlet corrected flow must match the entry corrected {{flow of the}} HP compressor, which is decreasing as the engine is throttled back. At a certain IP compressor <b>working</b> <b>line</b> slope, the IP {{compressor outlet}} corrected flow remains constant. However, by adopting a shallower <b>working</b> <b>line,</b> the extra IP compressor pressure ratio at a given IP compressor entry corrected flow enables the IP compressor outlet corrected flow to decrease and match up with the falling HP compressor entry corrected flow. Unfortunately {{this can lead to}} a poor IP compressor surge margin at part flow.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{describes}} an {{experimental study of}} four different absorber designs {{in this type of}} system: cross-current and counter-current packed-bed absorbers, the spray absorber and fluid-bed absorber. In a laboratory pilot, plant, <b>working</b> <b>lines</b> for the absorbers were determined under adiabatic conditions. The influences of internal solution flow, gas flow, pressure drop and dissipation are discussed. The <b>working</b> <b>lines</b> represent the efficiency for each absorber. The highest performance occurs with the packed-bed absorbers, followed by the fluid-bed absorber and finally the spray absorber. For open absorption systems in air-conditioning applications (small scale), the cross-current absorber is preferable, and for industrial utilization (large scale) the fluid-bed absorber should be chosen. ...|$|R
50|$|The LESt {{opened their}} second {{southern}} depot (after Kleinzschocher) on 10 November 1912. After the merger with the GLSt in 1929, this depot {{was used for}} painting of rolling stock and running repairs. Because of the August 1957 obstruction which cut off access to the usual depot, Connewitz II depot was used again by cars <b>working</b> <b>Lines</b> 10, 11 and 22. The last use of the tramcar shed was in 1960/61 by cars <b>working</b> <b>Line</b> 26. The entire facility was closed in 1963. The last remnants of the depot, the Wendeschleife Hildebrandstraße, which extended across part of the depot area, was disconnected from the network on 21 January 1993.|$|R

50|$|An {{alternative}} {{solution is to}} fit a variable pitch fan. Scheduling the pitch of the fan blades has no impact upon {{the position of the}} fan <b>working</b> <b>lines,</b> but can be used to move the surge line upwards, to improve fan surge margin.|$|R
40|$|Most of {{the current}} {{industrial}} gas turbine systems are designed to operate with conventional fossil fuels. Recently, the use of Low Calorific Value (LCV) fuels gained interest, particularly, Hydrogen rich Syngas resulting from coal and solid waste gasification. When LCV fuels are used the performance and behavior of the engines could significantly change and modifications may be needed. For instance, due to the relatively low heating value the {{fuel mass flow rate}} will be much higher than natural gas, increasing substantially the mass flow through the turbine. This leads to a decrease of demand for air from the compressor, which results in increased back pressure, reduction of stall margin and possible compressor instability. This paper presents a preliminary study to pave the way to the design of a 300 MW industrial gas turbine?s compressor with the objective of operating efficiently with Hydrogen rich syngas, while maintaining the flexibility for a quick switch to natural gas in the event of gasifier failure or breakdown of feedstock supply. NASA Rotor 37 is used as the test vehicle to provide design concepts because of its simplicity in being a single stage compressor and the availability of experimental data for the CFD model validation. Geometric modifications were performed on the rotor to shift the <b>working</b> <b>line</b> towards an estimated lower air mass flow rate <b>working</b> <b>line.</b> Further modifications were investigated {{in order to maintain the}} design point compressor efficiency primarily based on sweep and lean of the blade. Once the new <b>working</b> <b>line</b> geometry was obtained, inlet variable guide vane (IGV) effects were explored to allow the compressor to shift to the original <b>working</b> <b>line</b> without further changes to the blade shape...|$|R
50|$|Surge margin can be {{improved}} by adding variable stators to the IP compressor and/or adding a blow-off valve between the IP and HP compressors. The former makes the IP compressor surge line shallower, swinging {{it away from the}} shallow <b>working</b> <b>line,</b> thus improving IP compressor surge margin.|$|R
5000|$|An {{additional}} [...] "overnight accommodation depot" [...] {{was opened}} by the LESt on 15 May 1898 at the Holzhäuser Straße tram terminal. A second tramcar shed {{was built by}} 1908. By 1917, vehicles <b>working</b> <b>Line</b> 6 were relocated to Probstheida Depot, and Stötteritz was no longer used as an operating base. The GLSt reopened this depot between 1924 and 1926, but only as branch of Reudnitz Depot. Thereafter, the company used this facility for storage of disused rolling stock. Approach tracks were rebuilt in 1929 and the connecting tracks changed to face away from the town center (landwärtiger). From December 1943 to the early 1950s, tramcars <b>working</b> <b>Lines</b> 6 and 7 as well as trailers used on Line 4 were serrviced here. The LVB closed Stötteritz Depot in 1957.|$|R
50|$|The FLP {{opened in}} 1912 {{and is the}} last <b>working</b> <b>line</b> of an {{interconnected}} network including two other suburban lines, the Lugano-Tesserete railway and the Lugano-Cadro-Dino railway, and the urban tramways of Lugano. There are proposals to extend the line back {{into some of the}} areas formerly covered by this network.|$|R
50|$|In {{addition}} to the eleven current <b>working</b> <b>lines,</b> the network is currently being expanded {{with the introduction of}} a double metro line which will be the longest in continental Europe: L9/L10. Nearly all existing lines are also growing, some extensively like L2, and as of 2014 they are undergoing reforms.|$|R
50|$|Working {{lines are}} {{difficult}} to see on a conventional turbine map because the speed lines bunch up.
