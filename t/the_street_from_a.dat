5|$|In the 1950s Salomon's three sons, Avraham, Ovadia and Danny, assumed {{managerial}} positions; {{they became}} co-CEOs after Salomon's death in 1966. In 1958 Angel's Bakery moved to its present {{location in the}} Givat Shaul industrial zone {{at the corner of}} Beit Hadfus and Farbstein Streets. The site was chosen because it stood across <b>the</b> <b>street</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> flour mill. The Angel brothers built Israel's first flour silo and commissioned a Texas company to construct a 750-foot pipeline to convey flour directly from the mill to the silo to the bakery. Today this pipeline brings 120 tons of flour to the bakery daily. The invention, initially opposed by the Jerusalem municipality for being above-ground, won the Kaplan Prize for distinction in productivity and efficiency.|$|E
5|$|The {{prosecution}} presented four {{witnesses to}} the court. Robert Chobert, a cab driver who testified he was parked behind Faulkner, identified Abu-Jamal as the shooter. Cynthia White, a prostitute, testified that Abu-Jamal emerged from a nearby parking lot and shot Faulkner. Michael Scanlan, a motorist, testified that from two car lengths away, he saw a man, matching Abu-Jamal's description, run across <b>the</b> <b>street</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> parking lot and shoot Faulkner. Albert Magilton, a pedestrian who {{did not see the}} shooting, testified to seeing Faulkner pull over Cook's car. As Abu-Jamal started to cross the street toward them, Magilton turned away and lost sight of what happened next.|$|E
5|$|The video {{begins with}} Swift, barefoot and {{clad in a}} white sundress, {{approaching}} a tall, arched doorway which materializes {{in the middle of}} a barren landscape. Swift looks at a photograph of herself and her friend tucked into the arch and, then, passes through the doors. On the other side of the arch, animated flowers and vines grow across the scenes. People and objects from a high school fade in and out of view. Swift walks through the memories and begins to play an acoustic guitar beneath a tree. Afterward, Anderson appears, sitting at a desk before a chalkboard in the field of flowers. Swift sits down beside her and two begin to whisper and laugh to each other. In the next scene, Swift plays a namesake Taylor brand guitar while Anderson goes on her first date; she kisses her date, but pushes him away when he tries to go further. Her love interest and all surroundings dissolve to show Anderson sitting alone on a stone bench. Swift approaches her and hugs her tightly as the field around them turns dark and stormy. The video then alternates between Swift singing in the rain and hugging her friend. After the landscape deteriorates, the video transitions to reality, where Swift, wearing a black trench coat, stands in the rain, across <b>the</b> <b>street</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> high school. Swift then sees a student at the entrance; the two make eye contact and the video concludes. To date, the video has over 108 million views on YouTube.|$|E

Argo borrowed its name from the story of Jason and the Argonauts in Greek mythology.

500|$|In 1971, vocalist David Johansen {{formed the}} New York Dolls with guitarists Johnny Thunders and Rick Rivets, bassist Arthur Kane, and drummer Billy Murcia; Rivets was {{replaced}} by Sylvain Sylvain in 1972. The band {{was meant to be}} a temporary project for the members, who were club-going youths that had gone to New York City with different career pursuits. As Sylvain recalled, [...] "We just said 'Hey, maybe this will get us some chicks.' That seemed like a good enough reason." [...] He and Murcia originally planned to work in the clothing business and opened a boutique on Lexington Avenue that was across <b>the</b> <b>street</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> toy repair shop called the New York Dolls Hospital, which gave them the idea for their name. The group soon began playing regularly in lower Manhattan and earned a cult following within a few months with their reckless style of rock music. Nonetheless, record companies were hesitant to sign them because of their onstage cross-dressing and blatant vulgarity. In October 1972, they garnered the interest of critics when they opened for English rock band the Faces at the Empire Pool in Wembley. However, on the New York Dolls' first tour of England that year, Murcia died after consuming a lethal combination of alcohol and methaqualone. They enlisted Jerry Nolan as his replacement, while managers Marty Thau, Steve Leber, and David Krebs still struggled to find the band a record deal.|$|E

500|$|The {{album that}} {{resulted}} is what many call the outlaw movement's first true record and Jennings' artistic zenith. [...] Almost {{all of the}} songs on Honky Tonk Heroes contain a defiant, restless longing for and celebration of the road ("Moving {{is the closest thing}} to being free...") and a rock and roll swagger that was entirely new in Nashville circles. [...] Although concept albums were not new in country music, with stars like Johnny Cash, Marty Robbins, and Porter Wagoner all having recorded LPs with unifying themes, Honky Tonk Heroes offered a more progressive take on the enterprise, resembling the albums Mickey Newbury had recently recorded and the blockbuster Red Headed Stranger album that Willie Nelson would release two years later. [...] In addition to Shaver's brooding compositions, Jennings rounded out the collection with the tender ballad [...] "We Had It All," [...] written by Kris Kristofferson keyboardist [...] "Funky" [...] Donnie Fritts. [...] According to Michael Striessguth's book Outlaw, RCA had asked Waylon to tack on one more song to augment the Shaver songs, in hopes of landing a hit single, and after considering Steve Young's [...] "Seven Bridges Road," [...] Jimmie Rodgers' [...] "T for Texas," [...] and Shel Silverstein's [...] "The Leaving Coming On," [...] Jennings opted for the Fritts tune, which would go on to be recorded and performed by Rod Stewart, Ray Charles, Bob Dylan, the Rolling Stones. [...] Released as a single, [...] "We Had it All", peaked at number 28 in Billboards Country Singles. [...] Jennings and Shaver also collaborated on the hit single [...] "You Asked Me To," [...] which spent fifteen weeks on the Billboard country singles charts, reaching a peak of number eight. [...] In the liner notes to The Essential Waylon Jennings, Wade Jessen quotes the singer: [...] "We wrote this one night in the dark over at Bobby Bare's office across <b>the</b> <b>street</b> <b>from</b> <b>a</b> Burger Boy where we'd been playing pinball. [...] Shaver said, 'I've got it started. [...] Let's finish it.' [...] We wrote it pretty well in the dark." [...] Shaver recorded his own version in 1977 for the album Gypsy Boy, with special guest Willie Nelson on guitar and vocals. [...] "You Asked Me To" [...] also appeared as the closing song on Elvis Presley's 1975 album Promised Land.|$|E
2500|$|That union {{grew out}} of a unique mixture of two revolutionary traditions: the Irish insurrectionary history of Connolly and the IRA and the Communist Party.
