We found that this issue can be addressed by transmitting the control input through a single mode Kerr-nonlinear cavity, with resonance frequency chosen such that the <b>transmission</b> <b>gain</b> |c'/c| is peaked close to c'=ξ_ 0. For input amplitudes larger than c, the <b>transmission</b> <b>gain</b> is lower (although |c'| still grows monotonically with |c|) which extends the input range over which the subsequent Fredkin gate stays in the on-state.|$|E

We show that the problem is convex with respect to the squared norm of the <b>transmission</b> <b>gains,</b> and that a closed-form solution can be found using the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker conditions. Our results indicate that a constant PD can be maintained with decreasing sensor transmit gain provided that the number of antennas increases at the same rate. This is contrasted with the case of a single-antenna FC, where PD is monotonically decreasing with transmit gain. On the other hand, we show that when the transmit power is high, the single- and multi-antenna FC both asymptotically achieve the same PD upper bound.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: Investigate the {{effectiveness}} and frequency dependence of central drive transmission via the alpha-motoneuron pool to the muscle. METHODS: We describe {{a model for}} the simulation of alpha-motoneuron firing and the EMG signal as response to central drive input. The transfer in the frequency domain is investigated. Coherence between stochastical central input and EMG is also evaluated. RESULTS: The transmission of central rhythmicities to the EMG signal relates to the spectral content of the latter. Coherence between central input to the alpha-motoneuron pool and the EMG signal is significant whereby the coupling strength hardly depends on the frequency in a range from 1 to 100 Hz. Common central input to pairs of alpha-motoneurons strongly increases the coherence levels. The often-used rectification of the EMG signal introduces a clear frequency dependence. CONCLUSIONS: Oscillatory phenomena are strongly transmitted via the alpha-motoneuron pool. The motoneuron firing frequencies do {{play a role in the}} <b>transmission</b> <b>gain,</b> but do not influence the coherence levels. Rectification of the EMG signal enhances the <b>transmission</b> <b>gain,</b> but lowers coherence and introduces a strong frequency dependency. We think that it should be avoided.

40|$|In this study, a new {{theoretical}} {{foundation for}} the Discrete-Time Feedback Error Learning (DTFEL) method is proposed. This method {{is analogous to the}} original Continuous-Time Feedback Error Learning (FEL) originally proposed as a control model of the cerebellum in the field of computational neuroscience. DTFEL is superior to FEL since it is applicable for digital controllers which are commonly used nowadays. Based on the strictly positive realness, the stability of DTFEL has been validated. However, from the viewpoint of adaptive control, this condition is restricted since some required assumptions cannot be satisfied in real systems, such as the direct input-output <b>transmission</b> <b>gain</b> is required to be large. Moreover, the stability of the system is guaranteed by selecting a sufficiently large positive constant feedback gain, which is a vague requirement from the viewpoint of control system design. This study proposes another scheme for the DTFEL method which does not require any positive real condition and overcomes the direct input-output <b>transmission</b> <b>gain</b> requirement. This can be achieved by utilizing the error signal more effectively.

30|$|As an overview, we {{can observe}} that the {{front-end}} {{properties of the}} transmitting nodes, along with the selected <b>transmission</b> <b>gain</b> levels, significantly affect the robustness of the system. Relative locations of nodes also generate observable performance differences. Another noteworthy observation {{is the impact of}} error propagation at the relay nodes. When source-relay links are subject to high error rates, (10), the network decoder generates a symbol error resulting on higher BER measurements. The highly robust transmission at the PXI module generates an error propagation effect. This effect at the relay nodes should definitely be taken into consideration when designing NCC systems for wireless links.|$|E

This paper proposes equal <b>gain</b> <b>transmission</b> (EGT) to provide diversity advantage in MIMO systems experiencing Rayleigh fading. The applications of equal <b>gain</b> <b>transmission</b> with selection diversity combining, equal gain combining, and maximum ratio combining are addressed. It is proven that systems using equal <b>gain</b> <b>transmission</b> with any of these combining schemes achieve full diversity order when transmitting over a memoryless, flat fading matrix channel with independent entries. Since in practice full channel knowledge at the transmitter is difficult to realize, a quantized version of EGT is proposed. An algorithm to construct a beamforming vector codebook that guarantees full diversity order is presented. Monte Carlo simulation comparisons with various beamforming and combining systems illustrate the performance as a function of quantization.
