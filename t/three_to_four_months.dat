40|$|The {{primary purpose}} of this study was to {{determine}} if a drug testing program could impact or change student drug use at the secondary education level. Secondary purposes were to 1) assess the perceptions of secondary education students toward licit and illicit drugs, drug use, and the newly implemented drug testing program, and 2) to examine why drug use may continue even after a drug testing program has been implemented. Data was collected through the use of questionnaires, discussion groups, and one-on-one interviews. Examination of the questionnaire data indicated that student drug use was not substantially deterred by the newly implemented drug testing program over a <b>three</b> <b>to</b> <b>four</b> <b>month</b> time period. Also, students' perceptions of the newly implemented drug testing program were mainly that of disagreement. Students commented that they felt the drug testing policy was implemented to "catch them" using drugs rather than "help them" with a possible drug addiction. One of the main reasons that the drug testing program did not have a great deterrent effect on student drug use, as suggested by the students, was that the odds were not high enough that they would be selected to be drug tested. In some instances, drug testing was not proving to be a deterrent to drug use, but rather a deterrent to participation in school activities.

In June and August 1992, six golden eagles, of which 5 adults (4 $ rm sp{o}$ + 1 sex unknown), were caught and fixed with transmitters in order to follow their movements over one year. The golden eagles fed on various animal species, i. e. 8 mammals, 15 birds and one fish, during the breeding season, however Canada geese (Branta canadensis) were the main item in their diet. Four of the adult eagles undertook their fall migration in October 1992. The other adult eagle died of an unknown cause while the fate of the nestling could not be determined. All the migratory birds moved south to the United States, but they used different migration routes. The four golden eagles reached their wintering grounds in November and December, 1992.

5|$|Female {{cockroaches}} {{are sometimes}} seen carrying egg cases {{on the end}} of their abdomens; the German cockroach holds about 30 to 40 long, thin eggs in a case called an ootheca. She drops the capsule prior to hatching, though live births do occur in rare instances. The egg capsule may take more than five hours to lay and is initially bright white in color. The eggs are hatched from the combined pressure of the hatchlings gulping air. The hatchlings are initially bright white nymphs and continue inflating themselves with air, becoming harder and darker within about four hours. Their transient white stage while hatching and later while molting has led to claims of albino cockroaches. Development from eggs to adults takes <b>three</b> <b>to</b> <b>four</b> <b>months.</b> Cockroaches live up to a year, and the female may produce up to eight egg cases in a lifetime; in favorable conditions, she can produce 300 to 400 offspring.

40|$|Graduation date: 2012 Rhododendron {{species are}} host to many Phytophthora species and are an {{important}} crop in the nursery industry. The foliar epidemiology of twelve Phytophthora diseases on Rhododendron was studied in field and growth chamber experiments on two Rhododendron cultivars. The relative aggressiveness of Phytophthora spp. was assessed using disease incidence, severity, and sporulation. Plant experiments were conducted on whole plants and on detached leaves. Growth rates of lesions and colonies for each species at different temperatures were determined in growth chambers on detached leaves and in agar culture. Whole plants were inoculated {{in the field in}} four experiments conducted at <b>three</b> <b>to</b> <b>four</b> <b>month</b> intervals. The twelve species studied appeared to fall into two groups with P. citrophthora, P. foliorum, P. kernoviae, P. parasitica, P. plurivora and P. ramorum being the most aggressive species; sporulating the most, developing the largest lesions or exhibiting the highest infection rate. P. cactorum, P. cambivora, P. cinnamomi, P. lateralis, P. nemorosa and P. syringae were less aggressive on foliage under most conditions, with the exception of P. syringae which developed the largest lesions at lower temperatures typical of spring time in temperate climates. It is apparent that different Phytophthora species are more active at different temperatures and thus surveys for Phytophthora infections should be concerned about different species at different times of the year. P. kernoviae is not known to be present in the US. P. kernoviae is of particular concern due to the high sporulation levels observed in detached leaf and whole plant inoculations. Rhododendron spp. appear to be likely candidate vectors for the introduction of novel Phytophthora pathogens.

40|$|Seasonal {{variation}} in forage availability and quality {{is understood to}} affect the annual timing of parturition in large herbivores. In India-where seasonal monsoonal rains define {{variation in}} forage availability and quality-chital Axis axis exhibit stronger seasonality in parturition than the larger gaur Bos gaurus. We hypothesized that this difference {{can be explained by}} forage requirements determined by body mass. We developed a model to simulate changes in leaf biomass and nitrogen content based on plant available moisture and nutrients, and calibrated our model with field data. Our results show that the minimum forage nitrogen content required by lactating gaur was available throughout the year, but that required by lactating chital was available for less than 40 % of the year, i. e. during the early wet season, which coincides with the annual peak period of chital births. The <b>three</b> <b>to</b> <b>four</b> <b>month</b> spread of chital births, which begins in the dry season, implies that the period of highest quality is also important for females to replenish maternal reserves for future reproduction and help maximize the growth rate of neonates. This spread also indicates low synchrony of chital births and suggests that predator swamping was less important in influencing their timing of parturition. As monsoonal rain exhibits annual temporal variation, we analyzed our model under different rainfall patterns while keeping the total annual rainfall constant. We found that the difference between the durations of how long forage quality is available to satisfy the minimum requirements of lactating gaur and lactating chital is similar for all simulated patterns. This insensitivity to variable rainfall patterns lends support to our hypothesis that forage requirements determined by body mass is one plausible explanation for the variation in parturition strategies among large herbivores species...|$|R

5|$|Their lofty {{locations}} makes {{monitoring of}} Australian raven nests difficult. A clutch can comprise {{up to six}} eggs, though usually four or five are laid, with five being the most common number. Measuring , eggs are pale green or bluish-green and splotched with darker olive, brown and blackish markings. Eggs are quite variable, and thus which Australian corvid laid them cannot be reliably identified. Incubation of the eggs is done solely by the female over roughly 20days. Incubation is intermittent initially, becoming constant {{by the time the}} third or fourth egg is laid. Only one brood is raised per year, though a second clutch may be laid if the first clutch is lost early in the season. Late clutches have poor survival rates, possibly due to chicks getting dehydrated on hot days as the year progresses or being eaten by wedge-tailed eagles. The chicks are altricial and nidicolous; that is, they are born helpless, naked and blind, and remain in the nest for an extended period. They have pink skin until 5days of age, when feathers under the skin turn it grey. They lose their egg tooth at the same time. Their eyes begin opening at 5 to 6 days of age and are fully open by 11 to 12 days, by which time their feathers begin emerging. At 14 days, their primary feathers begin emerging, and they are fully feathered by 35–36 days old.

40|$|The role of {{selection}} during speciation {{is a key}} component towards fully diverged species, yet the processes and time required for genomic divergence to evolve new species remains an active area of research in evolution. A population genomics approach provides a promising means to understanding evolutionary processes influencing genomic divergence. To determine the effects selection has on the genome, I used Sebastes as a model system due to its rapid adaptive radiation in the North Pacific Ocean. Species in Sebastes inhabit {{a wide range of}} environments providing a unique system to study a range of divergence from local adaptation between populations to incipient speciation. I identified genomic regions diverging due to local adaptation and candidate genomic regions involved in the incipient speciation of a lineage within the subgenus Sebastosomus. I developed 67 microsatellites from expressed sequence tagged (EST) libraries from three different Sebastes species to identify gene function responding to selection. I then implemented a low-density genome scan on a species pair (S. flavidus & S. melanops) and identified outlier loci with two outlier detection methods. The two species are distributed sympatrically but differ in pelagic larval duration (PLD). S. flavidus has a <b>three</b> <b>to</b> <b>four</b> <b>month</b> PLD had a higher number of identified candidate outlier loci while S. melanops which has a <b>four</b> <b>to</b> six <b>month</b> PLD had significantly fewer suggesting that gene flow may reduce local adaptation. I identified two outliers in S. flavidus associated with oceanic variables influencing genetic structure while none were found in S. melanops. Finally, I assembled a restriction site associated (RAD) library and sequenced using the Illumina Hiseq technology from two divergent S. mystinus morphotypes. I sampled 21, 318 single nucleotide polymorphic (SNP) loci across six populations from Oregon to San Francisco. Population structure analyses identified two morphotypes previously described as genetically distinct groups and highlighted a population maintaining signatures of hybridization. I identified 209 SNP loci diverging between morphotypes providing an initial set of genomic regions diverging due to speciation.

A classical example is birdsong, a learned behaviour ideally suited for studying the neural and molecular substrates of vocal learning. Young songbirds gradually transform primitive unstructured vocalizations (subsong, akin to human babbling) into complex, stereotyped sequences of syllables that constitute adult song. In comparison with birdsong, territorial and mating calls of vocal non-learner species are thought to exhibit little change during development.
