40|$|We {{study in}} detail the {{interface}} between P and NP by means of five new problem classes. Like the well known 2 + ¡-SAT <b>problem,</b> <b>these</b> new <b>problems</b> smoothly interpolate between P and NP by mixing together a polynomial and a NP-complete problem. In many cases, the polynomial subproblem can dominate the problem’s satisfiability and the search complexity. However, {{this is not always}} the case, and understanding why remains a very interesting open question. We identify phase transition behavior in each of <b>these</b> <b>problem</b> classes. Surprisingly we observe transitions with both smooth and sharp regions. Finally we show how <b>these</b> <b>problem</b> classes can help to understand algorithm behavior by considering search trajectories through the phase space. ...|$|R

5|$|The F-FDTL has {{suffered}} from serious morale and disciplinary problems since its establishment. <b>These</b> <b>problems</b> have been driven by uncertainty over the F-FDTL's role, poor conditions of service due to limited resources, tensions arising from FALINTIL's transition from a guerrilla organisation to a regular military and political and regional rivalries. The F-FDTL's morale and disciplinary problems have resulted in large numbers of soldiers being disciplined or dismissed. The East Timorese Government was aware of <b>these</b> <b>problems</b> before the 2006 crisis but did not rectify the factors that were contributing to low morale.|$|E

40|$|The primary {{intent of}} this paper is to analyze managerial/administrative support for the Equal Employment Opportunity Program in the U. S. Bureau of Prisons.

5|$|A {{number of}} minor {{problems}} surfaced, but were readily fixed. The yaw damper of the XF-104 {{was found to}} be ineffective and the rudder did not positively center, <b>these</b> <b>problems</b> were corrected by revising the rudder control system. The unpowered rudder did not provide adequate directional control at high air speeds (remedied by using hydraulic power on all subsequent versions of the F-104) and some concern was expressed over poor subsonic maneuverability at higher altitudes.|$|E
5|$|A survey {{conducted}} by the LNWR found that the bridges and culverts were in a fair condition, but the stations were dirty.

5|$|Broadside {{armament}} {{also had}} disadvantages, which became more serious as ironclad technology developed. Heavier guns to penetrate ever-thicker armor meant that fewer guns could be carried.

5|$|Conwy Castle was {{not well}} {{maintained}} during the early 14th century and by 1321 a survey reported it was poorly equipped, with limited stores and suffering from leaking roofs and rotten timbers. <b>These</b> <b>problems</b> persisted until Edward, the Black Prince, took {{over control of the}} castle in 1343. Sir John Weston, his chamberlain, conducted repairs, building new stone support arches for the great hall {{and other parts of the}} castle.

5|$|Damage to a German steel {{facility}} {{occurred during}} a DST transition in 1993, when a computer timing system {{linked to a}} radio time synchronization signal allowed molten steel to cool for one hour less than the required duration, resulting in spattering of molten steel when it was poured. Medical devices may generate adverse events that could harm patients, without being obvious to clinicians responsible for care. <b>These</b> <b>problems</b> are compounded when the DST rules themselves change; software developers must test and perhaps modify many programs, and users must install updates and restart applications. Consumers must update devices such as programmable thermostats with the correct DST rules or manually adjust the devices' clocks. A common strategy to resolve <b>these</b> <b>problems</b> in computer systems is to express time using the Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) rather than the local time zone. For example, Unix-based computer systems use the UTC-based Unix time internally.|$|E
