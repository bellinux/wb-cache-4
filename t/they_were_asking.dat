Members of Hui Aloha ʻĀina collected over 21,000 signatures opposing an annexation treaty. Another 17,000 signatures were collected by members of Hui Kālaiʻāina but not submitted to the Senate because <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>asking</b> for the restoration of the queen and the delegates. The petitions were used as evidence of the strong resistance of the Hawaiian community to annexation and the treaty was defeated in the Senate. After the failure of the treaty, Hawaii was instead annexed by means of a joint resolution called the Newlands Resolution, in July 1898, shortly after the outbreak of the Spanish–American War.|$|E

25|$|Protests held by Cham {{organizations}} were ignored in Albania by both major parties, both the Democratic and the Socialist party. This {{is seen by}} some analysts {{as an attempt to}} strengthen the negotiating power of the Albanian government by non-raising the Cham Issue, while it could legitimately claim that it was obliged to raise the Cham question because of such strong pressure from the Cham community. The major Cham march of 2006, also strengthened the position of the Albanian government because it provided additional arguments in the controversy over the graves of Greek soldiers on Albanian territory. The Albanian government used as a justification the fact that Greece did not allow Chams to pay homage at the graves of their forefathers, while <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>asking</b> to build several cemeteries for its soldiers killed in Albania during the Second World War.|$|E

2500|$|Jackson {{was born}} at Ankerbold, Tupton, Derbyshire, the son of Brigadier G M Jackson, {{chairman}} of the Clay Cross Co., an iron and steel business. He was educated at Harrow School and in 1914 scored 59 against Eton at Lords. He was due to go to Oxford University, but shortly after the outbreak of World War I, he was commissioned into the Derbyshire Yeomanry in October 1914. He served as a captain at Salonica in January 1918,and was awarded the Military Cross. He was also mentioned in despatches twice and also won the French Legion d’Honneur and the War Cross (Greece). Jackson was leading his troops on patrol when some Bulgarian soldiers approached, carrying a flag of truce. <b>They</b> <b>were</b> <b>asking</b> for the armistice which was to end Bulgaria’s part in the First World War.|$|E
2500|$|Of {{the various}} films that have {{attracted}} nominations {{in all four}} acting categories, Sunset Boulevard {{is one of only}} three not to win in any category, the others being My Man Godfrey (1936) and American Hustle (2013). Its eleven Oscar nominations were exceeded only by the fourteen received by All About Eve, which won six awards, including Best Picture and Best Director. Many critics predicted that the Best Actress award would be given to Gloria Swanson or Bette Davis for All About Eve and were surprised that the recipient was newcomer Judy Holliday for Born Yesterday. Swanson recalled the press's reaction following Holliday's win: [...] "It slowly dawned on me that <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>asking</b> for a larger-than-life scene, or better still, a mad scene. More accurately, they were trying to flush out Norma Desmond." ...|$|E
2500|$|What Is Your Dangerous Idea?: Today's Leading Thinkers on the Unthinkable {{is a book}} {{edited by}} John Brockman, which deals with [...] "dangerous" [...] ideas, or ideas that some people would react to in ways that suggest a {{disruption}} of morality and ethics. Scientists, philosophers, artists, and various other groups of people have written in to the online salon called the Edge, where thinkers in several areas post and discuss their ideas. [...] This collection of responses forms {{the entirety of the}} book (possibly with some excluded because of the great number of posts). [...] The basic concept behind the book is [...] "to gather a hundred of the most brilliant minds in the world in a room, lock them in, and have them ask each other the questions <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>asking</b> themselves".|$|E

Through archival recordings, he relates the story of a race of hyper-intelligent pan-dimensional beings who built a computer named Deep Thought to calculate the Answer to the Ultimate Question of Life, the Universe, and Everything. When the answer was revealed to be 42, Deep Thought explained that the answer was incomprehensible because the beings didn't know what <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>asking.</b> It went on to predict that another computer, more powerful than itself would be made and designed by it to calculate the question for the answer. (Later on, referencing this, Adams would create the 42 Puzzle, a puzzle which could be approached in multiple ways, all yielding the answer 42.) ...|$|E
2500|$|As {{night fell}} on August 13, some protesters threw {{projectiles}} at police including Molotov cocktails, and police launched {{tear gas and}} smoke bombs. While police were clearing a McDonald's restaurant, The Washington Post reporter Wesley Lowery and The Huffington Post reporter Ryan J. Reilly were arrested. Officers reportedly asked them to leave first, gave them a 45-second countdown {{when they were not}} moving fast enough, and ultimately resorted to more forceful measures to remove people from the McDonald's. [...] "Officers slammed me into a fountain soda machine because I was confused about which door <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>asking</b> me to walk out of," [...] Lowery said. Martin Baron, executive editor of The Washington Post, issued a statement, saying [...] "there was absolutely no justification for Wesley Lowery's arrest," [...] and that the police behavior [...] "was wholly unwarranted and an assault on the freedom of the press to cover the news." ...|$|E

The type of anaesthetic was requested and whether the surgeons used the concept of aqua dissection. The respondents <b>were</b> <b>asked</b> if <b>they</b> used a catheter introducer and, if so, what size catheter <b>they</b> used. <b>They</b> <b>were</b> <b>asked</b> if a cystoscopy was routinely carried out and whether this was carried out after each or both passes of the needle.
