50|$|The APEXC is an {{incredibly}} simple machine.Instruction and data words are always 32 bits long. The processor uses integer arithmetic with 2's complement representation. Addresses are 10 bits long. The APEXC has no RAM, except for a 32-bit accumulator and a 32-bit data register (used along with the 32-bit accumulator to implement 64-bit shift instructions and hold the 64-bit result of a multiplication). Instructions and data are stored in two magnetic drums, {{for a total of}} 32 circular magnetic tracks of 32 words. Since the rotation rate is 3750rpm (62.5 rotations per second), the program execution speed can go from as high as the theoretical maximum of 1 kIPS to lower than 100IPS if program instructions and data are not contiguous. Nowadays, many say a pocket calculator is faster.One oddity {{is that there is no}} program counter: each machine instruction includes the address of the next instruction. This design may sound weird, but it is the only way to achieve optimal performance with this cylinder-based memory.The machine code is made of 15 instructions only, namely addition, subtraction, multiplication, load (3 variants), store (2 variants), conditional branch, right arithmetic bit shift, right bit rotation, punched-card input, punched-card output, machine stop, and bank-switching (which is never used on the APEXC, since it only has 1024 words of storage, and addresses are 10-bit-long). A so-called vector mode enables to repeat the same operation 32 times with 32 successive memory locations. Note the lack of bitwise and/or/xor and division. Also, note the lack of indirect addressing modes: dynamic modification of opcodes is the only way one may simulate it.Another oddity is that the memory bus and the ALU are 1-bit-wide. There is a 64 kHz bit-clock and a 2 kHz word-clock, and each word memory and arithmetic operation is decomposed into 32 1-bit memory and arithmetic operations: this takes 32 bit cycles, for a total of 1 word cycle.The processor is fairly efficient: most instructions take only 2 word cycles (1 for fetch, 1 for read operand and execute), with the exception of stores, shifts and multiplications. The APEXC CPU qualifies as RISC; there is no other adequate word.Note there is no read-only memory (ROM), and therefore no bootstrap loader or default start-up program whatsoever. It is believed that no executive or operating system was ever written for the APEXC, although there were subroutine libraries of sorts for common arithmetic, I/O and debug tasks. Operation of the machine is normally done through a control panel which allows the user to start, stop and resume the central processing unit, and to alter registers and memory when the CPU is stopped. When starting the machine, the address of the first instruction of the program to be executed must be entered in the control panel, then the run switch must be pressed. Most programs end with a stop instruction, which enables the operator to check the state of the machine, possibly run some post-mortem debugging procedures (a core dump routine is described in an APEXC programming book), then enter the address of another program and run it.Two I/O devices were supported: a paper tape reader, and a paper tape puncher. The puncher output could be fed to a printer ('teletyper') unit when desirable. Printer output is emulated and is displayed on screen. Tape input was either computer-generated by the APEXC, or hand-typed with a special 32-key keyboard (each <b>tape</b> <b>row</b> had 5 data holes (<-> bits), which makes 32 differentvalues).|$|E

2500|$|Rain fell {{again on}} 4 October, {{continued}} on 5 and 6 October {{then became a}} downpour on 7 October. On 5 October, General Birdwood commander of I Anzac Corps told Plumer that the exploitation would not be possible, as the Corps light railway and the Westhoek to Zonnebeke road could not carry forward all the artillery necessary. On 7 October Haig cancelled the exploitation attack to the second objectives (red line), intended for the afternoon of 9 October. The rain stopped that night and the ground began to dry on 8 October, until late afternoon when another downpour began. From [...] over [...] of rain fell, in a month when average rainfall was [...] According to the Official Historian, the Corps Chief Engineers and divisional Commanders Royal Engineers (CRE), considered that the ground conditions did not create serious transport difficulties to the front line until 4 October and in some places up to 12 October, except in some areas where the ground became impassable, particularly in the area behind II Anzac Corps, near the Steenbeek and its tributaries, which was described as [...] "a porridge of mud". Duck-board tracks extended to [...] short of the front line, beyond which was a <b>taped</b> <b>row</b> of stakes, illuminated with lamps at night but pack animals trampled many of the tracks and stakes into the mud.|$|R
50|$|The Simon's {{architecture}} {{was based}} on relays. The programs ran from a standard paper <b>tape,</b> with five <b>rows</b> of holes for data. The registers and ALU stored only 2 bits.

50|$|While at {{her boyfriend}} Stefano's (William McNamara) apartment, the unseen assailant breaks in and attacks and overpowers Betty. He gags her with tape, ties {{her to a}} pillar and forces her to watch him kill Stefano, <b>taping</b> a <b>row</b> of needles beneath each of her eyes to ensure she sees every horrific detail. Afterwards, the hooded, masked killer unties Betty and flees the apartment. Disturbed by a half-hidden {{childhood}} recollection of the same hooded killer murdering her own mother several years earlier, Betty chooses {{not to go to}} the police and instead confides in her director, Marco (Ian Charleson) that the killer may know her.|$|R
5000|$|Millard's {{recording}} of the Led Zeppelin concert on June 21, 1977 at the Forum (allegedly <b>taped</b> from <b>row</b> number six) was released under the title Listen To This Eddie, and {{remains one of the}} best-known Led Zeppelin bootlegs. His {{recording of}} the opening number from the concert, [...] "The Song Remains The Same", was included in the promos menu of the Led Zeppelin DVD. Millard recorded all of the Rolling Stones 1975 shows at the LA Forum, and his {{recording of the}} Sunday, June 13, 1975 show (titled 'LA Friday') {{has become one of the}} most widely spread recordings of a Rolling Stones concert.|$|R
50|$|In 1897 the Baudot {{system was}} {{improved}} by switching to punched tape, which was prepared offline like the Morse tape {{used with the}} Wheatstone and Creed systems. A tape reader, controlled by the Baudot distributor, then replaced the manual keyboard. The <b>tape</b> had five <b>rows</b> of holes for the code, with a sixth row of smaller holes for transporting the tape through the reader mechanism. Baudot’s code was later standardised as International Telegraph Alphabet Number One.|$|R
50|$|When {{text was}} typed on the Monotype {{keyboard}}, the keyboard {{kept track of}} the number of units taken up by the characters in the line, and also the number of “justifying spaces” in the line. When the right margin was approached, this information was indicated to the operator on a rotating drum on the keyboard. As part of finishing a line of text, this information was punched on the <b>tape</b> using two <b>rows</b> of special keys on the keyboard.|$|R
50|$|The {{album was}} {{originally}} recorded and released in 1982 on the All Your Sins demo <b>tape,</b> as Death <b>Row.</b> The band decided to re-record some vocals and guitar parts in 1984 {{and created a}} complete new mix for their self-released debut album. The 1984 remix of the recordings appeared only on first-edition vinyl copies of the album (those with the purple logo on the cover) and that mix was never released on CD or later vinyl pressings. When Peaceville reissued the album on CD in 1993, they restored the 1982 mix and track listing to save the original spirit and charm of the recordings. All CD and LP versions released since 1993 contain the original 1982 version.|$|R

40|$|Seed tape has {{recently}} received attention {{as an alternative}} planting system for smallholder farmers in underdeveloped regions of South America, Africa, China, and India (Mateus, 2014). Seed companies are also developing seed-tape planting systems for germplasm evaluations (Deppermann et al., 2013). Although seed tape has been promoted as a method for ensuring uniform seed spacing and plant density of small-seeded flowers, herbs, and vegetables (Chancellor, 1969), little or no information {{is available on the}} use of seed <b>tape</b> for larger-seeded <b>row</b> crops and its effect on crop emergence.

50|$|Data were {{represented}} by {{the presence or absence}} of a hole at a particular location. Tapes originally had five rows of holes for data. Later tapes had six, seven and eight rows. An early electro-mechanical calculating machine, the Automatic Sequence Controlled Calculator or Harvard Mark I, used paper <b>tape</b> with twenty-four <b>rows.</b> A row of smaller sprocket holes that were always punched served to feed the tape, originally using a wheel with radial teeth called a sprocket wheel. Later optical readers used the sprocket holes to generate timing pulses. The sprocket holes are slightly to one side, making it clear which way to orient the tape in the reader and dividing the tape into unequal sides. The bits on the narrower side of the tape are generally the least significant bits, when the code is represented as numbers in a digital system.|$|R
40|$|The {{irrigation}} {{needs of}} long day onion (Allium cepa) have been extensively studied at Ontario, Oregon, {{over the past}} 22 years. Drip irrigation has compared favorably with furrow and sprinkler irrigation systems. Onions {{were found to have}} very narrow soil moisture requirements. Drier soil than optima led to yield loss and wetter soil promoted bulb decomposition. Short term water stress at the three- to six-leaf stages of plant growth promoted multiple centers in long day onion varieties. Irrigation was successfully scheduled using soil water tension or evapotranspiration. Nitrogen fertilization and plant populations have been optimized. Drip system design must carefully consider the hydraulic conductivity of the soil in the placement of <b>tape</b> and onion <b>rows</b> since the soil moisture must wick over from the drip tape to the onion plant. The drip irrigation system design uniformity, operation, and maintenance are essential given onion?s low tolerance to water stress. 201...|$|R
500|$|The vocal {{tracks were}} <b>taped</b> in Britannia <b>Row</b> and Protocol studios between May and June 1991. This {{was the first}} time vocalist Bilinda Butcher was {{involved}} in the recording. Shields and Butcher hung curtains on the window between the studio control room and the vocal booth, and only communicated with the engineers when they would acknowledge a good take by opening the curtain and waving. According to engineer Guy Fixsen, [...] "We weren't allowed to listen while either of them were doing a vocal. You'd have to watch the meters on the tape machine to see if anyone was singing. If it stopped, you knew you had to stop the tape and take it back to the top." [...] On most days, the couple arrived without having written the lyrics for the song they were to record. Dutt recalled: [...] "Kevin would sing a track, and then Bilinda would get the tape and write down words she thought he might have sung".|$|R
