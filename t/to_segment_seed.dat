40|$|We {{present a}} new method for {{generating}} general object candidates for cluttered RGB-D scenes. Starting from an over-segmentation of the image, we build a graph representation and define an object candidate as a subgraph that has maximal internal similarity {{as well as}} minimal external similarity. These candidates are created by successively adding <b>segments</b> <b>to</b> a <b>seed</b> <b>segment</b> in a saliency-guided way. Finally, the resulting object candidates are ranked based on Gestalt principles. We show that the proposed algorithm clearly outperforms three other recent methods for object discovery on the challenging Kitchen dataset...|$|R
40|$|Permanent {{implantation}} {{of radioactive}} seeds {{is a viable}} and effective therapeutic option widely used today for early stage prostate cancer. In order to perform intraoperative dosimetry the seed locations must be determined accurately with high efficiency. However, the task of seed segmentation is often hampered by {{the wide range of}} signal-to-noise ratios represented in the x-ray images due to highly non-uniform background. To circumvent the problem we have developed a new method, the spoke transform, <b>to</b> <b>segment</b> the <b>seeds</b> from the background. This method uses spoke-like rotating line segments within the two concentric windows. The mean intensity value of the pixels that fall on each rotated line segment best describing the intersection between the seed that we are trying <b>to</b> <b>segment</b> is chosen. The inner window gives an indication of the background level immediately surrounding the seeds. The outer window is an isolated region not being segmented and represents a non-seed area in need of enhancement and a detection decision. The advantages of the method are its ability (1) to work with spatially varying local backgrounds and (2) <b>to</b> <b>segment</b> the hidden <b>seeds.</b> Pd- 103 and I- 125 images demonstrate the effectiveness of the spoke transform...|$|R
40|$|Bean constitutes, with rice, {{the staple}} diet of the Brazilian people. The quality control of beans {{includes}} computing {{the percentages of}} different varieties present in a batch of beans. The selling price of the batch depends on these percentages. In this work, we propose a computer system for visual inspection of beans. We use “correlation-based multi-shape granulometry ” {{for the first time}} to spatially localize each grain in the image, together with its size, eccentricity and rotation angle. Using this technique, our system localized correct-ly 29, 993 grains out of 30, 000, even in images where many grains were “glued ” together. This is the main contribution of our work, because usually other systems fail to individual-ize “glued ” grains. Probably, the same technique can be used in many other agricultural product inspection systems <b>to</b> <b>segment</b> <b>seeds</b> and grains. After segmenting the grains, the system classifies each grain as one of the three most consumed varieties in Brazil, using a technique based on k-means and k-NN algorithms. This module classified correctly 29, 956 grains out of 29, 993. These extremely high success rates indicate that proposed system can actually be applied in automated inspection of beans...|$|R
40|$|ACCESS RESTRICTED TO THE UNIVERSITY OF MISSOURI AT AUTHOR'S REQUEST. ] Shape {{and size}} {{are among the}} most {{important}} seed characteristics measurements. This work presents an Android-based smartphone and tablet application named MUSeed that utilizes image processing techniques for seed morphometry. Unlike most of the existing tools, MUSeed does not impose restrictions on arrangement of seeds in an image since it is capable of handling touching seed instances. Firstly, RGB color space is converted to RG-chromaticity space to reduce the influence of shadows and illumination variations. Then K-means is used <b>to</b> <b>segment</b> the <b>seeds</b> from the background. To split touching seeds in the image, a Modified Marker-Controlled Watershed (MMCW) algorithm and Concave Point Analysis (CPA) are developed. Finally, the most appropriate result from two methods is selected by a fitness function and each seed is then labelled and measured. The proposed app used Android Studio as the Android application IDE. The program was implemented in Java with the help of OpenCV computer vision library. MUSeed was benchmarked against several similar tools on 7 cultivars of American elderberry (Sambucus nigra subsp. canadensis.) seeds: Bob Gordon, Marge, Ocoee, Ozark, Ozone, Wyldewood, and York...|$|R

While {{there are many different}} segmentation algorithms that exist today, most have drawbacks in respect to either efficiency or accuracy. We present an algorithm that utilizes our unique seeding procedure and integrates several of these methods to achieve robust semiautomatic segmentation on MRI that can be done efficiently on modern CPUs. The seeding method is characterized by a progression of k-Means clustering, connected components searches, and mathematical morphology iterations in order to achieve a seed that closely resembles the target shape <b>to</b> be <b>segmented.</b> The <b>seed</b> is then translated into a level set equation and evolved according to a hybrid k-Means/level set force equation until the target shape is reached. Due to our seeding method, this deformation suffers from far less local minima than had we used a generic seeding procedure. Also, because the seed is near the target shape, the computational complexity is drastically reduced while evolving the level set to its steady state. The entire process requires a single mouse click from a user inside the target region and is done on one slice of an MRI scan in two dimensions.

30|$|The {{computed}} normals {{are used}} <b>to</b> <b>segment</b> planar segments in the point cloud. The algorithm {{begins with a}} random seed point to define a new planar <b>segment.</b> The <b>seed</b> point consists of a point coordinate and its associated normal. We perform breadth-first region growing on points with similar normals. In other words, all points {{in the neighborhood of}} the segment that have a similar normal are iteratively added <b>to</b> the current <b>segment.</b> Every time a new point has been added <b>to</b> a <b>segment,</b> its normal is updated to be the average normal of all supporting points. The similarity of two normals is determined by thresholding on their angular difference. In our experiments, a conservative threshold of 10 ° has proven to work well. Segmentation stops if all points have been assigned <b>to</b> a <b>segment</b> label. The segmentation is similar to a previous method for approximate plane segmentation for organized point clouds [25].|$|R

Research was being made toward a true monogerm seed by Russian refugees Viacheslav F. Savitsky, Helen Kharetchko Savitsky, and Utah native Forrest Vern Owen. U-I and other sugar companies created the Beet Sugar Development Foundation, with a laboratory in West Jordan. Together with the USDA's Division of Sugar Plant Investigations, they financed a search for naturally occurring monogerm seeds. Two such plants were found, both in Oregon. These were named SLC Monogerm 101 and SLC Monogerm 107. The first commercial monogerm sugar beet resistant to the Curly Top blight was launched in 1955 by U-I, and by 1958 it was in large-scale production.|$|R

Hence, one can make an optimal choice of test <b>segments</b> (<b>seeds)</b> while tak-ing inherent advantage of don’t care bits in test vectors, say corresponding to random pattern resistant faults. The length of the LFSWSR can be arbitrarily increased to feed several interconnected logic blocks such that all the care bits of any deterministic test vector can be predictably generated without compromising computational ej@Aency. ...|$|R

Then, using each initial <b>segment</b> as a <b>seed,</b> we solve a graph cuts problem to refine its boundary— enforcing preferences to include nearby regions that agree with an ensemble of representative regions discovered for that cluster, and exclude those regions that resemble familiar objects. Through extensive experiments, we show that the segmentations computed jointly on the collection agree more closely with true object boundaries, when compared to either a bottom-up baseline or a graph cuts foreground segmentation that can only access cues from a single image. 1...|$|R
