5|$|Sabina {{ran out of}} {{the house}} with a hammer, {{periodically}} hitting herself over the head with it. A passing motorist, Joshua Grattage, saw <b>this</b> <b>extraordinary</b> behaviour and decided to tackle her in an attempt {{to take control of the}} hammer. While wrestling with Grattage, Sabina took a roof tile out of her pocket and struck him on the back of the head with it, stunning him temporarily.|$|E
5|$|With Goya we do {{not think}} of the studio or even of the artist at work. We think only of the event. Does this imply that The Third of May {{is a kind of}} {{superior}} journalism, the record of an incident in which depth of focus is sacrificed to an immediate effect? I am ashamed to say that I once thought so; but the longer I look at <b>this</b> <b>extraordinary</b> picture and at Goya's other works, the more clearly I recognise that I was mistaken.|$|E

25|$|The {{projecting}} {{and construction}} of the Neft Dashlari (Oil Stones) - steel pillar settlements in the open sea - heralded {{the beginning of a}} new era in post-war architecture. The Neft Dashlari was built in connection with the discovery of rich oil fields in the Caspian Sea in 1949. <b>This</b> <b>extraordinary</b> settlement includes dwelling houses, cultural objects, overpasses, etc.|$|E

25|$|As {{what happens}} with the Concurso Nacional through the Exames Nacionais do Ensino Secundário (ENES), the Extraordinary Exam Process for over-23-year-old {{candidates}} is more demanding and has a much higher selectiveness in public universities than in the public polytechnics. Humanities and other non-mathematical-intensive fields have also much higher admission rates than classical university engineering, economics or medicine. This implies that almost all new students admitted by <b>this</b> <b>extraordinary</b> process enter a polytechnic institution, private institution, or humanities programmes.|$|E

25|$|<b>This</b> <b>extraordinary</b> instrument, a prehistoric-looking {{combination}} of horn and harp created by Gaston, produces a sound so terrible and loud that it causes physical destruction all around and panics animals and even fighter jet pilots. Like {{the voice of}} the bard Cacofonix in Asterix, it horrifies everyone except its originator. The first time the instrument appears, the plucking of just one string causes the floor to collapse. Gaston has also created at least one other instrument in the same vein, and an electric version of the Gaffophone. Fantasio has tried several times {{to get rid of the}} Gaffophone, without success.|$|E

25|$|Altdorfer's painted landscapes {{are usually}} vertical, and, {{if only because}} it was {{commissioned}} for a vertical space, {{this is the case}} for the most extreme of all large world landscapes, his The Battle of Alexander at Issus (1529, Munich). <b>This</b> <b>extraordinary</b> painting shows a view right across the Mediterranean, with a mass of tiny figures fighting a great battle in the foreground. They are in modern Turkey, and the view extends beyond the island of Cyprus to the coast of Egypt and the Sinai peninsula and the Red Sea. The painting originally formed one part of a set of historical paintings in the same format.|$|E
25|$|<b>This</b> <b>extraordinary</b> strong {{frequency}} dependence {{can be explained}} by the different distances the ions have to move in the electrode's pores. The area at the beginning of the pores can easily be accessed by the ions. The short distance is accompanied by low electrical resistance. The greater the distance the ions have to cover, the higher the resistance. This phenomenon can be described with a series circuit of cascaded RC (resistor/capacitor) elements with serial RC time constants. These result in delayed current flow, reducing the total electrode surface area that can be covered with ions if polarity changes – capacitance decreases with increasing AC frequency. Thus, the total capacitance is only achieved after longer measuring times.|$|E
25|$|The trachea {{is an area}} of dead space: the oxygen-poor air it {{contains}} at the end of exhalation is the first air to re-enter the posterior air sacs and lungs. In comparison to the mammalian respiratory tract, the dead space volume in a bird is, on average, 4.5times greater than it is in mammals of the same size. Birds with long necks will inevitably have long tracheae, and must therefore take deeper breaths than mammals do to make allowances for their greater dead space volumes. In some birds (e.g. the whooper swan, Cygnus cygnus, the white spoonbill, Platalea leucorodia, the whooping crane, Grus americana, and the helmeted curassow, Pauxi pauxi) the trachea, which some cranes can be 1.5m long, is coiled back and forth within the body, drastically increasing the dead space ventilation. The purpose of <b>this</b> <b>extraordinary</b> feature is unknown.|$|E

50|$|<b>This</b> typologically <b>extraordinary</b> {{inventory}} {{appears to}} result from extended contact influence from substratal and superstratal languages, due to long-running bilinguality.

25|$|Prior to 1922, Woodhaven Boulevard was {{the only}} {{important}} north-south street in town. However, it ended at Liberty Avenue. Then officials decided to expand Woodhaven Boulevard all the way south to the Rockaways and finally opened it to traffic in 1925. This made Ozone Park more accessible by both bus and car. Since cars were also becoming more popular at that time, the land became much more valuable, leading to a construction boom {{in an attempt to}} fill any empty lot. Between 1921 and 1930, Ozone Park saw a population increase of over 180% from 40,000 to 112,950 people. With <b>this</b> <b>extraordinary</b> increase in population came the need for schools and sources of entertainment. In response to this demand came the construction of John Adams High School in 1930. This school was built just as the construction boom slowed down and right before the Great Depression. Furthermore, in 1925 the development of the Cross-Bay Movie Theatre gave residents the ability to go and see a show while also connecting with neighbors.|$|E
25|$|The New Hampshire primary is {{the first}} in a series of {{nationwide}} party primary elections and the second party contest (the first being the Iowa Caucuses) held in the United States every four years as part of the process of choosing the delegates to the Democratic and Republican national conventions which choose the party nominees for the presidential elections to be held the subsequent November. Although only a few delegates are chosen in the New Hampshire primary, its real importance comes from the massive media coverage it receives (along with the first caucus in Iowa). Spurred by the events of the 1968 election, reforms that began with the 1972 election elevated the two states' importance to the overall election, and began to receive as much media attention as all other state contests combined. Examples of <b>this</b> <b>extraordinary</b> coverage have been seen on the campuses of Dartmouth College and Saint Anselm College, as the colleges have held multiple national debates and have attracted media outlets like NPR, Fox News, CNN, NBC, and ABC. The publicity and momentum can be enormous from a decisive win by a frontrunner, or better-than-expected result in the New Hampshire primary. The upset or weak showing by a front-runner changes the calculus of national politics in a matter of hours, as happened in 1952 (D), 1968 (D), 1980 (R), and 2008 (D).|$|E
500|$|As critic John King notes, [...] "it is {{impossible}} to summarize <b>this</b> <b>extraordinary</b> novel in a few lines. [...] It incorporates {{the latest developments in}} linguistic theory and practice, talks of the arbitrariness and unreliability of language that purports to describe reality, rereads and comments upon the various histories and travelers’ accounts of Paraguay, ranges across the breadth of Latin American history, implicitly condemning Stroessner and debating with Fidel Castro, and exploring once again the gap between writer and reader." ...|$|E
50|$|In {{addition}} to the two Mimesii, the two instances of the praenomen Nerius, which was typical of Umbrian names, and one of Vibius, which was relatively uncommon at Rome, make <b>this</b> inscription <b>extraordinary,</b> in terms of demonstrating that praenomina scarce at Rome could be widespread in the countryside.|$|R
50|$|The {{eye of the}} octopus has {{the same}} {{complicated}} structure as the human eye. As a result, it is often substituted in studies of the eye when using a human eye would be inappropriate.

60|$|The {{place where}} <b>this</b> most <b>extraordinary</b> royal meeting was held was called Picquigny, and the treaty {{which was made}} there is known in history as the Treaty of Picquigny.

500|$|The {{question}} of admitting the Roman Catholics to the franchise {{was at the}} time being agitated, and found many warm supporters in the convention. The proposal was extremely obnoxious to the Irish government, and {{on the second day of}} the meeting the secretary of state, George Ogle, announced that the Roman Catholics, in the person of Lord Kenmare, had relinquished the idea of making any claim further than the religious liberty they then enjoyed, and gave as his authority for <b>this</b> <b>extraordinary</b> statement Sir Boyle Roche, by whom it was confirmed! ...|$|E
500|$|In May 2009, Disney Channel's {{executive}} vice president Gary Marsh issued a press release, which stated: [...] "with this second-season extension, the cast of 'The Suite Life' makes Disney Channel history by becoming the longest running continuous characters on our air – 138 half-hour episodes. We are thrilled for them, and for the brilliant, inspired production team that made <b>this</b> <b>extraordinary</b> run possible." [...] According to the Wall Street Journal, Song's participation in the series led to her becoming highly popular among {{children between the ages}} of seven and ten.|$|E
500|$|In The Scotsman, Graham Leicester {{writes that}} the [...] "overblown rhetoric invites a sceptical reaction. But I suggest we just accept <b>this</b> <b>extraordinary</b> {{compliment}} graciously." [...] It was likely influenced by Thomas Cahill's How the Irish Saved Civilization {{and the result of}} a marketing strategy. Several reviewers found that Herman was successful in proving that Scots did have a disproportionate impact on modernity. Herman continued this type of theme with his next book, To Rule the Waves: How the British Navy Shaped the Modern World, published in 2004.|$|E
