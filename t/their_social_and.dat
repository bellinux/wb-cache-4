Two of the students are trans women, and two are trans men. Each of them attends a different school in the United States, and they are each at a different stage of their degree programs.

5|$|Misbah Al-Khayr and Hashim Al-Samira'i, in {{an article}} from the 1995 book Children in the Muslim Middle East, {{reported}} on a study that sought to evaluate the influence of Iftah Ya Simsim on its Baghdad viewers' knowledge about language, general information, mathematics, science, and moral principles. The study found that 85% of all children residing in Baghdad had watched it and that they interacted with and were attached to many of its characters, who exposed viewers to the accents of the region. The most popular segments were those that contained cartoons, songs, and puppets. The show's viewers demonstrated an increase in their understanding and knowledge in all areas, especially information about <b>their</b> <b>social</b> <b>and</b> natural environment.|$|E

5|$|The Afrasiab {{paintings}} of the 6th to 7th centuries in Samarkand, Uzbekistan offer a rare surviving example of Sogdian art. The paintings, showing scenes of daily life and {{events such as the}} arrival of foreign ambassadors, are located within the ruins of aristocratic homes. It is unclear if any of these palatial residences served as the official palace of the rulers of Samarkand. The oldest surviving Sogdian monumental wall murals date to the 5th century and are located at Panjakent, Tajikistan. In addition to revealing aspects of <b>their</b> <b>social</b> <b>and</b> political lives, Sogdian art has also been instrumental in aiding historians' understanding of their religious beliefs. For instance, it is clear that Buddhist Sogdians incorporated some of their own Persian deities into their version of the Buddhist Pantheon. At Zhetysu, Sogdian gilded bronze plaques on a Buddhist temple show a pairing of a male and female deity with outstretched hands holding a miniature camel, a common non-Buddhist image similarly found in the {{paintings of}} Samarkand and Panjakent.|$|E
5|$|There is an {{extensive}} {{body of research}} demonstrating a significant association between attachment organizations and children's functioning across multiple domains. Early insecure attachment does not necessarily predict difficulties, {{but it is a}} liability for the child, particularly if similar parental behaviours continue throughout childhood. Compared to that of securely attached children, the adjustment of insecure children in many spheres of life is not as soundly based, putting their future relationships in jeopardy. Although the link is not fully established by research and there are other influences besides attachment, secure infants are more likely to become socially competent than their insecure peers. Relationships formed with peers influence the acquisition of social skills, intellectual development and the formation of social identity. Classification of children's peer status (popular, neglected or rejected) has been found to predict subsequent adjustment. Insecure children, particularly avoidant children, are especially vulnerable to family risk. <b>Their</b> <b>social</b> <b>and</b> behavioural problems increase or decline with deterioration or improvement in parenting. However, an early secure attachment appears to have a lasting protective function. As with attachment to parental figures, subsequent experiences may alter the course of development.|$|E

40|$|The {{primary focus}} {{of this study is}} to explore young {{children}} 2 ̆ 7 s knowledge of <b>their</b> <b>social</b> network <b>and</b> <b>their</b> <b>social</b> competence <b>and</b> the links with <b>their</b> <b>social</b> behaviour. The secondary focus is to investigate ways in which young children may be helped to articulate such knowledge. The six participants were pairs of five-year old children selected from three pre-primary classes located in a common school. Each pair comprised a socially able and a less socially able child as selected by their class teacher. Self-reports, dialogue-interviews, video-taped vignettes and dolls were used to help the participants talk about their knowledge of <b>their</b> <b>social</b> networks <b>and</b> <b>their</b> <b>social</b> competence. Classroom observations were made to determine the extent to which children 2 ̆ 7 s reports aligned with <b>their</b> <b>social</b> behaviour. Results showed that young children are able to articulate knowledge about the abstract concepts regarding <b>their</b> <b>social</b> world. The study found that the children who knew more about <b>their</b> <b>social</b> network also knew more about behaving in socially competent ways and exhibited a greater degree of those behaviours. The children who knew less about <b>their</b> <b>social</b> network also knew less about behaving in socially competent ways and exhibited a lesser degree of social competence. Resulting implications include increasing teacher awareness of the kinds of social stresses facing many pre-primary children today, and implementing strategies in the classroom for maximising children 2 ̆ 7 s knowledge about <b>their</b> <b>social</b> networks <b>and</b> <b>social</b> competence...|$|R

25|$|During childhood, {{siblings}} are {{a source}} of conflict and frustration as well as a support system. Adolescence may affect this relationship differently, depending on sibling gender. In same-sex sibling pairs, intimacy increases during early adolescence, then remains stable. Mixed-sex siblings pairs act differently; siblings drift apart during early adolescent years, but experience an increase in intimacy starting at middle adolescence. Sibling interactions are children's first relational experiences, the ones that shape <b>their</b> <b>social</b> <b>and</b> self-understanding for life. Sustaining positive sibling relations can assist adolescents in a number of ways. Siblings are able to act as peers, and may increase one another's sociability and feelings of self-worth. Older siblings can give guidance to younger siblings, although the impact of this can be either positive or negative depending on the activity of the older sibling.|$|E

These tombs lie in a row on a north-south axis. There is a slight break in the natural rock terrace, on to which they open, that divides the thirty-nine high status tombs into two groups. The basic design of these elite tombs was an outer court and a rock-cut pillared room (sometimes {{referred to as the}} chapel) in which there was a shaft that led to the burial chamber.|$|E
