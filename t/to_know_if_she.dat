2500|$|The main {{target of}} the Nazis was Berta Geissmar. She {{was so close to}} the {{conductor}} that she wrote in her book about Furtwängler that the Nazis had begun an investigation <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> was his mistress. After having harassed her for a period of two years, she moved to London when she became Sir Thomas Beecham's main assistant. In the book she wrote on Furtwängler in England in 1943, she said: ...|$|E
2500|$|Initially, Hill {{was given}} a best-case {{prognosis}} of two years to live. Her father recalled that immediately after the diagnosis, [...] "I got weak, [...] Lisa got sick, and typical Lauren she wanted <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> could still play basketball." [...] She indeed continued to play in her senior season at Lawrenceburg High despite undergoing regular chemotherapy and radiation treatments, and as scheduled came to MSJ for the 2014–15 season. In September 2014, she had an MRI that revealed that the tumor had grown; at that time, doctors told her and her family that she would probably die {{before the end of}} the year. Shortly after this diagnosis, she told new MSJ head coach Dan Benjamin, [...] "One game. I want to play one college game." [...] She also chose to spend her last months as an advocate for DIPG research, which had made little progress at the time.|$|E
2500|$|Mina's father, Egberto, {{enters and}} observes her writing a letter. [...] Already {{suspicious}} {{of what he}} believes {{has been going on}} between Godvino and Mina, he demands <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> is writing to Godvino. Snatching away the unfinished letter, he reads the words addressed not to Godvino but to Aroldo - [...] "I am no longer worthy of you" [...] - and realizes that he was not mistaken. [...] He begins to demand that Mina keep silent and ensure Aroldo's continued love (Duet: Dite che il fallo a tergere / [...] "You mean that your heart lacks the strength to wipe away your guilt?") while she further resists. [...] Again, demanding that she obey him, he continues to make his demands: (Duet: Ed io pure in faccia agl'uomini / [...] "And must I smother my rage....Must I conquer my shame?"). [...] Finally, Egberto repeats his demands that she relent: it is his will, it is her duty as a wife, she must stop crying, and no one must suspect anything. She appears to relent (Duet: Or meco venite, il pianto non vale / [...] "Come with me now, weeping will not help you").|$|E
6000|$|... "No, you didn't tell me, and that's why I'm {{so anxious}} <b>to</b> <b>know.</b> <b>If</b> <b>she's</b> got the mumps, and the chilblains, and the ingrowing warts--" ...|$|R
60|$|I want <b>to</b> <b>know.</b> <b>If</b> <b>she's</b> been pulling strings {{to get him}} moved I suppose it's {{for some}} reason. He was very {{comfortable}} here. It's not often you find a secretary who exactly suits you.|$|R
6000|$|... "'Jennie,' he said, 'my {{wife said}} Duane {{came here to}} see you. I believe she's lyin'. I think she's been carryin' on with him, an' I want <b>to</b> <b>KNOW.</b> <b>If</b> <b>she's</b> been an' {{you tell me the}} truth I'll let you go. I'll send you out to Huntsville, where you can {{communicate}} with your friends. I'll give you money.' ...|$|R
60|$|Oh, nothing much; only a {{king was}} {{out there in the}} road, and wanted <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> would sell the apple yonder for a potful of gold.|$|E
6000|$|... "All right," [...] Edna went on. [...] "And now Nan Bellayne wants <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> and {{her sister}} can come out this {{afternoon}} and draw Nan Bellayne's pay?" ...|$|E
60|$|He {{looked at}} her <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> meant it, and finding that she did, {{returned}} to his post. When the mill had rumbled on a little longer he came back.|$|E
60|$|CONSTABLE. [With puzzled sadness.] True enough, sir--that! We'd {{just begun}} <b>to</b> <b>know</b> 'er. <b>If</b> <b>she</b> 'as been taken--her best friends couldn't wish 'er better.|$|R
60|$|I {{thought she}} must be walking in her sleep, but I crawled {{out of bed and}} got into a dressing-gown. I knew Aunt Agatha well enough <b>to</b> <b>know</b> that, <b>if</b> <b>she</b> had come to see me, she was going to see me. That's the sort of woman she is.|$|R
6000|$|... 'She will be {{much too}} wise to do {{anything}} of the kind; she has sense enough <b>to</b> <b>know</b> that <b>if</b> <b>she</b> did so, you would inform a Christian populace what conditions she offered you, and, with all her contempt for {{the burden of the}} flesh, she has no mind to be lightened of that pretty load by being torn in pieces by Christian monks; a very probable ending for her in any case, as she herself, in her melancholy moods, confesses!' ...|$|R
60|$|Mrs. Harrell {{brought a}} lot of {{crystallized}} fruits from New Orleans for you. She wants <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> shall send them around on Bois d'arc or keep them 'til you return. Answer.|$|E
6000|$|The servant {{entered the}} room. 'Please, mis'ess {{says she is}} afraid you won't have your things to-night, 'm. They say the steamer can't land, and mis'ess wants <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> can do anything?' ...|$|E
6000|$|Peace reigned for an hour, {{then the}} bell rang and Mary came giggling up to say: 'A queer kind of a lady wants <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> can catch a {{grasshopper}} in the garden.' ...|$|E
50|$|Accompanying the teddies is a small, monkey-like animal {{they call}} a durriken. They say it’s a pet, but fifteen-year-old Nikki Jamison knows the odd little {{creature}} {{is far more than}} a pet. When she first caught sight of it shortly after Zeke and Simon landed their spaceship across the road from Nikki’s house, she saw something in the durriken’s eyes that dredged up long-buried emotions. Now she’s desperate for another look at the durriken. <b>She</b> needs <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>if</b> what <b>she</b> saw in its strange eyes was real.|$|R
50|$|Michael gives {{a public}} apology to a news crew, after which Jo tells him <b>to</b> let her <b>know</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> {{can help with}} any of his problems. When Michael {{half-jokingly}} asks to bring Holly back to Scranton, Jo sincerely tells him she will look into it, leaving him {{at a loss for}} words as the episode ends.|$|R
3000|$|... 20 is not achieved, {{probabilistic}} {{risk assessment}} of the final MC can be implemented in a kiln-drying operation. For example, {{at the end of}} drying process, a kiln operator measures the MC of a limited number of test samples <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>if</b> he or <b>she</b> should stop the kiln containing thousands of pieces dried simultaneously. These findings may lead to a higher quality control of kiln-dried lumber.|$|R
6000|$|They ran in, {{apparently}} on excellent {{terms with}} her, and greeted her guest without shyness; {{but after a}} little whispering and shoving the youngest spoke. 'Edie and Reggie want <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> is the lady that put out the light?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I {{would like}} to see----' He could not help {{colouring}} till his cheeks rivaled the colour of his sword-knot. 'I want just <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> is here. I know not if she be called Madame or Mademoiselle de Ribaumont.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Charley Welsh is sick," [...] she began, {{when the}} {{connection}} had been made. [...] "What? No I'm not Charley Welsh. Charley Welsh is sick, {{and his sister}} wants <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> can come out this afternoon and draw his pay for him?" ...|$|E
60|$|To this I {{was forced}} to agree. I here {{definitely}} declare that the psychic was not concerned with the flight of the cone in any way <b>known</b> <b>to</b> biology. <b>If</b> <b>she</b> produced the voices, they too must have been examples of supernormal ventriloquism, for they came through the megaphone. Of that I am as certain as one can be of an auditory impression.|$|R
50|$|Another major {{encounter}} with death occurs when Jackie Shorr (who is {{revealed to be}} a demented serial killer) comes into his life and claims to be his mother. It is still not known for sure whether this claim is true or not, as the same claim is made by many others. She, however, insists that those she killed and left mummified in her basement were substitutes for Rick, {{and that he is}} her real son. Shorr is discovered to be insane, but not until after she kills Marlo by stabbing her with a kitchen knife. A horrified Rick refuses to test her DNA, saying that he doesn't want <b>to</b> <b>know,</b> especially <b>if</b> <b>she</b> is truly his mother.|$|R
50|$|Since Cathy {{personally}} got {{attacked by}} the killers, she is now willing to give some information to Grace, just as Grace had predicted. Cathy tells Grace that she hypothetically would be an accessory to homicide <b>if</b> <b>she</b> did in fact witness the death at Kappa in 1995 and proceeded to cover it up. She says that even <b>if</b> <b>she</b> did think the murders were linked to what happened 20 years ago, she couldn't start offering up information to the authorities because she would risk implicating herself. She also says that she thought someone would just shoot the killer and {{it would all be}} over with, but now, since they are coming after her, and Wallace University would not survive without her, something needs to be done. She then hands Grace a file that contains the name of the girl who died in the tub. Grace then looks at the name of the bathtub baby's mother - Sophia Doyle (McKaley Miller). She immediately gets confused because she was convinced that she was the bathtub baby, but her mom's last name was Mulligan, according to her dad. Dean Munsch tells Grace that she acts like she's a hero who's trying to solve the murders and bring justice to the campus, but really it's just about her finding out who her mother is. Grace gets angry and says she wants to solve the murders, but <b>she</b> also wants <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>if</b> <b>she's</b> the reason why they're happening. Cathy then says to Grace she might have something for her but she's gonna get filthy doing it, and Grace storms out the office.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, you wouldn't at {{all events}} have ceased to like me, would you?" [...] Owen demanded. It evidently mattered to him <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> really {{justified}} Mona. [...] "I mean of course {{if you had}} liked me--liked me as she liked me," [...] he explained.|$|E
60|$|On {{reaching}} Toller's cottage, I was distressed (but hardly surprised) to {{hear that}} Cristel, exhausted after a wakeful night, still kept her bed, {{in the hope of}} getting some sleep. I was so anxious <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> was at rest, that her father went upstairs to look at her.|$|E
60|$|She did {{not come}} one morning, but sent her brother, who only laughed, and said Marie had hurt her foot, when we inquired for her. Anxious <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> was really ill, {{we went to see}} her in the afternoon, and heard a pretty little story of {{practical}} Christianity.|$|E
50|$|Sally {{has wanted}} Charlie Brown's bedroom for years. Every time he either leaves {{home for a}} while (such as going to summer camp) or talks about leaving, {{the first thing she}} always wants <b>to</b> <b>know</b> is <b>if</b> <b>she</b> can have his room while he is gone. A few times, she has {{actually}} begun to move her possessions into her brother's room when she thinks he is never coming home, such as when Charlie Brown fails to come home after falling ill during a baseball game in the strip from July 10, 1979, when he gets lost in the woods in a series of strips from November 1980, and when Snoopy accidentally turns him invisible in the TV special It's Magic, Charlie Brown.|$|R
6000|$|... "I didn't tell you, dear," [...] said Maggie, {{making a}} great effort to command herself, [...] "because you've been so busy. But {{some time ago}} I wrote to our old governess, Miss Firniss, to ask her <b>to</b> let me <b>know</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> met with any {{situation}} that I could fill, and the other day I had a letter from her telling me that I could take three orphan pupils of hers to the coast during the holidays, and then make trial of a situation with her as teacher. I wrote yesterday to accept the offer." ...|$|R
50|$|In {{a mission}} for the All-Mother, Loki {{travelled}} from space to Midgard {{in order to}} collect five keys Odin had once forged for him, should he be worthy. Using his sorcery and wits, Loki used the keys to claim Gram, the sword of Sigurd, as his own. He also befriends a human, Verity Wills, with the power <b>to</b> always <b>know</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> is being lied to. She and Loki develop a great friendship, and through him she develops friendships with Sigurd and Lorelei, while Loki continues to run missions for the All-Mother. He later discovers that he is being manipulated by King Loki, his villainous and depraved future self, who {{is much the same}} as the old Loki was before his death and resurrection. While Loki fears one day becoming King Loki, he also knows his future self is determined to make it happen.|$|R
6000|$|... 'It {{appears to}} be her native part of the country, sir. She informs me that she makes one of her {{professional}} visits here, every year, sir. I met her in the street this afternoon, and she wished <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> might have the honour of waiting on you after dinner, sir.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "None of them," [...] she replied. [...] "He {{went away}} two hours since on foot. As I {{understood}} it, his object {{was to make}} fresh inquiries about the woman named Anne Catherick. He appears to be unreasonably anxious about tracing her. Do you happen <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> is dangerously mad, Miss Halcombe?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Isobel--the Princess Isobel, if you like--has been lured {{from our}} care by a forged message. We know her history now, {{and we are}} able to {{understand}} the nature of the interest which your mistress has shown in her. Therefore, when I find her missing I come to you. I want <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> is in this house." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Not a farthing of it, sir. She {{said she}} would never be beholden to Catherick for bit or drop, <b>if</b> <b>she</b> lived to be a hundred. And she has kept her word ever since. When my poor dear husband died, and left all to me, Catherick's letter was put in my {{possession}} with the other things, and I told her <b>to</b> let me <b>know</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> was ever in want. 'I'll let all England know I'm in want,' she said, 'before I tell Catherick, or any friend of Catherick's. Take that for your answer, and give it to HIM for an answer, if he ever writes again.'" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Adam," [...] Arthur said, impelled to full {{confession}} now, [...] "it {{would never}} have happened <b>if</b> I'd <b>known</b> you loved her. That would have helped to save me from it. And I did struggle. I never meant to injure her. I deceived you afterwards--and that led on to worse; but I thought it was forced upon me, I {{thought it was the}} best thing I could do. And in that letter I told her <b>to</b> let me <b>know</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> were in any trouble: don't think I would not have done everything I could. But I was all wrong from the very first, and horrible wrong has come of it. God knows, I'd give my life if I could undo it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'No, no--of {{course you}} did not. Well, though I never saw his face, to my knowledge, till {{a short time}} ago, I <b>know</b> enough <b>to</b> say that, if earnest {{representations}} can prevent it, this marriage shall not be. Father knew him, or about him, very well; and he once told me--what I cannot tell you. Fancy, I have seen him three times--yesterday, last night, and this morning--besides helping him on the road some weeks ago, and never once considered {{that he might be}} Lord Mountclere. He is here almost in disguise, one may say; neither man nor horse is with him; and his object accounts for his privacy. I see how it is--she is doing this to benefit her brothers and sisters, <b>if</b> possible; but <b>she</b> ought <b>to</b> <b>know</b> that <b>if</b> <b>she</b> is miserable they will never be happy. That's the nature of women--they take the form for the essence, and that's what she is doing now. I should think her guardian angel must have quitted her when she agreed to a marriage which may tear her heart out like a claw.' ...|$|R
