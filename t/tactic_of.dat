5|$|After {{the first}} two {{large-scale}} battles between the Spanish and Pipil armies resulted in decisive victories for the European invaders, the natives preferred to flee their settlements at their approach rather than face the conquistadors on an open battlefield.

5|$|According to Herodotus and Diodorus, the king, {{having taken}} {{the measure of}} the enemy, threw his best troops into a second assault the same day, the Immortals, an elite corps of 10,000 men. However, the Immortals fared no better than the Medes, and failed to make any headway against the Greeks. The Spartans {{apparently}} used a <b>tactic</b> <b>of</b> feigning retreat, and then turning and killing the enemy troops when they ran after them.|$|E

5|$|Foliot {{was mainly}} {{a force for}} {{moderation}} in the quarrel between the king and the archbishop, urging restraint on Becket and curbing the king's attempts to impose the Constitutions more rigorously. Foliot's rhetoric against the archbishop was pointed and effective. Foliot also developed the novel legal filing of ad cautelam, which was {{an appeal to the}} papacy against any future action by the archbishop. Although Foliot's <b>tactic</b> <b>of</b> ad cautelam was ridiculed by his opponents, the papacy did not challenge the technique.|$|E

5|$|The <b>tactic</b> <b>of</b> {{continuous}} forward patrolling was {{so successful}} that the advancing force's every move was known to the defenders, but the light horsemen were substantially outnumbered and could not stop the advance.

40|$|Abstract. The article {{presents}} the analysis <b>of</b> the accusation <b>tactics</b> that implement a discrediting {{strategy in the}} U. S. diplomatic discourse. The aim of the article is to study speech acts that shape <b>tactics</b> <b>of</b> accusation in implementing a discrediting strategy. The article offers a classification of markers <b>of</b> the communicative <b>tactics</b> <b>of</b> accusation that implement a discrediting strategy in the public statements of US diplomats, namely V. Nuland, G. Pyatt, S. Power, D. Baer, related to the military conflict in eastern Ukraine. The total number of public speeches that have been analyzed is 97 (from 2013 to 2015). A special attention is drawn to the speech acts and how they implement the <b>tactics</b> <b>of</b> accusation in diplomatic discourse. The author has {{found out that the}} <b>tactics</b> <b>of</b> accusation is basic and the most common <b>tactics</b> <b>of</b> implementing the discrediting strategy in the studied speeches. At the core <b>of</b> these <b>tactics</b> are mainly direct assertive speech acts...|$|R
5|$|After a lull, anti-shipping {{operations}} {{attacks were}} resumed by some Ju 87 units from 1 November 1940, {{as part of}} the new winter <b>tactic</b> <b>of</b> enforcing a blockade. Over the next 10 days, seven merchant ships were sunk or damaged, mainly in the Thames Estuary, for the loss of four Ju 87s. On 14 November 19 Stukas from III./St.G 1 with escort drawn from JG 26 and JG 51 went out against another convoy; as no targets were found over the estuary, the Stukas proceeded to attack Dover, their alternate target.|$|E
5|$|Another {{solution}} to {{the vulnerability of the}} RAF bombers was to fly at night, which was taken up as the primary <b>tactic</b> <b>of</b> Bomber Command. The Mk. X proved {{to be very difficult to}} read at night and bombers that carried it were quickly refitted with the earlier Mk. VII or Mk. IX sight. The Norden was unable to work at night at all; the bomb aimer had to locate the target long in advance of the drop point using a built-in telescope and targets were simply not visible at the required distances in low light.|$|E
5|$|Cannae {{played a}} major role in shaping the {{military}} structure and tactical organization of the Roman Republican army. At Cannae, the Roman infantry assumed a formation similar to the Greek phalanx. This left them vulnerable to Hannibal's <b>tactic</b> <b>of</b> double envelopment since their inability to maneuver independently from the mass of the army made it impossible for them to counter the strategic encirclement used by the Carthaginian cavalry. The laws of the Roman state requiring command to alternate between the two consuls restricted strategic consistency.|$|E

5|$|Due to a {{combination}} of political and strategic decisions, it was almost two years before the battalion went into combat again. In late 1944, in order to free up American troops for operations in the Philippines, Australian forces were directed to take over responsibility for operations around Aitape in New Guinea. The 6th Division returned to New Guinea in November 1944, with the final brigade arriving on 31 December 1944. Although basically cut off from resupply, there were around 35,000 Japanese troops in the area, holding the coast past Wewak and into the interior. Supported by food supplies from native gardens in the Torricelli Mountains, the Japanese put up heavy resistance to the Australians' primary <b>tactic</b> <b>of</b> aggressive patrolling.|$|E
5|$|His <b>tactic</b> <b>of</b> {{diving into}} {{opposing}} formations often found him {{under fire from}} all directions, resulting in his aircraft being damaged beyond repair; consequently, Eduard Neumann was losing his patience. Marseille persisted, and created a unique self-training programme for himself, both physical and tactical, which resulted not just in outstanding situational awareness, marksmanship and confident control of the aircraft, but also in a unique attack tactic that preferred a high angle deflection shooting attack and shooting at the target's front from the side, instead of the common method of chasing an aircraft and shooting at it directly from behind. Marseille often practiced these tactics {{on the way back}} from missions with his comrades. Marseille became known as a master of deflection shooting.|$|E
5|$|Liverpool {{entered the}} 1983–84 European Cup as league champions {{for the fourth}} time in five seasons. Victories over Odense of Denmark and Spanish champions Athletic Bilbao brought Liverpool to face Portuguese champions Benfica in the quarter-finals. Liverpool won the first leg at Anfield 1–0. In the second leg, their <b>tactic</b> <b>of</b> {{withdrawing}} Dalglish into midfield put Benfica's game plan into disarray, leading to a 4–1 match victory and a 5–1 aggregate victory. Their opponents in the semi-finals were Dinamo București of Romania. The tie proved a brutal encounter, characterised by Souness breaking the jaw of the Bucharest captain Lică Movilă, and was won 3–1 on aggregate by Liverpool.|$|E

5|$|Louise Arbour {{began her}} job as Chief Prosecutor of war crimes at the UN in October 1996. She was {{unexpectedly}} selected by her predecessor, Richard Goldstone, as he believed she processed the toughness to pursue war crime suspects and the bureaucratic and diplomatic skills to function at the UN. At the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia, contrary to Goldstone's <b>tactic</b> <b>of</b> publicizing indictments, which allowed the accused to make their arrest a risk to the ceasefire, Arbour kept hers sealed allowing for surprise arrests. In Rwanda she achieved several high-profile prosecutions, including the first conviction for rape as a war crime. By time she left in Fall 1999, her office had Slobodan Milošević, a head of state, indicted and arrested.|$|E
5|$|One of Koniecpolski's {{greatest}} victories {{occurred during}} a winter 1644 campaign against Tatars. With a large army of some 19,000 soldiers (60% of them, magnates' private armies; Koniecpolski's own forces numbered 2,200) he dealt a crushing defeat to Toğay bey's forces near Ochmatów on 30 January 1644. Many Tatars drowned near Sina Woda when the ice {{over the water}} gave way. The Battle of Ochmatów, the Commonwealth's greatest victory over the Tatars {{in the first half}} of the 17th century, brought international fame to Koniecpolski, who had not only predicted the time and place of their attack but had destroyed their forces before they could deploy their usual <b>tactic</b> <b>of</b> splitting their main forces into multiple highly-mobile units (czambuls).|$|E
5|$|Scholar William Luis observes {{a strong}} {{resemblance}} between {{the structure of}} Julia Alvarez’s How the García Girls Lost Their Accents and Alejo Carpentier's Viaje a la Semilla as both employ the <b>tactic</b> <b>of</b> backwards narration and consequently lay claim to two beginnings and two endings. Alvarez has also been said to follow the stylistic traditions established by novels such as Pedro Juan Labarthe's The Son of Two Nations: The Private Life of a Columbia Student (1931), Marcio Veloz Maggiolo's El prófugo (1962), Humberto Cintrón's Frankie Cristo (1972), and Richard Ruiz's The Hungry American (1978). Despite the overtly North American stylistic qualities the book appears to boast at first glance, each of the aforementioned authors are of Hispanic descent.|$|E

5|$|Targeted Killings: Law and Morality in an Asymmetrical World {{begins with}} an {{introduction}} by Andrew Altman. This is followed by eighteen essays broken into five sections arranged by topic. The work says that after the Al-Qaeda attacks in the United States on 11 September 2001, the US and other countries {{began to see the}} <b>tactic</b> <b>of</b> targeted killing differently. The practice of targeted killing had previously been accepted in situations of self-defense in military settings; after the attacks it was used to kill non-combatants and those not directly involved in a particular armed force.|$|E
5|$|The {{most common}} tactic used by Palestinians during the Intifada was {{throwing}} stones, molotov cocktails, and burning tires. The local leadership in some West Bank towns commenced non-violent protests against Israeli occupation {{by engaging in}} tax resistance and other boycotts. Israel responded by confiscating {{large sums of money}} in house-to-house raids. As the Intifada came to a close, new armed Palestinian groups—in particular Hamas and the Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ)—began targeting Israeli civilians with the new <b>tactic</b> <b>of</b> suicide bombings, and internal fighting amongst the Palestinians increased dramatically.|$|E
5|$|The {{revival of}} ramming had a {{significant}} effect on naval tactics. Since the 17th century the predominant <b>tactic</b> <b>of</b> naval warfare had been the line of battle, where a fleet formed a long line to give it the best fire from its broadside guns. This tactic was totally unsuited to ramming, and the ram threw fleet tactics into disarray. The question of how an ironclad fleet should deploy in battle to make best use of the ram was never tested in battle, and if it had been, combat might have shown that rams could only be used against ships which were already stopped dead in the water.|$|E

40|$|A self report {{emotional}} manipulation {{scale was}} completed by 121 participants, who also completed a <b>tactics</b> <b>of</b> manipulation scale and a personality measure. A subset of the group (thirty three participants) also completed a re-test of the emotional manipulation scale. Factor analysis of the emotional manipulation scale suggested a one or three factor structure. Examination of the three factor structure showed that the original factor structure had not been replicated. Instead a one factor solution was decided upon; a general emotional manipulation factor. Factor analysis <b>of</b> the <b>tactics</b> <b>of</b> manipulation scale suggested that three <b>of</b> the six <b>tactics</b> <b>of</b> manipulation proposed by Buss, Gomes, Higgins & Lauterbach (1987) had been replicated. Correlations between the general emotional manipulation factor and the original six <b>tactics</b> <b>of</b> manipulation found significant correlations with all <b>of</b> the <b>tactics</b> <b>of</b> manipulation with the exception <b>of</b> the reason <b>tactic.</b> These results show the general emotional manipulation factor has adequate reliability. Correlations between the first testing of the emotional manipulation scale and the re-test {{were found to be}} significant, suggesting good reliability. It was found that both the emotional manipulation scale and the general emotional manipulation factor had strong correlations between the first testing and re-test; this suggests that the emotional manipulation scale and general emotional manipulation factor have strong reliability. Personality traits were found to correlate with both emotional manipulation and <b>tactics</b> <b>of</b> manipulation. Surprisingly, Neuroticism did not correlate with any of the manipulation scale, this goes against previous findings. The emotional manipulation scale was found to correlate positively with Conscientiousness and negatively with Openness. Agreeableness was the one personality trait that correlated significantly with the <b>tactics</b> <b>of</b> manipulation in the current study and with the findings in previous studies by Buss (1987, 1992). Agreeableness was found to correlate negatively with coercion and silent treatment and positively with reason. This was replicated in the current study. Additional testing found a number of significant gender differences in the use <b>of</b> emotional manipulation, <b>tactics</b> <b>of</b> manipulation and personality traits. Significant gender differences were found for <b>tactics</b> <b>of</b> manipulation and personality traits. Females scored significantly higher on the emotional manipulation factor and for three <b>of</b> the six <b>tactics</b> <b>of</b> manipulation. Males were found to score significantly higher on the coercion tactic alone. Males scored lower on Agreeableness, which correlates with Austin et al (2007) findings. However, they also scored lower on Neuroticism. Overall, the results indicated that the factor structure of the emotional manipulation scale is unclear and requires further research; however the validity and reliability of the general emotional manipulation factor and emotional manipulation scale seem more secure...|$|R
