40|$|The paper {{analyzes}} an endogenous mechanism leading perfectly symmetric economies to diverge in {{the long}} run after unifying their financial asset markets. The standard OLG growth model is extended to include uncertainty and a financial asset used to <b>transfer</b> ownership <b>of</b> the <b>proceeds</b> <b>of</b> an exogenous random production process between generations. Consumers are risk averse, implying that consumers hold mixed portfolios of real capital and of the asset which are not perfect substitutes. The paper demonstrates that {{in the absence of an}} international asset market, the two autarkic economies converge to the same globally attracting steady state under rational expectations dynamics. However, when the two asset markets are unified internationally prior to convergence, additional asymmetric steady states appear implying that the steady state with equal levels of capital becomes unstable, causing symmetry breaking. As a result, depending on the distribution of capital at the time of integration, perfectly symmetric economies in a completely symmetric world can converge to an asymmetric steady state. The paper derives general sufficient conditions for a saddle node bifurcation of the symmetric steady state. These reveal that the instability of the symmetric steady state occurs due to a non linear interaction of the elasticities in production and in asset demand. A numerical example shows that these effects occur in particular, when the production function and the function of absolute risk aversion are isoelastic...|$|R

When CO 2 injection at a storage site has ceased, the storage site is described in the EU CO 2 Storage Directive as being closed and the project life cycle enters the post-closure phase, leading to <b>transfer</b> <b>of</b> responsibility. During the post-closure phase the wells will not necessarily be sealed immediately, the site will continue to be monitored and reservoir management will continue, in accordance with the project risk assessment and management plan, which will have been updated at site closure. The main purpose of reservoir management in the post-closure phase is to demonstrate that the key regulatory requirements for <b>transfer</b> <b>of</b> storage site liability to the Competent Authority have been met. In the EU CO 2 Storage Directive these are: • Observed behaviour of the injected CO 2 conforms to the modelled behaviour • No detectable leakage • The storage site is evolving towards a situation of long-term stability Meeting these criteria involves demonstrating understanding of reservoir processes, the ability to make robust predictions of future behaviour and providing assurance against leakage. Demonstrating conformance between predictive models of reservoir performance and monitoring observations is technically challenging because a unique and perfect match is near-impossible to achieve. CO 2 CARE recommends that conformance is based on demonstrating that predictive modelling capability increases systematically with time as monitoring data is progressively acquired. This indicates that storage processes are well understood and the modelling approach is robust. If predictive modelling is robust, uncertainties will progressively reduce as more monitoring data is acquired through time. Nevertheless it is necessary to maintain a sufficiently wide range of predictive scenarios, such that any reasonable outcome will fall within it...|$|R

Phospholipid-derived fatty acid (PLFA) and ribosomal ribonucleic acid (rRNA) {{were used to}} identify the responsible members of the microbial community at class and family phylogenetic resolution. Diatoms were the predominant primary producers, and Gammaproteobacteria, Bacteroidetes, and Deltaproteobacteria (21 %, 8 %, and 7 % of 16 S rRNA-derived clone library) were major heterotrophic bacterial groups. Both 13 C-PLFA and 13 C-rRNA data suggest a fast <b>transfer</b> <b>of</b> label from diatoms (60 nmol 13 C g− 1 dry weight [dry wt]) to bacteria (7 nmol 13 C g− 1 dry wt) during the first 24 h, which was {{probably due to the}} exudation of low-molecular-weight organic compounds by diatoms that could be directly utilized by bacteria.

Water-extractable EPS (primarily as glucose) was a major intermediate and its turnover explained 75 % of the total carbohydrate processing in the sediment.
