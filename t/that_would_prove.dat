5|$|Federer's {{success in}} 2008 was {{severely}} hampered by a lingering bout of mononucleosis, which {{he suffered from}} {{during the first half}} of the year. At the end of the year, he would suffer a back injury <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>prove</b> to be recurring throughout his career.|$|E
5|$|Needled by {{repeated}} {{attacks from}} The Morning Chronicle on his supposed indecency, poor taste {{and lack of}} creativity, Etty determined to produce a work <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>prove</b> his detractors wrong.

5|$|After {{finishing}} his schooling Kagame made two visits to Rwanda, in 1977 and 1978. He was initially hosted {{by family members}} of his former classmates, but upon arrival in Kigali he made contact with {{members of his own}} family. He kept a low profile on these visits, believing that his status as a well-connected Tutsi exile could lead to arrest; on his second visit he entered the country through Zaire rather than Uganda to avoid suspicion. Kagame used his time in Rwanda to explore the country, familiarise himself with the political and social situation, and make connections <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>prove</b> useful to him in his later activities.|$|E

5|$|His final {{international}} commission {{took place}} late in 1343, when he accompanied Henry of Grosmont, Earl of Derby, on a diplomatic mission to Castile. Early in 1344 {{he was back}} in England, where he took part in a great tournament at Windsor. It was during this tournament, according to the chronicler Adam Murimuth, that he received wounds <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>prove</b> fatal. Salisbury died on 30 January 1344. He was buried at Bisham Priory in Berkshire, adjoining his home, Bisham Manor. He had founded the priory himself in 1337, on his elevation to the earldom. King Edward's financial obligations were never paid in full during the earl's lifetime, and at Salisbury' death the king owed him £11,720. Of this, some £6374 were written off by his executors in 1346.|$|E
5|$|Thom {{was born}} in Minonk, Illinois in 1872, the fifth of six boys. His parents were Angus Sutherland Thom and Louisa (Herick) Thom, Scottish/Irish farmers who had settled in Illinois shortly before the American Civil War. Charles Thom {{was raised in a}} {{strongly}} religious household; his father was an elder in the Presbyterian church. Thom upheld Presbyterian values throughout his life, kept active in church affairs, and became a staunch prohibitionist. His early years spent working on his father's farm instilled the value of a strong work ethic, and first-hand knowledge of agricultural practices <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>prove</b> useful in his later career.|$|E
5|$|After the war, Thornton {{performed}} occupation duties with Jayforce, in Japan, {{where he}} was the Senior British Liaison Officer in the Tokyo sub-area. He returned to New Zealand in July 1946 to serve as a staff officer at Army Headquarters. In 1948 he commenced a two-year term as Deputy Chief of Staff and during this time he worked towards the implementation of a compulsory military training scheme for the Territorial Force, which commenced in May 1950. He was dispatched to England in 1952 to attend the Imperial Defence College after which he led the New Zealand Joint Services Liaison Staff in London. During this time, in which New Zealand's military affairs were dominated by the country's involvement in the Korean War, Thornton began to demonstrate the diplomatic skills <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>prove</b> useful during his later career.|$|E

5|$|The Venetians {{were indeed}} {{fooled by the}} Ottoman subterfuge and were taken by {{surprise}} at {{the arrival of the}} Ottoman fleet at Crete on 23 June 1645. Despite the efforts of the recently appointed provveditore generale, Andrea Corner, the Venetian defenses were still in a bad state. The island's fortifications were substantial, but they had been long neglected, and much effort was put into repairing them. Anxious about Ottoman preparations, the Republic reinforced Crete in late 1644 with 2,500 troops and provisions, and began arming its fleet, while assistance was promised in the event of war by the Pope and Tuscany. However, the local Greek population was not well-disposed towards the Venetians, something <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>prove</b> to be of critical importance. Not only were the Ottomans thus able to quickly establish control over the countryside, but in later years, when the Ottoman forces in the island were practically cut off from seaborne supplies, only the local produce, provided by the Greek population, sustained them.|$|E

25|$|Doosan {{incorporated}} the MAN D2848T engine into the K200 under a license-production deal and assimilated its technology using domestic components, a reverse-engineering experience <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>prove</b> {{instrumental in the}} development of its next IFV, the K21. S Dynamics was the licensee subcontractor for the Allison Transmission X200-5K gearbox. The vehicle entered production in 1985. Serial production was completed in 2006.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} Medieval era, a fluid pattern of union and {{division}} was observed {{among the states}} of Christian Iberia. While marriage of royals had resulted in the union {{of some of these}} states—for example between Navarre and Aragon, and Castile and León—subsequent divisions amongst heirs created a dynamic pattern of union and separation. However, the 12th century initiated a series of unions <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>prove</b> permanent.|$|E

With some design changes, deliveries of the Model 269A version began in 1961. By mid-1963 about 20 aircraft were being produced per month, and {{by the spring of}} 1964 314 had been built. Hughes had successfully captured {{a large portion of the}} civilian helicopter market with an aircraft <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>prove</b> itself popular in agriculture, police work and other duties.|$|E
25|$|SAD {{paramilitary}} {{teams were}} active in Afghanistan in the 1990s in clandestine operations to locate and kill or capture Osama Bin Laden. These teams planned several operations, but did not receive the order to execute from President Bill Clinton because the available intelligence did not guarantee a successful outcome weighed against the extraordinary risk to the SAD/SOG teams that would execute the mission. These efforts did however build many of the relationships <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>prove</b> essential in the 2001 U.S. Invasion of Afghanistan.|$|E
25|$|When Henry's sanity returned, {{the court}} party reasserted its authority. Richard of York and the Nevilles, who were related by {{marriage}} {{and had been}} alienated by Henry's support of the Percys, defeated them at a skirmish called the First Battle of St Albans. Possibly as few as 50 men were killed, but among them were Somerset and the two Percy lords, Henry Percy, 2nd Earl of Northumberland, and Thomas Clifford, 8th Baron de Clifford, creating feuds <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>prove</b> impossible to reconcile; reputedly Clifford's son would later murder Richard's son Edmund. The ruling class was deeply shocked and reconciliation was attempted.|$|E

25|$|With the $38 million {{deficit of}} the Astrodome, {{control of the}} Astrodomain was passed from Judge Roy Hofheinz to GE Credit and Ford Motor Credit. This {{included}} the Astros. The creditors were just interested in preserving asset value of the team, so any money spent had to be found or saved somewhere else. Tal Smith returned to the Astros from the New York Yankees to find a team that needed {{a lot of work}} and did not have a lot of money. However, there would be some bright spots <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>prove</b> to be good investments in the near future.|$|E
25|$|Military {{historian}} Richard Holmes {{remarked that}} Wellesley's experiences in India {{had an important}} influence on his personality and military tactics, teaching him much about military matters <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>prove</b> vital to his success in the Peninsular War. These included {{a strong sense of}} discipline through drill and order, the use of diplomacy to gain allies, and the vital necessity for a secure supply line. He also established a high regard for the acquisition of intelligence through scouts and spies. His personal tastes also developed, including dressing himself in white trousers, a dark tunic, with Hessian boots and black cocked hat (that later became synonymous as his style).|$|E
25|$|McAleese's initial {{seven-year term}} of office ended in November 2004, but she had {{announced}} on 14 September that she would stand {{for a second term}} in the 2004 presidential election. Following the failure of any other candidate to secure the necessary support for nomination, the incumbent president stood unopposed, with no political party affiliation, and was declared elected on 1 October. She was re-inaugurated at the commencement of her second seven-year term on 11 November. McAleese's very high approval ratings were widely seen as the reason for her re-election, with no opposition party willing to bear the cost (financial or political) of competing in an election <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>prove</b> difficult to win.|$|E
