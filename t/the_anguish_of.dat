After Bhuvan reassures Gauri of his feelings for her, the woodcutter Lakha (Yashpal Sharma) becomes enraged as he is in love with Gauri.|$|E

25|$|Along these lines, {{the concept}} of Reward and Punishment in the World to Come was {{abolished}} as well.

Angels and Heavenly Hosts were also deemed a foreign superstitious influence, especially from early Zoroastrian sources, and denied.|$|E

500|$|While {{walking through}} an airport, vocalist Tom Araya {{picked up a}} March 2006 issue of Texas Monthly with a soldier's helmet on the front cover. Seeing the article [...] "Casualty of War", he was {{interested}} enough to purchase a copy. The issue explored the involvement of military personnel from Texas in the Iraq War, and included a list of Texan soldiers {{who had died in}} the conflict. The feature was accompanied by photographs of some of the dead, while a further article dealt with <b>the</b> <b>anguish</b> <b>of</b> surviving soldiers on their return home. Araya later said that the article [...] "blew his mind".|$|E

500|$|The film's use of clownfish {{prompted}} mass {{purchase of}} the fish breed as pets in the United States, even though the story portrayed the use of fish as pets negatively and suggested that saltwater aquariums are notably tricky and expensive to maintain. The demand for clownfish was supplied by large-scale harvesting of tropical fish in regions like Vanuatu. The Australian Tourism Commission (ATC) launched several marketing campaigns in China and the United States to improve tourism in Australia, many of them utilizing Finding Nemo clips. Queensland used Finding Nemo to draw tourists to promote its state for vacationers. According to National Geographic, [...] "Ironically, Finding Nemo, a movie about <b>the</b> <b>anguish</b> <b>of</b> a captured clownfish, caused home-aquarium demand for them to triple." ...|$|E

500|$|Despite his ongoing health {{problems}} and several operations for ulcers and hernias, Cooper continued to work in action films. In 1958, he appeared in Anthony Mann's Western drama Man of the West (1958) with Julie London and Lee J. Cobb, about a reformed outlaw and killer who is forced to confront his violent past when the train he is riding in is held up by his former gang members. The film has been called Cooper's [...] "most pathological Western", with its themes of impotent rage, sexual humiliation, and sadism. According to biographer Jeffrey Meyers, Cooper, who struggled with moral conflicts in his personal life, [...] "understood <b>the</b> <b>anguish</b> <b>of</b> a character striving to retain his integrity ... brought authentic feeling {{to the role of}} a tempted and tormented, yet essentially decent man". Mostly ignored by critics at the time, the film is now well-regarded by film scholars and is considered Cooper's last great film.|$|E
500|$|The {{concept of}} a lesbian {{identity}} is also explored throughout Journey to a Woman, as Beth leaves her husband and children to find Laura. Beth is followed by Vega, a woman scarred deeply—both emotionally and physically—with whom Beth had an affair. Vega shoots herself {{at the end of}} the story. Scholar Christopher Nealon suggests that Vega's scars and emotional pain represent <b>the</b> <b>anguish</b> <b>of</b> self-hatred and the self-destructive phases Bannon imposed upon her characters in Women in the Shadows. Because Laura has grown from the complete adoration of Beth in Odd Girl Out and is unable to give Beth the same devotion when Beth finds her again, Nealon writes that Bannon makes the point that it is impossible to sustain [...] "a lesbian identity that always returns to the moment of self-discovery". Beth, instead, finds Beebo, now older and much calmer, who gives her hope and the promise of love, which Nealon equates to a final identity for Bannon's characters.|$|E
500|$|The {{movement}} is structured like a prelude and fugue, the prelude covering {{the beginning of}} the biblical verse, the fugue <b>the</b> <b>anguish</b> <b>of</b> the Lord's wrath. The [...] "prelude" [...] begins with 16 measures of instrumental music, with the strings [...] "engaged in a persistent sobbing commentary", as John Eliot Gardiner puts it, who conducted the Bach Cantata Pilgrimage in 2000 and performed this cantata in the Brunswick Cathedral. In the second round of vocal entries, each part is intensified by a wind instruments. The musicologist Julian Mincham notes about Bach's different ways to convey the distress of the text: [...] "There is frequent stressing of the word [...] "Schmerz" [...] (sorrow). Suspensions and dissonant seventh chords in the harmony add to the tension as do the uses of the highly expressive Neapolitan chord and false relations". The fugue, marked [...] "Un poco allegro", covers {{the second part of the}} verse, translating to [...] "For the Lord has made me full of anguish on the day of his wrathful anger." [...] The fugue builds from two vocal parts and continuo to nine parts. Gardiner writes: [...] "It is uncompromising in its contrapuntal wildness and grim, dissonant harmony." ...|$|E

500|$|As {{they grew}} older Madonna {{and her sisters}} would feel deep sadness as the vivid memory of their mother began {{drifting}} farther from them. They would study pictures of her and come {{to think that she}} resembled poet Anne Sexton and Hollywood actresses. This would later raise Madonna's interest in poetry, with Sylvia Plath being her favourite. Later, Madonna commented: [...] "We were all wounded {{in one way or another}} by , and then we spent the rest of our lives reacting to it or dealing with it or trying to turn into something else. <b>The</b> <b>anguish</b> <b>of</b> losing my mom left me with a certain kind of loneliness and an incredible longing for something. If I hadn't had that emptiness, I wouldn't have been so driven. Her death had a lot to do with me saying—after I got over my heartache—I'm going to be really strong if I can't have my mother. I'm going to take care of myself." [...] Taraborrelli felt that in time, no doubt because of the devastation she felt, Madonna would never again allow herself, or even her daughter, to feel as abandoned as she had felt when her mother died. [...] "Her death had taught [...] a valuable lesson, that she would have to remain strong for herself because, she feared weakness—particularly her own—and wanted to be the queen of her own castle." ...|$|E
