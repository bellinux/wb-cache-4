5|$|Looking {{directly}} at the photosphere of the Sun (the bright disk of the Sun itself), even {{for just a few}} seconds, can cause permanent damage to <b>the</b> <b>retina</b> of the eye, because of the intense visible and invisible radiation that the photosphere emits. This damage can result in impairment of vision, up to and including blindness. <b>The</b> <b>retina</b> has no sensitivity to pain, and the effects of retinal damage may not appear for hours, so there is no warning that injury is occurring.|$|E
5|$|Other {{differences}} between the principal and secondary eyes are that the latter have rhabdomeres that point away from incoming light, just like in vertebrates, while the arrangement is the opposite in the former. The principal eyes are also the only ones with eye muscles, allowing them to move <b>the</b> <b>retina.</b> Having no muscles, the secondary eyes are immobile.|$|E
5|$|Prolonged {{exposure}} to high inspired fractions of oxygen causes damage to <b>the</b> <b>retina.</b> Damage {{to the developing}} eye of infants exposed to high oxygen fraction at normal pressure has a different mechanism and effect from the eye damage experienced by adult divers under hyperbaric conditions. Hyperoxia may be a contributing factor for the disorder called retrolental fibroplasia or retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) in infants. In preterm infants, <b>the</b> <b>retina</b> is often not fully vascularised. Retinopathy of prematurity occurs {{when the development of}} the retinal vasculature is arrested and then proceeds abnormally. Associated with the growth of these new vessels is fibrous tissue (scar tissue) that may contract to cause retinal detachment. Supplemental oxygen exposure, while a risk factor, is not the main risk factor for development of this disease. Restricting supplemental oxygen use does not necessarily reduce the rate of retinopathy of prematurity, and may raise the risk of hypoxia-related systemic complications.|$|E

40|$|A marked {{interspecific}} {{variability in}} {{the role played by}} the pineal and <b>the</b> <b>retinae</b> characterizes <b>the</b> circadian system of lizards. I examined the role played by these structures in a new model species, the ruin lizard, Podarcis sicula. In constant temperature and darkness pinealectomy as well as bilateral removal of <b>the</b> <b>retinae</b> produced significant changes (both lengthening and shortening) in the freerunning period of locomotor rhythms. Circadian activity time was also affected by pinealectomy. Circadian locomotor rhythmicity persisted in all cases even when both operations were combined in the same individuals. This demonstrates in Podarcis sicula the existence of an oscillatory system outside the pineal and <b>the</b> <b>retinae</b> which can drive locomotor rhythms. The period changes recorded after pinealectomy as well as after bilateral removal of <b>the</b> <b>retinae</b> specifically suggest that both the pineal and <b>the</b> <b>retinae</b> play a modulating role on circadian oscillators located elsewhere in the system, with the final effect of stabilizing the overt rhythms...|$|R

5|$|The {{cerebrum}} has a contralateral organisation {{with each}} hemisphere {{of the brain}} interacting primarily with {{one half of the}} body: {{the left side of the}} brain interacts with the right side of the body, and vice versa. The developmental cause for this is uncertain. Motor connections from the brain to the spinal cord, and sensory connections from the spinal cord to the brain, both cross sides in the brainstem. Visual input follows a more complex rule: the optic nerves from the two eyes come together at a point called the optic chiasm, and half of the fibres from each nerve split off to join the other. The result is that connections from the left half of <b>the</b> <b>retina,</b> in both eyes, go to the left side of the brain, whereas connections from the right half of <b>the</b> <b>retina</b> go to the right side of the brain. Because each half of <b>the</b> <b>retina</b> receives light coming from the opposite half of the visual field, the functional consequence is that visual input from the left side of the world goes to the right side of the brain, and vice versa. Thus, the right side of the brain receives somatosensory input from the left side of the body, and visual input from the left side of the visual field.|$|E
5|$|The eyes {{can focus}} independently, and are {{specialized}} with a duplex retina that contains {{two types of}} visual cells for both day and night vision, and a tapetum lucidum which reflects onto <b>the</b> <b>retina</b> to enhance vision in the dark.

5|$|Vision is {{generated}} by light that hits <b>the</b> <b>retina</b> of the eye.

Vision from the left visual field is received {{on the right side of}} each retina (and vice versa) and passes through the optic nerve until some information changes sides, so that all information about one side of the visual field passes through tracts in the opposite side of the brain. The nerves reach the brain at the lateral geniculate nucleus, and travel through the optic radiation to reach the visual cortex.|$|E

40|$|To {{obtain a}} {{fundamental}} knowlege {{of the vision}} of tunas and marlins the brains were observed morphologically, and <b>the</b> <b>retinae</b> were examined histologically and electrophysiologically. Tunas and marlins have an extremely well developed optic tectum indicating that vision {{is very important to}} them. The S-potentials recorded from <b>the</b> <b>retinae</b> showed that tunas and marlins are probably color-blind. <b>The</b> <b>retinae</b> has cones (predominantly twin cones) in parallel arrangement, 3 layers of horizontal cells, no fovea nor well-developed area. Dense retinal tapetum was found in the bigeye tuna. Visual acuity determined from cone density ranged from 0. 3 to 0. 5, which is the highest among fishes. It is believed that <b>the</b> <b>retinae</b> of these fishes are advantageous for movement perception, and that their eyes are well adapted to the low light levels in the lower limits of their vertical distribution (ca. 500 m).

40|$|Honeybees have {{a visual}} system {{composed}} of three ocelli (simple eyes) {{located on the}} top of the head, in addition to two large compound eyes. Although experiments have been conducted to investigate the role of the ocelli within the visual system, their optical characteristics, and function remain controversial. In this study, we created three-dimensional (3 -D) reconstructions of the honeybee ocelli, conducted optical measurements and filled ocellar descending neurons to assist in determining the role of ocelli in honeybees. In both the median and lateral ocelli, <b>the</b> ocellar <b>retinas</b> can be divided into dorsal and ventral parts. Using the 3 -D model we were able to assess the viewing angles of <b>the</b> <b>retinas.</b> <b>The</b> dorsal <b>retinas</b> view <b>the</b> horizon while <b>the</b> ventral <b>retinas</b> view <b>the</b> sky, suggesting quite different roles in attitude control.

5|$|Damage to {{the optic}} nerve (II) affects {{specific}} aspects of vision that depend on {{the location of the}} lesion. A person {{may not be able to}} see objects on their left or right sides (homonymous hemianopsia), or may have difficulty seeing objects on their outer visual fields (bitemporal hemianopsia) if the optic chiasm is involved. Vision may be tested by examining the visual field, or by examining <b>the</b> <b>retina</b> with an ophthalmoscope, using a process known as funduscopy.

5|$|Dolphins have sharp eyesight.

When under water, the eyeball's lens serves to focus light, whereas in the in-air environment, the typically bright light serves to contract the specialized pupil, resulting in sharpness from a smaller aperture (similar to a pinhole camera).|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Diabetic {{retinopathy}} is {{a severe}} microvascular complication amongst patients with diabetes, {{and is the}} primary cause of visual loss through neovascularization. Betaine is one of the components of Fructus Lycii. In the present study, the effects of betaine on the expression levels of vascular endo-thelial growth factor (VEGF) and hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) - 1 α in association with the Akt pathway were investi-gated in <b>the</b> <b>retinas</b> of streptozotocin (STZ) -induced diabetic rats using western blot and immunohistochemical analyses.

5|$|The {{brightness}} of the Sun can cause pain from looking at it with the naked eye; however, doing so for brief periods is not hazardous for normal non-dilated eyes. Looking directly at the Sun causes phosphene visual artifacts and temporary partial blindness. It also delivers about 4milliwatts of sunlight to <b>the</b> <b>retina,</b> slightly heating it and potentially causing damage in eyes that cannot respond properly to the brightness. UV exposure gradually yellows {{the lens of the}} eye over a period of years, and is thought to contribute to the formation of cataracts, but this depends on general exposure to solar UV, and not whether one looks directly at the Sun. Long-duration viewing of the direct Sun with the naked eye can begin to cause UV-induced, sunburn-like lesions on <b>the</b> <b>retina</b> after about 100 seconds, particularly under conditions where the UV light from the Sun is intense and well focused; conditions are worsened by young eyes or new lens implants (which admit more UV than aging natural eyes), Sun angles near the zenith, and observing locations at high altitude.|$|E
5|$|The eyes of baleen {{whales are}} {{relatively}} small for their size and are positioned {{near the end of}} the mouth. This is probably because they feed on slow or immobile prey, combined with the fact that most sunlight does not pass , and hence they do not need acute vision. A whale's eye is adapted for seeing both in the euphotic and aphotic zones by increasing or decreasing the pupil's size to prevent damage to the eye. As opposed to land mammals which have a flattened lens, whales have a spherical lens. <b>The</b> <b>retina</b> is surrounded by a reflective layer of cells (tapetum lucidum), which bounces light back at <b>the</b> <b>retina,</b> enhancing eyesight in dark areas. However, light is bent more near the surface of the eye when in air as opposed to water; consequently, they can see much better in the air than in the water. The eyeballs are protected by a thick outer layer to prevent abrasions, and an oily fluid (instead of tears) on the surface of the eye. Baleen whales appear to have limited color vision, as they lack S-cones.|$|E
