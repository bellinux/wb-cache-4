40|$|In {{order to}} develop an {{experimental}} technique to directly monitor the dynamics of activated sludge {{it is necessary to}} analyse some parameters that can influence the flocculation process and to find better experimental condition. The effect of sludge concentration, sonication, mixing and of some setup components (i. e. tubes length, <b>T-part)</b> was monitored during on-line floc size distribution measurements. It was observed that the sludge concentration and floc size distribution are interrelated. Moreover, it is demonstrated that sonication inside relatively large sludge volume (2 L) does not create a significant disrupting effect. Related to the setup components it was found that by using long tubes in-line flocculation occurred and <b>T-part</b> does not have an important influence on particle size distribution...|$|E

We prove in this paper that the <b>T-part</b> (A') ^-(T) = { 1 } for CM extensions K/Q. This fact has been conjectured for arbitrary fields K by Kuz'min in 1972 and was proved by Greenberg in 1973, for abelian extensions K/Q. Federer and Gross had shown in 1981 that (A') ^-(T) = { 1 } {{is equivalent to the}} non-vanishing of the p-adic regulator of the p-units of K.

40|$|For the two {{versions}} of the KdV equation on the positive half-line an initial-boundary value problem is well posed if one prescribes an initial condition plus either one boundary condition if q_t and q_xxx have the same sign (KdVI) or two boundary conditions if q_t and q_xxx have opposite sign (KdVII). Constructing the generalized Dirichlet to Neumann map for the above problems means characterizing the unknown boundary values in terms of the given initial and boundary conditions. For example, if {q(x, 0),q(0,t) } and {q(x, 0),q(0,t),q_x(0,t) } are given for the KdVI and KdVII equations, respectively, then one must construct the unknown boundary values {q_x(0,t),q_xx(0,t) } and {q_xx(0,t) }, respectively. We show that this can be achieved without solving for q(x,t) by analysing a certain "global relation" which couples the given initial and boundary conditions with the unknown boundary values, {{as well as with the}} function Φ^(t) (t,k), where Φ^(t) satisifies the <b>t-part</b> of the associated Lax pair evaluated at x= 0. Indeed, by employing a Gelfand [...] Levitan [...] Marchenko triangular representation for Φ^(t), the global relation can be solved explicitly for the unknown boundary values in terms of the given initial and boundary conditions and the function Φ^(t). This yields the unknown boundary values in terms of a nonlinear Volterra integral equation. Comment: 21 pages, 3 figure...|$|E

A (v, k, λ) -Mendelsohn design (briefly (v, k, λ) -MD) {{is a pair}} (X,B) where X is a v-set (of points) andBis a collection of cyclically ordered k-subsets of X (called blocks) such that every ordered pair of points of X are consecutive in exactly λ blocks of B. A set of k distinct elements {a 1, a 2, [...] ., ak} {{is said to be}} cyclically ordered by a 1 <a 2 < [...] . <ak<a 1 and the pair ai, ai+t are said to be <b>t-part</b> in a cyclic k-tuple (a 1, a 2, [...] ., ak) where i + t is taken modulo k. If for allt = 1, 2, [...] .,k − 1, every ordered pair of points of X are t-apart in exactly λ blocks of B, then the (v, k, λ) -MD is called perfect and is denoted briefly by (v, k, λ) -PMD. A necessary condition for the existence of a (v, k, λ) -PMD is λv(v− 1) ≡ 0 (mod k). In this paper, we shall be concerned mostly with the case k = 7 and λ even. It will be shown that the necessary condition for the existence of a v, 7, λ) -PMD, namely λv(v− 1) ≡ 0 (mod 7), is also sufficient for all even λ ⪖ 16, with at most 29 possible exceptions for the pair (v, λ) where λ is even and λ < 16. In the process, we shall also establish that the necessary condition v≡ 0 or 1 (mod 7) for the existence of a (v, 7, 1) -PMD is also sufficient for all v ⪖ 421 with at most 40 possible exceptions below this value, which improves the earlier results...|$|E
40|$|Background: Distal radius {{fractures}} are {{the most}} common fractures of the human skeleton, with about ten per cent of the population sustaining a fracture {{at some point in their}} life. The traditional treatment of distal radius fractures was either non-operative, with closed reduction and cast immobilisation, or operative. Operative treatment options are open reduction and internal fixation or closed reduction and fixation with K-wires and/or an external fixator or cast. Until the late 1990 s, open reduction and plate fixation was not a popular treatment option as plates inserted from the dorsal side frequently caused soft tissue complications and plates inserted from the volar side needed additional augmentation as a result of the biomechanical specifics of distal radius fractures. However, with the development of volar locking distal radius plates in 1997, considerable scientific, clinical and commercial interest in the treatment of distal radius fractures by open reduction and plate fixation has developed. The plates do have theoretical advances over other means of fixation as they allow early functional postoperative mobilisation, which might lead to faster recovery, which in turn might allow more expeditious return to work and/or to activities of daily life. I was fortunate to be part of the team that invented and implanted the first volar locking distal radius plate internationally; hence my interest in the treatment of distal radius fractures. Overall aim of the studies presented in this thesis: Primary aims (biomechanical) : • to achieve a better understanding of the biomechanical properties of distal radius volar locking plates – especially in view of the fact that dozens of different plate models are available with considerable differences in design and locking mechanisms • to define optimal configuration, arrangement, placement and numbers of screws in volar locking plates • to compare different plate systems in order to gain insight into the potential clinical behaviour of different locking mechanisms Secondary aims (clinical) : The second aim of this thesis was to evaluate locking distal radius plates in various clinical studies (using real patients) in order to gain insight into the question of whether their outcome and complication rates are comparable to other methods of treatment. Methods: The thesis comprises the result of eight biomechanical and clinical studies, which took place in Austria and Australia. The basis, foundation and initial study of this thesis is a retrospective clinical study conducted in Austria and presents the first international two-year results of experiences with volar locking distal radius plates. Based on this study seven biomechanical studies were performed. These studies tested various platescrew configurations and plate positions of volar locking distal radius plates in order to establish optimal screw number and diameter as well as position of the plate-screw construct relative to the radio-carpal joint line. The testing was performed partly with fresh-frozen cadaver wrists and partly with synthetic radii. The thesis further comprises the results of another clinical prospective multi-centre study relating to distal radial fracture management to which I contributed, being the principal investigator of Neunkirchen General Hospital, Austria. Overall results and conclusions of the studies presented in this thesis: Biomechanical studies: In order to achieve reproducible outcomes and minimise the loss of postoperative displacement, placement of the plate-screw construct as close as possible to the radio-carpal joint line is essential. Postoperative loss of reduction is directly proportional to the distance the distal screws are placed from the joint line. Despite the push for, and marketing of, multi-row implants with six to eight screws and up to three distal screw-rows in the <b>T-part</b> of the volar locking plates, biomechanical data do not show any benefit over implants incorporating a single distal screw row only. The overall diameter of the screws rather than the number seems to be the determining factor in terms of resistance to postoperative displacement. Constructs with threaded screws show significantly higher stability and rigidity than constructs with smooth pegs. Inserting an additional proximal screw close to the fracture line further increases stability. Clinical studies: Treatment of distal radius fractures with volar locking plates allows early postoperative mobilisation with good reproducible radiographic and clinical results, with a limited number of complications. Clinical function and outcome do not appear to be associated with repair of a fracture of the base of the ulnar styloid. The treatment of distal radius fractures with volar locking plates is the only treatment currently available that allows immediate postoperative wrist motion without the need for additional fixation in most cases. There is, however, a need for prospective, randomised, controlled studies to establish whether treatment with volar locking distal radius plates is shown to be more beneficial than conventional treatment methods with regard to earlier return to function and activities of daily life in the short as well as in the long term. While there is a trend towards better outcomes, there is currently no evidence to show a clear advantage of volar locking plates over any other accepted form of treatment. Overall relevance of the studies presented in this thesis: Biomechanical Studies: The recommendations of one of my biomechanical studies was to place the distal locking screws as close as possible to the joint line to prevent postoperative loss of reduction. This has been accepted internationally as the clinical gold standard. Furthermore, I have shown that plates which incorporate more than one distal screw row do not have any biomechanical advantage over plates with a single distal screw row. Plate-screw constructs in which the distal screw row has an overall diameter of less than 12 millimetres display significantly less resistance to postoperative loss of reduction, which has implications for postoperative mobilisation protocols. Threaded locking screws are preferable to smooth locking pegs as they show significantly more resistance to postoperative displacement forces. In certain fracture types it might be beneficial to place a screw close to the fracture in the shaft part of the plate as this has been shown in biomechanical studies to cause less permanent deformation. However the clinical relevance of this finding still needs to be investigated. Clinical Studies: The clinical studies presented in this thesis concluded that open reduction and internal fixation with volar locking plates produces good to excellent results in the majority of patients. The results are independent of the fracture severity, which means that meticulous technique, rather than fracture comminution or bone quality, is necessary to achieve good clinical results. The most pronounced improvements in function and pain are seen within the first twelve months. Furthermore, improved locking mechanisms, smooth titanium coating of the plates and rounded screw heads have shown a significant decrease in the number of tendon and soft tissue complications seen with first generation plates. It has also been shown that associated ulnar styloid fractures do not need to be repaired when stabilising distal radius fractures with volar locking plates...|$|E
