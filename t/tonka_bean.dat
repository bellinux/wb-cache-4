5000|$|There {{have been}} calls for {{removing}} {{the restrictions on}} the use of <b>tonka</b> <b>beans</b> in food in the United States.

5000|$|Dipteryx odorata (commonly {{known as}} [...] "cumaru" [...] or [...] "kumaru") is {{a species of}} {{flowering}} tree in the pea family, Fabaceae. The tree is native to Central America and northern South America. Its seeds are known as <b>tonka</b> <b>beans</b> (sometimes tonkin beans or tonquin beans). They are black and wrinkled and have a smooth, brown interior. They have a strong fragrance similar to sweet woodruff (Galium odoratum) due to their high content of coumarin.|$|R
500|$|Warfarin is a {{derivative}} of dicoumarol, an anticoagulant originally discovered in spoiled sweet clover. Dicoumarol, in turn, is from coumarin, a sweet-smelling but coagulation-inactive chemical found in [...] "sweet" [...] clover and <b>tonka</b> <b>beans</b> (also known as cumaru from which coumarin's name derives). The name warfarin stems from its discovery at the University of Wisconsin, incorporating the acronym {{for the organization}} that funded the key research, WARF for the Wisconsin Alumni Research Foundation and the ending -arin, indicating its link with coumarin.|$|R
5000|$|Coumarin {{was first}} {{isolated}} from <b>Tonka</b> <b>beans</b> and sweet clover in 1820 by A. Vogel of Munich, who initially mistook it for benzoic acid. Also in 1820, Nicholas Jean Baptiste Gaston Guibourt (1790-1867) of France independently isolated coumarin, but {{he realized that}} it was not benzoic acid. [...] In a subsequent essay he presented to the pharmacy section of the Académie Royale de Médecine, Guibourt named the new substance [...] "coumarine". In 1835, the French pharmacist A. Guillemette proved that Vogel and Guibourt had isolated the same substance. [...] Coumarin was first synthesized in 1868 by the English chemist William Henry Perkin.|$|R

500|$|The [...] "culinary jewel" [...] of the Augustus Tower is the Restaurant Guy Savoy, namesake of the three-star Michelin chef, whose {{restaurant}} in Paris has been ranked {{as one of}} the finest dining establishments in the world. When Savoy was approached to open a second {{restaurant in}} Vegas, he initially said no, until Caesars told him they wanted him to recreate what he had done in Paris with the same ambiance, quality and cuisine. His request was that to maintain quality, the restaurant must be limited to service five days a week, to which the management agreed. The restaurant opened in 2006 and in 2008, Savoy brought his executive chef from the Paris restaurant to Vegas. The establishment is managed by Savoy's son, Franck Savoy. The menu features signature dishes including artichoke and black truffle soup; buttered, roasted veal sweetbreads; crispy sea bass; and pan-seared quail, as main courses and dessert of chocolate ganache served with <b>tonka</b> <b>beans.</b> The wine cellar features 15,000 bottles from which to select and it is the only Champagne Krug Chef's Table restaurant in the United States.|$|R
5000|$|Today, {{the main}} {{producers}} of <b>tonka</b> <b>beans</b> are Venezuela and Nigeria. The cumaru tree is an emergent plant, and a light-demanding calcifuge tree which grows on poor, well drained soils. The best growth is reached on fertile soils rich in humus. In the native region {{there is a}} mean annual temperature of 25 °C and about 2000 mm rainfall per year with a dry season from June to November. In general, {{it has a very}} low plant density, but depending on the agricultural use, the density and the age of the trees diversify. In seed production systems, the plant density is higher and the trees are older than in timber production systems.The tree flowers from March to May, and the fruits ripen from June to July. So, the fresh fruits are picked up in June and July, and fallen pods are harvested from January to March [...] or sometimes earlier. The hard outer shell is removed and the beans are spread out for 2-3 days to dry, after which they can be sold. The major producer is Venezuela, followed by Brazil and Colombia. The most important importing country is the United States, where it is used especially in the tobacco industry.|$|R
40|$|Coumarin is a {{naturally}} occurring flavouring substance which {{is contained in}} many plants (for example woodruff, sweet clover, <b>tonka</b> <b>beans).</b> Higher concentrations {{are to be found}} particularly in some types of cinnamon. Coumarin is used as a fragrance substance in cosmetics and is an active substance in medicinal products. For a few years cinnamon-containing food supplements have also been on sale which are said to reduce the blood sugar level and the blood lipid concentrations of diabetics. Because of the harmful effect of larger amounts – coumarin can cause hepatic damage – coumarin may only be used as an ingredient of flavourings and other food additives with flavouring properties in the food sector. What's more, it has long been known that in animal experiments coumarin can trigger the formation of tumours. More recent scientific findings indicate that there is no genotoxic mechanism of action, something which had been suspected for a long time. The European Commission thereupon submitted a draft amendment to the Flavourings Directive which envisages removing the existing constraints on coumarin. The Federal Institute for Risk Assessment (BfR) took another look at coumarin from the angle of consumer health protection. BfR is of the opinion that dietary coumarin intake should continue to be restricted. In order to avoid high coumarin exposure from direct consumption (e. g. rice pudding with cinnamon and sugar) statutory measures are also desirable...|$|R
50|$|Coumarin {{is derived}} from coumarou, the French word for the <b>tonka</b> <b>bean.</b> The word tonka for the <b>tonka</b> <b>bean</b> is taken from the Galibi (Carib) tongue spoken by natives of French Guiana (one source for the plant); it also appears in Old Tupi, another {{language}} of the same region, as {{the name of the}} tree. The old genus name, Coumarouna, was formed from another Tupi name for tree, kumarú.|$|E

5000|$|Mexican vanilla, {{made from}} the native V. planifolia, is {{produced}} in much less quantity and marketed as the vanilla {{from the land of}} its origin. Vanilla sold in tourist markets around Mexico is sometimes not actual vanilla extract, but is mixed with an extract of the <b>tonka</b> <b>bean,</b> which contains the toxin coumarin. <b>Tonka</b> <b>bean</b> extract smells and tastes like vanilla, but coumarin has been shown to cause liver damage in lab animals and has been banned in food in the US by the Food and Drug Administration since 1954.|$|E
50|$|<b>Tonka</b> <b>bean</b> oil is {{extracted}} from the seed of Dipteryx odorata. The oil is composed primarily of coumarin, {{which is used to}} flavor tobacco. It is neither a pressed oil, nor an essential oil, but was traditionally obtained by soaking the large, single <b>tonka</b> <b>bean</b> seed in rum or other alcohol for 24 hours, after which crystals of coumarin appear {{on the outside of the}} seed, and are then collected. The seeds contain up to 46% oil by dry weight. In recent years, most commercially produced coumarin are synthetic, which has reduced the demand for tonka beans as a crop. Coumarin derivatives are also used medicinally, as anti-coagulants.|$|E
