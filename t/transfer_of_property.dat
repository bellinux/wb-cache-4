25|$|The Ten Commandments {{were meant}} {{exclusively}} for Jewish males. Michael Coogan noticed {{that according to}} their text, the wives are the property of their man, marriage meaning <b>transfer</b> <b>of</b> <b>property</b> (from father to husband), and women are less valuable than real estate, being mentioned after real estate. Adultery is violating the property right of a man. Coogan's book was criticized by Phyllis Trible because of not noticing that patriarchy was not decreed, but only described by God, patriarchy being specific to people after the fall. She admits that Paul the Apostle made the same mistake as Coogan.|$|E
25|$|The {{next major}} reform was {{the loss of}} the {{conveyancing}} monopoly. Before 1983, only solicitors had been authorised to take part in conveyancing work—for anyone else to draft documents relating to the <b>transfer</b> <b>of</b> <b>property</b> was a statutory offence. In December 1983 Austin Mitchell, a Labour Member of Parliament who {{had been one of the}} initial supporters of Alf Dubs' private member's bill introduced a private member's bill of his own called the House Buyers Bill. This aimed to remove the restrictions on conveyancing, and although the government opposed it they made it clear that they planned to allow banks and building societies to carry out conveyancing for their customers, and would also be prepared to allow non-solicitors with suitable qualifications to carry out conveyancing work as well.|$|E

500|$|The {{seventh century}} saw the {{development}} of a powerful monastic movement in England, which was strongly influenced by the ideas of St Benedict, and the late seventh-century English scholar Aldhelm assumed that monasteries would normally follow the Benedictine rule. However, by 800, few foundations could claim high spiritual and intellectual standards, and the ninth century saw a sharp decline in learning and monasticism. Political and financial pressures, partly due to disruption caused by Viking attacks, led to an increasing preference for pastoral clergy over contemplative monks. There was a progressive <b>transfer</b> <b>of</b> <b>property</b> from the minsters to the crown, which accelerated after 850. According to John Blair: ...|$|E

2500|$|A further {{contentious}} aspect {{arises from}} an [...] "indemnity deal" [...] signed on 5 June 2002. This was between two {{representatives of the}} Conference of Religious of Ireland (Cori) (an umbrella group representing 138 religious congregations) on behalf of 18 religious Orders that had run the residential institutions, and the then Minister Michael Woods. This indemnified the Orders from legal action, whereby any costs would now be met by the Irish taxpayer, {{in return for a}} <b>transfer</b> <b>of</b> <b>property</b> and assets to the government worth €128 million. No representatives of the victims were involved in these negotiations. The original plan was to provide adequate funds for the Redress Board, but in the interim an unexpectedly large number of claimants has come forward.|$|E

2500|$|Ancient Irish {{culture was}} patriarchal. The Brehon law {{excepted}} {{women from the}} ordinary course of the law so that, in general, every woman {{had to have a}} male guardian. However, women had some legal capacity. By the 8th century, the preferred form of marriage was one between social equals, under which a woman was technically legally dependent on her husband and had half his honor price, but could exercise considerable authority in regard to the <b>transfer</b> <b>of</b> <b>property.</b> Such women were called [...] "women of joint dominion". Thus historian Patrick Weston Joyce could write that, relative to other European countries of the time, free women in Gaelic Ireland [...] "held a good position" [...] and their social and property rights were [...] "in most respects, quite on a level with men".|$|E
2500|$|After {{years of}} {{negotiations}} over the proper amount of debt, Virginia brought suit before the U.S. Supreme Court (which, under [...] has original jurisdiction over suits {{in which a}} state is a party). Admitting the secession of West Virginia and the <b>transfer</b> <b>of</b> <b>property</b> and debt as proper, Virginia sued to recover one-third the worth of its 1861 debt (or about $33million). For its part, West Virginia asserted that the one-third accounting was inaccurate, for {{it was based on}} the fact that West Virginia constituted one-third of the geographic size of the original state of Virginia and that most of the debt was incurred to improve areas now outside the boundaries of West Virginia. West Virginia claimed that under its constitution, only its state legislature could determine the amount of debt that was appropriate, and that Virginia's settlement with its bondholders was a bar to any suit. Furthermore, West Virginia refused to pay for the new certificates and bonds issued by Virginia or for stock purchases made by Virginia.|$|E
2500|$|After the Mexican Revolution Mexico {{began an}} agrarian reform, {{based on the}} 27th article of the Mexican Constitution than {{included}} transfer of land and/or free land distribution to peasants and small farmers under {{the concept of the}} ejido. This program was further extended during President Cárdenas' administration during the 1930s and continued into the 1960s at varying rates. [...] The cooperative agrarian reform, which guaranteed small farmers a means of subsistence livelihood, also caused land fragmentation and lack of capital investment, since commonly held land could not be used as collateral. In an effort to raise rural productivity and living standards, this constitutional article was amended in 1992 to allow for the <b>transfer</b> <b>of</b> <b>property</b> rights of the communal lands to farmers cultivating it. [...] With the ability to rent or sell it, a way was open for the creation of larger farms and the advantages of economies of scale. Large mechanized farms are now operating in some northwestern states (mainly in Sinaloa). However, privatization of ejidos continues to be very slow in the central and southern states where the great majority of peasants produce only for subsistence.|$|E

2500|$|Constructive trust: Unlike {{an express}} trust, a {{constructive}} trust is not created by {{an agreement between}} a settlor and the trustee. A constructive trust is imposed by the law as an [...] "equitable remedy". This generally occurs due to some wrongdoing, where the wrongdoer has acquired legal title to some property and cannot in good conscience be allowed to benefit from it. A constructive trust is, essentially, a legal fiction. For example, a court of equity recognizing a plaintiff's request for the equitable remedy of a constructive trust may decide that a constructive trust has been created and simply order the person holding the assets to deliver them {{to the person who}} rightfully should have them. The constructive trustee is not necessarily the person who is guilty of the wrongdoing, and in practice it is often a bank or similar organization. The distinction may be finer than the preceding exposition in that there are also said to be two forms of constructive trust, the institutional constructive trust and the remedial constructive trust. The latter is an [...] "equitable remedy" [...] imposed by law being truly remedial; the former arising due to some defect in the <b>transfer</b> <b>of</b> <b>property.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Hobhouse, [...] "on his {{departure}} for India received strong hints {{that it would}} be desirable for him to slacken the pace of the legislative machine", which had been quickened by the consolidating and codifying activities of Fitzjames Stephen and of Stephen's immediate predecessor, Sir Henry Sumner Maine. That suggestion he approved. Whitley Stokes, secretary in the legislative department, was mainly responsible for the measures passed during Hobhouse's term of office, with the important exception of the Specific Relief Act, 1877, in which Hobhouse as an equity lawyer took an especial interest, and a revision of the law relating to the <b>transfer</b> <b>of</b> <b>property,</b> which became a statute after he left India. Of strong liberal sentiment, Hobhouse had small sympathy with the general policy of the government of India during the opening of Lord Lytton's viceroyalty. The attitude to Afghanistan was especially repugnant. He served from 1875 to 1877 as Vice-Chancellor of the University of Calcutta. On the conclusion of his term of office in 1877 he was made a K.C.S.I., and returning to England soon engaged in party politics as a thoroughgoing opponent of the Afghan policy of the conservative government.|$|E
2500|$|Although he {{traveled}} extensively to maintain {{contact with his}} growing brotherhood of friars, Dominic made his headquarters at Rome. In 1219, Pope Honorius III invited Saint Dominic and his companions {{to take up residence}} at the ancient Roman basilica of Santa Sabina, which they did by early 1220. Before that time the friars had only a temporary residence in Rome at the convent of San Sisto Vecchio, which Honorius III had given to Dominic circa 1218, intending it to become a convent for a reformation of nuns at Rome under Dominic's guidance. [...] The official foundation of the Dominican convent at Santa Sabina with its studium conventuale, the first Dominican studium in Rome, occurred with the legal <b>transfer</b> <b>of</b> <b>property</b> from Pope Honorius III to the Order of Preachers on 5 June 1222, though the brethren had taken up residence there already in 1220. [...] The studium at Santa Sabina was the forerunner of the studium generale at Santa Maria sopra Minerva.

I support this reading by appealing to textual and contextual evidence. I conclude by drawing a lesson from Locke’s views for current debates on territorial rights...|$|R
