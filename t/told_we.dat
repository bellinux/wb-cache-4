25|$|By {{the end of}} September 1957, {{the nine}} were {{admitted}} to Little Rock Central High {{under the protection of}} the 101st Airborne Division (and later the Arkansas National Guard), but they were still subjected to a year of physical and verbal abuse (being spat on and called names) by many of the white students. Melba Pattillo had acid thrown into her eyes and also recalled in her book, Warriors Don't Cry, an incident in which a group of white girls trapped her in a stall in the girls' washroom and attempted to burn her by dropping pieces of flaming paper on her from above. Another one of the students, Minnijean Brown, was verbally confronted and abused. She said I was one of the kids 'approved' by the school officials. We were <b>told</b> <b>we</b> would have to take a lot and were warned not to fight back if anything happened. One girl ran up to me and said, 'I'm so glad you're here. Won't you go to lunch with me today?' I never saw her again.|$|E

500|$|... "Just a Fool" [...] {{received}} mostly positive {{reviews from}} music critics. In a track-by-track review, Robert Copsey of Digital Spy {{wrote that the}} song [...] "looks obligatory on paper but fortunately isn't so bad in reality [...] Truth be <b>told,</b> <b>we</b> suspect there's a good reason why this has been saved for the back-end of the album". Chris Younie of 4Music praised the song, writing that [...] "It's mature, sophisticated and unlike anything else we've heard on the album. If you want variety, you got it". Andrew Hammp for Billboard was also positive toward the track, commenting that the song has an [...] "epic" [...] chorus that only increases in volume as the song progresses. In an extremely positive review, Glenn Gamboa of Newsday wrote that Aguilera and Shelton [...] "empty their broken hearts in a magnificently sung breakup song". She also praised [...] "Just a Fool" [...] as Aguilera's career signature which should [...] "stand next to 'Beautiful'". Mike Wass of Idolator called [...] "Just a Fool" [...] is a [...] "gorgeous" [...] country ballad, while Jon Caramanica of The New York Times {{described it as a}} [...] "surprisingly warm duet" [...] and Molly Lambert of Grantland named it [...] "a monster-ballad".|$|E

[...] Entertainment Weeklys Kyle Anderson said, [...] "When [...] uses baroque orchestral accoutrements to wage an air assault on her demons... she's {{more than just the}} token girl in the pit." [...] Lewis Corner of Digital Spy gave the album four stars out of five, saying that the band's trademark sound was present on the album [...] "and truth be <b>told,</b> <b>we</b> wouldn't want it any other way." [...] Mark Lepage of the Montreal Gazette praised the album, calling it [...] "one rolling, chugging, plangent epic." [...] According to Chad Grischow of IGN, Evanescence is a [...] "great album that delivers the familiar while {{keeping an eye on the}} future." [...] Rob Williams of the Winnipeg Free Press described the album as gothic nu metal and hard rock, with dramatic orchestration which makes everything sound [...] "big and alive": [...] "With so many extra bells and whistles, despair has never sounded so epic." [...] Marc Hirsh of The Boston Globe wrote that the album captures [...] "each party elevating the other far above where their proclivities would get them on their own." ...|$|E
2500|$|While {{the central}} concept behind Buffy was [...] "high {{school as a}} horror movie" [...] in small-town America, co-creators David Greenwalt and Whedon were looking to make Angel into a {{different}} [...] "gritty, urban show." [...] Whedon explained, [...] "We wanted a much darker show, darker in tone. It's set in Los Angeles {{because there are a}} lot of demons in L.A. and a wealth of stories to be <b>told.</b> <b>We</b> also wanted to take the show a little older and have the characters deal with demons in a much different way. Buffy is always the underdog trying to save the world, but Angel is looking for redemption. It's those two things that creatively make the shows different." ...|$|E

2500|$|Before the 2001 season, Maryland hired a {{new head}} coach, Ralph Friedgen, who {{engineered}} a first-year turnaround for the program. During summer training camp, Gary took an awkward hit and suffered a cervical spine injury. He was evacuated to the University of Maryland Shock Trauma Center in Baltimore, but fully recovered. Against sixth-ranked Georgia Tech, Gary made a critical 18-yard reception to the Yellow Jackets' 46-yard line with 40seconds left {{as part of}} a drive to push within field goal range. Nick Novak later kicked the tying field goal, and in overtime, kicked the game-winner. The win improved the Terps' record to 6–0 and secured bowl eligibility for Maryland {{for the first time since}} 1991. Against Virginia, Gary recorded five receptions for 99 yards and a 53-yard touchdown. In the penultimate regular season game, 13th-ranked Maryland played Clemson at Byrd Stadium. Gary recorded five receptions for 93yards and a touchdown, and the Terrapins won, 37–20, to ensure at least a share of the Atlantic Coast Conference (ACC) championship with Florida State. The following week, Maryland played its last conference game against NC State. In the final minutes of regulation, with Maryland trailing, quarterback Shaun Hill mounted a 61-yard drive. It culminated with an eight-yard pass to Gary in the corner of the end zone to win the game, 23–19, with 41seconds remaining. The win secured the outright ACC championship. Throughout the season, Gary was quarterback Shaun Hill's preferred receiver, and led the balanced Maryland receiving corps. Gary recorded 49receptions, 727yards, and six touchdowns. He was the first Maryland player since Gary Collins in 1961 to lead the team in receptions in three consecutive seasons. Gary was named an All-ACC player, which made him the first Maryland receiver honored as such since 1995. About that championship-winning season, Gary said in 2009:"Every day, we were <b>told</b> <b>we</b> were nothing. Every day, we were <b>told</b> <b>we</b> were picked to finish seventh in the conference for a reason. Really, we don't have a lot of fond football memories.

State administration had muddled every path we wanted to take. We were told that people would not eat trawled fish. We were told that trawled fish could not be landed fresh. We were <b>told</b> <b>we</b> should not make our running expenses. To-day we are doing everything that the State industry at tempted, and are making it pay. We have put the trawling industry firmly on its feet. We started off with no better equipment than the State, and with handicaps Imposed on us by the State., But throughout we had the advantages of business administration and of cleanliness. As for the profits to be made, take our own case. Our profits have long since repaid us the cost of our trawler. We have Just floated ourselves into a company, with a capital of £20,000. We are looking round now in Scotland for a second trawler. We have only begun to show the possibilities of the industry. There are further big developments to come." ...|$|E

2500|$|In {{the wake}} of the Supreme Court {{decision}} Snyder v. Phelps, which held that the Westboro Baptist Church had the right to picket the funerals of dead soldiers on a public sidewalk, Palin asserted that the Court held a double standard for the WBC's speech, as opposed to other religious speech. On March 2, 2011, she tweeted: [...] "Common sense & decency absent as wacko 'church' allowed hate msgs spewed@ soldiers' funerals but we can't invoke God's name in public square" [...] Palin clarified her tweet the next day: [...] "Obviously my comment meant that when we’re <b>told</b> <b>we</b> can’t say ‘God bless you’ in graduation speeches or pray before a local football game but these wackos can invoke God’s name in their hate speech while picketing our military funerals, it shows ridiculous inconsistency. I wasn’t calling for any limit on free speech, and it’s a shame some folks tried to twist my comment in that way.

2500|$|Buechner recalls of {{his accomplishments}} at Exeter: [...] "All <b>told,</b> <b>we</b> {{were there for}} nine years with one year's leave of absence tucked in the middle, {{and by the time}} we left, the {{religion}} department had grown from only one full-time teacher, namely myself, and about twenty students, to four teachers and something in the neighborhood, as I remember, of three hundred students or more." [...] Among these students was the future author John Irving, who included a quotation from Buechner in the preface of his book A Prayer for Owen Meany. One of Buechner's biographers, Marjorie Casebier McCoy, describes the effect of his time at Exeter as follows: [...] "Buechner in his sermons had been attempting to reach out to the [...] "cultured despisers of religion." [...] The students and faculty at Phillips Exeter had been, for the most part, just that when he had arrived at the school, and it had been they who compelled him to hone his preaching and literary skills to their utmost in order to get a hearing for Christian faith." ...|$|E
2500|$|A {{subsequent}} {{civil case}} trial {{was held in}} 1998 with the charges that the Ku Klux Klan incited the crime. The case was brought to court by the Southern Poverty Law Center, represented by attorney Morris Dees. The lawyer for the Klan insisted that the criminals acted alone in burning down the church. Defense attorney Gary White painted the Klan Grand Dragon Horace King as a feeble old man merely exercising his right to free speech, saying King never authorized the arson. During the trial, the Church's lawyers showed racist Klan posters and literature and played a videotape for the jury showing King speaking at a Klan rally, saying [...] "It's time, people, {{to wake up and}} shape up and say this is our country, white people, take it back." [...] The Klan leaders insisted that they never encouraged anyone to break the law, but two of the sentenced arsonists testified against their case. Welch testified, [...] "The church fire was Klan business, and we were <b>told</b> <b>we</b> would not go to jail. We were convinced we were untouchable." [...] Both Welch and Cox said that they testified against the Klan to atone for what they'd done.|$|E
