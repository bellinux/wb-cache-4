40|$|The {{move towards}} {{automated}} driving is gaining ground. This paper reviews {{the development process}} of self-driving technology and discusses the safety and efficiency advantages of autonomous vehicles. The discussion shows that the existing traffic management system, including transport infrastructures and regulations, should be changed accordingly to maximize the advantages of autonomous driving. Thus, this paper subsequently gives an insight of the traffic management from three aspects: fully self-driving <b>traffic</b> <b>infrastructures,</b> mixed <b>traffic</b> <b>infrastructures</b> and regulations. First, it is summarized in detail what should be adjusted in intersections, parking lots, pedestrian crossings, ramps, signs and markings. With the transformation of <b>traffic</b> <b>infrastructures,</b> the advantages of driverless car will be more pronounced on account of increased capacity, reduced delay and land use. Also, this paper indicates that the implementations of strict product liability for self-driving car manufacturers and no-fault tort liability for users are applicable to automated vehicle accidents...|$|R

And over a long term vision, with changes as th increase of motorization, urbanization, population growth and changes in population density.

40|$|With {{passenger}} {{and cargo}} traffic growing rapidly world-wide, and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) poised to enter commercial airspaces, a secure {{next generation of}} air traffic management systems is required. Recent articles in the academic and hacker community highlight crucial security challenges faced by integral parts of these next generation protocols, with the most dangerous attacks based on classic message injection. In this article, we analyze the possibility and effectiveness of detecting such attacks on critical air <b>traffic</b> <b>infrastructures</b> with a single receiver based on physical layer information. Using hypothesis testing and anomaly detection schemes, we develop an intrusion detection system (IDS) that can accurately detect attackers within 40 seconds.

40|$|Coping with threats such as terrorism, crime, {{natural hazards}} or {{industrial}} accidents requires {{early detection and}} correct assessment of critical situations, followed by appropriate actions to avoid potential damage to person or property. We here focus on threat prevention in closed properties of <b>traffic</b> <b>infrastructures</b> (railway stations, harbours, airports) or logistics centres. To early detect and prevent damage, the property is continuously monitored by sensors and security staff. We propose to model the threat situation of the property as a continuous-time Markov decision process (CMDP). The CMDP-model is used as core of a decision support system (DSS), which assists the security staff in two aspects: it facilitates to identify the threat situation of the property and suggests the cost-optimal action by which the property will be kept in or returned into a safe state. The concept is also shown in a numerical example. ...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} {{examples}} of consequences for logistical organisation of firms, stemming from new fixed links in Denmark, are described and discussed. It {{is argued that}} the most significant impacts of the new fixed links can be identified among transport firms. The effects on the activities among manufacturing and distribution firms seem {{to be far more}} limited due to the different levels of logistical decision-making of the firms. The impact on the logistical decisions-levels such as localisation and organisation of trading relations (supplier and customer links) has been very limited or even absent. A greater impact has been registered on the organisation of material flows and transport resources. The conclusions presented in this paper contributes to a more general discussion on how new major <b>traffic</b> <b>infrastructures</b> affect transport logistical systems in terms of fundamental structural changes and through increases in physical mobility...|$|R
