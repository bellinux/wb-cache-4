40|$|The {{composition}} of <b>tepary</b> <b>beans</b> Phaseolus acutifolius var. latifolius was determined; starch (41 %) and protein (26. 3 %) were the predominant components. The physical, physicochemical, rheological, structural and nutritional {{properties of the}} isolated starch and its suitability in food products were evaluated. Starch granules were spherical to oval with a typical legume starch birefringence pattern. They appeared smooth and showed a normal distribution of diameters (range 15. 5 - 59. 9 μ; mean 33. 5 μ). Tepary starch had an amylose content of 30. 7 % and a gelatinization temperature range of 70. 5 - 84. 0 °C. Other physicochemical values were as follows: phosphorus, 0. 01 %; iodine binding capacity, 6. 14 %; alkali number, 8. 97; inherent viscosity, 2. 44 ml/g; water binding capacity, 82. 1 %; swelling power, 13; solubility, 17. 9 %; and sag, 6. 26 %. Fractionation provided an amylose fraction with a β-amylolysis of 76. 3 %, limiting viscosity of 83. 5 ml/g and a DP(η) of 618. Amylopectin (iodine binding capacity, 0. 88 %) had a DP(η) of 1094, limiting viscosity of 91. 1 ml/g and CL, OCL, and ICL values of 33, 22 and 10 glucose units, respectively. Gelatinization of tepary starch was a single-step process. Pasting viscosity was stable when starch suspensions were cooked at 95 °C for 15 min; viscosity progressively increased when pastes cooled to 50 °C. At 4 and 6 %, tepary starch pastes resembled a type C viscosity pattern, whereas at 7 % and above, pasting behavior exhibited a type B pattern. Pastes were stable at pH 5 to 9 but showed faster breakdown and no retrogradation at pH 3. Addition of sucrose and salt changed rheological behavior; 2 % oil {{had no effect on}} pasting. Sensory evaluation of tepary starch vanilla pudding established its consumer acceptability. In vitro determination indicated that raw tepary starch was poorly digested (8 %). Digestibility improved (from 8 to 82 %) upon cooking. Raw corn starch was more digestible (25. 6 %) than tepary starch. Freeze-drying reduced the hydrolysis of all materials evaluated (i. e. 8. 64 to 3. 21 %, 8. 03 to 2. 63 % and 25. 6 to 17. 8 % for tepary flour, tepary starch and corn starch, respectively). Autoclaving decreased the digestibility of tepary flour (8. 64 to 5. 72 %), and tepary starch (8. 03 to 7. 38 %), but it slightly improved that of corn starch (25. 6 to 27. 7 %) ...|$|R

However, the levels of these solutes were not large enough {{to account for the}} total osmotic adjustment observed in the salt treated seedlings. This study shows that <b>tepary</b> <b>bean</b> has specific strategies to overcome the impact of salinity through osmotic adjustment and exclusion of Na and Cl ions from the stems and leaves by retaining these ions in the proximal part of root and stem base.

40|$|Congruity and {{recurrent}} backcross interspecific hybrids between {{common bean}} (Phaseolus vulgaris L.) and <b>tepary</b> <b>bean</b> (P. acutifolius A. Gray) were compared {{for the amount}} of introgression occurring between genomes by amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) markers. A total of 60 genotypes were analyzed of which 34 were obtained by congruity backcrossing, four by single backcrossing and 14 by recurrent backcrossing, with parental and representative tepary and common bean genotypes used as controls. The level of introgression of <b>tepary</b> <b>bean</b> marker bands into the common bean genome background was higher in the congruity backcross lines than in the recurrent backcross derived genotypes. Congruity backcross lines derived from five cycles of interspecific hybridization showed an average introgression of 8. 8 % of AFLP bands while lines derived from a single backcross with the same parents showed an average introgression of only 5. 2 % of the bands. For both types of backcrossing, these levels of introgression were significantly below those expected. A multiple correspondence analysis showed three major clusters consisting of the common bean accessions and interspecifics with low rates of introgression, an intermediate group of interspecific congruity backcross lines with higher rates of introgression and a more distant group that included all the <b>tepary</b> <b>bean</b> accessions. These results suggest that congruity backcrossing can be used to increase introgression rates between the species and to transfer favorable oligogenic traits from <b>tepary</b> <b>bean</b> to common bean but that levels of introgression between the species remains low.
