40|$|The {{principle}} of non-refoulement requires Canada to carry out risk assessments prior to removal of non-citizens from Canada, when they allege the risk of persecution, torture {{or other forms of}} cruel and inhuman treatment at their home country. Thus, to ensure compliance of the {{principle of}} non-refoulement, Canada established the Pre-Removal Risk Assessment ("PRRA") process. My thesis focuses on the procedural set up of the PRRA process, which makes it difficult for an applicant to qualify for an <b>oral</b> <b>hearing.</b> <b>Oral</b> <b>hearing</b> may be held in the PRRA process if the Minister, on the basis of prescribed factors, is of the opinion that a hearing is required. Three prescribed factors under section 167 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Regulations ("IRPR ") restrict the possibility of having an <b>oral</b> <b>hearing</b> in <b>the</b> PRRA process. They remove the discretionary ability of PRRA Officers to call for oral hearings to assess or reassess the credibility of the applicant or the claim. <b>The</b> lack of <b>oral</b> <b>hearing</b> or <b>the</b> difficulty in obtaining one could adversely affect the fairness of the PRRA process. Moreover, oral hearings address procedural issues such as the right to reply and the duty to disclose. My thesis will demonstrate that: (1) higher level of procedural fairness, arising from common law, necessitates an <b>oral</b> <b>hearing</b> for <b>the</b> PRRA process with respect to credibility assessment; (2) the {{principle of non-refoulement}} is a principle of fundamental justice; and (3) the prescribed factors, for determining whether an <b>oral</b> <b>hearing</b> is required for the PRRA process, violate section 7 of the Charter and cannot be saved by section 1. Therefore, section 167 of the IRPR is unconstitutional and invalid...|$|R

5000|$|Yasuda is {{the chief}} defender for a 19-year-old boy accused {{and sentenced to death}} by the Hiroshima High Court in April 2008 for raping and {{strangling}} a woman to death and murdering her one-year-old daughter in 1999 in Hikari city, Yamaguchi. [...] This case has received much attention because of the circumstances of the crime and the possibility the death penalty being imposed on a minor (the age of majority in Japan is 20). [...] The Supreme Court ruled that perpetrator's age {{at the time of the}} crime did not exempt him from the death penalty. Yasuda and the defense team tried to prevent the death penalty from being applied by claiming that the accused did not intend to kill the woman or her baby. In March 2006, Yasuda and his group of attorneys were absent from <b>the</b> <b>oral</b> argument <b>hearing</b> for some reason. The Japanese media considered their behavior as a tactic to delay the trial just as they did during the Asahara trial without any legitimate reason; the Supreme Court ordered them to attend the next hearing.|$|R

40|$|This {{comment is}} based on the Wireless Code Working Document, {{submissions}} made on the online consultation, and submissions made during <b>the</b> <b>oral</b> <b>hearing.</b> Pursuant to the working document, we make a number of suggestions regarding the wording of certain sections, primarily in the interest of increasing transparency, simplifying the terminology, and supporting consumer empowerment. To reiterate our intervention, drawn from original research with youth and seniors (attached to this comment as an appendix), we suggest that considering the wireless needs of particular vulnerable – and, in the case of seniors, rapidly growing – groups will result in benefits to all Canadians. Finally, we maintain that the implementation of a Wireless Code that supports consumer rights is urgent, especially for more vulnerable segments of the Canadian population. The need for such a code evidences the continuing lack of sufficient industry competition in Canada. Increased market competition would address many of the issues raised in the online comments and during <b>the</b> <b>oral</b> <b>hearing...</b>|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{discusses}} the Justice Administration System in Karata {{and the influence}} of Positive Law over the Indigenous Law or vice versa. The research was based primarily on participatory observation, focus group discussion, interviews with key person and literature review regarding Indigenous law, legal pluralism and conflict resolution. The conclusions reached was that Justice Administration in Karata is carried out by an administrative body composed by the Wihta, Elders, Communal Police, Religious Leader and Director from the Primary School, with the responsibility to maintain peace and social harmony in the community by the use of sanctions and punishment based on their customs and traditions such as public shame, talamana – payment of blood and exile. The Indigenous System of Law has experienced transformations that are evidenced during <b>the</b> <b>oral</b> <b>hearing</b> by the incorporation of elements from the Positive System of Law such as the principles of orality, immediacy and publicity among others, that requires the Wihta to have basic legal knowledge, due to the coordination/collaboration existing between authorities of the Indigenous system and the Positive System of Law. In relation to the knowledge and understanding of the Indigenous System of Law and the Positive System, the community members are aware of the existence of the Positive Law and have basic knowledge of the Human Rights instrument. Yet, the members of the community prefer the Indigenous System of Law and use the Positive System as a last resort when they claim that their standard Human Rights have been violated in the Indigenous System...|$|E
5000|$|A third case, which {{received}} case number [...] "Art. 23 1/16", contained a redrafted {{request from the}} Administrative Council asking for a proposal {{for the removal of}} the Board member. During first non-public oral proceedings held on 10 to 12 May 2016, the Enlarged Board of Appeal held that the Administrative Council's request was formally admissible for discussion as to its merits, unlike the first request filed in case Art. 23 1/15. The Enlarged Board also decided that public oral proceedings would be held in June 2016, in order to discuss the merits of the case. However, shortly before <b>the</b> scheduled <b>oral</b> proceedings, <b>the</b> Enlarged Board received a letter from the president of the EPO, who is not a party to the proceedings, indicating that he considered <b>the</b> planned public <b>oral</b> <b>hearing</b> and <b>the</b> hearing of witnesses from the Office as [...] "unlawful".

The Administrative Council replied, but the Enlarged Board deemed that the Administrative Council did not do so satisfactory. The Board thus decided not to request removal from office of the defendant, without deciding on the substantive allegations made against the suspended member.|$|R

40|$|The paper {{outlines}} the whole disciplinary procedure {{for the police}} officers in the Republic of Croatia, including statistical data for the procedures conducted from 2002 to 2005 at the Department of Disciplinary Procedures of the Ministry of Internal Affairs. In {{the introductory part of}} the paper, the author has emphasised the importance of police service as well as of respect for the duties of the police officers, stressing that police officers are held responsible for improper behaviour both at and outside work. The concept and character of disciplinary responsibility of police officers, general prerequisites for disciplinary responsibility, bodies in charge of conducting the procedure, and the parties to the procedure are analysed next. Analysing procedural provisions according to which disciplinary procedure is conducted, the author emphasises the inadequacies in implementation of the Law on Criminal Proceedings and the Law on General Administrative Procedure, and stresses the necessity of passing a special law that would regulate that area comprehensively. Then follow the chapters on instituting <b>the</b> procedure, <b>oral</b> <b>hearing,</b> procedure costs, statute of limitations for institution and conduct of the procedures, types of disciplinary offences and disciplinary sanctions, legal remedies, and court protection. Statistical analysis of the work performed at the Department of Disciplinary Procedures (Ministry of Internal Affairs) outlines all disciplinary procedures conducted against police officers. The author analyses individual institutes and identifies previous regulations, regulations concerning disciplinary responsibility of other state civil servants, judges and district attorneys, normative solutions in comparative legislation, and judgements of disciplinary courts of the Ministry of Internal Affairs, the Administrative Court, the Constitutional Court, and the European Court of Human Rights. Finally, the author suggests changes of certain regulations in order to ensure efficiency and eliminate normative dilemmas in the conduct of disciplinary procedures. He is of the opinion {{that it is necessary to}} retain specialised disciplinary courts within the Ministry of Internal Affairs due to the specific nature of police service and the required efficiency and legality of its functioning...|$|R
