25|$|When I saw Going My Way I was as {{moved as}} they were by the {{character}} he played. Father O'Malley handled that gang of young hooligans in his parish with such kindness and wisdom that I thought he was wonderful too. Instead of coming {{down hard on the}} kids and withdrawing his affection, he forgave them their misdeeds, took them to the ball game and picture show, taught them how to sing. By the last reel, the sheer persistence of his goodness had transformed even the worst of them into solid citizens. Then the lights came on and the movie was over. All the way back to <b>the</b> <b>house</b> <b>I</b> thought about the difference between the person up there on the screen and the one I knew at home.|$|E
25|$|Mr. Randolph {{goes to the}} House booted and spurred, {{with his}} whip in hand, in imitation, it is said, {{of members of the}} British Parliament. He is a very slight man but of the common stature. At a little distance, he does not appear older than you are; but, upon a nearer approach, you {{perceive}} his wrinkles and grey hairs. He is, I believe, about thirty. He is a descendant in the right line from the celebrated Indian Princess, Pochahontas. The Federalists ridicule and affect to despise him; but a despised foe often proves a dangerous enemy. His talents are certainly far above mediocrity. As a popular speaker, he is not inferior to any man in <b>the</b> <b>House.</b> <b>I</b> admire his ingenuity and address; but I dislike his politics.|$|E

Paul Haggis' main contribution was to rewrite the climax of the film. He explained, [...] "the draft that was there was very faithful to the book and there was a confession, so in the original draft the character confessed and killed herself.

500|$|Anderson was by {{no means}} alone in her late {{emergence}} onto the literary stage: Geordie Williamson notes that several of Anderson's Australian female contemporaries including Elizabeth Jolley, Olga Masters, and Amy Witting did not begin publishing until they had reached retirement age. He suggests that each of these women was constrained largely by material circumstances, including [...] "the demands of family and work, lack of financial independence, an indifferent publishing environment." [...] When discussing her career, Anderson was quite clear about where her duties lay: [...] "When I was married, and writing at home (writing was my second job; my first was <b>the</b> <b>house)</b> ... <b>I</b> never craved {{to be out in the}} workplace." [...] He suggests that, as well as adverse material circumstances, Anderson's career was delayed, and her success mitigated by modesty and a certain [...] "diffidence regarding her gifts." [...] In her own essay entitled [...] "Starting Too Late," [...] Anderson complains that [...] "they are unwilling servants, those skills we learn too late." [...] She would perhaps have described success as such a skill. When asked about how winning awards had affected her life, she replied that: ...|$|E

Harold Kittinger, a worker at the Suntone Factory, said, [...] "I do not care to tell anyone I was frightened. But I was not shaking in my shoes. My shoes were moving." [...] One woman hypothesized that the shaking was a [...] "bomb". Grace Standerfer suggested the earthquake was sudden, saying, [...] "I was just scared to death. My husband and I were in the house. The Venetian shades began to shake one way, then another. When that awful blast came, he grabbed me and we ran outside. Things were falling and breaking in <b>the</b> <b>house.</b> <b>I</b> said to him, 'This is it.' I thought the world had come to an end. Outside, wires were moving. There was no wind. The ground was quivering under our feet. I was so scared. I did not know I was scared." [...] People in the community of Mount Vernon, Illinois, were frightened by the shaking. However, some did not notice the earthquake; Jane Bessen said her party was [...] "in a car... to Evansville and didn't know about it until we got there".|$|E

[...] By the age of 12, she was playing with adults in a dance band, earning $10 per night. She began singing as well as playing the piano during a {{time in her life}} when she lived in Billings, Montana. She was a 28-year-old divorced single mother of three when she started working as the Sip 'n Dip's piano player in 1963, taking the position as a second job in order to support her children. [...] She simultaneously worked as a medical transcriptionist for 38 years before retiring from her day job in 2000.

500|$|According to Reuters, some {{neighbors and}} {{relatives}} of the dead saw a group of U.S. soldiers arrive at their village at about 2 a.m., enter homes and open fire. [...] "They were all drunk and shooting all over the place," [...] said neighbor Agha Lala. [...] According to The New York Times, one of the attack's survivors and [...] "at least five other villagers" [...] described seeing a number of soldiers, while some other Afghan residents described seeing only one gunman. [...] One mother-of-six, whose husband was killed during the incident, reported involvement {{of a large number}} of people: [...] "When they shot dead my husband, I tried to drag him into <b>the</b> <b>house...</b> <b>I</b> saw more than 20 people when I looked out the house. The Americans pointed their guns at me and threatened me, telling me not to leave the house or they'd kill me." [...] An eight-year-old girl named Noorbinak, whose father was killed, reported that [...] "one man entered the room and the others were standing in the yard, holding lights." [...] The brother of another victim claimed his nephews and nieces had seen [...] "numerous soldiers" [...] with headlamps and lighted guns. [...] Some elected officials said that they believed the attack was planned, claiming that one soldier could not have carried out such an act without help. In response, Afghan President Hamid Karzai appointed General Sher Mohammad Karimi to investigate the claims.|$|E
500|$|Of Keats's {{six major}} odes of 1819, [...] "Ode to Psyche", was {{probably}} written first and [...] "To Autumn" [...] written last. Sometime between these two, he wrote [...] "Ode to a Nightingale". It {{is possible that}} [...] "Ode to a Nightingale" [...] was written between 26 April and 18 May 1819, based on weather conditions and similarities between images in the poem and those in a letter sent to Fanny Brawne on May Day. The poem was composed at the Hampstead house Keats shared with Brown, possibly while sitting beneath a plum tree in the garden. According to Keats' friend Brown, Keats finished the ode in just one morning: [...] "In the spring of 1819 a nightingale had built her nest near my house. Keats felt a tranquil and continual joy in her song; and one morning he took his chair from the breakfast-table to the grass-plot under a plum-tree, where he sat {{for two or three}} hours. When he came into <b>the</b> <b>house,</b> <b>I</b> perceived he had some scraps of paper in his hand, and these he was quietly thrusting behind the books. On inquiry, I found those scraps, four or five in number, contained his poetic feelings on the song of the nightingale." [...] Brown's account is personal, as he claimed the poem was directly influenced by his house and preserved by his own doing. However, Keats relied on both his own imagination and other literature as sources for his depiction of the nightingale.|$|E
500|$|Casino Royale reboots the series, {{establishing}} a new timeline and narrative framework {{not meant to}} precede or succeed any previous Bond film. Barbara Broccoli stated that [...] "For years, my father wanted to make Casino Royale—it's the Holy Grail... We {{wanted to make a}} tougher film, the way it should have been made years ago". Fellow producer Michael G. Wilson agreed, commenting [...] "We felt the last film was too fantastical, so we {{decided to go back to}} the basics and update". Neal Purvis and Robert Wade began writing a screenplay at the end of February 2004, while Pierce Brosnan was still Bond. Paul Haggis was brought in later, and his main contribution included rewriting the climax of the film. He explained that [...] "the draft that was there was very faithful to the book and there was a confession, so in the original draft the character confessed and killed herself. She then sent Bond to chase after the villains; Bond chased the villains into <b>the</b> <b>house.</b> <b>I</b> don't know why but I thought that Vesper [...] had to be in the sinking house and Bond has to want to kill her and then try and save her". In February 2005 Martin Campbell was announced as the film's director and the next Bond film was revealed to be Casino Royale, although the identity of the new Bond was still unknown; the producers had chosen not to renew Pierce Brosnan's contract, and in October Eon announced that the part of Bond would be taken by Daniel Craig.|$|E
