6000|$|I {{have stepped}} {{on one side}} from the {{immediate}} subject because this is as good an instance as any {{we are likely to}} come across of a certain almost extraneous fault which does deface the work of Bernard Shaw. It is a fault only to be mentioned when we have made the solidity of the merits quite clear. To say that Shaw is merely making game of people is demonstrably ridiculous; at least a fairly systematic philosophy can be traced through all his jokes, and one would not insist on such a unity in all the songs of Mr. Dan Leno. I have already pointed out that the genius of Shaw is really too harsh and earnest rather than too merry and irresponsible. I shall have occasion to point out later that Shaw is, in one very serious sense, the very opposite of paradoxical. In any case if any real student of Shaw says that Shaw is only making a fool of him, we can only say that of that student it is very superfluous for anyone to make a fool. But though the dramatist's jests are always serious and generally obvious, he is really affected from time to time by a certain spirit of which that climate theory is a case--a spirit that can only be called one of senseless ingenuity. I suppose it is a sort of nemesis of wit; the skidding of a wheel in the height of its speed. Perhaps it is connected with the nomadic nature of his mind. That lack of roots, <b>this</b> <b>remoteness</b> from ancient instincts and traditions is responsible for a certain bleak and heartless extravagance of statement on certain subjects which makes the author really unconvincing as well as exaggerative; satires that are saugrenu, jokes that are rather silly than wild, statements which even considered as lies have no symbolic relation to truth. They are exaggerations of something that does not exist. For instance, if a man called Christmas Day a mere hypocritical excuse for drunkenness and gluttony that would be false, but it would have a fact hidden in it somewhere. But when Bernard Shaw says that Christmas Day is only a conspiracy kept up by poulterers and wine merchants from strictly business motives, then he says something which is not so much false as startlingly and arrestingly foolish. He might as well say that the two sexes were invented by jewellers who wanted to sell wedding rings. Or again, take the case of nationality and the unit of patriotism. If a man said that all boundaries between clans, kingdoms, or empires were nonsensical or non-existent, that would be a fallacy, but a consistent and philosophical fallacy. But when Mr. Bernard Shaw says that England matters so little that the British Empire might very well give up these islands to Germany, he has not only got hold of the sow by the wrong ear but the wrong sow by the wrong ear; a mythical sow, a sow that is not there at all. If Britain is unreal, the British Empire must be a thousand times more unreal. It is as if one said, [...] "I do not believe that Michael Scott ever had any existence; but I am convinced, in spite of the absurd legend, that he had a shadow." ...|$|E

40|$|The Arctic {{region is}} {{changing}} rapidly and dramatically {{as a result}} of climate change, perhaps two to three times faster than other areas of the world. Its inaccessibility, remoteness, and low population density no longer offers sufficient protection from expanding human use and development for its rich and diverse natural and cultural heritage.

40|$|A {{study has}} been {{completed}} which examined the technical, operational and safety issues associated with subsea production and subsea well systems. The rapidly accelerating shift to subsea production represents {{a significant departure from}} conventional production operations. The subsea environment is perhaps the most remote and unexplored on earth. <b>This</b> <b>remoteness</b> makes monitoring and intervention much more difficult and raises unique environmental issues. Historically, subsea production and subsea well systems have had a good track record. However, these systems are now being deployed in ways rarely encountered in previous development schemes, presenting a number of technical challenges. One of the key challenges is to address the expected poor primary recoveries from subsea wells. Subsea production systems require the transportation of a multiphase mixture of oil, water and gas for many miles from the producing well to a distant processing facility. Industry and regulators are increasingly becoming aware that, while reducing up-front capital outlays, long, multiphase flowlines add additional backpressure, reducing flow rates and ultimate recoveries. For example, conventional production operations routinely drawdown wellhead pressures to 10 - 20 bar, while subsea completed wells may have abandonment wellhead pressures over 100 bar due to the backpressure added by the long multiphase flowline. One of the challenges posed by subsea production is how to reduce wellhead pressure to allow effective recovery of hydrocarbon resources. To address this issue, there is growing interest in processing the produced fluids subsea, to achieve improved recoveries and greater efficiencies. A goal {{of this study is to}} provide decision makers with the information necessary to assess the conservation impact associated with various subsea production strategies; strategies that may or may not consider subsea processing or subsea multiphase pumping.

40|$|The Faroe Islands in the North Atlantic {{are part}} of the sub-Arctic region, a remote region far from {{industrial}} activity. In spite of <b>this</b> <b>remoteness,</b> the Islands are not a sanctuary: exposures and effects of environmental pollutants mar its natural beauty and wildlife. In the Arctic regions, fish, sea mammals and seabirds have shown to contain elevated levels of the classical persistent organic pollutants (POPs) such as polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), as well as more recent POPs such as the polybrominated diphenyl ethers (PBDEs). Human populations living in the Arctic regions are usually highly dependent on seafood and seabirds as food sources, and diet becomes their major source of exposures to POPs. As reported in the 1980 ’s, residents of the Faroe Islands were shown to have high concentrations of organohalogen substances (OHS) in their breast milk. Long-finned pilot whales (Globicephala melas) blubber and meat {{have been shown to be}} a major source of OHS exposure for some of the Faroe Islanders. The main objective of this thesis is to investigate the sources and concentrations of some POPs and their metabolites for the Faroese population. First, human milk and serum from pregnant women (mothers) and children were analyzed for PBDEs, PCBs, and polychlorinated biphenylols (OH-PCB), the major PCB metabolites. Second, POPs were measured in seabirds, i. e. PCBs in fulmars (Fulmarus glacialis) and guillemots (Uria algae), and PBDEs in fulmars to search for other potential sources of POPs exposure. The results reinforce previous findings that part of the Faroe Island population is highly exposed to OHS. Median concentrations (430 ng/g lipid weight (l. w.) of CB- 153) in maternal serum (1994 - 95) are among the highest in the world. Serum concentrations of CB- 153 in children (age 7, samples collected in the early 2000 ’s) were approximately 90 % of those in the mothers, sampled 1994 - 95. Similarly high CB- 153 concentrations (380 ng/g l. w.) were measured in samples of mother’s milk, collected in 1999. The OH-PCB concentrations were also high in segments of the population, with 2. 9 ng/g fresh weight as the sum of five OH-PCBs. Except for 4 -OH-CB 107, concentrations of OH-PCBs were generally lower in children than in mothers. The ΣPBDE median concentrations in maternal serum and human milk (1999) are at the higher end of those reported in Europe, with levels of 9. 5 and 8. 2 ng/g l. w. respectively. ΣPBDE levels increase in human milk samples collected at three different time points (1987 - 1999), mainly due to increasing BDE- 153 concentrations. The range of serum ΣPBDE concentrations in mothers and children are similar, although the congener patterns show differences. BDE- 47 is the dominant congener in maternal serum, while BDE- 153 is the major congener in children. The differences seen in PBDE congener patterns may arise differences in dates of sampling (7 years) for the two populations, maternal serum sampled in 1994 - 95 and children serum sampled in 2000 - 01, rather than from differences in uptake/metabolism or in contemporary exposures. PCB concentrations in fulmars and pilot whales show similar ranges. In contrast, PBDE concentrations are 100 times higher in pilot whales than in fulmars. Consequently, Faroese may be especially exposed to PCBs via consumption of fulmars and fulmar eggs, while the exposure to PBDEs is less pronounced. Results from this thesis highlight the pronounced exposures to PCBs, OH-PCBs, and PBDEs among residents of the Faroe Islands, a remote region in the Northern Atlantic far away from industrial and urban sources of pollution...|$|E

40|$|Operation of Unmanned Air Vehicles (UAVs) has {{increased}} significantly {{over the past}} few years. However, routine operation in non-segregated airspace remains a challenge, primarily due to nature of the environment and restrictions and challenges that accompany this. Currently, tight human control is envisaged as a means to achieve the oft quoted requirements of transparency, equivalence and safety. However, the problems of high cost of human operation, potential communication losses and operator remoteness remain as obstacles. One means of overcoming these obstacles is to devolve authority, from the ground controller to an on-board system able to understand its situation and make appropriate decisions when authorised. Such an on-board system is known as an Autonomous System. The nature of the autonomous system, how it should be designed, when and how authority should be transferred and in what context can they be allowed to control the vehicle are the general motivation for this study. To do this, the system must overcome the negative aspects of differentiators that exist between UASs and manned aircraft and introduce methods to achieve required increases in the levels of versatility, cost, safety and performance. The general thesis of this work is that the role and responsibility of an airborne autonomous system are sufficiently different from those of other conventionally controlled manned and unmanned systems to require a different architectural approach. Such a different architecture will also have additional requirements placed upon it in order to demonstrate acceptable levels of Transparency, Equivalence and Safety. The architecture for the system is developed from an analysis of the basic requirements and adapted from a consideration of other, suitable candidates for effective control of the vehicle under devolved authority. The best practices for airborne systems in general are identified and amalgamated with established principles and approaches of robotics and intelligent agents. From this, a decision architecture, capable of interacting with external human agencies such as the UAS Commander and Air Traffic Controllers, is proposed in detail. This architecture has been implemented and a number of further lessons can be drawn from this. In order to understand in detail the system safety requirements, an analysis of manned and unmanned aircraft accidents is made. Particular interest is given to the type of control moding of current unmanned aircraft {{in order to make a}} comparison, and prediction, with accidents likely to be caused by autonomously controlled vehicles. The effect of pilot remoteness on the accident rate is studied and a new classification of <b>this</b> <b>remoteness</b> is identified as a major contributor to accidents A preliminary Bayesian model for unmanned aircraft accidents is developed and results and predictions are made as an output of this model. From the accident analysis and modelling, strategies to improve UAS safety are identified. Detailed implementations within these strategies are analysed and a proposal for more advanced Human-Machine Interaction made. In particular, detailed analysis is given on exemplar scenarios that a UAS may encounter. These are: Sense and Avoid, Mission Management Failure, Take Off/Landing, and Lost Link procedures and Communications Failure. These analyses identify the nature of autonomous, as opposed to automatic, operation and clearly show the benefits to safety of autonomous air vehicle operation, with an identifiable decision architecture, and its relationship with the human controller. From the strategies and detailed analysis of the exemplar scenarios, proposals are made for the improvement of unmanned vehicle safety The incorporation of these proposals into the suggested decision architecture are accompanied by analysis of the levels of benefit that may be expected. These suggest that a level approaching that of conventional manned aircraft is achievable using currently available technologies but with substantial architectural design methodologies than currently fielded. ©Cranfield University © BAE System...|$|E
40|$|International audienceAccording to the {{mainstream}} literature in economic geography, agglomeration economies are so powerful drivers for polarization in the larger metro areas that a center-periphery pattern is almost inescapable, making any peripheral location clearly disadvantageous for firms (Dicken and Lloyd, 1992; Fujita and Thisse, 2003). Urban studies also support such views by demonstrating the growing, steadily trend towards metropolization. However these statements are not fully confirmed by some empirical results. Indeed the stated entrepreneurs’ locational preferences of firms localized in medium-sized (and even small) cities situated in peripheral areas do not always meet these theoretical interpretations. Innovative entrepreneurs and successful companies are usual in such locations, making necessary to explain such unexpected location choices {{and how they can}} be successful despite their so-called locational constraints due both to their remote position in badly connected peripheries (as demonstrated by population and economic potential models at the national and European scales) and to the lack of localized external economies of scale. To enlighten such apparently irrational business location choices, we could refer to the behavioural approach (Pred, 1967) as the perception of the quality of location characteristics has been neglected by the literature (Eickelpasch and al., 2015). Indeed the mental maps of the peripheral entrepreneurs –as revealed by our survey– do not exhibit the same perception of their working-area as expected from the theoretical works that consider peripheral locations are damaging due to various backwash effects (Myrdal, 1957; Haggett, 1979). As it has often been established by numerous surveys, the first locational factor of SMEs is often the birthplace of their manager, especially for family-owned companies, considering that entrepreneurial spirit is often more common in areas dominated by small firms (Baudelle and Ollivro, 2000; Ejermo and Hansen, 2015). Therefore the rationale of their location choice does not necessarily match the requisites of profit maximization. But despite this kind of path dependency due to the faithfulness of these entrepreneurs to their native region, we need to understand how such firms can be innovative and therefore successful notwithstanding their non- optimal location in small and medium-sized cities of peripheral areas. At this point we need another theoretical framework, namely the institutional approach (Granovetter, 1973). This perspective is required to explain why and how entrepreneurs can be successful in spite of their non-metropolitan location in modest cities situated far not only from the core of Europe but also from the national and sub-national metropolises. More specifically our study mobilizes the sociology of networks (Krauss, 2011 & 2013) to explain the paradoxical success-stories of peripheral firms. Such an approach is congruent with the evolutionary perspective that is paying more and more attention (but not so much) to networks and institutions as parts of complex adaptative systems to explain regional resilience (Boschma, 2015). Therefore our theoretical assumption is the following: professional networks and personal networking are crucial for these companies and their managers to give them access to various kinds of resources that are necessary to run their business. This is consistent with the theory striking the need for embeddeness among the entrepreneurs to make them possible to run their business with success (Granovetter, 1973; Krauss, Sternberg, 2014). The final goal of the study is to understand how the access to various informational and human resources is made possible by the construction of networks used by innovating companies to develop their business. Consequently the objective is to identify the configuration of the networks –strong or weak, local or distant, central or peripheral– of the interviewed entrepreneurs to understand their possible role in their success stories. The field-study area is a corridor along the Southern Brittany Coast (France). In this area of about 939 000 inhab., there is no large metropolis. The three main cities (Lorient, Quimper, Vannes) are simply medium-sized cities: their built-up areas have respectively 115 000, 80 000 and 75 000 inhab. only and their travel-to-work areas 180 000, 120 000 and 135 000 people. Outside them, only small cities can be found. Moreover these cities are far from the rest of France and Europe and even from the larger metro area in Western France, Nantes (622 000 inh.), which is more than 3 hours away by car from Western Brittany and even 4 hour and a half by train. Even from the closest city (Vannes) the journey to Nantes requires more than 2 hours. Paris, the national capital-city, remains from 3 h 30 to 6 h 30 away by train. Some local domestic airports compensate <b>this</b> <b>remoteness</b> but not totally and with a high flight cost due to monopolies. As a result this area is a typical periphery, far from the metropolitan engines of the globalizing economy. The French division of labour between Paris metro area and the province even worsens the gap between the Breton Western periphery and the French World City. To understand how the entrepreneurs overcome such a physical distance, a sample of about 20 successful business leaders were interviewed (Marinos, 2015). The selected companies (mainly SMEs) are deliberately very competitive ones: they are intensive in technology, exhibit a high level of innovation (as demonstrated by the number of patents) allowing high added values and significant export rates, they attract international investors and look for clients and suppliers all around the world. The objective {{of the study was to}} evaluate how important the networks are to compensate the possible theoretical locational constraints due to peripheral sites (Krauss, 2009). The literature often points out the possible negative locking effects of excessive local inward-looking ties, suggesting a trade-off between immediate adaptation and later adaptability (Grabher, 1993; Boschma and Frenken, 2010; Braun and Schulz, 2012; Boschma, 2015). However our study shows clearly that such a distinction between strong local, proximate connections and weak, outward-looking networks does not fit with our empirical results, which leads to reconsider the present literature about the connectedness of entrepreneurs working in peripheries seen as so-called autarkic and poorly connected places. The survey reveals that the entrepreneurs do not ignore the drawbacks of peripheral locations. However the professionals met for the survey express great satisfaction about their business in Southern Brittany. The participation of three quarters of them in local networks (business associations, chambers of commerce, development agencies [...] .) is presented as necessary for their business development process, and even crucial during the start-up stage. It allows them to open up to their immediate environment and to enhance their external visibility. Belonging to a network also improves their collective capacity for concerted actions. Doing so, entrepreneurs become more audible by politicians and influence local public policies. Small and medium-sized cities are perceived as a favorable ground to confident relationships even if that kind of links rarely exceeds the TTWA boundaries. Local political staff and administration are more easily approachable and quicker to react than in bigger cities. More surprisingly, these employers are involved in the local economic life even if their clients are not local. The more entrepreneurs operate on the globalized market, the more they express that need for local commitment: “my company needs roots to have wings”. The local territory acts as a medium between stakeholders: “partnerships, collaborations, it is first and foremost a human-based process”. A collaborative way of working is considered essential. The importance of trusting is at the heart of networks' efficiency because it facilitates the exchanges and improves the flow of information. The information quality control is operated by network members. Immaterial resources access constitutes a favorable ground for entrepreneur’s social capital. Thisaccess opportunity participates to the process of innovation. Therefore mutual trust can be regarded as an implicit knowledge transmission accelerator that fosters innovation. Higher education (including alumni associations) is complementarily highly structuring for entrepreneurs’ networks, offering good opportunities to develop sustainable partnerships. When they exist, links with experts and academic researchers are sustainable and lead to success. These relations take time and depend on the leader’s background. They vary a lot according to how long the company has been based on the territory. However most of the local research fields are different from those which are of interest to local companies to such an extent that some companies prefer working with metropolitan research organizations, particularly for those which operate in niche activities. In terms of cooperation, employers display a very pragmatic behavior: they get to the closest companies, sometimes even at the expense of the quality of the resource. Geographic proximity fosters working together, a round trip in the afternoon being considered as the symbolic border. This is particularly true for interpersonal networks, restricted to everyday life territory. But for commercial partnerships there is no geographic border. Eventually these networks are helpful to overcome some challenges such as hiring talented employees or getting a convenient job for their partners in small TTWAs. But they do not solve all the usual problems the peripheral entrepreneurs face to such as good air connectivity within an hour drive (“If the airport closes, I leave”). Moreover the companies operating in specialized activities or in a niche productions do suffer from the lack of dense sectorial networks, generating a feeling of isolation. This can impact the open innovation process and even inhibit the organization of events supposed to provide new interactions. Finally the network approach helps to understand why companies located in peripheral areas do not move towards larger central metro areas despite of their locational disadvantage underlined by the neoclassic locational theory...|$|E
40|$|Alternative {{music was}} a {{cultural}} practice, {{which became a}} significant feature of New Zealand's local and national history {{over the last two}} decades of the twentieth century. Features of technology, economics and music culture influenced the creation and course of local independent music scenes, along with factors such as cultural <b>remoteness.</b> <b>This</b> thesis isolates and collates key factors and time periods of international music industry history, and refracts the information through alternative music in general, providing a coherent definition of the term. The history and definitions of New Zealand's alternative music history are then assessed for the period 1981 - 2001, with especial reference to the Flying Nun label and 'Dunedin Sound'...|$|R
40|$|Endemic {{cretinism}} {{is one of}} {{the earliest}} recorded ecological disorders of mankind. The first recorded description of endemic cretinism and goitre is pictorial, a Buddha frieze (second century A. D.) from Gandara, India, which depicts a short, goitrous, deaf subject with the typical physiognomic features of cretinism (1). Yet, after so many years, as we stand on the threshold of a new millennium, debate still continues as to the pathogenesis of <b>this</b> disorder. The <b>remoteness</b> of most endemias {{has been one of the}} major factors which has hindered progress in the understanding of this complex disorder and, as a consequence, modern clinical methods using multidisciplinary teams have, until recently, rarely been applied to its investigation.

30|$|The design {{principles}} for TCPGs originated from traditional Chinese culture and literature of Dao (Han 2012; Zou 2013), which applauds a systematic view that nature {{is a whole}} cosmos and that everything {{is a part of}} it. Zhuangzi, who is the key figure in Daoism, suggested they evoked a transcendental spiritual freedom after achieving the state of forgetting both self and one’s surroundings (Zhuangzi 365 286 Bc). Designers of these gardens were mostly scholars and artists, who were willing to create a small peaceful space in an urban plan where the experience of nature was celebrated (Wu 1963). For this reason, the actual area of the TCPG was usually relative small, but by creating wandering pathway, visitors were led to feel that they were in a large scale space, and at one with nature. From the perspective of Feng Shui, <b>this</b> meandering <b>remoteness,</b> formed by the natural topography as well as the cosmological spatial-numerical diagram, emphases a zigzagging movement. These places simulate remote environments where people could easily get lost, but gain happiness and virtue from their experience and process of discovery. In these gardens pathways often led to remote destinations, suggesting the passage of a lifelong journey (Zou 2013).|$|R
40|$|Passive {{acoustic}} monitoring (PAM) {{has emerged}} as a highly efficient technology to conduct long-term monitoring of marine mammals at species dependent, local to basin scales, providing valuable new insights into species distributions and migration patterns. To study Antarctic mammals, we deployed up to ten moored, autonomous acoustic recorders in the Atlantic sector of the Southern Ocean. Due to <b>this</b> region’s <b>remoteness,</b> challenging accessibility, and ensuing logistic constraints, especially during winter, recording devices were/are deployed for two years or longer, resulting in high demands on their power efficiency and storage capability. Two types of recorders, AURAL and MARU, which were deployed in March 2008 and December 2008, respectively, were recovered in December 2010. More recently, a set of eight, newly developed recorders (SONOVAULT), were deployed in December 2010, and are scheduled for recovery in December 2012. While in-situ recordings are hence available for AURAL and MARU, for SONOVAULTs extensive laboratory tests have been performed. Based on these recordings, this paper provides a user-based comparison of these three types of acoustic recorders, discussing their technical specifications and limitations (including recent enhancements) along with their actual performance and data quality. The paper concludes with a discussion of future needs for long-term monitoring applications along with each instrument’s potential to meet such requirements...|$|R
