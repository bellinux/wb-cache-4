However, West was seldom seen in subsequent seasons. He explained the reasons for not appearing on the show later: [...] "You know, the amount of backlash I got from it is when I decided to not be on the show anymore. And it's not that I have an issue with the show; I just have an issue with the amount of backlash that I get." [...] He also criticized the show for its cinematography and further complained about <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>how</b> the show is filmed.

In 1986, Madonna told Company magazine, that although she did not write or create the song, the lyrical meaning and concept did apply to her situation at that point of time. She elaborated, [...] "I'm very career-oriented. You are attracted {{to people who are}} ambitious that way, too, like in the song 'Material Girl'. You are attracted to men who have material things because that's what pays the rents and buys you furs. That's the security. That lasts longer than emotions." [...] During a 2009 interview with Rolling Stone, Madonna was asked by interviewer Austin Scaggs, regarding her first feelings, after listening to the demos of [...] "Like a Virgin" [...] and [...] "Material Girl". Madonna responded by saying, [...] "I liked them both because they were ironic and provocative at the same time but also unlike me.

500|$|Wright was {{prompted}} {{to publish the}} book after two incidents of his text, which had been prepared some years earlier, being used without attribution. He had allowed his table of meridional parts {{to be published by}} Thomas Blundeville in his Exercises (1594) and in William Barlow's The Navigator's Supply (1597), although only Blundeville acknowledged Wright by name. However, an experienced navigator, believed to be Abraham Kendall, borrowed a draft of Wright's manuscript and, unknown to him, made a copy of it which he took on Sir Francis Drake's 1595 expedition to the West Indies. In 1596 Kendall died at sea. The copy of Wright's work in his possession was brought back to London and wrongly believed to be by Kendall, until the Earl of Cumberland passed it to Wright and he recognised it as his work. Also around this time, the Dutch cartographer Jodocus Hondius borrowed Wright's draft manuscript for a short time after promising not to publish its contents without his permission. However, Hondius then employed Wright's calculations without acknowledging him for several regional maps and in his world map published in Amsterdam in 1597. This map {{is often referred to as}} the [...] "Christian Knight Map" [...] for its engraving of a Christian knight battling sin, the flesh and the Devil. Although Hondius sent Wright a letter containing a faint apology, Wright condemned Hondius's deceit and greed in the preface to Certaine Errors. He wryly commented: [...] "But <b>the</b> <b>way</b> <b>how</b> this [...] should be done, I learned neither of Mercator, nor of any man els. And in that point I wish I had beene as wise as he in keeping it more charily to myself".|$|E

Thanks to this situation, we can see both characters develop in a way that won't turn into a mindless sequence where Kazuto pretends to be a woman; thus destroying any distractions that would prevent the show's plot from moving forward." [...] In a review of the first Blue-Ray disc of the Sword Art Online II anime, Theron Martin of Anime News Network praised Sinon as a [...] "strong female co-lead", noting how unlike the other recurring female characters of the franchise, she is the only one not defined by her relationship with Kirito, but rather an incident from her past.|$|E
2500|$|Adorno's {{reputation}} as a musicologist has been in steady decline since his death. [...] His sweeping criticisms of jazz and championing of the Second Viennese School in opposition to Stravinsky have caused him {{to fall out of}} favour. [...] The distinguished American scholar Richard Taruskin declared Adorno to be [...] "preposterously over-rated." [...] The eminent pianist and critic Charles Rosen saw Adorno's book The Philosophy of New Music as [...] "largely a fraudulent presentation, a work of polemic that pretends to be an objective study." [...] Even a fellow Marxist such as the historian and jazz critic Eric Hobsbawm saw Adorno's writings as containing [...] "some of the stupidest pages ever written about jazz". The British philosopher Roger Scruton saw Adorno as producing [...] "reams of turgid nonsense devoted to showing that the American people are just as alienated as Marxism requires them to be, and that their cheerful life-affirming music is a ‘fetishized’ commodity, expressive of their deep spiritual enslavement to the capitalist machine." [...] Irritation with Adorno's tunnel vision started even while he was alive. [...] He may have championed Schoenberg, but the composer notably failed to return the compliment: [...] "I {{have never been able to}} bear the fellow [...] It is disgusting, by <b>the</b> <b>way,</b> <b>how</b> he treats Stravinsky." [...] On the other hand, the scholar Slavoj Žižek has written a foreword to Adorno's In Search of Wagner, where Žižek attributes an [...] "emancipatory impulse" [...] to the same book, although Žižek suggests that fidelity to this impulse demands [...] "a betrayal of the explicit theses of Adorno's Wagner study." ...|$|E
