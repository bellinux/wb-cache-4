5|$|Another fountain, {{sometimes}} {{also known}} as the Wignacourt Fountain, was built close to Porta Reale in Valletta attached to the Ferreria building (demolished). It consists of a lion's head pouring out water into a stone basin, topped by the coat of arms of Wignacourt and the Order and surrounded by a garland of flowers and interlocking seashells. Below the coats of arms is a radiating sun with the inscription Omnibus Idem (meaning <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>to</b> all), indicating that the water was freely available to everyone.|$|E
5|$|At the Pfullendorf heights, {{the fight}} began anew. Charles sent two strong columns of eight battalions each across the Ostrach stream. The French poured {{fire on the}} Austrians, who took heavy losses, but did not give up the ground. In the night, Fürstenberg broke through the French line to Einhard, {{flanking}} Jourdan's main force and cutting off Saint Cyr. Further south, Wallis threatened to do <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>to</b> Fontaine and Ferino. As darkness fell, so ended {{the first day of}} fighting.|$|E

Worried that he is doing <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>to</b> his own children, he fires Tina, Gene and Louise and encourages them to enjoy their summer vacation. In their place, he hires newly released bank robber Mickey, whom the family had previously befriended, to do various jobs around the restaurant, in exchange for free meals and shelter in the basement.|$|E

5|$|During the Confederate {{incursion}} {{into the}} North in mid-1863 {{that culminated in}} the Battle of Gettysburg, Confederates twice sent parties to Stevens's Caledonia Forge. Stevens, who had been there supervising operations, was hastened away by his workers against his will. General Jubal Early looted and vandalized the Forge, causing a loss to Stevens of about $80,000. Early said that the North had done <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>to</b> southern figures, and that Stevens was well known for his vindictiveness towards the South.

5|$|NY28 was {{originally}} assigned in 1924 to an alignment extending from Colliersville {{in the south}} to Utica in the north via Ilion. From Colliersville to Cooperstown, the highway followed its current routing (excluding minor realignments); north of Cooperstown, NY28 was routed along several state highways that now have other designations. The route was extended south to Kingston and north to Warrensburg as part of the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York. At the same time, NY28 was realigned between Cooperstown and Mohawk to follow its modern routing.

With Dr. Crick in custody, Walter learns that the man had worked in aerospace to find an alloy for fighter craft.

Alisandros expects <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>to</b> happen again: the lawsuits {{from all over the}} U.S. would be concentrated in South Florida, with a federal judge which Alisandros considers amendable; Varrick would negotiate, reach again a settlement out of court and everybody will grow rich.|$|E

5|$|A {{state of}} civil {{disorder}} {{existed in the}} island's mountainous region after {{the invasion of the}} United States. The local Criollo, who now found themselves unemployed and felt that they had been exploited by their former employers, formed bands called 'Partidas". The Partidas, at first attacked and robbed many of the wealthy plantation owners, who were loyal to the Spanish Crown, in vengeance, however they later began to attack the businesses owned by the local natives. One of the most notable leaders of the Partidas was José Maldonado Román a.k.a. 'Aguila Blanca". Maldonado, who operated in the areas of Juana Díaz and Ponce, harassed the Spanish Civil Guard and later did <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>to</b> the American Forces. Another factor contributing to the state of civil disorder on the island was the lack of discipline of the American troops who were stationed on the island. These troops were not professional soldiers and were composed of volunteers. Many instances were reported where these men would act disorderly, under the influence of alcohol, and get into fights with the local residents. The state of civil disorder came to a halt on the island after the military government began to rebuild Puerto Rico's infrastructure, thereby providing employment for many of the discontented and unemployed population, and when the volunteer troops were replaced by the regular Army.|$|E
5|$|Although Allosaurus {{may have}} hunted in packs, {{it has been}} argued that Allosaurus and other theropods had largely {{aggressive}} interactions instead of cooperative interactions with other members of their own species. The study in question noted that cooperative hunting of prey much larger than an individual predator, as is commonly inferred for theropod dinosaurs, is rare among vertebrates in general, and modern diapsid carnivores (including lizards, crocodiles, and birds) rarely cooperate to hunt in such a way. Instead, they are typically territorial and will kill and cannibalize intruders of the same species, and will also do <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>to</b> smaller individuals that attempt to eat before they do when aggregated at feeding sites. According to this interpretation, the accumulation of remains of multiple Allosaurus individuals at the same site, e.g. in the Cleveland–Lloyd Quarry, are not due to pack hunting, but to the fact that Allosaurus individuals were drawn together to feed on other disabled or dead allosaurs, and were sometimes killed in the process. This could explain the high proportion of juvenile and subadult allosaurs present, as juveniles and subadults are disproportionally killed at modern group feeding sites of animals like crocodiles and Komodo dragons. The same interpretation applies to Bakker's lair sites. There is some evidence for cannibalism in Allosaurus, including Allosaurus shed teeth found among rib fragments, possible tooth marks on a shoulder blade, and cannibalized allosaur skeletons among the bones at Bakker's lair sites.|$|E
5|$|Blackwood's {{attack was}} so {{successful}} that by dawn on 31 March Guillaume Tell had lost its main and mizen topmasts and its main yard, considerably reducing {{the speed at which}} Decrés could travel. The French ship had also suffered heavy casualties in the exchange, but Penelope had lost only one man killed and three wounded, and was almost undamaged. British reinforcements were now arriving from the south: the 64-gun HMS Lion under Captain Dixon had received Minorcas warning at 01:00 and immediately sailed in pursuit, sending the brig on to Captain Sir Edward Berry in HMS Foudroyant, who lay some distance to leeward. By 05:00, Dixon was close enough to engage, passing between Penelope and Guillaume Tell and firing a triple-shotted broadside into the port side of the French ship. Shooting ahead of the now sluggish Guillaume Tell, Lion crossed its opponent's bows and shot away the jib boom, allowing Dixon to maintain a position across the bow, raking the French ship from one end while Penelope did <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>to</b> the other. During these manoeuvres, Dixon's ship had briefly become entangled with Guillaume Tells rigging, and two determined efforts to board the British ship had been driven off as the ships were disentangled.|$|E
