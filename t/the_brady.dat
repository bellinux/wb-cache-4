5|$|Sometimes {{referred}} to as <b>the</b> <b>Brady</b> bill loophole, <b>the</b> <b>Brady</b> law loophole, the gun law loophole, or the private sale loophole, the term refers to a perceived gap in laws that address what types of sales and transfers of firearms require records and or background checks, such as <b>the</b> <b>Brady</b> Handgun Violence Prevention Act. Private-parties are not legally required by federal law to: ask for identification, complete any forms, or keep any sales records, {{as long as the}} sale does not cross state lines and does not fall under purview of the National Firearms Act. In addition to federal legislation, firearm laws vary by state.|$|E

30|$|At <b>the</b> <b>Bradys</b> {{geothermal}} field, a 3 D geologic {{model was}} generated using multiple geoscience datasets, which included: (1) geological and structural mapping, (2) interpreted seismic sections, and (3) geological well logs (Faulds et al. 2012 and unpublished mapping; Siler and Faulds 2013; Siler et al. 2016 b). Uncertainties in the 3 D geologic model exist because: (A) {{most of the}} well control is restricted to <b>the</b> <b>Bradys</b> fault zone and (B) some of the surface geology and structure is obscured by alluvial cover. Faulds et al. (2010 a) described specific challenges in geothermal exploitation at <b>the</b> <b>Bradys</b> geothermal field that arise due to uncertainty in the relationships between subsurface geology, structure, and fluid transmissivity.

5|$|The Simpson Family Smile-Time Variety Hour is {{a parody}} of the 1960s and 1970s live variety shows. Mainly it is {{a parody of}} <b>The</b> <b>Brady</b> Bunch Hour, a {{short-lived}} spin-off of the 1970s sitcom <b>The</b> <b>Brady</b> Bunch. The replacement of Lisa in the third segment with another girl reflects the recasting of Jan Brady in <b>the</b> <b>Brady</b> Bunch Hour when Eve Plumb refused to participate. The Simpson family is {{made to look like}} The Partridge Family. Also, the segment holds numerous references to Laugh-In. Kent Brockman introduces the show from inside a broadcast booth in a style similar to Laugh-In, there is a joke wall similar to the one in Laugh-In where The Sea Captain opens a porthole. There is also a Laugh-In-like montage wherein other characters comment on the skit itself. When Hans Moleman reads a poem, it is based on Henry Gibson reading a poem on Laugh-In. Other shows parodied during the variety show include The Sonny and Cher Comedy Hour, and The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour.|$|E

The initial 3 D model of Bradys by Jolie et al. (2015) {{was followed by}} more detailed modeling by Siler et al. (2016 a). <b>The</b> <b>Bradys</b> 3 D geologic model was constructed based on 1 : 24, 000 scale geologic mapping (Faulds et al. 2012), stratigraphy interpreted from the mapping and lithologic analyses of cuttings and core from 21 wells, interpretation of four seismic reflection profiles, and construction of four detailed geologic cross-sections. <b>The</b> <b>Bradys</b> geologic framework {{is characterized by a}} highly faulted Oligocene to Quaternary ~ 1500 -m-thick stratigraphic section of interfingering and discontinuous mafic to intermediate composition lava flows, ash flow tuffs, and various sedimentary units including siltstone, diatomite, and limestone (Faulds et al. 2012). The fault relationships in the area are complex. The Tertiary units within <b>the</b> <b>Bradys</b> geothermal field generally dip gently to moderately southeast on the western limb of an extensional syncline. Normal displacement on <b>the</b> northeast-striking, northwest-dipping <b>Bradys</b> fault zone accommodated the southeast tilting of fault blocks (Faulds et al. 2010 a, b). <b>The</b> <b>Bradys</b> fault zone is manifest as a set of the north- to northeast-striking west- to west-northwest-dipping, anastomosing normal fault strands. In addition to these primary fault strands, the ~ 1 -km-wide left step-over in <b>the</b> <b>Bradys</b> fault zone consists of several secondary faults and fault segments oblique to the primary strike of the fault zone (Faulds et al. 2010 a, 2012; Siler and Faulds 2013; Siler et al. 2016).|$|R

30|$|In this study, we use gravity data to test an {{existing}} 3 D geologic model of <b>the</b> <b>Bradys</b> geothermal field in west-central Nevada, USA. To achieve this, we performed 3 D geophysical inversion modeling of the gravity data in three ways: (1) fully unconstrained (i.e., no geologic data included); (2) {{constrained by the}} 3 D geologic model using homogeneous rock unit densities, and (3) constrained by the 3 D geologic model using heterogeneous rock unit densities. We tested the existing 3 D geologic model based upon our present (limited) understanding of rock densities in <b>the</b> <b>Bradys</b> geothermal study area. Despite this limitation, we show that the existing 3 D geologic model of <b>the</b> <b>Bradys</b> area is broadly consistent with the gravity data. Further work is needed to better quantify rock densities to facilitate a more rigorous analysis and update of the existing 3 D geologic model and geophysical interpretations.|$|R

Turner earned further income by appearing on shows such as The Hollywood Squares, Donny and Marie, The Sonny & Cher Show and <b>The</b> <b>Brady</b> Bunch Hour. Later in 1977, Turner headlined her first solo concert tour, throughout Australia. In 1978, United Artists released Turner's third solo album, Rough, with distribution both in North America and Europe with EMI.
