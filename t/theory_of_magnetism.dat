But the phenomena now described, {{in conjunction with the}} confidence we may reasonably repose in M. Ampère's <b>theory</b> <b>of</b> <b>magnetism,</b> tend to throw doubt on such cases; for if magnetism depend upon the attraction of electrical currents, and if the powerful currents at first excited, both by volta-electric and magneto-electric induction, instantly and naturally cease (12. 28. 47.), causing at the same time an entire cessation of magnetic effects at the galvanometer needle, then there can be little or no expectation that any substances not partaking of the peculiar relation in which iron, nickel, and one or two other bodies, stand, should exhibit magneto-attractive powers. It seems far more probable, that the extremely feeble permanent effects observed have been due to traces of iron, or perhaps some other unrecognised cause not magnetic.|$|E

Laughlin and D. Pines were developed and discussed. This was done by considering the idea of quantum protectorate {{in the context of}} quantum <b>theory</b> <b>of</b> <b>magnetism.</b> It was suggested that the difficulties in the formulation of quantum <b>theory</b> <b>of</b> <b>magnetism</b> at the microscopic level, that are related to the choice of relevant models, can be understood better {{in the light of the}} QP concept. It was argued that the difficulties in the formulation of adequate microscopic models of electron and magnetic properties of materials are intimately related to dual, itinerant and localized behaviour of electrons. A criterion of what basic picture describes best this dual behaviour was formulated. The main suggestion was that quasi-particle excitation spectra might provide distinctive signatures and good criteria for the appropriate choice of the relevant model. The concepts of broken symmetry, quantum protectorate, and Bogoliubov's quasi-averages were analyzed in the context of quantum <b>theory</b> <b>of</b> <b>magnetism</b> and theory of superconductivity.|$|E

40|$|We {{recently}} reported {{the observation of}} room temperature ferromagnetism in mixtures of ZnO and Co 3 O 4 despite the diamagnetic and antiferromagnetic character of these oxides respectively. Here we present a detailed study on the electronic structure of this material in order to account for this unexpected ferromagnetism. Electrostatic interactions between both oxides lead to a dispersion of Co 3 O 4 particles {{over the surface of}} ZnO larger ones. As a consequence, the reduction of Co+ 3 to Co 2 + at the particle surface takes place as evidenced by XAS measurements and optical spectrocopy.
