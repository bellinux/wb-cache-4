They included the mathematician Luca Pacioli, with whom he collaborated on the book De divina proportione in the 1490s. Leonardo appears to have had no close relationships with women except for his friendship with Cecilia Gallerani and the two Este sisters, Beatrice and Isabella. While on a journey that took him through Mantua, he drew a portrait of Isabella <b>that</b> <b>appears</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> been {{used to create a}} painted portrait, now lost.|$|E
5|$|Surveys have {{revealed}} {{an average of}} 436 structures per square kilometer (1118 per square mile) in the site core, falling to 244 structures/km² (626/square mile) in the periphery. At its height in the Late Preclassic, the population has been estimated at 1600 in the site core with a further 8000 dispersed through the periphery, to produce an estimated total population of almost ten thousand. In the Early Classic the population suffered a severe decline, population is estimated to have dropped to 34% of peak population. In the Late to Terminal Classic the population increased to 85% of its Late Preclassic level, an expansion <b>that</b> <b>appears</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> occurred rapidly and spread to {{all parts of the}} site, perhaps as the result of an influx of refugees arriving from other sites around AD 830. This was followed by a population crash to 14% of peak Preclassic population in the Early Postclassic (AD 9001200) prior to the complete abandonment of the site.|$|E

5|$|The five-bay front facade has two flat Doric pilasters and {{two more}} pilasters, located off the central bay support the broken base pediment. The {{original}} door was replaced with a 19th-century door that has a 20-pane fanlight and is flanked by two flat pilasters that support the broken base pediment over the door. The main house originally had two-chimney design and another chimney {{was added to the}} east wall for a 20th-century furnace. Most of the windows in the house were replaced in the 19th century with 2-over-2 sash, except for two attic windows of each end of the gable which retain the smaller paned sashes. The house includes an earlier -story ell in the rear <b>that</b> <b>appears</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> been a two-room central chimney structure that was integrated into the design of the main house and built {{in the second quarter of}} the 18th century.
