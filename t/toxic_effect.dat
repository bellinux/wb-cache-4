5|$|Fruit {{bodies have}} an odour {{described}} variously as resembling garlic, radish, lemon, onion, or skunk, and taste like radish. Although some older sources report P.squarrosa as edible, the mushroom has caused several cases of poisoning. The afflicted individuals had consumed alcohol with the mushroom, then experienced vomiting and diarrhoea about ten hours later. The <b>toxic</b> <b>effect</b> {{may be due}} to the combination of eating the mushrooms and taking alcohol, although the extended time delay between consumption and symptoms suggests the mechanism of toxicity is different than the antabuse-effect experienced from Coprinopsis atramentaria with alcohol.|$|E
5|$|Kidney damage {{occurs with}} {{exposure}} {{to high levels}} of lead, and evidence suggests that lower levels can damage kidneys as well. The <b>toxic</b> <b>effect</b> of lead causes nephropathy and may cause Fanconi syndrome, in which the proximal tubular function of the kidney is impaired. Long-term exposure at levels lower than those that cause lead nephropathy have also been reported as nephrotoxic in patients from developed countries that had chronic kidney disease or were at risk because of hypertension or diabetes mellitus.|$|E
5|$|In 1934, Bennetts {{teamed with}} state {{botanist}} Charles Gardner {{to study the}} <b>toxic</b> <b>effect</b> of native plants species on sheep. Gardner would collect the plants and supply them fresh to Bennetts who would then feed them to the sheep. They confirmed 24 species of plants as being poisonous, most which were from the native pea genera Gastrolobium and Oxylobium. Based on this and later research, Gardner and Bennetts published The Toxic Plants of Western Australia in 1956. During 1935, investigations into the effects of castrating male lambs with either mechanical pincers compared to using a knife, both of these methods have since been replaced with rubber elastrator rings. The experiment on 499 sheep concluded that {{no significant differences were}} observable in respect of mortality, maturity rates and meat quality.|$|E
40|$|Aflatoxins B 1 (AFB 1), {{deoxynivalenol}} (DON), fumonisin B 1 (FB 1), T- 2 toxin (T- 2), and zearalenone (ZEA) are {{the major}} foodborne mycotoxins of public health concerns. In the present study, the multiple toxic endpoints of these naturally-occurring mycotoxins were evaluated in Caenorhabditis elegans model for their lethality, <b>toxic</b> <b>effects</b> on growth and reproduction, as well as influence on lifespan. We found that the lethality endpoint was more sensitive for T- 2 toxicity with the EC 50 at 1. 38 mg/L, the growth endpoint was relatively sensitive for AFB 1 <b>toxic</b> <b>effects,</b> and the reproduction endpoint was more sensitive for toxicities of AFB 1, FB 1, and ZEA. Moreover, the lifespan endpoint was sensitive to <b>toxic</b> <b>effects</b> of all five tested mycotoxins.

5|$|All {{members of}} Cicuta except C.bulbifera contain {{high levels of}} the {{poisonous}} principle cicutoxin, an unsaturated aliphatic alcohol that is structurally {{closely related to the}} toxin oenanthotoxin found in the plant hemlock water dropwort. Cicutoxin is present at all stages of growth and {{in all parts of the}} plant, but is most concentrated in the roots which appear to be the most toxic in the early spring. Its primary <b>toxic</b> <b>effect</b> is to act as a stimulant in the central nervous system. It is a non-competitive gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptor antagonist. Cicutoxin acts on the GABAA receptor causing a block of the chloride channel which results in neuronal depolarization. In the presence of cicutoxin this depolarization continues unabated causing cell overactivity. The hyperactivity in brain cells results in seizures. Cicutoxin is highly poisonous and water hemlock is considered one of North America's most toxic plants. Ingestion of Cicuta can be fatal in humans and there are reports in the medical literature of severe poisoning and death as early as 1670. A number of people have also died following ingestion of the plant in the 20th and 21st century.|$|E

50|$|Inhalation, {{and oral}} and dermal administration, of {{methacrylonitrile}} can cause acute deaths in animals, often preceded by convulsions {{and loss of}} consciousness. Signs of the <b>toxic</b> <b>effects</b> of methacrylonitrile in rats after oral absorption are ataxia, trembling, convulsions, mild diarrhea and irregular breathing. The main cause of <b>toxic</b> <b>effects</b> at lethal (and threshold) levels of MeAN is damage to the central nervous system. This, along with the signs of <b>toxic</b> <b>effects</b> displayed by all tested animals, is consistent with cyanide poisoning. Methacrylonitrile differs herein from acrylonitrile, which does not show cyanide related signs of toxicity.|$|R
25|$|The general {{cause of}} this disease is {{prolonged}} and heavy consumption of alcohol accompanied by a nutritional deficiency.

40|$|The {{rational}} use {{of alcohol}} by healthy persons aims to achieve some degree of intoxication—the drug effect of alcohol. A pattern of drinking that does this while minimizing the undesired <b>toxic</b> <b>effects</b> of alcohol may be inferred from {{an analysis of the}} metabolism of alcohol and the mechanisms of its <b>toxic</b> <b>effects.</b> While the intoxicant effect of alcohol depends on the quantity in the circulatory blood level, the <b>toxic</b> <b>effects,</b> particularly in the liver, depend largely on the total dose and are independent of the speed of absorption into the blood. Standards may be developed for the {{use of alcohol}}ic beverages by healthy persons, based on these considerations.

25|$|Two main hemotoxic {{effects are}} caused by {{rattlesnake}} venom. First, zinc-containing metalloproteases act upon capillary endothelial cells to cause platelet aggregation and hemorrhage. Second, the platelet antagonist crotalin creates a severe bleeding effect as it binds to the surface proteins, blocking aggregation. These two starkly different effects may seem counterproductive, but the effect should be profound. Firstly, endothelial-cell disruption causes lysis and internal bleeding. Then, as these hemorrhages increase, the natural thrombin response is hindered by the effect of crotalin increasing the <b>toxic</b> <b>effect.</b> Their observed hunting technique is a bite-and-release method, so a fast-acting toxin would be ideal. Assuming the natural median prey would be a small rodent such as a mouse, the bite would elicit a fear response, quickening heart rate and increasing blood pressure. This would speed the <b>toxic</b> <b>effect,</b> as well as spread the hemolytic and hemorrhagic effects.|$|E

Hypertensive crises are treated with anxiolytics and vasodilators. Scorpion envenomation with high morbidity and mortality is usually due to either excessive autonomic activity and cardiovascular <b>toxic</b> <b>effects</b> or neuromuscular <b>toxic</b> <b>effects.</b> Antivenom is the specific treatment for scorpion envenomation combined with supportive measures including vasodilators in patients with cardiovascular <b>toxic</b> <b>effects</b> and benzodiazepines when there is neuromuscular involvement.

40|$|Isolated hepatocytes {{incubated}} with 4 mM-cysteine lose reduced glutathione, adenine nucleotides and intracellular enzymes, thus showing extensive membrane damage. The <b>toxic</b> <b>effects</b> of cysteine are {{enhanced by}} NH 4 Cl. Lactate, ethanol and unsaturated fatty acids afford significant protection against cysteine-induced cytoxicity. Addition of catalase to the incubation medium also protected against cysteine toxicity, indicating that H 2 O 2 formed during the oxidation of cysteine {{is involved in}} the <b>toxic</b> <b>effects</b> observed. Under anaerobic conditions cysteine did not cause leakage of lactate dehydrogenase from cells, confirming that rapid autoxidation is an essential condition for development of the <b>toxic</b> <b>effects</b> of cysteine...|$|R
25|$|There {{is still}} {{controversy}} {{about the reasons}} for the development of alcoholic polyneuropathy. Some argue it {{is a direct result of}} alcohol's <b>toxic</b> <b>effect</b> on the nerves, but others say factors such as a nutritional deficiency or chronic liver disease may play a role in the development as well. This debate is ongoing and research is continuing in an effort to discover the real cause of alcoholic polyneuropathy.|$|E
25|$|Many of {{the studies}} {{conducted}} that observe alcoholic polyneuropathy in patients are often criticized for their criteria used to assess nutritional deficiency in the subjects because {{they may not have}} completely ruled out the possibility of a nutritional deficiency in the genesis of the polyneuropathy.

25|$|In addition, the {{consumption}} of alcohol {{may lead to the}} buildup of certain toxins in the body. For example, in the process of breaking down alcohol, the body produces acetaldehyde, which can accumulate to toxic levels in alcoholics.

25|$|While water-insoluble {{forms of}} {{plutonium}} such as plutonium dioxide are very {{harmful to the}} lungs, this toxicity is not relevant during a Loss Of Coolant Accident (LOCA) because plutonium is very involatile and unlikely to leave the reactor in large amounts.
