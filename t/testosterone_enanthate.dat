25|$|Strength {{improvements}} {{in the range of}} 5–20% of baseline strength, depending largely on the drugs and dose used as well as the administration period. Overall, the exercise where the most significant improvements were observed is the bench press. For almost two decades, it was assumed that AAS exerted significant effects only in experienced strength athletes. A randomized controlled trial demonstrated, however, that even in novice athletes a 10-week strength training program accompanied by <b>testosterone</b> <b>enanthate</b> at 600nbsp&mg/week may improve strength more than training alone does. This dose is sufficient to significantly improve lean muscle mass relative to placebo even in subjects that did not exercise at all. The anabolic effects of <b>testosterone</b> <b>enanthate</b> were highly dose dependent.|$|E
25|$|The adverse {{side effects}} of {{injected}} testosterone esters are generally associated with high peak levels {{in the first few}} days after an injection. Some side effects may be ameliorated by using a shorter dosing interval (weekly or every ten days instead of twice monthly with <b>testosterone</b> <b>enanthate</b> or testosterone cypionate). 100mg weekly gives a much lower peak level of testosterone than does 200mg every two weeks, while still maintaining the same total dose of androgen. This benefit must be weighed against the discomfort and inconvenience of doubling the number of injections.|$|E
25|$|The most {{commonly}} used AAS in medicine are testosterone and its various esters (but {{most commonly}} testosterone undecanoate, <b>testosterone</b> <b>enanthate,</b> testosterone cypionate, and testosterone propionate), nandrolone esters (most commonly nandrolone decanoate and nandrolone phenylpropionate), stanozolol, and metandienone (methandrostenolone). Others also available and used commonly but {{to a lesser extent}} include methyltestosterone, oxandrolone, mesterolone, and oxymetholone, as well as drostanolone propionate, metenolone (methylandrostenolone), and fluoxymesterone. Dihydrotestosterone (DHT; androstanolone, stanolone) and its esters are also notable, although they are not widely used in medicine. Boldenone undecylenate and trenbolone acetate are used in veterinary medicine.|$|E

In the patients with gonadotrophin deficiency, mean adult height was 176. 9 cm, compared with a mean mid-parental height of 176. 1 cm, and mean predicted adults heights of 174. 0 cm (Tanner-Whitehouse method) and 177. 3 cm (Bayley-Pinneau method). We conclude that this testosterone regimen allows achievement of full growth potential in such patients...|$|R

25|$|A 1996 {{randomized}} controlled trial, which involved 43 men, {{did not find}} {{an increase in the}} occurrence of angry behavior during 10 weeks of administration of <b>testosterone</b> <b>enanthate</b> at 600mg/week, but this study screened out subjects that had previously abused steroids or had any psychiatric antecedents. A trial conducted in 2000 using testosterone cypionate at 600mg/week found that treatment significantly increased manic scores on the YMRS, and aggressive responses on several scales. The drug response was highly variable. However: 84% of subjects exhibited minimal psychiatric effects, 12% became mildly hypomanic, and 4% (2 subjects) became markedly hypomanic. The mechanism of these variable reactions could not be explained by demographic, psychological, laboratory, or physiological measures.|$|E
25|$|Non-17α-alkylated {{testosterone}} derivatives such as testosterone itself, DHT, and nandrolone {{all have}} poor oral bioavailability due to extensive first-pass hepatic metabolism and hence are not orally active. A notable {{exception to this}} are AAS that are androgen precursors or prohormones, including dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), androstenediol, androstenedione, boldione (androstadienedione), bolandiol (norandrostenediol), bolandione (norandrostenedione), dienedione, mentabolan (MENT dione, trestione), and methoxydienone (methoxygonadiene) (although these are relatively weak AAS). AAS that are not orally active are used almost exclusively {{in the form of}} esters administered by intramuscular injection, which act as depots and function as long-acting prodrugs. Examples include testosterone, as testosterone cypionate, <b>testosterone</b> <b>enanthate,</b> and testosterone propionate, and nandrolone, as nandrolone phenylpropionate and nandrolone decanoate, among many others (see here for a full list of testosterone and nandrolone esters). An exception is the very long-chain ester testosterone undecanoate, which is orally active, albeit with only very low oral bioavailability (approximately 3%). In contrast to most other AAS, 17α-alkylated testosterone derivatives show resistance to metabolism due to steric hindrance and are orally active, though they may be esterified and administered via intramuscular injection as well.|$|E

40|$|Premenopausal {{women have}} a lower risk of {{coronary}} artery disease than men or postmenopausal women; estrogens are thought to contribute to this lower risk. Administration of exogenous estrogen to post-menopausal women increases plasma high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol and may reduce mortality from coronary disease in users. Although many investigations have examined the roles of estrogen in the regulation of lipoproteins in women, {{little attention has been}} directed to estrogen regulation of lipids in men. We designed a paradigm to study the role of physiological levels of estradiol (E 2) on plasma lipoproteins in healthy men. We used a GnRH antagonist, Nal-Glu, to suppress endogenous steroid hormones in healthy men. We then administered <b>testosterone</b> (T) <b>enanthate</b> (100 mg, im, weekly) to restore T levels to the baseline range, and we administered an aromatase inhibitor, testolactone (Teslac), to prevent the normal conversion of T to E 2, thereby producing a selective estrogen deficiency state in normal young men. As controls, we administered Nal-Glu and T along with placebo Teslac to a separate group of men; a third group of men received all placebo medications. We found that in men who received Nal-Glu plus T plus Teslac, E 2 levels were profoundly suppressed during treatment, whereas T levels remained in the baseline range. Plasma HDL cholesterol, particularly, the HDL 2 fraction, decreased significantly in response to the low serum E 2 level. Plasma apoprotein-AI levels also decreased significantly. Plasma LDL and triglyceride levels did not change. All hormone and lipoprotein parameters returned to baseline within 4 weeks after treatment ended. In men who received Nal-Glu plus T, plasma HDL and apoprotein-AI decreased, but these decreases did not achieve statistical significance. Only a small decrease in HDL 2 cholesterol was seen in these men. There were no hormonal or lipid changes in the placebo group. We conclude that in men, physiological levels of E 2 are important in maintaining plasma levels of HDL cholesterol, especially the HDL 2 fraction. These observations suggest that estrogen, in the amount normally produced in men, may offer some degree of protection against cardiovascular disease in males, as they do in women. ...|$|R
2500|$|... 'Depot' drug {{formulations}} {{are created}} by mixing a substance with the drug that slows its release and prolongs {{the action of the}} drug. The two primarily used forms in the United States are the testosterone esters testosterone cypionate (Depo-Testosterone) and <b>testosterone</b> <b>enanthate</b> (Delatestryl) which are almost interchangeable. <b>Testosterone</b> <b>enanthate</b> is purported to be slightly better with respect to even testosterone release, but this is probably more of a concern for bodybuilders who use the drugs at higher doses (250–1000mg/week) than the replacement doses used by transgender men (50–100mg/week). These testosterone esters are mixed with different oils, so some individuals may tolerate one better than the other. <b>Testosterone</b> <b>enanthate</b> costs more than testosterone cypionate and is more typically the one prescribed for hypogonadal males in the United States. Testosterone cypionate is more popular in the United States than elsewhere (especially amongst bodybuilders). Other formulations exist but are more difficult to come by in the United States. A formulation of injected testosterone available in Europe and the United States, testosterone undecanoate (Nebido, Aveed) [...] provides significantly improved testosterone delivery with far less variation outside the eugonadal range than other formulations with injections required only four times yearly. However, each quarterly dose requires injection of 4mL of oil which may require multiple simultaneous injections. Testosterone undecanoate is also much more expensive as it is still under patent protection. Testosterone propionate is another testosterone ester that is widely available, including in the United States, Canada, and Europe, but it is very short-acting compared to the other testosterone esters and must be administered once every 2 or 3 days, and for this reason, is rarely used.|$|E
