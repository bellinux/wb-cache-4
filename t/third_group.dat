5|$|A {{number of}} factors made escape {{attempts}} daunting for the internees. They would have to navigate through Japanese-occupied territory, find food, and as few internees spoke Cantonese, they {{would also have to}} deal with the language barrier if they succeeded in escaping. Despite these difficulties, there were three major escape attempts, of which two in March 1942 were successful. One group of eight internees escaped on a small boat to neighbouring Macau. Another group, consisting of two internees, escaped through the New Territories and into mainland China. The <b>third</b> <b>group,</b> four policemen, in April 1942 managed to escape the camp grounds but were caught within a few miles of camp. They were subsequently imprisoned and released back to camp after a few weeks.|$|E
5|$|At Euro 2000, Lokvenc made a {{substitute}} {{appearance in the}} Czech Republic's opening game against the Netherlands, replacing Pavel Nedvěd after 89 minutes as the match resulted in a 1–0 win for the Dutch. He replaced Radek Bejbl in the second group match, against France, coming on after 49 minutes in the 2–1 loss. Lokvenc appeared in the <b>third</b> <b>group</b> match against Denmark, although due to both teams having lost both of their previous matches, neither team could advance to {{the next round of}} the competition. He came on after 79 minutes, replacing Vladimír Šmicer in a 2–0 win for his nation.|$|E
5|$|Before Euro 2000, Nedvěd {{was unable}} to train {{normally}} due to an ankle injury. The Czechs' first match (against the Netherlands) saw him and international teammate Jan Koller hit the woodwork without scoring, before the Dutch scored a controversial penalty to win 1–0. In the second match, against France, he was fouled, where the resultant Czech penalty was converted by Karel Poborský to even the score at 1–1. Despite two shots on goal, Nedvěd could not beat French goalkeeper Fabien Barthez and France won the match 2–1. He played in the <b>third</b> <b>group</b> match, against Denmark; despite the Czechs' 2–0 victory, the team was eliminated from the tournament. After Euro 2000, Nedvěd took over the national team captaincy from Jiří Němec.|$|E

5|$|Collins {{has said}} that the main {{inspiration}} for The Hunger Games trilogy came from the classical account of Theseus and the Minotaur. In Greek mythology, as a punishment for the killing of King Minos's son Androgeos, Athens was forced to sacrifice seven youths and seven maidens to Crete, who were then put in the Labyrinth and killed by the Minotaur. After a while, Theseus, the son of the Athenian king, decided {{to put an end to}} the Minotaur and Minos's terror, so he volunteered to join the <b>third</b> <b>group</b> of victims, ultimately killing the Minotaur and leading his companions out of the monster's Labyrinth.|$|E
5|$|In August 1962, Chaffee {{confided in}} his family that he had {{submitted}} an application for the NASA astronaut training program, and informed his superiors he wanted to train as a test pilot for astronaut status. In mid-1962, he was accepted in the initial pool of 1,800 applicants for the <b>third</b> <b>group</b> of NASA astronauts. After his naval tour was over, and he had racked up over 1,800 hours of flying time, the Navy offered {{him the opportunity to}} continue work on his master's degree. In January 1963, he entered the U.S. Air Force Institute of Technology (AFIT) at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base in Dayton, Ohio, to work on his Master of Science degree in Reliability Engineering.|$|E
5|$|In {{his first}} {{international}} for 11 months, Torres scored a penalty in a World Cup warm-up match against Bolivia on 30 May 2014.

After substitute appearances in the team's opening two matches, Torres was named in the starting line-up for the <b>third</b> <b>group</b> match with the team's elimination already confirmed. He scored Spain's second goal in a 3–0 defeat of Australia in Curitiba.|$|E

40|$|This study {{aimed to}} {{evaluate}} the renoprotective effect of Physalis peruviana L. extract (PPE) on acute renal injury in rats. Adult male rats (n= 36) were divided into six groups that were fed with basal diet throughout the experiment (33 days). The first group was normal group, the second and the <b>third</b> <b>groups</b> were administered orally with 100 and 150 mg PPE/kg body weight (BW) respectively, the fourth group was injected intraperitoneally with 5 [*]mg/kg BW cisplatin once on the 28 th day to induced ARI, and the fifth and sixth groups were treated like the second and the <b>third</b> <b>groups</b> and were injected with cisplatin on the 28 th day. Many bioactive compounds were found in PPE. PPE did not cause any changes {{in the second and}} <b>third</b> <b>groups</b> compared to normal control group. Administration of PPE prior to cisplatin injection caused significant reduction in relative kidney weight, serum creatinine, urea, blood urea nitrogen, and significant increments in body weight, feed intake, total protein, albumin, and total globulin compared to cisplatin group. Pretreatment with PPE improved kidney histology and diminished the level of thiobarbituric acid reactive substances and enhanced other antioxidant enzymes in kidney homogenate compared to cisplatin group...|$|R
5|$|Nedvěd scored {{his first}} senior {{international}} goal in his nation's Group C match against Italy, putting the Czech Republic {{in the lead}} 1–0 after four minutes. Although Italy scored an equaliser during the first half, they were reduced to ten men and the Czech Republic scored again before half-time for a 2–1 win. Nedvěd played in the <b>third</b> <b>group</b> match, against Russia, receiving his second yellow card of the tournament as the Czechs tied 3–3 {{to advance to the}} knockout stage.|$|E
5|$|Phase one of {{training}} for the <b>third</b> <b>group</b> of astronauts began in 1964 in lecture halls. Lectures in several fields were supplemented with trips to locations with geological significance so the astronauts gained hands-on experience. In addition to piloting the spacecraft, the astronauts would also perform scientific experiments and measurements on the Moon. The astronauts traveled from the Grand Canyon to learn about geography {{all the way to}} Alaska, Iceland, and Hawaii to learn about rock formations and lava flows.|$|E
5|$|The CIA Damage Assessment Team (DAT) {{reviewed}} {{the credibility of}} all of the Agency's Soviet agents from the mid-1980s onward, then separated them into three groups: those who Ames admitted to betraying but continued providing intelligence; those whom Ames was suspected of betraying and those whom Ames' spying may have helped the Soviets identify; and the agents whom neither Ames nor Moscow uncovered. The DAT thus deemed intelligence supplied by the first group suspicious, although investigators acknowledged that it may have included genuine material as feed. The debate over the second group's bona fides proved especially contentious, while the information from the <b>third</b> <b>group</b> of agents was considered credible despite some concerns that even they may have been compromised.|$|E

5|$|The Church of England itself {{contained}} three groups. Those {{who believed}} {{the form of}} the church was just what it should be included leaders like John Jewel and Richard Hooker. A second group looked for opportunities to reintroduce some Roman Catholic practices. Under the Stuart kings they would have their chance. The <b>third</b> <b>group,</b> who came to be called Puritans, wanted to remove remaining traces of the old ways. The Stuart kings were to give them a rough passage. At the end of Elizabeth's reign, the Church of England was firmly in place, but held the seeds of future conflict.|$|E

5|$|The crew {{assignments}} for Gemini8 {{were announced}} on September 20, 1965, with Armstrong as Command Pilot and David Scott as Pilot. Scott {{was the first}} member of the <b>third</b> <b>group</b> of astronauts to receive a prime crew assignment. The mission launched on March 16, 1966; it was to be the most complex yet, with a rendezvous and docking with the unmanned Agena target vehicle, the second American extra-vehicular activity (EVA) by Scott. In total, the mission was planned to last 75 hours and 55 orbits. After the Agena lifted off at 10a.m. EST, the Titan II carrying Armstrong and Scott ignited at 11:41:02am EST, putting them into an orbit from where they would chase the Agena.|$|E
