25|$|It {{has been}} stated by Reno that their name was chosen {{due to a}} dream by Paul Dean. He {{had come up with}} the name after {{spending}} the previous night with some of the bandmates, including Reno and their girlfriends, before going to the movies. The girlfriends were browsing through fashion magazines, where <b>the</b> <b>guys</b> <b>in</b> the band saw a Cover Girl advertisement. Cover Girl became Cover Boy, and then became Loverboy in Dean's dream later that night. After being told by Dean about the dream the next morning, Reno agreed to try it out and it stuck. The group made its live debut opening for Kiss at Pacific Coliseum in Vancouver, B.C. on November 19, 1979.|$|E

500|$|Chris Young's {{streak of}} 25 {{consecutive}} road starts without a loss was broken that {{day by the}} Dodgers win. The only other pitcher in major league baseball history had gone as many as 25 straight road starts without losing — Allie Reynolds had a 25-game streak in –. [...] "I was terrible," [...] Young said. [...] "I just never found my rhythm and never found my groove. I put <b>the</b> <b>guys</b> <b>in</b> a hole {{early in the game}} and it was just too much to overcome. I can’t imagine, having to go through that, the courage it took, the discipline, and just how successful he was. I mean, he wasn’t just successful integrating the game. He was a great baseball player. He's a Hall of Fame baseball player. He wouldn’t allow himself to fail, and that's tremendous." ...|$|E

500|$|On April 5, 1967, {{the same}} day the Apollo1 {{investigation}} released its report on the fire, Armstrong assembled with 17 other astronauts for a meeting with Deke Slayton. The first thing Slayton said was, [...] "The guys who are going to fly the first lunar missions are <b>the</b> <b>guys</b> <b>in</b> this room." [...] According to Eugene Cernan, Armstrong showed no reaction to the statement. To Armstrong it came as no surprise—the room was full of veterans of Project Gemini, the only people who could fly the lunar missions. Slayton talked about the planned missions and named Armstrong to the backup crew for Apollo 9, which at that stage was planned to be a medium Earth orbit test of the Lunar Module-Command/Service Module combination. After design and manufacturing delays in the Lunar Module (LM), Apollo9 and Apollo8 swapped crews. Based on the normal crew rotation scheme, Armstrong would command Apollo11.|$|E
500|$|In a 2008 interview, Corey Taylor {{said that}} he only met Rubin four times during the entire {{recording}} process of Vol. 3: The Subliminal Verses and that Rubin barely ever showed up to the studio: [...] "...we were being charged horrendous amounts of money. And for me, if you're going to produce something, you're fucking there. I don't care who you are." [...] He also added: [...] "He is overrated, he is overpaid, and I will never work with him again." [...] Conversely, Slipknot's guitarist Jim Root had said in that same interview that [...] "A lot of <b>the</b> <b>guys</b> <b>in</b> the band say Rick was unavailable. And yeah, he takes {{on a lot of}} projects at one time, but he also does things that are beneficial. He would listen to what we'd done, then have us retrack things that needed work. He's kind of like Big Brother up on the hill. Even though he wasn't there physically every day, he was. That's my favorite record we've done." ...|$|E

A big challenge there and an enjoyable one really– maybe it helped me and <b>the</b> <b>guys</b> <b>in</b> the art department sort of prepare for the end ... we demolished it before we had to strike it completely." [...] When asked about the King's Cross scene {{near the end of the}} film, Craig said, [...] "We experimented a lot, quite honestly. I mean it was quite a protracted process really but we did experiment the sense of it being very burnt out very very kind of white– so we experimented with underlit floors, we experimented with different kind of white covering everything: white paint, white fabric, and the cameraman was involved in how much to expose it, and a series of camera tests were done, so we got there but with a great deal of preparation and research." ...|$|E

500|$|Robyn Brothers {{felt the}} line [...] "I'd break {{bread and wine}} / If there was a church I could receive in" [...] {{referenced}} feelings of spiritual alienation. She compared the song to [...] "Zooropa", stating that both reference a response to uncertainty and an unavoidable feeling of alienation. Writing for Uncut, Gavin Martin wondered if the lyric [...] "What {{are we going to}} do now it's all been said / No new ideas in the house, and every book has been read" [...] was an examination of the band's longevity, stating [...] "Bono sounded fragile, wounded, seeming even to ponder the band's usefulness." [...] He noted that it contained references to both Holy Communion and oral sex, and compared it to [...] "The Fly", noting that both songs were [...] "delivered in an amoral voice" [...] and helped to deconstruct the prevailing image of the band. Artist Gavin Friday, a childhood friend of Bono, thought the chorus line [...] "Don't let the bastards grind you down" [...] was a retaliation to the criticism of the press. Elizabeth Wurtzel of The New Yorker felt the line gave the song a political, martyr-complex. She noted that it eventually [...] "unfurls as a song about love facing the long run. It comes as a relief to discover, after all this time, that <b>the</b> <b>guys</b> <b>in</b> U2 are as hormonally charged and concerned with love as the rest of us." ...|$|E
500|$|After {{only one}} {{season at the}} Nordiques, Hextall {{was traded to the}} New York Islanders in return for Mark Fitzpatrick during the off-season, a move made because the Nordiques could only protect one goalie for the {{expansion}} draft and instead of losing him chose to trade him to Long Island. The two teams also traded first round draft picks. The move was a surprise for Hextall, who had settled in well in Quebec with his family. Don Maloney, the Islanders' General Manager, described the trade as [...] "too good to pass up". The trade was praised by The New York Times as possibly [...] "the best in the league over the off season". Hextall had a poor beginning to his career as an Islander, conceding 23goals in 14periods {{at the start of the}} season, resulting in his replacement prior to the third period against the New Jersey Devils in mid-October. During that game, in which the Islanders were playing at home, Hextall was jeered by the crowd, something to which he had become accustomed during his time with Philadelphia. In contrast to the fan's derision, Hextall's teammates backed him, taking some of the blame themselves, and expressing their belief in their new colleague. Steve Thomas suggested that Hextall was [...] "one of the best goalies in the league, easily in the top five or10," [...] while coach Al Arbour dismissed dropping Hextall, saying that [...] "We're not playing well in front of the goaltender and he can only be as good as <b>the</b> <b>guys</b> <b>in</b> front of him." [...] Any thoughts that Arbour might have had of replacing Hextall as the team's number-one goaltender were limited by the play of his back-up, Tom Draper, who recorded a GAA of4.23 in the seven NHL games he played that season. This, coupled with the lack of experienced goaltenders at the club's IHL affiliate, the Salt Lake Golden Eagles, resulted in Hextall starting 20games in a row until Jamie McLennan was called up from the Golden Eagles.|$|E
500|$|Mary Macnamara of the Los Angeles Times has {{praised the}} {{character}} highly, writing: [...] "Hahn {{is a terrific}} character, sassy and professional, with an appropriately acerbic view of the various romantic shenanigans. She {{also seems to be}} a carefully considered stand-in for viewers choking on the soapy silt of last season, a way for the writers to move forward without messing with the hugely successful brand. (Don’t get too nervous, Brooke, but the future of TV's once highest-rated drama may be in your hands.)" [...] Discussing the character in terms of her relationship with Callie Torres, AfterEllen.com were also largely positive, assessing that: [...] "The story line offered both the drama Grey's is known for and— despite some marginally exploitative threesome talk— a truthfulness network television has rarely achieved when it comes to lesbian relationships." [...] Trish Doolan and Nikki Weiss, invited by GLAAD to consult with Grey's Anatomy producers on the storyline, praised the effort put into researching the issue by the writers and actors involved, though were more negative on the scene which saw Hahn kiss Callie in an elevator in front of Mark Sloan. Weiss commented: [...] "I just felt like, if they really cared about each other, I don't think they would do that as a stunt. That seemed a little, I don't know, forced. [...] was more like a conquest, like he could have [...] too or something." [...] AfterEllen.com agreed with this view, criticizing the way the scene was edited so as to keep cutting to Mark's point of view, as though [...] "privileging the male gaze." [...] Smith, however, has refuted this interpretation, stating that; [...] "Frankly, when I played that scene, I played it as, [...] "You think that if you walked in the room and we were together, we would just be on you, but we wouldn't." [...] So that's why I kissed her. In that moment, I swear to God, when I was playing it, that's what I was thinking. You know there's a bit of a competition between all <b>the</b> <b>guys</b> <b>in</b> the boys club and my character anyway, so when that happened it was sort of like, [...] "Oh yeah, you wouldn't be intimidated, uh huh. OK, well, check this out." ...|$|E
