5|$|At {{the launch}} of the Iraq War dozens of 12-member Special Forces teams {{infiltrated}} southern and western Iraq to hunt for Scud missiles and pinpoint bombing targets. Scores of Navy SEALs seized oil terminals and pumping stations on the southern coast. Air Force combat controllers flew combat missions in MC-130H Combat Talon IIs and established austere desert airstrips to begin the flow of soldiers and supplies deep into Iraq. It {{was a far cry from}} the Persian Gulf war of 1991, where Special Operations forces were kept largely on the sidelines. But it would not be a replay of Afghanistan, where Army Special Forces and Navy SEALs led the fighting. After their star turn in Afghanistan, many special operators were disappointed to play a supporting role in Iraq. Many special operators felt restricted by cautious commanders. From that point, USSOCOM has since killed or captured hundreds of insurgents and Al-Qaeda terrorists. It has conducted several foreign internal defense missions successfully training <b>the</b> <b>Iraqi</b> <b>security</b> forces.|$|E
5|$|In August 2004, {{during the}} Iraq War, NATO formed the NATO Training Mission – Iraq, a {{training}} mission to assist <b>the</b> <b>Iraqi</b> <b>security</b> forces {{in conjunction with}} the US led MNF-I. The NATO Training Mission-Iraq (NTM-I) was established {{at the request of the}} Iraqi Interim Government under the provisions of United Nations Security Council Resolution 1546. The aim of NTM-I was to assist in the development of Iraqi security forces training structures and institutions so that Iraq can build an effective and sustainable capability that addresses the needs of the nation. NTM-I was not a combat mission but is a distinct mission, under the political control of NATO's North Atlantic Council. Its operational emphasis was on training and mentoring. The activities of the mission were coordinated with Iraqi authorities and the US-led Deputy Commanding General Advising and Training, who was also dual-hatted as the Commander of NTM-I. The mission officially concluded on 17December 2011.|$|E
5|$|On 4 February 2004, I Corps forward {{headquarters}} {{deployed to}} Iraq. The element, called Task Force Olympia, deployed to Mosul, Iraq in January 2004, where it assumed its mission from the 101st Airborne Division {{to form a}} headquarters to exercise command and control of all coalition and Iraqi forces in northern Iraq. It coordinated the efforts of both of the active Stryker Brigade Combat Teams, attached engineers, civil affairs, signal, and other supporting units as well as Iraqi security forces, eventually numbering more than 12,000. <b>The</b> <b>Iraqi</b> <b>security</b> forces included four Civil Defense Corps battalions, three Border Police battalions, several thousand members of the Iraq Facility Protection Security Forces and an Armed Forces battalion.

Two days later, American and Iraqi forces conducted a joint heliborne operation meant to show off <b>the</b> <b>Iraqi</b> <b>security</b> forces. More significantly, in late March, both Iraqi Army divisions in Anbar Province, the 1st and 7th Divisions, were sent south {{to participate in the}} Battle of Basra. Their participation helped win the battle for the government forces and showcased the major improvements to the Iraqi Army. On 26 March 2008, B Squadron of the British SAS as part of Task Force Knight were called upon to hit a terrorist bomb makers house in the early hours, after trying to call him out and receiving no response they stormed the house, they received a hail of fire and four men were wounded and a terrorist from another building joined in the firefight.

40|$|This report {{analyzes}} {{the prospects for}} rebuilding an inclusive <b>Iraqi</b> <b>security</b> force that transcends Iraq’s various ethnic and sectarian communities. U. S. policy makers and Iraqi officials aim to create a unified <b>Iraqi</b> <b>security</b> force; however, <b>the</b> predominately Sunni Arab insurgency has hampered this effort, and many believe that <b>the</b> new <b>Iraqi</b> <b>security</b> agencies will ultimately be composed of mostly Shiite and Kurdish recruits with both communities separately maintaining their own militias...|$|R

Many captured Ba'athists were torn to pieces, alive, by the angry crowds; others were burned or cut to pieces with saws.

25|$|Through {{the months}} of July and August, a series of skirmishes in and around Najaf culminated with the Imman Ali Mosque itself under siege, only to have a peace deal {{brokered}} by al-Sistani in late August. Al-Sadr then declared a national cease fire, and opened negotiations with the American and government forces. His militia was incorporated into <b>the</b> <b>Iraqi</b> <b>security</b> forces and al-Sadr is now a special envoy. This incident was the {{turning point in the}} failed American efforts to install Ahmed Chalabi as leader of the interim government. The CPA then put Iyad Allawi in power; ultimately he was only marginally more popular than Chalabi.|$|E
