2500|$|The Wolverines {{drove the}} ball to Northwestern's five-yard-line on four drives but failed to score a touchdown, having one drive halted by a holding penalty and three others stopped on downs. The Chicago Daily Tribune {{described}} Northwestern's goal-line stands as follows:"Many times the Michiganders raised the song of victory as the ball was forced under {{the shadows of the}} Northwestern posts, but before the chorus had died away the grim men in purple, fighting frantically to defend the goal, drove back the invaders and punted out of danger. [...] Then the fierce battering would begin again, Michigan would hurl its weight of muscle and sinew against the crumbling line of purple, and inch by inch the ball would travel back toward the final line; again the chant of victory would rise from the Wolverines only <b>to</b> <b>die</b> <b>away</b> in disappointment, while wild yells poured down under the fluttering ribbons of the Evanston supporters." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1908, the Austrian {{physicist}} Ottokar Tumlirz described {{careful and}} effective experiments that demonstrated {{the effect of}} the rotation of the Earth on the outflow of water through a central aperture. The subject was later popularized in a famous 1962 article in the journal Nature, which described an experiment in which all other forces to the system were removed by filling a [...] tank with [...] of water and allowing it to settle for 24 hours (to allow any movement due to filling the tank <b>to</b> <b>die</b> <b>away),</b> in a room where the temperature had stabilized. The drain plug was then very slowly removed, and tiny pieces of floating wood were used to observe rotation. During the first 12 to 15 minutes, no rotation was observed. Then, a vortex appeared and consistently began to rotate in an anticlockwise direction (the experiment was performed in Boston, Massachusetts, in the Northern Hemisphere). This was repeated and the results averaged to make sure the effect was real. The report noted that the vortex rotated, [...] "about 30,000 times faster than the effective rotation of the Earth in 42° North (the experiment's location)". This shows that the small initial rotation due to the Earth is amplified by gravitational draining and conservation of angular momentum to become a rapid vortex and may be observed under carefully controlled laboratory conditions.|$|E
2500|$|After Mill, critics {{focused on}} the ode's status among Wordsworth's other poems. In July 1877, Edward Dowden, in an article for the Contemporary Review, {{discussed}} the Transcendental Movement {{and the nature of}} the Romantic poets. when referring to Wordsworth and the ode, he claimed: [...] "Wordsworth in his later years lost, as he expresses it, courage, the spring-like hope and confidence which enables a man to advance joyously towards new discovery of truth. But the poet of 'Tintern Abbey' and the 'Ode on Intimations of Immortality' and the 'Prelude' is Wordsworth in his period of highest energy and imaginative light". Matthew Arnold, in his preface to an 1879 edition of Wordsworth's poetry, explains that he was a great lover of the poems. However, he explains why he believed that the ode was not one of the best: [...] "I have a warm admiration for Laodameia and for the great Ode; but if I am to tell the very truth, I find Laodameia not wholly free from something artificial, and the great Ode not wholly free from something declamatory." [...] His concern was over what he saw as the ideas expressed on childhood and maturity: [...] "Even the 'intimations' of the famous Ode, those corner-stones of the supposed philosophic system of Wordsworth... has itself not the character of poetic truth of the best kind; it has no real solidity" [...] "to say that universally this instinct is mighty in childhood, and tends <b>to</b> <b>die</b> <b>away</b> afterwards, is to say what is extremely doubtful... In general, we may say of these high instincts of early childhood... what Thucydides says of the early achievements of the Greek race:--'It is impossible to speak with certainty of what is so remove; but from all that we can really investigate, I should say that they were no very great things.'" ...|$|E
