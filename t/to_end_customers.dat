30|$|Practically, it is {{seen that}} the longer credit period attracts more customers. So, to {{increase}} the length of credit period increases the customers’ demand. From the literature survey on credit periods, it is studied that almost all research works have considered one manufacturer/supplier to offer the credit period to only one retailer. And there are also very few papers (Dye and Ouyang 2011) in which the retailer offers the credit period <b>to</b> <b>end</b> <b>customer</b> (consumer). In their paper, only one <b>end</b> <b>customer</b> has been considered. But, it is impractical to consider only one customer by which all items are consumed together. It is happened {{that there are many}} <b>end</b> <b>customers</b> by which items are procured from the retailer at different times during the business period and it is also observed that sometimes the retailer announces a credit period during some period <b>to</b> fascinate more <b>end</b> <b>customers.</b> But, till now no one has considered demand as a function of customer’s credit and duration of offering the credit period. In this paper, this phenomena has been incorporated.|$|R
