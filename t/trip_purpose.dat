40|$|This study aims at {{analyzing}} {{the distribution of}} tourist flows in 2014, from 25 European countries, on three main categories of <b>trip</b> <b>purposes,</b> and assumes that there are differences or similarities between the tourists’ countries of residence and their <b>trip</b> <b>purposes.</b> 	"Purpose'' is a multidimensional concept used in marketing research, most often for understanding consumer behavior, and for identifying market segments or customer target groups, reunited in terms of similar characteristics. Being aware that the decision of choice/ purchase is based on purposes, their knowledge proves useful in designing strategies to increase the satisfaction level provided to the customer. 	The statistical method used in this paper is the factorial correspondences analysis.

40|$|The {{short-term}} destination prediction problem {{consists of}} capturing vehicle Global Positioning System (GPS) traces {{and learning from}} historic locations and trajectories to predict a vehicle’s destination. Drivers have predictable trip destinations that can be estimated through probabilistic modeling of past trips. This dissertation has three main hypotheses; 1) Employing a tiered Markov model structure will permit a shorter learning period while achieving similar accuracy results, 2) The addition of derived <b>trip</b> <b>purpose</b> information will increase accuracy of the start of trip and in-route models as a whole, and 3) Similar methodologies of travel pattern inference {{can be used to}} accurately predict <b>trip</b> <b>purpose</b> and socio-economic factors. To study these concepts, a database of GPS driving traces (120 participants for 70 days) is collected. To model the user’s <b>trip</b> <b>purpose,</b> a new data source was explored: Point of Interest (POI) /land use data. An open source land use/POI dataset is merged with the GPS dataset. The resulting database includes over 20, 000 trips with travel characteristics and land use/POI data. From land use/POI data, and travel patterns, <b>trip</b> <b>purpose</b> is calculated with machine learning methods. A new model structure is developed that uses <b>trip</b> <b>purpose</b> when it is available, yet falls back on traditional spatial temporal Markov models when it is not. The start of trip model has an overall increase of accuracy over other start of trip models of 2 %. This comes quickly, needing only 30 days to reach this level of accuracy compared to nearly a year in many other models. When adding <b>trip</b> <b>purpose</b> and the start of trip model to in-route prediction methods, the accuracy of the destination prediction increases significantly: 15 - 30 % improvement of accuracy over similar models between 0 - 50 % of trip progression. Certain trips are predicted more accurately than others: work and home based trips average of 90 % correct prediction, whereas shopping and social based trips hover around the 50 % mark. In all, the greatest contribution of this dissertation is the <b>trip</b> <b>purpose</b> methodology addition and the tiered Markov model structure in gaining fast results in both the start of trip and in-route models...|$|E

The optimal tax structure for raising a given amount of government revenue is discussed for the cases where differentiation of the transport tax between <b>trip</b> <b>purposes</b> {{is and is not}} possible. Using a stylised dataset for Belgian urban enviroments, the optimal tax structure is computed. When differentiation of transport taxes between <b>trip</b> <b>purposes</b> is possible, a shift to the taxation of relative complements to leisure is observed. When differentiation is not possible, reforming transport taxes generates substantial welfare gains only when the labour tax can be simultaneously reduced. transport; externalities; congestion taxes; general equilibrium welfare effects...|$|R
40|$|AbstractGPS {{technology}} {{was used in}} person trip (PT) survey since mid- 1990, and this technology achieved its popularity because of the improvement of accuracy and portability of GPS device. Although GPS data could provide precise spatiotemporal information of vehicular or personal movements, the transportation mode (in the case of personal movements with wearable GPS devices) and <b>trip</b> <b>purpose</b> are unable to {{be obtained from the}} GPS directly. In addition, the GPS data error identification and the trip segment from the continuous GPS data are quite fundamental to transportation mode identification and <b>trip</b> <b>purpose</b> inference. In this paper, we summarized the methodologies and input variables utilized to segment trip, infer <b>trip</b> <b>purpose</b> as well as identify transportation mode in the existing researches. Compared to probability method and criteria-based method, Machine Learning are often applied in detecting transportation mode. On the other hand, rules-based methods are more popular than probabilistic method and machine learning as the tool for inferring the <b>trip</b> <b>purpose.</b> Finally, researches attempting to utilize the data from accelerometer which are popularly integrated in smartphones demonstrates the potential of more accurate personal trip data derivation from smartphones can be achieved with much less burden on the respondents in the future...|$|E

40|$|Previous {{studies of}} {{transport}} tax reform have typically {{assumed that the}} reform itself {{does not affect the}} marginal value of time. In this paper we consider a model of urban transport with two <b>trip</b> <b>purposes,</b> commuting and non-commuting, to analyse the effects of transport tax reform on the value of time and marginal external congestion costs. The theoretical results suggest that the assumption of multiple <b>trip</b> <b>purposes</b> implies that these effects are non-trivial. Consequently, assuming exogenous time values may lead to inaccurate estimates of optimal congestion taxes and of the welfare effects of transport tax reform. Empirical work using Belgian data illustrates the potentially large effect of transport tax reform on time values. In fact, the majority of the tax reform exercises studied reduce traffic levels but raise time values and marginal external congestion costs. tax reform; congestion; value of time...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe trip {{distribution}} {{is the most}} important yet the most misunderstood model in the Urban Transportation Planning Process (UTPP). One overlooked aspect is the different sensitivities in choosing the destinations based on the <b>trip</b> <b>purposes.</b> This paper proposes a framework to calibrate a doubly-constrained gravity model for the {{trip distribution}} of the city of Alexandria based on a Household Travel Survey carried out in 2002. The trip ends are estimated from the available census data. Important parameters for the trip attraction models were estimated and validated {{in the course of this}} research. Since a small sample is used, a simple, effective weighing technique is applied to mitigate the sample bias. The purpose-based dispersion parameters are estimated based on the weighted sample. The model validation is also introduced in terms of trip length distribution, intrazonal trips and the distribution of the trip interchanges between city parts. The proposed model demonstrates the different patterns of <b>trip</b> distribution per <b>purpose.</b> It also shows a considerable shift toward non-compulsory <b>trip</b> <b>purposes</b> in the city of Alexandria...|$|R

The study is meant to produce the necessary input data of a pedestrian and cyclist traffic micro model, one of the objectives of the project. This report only describes those data, that has potentially wider application than input for the model alone. One of the main, though hardly surprising conclusions is that travel characteristics (<b>trip</b> <b>purpose,</b> origin, destination) and composition of the walking and/or cycling population are largely dependent upon the function of the area under study. The situation in Växjö and Groningen are both important shopping centres for the town as a whole and the nearby villages.

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} a methodology for conducting logistic regression modeling of trip and household information obtained from household travel surveys and vehicle trip information obtained from global positioning systems (GPS) {{to better understand}} the trip underreporting that occurs. The methodology presented here builds on previous research by adding additional variables to the logistic regression model that might be significant in contributing to underreporting, specifically, <b>trip</b> <b>purpose.</b> Understanding the <b>trip</b> <b>purpose</b> is crucial in transportation planning because many of the transportation models used today are {{based on the number of}} trips in a given area by the purpose of a trip. The methodology used here was applied to two study areas in Texas, Laredo and Tyler-Longview. In these two study areas, household travel survey data and GPS-based vehicle tracking data was collected over a 24 -hour period for 254 households and 388 vehicles. From these 254 households, a total of 2, 795 trips were made, averaging 11. 0 trips per household. By comparing the trips reported in the household travel survey with those recorded by the GPS unit, trips not reported in the household travel survey were identified. Logistic regression was shown to be effective in determining which household- and trip-related variables significantly contributed to the likelihood of a trip being reported. Although different variables were identified as significant in each of the models tested, one variable was found to be significant in all of them - <b>trip</b> <b>purpose.</b> It was also found that the household residence type and the use of household vehicles for commercial purposes did not significantly affect reporting rates in any of the models tested. The results shown here support the need for modeling trips by <b>trip</b> <b>purpose,</b> but also indicate that, from urban area to urban area, there are different factors contributing to the level of underreporting that occurs. An analysis of additional significant variables in each urban area found combinations that yielded trip reporting rates of 0 %. Similar to the results of Zmud and Wolf (2003), trip duration and the number of vehicles available were also found to be significant in a full model encompassing both study areas...|$|E

40|$|Transit {{oriented}} developments (TODs), be they greenfields developments, in-fill or redevelopments {{of existing}} sites, {{have been included}} as a key component within {{a number of recent}} metropolitan strategies within Australia, including the South East Queensland regional plan. Responding to increasingly extended journeys-to-work and other trip movements, TODs are one land use planning intervention that creates the potential for populations to make shorter journeys and to make mode shifts away from the private motor car and towards walking, cycling and public transport. Whether TODs are led by private developers, development corporations or other entities, the majority will involve the design of a comprehensive structure plan to coordinate development of the site. The skill of designers and planners will ultimately determine how conducive to sustainable travel behaviour the end result is likely to be. Unfortunately, not all TOD designs will generate the desired outcomes and not all opportunities for travel behaviour improvements may be captured - reducing the effectiveness of the overall planning strategy. For instance, while there may be increased opportunities to reach line-haul public transport for longer <b>trip</b> <b>purposes,</b> designs could actually create less sustainable behaviours for other <b>trip</b> <b>purposes,</b> such as journeys to and from school or to and from local shopping. Part {{of the problem is that}} no decision-support tools are readily available to establish whether a specific TOD proposal actually provides the capacity for an improved mode share for sustainable modes, or for decreased journey lengths across a range of <b>trip</b> <b>purposes.</b> The paper suggests a way forward for the development of a diagnostic tool that can assist TOD developers and decision-makers to quickly assess the potential of developments and the likely travel behaviour produced by their design.
