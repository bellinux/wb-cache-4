5|$|Three {{hours after}} developing, the National Hurricane Center issued a {{tropical}} storm watch from Titusville, Florida, to Brunswick, Georgia, due to uncertainty in the track of the storm. Hours after becoming {{a tropical storm}}, a tropical storm warning was issued from Fernandina Beach, Florida, <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>mouth</b> <b>of</b> the Savannah River, with a tropical storm watch further northward <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>mouth</b> <b>of</b> the South Santee River in South Carolina, though these were cancelled after Edouard turned to the east. About 10hours before landfall, the National Hurricane Center issued another tropical storm warning from Titusville, Florida to Brunswick, Georgia, with a tropical storm watch further south to Sebastian Inlet, Florida.|$|E
5|$|Upon {{development}} of Debby on June23, {{a tropical storm}} warning was issued {{from the mouth of}} the Pearl River to Morgan City, Louisiana, excluding New Orleans or Lake Pontchartrain. On the following day, a separate tropical storm warning was put into effect from the Mississippi and Alabama border <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>mouth</b> <b>of</b> the Ochlockonee River in Florida. At 1500UTC on June24, the tropical storm warning was extended <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>mouth</b> <b>of</b> the Suwannee River. Simultaneously, a tropical storm watch was issued from the Suwannee River to Anclote Key. These were all canceled at 1500UTC on June25, though a tropical storm warning was then implemented from Destin to Englewood, Florida. Early on June26, a tropical storm warning was issued from Mexico Beach to Englewood, Florida. By 2100UTC that day, the tropical storm warning was extended <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>mouth</b> <b>of</b> Steinhatchee River in Florida. This was discontinued after Debby became a tropical depression.|$|E

5|$|Copano Bay is {{approximately}} twelve-by-six-miles, oriented {{from the southwest}} to the northeast. It is found mainly on undeveloped land, though ranches are located on parts of the west, south and north shores. The main extensions include Mission Bay, which stretches to the north <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>mouth</b> <b>of</b> the Mission River, and Port Bay to the west, which forms the southern boundary of the Live Oak peninsula. The peninsula {{is located on the}} eastern shore of Copano Bay and is lined with beach homes and residences, which begin just west of the inlet Salt Lake to the head of Live Oak peninsula at the confluence of Copano and Aransas Bay. This opening is spanned by the Copano Bay Causeway and the Copano Bay Fishing Pier, which once served as the main crossing to the Lamar peninsula. Holiday Beach is found on the northeastern shore of Copano Bay on the Lamar Peninsula. Just north of the community is the mouth of Copano Creek, which marks the bay's northernmost point. From here, the shoreline turns to the southwest past the Copano Bay Oil and Gas Field and four sloughs before reaching the ruins of the ghost town Copano at Copano Point, marked by white cliffs. At the point, the Copano Reef juts out almost halfway across the bay. Further southwest, past the mouth of Mission Bay, Bayside stretches along the coast <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>mouth</b> <b>of</b> the Aransas River. The shoreline turns to the southeast from this point, past the Egery Flats and Egery Island through Swan Lake and <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>mouth</b> <b>of</b> Port Bay.|$|E
5|$|Europeans first sighted {{the area}} in 1770 when the crew of James Cook's Endeavour sailed along the coast. Cook named a bay in the Catlins area Molineux's Harbour after his ship's master Robert Molineux. Although this was almost {{certainly}} {{the mouth of the}} Waikawa River, later visitors applied the name to a bay to the northeast, close <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>mouth</b> <b>of</b> the Clutha River, which itself was for many years known as the Molyneux River.|$|E

5|$|Sealers and whalers {{founded the}} first European {{settlements}} {{in the early years}} of the 19th century, at which time the hunting of marine mammals dominated European economic activity in New Zealand.

5|$|Supplies {{could be}} flown into Wau if fighter cover was available. On 5 September, 12 planeloads of {{supplies}} were dropped at Kudjeru.

5|$|Two {{days before}} Isabel made landfall, the National Hurricane Center issued a {{hurricane}} watch from Little River, South Carolina to Chincoteague, Virginia, including the Pamlico and Albemarle Sounds {{and the lower}} Chesapeake Bay.

Hurricane and tropical storm warnings were gradually issued for portions of the East Coast of the United States. By the time Isabel made landfall, a tropical storm warning existed from Chincoteague, Virginia to Fire Island, New York and from Cape Fear, North Carolina <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>mouth</b> <b>of</b> the Santee River in South Carolina, and a hurricane warning existed from Chincoteague, Virginia to Cape Fear. Landfall forecasts were very accurate; from three days prior, the average track forecast error for its landfall was only 36miles (58km), and for 48hours in advance the average track error was 18miles (29km).|$|E

5|$|After a brief {{exchange}} of fire, their crews ran both French ships onshore close <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>mouth</b> <b>of</b> the River Dives, where {{several of the}} landing barges that had survived {{the attack on the}} British-held Îles Saint-Marcouf were sheltering. Confiante was badly damaged and boarding parties from Hydra and the other ships were able to board and burn her the following morning. Vésuve had suffered less than the Confiante and troops onshore were able to protect her from further attack until her crew could bring her into the nearby harbour of Sallenelles. There she was repaired and eventually she returned to Le Havre.|$|E
5|$|As Alex neared {{hurricane}} strength on {{the evening}} of June28, a hurricane warning was issued for the coast of Texas south of Baffin Bay <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>mouth</b> <b>of</b> the Rio Grande. The Mexican government also issued a hurricane warning from the Rio Grande south to La Cruz. A tropical storm warning was posted for coastal Texas from Baffin Bay northward to Port O'Connor. Governor of Texas Rick Perry declared a state of disaster in 19 counties and ordered the deployment of Texas Military Forces personnel (including 80 citizen-soldiers of the Texas State Guard Medical Brigade) to the Rio Grande Valley. President Barack Obama also declared a state of emergency, freeing federal funds for 25 counties in Texas.|$|E
