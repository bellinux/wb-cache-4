Although a {{primitive}} X-ray machine was being exhibited on the Exposition grounds, it was not used. McKinley was taken to the Milburn House.|$|E

The {{official}} cause of death was bronchial pneumonia resulting from AIDS. Mercury's close friend, Dave Clark of The Dave Clark Five, had taken over the bedside vigil when he died.

5|$|Andy (Ed Helms) {{still has}} not learned about fiancee Angela's (Angela Kinsey) affair with Dwight (Rainn Wilson), {{seventeen}} days after Phyllis (Phyllis Smith) revealed it to {{everyone else in the}} Dunder Mifflin office. Michael (Steve Carell) suggests he should inform Andy, but the entire office argues that Angela should be the one <b>to</b> <b>break</b> <b>the</b> <b>news.</b> Jim (John Krasinski) is particularly concerned that Andy's past anger management issues may lead to violence. Dwight tries convincing Angela to tell Andy, but she continues to put it off. This leaves Michael to tell Andy before he leaves for a meeting with David Wallace (Andy Buckley). Michael reveals the affair to Andy while driving out of the parking lot, leaving Andy shocked and dismayed. Angela reluctantly confirms the affair occurred, and Andy realizes everybody else in the office already knew about it.|$|E
5|$|It {{was well}} known in ancient Greece that all the Spartans who {{had been sent to}} Thermopylae had been killed there (with the {{exception}} of Aristodemus and Pantites), and the epitaph exploits the conceit that there was nobody left to bring the news of their deeds back to Sparta. Greek epitaphs often appealed to the passing reader (always called 'stranger') for sympathy, but the epitaph for the dead Spartans at Thermopylae took this convention much further than usual, asking the reader to make a personal journey to Sparta <b>to</b> <b>break</b> <b>the</b> <b>news</b> that the Spartan expeditionary force had been wiped out. The stranger is also asked to stress that the Spartans died 'fulfilling their orders'.|$|E
5|$|The Latino {{community}} was deeply {{affected by the}} news of Selena's death; some people traveled thousands of miles to visit her home, boutiques, and the crime scene, while churches with large congregations of Latinos held prayers in her name. All major television networks in the United States interrupted their regular programming <b>to</b> <b>break</b> <b>the</b> <b>news.</b> The public's reaction to Selena's death was compared to those that followed the deaths of John Lennon, Elvis Presley, and John F. Kennedy. Some Americans who were unaware of the singer and her popularity criticized the attention she and her murder received from both {{the media and the}} Latino community. Radio personality Howard Stern mocked Selena's murder, burial, and her mourners and criticized her music, playing her songs with gunshots in the background, causing an uproar among the Latino population. On April 12, 1995—two weeks after her death—then-Texas governor George W. Bush declared her birthday Selena Day in Texas. Some Americans were offended because Selena Day that year coincided with Easter.|$|E

25|$|Cronkite is vividly {{remembered for}} {{breaking}} {{the news of the}} Assassination of John F. Kennedy on Friday, November 22, 1963.

25|$|In 1844 the tax {{receipts}} were in, and Sherif Pasha, {{the head of}} the diwan al-maliyya (financial ministry), was too fearful for his life to tell the Wāli the news that Egyptian debt now stood at 80million francs (£2,400,000). Tax arrears came to 14,081,500 piastres out of a total estimated tax of 75,227,500 pts. Timidly he approached Ibrahim Pasha with these facts, and together came up with a report and a plan. Anticipating his father's initial reaction, İbrahim arranged for Muhammad Ali's favourite daughter <b>to</b> <b>break</b> <b>the</b> <b>news.</b> It did little, if any, good. The resulting rage was far beyond what any had been expected, and it took six full days for a tenuous peace to take hold.|$|E
25|$|In 1183, {{the young}} King Henry tried again to force {{his father to}} hand over some of his patrimony. In debt and refused control of Normandy, he tried to ambush his father at Limoges. He was joined by troops sent by his brother Geoffrey and Philip II of France. Henry II's troops besieged the town, forcing his son to flee. After {{wandering}} aimlessly through Aquitaine, Henry the Younger caught dysentery. On Saturday, 11 June 1183, the Young King realized he was dying and was overcome with remorse for his sins. When his father's ring was sent to him, he begged that his father would show mercy to his mother, and that all his companions would plead with Henry to set her free. Henry II sent Thomas of Earley, Archdeacon of Wells, <b>to</b> <b>break</b> <b>the</b> <b>news</b> to Eleanor at Sarum. Eleanor reputedly had had a dream in which she foresaw her son Henry's death. In 1193 she would tell Pope Celestine III that she was tortured by his memory.|$|E

25|$|Before Robin's funeral, Emma {{stands at}} Hook's grave and cries, {{trying to cope}} {{with the fact that he}} is truly gone now. Suddenly, a wave of magic flies through the air, causing her to stumble. She hears her name called from behind her and turns around and is shocked to see Hook. She happily embraces Hook, who tells her Zeus sent him back as a reward for {{stopping}} Hades. After informing him that Robin is gone, Emma decides <b>to</b> <b>break</b> <b>the</b> <b>news</b> about Hook's return to Regina as delicately as possible. However, when an earthquake occurs, Hook rushes to see if Emma is okay. It turns out the earthquake was caused by Mr. Gold tethering magic to the Olympian Crystal fragment. Emma works with Regina to find it, only to later have Gold explain that Henry used his Author power to steal the crystal to destroy magic (again). Both follow Henry to New York, where it turns out Gold got the crystal back. At the same time, Hook, David, Snow and Zelena are accidentally sucked into another realm, which they could become trapped in without any magic in the Real World. Henry succeeds in destroying magic, only to be later convinced by the Dragon to get enough belief to recharge the crystal. It works and everyone is brought home. Once back in Storybrooke, Emma shares a passionate kiss with Hook.|$|E
25|$|Alec Foster (Ewan Hooper) (Series 8, Series 9) Camp Controller – Foster was {{appointed}} by Joe Maplin {{to take charge of}} the camp mid-way through the 1960 season. Foster had served as a Sergeant in the RAF during the war, and made himself very unpopular with the entertainments staff. Foster invited Peggy to grant him sexual favours, in return for which he would make her a Yellowcoat. When Gladys confronted Foster about this, he propositioned her in the same way, causing Spike to come to her rescue. When Spike challenged him, Foster punched him in the face, giving him a black eye. During his time at the camp, Foster was cruel and rude to every member of the staff, and sacked Peggy and Clive. He was recalled to head office and his decisions were reversed by Joe Maplin, after Sammy Morris called in a favour which Maplin owed him. He returned later in the season to inspect the staff, and sacked Ted after he asked for a pay rise. Foster then hired Jimmy Jasper as the new camp host, but was forced to reinstate Ted because Jasper's act was a disaster with the campers. Foster returned once again in the final episode <b>to</b> <b>break</b> <b>the</b> <b>news</b> to the staff that their services would not be required the following season, and presented them with a copy of Joe Maplin's autobiography, titled How I Done It.|$|E
25|$|WFAA was {{the first}} station <b>to</b> <b>break</b> <b>the</b> <b>news</b> of President John F. Kennedy's {{assassination}} on November 22, 1963, which occurred about two blocks north of the station's studios near Dealey Plaza, outside the Texas School Book Depository (now known as the Dallas County Administration Building), and seriously injured then-Governor John Connally, who was riding in the motorcade carrying Kennedy. The station conducted the first live television interview with Abraham Zapruder, who shot the famous film of the assassination. During {{the course of the}} interview with Zapruder, who came to the Communications Center studio by police escort, WFAA announcer and program director, Jay Watson (who reported on the shooting with Jerry Haynes, both of whom heard the gunshots being fired at Kennedy), intimated that the film was to be developed in the station's film lab; however, WFAA did not possess the ability to process the Kodachrome II 8mm safety film from Zapruder's camera. WFAA and its live remote unit fed much of the coverage of the assassination and its aftermath to ABC over the next four days. The shooting of accused assassin Lee Harvey Oswald by Jack Ruby in the basement of Dallas police headquarters, however, was not broadcast live (as it was on NBC) or on tape (as on CBS one minute later) by WFAA and ABC as the former's live newsgathering truck was positioned elsewhere at the time. ABC was therefore only able to show delayed newsreel footage of the historic event. WFAA had purchased a fully equipped, live broadcast studio truck prior to the assassination of Kennedy, but the truck was not rolled out for the parade through downtown Dallas. In the aftermath of the murder, the staff was told the cost would have been too great for the news department to compensate the production facility for its use.|$|E
