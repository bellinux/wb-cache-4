50|$|There are {{substantial}} differences in platform height between eastern and southern/western rail systems, intercity and commuter rail. Eastern US rail stations serving the Northeast Corridor from Washington DC to Boston, have a platform height standard of 48 in above <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>rail.</b> Most intercity stations, {{particularly in the}} southern/western United States, use 8 in platforms, while southern/western US commuter rail systems use 25 in above <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>rail</b> platform heights. Recent proposed ADA regulatory changes to support platform level entry forcing a change in southern/western platform heights above <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>rail</b> from 8 or 25 in to 15 in were canceled.|$|E

50|$|Friction buffer stops are clamped 'loosely' to the rails, {{and when}} {{hit by a}} train that fails to stop correctly, move with the train for perhaps 30 m {{scraping}} the <b>top</b> <b>of</b> the <b>rails,</b> which absorbs considerable energy.|$|R
50|$|In 1973, {{the station}} had a low island {{platform}} (about 30 cm above the <b>top</b> <b>of</b> the <b>rail)</b> {{between the two}} tracks. It was reached via a pedestrian level crossing over the Homburg line, which was controlled by the driver. With an increase in traffic and through speeds, and {{in anticipation of the}} early relocation <b>of</b> the <b>rail</b> maintenance operations to Saarbrücken, a passenger subway was built in 1973 from the south side (the centre of the town). At the same time, the platform was raised to 76 cm above the <b>top</b> <b>of</b> the <b>rail.</b> The underpass was extended to the north side in 2008 to connect with a parking area that was built on the location on the site of a former siding.|$|R

50|$|The {{electric}} DART fleet has carriage floors at 1067 mm above <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>rail</b> {{creating a}} step of 152 mm , while the diesel fleet is typically one step (150 to 200 mm) higher than the platform.|$|E
5000|$|The changes {{described}} above are explained in Federal Register: 27 February 2006 (Volume 71, Number 38) page 9764, Commuter and Intercity Rail Station Platform Accessibility, [...] "Amtrak cars serving {{the area in}} which the commuter system will be operated. This means that cars {{in the eastern part of}} the US would have floor heights of 48 in above <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>rail,</b> while those in the southern/western part of the US would have floor heights of 15 in above <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>rail.</b> The purpose of this proposal is to prevent situations—some of which the Department has encountered—in which Amtrak and commuter rail cars with different floor heights use the same station platforms, complicating the provision of level entry boarding." ...|$|E
5000|$|The FS is a {{combined}} cab and passenger carriage, {{and has a}} quite unique look when viewed from the outside. This {{is due to the}} [...] "low-floor entrance" [...] feature included in the design, where part of the floor and doors between the two bogies are [...] "sunken" [...] to a height of 60 cm from the <b>top</b> <b>of</b> the <b>rails.</b> This provides very easy access to the train, especially when bicycles, wheelchairs, and the like need to be put on the train. This easy entrance is because the 60 cm from the <b>top</b> <b>of</b> the <b>rails,</b> is also the general height within a few centimeters (1 - 2 in) of platforms on the Danish railway network.|$|R

25|$|The LIRR's {{electrified}} {{lines are}} powered by 750 V DC third rail with the contact shoe {{running along the}} <b>top</b> <b>of</b> the <b>rail,</b> similar to the New York City Subway and PATH trains. This system is currently incompatible with Metro-North's third rail, which is under-running, though the M8 fleet and the future M9 fleet can use both types <b>of</b> third <b>rails.</b>|$|R

50|$|The 4-6-0 ten-wheeler steam {{locomotive}} of this railway was constructed by H. M. Leach of the Central Iron Works under Coit's supervision. It required four {{months for the}} five men who worked on it to complete the locomotive. The combined length of the locomotive and the tender was 16 ft. The height was 52 in from the <b>top</b> <b>of</b> the <b>rail</b> to the <b>top</b> <b>of</b> the stack.|$|R

50|$|The Locher rack system, {{invented by}} Eduard Locher, has gear teeth {{cut in the}} sides rather than the <b>top</b> <b>of</b> the <b>rail,</b> engaged by two cog wheels on the locomotive.

50|$|The {{track gauge}} is 4 ft 8¼ in (1,429 mm), a near 0.25 in {{narrower}} than the universal 4 ft 8½ in (1,435 mm). Rolling stock floor height is 40 in above <b>top</b> <b>of</b> <b>rail</b> (ATR) for level entry; platform height at stations match this. The Washington Metro’s floors and platforms {{are lower than}} those of most other East Coast mass transit systems, such as in New York City, Boston, and Philadelphia.|$|E
