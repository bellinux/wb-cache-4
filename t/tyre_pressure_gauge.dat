40|$|Tyres are a {{final output}} torque {{of the vehicle}} before all the forces are {{distributed}} to the road surface as a tractive force. When the <b>tyre</b> <b>pressure</b> changed, it had a direct effect on rolling resistance force of the vehicle and reduced the tractive force. Moreover, it {{had an effect on}} a rate of fuel consumption and driving comfort. This research had tested the effect of <b>tyre</b> <b>pressure</b> of 25 psi and 45 psi to determine the total resistance force between the vehicle speed from 40 km/hr to 100 km/hr and compare with the reference <b>tyre</b> <b>pressure</b> of 35 psi by using the “coast-down technique”. The results from calculation showed the total resistance force when the vehicle speed was zero from <b>tyre</b> <b>pressure</b> of 25 psi increased by 48. 52 % from reference value and the total resistance force from <b>tyre</b> <b>pressure</b> of 45 psi decreased by 13. 46 % from the reference <b>tyre</b> <b>pressure.</b> The different resistance force from <b>tyre</b> <b>pressure</b> of 35 psi with the other 2 values of <b>tyre</b> <b>pressure</b> in the research were called the different rolling resistance force because the vehicle changed only <b>tyre</b> <b>pressure</b> which had no effect on aerodynamics drag. The relationship of the different rolling resistance force along the test speed from <b>tyre</b> <b>pressure</b> of 25 psi and 45 psi decreased while the vehicle speed increased. The relationship can be fitted with a linear equation. The slope from <b>tyre</b> <b>pressure</b> of 25 psi was 0. 2358 which was steeper than the slope of 0. 0828 from 45 psi <b>tyre</b> <b>pressure.</b> These were the effect of tyre characteristic that made from rubber. When the vehicle speed was low, the frequency of tyre deformation was also low and resulted in high energy loss from hysteresis phenomena. Therefore high rolling resistance force was generated. Considering the effect of tyre under high vehicle speed, the frequency of tyre deformation increased and made the molecule of rubber vibrate more than low vehicle speed. These effects made the tyre stiffer than low frequency and resulted in decreasing the rolling resistance force. In additional, high frequency that caused by high <b>tyre</b> <b>pressure</b> had effected on driving comfort in a real driving condition...|$|R
40|$|It is well {{understood}} that fuel economy directly influences the CO 2 emissions in vehicles. Thus, a straightforward approach {{to reduce the}} tailpipe CO 2 emissions {{is to reduce the}} overall fuel consumption of the vehicle. In this thesis work the role of <b>tyre</b> inflation <b>pressure</b> on the fuel economy is investigated. Apart from the benefits of reduced fuel consumption, <b>tyre</b> <b>pressure</b> also {{plays an important role in}} deciding vehicle handling and passenger comfort. Three mathematical vehicle models have been developed in the Matlab/Simulink® interface, to capture and represent the influence of <b>tyre</b> <b>pressure</b> on fuel consumption, vehicle handling and ride characteristics. The first model is a full-vehicle model developed to enable quick and reliable estimation of fuel consumption with the change in <b>tyre</b> <b>pressure.</b> The second model is a two-track vehicle model developed to study the changes in vehicle lateral behaviour when the <b>tyre</b> inflation <b>pressure</b> is changed. The third model is a half-car model that is designed to evaluate the changes in vertical acceleration response of the vehicle with change in <b>tyre</b> <b>pressure.</b> When the full-vehicle model was simulated for the New European Driving Cycle (NEDC city cycle), fuel consumption reduction up to 5 % was observed simply by increasing the <b>tyre</b> inflation <b>pressures</b> from 2 bar to 3 bar. The vehicle handling also improved considerably especially when <b>tyre</b> <b>pressure</b> was maintained higher on the outer wheels and lower on the inner wheels of the vehicle in a turn. For smooth roads found within city limits, it was observed that the <b>tyre</b> <b>pressure</b> affected the ride comfort only marginally. However as road roughness increased, the impact of <b>tyre</b> <b>pressure</b> on ride comfort also increased. Through these findings, a foundation is established for the development of a dynamic <b>Tyre</b> <b>Pressure</b> Regulating System (TPRS) that is capable of regulating the <b>tyre</b> <b>pressure</b> in all four wheels, independently and continuously...|$|R

40|$|Studies on {{the effects}} of {{off-road}} driving on soils were conducted in the Makuleke Contractual Park of the Kruger National Park. The studies were conducted on three different soils with different textures and soil compactibilities. Traffic pressure was applied with a game drive vehicle loaded with 10 sand bags, each weighing 70 kg, plus the driver. This gave a total vehicle mass of 3795 kg, simulating a vehicle fully laden with tourists. The results of the study reported here included comparing of the effects of four different <b>tyre</b> <b>pressures</b> on the root area distribution below each <b>tyre</b> <b>pressure.</b> At all sites, root density fractions under the tracks were reduced significantly at all <b>tyre</b> <b>pressures,</b> compared with the control values. Results indicated that root penetration percentage and root area distribution were reduced drastically as <b>tyre</b> <b>pressure</b> increased. Our work reaffirms previous research showing that higher <b>tyre</b> <b>pressures</b> cause higher sub-soil compaction than lower <b>tyre</b> <b>pressures.</b> Thus, driving with lower <b>tyre</b> <b>pressures</b> when driving off-road should be considered when developing management strategies for off-road driving in wildlife protected areas.

40|$|An {{aircraft}} pavement strength {{rating system}} has been internationally adopted since 1981. Since that time, aircraft <b>tyre</b> <b>pressures</b> and wheel loads have increased significantly {{and an increase in}} shear-related surface distress has been reported. The current strength rating system focuses on protection of the subgrade. It also includes a <b>tyre</b> <b>pressure</b> limit intended to protect stress-susceptible surfaces. However, the shear stresses in the surface layer {{have been shown to be}} a function of both the <b>tyre</b> <b>pressure</b> and the individual wheel load. A modification to the current aircraft pavement strength rating system is recommended. The proposed modification replaces the current <b>tyre</b> <b>pressure</b> rating with a classification number that reflects the contribution of both <b>tyre</b> <b>pressure</b> and wheel load to surface layer shear stress. Guidance is also provided on the selection of a surface rating and the granting of approval for usage by aircraft with more demanding wheel load and <b>tyre</b> <b>pressure</b> combinations. It is also recommended that efforts to include shear-related surface failure modes into routine pavement design tools be given high priority, as this will allow a more rational approach to surface rating selection. © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Grou...|$|R

40|$|This study {{studies the}} {{relationship}} between <b>tyre</b> <b>pressure</b> and fuel consumption of vehicles using experimental methods and mathematical model to predict vehicle fuel consumption. The model obtained was F = 0. 6272 - 2. 5941 p+ 3. 3428 p 2 ± 0. 018 where F is the fuel consumed and p is the <b>tyre</b> <b>pressure</b> of a vehicle, which {{can also be used}} to predict the amount of fuel consumed by other vehicles. The model was validated with its own data which showed a deviation of ± 5 % which is within experimental error. Using the recommended <b>tyre</b> <b>pressures</b> the model reduces the fuel consumption by 17. 6 % thus reducing cost of fuel. From the experiment, it was observed that {{the relationship between}} the fuel consumption and the <b>tyre</b> <b>pressures</b> of various vehicles is in the form of F = B 2 p 2 -B 1 p+B 0 ± e, where B 0, B 1, B 2 and ‘e’ depends on other factors of the vehicle such as the age of the vehicle and the conditions under which the measurements were taken. This equation can be used to predict fuel consumptions for vehicles when their <b>tyre</b> <b>pressures</b> are known. In all, it was seen from the research that any deviation in <b>tyre</b> <b>pressure</b> of vehicles resulted in an additional fuel consumed by vehicles. It is recommend that, there should be a massive public education or awareness about the need to keep recommended <b>tyre</b> <b>pressure</b> at all times because when <b>tyre</b> <b>pressure</b> falls below the recommended value, the decrease in the pressure invariably leads to an increase in fuel consumption...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: In {{the world}} today, {{due to the}} high cost of running a vehicle, there has been many {{researches}} to find ways of minimizing running cost. Components of the running cost come from the tyre, fuel, spare parts of vehicles and also ensuring safety of the vehicle. This paper presents the effect the <b>tyre</b> <b>pressures</b> of vehicles on fuel consumption and ways to optimize running cost due to <b>tyre</b> <b>pressure.</b> In this study, the <b>tyre</b> <b>pressures</b> were measured for different types of vehicles at two public institution campuses (Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology and Kumasi Polytechnic) and three public transport stations (Asafo, Roman Hill and Kejetia) in Kumasi Metropolis to ascertain how <b>tyre</b> <b>pressures</b> of these vehicles have deviated from the recommended <b>tyre</b> <b>pressures</b> stated by the manufacturers. Also the fuel consumption was measured to develop a model between the fuel consumption and the <b>tyre</b> <b>pressure</b> which was used to predict the amount of fuel consumption by a vehicle on Ghana roads. It is concluded that, 73 % of the data collected for the different vehicles fall within the predicted results obtained from the developed model and 13 % fall within the experimental error; hence the developed model can be used to predict the amount of fuel consumed by vehicles. It was found out thatabout 97 % of vehicles surveyed in Kumasi Metropolis had their <b>tyre</b> <b>pressures</b> deviated from the recommended tyre pressuresthereby,increasing the fuel consumption of the vehicle...|$|R

40|$|A {{pavement}} strength {{rating system}} is internationally adopted {{in order to}} protect aircraft pavements from inadvertent overload. The system has two elements. The primary element is designed to protect the pavement against subgrade rutting and the second is intended to protect asphalt pavement surfaces. The surface-protection element is arbitrary and empirical, placing category-based limits on aircraft <b>tyre</b> <b>pressures.</b> In 2008, increases in the <b>tyre</b> <b>pressure</b> limits were proposed by aircraft manufacturers and these were approved in 2013. The research reported in this paper assesses the impact of <b>tyre</b> <b>pressure</b> and individual wheel load increases on calculated flexible pavement stress indicators, as well as identifying an improved surface layer protection element. Stresses were calculated near the surface, at the surface layer interface and at the subgrade. <b>Tyre</b> <b>pressure</b> and wheel load combinations included current (18 t and 1. 35 MPa), imminent (33 t and 1. 75 MPa) and future (40 t and 2. 15 MPa) aircraft. Surface layer stress increased significantly (20 – 30 %) with increases in both <b>tyre</b> <b>pressure</b> and wheel load. The subgrade stress increased near-equally (97 %) with wheel load but was insensitive (< 1 %) to <b>tyre</b> <b>pressure</b> changes. The ability of the current aircraft pavement strength rating system to protect pavements from the increasing demands of aircraft was demonstrated to be limited to the subgrade. It is recommended that the <b>tyre</b> <b>pressure</b> rating be amended to reflect the combined impact of both <b>tyre</b> <b>pressure</b> rating and individual wheel load. It is also recommended that ongoing efforts to incorporate additional asphalt surface failure modes into routine pavement design be given high priority. The importance of these issues is reinforced by the limited availability of remedies to counter any negative impacts of increased surface layer stresses, especially in hot climates. © 2016 Taylor & Franci...|$|R

40|$|AbstractIn road cycling, <b>tyre</b> <b>pressure</b> has an {{influence}} on both performance and comfort of the cyclist. In this paper, the relationship between <b>tyre</b> <b>pressure</b> and shock perception at the cyclist's hands was quantitatively analysed by measuring the Just Noticeable Difference in Level (JNDL) of <b>tyre</b> <b>pressure.</b> The JNDL was determined by using a three-alternative forced-choice (3 -AFC) method. The measurement was carried out on seven healthy subjects exposed to shock-type excitation on a laboratory bicycle treadmill. The dispersion of the measured <b>tyre</b> <b>pressure</b> JNDL (69 to 241 kPa; mean 155 kPa; SD 73 kPa) shows a large variability in the hands’ perception of shock in the cyclists tested. This suggests that some cyclists have a better capacity than others to differentiate impact sensory inputs at the hands, making them more likely to discern subtle differences in bicycle response dynamics...|$|R

40|$|The {{prediction}} of optimal slip ratio {{is crucial to}} vehicle control systems.

40|$|M. Ing. Vehicles used in military, agricultural, forestry, or {{construction}} applications often encounter different road surfaces {{during a}} single journey. In order to optimise {{the mobility of}} these vehicles, different <b>tyre</b> <b>pressures</b> are required for different types of terrain (sand, mud, cross country, tar road, etc.). An in-motion <b>tyre</b> <b>pressure</b> control system will enable the vehicle's operator to change the <b>tyre</b> <b>pressures</b> without leaving the vehicle. Such a system will not only allow optimum surface contact between the tyres and the terrain - thus improving vehicletraction, {{but it can also}} increase the lifespan of the tyres and reduce fuel consumption. The key design criteria for such a system are: quick reaction times, an effective operator interface, and reliability. In case of system failure, the operator must be able to override the control, and the tyres should be inflated to a pre-set default pressure. When the fault had been corrected, the system can be restarted from within the cabin, to inflate or deflate the tyres as required. The focus of this thesis is on the design criteria of a <b>tyre</b> <b>pressure</b> control system, receiving inputs from the driver and from onboard vehicle sensors; and then adjusting individual <b>tyre</b> <b>pressures</b> if necessary, while the vehicle is on the move. Based on the inputs to the control system, the optimum setting for the <b>tyre</b> <b>pressure</b> is determined from a look-up table stored in memory of an onboard computer. This table contains the pressure-speed and pressure-axle load relationship. A unique relation is programmed into the microprocessor for each different vehicle. To install a <b>tyre</b> <b>pressure</b> control system on a vehicle, a computer program is used to control the following hardware which are necessary to inflate or deflate tyres: An air compressor and storage tank. Pneumatic valve. Rotating seal. Pressure and speed sensing elements. Electronic control unit. An experimental set-up was built, from various components or sub-systems, which were integrated systematically until the system was working as a unit. The functionality of the system was tested, and although the results obtained do not yet justify the commercial manufacturing of such systems, it is trusted that this research has contributed towards the increased emphasis that is placed upon vehicle safety and comfort systems...|$|R
