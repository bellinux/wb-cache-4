500|$|As {{leader of}} the Whigs and a {{powerful}} legislator (as well as a frustrated presidential candidate in his own right), Henry Clay expected to have substantial influence in the Harrison administration. He ignored his own platform plank of overturning the [...] "spoils" [...] system. Clay attempted to influence Harrison's actions before and during his brief presidency, especially in putting forth his own preferences for Cabinet offices and other presidential appointments. Harrison rebuffed his aggression, saying [...] "Mr. Clay, you forget <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>the</b> President." [...] The dispute intensified when Harrison named Daniel Webster, Clay's arch-rival {{for control of the}} Whig Party, as his Secretary of State, and appeared to give Webster's supporters some highly coveted patronage positions. Harrison's sole concession to Clay was to name his protégé John J. Crittenden to the post of Attorney General. Despite this, the dispute continued until the President's death.|$|E

The creation of the Royal Air Force did not initially {{have a big impact}} on Allingham and he later remarked that at that time he still considered himself a navy man. [...] In the RAF he was ranked as a Rigger Aero, Aircraft Mechanic Second Class and was given a new service number: 208317. Allingham returned to the Home Establishment in February 1919 and was formally discharged to the RAF Reserve on 16 April 1919. During the last few years of his life Allingham was recognized as the last surviving founding member of the RAF.

500|$|Music critics met {{the record}} with mixed reviews. German radio station [...] praised the [...] "harmonious and compatible" [...] way Inna's songs fit {{together}} on the record. They also commended the [...] "incredibly danceable and upbeat disco sound" [...] and found that she remained true to her style. Especial praise was reserved for [...] "Endless", as the station found the song distinguished itself from the other material on I Am the Club Rocker. However, Kai Butterweck, a writer for online German magazine Laut, gave I Am the Club Rocker a negative review, commenting that [...] "the scheme is the same in nearly all the songs: galloping offbeat-keyboards first meet with innovation loose beats, ere Inna's thin vocal organ moves the next three or four minutes on almost the same pitch". He further described the songs' rhymes as being [...] "cobbled together from a sixth graders' dictionary". Anna Julia Höhr, writing for the news agency Teleschau, similarly criticized the album, saying that the singer's tunes sound [...] "all the same" [...] and evaluating the record as [...] "disappointing". AllMusic's Jon O'Brien rated I Am the Club Rocker with two-and-a-half out of five stars, describing its songs as [...] "sun-soaked Europop tracks that appear destined to blare out of various Club 18-30 hotspots until the inevitable 6-a.m. stagger back to the hotel". He also criticized the use of Auto-Tune throughout the record and noticed major similarities between the album track [...] "Moon Girl" [...] and Katy Perry's [...] "California Gurls" [...] (2010). O'Brien went on say that Inna [...] "is {{going to have to}} change the record quickly if she wants to avoid the novelty-act fate of her homeland's formerly most famous pop export", asserting <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>Am</b> <b>the</b> Club Rocker was the first Romanian major contribution to the international pop music industry after the work of girl band The Cheeky Girls.|$|E
