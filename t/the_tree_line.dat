5|$|Banff National Park spans three ecoregions, {{including}} montane, subalpine, and alpine. The subalpine ecoregion, {{which consists}} mainly of dense forest, comprises 53percent of Banff's area. 27percent {{of the park}} is located above <b>the</b> <b>tree</b> <b>line,</b> in the alpine ecoregion. <b>The</b> <b>tree</b> <b>line</b> in Banff lies approximately at , with open meadows at alpine regions and some areas covered by glaciers. A small portion (3percent) of the park, located at lower elevations, is in the montane ecoregion. Lodgepole pine forests dominate the montane region of Banff, with Engelmann spruce, willow, aspen, occasional Douglas-fir and a few Douglas maple interspersed. Engelmann spruce are {{more common in the}} subalpine regions of Banff, with some areas of lodgepole pine, and subalpine fir. The montane areas in the Bow Valley, which tend to be the preferred habitat for wildlife, have been subjected to significant human development over the years.|$|E
5|$|In Europe it is {{more common}} in {{northern}} than south Europe, and it has not been reported from south and west Europe. In addition to being common in Scandinavian countries, it has been collected in Germany, Hungary, Latvia, Russia, Slovakia, and Korea. In North America, its distribution is restricted to Alaska, where it is usually found above <b>the</b> <b>tree</b> <b>line.</b>|$|E
5|$|Several rock {{prominences}} {{exist on}} the lower flanks of Adams. The Spearhead is an abrupt rocky prominence {{near the bottom of}} Battlement Ridge. Burnt Rock, The Hump, and The Bumper are three smaller rocky prominences at or below <b>the</b> <b>tree</b> <b>line</b> on the west side.|$|E

5|$|Below <b>the</b> <b>tree</b> <b>line</b> {{there are}} several zones of climax forest. Birch dominates {{to the west and}} north, Scots Pine with Birch and oak in the eastern Highlands and oak (both Quercus robur and Q. petrea) with Birch in the Central Lowlands and Borders. Much of the Scottish {{coastline}} consists of machair, a fertile dune pasture land formed as sea levels subsided after the last ice age. Machairs have received considerable ecological and conservational attention, chiefly because of their unique ecosystems.|$|E
5|$|In the {{northern}} areas, the species {{can be found}} in Alaska, Iceland, northern Scandinavia, Greenland and Russia. These are not only particular, specialised species; according to an overview study, more than 150 species were found in the arctic and subarctic regions of Iceland, Greenland, northern Russia and Alaska. These distinctly exceed <b>the</b> <b>tree</b> <b>line.</b> In Greenland, the habitat may reach the 77th latitude line. The Myxogastria species reach their largest biodiversity and highest frequency in forests of temperate regions, which are ideal habitats because of the amount of rich organic material, suitable humidity (not too high) and long-lasting snow cover for snow-inhabiting species.|$|E
5|$|In {{the summer}} the {{fieldfare}} frequents mixed woodland of birch, alder, pine, spruce and fir, often near marshes, moorland or other open ground. It does not avoid {{the vicinity of}} humans and {{can be seen in}} cultivated areas, orchards, parks and gardens. It also inhabits open tundra and the slopes of hills above <b>the</b> <b>tree</b> <b>line.</b> In the winter, groups of fieldfares are chiefly found in open country, agricultural land, orchards and open woodland. They are nomadic, wandering wherever there is an abundance of berries and insects. Later in the year they move on to pastureland and cultivated fields.|$|E

50|$|The {{sheltered}} valleys in {{the interior}} of Troms have <b>the</b> highest <b>tree</b> <b>line</b> (summer warmth and length is the limiting factor), with downy birch reaching an elevation of 700 m on the southern slope of Njunis; all over Troms county birch <b>trees</b> forms <b>the</b> <b>tree</b> <b>lines,</b> often 200 m above other trees. Rowan, aspen, willow, grey alder, and bird cherry are common in the lower elevations.|$|R

5|$|The {{range of}} {{altitude}} in Grand Teton National Park impacts {{the types of}} plant species found at various elevations. In the alpine zone above <b>the</b> <b>tree</b> <b>line,</b> which in Grand Teton National Park is at approximately , tundra conditions prevail. In this treeless region, hundreds of species of grass, wildflower, moss and lichen are found. In the subalpine region from <b>the</b> <b>tree</b> <b>line</b> {{to the base of}} the mountains, whitebark pine, limber pine, subalpine fir, and Engelmann spruce are dominant. In the valley floor, lodgepole pine is most common but Rocky Mountain Douglas-fir, and blue spruce inhabit drier areas, while aspen, cottonwood, alder, and willow are more commonly found around lakes, streams and wetlands. However, the tablelands above the Snake River channel are mostly sagebrush plains and in terms of acreage is the most widespread habitat in the park. The sagebrush plains or flats have 100 species of grasses and wildflowers. Slightly more elevated sections of the plains of the northern sections of Jackson Hole form forest islands with one such obvious example being Timbered Island. In this ecotone, forested islands surrounded by sagebrush expanses provide shelter for various animal species during the day and nearby grasses for night time foraging.|$|E
5|$|The {{summit of}} Mauna Kea lies above <b>the</b> <b>tree</b> <b>line,</b> and {{consists}} of mostly lava rock and alpine tundra. An area of heavy snowfall, it is inhospitable to vegetation, and {{is known as the}} Hawaiian tropical high shrublands. Growth is restricted here by extremely cold temperatures, a short growing season, low rainfall, and snow during winter months. A lack of soil also retards root growth, makes it difficult to absorb nutrients from the ground, and gives the area a very low water retention capacity.|$|E
5|$|This bird always forages in groups, {{which are}} larger in winter than summer, and have {{constant}} composition in each season. Where food resources are restricted, adults dominate young birds, and males outrank females. Foraging areas change altitudinally through the year, depending on climatic factors, food availability and food quality. During the breeding season, birds remain above <b>the</b> <b>tree</b> <b>line,</b> {{although they may}} use food provided by tourists at refuges and picnic areas.|$|E

5|$|Many {{species of}} birds have been spotted in the Little Butte Creek region. Twenty-two species are known to breed in the {{chaparral}} region, including several species of wrens, blackbirds, and sparrows. The mixed coniferous forest is home to white-headed woodpeckers, pygmy nuthatches, green-tailed towhees, northern pygmy-owls, Vaux's swifts, winter wrens, and MacGillivray's warblers. The American coot has also been spotted in several places along the creek. Williamson's sapsuckers, black-backed woodpeckers, gray jays, and hermit warblers frequent the higher elevations. The near-threatened olive-sided flycatcher and Cassin's finch also live in this area. Eurasian three-toed woodpeckers and Clark's nutcrackers have been spotted near <b>the</b> <b>tree</b> <b>line.</b> The endangered Townsend's big-eared bat is known {{to live in the}} watershed.|$|E
5|$|The grey jay (Perisoreus canadensis), also gray jay, Canada jay, or whisky jack, is a {{passerine}} bird of {{the family}} Corvidae. It is found in boreal forests of North America north to <b>the</b> <b>tree</b> <b>line,</b> and in the Rocky Mountains subalpine zone south to New Mexico and Arizona. A fairly large songbird, the grey jay has pale grey underparts, darker grey upperparts, and a grey-white head with a darker grey nape. It {{is one of three}} members of the genus Perisoreus, a small genus more closely related to the Cyanopica genus of magpies than to other birds known as jays. The grey jay itself has nine recognized subspecies.|$|E
5|$|The {{island has}} three endemic species of tree, the Arran {{whitebeam}}s. These trees are the Scottish or Arran whitebeam (Sorbus arranensis), the bastard mountain ash or cut-leaved whitebeam (Sorbus pseudofennica) and the Catacol whitebeam (Sorbus pseudomeinichii). If rarity {{is measured by}} numbers alone they are amongst the most endangered tree species in the world. They are protected in Glen Diomhan off Glen Catacol, {{at the north end}} of the island by a partly fenced off national nature reserve, and are monitored by staff from Scottish Natural Heritage. Only 236 Sorbus pseudofennica and 283 Sorbus arranensis were recorded as mature trees in 1980. They are typically trees of the mountain slopes, close to <b>the</b> <b>tree</b> <b>line.</b> However, they will grow at lower altitudes, and are being preserved within Brodick Country Park.|$|E
5000|$|The {{most notable}} street in Berlin, Germany is called Unter den Linden, named after <b>the</b> <b>trees</b> <b>lining</b> <b>the</b> avenue. In German folklore, <b>the</b> linden <b>tree</b> is <b>the</b> [...] "tree of lovers." [...] See the famous Middle High German poem below.|$|R
50|$|In 1703, {{the first}} of <b>the</b> <b>trees</b> <b>lining</b> La Rambla were planted.They were 280 birch trees and later on those were {{replaced}} by elm trees. In 1832 some acacias were planted and the currently standing plane trees started to be <b>the</b> common <b>tree</b> from 1859.|$|R

5|$|Wind also limits tree growth. On coasts and {{isolated}} mountains, <b>the</b> <b>tree</b> <b>line</b> is often {{much lower than}} in corresponding altitudes inland and in larger, more complex mountain systems, because strong winds reduce tree growth. High winds scour away thin soils through erosion, as well as damage limbs and twigs. When high winds knock down or uproot trees, the process is known as windthrow. This is most likely on windward slopes of mountains, with severe cases generally occurring to tree stands that are 75years or older. Plant varieties near the coast, such as the Sitka spruce and sea grape, are pruned back by wind and salt spray near the coastline.|$|E
5|$|During the {{subsequent}} fighting at Ap My An the Viet Cong had elected to fight from a hasty but well-prepared position and had displayed good battle discipline, {{command and control}} and effective camouflage and concealment. The Australians were later generous in their praise for their performance. In particular their use of snipers had been particularly effective, although overall their individual shooting was of a poor standard and had often been too high. Townsend concluded that the Viet Cong force had most likely been ordered to fight a rearguard action until dark in order to cover the withdrawal a larger force and their command elements. Regardless, despite their strong performance, the battle also held lessons for the Viet Cong themselves. In particular their failure to deploy their machine-guns in <b>the</b> <b>tree</b> <b>line</b> {{on the edge of}} the landing zone had allowed the Australians to establish a foothold, despite A Company being forced to assault into an insecure landing zone with only minimal suppression from a single artillery battery. Later during the war the Viet Cong developed the effective tactic of targeting troop helicopters as they arrived at landing zones when they were most vulnerable.|$|E
5|$|Many birds call Adams home or a {{stopover}} {{on their}} migration routes. Songbirds include three species of chickadee, two kinglets, several thrushes, warblers, sparrows, and finches. One unique songbird {{to the high}} elevations is the gray-crowned rosy finch, who can be found far up the mountain, well above <b>the</b> <b>tree</b> <b>line.</b> Raptors {{that live in the}} forest and meadows include Accipiters, red-tailed hawks, golden and bald eagles, ospreys, great horned owls, and falcons. The many snags around the mountain provide forage and nesting habitat for the many species of woodpeckers that live there including the hairy woodpecker, downy woodpecker, and white-headed woodpecker. Jays such as the Steller's jay and gray jay are common and the gray jay is an especially familiar character, as they will boldly investigate campers and hikers. Another familiar character of the higher elevation forests is the Clark's nutcracker with its distinctive call. Swallows and swifts are frequently seen flying just above the water of lakes and some larger streams. Common mergansers and several other species of water birds can be found on many of the lakes as well. The American dipper with its unique way of bobbing about along streams and then ducking into the water is a common sight. Several grouse species, the sooty, spruce, and ruffed grouse and the white-tailed ptarmigan, call the forests and the lower slopes of the mountain home.|$|E
