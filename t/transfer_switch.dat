5000|$|An open {{transition}} <b>transfer</b> <b>switch</b> is {{also called}} a break-before-make <b>transfer</b> <b>switch.</b> A break-before-make <b>transfer</b> <b>switch</b> breaks contact with {{one source of}} power before it makes contact with another. It prevents backfeeding from an emergency generator back into the utility line, for example.One example is an open transition automatic <b>transfer</b> <b>switch</b> (ATS). During the split second of the power transfer the flow of electricity is interrupted. Another example is a manual three position switch or circuit breaker, with utility power on one side, the generator on the other, and [...] "off" [...] in the middle, which requires the user to switch through the full disconnect [...] "off" [...] position before making the next connection.|$|E
5000|$|As well as {{transferring}} the load to the backup generator, an ATS may also command the backup generator to start, {{based on the}} voltage monitored on the primary supply. The <b>transfer</b> <b>switch</b> isolates the backup generator from the electric utility when the generator is on and providing temporary power. The control capability of a <b>transfer</b> <b>switch</b> may be manual only, {{or a combination of}} automatic and manual. The switch transition mode (see below) of a <b>transfer</b> <b>switch</b> may be Open Transition (OT) (the usual type), or Closed Transition (CT)).|$|E

5000|$|With regular generators, an {{automatic}} <b>transfer</b> <b>switch</b> {{is used to}} connect emergency power. One side is connected to both the normal power feed and the emergency power feed; {{and the other side}} is connected to the load designated as emergency. If no electricity comes in on the normal side, the <b>transfer</b> <b>switch</b> uses a solenoid to throw a triple pole, single throw switch. This switches the feed from normal to emergency power. The loss of normal power also triggers a battery operated starter system to start the generator, similar to using a car battery to start an engine. Once the <b>transfer</b> <b>switch</b> is switched and the generator starts, the building's emergency power comes back on (after going off when normal power was lost.) ...|$|E
5000|$|Homes with standby {{generators}} may use a <b>transfer</b> <b>switch</b> {{for a few}} circuits or {{the whole}} home. Different models are available, with both manual and automatic transfer. Often small <b>transfer</b> <b>switch</b> systems use circuit breakers with an external operating linkage as the switching mechanism.

50|$|A standby {{generator}} is a back-up {{electrical system}} that operates automatically. Within seconds of a utility outage an automatic <b>transfer</b> <b>switch</b> senses the power loss, commands the generator {{to start and}} then transfers the electrical load to the generator.

After utility power returns, the automatic <b>transfer</b> <b>switch</b> transfers the electrical load back to the utility and signals the standby generator to shut off. It then returns to standby mode where it awaits the next outage. To ensure a proper response to an outage, a standby generator runs weekly self-tests.
