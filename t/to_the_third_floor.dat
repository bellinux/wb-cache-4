Osama's third wife, Khairah, was in the hallway, headed towards the SEALs. She was blinded by a strobe light and pushed to the floor as the SEALs went past her.

Ivor Lloyd Tuckett argued that Home did this to provide [...] "a rough sketch of the picture which he aimed at producing". Another possible natural explanation for Home's famous levitation was proposed by the psychical researcher Guy William Lambert who suggested he had attached a rope to the chimneys {{on the roof of the}} building, and hung the rope down unseen <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>third</b> <b>floor.</b> During the alleged levitation Home [...] "swung out and in" [...] the room by using a double rope maneuver.

He fired on students in the front row and then killed two women who were trying to escape the room, while other students dove under their desks. Lépine moved towards some of the female students, wounding three of them and killing another. He changed the magazine in his weapon and moved to the front of the class, shooting in all directions. At this point, the wounded Leclair asked for help; Lépine unsheathed his hunting knife and stabbed her three times, killing her. He took off his cap, wrapped his coat around his rifle, exclaimed, [...] "Ah shit," [...] and then committed suicide by shooting himself in the head, twenty minutes after having begun his attack.

Each [...] "quadrant" [...] housed two rooms for the residents with additional rooms in the ell and the third floor has four additional bedrooms with the dormer windows. The third floor of the ell was used as attic storage space. At the time of nomination to the National Register of Historic Places, the alterations that had been made to the house were described as [...] "minor and inconspicuous, consisting mainly of alterations to windows and dormers to provide egress to necessary fire-escapes." [...] The porch is believed {{to be a part of}} the original design, but it was noted that if it was a later addition it would likely have been done before 1920.
