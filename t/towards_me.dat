25|$|The judge {{hearing the}} case even asked me whether I {{could make the}} film indoors and thus {{accommodate}} Madhubala, and I said I could not. You will not believe this, but the day the film was released, I saw the same judge coming <b>towards</b> <b>me</b> and saying that I was right, the film {{could only have been}} made outdoors. That's how I won the case. Madhubala did come to my house to apologise and say she was really helpless, but that's okay. I have no complaints.|$|E
500|$|Shortly {{before her}} death, {{when asked if}} she had been too cruel in her writing, Phillips replied, [...] "We all have our standards. People behaved in an ugly and despicable fashion <b>towards</b> <b>me.</b> I felt no constraints. Nothing I did in my book is as mean as any of the people I wrote about." [...] She was {{similarly}} unrepentant about her subsequent expatriation, saying [...] "I wasn't a pariah because I was a drug-addicted, alcoholic, rotten person and not a good mother. I was a pariah because I hit them with a harsh, fluorescent light and rendered them as contemptible as they truly are." ...|$|E
500|$|As {{they would}} do with all their operas, Gilbert and Sullivan made cuts and {{alterations}} after the first performance. Two days after the opening, Sullivan wrote to his mother, [...] "I have rarely seen anything so beautiful put upon the stage. The first night I had a great reception, but the music went badly, and the singer sang half a tone sharp, so that the enthusiasm of the audience did not sustain itself <b>towards</b> <b>me.</b> Last night I cut out the song, the music went very well, and consequently I had a hearty call before the curtain {{at the end of}} Act II." [...] The piece eventually settled into a respectable state, and later critics were much more enthusiastic than those on opening night.|$|E

500|$|The exact {{sequence}} of events which led to Van Gogh's mutilation of his ear is not known. Gauguin claimed, fifteen years later, that the night followed several instances of physically threatening behaviour. Their relationship was complex, and Theo may have owed money to Gauguin, who was suspicious that the brothers were exploiting him financially. It seems likely that Van Gogh had realised that Gauguin was planning to leave. The following days saw heavy rain, leading to the two men being shut in the Yellow House. Gauguin reported that Van Gogh followed when Gauguin left {{the house for a}} walk, and [...] "rushed <b>towards</b> <b>me,</b> an open razor in his hand". This account is uncorroborated; Gauguin was almost certainly absent from the Yellow House that night, most likely in a hotel.|$|E
500|$|Joe Kernan {{was adamant}} that Diarmuid Marsden {{did not deserve}} to be sent off and criticised players for pretending to be injured during the game. The player himself also {{disagreed}} with the decision: [...] "The umpire said I struck him but I just saw the man coming <b>towards</b> <b>me</b> and {{it was more a}} case of getting myself out of the way or protecting myself." [...] He added: [...] "I'd never been sent off for Armagh before and to be sent off in an All-Ireland final is hard to take. Hopefully I won't be remembered for that. And I wouldn't like to end the career on that note." [...] Kernan and Marsden contested the decision and subsequent ban, but the GAA's Games Administration Committee upheld the penalty. However, after taking their case to the Central Council, the ban was overturned.|$|E
500|$|However, the {{relationship}} between the two brothers had become strained throughout 2009, leading eventually to a last-minute cancellation of an Oasis concert scheduled to take place on 28 August 2009 in Paris, due to an [...] "altercation within the group." [...] Later that evening, Gallagher confirmed he had left Oasis as he [...] "simply could not go on working with Liam a day longer." [...] Through the Oasis website, he said [...] "It's with some sadness and great relief to tell you that I quit Oasis tonight". On 29 August, Gallagher expanded further on his blog, stating [...] "the level of verbal and violent intimidation <b>towards</b> <b>me,</b> my family, friends and comrades has become intolerable. And the lack of support and understanding from my management and band mates has left me with no other option than to get me cape and seek pastures new." ...|$|E

500|$|Moore {{considered}} disinheriting his daughter, {{writing that}} [...] "Russell's conduct <b>towards</b> <b>me</b> {{continues to be}} cold and heartless ... and I must look on her as not deserving to inherit from me". Sophia Peacock, a sister of his wife, was closely involved in Russell's up-bringing and Moore developed romantic feelings for her; in 1858, he changed his will to give her his property instead of Russell, but Sophia rejected his marriage proposal and he disinherited her the following year. Despite Moore's [...] "vehement objections", his daughter married George Edward Corrance in 1860. After a year she eloped with Colonel Edward William de Lancy Lowe; they married in 1866, after Corrance divorced her on grounds of adultery. Her father [...] "had always reason to be dissatisfied with her conduct" [...] and, three months before his death, he made a new will and bequeathed all of his property to Peacock. After Moore's death, Russell Lowe and her paternal uncle, Rev. Edward Moore opened a court case to contest the will. In March 1868, the courts found that the will was legal. Sophia Peacock inherited nearly all of Moore's estate.|$|E
500|$|One of Victoria's first acts as queen was {{to dismiss}} Conroy {{from her own}} household, though she could not dismiss him from her mother's. Queen Victoria, as an {{unmarried}} young woman, was still expected {{to live with her}} mother, but she relegated the Duchess and Conroy to remote apartments at Buckingham Palace, cutting off personal contact with them. The Duchess unsuccessfully insisted that Conroy and his family be allowed at court; Victoria disagreed, saying: [...] "I thought you would not expect me to invite Sir John Conroy after his conduct <b>towards</b> <b>me</b> for some years past." [...] In 1839, the Duke of Wellington convinced Conroy to leave the Duchess's household and take his family to the Continent in effective exile. The Times reported that he no longer had official duties, though they were unsure if he had resigned or been dismissed. That year rumours abounded that Lady Flora Hastings, whose abdomen had grown large, was pregnant by Conroy. A subsequent medical investigation concluded that Lady Flora was a virgin and she died from liver cancer several months later. This scandal, in tandem with the Bedchamber Crisis, damaged Victoria's reputation.|$|E
500|$|Beyond Star Treks fictional innovations, its {{contributions}} to TV history included a multicultural and multiracial cast. While {{more common in}} subsequent years, in the 1960s it was controversial to feature an Enterprise crew that included a Japanese helmsman, a Russian navigator, a black female communications officer, and a human–Vulcan first officer. Captain Kirk's and Lt. Uhura's kiss, in the episode [...] "Plato's Stepchildren", was also daring, and is often mis-cited as being American television's first scripted, interracial kiss, even though several other interracial kisses predated this one. In an interview Nichelle Nichols, who played the black female communications officer, said that the day after she told Roddenberry she planned to leave the show, she was at a fund-raiser at the NAACP and was told {{there was a big}} fan who wanted to meet her. Nichols said, I thought it was a Trekkie, and so I said, 'Sure.' I looked across the room, and there was Dr. Martin Luther King walking <b>towards</b> <b>me</b> with this big grin on his face. He reached out to me and said, 'Yes, Ms. Nichols, I am your greatest fan.' He said that Star Trek was the only show that he, and his wife Coretta, would allow their three little children to stay up and watch. [...] I never got to tell him why, because he said, 'You can't. You're part of history.' When she told Roddenberry what King had said, he cried.|$|E
40|$|Background: The {{most common}} types of medical error are {{medication}} errors (MEs) which defined as any preventable event {{that may be}} caused by an inappropriate medication usage and lead to an adverse drug reaction (ADR) event in patients. In recent years, different approaches have been proposed to reduce MEs, one of which is reporting ADRs. The present study was designed to assess the Knowledge, Attitude and Practice (KAP) of medicine students <b>towards</b> <b>MEs</b> and ADRs reporting. Method: The validated 12 -item questionnaire included subsequently 4 questions, 5 items and the final 3 questions related to the knowledge, attitude, and practice that was given to each participant before and after of the clerkship course. The study population were 40 students of fourth-year of medicine. Results: Demographic features of the participants have no significant difference. Medicine students had a poor KAP <b>towards</b> <b>MEs.</b> Only 8 % of respondents had general knowledge about MEs and 50 % of students believed MEs are inevitable events, less than 20 % of them were acquainted with 5 rules of prescriptions. Students had good knowledge and attitude but poor practice towards ADRs reporting. 55 % of participants were aware of their responsibility of ADRs reporting but only 5 % of respondents were acquainted with ADRs reporting method and the ADR center in the hospitals. Conclusion: The educational intervention, alteration in medicine student’s curriculum, and hold the interactive clerkship for health care professionals can improve the KAP towards ADRs reporting and diminish of the preventable medication errors. </p...|$|R

Of 12 Hurricanes involved, five were shot down and four of their pilots killed, including Pattle.

2500|$|According to the Kebra Nagast of the Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church, Pharaoh's {{daughter}} tricked Solomon into committing idolatry {{by making}} him swear an oath. In the text {{she was upset}} that he has slept with the Queen of Sheba and fathered Menyelek (who is held to have taken the Arc of the Covenant with him when the Queen returned with him to Africa). Solomon at first resists her calls saying [...] "I will neither sacrifice to nor worship thine idols, and I will not perform thy wish." [...] So [...] "one day she beautified and scented herself for him, and she behaved herself haughtily towards him, and treated him disdainfully. And he said unto her, [...] "What shall I do? Thou hast made thy face evil <b>towards</b> <b>me,</b> and thy regard <b>towards</b> <b>me</b> is not as it was formerly, and thy beautiful form is not as enticing as usual. Ask me, and I will give thee whatsoever thou wishest, and I will perform it for thee, so that thou mayest make thy face (or, attitude) gracious <b>towards</b> <b>me</b> as formerly"; but she held her peace and answered him never a word. And he repeated to her the words {{that he would do}} whatsoever she wished, and she said unto him, [...] "Swear to me by the God of Israel that thou wilt not play me false." [...] And he swore to her that he would give her whatsoever she asked for, and that he would do for her everything that she told him. And she tied a scarlet thread on the middle of the door of [...] her gods, and she brought three locusts and set them in the house of her gods. And she said unto Solomon, [...] "Come to me without breaking the scarlet thread, bend thyself and kill these locusts before me and pull out their necks"; and he did so. And she said unto him, [...] "I will henceforward do thy will, for thou hast sacrificed to my gods and hast worshipped them." [...] Now he had done thus because of his oath, so that he might not break his oath which she had made him to swear, even though he knew that it was an offence (or, sin) to enter into the house of her gods." ...|$|E

However, in 2010, {{the publication of the}} book Hawke: The Prime Minister, by Hawke's second wife, Blanche d'Alpuget, reignited conflict between the two. In an open letter to Hawke published in Australian newspapers, Keating bitterly accused Hawke and D'alpuget of spreading falsehoods about his role in Hawke's premiership.
