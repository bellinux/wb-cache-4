40|$|Abstract—Location-tagged {{social media}} have an {{increasingly}} important role in shaping behavior of individuals. With the help of location recommendations, users are able to learn about events, products or places of interest {{that are relevant to}} their preferences. User locations and movement patterns are available from geosocial networks such as Foursquare, mass <b>transit</b> <b>logs</b> or traffic monitoring systems. However, disclosing movement data raises serious privacy concerns, as the history of visited locations can reveal sensitive details about an individual’s health status, alternative lifestyle, etc. In this paper, we investigate mechanisms to sanitize location data used in recommendations with the help of differential privacy. We also identify the main factors that {{must be taken into account}} to improve accuracy. Extensive experimental results on real-world datasets show that a careful choice of differential privacy technique leads to satisfactory location recommendation results. I...|$|R

30|$|An {{automated}} geotechnical characterisation method from geophysical logs {{was initially}} developed {{to identify the}} key strata responsible for caving behaviours during LW coal mining at Southern Colliery in Central Queensland, Australia (Guo et al. 2000). The method {{is based on a}} computer program LogTrans developed by Centre for mining technology and equipment (CSIRO/CMTE) for geological interpretation. Conventional logs such as density, natural gamma and UCS (derived from sonic <b>transit</b> time) <b>logs</b> were utilised. A 3 D geotechnical model of the study area of the Colliery was established using Vulcan (a trade mark software) based on the LogTrans interpretation.|$|R

These records are frequently {{used to determine}} the mineralogy and physical properties of potential reservoir rocks, {{and the nature of the}} fluids they contain. In particular, we consider the possibility of developing nonlinear local models relating Sonic <b>logs</b> (<b>transit</b> time of compressional waves) with other commonly measured properties such as Resistivity and Natural Formation Radioactivity Level (Gamma Ray log). We show that neural network ensembles are clearly superior to linear multivariate regression as modeling technique, revealing an underlying nonlinear functional dependency between the correlated variables. ...|$|R
40|$|Oil well logs are {{frequently}} {{used to determine}} the mineralogy and physical properties of potential reservoir rocks, {{and the nature of the}} fluids they contain. Recently we reported an exploratory use of neural network ensembles for modeling these records.

In this work we use kernel methods to develop nonlinear local models relating Sonic <b>logs</b> (<b>transit</b> time of compressional waves) with other commonly measured properties (Resistivity and Natural Formation Radioactivity Level or Gamma Ray log). The kernel considered is conceptually simple and numerically robust, and allows to obtain the same performance as neural networks ensembles on this task. Eje: Sistemas inteligente...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} impact of {{pedestrian}} environments on walking behavior, and the related choice of travel path for <b>transit</b> riders. Activity <b>logs</b> from trip surveys combined with transit-route and land-use information are used to fit discrete-choice models of how riders choose among multiple paths to downtown destinations. The work illustrates (1)  how the quality of pedestrian environments along transit egress paths affects transfers inside a transit system, and (2) how the impedance of transferring affects egress walking path choices. The use of GIS techniques for path-based spatial analysis is key to understanding {{the impact of}} pedestrian environments on walking behavior at the street level. The results show that desirable pedestrian environments encourage transit riders to choose paths that are ‘friendlier’, even if they involve more walking after leaving transit. Policy implications for land-use planning and transit service planning are discussed. ...|$|R
40|$|Listeria monocytogenes {{can change}} its {{cellular}} morphology from bacilli to cocci {{during the transition}} to the long-term-survival (LTS) phase. The LTS cells demonstrated increased baro- and thermotolerance compared to their vegetative counterparts. So far, the underlying mechanisms that trigger this morphological and physiological transition remain largely unknown. In this study, we compared the transcriptomic profiles of L. monocytogenes serotype 4 b strain F 2365 at different growth stages in tryptic soy broth with yeast extract (TSBYE) using a whole-genome DNA chip approach. We identified a total of 225 differentially expressed genes (≥ 4 -fold; P < 0. 05) during {{the transition to the}} LTS phase in TSBYE. Genes related to cell envelope structure, energy metabolism, and transport were most significantly upregulated in the LTS phase. The upregulation of compatible solute transporters may lead to the accumulation of cellular solutes, lowering intracellular water activity and thus increasing bacterial stress resistance during the transition to the LTS phase. The downregulation of genes associated with protein synthesis may indicate a status of metabolic dormancy of the LTS cells. The transcriptomic profiles of resuscitated LTS cells in fresh TSBYE resembled those of log-phase cells (r= 0. 94), as the LTS cells rapidly resume metabolic activities and <b>transit</b> back to <b>log</b> phase with decreased baro- and thermotolerance...|$|R
30|$|Overpressure in the North Alpine Foreland Basin in SE Germany {{has been}} {{previously}} studied by Rizzi (1973), who demonstrated with two examples that overpressure can be estimated from geophysical well logs such as electrical resistivity and acoustic <b>transit</b> time (sonic <b>log).</b> Müller et al. (1988) and Müller and Nieberding (1996) {{were the first to}} study the regional distribution of maximum overpressure and its origin, based on a combination of maximum drilling mud weights and the structural interpretation of 2 D seismic cross sections. They presented a regional map of maximum pore pressure gradients inferred from maximum drilling mud weights. Based on analysis of drilling data and velocity data, Drews et al. (2018) demonstrated that overpressure can be estimated with reasonable accuracy from seismic velocities of sonic logs and vertical seismic profiles. Drews et al. (2018) also were the first providing pore pressure gradient maps for all overpressured stratigraphic units present in the North Alpine Foreland Basin in SE Germany. However, previous works by Müller et al. (1988), Müller and Nieberding (1996) and Drews et al. (2018) were either based on drilling mud weight data and/or 1 D velocity data of hydrocarbon wells, but did not incorporate 3 D geologic models. Furthermore, these studies did not include any more recent deep geothermal wells from the North Alpine Foreland Basin in SE Germany, despite several deep geothermal wells have been drilled in the overpressured part of the basin during the past 2  decades.|$|R
40|$|Context. To {{determine}} the physical parameters of a transiting planet and its host star from photometric and spectroscopic analysis, {{it is essential}} to independently measure the stellar mass. This is often achieved by the use of evolutionary tracks and isochrones, but the mass result is only as reliable as the models used. Aims. The recent paper by Torres et al (2009) showed that accurate values for stellar masses and radii could be obtained from a calibration using Te f f, log g and [Fe/H]. We investigate whether a similarly good calibration can be obtained by substituting log ρ-the fundamental parameter measured for the host star of a <b>transiting</b> planet- for <b>log</b> g, and apply this to star-exoplanet systems. Methods. We perform a polynomial fit to stellar binary data provided in Torres et al (2009) to obtain the stellar mass and radius as functions of Te f f, log ρ and [Fe/H], with uncertainties on the fit produced from a Monte Carlo analysis. We apply the resulting equations to measurements for seventeen SuperWASP host stars, and also demonstrate the application of the calibration in a Markov Chain Monte Carlo analysis to obtain accurate system parameters where spectroscopic estimates of effective stellar temperature and metallicity are available. Results. We show that the calibration using log ρ produces accurate values for the stellar masses and radii; we obtain masses and radii of the SuperWASP stars in good agreement with isochrone analysis results. We ascertain that the mass calibration is robust against uncertainties resulting from poor photometry, although a good estimate of stellar radius requires good-quality transit light curve to {{determine the}} duration of ingress and egress.

40|$|The {{aim of this}} bachelor’s {{thesis is}} to discuss the {{problems}} related to communication in the Arctic and to present solutions that are used on board the vessels and offshore installations operating in the area today. We also investigate the future activity in the Arctic {{and what kind of}} communication solutions could be used in the near future. Traffic in the Arctic is increasing as ice is retracting, new technologies are developing and natural resources are becoming more available. The demand for connectivity is increasing and the communication services provided today are not sufficient. The oil and gas sector represent {{only a fraction of the}} vessel traffic in the area, but is at the same time regarded as the main driver for future infrastructure and opportunities. There are potential future solutions solving the communication issues in the Arctic, such as using Unmanned Aerial Vehicles and High Earth Orbit satellites, but these require large initial investments. Satellite communication is the optimal solution for fisheries, cargo- and cruise ships. Satellite coverage will be sufficient for fishing- and cargo vessels sailing below the latitude 74 ° north, when the new Thor 7 satellite and the Inmarsat 5 satellites become fully operational. The basic operational needs of a cruise ship are also met, but the bandwidth demand from passenger use cannot be met now or even in the near future. Vessels operating in the arctic will have a better SAR connectivity solution with the new Iridium Next satellites, which also cover the extreme Polar Regions. For all vessels, connectivity beyond 74 ° north is uncertain and the capacity inadequate for any other use than SAR operations and low data communication. Offshore installations require high bandwidth and thus a fibre optic solution is optimal. Microwave technology could be used, meanwhile satellite communication is regarded by the industry as too slow for Integrated Operations. Redundancy is a must for oil & gas operations, therefore having different technologies available is highly recommended. Offshore vessels and shuttle tankers can use satellites while in <b>transit</b> and then <b>log</b> on to wireless networks provided by the offshore installations. The conclusions presented is a result of researching news, technology articles, business presentations, industry predictions and communication with different players in the offshore communication industry...|$|R
40|$|As {{large volumes}} of data become {{increasingly}} available, new opportunities arise to harness their potential for urban studies. Data visualization is vital for this purpose, particularly in tackling fuzzy problems that require an explorative process of discovery to re-frame. This research investigates how data visualization {{can be used to}} harness big data for domain specific challenges in urban studies. To address this question, I demonstrate the utility of data visualization in four different case studies and developed a framework to compare their outcomes from design to application. Based on this comparison, I show how data visualization facilitates discovery, contemplation and presentation amongst other roles. Reflecting on my experience from this research, I discuss the factors to consider when developing data visualizations for particular roles in urban studies, and share my thoughts on the need for novel visualization techniques. Case Study 1. “BinSq” is a novel gridded dot density mapping technique designed to visualize voluminous geographic datasets. The technique was applied to a large dataset of language referenced, geotagged Twitter data to reveal ethnic communities in Brussels. This work contributes to data visualization research and urban studies. Case Study 2. In “Mapping Cilento: Using Geotagged Social Media Data to Characterize Tourist Flows in Southern Italy”, a novel analytical technique was developed to characterize tourist flows with geotagged Twitter data. The resulting insights from analysis extended the existing understanding of tourist movements in Southern Italy. Case Study 3. In “Who Is Really Using FixMyStreet? Studying the extent of Socio-Demographic Inequality in Crowdsourced Civic Participation on FixMyStreet Brussels”, visual analysis of geotagged data from a web-based civic participation platform led to several statistically significant findings which, reveal the extent of socio-demographic inequality on that platform. Case Study 4. In “What Public <b>Transit</b> API Query <b>Logs</b> Tell Us About Travel Flows”, visualizations of query logs from a route planning API provided experts in transportation studies with an alternative perspective of public transit demand in Belgium. The insights obtained were published in a news article and eventually paved the way for discussions with public transport service providers.
