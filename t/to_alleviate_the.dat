5|$|After U-3s {{arrival at}} Pola in January 1909, she was {{commissioned}} into the Austro-Hungarian Navy on 12 September 1909 as SM U-3. During {{the evaluation of}} the U-3 class conducted by the Navy, the class' poor diving and handling characteristics were noted. <b>To</b> <b>alleviate</b> <b>the</b> diving problems, U-3s fins were changed in size and shape several times, and eventually, the front diving planes were removed and a stationary stern flap was affixed to the hull. U-3 served as a training boat between 1910 and 1914 and made as many as ten cruises per month in that capacity.|$|E

The Army attempted <b>to</b> <b>alleviate</b> <b>the</b> strain on its troops during late 1977 by recruiting French-speakers as well, and formed a designated company in the Rhodesia Regiment for them. The regiment already had six independent companies, so the Francophone unit became 7 Independent Company.|$|E
5|$|In 1858, the Mint tried <b>to</b> <b>alleviate</b> <b>the</b> {{breakage}} problem using a {{new version}} of the cent with a shallower relief. This attempt led to the major variety of the series, as coins of the revised version have smaller letters in the inscriptions than those struck earlier. The two varieties are about equally common, and were probably struck side by side for some period as the Mint used up older dies. Efforts to conserve dies were the probable cause of another variety, the 1858/7, as 1857-dated dies were overstruck to allow them to be used in the new year.|$|E

5|$|Although it is {{difficult}} to convince his fellow Hominidae to follow him, Pitar manages to persuade the patriarchal leader of the clan, Costello, who has taken command from the recently deceased Thorn. The band builds windbreaks to help them descend more often from the trees, thus exposing them to a higher risk of being attacked by predators on the ground. A rivalry emerges between Costello and another band member, Re, who not only questions the leading abilities of the present alpha but also desires Costello's females. <b>To</b> <b>alleviate</b> <b>the</b> escalating debate of authority, Pitar tries to implement a parliament to settle disputes peacefully. Costello, however, considers the parliament to be a forum in which he can consolidate his power, citing famous speeches by Winston Churchill and Abraham Lincoln; the other members ruin this noble idea with their lack of discipline and ostentatious indifference.|$|E
