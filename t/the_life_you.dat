2500|$|His own organisation, <b>The</b> <b>Life</b> <b>You</b> Can Save, also {{recommends}} {{a selection of}} charities deemed by charity evaluators such as GiveWell {{to be the most}} effective when it comes to helping those in extreme poverty. TLYC was founded after Singer released his 2009 eponymous book, in which he argues more generally in favour of giving to charities that help to end global poverty. In particular, he expands upon some of the arguments made in his 1972 essay [...] "Famine, Affluence and Morality", in which he posits that citizens of rich nations are morally obligated to give at least some of their disposable income to charities that help the global poor. He supports this using the drowning child analogy, which states that most people would rescue a drowning child from a pond, even if it meant that their expensive clothes were ruined, so we clearly value a human life more than the value of our material possessions. As a result, we should take {{a significant portion of the}} money that we spend on our possessions and instead donate it to charity.|$|E
