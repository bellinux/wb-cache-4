5|$|Kennedy's body lay in repose at St. Patrick's Cathedral in New York for {{two days}} before a funeral Mass was held on June 8.

5|$|Ranking Democratic {{committee}} member Patrick Leahy objected <b>to</b> <b>Republican</b> {{use of a}} secret hold {{to slow down the}} Sotomayor nomination, and Leahy attributed that anonymous tactic to GOP reticence about publicly opposing a female Hispanic nominee. The prior month, Leahy had triggered a procedural delay in the confirmation of fellow Second Circuit nominee Chester J. Straub—who, although advanced by Clinton and supported by Senator Moynihan, was considered much more acceptable by Republicans—in an unsuccessful effort to force earlier consideration of the Sotomayor confirmation.|$|E
5|$|The adverse results {{momentarily}} {{put a stop}} <b>to</b> <b>Republican</b> {{calls to}} impeach Johnson, who was elated by the elections. Nevertheless, once Congress met in November, the Judiciary Committee reversed itself and passed a resolution of impeachment against Johnson. After much debate about whether anything the President had done was a high crime or misdemeanor, the standard under the Constitution, the resolution was defeated by the House of Representatives on December 7, 1867, {{by a vote of}} 57 in favor to 108 opposed.|$|E
5|$|After {{his term}} as governor, Brown again {{returned}} to his legal practice in Louisville. He was an unsuccessful candidate for the House of Representatives in 1896, losing <b>to</b> <b>Republican</b> Walter Evans. He would later claim that he had only run {{in order to improve}} Democratic voter turnout for William Jennings Bryan's 1896 presidential bid.

5|$|After the gubernatorial {{election}} in 1999, Louisville senator Dan Seum {{announced he would}} change his party affiliation from Democrat <b>to</b> <b>Republican,</b> citing his conservative voting history, including opposition to the state lottery, KERA, and abortion. This switch, which Patton learned of too late to intervene, equalized the number of Democrats and Republicans in the Senate. Six weeks later, Paducah senator Bob Leeper announced he would also change his party affiliation. Patton traveled to Paducah and met with Leeper, {{but was unable to}} convince him to remain a Democrat. Leeper had a history of conflict with Democratic Senate President Larry Saunders, but he insisted his party switch, like Seum's, was based on political philosophy. Leeper's switch gave Republicans a majority in the Senate {{for the first time in}} the state's history. David Williams was elected President of the Senate, and held the Republican majority together effectively. Consequently, Patton faced a difficult task in maneuvering his agenda through a divided General Assembly.|$|E
5|$|Arthur {{was born}} in Fairfield, Vermont, grew up in upstate New York, and practiced law in New York City. He served as {{quartermaster}} general in the New York Militia during the American Civil War. Following the war, he devoted more time <b>to</b> <b>Republican</b> politics and quickly rose in the political machine run by New York Senator Roscoe Conkling. Appointed by President Ulysses S. Grant to the lucrative and politically powerful post of Collector of the Port of New York in 1871, Arthur was an important supporter of Conkling and the Stalwart faction of the Republican Party. In 1878, the new president, Rutherford B. Hayes, fired Arthur {{as part of a}} plan to reform the federal patronage system in New York. When Garfield won the Republican nomination for president in 1880, Arthur, an eastern Stalwart, was nominated for vice president to balance the ticket.|$|E
