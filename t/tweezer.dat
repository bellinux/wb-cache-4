25|$|At {{very short}} time scales, however, the motion of a {{particle}} is dominated by its inertia and its displacement will be linearly dependent on time: Δx = vΔt. So the instantaneous velocity of the Brownian motion can be measured as v = Δx/Δt, when Δt << τ, where τ is the momentum relaxation time. In 2010, the instantaneous velocity of a Brownian particle (a glass microsphere trapped in air with an optical <b>tweezer)</b> was measured successfully. The velocity data verified the Maxwell–Boltzmann velocity distribution, and the equipartition theorem for a Brownian particle.|$|E

In the American fashion industry it is common to refer to a single pair of pants as a pant —though this is a back-formation, the English word (deriving from the French pantalon) was originally singular. In the same field, one half of a pair of scissors separated from the other half is, rather illogically, referred to as a half-scissor.

25|$|After {{thoroughly}} {{cleaning the}} diamond, the diamond {{is picked up}} using tweezers in a girdle-to-girdle hold. The grader views the diamond {{for the first time}} through the table, studying the culet area of the stone for inclusions. The diamond is then set down and picked up with the tweezers in a table-to-culet hold. In this position, the diamond can be studied from the pavilion side, and the crown side, examining the diamond through each facet for inclusions. Once a sector of the diamond has been thoroughly examined, the grader rotates the diamond in the <b>tweezer,</b> so that the neighboring sector can be examined. The grader uses darkfield lighting to reveal characteristics, and alternates to reflected, overhead lighting to ascertain whether a characteristic lies within the stone, on the stones surface, or both. If the grader is using a stereo microscope, she may zoom in to a higher magnification to make closer observations of an inclusion, but then return to 10x magnification to make an assessment of its impact on the clarity grade.|$|E

These techniques include so-called force spectroscopy approaches such as atomic force microscopy, optical <b>tweezers,</b> flow stretching, and magnetic <b>tweezers.</b> Amongst these approaches, magnetic <b>tweezers</b> have distinguished themselves by their ability to apply torque while maintaining a constant stretching force. Here, it is illustrated how such a “conventional ” magnetic <b>tweezers</b> experimental configuration can, through a straightforward modification of its field configuration to minimize the magnitude of the transverse field, be adapted to measure the degree of twist in a biological molecule. The resulting configuration is termed the freely-orbiting magnetic <b>tweezers.</b> Additionally, it is shown how further modification of the field configuration can yield a transverse field with a magnitude intermediate between that of the “conventional ” magnetic <b>tweezers</b> and the freely-orbiting magnetic <b>tweezers,</b> which makes it possible to directly measure the torque stored in a biological molecule. This configuration is termed the magnetic torque <b>tweezers.</b> The accompanying video explains in detail how the conversion of conventional magnetic <b>tweezers</b> into freely-orbiting magnetic <b>tweezers</b> and magnetic torque <b>tweezers</b> can be accomplished, and demonstrates the use of these techniques. These adaptations maintain all the strengths of conventional magnetic <b>tweezers</b> while greatly expanding the versatility of this powerful instrument...|$|R
50|$|<b>Tweezers</b> come in {{a variety}} of tip shapes and sizes. Blunt tip <b>tweezers</b> have a rounded end which can be used when a pointed object may get entangled, when {{manipulating}} cotton swabs, for example. Flat tip <b>tweezers,</b> pictured at right, have an angled tip which may be used for removing splinters. Some <b>tweezers</b> have a long needle-like tip which may be useful for reaching into small crevices. Triangular tip <b>tweezers</b> have larger, wider tips useful for gripping larger objects. <b>Tweezers</b> with curved tips also exist, sometimes called bent forceps. Microtweezers have an extremely small, pointed tip used for manipulating tiny electronic components and the like.|$|R
2500|$|The {{most basic}} optical <b>tweezer</b> setup will likely include the {{following}} components: a laser (usually [...] ), a beam expander, some optics used to steer the beam location in the sample plane, a microscope objective and condenser to create the trap in the sample plane, a position detector (e.g. quadrant photodiode) to measure beam displacements and a microscope illumination source coupled to a CCD camera.|$|E
2500|$|An [...] (1064nm wavelength) is {{a common}} choice of laser for working with {{biological}} specimens. This is because such specimens (being mostly water) have a low absorption coefficient at this wavelength. A low absorption is advisable so as to minimise damage to the biological material, {{sometimes referred to as}} opticution. Perhaps the most important consideration in optical <b>tweezer</b> design is the choice of the objective. A stable trap requires that the gradient force, which is dependent upon the numerical aperture (NA) of the objective, be greater than the scattering force. Suitable objectives typically have an NA between 1.2 and 1.4.|$|E

The connectors are attached to flexible, well insulated leads terminated with connectors appropriate for the meter. Probes are connected to portable meters typically by shrouded or recessed banana jacks, while benchtop meters may use banana jacks or BNC connectors. 2mm plugs and binding posts have also been used at times, but are less commonly used today.

40|$|Optical <b>tweezers</b> {{have been}} an {{important}} tool in biology and physics for studying single molecules and colloidal systems. Most of current optical <b>tweezers</b> are built with microscope objectives, which are: i) expensive, ii) bulky and hard to integrate, iii) sensitive to environmental fluctuations, iv) limited in terms of working distances from the substrate, and v) rigid with the requirements on the substrate (transparent substrate made with glass and with a fixed thickness). These limitations of objective-based optical <b>tweezers</b> prevent them from being miniaturized. Fiber optical <b>tweezers</b> can provide a solution for cost reduction and miniaturization, and these optical <b>tweezers</b> can be potentially used in microfluidic systems. However, the existing fiber optical <b>tweezers</b> have the following limitations: i) low trapping efficiency due to weakly focused beams, ii) lack {{of the ability to}} control the positions of multiple particles simultaneously, and iii) limited functionalities. The overall objective of this dissertation work is to further the fundamental understanding of fiber optical <b>tweezers</b> through experimental study and modeling, and to develop novel fiber optical <b>tweezers</b> systems to enhance the capability and functionalities of fiber optical <b>tweezers</b> as microscale and nanoscale manipulators/sensors.

2500|$|Expanding {{the beam}} emitted from the laser {{to fill the}} {{aperture}} of the objective {{will result in a}} tighter, diffraction-limited spot. While lateral translation of the trap relative to the sample can be accomplished by translation of the microscope slide, most <b>tweezer</b> setups have additional optics designed to translate the beam to give an extra degree of translational freedom. This can be done by translating the first of the two lenses labelled as [...] "Beam Steering" [...] in the figure. For example, translation of that lens in the lateral plane will result in a laterally deflected beam from what is drawn in the figure. If the distance between the beam steering lenses and the objective is chosen properly, this will correspond to a similar deflection before entering the objective and a resulting lateral translation in the sample plane. The position of the beam waist, that is the focus of the optical trap, can be adjusted by an axial displacement of the initial lens. Such an axial displacement causes the beam to diverge or converge slightly, the end result of which is an axially displaced position of the beam waist in the sample chamber.|$|E

Since the first demonstration of acoustic <b>tweezers,</b> various applications have required the trapping of not only one, but more particles simultaneously in both the axial and lateral direction. In this research, a method is proposed to create multiple trapping patterns, to prove the feasibility of trapping micro-particles. It has potential ability to electronically control the location and movement of the particles in real-time.
