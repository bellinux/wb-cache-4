5|$|Due to {{its vast}} size {{and range of}} altitudes, Argentina {{possesses}} {{a wide variety of}} climatic regions, ranging from the hot subtropical region in the north to the cold subantarctic in the far south. Lying between <b>those</b> <b>is</b> the Pampas region, featuring a mild and humid climate. Many regions have different, often contrasting, microclimates. In general, Argentina has four main climate types: warm, moderate, arid, and cold in which the relief features, and the latitudinal extent of the country, determine the different varieties within the main climate types.|$|E

In the nucleus, the processing of rRNA and snoRNA by the exosome is mediated by the TRAMP complex, which contains both RNA helicase (Mtr4) and polyadenylation (Trf4) activity.|$|E

5|$|The vast size, {{and wide}} range of altitudes, {{contribute}} to Argentina's diverse climate. Argentina possesses {{a wide variety of}} climatic regions ranging from subtropical in the north to subantarctic in the far south. Lying between <b>those</b> <b>is</b> the Pampas region, which features a mild and humid climate. Consequently, there is a wide variety of biomes in the country, including subtropical rain forests, semi-arid and arid regions, temperate plains in the Pampas, and cold subantarctic in the south. However, despite the diversity of biomes, about two-thirds of Argentina is arid or semi-arid. In general, Argentina has four main climate types: warm, moderate, arid, and cold, all determined by the expanse across latitude, range in altitude, and relief features. Argentina is best divided into six distinct regions reflecting the climatic conditions of the country as a whole. From north to south, these regions are Northwest, Chaco, Northeast, Cuyo/Monte, Pampas, and Patagonia. Each climatic region has distinctive types of vegetation.|$|E

500|$|The state officially {{labeled the}} All-China Women's Federation an NGO in 1995.

Even the ACWF hesitates using the term NGO within China because it has been linked to anti-government groups, although it has embraced the title internationally. International donor agencies generally are more likely to work with NGO's, so the classification of an NGO has helped the ACWF obtain financing from international organizations. [...] Others believe that the ACWF classifies as an NGO because it has separated itself from the government in recent years, and still others believes that ACWF could be classified as a NGO if the definition was broadened.

500|$|In December 2010, {{following}} Gary Speed's {{departure from}} the job as manager of Sheffield United for the position as the head coach of Wales, Adams {{was one of a}} handful of names linked to the vacant position at United. On Christmas Eve, Vale chairman Bill Bratt announced he had [...] "reluctantly" [...] given Adams permission to talk to Sheffield United. Six days later it was announced that he would be taking the position, and he announced his three aims as manager would be to firstly avoid relegation, to then challenge for promotion, and finally [...] "to develop a structure that will build us a reputation for home grown talent that fans can be proud of in their team". Former United player Alan Cork was installed as his assistant, Cork had worked as Adams' assistant at Fulham, Swansea, Leicester and Coventry. The fourth manager at the club that season, he brought in Dave Bassett in a consultancy role after finding managing the club a bigger task than he had previously assumed. As Adams explained: [...] "When you're manager at Port Vale you probably get three calls a day and one of <b>those</b> <b>is</b> from the wife asking me what time I'm coming home for my tea." [...] His honeymoon period dissipated quickly, as United failed to win in his first eleven games in charge (four draws and seven defeats) and slipped into 23rd spot after letting slip a two-goal lead to lose 3–2 to fellow relegation strugglers Scunthorpe United. Adams told the press that [...] "The fans were singing 'you're not fit to wear the shirt', I cannot disagree with them. That is as disappointing a result as I have ever had in my career." [...] It took three months before he achieved his first win. The victory came on 8 March 2011 (his fourteenth game in charge), as his side came from behind to beat Nottingham Forest 2–1. Sheffield United were relegated to League One at the end of the season, finishing six points short of safety. Adams and United parted company after a meeting with owner Kevin McCabe. McCabe stated that he wished to initiate a [...] "clean sweep at the top and start afresh"; whilst Adams said that whilst he was [...] "very, very disappointed with the decision... I am a Blade and will always be a Blade." ...|$|E
