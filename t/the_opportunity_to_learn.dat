Since 2006, pre-school children have been given <b>the</b> <b>opportunity</b> <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> indigenous Kanak languages. While the Kanak languages have been taught in high schools across the Loyalty Islands and North Province, the language education has not been as common in the more European South Province.

40|$|The aim of {{this review}} study is (a) to define <b>the</b> concept of <b>opportunities</b> <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> (OTL) as a {{theoretical}} category, (b) to present selected research tools that are most commonly used for investigating <b>opportunities,</b> and (c) <b>to</b> compare differences in defining and using <b>opportunities</b> <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> as a theoretical category in the Czech Republic and in the U. S., where the concept originated. In {{the first part of}} the study, a specific historical development of defining <b>opportunities</b> <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> is presented. Initially, <b>the</b> <b>opportunities</b> <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> were viewed as a theoretical category comprising the coherence between content of teaching and content requirements of (standardized) tests or curricula. Later, <b>the</b> scope of <b>opportunities</b> <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> expanded towards examining school-dependent variables and school-independent variables related to school performance of students. In the second part of <b>the</b> study <b>opportunities</b> <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> are operationalised, including examples of methods and techniques used for their investigation. On an example of selected research, the study shows that <b>the</b> concept of <b>opportunities</b> <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> in <b>the</b> U. S. primarily covers complex research-based analyses of the relationship between teaching and learning. This contrasts with <b>the</b> use of <b>opportunities</b> <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> as a theoretical concept in the Czech Republic, where <b>opportunities</b> <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> mainly represent a theoretical basis for conducting microanalyses of teaching...|$|R

30|$|To better {{understand}} student and instructor perceptions of <b>the</b> <b>opportunities</b> <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> difficult material in their calculus classes, we explore {{factors related to}} both {{the internal and external}} framing of the course. Since introductory calculus serves many client disciplines and is taught to a large number of students, there are often significant external factors that may guide (or dictate) what material is covered in class and how. From the instructors’ perspective, there are also factors that are more internal to the classroom that guide coverage, such as the instructor’s view of the students he or she is teaching. For instructors, teaching a course with a common final and teaching to a very mixed group of perceived student ability levels both negatively impact instructors’ perception of their ability to provide OTLs to all students. We also explored what factors relate to the students’ perceptions of <b>the</b> <b>opportunities</b> <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> provided in class. Our analyses indicate that for the students, being male, having had high school calculus (compared to no previous calculus experience), a belief that they can succeed in mathematics, and more student-centered instruction are all related to positive OTL experience.|$|R
