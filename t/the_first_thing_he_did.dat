25|$|Shortly after Moreira married Vicenta, his {{troubles}} began. The Deputy Mayor of the area, known as Don Francisco, had also {{fallen in love}} with La Vicenta, so as a form of vengeance he began charging Moreira fines for everything he could think of, real or imaginary. <b>The</b> <b>first</b> <b>thing</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> was charge Moreira 500 pesos for having his wedding celebration without proper authorization.|$|E
25|$|His {{adoptive father}} was a {{hard-working}} coal miner, but the family still had trouble making ends meet. Gavin quit school after eighth grade and became a full-time clerk at a shoe store for $12.50 a week. His next stint was as a manager for Jewel Oil Company. A combination of restlessness and limited future opportunities in his hometown caused Gavin {{to run away from}} home. In March 1924, on his 17th birthday, he took the night train to New York. <b>The</b> <b>first</b> <b>thing</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> upon arriving was to send a telegram to his parents saying everything was all right to prevent them from reporting him missing to the police. After that, he started looking for a job.|$|E
25|$|In 1875, he {{was named}} Fellow of Corpus Christi College, Oxford and in 1876 assumed the new Chair of Chinese Language and Literature at Oxford, where he {{attracted}} few students to his lectures but worked hard for some 20 years in his study at 3 Keble Terrace, on his translations of the Chinese classics. According to an anonymous contemporary obituary in the Pall Mall Gazette, Legge was in his study every morning at three o'clock, winter and summer, having retired to bed at ten. When he {{got up in the}} morning <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>thing</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> was to make himself a cup of tea over a spirit-lamp. Then he worked away at his translations while all the household slept.|$|E

25|$|Accounts differ as to {{the next}} {{sequence}} of events. After the collision, Lifsh said that <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>thing</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> {{was to try to}} lift the car in order to free the two children beneath it. The EMS unit that arrived on the scene about three minutes after the accident said that Lifsh was being beaten and pulled out of the station wagon by three or four men. A volunteer ambulance from the Hatzolah ambulance corps arrived on the scene at about 8:23pm, followed by police and a City ambulance, which took Gavin Cato to Kings County Hospital, arriving at 8:32pm; Cato was pronounced dead shortly thereafter. Volunteers from a second Hatzolah ambulance helped Angela Cato, until a second City ambulance arrived and took her to the same hospital.|$|E
500|$|After leaving {{school with}} A-levels in English, History and Economics, Dickinson confessed, [...] "I didn't {{really know what}} I wanted to do." [...] <b>The</b> <b>first</b> <b>thing</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> was join the Territorial Army for six months. Although he enjoyed {{his time in the}} TA, Dickinson {{realised}} {{that it was not a}} career choice, and so he applied for a place to read history at Queen Mary College, London. His parents wanted him in the army, but he told them that he wanted to get a degree first, which acted as his [...] "cover story", and immediately began playing in bands.|$|E
500|$|... "Radio Bart" [...] {{was written}} by Jon Vitti and {{directed}} by Carlos Baeza, though series creator Matt Groening {{came up with the}} idea for it. The episode was based on the 1951 film Ace in the Hole, which sees the story of a down-and-out journalist exploiting a story about a man trapped in a cave to re-jump start his career. Vitti did not watch the film until after the episode had been written; [...] " [...] came in out of nowhere and just gave me, start to finish, the whole story." [...] Vitti said renting the film was <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>thing</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> after finishing the script. He remarked, [...] "It's surprisingly hard to rent. It's really dark and funny and it's by Billy Wilder, so you think it would be in stores, but it's not. It was hard to find." ...|$|E
6000|$|He took a bite, and he said, [...] "My, that's nice!" [...] and <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>thing</b> <b>he</b> knew he ate {{the whole}} piece up. [...] "Well, never mind," [...] he said, [...] "we can begin to-morrow just as well." ...|$|R

500|$|As Edgeworth {{had been}} a popular {{character}} ever since start of the series, Takumi {{found it difficult to}} come up with a way to bring him back without having him, a supposedly great prosecutor, always lose to Phoenix. While he was writing the story for the game's final case, he thought of the idea to have Edgeworth become a player character; he liked this idea so much that he immediately started to rewrite the case. In order to allow Edgeworth to be the player character, <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>thing</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> was to [...] "get rid of" [...] Phoenix by having him fall from a bridge into an icy river. He enjoyed writing from another character's perspective, who thought differently from Phoenix; he also used the case to explore the relationship between Edgeworth and Gumshoe. One of the game's episodes had originally been written for Justice for All: it had been intended as the fourth episode of Justice for All, but was cut due to memory limiations, and ended up being reused as the third episode of Trials and Tribulations.|$|E
2500|$|Upon {{arriving}} in New York he {{was met by}} his sister Priscilla. <b>The</b> <b>first</b> <b>thing</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> was visit El Barrio, New York's [...] "Spanish Harlem." [...] HÃ©ctor was disappointed by the condition of El Barrio which he had envisioned would have [...] "fancy Cadillacs, tall marble skyscrapers and tree-lined streets." [...] Hector tried {{to earn a living}} as a painter, messenger, porter and concierge.|$|E
2500|$|When Frank Miller {{expanded}} most of Daredevil's abilities, {{he attempted}} to make them [...] "extraordinary enough to be exciting, but not on par with Superman", noting Superman's distinctly unbelievable powers. When Miller joined the title in 1979, <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>thing</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> to the character was [...] "revamp" [...] his radar sense and made it less distinct and more believable; he wanted Daredevil to have the [...] "proximity" [...] sense that some martial artists claim to have. Due to the character's sensitive sense of touch, Daredevil can read by passing his fingers over the letters on a page though laminated pages prevent him from reading the ink. Daredevil has commonly used his superhuman hearing {{to serve as a}} polygraph for interrogation by listening for changes in a person's heartbeat. This ability can be fooled if the other person's heart is not beating at a natural rate, such as if they have an artificial pacemaker.|$|E

2500|$|In {{the late}} seventies, Jones {{spiraled}} out of control. [...] Already drinking constantly, a manager named Shug Baggot {{introduced him to}} cocaine before a show {{because he was too}} tired to perform. [...] The drug would increase Jones' already considerable paranoia. [...] During one drunken binge he shot at, and very nearly hit, his friend and occasional songwriting partner Earl [...] "Peanutt" [...] Montgomery after Montgomery had quit drinking after finding religion. [...] He was often penniless and acknowledged in his autobiography that Waylon Jennings and Johnny Cash came to his financial aid during this time. [...] Jones also began missing shows at an alarming rate and lawsuits from promoters started piling up. [...] In 1978, owing Wynette $36,000 in child support and claiming to be one million dollars in debt, he filed for bankruptcy. [...] Jones appeared incoherent at times, speaking in quarrelling voices that he would later call [...] "the Duck" [...] and [...] "the Old Man". [...] In his article [...] "The Devil In George Jones", Nick Tosches states, [...] "By February 1979 he was homeless, deranged, and destitute, living in his car and barely able to digest the junk food on which he subsisted. [...] He weighed under a hundred pounds, and his condition was so bad that it took him more than two years to complete My Very Special Guests, an album on which Willie Nelson, Linda Ronstadt, Elvis Costello, and other famous fans came to his vocal aid and support. [...] Jones entered Hillcrest Psychiatric Hospital in Birmingham, Alabama. [...] Upon his release in January 1980, <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>thing</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> was pick up a six-pack." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "No, I {{think it}} was a three-horned elephant," [...] replied Jack, who was not then in the best of humor. He hated to have <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>thing</b> <b>he</b> shot at get away from him.|$|R
