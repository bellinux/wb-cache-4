5|$|In 1922, an {{important}} {{year of his}} life, Escher <b>traveled</b> <b>through</b> Italy, visiting Florence, San Gimignano, Volterra, Siena, and Ravello. In the same year he <b>traveled</b> <b>through</b> Spain, visiting Madrid, Toledo, and Granada. He {{was impressed by the}} Italian countryside, and in Granada by the Moorish architecture of the fourteenth-century Alhambra. The intricate decorative designs of the Alhambra, based on geometrical symmetries featuring interlocking repetitive patterns in the coloured tiles or sculpted into the walls and ceilings, triggered his interest in the mathematics of tessellation, and became a powerful influence on his work.|$|E

5|$|In {{the period}} between 1866 and 1899, cattle ranches in Texas strove {{to meet the demands}} for food in eastern cities and railroads in Kansas promised to deliver in a timely manner.

In 1881, four of five major cattle trails on the western frontier <b>traveled</b> <b>through</b> Indian Territory.|$|E

5|$|The early-to-mid 1800s were {{a period}} of intense debate on the particle-versus-wave nature of light. Although the {{observation}} of the Arago spot in 1819 may seem to have settled the matter definitively in favor of Fresnel's wave theory of light, various concerns continued {{to appear to be}} addressed more satisfactorily by Newton's corpuscular theory. Arago had suggested in 1838 that a differential comparison of the speed of light in air versus water would serve to prove or disprove the wave nature of light. In 1850, racing against Foucault to establish this point, Fizeau engaged L.F.C. Breguet to build a rotary-mirror apparatus in which he split a beam of light into two beams, passing one through water while the other <b>traveled</b> <b>through</b> air. Beaten by Foucault by a mere seven weeks, he confirmed that the speed of light was greater as it <b>traveled</b> <b>through</b> air, validating the wave theory of light.|$|E
