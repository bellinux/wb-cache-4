5|$|Robert van Voren {{noted that}} {{after the fall of}} the Berlin Wall, it became {{apparent}} that the political abuse of psychiatry in the USSR was only the tip of the iceberg, <b>the</b> <b>sign</b> <b>that</b> much more was basically wrong. This much more realistic image of Soviet psychiatry showed up only after the Soviet regime began to loosen its grip on society and later lost control over the developments and in the end entirely disintegrated. It demonstrated that the actual situation was much sorer and that many individuals had been affected. Millions of individuals were treated and stigmatized by an outdated biologically oriented and hospital-based mental health service. Living conditions in clinics were bad, sometimes even terrible, and violations of human rights were rampant. According to the data of a census published in 1992, the mortality of the ill with schizophrenia exceeded that of the general population by 4–6 times for the age of 20–39 years, by 3–4 times for the age of 30–39 years, by 1.5–2 times for the age over 40 years (larger values are for women).|$|E

In the book , Duncan Beard said the episode served as a parody of the peculiarities of the American convenience store. Beard particularly cited the Muzak and the dinging bell as Homer and Apu entered the Kwik-E-Mart in India, and <b>the</b> <b>sign</b> <b>that</b> read, [...] "The Master Knows All (except combination to safe)". Beard said, [...] "Here the show presents its own instance of the global culture of consumer capitalism, transplanted intact and indistinguishably unaltered from the suburbs of America to a mountain top in some indefinable region of the post-partitioned Commonwealth nation of India, purely for the purpose of parodically criticizing the banality of quick-stop stores." ...|$|E
500|$|With {{fan support}} and the trio touring nonstop, the album's sales began to improve. The {{momentum}} from touring helped Dude Ranch sell 3,000–4,000 units a week, and the record sold 40,000 copies by August. Dude Ranch was promoted by the label through board-sport magazines and tie-ins between surf shops and record retailers. At retail, MCA and Cargo organized midnight sales promotions on the West Coast. The popularity of the trio in Australia has been cited as <b>the</b> <b>sign</b> <b>that</b> alerted major record companies of Dude Ranch commercial potential; at the time, Dude Ranch had spent five months on the charts and the band became famous for their staged show while on the 1997 Warped Tour. Thanks to increased recognition, the band dropped Cargo and fully signed with MCA in 1998 to handle increased distribution. Hardcore punk purists asserted the band were betraying their indie roots by even considering major label proposals and began to address the band as [...] "sell-outs".|$|E

500|$|In the 2016 MLS Cup Final against Seattle, held at BMO Field on 10 December, Giovinco's {{performance}} was largely stifled by Seattle's heavy and aggressive defending, despite initially creating an early goalscoring chance for Altidore; throughout the match, he was fouled {{a total of}} six times and had several shots blocked. A scoring opportunity came in the 48th minute, but his shot was skewed wide of the near post. He was eventually substituted for Tosaint Ricketts in the 103rd minute, due to an apparent injury, and consequently, despite being the club's main penalty kick taker, was not used in the resulting shoot-out, which Toronto lost 5–4, following a 0–0 draw after extra-time. Regarding Giovinco's surprising substitution, Toronto's coach, Greg Vanney, stated in the post-match press conference: [...] "He couldn't move. He looked at me. It's not like I take him off because I want to. I look at him and he gives me <b>the</b> <b>sign</b> <b>that</b> he can’t go any more and when he feels like he can’t go, he feels like he’s more of a liability to the group than anything. That’s the decision. It's not one that I generally want to make, but we had to." ...|$|E

The hand moves {{counterclockwise}} instead of clockwise. The timer is placed in front a variety of clock gears. Every 10 seconds the hour indicators around the clock face glow red. Meanwhile, the upper segment of the Toshiba billboard shows more gears and the 2010 sign slowly being lifted up towards the ball, becoming 2010 as it neared {{the top of the}} sign. At midnight, the hand stops ticking and the words [...] "Happy New Year!" [...] flip out and <b>the</b> <b>sign</b> <b>that</b> once showed the numbers 2010 on the upper half of the Toshiba Vision comes back down and says [...] "TOSHIBA" [...] instead. This was the first countdown utilizing Toshiba's new interlocking display system known as ToshibaVision. The countdown made its only appearance on Dick Clark's New Year's Rockin' Eve to simulcast on the lower right corner, via camera. The countdown's theme was loosely based on the entrance to the Paramount Building in Times Square. This countdown is also used for the Global Countdown ceremonies that take place in Times Square on December 31, replacing the year with the current year, then rolling to the next year.|$|E

2500|$|Already {{in medieval}} Latin palaeography, <b>the</b> <b>sign</b> <b>that</b> in Spanish {{came to be}} called virgulilla (meaning [...] "little comma") was used over a vowel to {{indicate}} a following nasal consonant (n or m) that had been omitted, as in tãtus for tantus or quã for quam. This usage was passed on to other languages using the Latin alphabet although it was subsequently dropped by most. Spanish retained it, however, in some specific cases, particularly to indicate the palatal nasal, the sound that is now spelt as ñ. The word tilde comes from Spanish, derived by metathesis of the word título as tidlo, this originally from Latin TITULUS [...] "title" [...] or [...] "heading"; compare cabildo with Latin CAPITULUM.|$|E

2500|$|Deir el Qamar is {{a village}} in south-central Lebanon, five {{kilometers}} outside of Beiteddine, consisting of stone houses with red-tiled roofs. During the 16th to 18th centuries, Deir el Qamar was the residence of the governors of Lebanon. It is also notable for its 15th-century Fakhredine Mosque, Fakhreddine II Palace, and other historical palaces and administrative buildings. The 17th century Deir el Qamar Synagogue {{is also in the}} village, although closed to the public. During its peak, the city was the center of Lebanese literary tradition. It was the first village in Lebanon to have a municipality in 1864, and it is the birthplace of many well-known personalities, such as artists, writers, and politicians. It was the capital of the Druze Cancimat of Lebanon (1840-1860). One of the most important historical and religious sites in Deir El Qamar is Our Lady of the Hill known as Saydet El Talle. This Maronite church goes back to the 15th century. The legend says that there was a Druze Emir in Baakline looking at the hill of Deir El Kamar. He saw a light coming out of the hill. He gathered his soldiers and ordered them to go in the morning and dig in the land. He said to them: 'If you find an Islamic symbol, build a mosque. If you find a Christian symbol, build a church." [...] The soldiers went in the morning, dug in the land and found a rock with a cross on it. Under the cross, there was the moon and Venus. That was <b>the</b> <b>sign</b> <b>that</b> long time ago, there was a temple dedicated to the moon and Venus and later it became a church. Earthquakes and wars might be the reason for its disappearance." [...] The rock discovered by the soldiers can be found above the old gate of the church. A Byzantine column can be found inside the church.|$|E
