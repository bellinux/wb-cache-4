5|$|The Japanese embassy {{met with}} King Philip III in Madrid on 30 January 1615. Hasekura remitted to the King {{a letter from}} Date Masamune, as well as offer for a treaty. The King responded <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>do</b> what he could to {{accommodate}} these requests.|$|E
5|$|Republican {{legislative}} {{leaders said}} that they would not whip their members to vote for Shumlin, leaving them free to vote their consciences. Though Republican Lieutenant Governor Phillip Scott did not have a vote, he said that he would vote for Shumlin, and Republican State Representative Kurt Wright said <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>do</b> so. Initially, no Democrats indicated that they would vote for Milne. Indeed, several Democrats whose districts voted for Milne over Shumlin {{said that they}} would vote for Shumlin, citing his plurality win.|$|E
5|$|The team {{entered the}} season {{surrounded}} by questions {{of how they}} would overcome the late season collapse from last year and {{what it would take}} for Rich Rodriguez to return for a fourth year. On January 5, Michigan hired Dave Brandon to replace Bill Martin as its athletic director. Martin had previously announced his retirement during the 2009 season. Reaction to the hire was positive, but the hire also brought increased scrutiny upon Rich Rodriguez, as Brandon made it clear <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>do</b> whatever was necessary to turn the program around from its recent slump.|$|E
50|$|Two-term Governor Mark Dayton is {{eligible}} to seek re-election, but has stated <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> not <b>do</b> so.|$|R

60|$|The captain protested <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> not <b>do</b> <b>that,</b> {{but finally}} gave in, and {{afterwards}} acted {{the part of}} chaplain in the family.|$|R
5|$|With Burgers due {{to stand}} for {{re-election}} the following year, Kruger became a popular alternative candidate, but he resolved to stand by the President after Burgers privately assured him <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>do</b> his utmost to defend the South African Republic's independence. The towns of the Transvaal were becoming increasingly British in character as immigration and trade gathered apace, {{and the idea of}} annexation was gaining support both locally and in the British government. In late 1876 Lord Carnarvon, Colonial Secretary under Benjamin Disraeli, gave Sir Theophilus Shepstone of Natal a special commission to confer with the South African Republic's government and, if he saw fit, annex the country.|$|E
5|$|Despite his success, Cagney {{remained}} {{dissatisfied with}} his contract. He wanted {{more money for}} his successful films, but he also offered to take a smaller salary should his star wane. Warner Bros. refused, so Cagney once again walked out. He held out for $4000 a week, the same salary as Edward G. Robinson, Douglas Fairbanks, Jr., and Kay Francis. Warner Bros. refused to cave in this time, and suspended Cagney. Cagney announced <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>do</b> his next three pictures for free if they canceled the five years remaining on his contract. He also threatened to quit Hollywood {{and go back to}} Columbia University to follow his brothers into medicine. After six months of suspension, Frank Capra brokered a deal that increased Cagney's salary to around $3000 a week, and guaranteed top billing and no more than four films a year.|$|E
5|$|In autumn 1229, Alice {{arrived in}} Acre, whereupon she laid {{claim to the}} Kingdom of Jerusalem against the infant Conrad, son of her niece, Isabella II, and Frederick. She {{appeared}} before the High Court of Jerusalem declaring that Conrad had forfeited his right to the kingdom as {{he had failed to}} personally take possession of it within a year and a day of the death of his mother, as required by a local law regarding fiefs inherited by a non resident heir. The members of the High Court, who had recently pledged fealty to Conrad's father, rejected Alice's claim, emphasizing that Conrad was a minor. However, they sent their envoys to Frederick in Foggia, Italy, requesting that he send Conrad to the Holy Land within a year and a day. Frederick informed the envoys <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>do</b> what he thought best in May 1230.|$|E
60|$|So the {{man said}} <b>that</b> if <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>do</b> <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> go, but <b>he</b> begged the Governor {{to be very careful}} to put his finger into the tap-hole the moment he took his out.|$|R
50|$|Fortenberry {{considered}} {{running for}} the United States Senate seat being vacated by Republican Mike Johanns, but ultimately announced <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> not <b>do</b> so and <b>would</b> instead seek re-election.|$|R
5000|$|Before {{the tour}} began, Palmer and Cohen agreed <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> film {{only one out}} of every five concerts, on the grounds <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> be <b>doing</b> the same songs in every one.|$|R
5|$|Surprised by Aberhart's {{refusal to}} be drawn into open conflict, the insurgents needed time to {{reassess}} their strategy. They got that time when, on March17, Lieutenant-Governor Primrose died, necessitating a five-day adjournment while the federal government selected a replacement. When the legislature reconvened March 22 or 23, the dissidents filibustered against the budget. Albert Bourcier opened debate, and was followed by, among others, Edith Rogers, Ansley, and Wilson Cain. On March24, Harry Knowlton Brown moved an adjournment, which was carried over the government's objections by a vote of 27 to 25. Though the insurgents considered this a vote of non-confidence in Aberhart's government, he refused to resign; he acknowledged, however, <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>do</b> so if the budget itself was defeated.|$|E
5|$|Three {{days after}} taking office, Alfonsín sent {{a bill to}} the Congress to revoke the self-amnesty law {{established}} by the military. This {{made it possible for}} the judiciary to investigate the crimes committed during the Dirty War. During the campaign, Alfonsín had promised <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>do</b> this while Luder had been non-committal. Alfonsín also ordered the initiation of judicial cases against guerrilla leaders Mario Firmenich, Fernando Vaca Narvaja, Ricardo Obregón Cano, Rodolfo Galimberti, Roberto Perdía, Héctor Pardo and Enrique Gorriarán Merlo; and military leaders Jorge Videla, Emilio Massera, Orlando Agosti, Roberto Viola, Armando Lambruschini, Omar Graffigna, Leopoldo Galtieri, Jorge Anaya and Basilio Dami Dozo. He also requested the extradition of guerrilla leaders who were living abroad.|$|E
5|$|Boas Munyonga {{represented}} Zambia in men's judo. He qualified {{by being}} awarded an additional {{place in the}} additional places category for the African continent by the International Judo Federation. He participated in the men's middleweight class, which includes athletes under 90 kilograms in weight. Munyonga was Zambia's oldest athlete at the London Olympic Games, at age 31, and was taking part in his first Olympic Games. He said <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>do</b> his best in the event. Munyonga faced Takahiro Nakai of Japan on 31 July in the round of 32. When the ball rang to signal {{the start of the}} match, Munyonga held Nakai by the leg and placed him onto the corners of the mat. The primary umpire signalled the boxers to face each other and disqualified Munyonga and declared Nakai the match's winner. Munyonga stated that he regretted the move and that he had forgotten about a rule which stated the leg was not allowed to be held by another competitor.|$|E

5|$|Returning to New York, he and Thomashefsky jointly leased The People's Theater, {{intending}} {{to use it}} on different nights of the week. Adler, exhausted from his Russian trip, was often leaving his nights unused, and Thomashefsky offered to buy him out for $10,000 {{on the condition that}} he would not return to performing in New York. Adler was so insulted that the two did not speak for months, even though at the time they were living across a courtyard from one another, and could see into each other's St. Mark's Place apartments. Adler decided to perform Tolstoy's The Power of Darkness, and decided <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>do</b> his own translation from Russian to Yiddish. The play was a great success, the first successful production of a Tolstoy play in the U.S., and Thomashefsky was so obviously happy for Adler that their friendship was renewed. Adler followed with equally successful productions of Gordin's dramatization of Tolstoy's Resurrection and the Gordin original The Homeless.|$|E
25|$|Late in 1935, Pressburger decided <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>do</b> {{better in}} England. (Remember that film scripts are written {{some time before}} the film is made and {{released}}, so some films that he worked on were released in France some time after he left).|$|E
25|$|On February 22, 1943, a Norwegian flight {{instructor}} {{was killed when}} his Curtiss plane did not pull out of a dive and crashed at the airport. Witnesses {{did not see the}} plane make any moves {{to pull out of the}} dive. 2nd Lieutenant Conrad Mohr radioed the base <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>do</b> a power dive. It was his last planned flight before leaving for England to rejoin his family, which had recently escaped Norway.|$|E

25|$|The {{news of the}} {{assassination}} of Elisha F. Riggs spread throughout the United States. At that time Puerto Rican Senator, Luis Muñoz Marín, was in Washington, D.C. and Ernest Gruening, the administrator of the Puerto Rico Reconstruction Administration (1935–1937), asked him to condemn Riggs' assassination. Muñoz Marín told Gruening <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>do</b> so only if he was also allowed to condemn the police for murdering the Nationalists in the city police station without a trial.|$|E
25|$|Williamson {{sent the}} Pope a letter expressing his regret about the {{problems}} that he had caused, but did not retract his statements. On 4 February 2009 the Vatican Secretariat of State issued a note stating that Williamson would have to distance himself unequivocally and publicly from the opinions that he had expressed before he would be permitted {{to act as a}} bishop within the Church. Williamson responded <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>do</b> so only after looking at the historical evidence for himself.|$|E
25|$|On 25 September Philip II's {{ambassador}} Vargas {{arrived in}} Rome and under his auspices Sforza, Farnese and Carafa met on 2 October. The ambassador suggested Puteo {{as a candidate}} instead of Carpi and Pacheco. Farnese and Carafa refused, however, and the meeting was unsuccessful. Around this time Sforza began to fight on two fronts – promising the French faction to keep agitating in favour of Gonzaga and the Italian party <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>do</b> so in favour of Pacheco and Carpi.|$|E

25|$|Searle then supposes {{that he is}} in {{a closed}} room and has a book with an English version of the {{computer}} program, along with sufficient paper, pencils, erasers, and filing cabinets. Searle could receive Chinese characters through a slot in the door, process them according to the program's instructions, and produce Chinese characters as output. If the computer had passed the Turing test this way, it follows, says Searle, <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>do</b> so as well, simply by running the program manually.|$|E
25|$|Despite her situation, Marie {{wrote letters}} to her school friends pretending {{that she was having}} a happy {{domestic}} life. She also tried to help her husband by writing letters of recommendation for Charles to Paris, where he hoped to raise money. Before he left on a business trip, in December 1839, she made a will bequeathing to her husband her entire inheritance, with the proviso <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>do</b> the same for her. This he did, but without her knowledge, he made another will soon after, leaving the Le Glandier property to his mother instead.|$|E
25|$|In September 1963, Mitchell {{unexpectedly}} took early retirement, due {{to health}} reasons, at age 58, after 24 years service. He had announced <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>would</b> <b>do</b> so {{before he came}} under suspicion. But he was later interrogated, in 1968, and seemingly was able to answer the charges successfully. The main suspicion then fell on Hollis and, although the matter has never been completely resolved, Christopher Andrew in his Authorised History of MI5 comes to a firm conclusion that neither were traitors. Pincher, conversely, believes that Hollis was the most likely culprit, if there was one.|$|E
