5|$|There {{were also}} recriminations among the British squadron, Schomberg praising Astraea and Phoebe but omitting Racehorse and Galatea from the {{recommendations}} in his post-battle report. Captain Losack was particularly offended as Schomberg had implied that Galateas distress signal was an overreaction {{in the face}} of the enemy, despite her casualties being greater than the rest of the squadron combined. He subsequently requested a court martial to clear any suggestion of cowardice from his name but the Admiralty refused, commenting that they were fully satisfied with his conduct. Historian William James claims <b>that</b> <b>opinion</b> within the Navy was also with Losack and that Schomberg had been excessively harsh in his criticism.|$|E
5|$|Where Americans had a {{historic}} {{disdain for the}} refineries of French cooking, <b>that</b> <b>opinion,</b> {{at least in a}} small part, began to change with the American alliance with the French. In the first American publication of Hannah Glasse's Art of Cookery Made Easy, insults aimed at French dishes disappeared. A number of Bostonians even attempted to cook French cuisine for their French allies, sometimes with comedic results when entire frogs were put into soups rather than just their legs. Nonetheless, the alliance supported a friendship with France that later resulted in a large migration of French cooks and chefs to America during the French Revolution.|$|E

It soon became clear <b>that</b> <b>opinion</b> was split: most of the younger izinDuna were opposed {{to the idea of}} any concession whatsoever, while the king himself and many of his older izinDuna were open to considering Rudd's bid. The idea of a mining monopoly in the hands of Rudd's powerful backers was attractive to the Matabele in some ways, as it would end the incessant propositioning for concessions by small-time prospectors, {{but there was also a}} case for allowing competition to continue, so that the rival miners would have to compete for Lobengula's favour.|$|E

5|$|When the {{legislature}} convened on February 19, {{two sets of}} officers attempted to preside. Marshall and Goebel's lieutenant governor, J. C. W. Beckham, both claimed the right to preside over the state senate. Taylor sued to prevent Beckham from exercising any authority in the senate; Beckham counter-sued for possession of the capitol and executive building. The cases were consolidated, and both Republicans and Democrats agreed to let the courts decide the election. On March 10, a circuit court found in favor of Beckham and the Democrats. By a 6–1 vote, the Kentucky Court of Appeals, the state's court of last resort at the time, upheld the circuit court's decision on April 6, legally unseating Taylor and Marshall. The case of Taylor v. Beckham was eventually appealed to the Supreme Court of the United States, but the court refused {{to intervene in the}} case because it found that there were no federal questions involved. The lone justice dissenting from <b>that</b> <b>opinion</b> was Kentuckian John Marshall Harlan.|$|E
5|$|The {{cases of}} Taylor and Marshall were {{appealed to the}} Kentucky Court of Appeals, then to the Supreme Court of the United States. In the case of Taylor v. Beckham, Bradley countered Democrats' claims that the federal courts should not have {{jurisdiction}} by citing Thayer v. Boyd, a similar {{case in which the}} court had assumed jurisdiction. He further quoted authorities who opined that an elected office was property, using this to contend that Taylor's rights under the Fourteenth Amendment had been violated, thus giving the court jurisdiction. Also, Bradley asserted, the election of some members of the General Assembly's contest committee would hinge on the decision of that very committee. At least one member of the committee was known to have wagered on the election's outcome. These facts should have nullified the decision of the committee and the Assembly {{on the grounds that it}} had left some members as judges of their own cases, Bradley argued. Finally, Bradley cited irregularities in the proceedings of the contest committee, including giving insufficient time for the review of testimony provided in written form by Taylor and Marshall's legal representation. The court refused to intervene in the case, however, because it found that there were no federal questions involved. The lone justice dissenting from <b>that</b> <b>opinion</b> was Kentuckian John Marshall Harlan.|$|E

30|$|More formally, given {{a product}} catalog C, our {{ultimate}} goal is to generate an Enriched Catalog C+ as follows. For each product p_i = 〈 t, A〉 in C, there is an enriched representation p^+_i = 〈 t, A, S〉, where S = A∪{General,Other}. Each element in S is called an aspect class. For each aspect class S ∈S, we have a set of opinions O_p_i,S as follows. When S = A ∈A, O_p_i,S is the set of opinions referring to attribute A in pj, <b>that</b> is, <b>opinions</b> <b>that</b> fall in to case 1 above. When S=General, O_p_i,S is a set of <b>opinions</b> <b>that</b> refer to the product as a whole, <b>that</b> is, <b>opinions</b> <b>that</b> fall in case 2 above.

25|$|A {{good example}} of the use of {{probability}} theory in equity trading is the effect of the perceived probability of any widespread Middle East conflict on oil prices, which have ripple effects in the economy as a whole. An assessment by a commodity trader that a war is more likely can send that commodity's prices up or down, and signals other traders of <b>that</b> <b>opinion.</b> Accordingly, the probabilities are neither assessed independently nor necessarily very rationally. The theory of behavioral finance emerged to describe the effect of such groupthink on pricing, on policy, and on peace and conflict.|$|E

Today, demolition has ceased to be a realistic, or legal, option for listed buildings, and an historic house (particularly one with its contents intact) has become recognized as worthy of retention and preservation. However, many country houses are still at risk and their security, even as an entirety with their contents, is not guaranteed by any legislation.|$|E

25|$|As {{tensions}} between the United Kingdom and the United States, as well as fears of further rebellion in British North America, grew in the late 18th century, the British reinforced the defences of their colonies according to a plan drawn up in the 1790s by Gother Mann. The ramparts around the Upper Town cliff and four martello towers (still extant) on the Plains of Abraham were completed before 1812.

Intended to secure Quebec City against the Americans and serve as a refuge for the British garrison in the event of attack or rebellion, the Citadelle incorporated a section of the French enceinte of 1745 and the layout was based on Sébastien Le Prestre de Vauban's design for an arms, munitions, and supplies depot, as well as a barracks. That, though, was somewhat of an anachronism {{by the time of the}} fort's completion, in comparison to other contemporary European military architecture.
