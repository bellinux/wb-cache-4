LISP flies patrol missions across Long Island Sound {{during the summer}} months in coordination with the United States Coast Guard <b>to</b> <b>provide</b> <b>more</b> immediate assistance to vessels in distress. The Wing was credited with numerous finds and saves in the year following its inception in summer 2007, and plans are in effect to continue the program.|$|E
5|$|Bud becomes wealthy, enjoying Gekko's promised perks, {{including}} a penthouse on Manhattan's Upper East Side and a trophy girlfriend, interior decorator Darien (Daryl Hannah). Bud is promoted {{to a senior}} stockbroker {{as a result of}} the large commission fees he is bringing in from Gekko's trading, and is given a corner office with a view. He continues to maximize inside information and use friends as straw buyers <b>to</b> <b>provide</b> <b>more</b> income for him and Gekko.

5|$|Decompression {{theory is}} not an exact science. Decompression models {{approximate}} a physiological process that is incompletely understood, and rather complex, by simple mathematical models, {{in the hope of}} producing a useful procedure with acceptably low risk of injury to the user. New information allows theories and models to be modified <b>to</b> <b>provide</b> <b>more</b> reliable results, and the availability of faster and more powerful computer processors at low cost has made more exhaustive numerical methods more practicable, and the computation of relatively far more complex models is now quite possible, even in real time.|$|E
5|$|During the Second World War the {{basement}} was converted into an air-raid shelter and an extension {{built in the}} yard <b>to</b> <b>provide</b> <b>more</b> space in the control room. The fire services were nationalised in 1941, and London Road became the headquarters of Division C. In recognition of the fire fighters' efforts King George VI and Queen Elizabeth visited the fire station in 1942.|$|E
5|$|Garden City {{has seen}} several {{improvements}} in its football facilities in recent years. FieldTurf {{was installed in}} the summer of 2004 to better accommodate the multiple uses of the field. Additionally, the visitor stands were greatly expanded {{in the summer of}} 2008 to accommodate visiting fans. A second pressbox was also installed <b>to</b> <b>provide</b> <b>more</b> accessibility for coaches and coordinators during games. The new Buffalo Stadium was part of the $92 million bond issue for the current high school.|$|E

5|$|In 1997, the Desert Inn {{underwent}} a $200 million renovation and expansion by Steelman Partners, {{giving it a}} new Mediterranean-looking exterior with white stucco and red clay tile roofs. The room count was reduced to 715 <b>to</b> <b>provide</b> <b>more</b> luxurious accommodations. The nine-story Palm Tower was completed, the lagoon-style pool was added, and notable changes {{were made to the}} Grand Lobby Atrium, Starlight Lounge, Villas Del Lago, and new golf shop and country club.

5|$|In February, Rivers {{submitted}} a bill <b>to</b> <b>provide</b> <b>more</b> funding for food {{banks and other}} charitable causes. The bill authorized public utilities to solicit and collect donations from customers to be put towards food programs for the poor. It also made the donations received by utilities separate from gross income, allowing {{for it to be}} tax-free. The bill passed in the State House in Feb. 2011 but failed {{to make it to the}} Senate floor.|$|E
5|$|London Underground {{has owned}} {{a small number}} of {{departmental}} vehicles which were not ballast motor or pilot motor cars. Between 1935 and 1950, the District line had a weed-killing train, initially consisting of a 1905-built B stock driving motor car and a control trailer. The two cars were kept at Ealing Common depot, but the control trailer was scrapped in 1937 and replaced by a second motor car, <b>to</b> <b>provide</b> <b>more</b> power. Weed-killing duties were not carried out during the Second World War, and the vehicles were not refurbished subsequently. They were scrapped in 1950.|$|E
30|$|It is {{observed}} that the semantic filter was effective for all sample databases. The reduction rates were reasonable, reaching more than 23 % for the STULONG database. The proposed semantic method decreases the number of rules in addition <b>to</b> <b>providing</b> <b>more</b> consistency <b>to</b> the results in each case.|$|R
30|$|In {{addition}} <b>to</b> <b>providing</b> <b>more</b> flexibility, one of {{the benefits}} of partial reconfiguration is the cost reduction. This is achieved by implementing multiple functions within the same region of the FPGA and modifying their functionality on demand.

5|$|Performing a chest {{radiograph}} {{is one of}} {{the first}} investigative steps if a person reports symptoms that may suggest lung cancer. This may reveal an obvious mass, widening of the mediastinum (suggestive of spread to lymph nodes there), atelectasis (collapse), consolidation (pneumonia) or pleural effusion. CT imaging is typically used <b>to</b> <b>provide</b> <b>more</b> information about the type and extent of disease. Bronchoscopy or CT-guided biopsy is often used to sample the tumor for histopathology.|$|E
5|$|The Marlins and Rockies {{used the}} {{expansion}} draft {{to build their}} teams using different strategies. As the Rockies had a smaller operating budget than the Marlins, the Rockies targeted prospects with low salaries, while the Marlins selected older players intended <b>to</b> <b>provide</b> <b>more</b> immediate impact.

5|$|The {{building}} was substantially altered in 1835 by architect Sydney Smirke. In order <b>to</b> <b>provide</b> <b>more</b> space, he added blocks {{at either end}} of the frontage, and galleried wings on either side of the central portion. He also added a small single-storey lodge, still in existence, at the Lambeth Road gate. Later, between 1844–46, the central cupola was replaced with a copper-clad dome in order to expand the chapel beneath. The building also featured a theatre in a building to the rear of the site.|$|E
5|$|The first notable {{musician}} {{to use the}} Mellotron was variety pianist Geoff Unwin, who {{was specifically}} hired by Robinson in 1962 to promote {{the use of the}} instrument. He toured with a Mk II Mellotron and made numerous appearances on television and radio. Unwin claimed that the automatic backing tracks on the Mk II's left hand keyboard allowed him <b>to</b> <b>provide</b> <b>more</b> accomplished performances than his own basic skills on the piano could provide.|$|E
5|$|The {{government}} {{department responsible for}} the NHS is the Department of Health, headed by the Secretary of State for Health, who sits in the British Cabinet. Most of the expenditure of the Department of Health is spent on the NHS—£98.6billion was spent in 2008–2009. In recent years the private sector has been increasingly used <b>to</b> <b>provide</b> <b>more</b> NHS services despite opposition by doctors and trade unions. The average life expectancy of people in England is 77.5 years for males and 81.7 years for females, the highest of the four countries of the United Kingdom.|$|E

Pinkerton's two locks were rebuilt, and {{the banks of the}} Kymer canal were raised by , to allow the water level to be raised. This had also required the Kidwelly basin walls to be raised. At the southern end, access to Burry Port harbour required a deep cutting to be constructed, and this was completed by March 1835.|$|E
5|$|To {{address these}} issues, the 1981 Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act (OBRA) {{eliminated}} Puerto Rico {{from the national}} Food Stamp program and created the Nutrition Assistance Program for Puerto Rico as a block grant <b>to</b> <b>provide</b> <b>more</b> administrative flexibility to the Commonwealth while reducing Federal expenditures.
