40|$|Recent {{research}} has explored the growing ‘financialization’ {{process in the}} U. S. and other advanced economies. The term is a catch-all phrase used to denote important changes {{in the structure of}} non-financial corporations’ balance sheets, including the growth of income from financial subsidiaries and investment as well as growth in the <b>transfer</b> <b>of</b> <b>earnings</b> to financial markets in the forms of interest payments, dividend payments and stock buybacks. This paper seeks to empirically explore the relationship between financialization in the U. S economy and real investment at the firm level. Using data from a sample of non-financial corporations from 1973 to 2003, I find a negative relationship between real investment and financialization. First, increased financial investment and increased financial profit opportunities may have crowded out real investment by changing the incentives of firm managers and directing funds away from real investment. Second, increased payments to the financial markets may have impeded real investment by decreasing available internal funds, shortening the planning horizons of the firm management, and increasing uncertainty. These two channels can help explain the negative relationship I find between investment and financialization. ...|$|E

40|$|A tax {{heaven is}} usually a {{territory}} with lower tax duties in comparison to other countries. For that reason countries maintain different sorts of law restrictions in tax heavens. We can also make various classifications of them. Companies use several basic methods in tax heavens to reduce tax obligations. The most popular are: tax prices, incidental inflation of costs, a temporary <b>transfer</b> <b>of</b> the <b>earnings,</b> treaty shopping and raising a rotary company. The opening of the Polish economy facilitated the entrance to tax heaven. Internet and magazines present many ways how to raise an offshore company. Because of great interest in tax heavens the Polish government produced different law regulations for currency law and tax law. Apart from that there are special programs to fight against liberal tax systems in the OECD and EU.

50|$|It was {{not until}} 1934 when Landshut-born Heinz Wittmann {{organised}} an ice hockey equipment from Garmisch-Partenkirchen. The first games were played {{under the name of}} “Team Brauerei Wittmann” (named after Wittmann Brewery) against squads from Wartenberg, Bavaria and Donaustauf. On February 1, 1934 the team was incorporated into the Ski-Club Landshut (SCL). The same season they got champions of the Danube region. The 1935-36 season marked the first appearance in the Kreisliga (then second division), where the squad played the following three years. In 1937 the ice hockey section was transferred from the SCL to another club, the Turngemeinde Landshut (TGL). After the 1938-39 season a regular schedule of the league was not possible any more because of the outbreak of World War II. During the war there only took place a few friendly games, for example against Straubing on January 10, 1943. From the first post-war season 1945-46 to 1947-48 the team started in the newly formed Landesliga - again as section of the TGL.

While operating losses in leisure business contains large noise, positive earnings is value relevant. Earnings in other segments are irrelevant. These results do not deny the prevailed thought that the diversification does not necessarily contribute {{to the growth of}} firm value. Operating revenues and expenses, investments, depreciation amount, and asset balances in each segment, which are mandated to disclose in Japan, are value relevant. In this sense, current disclosure regulation has a rational basis. Although the regulation on train fares was revised in the tide of deregulation, we cannot find the change in the relation between segment earnings and stock prices. The change of regulatory circumstances does not significantly influence the allocation <b>of</b> <b>earnings</b> over periods. On the other hand, accounting cross subsidization, i. e. the <b>transfer</b> <b>of</b> expenses from non-transportation segment to transportation segment, was reduced in second half period under investigation, as compared with the first half period. The change of regulatory circumstances affects the allocation <b>of</b> <b>earnings</b> among segments. However, the accounting subsidization (that is, the <b>transfer</b> <b>of</b> expenses) does not decrease the relevance of operating profits in segments. Discretionary allocation does not impair the information value <b>of</b> <b>earnings.</b> The <b>transfer</b> <b>of</b> expenses form non-transportation segment to transportation segment can increase the operating revenues in transportation segment, which is more certain than operating revenues in non-transportation segment, through cost principle in rate regulation and the transferred earnings is positively associated with firm value. ...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{examines}} the impact <b>of</b> <b>earnings</b> management on the value-relevance <b>of</b> <b>earnings</b> and book value. Two different sources <b>of</b> <b>earnings</b> management are investigated: short-term discretionary accruals and long-term discretionary accruals. A contribution {{of this paper}} is the development of models to estimate short-term and long-term discretionary accruals. The effect <b>of</b> <b>earnings</b> management on the relative value-relevance <b>of</b> <b>earnings</b> and book value depends on the source <b>of</b> <b>earnings</b> management. When examined independently, earnings management via either short-term or long-term discretionary accruals reduces the valuerelevance <b>of</b> <b>earnings</b> but has no impact on the value relevance of book value. Examination of both measures simultaneously reveals the differential impact of short-term versus long-term discretionary accruals. Earnings management via short-term discretionary accruals has no impact, whereas earnings management via long-term discretionary accruals reduces the valuerelevance <b>of</b> <b>earnings</b> and increases the value-relevance of book value. This supports the conclusion that earnings management via long-term discretionary accruals has a greater impact on the value-relevance <b>of</b> <b>earnings</b> and book value than earnings management via short-term discretionary accruals. ...|$|R

40|$|Purpose - Prior studies provide mixed propositions {{on whether}} {{earnings}} levels or earnings changes provide the better explanatory power for variations of stock returns {{and whether the}} time-series behavior <b>of</b> <b>earnings</b> affects the value relevance <b>of</b> both <b>earnings</b> variables. This paper aims to compare the value relevance <b>of</b> <b>earnings</b> levels with that <b>of</b> <b>earnings</b> changes in the return-earnings relations. Design/methodology/approach - The unobservable components model is used to estimate permanent and transitory components <b>of</b> <b>earnings.</b> Findings - The finding shows that the proxy ability <b>of</b> <b>earnings</b> changes for unexpected earnings is sensitive to a firm's time-series earnings permanence property and is unstable and noisy when earnings contain predominantly transitory components, but that <b>of</b> <b>earnings</b> levels is not. The results support earnings levels are a stable and better value relevant proxy in the return-earnings relations. Research limitations/implications - The findings imply that the valuation role <b>of</b> <b>earnings</b> levels {{is important in the}} research relating to earnings components, earnings innovations, and equity valuation, especially when <b>earnings</b> permanence is <b>of</b> interest. Practical implications - The results provide a new understanding on the role <b>of</b> <b>earnings</b> levels in many business decisions such as executive compensations, institutional investment and conservative accounting where they often involve the choice of using levels and/or changes <b>of</b> <b>earnings</b> variables in making decisions. Originality/value - The paper contributes to the accounting literature by providing a new insight into the valuation role <b>of</b> <b>earnings</b> levels in the return-earnings relations. The stable value relevance <b>of</b> <b>earnings</b> levels also has important implications, especially for studies that use only earnings levels to assess earnings quality and <b>earnings</b> attributes.

The analysis to the issue is crucial to be investigated due to earnings is considered as a principal information that becomes an attention for the users of accounting information in taking the investment decision, credit decision, etc. The differences from previous researches are: First, on the previous researches consider the information contents of earning, timeliness <b>of</b> <b>earnings</b> announcement, and the earnings quality, whereas on the other researches the three variables were not analysed together. Second, the previous researches haven’t put retained earnings and net cash flow as control variables, because {{they are supposed to}} have effect to the causal relation. This research apply both the Ohlson (1995) valuation theory and efficient capital market theory (Beaver, 1998) as a valuation basis to investigating {{the effect of}} earnings’ information contents, timeliness <b>of</b> <b>earnings</b> announcement, and the earnings quality, also retained earning, and net cash flow as a control variables to the relevance <b>of</b> <b>earnings</b> value for the stock market. This research hypothesizes that: First, earnings has value relevancy for the stock market. Second, earnings’ information contents, timeliness <b>of</b> <b>earnings</b> announcement, and the earnings quality have positive effect to increase the relevancy <b>of</b> <b>earnings</b> value for the stock market.

Fourth, earnings’ information contents, timeliness <b>of</b> <b>earnings</b> announcement, and the earnings quality, also retained earning, and net cash flow as a control variables have positive effect to increase the relevancy <b>of</b> <b>earnings</b> value for the stock market. By using sample from listed manufacture firms at the Jakarta Stock Exchange (JSX) over 2003 - 2006, the results indicate that earnings has value relevancy for the stock market generally. As especially, the results indicate that: First, significantly earnings has positive effect to the stock return (accept Ha 1). Second, earnings’ information contents, timeliness <b>of</b> <b>earnings</b> announcement, and the earnings quality increase the relevancy <b>of</b> <b>earnings</b> value for the stock market. Earnings’ information contents proxied by direction <b>of</b> <b>earnings</b> growth and timeliness <b>of</b> <b>earnings</b> announcement proxied by reporting velocity <b>of</b> <b>earnings</b> have positive effect to the stock return while earnings quality proxied by earnings management has negative effect to stock return (reject Ha 2).

In JP, we cannot find the evident relationship between the dispersion and the relevance <b>of</b> <b>earnings.</b> On the other hand, analyst coverage does not affect the relevance <b>of</b> <b>earnings</b> in US while the earnings is more value relevant for firms covered by analysts than firms uncovered in JP. Moreover, the effect of optimistic forecast errors on the value relevance <b>of</b> <b>earnings</b> differs between JP and US.

When firm is financially strong, earnings changes should be of limited relevance to bondholders, but should be relevance to bondholders. In contrast, as the likelihood of financial distress increase, stockholder’s limited liability allows them to abandon the firm to bondholder and earnings change should be increasingly important to bondholders and less important to shareholders because earnings provide information on firm value. This suggest that the effect <b>of</b> <b>earnings</b> to stock return should decrease as the firm’s financial strength declines, while the effect <b>of</b> <b>earnings</b> to bond return should increase.
