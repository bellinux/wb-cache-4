Post-operative survival periods ranged from 20 hours to 14 days. At all stages, only boutons containing clear, round vesicles (R-boutons) and those containing dense-cored vesicles (DCV-boutons) underwent degeneration. Boutons containing flattened vesicles (F-boutons) appeared to be unaffected. Changes were seen even at 20 hours after injection and these were confined to R-boutons only. The changes included an initial swelling and crowding of the vesicles, followed {{by an increase in}} the electron density of the axoplasm. The latter change was most marked on the second post-operative day and by the third day, most of the electron-dense profiles were glia-engulfed. By the third day, also, many unmyelinated and, occasionally, myelinated axons showed accumulations of mitochondria, membrane-bound <b>tubular</b> <b>profiles</b> and electron-dense bodies.

40|$|Tonicity-responsive {{enhancer}} binding protein (TonEBP) is a transcriptional activator of the Rel family. In the renal medulla, TonEBP stimulates genes encoding proteins {{involved in}} cellular accumulation of organic osmolytes, the vasopressin-regulated urea transporters (UT-A), and {{heat shock protein}} 70. To understand the role of TonEBP {{in the development of}} urinary concentrating ability, TonEBP expression during rat kidney development was investigated. In embryonic kidneys, TonEBP immunoreactivity was detected 16 days postcoitus in the cytoplasm of the endothelial cells surrounding the medullary collecting ducts (MCD). By 20 days, TonEBP was detected in most <b>tubular</b> <b>profiles</b> in the medulla, including the loop of Henle and MCD, and interstitial cells. The intensity of TonEBP immunoreactivity was much higher in the vasa recta than the tubules. In addition, immunoreactivity was localized predominantly to the cytoplasm. On postnatal day 1, two major changes were observed. TonEBP immunoreactivity shifted to the nucleus, and the intensity of TonEBP immunoreactivity of the tubules increased dramatically. These changes were associated with an increase in TonEBP and sodium-myo-inositol cotransporter mRNA abundance. Thereafter, TonEBP expression in <b>tubular</b> <b>profiles</b> increased moderately. The adult pattern of TonEBP expression was established at postnatal day 21 coincident with full maturation of the renal medulla. Thus expression of TonEBP in developing kidneys occurred predominantly in the medulla and preceded expression of its target genes, including UT-A.

The results showed a better performance on energy absorption for the circular discontinuities located in middle height. With respect to a profile without holes, a maximum increase of 7 % in energy absorption capacity was obtained experimentally. Also, the numerical simulation confirmed that the implementation of circular discontinuities can reduce the peak load (Pmax) by 10 %.

Virus infection was accompanied by a marked expansion in endoplasmic reticulum (ER) staining and markers for TBFV replication were localized mainly to the ER in both cell lines. TEM of Vero cells showed membrane-bound vesicles enclosed in a network of dilated, anastomosing ER cisternae. Virions were seen within the ER and were sometimes in paracrystalline arrays.

Ultrastructurally, blastemalike cells were undifferentiated forms resembling metanephric blastema. <b>Tubular</b> <b>profiles</b> of varying development were typified by very prominent apical junctional complexes and a basal lamina, but no organized brush-border. "Reniform" islands were groups of more maturely formed tubules associated with the production of an interstitial matrix consisting almost solely of multilamellar basement membrane. Glomeruloid bodies were invaginations of small podocytelike cells, with a profusion of thin cytoplasmic processes resembling foot processes, and internal, homogeneous areas of basement membrane continuous with that surrounding the entire structure. As such, these structures were consistent with primitive attempts at glomerular differentiation but without vascular or mesangial elements. The squamoid foci were representative of true squamous differentiation in comprising cells filled with intermediate filaments and interconnected by lateral interdigitations and multiple, well-formed desmosomes. Spindle-shaped tumor cells disposed in fascicles, {{which could have been}} interpreted as bipotential differentiation into secondary mesenchyme at the histologic level, differed from the blastemal cell type only in shape. Ultrastructurally, the fascicles, in most cases, consisted of thin, basement-membrane-invested ribbons of attenuated cells enclosing small lumens sealed by intercellular junctions, suggestive of abortive tubule formation. Tumor cells disposed in fascicles therefore conformed to the same epithelial lineage as the other neoplastic components of these tumors.

40|$|Wnt {{proteins}} play {{a central}} role in development. Wnt secretion is mediated by the Wnt-binding protein Wntless (Wls), which transports Wnt from the Golgi to the cell surface for release. Wnt secretion requires recycling of Wls through a retromer-dependent endosome-to-Golgi trafficking pathway, but the mechanism remains poorly understood. Using C. elegans and Drosophila genetics, we established that Wls recycling requires an evolutionarily conserved, ‘non-classical’ retromer pathway, that functions independently of the classical retromer sorting nexins. We found sorting nexin- 3, SNX 3, has an evolutionarily conserved function in Wls recycling and Wnt secretion. SNX 3 interacts directly with the cargo-selective sub-complex of retromer. Live cell imaging reveals WLS exits SNX 3 labelled endosomes through vesicular carriers rather than classic retromer decorated <b>tubular</b> <b>profiles.</b> These results establish SNX 3 as part of an alternative retromer pathway that functionally separates retrograde transport of Wls from other retromer cargo...|$|E

Clinically, diminution of proteinuria {{leads to the}} slowing of progression, but whether this leads to reduction in tubular lesions has not been directly demonstrated in humans. MethodsInitial (Bx 1) and systematic six-month biopsies (Bx 2) from 71 patients with lupus nephritis were studied, with a subset of 34 biopsies also stained for proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA), the macrophage marker PGM 1, and cytokeratins (AE 1 /AE 3), and morphometric cell and <b>tubular</b> <b>profile</b> counts performed. ResultsPositive correlations were found between increasing levels of proteinuria and the following light microscopic parameters: tubular epithelial pyknosis, tubular epithelial nuclear “activation,” tubular lumenal macrophages, interstitial inflammation and fibrosis, but not with tubulointerstitial immunofluorescence. Significant positive correlations also were found with the following immunohistochemical parameters: PCNA in epithelial cells (r = 0. 74) and tubular luminal cells (r = 0. 47); tubular lumenal macrophages (r = 0. 63) and tubular epithelial cells with acquired PGM 1 staining (r = 0. 36); and pyknotic tubular epithelial cells (r = 0. 47). All showed strong correlations with serum creatinine (SCr) as well. All were reduced at Bx 2, generally in parallel to the reduction in proteinuria. Tubulointerstitial immune deposits appear to play only a minor {{role in the development}} of tubular epithelial lesions and the progression of renal disease in lupus. They show only limited correlation with SCr and no correlation with proteinuria. By multiple regression, they are not associated with tubular epithelial lesions, interstitial inflammation or interstitial fibrosis at either biopsy, whereas tubular epithelial lesions are strongly associated with interstitial inflammation at Bx 1 and with interstitial fibrosis at Bx 2. Cytokeratin correlated strongly with SCr (r = 0. 53, P = 0. 002) but not with proteinuria (r = 0. 27, NS), and was the sole immunohistochemical parameter to increase at Bx 2. It appears to be a sensitive marker for tubular atrophy.

Furthermore, the behavior of joints with both mandrel and tube made of AA 6060 at swelling cyclic loads (R = δ_ min / δ_ max = 0) has been evaluated...|$|E
40|$|Electromagnetic {{compression}} of <b>tubular</b> <b>profiles</b> with high electrical conductivity is an innovative joining {{process for the}} manufacturing of lightweight structures. Taking conventional interference fits into account, the contact area s influence on the joint s quality seems to be of significance, as e. g. the contact area and the friction coefficient between the joining partners determine an allowed axial load or torsional momentum proportionally. Therefore, different contact area surfaces were prepared by shot peening and different machining operations and strategies. The mandrel s surfaces were prepared by shot peening with glass beads and Al 2 O 3 particles. Alternatively, preparation was done using simultaneous five axis milling, because potential joining partners in lightweight frame structures within the Transregional Collaborative Research Centre SFB/TR 10 would be manufactured similarly. After that, the manufactured surfaces were characterized by measuring the surface roughness and using confocal whitelight microscopy. After joining by electromagnetic compression, the influence of different mandrel s surface conditions on the joint s mechanical properties were analyzed by tensile tests. Finally, conclusions and design rules for the manufacturing of joints by electromagnetic compression are given...|$|E
40|$|The {{differentiation}} of the fibroblast was {{followed in the}} dental pulp of continuously growing incisors of the guinea pig. Based on the ultrastructure, the processes of {{differentiation of}} the fibroblasts might be conveniently broken into three stages; Stage I – period of early differentiation, Stage II – period of maturation and functioning, and Stage III – period of regression. During Stage I the cell had structural characteristics shared by other less differentiated cells. The endoplasmic reticulum was poorly developed, showing vesicular to <b>tubular</b> <b>profiles.</b> The ribosomes were abundant but were mostly distributed in free form. Mitochondria were small and had irregular interiors. Stage II was characterized by a striking development of the rough-surfaced endoplasmic reticulum, which appeared in various shapes and sizes. The Golgi complex was enlarged, and contained some fibriller materials in dilated portions of its membraneous elements. Other features described in the cytoplasm of fibroblasts from other sources were confirmed. Stage III was characterized by the decrease in size and number of various cytoplasmic constituents and was considered to represent cells {{in the state of}} regression...|$|E
40|$|The {{successful}} {{application of}} the component-based approach – widely used to model structural joints – requires knowledge of the mechanical properties of the constitutive joint components, including an appropriate assembly procedure to derive the joint properties. This paper presents a component-method model for a structural joint component that {{is located in the}} tension zone of blind-bolted connections to concrete-filled <b>tubular</b> steel <b>profiles.</b> The model relates to the response of blind-bolts with headed anchors under monotonic loading, and the blind-bolt is termed the "Extended Hollo-bolt". Experimental data is used to develop the model, with the data being collected in a manner such that constitutive models were characterised for the principal elements which contribute to the global deformability of the connector. The model, based on a system of spring elements, incorporates pre-load and deformation from various parts of the blind-bolt: (i) the internal bolt elongation, (ii) the connector’s expanding sleeves element, and (iii) the connector’s mechanical anchorage element. The characteristics of these elements are determined on the basis of piecewise functions, accounting for basic geometrical and mechanical properties such as the strength of the concrete applied to the tube, the connection clamping length, and the size and class of the blind- bolt’s internal bolt. An assembly process is then detailed to establish the model for the elastic and inelastic behaviour of the component. Comparisons of model predictions with experimental data show that the proposed model can predict with sufficient accuracy the response of the component. The model furthers the development of a full and detailed design method for an original connection technology...|$|R
40|$|Catalytic autothermal {{reforming}} {{of methane}} was studied over a commercial rhodium catalyst {{as a function}} of feed flow rate, feed composition and oven temperature. The process is carried out in a catalytic fixed bed reactor inserted in a <b>tubular</b> oven. Temperature <b>profile</b> of the catalyst bed was measured by IR thermography and product composition was measured with a continuous gas analyzer. The effect of water addition at fixed flow rate on catalyst temperature profile was investigated in two ways. In one case, upon water addition, an equivalent amount of nitrogen was removed from the feed in order to keep oxygen and methane concentrations constant. With this protocol nitrogen to oxygen ratio varies {{as a function of}} amount of water in the feed. In the other case, upon water addition, nitrogen, oxygen and methane were all reduced to keep total flow rate constant, thus keeping both oxygen to methane and nitrogen to oxygen ratios constant. The effect of water addition on product composition was investigated as a function of reactor thermal level, regulated by acting on oven temperature...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT Temperature-induced {{structural}} {{changes in the}} cortical region of the garland cell, which {{is considered to be}} active in endocytosis, were investigated in a temperature-sensitive, single gene mutant of Drosophila melanogaster, shibire tsl (shi) and wild-type (Oregon-R). At 19 °C, both shi and wild type showed similar structural features: an irregularly extended network of labyrinthine channels, coated pits and vesicles, tubular elements and alpha vacuoles. Tannic acid (TA) impregnation showed that coated pits comprised ~ 20 - 25 % of the total coated profiles at 19 °C in both shi and wild-type. When flies were incubated in a horseradish peroxidase (HRP) solution for 5 min, organelles such as coated <b>profiles,</b> <b>tubular</b> elements, and alpha vacuoles were labeled. In wild-type at 30 °C, minor changes were observed [...] mainly a decrease in the distribution of the labyrinthine channels and an increase in HRP uptake. On the other hand, in shi at 30 °C, the labyrinthine channels were much elongated and their network became far more complex, indicating the expansion of the surface area of the cell. Also, the coated profiles were increased in number while the number of tubular elements was decreased considerably. The TA method showed that almost all of the coated profiles were coated pits, coated vesicle...|$|R
