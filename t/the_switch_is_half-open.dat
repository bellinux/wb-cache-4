50|$|<b>The</b> term cold <b>switching</b> {{indicates}} that a <b>switch</b> <b>is</b> activated with no signal applied. Therefore, no current will flow when <b>the</b> <b>switch</b> <b>is</b> closed, and no current will <b>be</b> interrupted when <b>the</b> <b>switch</b> <b>is</b> opened. In contrast, in hot <b>switching,</b> voltage <b>is</b> present and current will flow immediately once the contacts close.

50|$|A {{latching}} <b>switch</b> <b>is</b> a <b>switch</b> that {{maintains its}} state after being activated.

50|$|If <b>the</b> <b>switch</b> <b>is</b> cycled fast enough, the {{inductor}} {{will not}} discharge fully in between charging stages, and the load will always see a voltage {{greater than that}} of the input source alone when <b>the</b> <b>switch</b> <b>is</b> opened. Also while <b>the</b> <b>switch</b> <b>is</b> opened, <b>the</b> capacitor in parallel with the load is charged to this combined voltage. When <b>the</b> <b>switch</b> <b>is</b> then closed and the right hand side is shorted out from the left hand side, the capacitor is therefore able to provide the voltage and energy to the load. During this time, the blocking diode prevents the capacitor from discharging through <b>the</b> <b>switch.</b> <b>The</b> <b>switch</b> must of course be opened again fast enough to prevent the capacitor from discharging too much.|$|R
