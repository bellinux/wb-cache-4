Later, thinking Josh is ill, Liz goes to order some soup and on her way, sees Josh. He meets with a producer from The Daily Show, which angers Liz, who decides to help Jack negotiate. When Josh and his agent return to negotiate, believing that an offer from the Daily Show was on the table, Jack promptly reveals {{that he was able}} to get the offer from the Daily Show pulled and thus leave Josh with no negotiating power.

2500|$|The company's major income-earning {{sources are}} its rock trains, {{transporting}} primarily limestone, and intermodal trains. FEC freight trains operate on precise schedules. Trains are not held for missed connections or late loadings. [...] Most of the trains are paired {{so that they}} leave simultaneously from their starting points and meet halfway through the run and swap crews, so they are back {{home at the end}} of their runs. The FEC pioneered operation with 2 man crews with no crew districts, which they were able <b>to</b> <b>start</b> <b>doing</b> after the 1963 strike. The entire railroad adopted positive train control (PTC) after a fatal 1987 collision caused by a crew not obeying signaling. (PTC is a safety feature long-sought by federal safety officials for all railroads).|$|E

2500|$|Hanson {{has argued}} that the U.S. may be forced to take a much more confrontational stance towards Iranian {{violation}} of prior nuclear enrichment prohibitions, advocating, if necessary, [...] unilateral responses to the country should it continue its aggressive acts of war. On the Hugh Hewitt show in August 2007, Hanson stated, [...] "We really need <b>to</b> <b>start</b> <b>doing</b> some things beyond talking, and if that is going into Iranian airspace, or buzzing Iranians, or even starting to forget where the border is and taking out some of these training camps, we need to do that and send a message, because they're a paper tiger. They really are." [...] In a 2014 column Hanson faulted the Obama administration for engaging in [...] "appeasement" [...] of Iran and of fruitlessly attempting to negotiate an end to the Iranian program to acquire nuclear weapons, predicating if Iran continued enrichment unchecked that: [...] "Accordingly, it is more than likely that {{in the next two years}} Iran will become a nuclear power." ...|$|E
2500|$|One of {{the most}} often criticised points of C++ is its {{enormous}} complexity as a language, {{the large number of}} non-orthogonal features. This in practice necessitates restricting code to subset of C++, thus eschewing the readability benefits of common style and idioms. As expressed by Joshua Bloch: [...] I think C++ was pushed well beyond its complexity threshold and yet {{there are a lot of}} people programming it. But what you do is you force people to subset it. So almost every shop that I know of that uses C++ says, “Yes, we’re using C++ but we’re not doing multiple-implementation inheritance and we’re not using operator overloading.” There are just a bunch of features that you’re not going to use because the complexity of the resulting code is too high. And I don’t think it’s good when you have <b>to</b> <b>start</b> <b>doing</b> that. You lose this programmer portability where everyone can read everyone else’s code, which I think is such a good thing. [...] Ken Thompson comments on how that came to be: [...] It certainly has its good points. But by and large I think it’s a bad language. It does a lot of things half well and it’s just a garbage heap of ideas that are mutually exclusive. Everybody I know, whether it’s personal or corporate, selects a subset and these subsets are different. So it’s not a good language to transport an algorithm—to say, “I wrote it; here, take it.” It’s way too big, way too complex. And it’s obviously built by a committee.|$|E
