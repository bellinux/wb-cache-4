25|$|<b>The</b> <b>obstacles</b> <b>to</b> reunification are {{the same}} as in 1956: having Nantes in Brittany could harm the {{position}} of Rennes and create an economic imbalance between Lower and Upper Brittany. Moreover, the Pays de la Loire region could not exist without Loire-Atlantique, because it would lose its political and economic capital. Without Loire-Atlantique, the other départements would not form an efficient region any more, and would have to integrate neighbouring regions such as the Centre-Val de Loire and Poitou-Charentes.|$|E

His successor, John Dillon, claimed that Redmond had removed all <b>the</b> <b>obstacles</b> <b>to</b> Irish unity except those of the Ulster unionists. He had persuaded British public and political opinion of all hues of its merits. William O'Brien and his dissident AFIL Party warned in similar vein, that the volatile Northern Ireland situation was left unresolved.|$|E

25|$|Economic {{development}} {{has generally been}} more rapid in coastal provinces than in the interior and there are large disparities in per capita income between regions. The three wealthiest regions are along the southeast coast, centered on the Pearl River Delta; along the east coast, centered on the Lower Yangtze River; and near the Bohai Gulf, in the Beijing–Tianjin region. It is the rapid development of these areas {{that is expected to}} have the most significant effect on the Asian regional economy as a whole and Chinese government policy is designed to remove <b>the</b> <b>obstacles</b> <b>to</b> accelerated growth in these wealthier regions.|$|E

25|$|Forestry is an {{important}} economic resource for Papua New Guinea but the industry uses low and semi-intensive technological inputs. As a result, product ranges are limited to sawed timber, veneer, plywood, block board, moulding, poles and posts and wood chips. Only a few limited finished products are exported. Lack of automated machinery, coupled with inadequately trained local technical personnel, are some of <b>the</b> <b>obstacles</b> <b>to</b> introducing automated machinery and design. Policy-makers need to {{turn their attention to}} eliminating these barriers, in order for forestry to make a more efficient and sustainable contribution to national economic development.|$|E
25|$|Hancock's {{men began}} {{assembling}} near the Brown farm that evening, about 1200 yards {{north of the}} Mule Shoe, in a torrential rainstorm. The men and junior officers were poorly prepared for the assault, lacking basic information {{about the nature of}} the ground to be covered, <b>the</b> <b>obstacles</b> <b>to</b> expect, or how the Confederate line was configured. Confederates could hear their preparations through the storm, but could not decide whether an attack was imminent or the Union Army was preparing to withdraw. Allegheny Johnson became suspicious and requested to Ewell that his artillery be returned. Ewell agreed, but somehow the order did not reach the artillery units until 3:30a.m. on May 12, 30 minutes before Hancock's assault was planned to start.|$|E
25|$|But if Tilney's {{censorship}} {{restricted the}} writers, his support protected them from generally hostile civic authorities. The polite fiction of aristocratic patronage did not obscure {{the reality that}} the troupes were commercial enterprises; however, that fiction brought the theatres under royal protection; in 1592, the Lord Mayor of London named Tilney as one of <b>the</b> <b>obstacles</b> <b>to</b> ending public drama in the city. However, Tilney's censorship was not of a generalising nature. While he did omit politically volatile passages and scenes, some, like the deposition scene in Richard II and the murder of Julius Caesar, were allowed to remain. However, {{there is no way}} of knowing whether Julius Caesar was allowed to be performed uncensored. Shakespeare's plays seemed to have suffered the severest form of censorship under Tilney.|$|E

25|$|The {{individuality}} of a {{being is}} a certain intricate form, not an enduring substance. In order to understand an organism, it must {{be thought of as}} a pattern which maintains itself through homeostasis – life continues by maintaining an internal balance of various factors such as temperature and molecular structure. While the material substances that compose a living being may be constantly replaced by nearly identical ones, an organism continues functioning with the same identity as long as the pattern is kept sufficiently intact. Since patterns can be transmitted, modified, or duplicated, they are therefore a kind of information. Based on this, Wiener suggests it should be theoretically possible to transmit the entirety of a living person as a message (which is practically indistinguishable from the concept of physical teleportation) – although he admits that <b>the</b> <b>obstacles</b> <b>to</b> such a process would be great, because of the enormous amount of information embodied in a person, and the difficulty of reading or writing it.|$|E
