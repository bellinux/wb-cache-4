5|$|The Apostles of the Stars launch {{their first}} {{attack on the}} World Summit, killing the leaders from 20 top nations, causing Chronos to declare war on them. Chronos even notify Train of a new Sweeper bounty on Creed {{in order to gain}} his help, though he resists, {{planning}} to go after him on his own terms. Chronos assassin Jenos Hazard is sent to hire Rinslet to gather information on the Apostles, however, <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>really</b> in order to use her as bait to lure Creed out of hiding and force Train to get involved, who was lured to the same area via false Sweeper intel. Jenos and the other two members of the special unit Cerebus launch an assault on Creed's lair, that results in it being turned to rubble, while Train simply rescues Rinslet and leaves. Creed then tries to kill Sven, believing he is holding Train back from joining him, but accidentally shoots Train with a nanomachine-enhanced bullet that has the unplanned effect of reverting his body to that of a child. In order to return Train to normal, Train, Sven and Eve visit nanotechnology expert Dr. Tearju, who is also Eve's creator. While there, the Apostles of the Stars attack to force Tearju to join them in order to grant Creed eternal life through nanomachines, but are defeated by a returned Train who can now fire a railgun shot thanks to the nanomachines. However, Eathes was able to copy Tearju, gaining all of her knowledge, and Train, Sven and Eve finally decide {{to put a stop to}} Creed.|$|E

It was killed by Captain Marvel (who was actually a Skrull sleeper agent) with its remains decimated in one powerful attack.|$|E

25|$|Equivalently, one {{can take}} the Stone space of the {{complete}} Boolean algebra of all subsets of X as the Stone–Čech compactification. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>really</b> the same construction, as the Stone space of this Boolean algebra is the set of ultrafilters (or equivalently prime ideals, or homomorphisms to the 2 element Boolean algebra) of the Boolean algebra, {{which is the same}} as the set of ultrafilters on X.|$|E
25|$|However, {{more recent}} {{biological}} analyses, such as Richard Dawkins' The Selfish Gene, have contended that Morgan's Canon {{is not the}} simplest and most basic explanation. Dawkins argues the way evolution works is that the genes propagated in most copies end up determining the development of that particular species, i.e., natural selection turns out to select specific genes, and <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>really</b> the fundamental underlying principle that automatically gives individual and group selection as emergent features of evolution.|$|E
25|$|The next morning, Amanda {{tries to}} sneak away early, but is {{surprised}} to find Sybil and Victor there. As they talk, Elyot comes in, and he and Amanda start bickering again. It has been decided that neither of the new spouses will grant a divorce for a year, to give Amanda and Elyot time to confirm if <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>really</b> what they want. As tempers rise, Sybil and Victor begin to bicker with each other, defending their respective spouses. Amanda and Elyot realise that Sybil and Victor are as suited {{to each other as}} they are, forgive one another and sneak out, leaving the younger two together. As Elyot and Amanda tiptoe out, Victor and Sybil have reached the point of mutual violence.|$|E

25|$|In the narrative, {{just prior}} to this test, when Joseph had first met all of his {{brothers}} (but not identified himself to them), he had held a feast for them; the narrative heavily implies that Benjamin was Joseph's favorite brother, since he is overcome with tears when he first meets Benjamin in particular, and he gives Benjamin {{five times as much}} food as he apportions to the others. According to textual scholars, <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>really</b> the Jahwist's account of the reunion after Joseph identifies himself, and the account of the threat to enslave Benjamin is just the Elohist's version of the same event, with the Elohist being more terse about Joseph's emotions towards Benjamin, merely mentioning that Benjamin was given five times as many gifts as the others.|$|E
25|$|Further {{corrections}} {{that are}} often employed include background correction and line overlap correction. The background signal in an XRF spectrum derives primarily from scattering of primary beam photons by the sample surface. Scattering varies with the sample mass absorption, being greatest when mean atomic number is low. When measuring trace amounts of an element, or when measuring on a variable light matrix, background correction becomes necessary. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>really</b> only feasible on a sequential spectrometer. Line overlap is a common problem, bearing {{in mind that the}} spectrum of a complex mineral can contain several hundred measurable lines. Sometimes it can be overcome by measuring a less-intense, but overlap-free line, but in certain instances a correction is inevitable. For instance, the Kα is the only usable line for measuring sodium, and it overlaps the zinc Lβ (L2-M4) line. Thus zinc, if present, must be analysed in order to properly correct the sodium value.|$|E
500|$|The {{episode was}} written by John Swartzwelder, and {{directed}} by Susie Dietter. When Dietter read through his first script, she did not find it very funny {{because of all the}} visual gags. Once the animatic was finished, her opinion changed, and she thought to herself: [...] "Hey, <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>really</b> funny!".|$|E
6000|$|... "Well?" [...] he said. He yawned openly, {{and lit a}} cigarette. He {{could not}} believe that <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>really</b> {{happening}} to him. [...] "What is it?" ...|$|R

50|$|<b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>really</b> {{the end of}} the sect's history. Later, in {{the middle}} of the century, traces of their {{activity}} are found, especially in northern Italy, Spain, and France, but these were only isolated survivals.|$|R
500|$|In February 2006, Ratner {{said that}} The Last Stand {{could be the}} final X-Men film: [...] "We {{wanted to make sure}} the audiences knew that this was a trilogy. Even though they weren't made {{together}} like Lord of the Rings, <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>really</b> closure for the X-Men series. … This is the last stand for sure." ...|$|E
500|$|Huyck later {{recalled}} [...] "at one point {{when we were}} writing it we told George “We {{know a lot of}} Indians. We've been there... I don't think they're going to think <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>really</b> so cool. Do you think you're going to have trouble shooting there?” He said, “Are you kidding? It's me and Steve." [...] Months later they called and said, “We can't shoot in India. They're really upset.” So they shot in Sri Lanka and London, mostly.” ...|$|E
500|$|.....I {{thought about}} what I had been offered and I said to myself, [...] "What am I being so damn grand about? I have two {{children}} to support, the part {{they want me to}} play has a lot of dignity, the show is already on the air, I wouldn't have to film a pilot, and they have a sponsor. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>really</b> a great gift that has been offered me. I'd be stupid not to at least look into it." ...|$|E
60|$|On drawing {{near to the}} {{struggling}} monster we observed that <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>really</b> the case. Blood streamed from the eye into which I had fired, and poured down his hideous jaws, dyeing the water in which he floundered.|$|R
6000|$|Slowly and painfully the statesman {{worked the}} truth {{into his head}} that <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>really</b> a flesh and blood young man, and not the insubstantial resurrection he and Sellers had so long {{supposed}} him to be. Then he said with feeling-- ...|$|R
60|$|Monstrous and odious as {{the wild}} {{thing was to}} him, he {{determined}} to seek it out, and prove if <b>this</b> <b>were</b> <b>really</b> so; and also to seek it with another intention, which came into his thoughts at the same time.|$|R
500|$|BackRub already {{exhibited}} the rudimentary functions {{and characteristics of}} a search engine: a query input was entered and it provided a list of backlinks ranked by importance. Page recalled: [...] "We realized {{that we had a}} querying tool. It gave you a good overall ranking of pages and ordering of follow-up pages." [...] Page said that in mid-1998 they finally realized the further potential of their project: [...] "Pretty soon, we had 10,000 searches a day. And we figured, maybe <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>really</b> real." ...|$|E
500|$|Critical {{estimates}} were divided from the start. Reviewing Auden's first book, Poems (1930), Naomi Mitchison wrote [...] "If <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>really</b> only the beginning, we have perhaps a master {{to look forward}} to." [...] But John Sparrow, recalling Mitchison's comment in 1934, dismissed Auden's early work as [...] "a monument to the misguided aims that prevail among contemporary poets, {{and the fact that}} ... he is being hailed as 'a master' shows how criticism is helping poetry on the downward path." [...] Joseph Brodsky claimed that he had [...] "the greatest mind of the twentieth century".|$|E
500|$|Following {{their last}} record, the highly {{successful}} Odyssey Number Five, the band {{agreed that they}} wanted to continue in their musical careers, but wanted to have more fun with it. They were no longer dole reliant, as they had been when they made their debut album, Parables for Wooden Ears. Drummer Jon Coghill told The Sydney Morning Herald [...] "we wanted to have more fun and enjoy that we were a band, rather than chase what you're supposed to do", and guitarist Ian Haug said [...] "We all found that <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>really</b> important to us, but we wanted to make it more fun".|$|E
60|$|<b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>really</b> such a {{confusing}} question that Ada {{looked at me}} in perfect dismay. As to the guilty nature of my own consciousness after what I had been thinking, {{it must have been}} expressed in the colour of my cheeks.|$|R
5|$|Most {{people can}} only judge of things by the {{experiences}} of ordinary life, but phenomena {{outside the scope of}} <b>this</b> <b>are</b> <b>really</b> quite numerous. How insecure it is to investigate natural principles using only the light of common knowledge, and subjective ideas.|$|R
50|$|Periyar {{declared}} that the Self-Respect Movement alone could be the genuine freedom movement, and political freedom would not be fruitful without individual self-respect. He remarked that the so-called 'Indian freedom fighters' were showing disrespect of self-respect, and <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>really</b> an irrational philosophy.|$|R
500|$|Part of the 2001 {{playback}} {{scene was}} included in Martin Scorsese's documentary , and an early take from the 1970 sessions appeared on the bonus disc accompanying that film's DVD release in late 2011. This demo version, which Harrison introduces as [...] "Awaiting for You All", was included on the compilation [...] (2012). Referring to Harrison's stated regret {{at the amount of}} echo Spector used on All Things Must Pass, compilation producer Giles Martin says of the song's sparse arrangement on Early Takes: [...] "I think <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>really</b> cool, it's got a good basic band groove, I think of it as George breaking down a wall of sound." ...|$|E
500|$|Alan Sepinwall, {{television}} {{writer for}} The Star-Ledger, said Michael acted so [...] "nakedly selfish and unfeeling" [...] {{that it made}} the episode unpleasant to watch: [...] "If last week's 'Blood Drive' gave us Michael at his most human and sympathetic, then 'Golden Ticket' showed how a human Michael {{could also be a}} monster." [...] However, Sepinwall said he did think the subplot involving Kevin receiving romantic advice was funny and sweet: [...] "Brian Baumgartner's just been aces the last two weeks, and if it hadn't been for this story, I might have found 'Golden Ticket' unbearable." [...] Dan Hopper of VH1's Best Week Ever strongly criticized the episode and the behavior of the characters: [...] "Why was every single character on last night’s Willy Wonka episode acting like a complete idiot? Not 'idiot' {{in the sense that the}} characters are always dumb and goofy in an amusing way, but 'idiot' as in 'none of these human beings would ever act this way and <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>really</b> frustrating to watch? ...|$|E
500|$|The main {{theme of}} Xander's dream is {{his sense of}} failure and of being left behind as his friends move ahead in life. His fear that he is stuck is reiterated {{throughout}} his dream by his inability to escape his basement bedroom in his parents' home. No matter where his dream takes him, he ends up back in the basement. As {{the only one of}} the Scoobies not in college, he feels anxiety about his ability to understand and keep up with ideas and conversations, a fear which is realized when he goes to the university, a place he already feels excluded from, and finds that he cannot understand what people say to him. Aware that he is being chased and is in danger, he asks Giles what is happening but cannot understand his answer, nor what Anya says to him, as they are both inexplicably speaking French. He exclaims, [...] "I don't understand!" [...] During his dream both Buffy and Willow tell him, [...] "I'm way ahead of you," [...] and Giles tells him [...] "the others have gone on ahead," [...] underscoring his fear that <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>really</b> the case.|$|E
6000|$|<b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>really</b> what Lapidoth wanted. And for {{the moment}} he felt a sort of comfort in {{recovering}} his daughter's dutiful attendance, that made a change of habits seem possible to him. She led {{him down to the}} parlor below, and said-- ...|$|R

60|$|Here Mr. Effingham rose, {{rang the}} bell for Pierre, and went to his own room, doubting, in his own mind, from all that he had seen, whether <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>really</b> the Templeton he had known in his youth, and whether {{he was in his}} own house or not.|$|R
