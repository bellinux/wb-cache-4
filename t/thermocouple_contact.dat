40|$|The {{topic of}} this thesis is {{estimation}} of the dynamic changes of the surface temperatureand heat flux during heating processes by using an inverse method. The local transient surface temperature and heat flux of a steel slab are calculated based on measurements {{in the interior of}} the slab. The motivations for using an inverse method may be manifold. Sometimes, especially in the field of thermal engineering, one wants to calculate the transient temperature or heat flux on the surface of a body. This body may be a slab, or billet in metallurgical applications. However, it may be the case that the surface for some reason is inaccessible to exterior measurements with the aid of some measurement device. Such a device could be a <b>thermocouple</b> if <b>contact</b> with the surface in question is possible or a pyrometer if an invasive method is preferred. Sometimes though, these kinds of devices may be an inappropriate choice. It could be the case that the installation of any such device may disturb the experiment in some way or that the environment is chemically destructive or just that the instruments might give incorrect results. In these situations one is directed to using an inverse method based on interior measurements in the body, and in which the desired temperature is calculated by a numerical procedure. The mathematical model used was applied to experimental data from a small scale laboratory furnace as well as from a full scale industrial reheating furnace and the results verified that the method can be successfully applied to high temperature thermal applications.

The mass loss from the samples was measured in an special furnace facility that heated the samples over a progressively longer duration while the mass of the samples was measured precisely between each heating interval. Thermal-mechanical properties were measured using standard techniques at the NASA Langley Research Center and its subcontractors...|$|R
40|$|Within Europe 241 Am is a {{feasible}} {{alternative to}} 238 Pu {{that can provide}} a heat source for radioisotope thermoelectric generators (RTGs) and radioisotope heating units (RHUs) {{to be used in}} Electrical power sources used in outer planet missions. In the EPSO-SPACE* project developed as an exploratory research at JRC, a new type of nuclear power source, to provide heat and electricity for deep space missions is considered. It will consist of a 241 Am based compound with aerogel thermal insulation and <b>thermocouples</b> in close <b>contact</b> with the heat source. The assembly is inside an iridium encapsulation to withstand all relevant accident scenarios. The design will be modular and combinable for required electrical output. Several candidate Americium compounds will be investigated for chemical stability at high temperature and for self-irradiation damage. New thermo-electric converter materials containing actinides will be assessed, and a robust encapsulation designed. Safety analyses will be performed including launch explosion and re-entry accidents. The research will conclude in a conceptual design of a prototype power source. In {{the first part of this}} study, americium dioxide will be considered from the point of view of its chemical durability and of its behavior against radiation damage and helium formation, two aspects to be carefully investigated due to the high alpha-activity of the americium. Transmission electron Microscopy (TEM) and helium thermal desorption spectrometry (TDS) experiments will be described and results on aged (more than 30 years) AmO 2 reported. Some comparison with 238 PuO 2 based RTG’s will be discussed...|$|R
40|$|A 5 / 16 in thick, 6 in x 6 {{in steel}} plate {{was used as}} a simple analog to 4 inch grade “S” steel drill pipe. Ethylene tetraflouroethylene (ETFE) applied as a powder coating was {{selected}} as the desired thermally insulating coating because of its excellent chemical resistance, maximum service temperature of 300 °C, its thermal conductivity of 0. 238 W/m-K, and for its ability to be applied in thicknesses of up to 80 mils. A powder primer coat of approximately 2 mils was applied using a conventional corona electrostatic powder sprayer, and then the high build topcoat was applied directly over the dry primer coat using the same technique to a thickness of about 10 mils. The primer and first topcoat were then cured at an elevated temperature. Subsequent layers of topcoat were hot flocked until a final coating thickness of 60 mils was achieved. To determine the effective thermal conductivity of the coated steel, an apparatus consisting of three <b>contact</b> <b>thermocouples,</b> a hot plate, and polystyrene foam panels was assembled. The hot plate was heated to a constant temperature, then the room temperature coated steel plate was placed under the polystyrene insulation on the hot plate, coated side up. The temperature of both sides of the coated plate was then measured for 30 minutes. The heat flux was then calculated through the bare steel plate. This heat flux value was used to calculate the effective thermal conductivity of the coated plates. The average measured effective thermal conductivities for 40 mil, 60 mil, and 80 mil coatings were 0. 82 W/m-K, 0. 61 W/m-K, and 0. 69 W/m-K respectively...|$|R
