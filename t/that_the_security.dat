The worst act of terrorism against the United States prior to 9/11, the bombing of Pan Am Flight 103 over Lockerbie, Scotland, which killed 189 Americans, happened during the Reagan years.|$|E
5|$|In April 1987 Reagan {{appointed}} Matlock as Ambassador to the Soviet Union. Conditions at the Embassy were tense, as Marine Sergeant Clayton Lonetree {{had been}} found to have compromised Embassy security. Within a few months of the Lonetree scandal, all U.S. intelligence assets in the Soviet Union had been exposed. The Americans suspected <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>security</b> breach had meant that the Embassy code room was no longer secure and worked frantically to determine how. It was not until 1994 that Aldrich Ames, a mole within the CIA, was caught. Another mole, Robert Hanssen, this time within the FBI, was caught only in 2001.|$|E
5|$|The Octopus card uses {{encryption}} for all airborne {{communication and}} performs mutual authentication between {{the card and}} reader based on the ISO 9798-2 three-pass mutual authentication protocol. In other words, data communications are only established when the card and reader have mutually authenticated based on a shared secret access key. This means <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>security</b> of the Octopus card system would be jeopardized should the access key be exposed. A stolen Octopus card reader could be used with stolen Octopus software, for example, to add value (up to HK$1,000) to any Octopus card without authorization. Nevertheless, as of 2003, the Octopus card and system have never been successfully hacked.|$|E

5|$|In 1977, Biko {{broke his}} banning order by {{travelling}} to Cape Town, hoping to meet Unity Movement leader Neville Alexander {{and deal with}} growing dissent in the Western Cape branch of the BCM, which was dominated by Marxists like Johnny Issel. Biko drove to the city with his Coloured friend Peter Jones on 17 August, but Alexander refused to meet with Biko, fearing {{that he was being}} monitored by the police. Biko and Jones drove back toward King William's Town, but on 18 August they were stopped at a police roadblock near Grahamstown. Biko was arrested for having violated the order restricting him to King William's Town. Unsubstantiated claims have been made <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>security</b> services were aware of Biko's trip to Cape Town and that the road block had been erected to catch him. Jones was also arrested at the roadblock; he was subsequently held without trial for 533 days, during which he was interrogated on numerous occasions.|$|E
5|$|Under {{pressure}} from Pretoria {{to accept the}} terms, the Rhodesians agreed on 11 December 1974 and followed {{the terms of the}} ceasefire; Rhodesian military actions were temporarily halted and troops were ordered to allow retreating guerrillas to leave unhindered. Vorster withdrew some 2,000 members of the South African Police (SAP) from forward bases in Rhodesia, and by August 1975 had pulled the SAP out of Rhodesia completely. The nationalists used the sudden cessation of security force activity as an opportunity to regroup and re-establish themselves {{both inside and outside the}} country. Guerrilla operations continued: an average of six incidents a day were reported inside Rhodesia over the following months. Far from being seen as a gesture of potential reconciliation, the ceasefire and release of the nationalist leaders gave the message to the rural population <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>security</b> forces had been defeated and that the guerrillas were in the process of emulating FRELIMO's victory in Mozambique. The détente terms led to the Victoria Falls Conference of August 1975, which collapsed after nine-and-a-half hours, each side blaming the other for the break-up.|$|E

40|$|In 2007, the {{collapse}} of the housing market and the developing trend of state court filings of class actions alleging violations of <b>the</b> <b>Securities</b> Act culminated into a new type of securities litigation: state court filings of class actions alleging violations of <b>the</b> <b>Securities</b> Act with respect to non-publicly traded securities in general and mortgage-backed securities in particular. Thus, it became important for defendants to remove these claims to federal court. Permitting removal of such claims appears to conflict with <b>the</b> <b>Securities</b> Act, which broadly prohibits removal of claims arising under <b>the</b> <b>Securities</b> Act. But prohibiting removal is in tension with the Class Action Fairness Act of 2005, which generally permits removal of class actions. This article considers whether <b>the</b> <b>Securities</b> Act bars removal of class actions alleging violations of <b>the</b> <b>Securities</b> Act with respect to non-publicly traded securities. Part I of this article provides a background on the issue and explains the general framework of removal and the conflicting provisions of <b>the</b> <b>Securities</b> Act and <b>the</b> Class Action Fairness Act. Next, Part II discusses the Ninth Circuit 2 ̆ 7 s holding in Luther v. Countrywide <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Securities</b> Act bars removal of a class action alleging violations of <b>the</b> <b>Securities</b> Act with respect to mortgage-backed securities. Part III analyzes the Seventh Circuit 2 ̆ 7 s decision in Katz v. Gerardi, in which the court disagreed with Luther and held <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Securities</b> Act does not bar removal of class actions that allege violations of <b>the</b> <b>Securities</b> Act with respect to non-publicly traded securities. Finally, Part IV analyzes and expands on the reasoning of the Luther and Katz courts, concluding <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Seventh Circuit decided correctly <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Securities</b> Act does not bar removal of class actions alleging violations of <b>the</b> <b>Securities</b> Act with respect to non-publicly traded securities...|$|R

25|$|The British {{security}} forces, however, {{had received}} detailed and accurate intelligence about the IRA's plans.
