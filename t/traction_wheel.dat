40|$|An Autonomous Mobile Robot battery driven, {{with two}} {{traction}} wheels and a steering wheel is being developed. This Robot central control is regulated by an IPC, which controls every function of security, steering, positioning localization and driving.

40|$|ABSTRACT: The use of {{fertilizers}} and solid amendments in agriculture generates special interest for {{their effect on}} crop productivity, {{as well as for}} their environmental impact. The efficient use of these products demands knowing their physical and mechanical properties, the storing conditions effect and the operational characteristics of the metering systems used in the fertilizing equipment. In this context, the present study was developed with the purpose of evaluating the operational characteristics of different fertilizing metering systems and to determine the adequate metering system-product operational parameters, using powder lime, powder gypsum, granular 10 - 30 - 10 (N-P-K), and granular urea. Operational differences were established among four types of commercial fertilizer metering systems, including wire auger, star-shaped feed wheel, feed screw and ridged <b>traction</b> <b>wheel.</b> The study found that the unloading rate depends directly on the fertilizer metering system’s rotating speed and is affected by particle size, repose angle, bulk density and moisture content of the applied product. The wire auger and star-shaped feed wheel metering systems were adequate for the distribution of powder products and the feed screw for granulated fertilizers...|$|E

40|$|Introduction – Transportation {{accounts}} for {{about a quarter of}} energy use [1], so efficiency improvements in energy conversions allow reductions in fuel consumption and pollutant emissions of internal combustion engines used for vehicle propulsion. Our previous works [2 - 5] were devoted to important issues like energy storage techniques, power converters, hybrid vehicle configurations and zero-emissions-vehicles (ZEVs) powered by batteries, supercapacitors or fuel cells. A substantial gain in vehicle efficiency is primarily a matter of improved vehicle design and only secondarily depends on engine type and efficiency. In fact measures like reductions of vehicle mass, aerodynamic drag and rolling resistance contribute to less power and mass needed for both engine and drivetrain. The authors are now focused on innovative propulsion systems [6 - 8] in order to achieve greater vehicle efficiency and higher safety in transportation means (i. e. the propelling force is independent of drag between <b>traction</b> <b>wheels</b> and road ― useful especially in bad weather conditions...|$|R

5000|$|Losing <b>traction</b> {{with one}} <b>wheel</b> still retains <b>traction</b> {{for the other}} wheels on that side; in effect, a {{longitudinal}} differential lock is permanently engaged. This does have the downside of driveline windup.|$|R
40|$|In this paper, {{we address}} the problem of {{stabilisation}} of robots subject to nonholonommic constraints and external disturbances using port-Hamiltonian theory and smooth time-invariant control laws. This should be contrasted with the commonly used switched or time-varying laws. We propose a control design that provides asymptotic stability of an manifold (also called relative equilibria) - due to the Brockett condition this is the only type of stabilisation possible using smooth time-invariant control laws. The equilibrium manifold can be shaped to certain extent to satisfy specific control objectives. The proposed control law also incorporates integral action, and thus the closed-loop system is robust to unknown constant disturbances. A key step in the proposed design is a change of coordinates not only in the momentum, but also in the position vector, which differs from coordinate transformations previously proposed in the literature for the control of nonholonomic systems. The theoretical properties of the control law are verified via numerical simulation based on a robotic ground vehicle model with differential <b>traction</b> <b>wheels</b> and non co-axial centre of mass and point of contact...|$|R
