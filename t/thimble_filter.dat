40|$|A wet {{chemical}} sampling method using acidic absorbing solutions {{was used to}} determine levels of ammonia (NH 3) in syngas from a biomass gasifier. Before syngas is bubbled into the absorbing solutions, a quartz <b>thimble</b> <b>filter</b> is used to filter ash from the gas stream at 450 °C followed by heavy tar removal at about 100 °C. When gasifying corn, good precision was observed for multiple samples collected on any given day of testing. Tests on producer gas obtained from gasification of switchgrass revealed important conditions for successfully sampling NH 3. During gasification of switchgrass, high solids loading in the syngas caused the primary cyclone at the gasifier exit to plug, resulting in abnormally high ash loading in the <b>thimble</b> <b>filter</b> in the sampling system. While gasifying the switchgrass, the NH 3 levels showed a continuous decline throughout the day. It is suspected that NH 3 reacts with the ash in the <b>thimble</b> <b>filter,</b> confounding attempts to accurately measure NH 3 in the syngas...|$|E
