2500|$|Aun Weor {{states that}} the solar bodies are formed {{in the same manner}} that {{physical}} bodies are formed: through use of the sexual function. In order to form the solar bodies, sexual transmutation is taught via the hetero sexual magic of married couples engaged in coitus without orgasm or seminal ejaculation. Sexual magic is the arousal of sexual energies through the act of coitus between husband and wife, but instead of expelling those energies through orgasm they are transmuted into higher octaves of energy. Each successive Solar Body {{is the result of the}} saturation of transmuted sexual energy at its respective octave: first, the [...] "Christ Astral" [...] is formed by transmuting the sex energy into a second octave; second, the [...] "Christ Mind" [...] is formed by saturating, condensing or crystallizing the sexual energy into a <b>third</b> <b>octave,</b> and the causal body or [...] "Christ Will" [...] is formed by transmuting the sexual energy called [...] "Hydrogen SI-12", into a fourth octave. The [...] "birth" [...] of the solar bodies is what Samael Aun Weor states is the true meaning of being [...] "born again." [...] It is taught that the solar bodies are referred to in the Bible as the three sons of Noah or the three Christians in the (alchemical) furnace of Nebuchadnezzar.|$|E

5000|$|The timbre of the cornettino is more pungent, {{brighter}} {{and a little}} more incisive than that of the regular cornetto. Cornettini were frequently used in large consorts and orchestras in the company of trumpets and high violin parts.

50|$|Nicholson used a flute made by George Astor & Co., a London-based firm {{operating}} from c1778 to c1831. His father, also a celebrated flautist, modified the instrument, lining the headpiece with metal, enlarging the embouchure and toneholes {{with a view}} to making the flute's tone more powerful, yet still delicate, permitting the usual fingerings in the <b>third</b> <b>octave,</b> facilitating glides and vibratos.|$|E
50|$|A careful {{examination}} of the flute fingering for the notes D6 through G6 reveals that they are actually a combination of third and fourth harmonic fingerings. For example, the D fingering is like the low D {{with the addition of}} the G key vented, for which D6 is the third harmonic. Similarly, in the <b>third</b> <b>octave,</b> the E is a combination of E and A fingerings, the F is a combination of F and B, et cetera.|$|E
50|$|Currently, the gaita asturiana is {{constructed}} {{in a wider}} array of keys and types, anywhere from A to as high as E. Also, refinement of the chanter construction {{has made it possible}} to play as high as the tonic in the <b>third</b> <b>octave.</b> Further, the ability to hit chromatic notes has increased, turning the chanter from a completely diatonic instrument to a nearly fully chromatic one. The addition of auxiliary holes has also increased. As a further sign of modernisation, keys have been added to some variants to extend range and chromatic ability.|$|E

5000|$|Trill keys: The three {{standard}} trill keys permit rapid alternation {{between two}} notes with disparate standard fingerings: lowest, middle, and highest trill keys ease C-D, C-D, and B-A, respectively. Some higher notes (<b>third</b> <b>octave</b> B and B and most fourth octave notes) also require {{use of the}} two lower trill keys. A fourth so-called C trill key is an increasingly popular option available on many flutes. It is named after one of its uses (to ease the B to C trill) but it also allows some trills and tremolos that are otherwise very difficult, such as high G to high A. Another way of trilling G6-A6 is a dedicated high G-A trill key.|$|E
50|$|Labinsky {{was born}} to a large family in {{internal}} exile in Siberia. From 1881, he sang in the choir of Saint Sofia cathedral in Tobolsk. Labinsky moved to Tyumen and became a soloist in the Znamensky cathedral choir. After finishing school he became a soloist in the Synodal Choir. In 1899 he completed a course in solo singing at the Saint Petersburg Conservatory under Professors S.Gabel and V.Samus. He possessed an even, flexible voice with a pleasant, soft timbre and a wide range (going up to F in the <b>third</b> <b>octave).</b> From 1896 he sang in the Mariinsky Theater chorus. In 1899-1912 and 1919-1924 he was a soloist at the Mariinsky Theatre. After 1926 {{he worked at the}} Bolshoi Theatre.|$|E
50|$|Krokus {{was formed}} in 1975 as a {{primarily}} progressive rock act. Chris von Rohr, originally the drummer, switched to lead vocals in the late 1970s and with that formation Krokus was successful in Switzerland, touring throughout the country. After seeing AC/DC in concert in the late 70s, they decided to change their musical direction and adopted a new sound which was heavily influenced by that band. Since von Rohr possessed limited vocal abilities and was not capable of hitting the <b>third</b> <b>octave,</b> the band decided to hire a new lead vocalist. Eventually, Marc Storace, formerly of TEA and Eazy Money, was hired in 1979. With the new line-up in place, the band recorded and released the album Metal Rendez-vous in 1980, which was Krokus' first hit and brought the band international recognition.|$|E

50|$|The piece {{suggests}} a peaceful country scene. It {{is said that}} Liszt got the idea of writing this étude while watching the scenery change during a train ride. The first section is played poco adagio with a sempre legato e placido indication at the start. There are gentle arpeggios and constant dynamic changes and syncopation, and the melody is often played in <b>thirds</b> or <b>octaves.</b>|$|R
50|$|Powers of 2 {{represent}} intervallic movements by octaves. Powers of 3 represent movements by {{intervals of}} perfect fifths (plus one octave, {{which can be}} removed by multiplying by 1/2, i.e., 2−1). Powers of 5 represent intervals of major <b>thirds</b> (plus two <b>octaves,</b> removable by multiplying by 1/4, i.e., 2−2). Thus, 5-limit tunings are constructed entirely from stacking of three basic purely-tuned intervals (<b>octaves,</b> <b>thirds</b> and fifths). Since the perception of consonance seems related to low numbers in the harmonic series, and 5-limit tuning relies on the three lowest primes, 5-limit tuning should be capable of producing very consonant harmonies. Hence, 5-limit tuning is considered a method for obtaining just intonation.|$|R
