Brahma agreed and he ordered Ganga {{to go down to}} the Earth and then on to the nether regions so that the souls of Bhagiratha's {{ancestors}} would be able <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>heaven.</b> Ganga felt that this was insulting and decided to sweep the whole Earth away as she fell from the heavens. Alarmed, Bhagiratha prayed to Shiva that he break up Ganga's descent.|$|E
2500|$|Galileo once stated [...] "The {{intention}} of the Holy Spirit is to teach us how <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>heaven,</b> not how the heavens go." [...] In 1981 [...] John Paul II, then pope of the Roman Catholic Church, spoke of the relationship this way: [...] "The Bible itself speaks to us {{of the origin of}} the universe and its make-up, not in order to provide us with a scientific treatise, but in order to state the correct relationships of man with God and with the universe. Sacred Scripture wishes simply to declare that the world was created by God, and in order to teach this truth it expresses itself in the terms of the cosmology in use {{at the time of the}} writer".|$|E

We must see their real, and not their imagined lives." [...] The depth of her spirituality, of which she said, [...] "my way is all confidence and love", has inspired many believers. In the face of her littleness she trusted in God to be her sanctity. She wanted <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>heaven</b> by an entirely new little way. [...] "I wanted to find an elevator that would raise me to Jesus". The elevator, she wrote, would be the arms of Jesus lifting her in all her littleness.|$|E

Men {{are said}} <b>to</b> <b>go</b> up <b>to</b> <b>heaven,</b> {{but they are}} said <b>to</b> <b>go</b> down <b>to</b> hell; up, because of exaltation, and because they must abound in beauty and glory that <b>go</b> <b>to</b> heaven; down, because of those sad dejections, that great {{deformity}} and vile contempt that sin hath brought them <b>to</b> that <b>go</b> <b>to</b> hell (Eze 32:18).|$|R
2500|$|Most Christians {{understand}} the soul as an ontological reality distinct from, yet integrally connected with, the body. Its characteristics {{are described in}} moral, spiritual, and philosophical terms. Richard Swinburne, a Christian philosopher of religion at Oxford University, wrote that [...] "it is a frequent criticism of substance dualism that dualists cannot say what souls are. Souls are immaterial subjects of mental properties. They have sensations and thoughts, desires and beliefs, and perform intentional actions. Souls are essential parts of human beings". According to a common Christian eschatology, when people die, their souls will be judged by God and determined <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>Heaven</b> or to Hell. Though all branches of Christianity – Catholics, Eastern Orthodox, Oriental Orthodox, Church of the East, Evangelical, and mainline Protestants – teach that Jesus Christ plays a decisive role in the Christian salvation process, the specifics of that role and the part played by individual persons or ecclesiastical rituals and relationships, {{is a matter of}} wide diversity in official church teaching, theological speculation and popular practice. Some Christians believe that if one has not repented of one's sins and has not trusted in Jesus Christ as Lord and Savior, he/she will go to Hell and suffer eternal damnation or eternal separation from God. Some hold a belief that babies (including the unborn) and those with cognitive or mental impairments who have died will be received into Heaven on the basis of God's grace through the sacrifice of Jesus.|$|E
2500|$|In 2011 {{she took}} part in the second season of Swedish reality TV show Så mycket bättre (So much better) on TV4. The show puts {{well-known}} Swedish musicians up against each other to create new interpretations of the other artists songs. She participated along with Timbuktu, Eva Dahlgren, Lena Philipsson, E-Type, Tomas Ledin and Mikael Wiehe and soon emerged as the favourite with her cover versions regularly topping the Swedish iTunes download charts and the official Sverigetopplistan downloads chart following the release of the weekly compilations of the week's covers from the show. Laleh's cover of Eva Dahlgren [...] "Ängeln I Rummet" [...] (Angel in the Room) reached number six on the official Swedish Singles Chart whilst topping the downloads chart in December 2011 to become her most successful song in Sweden to date in terms of peak chart position and until the release of [...] "Some Die Young" [...] sales too. Similarly her renditions of Tomas Ledin's [...] "Just Nu" [...] (Right Now) and Timbuktu's [...] "Alla vill till himmelen men ingen vill dö" [...] (Everyone wants <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>heaven</b> but nobody wants to die) peaked at number 25, whilst [...] "Here I Go Again" [...] peaked at number one on the digital chart. During the showings of Så mycket bättre, Laleh broke a Swedish digital chart record by having ten songs on the top sixty list, including nine inside the top 40, as a number of catalogue songs returned to the chart, including the first placement for [...] "Bjurö klubb". Additionally two interpretations of her songs by other artists appeared, bringing a total of twelve songs with her involvement in the chart at once. Tolkningarna (Interpretations), an extended play of all of the songs she performed on the show was released digitally on 25 December 2011 and was also bundled with the physical release of her following studio album.|$|E
