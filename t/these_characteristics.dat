5|$|Although each {{planet has}} unique {{physical}} characteristics, {{a number of}} broad commonalities do exist among them. Some of <b>these</b> <b>characteristics,</b> such as rings or natural satellites, have only as yet been observed in planets in the Solar System, whereas others are also commonly observed in extrasolar planets.|$|E

5|$|Alcoholism is characterised by an {{increased}} tolerance to alcohol–which means {{that an individual}} can consume more alcohol–and physical dependence on alcohol, which {{makes it hard for}} an individual to control their consumption. The physical dependency caused by alcohol can lead to an affected individual having a very strong urge to drink alcohol. <b>These</b> <b>characteristics</b> play a role decreasing an alcoholic's ability to stop drinking. Alcoholism can have adverse effects on mental health, causing psychiatric disorders and increasing the risk of suicide. A depressed mood is a common symptom of heavy alcohol drinkers.|$|E
5|$|Corn (USA), or maize (British English), is {{the second}} most {{palatable}} grain. It provides twice as much digestible energy as an equal volume of oats and is low in fiber. Because of <b>these</b> <b>characteristics,</b> it is easy to over-feed corn, causing obesity, so horses are seldom fed corn all by itself. Nutritionists caution horse owners that moldy corn is poisonous if fed to horses.|$|E
5|$|Eriophorum angustifolium, {{commonly}} known as common cottongrass or common cottonsedge, is a species of flowering plant in the sedge family Cyperaceae. Native to North America, North Asia, and Northern Europe, it grows on peat or acidic soils, in open wetland, heath or moorland. It begins to flower in April or May and, after fertilisation in early summer, the small, unremarkable brown and green flowers develop distinctive white bristle-like seed-heads that resemble tufts of cotton; combined with its ecological suitability to bog, <b>these</b> <b>characteristics</b> give rise to the plant's alternative name, bog cotton.|$|E

5|$|In North America, Suillus americanus has {{a similar}} appearance, but a more easterly distribution. It is {{associated}} with eastern white pine. Although some authors have tried {{to distinguish between the}} two with by using width of the stem, or by differences in fruit body colouration, it is acknowledged that <b>these</b> <b>characteristics</b> are variable, and depend on environmental factors. The phylogenetic analysis of Wu and colleagues (2000) suggests that the two taxa may be the same, although more samples from different geographical areas will be needed to verify this.|$|E
5|$|In the past, {{the species}} (when {{it was known}} as Calvatia utriformis) has been {{separated}} into three varieties (C.utriformis var. utriformis, C.utriformis var. hungarica and C.utriformis var. gruberi) based on differences in the ornamentation of the exoperidium (outer tissue layer of the wall, or peridium) and spores. However, a 1997 study of these characters revealed that the three varieties are not clearly demarcated. This study and others suggest that variations in the environmental conditions in which the specimens are grown can affect the development of <b>these</b> <b>characteristics.</b>|$|E
5|$|Like other jays, {{this species}} is likely {{extremely}} intelligent. Similar species {{are known to}} use ants to keep their feathers clean, store seeds and nuts for later consumption, and use their toes to hold food.

5|$|Males mature {{at around}} 15years of age, {{by which time}} they have fully descended {{testicles}} and can reproduce. However, they exhibit arrested development by not developing the distinctive cheek pads, pronounced throat pouches, long fur, or long-calls until they are between 15 and 20years old. The development of <b>these</b> <b>characteristics</b> depends largely on {{the absence of a}} resident male.|$|E
5|$|Since 2006, the Fe-Oxidizing Microbial Observatory (FeMO), {{funded by}} the National Science Foundation and Microbial Observatory Program, has led cruises to Lōʻihi {{investigate}} its microbiology every October. The first cruise, on the ship R/V Melville and exploiting the submersible JASON2, lasted from September 22 to October 9. These cruises study {{the large number of}} Fe-oxidizing bacteria that have colonized Lōʻihi. Lōʻihi's extensive vent system is characterized by a high concentration of CO2 and Iron, while being low in sulfide. <b>These</b> <b>characteristics</b> make a perfect environment for iron-oxidizing bacteria, called FeOB, to thrive in.|$|E

5|$|<b>These</b> <b>characteristics</b> {{are genetically}} {{inherited}} {{and has been}} interpreted as {{the early stages of}} the speciation process.

5|$|When {{originally}} described, Patagosaurus {{was identified}} as a relative of Cetiosaurus in the family Cetiosauridae. It can be distinguished from Cetiosaurus, a similar genus, by features of the ischium and vertebrae. Another genus also identified as a cetiosaurid by Bonaparte, Volkheimeria, was named in the same paper as Patagosaurus. Features uniting the genera were identified in the pelvic structure and vertebrae, specifically the caudal neural spines and the ilium and ischium. <b>These</b> <b>characteristics</b> show that the genera are more derived than Amygdalodon, yet more primitive than Haplocanthosaurus.|$|E
5|$|While <b>these</b> <b>characteristics</b> never occur all {{together}} in the same building, and none are unique to Sicilian Baroque, it is the coupling together which gives the Sicilian Baroque its distinctive air.
