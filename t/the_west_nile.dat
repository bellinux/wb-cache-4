5|$|Amin began {{recruiting}} {{members of}} Kakwa, Lugbara, South Sudanese, and {{other ethnic groups}} from <b>the</b> <b>West</b> <b>Nile</b> area bordering South Sudan. The South Sudanese had been residents in Uganda since the early 20th century, having come from South Sudan to serve the colonial army. Many African ethnic groups in northern Uganda inhabit both Uganda and South Sudan; allegations persist that Amin's army consisted mainly of South Sudanese soldiers.|$|E
5|$|Eventually a rift {{developed}} between Amin and Obote, {{exacerbated by the}} support Amin had built within the army by recruiting from <b>the</b> <b>West</b> <b>Nile</b> region, his involvement in operations to support the rebellion in southern Sudan and an attempt on Obote's life in 1969. In October 1970, Obote {{took control of the}} armed forces, reducing Amin from his months-old post of commander of all the armed forces to that of commander of the army.|$|E

5|$|The {{migration}} of birds also aids {{the movement of}} other species, including those of ectoparasites such as ticks and lice, which in turn may carry micro-organisms including those of concern to human health. Due to the global spread of avian influenza, bird migration has been studied as a possible mechanism of disease transmission, {{but it has been}} found not to present a special risk; import of pet and domestic birds is a greater threat. Some viruses that are maintained in birds without lethal effects, such as <b>the</b> <b>West</b> <b>Nile</b> Virus may however be spread by migrating birds. Birds may also have a role in the dispersal of propagules of plants and plankton.|$|E
5|$|The {{house sparrow}} is host {{to a huge}} number of parasites and diseases, and the effect of most is unknown. Ornithologist Ted R. Anderson listed thousands, noting that his list was incomplete. The {{commonly}} recorded bacterial pathogens of the house sparrow are often those common in humans, and include Salmonella and Escherichia coli. Salmonella is common in the house sparrow, and a comprehensive study of house sparrow disease found it in 13% of sparrows tested. Salmonella epidemics in the spring and winter can kill large numbers of sparrows. The house sparrow hosts avian pox and avian malaria, which it has spread to the native forest birds of Hawaii. Many of the diseases hosted by the house sparrow are also present in humans and domestic animals, for which the house sparrow acts as a reservoir host. Arboviruses such as <b>the</b> <b>West</b> <b>Nile</b> virus, which most commonly infect insects and mammals, survive winters in temperate areas by going dormant in birds such as the house sparrow. A few records indicate disease extirpating house sparrow populations, especially from Scottish islands, but this seems to be rare.|$|E

50|$|The Faiyum Oasis (واحة الفيوم Waḥet El Fayyum) is a {{depression}} or basin {{in the desert}} immediately to <b>the</b> <b>west</b> of <b>the</b> <b>Nile</b> south of Cairo. The extent of the basin area is estimated at between 1,270 km² (490 mi²) and 1700 km² (656 mi²). The basin floor comprises fields watered by a channel of the Nile, the Bahr Yussef, as it drains into a desert depression to <b>the</b> <b>west</b> of <b>the</b> <b>Nile</b> Valley. The Bahr Yussef veers west through a narrow neck of land north of Ihnasya, between the archaeological sites of El Lahun and Gurob near Hawara; it then branches out, providing rich agricultural land in the Faiyum basin, draining into the large saltwater Lake Moeris (Birket Qarun). The lake was freshwater in prehistory but is today a saltwater lake. It is a source for tilapia and other fish for the local area.|$|R
40|$|A {{total of}} 698 blood and serum {{specimens}} from residents of 13 Iranian communities were examined by plaque reduction neutralization test for antibodies to West Nile virus. In general, infection {{rates in the}} north of the country were low while higher rates were observed among residents of central and southwestern Iran. The highest prevalence of infection was found among residents of Khuzestan province, indicating that this region is one of endemic West Nile virus activity. <b>The</b> symptoms of <b>west</b> <b>Nile</b> virus infection in man are also discussed...|$|R

50|$|The funeral {{procession}} carrying the pharaoh’s mummy began {{east of the}} Nile River, where the sun is reborn every morning and where the Egyptian citizens live. Khafre’s mummy would have crossed the Nile River, which was the ribbon of life separating the east from <b>the</b> <b>west.</b> <b>The</b> <b>Nile</b> was extremely important in Egyptian culture, for it provided fertility {{of the land and}} represented life for the people who used it. Because of its importance and symbol of life, it was used as part of the procession to bury the pharaoh. Khafre’s body would then meet at <b>the</b> <b>west</b> side of <b>the</b> <b>Nile,</b> or the land of the dead. Every night, the sun sets and dies, which is why the western section of the city was dedicated to burying the dead. The horizontal axis of east to west was symbolic to the Egyptians, representing the cycle of life and eternalness of their leaders; every day the sun is born in the east and dies at night in <b>the</b> <b>west,</b> yet is again reborn in the east the next morning. The rhythm of the horizontal axis used in the {{funeral procession}} parallels with eternalness of the pharaoh.|$|R
5000|$|The tombs {{were located}} on <b>the</b> <b>Nile's</b> <b>west</b> bank of western Thebes.

50|$|The {{topographic}} {{features of}} the desert region east of the Nile differ from those to <b>the</b> <b>west</b> of <b>the</b> <b>Nile.</b> The Eastern Desert is relatively mountainous. The elevation rises abruptly from the Nile, and a downward-sloping plateau of sand gives way within 100 km to arid, defoliated, rocky hills running north and south between the Sudan border and the Delta. The hills reach elevations of more than 1,900 m.|$|R
25|$|Corvids are {{reservoirs}} (carriers) for <b>the</b> <b>West</b> <b>Nile</b> {{virus in}} the United States. They are infected by mosquitoes (the vectors), primarily of the Culex species. Crows and ravens are quickly killed by this disease, so their deaths are an early-warning system when West Nile virus arrives {{in an area}} (as are horse and other bird species deaths). One of the first signs that West Nile virus first arrived in the US in 1999 was the death of crows in New York.|$|E
25|$|Biological hazards (biohazards) include {{infectious}} microorganisms such as {{viruses and}} toxins produced by those organisms such as anthrax. Biohazards affect workers in many industries; influenza, for example, affects a broad population of workers. Outdoor workers, including farmers, landscapers, and construction workers, risk exposure to numerous biohazards, including animal bites and stings, urushiol from poisonous plants, and diseases transmitted through {{animals such as}} <b>the</b> <b>West</b> <b>Nile</b> virus and Lyme disease. Health care workers, including veterinary health workers, risk exposure to blood-borne pathogens and various infectious diseases, especially those that are emerging.|$|E
25|$|Flaviviruses {{constitute}} {{a family of}} linear, single-stranded RNA(+) viruses. Flaviviruses include <b>the</b> <b>West</b> <b>Nile</b> virus, dengue virus, Tick-borne Encephalitis Virus, Yellow Fever Virus, and several other viruses. Many flavivirus species can replicate in both mammalian and insect cells. Most flaviviruses are arthropod borne and multiply in both vertebrates and arthropods. The viruses in this family that are of veterinary importance include Japanese encephalitis virus, St. Louis encephalitis virus, West Nile virus, Israel turkey meningoencephalomyelitis virus, Sitiawan virus, Wesselsbron virus, yellow fever virus and the tick-borne flaviviruses e.g. louping ill virus.|$|E
50|$|The present Nile is {{at least}} the fifth river that has flowed north from the Ethiopian Highlands. Satellite imagery was used to {{identify}} dry watercourses in the desert to <b>the</b> <b>west</b> of <b>the</b> <b>Nile.</b> An Eonile canyon, now filled by surface drift, represents an ancestral Nile called the Eonile that flowed during the later Miocene (23-5.3 million years before present). The Eonile transported clastic sediments to the Mediterranean; several natural gas fields have been discovered within these sediments.|$|R

This location is about 3.6 km, by road, from the central business district of Jinja. The coordinates of Kimaka are:0°27'01.0"N, 33°11'30.0"E (Latitude:0.450278; Longitude:33.191667).|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>west</b> side of <b>Nile</b> Street {{was made}} up of No. 1 Nelson Place on the south end and No. 1 St Georges Place on the north end, with No. 4 Nile Street between these two houses. There was a gap next to No. 1 Nelson Place due to the garden at the rear of this house. No. 4 Nile Street and No. 1 St Georges Place were not on Richard Bowsher's land and they were built in the early 19th century.|$|R
25|$|Ae. albopictus also bites {{other mammals}} besides humans, {{as well as}} birds. The females are always on {{the search for a}} host and are {{persistent}} but cautious {{when it comes to their}} blood meal and host location. Their blood meal is often broken off before enough blood has been ingested for the development of their eggs, so Asian tiger mosquitoes bite multiple hosts during their development cycle of the egg, making them particularly efficient at transmitting diseases. The mannerism of biting diverse host species enables the Asian tiger mosquito to be a potential bridge vector for certain pathogens that can jump species boundaries, for example <b>the</b> <b>West</b> <b>Nile</b> virus.|$|E
25|$|After the juveniles fledge, {{the family}} travels and forages {{together}} until early fall, {{when the young}} birds disperse to avoid competition for food during the winter. Sexual maturity is reached after one year of age. Blue jays have been recorded to live for more than 26 years in captivity and one wild jay {{was found to have}} been around 17 and a half years old. A more common lifespan for wild birds that survive to adulthood is around 7 years. Beyond predation and the occasional collision with man-made objects, a common cause of mortality in recent decades has been <b>the</b> <b>West</b> <b>Nile</b> Virus, which corvids as a whole seem especially susceptible to. However, despite several major local declines, overall blue jays have not seemed to have been depleted by the disease.|$|E
25|$|JEV is a {{virus from}} the family Flaviviridae, part of the Japanese {{encephalitis}} serocomplex of 9 genetically and antigenically related viruses, some which are particularly severe in horses, and four known to infect humans including West Nile virus. The enveloped virus {{is closely related to}} <b>the</b> <b>West</b> <b>Nile</b> virus and the St. Louis encephalitis virus. The positive sense single-stranded RNA genome is packaged in the capsid which is formed by the capsid protein. The outer envelope is formed by envelope protein and is the protective antigen. It aids in entry of the virus into the inside of the cell. The genome also encodes several nonstructural proteins (NS1, NS2a, NS2b, NS3, N4a, NS4b, NS5). NS1 is produced as secretory form also. NS3 is a putative helicase, and NS5 is the viral polymerase. It has been noted that Japanese encephalitis infects the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and rapidly accumulates substantial amounts of viral proteins for the Japanese Encephalitis.|$|E
