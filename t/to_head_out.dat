5|$|Rosberg {{was again}} fastest {{in the second}} session on Friday afternoon, setting his fastest time of 1:07.967 in the early minutes. This {{benchmark}} would stand {{for the rest of}} the session as heavy rain arrived at the circuit eight minutes in. Several drivers slid off the track as they tried to return to the pitlane, where they would remain for half an hour until the rain eased off. Ricciardo was the first <b>to</b> <b>head</b> <b>out</b> again on the intermediate tyres, slowly followed by the rest of the field. With under twenty minutes remaining, the track had dried out enough to use slick tyres. Behind Rosberg and Hamilton, Nico HÃ¼lkenberg set the third-fastest time, ahead of Vettel, who spun out into the gravel trap in turn 2 late in the session.|$|E
5|$|Stephen Decatur assumed {{command of}} President in December 1814, {{planning}} a cruise to the West Indies to prey on British shipping. In mid-January 1815, a snowy gale with strong winds forced the British blockading squadron away from New York Harbor, giving Decatur {{the opportunity to}} put to sea. On the evening of 14January, President headed out of the harbor but ran aground, the result of harbor pilots incorrectly marking a safe passage. Stranded on the sand bar, President lifted and dropped with the incoming tide. Within two hours her hull had been damaged, her timbers twisted, and masts sprung. Damage to her keel caused the ship to hog and sag. Decatur {{was finally able to}} float President off the bar and, assessing the damage, he decided to return to New York for repairs; however, the wind direction was not favorable and President was forced <b>to</b> <b>head</b> <b>out</b> to sea.|$|E

The group had been noticed by Johnny Mercer's Capitol Records, and convinced Laine <b>to</b> <b>head</b> <b>out</b> to Hollywood with them as their agent.|$|E
25|$|Immersion of {{the human}} body in water has effects on the circulation, renal system and fluid balance, and breathing, which are caused by the {{external}} hydrostatic pressure of the water providing support against the internal hydrostatic pressure of the blood. This causes a blood shift from the extravascular tissues of the limbs into the chest cavity, and fluid losses known as immersion diuresis compensate for the blood shift in hydrated subjects soon after immersion. Hydrostatic pressure on the body due <b>to</b> <b>head</b> <b>out</b> immersion causes negative pressure breathing which contributes to the blood shift.|$|E
25|$|Several {{times he}} {{prepared}} <b>to</b> <b>head</b> <b>out,</b> {{but each time}} was detained by the threats of his enemies in Piedmont or by economic restraints which compelled him to mortgage his marquisate to Frederick II. Finally, he cowed some cities into giving him aid in men. Nevertheless, he was present at Capua, Ferentino, and Sora with Frederick II in February 1223. Delayed again and again, he drank a toast at Brindisi to his setting off in 1225, but he fell ill at the last minute. His fleet remained in port until Spring 1226, when, under urging from Honorius, it finally cast off. The delays had been fatal and William himself died at Almyros on 17 September.

Instead, they simply complied with the instruction, which ATC took as confirmation that the flight had indeed been hijacked. Worried that a possible hijacked plane might strike a target in Alaska, Governor Tony Knowles ordered the evacuation of large hotels and government buildings in Anchorage. At nearby Valdez, (also in Alaska), the U.S. Coast Guard ordered all tankers filling up with oil <b>to</b> <b>head</b> <b>out</b> to sea. Lt. Gen.

25|$|Liquid {{reveals that}} he plans to destroy the Patriots' core AI with a nuclear strike using Metal Gear REX's railgun, and that he will {{substitute}} the core with his own to gain control. To facilitate his plan, Liquid needs a non ID-tagged nuclear warhead, which is to be recovered from the Shadow Moses facility, familiar to Snake from prior adventures. Snake, tormented by old memories, infiltrates Shadow Moses Island and reaches REX's hangar only to be ambushed by Vamp who has Naomi with him. Raiden assists Snake in battling Vamp and ultimately kills him. Naomi, revealing she is riddled with cancer and tormented by her mistakes, disables her nanomachines holding off the cancer and dies. Snake and Raiden use REX <b>to</b> <b>head</b> <b>out</b> of the hangar and battle Metal Gear RAY, piloted by Liquid. Upon his defeat, Liquid reveals Outer Haven, a modified version of Arsenal Gear ready to fulfill his launch plan. Raiden is severely injured during the attack while defending Snake. The , captained by Mei Ling, arrives and begins firing on Haven, causing it to retreat. Seizing the moment it surfaces to launch the nuke, Snake, Meryl, and Johnny board the ship via catapults. When Snake arrives at the core, he uses Otacon's robot to install a computer virus coded by Naomi and Sunny, that destroys the core AI and the Patriot system controlling the entire world, leaving the bare necessity for the modern civilization to survive. The destruction of the Patriots brings the war economy to a halt, counteracts the Patriots' upcoming civilian control scheme, and causes a mental breakdown for the enemy soldiers as their mind-control systems are disabled. Snake, after passing out in the core room, awakes atop Outer Haven's tower to find Liquid. Liquid reveals to Snake that his plan the whole time was to have Snake himself defeat the Patriots while Liquid draw their attention to himself. Liquid also reveals to Snake that Eva died because of the FOXDIE virus Snake is carrying. The two engage in a tough and emotional battle, with Snake coming up on top. After telling Snake a few last words, Liquid dies from the Foxdie virus as well.|$|E

[...] Roger Moore of the Orlando Sentinel gave the film three out of five stars, saying [...] "It's beautiful to look at. The talking cars feel more alive than talking cars should." [...] Peter Howell of the Toronto Star gave the film three out of four stars, saying [...] "Cars made me want to hop in my jalopy and <b>to</b> <b>head</b> <b>out</b> to Route 66, bypassing the boring interstate highways that made the Mother Road redundant." [...] Moira MacDonald of The Seattle Times gave the film three and a half stars out of four, saying [...] "Though the central idea of nostalgia for a quieter, small-town life may well be lost on this movie's young audience -- Cars finds a pleasant and often sparkling groove." [...] Mick LaSalle of the San Francisco Chronicle gave the film two out of five stars, saying [...] "Cars might get us into car world as a gimmick, but it doesn't get us into car world as a state of mind. Thus, the animation, rather than seeming like an expression of the movie's deeper truth, becomes an impediment to it." [...] Derek Adams of Time Out gave the film a positive review, saying [...] "There are many other brilliant scenes, some just as funny but there are just as many occasions where you feel the film's struggling to fire on all cylinders. Still, it's a Pixar film, right? And they're always worth a gander no matter what anyone says." ...|$|E
