50|$|Thickening {{agents are}} added to {{maintain}} the sparkling particles in suspension while in the bottle. A typical thickener is stearalkonium hectorite. Thickening agents exhibit <b>thixotropy,</b> their solutions are viscous when still but free flowing when agitated.

50|$|Rheopecty or {{rheopexy}} is {{the rare}} property of some non-Newtonian fluids {{to show a}} time-dependent increase in viscosity (time-dependent viscosity); the longer the fluid undergoes shearing force, the higher its viscosity. Rheopectic fluids, such as some lubricants, thicken or solidify when shaken. The opposite and much more common type of behaviour, in which fluids become less viscous the longer they undergo shear, is called <b>thixotropy.</b>|$|E
50|$|<b>Thixotropy</b> {{has been}} {{proposed}} as a scientific explanation of blood liquefaction miracles {{such as that of}} Saint Januarius in Naples.Semi-solid casting processes such as thixomoulding use the thixotropic property of some alloys (mostly light metals) (bismuth). Within certain temperature ranges, with appropriate preparation, an alloy can be put into a semi-solid state, which can be injected with less shrinkage and better overall properties than by normal injection molding.|$|E
50|$|In rheology, shear {{thinning}} is the non-Newtonian behavior of fluids whose viscosity decreases under shear strain. It is sometimes considered synonymous for pseudoplastic behaviour, {{and is usually}} defined as excluding time-dependent effects, such as <b>thixotropy.</b> Shear-thinning behaviour is generally not seen in pure liquids with low molecular mass, or ideal solutions of small molecules like sucrose or sodium chloride, but is often seen in polymer solutions and molten polymers, and complex fluids and suspensions like ketchup, whipped cream, blood, paint, and nail polish.|$|E
50|$|Guar gum shows a clear low shear plateau on {{the flow}} curve and is {{strongly}} shear thinning. The rheology of guar gum is typical for a random coil polymer. It {{does not show}} the very high low shear plateau viscosities seen with more rigid polymer chains such as xanthan gum. It is very thixotropic above 1% concentration, but below 0.3%, the <b>thixotropy</b> is slight. Guar gum shows viscosity synergy with xanthan gum. Guar gum and micellar casein mixtures can be slightly thixotropic if a biphase system forms.|$|E
50|$|Semi-solid {{metal casting}} (SSM) is a near net shape variant of die casting. The process is used with {{non-ferrous}} metals, such as aluminium, copper, and magnesium. The process combines {{the advantages of}} casting and forging. The process is named after the fluid property <b>thixotropy,</b> which is the phenomenon that allows this process to work. Simply, thixotropic fluids shear when the material flows, but thicken when standing. The potential {{for this type of}} process was first recognized in the early 1970s. There are four different processes: thixocasting, rheocasting, thixomolding, and SIMA.|$|E
50|$|The first {{widespread}} use of a composite armour {{appears to have been}} on the Soviet T-64. It used an armour known as Combination K, which apparently is glass-reinforced plastic sandwiched between inner and outer steel layers. Through a mechanism called <b>thixotropy,</b> the resin changes to a fluid under constant pressure, allowing the armour to be moulded into curved shapes. Later models of the T-64, along with newer designs, used a boron carbide-filled resin aggregate for greatly improved protection. The Soviets also invested heavily in reactive armour, which allowed them some ability to control quality, even after production.|$|E

5000|$|The {{specific}} {{cause of}} the collapse was a build-up {{of water in the}} pile; when a small rotational slip occurred, the disturbance caused the saturated, fine material of the tip to liquefy (<b>thixotropy)</b> and flow down the mountain. Although it was estimated that tailings constituted about 10% of the tip {{at the time of the}} disaster, the inquiry concluded that they were not a contributory factor in the fatal slide: [...] "Owing to the geological and geographical features and the size of the tip, the expert evidence is that there would have been a major slide even had no tailings been placed on it." ...|$|E
5000|$|Where it is {{important}} that either the form or the concentration of the emulsion should be stable, it is desirable that the continuous and the dispersed phases should have similar densities, and it also is desirable that the continuous phase should be viscous or thixotropic. <b>Thixotropy</b> is particularly valuable in paints, sauces, and similar products, partly because it counteracts tendencies towards creaming. It also {{is important}} that the particles be as small as practicable because that reduces their tendency to migrate under the influence of buoyant forces. The electric charges on their surfaces should preferably tend to be uniform, so that the particles repel rather than attract each other.|$|E
50|$|Rheology {{generally}} {{accounts for}} the behavior of non-Newtonian fluids, by characterizing the minimum number of functions that are needed to relate stresses with rate of change of strain or strain rates. For example, ketchup can have its viscosity reduced by shaking (or other forms of mechanical agitation, where the relative movement of different layers in the material actually causes the reduction in viscosity) but water cannot. Ketchup is a shear thinning material, like yogurt and emulsion paint (US terminology latex paint or acrylic paint), exhibiting <b>thixotropy,</b> where an increase in relative flow velocity will cause a reduction in viscosity, for example, by stirring. Some other non-Newtonian materials show the opposite behavior, rheopecty: viscosity going up with relative deformation, and are called shear thickening or dilatant materials. Since Sir Isaac Newton originated the concept of viscosity, the study of liquids with strain rate dependent viscosity is also often called Non-Newtonian fluid mechanics.|$|E
50|$|<b>Thixotropy</b> is a {{time-dependent}} {{shear thinning}} property. Certain gels or fluids that are thick, or viscous, under static conditions will flow (become thin, less viscous) over time when shaken, agitated, sheared or otherwise stressed (time dependent viscosity). They {{then take a}} fixed time {{to return to a}} more viscous state.In other words: some non-Newtonian pseudoplastic fluids show a time-dependent change in viscosity; the longer the fluid undergoes shear stress, the lower its viscosity. A thixotropic fluid is a fluid which takes a finite time to attain equilibrium viscosity when introduced to a steep change in shear rate. Some thixotropic fluids return to a gel state almost instantly, such as ketchup, and are called pseudoplastic fluids. Others such as yogurt take much longer and can become nearly solid. Many gels and colloids are thixotropic materials, exhibiting a stable form at rest but becoming fluid when agitated.|$|E
50|$|Most commonly, in a non-Newtonian fluid, the {{viscosity}} (the {{measure of}} a fluid's ability to resist gradual deformation by shear or tensile stresses) of the fluids is dependent on shear rate or shear rate history (time). These shear-thickening fluids are divided into two groups: time dependent and time-independent viscosity. In the case of time dependent viscosity, the apparent viscosity of a fluid changes with time as the fluid is continuously sheared. They can be termed as memory materials. If the apparent viscosity decreases with time, the fluid is called thixotropic and if it increases with time, it is called rheopectic. Thixotropic behaviour {{is the result of}} a break down in the microstructure of the material as shearing continues. This happens when the shear is exceeded of a limit. It leads to non-linear stress-strain behaviour. <b>Thixotropy</b> can be associated with the effect of bubbles. Examples of these types of fluids are gelatine, shortening, cream, paints, yogurt, xanthan gum solutions, aqueous iron oxide gels, gelatine gels, pectin gels, synovial fluid, hydrogenated castor oil, some clays (including bentonite, and montmorillonite), carbon black suspension in molten tire rubber, some drilling muds, many paints, many floc suspensions, and many colloidal suspensions. In the case of rheopatic fluids, the structure builds as shearing continues. Rheopectic behaviour may be described as time-dependent dilatant behaviour. This type of behaviour is much less common but can occur in highly concentrated starch solutions over long periods of time. Shear induced crystallization may be responsible for rheopatic behaviour. Other examples are gypsum pastes and printer inks.|$|E

The following methods were used to assess the yield stress: a low-rotation T-bar test, a shear stress sweep, a shear rate sweep, an oscillatory stress sweep and an immersion/de-immersion test on the texture analyser. The level of <b>thixotropy</b> was assessed by: a hysteresis loop test, a three-step <b>thixotropy</b> test and a repeated immersion/de-immersion test.

40|$|In this thesis, {{effects of}} clay addition, clay replacement, and cement types on {{thixotropic}} behavior of cement-based materials are investigated. <b>Thixotropy</b> is {{the property of}} certain fluid materials that are thick or viscous under normal conditions but flow or become less viscous over time when shaken, agitated, or otherwise stressed. Freshly-mixed cement pastes are thixotropic materials, which become fluid when agitated but restore its structural form at rest. This is because cement pastes experience microstructure change with time due to the particles flocculation and cement hydration. The thixotropic behavior of cement-based materials {{is important in the}} modern concrete construction. Shape stability of concrete mixtures is often required for shotcrete and slip form construction so that the concrete mixture can adhere to the substrates or hold the shape right after casting and without support from formwork. Quick structural restore, or high <b>thixotropy,</b> of concrete can reduce formwork pressure in construction. Clay additions or replacement for cement often enhance concrete <b>thixotropy</b> and increase concrete shape stability. In the present study, the typical hysteresis loop rheology test method is employed to evaluate <b>thixotropy</b> of various cement pastes. The pastes were made with different types of cement and with /without clay addition/replacement. The types of cement used are Ashgrove Type I, Lafarge Type I/II, Type IV, and High Alkali Type I cement. The clay materials studied are Actigel, High Reactivity Metakaolin, and Ground Clay Brick. The rheology tests were performed at 0, 15, 30, 45, 60, and 75 minutes right after each paste was mixed. The rates of <b>thixotropy</b> change with time were analyzed for each mixture. The standard flow table tests (ASTM C 230) were also conducted and the results were correlated with the rheological results. The rate of heat evolution of each paste studied is measured. The results indicate that clay addition and/or replacement for cement accelerates the rate of <b>thixotropy</b> change. The pastes made with different types of cement have different <b>thixotropy</b> changing rate. High Alkali cement has the highest <b>thixotropy</b> changing rate while both of Type IV and Ashgrove Type I cement have a lower <b>thixotropy</b> changing rate. There is a clear relationship between <b>thixotropy</b> and flow test results. The faster the increasing rate of <b>thixotropy,</b> the faster the decreasing rate of flow can be expected. The rate of heat generation can be correlated with <b>thixotropy</b> increasing rate...|$|E

40|$|International audienceAn {{experimental}} {{investigation was}} carried out to {{determine the influence of}} <b>thixotropy</b> on the development of formwork lateral pressure. Five self-consolidating concrete (SCC) mixtures prepared with different combinations of cementitious materials and two flowable mixtures of different stability levels were evaluated. This article seeks to quantify the <b>thixotropy</b> of fresh concrete by evaluating the variations in yield stress and the evolution of the structural breakdown curves. Changes to the impeller of a modified Tattersall concrete rheometer are proposed for the protocol used to assess <b>thixotropy.</b> Instead of the H-shaped impeller that rotates in a planetary motion, a four-bladed vane impeller rotating coaxially around the main shaft was used. This resulted in less slip flow of fresh concrete and an increase in the sheared surface during rotation. Test results show that <b>thixotropy</b> is not an inherent property of SCC of a given slump flow consistency of 650 ± 10 mm. The concrete exhibits a high degree of <b>thixotropy</b> when proportioned with ternary cement containing 6 % silica fume and 22 % fly ash compared with similar concrete made with 4 % silica fume and no fly ash. The incorporation of set-accelerating and set-retarding agents resulted in greater and lower degrees of <b>thixotropy,</b> respectively.

40|$|Abstract: <b>Thixotropy</b> is {{the most}} {{important}} characteristic of semi-solid materials, and it is decided by the variation of microstructure during action of handling. In this paper, {{for the sake of the}} industrial thixoforming and numerical simulation, microstructure and stress variation of semisolid magnesium alloys during isothermal compression is researched. Here, samples are heated to the desired temperature in the empty space with various holding times and compressed horizontally. Stress–strain curves during compression can be given directly by the experimental computer, and each of curves show a peak stress in a small strain and then decrease rapidly, which originally because of the <b>thixotropy</b> of semisolid materials. Moreover, <b>thixotropy</b> of semisolid magnesium alloys is clearer with the evolution of microstructures including agglomeration and deagglomeration of solid particles and the moving way of liquid at different places and strain under different conditions. Microstructures during isothermal compression show that the deagglomeration of solid particles increase with increasing the strain rate, therefore, the <b>thixotropy</b> of semisolid magnesium alloys increases. However, when solid volume fractions are lower, the agglomeration of solid particles doesn’t change obviously with increase or decrease factors, meaning that the <b>thixotropy</b> is smaller. Relationships between <b>thixotropy</b> and microstructure at other different conditions are also given according to the experiments and analysis. 1...|$|E

40|$|International audienceAn {{experimental}} {{investigation was}} carried out to {{determine the influence of}} <b>thixotropy</b> on the development of formwork lateral pressure. Five self-consolidating concrete (SCC) mixtures prepared with different combinations of cementitious materials and set-modifying admixtures were evaluated. An experimental column measuring 2100 mm in height and 200 mm in diameter was used to determine lateral pressure distribution using five pressure sensors mounted at 50, 250, 450, 850, and 1250 mm from the base. This paper offers a comprehensive review of key factors affecting formwork pressure developed by fresh concrete and presents the results pertaining to the influence of <b>thixotropy</b> on variations in lateral pressure of SCC. The results show that the lateral pressure exerted by the plastic SCC is directly related to <b>thixotropy.</b> With the increase in <b>thixotropy,</b> the initial lateral pressure registered following casting decreases, and the rate of drop in lateral pressure is accelerated. This is attributed to the reversible effect of the <b>thixotropy</b> which enables the material to regain its shear strength, internal friction, and cohesion when left at rest without any shearing action. Immediately after casting, any decrease in lateral pressure was attributed to the increased internal friction resulting from the use of ternary cement and greater concentration of coarse aggregate. The use of a set-retarding agent resulted in a delay in cement hydration that led to a slower rate of drop in lateral pressure. Conversely, the incorporation of a set-accelerating agent resulted in an increase in the rate of pressure drop...|$|E
40|$|Studying {{the flow}} of fresh {{concrete}} is influenced by time dependency of the rheological properties of the concrete. This time dependency {{can be divided into}} two parts : the non-reversible part, being loss of workability and the reversible part, called <b>thixotropy.</b> Loss of workability can be neglected in some cases, when comparing with the effect of <b>thixotropy,</b> but it is advised to keep track of it, especially in case of SCC for precast industry. Several {{attempts have been made to}} characterize the thixotropic properties of concrete, but no general test procedure is known at this moment to universally describe <b>thixotropy.</b> In most cases, the study of the thixotropic properties is restricted to the area of interest of the authors, mostly the variation of static yield stress. Only one theory takes into account the influence of <b>thixotropy</b> on both viscosity and yield stress : the Hattori-Izumi theory, modified by J. E. Wallevik.

40|$|The {{viscosity}} of starch-thickened foods {{is critical}} in managing dysphagia (impaired swallowing). These fluids are highly non-Newtonian and exhibit thixotropic behaviour. The <b>thixotropy</b> of the starch-based thickeners {{that are used to}} achieve this critical viscosity is presented. Two types of thickeners were evaluated; maize-based and maltodextrin-based. The <b>thixotropy</b> of these thickeners proved to be complex and the behaviour could be toggled between <b>thixotropy</b> and rheopexy by changing certain variables. The sol to gel transition favours low or zero shear rates when the initial viscosity is low (low starch concentration), but shearing is preferred for structure formation of high viscosity (concentrated) samples. This is likely to be due to Brownian motion being restricted in thicker samples due to less solvent between starch molecules. This may also cause starch granules to be sheared open causing more amylose to enter the viscous matrix...|$|E
40|$|Length {{changes of}} muscle fibers have {{previously}} {{been shown to}} result in a temporary reduction in fiber stiffness that is referred to as <b>thixotropy.</b> Understanding the mechanism of this <b>thixotropy</b> is important to our understanding of muscle function since there are many instances in which muscle is subjected to repeated patterns of lengthening and shortening. By applying sinusoidal length changes to one end of single permeabilized muscle fibers and measuring the force response at the opposite end, we studied the history-dependent stiffness of both relaxed and activated muscle fibers. For length change oscillations greater than 1 Hz, we observed thixotropic behavior of activated fibers. Treatment of these fibers with EDTA and blebbistatin, which inhibits myosin-actin interactions, quashed this effect, suggesting that the mechanism of muscle fiber <b>thixotropy</b> is cross-bridge dependent. We modeled a half-sarcomere experiencing sinusoidal length changes, and our simulations suggest that <b>thixotropy</b> could arise from force-dependent cross-bridge kinetics. Surprisingly, we also observed that, for length change oscillations less than 1 Hz, the muscle fiber exhibited rheopexy. In other words, the stiffness of the fiber increased in response to the length changes. Blebbistatin and EDTA did not disrupt the rheopectic behavior, suggesting that a non-cross-bridge mechanism contributes to this phenomenon...|$|E

The rheology of a foam can be altered by how the air bubbles inside are organized, its size and shape, allowing a product that was initially fluid to be molded, like marshmallow. Rheology makes possible to understand how these properties are affected using dynamic oscillatory measurements to evaluate the behavior through G` and G `, and rotational to characterize the product through stress, and viscosity curves under controlled shear stress. These two methodologies combined are useful to analyze <b>thixotropy.</b> Nine formulations containing albumin and gelatin, and five others containing guar gum were evaluated by oscillatory rheology focusing <b>thixotropy</b> determination.
