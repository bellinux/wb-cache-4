25|$|Captain John G. Foster, a Union Army {{engineering}} officer observing from Fort Sumter, wrote {{reports to}} his superiors {{about the progress}} of the battery construction. Foster's assessment of the battery was dismissive, “...I <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> destroyed by our fire before it has time to do much damage...” and he followed a few days later with, “...I do not think this floating battery will prove very formidable...” Nonetheless, his superior, Major Robert Anderson was apprehensive enough that he inquired for specific instructions from Washington regarding the threat of the battery. He was instructed that if he became convinced that the battery was advanced for the purpose of immediate attack then he would be justified in firing on it but if it was only being moved for the purposes of general emplacement that he should exercise forbearance.|$|E
500|$|Spanish {{critic and}} philosopher Miguel de Unamuno {{comments}} of the book, [...] "I never took Facundo by Sarmiento {{as a historical}} work, nor do I <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> very valued in that regard. I always {{thought of it as}} a literary work, as a historical novel". However, Facundo cannot be classified as a novel or a specific genre of literature. According to González Echevarría, the book is at once an [...] "essay, biography, autobiography, novel, epic, memoir, confession, political pamphlet, diatribe, scientific treatise, [...] travelogue". Sarmiento's style and his exploration of the life of Facundo unify the three distinct parts of his work. Even the first section, describing Argentina's geography, follows this pattern, since Sarmiento contends that Facundo is a natural product of this environment.|$|E
500|$|In 1996, Woody Harrelson was {{attached}} to the film to play Ron Woodroof, but left the film because of financing issues. In 2002, Brad Pitt {{was attached}} to play the lead role. In June 2008, Ryan Gosling was in talks to join the film for the lead role to play Woodroof, but couldn't take the role. In 2009, producer Brenner sent the script to actor Matthew McConaughey and got him involved to star in the film. Wondering whether the Texas native was interested in playing another Texas native (he's originally from Uvalde), Brenner says that he asked himself: Who is Ron Woodroof?' And in my mind, it was Matthew. Like Ron, he's from Dallas, he's handsome, and he has a twinkle in the eye. Matthew also has intensity and intelligence like Ron did, mixed with that cowboy charisma and fighter's spirit. He was beyond perfect for the role." [...] Writer Borten said: [...] "Ron was a very charismatic, funny and persuasive, a real salesman. Even if he was making fun of you, you wanted him to continue because he was so charming. Matthew possesses a lot of those same qualities." [...] On March 9, 2011, Los Angeles Times confirmed that McConaughey would star in the film as Woodroof and quoted McConaughey as saying: [...] "It's a great script and a great story. And I <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> a great movie." [...] Woodroof's sister Sharon Woodroof Braden was reportedly pleased with the casting of McConaughey as Woodroof because he had a similar swagger and personality. She had shown concern earlier in the development process when Pitt and Gosling were attached, due to their personalities not matching Woodroof's.|$|E

50|$|The current RITS scheme {{can handle}} UAVs {{weighing}} up to 180 kg, but AATI <b>thinks</b> <b>it</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> scaled up to handle larger aircraft.

Whether the Coast Guard intends to use this scheme or not is uncertain, but it certainly is an interesting concept.|$|R
500|$|Rainie's {{relationship}} with Phil Mitchell (McFadden) was first explored during her stint in 2010. Rainie and Phil {{were to be}} involved in a storyline involving the taking of crack cocaine. Discussing her return in 2010, she said she was pleased to be working closely with McFadden as they had not worked together. Franks explained that after being thrown out of the house by Tanya's ex-husband Max, and moving in with Phil that, [...] "it gets quite dark and dirty, really. Phil and Rainie are two people who meet at a point in their lives where they both see something equivalent in each other. He offers her something that she wants, and that is a place to be, while she has something that he wants, and that's drugs—so it's a match at that time." [...] Franks was given advice from the charity DrugScope on how to act the part and also undertook some of her own research, and she said she believed the scenes to be very realistic. She wanted the drugs storyline to help people, saying, [...] "If {{there are people who have}} a drugs problem, or an addiction problem of any kind really, they might watch something like this and it could trigger something in their mind that is relevant to them, or someone that they know. Hopefully it could make people think twice about carrying on with that, and perhaps look into getting some help. The organisation that we worked with, DrugScope, gives a lot of help and advice for people with drug addictions. I <b>think</b> <b>it</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> hugely helpful when a show as popular as EastEnders does something like this." [...] She also stated that if EastEnders [...] "has saved one life by putting this story out it's been worth it. The whole point of soaps is to reflect a certain amount of everyday life. Some of it is going to be light entertainment, some isn't." ...|$|E

[...] It is also {{said to have been}} {{strongly}} influenced by his new girlfriend, Ulla Munch, from Vanløse in Copenhagen, Denmark. The album also emphasized the distance Morrison had moved away from R and was inspired by Irish music. He commented at the time, [...] "It's important for people to get into the music of their own culture...

In this compact schema that concentrates prescriptions of scale, density, and serviceability all in one, the play {{between public and private}} interests is in the inevitable balance that transcends speculation without restricting liberty.

40|$|A new {{solution}} {{concept for}} hypergames called subjective rationalizability is proposed. Hypergame theory {{is a game}} theoretical framework that deals with agents who may misperceive game structures and explicitly takes into account hierarchy of perceptions, that is, an agent’s view about another agent’s view and so on. An action of an agent is called subjectively rationalizable when the agent <b>thinks</b> <b>it</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> a best response to the other’s choices, each of which the agent thinks each agent thinks is a best response to the other’s choices, and so on. Then it is proved that subjective rationalizability {{is equivalent to the}} standard notion of rationalizability under a condition called inside common knowledge. The result makes the new solution concept a practical tool in hypergame analyses. Theoretically, it is characterized as such a concept that provides the precise implication, that is, predicted outcomes, of a given hypergame structure...|$|R
