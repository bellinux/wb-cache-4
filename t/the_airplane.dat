5|$|The FAA {{was aware}} {{at this point}} that there was an {{emergency}} on board <b>the</b> <b>airplane.</b> By this time, Flight 11 had already crashed into the North Tower of the World Trade Center and Flight 175 was known to have been hijacked and was within minutes of striking the South Tower. After learning of this second hijacking involving an American Airlines aircraft and the hijacking involving United Airlines, American Airlines' executive vice president Gerard Arpey ordered a nationwide ground stop for the airline. The Indianapolis Air Traffic Control Center, as well as American Airlines dispatchers, made several failed attempts to contact the aircraft. At the time <b>the</b> <b>airplane</b> was hijacked, it was flying over an area of limited radar coverage. With air controllers unable to contact the flight by radio, an Indianapolis official declared that the Boeing 757 had possibly crashed at 09:09.|$|E

5|$|A timer {{ensured that}} the bomb would not explode until at least fifteen seconds after release, one-quarter of the {{predicted}} fall time, to ensure safety of the aircraft. The timer was activated when the electrical pull-out plugs connecting it to <b>the</b> <b>airplane</b> pulled loose as the bomb fell, switching it to internal (24V battery) power and starting the timer. At {{the end of the}} 15 seconds, the radar altimeters were powered up and responsibility was passed to the barometric stage.|$|E

40|$|The main {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to evaluate the effect of contexts on overall liking and just-about-right (JAR) ratings of airplane meals. A rice dish (meal type A) and a pasta dish (meal type B) were assessed. Per meal type, two variants were produced (variant 1 and 2). Two hundred forty-two consumers were randomly allocated to evaluate one of the four meals, first in a laboratory setting and then in a re-created airplane environment. In addition, 222 passengers did the same assessments during an actual flight. Specific meals (A 1, B 1) were less liked in the laboratory than in <b>the</b> re-created <b>airplane.</b> In general, no differentiation in overall liking occurred per meal type between the two tested variants in the laboratory, whereas these two variants were significantly differentiated in liking in <b>the</b> re-created <b>airplane</b> and <b>the</b> actual <b>airplane.</b> Mean overall liking ratings in <b>the</b> re-created <b>airplane</b> did not significantly differ from the mean overall liking ratings in <b>the</b> actual <b>airplane.</b> <b>The</b> observed JAR ratings did not differ much between <b>the</b> re-created <b>airplane</b> and <b>the</b> actual <b>airplane.</b> In summary, <b>the</b> re-created <b>airplane</b> as a testing location produced more similar test results to <b>the</b> actual <b>airplane</b> than <b>the</b> traditional laboratory. Practical applications: Sensory consumer testing in re-created contexts may produce results with a higher external validity than laboratory testing and therefore offer a cost-efficient alternative to extensive sensory consumer testing in real-life contexts. </p...|$|R

5|$|In <b>the</b> <b>airplane</b> {{terrorism}} mystery film Non-Stop, Parker plays {{a computer}} programmer, who {{by the end}} of the film, is revealed as one of the two criminal masterminds behind the film's extortion plot. Kenneth Turan of the Los Angeles Times notes that Parker's talents are well-employed in his supporting role. In Every Secret Thing, Richard Roeper of the Chicago Sun-Times found Parker and his detective partner to Elizabeth Banks to have been overwhelmed in their roles. Travers also found the detectivework to be uncompelling. Frank Scheck of The Hollywood Reporter found Parker's performance to have had its moments.|$|E
5|$|Killed in <b>the</b> <b>airplane</b> {{were the}} pilot Steven Altman, his brother Daniel, and his nephew Douglas.

The other group was Fabio Gallazzi, his wife, Tiziana Pedroni, and his son, Giacomo Gallazzi. The pilot of the helicopter was New Zealander Jeremy Clarke, who had logged 2,700 hours as a helicopter pilot. All recovered victims died from blunt trauma to the head, torso and extremities, according to the NYC medical examiner's office.|$|E

5000|$|This {{phase of}} <b>the</b> <b>Airplane's</b> career peaked with their famous {{performance}} at the Monterey International Pop Festival in June 1967.

Two songs from <b>the</b> <b>Airplane's</b> set were subsequently included in the D. A. Pennebaker film documentary of the event.|$|R
40|$|Flight {{tests were}} {{performed}} to investigate the change in stall/spin characteristics due to the addition of an outboard wing-leading-edge modification to a four-place, low-wing, single-engine, T-tail, general aviation research airplane. Stalls and attempted spins were performed for various weights, center of gravity positions, power settings, flap deflections, and landing-gear positions. Both stall behavior and wind resistance were improved compared with <b>the</b> baseline <b>airplane.</b> <b>The</b> latter would readily spin for all combinations of power settings, flap deflections, and aileron inputs, but <b>the</b> modified <b>airplane</b> did not spin at idle power or with flaps extended.
