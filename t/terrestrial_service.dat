25|$|A {{deal between}} TVNZ and Sky to have TVNZ 6 and 7 {{available}} to Sky subscribers {{in exchange for}} Prime finally being launched on Freeview with a virtual channel assignment of 10 on 17 August 2009. If Prime would have joined at launch then {{they may have been}} able to get a lower assignment, however virtual channel assignments are only enforced on certified receivers. It is also noted virtual channel 10 is not far off its usual tuning to push-button 9 on analogue television sets, due to its historic links with the Nine Network, its allocation on Sky's former analogue <b>terrestrial</b> <b>service,</b> and for compatibility with video recorders using the G-Code scheduling system.|$|E
2500|$|Following {{the failure}} of the {{commercial}} DTT process in May 2010 RTÉ submitted a revised DTT plan including a FTA satellite option to the Dept of Communications in mid June 2010 for approval. RTÉ publicly announced at an Oireachtas Joint Committee on Communications discussion [...] in mid July 2010 that a free-to-air satellite service, called Saorsat, would be offered to complement the terrestrial DTT service. Saorsat will enable Irish public service channels to be made available free to air and unencrypted, for the first time, as a means of covering the last 2% of the population who will be unable to receive the Saorview <b>terrestrial</b> <b>service.</b>|$|E

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the construction of}} the coordination contour for mobile (except aeronautical mobile) earth stations operating in frequency bands shared with the <b>terrestrial</b> <b>services.</b> The method used today by the national administrations for calculating the coordination contour around these stations is vague and leads to unnecessarily large coordination areas. A new method of developing the coordination contour is proposed for this type of stations. It is shown that the adoption of the method by the national administrations contributes considerably to the development and wide use of mobile earth stations and eases the harmonic coexistence of this <b>service</b> with the <b>terrestrial</b> <b>services.</b> © 2005 IEEE...|$|R
