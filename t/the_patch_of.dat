5|$|During {{the summer}} of 1982, Aloi and Ringler {{conducted}} a mark and recapture study in <b>the</b> <b>patch</b> <b>of</b> watercress where the snails appeared most densely. Using two methods (Jolly and Schnabel) and two models, they estimated {{a population of about}} 300 snails with a density of four snails per square meter of watercress habitat. These snails have subsequently been identified as Succinea sp. B, not Novisuccinea chittenangoensis. A 1983 collection of 83 snails for use in electrophoretic studies resulted in removal of 24 Novisuccinea chittenangoensis from the population; unfortunately, their identity was not verified at the time of collection, on top of which Novisuccinea chittenangoensis was thought to be more abundant than it actually was. The population of Succinea sp. B expanded rapidly to an estimate of more than 3,000 snails in 1984, whereas counts of Novisuccinea chittenangoensis in 1984 indicated the presence of approximately 100 adults. Counts of live Novisuccinea chittenangoensis from 1995 to 2001 yielded an average of five adults per survey with a high of 12 adults in 2001. and post-reproductive shell counts made {{at the end of each}} activity season from 1987 to 2001 generally identified 4 to 20 Novisuccinea chittenangoensis adults. Subsequent studies have shown that Succinea sp. B outnumbers Novisuccinea chittenangoensis by as much as 10 to 1 in the primary habitat areas.|$|E
5|$|Vegetation: Most of {{the spray}} zone {{adjacent}} to the Falls is covered with patches of various mosses, liverworts, and other low herbaceous vegetation, including Eutrochium purpureum, Angelica atropurpurea, and Aster spp. In addition, watercress Nasturtium officinale increased after the 1993 flood event. Novisuccinea chittenangoensis were found on vegetation up to 92cm above the ground and at 1/3 the maximum sunlight intensities of the sympatric Succinea sp. B. Vegetation is quite sparse {{on the west side}} of the Falls, and the only snails that have been observed there are Succinea sp. B. In drier talus {{adjacent to the}} mossy areas are various plant species, such as eastern skunk cabbage Symplocarpus foetidus and Angelica atropurpurea, upon which Succinea sp. B has also been found. During periods of heavy water flow, dew, or rain, when the vegetation is saturated, the snails have been observed actively crawling on the vegetation. During drier times, both species of snails attach themselves to the underside of leaves with a mucous epiphragm. In <b>the</b> <b>patch</b> <b>of</b> watercress, the vegetation is dense and lush. Although the watercress is dominant, other species include Angelica atropurpurea, jewelweed Impatiens capensis and Impatiens pallida, forget-me-nots Myosotis scorpioides, various mints Mentha spp., and poison ivy Toxicodendron radicans, which again support Succinea sp. B but not Novisuccinea chittenangoensis. The ledges where Novisuccinea chittenangoensis is found clearly comprise an early successional sere, periodically rejuvenated to a bare rock substrate by flood waters.|$|E

50|$|Traditionally, eye patches {{are used}} to block {{the field of view}} of one eye. Strabismic or {{amblyopic}} children are often required to wear an eye patch for hours or days. <b>The</b> use <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>patch</b> generally alternates on a daily or weekly basis between the two eyes, with a long time duration for <b>the</b> <b>patching</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> stronger eye and a shorter time duration, if any, for <b>the</b> <b>patching</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> weaker eye. In contrast to eye patching, training with occlusion goggles allows to use rapid rates of alternation.|$|R

25|$|The 1841 census {{showed a}} {{population}} of just over eight million. Two-thirds of those depended on agriculture for their survival, but they rarely received a working wage. They had to work for their landlords in return for <b>the</b> <b>patch</b> <b>of</b> land they needed to grow enough food for their own families. This was the system which forced Ireland and its peasantry into monoculture, since only the potato could be grown in sufficient quantity.

25|$|For this method, the pipette {{is sealed}} onto the cell {{membrane}} {{to obtain a}} gigaseal, while ensuring that the cell membrane remains intact. This allows the recording of currents through single, or a few, ion channels contained in <b>the</b> <b>patch</b> <b>of</b> membrane captured by the pipette. By only attaching to {{the exterior of the}} cell membrane, there is very little disturbance of the cell structure. Also, by not disrupting the interior of the cell, any intracellular mechanisms normally influencing the channel will still be able to function as they would physiologically. Using this method it is also relatively easy to obtain the right configuration, and once obtained it is fairly stable.|$|E
25|$|In the 1950s and 1960s, {{correction}} fluid made its appearance, under brand {{names such as}} Liquid Paper, Wite-Out and Tipp-Ex; it was invented by Bette Nesmith Graham. Correction fluid {{was a kind of}} opaque, white, fast-drying paint that produced a fresh white surface onto which, when dry, a correction could be retyped. However, when held to the light, the covered-up characters were visible, as was <b>the</b> <b>patch</b> <b>of</b> dry {{correction fluid}} (which was never perfectly flat, and frequently not a perfect match for the color, texture, and luster of the surrounding paper). The standard trick for solving this problem was photocopying the corrected page, but this was possible only with high quality photocopiers.|$|E
25|$|From {{the summit}} of Carl Side a system of ridges descends southward towards Millbeck. The main spur runs {{straight}} for a mile, the first half being of gentler gradient and culminating in a large patch of white stones at about 1,600ft. There is a very short rocky arête here, before the spur falls abruptly to the valley floor. On {{the eastern side of}} this section are the crags of Doups. The southern ridge sends out shorter branches on either side, just above <b>the</b> <b>patch</b> <b>of</b> white stones. On the western side across the rocky col of Long Doors is Dodd, a fell on Forestry Commission land that is largely wooded. To the east is Carlsleddam, a steep sided spur that appears sharply peaked from below: though less inspiring close up it does have a narrow and airy summit ridge.|$|E
