5|$|The {{analysis}} of communications between Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 and Inmarsat's satellite <b>telecommunication</b> <b>network</b> provide {{the only source}} of information about Flight 370's location and possible in-flight events after it disappeared from radar coverage at 2:22Malaysia Standard Time (MYT) on 8March 2014 (17:22UTC, 7March), one hour after communication with air traffic control ended and the aircraft departed from its planned flight path while over the South China Sea. Flight370 was a scheduled commercial flight with 227 passengers and 12 crew which departed Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia at 0:41 and was scheduled to land in Beijing, China at 6:30China Standard Time (6:30MYT; 22:30UTC, 7 March). Malaysia has worked in conjunction with the Australian Transport Safety Bureau to co-ordinate the analysis, which has also involved the UK's Air Accidents Investigation Branch, Inmarsat, and US National Transportation Safety Board, among others. Others have also made efforts to analyse the satellite communications, albeit challenged by a lack of publicly available information for several months after the disappearance. On 29July 2015, debris was discovered on Réunion Island which was later confirmed to come from Flight 370; it is the first physical evidence that Flight370 ended in the Indian Ocean.|$|E
5|$|The overall {{infrastructure}} of Malaysia {{is one of}} the most developed in Asia and ranked 8th in Asia and 25th in the world. Malaysia is ranked 19th in the world for its quality roads, quality of port infrastructure and quality of air transport infrastructure but ranked 39th in quality of electricity supply. Its telecommunications network is second only to Singapore's in Southeast Asia, with 4.7million fixed-line subscribers and more than 30million cellular subscribers. The country has seven international ports, the major one being the Port Klang. There are 200 industrial parks along with specialised parks such as Technology Park Malaysia and Kulim Hi-Tech Park. Fresh water is available to over 95 per cent of the population. During the colonial period, development was mainly concentrated in economically powerful cities and in areas forming security concerns. Although rural areas have been the focus of great development, they still lag behind areas such as the West Coast of Peninsular Malaysia. The <b>telecommunication</b> <b>network,</b> although strong in urban areas, is less available to the rural population.|$|E
5|$|During flight, the {{aircraft}} maintains a datalink with a satellite communication network for data and telephone calls. The datalink connects {{the aircraft}} and a ground station via satellite, which translates (changes) the signal's frequency and amplifies the signal; the ground station {{is connected to}} telecommunication networks which allows messages {{to be sent to}} and received from other locations, such as the airline's operations centre. Normal communications from Flight370 were last made at 1:07MYT and the datalink between the aircraft and satellite <b>telecommunication</b> <b>network</b> was lost at some point between 1:07 and 2:03, when the aircraft did not acknowledge a message sent from the ground station. Three minutes after the aircraft left the range of radar coverage—at 2:25—the aircraft's satellite data unit (SDU) transmitted a log-on message, which investigators believe occurred as the SDU started after a power interruption. Between the 2:25 message and 8:19, the SDU acknowledged two ground-to-aircraft telephone calls, which were not answered, and responded to automated, hourly requests from the ground station that were made to determine whether the SDU was still active. None of the communications from 2:25–8:19 contain explicit information about the aircraft's location. The aircraft's final transmission at 8:19 was a log-on message; the aircraft did not respond to a message from the ground station at 9:15. Investigators believe the 8:19 log-on message was made when the SDU was restarting after the aircraft ran out of fuel and the aircraft's auxiliary power unit was started.|$|E

25|$|The Díaz {{administration}} made {{political decisions}} and took legal measures {{that allowed the}} elite throughout Mexico to concentrate the nation's wealth by favoring monopolies. During this time, two-fifths of the state's territory was divided among 17 rich families which owned practically all of the arable land in Chihuahua. The state economy grew at a rapid pace during the Porfiriato; the economy in Chihuahua was dominated by agriculture and mining. The Díaz administration helped Governor Luis Terrazas by funding the Municipal Public Library in Chihuahua City and passing a federal initiative {{for the construction of}} the railroad from Chihuahua City to Ciudad Júarez. By 1881, the Central Mexican Railroad was completed which connected Mexico City to Ciudad Juárez. In 1883 telephone lines were installed throughout the state, allowing communication between Chihuahua City and Aldama. By 1888 the telephone services were extended from the capital to the cities of Julimes, Meoqui, and Hidalgo del Parral; the <b>telecommunication</b> <b>network</b> in the state covered an estimated 3,500 kilometers. The need of laborers to construct the extensive infrastructure projects resulted in a significant Asian immigration, mostly from China. Asian immigrants soon become integral to the state economy by opening restaurants, small grocery stores, and hotels. By the end of the Terrazas term, the state experienced an increase in commerce, mining, and banking. When the banks were nationalized, Chihuahua became the most important banking state in Mexico.|$|E
500|$|On 7 May 2008, Lebanon's 17-month-long {{political}} crisis spiraled out of control. The fighting was sparked {{by a government}} move to shut down Hezbollah's <b>telecommunication</b> <b>network</b> and remove Beirut Airport's security chief over alleged ties to Hezbollah. Hezbollah leader Hassan Nasrallah said the government's decision to declare the group's military telecommunications network illegal was a [...] "declaration of war" [...] on the organization, and demanded that the government revoke it. Hezbollah-led opposition fighters seized control of several West Beirut neighborhoods from Future Movement militiamen loyal to the backed government, in street battles that left 11 dead and 30 wounded. The opposition-seized areas were then {{handed over to the}} Lebanese Army. The army also pledged to resolve the dispute and has reversed the decisions of the government by letting Hezbollah preserve its telecoms network and re-instating the airport's security chief. At the end, rival Lebanese leaders reached consensus over Doha Agreement on 21 May 2008, to end the 18-month political feud that exploded into fighting and nearly drove the country to a new civil war. On the basis of this agreement, Hezbollah and its opposition allies were effectively granted veto power in Lebanon's parliament. At the end of the conflicts, National unity government was formed by Fouad Siniora on 11 July 2008 and Hezbollah has one minister and controls eleven of thirty seats in the cabinet.|$|E

40|$|Abstract To ensure high {{availability}} of telephone services, {{there is considerable}} interest in network management activities to develop competent fault management mechanisms. In this paper we investigate, examine, and try to adapt the current active probing technologies to fault isolation and problem determination of <b>telecommunication</b> <b>networks.</b> The unfitness, issues, and difficulties while adopting these IP-networking probing methods into fault isolation of <b>telecommunication</b> <b>networks</b> are addressed and elaborated. For achieving our goal, call-forwarding which is a dedicated function (or feature) in <b>telecommunication</b> <b>networks</b> is utilized to overcome the unfitness and difficulties while applying probing technologies to fault isolation of <b>telecommunication</b> <b>networks.</b> Numerous experiments with different probe sets, probe stations, total probe lengths, network topologies, and probing algorithms are conducted and analyzed to validate our strategy. From {{the results of our}} experiments, we can find that phone call-forwarding can not only facilitate the fault isolation with the existing active probing techniques, but also Prepared through collaborative participation in the Communications and Networks Consortium sponsore...|$|R
