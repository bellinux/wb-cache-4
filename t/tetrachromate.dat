40|$|The crystal {{structure}} of (H 3 O) 2 Cr 4 O 13 is isotypic with K 2 Cr 4 O 13. The finite <b>tetrachromate</b> anion {{in the title}} structure consists of four vertex-sharing CrO 4 tetrahedra and exhibits a typical zigzag arrangement. The crystal packing is stabilized by hydrogen bonds between these anions and hydronium cations. The two different hydronium cations are surrounded by nine O atoms of <b>tetrachromate</b> anions, with O [...] . O distances ranging between 2. 866 &# 8197;(8) and 3. 282 &# 8197;(7) &# 8197;&# 197;...|$|E
40|$|The {{structure}} of dipotassium tetrachromium(VI) tridecaoxide, K 2 Cr 4 O 13, {{has been determined}} from single-crystal X-ray data collected at 173 (2) K on a racemically twinned crystal with monoclinic Pc space-group symmetry. The structure is composed of discrete [Cr 4 O 13] 2 - zigzag chains held together by the charge-balancing potassium ions. The conformations adopted by the <b>tetrachromate</b> anion in alkali metal salts and Cr 8 O 21 are different and {{can be divided into}} three categories...|$|E
40|$|During {{the course}} of {{operation}} of black chrome electrolyte, current densities {{of the order of}} 2000 - 6000 A/m 2 are required. This is associated with the difficulties of the higher heating effect of the electrolyte and current transmission problems for full size collectors. This prompted the authors to develop suitable additives for operation at low current density. The plating solution produces black deposits at a current density of 400 A/m 2 with optical properties alpha= 0. 94 and e= 0. 07 by the use of sodium selenate and acetic acid as additives. The influences of variables such as plating time, current density and temperature on optical properties (alpha, e) are studied. Polarization characteristics of the solution are compared with the conventional <b>tetrachromate</b> solution. The use of sodium selenate and acetic acid helps to attain the deposition of black chrome at low current densitie...|$|E
5000|$|Further {{condensation}} reactions {{can occur}} in strongly acidic solution {{with the formation of}} trichromates, , and <b>tetrachromates,</b> [...] All polyoxyanions of chromium(VI) have structures made up of tetrahedral CrO4 units sharing corners.|$|R
40|$|Thermal {{decomposition}} of $CrO_ 3 $ was utilized {{to prepare a}} powder sample of the chromium oxide usually designated $Cr_ 3 O_ 8 $. Combined information from powder diffraction data using synchrotron, conventional X-ray, and neutron radiation allowed determination of the structure. The structure is triclinic (a = 5. 433 (1), b = 6. 557 (1), c = 12. 117 (2) Å, α = 106. 36 (1), β = 95. 73 (1) and γ = 77. 96 (1) °) and was refined in the space group P 1. The true composition of the compound is $Cr_ 8 O_{ 21 }$. There are two distinct types of chromium atoms in the structure, which may be designated the oxidation numbers (III) and (VI), respectively. The structure is built from pairs of edge-sharing Cr(III) O 6 octahedra linked together by Cr(VI) O 4 tetrahedra to form sheets. The sheets are then linked together by <b>tetrachromate</b> groups ($Cr(VI) _ 4 O_{ 13 }$) to form a three-dimensional structure. Thus, the chromium oxide may be described as $Cr(III) _ 2 (Cr(VI) O_ 4) _ 2 (Cr(VI) _ 4 O_{ 13 }$). The magnetic properties of $Cr_ 8 O_{ 21 }$ were investigated in the temperature range 5 to 300 K. Above 100 K the compound is paramagnetic. Magnetic susceptibility data indicate a transition to antiferromagnetism around 100 K, but only vague indications for additional magnetic reflections were found with neutron powder diffraction...|$|E
