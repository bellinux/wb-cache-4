Their high speed and accurate positioning capability, combined with a favourable holding torque in unpowered condition, make piezo motors also very attractive for actuation purposes in spacecraft mechanisms.

40|$|Tribology is {{the science}} of friction, {{lubrication}} and wear. A tribological interface is composed of two contacting surfaces in relative motion. The radial piston hydraulic motor includes a lot of tribological interfaces. The interfaces {{are made up of}} the contacts between the moving parts in the motor that transform energy in the form of hydraulic flow into motion of the output shaft. Many of them are highly loaded due to the large forces that must be transmitted to produce the required torque. The performance in view of efficiency of the hydraulic motor depends strongly on the tribological properties in these interfaces. In industry today, there is a general strive towards better efficiency to minimize impact on the environment by lowering energy consumption. This puts a lot of focus on <b>tribology,</b> especially <b>in</b> applications like the hydraulic motor whose purpose is to convert energy into some desired motion. Indeed, minimizing the losses/friction in the tribological interfaces leads to less energy needed to produce the desired motion. Another aspect of <b>tribology</b> is wear <b>in</b> the interfaces which can affect durability or toughness of the motor. At present, design and optimization of tribological interfaces is mostly done by trial and error experimental work and testing. This will always be needed but if more of the testing can be done using computer based computational models a more cost effective and faster design process could be achieved. A computational model would also lead to better understanding of tribological processes present in the simulated application due to the possibility to investigate properties that are very hard to measure. The work in this thesis involves development of computer based computational models for simulation of the <b>tribology</b> <b>in</b> hydraulic motors. The model is validated through comparison with experiments. Furthermore it is shown that modelling can be used to analyze <b>tribology</b> <b>in</b> the hydraulic motor and consequently {{can be used as a}} design tool for improving efficiency.

30|$|Despite {{continuous}} {{improvements in}} machine elements {{over the past}} few decades, lubrication issues have impeded human exploration of the universe because single solid or liquid lubrication systems have been unable to satisfy the ever-increasing performance requirements of <b>space</b> <b>tribology.</b> <b>In</b> this study, we present an overview of the development of carbon-based films as protective coatings, with reference to their high hardness, low friction, and chemical inertness, and with a particular focus on diamond-like carbon (DLC) films. We also discuss the design of carbon-based solid-liquid synergy lubricating coatings with regards to their physicochemical properties and tribological performance. Solid-liquid composite coatings are fabricated via spinning liquid lubricants on solid lubricating films. Such duplex lubricating coatings are considered the most ideal lubrication choice for moving mechanical systems <b>in</b> <b>space</b> as they can overcome the drawback of adhesion and cold-welding associated with solid films under harsh space conditions and can minimize the crosslinking or chain scission of liquid lubricants under space irradiation. State of the art carbon-based solid-liquid synergy lubricating systems therefore holds great promise for space applications due to solid/liquid synergies resulting in superior qualities including excellent friction reduction and anti-wear properties as well as strong anti-irradiation capacities, thereby meeting the requirements of high reliability, high precision, high efficiency, and long lifetime for space drive mechanisms.|$|R
