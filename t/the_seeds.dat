5|$|Mourning doves show a {{preference}} for <b>the</b> <b>seeds</b> of certain species of plant over others. Foods taken in preference to others include pine nuts, sweetgum seeds, and <b>the</b> <b>seeds</b> of pokeberry, amaranth, canary grass, corn, sesame, and wheat. When their favorite foods are absent, mourning doves will eat <b>the</b> <b>seeds</b> of other plants, including buckwheat, rye, goosegrass and smartweed.|$|E
5|$|Warm air : Exposition {{of seeds}} to warm air (50 to 70°C, {{depending}} duration) kills B. rufimanus developing into <b>the</b> <b>seeds</b> {{at the same}} time it lowers water content. However, warmth can decrease germination rates of <b>the</b> <b>seeds</b> and degrade the visual aspect and the protein content of <b>the</b> <b>seeds,</b> which would be problematic for the seed market.|$|E
5|$|Adults are in {{reproductive}} diapause and overwinter in {{protected sites}} such as under tree barks, particularly of old, standing trees, hedgerows, lichen, and in forests or leaf litter. At early spring, they can be observed feeding on pollen and nectar of nearby flowers and particularly on Fabacae and Vicia spp.. Some B. rufimanus can survive during winter in larval or pupal diapause inside <b>the</b> <b>seeds</b> and terminate their diapause, finish their post-embryonic growth and emerge from <b>the</b> <b>seeds</b> after sowing.|$|E

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>seed</b> or samara of {{this species}} is unusual in having two flat bracts {{extending}} either side of <b>the</b> <b>seed</b> to form a wing-like shape with <b>the</b> <b>seed</b> embedded along one long edge and the wings angled slightly back from it. As <b>the</b> <b>seed</b> ripens <b>the</b> wings dry and the long edge furthest from <b>the</b> <b>seed</b> curls slightly upwards. When ripe, <b>the</b> <b>seed</b> drops off and its aerodynamic form allows it to glide away from the tree. The wing spans some 13 cm and can glide for great distances. <b>The</b> <b>seed</b> moves through <b>the</b> air like a butterfly in flight - it gains height, stalls, dips and accelerates, once again producing lift, a process termed phugoid oscillation. In the past it was often found on the decks of ships at sea.|$|R

25|$|In {{order for}} <b>the</b> <b>seed</b> coat to split, the embryo must imbibe (soak up water), which causes it to swell, {{splitting}} <b>the</b> <b>seed</b> coat. However, <b>the</b> nature of <b>the</b> <b>seed</b> coat determines how rapidly water can penetrate and subsequently initiate germination. The rate of imbibition {{is dependent on}} the permeability of <b>the</b> <b>seed</b> coat, amount of water in the environment and the area of contact <b>the</b> <b>seed</b> has to <b>the</b> source of water. For some seeds, imbibing too much water too quickly can kill <b>the</b> <b>seed.</b> For some seeds, once water is imbibed the germination process cannot be stopped, and drying then becomes fatal. Other seeds can imbibe and lose water a few times without causing ill effects, but drying can cause secondary dormancy.|$|R

50|$|Beginning {{with the}} 2007 state tournament, {{the top five}} teams in each class are <b>seeded.</b> Coaches of <b>the</b> {{participating}} schools vote to determine <b>the</b> <b>seeded</b> teams <b>the</b> Saturday before the state tournament.

40|$|<b>The</b> <b>seeding</b> rate {{influences}} <b>the</b> intraspecific competition, {{which might}} affect the development and quality of seeds in soybean. However, <b>the</b> impact of <b>seeding</b> rate on <b>the</b> physical and physiological qualities of soybean seeds needs to be better elucidated. This study aimed to evaluate the effects of soybean plant density on <b>the</b> <b>seed</b> size {{as well as the}} effects of the interaction between the plant density and <b>seed</b> size on <b>the</b> <b>seed</b> mass, green seed occurence, and physiological <b>seed</b> quality. <b>The</b> experiments were carried out in the growing seasons of the years 2013 / 14 and 2014 / 15 in a Latossolo Vermelho distroférrico, under a randomized complete block design, using the NK 7059 RR cultivar with six replications. Four plant densities (150, 300, 440, and 560 thousand viable seeds ha– 1) were evaluated. After <b>the</b> classification of <b>seeds</b> into four sizes, using a set of sieves, a 4 × 4 factorial scheme was used for the statistical analysis of the four plant densities and four <b>seed</b> sizes. <b>The</b> <b>seed</b> samples were evaluated for <b>the</b> <b>seed</b> mass, green seed percentage, germination, and vigor. Under thermal and water stress during seed development, an increase in <b>the</b> <b>seeding</b> rate led to a reduction in <b>the</b> green <b>seed</b> occurrence and an increase in <b>the</b> <b>seed</b> size and mass. However, in the absence of thermal and water stress, <b>the</b> <b>seed</b> size and mass were not altered by <b>the</b> <b>seeding</b> rate and, there was no occurrence of green seeds...|$|R
