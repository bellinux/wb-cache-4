5|$|Mayflies are {{involved}} in both primary production and bioturbation. A study in laboratory simulated streams revealed that the Centroptilum genus of the mayfly increased the export of periphyton, thus indirectly affecting primary production positively, which is an essential process for ecosystems. The mayfly can also reallocate and alter the nutrient availability in aquatic habitats {{through the process of}} bioturbation. By burrowing in the bottom of lakes and redistributing nutrients, mayflies indirectly regulate phytoplankton and epibenthic primary production. Once burrowing {{to the bottom of the}} lake, mayfly nymphs begin to billow their respiratory gills. This motion creates current that carries food particles through the burrow and allows the nymph to filter feed. Other mayfly nymphs possess elaborate filter feeding mechanisms like that of the genus Isonychia. The nymph have forelegs that contain long bristle-like structures that have two rows of hairs. Interlocking hairs form the filter by which the insect traps food particles. The action of filter feeding has a small impact on water purification but an even larger impact on the convergence of small particulate matter into matter of a more complex form <b>that</b> <b>goes</b> <b>on</b> to benefit consumers later in the food chain.|$|E
5|$|Unfortunately, as I tell {{my white}} friends, we as black people, we're {{never going to}} be {{successful}}, not because of you white people, but because of other black people. When you're black, {{you have to deal with}} so much crap in your life from other black people. It's a dirty, dark secret; I'm glad it's coming out. One of the reasons we're {{never going to be}} successful as a whole, because of other black people. And for some reason we are brainwashed to think, if you're not a thug or an idiot, you're not black enough. If you go to school, make good grades, speak intelligent, and don't break the law, you're not a good black person. And it's a dirty, dark secret. There are a lot of black people who are unintelligent, who don't have success. It's best to knock a successful black person down because they're intelligent, they speak well, they do well in school, and they're successful... We're the only ethnic group who say, 'Hey, if you go to jail, it gives you street cred.' It's just typical BS <b>that</b> <b>goes</b> <b>on</b> when you're black, man.|$|E

25|$|The 'Man on the throne' in {{the vision}} of Ezekiel descriptively {{represents}} God, who is controlling everything <b>that</b> <b>goes</b> <b>on</b> in the world, and how all of the archetypes He set up should interact. The 'Man on the throne', however, drives when the four angels connect their wings. This means that God will not be revealed to us by us looking at all four elements (for instance) as separate and independent entities. However, when {{one looks at the}} way that earth, wind, fire and water (for instance) which all oppose each other are able to work together and coexist in complete harmony in the world, this shows that there is really a higher power (God) telling these elements how to act.|$|E

25|$|Several {{programs}} have documented the behind-the-scenes {{events of the}} show. A 60 Minutes report taped in October 2004 depicted the intense writing frenzy <b>that</b> <b>goes</b> <b>on</b> during the week leading up to a show, with crowded meetings and long hours. The report particularly noted {{the involvement of the}} guest host(s) in developing and selecting the sketches in which they will appear. Similarly, there has been an A episode of Biography which covered the production process, as well as an episode of TV Tales in 2002 on E!. In 2010, Saturday Night, a 94-minute documentary by actor James Franco in his directorial debut, was released; it follows the production process of the December 6, 2008, episode hosted by John Malkovich, from the concept stage to the episode actually airing live. Although it originated as a five-minute short film for Franco's New York University film class, Michaels granted Franco access to the process, allowing the project to be expanded. On February 15, 2015, NBC aired a 3 1/2-hour special on Saturday Night Live's 40th anniversary. The program included a mix of clips, new performances of classic characters from previous cast members and special guest appearances from previous hosts.|$|E
25|$|Some {{commentators}} have expressed {{the view that}} excessive value has been placed by the courts on protecting {{the independence of the}} judiciary, and that insufficient weight has been given to the right to freedom of speech. One assumption said to be incorrect is that undermining public confidence in the administration of justice is in all circumstances harmful to the public interest. Arguably, if the scandalizing allegation is true or is an opinion honestly and reasonably held, then it is in the public interest that such speech be heard precisely because {{of the importance of the}} judiciary to society. However, common law rules of contempt do not recognize the defence of either justification or fair comment which are available to the tort of defamation. Secondly, the claim that scandalizing the court may undermine public confidence in the judiciary represents an unduly pessimistic view of the maturity and ability of the Singapore public to assess for itself whether or not the scandalizing speech is true, and is perhaps a sweeping statement as to general public awareness. Lastly, it is also assumed that public confidence in the judiciary can be preserved by the suppression of scandalizing speech. However, it is unlikely that such speech can ever be completely suppressed. It would be impossible to monitor speech <b>that</b> <b>goes</b> <b>on</b> in homes, coffee shops and hawker centres. Through these informal channels, suspicions of the judiciary may fester and grow.|$|E
500|$|Executive {{producer}} Ronald D.

[...] In stating that Carnivàle was meant to be a demanding show with a lot of subtext, Knauf refrained from giving explicit clues. He did not wish his intent as an author to supersede the viewer's interpretation.|$|E

500|$|At Fillmore East {{was one of}} 50 {{recordings}} {{chosen in}} 2004 by the Library of Congress {{to be added to}} the National Recording Registry. Rolling Stone included at number 49 in their 2003 list of The 500 Greatest Albums of All Time, describing it as [...] "rock's greatest live double LP." [...] The album was also included in the books 1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die (2005) and 1,000 Recordings To Hear Before You Die (2008). In the latter, author Tom Moon noted that, nearly forty years after its release, [...] " [...] remains one of the best live albums in rock history.

500|$|The {{writing and}} {{recording}} process were largely {{the same as}} that for the first OSI album. Matheos would send Moore guitar, keyboard and programming parts; Moore would then [...] "chop them up and stuff".

[...] "With Kevin it's much more collaborative in that I come up with a song idea and it can change completely from my original idea to the final product on the record." ...|$|E

He said it is a [...] "significant departure" [...] from any of his {{previous}} works, {{and that it has}} a future history unlike anything he had tackled before. In an interview with Andromeda Spaceways Inflight Magazine in September 2008, Bear said that what inspired him to write City at the End of Time was the question, [...] "What if we're still primitive in our thinking ?", and this led to the idea for a story of [...] "a Universe <b>that</b> <b>goes</b> <b>on</b> and on and on, and how reality might have to be changed by that circumstance." ...|$|E
500|$|Many of {{the sound}} effects in Barton Fink are laden with meaning. For example, Barton is summoned by a bell while dining in New York; its sound is light and pleasant. By contrast, the eerie {{sustained}} bell of the Hotel Earle rings endlessly through the lobby, until Chet silences it. The nearby rooms of the hotel emit a constant chorus of guttural cries, moans, and assorted unidentifiable noises. These sounds coincide with Barton's confused mental state and punctuate Charlie's claim that [...] "I hear everything <b>that</b> <b>goes</b> <b>on</b> in this dump". The applause in the first scene foreshadows the tension of Barton's move west, mixed {{as it is with}} the sound of an ocean wave crashing– an image which is shown onscreen soon thereafter.|$|E
500|$|While {{identifying}} a similar ISKCON-inspired theme in Harrison's 1973 song [...] "The Lord Loves the One (That Loves the Lord)", Allison discusses [...] "Awaiting on You All" [...] as {{a precedent for}} further statements by Harrison against organised religion, particularly Catholicism. Among these, Harrison parodied the Last Supper in his inner-gatefold artwork for Living in the Material World (1973), dressed as a Catholic priest and again mocking the [...] "perceived materialism and violence of the Roman church", according to Allison. In addition, {{in his role as}} film producer, Harrison supported Monty Python's controversial parodying of the biblical story of Christ in Life of Brian (1979), about which he said: [...] "Actually, [...] was upholding Him and knocking all the idiotic stuff <b>that</b> <b>goes</b> <b>on</b> around religion." ...|$|E

500|$|Charlie's {{understanding}} of the world is depicted as omniscient, as when he asks Barton about [...] "the two lovebirds next door", {{despite the fact that they}} are several doors away. When Barton asks how he knows about them, Charlie responds: [...] "Seems like I hear everything <b>that</b> <b>goes</b> <b>on</b> in this dump. Pipes or somethin'." [...] His total awareness of the events at the Earle demonstrate the kind of understanding needed to show real empathy, as described by Audrey. This theme returns when Charlie explains in his final scene: [...] "Most guys I just feel sorry for. Yeah. It tears me up inside, to think about what they're going through. How trapped they are. I understand it. I feel for 'em. So I try to help them out." ...|$|E
500|$|The song's {{music video}} was {{directed}} by Little X and features cameo appearances by Keri Hilson, Bria Myles, Sean Faris and Justin Timberlake. It does not follow a storyline and per Furtado's request, focuses on scenes with dancing and flirting {{because she wanted to}} recreate the song's indicative vibe, and took the opportunity to film a club video for the first time. Furtado said of the video, [...] "It's that whole dance <b>that</b> <b>goes</b> <b>on.</b> There's that mystery there, the fun, playful sexiness, the verbal Ping-Pong game". Furtado and Timbaland cannot decide whether they want to begin dating or instead flirt with others on the dance floor. Their single performances are intercut with several scenes of a dancing crowd, and the lighting changes between blue, green, red, and yellow colors.|$|E
500|$|The 25th piece came {{suitably}} Halloween-themed. Located on the Bowery, it {{exhibited a}} Grim Reaper riding a bumper car in circles to an elaborate light show, fog machine and Blue Öyster Cult's (Don't Fear) The Reaper. The accompanying audio guide offered a self-mockery interpretation, with Banksy stating that often [...] "the role {{of art is}} {{to remind us of}} our mortality," [...] implying that with this mounted art show <b>that</b> <b>goes</b> <b>on</b> [...] "for so long we wish we were dead already." [...] The site of the exhibit was once that of an antique shop, some remains of which were placed in a coffin that occupied the lot for months. This prompted other interpretations of the installations message, paying homage to the [...] "ghosts of Bowry," [...] as the antique store owner suggested.|$|E
