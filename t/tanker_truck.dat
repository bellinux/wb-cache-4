5|$|Aircraft {{de-icing}} vehicles usually {{consist of}} a large <b>tanker</b> <b>truck,</b> containing the concentrated de-icing fluid, with a water feed to dilute the fluid according to the ambient temperature. The vehicle also normally has a cherry picker crane, allowing the operator to spray the entire aircraft in as little time as possible; an entire Boeing 737 can be treated in under 10 minutes by a single de-icing vehicle.|$|E
5|$|An FAA {{official}} {{requested a}} face-to-face meeting with Cooper aboard the aircraft, which was denied.

5|$|During the Second World War Lysaker Station {{was hit by}} five {{sabotage}} missions by the Norwegian resistance movement, {{in which}} tanks of gasoline, attached or not attached to railroad cars, were blown up. The sabotages took place on 16 December 1944 and 9, 10, 12 and 13 January 1945. On 13 January a <b>tanker</b> <b>truck</b> was attacked as well. There were three additional attacks on Lysaker in 1944 and 1945, two of them against factories and workshops.

5|$|Aircraft deicing {{vehicles}} {{have also}} improved since the accident, usually {{consisting of a}} large <b>tanker</b> <b>truck,</b> containing the concentrated de-icing fluid, with a water feed to dilute the fluid according to the ambient temperature. The vehicle also normally has a cherry picker crane, allowing the operator to spray the entire aircraft in as little time as possible; an entire Boeing 737 can be treated in under 10 minutes by a single de-icing vehicle. Airport runways are also deiced by sprayers fitted with long spraying arms. These arms are wide enough to cross the entire runway, and allow de-icing of the entire airstrip {{to take place in}} a single pass, reducing the length of time that the runway is unavailable.|$|E
5|$|On July10, 2008, a <b>tanker</b> <b>truck</b> full {{of water}} crashed into a tree along a portion of NY149 between Bay Road (CR7) and Ridge Road (NY9L) that {{features}} a sharp curve. After the first accident occurred at 3:10 a.m., a second tractor-trailer, who had stopped because of the tanker, rolled in reverse, jackknifing across the road and hitting a car. The road was shut down for the accident, where {{the driver of the}} tanker was taken to Glens Falls Hospital. The drivers of the car and the tractor-trailer that jackknifed were not hurt. The route was reopened by 11:40 a.m. This accident was one of many tractor-trailer accidents that has occurred on this stretch of NY149.|$|E

30|$|The {{diffusion}} of motor vehicles has also changed camel management. Most successful refugee camel owners own a jeep or truck. Especially market-oriented camel herders use other complementary {{technologies such as}} <b>tanker</b> <b>trucks,</b> GPS and satellite phones. Trucks {{make it easier to}} supplement camels’ diets with harvested wild plants, hay and fodder. The historical constraints related to water provision for camels are addressed by developing new wells, mechanization (pumps) and <b>tanker</b> <b>trucks</b> that bring water to the herds, which obviates the need to move herds to water. There is generally increased reliance on owned or rented <b>tanker</b> <b>trucks</b> both among refugees and nomadic herders, particularly for larger, market-oriented herds. Herds can exploit grazing resources in the liberated territories that would otherwise be too distant from water points, whereas in the camps, it permits large herds to be maintained on the periphery where water is deposited in large tanks.|$|R
25|$|In Mogadishu, TFG militias set up checkpoints in the city. At one checkpoint, a {{group of}} militia {{apparently}} attempted to extort money from the driver of an oil <b>tanker</b> <b>truck.</b> In the ensuing argument, a rocket was fired at the vehicle, injuring at least 2 or 3 people.

25|$|A <b>tanker</b> <b>truck,</b> {{which can}} also {{be known as a}} water tender or water bowser, is a {{specialist}} fire appliance with the primary purpose of transporting large amounts of water to the fire area to make it available for extinguishing operations. These are especially useful in rural areas where fire hydrants are not readily available and natural water resources are insufficient or difficult to exploit.|$|E
25|$|In the West Bank, {{collection}} of rainwater {{is a very}} limited resource in addition to <b>tanker</b> <b>truck</b> water for Palestinians who lack connection to the water grid, notably in rural areas. However, Israeli authorities control even the {{collection of}} small quantities of rainwater. According to the 2009 report Troubled Waters by Amnesty International, some 180,000–200,000 Palestinians living in rural communities {{have no access to}} running water and the Israeli army often prevents them from even collecting rainwater. The Israeli army frequently destroys small rainwater harvesting cisterns built by Palestinian communities who have no access to running water, or prevents their construction.|$|E

25|$|Access to safe {{drinking}} water is indicated by safe water sources. These improved drinking water sources include household connection, public standpipe, borehole condition, protected dug well, protected spring, and rain water collection. Sources that do not encourage improved drinking water {{to the same extent}} as previously mentioned include: unprotected wells, unprotected springs, rivers or ponds, vender-provided water, bottled water (consequential of limitations in quantity, not quality of water), and <b>tanker</b> <b>truck</b> water. Access to sanitary water comes hand in hand with access to improved sanitation facilities for excreta, such as connection to public sewer, connection to septic system, or a pit latrine with a slab or water seal.|$|E
25|$|On June 9, 2007, {{a tanker}} fire {{occurred}} on SR8 when a <b>tanker</b> <b>truck</b> with 10,000 gallons of fuel collided with another vehicle {{and started a}} fire. The fire caused SR8 to close {{for a couple of}} hours except for the westbound left lane, which crews used to get oil out of the soil underneath the highway. During the Winter 2007 storm, a slope that held up SR8 was eroded by floodwaters. The slope, located on SR8 west of the US101 interchange, and is scheduled to begin this season and last 2 months. In 2010, WSDOT aims to rebuild the columns that support the SR8/US101 interchange and reduce the risk of failure in an earthquake, such as the 2001 Nisqually earthquake.|$|E
25|$|Most filling {{stations}} are {{built in a}} similar manner, {{with most of the}} fueling installation underground, pump machines in the forecourt and a point of service inside a building. Single or multiple fuel tanks are usually deployed underground. Local regulations and environmental concerns may require a different method, with some stations storing their fuel in container tanks, entrenched surface tanks or unprotected fuel tanks deployed on the surface. Fuel is usually offloaded from a <b>tanker</b> <b>truck</b> into the tanks through a separate valve, located on the filling station's perimeter. Fuel from the tanks travels to the dispenser pumps through underground pipes. For every fuel tank, direct access must be available at all times. Most tanks can be accessed through a service canal directly from the forecourt.|$|E

500|$|There {{have been}} three {{chemical}} spills on SR11. The first one happened on November 30, 1984. A <b>tanker</b> <b>truck</b> leaked Titanium tetrachloride at the I-80/SR11 interchange at Girard. About 200 residents who lived near the highway were evacuated. No injuries were reported, and the chemicals were soon contained. A spill was reported on July 7, 1996. A <b>tanker</b> <b>truck</b> spilled methyl alcohol onto SR11 northbound, in Fairfield Township. The spill was contained, and charges were filed against the driver.
