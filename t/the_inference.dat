5|$|By {{the time}} the two {{monitors}} entered service, {{the prospect of a}} French attack had decreased, prompting the Navy to question the usefulness of retaining the vessels. As a result, they were quickly removed from service. The ultimate fate of the two ships is unclear; according to naval historian Erich Gröner, both ships were sold for 3,500gold marks in December 1875. Robert Gardiner, however, states that the ships remained, out of service, until 1884, when they were sold for scrapping. The latter version would appear to be correct, as J.F. von Kronenfels published an elevation and deckplan of Rhein in 1881, with <b>the</b> <b>inference</b> that Rhein and Mosel were still extant at that time.|$|E

40|$|Inferences {{are assumed}} as {{processes}} which one draws some conclusions from <b>the</b> premises. <b>The</b> <b>inferences</b> in which <b>the</b> premise and the conclusion statements have category terms are called <b>the</b> category-based class <b>inferences.</b> <b>The</b> {{purpose of this}} study was to examine developmental changes in cognitive processes in <b>the</b> category-based class <b>inferences.</b> There are two types of <b>inferences.</b> For <b>the</b> upward <b>inference</b> <b>the</b> category terms in the conclusion are higher than those in the premise, e. g., Ekuri (novel word) is a kind of dogs. Is ekuri an animal?" For <b>the</b> downward <b>inference</b> <b>the</b> conclusion terms are lower than the premise ones, e. g., "Karani (novel word) is a kind of animals. Is karani a dog?" The three tasks were provided for each inference. Kindergartners, second graders, and college students were given six inference tasks and required to answer to the conclusion statements with "Yes" or "No" and to justify the answers. The mean number of the positive answers ("Yes") was greater for the upward than for <b>the</b> downward <b>inferences,</b> and for children (kindergartners and second graders) than for students. The interaction was significant, which showed that the mean number in <b>the</b> downward <b>inference</b> was greater for children than for students while the mean number in <b>the</b> upward <b>inference</b> was about <b>the</b> same for the three groups. For <b>the</b> upward <b>inference</b> <b>the</b> percentages of the subjects who made the positive answers to the three tasks consistently were greater for students than for children. For <b>the</b> downward <b>inference</b> those who made the negative answers ("No") consistently were greater for students than for children while those who respond to the three tasks inconsistently were greater for children than for students. The findings suggest that cognitive processes in children's class inferences are different from those in adults' class <b>inferences.</b> <b>The</b> associative knowledge that the conclusion terms are recalled from the premise terms are mainly used in children's upward and downward inferences. Two types of inclusive knowledge are mainly used in adults' inferences: for <b>the</b> upward <b>inference</b> <b>the</b> inclusive knowledge that the premise terms are included in the conclusion terms and for <b>the</b> downward <b>inference</b> <b>the</b> inclusive knowledge that the premise terms include some category terms other than the conclusion terms...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Partially preordered belief bases {{are very}} {{convenient}} for an efficient representation of incomplete knowledge. They offer flexibility and avoid to compare unrelated pieces of information. A number of inference relations for reasoning from partially preordered belief bases have been proposed. This paper {{sheds light on}} the following approaches: the partial binary lexicographic <b>inference,</b> <b>the</b> compatible-based lexico-graphic <b>inference,</b> <b>the</b> democratic <b>inference,</b> <b>the</b> compatible-based inclu-sion <b>inference,</b> <b>the</b> strong possibilistic <b>inference</b> and <b>the</b> weak possibilistic <b>inference.</b> In particular, we propose to analyse these inference relations according to two key dimensions: the computational complexity and the cautiousness. It turns out that almost all the corresponding decision problems are located at most at the second level of the polynomial hi-erarchy. As for the cautiousness results, they genereally extend those obtained in the particular case of totally preordered belief bases. ...|$|R
