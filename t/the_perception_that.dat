40|$|This study {{considered}} <b>the</b> <b>perceptions</b> <b>that</b> {{visually handicapped}} adolescents have of their parents’ attitudes towards {{them and the}} extent to which visually handicapped adolescents have developed homemaking skills which are considered necessary for independence in daily living. <b>The</b> <b>perceptions</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> parents have of their child’s development of these skills and also <b>the</b> <b>perceptions</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> students have of their own development of these skills were also of concern. More specifically, the study had the following purposes: To determine how visually handicapped adolescents perceive the attitude that their parents have toward them. Do they perceive their parents as accepting, concentrating or avoiding them? To determine how visually handicapped adolescents perceive their own personal development of and participation in skills associated with self care and home living. To determine how the mothers and fathers of visually handicapped adolescents perceive their child’s development of and participation in skills associated with self care and home living. To determine if there is a relationship between <b>the</b> <b>perceptions</b> <b>that</b> visually handicapped adolescents have of their parents’ attitudes towards them and the self care and home living skills that have been developed by the adolescents. To determine if visually handicapped adolescents perceive their own personal development of and participation in self care and home living skills in the same way that their parents perceive their development of and participation in these skills. To determine whether any differences exist between <b>the</b> <b>perceptions</b> <b>that</b> totally blind adolescents have of their parents’ attitudes towards them and <b>the</b> <b>perceptions</b> <b>that</b> partially sighted adolescents have of their parents’ attitudes towards them.

5|$|In {{addition}} to the whiskey tax, westerners {{had a number of}} other grievances with the national government, chief among which was <b>the</b> <b>perception</b> <b>that</b> the government was not adequately protecting the residents living in western frontier. The Northwest Indian War was going badly for the United States, with major losses in 1791. Furthermore, westerners were prohibited by Spain (which then owned Louisiana) from using the Mississippi River for commercial navigation. Until these issues were addressed, westerners felt that the government was ignoring their security and economic welfare. Adding the whiskey excise to these existing grievances only increased tensions on the frontier.|$|E
5|$|On {{her return}} to Australian waters, several sailors aboard the warship mutinied after a request for an extra day's leave in Fremantle was denied, {{although}} other issues {{played a part in}} the mutiny, including minimal leave during the war, problems with pay, and <b>the</b> <b>perception</b> <b>that</b> Royal Navy personnel were more likely to receive promotions than Australian sailors. Post-war budget cuts saw Australias role downgraded to a training ship before she was placed in reserve in 1921. The disarmament provisions of the Washington Naval Treaty required the destruction of Australia as part of the British Empire's commitment, and she was scuttled off Sydney Heads in 1924.|$|E

5|$|Cricket {{followers}} {{from the}} south of England remained slightly distrustful of Hutton owing to <b>the</b> <b>perception</b> <b>that</b> he occasionally carried professionalism to excess. When he was appointed England captain, many in the cricketing establishment held his professionalism against him {{with the result that}} Hutton never felt comfortable dealing with the amateurs who ran English cricket at the time. While captain, he was criticised for caution and negativity but also was expected to lead a successful team at a time when results began to assume a far greater importance than in previous years. Consequently, Hutton never felt secure in the position and was often uncomfortable around the amateur establishment. Like Herbert Sutcliffe, he attempted to alter his accent to match that of leading southern amateurs to help him to fit in. But he did not enjoy the attention that went with the captaincy, and he often worried about the impression he was making.|$|E
5|$|Despite being a {{tactical}} draw, Antietam {{is considered a}} turning point {{of the war and}} a victory for the Union because it ended Lee's strategic campaign (his first invasion of the North) and it allowed President Lincoln to issue the Emancipation Proclamation on September 22, taking effect on January 1, 1863. Although Lincoln had intended to issue the proclamation earlier, he was advised by his Cabinet to wait until a Union victory to avoid <b>the</b> <b>perception</b> <b>that</b> it was issued out of desperation. The Union victory and Lincoln's proclamation played a considerable role in dissuading the governments of France and Britain from recognizing the Confederacy; some suspected they were planning {{to do so in the}} aftermath of another Union defeat. McClellan had no prior knowledge that the plans for emancipation rested on his battle performance.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{the losing}} {{and the poor}} attendance, the Buccaneers {{were one of the}} NFL's most {{profitable}} teams for most of Culverhouse's ownership. In 1989, only the Chicago Bears had higher profits than the 5–11 Buccaneers, who profited $6.3 million with the league's second-lowest payroll, while the Super Bowl champion San Francisco 49ers lost $16.2 million. The team attributed their low salaries to the players' youth, stating that it was the coaches who had made the decision to use younger players, who drew lower salaries than veterans. This contributed to <b>the</b> <b>perception</b> <b>that</b> Culverhouse was not committed to fielding a quality team, although the rookie contracts he gave to Vinny Testaverde and Paul Gruber were so high as to upset other team owners, while he made Ray Perkins one of the five highest-paid NFL head coaches. He also offered Bill Parcells $6.5 million to coach the team, offered draft pick Bo Jackson a five-year, $7 million contract that was at the time the highest in NFL history for a rookie, paid Keith McCants an NFL-record $2.5 million signing bonus, and paid Steve Young $6 million in salary, plus another $1 million for the buyout of his USFL contract.|$|E

5|$|LGBT {{themes in}} comics are a {{relatively}} new concept, as lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) themes and characters were historically omitted intentionally from the content of comic books and their comic strip predecessors, due to either censorship or <b>the</b> <b>perception</b> <b>that</b> comics were for children. With any mention of homosexuality in mainstream United States comics forbidden by the Comics Code Authority (CCA) until 1989, earlier attempts at exploring these issues in the US {{took the form of}} subtle hints or subtext regarding a character's sexual orientation. LGBT themes were tackled earlier in underground comix from the early 1970s onward.

Nicholas and Alexandra refused to listen. In December 1916, Dmitri and four of his friends killed Rasputin. Michael learned of the murder at Brasovo, where he was spending Christmas with his family. On 28 December, according to the French ambassador, there was a failed attempt to assassinate Alexandra; the lone assailant was caught and hanged the next day. The Duma President Mikhail Rodzianko, Grand Duchess Marie Pavlovna and British ambassador Buchanan joined calls for Alexandra to be removed from influence, but Nicholas still refused to take their advice. Plots and gossip against Nicholas and Alexandra continued to build.|$|E
5|$|Nolan North, {{the voice}} actor who played Drake, {{had a large}} role in {{defining}} the character's physical and vocal reactions. In the Uncharted series, the actors were used for motion capture, and acted as if performing in a movie. Motion capture was done on a soundstage, and the dialog recorded during this process was used in the game. North was allowed to ad-lib dialog and insert aspects of his own personality into the character. In naming the character, the development team considered many different choices, including Ethan, Samuel, and John. Matthew Drake was seriously contemplated, but received a poor reaction from those it was presented to. Eventually, Naughty Dog settled on the name Nathan for its ability to be shortened to Nate, and <b>the</b> <b>perception</b> <b>that</b> it sounded historical.

5|$|Originally {{known as}} the Alumnae Gymnasium, the {{building}} was erected {{as a response to}} <b>the</b> <b>perception</b> <b>that</b> Vassar's physical education program was falling behind those of other Seven Sisters colleges. Plans for the hall were made, scrapped, and remade as the college and alumnae benefactors struggled to raise sufficient funds. Ultimately, the building was designed by William Tubby and constructed in 1889, signaling a physical decentralization away from the college's Main Building. When it opened, the gymnasium featured a large pool {{and a variety of other}} athletic spaces. Vassar's enrollment quickly outgrew the limited space within the building, and it was first expanded and then superseded by Kenyon Hall in the 1930s. The Geology Department moved into the building shortly thereafter.|$|E
5|$|Several {{universities}} on the West Coast, led by California and Stanford, {{replaced the}} sport with rugby. At the time, {{the future of}} football {{was very much in}} doubt and these schools believed that rugby would eventually be adopted nationwide. Other schools that made the switch included Nevada, St. Mary's, Santa Clara, and USC (in 1911). However, due to <b>the</b> <b>perception</b> <b>that</b> West Coast football was inferior to the game played on the East Coast anyway, East Coast and Midwest teams shrugged off the loss of the teams and continued playing football. With no nationwide movement, the available pool of rugby teams to play remained small. The schools scheduled games against local club teams and reached out to rugby powers in Australia, New Zealand, and especially, due to its proximity, Canada. The annual Big Game between Stanford and California continued as rugby, with the winner invited by the British Columbia Rugby Union to a tournament in Vancouver over the Christmas holidays, with the winner of that tournament receiving the Cooper Keith Trophy.|$|E
5|$|Since tool use is {{considered}} to be a key feature of primate intelligence, the apparent lack of this behavior in wild lemurs, as well as the lack of non-food object play, has helped reinforce <b>the</b> <b>perception</b> <b>that</b> lemurs are less intelligent than their simian cousins. However, another study at the Myakka City Lemur Reserve examined the representation of tool functionality in both the ring-tailed lemur and the common brown lemur and discovered that, like monkeys, they used tools with functional properties (e.g., tool orientation or ease of use) instead of tools with nonfunctional features (e.g., color or texture). Although the ring-tailed lemur may not use tools in the wild, it can not only be trained to use a tool, but will preferentially select tools based on their functional qualities. Therefore, the conceptual competence to use a tool may have been present in the common primate ancestor, even though the use of tools may not have appeared until much later.|$|E
