5|$|According to the Mexican authorities, {{the murder}} plot was {{possibly}} {{carried out with}} the collaboration of the Tijuana Cartel because no security measures were taken during the party and because the entrances were {{open to the public}} (when they are usually closed for private events).

Out of the 80 to 100 attendees, only 20 of them stayed, many of them family members and employees of the banquet hall. When the authorities interrogated those who stayed and asked them whether they had recognized <b>the</b> <b>assassin</b> or any other physical features, none of them were able to give any details. Some stated that they did not even pay attention to the clown when he entered the crime scene, while others stated that they did not even recall exactly what the clown was wearing, remembering only that <b>the</b> <b>assassin</b> was wearing a blue-stripped or purple shirt, a multicolored wig, and a red clown nose.|$|E
