500|$|During {{the early}} stages of her career, Perry's musical style gravitated towards gospel and she aspired to be as {{successful}} as Amy Grant. At the age of 15, she heard Queen's [...] "Killer Queen," [...] which inspired her to pursue a career in music. She cites the band's frontman, Freddie Mercury, as her biggest influence and expressed how the [...] "combination of his sarcastic approach to writing lyrics and his 'I don't give a fuck' attitude" [...] inspired her music. She paid homage to the band by naming her third fragrance Killer Queen. Perry described The Beach Boys and their album Pet Sounds as having a considerable influence on her music: [...] "Pet Sounds {{is one of my favorite}} records and it influenced pretty much all of my songwriting. All of the melody choices <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>make</b> are because of Pet Sounds." [...] The singer also holds the Beatles' album The Beatles in high esteem, and described these two albums as [...] "the only things I listened to for probably two years straight." ...|$|E
2500|$|On March 13, 1963, Ernesto Miranda was arrested, by the Phoenix Police Department, {{based on}} circumstantial {{evidence}} linking {{him to the}} kidnapping and rape of an eighteen-year-old woman ten days earlier. After two hours of interrogation by police officers, Miranda signed a confession to the rape charge on forms that included the typed statement: [...] "I do [...] hereby swear <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>make</b> this statement voluntarily and of my own free will, with no threats, coercion, or promises of immunity, and with full knowledge of my legal rights, understanding any statement I make may be used against me." ...|$|E
2500|$|Later that night, at the post-fight press conference, Érik further {{explained}} his reasoning for brawling with the Filipino slugger; [...] "It {{was a great}} pleasure to fight this way. I think I was controlling the fight with my distance. Sometimes I need to put a little flavor into the ring. My promoter always says <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>make</b> the fights very difficult, but they're not difficult, they're fun for the public. I decided to stop myself in front of him in the twelfth round because I wanted to give the public what they deserve. It was a great round. I'm very happy about it." ...|$|E

2500|$|On January 2, 2007, Beck said on {{his radio}} program that Ellison did not take offense at the {{comments}} and the two had a friendly chat off the air. On January 9, 2007, at the Television Critics Association's semiannual press tour, Beck said it was [...] "Quite possibly the poorest-worded question of all time." [...] He clarified by saying, [...] "My point to Keith Ellison... is the same point <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>make</b> to my own faith, and that is — you must stand up before things {{get out of control}} ... And it's important for people of all faiths, when someone is hijacking their religion, to stand and say, 'That is not what we do. That is not who we are."' ...|$|E
2500|$|Romney {{may have}} been {{challenged}} by voters with the concern that a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints would take commandments {{from the president of}} the church who is regarded as a living prophet. In an interview aired on Fox News Romney said, [...] "America has a political religion, which is to place the oath of office, an oath to abide by a nation of laws and the Constitution, above all others. And there's no question <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>make</b> that my primary responsibility." [...] Mike Otterson, an LDS spokesman, said, [...] "The suggestion that a Mormon leader would dictate policy to a President Romney is absurd. I can't imagine any president that would allow that." [...] During the 1960 presidential campaign of John F. Kennedy, similar allegations were made that a Roman Catholic would take orders from the Pope.|$|E
2500|$|Richey {{recalled}} {{that he met}} in Columbia with former Governor John McKeithen, who had been instrumental in Winters's election as national committeewoman. Richey found that the two were [...] "apparently ... on the outs ... {{at the time of}} our election. At one meeting ... he suggested <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>make</b> a big push with black voters by informing them that 'Mary Lou Winters was a member of not one, but two Lily-white country clubs.' That exact line appeared in campaign letters from me to black voters in the waning days of the election." [...] Richey ran first in the primary and defeated Mrs. Winters in the second balloting, 58-42 percent. Prior to the Senate election, Winters, a graduate of Louisiana State University, had been the chief lobbyist for the Louisiana State Medical Society, in which capacity she worked pro bono in 1975 to obtain passage of legislation to protect the medical profession against questionable lawsuits. Winters served for thirty-two years on the Democratic National Committee and attended all of the presidential nominating conventions during her tenure. In 1996, Winters was an elector for President Bill Clinton, who carried Louisiana in both of his elections. She was later the vice chairman of her state party.|$|E
