5|$|In March 1996, the US General Accounting Office (GAO) {{stated that}} it was cheaper to buy HarrierIIPlus {{aircraft}} outright than to remanufacture existing AV-8Bs. The USN estimated the cost for remanufacture of each aircraft to be US$23–30million, instead of $30million for each new-built aircraft, while the GAO estimated <b>the</b> <b>cost</b> <b>per</b> new aircraft at $24million. Nevertheless, the program continued and, in 2003, the 72nd and last AV-8B to be remanufactured for the USMC was delivered. Spain also participated in the program, the delivery of its last refurbished aircraft occurring in December 2003, which {{marked the end of}} the AV-8B's production; the final new AV-8B had been delivered in 1997.|$|E
5|$|Methods used {{to prevent}} malaria include medications, {{mosquito}} elimination and the prevention of bites. There is no vaccine for malaria. The presence of malaria in an area requires a combination of high human population density, high anopheles mosquito population density and high rates of transmission from humans to mosquitoes and from mosquitoes to humans. If any of these is lowered sufficiently, the parasite will eventually disappear from that area, as happened in North America, Europe {{and parts of the}} Middle East. However, unless the parasite is eliminated from the whole world, it could become re-established if conditions revert to a combination that favors the parasite's reproduction. Furthermore, <b>the</b> <b>cost</b> <b>per</b> person of eliminating anopheles mosquitoes rises with decreasing population density, making it economically unfeasible in some areas.|$|E
5|$|MetroAccess is a {{paratransit}} service which WMATA provides {{through private}} contractors. It began operation in May 1994 {{and since that}} time annual ridership has grown from 200,000 to more than 2.4 million passengers. MetroAccess operates 365 days a year, providing door-to-door, shared rides reserved from one to seven days in advance. It is now the sixth largest paratransit service in the United States with a fleet of more than 600 vehicles and more than 1,000 employees. WMATA staff determines eligibility to use the service in response to written applications. <b>The</b> <b>cost</b> <b>per</b> passenger for MetroAccess is significantly higher than its fixed-route counterparts, and Metro has worked to provide as many opportunities to encourage and facilitate the use of fixed-route transit by its customers with disabilities.|$|E
40|$|STUDY OBJECTIVES: To {{calculate}} cost-effectiveness of scenarios concerning lung transplantation in The Netherlands. DESIGN: Microsimulation model predicting survival, {{quality of}} life, and costs {{with and without}} transplantation program, based on data of the Dutch lung transplantation program of 1990 to 1995. SETTING: Netherlands, University Hospital Groningen. PATIENTS: Included were 425 patients referred for lung transplantation, of whom 57 underwent transplantation. INTERVENTION: Lung transplantation. RESULTS: For the baseline scenario, <b>the</b> <b>costs</b> <b>per</b> life-year gained are G 194, 000 (G=Netherlands guilders) and <b>the</b> <b>costs</b> <b>per</b> quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) gained are G 167, 000. Restricting patient inflow ("policy scenario") lowers <b>the</b> <b>costs</b> <b>per</b> life-year gained: G 172, 000 (<b>costs</b> <b>per</b> QALY gained: G 144, 000). The supply of more donor lungs could reduce <b>the</b> <b>costs</b> <b>per</b> life-year gained to G 159, 000 (G 135, 000 per QALY gained; G 1 =US 0. 6, based on exchange rate {{at the time of}} the study). CONCLUSIONS: Lung transplantation is an expensive but effective intervention: survival and quality of life improve substantially after transplantation. <b>The</b> <b>costs</b> <b>per</b> life-year gained are relatively high, compared with other interventions and other types of transplantation. Restricting the patient inflow and/or raising donor supply improves cost-effectiveness to some degree. Limiting the extent of inpatient screening or lower future costs of immunosuppressives may slightly improve the cost-effectiveness of the program...|$|R

5|$|The {{battleship}} race soon accelerated once more, {{placing a}} great {{burden on the}} finances of the governments which engaged in it. The first dreadnoughts were not much {{more expensive than the}} last pre-dreadnoughts, but <b>the</b> <b>cost</b> <b>per</b> ship continued to grow thereafter. Modern battleships were the crucial element of naval power in spite of their price. Each battleship was a signal of national power and prestige, {{in a manner similar to}} the nuclear weapons of today. Germany, France, Russia, Italy, Japan and Austria all began dreadnought programmes, and second-rank powers including the Ottoman Empire, Argentina, Brazil, and Chile commissioned dreadnoughts to be built in British and American yards.|$|E
5|$|In 1988, Pittston {{still felt}} {{the strain of}} {{providing}} benefits, with <b>the</b> <b>cost</b> <b>per</b> miner increasing by $3,746 from the 1979 amount. The company was still going into debt and having a difficult time paying for the miners' benefits. To avoid losing more money, Pittston doubled health deductibles, lowered the coverage from 100% to 80%, and discontinued benefits to miners who retired before 1974. This change {{in the health care}} plan was still not enough for the company to gain a profit, so they decided to keep the mines running 24hours a day and seven days a week, with no overtime for the workers. Pittston also did away with successorship clauses, which meant that the miners of Pittston would not have job security or transfer of job rights in mines that were leased or sold. Miners were now working longer hours with more expensive health care plans, while the mine was losing no production time because it was never closed.|$|E

30|$|When k increases, {{the optimal}} cycle time T^* and the minimum total {{relevant}} <b>cost</b> <b>per</b> unit time TC^* increase simultaneously.

This implies that, from managerial view point, if <b>the</b> ordering <b>cost</b> <b>per</b> order is reduced effectively, then <b>the</b> total <b>cost</b> <b>per</b> unit time could be reduced.

25|$|Many ASICs are pad-limited, {{meaning that}} the size of the die is {{constrained}} by the number of wire bond pads, rather than the complexity and number of gates used for the device logic.
