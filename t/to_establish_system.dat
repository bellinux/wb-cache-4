40|$|Large {{software}} systems commonly contain multiple interdependent components.

One promising way to do so is to automatically generate implicit invocation code for maintaining the invariant between dependent and independent components. However, since a complex system could have many invariants and performance requirements, the generated code must have a small runtime overhead. This paper explores eight separate approaches for the implementation of implicit invocation invariant maintenance in C++ using compile-time metaprogramming via OpenC++ and generative programming with C++ templates...|$|E
