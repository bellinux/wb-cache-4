To achieve this result and to make both elements simultaneous, the major part of the production had to hang on specially-constructed overhead steel tracks.

50|$|Between the Renaissance and the 16th century, {{actors and}} playwrights took upon {{themselves}} {{the handling of}} finances, general directorial duties, and stage management. Stage management first emerged as a distinct role in the 17th century during Shakespeare's and Molière's time, though it wasn't until the 18th century in England that <b>the</b> term <b>Stage</b> <b>Manager</b> was used. This {{was the first time}} a person other than actors and playwright was hired to direct or manage <b>the</b> <b>stage.</b> Over time, with the rise in complexity of theatre due to advances such as mechanized scenery, quick costume changes, and controlled lighting, <b>the</b> <b>stage</b> <b>manager's</b> job was split into two positions—director and <b>stage</b> <b>manager.</b>|$|R

25|$|Wilder wrote Our Town, {{a popular}} play (and later film) set in fictional Grover's Corners, New Hampshire. It was {{inspired}} by his friend Gertrude Stein's novel The Making of Americans, and many elements of Stein's modernist style {{can be found in}} the play. Wilder suffered from writer's block while writing the final act. Our Town employs a choric narrator called <b>the</b> <b>Stage</b> <b>Manager</b> and a minimalist set to underscore the human experience. Wilder played <b>the</b> <b>Stage</b> <b>Manager</b> on Broadway for two weeks and later in summer stock productions. Following the daily lives of the Gibbs and Webb families, as well as the other inhabitants of Grover's Corners, the play illustrates the importance of the universality of the simple, yet meaningful lives of all people in the world in order to demonstrate the value of appreciating life. The play won the 1938 Pulitzer Prize.|$|E
25|$|Walls and Lynn co-starred in the Aldwych productions, and Travers {{was careful}} to {{maintain}} the equilibrium of their stage partnership by ensuring that each had as many funny lines as the other. Initially, Travers found Walls difficult as an actor-manager, and also distressingly unprepared as an actor. But even Walls's calls to <b>the</b> <b>stage</b> <b>manager</b> for lines became a popular part of opening nights at the Aldwych.|$|E

In the event that <b>the</b> original <b>stage</b> <b>manager</b> could not run the show, a new one could use the prompt book to continue the show. A prompt book should be a complete record of the show and its production process so that if the show were to be remounted all the information needed would be contained in the prompt book. <b>The</b> <b>stage</b> management presentation will be a showcase of the prompt books used in A Christmas Carol and Nanawatai...|$|R

25|$|It took Travers {{some time}} to {{establish}} a satisfactory working relationship with Walls, whom he found difficult as an actor-manager, and also distressingly unprepared as an actor. In the early days he also had reservations about the other star of the company, Ralph Lynn, who initially ad-libbed {{too much for the}} author's taste. Travers built on each play, and the characterisations in the earlier plays, in writing the next farce for the company; and even Walls's calls to <b>the</b> <b>stage</b> <b>manager</b> for lines became a popular part of opening nights at the Aldwych.|$|E
25|$|Three {{years have}} passed, and George and Emily prepare to wed. The day {{is filled with}} stress. Howie Newsome is {{delivering}} milk in the pouring rain while Si Crowell, younger brother of Joe, laments how George's baseball talents will be squandered. George pays an awkward visit to his soon-to-be in-laws. Here, <b>the</b> <b>Stage</b> <b>Manager</b> interrupts the scene and takes the audience back a year, {{to the end of}} Emily and George's junior year. Emily confronts George about his pride, and over an ice cream soda, they discuss the future and their love for each other. George resolves not to go to college, as he had planned, but to work and eventually take over his uncle's farm. In the present, George and Emily say that they are not ready to marry—George to his mother, Emily to her father—but they both calm down and happily go through with the wedding.|$|E
500|$|The film {{received}} positive {{reviews in}} trade publications. The Moving Picture World review said. [...] "Probably {{the story of}} Rip Van Winkle as told by Washington Irving {{will always be a}} delight. Surely the Rip Van Winkle, as depicted by the late Joseph Jefferson, will linger long in the memory of those fortunate enough to have seen it. Unquestionably, however, the third in the list of delights is this film from Thanhouser which tells the story over again {{in much the same way}} that Jefferson told it. The Rip of Jefferson and the Rip of Irving are two different versions, though both do substantially the same things. ... It is a good piece of work from every standpoint. The actors have entered into the spirit of the story and have depicted it with close adherence to the facts as they are related in the original. <b>The</b> <b>stage</b> <b>manager</b> understood what was required to make the background appear natural, while the photographer handled the camera with full knowledge of the requirements." [...] The New York Dramatic Mirror reviewer also agreed and commended the film by stating, [...] "The Thanhouser Company has done very well with this old legend, paying particular attention to details. ... The acting is exceptionally good for a story representing that era of time, and the adaption is very clear to the spectator." ...|$|E

500|$|Brütal Legend {{follows the}} story of Eddie Riggs (voiced by Jack Black), who is [...] "the world's best roadie" [...] for [...] "the world's worst 'heavy metal' band", Kabbage Boy. Much of the game takes place in an unnamed world {{inspired}} by heavy metal music, created by, according to the game's mythology, Ormagöden, The Eternal Firebeast, Cremator of the Sky, and Destroyer of the Ancient World. In this alternate world, the human race is enslaved by a race of demons, led by Doviculus, Emperor of the Tainted Coil, (voiced by Tim Curry). Doviculus is assisted by his glam metal human minion, General Lionwhyte (voiced by Rob Halford and based on David Bowie with the name being an allusion to glammetal band White Lion) whose hair is so big [...] "and luscious" [...] that he uses it to fly, flapping it {{like a pair of}} broad wings. Leading the fight against Doviculus are a small band of human resistance fighters with whom Eddie joins forces: Lars Halford (voiced by Zach Hanks), his sister Lita (voiced by Kath Soucie), and Ophelia (voiced by Jennifer Hale), whom Eddie takes a romantic interest in. Their group is later joined by <b>the</b> <b>stage</b> <b>manager</b> Mangus (Alex Fernandez), the bass-playing healer Kill Master (voiced by, and patterned after Lemmy Kilmister), the motorcycle-riding Fire Baron (also voiced by Halford, as well as visually inspired by him too), and the Amazonian Rima (voiced by Lita Ford and based on KISS characters). Also supporting Eddie is the Guardian of Metal (voiced by Ozzy Osbourne, who also lent his appearance to the character) that assists in upgrading his equipment.|$|E
500|$|Sullivan, as {{had been}} {{arranged}} with Carte and Gilbert, gave notice to the partners of the Comedy Opera Company in early July 1879 that he, Gilbert and Carte would not be renewing the contract to produce Pinafore with them {{and that he would}} be withdrawing his music from the Comedy Opera Company on 31 July. In return, the Comedy Opera Company gave notice that they intended to play Pinafore at another theatre and brought a legal action against Carte and company. They offered the London and touring casts of Pinafore more money to play in their production, and although some choristers accepted their offer, only one principal player, Mr Dymott, accepted. They engaged the Imperial Theatre but had no scenery. On 31 July, they sent a group of thugs to seize the scenery and props during Act II of the evening performance at the Opera Comique. Gilbert was away, and Sullivan was recovering from an operation for kidney stones. Stagehands and cast members managed to ward off their backstage attackers and protect the scenery, although <b>the</b> <b>stage</b> <b>manager,</b> Richard Barker, and others, were injured. The cast went on with the show until someone shouted [...] "Fire!" [...] George Grossmith, playing Sir Joseph, went before the curtain to calm the panicked audience. The police arrived to restore order, and the show continued. Gilbert sued to stop the Comedy Opera Company from staging their rival production of H.M.S. Pinafore. The court permitted the production to go on at the Imperial, beginning on 1 August 1879, and it transferred to the Olympic Theatre in September. Pauline Rita was {{one of a series of}} Josephines. The production received good notices and initially sold well but was withdrawn in October after 91performances. The matter was eventually settled in court, where a judge ruled in Carte's favour about two years later.|$|E

2500|$|Nine {{years have}} passed. <b>The</b> <b>Stage</b> <b>Manager</b> opens the act with a lengthy {{monologue}} emphasizing eternity, bringing the audience's {{attention to the}} cemetery outside of town and the characters who have died since the wedding, including Mrs. Gibbs (pneumonia, while traveling), Wally Webb (burst appendix, while camping), Mrs. Soames, and Simon Stimson (suicide by hanging). Town undertaker Joe Stoddard is introduced, as {{is a young man}} named Sam Craig who has returned to Grover's Corners for his cousin's funeral. That cousin is Emily, who died giving birth to her and George's second child. Once the funeral ends, Emily emerges to join the dead; Mrs. Gibbs urges her to forget her life, but she refuses. Ignoring the warnings of Simon, Mrs. Soames, and Mrs. Gibbs, Emily returns to Earth to relive one day, her 12th birthday. The memory proves too painful for her, and she realizes that every moment of life should be treasured. When she asks <b>the</b> <b>Stage</b> <b>Manager</b> if anyone truly understands the value of life while they live it, he responds, [...] "No. The saints and poets, maybe—they do some." [...] Emily returns to her grave next to Mrs. Gibbs and watches impassively as George kneels weeping over her. <b>The</b> <b>Stage</b> <b>Manager</b> concludes the play and wishes the audience a good night.|$|E
