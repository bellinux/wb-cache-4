40|$|Background: Directly {{comparing}} {{gene expression}} profiles of estrogen receptor-positive (ER+) and estrogen receptor-negative (ER 2) breast cancers cannot determine whether differentially expressed genes {{between these two}} subtypes result from dysregulated expression in ER+ cancer or ER 2 cancer versus normal controls, and thus would miss critical information for elucidating the transcriptomic {{difference between the two}} subtypes. Principal Findings: Using microarray datasets from TCGA, we classified the genes dysregulated in both ER+ and ER 2 cancers versus normal controls into two classes: (i) genes dysregulated in the same direction but <b>to</b> <b>a</b> different extent, and (ii) genes dysregulated to opposite directions, and then validated the two classes in RNA-sequencing datasets of independent cohorts. We showed that the genes dysregulated <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>larger</b> <b>extent</b> in ER+ cancers than in ER 2 cancers enriched in glycerophospholipid and polysaccharide metabolic processes, while the genes dysregulated <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>larger</b> <b>extent</b> in ER 2 cancers than in ER+ cancers enriched in cell proliferation.

5|$|Homologous {{sequences}} are paralogous if {{they were}} created by a duplication event within the genome.

5|$|After {{the fall}} of Calais, factors outside of Edward's control forced him to wind down the war effort. In 1348, the Black Death struck England with full force, killing a third {{or more of the}} country's population. This loss of {{manpower}} led to a shortage of farm labour, and a corresponding rise in wages. The great landowners struggled with the shortage of manpower and the resulting inflation in labour cost. To curb the rise in wages, the king and parliament responded with the Ordinance of Labourers in 1349, followed by the Statute of Labourers in 1351. These attempts to regulate wages could not succeed in the long run, but in the short term they were enforced with great vigour. All in all, the plague did not lead to a full-scale breakdown of government and society, and recovery was remarkably swift.

40|$|In Jan Jagers and Stefaan Walgrave {{theory about}} {{populism}} {{as a political}} communication-style they claim that one can find this in the rhetoric of political parties.
