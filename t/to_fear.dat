5|$|The tornado {{prediction}} {{proved to}} be successful, even if its precision was mostly due to chance. Before this point, the Weather Bureau had a policy against issuing tornado warnings, mainly due <b>to</b> <b>fear</b> of panic by the public, and subsequent complacency if forecasts {{turned out to be}} false alarms.|$|E

Several models and photographers {{working at the}} same agency as the dead girl are also murdered, leading two surviving photographers <b>to</b> <b>fear</b> for their lives {{as they try to}} track down the killer.|$|E
5|$|Back on June 6, when a {{civilian}} miner {{was killed by}} raiders {{near the village of}} Blue Mounds in the Michigan Territory, residents began <b>to</b> <b>fear</b> that the Rock River Ho-Chunks were joining the war. On June 20, a Ho-Chunk raiding party estimated by one eyewitness to be as large as 100 warriors attacked the settler fort at Blue Mounds. Two militiamen were killed in the attack, one of whom was badly mutilated.|$|E

5|$|Dava Sobel {{argues that}} prior to Galileo's 1633 trial and {{judgement}} for heresy, Pope Urban VIII had become preoccupied with court intrigue and problems of state, and began <b>to</b> <b>fear</b> persecution or threats to his own life. In this context, Sobel argues {{that the problem of}} Galileo was presented to the pope by court insiders and enemies of Galileo. Having been accused of weakness in defending the church, Urban reacted against Galileo out of anger and fear.|$|E
5|$|During the 1950s {{when the}} Belgians began <b>to</b> <b>fear</b> {{that the rise}} of a {{powerful}} Luba elite would become a threat to colonial rule, the administration began to support Lulua organisations. This further contributed to the growing ethnic polarisation between the two groups. In 1952, an organisation called the Lulua Frères (Lulua Brothers) was established to campaign for socio-economic advancement of the Lulua group and became an unofficial representative of the Bena Lulua.|$|E
5|$|Ike began <b>to</b> <b>fear</b> {{that word}} of his {{possible}} cooperation had leaked, threatening to compromise his standing among the Cowboys. Undercover Wells Fargo Company agent M. Williams suspected a deal, {{and said something}} to Ike, who was fearful that other Cowboys might learn of his double-cross. Ike now began to threaten Wyatt and Doc Holliday (who had learned of the deal) for apparently revealing Ike's willingness to help arrest his friends.|$|E

5|$|John Baldwin was {{a person}} whose views seemed {{to run counter to}} the {{conventional}} customs of the time. Despite his accomplishments, he never wrote a book, held public office, or even kept books. Although he was not an abolitionist by definition, he had no problem teaching blacks and whites as equals, as evident by his opening Baldwin Institute without regard to race or gender. His parents taught him <b>to</b> <b>fear</b> God, and he consequently devoted himself to living humbly and righteously, to being kind to the poor, and to joining the Methodist Church.|$|E
5|$|Katniss and {{the rebels}} learn that Peeta is alive, {{though he is}} being {{tortured}} by the Capitol {{in an attempt to}} demoralize and control Katniss. When a rescue team succeeds in extracting him, they discover that Peeta has been brainwashed, programmed <b>to</b> <b>fear</b> and despise Katniss. After he attempts to kill her, he is kept restrained under heavy guard at all times, while medics seek a cure.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Homer starts <b>to</b> <b>fear</b> that Maggie {{could die}} from {{touching}} things unsafe {{to her when}} he hears this from a childproofing saleswoman. As a result, he starts his own childproofing crusade, selling cheap but safe and effective products and making Springfield safe for children. However, this causes the baby-injury-related business in Springfield to go in decline. Homer feels bad for making people such as pediatricians lose their jobs and thus he ends his childproofing career.|$|E

The country's high crime rate led islanders <b>to</b> <b>fear</b> for their belongings should they abandon their homes. UNICEF prepared 4emergency health kits and 1,000water containers and Copa Airlines agreed to fly the supplies to Jamaica on its scheduled August 22 flight, if possible. The World Food Program prepared food stock in nearby Haiti, ready to move them to Jamaica if they were needed, although damage to their airport ultimately prevented their distribution.|$|E
5|$|Relations with France were {{important}} after World War I {{and in the}} 1920s, as France {{played a leading role}} in the new European security arrangements. In the 1930s France started <b>to</b> <b>fear</b> the rise of Nazi Germany and initiated a rapprochement with the Soviet Union, which strained Franco-Finnish relations. However, during the Winter War France was one of the most important suppliers of military materiel.|$|E
5|$|The evacuation, {{which had}} been delayed for months, was {{initiated}} due <b>to</b> <b>fear</b> of the Red Army advances during the East Prussian Offensive. Some parts of the evacuation were planned as a military necessity, Operation Hannibal being the most important military operation involved in the evacuation. However, many refugees took to the roads on their own initiative because of reported Soviet atrocities against Germans in the areas under Soviet control. Both spurious and factual accounts of Soviet atrocities were disseminated through the official news and propaganda outlets of Nazi Germany and by rumors that swept through the military and civilian populations.|$|E

5|$|The move 6.Nf3 {{controls}} the e5-square {{in order to}} prepare the push f4–f5.

Nh4 8.Ng5!, when the black knight is already {{in danger of being}} lost to Qd1–g4 or Qd1–h5. Instead Black must react quickly with 6...Bb4+ 7.Nc3 when he can adopt a normal setup with d6/0-0/Nc6/b6 or act boldly with 7...Qf6 threatening both the Nc3 and the f4-pawn. One point in favour of 7...Qf6 is that after 8.e5 Qb6 the black queen prevents White from castling short and is well placed if White castles long.|$|E

The more populous King County {{is also in}} the lahar area, but currently has no zoning restrictions due to volcanic hazard. More recently (since 2001) funding from the federal government for lahar protection in the area has dried up, leading local authorities in at-risk cities like Orting <b>to</b> <b>fear</b> a disaster similar to the Armero tragedy.|$|E
5|$|Vermigli {{was widely}} {{respected}} and very cautious. He {{was able to}} continue his reform efforts in Lucca without any suspicion of unorthodox views, despite a papal meeting there with Emperor Charles V in 1541. His eventual downfall was caused by two of his followers, one of whom openly questioned papal authority and another who celebrated a Protestant form of the Eucharist. The reconstitution of the Roman Inquisition in 1542 {{may have been in}} part a response <b>to</b> <b>fear</b> that Lucca and other cities would defect from the Catholic Church. The authorities of the Republic of Lucca began <b>to</b> <b>fear</b> that their political independence from the Holy Roman Empire was at stake if their city continued to be viewed as a Protestant haven. Bans on Protestant books heretofore ignored were enforced, religious feasts which had been dropped were reinstated, and religious processions were scheduled to assure Rome of Lucca's loyalty.|$|E

5|$|While {{economic}} policies were the original motivating {{factor in the}} growing partisan split, foreign policy also became a factor. Though most Americans supported the French Revolution prior to the Execution of Louis XVI, some of Hamilton's followers began <b>to</b> <b>fear</b> the radical egalitarianism of the revolution as it became increasingly violent. Washington particularly feared British entrance into the war, as he worried that sympathy for France and hatred for Britain would propel the United States into the French Revolutionary Wars, to the ruin of the American economy. In 1793, after Britain entered the French Revolutionary Wars, several Democratic-Republican Societies were formed. These societies, centered {{on the middle class}} of several eastern cities, opposed Hamilton's {{economic policies}} and supported France. Conservatives came <b>to</b> <b>fear</b> these societies as populist movements that sought to re-make the class order. That same year, the British began attacking American ships that were trading with France, fanning the flames of anti-British sentiment. As Washington continued to seek peace with Great Britain, critics finally began to attack the president himself.|$|E
5|$|Although fortifications {{could still}} be {{valuable}} in times of war, they had played only a limited role during the Wars of the Roses and, when Henry VII invaded and seized the throne in 1485, he had not needed to besiege any castles or towns during the campaign. Henry rapidly consolidated his rule at home and had few reasons <b>to</b> <b>fear</b> an external invasion from the continent; he invested little in coastal defences {{over the course of}} his reign. Modest fortifications existed along the coasts, based around simple blockhouses and towers, primarily in the south-west and along the Sussex coast, with a few more impressive works in the north of England, but they were very limited in scale.|$|E
5|$|Bart and his catchphrase {{continue}} to be popular, while Krusty creates {{a wide array of}} merchandise featuring Bart's likeness. Bart becomes sick of his fame and begins <b>to</b> <b>fear</b> that the fad will wear off, so he tries to expand his act and personality during an interview on Conan O'Brien's late-night talk show, to no avail. Bart decides to stop performing, but Marge convinces him that he should continue because he makes people happy. Bart arrives at Krusty's show and enthusiastically delivers his line, but the audience is bored with the line and does not react. With fans no longer interested in Bart, Krusty ditches him.|$|E
