These mice are {{less susceptible to}} poliovirus infection through the intracerebral route, possibly because <b>they</b> <b>express</b> decreased levels of hPVR.

5|$|Atman is the {{predominantly}} discussed {{topic in the}} Upanishads, but <b>they</b> <b>express</b> two distinct, somewhat divergent themes. Some state that Brahman (Highest Reality, Universal Principle, Being-Consciousness-Bliss) is identical with Atman, while others state Atman is part of Brahman but not identical. This ancient debate flowered into various dual, non-dual theories in Hinduism. The Brahmasutra by Badarayana (~ 100 BCE) synthesized and unified these somewhat conflicting theories, stating that Atman and Brahman are different in some respects particularly during the state of ignorance, but at the deepest level and {{in the state of}} self-realization, Atman and Brahman are identical, non-different.|$|E

Some Swiss government authorities responded to Raëlians' views about Sensual Meditation with {{a fear that}} Raëlians are a threat to public morals for supporting liberalized sex education for children. <b>They</b> <b>express</b> the view that such liberalized sex education teaches youngsters how to obtain sexual gratification which would encourage sexual abuse of underage children.|$|E

5|$|Until {{his final}} years, Wagner's life was characterised by {{political}} exile, turbulent love affairs, poverty and repeated flight from his creditors. His controversial writings on music, drama and politics have attracted extensive comment, notably, {{since the late}} 20th century, where <b>they</b> <b>express</b> antisemitic sentiments.

5|$|The {{development}} of such tools {{has been driven}} by the large amount of genomic and proteomic data available for a variety of organisms, including the human genome. It is simply impossible to study all proteins experimentally, hence only a few are subjected to laboratory experiments while computational tools are used to extrapolate to similar proteins. Such homologous proteins can be efficiently identified in distantly related organisms by sequence alignment. Genome and gene sequences can be searched by a variety of tools for certain properties. Sequence profiling tools can find restriction enzyme sites, open reading frames in nucleotide sequences, and predict secondary structures. Phylogenetic trees can be constructed and evolutionary hypotheses developed using special software like ClustalW regarding the ancestry of modern organisms and the genes <b>they</b> <b>express.</b> The field of bioinformatics is now indispensable for the analysis of genes and proteins.|$|E

25|$|Whether BBB {{dysfunction}} is {{the cause}} or the consequence of MS is disputed, because activated T-Cells can cross a healthy BBB when <b>they</b> <b>express</b> adhesion proteins. Apart from that, activated T-Cells can cross a healthy BBB when <b>they</b> <b>express</b> adhesion proteins. (Adhesion molecules could {{also play a role}} in inflammation) In particular, one of these adhesion proteins involved is ALCAM (Activated Leukocyte Cell Adhesion Molecule, also called CD166), and is under study as therapeutic target. Another protein involved is CXCL12, which is found also in brain biopsies of inflammatory elements, and which could be related to the behavior of CXCL13 under methylprednisolone therapy. Some molecular biochemical models for relapses have been proposed.|$|E

Anyone who clearly withholds a dissenting view only to obstruct the implementation later should be held responsible.|$|E
