60|$|DEARTH. No, I am rather fond of him, our lonely, {{friendly}} little host. Lob, I <b>thank</b> <b>thee</b> <b>for</b> <b>that</b> hour.|$|R

60|$|I wish {{to begin}} this time at the beginning, lest I forget it altogether; that is to say, I wish to <b>thank</b> <b>you</b> <b>for</b> this welcome <b>that</b> <b>you</b> are giving, and the welcome which you gave me seven years ago, and which I forgot to <b>thank</b> <b>you</b> <b>for</b> at <b>that</b> time.

60|$|Studying {{the gorilla}} last {{night for the}} twentieth time, it {{suddenly}} came into my head that I had never <b>thanked</b> <b>you</b> <b>for</b> <b>that</b> admirable treatise.

But happily you do not know, and I {{am not going to}} tell you.|$|R

60|$|MY DEAR HENLEY,--I {{hope and}} hope for a long letter--soon I hope to be {{superseded}} by long talks--and it comes not. I remember I have never formally <b>thanked</b> <b>you</b> <b>for</b> <b>that</b> hundred quid, nor in general for the introduction to Chatto and Windus, and continue to bury you in copy {{as if you were}} my private secretary. Well, I am not unconscious of it all; but I think least said is often best, generally best; gratitude is a tedious sentiment, it's not ductile, not dramatic.|$|R

6000|$|... 'Now that I {{have seen}} him I do so completely. And another thing I have to <b>thank</b> <b>you</b> <b>for,</b> Violet, <b>that</b> <b>you</b> saved me from laying it on any thicker in that {{criticism}} of his poetry.' ...|$|R
