25|$|At Bristol, {{the visiting}} captain Stephen Fleming from Nottinghamshire won the toss and chose to bat—a wise choice, {{as it turned}} out, as only Mark Hardinges took wickets, but he conceded many runs in the process, {{finishing}} with four for 115. Gloucestershire were toothless, conceding 28 runs off no-balls, while their No. 5 David Hussey was deprived of a century when the team collapsed around him, finishing on 98 not out. With a run rate of above four in their 469 all out, <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>putting</b> pressure on the hosts, who started sedately without losing wickets. However, a spell from Ryan Sidebottom resulted in three wickets falling with only one run being scored, and that gave Northamptonshire the edge in the game. Gloucestershire were eventually bowled out for 250, as Mark Ealham removed the tail with three for 26 off 16 overs (with ten maidens), and, being forced to follow on, Gloucestershire lost both openers before stumps to have scored three runs for two wickets.|$|E
25|$|Whilst on {{the surface}} the new Potsdamer Platz appears so far to have {{lived up to its}} {{expectations}} as a futuristic centre of commerce at the heart of Europe's youngest capital city, there has been much debate as to just how successful it really is. Certainly its long term success and viability have become much harder to judge since the recent worldwide economic downturn, a situation compounded by the actions of its two principal owner-occupiers. Daimler and Sony caused a major surprise on 2 October 2007 when both announced that <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>putting</b> their respective complexes at Potsdamer Platz on the market. Whilst neither intended to move out, both felt it preferable to rent the space from new owners rather than continue to be the owners themselves (and so be responsible for the buildings' upkeep and maintenance). Daimler had recently come through a painful separation from their former American subsidiary Chrysler and needed a quick injection of cash in order to refocus on automotive production. Ironically, the announcement came on the ninth anniversary of their complex's official opening, a fact not lost on many people. Sony meanwhile, put their decision down to a need to review their global strategy {{in the face of a}} fast-changing worldwide economic climate. The implications for Potsdamer Platz were ominous, with suggestions that overall confidence in the project was faltering, and more pessimistic claims that the development had largely failed in its original intentions.|$|E

500|$|Critics and {{a doctor}} have {{dismissed}} Six's claim that the film was [...] "100 percent medically accurate" [...] as [...] "ludicrous" [...] and [...] "rubbish". Dr John Cameron, speaking to TV3 News in New Zealand gave an interview about the feasibility of a human centipede, stating how he believed {{it would be difficult}} for a join between different people to heal and form a connection, and how the centipede would quickly die from lack of nutrition. John Martin, a former Hollywood film executive and CEO of Alamo Drafthouse Cinemas said Six's claims of 100 percent medical accuracy should be viewed with reference to the kind of shock gimmicks that film producers had long used to attract attention. Martin compared Six's claims to those of Kroger Babb and William Castle who had also made [...] "grand promises" [...] about what <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>putting</b> on screen in a bid to lure audiences.|$|E

2500|$|AIDS {{was seen}} as a disease of gay, White, North American men. And people were really afraid of it. There were no {{treatments}} available in the Caribbean at the time, so AIDS really was a death sentence. You had people with Kaposi's sarcoma, people with violent diarrhea, who were just wasting away and then dying in really horrible and traumatic ways. To call what was going on here [...] "stigma and discrimination" [...] was really an understatement. In the ghettos <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>putting</b> tires around people who had AIDS and lighting the tires on fire. They were killing gay people because they thought AIDS was contagious. It was a very extreme environment, and really horrible things were happening.|$|E

[...] The unions have further announced that the new entity would target further mergers with labor groups in Australia and in the emerging economies of Asia, Latin America and Eastern Europe. On July 2, 2008, USW and Unite leadership formally signed the merger agreement to create the new entity, to be called Workers Uniting.|$|E
2500|$|Construction of {{the campus}} was reliant on the college being able to obtain a £21 million grant from the Learning and Skills Council.

LSC then announced that they would launch a cost-cutting programme. There were worries that the Riverside scheme could be classed as a [...] "rebuild" [...] by LSC, who had announced that a small number of [...] "rebuild" [...] projects would receive full funding. In July 2009, Sutton Coldfield College learned that it was not one of the thirteen shortlisted colleges to receive funding, placing the Riverside project in jeopardy as the college would only be able to apply for funding next in 2011.|$|E
