5|$|Nash {{himself was}} asked by the College to design a new {{building}} near fashionable Trafalgar Square but Nash's elaborate plan proved too costly and ambitious for the College.

When Nash heard that another architect was approached behind his back he reacted vehemently, and attacked the heralds. The College nevertheless continued with their plans. However they were constantly beset by conflicts between the different officers over the amount needed <b>to</b> <b>build</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> building. By 1827 the college still had no coherent plan; the Duke of Norfolk ordered the College to drop the matter altogether. By 1842 the heralds were reconciled with their location and once again commissioned Abraham <b>to</b> <b>build</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> octagonal-shaped Record Room {{on the site of the}} old Sugar House.|$|E
5|$|On 5 April 1969 {{the ballroom}} was {{destroyed}} by fire, the cause of which is unknown.
