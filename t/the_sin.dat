40|$|The Divina Commedia (1308 - 1321) {{has been}} hailed {{as one of}} the {{greatest}} and most influential literary works in history, and one of the characteristics that puts it in the annals of time is Dante’s mastery of Catholic theological ideals, especially <b>the</b> Seven Cardinal <b>Sins,</b> his artistry in portraying them, and his mix of unique and traditional depictions. Dante utilizes both traditional and unique artistic aspects of <b>the</b> Seven Cardinal <b>Sins</b> to provide both structure and to put moral messages in his greatest work, but in order to be aware of Dante’s deep understanding of <b>the</b> <b>Sins</b> and how he shapes them to his use, a reader should understand the similarities and differences between the general views of <b>the</b> <b>Sins</b> and <b>the</b> view presented by Dante in Purgatorio. Although some of <b>the</b> <b>Sins</b> are also found in Inferno, not all of them can be found, and they are not used to provide structure as in Purgatorio. The first section of this thesis looks at the evolution of <b>the</b> <b>Sins</b> as can be discerned through academic research by tracing key moments beginning with the origins until <b>the</b> <b>Sins</b> became incorporated into Catholic theology. The second section discusses the influence of <b>the</b> <b>Sins</b> throughout Catholic Europe during the medieval ages. The third section discusses the metaphysical philosophy of <b>the</b> <b>Sins</b> given in Purgatorio, which includes what they are, where they come from, and what to do about them, and compares it to other possible philosophies of <b>the</b> <b>Sins.</b> <b>The</b> last section analyzes a few allegories used to strengthen the portrayal of <b>the</b> <b>Sins</b> in <b>the</b> cornices of Pride, Sloth, and Lust, which are used to represent the three categories of misdirected love. The combination of these four aspects of <b>the</b> <b>Sins</b> and Purgatorio allows the reader to achieve a greater understanding of Dante’s mastery of the concept of <b>the</b> <b>Sins</b> in Purgatorio...|$|R

5|$|After half-time, Leicester {{increased}} their lead with a converted try from Geordan Murphy after 45 minutes {{and two more}} penalties from Dupuy extended Leicester's lead further to 26–12 going into the last 20 minutes.

First, Craig Newby was shown a yellow card on 62 minutes for killing the ball during a Cardiff attack, and then Geordan Murphy was shown a yellow card on 68 minutes for what was adjudged to be a deliberate knock-on during another Cardiff attack. Leicester did not concede during Newby's absence, but shortly after his return and with Murphy still off the pitch in <b>the</b> <b>sin</b> bin, Cardiff's Jamie Roberts scored a try with Ben Blair successfully kicking the conversion from within five metres of the touchline. At the restart, Cardiff gathered the ball and Roberts made a break from within 22 metres of Cardiff's own goal line before passing to Tom James, who ran 60 metres to score a try in almost exactly the same place as Roberts. Blair again kicked the conversion from the touchline to tie the scores at 26–26 with three minutes remaining. With no further scores, the match went into extra time.|$|E

5|$|Augustine's Acts or Disputation Against Fortunatus the Manichaean, {{which partly}} {{touches on the}} problem of evil, records a public debate between Augustine and the Manichaean teacher Fortunatus. Fortunatus criticised Augustine's theodicy by proposing that if God gave free will to the human soul, then he must be implicated in human sin (a problem that Augustine had himself {{considered}} four years earlier, in Free Will). Quoting the New Testament, Fortunatus proposed that evil exists beyond the evil acts people commit, and that people commit such acts because of their own flawed nature. Augustine replied by arguing that <b>the</b> <b>sin</b> of Adam constrained human freedom, in a way similar to the formation of habits. This was not a teaching on original sin (a view that Augustine was yet to formulate), but on the limitations of human freedom caused by sin. Fortunatus proposed that Augustine was reducing the scope of evil only to what is committed by humans, though Augustine writes that Fortunatus finally conceded the debate when he admitted that he could not defend his views on the origin of evil.|$|E
