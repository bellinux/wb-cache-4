40|$|Cloth is {{a common}} {{material}} which exhibits complex, anisotropic reflection behavior. Because cloth is such an important material class in human-centric environments, many models have attempted to describe its appearance. This thesis aims to clarify {{the state of the}} art of cloth rendering by comparing two recent models, by Irawan et al. and by Sadeghi et al., which both describe cloth as woven microcylinders. We fit each of these models to a set of measured fabrics and link the resulting differences to theoretical elements of the models. Through this comparison, we find that Sadeghi's model is able to more closely match the appearance of complex fabrics. Additionally, we present measurements of 8 fabric samples, which exhibit several different structural characteristics. These samples include woven, knitted, nap and pile fabrics. Sadeghi's model is used to reproduce the appearance of the samples. This both allows us to further evaluate this model, and expands the library of cloth types which Sadeghi's model has been used to describe. We find the model to be largely successful in matching the samples, although we also discover a key limitation inherent to woven cloth models. To address this, we suggest an extension, called the <b>thread</b> <b>direction</b> curve which would further generalize the model. The measurements in this thesis have been included in a supplementary archive...|$|E

The model is critical {{for the design of}} PRSM with a smaller lead and a bigger pitch to realize a higher transmission accuracy. The kinematic principle of planetary transmission is employed to analyze the PRSM with different screw thread and roller <b>thread</b> <b>directions.</b> In order to investigate the differences with different screw thread and roller <b>thread</b> <b>directions,</b> the numerical model is developed by using the software Adams to validate the analytical solutions calculated by the presented model.

In addition, the automatic technique must take into account the variations in thread angles to extract the thread count. The resulting angle maps readily indicate the presence of weak and strong cusping. The weft-thread angle map in particular provides additional insights into the canvas weaving process and can be used to elaborate weave matches...|$|R

The free space method, when conductive fabric samples of 50 x 50 cm 2 were placed between transmitting and receiving antennas, was used to imitate a practical application.

40|$|The {{present study}} arose {{out of a}} desire to test the {{assumption}} that in order to obtain direct stencils with good edge definition, one either had to use fine screens or. If using a relatively coarse screen, apply multiple coatings of emulsion to the screen before making the stencil. Neither alternative seemed satisfactory, since the first did not allow optimal use of the scope of screens available, and the second entailed an expenditure of time and supplies that could possibly be shown to be unnecessary. It was therefore determined to carry on an experiment that would show whether direct stencils with good edge definition can be obtained on relatively coarse screens with only one, or at most two applications of emulsion. The experiment thus envisioned also provided an opportunity to observe the influence on two other factors on stencil edge definition, besides those of mesh count and emulsion thickness: namely, screen thread diameter and coater blade thick ness. What finally evolved was a three-factor, three-levelled factorial experiment, in which the variables under study were* screen mesh count, thread diameter and emulsion thick ness. The fourth factor came into play when the experiment was run once for emulsions applied with a thick-bladed coater, and once for those applied with a thin-bladed coater. The specific question under study was: in the direct stencil system, is there a difference in the quality of edge definition obtainable with variations in screen mesh count, screen thread diameter, coater blade thickness and the number of emulsion coatings applied? Eighteen screens were stretched expressly for the experiment, representing three different mesh counts and three different thread diameters for each mesh count. Each screen was prepared {{in such a way as}} to receive three stencils of varying thickness per screen. All stencils were exposed to a test target designed to allow for the observation of diagonal and parallel stencil edges (i. e., diagonal or parallel with relation to screen <b>thread</b> <b>direction).</b> After the stencils were made, they were visually inspected, and the data obtained thereby was subjected to an analysis of variance. The results obtained showed that of the four factors studied, mesh count was the only one that made a clear difference in the quality of stencil edge definition. What the experiment did not conclusively show was whether or not coater blade thickness had any influence on that quality. Nevertheless, what is perhaps of greater significance to the printer in Industry Is that the experiment did show that on a coarse screen a stencil with good parallel edge definition could be obtained with only one coating of emulsion (as one coating was defined in the experiment) ...|$|E

50|$|Typically, an {{electric}} motor is mechanically connected to rotate a lead screw. A lead screw has a continuous helical thread machined on its circumference running along the length (similar to the thread on a bolt). Threaded onto the lead screw is a lead nut or ball nut with corresponding helical threads. The nut is prevented from rotating with the lead screw (typically the nut interlocks with a non-rotating part of the actuator body). Therefore, when the lead screw is rotated, the nut will be driven along the <b>threads.</b> The <b>direction</b> of motion of the nut depends on the direction of rotation of the lead screw.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Automatic {{recognition}} of scanned images of distorted bi-axial fiber bundle arrangements is considered {{in order to}} obtain the overall permeability of the formed fiber network. Scanned images are pre-processed with color normalization followed by usage of a threshold to find the pixels belonging to the bundles, the threads keeping the bundles together, and the distinct gaps formed between the bundles. Since the scanned images virtually have a perfect grayscale, the intensity can be treated as a corresponding signal of the image. Next the regular character of the fiber network is investigated using Fourier analysis on the fiber bundles {{as well as on the}} <b>threads.</b> The <b>direction,</b> position, and spatial separation of the fiber bundle and the threads are obtained in this way. In order to recognize the bottom fiber bundle layer a fine structure technique is used. Small clusters falsely identified as belonging to the bottom bundle layer are removed by application of a threshold to the perimeter of the cluster. The gaps in the top bundle layer are identified more clearly in this way. Next, a local Fourier analysis is applied to obtain the local distortion of the bundle and the thread structure yielding the characteristic distribution of the gaps between the bundles. Finally the distribution of the width of the threads is obtained by simply identifying the minimal distance between the sides of the threads.

40|$|Multiple threads in SMT {{processor}} share {{resources to}} increase resource utilization and im-prove overall performance. At the same time, they compete {{against each other}} for the shared resources, causing resource monopolization or underutilization. Therefore, resource scheduling mechanism is important because it determines the throughput as well as fairness of the simulta-neously running threads in SMT processor. To achieve optimal SMT performance, all the earlier mechanisms schedule resources based on a couple of indicators, such as cache miss count, pre-decoded instruction count, or resource demand/occupancy. Those indicators trigger scheduling actions, expecting improved performance. However, since combinations of indicators can not cover all possible cases of threads behavior, earlier mechanisms may face a situation where the expected positive correlation between the indicators and the performance becomes weak, losing the chance of performance improvement. In this paper, we developed a novel methodology using hill-climbing or gradient descent algorithm to find the optimal resource share of simultaneously running threads.

40|$|Graduation date: 1989 Twenty-four woven Pre-Columbian {{textiles}} in the Apparel, Interiors and Merchandising Department (AIM) of Oregon State University {{were reported}} to be from Ancon, Peru. A methodology was developed to confirm the exact provenance of the AIM textiles. Technical fabrication characteristics were utilized to describe certain known Ancon woven textiles and to analyze the twenty-four AIM textiles; then comparisons were attempted {{between the two groups}} to determine if internal patterns for each were identical. A literature and collection survey identified ten documented reports of known Ancon woven textiles. The previously recorded information of the known Ancon pieces was summarized. Technical fabrication characteristics for each AIM textile were observed and recorded. The technical fabrication characteristics included weave structure, thread count, fiber content, direction of spin, ply, degree of twist, yarn diameter, color and motif. Frequencies and especially developed analysis tools were utilized to identify internal patterns. Hypothesis 1 stated that information about the technical fabrication elements of Ancon woven textiles in certain other collections can be organized into integrated patterns. Hypothesis 1 was not supported because data recorded on Ancon woven textiles was incomplete, and therefore only able to give limited frequencies. Hypothesis 2 was supported: The twenty-four woven Pre-Columbian textiles from the Costume and Textile Collection of the Apparel, Interiors and Merchandising Department of Oregon State University will have similar patterns in technical fabrication elements. An analysis tool was developed to show patterns within technical fabrication elements. <b>Thread</b> count, <b>direction</b> of spin, ply, and degree of twist exhibited internal patterns. Hypothesis 3 stated that the provenance of twenty-four woven Pre-Columbian textiles, from the Costume and Textile Collection of the Apparel, Interiors and Merchandising Department of Oregon State University is Ancon, Peru. This hypothesis could not be tested because technical fabrication patterns for the known Ancon weavings were not complete and could not be statistically analyzed.

The work began with a study of literature focusing on current research within the topic, mainly to create a base of knowledge before the testing was initiated. Studies of scientific articles reveals a lack of research within this area, which makes it difficult to develop standards and calculation models for these joints.

The BPs in the TR have a spatial scale of about 350 - 580 km and lifetime {{of more than}} several tens of minutes. They are located at stronger magnetic structures in the filament channel, with magnetic flux of about 10 ^ 17 - 10 ^ 18 Mx. Quasi-periodic brightenings and upflows are observed in the BPs and the period is about 4 - 5 min. The BP and the associated jet-like upflow comprise a "tadpole-shaped" structure. The upflows move along bright filament <b>threads</b> and their <b>directions</b> are almost parallel to {{the spine of the}} filament. The upflows initiated from the BPs with opposite polarity magnetic fields have opposite directions. The velocity of the upflows in plane of sky is about 5 - 50 km s^- 1. The emission line of Si IV 1402. 77 Å at the locations of upflows exhibits obvious blueshifts of about 5 - 30 km s^- 1, and the line profile is broadened with the width of more than 20 km s^- 1. The BPs seem to be the bases of filament threads and the upflows are able to convey mass for the dynamic balance of the filament. The "counter-streaming" flows in previous observations may be caused by the propagation of bi-directional upflows initiated from opposite polarity magnetic fields. We suggest that quasi-periodic brightenings of BPs and quasi-periodic upflows result from small-scale oscillatory magnetic reconnections, which are modulated by solar p-mode waves.

40|$|It {{is known}} that workers’ {{financial}} participation, primarily {{in the form of}} wider participation of employees in profits and ownership, has been used in enterprises from many years, but in practice the period of implementation of different forms of financial participation has taken place only in the last four decades. Workers’ participation in decision-making has a longer tradition, so it is well described in the literature, {{and its impact on the}} results achieved by companies are known through the many research projects conducted by researchers around the world and through detailed reports. Financial participation has not been the focus of so many papers, so the knowledge and information from this area is incomplete. This is because of the lack of comprehensive studies on the various forms of participation, their irregularity, the lack of cooperation between states in the exchange of information concerning the number of implemented solutions, etc. Of course, it is not possible to include all of the companies in research and the results cannot be generalized due to the different conditions and selection criteria in particular countries. Also, the ambiguous interpretation of the term “financial participation” by different authors and different institutions does not allow for setting up and developing the output database necessary to conduct the research and carry out comparisons. In the literature, programs of financial participation are treated as an incentive system, without taking into account the wider context and the relationships between these programmes and the results achieved by the company. This contribution aims to give some theoretical and scientific examples, which, by virtue of their nature and severity can contribute to the possible diverse research solutions to the problems facing businesses, especially in today's dynamic, global economy. After forty years of empirical research on the benefits of the implementation of various programmes of financial participation, the information provided, in principle, only in the form of reports, is not sufficient to express opinions on the development of forms of participation. At the same time, it is concluded that the programmes of financial participation have had a positive effect on the results achieved by companies, especially in terms of social benefits. Arriving at the above opinion has been additionally impeded by the different attitudes of the social partners to the issue of participation and participatory approaches, the absence of explicit data showing the relationship between implemented financial schemes and financial results, changes in the competitive position of enterprises, etc. The outlined theory concerning how the workers’ ownership affects economic performance achieved by a company unfortunately has not changed.

40|$|In the {{emerging}} aield of molecular machines, a molecular ratchet is a chemical {{system that allows}} the positional displacement of a submolecular component of be captured and directionally released. In information ratchets, the track over which a Brownian particle is to be transported is {{able to respond to}} the particle’s position. By raising energetic barriers to translation selectively behind the particle, it is possible to move the particle in a forward direction. This Thesis describes the development of a series of chemically-­‐driven information ratchets based on rotaxane architectures. Acylation of the rotaxane thread presents an impassible kinetic barrier to macrocycle shuttling. The incorporation of chiral centres into the thread allows the macrocycle’s position to {{have an effect on the}} kinetics of acylation in a chiral environment, with the result that the macrocycle is transported by successive acylation reactions in a direction speciaied by the handedness of a chiral. In Chapter One the physical principles of molecular motors are examined. It is shown that molecular motors are a subset of the much broader class of “triangular” reactions investigated by Onsager in 1931. Progress in the exciting aield of artiaicial chemical ratchets and motors is reviewed, and the deep connections between molecular motors and the cyclic reaction networks postulated to explain the origin of biological homochirality are explored. Chapter Two describes the synthesis and operation of a three-­‐compartment rotaxane information ratchet in which the macrocycle can be transported along a <b>thread</b> in either <b>direction</b> depending on the handedness of a chiral catalyst. Internal mechanisms of operation are elucidated by treating the system as a hidden Markov process. Chapter Three describes the synthesis and operation of a second-­‐generation three-­‐compartment information ratchet. A comparison between this system and that of the previous chapter sheds light on the complicated trade-­‐offs between kinetics and thermodynamics when these molecular ratchets are operated. In Chapter Four the ongoing efforts to construct extended information ratchets, incorporating many repeat units, are described. The synthesis of a aive-­‐ compartment information ratchet proved unexpectedly difaicult owing to problems of solubility. A four-­‐compartment rotaxane was easier to synthesise. Preliminary aindings suggest that an information ratchet mechanism is operating in this four-­‐compartment system...|$|R
40|$|The Internet of Things is {{the biggest}} {{challenge}} and opportunity for the Internet today. An application of the IoT is a home automation system. The idea consists of IP-enabled embedded devices connected to the Internet using IPv 6. The IETF added to this idea by defining 6 LoWPAN as a technique to apply IPv 6 to IEEE 802. 15. 4, a low-power wireless network standard. The existing home automation wireless technologies and products in the market {{do not meet the}} requirements of low power, resilience, IP-based, security and friendly use. With the goal of advance in this <b>direction</b> <b>Thread</b> is a simplified, IPv 6 -based mesh networking protocol developed for efficient communication between devices around the home. It connects to the internet and provides simple yet robust interface to the cloud. Thread stack is royalty-free but closed-documentation (payment). With the aim to make broadly available this to developers sharing their know-how, Nest released an open-source implementation of Thread protocol named OpenThread on May 2016 to make the technology used in its products available and accelerate the development of new devices for the connected home. The objective of the present study is to analyze this brand new coming technology, focusing on the released implementation and make some tests in a real platform describing where possible the routing details. The goal of the implementation phase is to have a working bench ready to test and validate some of the Thread functionalities specially the routing parameters and changes of topology. The implementation phase has been done using a hardware testbed. We address the configuration of the test scenario on both hardware and software levels. This allow us to develop some tests such as the basic connectivity between devices, checking the visibility of the nodes and the revision of the routing tables. Finally, through different captures, we will analyze the behavior after some changes of scenario. Performing these tests was very complex {{due to the lack of}} information that prevent us of making more advanced tests, especially those related to the routing and comparison with other protocols. Instead, we were able to perform some basic tests such as check connectivity, see routing tables, etc. With the current OpenThread implemented functionalities the next step could be study more thoroughly the part of the routing, as well as study upper layers such as commissioning roles in a Border Router, allowing to interact from outside the Thread network...|$|R
5000|$|... (Original description) The {{shell is}} large for the genus. It is {{composed}} of eight very angular whorls, which form a sharp pointed, regularly tapered, turreted spire. The protoconch is very small, regularly coiled, consisting of {{two and a half}} shining, light yellow whorls in striking contrast to the dull, rough surface peculiar {{to the rest of the}} shell. The first one and a half whorls are perfectly smooth, while the last one is crossed by minute, transverse riblets. The suture is marked by a conspicuous, rounded, undulating cingulus (= coloredbands or spiral ornamentation) or thread on the preceding whorl. The sculpture consists of prominent, straight, angular, alternating ribs (nine on the body whorl), forming a conspicuous node at the angle, extending from suture to suture. These, with their deeply concave interspaces, are crossed by unequal, conspicuous, well-rounded, granulated cinguli and microscopic threads. The first cingulus, defining the shoulder of the whorls, is double with the upper half slightly the larger, the sutural one is the next in size, while between these there are two still finer ones. These are unequally distant from each other, the first and second being much closer together than the others, and the intervening surfaces are covered by unequal, microscopic threads. Above the angle of the whorls the threads alone occur and number about nine. This inequality in the spiral sculpture makes the edges of the transverse ribs very rough and jagged. On the body whorl there are about thirteen cinguli below the shoulder, unequal in size and unequally separated, those on the siphonal canal larger and closer together than those just above it, while the fourth one below the angle is so prominent as to make a slight angle in the outline of the whorl. Below this angle the transverse ribs curve in toward the columella following the outline of the outer lip, and extend to the end of the siphonal canal, the curvature being most noticeable in a dorsal view. Very fine striae intersect the cinguli and the <b>threads</b> in the <b>direction</b> of the lines of growth, rendering them granular and give the appearance to the shell, when dry, of being covered with a fine, gray dust. The aperture is long, narrowly ovate, with a moderately long, rather narrow siphonal canal. The outer lip is not thickened, and shows a comparatively thin edge and a broad, moderately deep sinus extending from the suture to the angle. The columella is slightly curved. The inner lip is marked by a narrow stripe of conspicuous red enamel. The color of the shell is light yellow-brown. The interior of the aperture is of the same conspicuous red color as the inner lip. In young specimens this coloring is wanting.|$|R

Striped cloths {{appear as}} painting supports from the 16 th to the 20 th century {{in and outside}} Europe. These are mostly flax matress ticking, woven into varieties of twill (diagonal weave) and especially reverse twill (herringbone). Only few historical mattresses have been preserved, e. g. those in royal palace interiors {{such as the one}} in Hampton Court in London. Dark blue striped pattern appeared on mattresses as early as the Antiquity, and the terminology for the twill fabrics used (also) for mattress making originated in this period in the regions ruled by the Roman Empire. Reasons for the use of various types of fabrics, including the mattress ticking as painting supports, are not investigated enough, but it does appear that their availability and economic reasons were often the only selection criteria. Although it is impossible to make general conclusions, some documents and examples indicate that the twill fabrics were used for exceptionally large paintings. In the context of painting, mattress ticking is mentioned in Flemish, English and French documents and painter’s manuals published from the 17 th to the 19 th century. In Ita ly, Istria, Dalmatia and Spain, the historical terms for the twill fabrics used for making mattresses and work clothes (traliccio, terlise, trliš, terliz etc.) is of Latin origin (trilix) and initially did not denote the fabric’s designation but {{had to do with the}} type of weave. Variants of these terms are mentioned in the trading documents and archives of textile manufacturers in north Italy, and in connection with the painting commissions in 16 th- and 17 th-century Italy and Spain. The studies of painting supports in Flemish and Dutch art of the 17 th and 18 th century provide the most details about paintings on mattress ticking, with detailed accounts of canvases by Maarten de Vos, Pieter Pieters, Nicolas de Liemaker and Pieter Johannes van Reysschoot. The weave is described as a warp-faced reverse twill (chevron) 3 / 1. The earliest example of a painting on a mattress ticking from blue-striped reverse twill that is known to the author is The Battle of the Spurs by an unknown artist, made in England around 1540 (Hampton Court Palace, London). Also in England, Anthony van Dyck painted several extraordinarily large pieces, and there are known works by other artists on this type of canvas from the 17 th, 18 th and 19 th century. In France, artists had from the 17 th to the 20 th century sometimes painted on a similar support, among them Philippe de Champaigne and François Boucher. The author is aware of only two examples of paintings on canvas with blue stripes in Italy. The paper also touches upon the issue of research of painting canvases. The technology of making a painting, the natural processes of deterioration and historical alterations and treatments make analyses of the structure, colour and finishing difficult, and by that also make it hard to determine the original characteristics and designation of the fabric the painter had used. With still few specialist studies which would have differing approaches to canvas research, the analytical parameters are sometimes hard to compare or apply. Although their number is in continual decline, in Dalmatia there are still paintings that haven 2 ̆ 7 t been restored i. e. lined. Given that indirect methods of analysis of the original canvases for lined paintings still have limitations, amid their many possibilities, each unlined painting represents a precious possibility to study the history of painting supports but also of historical textiles. The differentiation between the warp and the weft is a precondition for a comparison of the parameters of painting canvases; however, selvedges of the fabric are relatively rarely preserved. According to a study by van der Wetering, the differences in the quality of threads that can be seen with some types of handwoven canvases are for the time being the most reliable criterion for differentiating between the warp and weft. The second criterion, that is applicable to canvases without the visible difference in the quality of threads, is the difference in the number of threads. The comparative analysis of several 17 th- and 18 th-century canvases from Dalmatia included these parameters: dimensions of the canvas support, width of the fabric, direction of the warp, description of the characteristics of <b>threads</b> in both <b>directions,</b> number of <b>threads</b> of the warp and weft by centimetre, type and unit of the weave, description of the striped pattern. Parameters for painting canvases are difficult to compare according to the place and time of their origin. They vary considerably within the same period and region, even within a single artist’s body of work. Depending on their original designation, they differ in the quality of the material and making, as well as in the type of weave and treatment. Among Dalmatian examples of 17 th- and 18 th-century paintings on the canvas for mattresses, the one from Šibenik is the oldest. Compared to examples from abroad, it is also among the earliest ones. Out of forty paintings on striped canvas from the 16 th – 18 th century in England, Holland, Belgium, France and Italy, the most were authored by 17 th-century Flemish artists (twenty eight). Judging by the information and examples collected in the research, striped cloths for mattresses with twill pattern from abroad that were described in the paper are much finer than those from Dalmatia (have more threads per cm) and the fabrics are much wider, but they are mostly large-size paintings. With a little over a half of the cases, the warp was set in the length direction of the painting. From the photographs of the canvases of several foreign examples it is evident that the paintings were done on the face of the fabric where the herringbone pattern is more pronounced, as well as the blue stripes. Although this could lead to a conclusion that the choice of the fabric face was a conscious one, owing to its texture, the reasons need to be examined more closely. All Dalmatian paintings featured here were also painted on the fabric face – except the one from Brač that was composed of several assorted pieces of cloth – and with the warp facing opposite directions and the fabric face on opposing sides. Also, there can be observed a rather different relation toward the texture of the canvas – some artists leave it visible, others cover it in a thick painted layer. For now it appears that this research too leads to the conclusions of earlier studies of painting canvases – the reason for choosing striped mattress ticking as painting support may well have been its availability in a certain size, at a particular moment in history...|$|R
