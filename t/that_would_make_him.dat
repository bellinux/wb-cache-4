5|$|Filming for The Terminator was set {{to begin}} in early 1983 in Toronto, but was halted when {{producer}} Dino De Laurentiis applied an option in Schwarzenegger's contract <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>make</b> <b>him</b> unavailable for nine months while he was filming Conan the Destroyer.

25|$|He {{then did}} {{well with the}} bat in a one-dayer.

25|$|In 1863 Albert Bierstadt was at {{the peak}} of a career <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>make</b> <b>him</b> America’s top {{landscape}} artist. Ludlow considered Bierstadt’s landscapes representative of the best American art of the era and used his position as art critic at the New York Evening Post to praise them.|$|E
25|$|When {{asked whether}} he was a deva or a human, he replied that he had {{eliminated}} the deep-rooted unconscious traits <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>make</b> <b>him</b> either one, and should instead be called a Buddha; one {{who had grown up}} in the world but had now gone beyond it, as a lotus grows from the water but blossoms above it, unsoiled.|$|E
25|$|Argentine garage bands {{sprung up}} {{in the wake of}} the early days of rock and roll. Most notable among them was Sandro y Los de Fuego, who {{recorded}} a successful series of Spanish language covers of rock and roll hits from that time, and attained commercial popularity. Sandro would soon embark on his own contemporary pop standards career <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>make</b> <b>him</b> popular internationally.|$|E

25|$|Soon after The Future {{transformed}} into The Human League, Oakey as lead singer wanted a look <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>make</b> <b>him</b> {{stand out from}} other lead singers. After spotting a girl on a Sheffield bus with a Veronica Lake hairstyle, Oakey was inspired to adopt a strange lopsided geometric hairstyle, shoulder length {{on one side and}} short on the other. Between 1978–1979 with his unique hairstyle, he maintained a masculine dress style and at one time wore a full beard.|$|E
25|$|Fuller {{taught at}} Black Mountain College in North Carolina during the summers of 1948 and 1949, serving as its Summer Institute {{director}} in 1949. There, {{with the support}} of a group of professors and students, he began reinventing a project <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>make</b> <b>him</b> famous: the geodesic dome. Although the geodesic dome had been created some 30 years earlier by Dr. Walther Bauersfeld, Fuller was awarded United States patents, even though he neglected to cite Bauersfeld's prior art in his patent applications. He is credited for popularizing this type of structure.|$|E
25|$|The CCP {{was still}} small at the time, having a {{membership}} of just 300 in 1921 and only 1,500 by 1925. By contrast, the Kuomintang in 1922 already had 150,000 members. Soviet advisers also helped the Kuomintang {{set up a}} political institute to train propagandists in mass mobilization techniques, and in 1923 sent Chiang Kai-shek, one of Sun's lieutenants from Tongmenghui days, for several months' military and political study in Moscow. After Chiang's return in late 1923, he participated {{in the establishment of}} the Whampoa Military Academy outside Guangzhou, which was the seat of government under the Kuomintang-CCP alliance. In 1924 Chiang became head of the academy and began the rise to prominence <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>make</b> <b>him</b> Sun's successor as head of the Kuomintang and the unifier of all China under the right-wing Nationalist Government.|$|E

25|$|Born {{and raised}} in Alabama, Blount {{eventually}} {{became involved in the}} Chicago jazz scene during the 1940s. He soon abandoned his birth name, taking the name Sun Ra (after Ra, the Egyptian God of the Sun) and developing a complex persona and mythology <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>make</b> <b>him</b> a pioneer of Afrofuturism: he claimed he was an alien from Saturn on a mission to preach peace, and throughout his life he consistently denied any ties to his prior identity. His widely eclectic and avant-garde music would eventually touch on virtually the entire history of jazz, ranging from swing music and bebop to free jazz and fusion, and his compositions ranged from keyboard solos to big bands of over 30 musicians. From the mid-1950s until his death, Ra led the musical collective The Arkestra (which featured artists such as Marshall Allen, John Gilmore and June Tyson throughout its various iterations). Its performances often included dancers and musicians dressed in elaborate, futuristic costumes inspired by ancient Egyptian attire and the Space Age.|$|E
500|$|The {{financial}} and critical failure of The Narrative of Arthur Gordon Pym of Nantucket {{was a turning}} point in Poe's career. For one, he was driven to literary duties <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>make</b> <b>him</b> money, notably his controversial role as editor of The Conchologist's First Book in April 1839. He also wrote a short series called [...] "Literary Small Talk" [...] for a new Baltimore-based magazine called American Museum of Science, Literature and the Arts.|$|E
500|$|In 1988, the Beatles were {{inducted}} into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, {{their first year of}} eligibility. Harrison and Starr attended the ceremony with Lennon's widow, Yoko Ono, and his two sons, Julian and Sean. McCartney declined to attend, citing unresolved [...] "business differences" [...] <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>make</b> <b>him</b> [...] "feel like a complete hypocrite waving and smiling with them at a fake reunion". The following year, EMI/Capitol settled a decade-long lawsuit filed by the band over royalties, clearing the way to commercially package previously unreleased material.|$|E

60|$|Tom Platt's huge {{rubber boot}} whirled across the fo'c'sle and caught Dan's uplifted arm. There was {{war between the}} man and the boy ever since Dan had {{discovered}} that the mere whistling of <b>that</b> tune <b>would</b> <b>make</b> <b>him</b> angry as he heaved the lead.|$|R
500|$|In total 16 {{people were}} murdered by Burke and Hare. Burke stated {{later that he}} and Hare were [...] "generally {{in a state of}} intoxication" [...] when the murders were carried out, and that he [...] "could not sleep at night without a bottle of whisky by his bedside, and a twopenny candle to burn all night beside him; when he awoke he would take a drink from the bottle—sometimes half a bottle at a draught—and <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>make</b> <b>him</b> [...] sleep." [...] He also took opium to ease his conscience.|$|E
500|$|When Jackson {{left the}} U.S. {{to go into}} rehabilitation, the media showed him little sympathy. The Daily Mirror held a [...] "Spot the Jacko" [...] contest, {{offering}} readers a trip to Disney World if they could correctly predict where the entertainer would appear next. A Daily Express headline read, [...] "Drug Treatment Star Faces Life on the Run", while a News of the World headline accused Jackson of being a fugitive. These tabloids also falsely alleged that Jackson had traveled to Europe to have cosmetic surgery <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>make</b> <b>him</b> unrecognizable on his return. Geraldo Rivera set up a mock trial, with a jury made up of audience members, even though Jackson had not been charged with a crime.|$|E
500|$|While Braun's outfield {{experience}} {{until then}} had consisted of [...] "two games {{in center field}} my freshman year in high school," [...] Braun had speed, arm strength <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>make</b> <b>him</b> stand out against other left fielders, and athleticism to make the transition. [...] Early reports were good, as in spring training in 2008 he showed an ability to cover ground, go back on the ball, to his left into the gap, and to his right to cut off balls down the line. Braun looked good tracking liners and high fly balls, and took good routes when cutting off balls down the line or in the gap, holding batters to singles. In March 2008 Manager Ned Yost said that Braun has been [...] "spectacular" [...] in left, and [...] "he's got an opportunity one day to win a Gold Glove in left field. He certainly does." ...|$|E
60|$|Nothing more passed at the time, {{but that}} night, as Nicholas sat beside his bed, Smike started from what {{had seemed to}} be a slumber, and laying his hand in his, prayed, as the tears coursed down his face, <b>that</b> he <b>would</b> <b>make</b> <b>him</b> one solemn promise.|$|R

500|$|More than 90 players {{decided to}} sign with foreign teams during the lockout. The New York Times called the {{migration}} of players overseas [...] "one of the most overblown stories of the lockout" [...] with a majority of those signing being [...] "rookies, middling veterans and fringe players". Deron Williams was the only 2011 All-Star going overseas, signing a one-year contract for $5 million to play for Beşiktaş of the Turkish Basketball League. Former first overall draft pick Kenyon Martin, a free agent, signed a one-year contract with the Xinjiang Flying Tigers of the Chinese Basketball Association <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>make</b> <b>him</b> the highest paid player in the league's history at $500,000 a month. Unlike players who signed more lucrative contracts overseas, three-time NBA champion Tony Parker opted {{to play for the}} minimum wage of $2,000 per month with ASVEL Basket, the French team he partly owns. Parker joined several foreign players, such as Leandro Barbosa, Boris Diaw, Rudy Fernández, Andrei Kirilenko and Mehmet Okur, who opted to play in their home countries until the lockout ended.|$|E
500|$|... "Love and Death" [...] sees two guest {{stars who}} were {{personally}} {{involved with the}} cast and crew. Dermot Crowley, portrayer of Eric Newland, was the husband {{of one of the}} series' casting directors, though Crowley still had to earn his role. Barnaby Kay plays Ruth's potential love interest; Kay was Nicola Walker's real-life boyfriend, now her husband. Andy Serkis guest stars as Riff in [...] "Celebrity". Created as an eccentric character, the producers believed it would fit in with Serkis' acting. Owen Teale appears as Robert Morgan in [...] "Frequently Asked Questions". Producer Andrew Woodhead stated that Teale has a [...] "strong physicality" [...] <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>make</b> <b>him</b> a suitable equal for Adam. The series finale [...] "The Suffering of Strangers" [...] saw the introduction of two new characters that would receive expanded roles in the fourth series. Raza Jaffrey portrays Zafar Younis. Jaffrey's first day of filming required him to perform a difficult speech he had to [...] "launch into." [...] In addition James Dicker portrays Wes Carter, Adam and Fiona's seven-year-old son. The producers held discussions whether to introduce Wes in the finale or in the fourth series; they eventually chose the former.|$|E
500|$|Jackson {{began taking}} painkillers, Valium, Xanax and Ativan {{to deal with}} the stress of the {{allegations}}. A few months after the allegations became news, Jackson stopped eating. Soon after, Jackson's health deteriorated {{to the extent that he}} cancelled the remainder of his tour and went into rehabilitation. Jackson booked the whole fourth floor of a clinic and was put on Valium IV to wean him from painkillers. The media showed Jackson little sympathy. In 1993, The Daily Mirror held a [...] "Spot the Jacko" [...] contest, offering readers a trip to Disney World if they could correctly predict where Jackson would appear next. The same year, a Daily Express headline read [...] "Drug Treatment Star Faces Life on the Run", while a News of the World headline accused Jackson of being a fugitive; these tabloids also falsely alleged that Jackson had travelled to Europe to have cosmetic surgery <b>that</b> <b>would</b> <b>make</b> <b>him</b> unrecognisable on his return.

50|$|Following {{two years}} {{where he was}} blighted by {{recurring}} injuries, O'Neill agreed to undergo surgery {{before the end of}} 2007 to resolve a complex knee tendinitis condition.
