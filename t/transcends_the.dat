5|$|While {{employing}} anekāntavāda, the 17th century Jain scholar Yasovijaya {{stated that}} it is not anābhigrahika (indiscriminate attachment to all views as being true), which is effectively a kind of misconceived relativism.

5|$|In {{the darkest}} night of hate and {{intolerance}} we see impossible love stories conquering what our governments and societies declare is legally 'allowed' to be love...

It leaves room for failure but hopes for success.|$|E
5|$|The Canadian National Vimy Memorial {{site has}} {{considerable}} sociocultural significance for Canada. The idea that Canada's {{national identity and}} nationhood were born out of the Battle of Vimy Ridge is an opinion that is widely repeated in military and general histories of Canada. Historian Denise Thomson suggests that {{the construction of the}} Vimy memorial represents the culmination of an increasingly assertive nationalism that developed in Canada during the interwar period. Hucker suggests that the memorial <b>transcends</b> <b>the</b> Battle of Vimy Ridge and now serves as an enduring image of the whole First World War, while expressing the enormous impact of war in general, and also considers that the 2005 restoration project serves as evidence of a new generation's determination to remember Canada's contribution and sacrifice during the First World War.|$|E

5|$|The head {{is celebrated}} as {{a mark of}} {{identity}} as well as source of the seed. Thus, the self-decapitation represents removal of maya (illusion or delusion), physical attachment, false notions, ignorance, and egoism. The scimitar also signifies severance of these obstacles to moksha (emancipation), jnana (wisdom), and self-realization. The goddess also denotes discriminating perception. Chhinnamasta allows the devotee to gain a consciousness that <b>transcends</b> <b>the</b> bonds of physical attachment, the body, and the mind by her self-sacrifice. One interpretation suggests that her three eyes represent the sun, the moon, and fire while another links the third eye to transcendental knowledge. Unlike other Hindu deities who are depicted facing the devotee, Chhinnamasta generally looks at herself, prompting the devotee to look within him- or herself.|$|E

25|$|There are {{a number}} of plot {{similarities}} between Wells's book and The Battle of Dorking.

25|$|Through pilgrimages, which create {{networks}} connecting places regionally {{as well as}} over larger distances, Maya religion <b>transcends</b> <b>the</b> {{limits of}} the local community. Nowadays, pilgrimages often involve reciprocal visits of the village saints (as represented by their statues), but also visits to farther-removed sanctuaries, as exemplified by the Q'eqchi' pilgrimages to their thirteen sacred mountains. Around 1500, Chichen Itza used to attract pilgrims from all the surrounding kingdoms to its large cenote; other pilgrims visited local shrines, {{such as those of}} Ix Chel and other goddesses on the islands off Yucatán's east coast.|$|E
25|$|However, {{a number}} of renowned Kabbalists claimed the exact opposite, {{stressing}} universality of all human souls and providing universal interpretations of the Kabbalistic tradition, including its Lurianic version. In their view, Kabbalah <b>transcends</b> <b>the</b> borders of Judaism and {{can serve as a}} basis of inter-religious theosophy and a universal religion. Rabbi Pinchas Elijah Hurwitz, a prominent Lithuanian-Galician Kabbalist of the 18th century and a moderate proponent of the Haskalah, called for brotherly love and solidarity between all nations, and believed that Kabbalah can empower everyone, Jews and Gentiles alike, with prophetic abilities.|$|E
25|$|Humberto Maturana and Francisco Varela {{originally}} {{coined the}} concept of autopoiesis within theoretical biology to describe the self-reproduction of living cells through self-reference. This concept was later borrowed, reconstructed in sociological terms, and introduced into the sociology of law by Niklas Luhmann. Luhmann's systems theory <b>transcends</b> <b>the</b> classical understanding of object/subject by regarding communication (and not 'action') as the basic element of any social system. He breaks with traditional systems theory of Talcott Parsons and descriptions based on cybernetic feedback loops and structural understandings of self-organisation of the 1960s. This allows him to work towards devising {{a solution to the}} problem of the humanised 'subject'.|$|E

25|$|Isaac of Nineveh was a 7th-century Assyrian {{bishop and}} theologian best remembered for his written work. He is also {{regarded}} as a saint in the Church of the East, the Catholic Church, the Eastern Orthodox Church and among the Oriental Orthodox Churches, making him the last saint chronologically to be recognised by every apostolic Church. His feast day falls on January 28. Isaac is remembered for his spiritual homilies on the inner life, which have a human breadth and theological depth that <b>transcends</b> <b>the</b> Nestorian Christianity of the Church to which he belonged. They survive in Syriac manuscripts and in Greek and Arabic translations.|$|E
25|$|Some modern deists have {{modified}} this classical {{view and}} believe that humanity's relationship with God is transpersonal, which means that God <b>transcends</b> <b>the</b> personal/impersonal duality and moves beyond such human terms. Also, this means that {{it makes no sense}} to state that God intervenes or does not intervene, as that is a human characteristic that God does not contain. Modern deists believe that they must continue what the classical deists started and continue to use modern human knowledge to come to understand God, which in turn is why a human-like God that can lead to numerous contradictions and inconsistencies is no longer believed in and has been replaced with a much more abstract conception.|$|E
25|$|Every type of experiential content {{belonging}} to samsara and nirvana has, as its very basis, a natural {{state that is}} a spontaneously present buddha—a dimension of purity and perfection, that is perfect by nature. This natural state is not created by a profound buddha nor by a clever sentient being. Independent of causality, causes did not produce it and conditions can not make it perish. This state is one of self-existing wakefulness, defying all that words can describe, {{in a way that}} also <b>transcends</b> <b>the</b> reach of the intellect and thoughts. It is within the nonarising vastness of such a basic natural state that all phenomena {{belonging to}} samsara and nirvana are, essentially and without any exception, a state of buddha—purity and perfection.|$|E
