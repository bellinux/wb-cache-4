Of particular importance is the bond of relationship marketing between suppliers (principals) and retailers (<b>travel</b> <b>agents)</b> in the distribution channel. The research was undertaken to: determine whether Eastern Cape <b>travel</b> <b>agents</b> perceive relationship marketing as important; establish, what the key elements of relationship marketing strategies are,according to literature; determine what marketing strategies are currently applied by Eastern Cape travel agents; provide guidelines to Eastern Cape <b>travel</b> <b>agents</b> to implement or improve their relationship marketing strategies. Fifty self-administered questionnaires were distributed to {{the entire population of}} <b>travel</b> <b>agents</b> in the Eastern Cape. A total of 30 <b>travel</b> <b>agents</b> responded. The empirical findings showed that: Most Eastern Cape <b>travel</b> <b>agents</b> perceived relationship marketing as important; <b>Travel</b> <b>agents</b> realized the importance of the management of such relationship marketing strategies; Most <b>travel</b> <b>agents</b> were aware of or used retention strategies to enhance relationship marketing strategies; <b>Travel</b> <b>agents</b> realized that to survive relationship marketing should be part of their future planning; All respondents believed that to successfully implement relationship marketing, all staff, from front-line to top-management, need to be committed to the programme.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} a study which uses {{sociolinguistics}} approach to analyze the apology strategies used by <b>travel</b> <b>agents</b> in responding to a complaint. This study {{is trying to figure}} out the differences between the male <b>travel</b> <b>agents</b> toward the client and the female <b>travel</b> <b>agents</b> toward the client in the use of apology strategies. Furthermore, it will also describe the possible reasons of the differences made by the male <b>travel</b> <b>agents</b> and the female <b>travel</b> <b>agents.</b> Hence, the data are taken from the utterances produced by the male <b>travel</b> <b>agents</b> and the female <b>travel</b> <b>agents</b> when they converse with the client. To interpret the findings, the data are analyzed by classifying the responses into the categories formulated by Trosborg's Apology Strategies and analyzed with the theories on Gender in Language. From the interpretation and conclusion of the analysis, it can be seen that almost all strategies formulated by Trosborg appear in the response of the male <b>travel</b> <b>agents</b> and the female <b>travel</b> <b>agents.</b> Moreover, the difference in the use of apology strategies appear in the conversations and it can be assumed that the female <b>travel</b> <b>agents</b> are likely to be more co-operative in explaining and the male <b>travel</b> <b>agents</b> look more concern to the client. Thus, the existence of apology strategies can be considered as an important matter to serve as a bridge to bring a social harmony in society. All in all, it seems that the posibble factors which have big roles in underlying the differences in this responding to a complaint situation is not only sex factor but also culture and experience...|$|R

40|$|Online Booking: An {{opportunity}} or {{a threat}} to retail <b>travel</b> <b>agents?</b> Year after year, the booking preferences for independent travelers are diverging towards online booking.

The {{purpose of this paper is}} to propose the investment in online-booking technology as an opportunity to retail <b>travel</b> <b>agents,</b> enabling them to overcome the threats of direct reservation on their business. In this context, we will refer to previous studies and researches that evaluate the impacts of the macro environment, on the business of <b>travel</b> <b>agents.</b> A research study about online-booking led us to believe that, despite its negative impacts, investing in online-booking technology can still create a competitive advantage for <b>travel</b> <b>agents.</b> Research outcomes should shed light on the understanding of the new trends in the tourism industry...|$|R

The convenience sampling method was used for both the distribution of questionnaires to the tourists at the Paro International Airport and also for semi-structured interviews conducted with the <b>travel</b> <b>agents</b> and the Association of Bhutanese Tour Operators.
