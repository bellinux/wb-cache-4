5000|$|Active Denial System is a {{millimeter}} wave source that heats {{the water in}} the target's skin and thus causes incapacitating pain. It is being used by the U.S. Air Force Research Laboratory and Raytheon for riot-control duty.

25|$|Platelets {{are stored}} under {{constant}} agitation at 20–24°C (68–75.2°F). Units {{can not be}} refrigerated as this causes platelets to change shape and lose function. Storage at room temperature provides an environment where any bacteria that are introduced to the blood component during the collection process may proliferate and subsequently cause bacteremia in the patient. Regulations are {{in place in the}} United States that require products <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>tested</b> <b>for</b> the presence of bacterial contamination before transfusion.|$|E
25|$|Marmite {{today is}} {{fortified}} with added vitamins, resulting in it being banned temporarily in Denmark, which disallows foodstuffs {{that have been}} fortified until they have undergone necessary testing. The Danish Veterinary and Food Administration stated in 2015 that Marmite had not been banned in the country, but that fortified foods need <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>tested</b> <b>for</b> safety and approved {{before they can be}} marketed in the country. In 2014, suppliers applied for a risk assessment to be undertaken after which Marmite became available in Denmark.|$|E
25|$|Platelets {{are either}} {{isolated}} from collected units of whole blood and pooled {{to make a}} therapeutic dose, or collected by platelet apheresis: blood is taken from the donor, passed through a device which removes the platelets, and the remainder is returned to the donor in a closed loop. The industry standard is for platelets <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>tested</b> <b>for</b> bacteria before transfusion to avoid septic reactions, which can be fatal. Recently the AABB Industry Standards for Blood Banks and Transfusion Services (5.1.5.1) has allowed for use of pathogen reduction technology {{as an alternative to}} bacterial screenings in platelets.|$|E

25|$|S. agalactiae, {{or group}} B Streptococcus, GBS, causes {{pneumonia}} and meningitis in neonates and the elderly, with occasional systemic bacteremia. They can also colonize the intestines {{and the female}} reproductive tract, increasing the risk for premature rupture of membranes during pregnancy, and transmission of the organism to the infant. The American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (formerly the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists), American Academy of Pediatrics, and the Centers for Disease Control recommend all pregnant women between 35 and 37 weeks gestation <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>tested</b> <b>for</b> GBS. Women who test positive should be given prophylactic antibiotics during labor, which will usually prevent transmission to the infant.|$|E
25|$|Hence, while {{initially}} considered safe, {{the drug}} was responsible for teratogenic deformities in children born after their mothers used it during pregnancies, prior to the third trimester. In November 1961, thalidomide {{was taken off the}} market due to massive pressure from the press and public. Experts estimate that the drug thalidomide led to the death of approximately 2,000 children and serious birth defects in more than 10,000 children, about 5,000 of them in West Germany. The regulatory authorities in East Germany did not approve thalidomide. One reason for the initially unobserved side effects of the drug and the subsequent approval in West Germany was that at that time drugs did not have <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>tested</b> <b>for</b> teratogenic effects. They had been tested on rodents only, as was usual at the time.|$|E

500|$|Black {{meets with}} another Group member, Peter Watts (Terry O'Quinn) to {{investigate}} {{the death of a}} man found surrounded by six pints of spilt blood, with no evidence of murder.

Everyone who came into contact with the corpse is isolated in quarantine, waiting <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>tested</b> <b>for</b> exposure to any pathogen. While quarantined, Black accuses Watts and the Millennium Group of knowing more about the virus than is apparent. Watts simply responds by quoting the Bible's Book of Revelation. The pair are examined by mysterious doctors in protective suits; shortly afterwards, they are cleared to leave quarantine. Black contacts Gilbert and expresses his wish to leave the Millennium Group and join The Trust—however, he first wishes to [...] "rescue" [...] his friends within the Group.|$|E
500|$|In 2007, the Indians {{became the}} first American League team to install solar panels on their stadium.

There is also a memorial plaque commemorating Ray Chapman which was originally installed at League Park. This area is shielded by plantings so it does {{not interfere with the}} batter's eye. The Indians installed a corkscrew-shaped wind turbine from Cleveland State University above the southeast corner of the ballpark in late March 2012, the first major league team to do so.
