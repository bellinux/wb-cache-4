Process management in this domain must comply with individual conditions of patients and quickly react to changing requirements and organizational parameters.

This frequency range limits the exchange of information to users within line-of-sight of one another, although with satellite capabilities and adhoc protocols, it is nowadays possible to pass Link 16 data over long-haul protocols such as TCP/IP using MIL-STD 3011 (JREAP) or STANAG 5602 (SIMPLE). It uses the transmission characteristics and protocols, conventions, and fixed-length or variable length message formats defined by MIL-STD 6016, STANAG 5516 (formerly the JTIDS <b>technical</b> <b>interface</b> design plan).

40|$|We {{consider}} {{complex products}} as {{a network of}} components that share <b>technical</b> <b>interfaces</b> in order {{to function as a}} whole. Building upon previous work in graph theory and social network analysis, we define three measures of component modularity that consider how components may share direct interfaces with other adjacent components, how design interfaces may propagate to all other components in the product, and how components may act as “bridges ” between other components. We calculate and interpret all three measures of component modularity by studying the actual product architecture of a large commercial aircraft engine. We illustrate how to use these measures to test their impact on component redesign. Directions for future work are discussed...|$|R
