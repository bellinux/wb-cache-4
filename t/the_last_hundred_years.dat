5|$|In the past, a Deshastha widow {{was never}} allowed to remarry, while it was {{acceptable}} for Deshastha widowers to remarry, and the widows had to lead a very austere life with little joy. Divorces were non-existent. All of these practices have gradually fallen by the wayside over <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>hundred</b> <b>years,</b> and modern Deshastha widows lead better lives and younger widows also remarry. Divorce takes place by mutual consent and legal approval is sought.|$|E

5|$|While {{people have}} used canning and {{artificial}} refrigeration to preserve food for <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>hundred</b> <b>years</b> or so, salt {{has been the}} best-known food preservative, especially for meat, for many thousands of years. A very ancient salt-works operation has been discovered at the Poiana Slatinei archaeological site next to a salt spring in Lunca, Neamț County, Romania. Evidence indicates that Neolithic people of the Precucuteni Culture were boiling the salt-laden spring water {{through the process of}} briquetage to extract the salt as far back as 6050 BC. The salt extracted from this operation may have had a direct correlation to the rapid growth of this society's population soon after its initial production began. The harvest of salt from the surface of Xiechi Lake near Yuncheng in Shanxi, China, dates back to at least 6000 BC, {{making it one of the}} oldest verifiable saltworks.|$|E

25|$|Currently, {{most modern}} {{monetary}} systems {{are based on}} fiat money. However, for most of history, almost all money was commodity money, such as gold and silver coins.

25|$|During <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>hundred</b> <b>years</b> of Ottoman rule in Palestine, European archaeologists {{active in}} the region tended to be Christian, backed by the {{dominant}} European powers {{of the time and}} the Churches.

After World War I (1914–1918) and the establishment of the British Mandate, archaeological institutions tended increasingly to be concentrated in the city of Jerusalem.|$|E

25|$|Through <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>hundred</b> <b>years,</b> {{more than}} half of the Earth's {{wetlands}} have been destroyed and have disappeared. These wetlands are important not only because they are the habitats of numerous inhabitants such as mammals, birds, fish, amphibians, and invertebrates, but they support the growing of rice and other food crops as well as provide water filtration and protection from storms and flooding. Freshwater lakes such as the Aral Sea in central Asia have also suffered. Once the fourth largest freshwater lake, it has lost more than 58,000 square km of area and vastly increased in salt concentration over the span of three decades.|$|E
