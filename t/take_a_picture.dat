5|$|The video {{progresses}} as Carey, now on {{the streets}} of New York, is walking towards the hotel. As she begins to notice the bellhop, dressed in the sweats, pursuing her, she turns around in haste and begins jolting back to the hotel while holding several shopping bags. Additionally, scenes of the stalker's home are shown again, this time more elaborately, with his walls covered with portraits of the singer, as well as album covers and lights around a large photo of her. As the video comes to an end, she waits for her limousine to arrive at the hotel. However, before she gets inside, she notices the stalker attempting to <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>picture</b> of her. She then looks directly into his camera and gives a smile. The video then shows him again, still attempting to <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>picture,</b> right before a bus hits him. Carey gasps in shock after witnessing the incident. The remix video for the song features the same story-line and footage, only showing inter-cut scenes of Carey dressed in a white ensemble, while laying on a vintage wooden table. As Gucci Mane stands next to her in a white suit, he pours her champagne and hands her the glass.|$|E

25|$|On 12 October, PA {{police arrested}} two Israeli reservists who had accidentally entered Ramallah, {{where in the}} {{preceding}} weeks a hundred Palestinians had been killed, nearly two dozen of them minors. Rumours quickly spread that Israeli undercover agents were in the building, and an angry crowd of more than 1,000 Palestinian mourners gathered {{in front of the}} station calling for their death. Both soldiers were beaten, stabbed, and disembowelled, and one body was set on fire. An Italian television crew captured the killings on video and then broadcast his tape internationally. A British journalist had his camera destroyed by rioters as he attempted to <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>picture.</b> The brutality of the killings shocked the Israeli public, who saw it as proof of a deep-seated Palestinian hatred of Israel and Jews. In response, Israel launched a series of retaliatory air-strikes against Palestinian Authority targets in the West Bank and Gaza Strip. The police station where the lynching had taken place was evacuated and destroyed in these operations. Israel later tracked down and arrested those responsible for killing the soldiers.|$|E

At the final auditions for the chorus, Jack is informed by the choral director that he will have a solo, but before he can sing it, Owen (Matt Damon)originally intended for the solo partbarges in and sings his part. Jack sees Owen as competition and thinks of a {{way to get rid of}} him. He learns that Owen is posing as a gay man, after observing him gaze at a woman. Jack strikes a plan to get Owen to confess he is straight, in which he invites him to [...] "rehearse" [...] in Will and Grace's apartment.

These shows were planned to be with supporting act Vampires Everywhere. However, the July dates were postponed due to issues with guitarist Jacky Vincent's immigration visa, though the band voiced intentions to make these dates up. This meant that the band's first live performances would be at the Vans Warped Tour 2011 from August 10 to August 14 for five shows on the Advent Clothing Stage throughout the western United States. However, the band played a few secret shows under the name [...] "Goodbye Graceful" [...] on August eighth and ninth in Anaheim and Los Angeles.

500|$|Desmond flashbacks: {{the hatch}} is shown imploding again, and then Desmond (who was inside) {{suddenly}} {{wakes up in}} a London apartment with his girlfriend Penelope Widmore (Sonya Walger). Desmond is clearly puzzled, but is relieved to finally be with Penny again. Desmond later goes to Penny's billionaire father, Charles Widmore (Alan Dale) and asks for his permission to marry his daughter. Widmore rejects Desmond, who is crushed and humiliated. Walking out of the building, Desmond sees Charlie singing and playing his guitar for money on the sidewalk. Desmond asks him if he remembers him but Charlie does not. Frustrated, Desmond rants about his time {{on the island and}} predicts it will rain, which it suddenly does. At a pub, Desmond meets with his friend, a physicist, and after retelling the events on the island asks him if time travel is possible. Desmond tries to predict more events but they do not happen and his friend assures him time travel is impossible. While shopping for a ring for Penny, Desmond runs into the shopkeeper, Eloise Hawking (Fionnula Flanagan). Hawking takes Desmond on a walk where they see a man crushed to death by falling scaffolding. She explains that although she knew the man would die, she did not help because the universe has a way of [...] "course correcting", and he would die anyway. Desmond and Penny go on a walk together and <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>picture,</b> where he breaks up with her after realizing that he does not have enough money to support her. He returns to the pub, where one of his predictions before about the bartender being attacked finally comes true (proving that he really knew about the future, but that his timing was off), but he ends up being accidentally hit himself and is knocked out. Desmond wakes up back on the Island, completely naked, as seen in [...] "Further Instructions".|$|E

500|$|The {{read-through}} for [...] "The Angels Take Manhattan" [...] {{took place}} in the Upper Boat Studios on 23 March 2012, alongside that for the episode [...] "Asylum of the Daleks". The final episode Gillan and Darvill shot as Amy and Rory was actually the previous episode, [...] "The Power of Three". Nevertheless, Gillan and Smith got very emotional filming the final graveyard scene. Amy and Rory's scene on the rooftop was filmed in a car park in Cardiff, Wales, with a greenscreen standing in for the New York skyline. To create the effect of the two plunging down, Gillan and Darvill were suspended upside-down by wires and raised and lowered. Much of the episode was filmed in Central Park in New York City in April 2012. The filming was attended by thousands of American fans, which surprised the cast and crew. Other scenes were shot at night in the city, {{as well as by the}} East River in front of the Brooklyn Bridge and in the Tudor City apartment complex. Moffat was in New York City when he came up with the story, and thought it was appropriate for the Weeping Angels. He described the city as [...] "a different backdrop" [...] to shoot a Doctor Who story in, and made use of its architecture. Fellow executive producer Caroline Skinner felt that the location [...] "has such scale and romance" [...] which [...] " [...] the episode a real atmosphere and a very different tone for Doctor Who". The week spent filming in the city was done by a [...] "small unit by American standards" [...] according to producer Marcus Wilson. They did not take any props of Angels or the TARDIS, which were instead added in post-production. Filming for the episode also occurred at a cemetery in Llanelli. During post-production, the New York skyline was inserted into the cemetery scenes. Gillan insisted on reading Amy's afterword to Smith when his reaction was filmed. They were not expecting it to be in front of a crowd in Central Park, and Smith said he had to [...] "treat this like a play". Because the content was so secret, Gillan had to read very quietly and Smith could not hold the real page because a spectator might <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>picture</b> of it. Gillan found that she only had one page of the script, and had to improvise the rest.|$|E
