50|$|The first {{generation}} 4Matic system was originally a complex electronically controlled system with automatically engaging four-wheel drive (4WD), the system employs locking central and rear differentials {{to provide additional}} traction in slippery conditions. The centre differential, {{also known as the}} transfer case, contains two clutches. Each hydraulically enabled clutch is controlled separately to allow for three modes of operation: 2WD (mode 0) where 100% of available torque is available to the rear axle while the front axle is disconnected, and two 4WD modes which allow for 35/65 front/rear axle torque split (mode 1) or 50/50 front/rear axle torque split (mode 2). The rear differential lock, previously known as ASD on Mercedes-Benz models, can also be locked (mode 3) if rear wheel slip is still present when the transfer case 50/50 4WD mode 2 is engaged. Due to safety and stability concerns there is no front differential lock. The 4Matic system uses inputs from the three channel ABS system and a steering wheel angle sensor to decide when to intervene. 4WD is disengaged automatically if the ABS service brakes are applied. Engine throttle control is not inherent in the W124 system. Two W124 variants of the 4Matic system were produced: the first system (1986-1991) used a mechanical pressure <b>test</b> <b>lever</b> to disable the system hydraulically while the second system variant (1992/1993) used an electrical test switch to break power to the system. The later system variant when in test mode allows for continued operation of the rear shock self-levelling system (SLS) when installed. Initially plagued with reliability factors, the multi-plate clutch central differentials were subject to failure; it was discontinued in 1993.|$|E

40|$|AbstractIn this work, the {{sensitivity}} of an unreinforced and steel wire reinforced AZ 31 magnesium alloy to stress corrosion cracking is investigated by means of static stress corrosion <b>testing</b> (clamping <b>lever</b> <b>tests)</b> and cyclic stress corrosion testing (crack propagation tests). In static mechanical-corrosive testing, the AZ 31 alloy showed a relatively low sensitivity while the composite showed a higher sensitivity with earlier crack initiation due to weakening of the loaded specimen section. In cyclic experiments, hydrogen embrittlement crack growth acceleration could be attested. Reinforcing the matrix material leads to a compensation of the crack growth acceleration due to stress corrosion cracking by crack energy absorption by increased interface damage according to the aggressiveness of the corrosive media...|$|R

40|$|Background: Increasing {{evidence}} suggests the neuropeptide oxytocin may be utilized {{as a treatment}} {{for a wide variety of}} psychopathologies, including addiction. Methods: Firstly, we trained rats to lever press to intravenously self-administer methamphetamine. Once responding had stabilized, one group of rats received escalating doses of oxytocin prior to daily self-administration tests while other rats received vehicle. After these <b>tests,</b> <b>lever</b> pressing was extinguished and the ability of methamphetamine primes to reinstate responding was studied with and without co-administration of oxytocin. In a separate study, using Fos immunohistochemistry we determined the ability of oxytocin to compete with a methamphetamine challenge. To provide insight into alterations in neuropeptide systems during drug intoxication in humans we collected blood from a group of methamphetamine intoxicated adults and compared their plasma levels of oxytocin, vasopressin, and cortisol to a non-drug taking healthy control group. Results: We showed that oxytocin dose-dependently reduced responding for intravenous methamphetamine in rats and significantly reduced relapse to drug-seeking. Secondly, our results showed that oxytocin effectively reduced methamphetamine induced neural activity in key addiction related brain areas as well as reduced methamphetamine induced hyperactivity to a level similar to that of control animals. Our data also provide further insight into the pharmacodynamic action of addictive substances, specifically methamphetamine in human drug users. Importantly, I will finish by discussing preliminary findings from a randomized controlled trial of intranasal oxytocin for cannabis dependence. Conclusions: We provide important insight into the role of oxytocin in drug addiction and argue its use as a novel therapeutic for drug dependence. 1 page(s...|$|R

The relatively mild and stable {{climate of the}} last 10, 000 years betrays a history of environmental variability and rapid changes. Humans have recently accelerated global environmental change, ushering in the Anthropocene. Meeting accelerating demands for food, energy, and goods and services has accelerated species extinctions, flows of reactive nitrogen and phosphorus, and warming of the atmosphere. I address the overarching question of how ecosystems will respond to changing and variable environments through several focused studies. To address how the changing environment affects the sizes and turnover rates of slowly and quickly cycling soil carbon pools, I analyzed the responses of grassland soils to simulated species diversity loss, increased deposition of nitrogen and increased atmospheric CO_ 2. Species diversity, nitrogen deposition and atmospheric CO_ 2 {{had no effect on}} the total soil carbon after 8 years of treatments. Although total soil carbon did not change, the rates of cycling in the fast and slow pools changed in response to elevated CO_ 2 and diversity loss treatments. Nitrogen treatments increased the size of the slowly cycling carbon pool. Precipitation variability has increased around most of the world since the industrial revolution. I used plant mesocosms in a greenhouse experiment to manipulate rainfall variability and mycorrhizal associations. In response to individual rewetting events, drier soils released more nitrate and total nitrogen than wetter soils. Ectomycorrhizal treatments slightly reduced the amount of total nitrogen and nitrate losses from rewetting events. Only ammonium increased in response to patterns of events and mycorrhizal treatments had no effect. The more than 9 billion people expected on the planet by 2050 require food, energy, shelter and other goods and services. Historically, producing those benefits has resulted in environmental damage, especially nitrogen pollution through agricultural fertilizers, atmospheric nitrogen deposition and human waste. I developed a model to test the effectiveness of various levers to reduce the environmental harms associated with meeting the needs of human well-being. The <b>tested</b> <b>levers</b> were mildly effective at reducing nitrogen yield from the baseline business as usual (BAU) scenario, but still resulted in at least 15 % greater nitrogen yield than the present...|$|R

40|$|Nano-sized Pt {{particles}} in the cathode catalyst layer of a polymer electrolyte fuel cell afford a high initial electrochemically active surface-area. However, the gain in active surface area for desired surface reactions is offset in part by enhanced rates of degradation processes that cause losses in catalyst mass, catalyst surface-area, and electrocatalytic activity. The loss of electrochemically active surface-area of the catalyst causes severe performance degradation over relevant lifetimes of polymer electrolyte fuel cells yet a consistent theoretical approach, linking experimental observations of surface-area loss related phenomena to purported mechanisms of degradation was missing. Accordingly, a dynamic model of surface-area loss and Pt mass balance phenomena based on the theories of Lifshitz, Slyozov and Wagner, and Smoluchowski is developed. It relates kinetic rates of degradation processes {{to the evolution of}} the particle-size distribution and its moments. We pursue model validation and evaluation by analyzing an extensive set of electrochemical surface-area loss experiments probing the impact of accelerated stress <b>test</b> control <b>levers.</b> Our Pt mass balance model unifies degradation characterization approaches and accordingly discriminates the predominant degradation mechanisms. The evaluation and validation approaches established a firm link between surface-area loss, Pt dissolution and Pt oxidation.

The model provides a comprehensive picture of surface electrochemical processes that occur at Pt(111). In closing we discuss future routes of research. Foremost is the extension of cyclic voltammetry work to polycrystalline Pt and Pt nanoparticle electrodes, we suggest that these are the logical steps towards linking dynamic Pt oxidation with surface tension, Pt dissolution, surface-area loss and the oxygen reduction reaction...|$|R

30|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to obtain {{quantitative}} results about shoulder contact force during wheelchair lever propulsion when the gear ratio of the lever propulsion mechanism is changing. The effect of the gear ratio on the shoulder contact force was investigated for few different wheelchair loading. For the experiments we designed a special mechatronic wheelchair simulator that allowed the simulation of different gear ratios of the wheelchair lever propulsion mechanism and simulation of different road inclinations. The same simulator was also used for simulation of a hand rim propelled wheelchair. We conducted also a handrim propulsion experiment and used the results from it for comparison with the lever propulsion data. Four nondisabled male adults with no prior wheeling experience participated in the experiment. In the first <b>tests,</b> a <b>lever</b> propelled wheelchair was simulated with the simulator. The target speed of the wheelchair was set to 2  km/h. For the test, the gear ratio was varied from 1.5 to 1 / 1.5. A load torque was applied to the rear wheels to imitate road inclinations of 0 °, 2 ° and 4 °. In the second part of the test, the simulator was structured to simulate a handrim propelled wheelchair. The participants were asked to keep the same speed (2  km/h) and the simulator was set sequentially to imitate climbing a ramp inclined on 0 °, 2 ° and 4 °. Kinematic data of the body were collected by a motion capture system. Kinetic data such as hand force and driving torque, were measured by instrumented wheels with incorporated six-axis force sensor. The intersegmental joint forces and moments were calculated from the obtained kinematic and kinetic data via inverse dynamics analysis procedure. Muscle forces were computed from the measured joint moments by using an optimization approach. Shoulder joint contact force, which indicates the joint surface loading, was computed as a synthetic vector of the intersegmental force for shoulder joint acquired from the inverse dynamics analysis and the compressive forces from muscles, tendons, ligaments and cartilages crossing the shoulder joint. It was observed that the decrease of the gear ratio causes increased cycle frequency and reduces the shoulder joint contact force. Result showed that the shoulder joint contact force during lever propulsion with a gear ratio 1 / 1.5 was up to 70  % lower than the shoulder joint contact force during handrim propulsion. The results from this study could be used in the design of new lever propulsion mechanisms that reduce the risks of secondary shoulder disorders and increase user’s comfort.|$|R

Different stimulus mice, rotated across testing days, served as a social stimulus behind the wire grid, and were only visible following {{the opening of the}} guillotine door. Test mice were trained to lever press in order to open the door and gain access to the stimulus partner for 15 sec. The number of lever presses required to obtain the social reward progressively increased on a fixed schedule of 3. Testing sessions ended after <b>test</b> mice stopped <b>lever</b> pressing for 5 consecutive minutes. The last reinforced ratio or breakpoint {{can be used as a}} quantitative measure of {{social motivation}}. For the second paradigm, test mice were trained to discriminate between left and right lever presses in order to obtain either a food reward or the social reward. Mice were rewarded for every 3 presses of each respective lever. The number of food and social rewards can be compared as a measurement of the value placed upon each reward. The ratio of each reward type can also be compared between mouse strains and the change in this ratio can be monitored within testing sessions to measure satiation with a given reward type. Both of these operant conditioning paradigms are highly useful for the quantification of social motivation in mouse models of autism and other disorders of social behavior...|$|R
40|$|In {{the simple}} plastic theory {{commonly}} used for mild steel {{it is assumed}} that after yielding has occurred in either tension or compression, straining can continue indefinitely at constant stress. Such au assumption has been found satisfactory for low carbon steels having a plastic range corresponding to eight to ten times the strain a t yield, but for steels of greater strength th is range is often considerably shorter, and it becomes necessary {{to take into account the}} strain-hardening range beyond. To obtain experimental data, four steels were selected, varying in carbon content from 0. 28 to 0. 89 per cent, and having widely different stress-strain relations. For each steel a number of simply supported beams of square section were subjected to a symmetrical two-point loading; tension specimens were prepared from the unyielded ends of these beams and tested in a spring-loaded autographic testing machine to determine upper and lower yield stresses. In addition, two tension specimens from each steel were <b>tested</b> in a <b>lever</b> type of machine, and the strt%ss-strain relations through the plastic range and the initial stages of the strain-hardening range were obtained with the aid of a “Gerard ” extensometer. This information gave good support to the theoretical work, whereby the behaviour of these steels in flexure can be correlated with the tensile properties.

40|$|This paper {{introduces}} the recent state {{of research on}} creep of new concrete made by montmorillonite mineral nano particles (MNP) and then comparing them with control specimens made from reference concrete. Concrete compositions with unconventional additives were designed and prepared. Standard sample cubes 100 x 100 x 100 mm and prisms 40 x 40 x 160 mm were produced in order to investigate the mechanical characteristics of the material. Experimental studies review new concrete compositions on long – term deformations (creep). The samples were put into a creep <b>lever</b> <b>test</b> stand and loaded (see Figure 1). The constant compressive load was equal to 30 % of the maximum strength of the concrete. Stress levels were calculated from compression strength results. At {{the beginning of the}} test, the samples were 51 and 63 days old and they were kept under constant load for 90 days and for recoverable creep they were kept without load for 40 days. Specimens were tested in two extreme environments: in one case there was 100 % humidity provided by protecting the specimens from desiccation and in the other case specimens were air-dried and protected from any moisture. Concrete specimens were subject to load in a constant room temperature and with a constant level of moisture. The investigated properties include compression strength, modulus of elasticity and creep. A number of experimental results are presented in Figure 2. This experimental study proves that montmorillonite nano particles in small dosage (8 kg in m 3) don't have negative influence on mechanical and deformation characteristics of concrete. Some positive effects are established. Concrete mix containing montmorillonite nano particles perform long-term hardening effect. MNP concrete specimens cured in dry conditions showed larger increase of basic creep deformations than reference concrete specimens, but for samples hardened in moist conditions the values of basic creep deformation were similar. In the future, the physical and mechanical properties of new high-strength concrete containing montmorillonite nano particles as an alternative admixture should be investigated in a more detailed way...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} the {{development}} of microfabrication technologies based on photoplastic structuring by lithographic and molding techniques. These technologies, combined with an original releasing method, allow for the simple fabrication of pseudo three-dimensional, soft, photoplastic microstructures with features and shapes that are difficult to obtain with standard micro-machining. The photoplastic material used is the SU- 8 photoresist, a material that is used increasingly in the growing field of micro-electro-mechanical systems (MEMS). Photoplastic SU- 8 microstructure fabrication is based on a combination of multi-layer spin-coating, molding and photolithographic processing of the resist on a prestructured silicon substrate. The final product is obtained by release of the structure from the substrate. This thesis describes several SU- 8 microstructures which have been developed with an emphasis on atomic force microscopy (AFM) and scanning-near field optical microscopy (SNOM) probes. Scanning probe microscopy is a well-established technique for surface analysis, but batch-fabricated, low-cost probes still remain a challenging issue. Using a polymer for the cantilever facilitates the realization of mechanical properties that are difficult to achieve with classical silicon technology. The design, fabrication and <b>testing</b> of single <b>lever</b> and cassettes of multiple single-lever probes are presented and demonstrates the potential for fabrication structures with complicated shape and features. The fabrication process for SU- 8 AFM probes is a simple batch process in which the integrated tips and the levers are defined in one photolithography step. Tip radii of curvature smaller than 15 nm have been obtained. The cantilever thickness depends on the spin-coating parameters, hence it can be very well controlled over a full wafer. Photoplastic cantilevers with thicknesses ranging from 1 to 6 μm have been produced. Imaging soft, condensed matter with photo-plastic levers, which uses laser beam deflection sensing, exhibits a resolution that compares well with that of commercially available silicon cantilevers. Lateral resolution of 5 – 6 nm has been estimated from imaging DNA-plasmid molecules. A vertical resolution of the order of 0. 1 nm has been found. A similar fabrication technique was also developed to fabricate photo-plastic tips for SNOM that are to be attached to optical fibers. This technique allows optical apertures to be integrated {{at the end of the}} well-defined tip directly by probe fabrication, without the need for any post-processing for the aperture formation. Sub- 100 nm aperture have been fabricated using this technique. Simple fabrication, as well as topographical and optical imaging demonstrate the potential of photoplastic-based probes for both AFM and SNOM applications, as well as for future combined probes development. In addition, the fabrication of functional microstructures by using SU- 8 processing needs to be combined with other microfabrication techniques. Simple releasing of the molded structures from the substrate is especially of great importance. A sacrificial layer technique based on electrochemical etching enhancement has been developed and combined with the fabrication of the different photoplastic SU- 8 probes presented. This technique allows the fast releasing of large microstructures and has been demonstrated by releasing other SU- 8 photoplastic microfabricated devices...|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} insure the {{provision}} of food and services by agriculture while limiting its negative impacts, innovative agricultural systems have to be designed. The design of such systems has shown some limits in addressing regional and global issues. For instance, at the field scale, some cropping systems may fail to reach the objectives defined at the regional scale due to the low scaling integration and the spatial heterogeneity in the region. Model-based prototyping of agricultural landscapes can allow the impact assessment at regional level of drivers that act at field, farm and regional levels. In order to ascertain whether a combination of levers can drive agriculture towards sustainability, we designed a modeling framework, to explore successive steps of scenario development and assessment with indicators. To this end we introduce an approach based on several types of scenarios. [br/] The method is built to i) understand the potential levels of sustainability that {{can be reached by}} the cropping system mosaics and ii) gain knowledge on the potential levers of change of the cropping system mosaics. The framework guides the assessment of the consequences of several types of scenario, with a regional bioeconomic model, on the organization of cropping systems. Indicators are used to assess the cropping systems externalities at regional scale. An iterative approach is presented to guide the use of the model with different phases (Fig. 1) : scenarios are built in a pre-modeling phase; they are implemented in a modeling phase for visualizing their consequences on the cropping system mosaics; the post-modeling phase assesses the contribution of the cropping system mosaics to sustainable development. [br/] We built our framework around the MOSAICA regional bioeconomic model (Chopin et al., submitted). MOSAICA optimizes the overall farmer's utilities by allocating cropping systems to their spatially located plots. The allocation process of cropping systems to plots, recorded in a geographical database, is driven by several types of constraints or objectives implemented at different spatial scales among which biophysical, economic, structure constraints at field, farm, sub-regional or regional scales. The optimization of farmer's utilities or other variables of the system produce new agricultural landscapes that are assessed with a set of sustainability indicators. In our framework, the MOSAICA model is used with four different types of scenario for prototyping agricultural landscapes for one specific goal (such as energy self-sufficiency). First, short-term optimized scenario provides a target value by optimizing one given sustainability indicator (e. g. the production of biomass for electricity). Secondly, an exploratory scenario combines several types of levers (economic, agronomic [...] .) to reach the target value defined before (the overall farmer’s revenue is maximized). Thirdly, normative scenario is introduced to assess whether or not the target can be reached with the levers from the exploratory scenario. Fourthly, a long-term optimized scenario is parameterized to assess the relevance of levers to improve the long-term potential of the system (by optimizing the production of biomass with the levers selected). The levers that improve the state of the system for each objective, (increase food production, employment [...] .) are selected and combined in a last exploratory scenario called "Go sustainable" scenario to improve the overall response of agricultural landscapes to sustainable development. We here present some results from the use of the framework in Guadeloupe, a French archipelago in the Caribbean for the energy self-sufficiency objective (Chopin et al., 2015). The <b>levers</b> <b>tested</b> are the decrease of subsidies for sugar, the setting up of a biomass industry for electricity production and the addition of a crop energy activity for farmers. The response to the sustainability objective increases with levers that help achieve the objective of producing 56 MW. yr- 1 and also improve the potential of response of the landscape in long-term scenario to 93 MW. yr- 1. [br/] The "Go sustainable scenario" which combines all the relevant levers selected for each of the five objectives improves the system by increasing its contribution to each objective selected (Fig. 2). For instance, the response of the food self-sufficiency objective increased by 150 % and the overall agricultural value doubled compared to the initial landscape due to the development of crop-gardening, in the south of Guadeloupe, and energy crops within the entire region. The modeling framework guides the use of the regional model could be used in other regions to help identify the most appropriate levers to increase the response of agriculture to sustainable development. This holistic approach provides analysis of changes that occur at the regional, the farm and the field scale, and can highlight the evolution of externalities of cropping system mosaics in a quantitative and spatially explicit way...|$|R
