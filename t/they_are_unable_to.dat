5|$|Attack by the ant Crematogaster laeviuscula is {{different}} from attacks by birds. Rather than knocking down the nest, the ants swarm all over the nest and remove the brood from it. The ants destroy the entire brood but <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>unable</b> <b>to</b> kill the adults.|$|E
5|$|On land, their {{movements}} become very erratic. They crawl awkwardly {{in these situations}} and can become quite aggressive, striking wildly at anything that moves, although <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>unable</b> <b>to</b> coil and strike {{in the manner of}} terrestrial snakes.|$|E
5|$|Em's reviver {{status is}} {{discovered}} {{and she is}} confined to the dairy farm. Following a lead, Dana learns that Em's murderer has bribed a guard at the facility to abduct Em to prevent a formal investigation into her death. Dana arrives in time to save Em and escape. Because <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>unable</b> <b>to</b> leave the quarantine, they go into hiding.|$|E
50|$|The Battle of Haldighati was {{a futile}} {{victory for the}} Mughals, as <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>unable</b> <b>to</b> oust Maharana Pratap. While <b>they</b> <b>were</b> able to capture Gogunda and nearby areas, <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>unable</b> <b>to</b> hold onto them for long. As soon as the empire's focus shifted elsewhere, Pratap and his army came out of hiding and recaptured the western regions of his dominion.|$|R

5|$|Examination of the spectrographic {{features}} of this star showed the characteristic absorption line shift of a binary star system. This shift is created when their orbit carries the member stars toward and then away from the observer, producing a doppler shift in the wavelength of the line features. The measurement of this shift allows astronomers to determine the relative orbital velocity {{of at least one}} of the stars even though <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>unable</b> <b>to</b> resolve the individual components.|$|E
5|$|Furthermore, while patriarchal {{marriages are}} one of the great wrongs perpetrated upon women, Wollstonecraft argues that a greater wrong is women's lack of independence. Because <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>unable</b> <b>to</b> find respectable, well-paid work, they are reliant upon men. Women such as Jemima are reduced to hard {{physical}} labor, stealing, begging, or prostituting themselves in order to survive; they are demeaned by this work and think meanly of themselves because of it.|$|E
5|$|Lactose is the {{naturally}} occurring sugar found in milk. A molecule of lactose is {{formed by the}} combination of a molecule of galactose with a molecule of glucose. It is broken down when consumed into its constituent parts by the enzyme lactase during digestion. Children have this enzyme but some adults no longer form it and <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>unable</b> <b>to</b> digest lactose.|$|E

5|$|The Enterprise {{receives}} a distress signal from a shuttlecraft returning Deanna Troi from a conference. They {{find that the}} shuttle has crashed on a desolate planet, Vagra II, and while they can find the life signs of Troi and the pilot, <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>unable</b> <b>to</b> beam the two to the ship. An away team beams down and discovers an animated pool of a tar-like substance, a malevolent life form that calls itself Armus. When Lt. Yar attempts to approach the shuttle, Armus hurls her back with a psychokinetic blast, killing her instantly. The away team is {{brought back to the}} Enterprise but the damage to Yar is too great for Dr. Crusher (Gates McFadden) to repair, and <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>unable</b> <b>to</b> resuscitate her. A second away team is sent to the planet. Armus taunts the crew members and maintains his grasp of the shuttle. During this time, Troi has communicated with Armus and learned that it is a physical manifestation of evil from the bodies of an ancient race, abandoned on Vagra II.|$|E
5|$|Colletid bees of {{the genus}} Leioproctus {{subgenus}} Cladocerapis exclusively forage on and pollinate flowers of many species of Persoonia. Bees of subgenus Filiglossa in the same genus that also specialise in feeding on Persoonia flowers {{do not appear to}} be effective pollinators. Particular species recorded on P.levis include the longtongue bee Leioproctus carinatifrons. Weighing 1700mg (0.60oz), the fruit are adapted to be eaten by vertebrates, such as kangaroos and possums, as well as currawongs and other large birds. The flowers of P.levis are self-incompatible—that is, <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>unable</b> <b>to</b> fertilise themselves and require outcrossing to another plant.|$|E
5|$|In {{the final}} act, Jekyll {{has begun to}} change into Hyde without using the potion. Although he still needs it to change back, he has {{exhausted}} his supply. Dr. Lanyon tries to help Jekyll re-create the formula, but <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>unable</b> <b>to</b> find an ingredient. Jekyll asks Lanyon to bring Agnes to him, but Jekyll turns into Hyde before Lanyon returns. Utterson and Newcome arrive to arrest Hyde; knowing {{he can no longer}} transform back into Jekyll, Hyde commits suicide by taking poison.|$|E

5|$|In {{the small}} town of Champaner (in the state of Gujarat, western India) {{during the height of the}} British empire in India in 1893, Captain Andrew Russell (Paul Blackthorne), the {{commanding}} officer of the Champaner cantonment, has imposed high taxes ("Lagaan") on people from the local villages that <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>unable</b> <b>to</b> pay due to a prolonged drought. Led by Bhuvan (Aamir Khan), the villagers beg Raja Puran Singh (Kulbhushan Kharbanda) to help them. He tells them that, much to his regret, he is bound by British law.|$|E
5|$|Jon Snow, Sansa Stark, and Davos Seaworth begin {{searching for}} allies to retake Winterfell from the Boltons. First, they secure the {{allegiance}} of the Wildlings, {{who are still}} indebted to Jon for saving them at Hardhome, and are aware the Boltons will wipe them out if they do nothing. They also manage to secure the allegiance of House Mormont when Davos warns the young Lady Lyanna Mormont of the dangers the White Walkers pose. However, <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>unable</b> <b>to</b> secure the allegiance of House Glover, with Lord Robett Glover pointing out how Robb Stark failed to protect his home from the Ironborn.|$|E
5|$|Most microbats are nocturnal while megabats are {{typically}} diurnal or crepuscular. In temperate areas, bats may migrate hundreds of kilometres to winter hibernation dens, while some pass into torpor in cold weather, rousing and feeding when warm weather allows for insects to be active. Others retreat to caves for winter and hibernate for six months. Microbats rarely fly in rain, it interferes with their echolocation, and <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>unable</b> <b>to</b> locate their food. A few {{species such as}} the New Zealand short-tailed bat and the common vampire bat are agile on the ground.|$|E

This included establishing procedures to coordinate such requests between facilities; requiring controllers to instruct pilots to self-announce on the VFR corridor frequency if <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>unable</b> <b>to</b> immediately enter Class B airspace; adding information to area Automatic Terminal Information Service (ATIS) broadcasts reminding pilots to use the self-announce frequency; and ensuring that pilots are provided with traffic advisories if they are in contact with a controller.|$|E
5|$|Finn and Jake then {{attempt to}} find new homes. Initially <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>unable</b> <b>to</b> find a {{suitable}} home until they stumble upon a cave. They clean up the cave and hold a house-warming party, which Marceline crashes. She explains that the cave also belongs to her. Finn, having had enough starts a fight with Marceline, who grows into a huge demonic bat. After she seemingly kills Jake, Finn goes into a rage and violently punches Marceline, who promptly shape-shifts into her regular form and then kisses Finn on the cheek, making him blush. Jake—who {{was able to use}} his shape-shifting powers to save himself—runs over to Finn, and Marceline states that the fight they had was fun and {{that the two of them}} can have their old house back, as a gift. Once Finn and Jake return to their old abode, they are promptly hypnotized by King Worm (voiced by Erik Estrada).|$|E
5|$|However, {{several of}} the new COX-2 inhibitors, such as rofecoxib (Vioxx), have been {{withdrawn}} in the last decade, after evidence emerged that PTGS2 inhibitors {{increase the risk of}} heart attack and stroke. Endothelial cells lining the microvasculature in the body are proposed to express PTGS2, and, by selectively inhibiting PTGS2, prostaglandin production (specifically, PGI2; prostacyclin) is downregulated with respect to thromboxane levels, as PTGS1 in platelets is unaffected. Thus, the protective anticoagulative effect of PGI2 is removed, increasing the risk of thrombus and associated heart attacks and other circulatory problems. Since platelets have no DNA, <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>unable</b> <b>to</b> synthesize new PTGS once aspirin has irreversibly inhibited the enzyme, an important difference with reversible inhibitors.|$|E

Surprised, T'Pol orders Tucker and Ensign Mayweather to fly a shuttlepod down to San Francisco, where they are {{suddenly}} attacked by what seem to be P-51s. The final scene switches to a World War II German field-hospital. A doctor summons some SS officers to examine the unfamiliar uniform of a burns patient who was recently brought in. The patient is revealed as Archer. One of the SS personnel steps out of the shadows, revealing himself to be a gray-skinned alien.|$|E
5|$|That night, as Sunnydale sleeps, white wisps float {{from each}} person's mouth to a belfry, where they {{settle in the}} box from Buffy's dream as ghoulish {{skeletal}} figures, with metal-toothed grins and impeccable black suits, look on. In the morning, Buffy and Willow discover <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>unable</b> <b>to</b> speak and become visibly distressed; they soon discover that everybody is unable to speak. The group gathers at Giles' where they see that the news is reporting that Sunnydale is suffering from an epidemic of laryngitis. Buffy and Riley, each concerned that chaos will ensue, find each other attempting to keep order on the streets. For the first time, Buffy sees Riley in his paramilitary role {{as an agent of}} The Initiative; he in turn is unaware that she is the Slayer. They exchange a look and then their first kiss, before parting to continue their efforts.|$|E

Posing as an assistant, Ramudu shaves the sorcerer's beard, making him lose his powers. Afterwards, Ramudu finds the statuette and wishes to bring the palace back to Ujjain. In a fight between Ramudu and the sorcerer mid-way in the sky, the latter dies when Ramudu throws him out. The palace is back in Ujjain and Surasena apologises to both Ramudu and Indu before uniting them. While Anji marries Indu's best friend, the film ends with the marriage of Ramudu and Indu with the elders' blessing.|$|E
