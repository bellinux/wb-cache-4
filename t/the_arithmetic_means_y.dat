40|$|This {{informal}} {{working paper}} provides an expository survey of some inequalities and associated conjectures involving the Gaussian hypergeometric function 2 F 1 and closely related bivariate means. Recent {{as well as}} previously established results are presented for which the conjectures are known to hold. This basic investigation begins with the fundamental concept of a bivariate mean which {{is defined as a}} continuous function M: (0,∞) × (0,∞) → R satisfying min{x, y} ≤ M(x, y) ≤ max{x, y} for all x, y ≥ 0. Desirable properties possessed by some means include strictness: M(x, y) = x or M(x, y) = y if and only if x = y; symmetry: M(x, y) =M(y, x); and homo-geneity: M(λx, λy) = λM(x, y) for λ> 0. For the purpose of investigating inequalities involving a homogeneous mean M, it suffices to consider the form M(1, r). Passing back to the more general case is then accomplished by using xM(1, y/x) =M(x, y). Simple examples of <b>means</b> abound. <b>The</b> <b>arithmetic</b> <b>mean</b> A(x, <b>y)</b> ≡ x+y 2 and the geometric <b>mean</b> G(x, <b>y)</b> ≡ √xy are two of the most famous (homgeneous, symmetric, and strict) means. These two are in fact special cases of the family of power means given by Aλ(x, y) ...|$|R
40|$|A mean on a {{topological space}} X {{is defined as}} a mapping µ: X × X → X such that µ(x, y) = µ(y, x) and µ(x, x) = x for every x, y ∈ X (in other words, it is a symmetric, idempotent, {{continuous}} binary operation on X). In [30, p. 285] an approach to this concept is presented {{from the standpoint of the}} theory of hyperspaces (a mean on a continuum X can be defined as a retraction of the hyperspace F 2 (X) onto F 1 (X), see also [21, Section 76, p. 371]; compare also [16, Section 5, p. 18] and [17, Section 6, p. 496]). A natural problem that is related to this concept is what spaces, in particular what metric continua, admit a mean? No characterization is known till now. It is easy to give an example of a mean on the closed unit interval [0, 1] (e. g., <b>the</b> <b>arithmetic</b> <b>mean</b> µ(x, <b>y)</b> = x+y 2). Means on [0, 1], even in a more general setting, were studied by A. N. Kolmogoroff who described a structural form of these mappings in [24]. Functional equations of the type (1) f(µ(x, y)) = µ(f(x), f(y)) with a given mean µ on [0, 1] and unknown mapping f: [0, 1] → [0, 1] have bee...|$|R

The data was analyzed using statistical methods, including contingency tables and ANCOVA, to investigate the effects fair-share and center-of-balance instruction had on knowledge of fair-share, center-of-balance, and mathematical concepts regarding <b>the</b> <b>arithmetic</b> <b>mean.</b> A qualitative analysis of the verbal protocols helped explain any statistically significant connection between the fair-share and center-of-balance conceptualizations, or between either conceptualization and mathematical concepts related to <b>the</b> <b>arithmetic</b> <b>mean.</b> Analysis of <b>the</b> data indicated participants increased their knowledge of the fair-share conceptualization after receiving instruction that was focused on center-of-balance. Similarly, participants increased their knowledge of the center-of-balance conceptualization after receiving instruction that was focused on fair-share. In either case, the concept, 'the sum of the deviations from the mean is zero,' was used to transfer knowledge between the conceptualizations. In addition, instruction in either the fair-share or center-of-balance conceptualization increased knowledge of the mathematical concepts related to <b>the</b> <b>arithmetic</b> <b>mean.</b> However, only specific mathematical concepts were impacted by each of the conceptualizations.
