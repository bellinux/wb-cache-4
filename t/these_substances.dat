5|$|In {{the late}} 1980s, Roddenberry was likely afflicted {{by the first}} manifestations of {{cerebral}} vascular disease and encephalopathy {{as a result of}} his longstanding recreational use of legal and illicit drugs, including alcohol, cannabis, diazepam, secobarbital, methaqualone, methylphenidate, Dexamyl, and cocaine (which he had used regularly since the production of Star Trek: The Motion Picture). Throughout much of his career, he had routinely used stimulants to work through the night on scripts, especially amphetamines.

5|$|Many {{medicinal}} plants produce chemical compounds which {{give them an}} evolutionary advantage, such as defending against herbivores or, like salicylic acid, acting against other plants. These are often useful as drugs, and the content and known pharmacological activity of <b>these</b> <b>substances</b> in {{medicinal plants}} is the scientific basis for their use in modern medicine, and in the cases where medicinal plants have been analysed, also of some traditional medicines. The major classes of pharmacologically active phytochemicals are described below, with examples of medicinal plants that contain them.|$|E
5|$|Research {{conducted}} in 2003 suggests that extracts from Polyozellus multiplex may have suppressive effects on stomach cancer.

40|$|OBJECTIVES. The {{purpose of}} this study was to develop a model, using the {{epidemiologic}} tool of attributable risk, for estimating the cost of substance abuse to Medicaid. METHODS. Based on prior substance-use and morbidity research, population attributable risks for substance abuse-related diseases were calculated. (These risks measure the proportion of total disease cases attributable to smoking, drinking, and drug use.) The risks for each disease were applied to Medicaid hospital discharges and days on the 1991 National Hospital Discharge Survey that had these diseases as primary diagnoses. The cost of <b>these</b> <b>substance</b> abuse-related days were added to Medicaid hospital costs for direct treatment of substance abuse. RESULTS. More than 60 medical conditions involving 1100 diagnoses were identified, at least in part, as attributable to <b>substance</b> abuse. Factoring <b>these</b> <b>substance</b> abuse-related conditions into hospital costs, 1 out of 5 Medicaid hospital days, or 4 million days, were spent on substance abuse-related care in 1991. In 1994, this would account for almost $ 8 billion in Medicaid expenditures. CONCLUSIONS. The use of tobacco, alcohol, and drugs contributes significantly to hospital costs. To address rising costs, substance abuse treatment and prevention should be an integral part of any health care reform effort...|$|R
40|$|The most {{important}} question in the environmental research is presently the occurrence of the residues of pharmaceutical <b>substances</b> in ecosystem. <b>These</b> residues of drugs and their metabolites are entering our ecosystem by sewage water and {{lot of them are}} considered to be endocrine disruptors. The rhizofiltration is a possible method for the removal of this contamination. This work has researched the posibility of the phytoextraction of massively used non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID) like diclofenac, naproxen and ibuprofen by Helianthus annus, Zea mays and Pisum sativum plants. The course of the phytoextraction of <b>these</b> <b>substance</b> in in vitro sterile model was compared to the extraction of their mixtures and we proved the reciprocal influence of <b>these</b> <b>substance</b> to the root systém. The presence of diclofenac or ibuprofen in Helianthus annuus plants increased the extraction of naproxen from the cultivation medium, whereas ibuprofen and diclofenac mutually decreased the phytoextraction efficiency. The experiments with Zea mays showed inhibitive trends whereas the experiments with Pisum sativum showed no influence in extraction of the mixture in comparison to the trials with only one substance.

5|$|The Eurasian {{sparrowhawk}} {{population in}} Europe crashed {{in the second}} half of the 20th century. The decline coincided with the introduction of cyclodiene insecticides – aldrin, dieldrin and heptachlor – used as seed dressings in agriculture in 1956. The chemicals accumulated in the bodies of grain-eating birds and had two effects on top predators like the Eurasian sparrowhawk and peregrine falcon: the shells of eggs they laid were too thin, causing them to break during incubation; and birds were poisoned by lethal concentrations of the insecticides. Sub-lethal effects of <b>these</b> <b>substances</b> include irritability, convulsions and disorientation. In west Germany, around 80% of nests before the 1950s produced young, but only 54% were successful in the 1960s and '70s.|$|E
5|$|The {{evolution}} of chemical defences in plants {{is linked to}} the emergence of chemical substances that are not involved in the essential photosynthetic and metabolic activities. <b>These</b> <b>substances,</b> secondary metabolites, are organic compounds that are not directly involved in the normal growth, development or reproduction of organisms, and often produced as by-products during the synthesis of primary metabolic products. Although these secondary metabolites have been thought {{to play a major role}} in defenses against herbivores, a meta-analysis of recent relevant studies has suggested that they have either a more minimal (when compared to other non-secondary metabolites, such as primary chemistry and physiology) or more complex involvement in defense.|$|E

5|$|There is {{evidence}} that humans began using plant alkaloids in medical preparations as early as 3000 B.C. Although the active components of most medicinal plants have been isolated only recently (beginning in the early 19th century) <b>these</b> <b>substances</b> {{have been used as}} drugs throughout the human history in potions, medicines, teas and as poisons. For example, to combat herbivory by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species, Cinchona trees produce a variety of alkaloids, the most familiar of which is quinine. Quinine is extremely bitter, making the bark of the tree quite unpalatable, it is also an anti-fever agent, known as Jesuit's bark, and is especially useful in treating malaria.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} foods and {{substances}} {{have been found}} to disturb sleep, due to stimulant effects or disruptive digestive demands. Avoiding nicotine, caffeine (including coffee, energy drinks, soft drinks, tea, chocolate, and some pain relievers), and other stimulants in the hours before bedtime is recommended by most sleep hygiene specialists, as <b>these</b> <b>substances</b> activate neurobiological systems that maintain wakefulness. Alcohol near bedtime is frequently discouraged by clinicians, because, although alcohol can induce sleepiness initially, the arousal caused by metabolizing alcohol can disrupt and significantly fragment sleep. Smoking tobacco products before bed is also thought to reduce one's quality of resting by decreasing the time spent in deep sleep, leading to sleep fragmentation and nocturnal restlessness. Both consumption of a large meal just before bedtime, requiring effort to metabolize it all, and hunger have been associated with disrupted sleep; clinicians may recommend eating a light snack before bedtime. Lastly, limiting intake of liquids before bedtime can prevent interruptions due to urinations.|$|E

One such product, Oxycyte, has been through initial clinical trials. <b>These</b> <b>substances</b> can aid endurance athletes and are banned from sports; one cyclist's near death in 1998 prompted an investigation into their abuse. Applications of pure perfluorocarbon liquid breathing (which uses pure perfluorocarbon liquid, not a water emulsion) include assisting burn victims and premature babies with deficient lungs. Partial and complete lung filling have been considered, though only the former has had any significant tests in humans. An Alliance Pharmaceuticals effort reached clinical trials but was abandoned because the results were not better than normal therapies.|$|E
5|$|The {{euphotic}} zone is somewhat arbitrarily defined as {{extending from the}} surface to the depth where the light intensity is approximately 0.1–1% of surface sunlight irradiance, depending on season, latitude and degree of water turbidity. In the clearest ocean water, the {{euphotic zone}} may extend {{to a depth of}} about 150metres, or rarely, up to 200metres. Dissolved substances and solid particles absorb and scatter light, and in coastal regions the high concentration of <b>these</b> <b>substances</b> causes light to be attenuated rapidly with depth. In such areas the euphotic zone may be only a few tens of metres deep or less. The dysphotic zone, where light intensity is considerably less than 1% of surface irradiance, extends {{from the base of the}} euphotic zone to about 1000metres. Extending from the bottom of the photic zone down to the seabed is the aphotic zone, a region of perpetual darkness.|$|E
5|$|The {{skeleton}} of a stony coral in the order Scleractinia is secreted by the epidermis of {{the lower part of}} the polyp; this forms a corallite, a cup-shaped hollow made of calcium carbonate, in which the polyp sits. In colonial corals, following growth of the polyp by budding, new corallites are formed, with the surface of the skeleton being covered by a layer of coenosarc. These colonies adopt a range of massive, branching, leaf-like and encrusting forms. Soft corals in the subclass Octocorallia are also colonial and have a skeleton formed of mesogloeal tissue, often reinforced with calcareous spicules or horny material, and some have rod-like supports internally. Other anthozoans, such as sea anemones, are naked; these rely on a hydrostatic skeleton for support.
