25|$|Lake {{expressed}} interest in renegotiating her deal with Paramount:The studio feels that way about it too. They have indicated {{they are going to}} fuss more about the pictures in which I appear. I think I'll enjoy being fussed about... I want this to be the turning point and I think that it will. I am free and clear of unpleasant characters, unless they are strongly justified. I've had a varied experience playing them and also appearing as heroines. The roles themselves haven't been noteworthy and sometimes not even especially spotlighted, but I think they've all been beneficial in one way or another. From here on there should be a certain pattern of development, and <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> am going to fight for if necessary, though I don't believe it will be because they are so understanding here at Paramount.|$|E
25|$|Jim Wyatt, of the Tennesseean, {{reports that}} Ringer is the {{favorite}} for the 3rd string job, and almost a lock to make the roster. Fullback Ahmard Hall said “He’s a character guy, and you could tell that from the start, He’s the total package. You rarely get that combination of humility and natural athletic ability and I think he has that great combination. You combine those two and you get someone who could be unstoppable.’’ Of all the praise, Ringer responded, “I have to give credit to how I was brought up. I {{grew up in a}} religious family and I know without God none of this would be possible for me anyway, so that definitely keeps me humble. My personality is not to boast and brag about the accomplishments and things I am trying to do. Actions speak louder than words and <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> try and strive for.’’ In a 17-23 loss to the Cleveland Browns, Ringer only had one run for two yards. Ringer finished off the pre-season with a 7 carry 18 yard performance, in a 27-13 win over the Green Bay Packers.|$|E

[...] Moon later said in a talk to church members: [...] "Why did we put so much effort into the movie Inchon? No matter what the result the motivation was {{for people to understand}} about MacArthur. I wanted to show how MacArthur loved God and loved people. MacArthur came to Japan after World War II and put the nation back together. He really respected and loved the people. He also loved God very much and fought with great strength against tyranny and communism. <b>That</b> <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> want the people to understand." ...|$|E

Two years later, Guzmán entered the recording studio to record A + No Poder, which would become her first studio album in over five years. The album's songs were written by Guzmán and Argentinian musician José Luis Pagán. The singer stated that the album [...] "reflects maturity and growth that has also regains my rock essence since I was pigeonholed as a balladeer but not at all, <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> am." [...] A + No Poder is Guzmán's first studio album since Único (2009), a critically acclaimed effort that was commercial unsuccessful {{due to lack of}} promotion, according to Ángel Rodríguez of ADN Informativo.|$|E
500|$|Since {{completing}} {{the purchase of}} the club, Ashley has announced that he planned to sell the club on three different occasions. The first occurred after fan protests over the resignation of Kevin Keegan on 14 September 2008, when Ashley stated, [...] "I have listened to you. You want me out. <b>That</b> <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> am now trying to do." [...] However, he took it off the market on 28 December 2008 after being unable to find a buyer. On 31 May 2009, it was reported that Ashley was attempting to sell the club again. On 8 June 2009, Ashley confirmed that the club was up for sale at an asking price of £100million. By the end of August 2009, the club was back off the market. On 16 October 2017, Newcastle United announced that owner Mike Ashley had once again put the club up for sale, reporting that he hoped that a deal could be concluded by Christmas 2017.|$|E

500|$|The {{two sides}} to Poulenc's musical nature caused {{misunderstanding}} during his life and have continued to do so. The composer Ned Rorem observed, [...] "He was deeply devout and uncontrollably sensual"; this still leads some critics to underrate his seriousness. His uncompromising adherence to melody, both in his lighter and serious works, has similarly caused some to regard him as unprogressive. Although he was not much influenced by new developments in music, Poulenc was always keenly interested {{in the works of}} younger generations of composers. Lennox Berkeley recalled, [...] "Unlike some artists, he was genuinely interested in other people's work, and surprisingly appreciative of music very far removed from his. I remember him playing me the records of Boulez's Le marteau sans maître with which he was already familiar when that work was much less well-known than it is today." [...] Boulez did not take a reciprocal view, remarking in 2010, [...] "There are always people who will take an easy intellectual path. Poulenc coming after Sacre [...] It was not progress." [...] Other composers have found more merit in Poulenc's work; Stravinsky wrote to him in 1931: [...] "You are truly good, and <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> find again and again in your music".|$|E
500|$|At {{the age of}} 21 years old, Zamzam Mohamed Farah was {{the only}} female athlete {{competing}} for Somalia at the 2012 Summer Olympics. She was making her first appearance in the quadrennial event. Prior to the competition, Farah spoke of her and Mohamed's training which involved running through manned militia road blocks who occasionally mistaken them for suicide bombers and threatened to shoot them. Despite this, {{she said that she}} was [...] "very much excited" [...] to compete at the Games: “I hope I will win, inshah’Allah [...] <b>That</b> <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> am expected to do, so that I can change the narrative of Somalia.” Farah competed in the first heat of the women's 400 metre discipline on 3 August, finishing seventh and last of all runners, with a time of one minute and 20.48 seconds. She finished behind Geisa Coutinho of Brazil (53.43 seconds) and Kazakhstan's Marina Maslyonko (53.66 seconds) in a heat led by Francena McCorory of the United States (50.78 seconds). Farah finished 45th (and last) out of all runners overall, and was unable to advance into the semi-finals after finishing 28.39 seconds slower than the slowest competitor in her heat who made the later stages.

500|$|Air story {{revolves}} around three girls {{whose lives are}} connected to the same man. In the first story arc, Dream, Yukito Kunisaki is a showman traveling across Japan, continuing his late mother's search for the [...] "girl in the sky".Translated quote: [...] "...at {{the far end of the}} sky, there is a girl who has wings...from the distant past...even now, she is still there. <b>That</b> <b>is</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> heard from my mother when I was small. Before I could ask more clearly, my mother died. After that, I continued journeying alone. The myth of the girl in the sky." [...] The story opens on Monday July 17, 2000 when Yukito comes across a small seaside town where the story takes place. On his first day in town, Yukito tries to earn money by putting on a mysterious puppet show where he manipulates a doll magically without strings for a small audience of kids passing by. Yukito is unsuccessful in gaining the children's favor, and the children leave without paying him for his performance. That night, Yukito sleeps on the town's seawall by the beach. Yukito collapses from heat stroke the next day and is taken to a nearby fisherman's guild; after he awakens, they feed him, and give him some very large rice balls to take with him as he is leaving. As he sits on the town's seawall eating one of the rice balls, he notices a young girl beside him who introduces herself as Misuzu Kamio—a sincere yet clumsy girl who is eager to become friends with him. Misuzu persistently attempts to play with him, while Yukito tries to refuse her efforts. He eventually follows her home lured by the chance to eat. After Haruko, Misuzu's aunt and foster mother, is persuaded, it is decided that he will stay with them for the time being.Translated quote: [...] "...I understand. Stay here. Sleep in the garage." ...|$|E

2500|$|After {{becoming}} head {{of government}} in 1933, Adolf Hitler ignored the Versailles Treaty provisions. A command for armored forces was created within the German Wehrmacht: the Panzerwaffe, as {{it came to be}} known later. The Luftwaffe (the German air force) was established, and development began on ground-attack aircraft and doctrines. Hitler was a strong supporter of this new strategy.
