40|$|The article {{analyses}} {{problems facing}} electronic legislation development (especially legislation processes of publishing acts) in EU and EFTA member countries. All European countries were <b>publishing</b> acts <b>officially</b> on paper {{until the end}} of year 2000. The way of <b>publishing</b> acts <b>officially</b> was the same in all Europe countries, except that some counties had one “official journal” in which legal acts and other official documents and legal notices were published, and other countries had separate legal gazettes for acts publishing and an official gazette for publishing other official documents and legal notices. At the beginning of 2001 Norway started <b>to</b> <b>publish</b> acts <b>officially</b> in digital form, and only 12 - 20 times a year paper editions to present the statutes and regulations enacted since the publication of the previous issue are published. In 2002 Estonia decided <b>to</b> finish the <b>publishing</b> of paper editions, and started <b>to</b> <b>publish</b> acts only electronically. Till 2011 more than 10 European countries started <b>to</b> <b>publish</b> acts <b>officially</b> in digital format. Author discusses the advantages, principles, and legitimate expectation of electronic legislation. For future electronic legislation information systems developments the following principles should be a guide: broad/universal and equal access to legislation, reliability of the means of publicity, integrity of information, easy access to the requisite information. The advantages of digital act forms, and internet based publications are instantaneous outreach to the public, free of charge, information easily accessible and retrievable, voluminous technical acts easier to handle, no printing costs, more environmentally-friendly, more and more people use ICT to seek information, no time constraints to the availability of data, legal certainty will be granted. The author thinks that before creating future digital legislation information systems, some procedures shall be done. If we want to have pan-European information systems of legislation, EU should adopt standards for better information exchange, and for legislation process unification. The author thinks that non-consolidated versions of law acts are old fashioned, and are not suitable for modern digital legislation. Countries should change procedures of legislation, only consolidated versions of acts would be adopted, used and officially recognized. The article talks about technical issues of digital legislation information systems, legal XML, semantic search, Web 2. 0. (for example: user comments) and Web 3. 0. (for example: user rankings, other possible search) and artificial intelligence technologies shall be used. Author focus also is on an interesting project in Sweden—lagen. nu. It is a unique practice, based on the same idea like Wikipedia: cost free, users make content, open source software and the most user friendly service available at the moment in legislation services. Some experience could be taken in to government projects, for example involving users to create better content and better legislation...|$|R
5000|$|In 2004, the {{newspaper}} printed seven articles by columnist Georgy Rozhnov, which accused Sergey Kiriyenko of embezzling US$4.8 billion of International Monetary Fund funds in 1998 {{when he was}} Prime Minister of Russia. The newspaper based the accusations on a letter allegedly written to Colin Powell and signed by U.S. Congressmen Philip Crane, Mike Pence, Charlie Norwood, Dan Burton and Henry Bonilla and posted on the website of the American Defense Council. The newspaper went on to claim that Kiriyenko had used some of the embezzled funds to purchase real estate in the United States. It was later revealed that the letter was a prank concocted by The eXile. In response, Kiriyenko sued Novaya Gazeta and Rozhnov for libel, and in passing judgement in favour of Kiriyenko the court ordered Novaya Gazeta to retract all publications relating to the accusations {{and went on to}} say that {{the newspaper}} [...] "is obliged <b>to</b> <b>publish</b> only <b>officially</b> proven information linking Mr Kiriyenko with embezzlement." ...|$|R

40|$|In {{his long}} address called “Why Lausanne?” Dr Billy Graham clearly stated the reason and purpose {{to have the}} International Congress on World Evangelization by saying that “we are met to pray, talk, plan and to advance the work of evangelism,” and he adds: “This is a conference of evangelicals. The {{participants}} were asked to come because you are evangelical-concerned with evangelism and missions; and we here tonight stand firmly in the evangelical tradition of Biblical faith. ” Here we can find two specific reasons for the congress: to discuss for furtherance of world evangelism and to bring evangelicals together for a united front of the world evangelization. For this purpose the invitations were sent to all over the world. According <b>to</b> statistics <b>published</b> <b>officially</b> by the congress six continents sent their representatives to the congress responding to the invitation though it was sent on individual basis: 458 from Africa, 729 from Asia, 1 115 from North and Central America, 777 from Europe, 180 from South America and 150 from Oceania.

The results {{that are based on}} 12 selected journals show that submitting preprints to arXiv has become more common in the past few years, but the number of papers submitted to Quantitative Biology is still small and represents {{only a fraction of the}} total research output in biology. An immense advantage of arXiv is to overcome the long publication delay resulting from peer review.
