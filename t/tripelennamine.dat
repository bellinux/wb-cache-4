5000|$|In the 1970s, {{recreational}} drug users discovered that combining pentazocine with <b>tripelennamine</b> (a first-generation ethylenediamine antihistamine most commonly dispensed under the brand names Pelamine and Pyribenzamine) produced a euphoric sensation. Since <b>tripelennamine</b> tablets are typically blue {{in color and}} brand-name Pentazocine is known as Talwin (hence [...] "Ts"), the pentazocine/tripelennamine combination acquired the slang name Ts and blues.After health-care professionals and drug-enforcement officials became aware of this scenario, the mu-opioid-antagonist naloxone was added to oral preparations containing pentazocine to prevent perceived [...] "misuse" [...] via injection, and the reported incidence of its recreational use has declined precipitously since.|$|E

Cough medicine of the general formula <b>tripelennamine</b> + codeine/dihydrocodine/hydrocodone ± expectorant ± decongestant(s) is quite popular where available. One example is the line of Pyribenzamine Cough Syrups which contains codeine and with and without decongestants listed in the 1978 Physicians' Desk Reference; the codeine-tripelennamine synergy is well-known and does make such mixtures more useful for their intended purposes.|$|E

50|$|Pyridine {{is used as}} a {{precursor}} to agrochemicals and pharmaceuticals and is also an important solvent and reagent.

50|$|While all sedating antihistamines will potentiate {{the effects}} of codeine, enzyme {{induction}} leading to greater hepatic conversion of codeine to morphine {{is the reason for}} both the clinical and recreational use of promethazine with codeine. This was the case all the more with another drug, Doriden (glutethemide) (q.v.) Codeine and glutethimide were taken in combination known as Loads, Dors & Fours, and Six Packs (two Doriden tablets or 1000 mg of glutethimide and four tablets of a codeine combination totalling 240 mg of codeine) as a substitute for heroin or a primary opioid drug of choice; first mentioned in medical journals in the late 1960s, then reappearing along with Ts & Blues (pentazocine and <b>tripelennamine)</b> during the late 1970s. Glutethimide was off the market by the end of 1988 around the world, but the use of this combination is apparently a major driver for the small amount of illicit glutethimide synthesis uncovered since that time. Taking the combination on an empty stomach was particularly favoured for partially approximating the rush and bang of injecting heroin or morphine.|$|E
50|$|The {{following}} {{drugs have}} DRI action {{and have been}} or are used clinically specifically for this property: amineptine, dexmethylphenidate, difemetorex, fencamfamine, lefetamine, levophacetoperane, medifoxamine, mesocarb, methylphenidate, nomifensine, pipradrol, prolintane, and pyrovalerone. The following drugs are or have been used clinically and possess only weak DRI action, {{which may or may}} not be clinically-relevant: adrafinil, armodafinil, bupropion, mazindol, modafinil, nefazodone, sertraline, and sibutramine. The following drugs are or have been clinically used but only coincidentally have DRI properties: benzatropine, diphenylpyraline, etybenzatropine, ketamine, nefopam, pethidine (meperidine), and <b>tripelennamine.</b> The following are a selection of some particularly notably abused DRIs: cocaine, ketamine, MDPV, naphyrone, and phencyclidine (PCP). Amphetamines, including amphetamine, methamphetamine, MDMA, cathinone, methcathinone, mephedrone, and methylone, are all DRIs as well, but are distinct in that they also behave, and potentially more potently as dopamine releasing agents (DRAs) (it should be noted that due to Yerkes-Dodson's law, 'more potently stimulated' may not equal more optimally functionally stimulated). There are very distinct differences in the mode of action between dopamine releasers/substrates & dopamine re-uptake inhibitors; the former are functionally entropy-driven (i.e. relating to hydrophobicity) and the latter are enthalpy-driven (i.e. relating conformational change). Reuptake inhibitors such as cocaine induce hyperpolarization of cloned human DAT upon oocytes that are naturally found on neurons, whereas releasing agents induce de-polarization of the neuron membrane.|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} tnpelennamine on {{pentazocine}} antinociception in rats was investigated utilizing a low temperature (51. 5 #{ 176 }C) hot-plate technique. <b>Tripelennamine</b> (1 0 and 20 mg/kg i. p.) showed some antinociceptive activity, {{which was not}} antagonized by naloxone. Pentazocine antinociception was potentiated by si-multaneous administration of a large dose (20 mg/kg) but not a small dose (5 mg/kg) of tnpelennamine. Potentiation was not observed when <b>tripelennamine</b> was administered 2 hr before the injection of pentazoCine and Chronic administration of tnpelen-namine for 14 days did not alter pentazocine antinociceptive activity. After administration of pentazocine and <b>tripelennamine,</b> levels of pentazocine under concentraon-time curves {{in the brain and}} plasma were slightly and significantly larger, respec-tively, than the levels obtained by the administration of penta-zocine alone. After the administration of <b>tripelennamine</b> and pentazocine, the brain <b>tripelennamine</b> concentration at 1 / 4 hr was about 2. 6 times that after the administration of tnpelennamine alone. The results suggest that the effect of tnpelennamine on pentazocine antinociception is additive; very little was through a mechanism of inhibition of pentazocine metabolism. The abuse of <b>tripelennamine</b> (pyribenzamine) with paregoric was documented as early as 1964 (Wendt et al., 1964). The use of antihistamines with opioids by drug abusers has been re-ported with increasing frequency in recent years.

40|$|Meiosis is {{a highly}} {{regulated}} developmental process that occurs in all eukaryotes that engage in sexual reproduction. Previous epidemiological work shows that male and female infertility is rising and environmental factors, including pollutants such as organic solvents, are thought {{to play a role}} in this phenomenon. To better understand how organic compounds interfere with meiotic development, the model organism Saccharomyces cerevisiae was exposed to 446 bioactive molecules while undergoing meiotic development, and sporulation efficiency was quantified employing two different high-throughput assays. 12 chemicals were identified that strongly inhibited spore formation but did not interfere with vegetative growth. Many of these chemicals are known to bind to monoamine-receptors in higher eukaryotes and are cationic amphiphilic drugs. A detailed analysis of one of these drugs, <b>tripelennamine,</b> revealed that it induces sporulation-specific cytotoxicity and a strong inhibition of meiotic M phase. The drug, however, only mildly interfered with pre-meiotic DNA synthesis and the early meiotic transcriptional program. Chemical-genomic screening identified genes involved in autophagy as hypersensitive to <b>tripelennamine.</b> In addition, we found that growing and sporulating yeast cells heterozygous for the aminophospholipid translocase, NEO 1, are haploinsufficient in the presence of the drug...|$|E

40|$|From July 1979 to June 1983, 25 of 40 {{intravenous}} drug addicts with systemic infections had Pseudomonas aeruginosa as the etiological agent; by 1982, P. aeruginosa had replaced Staphylococcus aureus {{as the most}} common pathogen. At least 21 of the 25 addicts with P. aeruginosa infection abused pentazocine mixed with <b>tripelennamine</b> (commonly known as T's and blues) compared with 6 of 15 addicts infected with other pathogens (P = 0. 006). Of the 25 P. aeruginosa isolates, 23 were of serotype O 11. Phenotypic patterns in isolates from addicts and in 22 serotype O 11 control isolates from nonaddicts were determined by pyocin and electrophoretic enzyme typing, {{as well as by}} susceptibility to heavy metals and antibiotics. Of 25 isolates from addicts, 20 were identical or differed by only one marker, whereas the 22 nonaddict serotype O 11 isolates were distributed among 17 distinct phenotypic patterns. We postulate that the emergence of P. aeruginosa as the major cause of deep infection in addicts is a consequence of contamination of their paraphernalia during preparation of pentazocine and <b>tripelennamine</b> for self-injection.

40|$|The {{mechanisms}} of reflex vasodilation were studied in an innervated canine hindlimb preparation which was perfused {{at a constant}} rate. Reflex vasodilation was produced by suddenly increasing the pressure in the trunk by the intravenous injection of norepinephrine, with consequent stimulation of the baroreceptors. When the basal vasoconstrictor tone exerted by the sympathetic nervous system on the systemic arterial bed was minimized, either by pretreatment with the alpha adrenergic blocking agent phenoxybenzamine or with reserpine, which depletes endogenous catecholamine stores, reflex vasodilation was virtually abolished. Administration of cocaine, a drug which blocks reuptake of norepinephrine by the nerve terminals, significantly reduced reflex vasodilation, the response after cocaine averaging 47 % of the vasodilator response in the control period. Cocaine also potentiated the vasoconstriction caused by intra-arterially administered norepinephrine but attenuated the vasoconstriction induced by tyramine. The antihistamine, <b>tripelennamine,</b> had effects {{similar to those of}} cocaine. It is suggested, therefore, that reflex vasodilation results from a sudden decrease in the level of norepinephrine at the neuroeffector junction, which is a consequence of the cessation of norepinephrine secretion, together with continued and possibly augmented uptake. When the uptake mechanism is impaired, either by the administration of cocaine or <b>tripelennamine,</b> the magnitude of reflex vasodilation is diminished. It does not appear necessary to postulate active secretion of a vasodilator substance to account for reflex vasodilation...|$|E

Stimulation of the H 1 receptor by histamine (range 0. 18 to 17. 8 mumol/l) significantly increased prostaglandin E (PGE) production, while activation of the histamine H 2 receptor increased intracellular cyclic adenosine- 5 '-monophosphate (AMP). The histamine H 1 antagonists mepyramine and <b>tripelennamine</b> blocked the histamine induced increase in PGE production, and the H 2 antagonists cimetidine and ranitidine prevented the increase in intracellular cyclic AMP.
