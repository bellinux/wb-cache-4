5|$|Baird {{was criticized}} in late 1999 {{for refusing to}} cancel a five-year {{contract}} that had been signed between his department and the Bermuda-based private firm Andersen Consulting (later Accenture), worth up to $180 million. The contract, signed when Janet Ecker was Community and Social Services minister, entrusted Andersen with providing technological upgrades to the province's welfare management system. The arrangement was criticized by Auditor General Erik Peters, who observed that <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> contract to prevent Andersen from increasing its hourly rates. A published report in early 2000 indicated that Andersen was charging an average of $257 per hour for work {{that had previously been}} done by ministry staff at $51 per hour. Another report indicated that the firm had charged a total of $55 million to find roughly $66 million worth of savings. In response to opposition questions, Baird said that he would not terminate the contract but would endeavour to negotiate a lower rate. Baird opposed the Harris government's plan to amalgamate the city of Ottawa with neighboring municipalities, which was approved by the legislature in 1999.|$|E
25|$|After {{investigation}} by the Marine Board of {{the master of the}} Advance, J. E.

25|$|The {{case was}} one of 11 {{decisions}} of the High Court referred to by the Attorney-General, Billy Hughes, as cutting down the Commonwealth's powers until they were futile and justifying the changes proposed in the 1913 referendum. The case however was not decided {{on the basis of}} the constitution, thus despite the reference to this case by the Attorney-General, <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 1913 referendum that would have affected its outcome.|$|E
25|$|There is no rule stating a team {{must play}} a wicket-keeper. On 5 June 2015 during a T20 Blast {{game between the}} Worcestershire Rapids and the Northamptonshire Steelbacks, Worcestershire chose not to play a wicket-keeper in the 16th over of the match. Their keeper, Ben Cox, became an extra fielder at fly slip while spinner Moeen Ali bowled. The umpires {{consulted}} {{with each other and}} agreed that <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> rules to prevent it from happening.|$|E
25|$|In , four of {{the sixteen}} {{countries}} taking part, France, Spain, the Netherlands and the United Kingdom, all tied for first place with 18 points each. <b>There</b> <b>was</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> rules to decide an outright winner, so all four were declared joint winners. This caused much discontent among {{most of the other}} participating countries, and mass walkouts were threatened. Finland, Norway, Sweden and Portugal did not participate in the 1970 Contest as a protest against the results of the previous year. This prompted the EBU to introduce a tie-break rule.|$|E

25|$|Davis {{disagreed}} with the majority's view that Congress had consented to {{the transfer of the}} two counties when it debated the proposed West Virginia constitution. <b>There</b> <b>was</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> debates to ever suggest that, he wrote. What Congress agreed to was that the two counties should be offered the chance to join West Virginia {{by the time of the}} new state's admission to union with the United States. These conditions had not been met by the time of admission, and thus no transfer could be constitutionally made. Congress had not agreed to additional legislative acts of transfer, and thus they could not be made without Virginia's assent (which was now withdrawn).|$|E
25|$|On 23 March, Wintzingerode with 8,000 cavalry and 40 guns arrived near Vitry-le-François while Mikhail Semyonovich Vorontsov with Wintzingerode's {{infantry}} plus Langeron and Sacken {{were coming}} up behind. Yorck and Kleist reached Château-Thierry. After a captured French message indicated that Napoleon was at Saint-Dizier, the Allies decided to merge their two armies and go after Napoleon with 200,000 troops. With the French emperor already blocking their supply line to Germany, the Allies determined {{to establish a new}} line from the Netherlands to Laon. At Bar-sur-Aube, Emperor Francis I of Austria was warned to leave for Dijon. Francis fled to safety with the Austrian Army of the South a few hours ahead of the French cavalry. On the evening of 23 March, a message from Napoleon's Chief of Police Anne Jean Marie René Savary was intercepted by Friedrich Karl von Tettenborn's Cossacks. It stated that <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> arsenals and treasury at Paris and that the city's increasingly restive population was demanding peace. More information arrived from Napoleon's enemies in Paris.|$|E
500|$|In 1886 the High Court of Justice in London {{ruled in}} the Parks case—Jenks v. Turpin—that baccarat {{was a game}} of chance rather than skill, and was {{therefore}} illegal when gambling was involved. In reporting the case, The Times described baccarat as [...] "a new game, partly of chance, at which £1,000 may be lost in 20 minutes". After a solicitor asked the Home Secretary, Henry Matthews, to clarify the position regarding baccarat in social clubs and private houses, the Home Office civil servant Godfrey Lushington stated that <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> court's judgment that made baccarat illegal if not played for money.|$|E

[...] "Their mums and dads were married. They had brothers and sisters. They had afternoon tea. They had a cooked dinner. I never had that. I'd get {{home from school and}} <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> cupboard. I would eat mouldy bread and drink water because that would fill me up". Coulter grew up mostly on her own because her mother worked two jobs to pay the bills. During primary school, Coulter participated in many sports, including swimming, touch football and netball, which she played for six years. When Coulter was nine years old, her mother met John, a man of Scottish descent who is now her step father. Coulter has two half-sisters, Jodie and Emily.|$|E
500|$|The Observer (The Guardians sister paper) {{published}} {{an image of}} Tomlinson on the ground on Sunday, 5 April. That morning Tomlinson's family attended the scene of his death, where they met Paul Lewis, a Guardian reporter who had worked on The Observer story. Tomlinson's wife said this meeting was the first the family had heard of police contact with Tomlinson before his death. The family's police liaison officer later approached the newspaper {{to say he was}} [...] "extremely unhappy" [...] that Lewis had spoken to the family, and that the newspaper had to stay away from them for 48 hours. The IPCC accused the newspaper of [...] "doorstepping the family at a time of grief." [...] On the same day, the IPCC briefed other journalists that <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> story that Tomlinson might have been assaulted by police. During this period, according to Tomlinson's family, they were prevented from seeing his body; they were first allowed to see him six days after his death.|$|E
500|$|The SFPA {{deferred}} to the Magnuson–Stevens Act for its {{definition of a}} fishing vessel. According to that statute, a fishing vessel was one that either engaged in fishing, or [...] "aiding or assisting one or more vessels at sea {{in the performance of}} any activity relating to fishing, including, but not limited to, preparation, supply, storage, refrigeration, transportation, or processing." [...] Moskowitz rejected NOAA's argument that the KD II was engaged in fishing and therefore a fishing vessel because, under its previous ownership, it had been equipped with longline equipment and held a federal permit. That had lapsed shortly after Tran and Yu bought the ship and was no longer valid, so neither was the argument based on paper. [...] "Whether the KD II is in fact a fishing vessel under [...] depends on its configuration and how it was outfitted {{at the time of the}} seizure," [...] he wrote. Since <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> record about that, he declined to decide the question on that grounds.|$|E

500|$|After {{arriving}} in Harlem, Sims began performing {{on the street}} {{as he had done}} in California, but faced stiff competition from other innovative dancers: [...] "I knew people who danced on dinner plates... There was a man who could dance on newspapers without tearing them. And another who constructed a gigantic xylophone to tap on." [...] He performed on corners in between working whatever jobs he could find, and then discovered the [...] "Amateur Night" [...] stage on Wednesdays at the Apollo Theater, where he soon gained local notoriety. He eventually won the Amateur Night competition a record-breaking 25 times, after which a rule was instituted that performers could no longer compete once they had earned four first prizes.When big name dancers played The Apollo, <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> audience but dancers with their shoes," [...] said Sandman Sims. [...] "Up in the balcony dancers, and the first six rows, you saw nothing but tap-dancers, want-to-be tap-dancers, gonna-be tap-dancers, tried-to-be tap-dancers. That's the reason a guy would want to dance at The Apollo.By the mid-1950s, he had been hired as the Apollo's stage manager, and soon began his role as the Apollo's famed [...] "executioner", chasing Amateur Night contestants the crowd disapproved of off the stage with a shepherd's crook (known since vaudeville times as [...] "the hook") a broom, or other props, while dressed in a variety of wacky costumes, whether long underwear, a clown suit, or even a diaper. Backstage, however, he would console defeated contestants with the story of his having been booed off ten times before he finally got to finish his own act. Sims would play [...] "executioner" [...] until shortly after Time Warner took over the Apollo in 1999.|$|E
500|$|Brownlee {{remained}} {{intimately involved}} in the grain industry even outside the UGG, in part through {{his position on the}} Canadian Federation of Agriculture executive. [...] In this capacity, he found himself {{in the middle of a}} controversy over the British Wheat Agreement (BWA). [...] The BWA was an agreement to sell wheat to British clients at a fixed price over a four-year period. [...] The price was to be adjusted during the following two years, [...] "having regard to" [...] world wheat prices. [...] During the first four years, world wheat prices were continually above the price stipulated in the agreement, breeding resentment towards the British, especially since they sold much of this fixed price wheat for a large profit in European markets. [...] This was exacerbated when the British refused to adjust the price upwards for the last two years, on the grounds that <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>nothing</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> agreement to compel them to do so. [...] The result was considerable ill will and a loss by grain farmers of an estimated $350 million. [...] The federal government, which had negotiated the agreement, offered to supplement the British payments by $65 million, a sum large enough to raise the ire of eastern Canadians but too small to placate western farmers. [...] Brownlee, who had opposed the agreement, authorized a purchase of advertising across the country pointing out that the government fixed the domestic price of wheat at $0.77 per bushel while the world price reached as high as $2.18. [...] In Brownlee's view, the $65 million payment by the government paled in comparison to the benefit to consumers of the federal policy. [...] Subsequent international agreements, for which Brownlee acted as an advisor to the Canadian delegation, resulted in more favourable terms for farmers. [...] Brownlee's continued status as one of the grain industry's leading figures was also exhibited by his involvement in government relations. [...] He appeared before the Canadian House of Commons Standing Committee on Agriculture to oppose a system of allocating box cars to each grain elevator by formula, favouring instead a system whereby the Canadian Wheat Board retained the flexibility to assign them as it saw fit. [...] In his September 1960 submission to the Royal Commission on Transportation, In Defense of the Crow's Nest Pass Rates, he rejected the railways' calls to deregulate the rates they charged for the shipment of grain.|$|E
