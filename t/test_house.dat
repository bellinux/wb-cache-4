40|$|Problem statement: In the {{information}} age, {{the process of}} E-Commerce (EC) operates quickly and the present enterprises of Taiwan {{have to face the}} Free Cross-Strait Market (FCSM) with Mainland China, which will definitely change the model as well as the performance of the supply chain. Hence, this study focuses on the issue of supply chain performance evaluation of the wafer <b>testing</b> <b>house</b> in Taiwan. Approach: This investigation applied the Fuzzy Analytic Hierarchy Process (FAHP) to derive the weights of influential indicators for evaluating the supply chain performance of the wafer <b>testing</b> <b>house</b> and the Grey Relation Analysis (GRA) was used to evaluate the performance between the FCSM and EC aspects. Results: The analyzed results had identified the indicator weight of the supply chain performance evaluation in the wafer <b>testing</b> <b>house</b> and the indicator performances between different aspects were compared. The research results indicated that the FCSM aspect had better performance than EC aspect of the supply chain evaluation in the wafer <b>testing</b> <b>house.</b> Conclusion/Recommendations: Based on the analyzed results, the managers can find out the problems and improve the supply chain performance of the wafer <b>testing</b> <b>house.</b> This study not only can be a good basis for improvements of the case company, but also can be the reference for evaluating the supply chain performance of the wafer <b>testing</b> <b>house...</b>|$|R

40|$|Results of {{side-by-side}} {{radiant barrier}} experiments using two identical 144 ft 2 (nominal) <b>test</b> <b>houses</b> are presented. The <b>test</b> <b>houses</b> responded very similarly to weather variations {{prior to the}} retrofit. The temperatures of the <b>test</b> <b>houses</b> were controlled to within 0. 3 ?F. Ceiling heat fluxes were within 2 percent for each house. The results showed that a critical attic ventilation flow rate (0. 25 CFM/ft 2) existed after which the percentage reduction produced by the radiant barrier systems was not sensitive to increased airflows. The ceiling heat flux reductions produced by the radiant barrier systems were between 25 and 34 percent, with 28 percent being the reduction observed most often {{in the presence of}} attic ventilation. All results presented in this paper were for attics with R- 19 unfaced fiberglass insulation and for a perforated radiant barrier with low emissivities on both sides...|$|R
