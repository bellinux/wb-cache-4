40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{focuses on}} a paradigm shift that is taking place {{within the field of}} cultural memory studies. Recently, several scholars from around the world have focused on the possibility of transcultural memory and the transcultural construction of meaning. My research offers a constructive addition to the current theory, namely that transcultural memory is not as broad and universal as many understand. <b>To</b> <b>support</b> this argument, I have taken the Alexander von Humboldt reception history within the United States and Germany to demonstrate that transcultural memory coalesces around specific memory sites that are mutually constructed among cultures for a common purpose. I show that in the years following German reunification, the U. S. -American and German textual representation, use, and understanding of Alexander von Humboldt have come to be practically identical. I go on to posit that it is in such specific instances that transcultural memory is created, and not through a supposedly universal and transnational remembrance of historical events. My research clarifies certain concepts and elements regarding the turn to the transcultural in recent memory studies in that it demands a much more specific and concrete understanding of the processes at work in meaning making in an interconnected and globalized world. In order to show such a shared transcultural understanding, I have collected and studied all published materials regarding Alexander von Humboldt in the United States and Germany since the year 1990. In this way, my dissertation serves not only <b>to</b> <b>support</b> <b>my</b> central <b>thesis</b> regarding the constitution of transcultural memory, it also functions as a detailed textual survey of Humboldt within the two cultures over the last twenty-five years...|$|R

I further argue that what Suzi Gablik analyzed as empathy for the audience or community leads these artists to develop specific socio-artistic practices and provide services they wished they had during their youth or formative years.

40|$|In this work, I {{examine the}} nature of sacred time in {{religious}} experience. Applying the methodology of phenomenology of religion, I inspect {{the ways in which}} human beings experience sacred time in Hinduism and present an argument against Mircea Eliade’s understanding of {{the nature of}} sacred time in Hinduism. Eliade asserted that all sacred time in Hinduism is fundamentally circular in nature and that the experience of sacred time is an experience of the original act of creation being made consciously present to the individual. ^ I will scrutinize Eliade’s arguments on two fronts. Firstly, I argue against Eliade’s claim that all sacred time is circular in nature within Hinduism. Instead, I maintain that while some sacred time is indeed circular, linear, or historically grounded sacred time also exists in Hinduism. ^ <b>To</b> <b>support</b> <b>my</b> arguments, I draw on case examples from both sacred texts and the scholarly interpretations of those texts in Hinduism. After the introductory chapter which details my methodology, I begin in the second chapter by clarifying the difference between sacred and profane time and then outlining Eliade’s conception of sacred time and specifying the flaws that I find in his theory. In the third chapter, I explore circular sacred time in Hinduism, finding in some instances Eliade was correct to argue that sacred time is circular in nature. In the fourth chapter, I offer evidence <b>to</b> <b>support</b> <b>my</b> primary <b>thesis</b> that Hinduism also features numerous instances of linear sacred time which Eliade had attributed only to religions that are more contemporary. Eliade’s claim that only circular sacred time is present in Hinduism creates inconstancies within his theory of sacred time. ^ In the fifth chapter, I provide and then rebut possible counter-arguments against my theory of linear sacred time in Hinduism centering on Eliade’s conception of avatars and myth. Lastly, I conclude chapter six with a summary of my arguments which revise the phenomenological understanding of sacred time in Hinduism to include both circular sacred time and linear sacred time. ...|$|R
40|$|I offer a {{critical}} exploration of tensions experienced by disabled {{people in the}} construction of positive identities in everyday contexts in which self-understanding is shaped both by social structural relations of inequality and unique individual experience. The empirical evidence I use <b>to</b> develop and <b>support</b> <b>my</b> <b>thesis</b> involves data I have generated using a variety of data collection tools, through a series of interviews, conversations and observations carried out with sixteen disabled people across Scotland and England. I argue that while certain barriers to participation in ordinary community life may be being removed, perceptions of impairment as something ‘wrong’ with the bodies of disabled people remain embedded in dominant disability discourse. There is a structural purpose underlying the continued representation of impairment as misfortune, involving the ascription of a negative role – the disabled role – to those whose bodily configurations pose a challenge to requirements of conformity. Drawing on insights generated in my research, and building on an idea originally proposed by John Swain and Sally French in 2000, I have developed a clarified affirmative model of disability. This I intend as a tool to be used by people with impairments in making sense of the disabling social relations they encounter in everyday contexts, to be used alongside the social model in gaining knowledge to unsettle mainstream assumptions which can only recognise impairment as personal tragedy.

40|$|The {{target of}} this thesis is to {{formulate}} {{and defend the}} statement {{that there is no}} clear distinction between the propaganda and public relations methods in the field of international politics. The fundamentals of this thesis represent empirical observations and their subsequent analysis in various case studies. Many of these case studies date back to early history, that's why the corresponding literature was used as source of information. In addition, the nature of propaganda is often connected with miscellaneous affairs of international extent. Its true impact is revealed eventually. To confirm the preliminary thesis there are partial targets and steps stated in the introduction. The first step was to determine own area of definitions, in compliance with the generally accepted standpoints, to which I also often refer. <b>To</b> <b>support</b> <b>my</b> <b>thesis</b> I decided to apply some mathematical processes, and so I imagined the notions as sets according to certain criterion. This way of thinking allowed me to view the notions as non-empty set, equal to the intersection of international politics, propaganda and public relations.

Various interesting not necessarily historically important case studies of propaganda campaigns represent another partial step confirming the thesis that propaganda and public relations in international relations are not importantly different...|$|E

40|$|During {{the first}} eight years of former President Putin in office, the Russian economy made giant steps in order {{to catch up with}} her Western rivals. The {{legislative}} processes that former President Yeltsin launched in order to concentrate the power in the President’s hand, were successful and these measures paved the way towards a semi-authoritarian regime. The developments achieved by Mr. Putin could not have been carried out without relying massively on Russia’s vast gas and oil supplies. First and foremost the paper tries to show the significance of these scarce resources through various examples, global trends and patterns. The paper will also allow the reader to learn how possessing natural resources can influence political systems and what effects they had on Russia. One of the main goals of the paper is to reveal what factors have contributed to the re-emergence of the Russia Federation since 2000 by analyzing transition trends and policy goals.

They are characterized by spaces formed with a basic technology in which social relationships take place. -The basic technology is man-made land and man-made climate. Therefore you can establish systems of man-made land and systems of man-made climate. -Social relationships are the interplay of activities within a social structure. As a result you can establish systems of grouping of functions and systems of organization of structures. - The formation of space with a basic technology involves placing things together, placing them apart, connecting different spaces and establishing an orderly whole. For that purpose you can establish systems of separation, systems of integration and systems of linkage. -In all the above mentioned systems we can establish hierarchies. On the other hand, cities are formed by three basic elements: The physical-environment, man and society. The physical environment can be broken down to nature, networks and shelters (the last two as a product of man and society's forces). -The study of nature, man, society, shelters and networks will allow us to determine how, where and why the systems should be utilized.

The influx of technology, advertising, images in the media and changes within modern cultural and family values play a big role in the psychological evolution of consumers in the food service industry. My goal is to discover how the images in advertisements and media influence our desire to purchase food and alter our perception on what makes food appealing. In this thesis paper, I will start off with an introduction of how consumerism has changed since the use of advertisements first began. I will reflect on the “traditional” value of food in comparison to the modernized concept of food, and introduce the emergence of fad foods and food trends in society. This introduction will allow me to further branch out into the topics of the psychological role in consumerism, as well as the roles of gender, socio-economic identity, cultural identity, and later on in the paper, the portrayal of health and beauty in the media. Next, I will begin to analyze my sources <b>to</b> <b>support</b> <b>my</b> <b>thesis.</b> I will use scholarly articles, essays, statistics from scientific studies, and other reliable sources for analyzing information, and will elaborate on the main ideas to further solidify my argument.

40|$|Women 2 ̆ 7 s {{reproductive}} rights are an extremely contentious {{issue in the}} United States. I argue that women must be equally represented in government {{for it to be}} just to write and pass legislation regarding women 2 ̆ 7 s {{reproductive rights}}. Throughout this thesis, I consider reproductive rights as negative rights that aim to protect procreative liberty for women. Procreative liberty is the freedom for people to choose to either procreate or refrain from doing so. As a negative right, procreative liberty is the protection of a man or woman’s ability to make the choice to procreate without interference from others or the government. In this thesis, I provide four main arguments that support why it is necessary that women are equally represented in government in order for legislation concerning women’s reproductive rights to be just legislation. This thesis is broken into four main sections. Each section addresses either one argument <b>to</b> <b>support</b> <b>my</b> <b>thesis</b> or is a response to an objection to my thesis argument. The first section of my thesis is dedicated to addressing the two bad consequences that occur when a legislative body made up mostly of male representatives write and pass laws concerning women’s reproductive rights. The second section discusses the continued subordination of women in the United States. The third section is a response to the objection that it is just for a legislation body made up mostly of men to write and pass laws regarding women 2 ̆ 7 s reproductive rights because the government body was voted in democratically. The fourth and final section provides the argument that it is not just because legislation of this nature does not affect men and women equally...|$|E

The desire to improve maths teaching in Swedish schools is strong, especially by laboratory work. How is it then that several teachers in our schools are still using the traditional way of teaching mathematics, which I consider to be relying a lot on the textbook and work for an automated approach? The purpose of my study is to investigate how three different math teachers on an F- 5 school in the southern Stockholm area, choose to work with mathematics and why they choose to work according to a special approach. In order to obtain the information I seek, I have chosen to use the qualitative method to get a better understanding of my results. I have both observed the teachers during mathematics lessons on multiple occasions and interviewed the three teachers individually. The theories I have chosen <b>to</b> <b>support</b> <b>my</b> <b>thesis</b> on are the socio-cultural perspective and the cognitive perspective. Based on the results of my investigation I found that teaching in general assumes a lot from the textbook. Teachers in the survey feel a sense of security, to build upon the textbook, which they consider covers much of the knowledge students should have. The teachers use the textbook as a base and complements with laboratory features and communicate mathematics. The approach they choose to use has a lot of time allocated for teaching mathematics. Time isn’t enough for all the teachers {{to do what they want}} and they are worried that students will forget the basics of mathematics. Even the large number of students in the class plays the role of the choice of working, because all students should have time to develop...|$|E
