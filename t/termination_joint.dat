The variety of surface mount device (SMD) terminations, solder pad shape and surface properties, soldering processes, and properties of solder pastes currently leads to ill-understood and ad hoc methods of specifying component <b>terminations,</b> <b>joint</b> geometry, and soldering parameters and to the consequent risk of reduced process yields for SMD-to-printed-circuit-board connections. The authors attempt to relate the design and process variables to their effects on final joint quality and production process stability. It is pointed out that the migration of manufacturers from vapor-phase to infrared (IR) reflow soldering has gone some way to reduce the occurrences of many of the reflow soldering defects. However, despite the improvement provided with the IR reflow technique, any gains in reducing the number of occurrences per joint of these defects will to a large extent be counteracted by the significant increase in interconnections expected in the near future...|$|R

40|$|Background: Joint {{attention}} {{in young children}} is important to later developmental outcomes. Differences in engagement in joint attention are reported for young children with autism, with less joint {{attention in}}itiating and response behaviours found in staged research situations. Greater understanding of entry into joint attention, and duration and <b>termination</b> characteristics of <b>joint</b> attention in young children with autism in naturalistic situations could inform early intervention and support for individuals on the autism spectrum. Objectives: This study analysed early joint attention characteristics in two monozygotic twins, one of whom has a diagnosis of autism, in videoed family situations {{in the first two}} years of the children's life. By comparing the joint attention episodes of the two twins in naturalistic situations, the study aimed to reveal possible differences in successful initiation characteristics as well as duration and termination patterns for the twins. Methods: Home videotapes of first and second birthday events for the two siblings were analysed retrospectively using specialised software for recording, coding and analysing sequences, frequencies and durations of observed events. Characteristics of initiation, duration and <b>termination</b> of <b>joint</b> attention episodes between the mother and each child were coded and examined. Results: A greater number of joint attention bids per minute were made by the mother to the twin with autism in the first year events, although a higher proportion of initiation bids were successful with the child without autism. The most successful types of initiation with the twin with autism were tapping and showing, however, the most successful types of initiation with the twin without autism were verbalization and giving. Overall, a greater number of joint attention episodes were established between the mother and the twin with autism, however, these were of markedly shorter duration than the episodes between the mother and child without autism, with the duration of joint attention episodes for the mother and child with autism being half of that found for the mother and twin without autism. Noticeably, in the first year events, joint attention was always terminated by the child with autism and not the mother, whereas both the mother and the child without autism terminated their joint attention episodes. By the second birthday the mother terminated joint attention with both twins and both twins also terminated their joint attention episodes. Conclusions: The frequency, duration, and <b>termination</b> of <b>joint</b> attention episodes were found to be different for the two twins in this small study, one of whom has a diagnosis of autism. This develops the findings of previous studies, by highlighting that joint attention in natural situations can be frequently engaged in by a child with autism, but that the characteristics of these joint attention episodes differ from those with a child without autism, being initiated differently, considerably shorter and terminated by the child. It is argued that understanding of the differences in characteristics of the successful initiation, duration and <b>termination</b> patterns of <b>joint</b> attention episodes for these infants will help in informing supportive approaches to engaging and sustaining joint attention with young children with autism...|$|R

The findings propose a model of joint venture development highlighting the driving forces at each stage of development.

40|$|When {{partners}} {{decide to}} leave <b>Termination</b> of a <b>joint</b> company between competitors Industrial relationships consist of different phases, ranging from establishment to termination. Of all phases, the termination {{process has been}} studied least. In {{order to get a}} holistic understanding of industrial relationship, more research is needed within this area. Several researchers have recently stressed the importance of studying the termination of business relationships. There is especially scarce research about termination of relationships between competitors although earlier research within the field shows that these can be more vulnerable to termination than vertical relationships. The objective of the paper is to analyse the <b>termination</b> of a <b>joint</b> company between competitors. The research questions are: Why was the joint company terminated? And: How is the termination process formed? The empirical part of the paper is based on a case study consisting of personal interviews. The findings of the study show that the reasons for termination can be found on three dimensions: external, company and individual related. The most prominent reason was the recession, which forced the companies to cooperate on an international market in order to survive. The process of termination consists of the following phases: harmony, negligence, withdrawal, communication and break-up. These findings are described in models. Generally the empirical results differ from previous research within the field, as communication and assessment took place later on in the termination process...|$|R

40|$|Amphibolite facies ductile shear zones {{developed}} during the immediate post-intrusive cooling history of the Adamello tonalites (Southern Alps, Italy). Shear zones include: (i) thin (a few mm's thick) fault-like shear zones that accommodate shear strain values up to several 100 ’s (the dominant type); (ii) mylonitic horizons (dm's thick) in sharp contact with the undeformed wall rock; (iii) continuous shear zones with sigmoidal-shaped S or composite S–C′ foliations. A transition between the different types occurs along strike over short distances. Discontinuous shear zones are also localized on pegmatite dykes and quartz veins, and both (i) and (ii) are discontinuously outlined by quartz layers. Detailed surface mapping reveals that most fault-like shear zones are arranged en-échelon, mainly forming contractional steps. Markers crosscut by shear zones allow the displacement to be measured at several positions along shear zones and this reveals very steep displacement gradients close to the shear zone tips. Differential displacement is mainly accommodated at contractional steps {{by the development of}} foliated domains. Geochemical analyses of major and trace elements show that there is no compositional change along strain gradients. The overall features are consistent with nucleation of shear zones on former sets of en-échelon joints, in many cases intruded by pegmatite dykes or filled with quartz. Reactivation of joints produced strongly localized shear zones, whereas broader foliated zones evolved from the contractional jogs between adjacent stepped <b>joint</b> <b>terminations</b> during progressive shearing.

40|$|The {{reliability}} of power supply {{has become an}} increasingly significant factor in modern society. The aging of the existing network, the increased quality requirements of electric supply {{and the risk of}} major interruptions due to storms are factors that are driving towards the cabling of the distribution network. It is important to develop a condition management process for medium voltage cables to be able to optimize the construction and total life cycle costs of such of a cable network. Due to its hidden structure the condition of a cable network can be evaluated only by means of measurements. It is widely acknowledged that a clear dependence exists between the deterioration of the cable and partial discharges. For years, partial discharge measurements have been used as part of condition management in case of single expensive electrical equipment like generator etc. and it is proofed to be a working solution. The goal of this work is to bring out the main principles of on-line partial discharge measurements and the current situation in case of extruded medium voltage cables. In addition, aging and other phenomena leading to faults and partial discharges related to these phenomena in extruded medium voltage cables have been studied. Finally, guidelines about how on-line partial discharge measurements could be used as part of condition monitoring of medium voltage cables have been created. The nature of this work is a literature survey and the source material mainly consists of international publications. The temperature, voltage stress and moisture are the main factors that accelerate the aging of solid insulation. Thus overloading should be avoided, voltage stresses should be minimized and water proof components should be used. Cable <b>joints</b> and <b>terminations</b> seem to be the most fault prone components in the medium voltage cable network and in most cases partial discharges can be spotted before the breakdown. It is also noted that the quality of workmanship in the installation of cable accessories plays an important role while the {{reliability of}} these components is concerned. This work concludes that on-line partial discharge measurements are the most suitable for detecting problems in the cable <b>joints,</b> <b>terminations</b> or metallic shield. The evaluation of the general condition of a cable system is very challenging with current on-line partial discharge measurement systems because voltage above normal operation voltage can’t be used during measurements. In addition, in many cases also the measurement sensitivity is not good enough. With continuous measurements, reliable time to next breakdown estimations can be made. The biggest challenges for continuous measurements are related to their cost-effectiveness. The future will show whether these kinds of measurement increase or not...|$|R
