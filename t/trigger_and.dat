40|$|OBJECTIVE: Patient-ventilator {{synchrony}} during non-invasive pressure support ventilation {{with the}} helmet device is often compromised when conventional pneumatic <b>triggering</b> <b>and</b> cycling-off were used. A possible {{solution to this}} shortcoming is to replace the pneumatic triggering with neural <b>triggering</b> <b>and</b> cycling-off-using the diaphragm electrical activity (EA(di)). This signal is insensitive to leaks and to the compliance of the ventilator circuit. DESIGN: Randomized, single-blinded, experimental study. SETTING: University Hospital. PARTICIPANTS AND SUBJECTS: Seven healthy human volunteers. INTERVENTIONS: Pneumatic <b>triggering</b> <b>and</b> cycling-off were compared to neural <b>triggering</b> <b>and</b> cycling-off during NIV delivered with the helmet. MEASUREMENTS <b>AND</b> RESULTS: <b>Triggering</b> <b>and</b> cycling-off delays, wasted efforts, and breathing comfort were determined during restricted breathing efforts (< 20 % of voluntary maximum EA(di)) with various combinations of pressure support (PSV) (5, 10, 20 cm H(2) O) and respiratory rates (10, 20, 30 breath/min). During pneumatic <b>triggering</b> <b>and</b> cycling-off, the subject-ventilator synchrony was progressively more impaired with increasing respiratory rate and levels of PSV (p < 0. 001). During neural <b>triggering</b> <b>and</b> cycling-off, effect of increasing respiratory rate and levels of PSV on subject-ventilator synchrony was minimal. Breathing comfort was higher during neural triggering than during pneumatic triggering (p < 0. 001). CONCLUSIONS: The present study demonstrates in healthy subjects that subject-ventilator synchrony, <b>trigger</b> effort, <b>and</b> breathing comfort with a helmet interface are considerably less impaired during increasing levels of PSV and respiratory rates with neural <b>triggering</b> <b>and</b> cycling-off, compared to conventional pneumatic <b>triggering</b> <b>and</b> cycling-off...|$|R

5|$|After a first {{interruption}} in development, {{the project}} was redefined as a short interactive demo for Windows-based personal computers. New team members, including professional artists and designers, were recruited for the demo, which would feature ten scenes from Chrono <b>Trigger</b> <b>and</b> most of its playable characters.

5|$|Böcker later {{explained}} {{that the decision to}} focus on Square Enix was made due to the large library of games to choose from, all of which he felt had a distinct sound, and many of which were very well known in Germany. An emphasis was put on balancing out the concert program and the arrangements, so that the music would appeal to first-time listeners, classical music fans, and longtime gamers. The titles chosen to be featured in the concert were Kingdom Hearts and Kingdom Hearts II from the Kingdom Hearts series, Secret of Mana, Chrono <b>Trigger</b> <b>and</b> Chrono Cross from the Chrono series, and the Final Fantasy series. In order to select the pieces presented, the original composers were consulted to assemble a list of their personal favorites. The composers were Yoko Shimomura for the music of Kingdom Hearts, Hiroki Kikuta for the music of Secret of Mana, Yasunori Mitsuda for the music of Chrono <b>Trigger</b> <b>and</b> Cross, and Nobuo Uematsu for the music of the Final Fantasy series.|$|E

5|$|The Chrono {{series is}} {{a video game}} {{franchise}} developed and published by Square Enix (formerly Square). It began in 1995 with the time travel role-playing video game Chrono Trigger, which spawned two continuations, Radical Dreamers and Chrono Cross. The music of Chrono Trigger was mainly composed by Yasunori Mitsuda, with a few tracks composed by regular Final Fantasy composer Nobuo Uematsu. The Chrono Trigger soundtrack has inspired four official album releases by Square Enix: a soundtrack album in released by NTT Publishing in 1995 and re-released in 2004, a greatest hits album published by DigiCube in 1999, published in abbreviated form by Tokyopop in 2001, and republished by Square Enix in 2005, an acid jazz arrangement album published and republished by NTT Publishing in 1995 and 2004, and a 2008 orchestral arranged album by Square Enix. Corresponding with the Nintendo DS release of the game, a reissued soundtrack was released in 2009. An arranged album for Chrono <b>Trigger</b> <b>and</b> Chrono Cross, entitled To Far Away Times, was released in 2015 to commemorate the 20 year anniversary of Chrono Trigger.|$|E
5|$|The P90 was {{designed}} to have a length no greater than a man's shoulder width, {{to allow it to}} be easily carried and maneuvered in tight spaces, such as the inside of an armored vehicle. To achieve this, the weapon's design uses the unconventional bullpup configuration, in which the action and magazine are located behind the <b>trigger</b> <b>and</b> alongside the shooter's face so that there is no wasted space in the stock. The P90's dimensions are minimized by its unique horizontally mounted feeding system, wherein the box magazine sits parallel to the barrel on top of the weapon's frame. The weapon overall has an extremely compact profile—it is the most compact fixed-stock submachine gun to be made. The standard version of the weapon has an overall length of 500mm (19.7in), a height of 210mm (8.3in), and a width of 55mm (2.2in).|$|E
5|$|To {{initiate}} {{firing the}} weapon the trigger mechanism, which was essentially just a large spring, {{had to be}} cocked, and to do this was a difficult and awkward process. The user had to first place the PIAT on its butt, then place two feet on the shoulder padding and turn the weapon to unlock the body and simultaneously lock the firing pin to the butt; the user would then have to bend over and pull {{the body of the}} weapon upwards, thereby pulling the spring back until it attached to the <b>trigger</b> <b>and</b> cocking the weapon. Once this was achieved, the body was then lowered and turned to reattach it {{to the rest of the}} weapon, and the PIAT could then be fired. Users of a small stature often found the cocking sequence challenging, as they did not have the sufficient height required to pull the body up far enough to cock the weapon; it was also difficult to do when lying in a prone position, as was often the case when using the weapon in action.|$|E
