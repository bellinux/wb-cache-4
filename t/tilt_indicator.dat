50|$|A {{clinometer}} or inclinometer is {{an instrument}} for measuring angles of slope (or tilt), elevation or depression of an object with respect to gravity. It {{is also known as}} a tilt meter, <b>tilt</b> <b>indicator,</b> slope alert, slope gauge, gradient meter, gradiometer, level gauge, level meter, declinometer, and pitch & roll indicator. Clinometers measure both inclines (positive slopes, as seen by an observer looking upwards) and declines (negative slopes, as seen by an observer looking downward) using three different units of measure: degrees, percent, and topo (see Grade (slope)#Nomenclature for details). Astrolabes are inclinometers that were used for navigation and locating astronomical objects from ancient times to the Renaissance.|$|E

40|$|A {{crossover}} study was performed comparing serum kinetics and urinary excretion in six healthy, fasting volunteers after ingcstion of comparable amounts of lenampicillin, bacampicillin and amoxycillin. Venous blood samples and urine samples were taken at intervals for 6 and 12 h respectively post-tablet ingestion and assayed for free ampicillin or amoxycillin concentration with Bacillus sub <b>tilts</b> as <b>indicator</b> organism. The most rapid T ^ {{and the highest}} CmMX were achieved with lenampicillin. The AUC was similar for lenampicillin, bacampicillin and amoxycillin as was the total percentage urinary recovery of antibiotic. Potential pharmacokinetic advantage of orally administered lenampicillin and bacampicillin compared to comparable doses of amoxycillin are higher peak serum concentrations (12 - 0 mg/ 1 lenampicillin; 9 - 7 mg/ 1 bacampicillin; 7 - 6 mg/ 1 amoxycillin) and more rapid time to peak concentration (0 - 6 h lenampicillin; 07 h bacampicillin and 1 - 4 h amoxycillin) ...|$|R
40|$|The {{structural}} {{evolution of}} Central Europe reflects contrasting tectonic regimes after the Variscan orogeny during Mesozoic â€“ Cenozoic time. The brittle deformation {{related to each}} tectonic regime is localized mainly along major fault zones, creating complex fracture patterns and kinematics through time with diverging interpretations on the number and succession of the causing events. By contrast, fracture patterns in less deformed domains often provide a pristine structural inventory. We investigate the brittle deformation of a relatively stable, wide area of the central German platform using fault-slip data to identify the regional stress fields required to satisfy the data. In a non-classical approach, {{and in order to}} avoid local stress variations and misinterpretations, the fault-slip data are scaled up throughout the study area into subsets of consistent kinematics and chronology for sedimentary cover and crystalline basement rocks. Direct stress tensor inversion was performed through an iterative refining process, and the computed stress tensors were verified using field-based observations. Criteria on relative <b>tilt</b> geometry and <b>indicators</b> of kinematic change suggest a succession of events, which begins with a post-Triassic normal faulting regime with ? 3 axis trending NE-SW. The deformation then follows by strike-slip and thrust faulting regimes with a change of ? 1 axis from N-S to NE-SW, supposedly in the Late Cretaceous. Two younger events are characterized by Cenozoic normal and oblique thrust faulting regimes with NW-SE-trending ? 3 and ? 1 axes, respectively. The fracture patterns of both the cover and basement rocks appear to record the same states of stress...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{investigate}} the sympathetic and parasympathetic cardiovascular function in primary Sjogren's syndrome (SS) and to {{investigate the}} possible relation with ocular dryness. METHODS: 41 (40 women) patients with primary SS, mean age 50 years (range 20 - 80) with a mean disease duration of eight years (range 1 - 30), were studied. In each patient direct arterial blood pressure (BP), heart rate (HR) and respiration were measured continuously for two hours. The function of the autonomic circulatory regulation was evaluated by measuring the heart rate response to deep breathing (6 cycles/min) and {{by means of the}} Valsalva manoeuvre and the responses of BP, HR and plasma noradrenaline (norepinephrine) concentrations to a 10 minute 60 degree head up tilt test. Pupillography was done to evaluate ocular autonomic function. RESULTS: The HR-Valsalva ratio was abnormal in 24 % of the patients, and the HR variability during forced respiration was abnormal in 56 % of the patients. The HR responses to both the Valsalva manoeuvre and deep breathing, as indicators of parasympathetic function, were abnormally low in 6 of 41 (15 %) patients. In only two patients the decrease in systolic BP in response to the head up <b>tilt</b> test, as <b>indicator</b> of sympathetic function, was more than 20 mm Hg. However, increment of plasma noradrenaline concentration during head up tilt test and the overshoot of BP in phase IV of the Valsalva manoeuvre, as indicators of sympathetic function, were normal in both patients. Thus, no evidence for sympathetic dysfunction was found, whereas evidence for parasympathetic failure occurred sometimes. Autonomic pupillary function in patients with primary SS and healthy controls, as well as the Schirmer test in patients with or without evidence for parasympathetic dysfunction as {{based on the results of}} the Valsalva and deep breathing tests, were not significantly different. CONCLUSION: Parasympathetic, but not sympathetic dysfunction seems to occur in a subgroup of primary SS. Results show that this does not necessarily contribute to the typical ocular dryness in this condition...|$|R
