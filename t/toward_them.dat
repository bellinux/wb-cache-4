5|$|In al-Karak, an-Nasir Ahmad had Tashtamur and Qutlubugha {{executed}} for unclear reasons. The move to execute them appalled the public, with whom an-Nasir Ahmad was steadily losing credibility with. The executions {{were seen as}} a testament of an-Nasir Ahmad's ingratitude {{to the men who}} had supported him and virtually installed him as sultan. Historian Joseph Drory argues that it was because Tashtamur and Qutlubugha compelled him to assume the sultanate and remove him from his self-imposed isolation in al-Karak that made an-Nasir Ahmad resentful <b>toward</b> <b>them.</b>|$|E
5|$|None of {{them knew}} {{the color of the}} sky. Their eyes glanced level, and were {{fastened}} upon the waves that swept <b>toward</b> <b>them.</b> These waves were of the hue of slate, save for the tops, which were of foaming white, and all of the men knew the colors of the sea. The horizon narrowed and widened, and dipped and rose, and at all times its edge was jagged with waves that seemed thrust up in points like rocks.|$|E
5|$|The {{prosecution}} presented four {{witnesses to}} the court. Robert Chobert, a cab driver who testified he was parked behind Faulkner, identified Abu-Jamal as the shooter. Cynthia White, a prostitute, testified that Abu-Jamal emerged from a nearby parking lot and shot Faulkner. Michael Scanlan, a motorist, testified that from two car lengths away, he saw a man, matching Abu-Jamal's description, run {{across the street from}} a parking lot and shoot Faulkner. Albert Magilton, a pedestrian who did not see the shooting, testified to seeing Faulkner pull over Cook's car. As Abu-Jamal started to cross the street <b>toward</b> <b>them,</b> Magilton turned away and lost sight of what happened next.|$|E

5|$|Before the {{rebellion}} at the Stonewall Inn, homosexuals were, as historians Dudley Clendinen and Adam Nagourney write, a secret legion of people, known of but discounted, ignored, laughed at or despised. And like the holders of a secret, {{they had an}} advantage which was a disadvantage, too, and which was true of no other minority group in the United States. They were invisible. Unlike African Americans, women, Native Americans, Jews, the Irish, Italians, Asians, Hispanics, or any other cultural group which struggled for respect and equal rights, homosexuals had no physical or cultural markings, no language or dialect which could identify them to each other, or to anyone else... But that night, for the first time, the usual acquiescence turned into violent resistance.... From that night {{the lives of millions}} of gay men and lesbians, and the attitude <b>toward</b> <b>them</b> of the larger culture in which they lived, began to change rapidly. People began to appear in public as homosexuals, demanding respect.|$|E
5|$|Cöln was {{assigned}} to patrols off the island of Heligoland at the outbreak of World War I in early August 1914, as the flagship of Rear Admiral Leberecht Maass. At the Battle of Heligoland Bight on 28 August 1914, the German patrol forces were attacked by superior British forces, including five battlecruisers and several light cruisers. Cöln was initially stationed {{in support of the}} forces on the patrol line. She attempted to reinforce the beleaguered German forces, and encountered Vice Admiral David Beatty's battlecruisers. She was hit several times by the battlecruisers' large-caliber guns, but managed to escape in the haze. She inadvertently turned back <b>toward</b> <b>them,</b> however, and was quickly disabled when the battle resumed. The crew abandoned Cöln, but German vessels did not search the area for three days, and only one man survived.|$|E
5|$|De Grasse {{ordered his}} fleet {{to prepare for}} action, and {{on the morning of}} April29 sailed for Fort Royal with the convoy ships hugging the coast and the armed ships in battle line. Hood's fleet was seen bearing <b>toward</b> <b>them</b> around 08:00 but deGrasse held the weather gauge. At about 09:20, Hood was joined by Prince William, a 64-gun ship that had been at St. Lucia. The two fleets {{continued}} to push for advantageous positions. Hood's leeward position prevented deGrasse from bringing the convoy to the harbour, but the four previously blockaded French ships were able to sail out and strengthen deGrasse's position. Gibraltar, as Drake's flagship, led the British rear division.|$|E

5|$|The SPARS enjoyed {{success in}} the work place, but they also {{suffered}} a degree of intolerance at times. On more than one occasion, male guardsmen would {{make the point that}} the USCG had struggled along without women for over 150 years. Attitudes <b>toward</b> <b>them</b> ranged from enthusiasm and amusement to open hostility. But not all the objections were personal or petty. Many of the men simply failed to see the need for women in the service, while others felt it was an unnecessary expense. However, if the women were equal to the job the men were willing to give them their due. Many men, regulars and reservists, supported them, taught them the ropes, and gave them encouragement.|$|E
5|$|The third {{counter-insurgency}} {{operation in}} Kozara was undertaken {{at the end}} of November 1941 by about 19,000 Croatian Home Guards, Ustaše, and Germans. The Partisans emerged from the operation without significant losses, though NDH propaganda claimed that the rebels in Kozara were destroyed and that Stojanović had been killed. The Kozara Partisans never repeated the mistake of frontal resistance. When stronger enemy forces advanced <b>toward</b> <b>them,</b> they manoeuvred to position themselves behind the attackers, thus avoiding battles they could not win. The Partisans therefore did not defend villages. During the third counter-insurgency operation, the Ustaše and Germans killed hundreds of Serb civilians in the villages, resulting in a loss of support for the Partisans among the population. Stojanović thought that a significant victory over the enemy would {{be the best way to}} restore the lost support.|$|E

However this formation {{may have been a}} later conception; Barbara's portrait seems to have been executed some time after her husband's and it is unusual for a husband to be placed to the viewer's right in paired panels. His father's panel is considered the superior work and has been described as one of Dürer's most exact and honest portraits. They are among four paintings or drawings Dürer made of his parents, each of which unsentimentally examines the deteriorating effects of age. His later writings contain eulogies for both parents, from which the love and respect he felt <b>toward</b> <b>them</b> is evident.|$|E

5|$|Bhairava {{then takes}} Mithra, his soldiers, and his caretakers to the Bhairavakona temple atop a cliff to seek blessings from God. Mithra demands Bhairava admit {{his love for}} her. When he does not respond, she upsets the sacred items they have brought for the puja and, using her own blood, paints an image on a nearby rock of Bhairava leaving his true love to do his duty. An injured soldier arrives to tell Bhairava that Ranadev and Sher Khan's army have killed Vikram Singh and are now rushing <b>toward</b> <b>them.</b> They arrive shortly, and Sher Khan {{challenges}} Bhairava to battle his soldiers. Bhairava boldly accepts the challenge and kills a hundred soldiers, but is severely injured in the process. Sher Khan, impressed by Bhairava's bravery, has a change of heart. However, Ranadev continues attacking, eventually wounding Mithra fatally, but he is in turn killed by Bhairava. A dying Mithra asks Bhairava to confess his love, but before he can respond, she dies and falls off the cliff. Distraught, he follows her and falls to his own death.|$|E
5|$|The next morning, the two {{armies of}} unequal {{strength}} {{faced each other}} across frozen fields fissured by ice-covered streams and ponds, which were in turn covered by snow and drifts. The snow and gloom meant that neither side {{was aware of the}} inequalities of men and artillery. Napoleon opened the engagement by sending Soult's's corps, which successfully pushed the Russian right flank back, nearly turning the Russian force. To follow up on this success, he ordered Pierre Augereau's force to attack the left center. No sooner had Augereau and VII Corps, plus St. Hilaire's division, sallied out when a sudden snow storm engulfed the battle field. In white-out conditions, Augereau's entire corps disappeared in a flurry of whirling snow. When the snow cleared, friend and foe alike discovered that the first units onto the field had wandered off course. The line of march should have taken them directly to the Russian flank; have no point of reference, they had instead followed the terrain and led the entire corps parallel to the Russian line, along a V-shaped formation in which the left and center merged, and directly into the face of the Russian 70–gun batteries. The artillery, although shocked to find a French Corps advancing straight <b>toward</b> <b>them,</b> immediately opened fire, as did the Russian infantry on both sides of Augereau's corps.|$|E

"As {{we passed}} the two-story little frame house {{occupied}} by the American Club, we noticed that the balcony had been decorated all around with wreaths of evergreens and flowers, and the flag was flying from the pole on the roof. Stanzey, the consul, and Arkright, a gold-mine owner, were smoking on the balcony. Me and Liverpool waved our dirty hands <b>toward</b> <b>'em</b> and smiled real society smiles; but they turned their backs to us and went on talking. And we had played whist once with the two of 'em up {{to the time when}} Liverpool held all thirteen trumps for four hands in succession.
