5|$|Some Orthodox Jewish codifiers warn against {{inserting}} {{fingers into}} the cracks of the Wall as <b>they</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> breadth of the Wall constitutes part of the Temple Mount itself and retains holiness, while others who permit doing so claim that the Wall is located outside the Temple area.|$|E
5|$|In {{assessing}} {{the work of}} Tkach, there are two points of view. The critics of Tkach, especially those who formed the splinter churches, see Tkach as the key person responsible for {{the collapse of the}} WCG. <b>They</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> changes he brought were a turn against God and say his rejection of Armstrong's unique doctrines were, at best, without biblical foundation.|$|E
5|$|But {{the aliens}} became extinct before {{completing}} their work. As {{the human race}} bred and evolved, only a percentage retained their psychic abilities, which surfaced only sporadically. For centuries the buried ship had occasionally triggered those dormant abilities, which explained the reports of poltergeists; people were unknowingly using their own telekinesis to move objects around, and the ghost sightings were traces of a racial memory. The authorities, and Breen in particular, find this explanation preposterous despite being shown the recording of Barbara's vision. <b>They</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> craft is a Nazi propaganda weapon and the alien bodies fakes designed to create exactly the impressions that Quatermass has succumbed to, and decide to hold a media event to stem the rumours that are already spreading.|$|E

5|$|Cooper, Truman and Brennan visit a {{veterinarian}} connected to Gerard; they find twine there {{of the type}} used to bind Laura. <b>They</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> bird that clawed her body {{is one of the}} animals being treated there, and confiscate the practice's files in order to locate the owners of birds being treated there. They learn that the scratches have been caused by a myna, and that drug smuggler Jacques Renault (Walter Olkewicz) owns one. They raid Renault's home, interrupting Briggs, who is planting Johnson's bloodied shirt. He flees, undetected; however, the shirt is recovered as evidence.|$|E
5|$|In {{keeping with}} their history, the Churches of Christ claim the New Testament as their sole rule {{of faith and}} {{practice}} in deciding matters of doctrine and ecclesiastical structure. They view the Old Testament as divinely inspired and historically accurate, {{but they do not}} consider its laws to be binding under the New Covenant in Christ (unless they are repeated in the New Testament) (Hebrews 8: 7-13). <b>They</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> New Testament demonstrates how a person may become a Christian (and thus a part of the universal Church of Christ) and how a church should be collectively organized and carry out its scriptural purposes.|$|E
5|$|The Khawalid {{brothers}} {{share an}} anti-West conservative ideology. <b>They</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> West is conspiring with Iran against Bahrain and other Gulf Cooperation Council countries and often accuse the United States of secretly supporting the Bahraini opposition. They are allied with Saudi Arabia and Sunni Islamist groups, and hold an anti-Shia ideology, viewing {{them as a}} fifth column to Iran. Based on their beliefs, the Khawalid brothers have pushed a security approach {{to deal with the}} Shia instead of political reforms, and have allegedly used sectarianism as a political tool.|$|E

5|$|On {{the other}} hand, {{there are also}} many incompatibilists who reject the {{argument}} because <b>they</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> will is free in a stronger sense called libertarianism. These philosophers affirm {{the course of the}} world is either a) not completely determined by natural law where natural law is intercepted by physically independent agency, b) determined by indeterministic natural law only, or c) determined by indeterministic natural law in line with the subjective effort of physically non-reducible agency. Under Libertarianism, the will {{does not have to be}} deterministic and, therefore, it is potentially free. Critics of the second proposition (b) accuse the incompatibilists of using an incoherent concept of freedom. They argue as follows: if our will is not determined by anything, then we desire what we desire by pure chance. And if what we desire is purely accidental, we are not free. So if our will is not determined by anything, we are not free.|$|E
25|$|Voluntary liquidations {{occur when}} the company's members decide voluntarily to wind up {{the affairs of the}} company. This may be because <b>they</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> company will soon become insolvent, or it may be on {{economic}} grounds if <b>they</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> purpose for which the company was formed is now at an end, or that the company is not providing an adequate return on assets and should be broken up and sold off.|$|E

25|$|The International TWU {{issued a}} {{statement}} demanding that Local 100 TWU members return to work immediately, {{in light of the}} court injunction and the illegality of the strike. This statement would legally remove culpability from the International TWU in regards to fines levied by the courts. Additionally, International TWU leaders stated publicly <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>believed</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> strike should not have taken place as <b>they</b> <b>believed</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> talks were progressing, and <b>that</b> <b>the</b> last offer made by the MTA was fair and a show of willingness to compromise.|$|R

50|$|Salimiyya (السالمية) was a Sufi {{movement}} in Basra, named after Muhammad ibn Ahmad ibn Salim (d. 297/909) {{and his son}} Ahmad (d. 356/967). <b>They</b> <b>believed</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> individual letters and sounds of the Qur'an are eternal.|$|R
25|$|Writing in the 1960s, the {{historian}} Gene Weltfish drew from earlier work of Wissler and Spinden {{to suggest that}} the sacrificial practice might have been transferred in the early 16th century from the Aztec of present-day Mexico. More recently, historians have disputed the proposed connection to Mesoamerican practice. <b>They</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> sacrifice ritual originated separately within ancient traditional Pawnee culture.|$|E

5000|$|In {{the late}} 1980s, {{international}} development agencies regarded AIDS control {{as a technical}} medical problem rather than one involving all areas {{of economic and social}} life. Because public health authorities perceived AIDS to be an urban phenomenon associated with prostitution, <b>they</b> <b>believed</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> majority of Africans who lived in [...] "traditional" [...] rural areas would be spared. <b>They</b> <b>believed</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> heterosexual epidemic could be contained by focusing prevention efforts on persuading the so-called core transmitters—people such as sex workers and truck drivers, known to have multiple sex partners—to use condoms. These factors retarded prevention campaigns in many countries for more than a decade.|$|R
