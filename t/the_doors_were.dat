The body was taken back to the courtroom at Shire Hall, where it was slit open along the abdomen to expose the muscles. The crowds were allowed to file past until six o'clock, when <b>the</b> <b>doors</b> <b>were</b> shut. According to the Norwich and Bury Post, over 5,000 people queued to see the body.|$|E

The case was {{heard by the}} Lord Justice-Clerk, David Boyle, {{supported}} by the Lords Meadowbank, Pitmilly and Mackenzie. The court was full shortly after <b>the</b> <b>doors</b> <b>were</b> opened at 9:00am, and a large crowd gathered outside Parliament House; 300 constables were on duty to prevent disturbances, while infantry and cavalry were on standby as a further precaution.|$|E
5|$|The Buddhists in Saigon {{were aware}} that a raid on the pagodas was imminent. Buddhist {{relatives}} of Special Forces and combat police personnel had tipped off the monks, and Buddhists who lived near pagodas had observed them move into {{the region in the}} lead-up. American journalists were tipped off and traveled through Saigon to visit the pagodas ahead of the raids. The pagodas had been locked by the monks in preparation for the attacks and <b>the</b> <b>doors</b> <b>were</b> barricaded with furniture and reinforced by nailing wooden planks across them. The monks told members of the U.S. press corps in Saigon that the raids were coming, allowing them to be more prepared for the event than the U.S. embassy.|$|E

5|$|The {{industrial}} fire {{claimed the}} lives of at least ten people, who were unable to escape because <b>the</b> <b>doors</b> <b>were</b> locked shut illegally. Authorities, in response to local residents' angry criticism, admitted that the emergency response to the accident was substandard. Two separate investigations were launched. One inquiry focused on the fire itself, while the other sought to ascertain criminal responsibility for the disaster as well as the operation of the illegal factory. The results of both are either pending or have yet to be released to the general public.|$|E
5|$|Except for {{the corner}} houses, {{the houses were}} built in pairs, each sharing a porch with its neighbour. For many of the smaller fourth- and fifth-class houses, <b>the</b> <b>doors</b> <b>were</b> aligned {{at right angles to}} the façade of the house, so as not to open {{directly}} adjacently to their neighbours. All houses were designed with at least one parlour and with the kitchen, scullery, and toilet in separate rooms {{at the rear of the}} house; the first-class houses also had toilets upstairs. In line with the design principles of the time, the downstairs toilets were accessible only from the back gardens, and the houses were not fitted with separate bathrooms; baths were taken in a moveable bath located in the kitchen.|$|E
5|$|La Masia is {{also the}} name of FC Barcelona's {{football}} training facilities, originally located near the Camp Nou in the Les Corts district of Barcelona. The original building itself was an ancient country residence (In Catalan: masia) built in 1702, and once Camp Nou was inaugurated in 1957, the building was remodelled and extended for use as the club's social headquarters. With the gradual expansion of the club, the building became too small for headquarters, and on 20 October 1979, La Masia was converted into a dormitory for young players from outside Barcelona. On 30 June 2011, the Masia building ceased housing the young sportsmen who are trained {{to become a part}} of the club’s professional teams. In a simple ceremony, <b>the</b> <b>doors</b> <b>were</b> closed and the Ciutat Esportiva Joan Gamper took over the function of the residential center for the youngsters.|$|E

5000|$|Yichud <b>is</b> {{alleviated}} when <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>is</b> open. This {{principle is}} known as pesach pasuach lireshus harabim (lit. an open doorway to the public domain). The Shulchan Aruch rules: [...] "If <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>is</b> open to <b>the</b> public domain, there is no concern of yichud." [...] This ruling has been interpreted and enlarged in various ways: 1. <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>is</b> actually open 2. when <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>is</b> closed but unlocked 3. then <b>door</b> <b>is</b> locked, but somebody with a key is liable to come in at any time 4. <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>is</b> locked, {{but there is a}} reasonable possibility that people may knock on <b>the</b> <b>door</b> and expect to be answered (according to Moshe Feinstein). A woman being secluded with another man is also justified when people outside can see through the window what is going on inside the house. In case of a close, long-standing friendship between the man and the woman, however, a more stringent behavior is expected. The leniency usually does not apply late at night, as {{there is little or no}} chance that people would come in unexpectedly then.|$|R
5|$|Meetings usually {{began at}} dawn, {{although}} occasionally certain events (such as festivals) might delay {{the beginning of}} a meeting. A magistrate who wished to summon the Senate had to issue a compulsory order (a cogere), and senators could be punished if they failed to appear without reasonable cause. In 44 BC for example, consul Mark Antony threatened to demolish the house of the former consul Cicero for this very reason. The Senate meetings were technically public because <b>the</b> <b>doors</b> <b>were</b> usually left open, which allowed people to look in, but only senators could speak. The Senate was directed by a presiding magistrate, who was usually either a consul (the highest-ranking magistrate) or, if the consul was unavailable, a Praetor (the second-highest ranking magistrate). By the late Republic, another type of magistrate, a plebeian tribune, would sometimes preside.|$|E
5|$|SS {{officers}} {{told the}} victims {{they were to}} take a shower and undergo delousing. The victims undressed in an outer chamber and walked into the gas chamber, which was disguised as a shower facility. Some were even issued soap and a towel. The Zyklon B was delivered by ambulance to the crematoria by a special SS bureau known as the Hygienic Institute. The actual delivery of the gas to the victims was always handled by the SS, on the order of the supervising SS doctor. After <b>the</b> <b>doors</b> <b>were</b> shut, SS men dumped in the Zyklon B pellets through vents in the roof or holes {{in the side of the}} chamber. The victims were dead within 20 minutes. Despite the thick concrete walls, screaming and moaning from within could be heard outside. In one failed attempt to muffle the noise, two motorcycle engines were revved up to full throttle nearby, but the sound of yelling could still be heard over the engines.|$|E
5|$|The {{cardinals}} hear two sermons {{before the}} election: one before actually entering the conclave, and one {{once they are}} settled in the Sistine Chapel. In both cases, the sermons are meant {{to lay out the}} current state of the Church, and to suggest the qualities necessary for a pope to possess in that specific time. The first preacher in the 2005 conclave was Fr. Raniero Cantalamessa, the preacher of the papal household and a member of the Capuchin Franciscan order, who spoke at one of the meetings of the cardinals held before the actual day when the conclave began. Cardinal Tomáš Špidlík, a former professor at the Pontifical Oriental Institute and a non-voting member (due to age) of the College of Cardinals, spoke just before <b>the</b> <b>doors</b> <b>were</b> finally closed for the conclave.|$|E
5000|$|The {{value of}} entry and exit actions {{is that they}} provide means for {{guaranteed}} initialization and cleanup, very much like class constructors and destructors in Object-oriented programming. For example, consider the [...] "door_open" [...] state from Figure 5, which corresponds to the toaster oven behavior while <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>is</b> open. This state has a very important safety-critical requirement: Always disable the heater when <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>is</b> open. Additionally, while <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>is</b> open, <b>the</b> internal lamp illuminating the oven should light up.|$|R

5|$|To {{replace the}} aging Class C trains, from 1985 to 1987, ten T4s were {{converted}} to T1300. They were equipped with a pantograph, received a new front and <b>the</b> <b>doors</b> <b>were</b> moved. Six additional T4s were converted in 1989, and given the designation T8. These only had the pantographs equipped and kept the same front and door arrangement. With {{the introduction of the}} T1300, the western lines could remove the conductor and have single-manned trains with the motorman selling tickets. The T1300-units have had better regularity than the older models they replaced. However, because they are designed for a closed system with automatic train protection, the braking systems are not sufficiently dimensioned for when the drivers use line of sight to regulate the speed and distances between trains. The 1300 units were numbered 1301–1349. After the conversions, Oslo Sporveier operated 49 T1300-cars and 146 T1000-cars. The trains were originally painted red with a beige cheatline.|$|E

Furthermore, <b>the</b> <b>doors</b> <b>were</b> unusually wide and featured steps that deployed automatically when <b>the</b> <b>doors</b> <b>were</b> opened to make entry as convenient as possible, and the glass doors dividing the two major areas of the intermediate cars were opened by proximity sensors. The ICE1 was the first German train in which smokers and non-smokers were separated not into {{different parts of the}} same car, but to different cars altogether.|$|E

5000|$|A known {{issue with}} the camera <b>was</b> <b>the</b> battery {{compartment}} <b>door,</b> which <b>was</b> made from plastic. A somewhat cumbersome dual-action latching mechanism for <b>the</b> battery <b>door</b> often complicated this issue and, if operated incorrectly, could result in damage. Any damage to <b>the</b> battery <b>door</b> <b>was</b> troublesome, as <b>the</b> camera would not work at all if <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>is</b> unlatched. Fortunately, <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>was</b> and is an inexpensive part and could be replaced simply.

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>doors</b> must <b>be</b> {{at least}} {{as strong as the}} walls. The usual design is a trap-door, to {{minimize}} the size and expense. To reduce <b>the</b> weight, <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>is</b> normally constructed of steel, with a fitted steel lintel and frame. Very thick wood also serves, and is more resistant to heat because it chars rather than melts. If <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>is</b> on <b>the</b> surface and will be exposed to the blast wave, the edge of <b>the</b> <b>door</b> <b>is</b> normally counter-sunk in the frame so that the blast wave or a reflection cannot lift the edge. A bunker should have two doors. Door shafts may double as ventilation shafts to reduce digging.|$|R
