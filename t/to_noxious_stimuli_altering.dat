40|$|Antidepressants {{that block}} the reuptake of {{noradrenaline}} and/or serotonin {{are among the}} first-line treatments for neuropathic pain, although the mechanisms underlying this analgesia remain unclear. The noradrenergic locus coeruleus is {{an essential element of}} both the ascending and descending pain modulator systems regulated by these antidepressants. Hence, we investigated the effect of analgesic antidepressants on locus coeruleus activity in Sprague-Dawley rats subjected to chronic constriction injury (CCI), a model of neuropathic pain. In vivo extracellular recordings of locus coeruleus revealed that CCI did not modify the basal tonic activity of this nucleus, although its sensory-evoked response <b>to</b> <b>noxious</b> <b>stimuli</b> was significantly <b>altered.</b> Under normal conditions, noxious stimulation evokes an early response, corresponding to the activation of myelinated A fibers, which is followed by an inhibitory period and a subsequent late capsaicin-sensitive response, consistent with the activation of unmyelinated C fibers. CCI provokes an enhanced excitatory early response in the animals and the loss of the late response. Antidepressant administration over 7 days (desipramine, 10 mg/kg/day or duloxetine, 5 mg/kg/day, delivered by osmotic minipumps) decreased the excitatory firing rate of the early response in the CCI group. Moreover, in all animals, these antidepressants reduced the inhibitory period and augmented the late response. We propose that N-methyl-d-aspartate and alpha- 2 -adrenoceptors are involved in the analgesic effect of antidepressants. Antidepressant-mediated changes were correlated with behavioral effects indicative of analgesia in healthy and neuropathic rats. Â© 2012 International Association for the Study of Pain.

40|$|Tonic {{inhibition}} of sensory spinal neurones {{is well known}} to descend from the rostroventral medulla. It is not clear if this inhibition is dynamically activated by peripheral <b>noxious</b> <b>stimuli.</b> Transection of the ipsilateral dorsolateral funiculus (DLF) removed a descending {{inhibition of}} multireceptive spinal neurones and disproportionally prolonged the after-discharge component of their response <b>to</b> a <b>noxious</b> cutaneous <b>stimulus.</b> Microinjection of GABA or tetracaine into the medullary nucleus gigantocellularis pars alpha (GiA) similarly prolonged the after-discharge in response <b>to</b> <b>noxious</b> <b>stimuli.</b> Recordings of GiA cells, initially using minimal surgery, revealed that many had low levels of spontaneous activity and responded vigorously <b>to</b> <b>noxious</b> <b>stimuli</b> applied <b>to</b> {{any part of the}} body surface. One hour after the surgery necessary to expose the spinal cord, GiA cells had a high firing rate but responded weakly <b>to</b> <b>noxious</b> <b>stimuli.</b> The response of GiA cells <b>to</b> <b>noxious</b> <b>stimuli</b> was abolished by transection of only the DLF contralateral to the stimulus.

50|$|The {{sensitivity}} of TRPV1 <b>to</b> <b>noxious</b> <b>stimuli,</b> {{such as high}} temperatures, is not static. Upon tissue damage and the consequent inflammation, a number of inflammatory mediators, such as various prostaglandins and bradykinin, are released. These agents increase the {{sensitivity of}} nociceptors <b>to</b> <b>noxious</b> <b>stimuli.</b> This manifests as an increased sensitivity to painful stimuli (hyperalgesia) or pain sensation in response to non-painful stimuli (allodynia). Most sensitizing pro-inflammatory agents activate the phospholipase C pathway. Phosphorylation of TRPV1 by protein kinase C {{have been shown to}} play a role in sensitization of TRPV1. The cleavage of PIP2 by PLC-beta can result in disinhibition of TRPV1 and, as a consequence, contribute to the sensitivity of TRPV1 <b>to</b> <b>noxious</b> <b>stimuli.</b>|$|R

40|$|Objective Recently, {{there has}} been growing {{interest}} in the interaction between depressive disorders and pain. The {{purpose of this study}} was to examine whether depression would lead to a decreased sensitivity <b>to</b> <b>noxious</b> <b>stimuli</b> in rats with spontaneous pain. Methods The olfactory bulbectomized rats were used as a model of depression. The depression-like behaviors were assessed by open field test and changes in body weight. Formalin solution was injected into the rat hindpaw to produce ongoing pain. <b>Noxious</b> thermal <b>stimuli</b> were applied onto the hindpaw contralateral to formalin injection, and the withdrawal thresholds were measured. Results In non-depressive rats, the formalin-treated paw developed hypoalgesia <b>to</b> <b>noxious</b> <b>stimuli</b> while the contralateral paw was not affected. The depressive rats, however, showed a significantly lower sensitivity <b>to</b> <b>noxious</b> thermal <b>stimulus,</b> represented as higher withdrawal thresholds of the contralateral paw, when compared to the non-depressive rats. Conclusion These results demonstrate that depression can alleviate the stimulus-evoked pain even in the context of formalin inflammatory pain, consistent with the previous clinical observations that patients suffering from both depression and persistent pain have decreased sensitivities <b>to</b> <b>noxious</b> experimental <b>stimuli...</b>|$|R

40|$|Neurons in ventromedial medulla, {{including}} the nucleus raphe magnus, project to trigeminal nucleus caudalis and, via the dorsolateral funiculus, to spinal dorsal horn. The terminals of this descending system are in loci containing cells responsive <b>to</b> <b>noxious</b> <b>stimuli.</b> Electrical stimulation of nucleus raphe magnus selectively inhibits spinal dorsal horn neurons that respond <b>to</b> <b>noxious</b> <b>stimuli.</b> These neurons are {{located near the}} anatomically demonstrated terminals of this descending system. Dorsolateral funiculus lesions block this descending inhibition of spinal neurons {{as well as the}} analgesic action of morphine. This evidence supports the hypothesis that this neuron population mediates the analgesia produced by opiates and electrical stimulation of certain diencephalic and brainstem sites...|$|R
40|$|Variability in opioid {{analgesia}} {{has been}} attributed to many factors. For example, genetic variability of the Î¼-opioid receptor (MOR) -encoding gene introduces variability in MOR function and endogenous opioid neurotransmission. Emerging evidence suggests that personality trait related to the experience of reward is linked to endogenous opioid neurotransmission. We hypothesized that opioid-induced behavioral analgesia would be predicted by the trait reward responsiveness (RWR) and the response of the brain reward circuitry <b>to</b> <b>noxious</b> <b>stimuli</b> at baseline before opioid administration. In healthy volunteers using functional magnetic resonance imaging and the Î¼-opioid agonist remifentanil, we found that the magnitude of behavioral opioid analgesia is positively correlated with the trait RWR and predicted by the neuronal response <b>to</b> painful <b>noxious</b> <b>stimuli</b> before infusion in key structures of the reward circuitry, such as the orbitofrontal cortex, nucleus accumbens, and the ventral tegmental area. These findings highlight the role of the brain reward circuitry in the expression of behavioral opioid analgesia. We also show a positive correlation between behavioral opioid analgesia and opioid-induced suppression of neuronal responses <b>to</b> <b>noxious</b> <b>stimuli</b> in key structures of the descending pain modulatory system (amygdala, periaqueductal gray, and rostral-ventromedial medulla), as well as the hippocampus. Further, these activity changes were predicted by the preinfusion period neuronal response <b>to</b> <b>noxious</b> <b>stimuli</b> within the ventral tegmentum. These results support the notion of future imaging-based subject-stratification paradigms that can guide therapeutic decisions...|$|R
50|$|Data {{obtained}} from using P2 receptor-selective antagonists has produced evidence supporting ATP's ability to initiate and maintain chronic pain states after exposure <b>to</b> <b>noxious</b> <b>stimuli.</b> It {{is believed that}} ATP functions as a pronociceptive neurotransmitter, acting at specific P2X and P2Y receptors in a systemized manner, which ultimately (as a response <b>to</b> <b>noxious</b> <b>stimuli)</b> serve <b>to</b> initiate and sustain heightened states of neuronal excitability. This recent knowledge of purinergic receptors' effects on chronic pain provide promise in discovering a drug that specifically targets individual P2 receptor subtypes. While some P2 receptor-selective compounds have proven useful in preclinical trials, more research is required to understand the potential viability of P2 receptor antagonists for pain.|$|R

40|$|Although central serotonergic {{systems are}} known to {{influence}} responses <b>to</b> <b>noxious</b> <b>stimuli,</b> mechanisms underlying serotonergic modulation of pain responses are unclear. We proposed that serotonin 2 C receptors (5 -HT 2 CRs), which are expressed within brain regions implicated in sensory and affective responses to pain, contribute to the serotonergic modulation of pain responses. In mice constitutively lacking 5 -HT 2 CRs (2 CKO mice) we found normal baseline sensory responses <b>to</b> <b>noxious</b> thermal, mechanical and chemical stimuli. In contrast, 2 CKO mice exhibited a selective enhancement of affect-related ultrasonic afterdischarge vocalizations in response to footshock. Enhanced affect-related responses <b>to</b> <b>noxious</b> <b>stimuli</b> were also exhibited by 2 CKO mice in a fear-sensitized startle assay. The {{extent to which a}} brief series of unconditioned footshocks produced enhancement of acoustic startle responses was markedly increased in 2 CKO mice. As mesolimbic dopamine pathways influence affective responses <b>to</b> <b>noxious</b> <b>stimuli,</b> and these pathways are disinhibited in 2 CKO mice, we examined the sensitivity of footshock-induced enhancement of startle to dopamine receptor blockade. Systemic administration of the dopamine D 2 /D 3 receptor antagonist raclopride selectively reduced footshock-induced enhancement of startle without influencing baseline acoustic startle responses. We propose that 5 -HT 2 CRs regulate affective behavioral responses to unconditioned aversive stimuli through mechanisms involving the disinhibition of ascending dopaminergic pathways...|$|R
