25|$|The girls try {{to adjust}} to the new world in which Alison is very much alive, while still <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>up</b> with Ali's new lie about her {{whereabouts}} over the last two years. They try to live their lives free from 'A' after Aria manages to save them from Shana, the rooftop shooter, in New York. The girls think Shana was 'A', and with her gone, they no longer worry about 'A'. However, 'A' returns, blowing up the Cavanaugh house and leaving the liars more afraid than ever. With Alison back, Aria, Emily, Hanna and Spencer notice how their friendship has changed since Ali's disappearance. The other residents in Rosewood also deal with Alison coming home, and it leads to Mona making an army against her, consisting of residents whom Ali bullied back in the day. The liars try to figure out who killed Mrs. DiLaurentis, {{and if there is a}} connection between her and the girl who was buried in Alison's grave, Bethany Young.|$|E

[...] The prairie clubs, including the Tigers, were struggling under financial hardships while a mild winter of 1925–26 reduced {{the quality of the}} natural ice at Victoria arena which, coupled with the team's poor performance, reduced attendance. [...] Manager Lance Turner confirmed on May 4, 1926 that the Tigers were sold to the National Hockey League, along with the franchises in Edmonton, Regina, Victoria, Vancouver and Portland, and that the league had ceased operations. The six franchises were sold for $300,000.|$|E
500|$|In June 2017, Cawthon hinted {{towards the}} {{development}} of a sixth main game in the series. On July 2, 2017, he announced his decision to cancel this game, stating that he had been [...] "neglecting other things in [...] life for the sake of <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>up</b> with [...] mounting expectations". Cawthon noted that he was not planning on abandoning the series, and may even return with a game of a different style, such as one similar to FNaF World. He also announced his plans to develop a virtual reality Five Nights at Freddy's game in the future.|$|E
500|$|The final debate {{took place}} October 28 at the San Gabriel Civic Auditorium, to an {{overflow}} crowd {{in excess of}} a thousand. Voorhis went on the attack, charging Nixon with misrepresenting the [...] "46votes" [...] to avoid real debate and any discussion of where Nixon himself stood on issues. The Republican candidate stated that he was fighting for [...] "the person on a pension <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>up</b> with {{the rising cost of}} living... the white-collar worker who has not had a raise... Americans have had enough, and they {{have come to the conclusion}} that they are going to do something." [...] Nixon sat down to thunderous applause, and the San Gabriel Sun described Voorhis: [...] "He pauses, breathes heavily, scans the audience with tired eyes, adjusts his glasses nervously with both hands, and then strikes the podium with an open hand." ...|$|E

500|$|Filming {{commenced}} {{after only}} half a day's rehearsal and without a finished script; the actors received {{the rest of their}} lines in daily dispatches. According to Warren, [...] "dear old Max Cuff was <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>up</b> with us. He was writing like mad." [...] Certain scenes were partly or wholly improvised: one example is a sex scene between the characters of Jessica and Jo, which was added mainly to boost the film's overseas distribution prospects. Many of the crew had recently come off the production of The Pink Panther Strikes Again, on which Marcel had served as assistant director. They completed an average of 35 camera set-ups per day, employing hand-held shots whenever they fell behind schedule and filming scenes in no more than three takes to lower costs. Stokes needed injections to ease the discomfort caused by the contact lenses that he was required to wear as part of his alien make-up. The bird Wally was a cockatoo that often refused to perform when needed and squawked loudly off-camera, frequently causing problems with the sound recording. He eventually escaped from his cage and was never seen again.|$|E
500|$|The album {{garnered}} mainly positive {{reviews from}} critics. Sarah Bardeen of Rhapsody said the album established Queen as [...] "the voice for women", complimenting her [...] "self-assured delivery". She {{claimed that the}} tracks in which featured guest artists [...] "get {{the sense that the}} guys she's trading verses with are <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>up</b> with her and not the other way around," [...] noting that the platinum edition [...] "launched the monster hit [...] "Quiero Bailar". Rachel Devitt, also writing for Rhapsody, categorized the album as [...] "Urban Latin" [...] music. Michael Endelman of Entertainment Weekly called the album their number one pick for crossover success in the United States while complimenting the [...] "catchy hooks and sticky grooves" [...] found on the album. Kalefa Sanneh of The New York Times said [...] " [...] celebrates her hybrid genre by refusing to stay put", while claiming Queen to sometimes depart from [...] "reggaeton's sharp, steady shuffle to explore other rhythms". She later said that the album would make Queen a [...] "likely candidate for crossover success, if only she didn't sing in Spanish". An editor for the Chicago Tribune selected the album as one of three to [...] "add to your reggaetón collection" [...] other than Daddy Yankee's Barrio Fino (2004). The writer noted the included hits ("Quiero Bailar" [...] and [...] "Papi Te Quiero"), along with [...] " [...] handful of remixes–and a whole lot of attitude". The album was highly anticipated and acclaimed and widely regarded as a factor in reggaeton's mainstream exposure in 2004 along with her next studio album Real (2004), Daddy Yankee's Barrio Fino and Tego Calderon's El Enemy de los Guasíbiri (2004), after being certified Platinum in the Latin field signifying sales of over 100,000 by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). Jonathan Widran of Allmusic described [...] "Quiero Bailar" [...] as a song that [...] "gets the party and people moving" [...] and as well as being one of Queen's hits. Kid Curry, of Rhythmic Top 40 WPOW (Power 96) cites Ivy Queen's release of [...] "Yo Quiero Bailar" [...] as [...] "the last reggaetón super-hit". [...] "Papi Te Quiero" [...] was selected as one of the hits from [...] "The Golden Era of Reggaetón" [...] which lasted from 2003 until 2007 by Jesus Trivino of Latina magazine. The album was nominated for [...] "Reggaeton Album of the Year" [...] at the 2005 Billboard Latin Music Awards where she was also nominated for [...] "Tropical Airplay Track of the Year, Female" [...] and [...] "Tropical Airplay Track of the Year, New Artist".|$|E

2500|$|About {{adjusting}} to the NFL, Ringer said [...] "It's definitely {{a lot more complicated}} than in college, definitely. But mainly it's just the play calling, it's a lot longer than what it was in college, but all-in-all it's just learning a whole new terminology, some things are similar, but it's the words that they use are different. So it's all about adjustment. A lot of intelligence out there, they don't make mistakes. They are pretty mature on what they are doing. I am trying to build up to that, because {{a lot of them are}} veterans and have been there for a while. They understand what is going on, and I am just <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>up</b> and not make them look bad." ...|$|E
2500|$|Consequently, {{the story}} changed its focus {{from the old}} Mount Thomas police station to the new one that was used until the show's {{cancellation}} in 2006. The Seven Network feared that in the modern post-9/11 world, a show about country police was no longer what audiences wanted. Storylines of the proceeding five episodes focused on {{the bombing of the}} station and the 4 new main characters: Rachel Gordon as Amy Fox, Geoff Morrell as Mark Jacobs, Samantha Tolj as Kelly O'Rourke and Danny Raco as Joss Peroni. Popular former cast member William McInnes also returned to the show, temporarily reprising his role as Nick Schultz. Producers hoped the new tone of the series, the new younger actors, and McInnes's role reprisal would lure back viewers who had stopped watching the programme. [...] This new style of programme that Blue Heelers was embracing was a sign of the show <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>up</b> with other larger television shows, particularly the CSI franchise.|$|E

2500|$|Entertainment Weekly later named Bionic {{the fifth}} worst album of 2010 in a year-end list. The album was named by Billboard the [...] "best {{mainstream}} pop {{album of the}} year thus far" [...] upon its release. Sam Lansky wrote for MTV Buzzworthy that the album was [...] "precociously brilliant" [...] and [...] "how thrilling most those songs are", claiming that [...] "the songs on the deluxe edition are forward-thinking and even timeless, galactic pop with subversive, ambient production." [...] Lansky noted that [...] "In its own way, Bionic neatly illustrates the dangers artists face when aggressively <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>up</b> with 'current' music. As a result, futuristic pop tracks can already sound dated by the time they're released. And even when they don't, those chart-chasing songs don't age particularly gracefully. But two years after the fact, Bionic's moments of greatness remain about as good as it gets." [...] In similar vein, Mike Wass of Idolator wrote that [...] "the album holds up better than expected, and is actually an intriguing — if somewhat disjointed and often meandering — collection of songs. Christina's assertion that she was ahead of the curve is inarguably correct." [...] Wass acknowledged that Aguilera [...] "was the first mainstream artist to call on Australian singer-songwriter Sia, who has since been courted by everyone from Adam Lambert to Rihanna." ...|$|E
2500|$|Similarly, God {{could not}} be an {{infinite}} spirit that would have [...] "infused itself into the whole creation" [...] because any meaningful distinction between Creator and creature would then be lost. Tomkinson tries to explain why his notion of a 'spiritual body' does not conjure up a phantom. [...] "The form of the uncreated Majesty, before he became flesh did not consist of any elementary matter, {{but it was a}} bright shiny glory of uncompounded purities of so unutterable a nature in virtue, as that it was swifter than thought, clearer than crystal, sweeter than roses, more purer than the purest gold, yea, and more infinitely glorious than the sun." [...] The 'swifter than thought' quote is to contradict Quakers who had fun ridiculing an embodied God lumbering round the universe <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>up</b> with events. So, comparing man and God, it was [...] "not the visibility of their persons that differed, but the glory of them only." [...] Tomkinson advances two reasons why this must be so. Firstly, he argued that God created man in his own image and that righteousness and holiness cannot act unless they are embodied in an agent. Secondly and ingeniously, that many of the virtues of God relate to states of being and that would be meaningless without a body to be in.|$|E
2500|$|It may be possible, then, {{that our}} intuitions {{about the role}} of our {{conscious}} [...] "intentions" [...] have led us astray; it may be the case that we have confused correlation with causation by believing that conscious awareness necessarily causes the body's movement. This possibility is bolstered by findings in neurostimulation, brain damage, but also research into introspection illusions. Such illusions show that humans do not have full access to various internal processes. The discovery that humans possess a determined will would have implications for moral responsibility. Neuroscientist and author Sam Harris believes that we are mistaken in believing the intuitive idea that intention initiates actions. In fact, Harris is even critical of the idea that free will is [...] "intuitive": he says careful introspection can cast doubt on free will. Harris argues [...] "Thoughts simply arise in the brain. What else could they do? The truth about us is even stranger than we may suppose: The illusion of free will is itself an illusion". Philosopher Walter Jackson Freeman III nevertheless talks about the power of even unconscious systems and actions to change the world according to our intentions. He writes [...] "our intentional actions continually flow into the world, changing the world and the relations of our bodies to it. This dynamic system is the self in each of us, it is the agency in charge, not our awareness, which is constantly <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>up</b> with what we do." [...] To Freeman, the power of intention and action can be independent of awareness.|$|E

2500|$|Tha Carter III {{received}} universal acclaim {{from music}} critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album received an average score of 84, based on 26 reviews. AllMusic editor David Jeffries praised Wayne's [...] "entertaining wordplay {{and plenty of}} well-executed, left-field ideas". The Guardians Alex Macpherson lauded Wayne's rapping, stating [...] "Just <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>up</b> with Wayne's mind as he proves the case is a thrill. He breaks language down into building blocks for new metaphors, exploiting every possible semantic and phonetic loophole for humour and yanking pop culture references into startling new contexts". Jonah Weiner of Blender called it [...] "a weird, gripping triumph". Rolling Stone writer Jody Rosen commended its themes and stated [...] "This isn't a mixtape, it's a suite of songs, paced and sequenced for maxaqimum [...] impact." [...] Jon Pareles of The New York Times commented that Wayne [...] "has clearly worked to make Tha Carter III a statement of its own: one that moves beyond standard hip-hop boasting (though there's plenty of that) to thoughts that can be introspective or gleefully unhinged". Pitchforks Ryan Dombal stated, [...] "he distills the myriad metaphors, convulsing flows, and vein-splitting emotions into a commercially gratifying package". In his consumer guide for MSN Music, critic Robert Christgau noted that [...] "every track attends to detail" [...] and quipped, [...] "From the start {{you know this is}} no mixtape because it's clearer and more forceful." [...] Uncut stated that [...] "the prince of hip-hop gets a blessing from the king." [...] Mosi Reeves of Paste gave it a favorable review and noted that the album [...] "hearkens to when rap meant rapp: Isaac Hayes talking for days about some girl he broke with, or Bobby Womack signifying while strumming a blues guitar." [...] Nathan Rabin of The A.V. Club called Lil Wayne [...] "the man of the moment, but the disc's best moments strive for timelessness and attain it." ...|$|E
