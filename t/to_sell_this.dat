25|$|In June 1986, William H. Dilday Jr. {{reached an}} {{agreement}} <b>to</b> <b>sell</b> <b>this</b> station to Marion Radio, Inc. The deal {{was approved by the}} FCC on September 30, 19986, and the transaction was consummated on July 20, 1987.|$|E
25|$|In October 1981, Wade B. Sullivan agreed <b>to</b> <b>sell</b> <b>this</b> {{station to}} Raymond F. Akin, J.A. Baxter, Jr., and Gordon L. Bostic doing {{business}} as RJG Communications. The deal {{was approved by}} the FCC on December 3, 1981.|$|E

50|$|Prior <b>to</b> <b>selling</b> <b>this</b> {{side of the}} {{business}} to Baidu, the company created a mobile phone app store stocked with self-created games and applications. NetDragon had differentiated itself by eschewing selling apps through the distribution channels of others instead creating its own; in essence making consumers download an app to download an app but allowing them exposure to other Netdragon offerings in the process.|$|R

25|$|In July 1997, GMC Broadcasting, Inc., agreed <b>to</b> <b>sell</b> <b>this</b> {{station to}} Birmingham Christian Radio, Inc. The deal was {{approved}} by the FCC on October 16, 1997, and the transaction was consummated on December 31, 1997. The new owners flipped the format to black gospel.|$|E
25|$|To Siemens this {{delay is}} a major embarrassment, since the company hopes <b>to</b> <b>sell</b> <b>this</b> ATC system to other subway {{operators}} {{around the world who}} wish to gradually convert their existing subway lines to ATC operation, allowing for mixed operations on line segments used by ATC and non-ATC operated trains during interim periods.|$|E
25|$|In June 1993, Independence Broadcasting Wisconsin Corp. {{contracted}} <b>to</b> <b>sell</b> <b>this</b> {{station to}} Lakeside Cablevision Limited Partnership (doing business as Star Cablevision, a forerunner business to Charter Communications's Wisconsin operations). The deal {{was approved by}} the FCC on August 24, 1993, and the transaction was consummated on September 30, 1993.|$|E
50|$|In February 2012, Renard reached another deal <b>to</b> <b>sell</b> WBQM-LD, <b>this</b> time <b>to</b> Buenavision TV Network NY, LLC (WMBQ {{was sold}} {{separately}} several months earlier).|$|R
50|$|In December 2003, Vilkie Communications LMA'ed then dark WGRP-AM until {{changes in}} {{management}} at Beacon decided not <b>to</b> <b>sell.</b> At <b>this</b> time, Harold Glunt took over operations of Beacon Broadcasting.|$|R

25|$|Significant oil {{producing}} {{countries will}} have a national purchasing advantage over similar countries with no oil <b>to</b> <b>sell.</b> <b>This</b> can result in larger militaries for oil producers or inflation {{of the price of}} whatever commodities they purchase. Saudi Arabia purchased US$40 billion worth of arms from the US between 1990 and 2000.|$|E
25|$|In May 2000, Woods Communications Group, Inc. (Charles Woods, chairman) agreed <b>to</b> <b>sell</b> <b>this</b> {{station to}} Jimmy Jarrell. The deal was {{approved}} by the FCC on July 17, 2000, and the transaction was consummated on July 25, 2000. Jarrell had the station assigned the WJRL-FM call letters by the FCC on February 27, 2001.|$|E
25|$|Canassatego's final {{appearance}} at a treaty conference was in August 1749, {{one year after}} the end of King George's War. In Philadelphia, he complained that colonists were settling on Native land along the Susquehanna River. He agreed <b>to</b> <b>sell</b> <b>this</b> land to Pennsylvania, but once again, the written document ceded much more land than what had been agreed upon in negotiations.|$|E

50|$|The {{government}} {{generally has}} avoided expropriating farms. Farms to be reallocated to previously disadvantaged people are mainly bought from farm owners that wish <b>to</b> <b>sell</b> their farms. <b>This</b> {{is called the}} Willing buyer, willing seller principle. Any farm {{that is to be}} sold on the free market must first be offered to government. However, in 2005, government began expropriating commercial farms. Although only five farms had been expropriated in 2008, and a further 30 farm owners had received letters asking them <b>to</b> <b>sell</b> <b>to</b> government, <b>this</b> move has instilled fears in the white farming community and discouraged further investment.|$|R

25|$|In February 1983, RJG Communications {{announced}} its intention <b>to</b> <b>sell</b> <b>this</b> station to MSB Communications, Inc. The deal {{was approved by}} the FCC on April 8, 1983. In April 1985, Stephen G. McGowan made a deal to acquire full control of station licensee MSB Communications, Inc., from partners William James Samford, Jr., and William B. Blount. The deal {{was approved by the}} FCC on June 17, 1985, and the transfer of control was consummated on January 22, 1986.|$|E
25|$|The company {{spun off}} its Travelers Property and Casualty {{insurance}} underwriting business in 2002. The spin off {{was prompted by}} the insurance unit's drag on Citigroup stock price because Traveler's earnings were more seasonal and vulnerable to large disasters, particularly the September 11, 2001 attacks on the World Trade Center in downtown New York City. It was also difficult <b>to</b> <b>sell</b> <b>this</b> kind of insurance directly to customers since most industrial customers are accustomed to purchasing insurance through a broker.|$|E
25|$|Total BC {{petroleum}} {{and natural}} gas emissions in 2014 were 50 million tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent. The city of Vancouver in 2015 issued a report stating that for buildings, natural gas supplied 59% of all energy use, while electricity made up the remainder. BC has committed to reducing greenhouse gases to 33 per cent below 2007 levels by 2020, however the province is far short of that goal, only achieving a 6.5% reduction as of 2015. Although the Site C dam {{is expected to have}} a large initial electricity surplus, the province has proposed <b>to</b> <b>sell</b> <b>this</b> power rather than using it to cut natural gas consumption.|$|E
25|$|In limited circumstances, certain {{convertible}} bonds {{can be sold}} short, thus depressing the market value for a stock, and allowing the debt-holder to claim more stock with which <b>to</b> <b>sell</b> short. <b>This</b> is known as death spiral financing.|$|R
50|$|The Railway owns {{more than}} 1000 acre of land near I-77 in Richburg {{and hopes to}} attract other {{businesses}} to the area. But not at any cost. A Charlotte, North Carolina company was recently looking to build along the line. However, research into the company's past revealed a number of environmental citations. As {{a result of this}} finding, the Lancaster and Chester decided not <b>to</b> <b>sell</b> <b>to</b> <b>this</b> company.|$|R
50|$|In March 2010, another deal <b>to</b> <b>sell</b> WCVR-FM, <b>this</b> time <b>to</b> Vermont Public Radio, was reached; Vox then {{shut the}} station down on April 1 for {{financial}} reasons. VPR returned {{the station to}} the air July 30 as WVXR with the current format.|$|R
25|$|The {{line was}} opened on 26 August 1857. Gross {{expenditure}} was over £410,000. Brogdens were struggling financially and in 1858 approached the Furness for another loan {{but declined to}} accept the stringent conditions demanded. Finally in 1862 Brogdens sold the U to the existing Furness Railway having made little or no direct profit. This railway link however was critical to the later industrial development of Barrow-in-Furness and its locality and mining interests. It also caused silt to build up in former tidal areas, creating new agricultural land. Brogdens' decision <b>to</b> <b>sell</b> <b>this</b> valuable railway, with good growth prospects, suggests that they were short of cash.|$|E
25|$|The {{original}} domestic ticket allocation had fully {{sold out}} and the organising committee completed sales of tickets returned from the international allocation {{by the end of}} April. However, it was obvious at the opening matches that there were a significant number of empty seats. It was gradually revealed that the World Cup Ticketing Bureau (WCTB) still had unsold tickets in its possession. After FIFA agreed <b>to</b> <b>sell</b> <b>this</b> inventory, JAWOC undertook sales over telephone and WCTB handled the internet sales. For the second round Japan vs. Turkey match in Miyagi in particular, although it was reported by both parties that all tickets had been sold, some 700 seats remained empty.|$|E
25|$|Starring Jimmy Smits, this epic drama {{chronicles the}} {{external}} rivalries and internal power struggles {{of a large}} Cuban-American family running an immensely successful rum and sugarcane business in South Florida. When the family patriarch, Pancho Duque, is offered a lucrative but questionable deal by his bitter adversaries, the Samuels, he is faced with a difficult choice: Should he cash out of the sugar business and focus solely on rum, which would please his biological son, Frank Duque? Or should he protect the family legacy that he built {{from the ground up}} by refusing <b>to</b> <b>sell?</b> <b>This</b> would involve siding with his son-in-law, Alex Vega, who despises the Samuels and foresees multibillion-dollar profits from future ethanol contracts.|$|E
50|$|In 2012, {{the company}} {{launched}} an e-commerce website <b>to</b> <b>sell</b> its goods. <b>This</b> move {{was taken by}} the company to expand its products distribution worldwide.|$|R
25|$|Orlov {{was very}} {{protective}} of his bloodstock, and would sell only geldings (castrated stallions). Even when Tsar Alexander I asked Orlov <b>to</b> <b>sell</b> him several stallions, Orlov only agreed <b>to</b> <b>sell</b> geldings. <b>This</b> rule was maintained {{for twenty years}} after Orlov's death. Later, when the Khrenovsky stud farm belonged to the Russian Crown, Trotters were then openly sold to private stud-owners.|$|R
5000|$|In March 2010, another deal <b>to</b> <b>sell</b> WTSJ, <b>this</b> time <b>to</b> Koor Communications, was reached. Koor {{took over}} the station on March 12, and reverted the station to Real Country. [...] The WCVR call letters were {{reinstated}} on April 23, and the sale was finalized on June 25.|$|R
25|$|In 2006, he {{expressed}} {{his view of}} the Democratic Party::But what do I have to say about the Democratic Party? I’m ashamed, really, of how little leadership there has been. There has been just tremendous timidity {{on the part of the}} party, generally, although there have been a handful of exceptions. But, you know, we had one member of the United States Senate vote against the PATRIOT Act, the blank check that was given by Congress to this president, I think in total abrogation of the role of Congress under separation of powers and under the power to make war, to declare war. They gave that away to a president that didn’t have his facts straight and, I think, was manipulating the intelligence <b>to</b> <b>sell</b> <b>this</b> war.|$|E
25|$|Filibustering {{continued}} to be a major concern for presidents after Polk. Whigs presidents Zachary Taylor and Millard Fillmore tried to suppress the expeditions. When the Democrats recaptured the White House in 1852 with the election of Franklin Pierce, a filibustering effort by John A. Quitman to acquire Cuba received the tentative support of the president. Pierce backed off, however, and instead renewed the offer to buy the island, this time for $130million. When the public learned of the Ostend Manifesto in 1854, which argued that the United States could seize Cuba by force if Spain refused <b>to</b> <b>sell,</b> <b>this</b> effectively killed the effort to acquire the island. The public now linked expansion with slavery; if manifest destiny had once enjoyed widespread popular approval, this was no longer true.|$|E
500|$|Between 350 and 450 tonnes of {{bottom ash}} clinker would be {{produced}} by the station per week. NESCo intended <b>to</b> <b>sell</b> <b>this</b> on to local construction companies as a construction material and believed there was a ready market for this. Fly ash from the precipitators would also have built up, and NESCo claimed they would have spread this on land {{to the west of}} the station, and mixed it with soil to produce a [...] high spoil tip.|$|E
50|$|Ironically, Ivana {{had said}} in a {{previous}} task that she'd rather lose with dignity than resort to using her sexuality <b>to</b> <b>sell</b> something. <b>This</b> would completely contradict her performance in this task, when {{she was willing to}} drop her skirt to anyone who would give her $20 for her candy bar.|$|R
50|$|According to {{classical}} economic theory, markets reach equilibrium where supply equals demand; everyone who wants <b>to</b> <b>sell</b> {{at the market}} price can. Those {{who do not want}} <b>to</b> <b>sell</b> at <b>this</b> price do not; in the labour market this is classical unemployment. Monetary policy and fiscal policy can both be used to increase short-term growth in the economy, increasing the demand for labour and decreasing unemployment.|$|R
50|$|In some West African cultures, village women {{open their}} homes as 'pubs' {{one day a}} week, <b>to</b> <b>sell</b> millet beer. <b>This</b> {{gathering}} point provides social cohesion in the village.|$|R
