40|$|Nanopore DNA {{sequencing}} via <b>transverse</b> <b>current</b> {{has emerged}} as a promising candidate for third-generation sequencing technology. It produces long read lengths which could alleviate problems with assembly errors inherent in current technologies. However, the high error rates of nanopore sequencing have to be addressed. A very important source of the error is the intrinsic noise in the current arising from carrier dispersion along the chain of the molecule i. e. from the influence of neighboring bases. In this work we perform calculations of the <b>transverse</b> <b>current</b> within an effective multi-orbital tight-binding model derived from first-principles calculations of the DNA/RNA molecules, to study the effect of this structural noise on the error rates in DNA/RNA sequencing via <b>transverse</b> <b>current</b> in nanopores.

40|$|We {{examine the}} theory of collisionless <b>transverse</b> <b>current</b> waves in bulk super-fluid 3 He-B, {{including}} the coupling to the order parameter collective modes. A t low frequencies, co << A(T), the order parameter modes do {{not contribute to the}} restoring force for a <b>transverse</b> <b>current,</b> and the quasiparticle contribution drops rapidly as the gap in the spectrum develops. Thus, low-frequency trans-verse sound becomes overdamped at temperatures near To. However, at low temperatures (T< 0. 3 Tc) the off-resonant coupling to the J= 2 -, M=+I modes tabilizes a propagating <b>transverse</b> <b>current</b> mode, with a large phase velocity and low damping for frequencies above a critical frequency that is approximately that of the J = 2 - mode. We also discuss the similarities and differences of longitudinal and transverse sound in the superfluid phases. For example, in zero field, right- and left-circularly polarized waves are degenerate. A magnet&field, with H II ~ 1, lifts this degeneracy, giving rise to the analog of circular dichroism and birefringence of electromagnetic waves. Thus, trans-verse waves may be more easily detected in the B-phase than in normal 3 He. 1...|$|E

40|$|We {{investigate}} the spin Hall effect in ballistic chaotic quantum dots with spin-orbit coupling. We {{show that a}} longitudinal charge current can generate a pure <b>transverse</b> spin <b>current.</b> While this <b>transverse</b> spin <b>current</b> is generically nonzero for a fixed sample, we show that when the spin-orbit coupling time is large compared to the mean dwell time inside the dot, it fluctuates universally from sample to sample or upon variation of the chemical potential with a vanishing average. For a fixed sample configuration, the <b>transverse</b> spin <b>current</b> has a finite typical value ~e^ 2 V/h, proportional to the longitudinal bias V on the sample, and corresponding to about one excess open channel {{for one of the}} two spin species.

40|$|In laser-plasma {{interaction}} experiments {{there are}} a variety of effects which will scatter or deflect a probing electron beam. For example, a longitudinally probing electron beam is defocused by the ponderomotive force of a laser, but in a plasma the laser can set up fields which actually confine the electron beam.

40|$|Half-cycle {{picosecond}} pulses {{have been}} produced from thin photo-conductors, when applying an electric field across the surface and switching on conduction by a short laser pulse. Then the <b>transverse</b> <b>current</b> in the wafer plane emits half-cycle pulses in normal direction, and pulses of 500 fs duration and 1 e 6 V/m peak electric field have been observed. Here we show that single half-cycle pulses of 50 as duration and up to 1 e 13 V/m can be produced when irradiating a double foil target by intense few-cycle laser pulses. Focused onto an ultra-thin foil, all electrons are blown out, forming a uniform sheet of relativistic electrons.
