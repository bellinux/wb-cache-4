40|$|With {{the theory}} of special {{relativity}} [1], time has been linked with space into a four-dimensional space-time from which a basic question must be asked: can space be really transformed into time and vice versa? The response is affirmative if time has the same structural topological structure as space [2] at the subplanckian quantum level {{in such a way}} that a discrete structural <b>quantum</b> <b>time</b> constitutes the time part [3] of the space-time internal vacuum of every elementary particle. It has thus been shown that a <b>quantum</b> <b>time,</b> quantized algebraically according to a lattice of <b>time</b> <b>quanta,</b> really exists and is emergent in the sense that <b>time</b> <b>quanta</b> can be transformed into space quanta and vice versa. Furthermore, this <b>quantum</b> <b>time,</b> only relevant at the subplanckian scale, is proved to be in one-to-one correspondence with the absolute and relative clock times...|$|R
40|$|We {{present an}} optimal {{real-time}} scheduling algorithm for multiprocessors — one that satisfies all task deadlines, when the total utilization demand does {{not exceed the}} utilization capacity of the processors. The algorithm called LLREF, is designed based on a novel abstraction for reasoning about task execution behavior on multiprocessors: the Time and Local Execution Time Domain Plane (or T-L plane). LLREF {{is based on the}} fluid scheduling model and the fairness notion, and uses the T-L plane to describe fluid schedules without using <b>time</b> <b>quanta,</b> unlike the optimal Pfair algorithm (which uses <b>time</b> <b>quanta).</b> We show that scheduling for multiprocessors can be viewed as repeatedly occurring T-L planes, and feasibly scheduling on a single T-L plane results in the optimal schedule. We analytically establish the optimality of LLREF. Further, we establish that the algorithm has bounded overhead, and this bound is independent of <b>time</b> <b>quanta</b> (unlike Pfair). Our simulation results validate our analysis on the algorithm overhead...|$|R
2500|$|Although at the <b>time</b> <b>quantum</b> {{mechanics}} (and physical indeterminism) {{was only}} in the initial stages of acceptance, in his book [...] C. S. Lewis stated the logical possibility that if the physical world were proved indeterministic this would provide an entry point to describe an action of a non-physical entity on physical reality. Indeterministic physical models (particularly those involving quantum indeterminacy) introduce random occurrences at an atomic or subatomic level. These events might affect brain activity, and could seemingly allow incompatibilist free will if the apparent indeterminacy of some mental processes (for instance, subjective perceptions of control in conscious volition) map to the underlying indeterminacy of the physical construct. This relationship, however, requires a causative role over probabilities that is questionable, and it is far from established that brain activity responsible for human action can be affected by such events. Secondarily, these incompatibilist models are dependent upon the relationship between action and conscious volition, as studied in the neuroscience of free will. It is evident that observation may disturb the outcome of the observation itself, rendering limited our ability to identify causality. Niels Bohr, one of the main architects of quantum theory, suggested, however, that no connection could be made between indeterminism of nature and freedom of will.|$|E

50|$|The Linux {{scheduler}} was overhauled {{completely with}} the release of kernel 2.6. This new scheduler is called the O(1) scheduler. The algorithm used by the O(1) scheduler relies on active and expired arrays of processes to achieve constant scheduling time. Each process is given a fixed <b>time</b> <b>quantum,</b> after which it is preempted and moved to the expired array. Once all the tasks from the active array have exhausted their <b>time</b> <b>quantum</b> and have been moved to the expired array, an array switch takes place. Because the arrays are accessed only via pointer, switching them is as fast as swapping two pointers. This switch makes the active array the new empty expired array, while the expired array becomes the active array.|$|E
50|$|One common {{method of}} logically {{implementing}} the fair-share scheduling {{strategy is to}} recursively apply the round-robin scheduling strategy at each level of abstraction (processes, users, groups, etc.) The <b>time</b> <b>quantum</b> required by round-robin is arbitrary, as any equal division of time will produce the same results.|$|E
40|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} concepts in multi programming Operating Systems is scheduling. It helps in choosing the processes for execution. Round robin method is one {{of the most}} important algorithms in scheduling. It is the most popular algorithm due to its fairness and starvation free nature towards the processes, which is achieved by using proper <b>quantum</b> <b>time.</b> The main challenge in this algorithm is selection of <b>quantum</b> <b>time.</b> This parameter affects on average Waiting Time and average Turnaround Time in execution queue. As the <b>quantum</b> <b>time</b> is static, it causes less context switching in case of high <b>quantum</b> <b>time</b> and high context switching in case of less <b>quantum</b> <b>time.</b> Increasing context switch leads to high average waiting time, high average turnaround time which is an overhead and degrades the system performance. With respect to these points, the algorithms should calculate proper value for the <b>quantum</b> <b>time.</b> Two main classes of algorithms that are proposed to calculate the <b>quantum</b> <b>time</b> include static and dynamic methods. In static methods <b>quantum</b> <b>time</b> is fixed during the scheduling. Dynamic algorithms are one of these methods that change the value of <b>quantum</b> <b>time</b> in each cycle. For example in one method the value of <b>quantum</b> <b>time</b> in each cycle is equal to the median of burst times of processes in ready queue and for another method this value is equal to arithmetic mean of burst times of ready processes. In this paper we proposed a new method to obtaining <b>quantum</b> <b>time</b> in each cycle based on arithmetic-harmonic mean (HARM). Harmonic mean is calculated by dividing the number of observations by the reciprocal of each number in the series. With examples we show that in some cases it can provides better scheduling criteria and improves the average Turnaround Time and average Waiting Time...|$|R
