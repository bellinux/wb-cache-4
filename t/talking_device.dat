5000|$|Modern smart toys {{have their}} early roots in clockworks {{such as those}} of the eighteenth and nineteenth century cuckoo clocks, music boxes of the nineteenth, and Disney audio-animatronics of the twentieth. Perhaps the biggest early {{contribution}} is from novelty and toy makers from the 1800s who made automatons such as Vaucanson's mechanical duck, von Kempelen's The Turk, and the Silver Swan. All pre-twentieth-century precursors had in common that they were mechanical contrivances. By {{the second half of the}} 1900s toys featuring built-in media players became common. For example, Mattel introduced a variety of dolls in the 1960s and 1970s that used a pull string activated <b>talking</b> <b>device</b> to make the dolls [...] "talk" [...] such as the talking Crissy doll and Chatty Cathy.|$|E
50|$|The pattern {{playback}} is {{an early}} <b>talking</b> <b>device</b> that was built by Dr. Franklin S. Cooper and his colleagues, including John M. Borst and Caryl Haskins, at Haskins Laboratories in the late 1940s and completed in 1950. There were several different versions of this hardware device. Only one currently survives. The machine converts pictures of the acoustic patterns of speech {{in the form of}} a spectrogram back into sound. Using this device, Alvin Liberman, Frank Cooper, and Pierre Delattre (later joined by Katherine Safford Harris, Leigh Lisker, and others) were able to discover acoustic cues for the perception of phonetic segments (consonants and vowels). This research was fundamental to the development of modern techniques of speech synthesis, reading machines for the blind, the study of speech perception and speech recognition, and the development of the motor theory of speech perception.|$|E
50|$|In {{this story}} (within a story), {{a boy named}} Tim Ross lives with his mother Nell in a {{forgotten}} village that fears the annual collection of property taxes {{by a man named}} The Covenant Man. Tim recently lost his father, who was said to have been killed by a dragon while in the woods chopping trees. After the death of his father, Nell, no longer able to pay the taxes to keep their home, marries his father's best friend and business partner Bern Kells, who moves in with them. Kells is a mean man, prone to heavy drinking, who begins to abuse both Tim and Nell. One day The Covenant Man comes to collect the taxes, and he secretly tells Tim to meet him later in the woods. During this meeting, The Covenant Man reveals to Tim that it was actually Kells who killed his father, not a dragon, and with help of a scrying bowl shows Kells beating his mother, causing her to go blind. Later, The Covenant Man sends Tim a vision telling him that if Tim again visits The Covenant Man in the woods, he will give Tim magic that will allow his mother to see again. Tim, armed with a gun given to him by his school teacher, journeys into the dangerous woods, and is led into a swamp by the mischievous fairy, Armaneeta. Here, Tim almost becomes victim to a dragon and other mysterious swamp creatures, but he is saved by his gun as well as a group of friendly swamp people, who mistake him for a gunslinger. The swamp people guide him {{to the far side of}} the swamp, and equip him with a small mechanical <b>talking</b> <b>device</b> from the 'Old People' that helps guide him on his journey. Eventually, Tim arrives at a Dogan where he finds a caged 'tyger', which wears the key to the Dogan around its neck. A starkblast approaches, and Tim, realizing this is likely a trap set for him by The Covenant Man, befriends the tyger. Tim and the tyger ride out the storm under a magical protective blanket. The next morning, Tim discovers that the tyger is actually Maerlyn, a white magician, who had been trapped in the cage for years due to black magic. Maerlyn gives Tim a potion to cure his mother's blindness and sends him back to his mother on the flying magic blanket. Returning home, Tim brings sight back to his mother. Tim is attacked by Kells, who had secretly entered the home as Tim tended to his mother, but the boy is saved by his mother, who kills Kells with her late husband's ax.|$|E

40|$|The {{number of}} motor vehicle {{accidents}} that {{occur as a}} result of driving while <b>talking</b> on mobile <b>devices</b> increases each year. Distracted driving is dangerous; however, policy researchers have not focused on adults who <b>talk</b> on mobile <b>devices</b> as they drive children to and from daily events. This study focused on the experiences of soccer parents, an important focus because of soccer 2 ̆ 7 s year-long duration that requires a large amount of driving in addition to the other daily tasks of parenting. The purpose of this phenomenological study was to investigate the perceptions of parents of child soccer players regarding the motivations for and risks of <b>talking</b> on mobile <b>devices</b> while driving. The theoretical framework for this phenomenological study was the self-determination theory. Data were collected by electronic surveys using a convenience sample of 10 couples and 4 single parents of children who play soccer for a team in a southern state. Data were analyzed using the constant comparative method in which patterns were identified and coded into themes. The key findings were that the parents had different perceptions of the risks and motivations for <b>talking</b> on mobile <b>devices</b> while driving. There were participants who viewed <b>talking</b> on mobile <b>devices</b> as risky while others did not perceive <b>talking</b> on mobile <b>devices</b> while driving as a risk. Recommendations include conducting further research on parents who drive children to and from soccer practices, while <b>talking</b> on mobile <b>devices,</b> in order to gain better understanding of what motivates people to choose to <b>talk</b> on mobile <b>devices</b> while driving. The implications for positive social change include informing policy makers about the importance of increasing awareness and educating the public about the risks of <b>talking</b> on mobile <b>devices</b> while driving...|$|R

40|$|Investigating three {{different}} types of position sensitive photomultipliers, the H 4140 and H 4139 - 20 of Hamamatsu and the XP 1724 A of Philips, we confirm the producers parameters for all devices. However both the H 4140 and XP 1724 A {{have been found to}} have problems to detect the right fiber position at low light levels. The main difficulty for large cross <b>talk</b> <b>devices</b> is the non-uniform response of anode pixels. For the H 4139 - 20 very low cross talk and high sensitivity even for low light levels were found. Responding to light signals the device produces additional noise with amplitudes considerably above the normal random noise. Nevertheless, using the H 4139 - 20 for reading out 1 mm diameter fibers illuminated by traversing cosmic particles we measure efficiencies near to the theoretical maximum. (orig.)

30|$|Nevertheless, {{widespread}} interconnection of {{the most}} simple devices is often hindered by the cost associated with adding the communication and processing resources needed {{to allow them to}} talk to the network. To mitigate these cost problems, the development of a simple network protocol that is able to let thousands of <b>devices</b> <b>talk</b> over a variety of transmission media, while requiring very limited computational resources and small memory footprints on the nodes, would surely help.|$|R
50|$|Increasing {{the speed}} of the CPU becomes harder, because {{the speed of}} all the devices must {{increase}} as well.
