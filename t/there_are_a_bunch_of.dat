Mostly, 'Meg Stinks!' is a vast improvement over 'A Fistful of Meg' in almost every way, primarily because it’s actually more reminiscent of one of my favorite episodes of Family Guy: 'Road to Rupert.' Like that episode, 'Meg Stinks!' features a surprisingly effective Meg-Peter plot and, while it doesn't have an all-time great Stewie-Brian story, it’s still solid." ...|$|E

Get the rest of them policed up and call me back as soon as you know the number of that platoon and the battalion." [...] On Monday April 9, 1956 a Court of Inquiry was convened to inquire into the circumstances surrounding the marching of platoon 71 into Ribbon Creek. The proceedings began on April 10, 1956. Sergeant McKeon was initially represented by a Marine Corps attorney but on April 14, 1956, his brother in law, Thomas P. Costello stepped into the case to defend Sergeant McKeon. Mr. Costello was assisted by another New York lawyer, Jim McGarry and Lt. Jeremiah Collins, the appointed Marine Corps counsel. [...] There was no specific prohibition against entering the creek, as noted Colonel McKean in his memoir, Brigadier General William B. McKean, Ribbon Creek When asked by counsel for the defense, Mr. Costello, whether there were any orders that prohibited using the marshes and swamp areas for training exercises, Colonel McKean answered: [...] "....To {{the best of my knowledge}} the only order that relates to swamps has to do with marching down around the area of Elliot's Beach..." [...] During the Court of Inquiry proceedings Mr. Costello asserted that night marches were common exercises. In his memoir, Ribbon Creek at p. 228, Colonel McKean wrote that General [...] "Burger's efforts to deny the practice of night marches into swamps becomes ludicrous when we analyze the argument of his ghost writer, Major Faw." [...] id. Colonel McKean confirmed this practice by inquiring of approximately eighteen Marines assisting in the search of Ribbon Creek on April 10, 1956 whether any had marched at night into the swamps.

In the beginning the series Saji was just your average sex-crazed, teenage boy; {{but one day}} he steals his father's cell phone and gets {{a message from the}} mysterious girl named Alice promising to do sexual things to the first person to meet her. The next day at school, he bumps into Koizumi and learns from his friends about her and all the rumors surrounding her life. Later that night he goes to meet Alice and finds out that <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>a</b> <b>bunch</b> <b>of</b> other old guys there harassing all the young girls fitting Alice's description. He then sees Koizumi sitting on a bench laughing at how many perverted old men there are in the city. He immediately recognizes her voice as the one that called his dad's phone claiming to be Alice. When he exposes her, she takes him on a date stating that [...] "Alice doesn't lie." [...] The next morning Saji meets Koizumi again, much to her dismay, to talk about the previous night. When Koizumi immediately denies it to save face in front of her friends, Saji begins to think it was only a dream, but he decides to wholeheartedly dedicate himself to making his dream reality once more (whether or not they had sex is never fully confirmed nor denied; the manga confirms their sexual act as well as showing future sexual acts which leads to Koizumi's embarrassment many times). Over time he soon begins to realize that even though he may act extremely lecherous, Koizumi is the only girl he wants to be with. At one point, when he thinks that Koizumi may be attracted to another guy, he tells her he loves her. Despite being in love with Koizumi that is still not enough to stop his perverse actions, in which he often apologizes to Koizumi in his head while performing lewd acts. It {{should also be noted that}} Saji is on the basketball team and is actually quite good at it.|$|E

40|$|Why is Static Ranking so {{important}} nowadays? Since many years the Web has grown exponentially in size. But with this growth, {{the number of}} low-quality pages has increased as well. The Web is full of incorrect, malicious and spamming Websites. So {{it is more important}} than ever, to be able to grade the quality of a specific website. This is done with Static Ranking, also called Query-Independent Ranking. Basically <b>there</b> <b>are</b> <b>a</b> <b>bunch</b> <b>of</b> websites. Now the quality of each website is calculated by looking at some characterizing points of the Website. Through this quality, each website gets a rank, and through this rank, a ranking is built. Websites that are higher in the ranking, should also have a higher quality. Static Ranking has a lot of direct and indirect benefits. A direct one is of course that we can see how “good ” a page is. An indirect one is, that we can built up Crawl Priorities. Since the Web changes and grows each day, it is impossible for a search engine to crawl the whole Web during a short time. There have to be priorities, which websites should be revisited, and how frequently. Static Ranking obviously helps, in creating these priorities, e. g. a website with high quality should be revisited often, becaus...|$|E
