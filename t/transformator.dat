40|$|While {{changing}} {{the connection of}} the power <b>transformators</b> {{we have to find}} out if the powered distribution network can accept this change and if it will fulfil the set conditions. Important is to keep the range of permitted voltage on separate distribution points of this network and to find out proportions on separate circuits. This is connected with a circuit load which cannot exceed its limit (transmission capacity). The network is checked against outages of separate circuits (N- 1) and we try to find out if other circuits are not overloaded during the transmission of the outaged circuit’s power. We can also suggest various other possible outages. It is also important to find out whether separate distribution points agree with their short-circuit capabilities. Overall we investigate advantages of this circuit. The theoretical part describes the means of calculation of the network functioning and short-circuit conditions.

40|$|Abstract — A {{mathematical}} model of physical reality is proposed {{on the basis}} of the so-called p-adic numbers, providing p-adic probabilities. By this model, physical reality is information reality. Basic objects of this reality are <b>transformators</b> of information, basic processes are information processes, and the statistics are information statistics. The corresponding formalisms on in-formation spaces are outlined. They can be used for the study of psychologi-cal and social phenomena as well as for anomalous phenomena as discussed in mind-matter research. The statistical behavior of information processes may strongly differ from statistical behavior of physical processes in real space (or space-time) ...|$|R

40|$|Regional {{policy makers}} need {{regional}} economical data {{in order to}} define and backup their economical policy decisions. Regional input-output (IO) tables {{have proved to be}} useful in the policy making process, since the economic effects of policy decisions can be analysed in these models for the region as a whole. Unfortunately, the construction of regional IO tables on the basis of survey methods and other primary data collection methods is very costly and often incomplete. In this paper, we will discuss two techniques which can be applied to derive regional IO tables from national IO tables. In both methods, sectoral production specialization at the regional level is accounted for and affects the interindustrial structure of the region. The IO tables are constructed for 29 industrial sectors and 12 regions in the Netherlands. Policy makers, however, are not interested in the construction of regional IO tables themselves, but more in the economic indicators derived from them. Therefore, we present simple output- and employment-multipliers and employment- <b>transformators</b> derived from the IO tables and discuss some of the differences between them. A description of the economic performance of the Dutch regions is made by looking at the development of the economic indicators over a period of 12 years (1980 - 1992). ...|$|R
40|$|The High Temperature Superconductors (HTSC) Bi_ 2 Sr_ 2 CaCu_ 2 O_x and (Bi, Pb) _ 2 Sr_ 2 Ca_ 2 Cu_ 3 O_x are {{the most}} {{promising}} materials for technical applications like cables, magnets and <b>transformators.</b> So during the last years a tremendous activity especially {{on the development of}} silver sheathed Bi- 2223 tapes took place. To understand the formation mechanism of the desired materials and to develop high current capable wires and tapes for the mentioned applications a lot of microstructural work was done. This international work leaded to a maximum critical current density of 55 kA/cm" 2 on multifilament and 69 kA/cm" 2 on monofilament Bi- 2223 tapes and 8 kA/cm" 2 for Bi- 2212 tapes at 77 K. The aim of this work was to introduce the process of Bi- 2223 tape and Bi- 2212 wire fabrication (powder in tube process) at the university of Wuppertal and to get a fundamental understanding of the reaction mechanism which occur in the silver sheathed superconducting tapes. To characterize the Bi- 2223 tapes and Bi- 2212 wires a lot of measuring and analysing methods were taken into account. Besides the measurement of the critical current density at various temperatures and magnetic fields up to 8 T the microstructural and superconducting properties of the wires were investigated with X-ray diffraction, differential thermoanalysis, scanning electron microscopy, resistivity and ac-susceptibility measurements. In addition an overview of the precursor fabrication, the cold working process and the thermomechanical respectively thermal treatment of Bi- 2223 tapes and Bi- 2212 wires is given. Essentially the parameters of the properties of the precursors like grain size, carbon content and phase composition, the parameters for the cold working steps and the reaction to the disered Bi- 2223 and Bi- 2212 phases were considered and discussed in detail. All these efforts succeeded in a critical current density of nearly 30 kA/cm" 2 for pressed monofilament Bi- 2223 tapes and 5 kA/cm" 2 for monofilament Bi- 2212 wires at 77 K. For rolled multifilament tapes a critical current density of 42 kA/cm" 2 is reached. A detailled description of the fabrication of these high current carrying Bi- 2223 tapes is given and the microstructure is analysed. To understand the pinning mechanism and the dissipation losses of the superconductors the tapes were investigated in magnetic fields up to 8 T. The behaviour of the Bi- 2223 tapes as well as the Bi- 2212 wires can be described in the model of thermally activated flux flow according to Kim and Anderson. (orig.)

40|$|In this study, dynamic {{transformer}} rating (DTR) is applied on a {{medium power transformer}} thatis in use in the regional transmission grid. The transformer’s rated apparent power is 63 MVA, itis connected between a wind farm at 22 kV and the grid, K¨orsb¨arsdalen, at 135 kV. Power systemanalysis are carried out on the grid, with the objective to test how DTR and increased wind poweraffects the grid performance with respect to reliability, voltage stability and active losses. Historical measurements of ambient temperature and transformer loading {{is used to calculate}}free transformer capacity based on unity life time loss. For the investigated transformer and giventime period the load can be increased without endanger transformer lifetime. The dynamicallyrated capacity exceeds the nominal capacity through the whole tested time period but DTR showsmost effective during winter when the ambient temperature is colder and therefore, has a coolingeffect on the transformer. DTR is used to calculate available transformer capacity but an increasedcapacity often comes with the expense of decreased lifetime and reliability. With the help of DTRthe current rate of transformer lifetime usage can be calculated and used as input to economicalanalysis where there is a trade of between reliability and profit from increased capacity. Through the power system analysis procedure presented in this report it is possible to sortout the faults that are most probable to cause severe violations, this information can be used forefficient reinforcement of the grid. The contingency and reliability analysis can work as base tofind the solutions that will decrease the probability for violations most efficiently. Furthermore,the developed procedure can also be used when expanding the grid and to determine which gridalternative that will be most reliable.

After an intensity value, increasing rate of voltage decreases due to the characteristic property of the solar cell.
