25|$|The Sumerians saw {{sickness}} as {{a divine}} punishment imposed by different demons {{when an individual}} broke a rule. For this reason, to be a physician, one {{had to learn to}} identify approximately 6,000 possible demons that might cause health problems. To do this, the Sumerians employed divining techniques based on the flight of birds, position of <b>the</b> <b>stars</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> livers of certain animals. In this way, medicine was intimately linked to priests, relegating surgery to a second-class medical specialty.|$|E
25|$|In {{traveling}} {{across the}} sky, Ra brings {{light to the}} earth, sustaining all things that live there.

Nut, being the sky goddess, plays the big role in the Book of Nut. The text also tells about various other sky and earth deities, such as the star deities and the decans deities.

25|$|Having {{arrived in}} London on 2 February 1675, and staying with Jonas Moore at the Tower of London, Flamsteed had the {{opportunity}} to be taken by Titus to meet the King. He was subsequently admitted as an official Assistant to the Royal Commission and supplied observations in order to test St Pierre's proposal and to offer his own comments. The Commission's conclusions were that, although St Pierre's proposal was not worth further consideration, the King should consider establishing an observatory and appointing an observer in order to better map <b>the</b> <b>stars</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> motions of the Moon in order to underpin the successful development of the lunar-distance method of finding longitude.|$|E
25|$|The {{basis for}} {{division}} into zones was the two distinct paths of the heavenly bodies: {{that of the}} stars {{and that of the}} sun and moon. Astronomers know today that the Earth revolving around the sun is tilted on its axis, bringing each hemisphere now closer to the sun, now further away. The Greeks had the opposite model, that <b>the</b> <b>stars</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> sun rotated around the earth. The stars moved in fixed circles around the poles. The sun moved at an oblique angle to the circles, which obliquity brought it now to the north, now to the south. The circle of the sun was the ecliptic. It was the center of a band called the zodiac on which various constellations were located.|$|E

25|$|At the origin, {{after the}} {{separation}} of hot and cold, a ball of flame appeared that surrounded Earth like bark on a tree. This ball broke apart to form {{the rest of the}} Universe. It resembled a system of hollow concentric wheels, filled with fire, with the rims pierced by holes like those of a flute. Consequently, the Sun was the fire that one could see through a hole {{the same size as the}} Earth on the farthest wheel, and an eclipse corresponded with the occlusion of that hole. The diameter of the solar wheel was twenty-seven times that of the Earth (or twenty-eight, depending on the sources) and the lunar wheel, whose fire was less intense, eighteen (or nineteen) times. Its hole could change shape, thus explaining lunar phases. <b>The</b> <b>stars</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> planets, located closer, followed the same model.|$|E
25|$|The Flag Resolution did {{not specify}} any {{particular}} arrangement, number of points, nor orientation for <b>the</b> <b>stars</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> arrangement or whether the flag had to have seven red stripes and six white ones or vice versa. The appearance {{was up to the}} maker of the flag. Some flag makers arranged the stars into one big star, in a circle or in rows and some replaced a state's star with its initial. One arrangement features 13 five-pointed stars arranged in a circle, with the stars arranged pointing outwards from the circle (as opposed to up), the so-called Betsy Ross flag. This flag, however, is more likely a flag used for celebrations of anniversaries of the nation's birthday. Experts have dated the earliest known example of this flag to be 1792 in a painting by John Trumbull.|$|E

Elm Park was again in opposition as well as Storm <b>The</b> <b>Stars</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> leading French colt Epicuris. The Aidan O'Brien stable was represented by Hans Holbein (Chester Vase), Kilimanjaro (Lingfield Derby Trial) and Giovanni Canaletto (full-brother of the 2013 winner Ruler of the World). Dettori restrained the horse towards the rear of the field as Elm Park and Hans Holbein duelled for the lead in the early stages. In the straight Golden Horn made rapid progress on the outside, overtook Jack Hobbs a furlong from the finish and won by three and a half lengths from his stable companion with Storm The Stars four and a half lengths back in third place.|$|E

25|$|In {{the first}} round of the playoffs, Dallas faced their playoff arch-rivals, the Edmonton Oilers. The Stars swept the Oilers in four tough games, winning Game 4 in the third {{overtime}} on a goal by Joe Nieuwendyk. They then faced the St. Louis Blues in the second round. After taking a 2–0 series lead, the Blues stormed back to tie the series. The Stars then won the next two games to beat the Blues in six games. The series again ended on an overtime goal, this time from Mike Modano. In the Conference Finals, they faced the Colorado Avalanche for the first time in Stars history. This would be the first of four playoff meetings between the Stars and Avalanche in the next seven years. After both <b>the</b> <b>Stars</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Avalanche split the first four games at a 2–2 series tie, the Avalanche won Game 5 by a score of 7–5, taking a 3–2 series lead, The Stars rallied winning game six on the road, and game seven at home, both by 4–1 scores.|$|E
25|$|Spencer first {{articulated}} his evolutionary {{perspective in}} his essay, 'Progress: Its Law and Cause', published in Chapman's Westminster Review in 1857, and which later {{formed the basis}} of the First Principles of a New System of Philosophy (1862). In it he expounded a theory of evolution which combined insights from Samuel Taylor Coleridge's essay 'The Theory of Life' – itself derivative from Friedrich von Schelling's Naturphilosophie – with a generalisation of von Baer's law of embryological development. Spencer posited that all structures in the universe develop from a simple, undifferentiated, homogeneity to a complex, differentiated, heterogeneity, while being accompanied by a process of greater integration of the differentiated parts. This evolutionary process could be found at work, Spencer believed, throughout the cosmos. It was a universal law, that was applying to <b>the</b> <b>stars</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> galaxies as much as to biological organisms, and to human social organisation as much as to the human mind. It differed from other scientific laws only by its greater generality, and the laws of the special sciences could be shown to be illustrations of this principle.|$|E
25|$|The Apocalypse of Abraham {{told that}} Abraham argued {{to his father}} Terah that fire is more worthy of honor than idols, because its flames mock {{perishable}} things. Even more worthy of honor was water, because it conquers the fire and satisfies the earth. He called the earth more worthy of honor, because it overpowers {{the nature of the}} water. He called the sun more worthy of honor, because its rays illumine the whole world. But even the sun Abraham did not call god, because at night and by clouds it is obscured. Nor did Abraham call the moon or the stars god, because they also in their season obscure their light. Abraham argued to his father that they should worship the God who made everything, including the heavens, the sun, the moon, <b>the</b> <b>stars,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> earth. And while Abraham thus spoke to his father in the court of his house, the voice of God came down from heaven in a fiery cloudburst, crying to Abraham to leave his father's house so that he would not also die in his father's sins.|$|E
