25|$|The Minox cameras project {{an image}} of 8×11mm onto the negative. The film is in strips 9.2mm wide, or less than one-quarter the size of 35 mm film, and unlike 35mm film, it has no {{sprocket}} holes. This film strip is rolled up in the supply side chamber of a small twin chamber cartridge, with the film leader taped to a <b>take-up</b> <b>spool</b> in the take up chamber. The film strips can be up to 50 frames in length for Riga Minox and Minox II, III, IIIs and B cameras. From Minox BL and C cameras onward the Minox film cartridge holds 15, 30, or 36 exposures.|$|E
2500|$|A common {{mechanical}} problem {{occurred when}} a worn-out or dirty player rotated the supply spool {{faster than the}} <b>take-up</b> <b>spool</b> or failed to release the heads from the tape upon ejection. This would cause the magnetic tape to be fed out through {{the bottom of the}} cassette and become tangled in the mechanism of the player. In these cases the player was said to have [...] "eaten" [...] or [...] "chewed" [...] the tape, and it often destroyed the playability of the cassette altogether. Cutting blocks, analogous to those used for open-reel 1/4" [...] tape were readily available, though used mainly for retrieving valued recordings, could be used to remove the damaged portion, or repair the break in the tape.|$|E
50|$|In 1966 the two {{cameras were}} {{slightly}} modified {{and became the}} Pen EE (EL) and Pen EE.S (EL) with a modification of the <b>take-up</b> <b>spool</b> to make film loading easier. EL stands for Easy Loading. You can only recognize them by a small label marked EL stuck on the front, or you can open them {{and look at the}} <b>take-up</b> <b>spool.</b>|$|E
5000|$|... 1976: Minolta 110 Zoom SLR (Japan): first Pocket Instamatic 110 {{cartridge}} film SLR. Had built-in {{zoom lens}} (fixed 25-50mm f/4.5 Zoom Rokkor-Macro). Took up to 24 exposures of 13×17 mm frames on paper-backed, singly perforated, 16 mm wide film pre-threaded into double-ended cartridge with film supply and <b>take-up</b> <b>spools.</b> Compact, drop-in loading 110 film {{was introduced by}} Kodak in 1972. It was briefly an extremely popular non-SLR snapshot format but almost dead by 1982.|$|R
5000|$|Because {{the supply}} and <b>take-up</b> <b>spools</b> of the {{recording}} tape were no longer individually powered as in the UNITYPER 1, a mechanical solution consisting of a differential spring, ratching escapement and slip clutches was developed to overcome the problem of [...] "differential moment" [...] of accurately moving tape across the head. This was necessary because the supply reel is always decreasing in effective diameter while the take up reel is increasing in effective diameter as the tape moves from one reel to the other during encoding, and again when backspacing or rewinding.|$|R
25|$|The Correcting Selectric II used a new ribbon {{cartridge}} mechanism. The cartridge contained both supply and <b>take-up</b> <b>spools,</b> permitting both easy ribbon {{changes and the}} use of several types of ribbon on one machine. The ribbons were wider than had been used previously, giving more typed characters per inch of ribbon. Successive characters were staggered vertically on the ribbon, which incremented less than a full character position each time. Different types of ribbons had different-depth holes {{in the bottom of the}} cartridge, which set the mechanism to advance the ribbon by the amount appropriate for the type of ribbon.|$|R
5000|$|Inside, {{the film}} {{cassette}} engages the rewind fork at the top, {{and it is}} {{held in place by}} a hinged retaining ring at the bottom. The film lead passes under the fixed black film-pressure plate {{on its way to the}} slotted large diameter <b>take-up</b> <b>spool.</b> The spool always rotates the same angular amount to advance the film without a sprocket wheel drive. Acceptable frame spacing is accomplished by the large diameter <b>take-up</b> <b>spool</b> that reduces the effect of increasing spool diameter as more film is wound onto it.|$|E
50|$|Film {{transport}} {{was fully}} automatic in both directions, but {{the camera was}} not fitted with Canon's Quick Load feature; film still had to be manually threaded to the <b>take-up</b> <b>spool.</b>|$|E
50|$|Recorded rolls play at a specific, marked speed, {{where for}} example, 70 signifies 7 ft of paper travel in one minute, {{at the start}} of the roll. On all {{pneumatic}} player pianos, the paper is pulled on to a <b>take-up</b> <b>spool,</b> and as more paper winds on, so the effective diameter of the spool increases, and with it the paper speed. Player piano engineers were well aware of this, as can be seen from many patents of the time, but since reproducing piano recordings were generally made with a similar <b>take-up</b> <b>spool</b> drive, the tempo of the recorded performance is faithfully reproduced, despite the gradually increasing paper speed.|$|E
5000|$|... 1967: Zeiss Ikon Contaflex 126 (West Germany): first Kodapak Instamatic 126 {{cartridge}} film SLR. Was a Voigtländer {{focal-plane shutter}} design unrelated to 35 mm Contaflexes (see above), accepting fully interchangeable lenses. Took up to twenty exposures of 28×28 mm frames on paper-backed, singly perforated, 35 mm wide film pre-threaded into double-ended cartridge with film supply and <b>take-up</b> <b>spools.</b> Drop-in loading 126 film {{was introduced in}} 1963 as Kodak's first attempt (of many) {{to solve the problem}} of amateurs' difficulty in loading 135 film manually. It was briefly an extremely popular non-SLR snapshot format, but almost dead by 1972.|$|R

5000|$|Later on, as body {{serial numbers}} {{approached}} the two million mark, more easily detectable changes were introduced; the shutter speed dial on chrome cameras became chrome finished with coarse patterned sides. All screws {{are of the}} crosshead variety. The <b>take-up</b> film <b>spool</b> got a grey four-tongued plastic moulding for film attachment. The lens got a scalloped focusing ring.|$|R
50|$|Built by Lumiere Freres of Paris in 1901. The Periphote had a spring-wound clock motor that rotated, and {{the inside}} barrier held the roll of film and its <b>take-up</b> <b>spool.</b> Attached to the body was a 55mm Jarret lens and a prism that {{directed}} the light through a half-millimeter-wide aperture at the film.|$|E
50|$|Loading of {{the film}} is done by {{removing}} the bottom plate, like on the Leica II and III series; A Door flap on the rear of the camera can be raised, allowing for easier access to the film and overcoming a problem associated with these earlier screw lens fitting Leicas. The film is inserted {{from the bottom of the}} camera pre-attached to the <b>take-up</b> <b>spool.</b> Special cassettes were also available.|$|E
5000|$|The M2 was {{considered}} to be a more affordable, simplified version of the 1954 Leica M3. Notably, the frame counter of the M2 was composed of a disk plate beneath the film advance lever that had to be manually reset to zero after reloading. This system was close to that of the Leica III series, and unlike that of the M3, which is an independent frame counter, visible through a window in the top plate, that automatically resets to zero when the film <b>take-up</b> <b>spool</b> is removed.|$|E
5000|$|The {{original}} camera has a black {{shutter speed}} dial with a finely milled pattern at the edge, {{and the two}} black plastic covers either side at top of the mirror housing are glued in place. All visible screw heads are single slotted. At the back, {{either side of the}} viewfinder window two screws hold the top cover, which are situated at equal distance from viewfinder window either side. The <b>take-up</b> film <b>spool</b> is plain black with one slot. The accessory shoe has a small metal stud stop pin. The standard lens has an intermittent milled focusing ring without scalloping recesses. The lens cap is black anodised stamped aluminium with [...] "Minolta" [...] in brushed metal finish.|$|R
5000|$|Compared to tape recorders, wire {{recording}} devices {{have a high}} media speed, made necessary because {{of the use of}} the solid metal medium. Standard postwar wire recorders use a nominal speed of 24 inches per second (610 mm/s), making a typical one-hour spool of wire 7,200 feet (approx. 2200 m) long. This enormous length is possible on a spool less than 3 in in diameter because the wire was very fine, having a diameter of [...]004 to [...]006 in for later models, an improvement over Poulsen's Telegraphone of 1898 which used [...]01 in wire. Smaller 30- and 15-minute lengths of wire were employed by the majority of recorders made after 1945. Some heavy-duty recorders use the larger Armour spools, which can contain enough wire to record continuously for several hours. Because the wire is pulled past the head by the <b>take-up</b> <b>spool,</b> the actual wire speed slowly increases as the effective diameter of the <b>take-up</b> <b>spool</b> increases. Standardization prevented this peculiarity from having any impact on the playback of a spool recorded on a different machine, but audible consequences can result from substantially altering the original length of a recorded wire by excisions or by dividing it up onto multiple spools.|$|E
50|$|To load a film, two locks in {{the base}} of the camera need to be turned. The entire back and bottom can then be removed as a single unit, {{allowing}} easy access to the film chamber. Standard 35 mm film cassettes are used, with film being wound onto a removable <b>take-up</b> <b>spool</b> (the latter often becomes difficult to remove on older cameras). Winding the film cocks the shutter and forwards the frame counter simultaneously. The FED 2 has a manual frame counter located below the wind-on knob, which must be reset by hand when loading film.|$|E
5000|$|Music rolls for {{pneumatic}} player pianos, often {{known as}} piano rolls, {{consist of a}} continuous sheet of paper rolled on to a spool. The spool fits into the player piano spool box whereupon the free end of the music sheet is hooked onto the <b>take-up</b> <b>spool</b> which will unwind the roll at an even pace across the reading mechanism (the [...] "tracker bar") The music score to be played is programmed onto the paper by means of perforations. Different player systems have different perforation sizes, channel layouts and spool fittings though the majority conform {{to one or two}} predominant formats latterly adopted as the industry standard.|$|E
5000|$|A common {{mechanical}} problem {{occurred when}} a worn-out or dirty player rotated the supply spool {{faster than the}} <b>take-up</b> <b>spool</b> or failed to release the heads from the tape upon ejection. This would cause the magnetic tape to be fed out through {{the bottom of the}} cassette and become tangled in the mechanism of the player. In these cases the player was said to have [...] "eaten" [...] or [...] "chewed" [...] the tape, and it often destroyed the playability of the cassette altogether. Cutting blocks, analogous to those used for open-reel 1/4" [...] tape were readily available, though used mainly for retrieving valued recordings, could be used to remove the damaged portion, or repair the break in the tape.|$|E
50|$|To {{facilitate}} handling as {{the user}} threaded the wire across the recording head and affixed {{it to the}} <b>take-up</b> <b>spool,</b> some manufacturers attached a strip of plastic to {{each end of the}} wire. This was designed to press-fit snugly into either spool. To prevent the wire from piling up unevenly on the spool as it was recorded, played or rewound, on the majority of machines the head assembly slowly oscillates up and down or back and forth to distribute the wire evenly. On some machines, moving wire guides perform this function, like the mechanism that distributes line across a fishing reel. After recording or playback, the wire has to be rewound before any further use can be made of the machine. Unlike with reel-to-reel tape recorders, the take-up reel on most wire recorders is not removable.|$|E
5000|$|... 1979: Konica FS-1 (Japan): first SLR with {{built-in}} motorized autoloading. Also had autowinding (motorized single frame or continuous up to 1.5 {{frames per second}} film advance), but not auto-rewind. A snapshooter's great dislike (and Kodak bugbear) of 135 film was the need to manually thread the film leader into the camera's <b>take-up</b> <b>spool.</b> Built-in, motorized, automated film-transport systems (auto-load/wind/rewind) arrived with the Canon T70 (Japan) in 1984. Completely automated film handling systems appeared when automatic [...] "DX" [...] film speed setting was added to auto-transport in the Minolta Maxxum 7000 (Japan; see below) in 1985 and became standard in virtually all 35 mm SLRs by the late 1980s. This is, of course, a non-issue in modern digital SLRs. Although Konishiroku has a rich history including several first rank camera innovations, it {{was never able to}} establish Konica as a first tier brand and quit the SLR business in 1988.|$|E
50|$|The {{camera back}} is {{removable}} for changing film. A milled button {{next to the}} tripod socket rotates either way to lock the back, while in a position in between it is unlocked. The back comes off downwards as a single unit including the base-plate. A quite small film-pressure plate of thick glass is mounted {{on a piece of}} rubber foam on the back. Inside the camera, on the left-hand side, is the 35mm film cassette chamber, and to the right is the counter clockwise rotating film take-up drum. It has a narrow slit for the film leader, and it rotates freely whenever the small film rewind button on the top plate is depressed. No sprocket wheel is employed; instead, the film is pulled by, and wound onto the drum that always rotates the same angular amount for next picture frame. Acceptable frame spacing is accomplished by the large diameter <b>take-up</b> <b>spool</b> that reduces the effect of increasing spool diameter as more film is wound onto it.|$|E
5000|$|Like the 120 format, {{there is}} a {{continuous}} backing paper, and the frame number is visible through a small window {{at the rear of}} the cartridge. Cameras for this type of film are equipped with a large rectangular window in the back door, through which is visible not only the frame number, but also a portion of the label showing the film type and speed. The cartridge has a captive <b>take-up</b> <b>spool,</b> but no supply spool: the film and backing paper are simply coiled tightly and placed in the supply end of the cartridge. The positioning of the image is fixed by the cartridge. The film is 35 mm wide, but unlike 135 film, it is unperforated, except for one registration hole per image, similar to the earlier 828 film. The camera is equipped with a sensing pin which falls into this hole when the film is fully advanced to the next frame, at which point the winding knob or lever is locked, so as to prevent winding past the pre-exposed frame lines.|$|E
50|$|The Rollei 16 used special Super 16 film {{cartridges}} with {{a capacity}} of 18 frames. As no film manufacturer was interested in making this film format, Rollei had to manufacture the film itself. A roll of B/W film cost 5 DM, while slide film (available until 1981) cost 12.50 DM, including development. Loading the film simply required inserting the leader into the appropriate slot in the camera. Since there was no <b>take-up</b> <b>spool,</b> the film coiled up loosely on itself. Without a doubt, limited film choice and availability adversely affected camera sales, consequently only 25,000 units were produced. As Rollei also spent a lot on advertising, this camera did little to alleviate its dire financial situation. Reliance on a film format that Kodak, the market leader, did not support was foolhardy. Needless to say, {{the quality of the}} engineering in the Rollei 16 matched its high price; it had a push-pull viewfinder with automatic parallax correction up to 40 cm, whereby extending the viewfinder also wound on the film and cocked the shutter. In addition, Mutar wide-angle (0.5×) and telephoto (1.7×) conversion lenses were available as accessories. An improved successor, the Rollei 16S, was released in 1965.|$|E
50|$|The Kine Exakta {{controls}} are somewhat {{different from those}} found on most later 35mm SLR film cameras: The finder hood in its collapsed state automatically blocks the shutter release. The film is transported towards the left, leaving the exposed frames {{the other way round}} on the filmstrip. The wind-on lever on the left-hand top plate is operated by the left hand thumb and it requires a single 300-degree movement. It advances the film one frame, cocks the shutter, and increments the manual reset frame counter. The lift, turn and set shutter speed dial on the left-hand top plate provides exposure times from 1/25 to 1/1000 second, plus B and Z (time). For double exposures, the shutter may be cocked again by turning the shutter speed dial itself. On the right-hand top plate sits a separately wound dual purpose dial, featuring long time exposure and delayed action shutter release. It works at the shutter setting B and is only settable after the shutter is cocked. Slow speeds are selected by the lift, turn and set procedure against a small index dot. The long exposures times, without delay, are marked in black numerals all the way to 12 seconds, while slow speeds with delayed action are in red numerals to 6 seconds. This is the extent of self-timer release available. All functions are activated by the left-hand front located threaded shutter release button. A film-cutting device is located inside the camera. It enables a partially exposed film to be removed from the camera in daylight for processing provided the left-hand <b>take-up</b> <b>spool</b> was placed in a cassette. A small milled knob at the base is unscrewed and pulled out to cut the film close to the unexposed film cassette.|$|E
5000|$|As {{expected}} {{of a professional}} camera at the time, the LX provides mechanical shutter speeds, ranging from the flash synchronization ('X') speed of 1/75 second to 1/2000 second and bulb ('B'), permitting manual operation without battery power. The slow speeds from 1/60 second to 4 seconds, {{as well as the}} exposure meter, are battery dependent. Construction is strong and durable, with a solid cast metal frame and metal covering plates. All buttons and dials are weather and dust sealed, a unique feature not found on other professional cameras of the day. Underneath the satin black finish is black chrome, so that even as the surface finish inevitably wore through in hard professional use, the underlying metal would not look brassy. Both the viewfinder and the focusing screen are interchangeable to suit the task at hand, a large choice of alternatives were available. The camera has a somewhat uncommon frame counter, being able {{to keep track of the}} frame number in either direction, whether advancing or rewinding the film; this feature dramatically adds to the flexibility of the camera, as well as aids in multiple exposures. The camera has a multi-function lever that supports mirror lock-up, self-timer and depth of field preview. Both a winder and motor drive were available, and a full complement of other professional accessories. Many additional features could be found inside the camera, the [...] "Magic-Needles" [...] ringed the film <b>take-up</b> <b>spool.</b> Found on M-series bodies, it was included in the LX to make loading a quick task. The shutter curtains are made of a Titanium foil composite and a small thumb operated dial sit to the side of the film plane to operate a mask that could be deployed for use with the time data back when installed in place of the standard back. As stated about the mask for data back, Pentax offered two types. The time stamp version that included a wristwatch style component that was inserted in the back and projected on to the deployed mask. The other data back was a three digit type that could project dates or useful information on to the film. Also taking advantage of the removable back was a high capacity magazine allowing for 250 exposures.|$|E
5000|$|While {{the camera}} is almost {{completely}} battery dependent (small exception)—power is provided by a 6 volt PX28 (originally Mercury specified 1968 and Silver-Oxide 1971), but equal substitutes PX28S/4SR44—as with many systems of the era, the mirror and cloth curtains are mechanically driven, {{the timing of the}} shutter being electrically governed by transistors and a magnet. The combination of capacitors routed by the speed setting determine the length of time the magnet remains engaged. Also, the operation of the shutter is not normally possible without film being properly loaded. However, one can test the shutter by rotating the counter dial away from the empty position while the film door is open and then by closing the film door while still holding the dial, thus facilitating the unlocking of the advance mechanism and operation of the shutter. The frame counter is incremented only while there is film passing through the [...] "main roller" [...] or [...] "counter roller" [...] next to the <b>take-up</b> <b>spool</b> in the camera. The camera disengages the [...] "transport system" [...] when the counter dial (connected to the frame counting control cam) has reached the last frame, or when the counter has returned to the [...] "empty" [...] or start position. The automatic frame counter resets only if the shutter is released before opening the back. Because a battery must power the timing, the loss of adequate voltage means the camera halts after the mirror is allowed to rise, and therefore the curtain release will not disengage. To drive the mirror to finish the cycle, a small button located flush on the right-hand camera front, just below the shutter-release button, is provided for restarting of the mirror/shutter cycle. Depressing the shutter release once more will release the cycles. The shutter release button is standard threaded for bulb or cable releases or the use of a large accessory button. The fingernail-operated latch to the left lower side releases the film door for loading. The film spools are secured by the pins and slot shaped opening at either end to the spool. The camera has two twist-lock cams that turn and pull out to open, the left side for the unexposed roll and the right side, known as the “take-up”. Because of the arrangement differences of the 120 and 220 start length of paper, the indicated starting points are marked above the film plane for lining-up of the start marks for the film. The film advance system is a tension/friction type, the film source side being a tension brake and the take-up side torque/slip clutch. A counting cam governs the frame count and interacts with the friction system to allow enough slip and movement to accurately space each frame {{from the beginning of the}} roll to the end. The counting cam also allows the system to regulate a lock to open and close, allowing the shutter to fire. This slip system has brought criticism of durability in early models, as it would slip more over time, causing frame spacing issues as well as disengaging the shutter. The frame counter system, tied to the counter roller, operates the automatic reset of the counter (returns it to start) whenever the back is opened and also sets the regulating of the next frame.|$|E
