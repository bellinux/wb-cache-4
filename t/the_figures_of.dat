5|$|Dating from 1112 to 1519, Exeter Cathedral is {{the major}} example of a cathedral built mainly in the later Decorated Gothic style of the 14th century.

Exeter has many sculptural details, including <b>the</b> <b>figures</b> <b>of</b> its west front.|$|E
5|$|Even {{though it}} was {{subordinate}} to Vale Royal Abbey, the church at Llanbadarn Fawr remained important in its own right.

5|$|Joseph Fontenrose wrote Orion : the Myth of the Hunter and the Huntress (1981) to show Orion as {{the type}} {{specimen}} {{of a variety}} of grotesque hero. Fontenrose views him as similar to Cúchulainn, that is, stronger, larger, and more potent than ordinary men and the violent lover of the Divine Huntress; other heroes of the same type are Actaeon, Leucippus (son of Oenomaus), Cephalus, Teiresias, and Zeus as the lover of Callisto. Fontenrose also sees Eastern parallels in <b>the</b> <b>figures</b> <b>of</b> Aqhat, Attis, Dumuzi, Gilgamesh, Dushyanta, and Prajapati (as pursuer of Ushas).|$|E
5|$|Many {{scholars}} consider <b>the</b> <b>figures</b> <b>of</b> Gullveig/Heiðr and Freyja the same. These conclusions {{have been}} made through comparisons between the figure of Gullveig/Heiðr's use of seiðr in Völuspá and the mention of Freyja introducing seiðr to the Æsir from the Vanir in Heimskringla. This is at times taken further that their corruption of the Æsir led to the Æsir–Vanir War.|$|E

5|$|Perhaps no {{work of art}} so {{imperfect}} ever announced {{such power}} in the artist—perhaps no artist so powerful ever rested his fame on so imperfect a production—as Thalaba. The author calls it a metrical romance; he might have called it a lyrical one; for the story is told, as in an ode, by implication; not directly, as in an epopoeia. It is a gallery of successive pictures. Each is strikingly descriptive... but the personages, like <b>the</b> <b>figures</b> <b>of</b> landscape-painters, are often almost lost in the scene: they appear as the episodical or accessory objects.|$|E
5|$|The {{construction}} of {{the entrance to the}} Duomo of Salò is copiously documented between 1506 and 1509. The design was by Cairano, most likely in collaboration with Antonio Mangiacavalli. Cairano's hand is evident in <b>the</b> <b>figures</b> <b>of</b> the Father, St. Peter and St. John the Baptist, leaving the Virgin to his collaborator, while the Angel of the Annunciation and two small busts in the spandrels appear to be a joint work. The architectural parts were accomplished by different stonemasons as recorded in the documents relating to the workshops, including Mangiacavalli's son. The portal was put in place by August 1508, and embellishments and other work ended at the beginning of 1509.|$|E

5|$|Aberdeen-born John Alexander and William Mossman {{were the}} leading {{portrait}} {{artists of the}} first half of the century. John Alexander was born in Aberdeen and was a great grandson of portrait painter George Jamesone. He studied in London and Rome, returning to Scotland about 1720. His younger contemporary William Mossman (1700–71) was also from Aberdeen and studied in Rome. Both worked predominately in the north-east around their home city, but also painted many of <b>the</b> <b>figures</b> <b>of</b> early-Enlightenment Edinburgh. Alexander's best known work included the portrait of George Drummond the Lord Provost of Edinburgh (1756), who had been responsible for the creation of the New Town in Edinburgh and the Royal Infirmary, which is shown in the background of the painting. Mosman's work included his portrait of John Campbell of the Bank (1749), who was chief cashier of the Royal Bank of Scotland and a Whig, but who is depicted in the recently forbidden Highland Dress. Because of his Jacobite sympathies Alexander was forced to leave for the continent after the rebellion of 1745, and in Rome he made a living painting the Jacobite expatriates who congregated there, before his return a few years later.|$|E
5|$|Ann {{discovers that}} her predecessor, Emily Jessel (Lightfoot), {{is buried in}} Bly's church, and is told that Jessel killed herself. She also begins to see <b>the</b> <b>figures</b> <b>of</b> {{a young man and}} a young woman around Bly. Mrs Grose dismisses Ann's stories, but one maid, Carla (Walker), tells Ann of the sexually abusive former valet Peter Quint (MacLiam). Mrs Grose reveals that Carla had been badly {{affected}} by the War, and is prone to flights of fancy. Later, Ann is woken at night by the figure of the woman, and follows her to find Flora standing next to an open window. The pair see Carla fall from the roof, landing near Miles, who is in the garden. Ann rushes outside, and sees the male figure on the roof. Inside again, Mrs Grose assures Ann that she must be confused.|$|E
5|$|It is {{difficult}} to estimate the number of slaves in ancient Greece, {{given the lack of}} a precise census and variations in definitions during that era. It is certain that Athens had the largest slave population, with as many as 80,000 in the 6th and 5th centuries BC, on average three or four slaves per household. In the 5th century BC, Thucydides remarked on the desertion of 20,890 slaves during the war of Decelea, mostly tradesmen. The lowest estimate, of 20,000 slaves, during the time of Demosthenes, corresponds to one slave per family. Between 317 BC and 307 BC, the tyrant Demetrius Phalereus ordered a general census of Attica, which arrived at the following figures: 21,000 citizens, 10,000 metics and 400,000 slaves. The orator Hypereides, in his Against Areistogiton, recalls that the effort to enlist 15,000 male slaves of military age led to the defeat of the Southern Greeks at the Battle of Chaeronea (338 BC), which corresponds to <b>the</b> <b>figures</b> <b>of</b> Ctesicles.|$|E

5|$|Pandora Crowned by the Seasons is {{an unusual}} composition, painted to {{resemble}} a bas-relief in which the different elements are emerging from a flat background. The figure of Pandora stands in the centre, with Vulcan {{to one side and}} Venus and Cupid to the other, each leaning away from her; <b>the</b> <b>figures</b> <b>of</b> Vulcan and Venus, along with the four figures representing the seasons in the upper corners of the canvas, create a diamond shape around Pandora. The foot of Vulcan rests upon the picture frame, a favourite device of Rubens; elements of the picture's composition are also taken from an 1817 engraving on the same subject, drawn by Etty's fellow York artist John Flaxman and engraved by William Blake. As with all Etty's history paintings from this time on, he worked by painting the figures first, and only filling in the background once the figures were complete.|$|E
