500|$|Say Anything {{signed with}} J Records in 2005, owned by Sony BMG Music Entertainment, {{one of the}} [...] "big four" [...] record labels. When asked why he signed with a major label, Bemis stated, [...] "We were looking <b>to</b> <b>expand</b> <b>our</b> fan base as well as have more money to tour comfortably. I also wanted enough money to work with an awesome {{producer}} for [...]" [...] In June 2005, Say Anything was forced to cancel a six-week headlining tour with Circa Survive and Emanuel {{on the third day}} of the tour due to health problems with Bemis, including [...] "full-on paranoid delusions" [...] in Austin, Texas. [...] At this point, Bemis' bipolar disorder and drug addictions were wreaking havoc on the band. [...] Bassists DeLauro and Seaton had already parted ways with the band. [...] Andy Jackson left in September after only a few months of touring with Say Anything. [...] Casper Adams, who was clashing personally with Bemis despite a close friendship, was fired after a show.|$|E
500|$|The {{cooperative}} puzzle solving aspect was highlighted as {{a valuable}} addition to the game. Welsh called the cooperative mode [...] "one of the most satisfying and genuinely collaborative gaming experiences you can have with a friend". Onyett wrote, [...] "Valve knows how a good co-operative mode requires a game design that doesn't simply encourage but requires you to work together. In Portal 2, communication is vital to success". Several reviewers praised the non-verbal cues that players could initiate to work with their partners. Portal 2 was praised {{for the amount of}} detail in its design, sound, and music. Nelson credited the [...] "sheer amount of detail" [...] put into the game's world, and wrote, [...] "it all feels very real and natural with brief moments where you're simply sucked into this world". Onyett was impressed with the amount of visual details and capabilities Valve achieved from their Source game engine and that the added details and animations of the levels [...] "consistently serv not only to entertain the eye but <b>to</b> <b>expand</b> <b>our</b> understanding of the game's characters". Hoggins wrote that the game's world reacted to the player-character Chell's presence [...] "in a startlingly organic way", and praised Valve's design as [...] "an achievement of world-building that compares favourably with BioShock underwater city of Rapture".|$|E

Framingham Heart Study, the opportunity <b>to</b> <b>expand</b> upon the ex vivo human observation has remained limited within the field of translational medicine.

2500|$|In {{alternative}} medicine, hyperbaric {{medicine has}} been promoted {{as a treatment for}} cancer. A 2012 review article in the journal, Targeted Oncology, reports that [...] "there is no evidence indicating that HBO neither acts as a stimulator of tumor growth nor as an enhancer of recurrence. On the other hand, there is evidence that implies that HBO might have tumor-inhibitory effects in certain cancer subtypes, and we thus strongly believe that we need <b>to</b> <b>expand</b> <b>our</b> knowledge on the effect and the mechanisms behind tumor oxygenation." [...] However, a 2011 study by the American Cancer Society reported no evidence it is effective for this purpose.|$|E
2500|$|Heinrich Lissauer {{shared his}} ideas about agnosia after Wernicke and Kussmaul. In 1890, he theorized {{that there were}} two ways in which object {{recognition}} impairment could occur. [...] One way in which impairment could occur was if there was damage to early perceptual processing or if there was damage to the actual object representation. [...] If the actual object representation was damaged, this would not allow the object to be stored in visual memory, and therefore the individual {{would not be able to}} recognize the object. [...] During the time of Wernicke, Kussmaul and Lissauer there was little known about the cerebral cortex. [...] Today, with new neuroimaging techniques, we have been able <b>to</b> <b>expand</b> <b>our</b> knowledge on agnosia greatly.|$|E

Eli Lilly pleaded guilty to actively promoting Zyprexa for off-label uses, particularly {{for the treatment of}} dementia in the elderly. The $1.415 billion penalty included an $800 million civil settlement and a $515 million criminal fine. The U.S. Justice Department said the criminal fine of $515 million was the largest ever in a health care case, and the largest criminal fine for an individual corporation ever imposed in a U.S. criminal prosecution of any kind. [...] "That was a blemish for us," [...] John C. Lechleiter, CEO of Lilly, told The New York Times. [...] "We don’t ever want that to happen again. We put measures in place to assure that not only do we have the right intentions in integrity and compliance, but we have systems in place to support that."

60|$|Surely {{this will}} be the philosophic method. If we seem to {{ourselves}} to have discovered a law, we do not throw it away the moment we find phaenomena which will not be explained by it. We use those phaenomena to correct and <b>to</b> <b>expand</b> <b>our</b> law. And this belief that History is 'God educating man,' is no mere hypothesis; it results from the observation of thousands of minds, throughout thousands of years. It has long seemed--I trust it will seem still--the best explanation of the strange deeds of that strange being, man: and where we find in history facts which seem to contradict it, we shall not cast away rashly or angrily either it or them: but if we be Bacon's true disciples, we shall use them patiently and reverently to correct and expand our notions of the law itself, and rise thereby to more deep and just conceptions of education, of man, and--it may be--of God Himself.|$|E
