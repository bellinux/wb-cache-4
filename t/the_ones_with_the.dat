25|$|Braille was {{introduced}} to Britain in 1861. In 1876, a French-based system with a few hundred English contractions and abbreviations was adopted as the predominant script in Great Britain. However, the contractions and abbreviations proved unsatisfactory, and in 1902 the current grade-2 system, called Revised Braille, was adopted in the British Commonwealth. In 1878, the ideal of basing all braille alphabets {{of the world on}} the original French alphabetic order was accepted by Britain, Germany, and Egypt (see International Braille). In the United States at the time, three scripts were used: non-braille New York Point; American Braille, which was reordered so that the most frequent letters were <b>the</b> <b>ones</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> fewest dots; and a variation of English Braille, which was reordered to match the English alphabet, assigning the values wxyz to the letters that, in France and England, stood for xyzç. A partially contracted English Braille, Grade 1½, was adopted in Britain in 1918, and fully contracted Grade 2, with a few minor concessions to the Americans, was adopted in 1932. The concessions were to swap the British two-dot capital sign with the one-dot emphasis sign, which had generally been omitted anyway (as capitals had been in New York Point), to drop a few religious contractions from general usage, and to introduce a rule stating that contractions and abbreviations should not span 'major' syllable boundaries.|$|E

She noted, [...] "you can view the episode as a critique of all kinds of themes: Mob mentality, reality television, even the complicated treatment of women in the justice system ... Primarily, though, this episode is a critique of our deep, often-unexamined mass desensitization, or at least a dread portent of its potential to grow.

500|$|On 27 November 2009, it was {{revealed}} that Shakira was conducting auditions to choose a different opening act for each of the tour's appearances in different cities.

Sean Wolfington, Shakira's digital-business partner, talked about the decision and told the New York Post that [...] "The artists will open for Shakira live in big cities and virtually through a video performance in smaller markets. There are a lot of talented artists, and Shakira wants to help them by giving them part of her stage". The visuals and conceptual video scenes for the tour were managed and designed by entertainment branding agency Loyalkaspar, who had previously designed tour visuals for artists like U2 and Jay-Z. Elliott Chaffer, the creative director of the agency, talked about the project, saying that [...] "Shakira was a much bigger undertaking then anything we've attempted previously. They were looking for original content that had to work over two LED screens and on a huge projector mapping surreal models of an ever-changing animated face, all in just three weeks. This is for her global world tour, so modifications to the setlist and track durations continued through nine rounds of revisions". The visuals were projected onto the large screen set behind the stage. The stage was shaped {{in the form of the}} letter [...] "T" [...] to enable a maximum number of viewers to see Shakira.|$|E

2500|$|An {{algorithm}} for listing all maximal independent sets or maximal cliques in a graph {{can be used}} as a subroutine {{for solving}} many NP-complete graph problems. Most obviously, the solutions to the maximum independent set problem, the maximum clique problem, and the minimum independent dominating problem must all be maximal independent sets or maximal cliques, and can be found by an algorithm that lists all maximal independent sets or maximal cliques and retains <b>the</b> <b>ones</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> largest or smallest size. Similarly, the minimum vertex cover can be found as the complement of one of the maximal independent sets. [...] observed that listing maximal independent sets can also be used to find 3-colorings of graphs: a graph can be 3-colored if and only if the complement of one of its maximal independent sets is bipartite. He used this approach not only for 3-coloring but as part of a more general graph coloring algorithm, and similar approaches to graph coloring have been refined by other authors since. Other more complex problems can also be modeled as finding a clique or independent set of a specific type. This motivates the algorithmic problem of listing all maximal independent sets (or equivalently, all maximal cliques) efficiently.|$|E

2500|$|Many causes {{have been}} {{proposed}} for this decline; {{a combination of factors}} is most likely. When asked why they do not vote, many people report that they have too little free time. However, over the last several decades, studies have consistently shown that the amount of leisure time has not decreased. According {{to a study by the}} Heritage Foundation, Americans report on average an additional 7.9 hours of leisure time per week since 1965. Furthermore, according to a study by the National Bureau of Economic Research, increases in wages and employment actually decrease voter turnout in gubernatorial elections and do not affect national races. Potential voters' perception that they are busier is common and might be just as important as a real decrease in leisure time. Geographic mobility has increased over the last few decades. There are often barriers to voting in a district where one is a recent arrival, and a new arrival is likely to know little about the local candidate and local issues. Francis Fukuyama has blamed the welfare state, arguing that the decrease in turnout has come shortly after the government became far more involved in people's lives. He argues in Trust: The Social Virtues and The Creation of Prosperity that the social capital essential to high voter turnouts is easily dissipated by government actions. However, on an international level those states with the most extensive social programs tend to be <b>the</b> <b>ones</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> highest turnouts. Richard Sclove argues in Democracy and Technology that technological developments in society such as [...] "automobilization," [...] suburban living, and [...] "an explosive proliferation of home entertainment devices" [...] have contributed to a loss of community, which in turn has weakened participation in civic life.|$|E
2500|$|A {{believer in}} the Yamato race theory, Kishi had nothing but {{contempt}} for the Chinese as a people, whom he disparaging referred to as [...] "lawless bandits" [...] who were [...] "incapable of governing themselves". Precisely for these racist reasons, Kishi believed {{there was no point}} to establishing the rule of law in Manchukuo as the Chinese were not capable of following laws, and instead brute force was what was needed to maintain social stability. In Kishi's analogy, just as dogs were not capable of understanding such abstract concepts such as the law, but could be trained to be utterly obedient to their masters, the same went with the Chinese, whom Kishi claimed were more mentally closer to dogs than humans. In this way, Kishi maintained that once the Japanese proved that they were <b>the</b> <b>ones</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> power, the dog-like Chinese would come to be naturally obedient to their Japanese masters, and as such the Japanese had to behave {{with a great deal of}} sternness to prove that they were the masters. Kishi when speaking in private always used the term [...] "Manchū" [...] to refer to Manchukuo, instead of [...] "Manchūkoku", which reflected his viewpoint that Manchukuo was not a state, but rather just a region rich in resources and 34 million people to be used for Japan's benefit. In Kishi's eyes, Manchukuo and its people were literally just resources to be exploited by Japan, and he never made the pretense in private of maintaining Japanese rule was good for the people of Manchukuo. Alongside the exploitation as men as slave workers went the exploitation of women as sex slaves as women were forced into becoming [...] "comfort women" [...] as sexual slavery in the Imperial Army and Navy was called. Kishi's racist and sexist views of Chinese and Korean women as simply [...] "disposable bodies" [...] to be used by Japanese men meant he had no qualms about rounding up women and girls to serve in the [...] "comfort women corps".|$|E
