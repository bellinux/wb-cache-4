5|$|The Alter Real is {{a strain}} of the Lusitano which is bred only at the Alter Real State Stud in Portugal. The stud was founded in 1748 by the Portuguese royal family to provide horses for the {{national}} riding academy and royal use. The Portuguese School of Equestrian Art (Escola Portuguesa de Arte Equestre) uses these horses exclusively in their performances. <b>The</b> <b>strain</b> was developed from 300 Iberian mares imported from Spain in 1747.

However, in the 19th and 20th centuries <b>the</b> <b>strain</b> was re-established with the further introduction of Spanish blood. In the early 20th century, with the 1910 revolution that ended the monarchy, the Alter Real strain faced extinction, as records were burned, stallions were gelded and the stud discontinued. Ruy d'Andrade, a specialist in Iberian horse breeds, saved two stallions and several mares, and was able to re-establish <b>the</b> <b>strain,</b> turning his herd over to the Portuguese Ministry of Agriculture in 1942, when the stud was reopened.

5|$|The Carthusian {{line was}} {{established}} in the early 18th century when two Spanish brothers, Andrés and Diego Zamora, purchased a stallion named El Soldado and bred him to two mares. The mares were descended from mares purchased by the Spanish king and placed at Aranjuez, one of the oldest horse breeding farms in Spain. One of the offspring of El Soldado, a dark gray colt named Esclavo, became the foundation sire of the Carthusian line. One group of mares sired by Esclavo in about 1736 were given to a group of Carthusian monks to settle a debt. Other animals of these bloodlines were absorbed into the main Andalusian breed; the stock given to the monks was bred into a special line, known as Zamoranos. Throughout the following centuries, the Zamoranos bloodlines were guarded by the Carthusian monks, to the point of defying royal orders to introduce outside blood from the Neapolitan horse and central European breeds. They did, however, introduce Arabian and Barb blood to improve <b>the</b> <b>strain.</b> The original stock of Carthusians was greatly depleted during the Peninsular Wars, and <b>the</b> <b>strain</b> might have become extinct if not for the efforts of the Zapata family. Today, the Carthusian strain is raised in state-owned stud farms around Jerez de la Frontera, Badajoz and Cordoba, and also by several private families.

40|$|Nineteen {{strains of}} Gymnodinium catenatum were {{isolated}} from one bloom in Andalucía (S Spain) and from different blooms in Galicia (NW Spain).

Since all <b>the</b> <b>strains</b> were identical in the LSU sequenced region, another fragment comprising the internal transcribed spacer 1 (ITS 1), 5. 8 S rRNA gene and ITS 2, was sequenced and compared among all <b>the</b> <b>strains.</b> Although this region has been used before for the detection of intraspecific variability, it was similar in all our strains.
