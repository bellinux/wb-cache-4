5000|$|A {{tractor unit}} (prime mover or <b>traction</b> <b>unit)</b> is a {{characteristically}} heavy-duty towing engine that provides motive power for hauling a towed or trailered load.

50|$|Most of {{the rolling}} stock used by CFM was {{manufactured}} in the USSR and other countries of the Soviet bloc. The most widespread type of <b>traction</b> <b>unit</b> is Soviet-built triple section 3TE10M (sometimes only 1 or 2 sections are used). Their use in Moldova was motivated by steep gradients on some portions of the rail network (especially, in the regions with hilly terrains), where additional power was needed to pull heavy freight trains. Other popular types of locomotives are M62 ("Mashka") and 2TE10L. Sometimes, Czech-built shunters ChME3 are used as traction units for local passenger operations.|$|E

Each <b>Traction</b> <b>Unit</b> consists of two identical motor cars and a trailer with the driver's cab. All the coaches are intercommunicating. The traction voltage can be 750 V or 1500 V to comply with the different voltages and feeding systems in use on Milan Metro lines (fourth rail on M1, catenary on M2 and M3).Trains have a total of 24 doors per side and are equipped with surveillance cameras and LCD screens.|$|E

50|$|In 1985 {{what may}} in retrospect {{be viewed as}} the harbinger of private rail {{operation}} occurred when the quarry company Foster Yeoman bought a small number of extremely powerful 3600 hp locomotives from General Motors' Electromotive Division (GM-EMD), designated British Rail Class 59, to operate mineral trains from their quarry in Wiltshire. Although owned and maintained by Foster Yeoman, the Class 59s were manned by British Rail staff. During acceptance trials, on 16 February 1986 locomotive 59001 hauled a train weighing 4639 tonnes - the heaviest load ever hauled by a single non-articulated <b>traction</b> <b>unit.</b> Foster Yeoman's class 59s proved extremely reliable, and it was not long before quarry company ARC and privatised power generator National Power also bought small numbers of Class 59s to haul their own trains.|$|E
50|$|The {{locomotives}} use water (60% ethylene glycol.) cooled MITRAC TC3100 type inverters,) {{rated at}} 2500 kW. Each converter supplies two parallel connected traction motors; The traction motors are three phase induction designs with {{two sets of}} 'half' windings for each phase: an individual <b>traction</b> <b>unit</b> includes 8 four-quadrant converters (4QC), and two asynchronous motors. Under DC supply (3 kV, up to 4 kV peak) two three-phase inverter blocks are connected in series; each inverter block supplies one set of 'half' windings on two parallel connected motors. When under 25 kV AC the high voltage supply is stepped down to 2.8 kV, and rectified by four-quadrant converters to an intermediate DC link, which supplies an inverter block powering two parallel connected motors, with the 'half' windings connected in series.|$|E
50|$|By 1904 {{motor bus}} {{services}} in country districts {{began to be}} a real cause of competition for the railway. The GWR was seeking methods of catering economically for light passenger traffic, using steam railcars. These consisted of a passenger coach into which was built a four-wheeled steam locomotive, duplicate driving controls being provided at the opposite end from the locomotive. The very limited power of the small <b>traction</b> <b>unit</b> was always an issue, and on the steeply graded Forest of Dean Railway section it proved impracticable. Instead higher capacity units known as auto-trains, consisting of a tank locomotive coupled to one or two coaches were used. The coach remote from the locomotive had driving controls and a mechanical linkage enabled the driver to operate the locomotive regulator. Some configurations marshalled an intermediate trailer between the driving trailer and the locomotive, and in the extreme this could be done both ends of the locomotive, giving four passenger coaches.|$|E

50|$|The ETR 610 / RABe 503 (also {{known as}} the Cisalpino Due {{as it was the}} second class of tilting trains {{exploited}} by Cisalpino) primarily differs from the ETR 600 {{in the sense that the}} ETR 610 / RABe 503 supports the voltage and signalling systems used in Switzerland and Germany. This includes the need for much heavier on-board traction power transformers necessary as a result of the lower traction power frequency of 16.7 Hz used in Switzerland and Germany in comparison with those required for the 25 kV 50 Hz AC traction power supplies. The innovative features concern the interior and exterior design, now closer to the customers’ brand strategy and an improved comfort and services for passengers. Moreover, some important technical characteristics have been increased, such as the power of the <b>traction</b> <b>unit</b> and the level of redundancy of components and equipment, in order to improve reliability. The new trains will be produced in full accordance with the new regulations governing interoperability (for example, passive security in case of impact).|$|E
5000|$|Starting {{with the}} Mk4 {{generation}} A4-platform, the viscous coupling has been dropped {{in favour of}} a Haldex Traction electro-hydraulic limited-slip [...] "coupler" [...] (LSC) or clutch. The Haldex Traction LSC unit is not a differential and therefore cannot perform in the true sense like a differential. A Haldex <b>Traction</b> <b>unit</b> may divert up to a maximum 100% of the torque to the rear axle as conditions warrant. Many people are confused with the torque distribution on Haldex-based systems. Under normal operating conditions the Haldex clutch operates a rate of 5% torque transmission. Under adverse conditions where the car's road wheel speed sensors have determined that both front wheels have lost traction, the Haldex clutch can lock at 100% clamping force, meaning all torque is transferred to the rear axle. The torque split between left and right wheels is achieved with a conventional open differential. If {{one side of the}} driven axle loses grip, then the Electronic Differential Lock (EDL) component of the ESP controls this. EDL brakes a single spinning wheel; therefore, the torque gets transferred across the axle to the opposite wheel via the open differential. On all transverse engine cars with the Haldex-based four wheel drive system, the EDL only controls front wheels, and not the rear.|$|E
