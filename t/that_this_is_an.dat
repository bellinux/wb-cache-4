5|$|By {{the end of}} the series, events {{converge}} with accepted history, when King Richard IV and {{his entire}} family are poisoned, allowing Henry Tudor to take the throne as King Henry VII. He then rewrites history, presenting Richard III as a monster, and eliminating Richard IV's reign from the history books. In reality, Richard, Duke of York, one of the Princes in the Tower, was only twelve years old (and perhaps two years dead) when the Battle of Bosworth Field took place in 1485, and thus too young to have had two adult sons. One notable anachronism is Edmund´s title, Duke of Edinburgh, as Scotland was an independent kingdom ruled by a different royal house from its inception in the ninth century until 1603 (with the exception of some periods during the turmoil of the Scottish Wars of Independence) though given <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>an</b> alternate history, it is possible that Henry Tudor falsified the history of Scotland as well.|$|E
5|$|The only quagga to {{have been}} photographed alive was a mare at the Zoological Society of London's Zoo. Five {{photographs}} of this specimen are known, taken between 1863 and 1870. On the basis of photographs and written descriptions, many observers suggest that the stripes on the quagga were light on a dark background, unlike other zebras. Reinhold Rau, pioneer of the Quagga Project, claimed <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>an</b> optical illusion: that the base colour is a creamy white and that the stripes are thick and dark. Embryological evidence supports zebras being dark coloured with white as an addition.|$|E

25|$|Various {{methods have}} been used to {{identify}} imprinted genes. In swine, Bischoff et al. 2009 compared transcriptional profiles using short-oligonucleotide microarrays to survey differentially expressed genes between parthenotes (2 maternal genomes) and control fetuses (1 maternal, 1 paternal genome). An intriguing study surveying the transcriptome of murine brain tissues revealed over 1300 imprinted gene loci (approximately 10-fold more than previously reported) by RNA-sequencing from F1 hybrids resulting from reciprocal crosses. The result however has been challenged by others who claimed <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>an</b> overestimation by an order of magnitude due to flawed statistical analysis.|$|E
