25|$|CVR {{transcript}} contains {{details of}} extensive discussion amongst {{the crew members}} about the weather en route and over Kinshasa. First indication of Crew's realization {{of the presence of}} bad weather en route to Kinshasa was evident at 12:37, when the aircraft was between position GURUT and UDRID, over 100 NMs from Kinshasa. The crew got this indication through their on-board weather radar. At 12:38, the crew again discussed the weather when <b>the</b> <b>Captain</b> <b>said</b> that the (radar) beam was clearly showing the clouds. extended communication amongst the crew of extreme bad weather being present at and around Kinshasa and the way to avoid it, is heard on the CVR. The co-pilot exclaimed at 12:45 that the weather return being picked up on their radar was very big. Crew also discussed that the clouds were moving, so in next 10 minutes needed to reach the airfield, the clouds would have moved off the airfield. They also seemed to have a doubt whether the returns being picked up on the weather radar were ground echoes or were severe weather (Magenta) indications. The co-pilot confirmed that the returns were not ground echoes but were radar returns (Magenta) from very severe weather.|$|E
500|$|The {{crew was}} {{expected}} to contact air traffic control in Ho Chi Minh City as the aircraft passed into Vietnamese airspace, {{just north of the}} point where contact was lost. The captain of another aircraft attempted to reach the crew of Flight 370 [...] "just after [...] " [...] using the international distress frequency to relay Vietnamese air traffic control's request for the crew to contact them; <b>the</b> <b>captain</b> <b>said</b> he was able to establish contact, but only heard [...] "mumbling" [...] and static. Calls made to Flight 370's cockpit at 02:39 and 07:13 were unanswered but acknowledged by the aircraft's satellite data unit.|$|E
500|$|At 21:03:07, Flight 52 {{contacted}} the NY TRACON final controller who cleared them to descend progressively to [...] At 21:03:46, {{the flight crew}} discussed the go-around procedures. At 21:09:29, flight engineer Moyano stated that the controllers [...] "already {{know that we are}} in [...] bad condition." [...] <b>The</b> <b>captain</b> <b>said,</b> [...] "No they are descending us," [...] and the second officer added, [...] "They are giving us priority." [...] At 21:11:07, the NY TRACON final vector controller informed the flight that they were fifteen miles from the outer marker and instructed them to maintain an altitude of [...] "until established on the localizer." [...] The flight crew began preparing for an instrument landing approach, extending flaps and discussing the appropriate airspeed. The final controller instructed the flight crew to contact the JFK tower controllers and signed off. Klotz acknowledged the transmission.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, what {{think you}} of this business, Ned?" [...] one of <b>the</b> <b>captains</b> <b>said,</b> turning to <b>the</b> lad who was {{standing}} in a corner, remaining, as in duty bound, silent {{in the presence of}} his elders until addressed.|$|R
60|$|<b>The</b> <b>captain,</b> however, <b>said</b> {{that there}} would be no use in this being done.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{wonder you}} didn't think of pigs, O'Halloran," [...] one of <b>the</b> <b>captains</b> <b>said,</b> laughing, {{as they were}} talking over the farm in the mess anteroom; [...] "pigs and potatoes. The idea of you and Burke, both from the sod, {{starting}} a farm; and not thinking, first, of the two chief national products." ...|$|R
2500|$|<b>The</b> <b>captain</b> <b>said</b> that Costa Cruises {{managers}} {{told him}} to perform a sail-past salute on 13 January 2012. Previously, on 14 August 2011, the ship took a similar sail-past route, but not as close to Le Scole. The 14 August 2011 sail-past was approved by Costa Cruises and was done in daylight during an island festival. The normal shipping route passes about [...] offshore.|$|E
2500|$|Next day dawned {{fine and}} Peewit was {{scattered}} over , the leading ships {{with only the}} barrage balloon vessel HMS Borealis to guard against air attack. A Do17P from 4.(F)/14 {{had been sent to}} report on the convoy and found 17 vessels south of Selsey Bill, the Dornier was spotted and <b>the</b> <b>captain</b> <b>said</b> [...] "look, the angel of death". The Dornier reported the ships and Fliegerkorps VIII dispatched II. and II./StG 1 to attack the convoy.|$|E
2500|$|Mallow Racecourse, {{now known}} as Cork Racecourse, became an {{emergency}} airfield on 18 April 1983, when a Mexican Gulfstream II business jet piloted by Captain Reuben Ocaña made a precautionary landing. A temporary tarmacadam runway of 910 m (3,000ft) in length which was {{paid for by the}} plane's insurers was laid to enable the aircraft to leave five weeks later, whereas in the meantime Captain Ocaña became a local celebrity. On 23 May 1983 just before the plane departed, <b>the</b> <b>Captain</b> <b>said</b> his farewell to the people of Ireland in the Irish language. [...] The runway was subsequently utilised for parking during race meets and was a popular facility for learner driving. Light aircraft have occasionally landed at the racecourse on the grass area. The F3A World Model Aircraft Aerobatic Championship was held there in 2001. The 1983 incident formed the basis of the 2010 film The Runway.|$|E
60|$|Then Mr. Hart left him, but {{certainly}} did not believe a word <b>the</b> <b>captain</b> had <b>said</b> to him.|$|R
6000|$|... "Who {{would have}} thought of seeing a mere lad placed {{at the head of the}} {{regiment}} as colonel," [...] one of <b>the</b> <b>captains</b> <b>said.</b> [...] "I cannot imagine how such a thing can have come about, for certainly he can have no family influence. A newly raised regiment like ours wants a bright man, one that all can look up to and respect." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'You see I {{have made}} <b>the</b> <b>Captain</b> available,' <b>said</b> Claude, {{presently}} after meeting Lord Rotherwood, as he speeded across the lawn.|$|R
2500|$|E. Gorynov (another Tu-144 test pilot) {{stated that}} he is {{completely}} sure that usage of these experimental technologies was not decided by the crew. He also {{stated that he}} was 30 meters away from the aircraft before the test flight and overheard a discussion by the crew, where <b>the</b> <b>captain</b> <b>said</b> loudly: [...] "If {{we are going to}} die, then at least we will die all together." [...] This is further supported by the fact that after a meeting held in the evening before the flight, G. N. Bazhenov (the navigator on the flight) went to speak with E. Gorynov, who stated in the documentary that Bazhenov was very worried, and said the leadership had [...] "come up with something", but {{that he would not be}} able to disclose anything in detail. It was concluded in the documentary by the narrator that the flight crew was not at fault for the incident.|$|E
2500|$|At 15:00 {{steering}} was {{switched to}} manual mode since the autopilot {{could no longer}} be used and full engine power was required to maintain heading in such conditions. Herakles-Bulk was pushing the headwinds of [...] according to its own anemometer while barely maintaining a speed of [...] The electrical cables and fuel pipes connecting the pusher to the barge were unplugged to prevent them from being damaged or damaging the ship as the pusher pitched violently within the notch. At 15:30 the operational management of the shipping company inquired about the situation and it was decided that company would contact the maritime rescue co-ordination centre (MRCC) which, in turn, would later contact the ship. When MRCC Turku contacted Herakles-Bulk at 15:51, <b>the</b> <b>captain</b> <b>said</b> that he was not sure if the bow could be kept facing the wind. He then decided to send half of the crew off the ship because there would be a danger of the vessel capsizing if the combination turned broadside to the wind.|$|E
2500|$|During {{the last}} few seconds, the {{aircraft}} climbed to 3,090 feet. The Captain put in 52 degrees of bank to turn the aircraft, and also made some nose down inputs. Therefore, the aircraft pitched down, speed increased and auto thrust commanded the engines to spool down to keep airspeed on the target speed. The aircraft started to descend at a high rate. Unfortunately in his panic, the Captain continued to move the heading knob without actually looking at it, but failed to pull the knob to activate it. When he did activate it, the aircraft turned towards the heading knob that had been rotated too far, to 25 degrees, and stayed on that course until end of recording. At 04:40:49 <b>the</b> <b>Captain</b> <b>said</b> to the First Officer [...] "Why the aircraft is not turning left?" [...] The aircraft then slammed into Margala Hills and exploded. The First Officer's last words could be heard saying to the Captain [...] "Sir we are going down! Sir we are going do—".|$|E
6000|$|... "But, you see, doctor," [...] one of <b>the</b> <b>captains</b> <b>said,</b> [...] "Mrs. Humphreys {{has to be}} {{considered}} {{to a certain extent}} too. It is hard on Mrs. Clinton; but if she gets both boys she is certain at any rate that one of them is her son, and Mrs. Humphreys will, by that arrangement, have to lose her child altogether. That seems to me pretty rough on her." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Don't you?" [...] cried Tom; [...] "it's a fact notwithstandin', for <b>the</b> <b>captain</b> himself <b>said</b> so, and that's how I {{came to know}} it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But {{how about}} the two signallers?" [...] one of <b>the</b> other <b>captains</b> <b>said.</b> [...] "They would be left behind and might not get the chance of rejoining us again." ...|$|R
2500|$|At , the [...] "terrain ahead!" [...] warning again sounded on {{the flight}} deck. The crew {{continued}} the descent. According to MAK's report, at [...] (Decision Height) there was no [...] "landing" [...] or [...] "go-around" [...] call by the captain. If this happens, the first officer is supposed to overrule the captain, {{take control of the}} airplane, and initiate a go-around. Poland suggests that at this point <b>the</b> <b>captain</b> <b>said</b> [...] "Go around", and 8 seconds later the first officer confirmed by saying [...] "go around". (only the second of these two statements is recorded in the official transcripts by MAK; the first one may have been obscured by a simultaneous report by TAWS). Despite these calls, neither pilot initiated a go-around, and the descent continued. [...] One second after the 100 m altitude was reached, the TAWS alert [...] "PULL UP" [...] activated and continued to sound {{for the remainder of the}} flight. [...] "PULL UP" [...] only activates when the TAWS computer believes a collision with terrain is imminent. Therefore, when [...] "PULL UP" [...] sounds, the crew is supposed to begin an immediate, maximum performance emergency climb (full power and angle of attack to the maximum permissible without stalling) and continue climbing until the warning stops. However, the crew continued the descent. In a typical situation with an airport in the TAWS database, the [...] "PULL UP" [...] warning might not have sounded at this point. There is a method of setting up the TAWS to prevent false warnings when flying into airports not in the database, known as [...] "terrain inhibit" [...] mode; however, the crew did not utilize it. Even if they had, an excessive rate of descent and excessive airspeed can cause the TAWS to issue a [...] "SINK RATE" [...] warning followed by a [...] "PULL UP" [...] warning. This point (10:40:40 local time, approximately 20 seconds before the collision with terrain) is also notable because this was the moment when the aircraft had crossed the minimum allowed approach slope for this airport (2°10'). Prior to this moment, the radar controller had no reason to think that the landing attempt was not proceeding normally. The behavior of the controller was later the subject of some criticism by the Polish media. The controller remained silent for about 12 seconds after the aircraft passed the 100 m mark, and, even at that point, he did not order a go-around, but, rather issued an instruction to transit from a descent to a horizontal flight. (The decision to go around was apparently reached in the cabin of the aircraft within a few seconds of that instruction.) In addition, according to some interpretations of the radio exchange between the ground and the aircraft, the crew was instructed by the ground control to descend to [...] and either to wait for clearance to land or request one explicitly, or to inform the ground control regarding their decision whether to land or to go around. (According to MAK's report, it meant that the crew was supposed to inform the ground control of their decision to land before passing the decision altitude, and that the ground control was supposed to allow the landing as long as the runway and the airspace were clear.) None of this ever happened, with the aircraft continuing the descent through the 120 m mark while the ground control remained silent. It is unknown whether the crew really understood the ground control instruction (literally, [...] "landing additionally, 120, 3 m"), which was issued in Russian and used a relatively recent expression that was only codified in 2006.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oho!" [...] <b>the</b> <b>Captain</b> <b>said,</b> [...] "I see! And is {{she then}} so very strong?" [...] "She'd take your honour's scruff," [...] said he [...] "And pitch {{you over to}} Bolong!" [...] "I pardon you," [...] <b>the</b> <b>Captain</b> <b>said,</b> [...] "The fair BABETTE you needn't wed." ...|$|E
60|$|ELLIE. No. Only {{the last}} thing <b>the</b> <b>captain</b> <b>said</b> {{before he went to}} sleep.|$|E
6000|$|... "I am {{short of}} a midshipman, Sir Hyde," [...] one of <b>the</b> <b>captains</b> <b>said.</b> [...] "Poor little De Lisle fell {{overboard}} the night before last as we came round from Plymouth. He was {{about the size of}} this lad, and I'll arrange for him to have his togs. I like his look, and I should be glad to have him with me. I am sure he will be a credit to the service." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "This {{has been}} a close shave indeed, Mallett," [...] one of <b>the</b> other <b>captains</b> <b>said,</b> as a party of them sat round a fire. [...] "We won by a short head." ...|$|R
5000|$|In November 1797 <b>the</b> <b>Captain</b> of <b>said</b> company ( [...] Cpt Jose Manuel Ochoa) {{was ordered}} to leave St Pablo and asked to repopulate the town of Santa Rosalia.|$|R
60|$|<b>The</b> <b>captain</b> <b>said</b> no more. They {{turned their}} faces toward Aldborough, {{and walked slowly}} back.|$|E
60|$|Dick {{could not}} imagine why <b>the</b> <b>captain</b> <b>said</b> all this, and he flushed a little.|$|E
60|$|<b>The</b> <b>Captain</b> <b>said</b> this, {{as he said}} {{everything}} else, more than half through his nose, and very slowly.|$|E
60|$|What <b>the</b> Hornell <b>captain</b> <b>said</b> {{went from}} lip to lip {{throughout}} the club, {{and then it}} spread, like a flame in wind-blown grass, from club to dormitory, and thus over all the university.|$|R
60|$|When Edna Markham told Mrs. Cliff what <b>the</b> <b>captain</b> had <b>said</b> {{about their}} chances, {{and what he}} {{intended}} to do for their protection, the older woman brightened up a good deal.|$|R
60|$|This speech pleased <b>the</b> <b>captain,</b> and he <b>said</b> {{he would}} help them willingly.|$|R
6000|$|His {{retainer}} {{listened in}} silence, looking at Umslopogaas rather sulkily. Then {{we walked into}} the house. As we went <b>the</b> <b>Captain</b> <b>said,</b> ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Disappeared?" [...] cried Mr. Tredgold, in accents of unmistakable amazement. [...] "Why, wasn’t it burnt after all? <b>The</b> <b>captain</b> <b>said</b> it was." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "'Yes,' <b>the</b> <b>captain</b> <b>said,</b> 'I suppose so; that's {{the story}} {{each of the}} prisoners tells. How {{long have you been}} with them?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Cowardly dogs," [...] <b>the</b> young <b>captain</b> <b>said,</b> [...] "they do {{not mean}} to fight until the whole of their consorts come up. However, we ought not to grumble, as every hour takes us so much nearer port." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Good morning, gentlemen," [...] <b>the</b> young <b>captain</b> <b>said</b> gayly. [...] "We {{have a fine}} {{morning for}} our amusement. I wish the wind would freshen a little more so as to take this lubberly old ship faster through the water." ...|$|R
6000|$|An {{hour later}} <b>the</b> same <b>captain</b> <b>said</b> to his servant: [...] "Jenkins, I {{understand}} the picket have got a--got a newspaper off a prisoner to-day. I {{wish you could}} lay hands on it, Jenkins. Copy of the Times, I think." ...|$|R
