5|$|PlayStation 4 Slim (officially marketed {{simply as}} PlayStation 4 or PS4) was {{unveiled}} on September 7, 2016. It is {{a revision of}} the original PS4 hardware with a streamlined form factor. The new casing is 40% smaller, and carries a rounded body with a matte finish {{on the top of}} the console rather than a two-tone finish. The <b>two</b> <b>USB</b> <b>ports</b> on the front have a larger gap between them, and the optical audio port was also removed. It ships with a minor update to the DualShock 4 controller, with the light bar visible through the top of the touchpad and dark matte grey coloured exterior instead of a partially shiny black. The PS4 Slim was released on September 15, 2016, with a 500 GB model at the same price point as the original PS4 model. Its model number is CUH-2000.|$|E

(Units sold in South Korea and later revisions do not support GameCube discs.) The blue light in the disc slot illuminates briefly when the console is turned on, and pulses when new data is received through WiiConnect24. After the update (including System Menu 3.0), the disc-slot light activates whenever a Wii disc is inserted or ejected. When there is no WiiConnect24 information, the light stays off. The disc-slot light remains off during game play or when using other features. <b>Two</b> <b>USB</b> <b>ports</b> are located at its rear. An SD-card slot is located behind the cover on the {{front of the}} console.|$|E

25|$|The SingStar games require SingStar-branded microphonesone red and one bluewhich {{connect to}} the PlayStation console via a single USB {{converter}}. The USB converter was required so that both microphones would use a single USB port; the PlayStation 2 and later versions of the PlayStation 3 only have <b>two</b> <b>USB</b> <b>ports,</b> and the second port needed to remain free for camera functionality. The PlayStation 2 Headset was originally considered {{as an alternative to}} microphones, however the headset was not technically sufficient, and London Studio felt that handheld microphones were important to the authentic experience.|$|E
25|$|The PS3 {{supports}} numerous SDTV and HDTV resolutions (from 480i/576i up to 1080p) and connectivity options (such as HDMI 1.3a and component video). In {{terms of}} audio, the PS3 supports {{a number of}} formats, including 7.1 digital audio, Dolby TrueHD, DTS-HD Master Audio and others; audio output is possible over stereo RCA cables (analog), optical digital cables, or HDMI. The PS3 slim features an upgraded HDMI chip that allows bitstreaming of lossless audio codecs to an external receiver (earlier versions had to decode the signal internally before outputting it via LPCM). For the optical disc drive, {{a wide variety of}} DVD and CD formats are supported, as well as Blu-ray Discs. A 20, 40, 60, 80, 120, 160, 250, 320, or 500GB 2.5-inch SATA 150 hard disk is preinstalled. In the early 60GB and 80GB configurations, flash memory can also be used, either Memory Sticks; CompactFlash cards; or SD/MMC cards. All models support USB memory devices; flash drives and external hard drives are both automatically recognized. However, they must be formatted with the FAT32 file system. For communication, the system sported four USB 2.0 ports at the front on the 20 and 60GB models as well as the NTSC 80GB model, but the 40GB and 80GB PAL models only have <b>two</b> <b>USB</b> <b>ports.</b> All models (80 and 160GB) released after August 2008 have been reduced to <b>two</b> <b>USB</b> <b>ports,</b> as well as dropping CompactFlash and SD card support.

This updated Revision B model maintained its predecessor's original price of $1299. The iMac had its infrared and mezzanine features removed {{with the introduction of}} the Revision C model on January 5, 1999, dropping in price to US$1199.

2500|$|In 1998, Apple {{introduced}} its new iMac which, like the original 128K Mac, was an all-in-one computer. Its translucent plastic case, originally Bondi blue and later various additional colors, {{is considered an}} industrial design landmark of the late 1990s. The iMac did away with most of Apple's standard (and usually proprietary) connections, such as SCSI and ADB, in favor of <b>two</b> <b>USB</b> <b>ports.</b> It replaced a floppy disk drive with a CD-ROM drive for installing software, but was incapable of writing to CDs or other media without external third-party hardware. The iMac proved to be phenomenally successful, with 800,000 units sold in 139 days. It made the company an annual profit of US$309million, Apple's first profitable year since Michael Spindler took over as CEO in 1995. This aesthetic {{was applied to the}} Power Macintosh and later the iBook, Apple's first consumer-level laptop computer, filling the missing quadrant of Apple's [...] "four-square product matrix" [...] (desktop and portable products for both consumers and professionals). More than 140,000 pre-orders were placed before it started shipping in September, and by October proved to be a large success.|$|E
