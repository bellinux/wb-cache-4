5|$|Dylan's lyrics {{incorporate}} {{a wide range}} of political, social, philosophical, and literary influences. <b>They</b> <b>defied</b> existing pop music conventions and appealed to the burgeoning counterculture. Initially inspired by the performances of Little Richard and the songwriting of Woody Guthrie, Robert Johnson, and Hank Williams, Dylan has amplified and personalized musical genres. His recording career, spanning more than 50 years, has explored the traditions in American song—from folk, blues, and country to gospel, rock and roll, and rockabilly to English, Scottish, and Irish folk music, embracing even jazz and the Great American Songbook. Dylan performs with guitar, keyboards, and harmonica. Backed by a changing lineup of musicians, he has toured steadily since the late 1980s on what has been dubbed the Never Ending Tour. His accomplishments as a recording artist and performer have been central to his career, but his songwriting is considered his greatest contribution. Since 1994, Dylan has also published seven books of drawings and paintings, and his work has been exhibited in major art galleries.|$|E
5|$|When the Southern Pawnees {{arrived in}} Nebraska, the Skidis were not {{pleased to see}} them on lands that they {{regarded}} as their own. Nevertheless, they were willing to accept them as neighbors, so long as they kept to {{the south side of the}} Platte. However, the Chaui leaders demanded that they be recognized as the heads of the entire Pawnee people, above the Skidi chiefs. <b>They</b> <b>defied</b> the Skidis by sending a large hunting party to Prairie Creek, on the north side of the Platte within sight of the Skidi villages on the Loup. The Skidis responded by attacking the Chaui hunters and driving them back across the Platte. The Chauis and Pitahawiratas resolved on war, and summoned the Kitkehahki fighters to join them against the Skidis; the Kitkehahkis, unwilling to leave their people unprotected against Skidi raids, left the Republican and moved to the Platte near the other bands.|$|E

Hearts provided the opposition in Hibs' first match on Christmas Day 1875, which Hearts won 1–0. The persistence of Canon Hannan and Whelahan meant that Hibs were eventually accepted by the governing bodies.|$|E
25|$|Overall, the {{documents}} that Nathan of Gaza produced and presented were both positively and negatively received by the Jewish community. Some of the rabbis in Jerusalem, for example, were divided over the ideas that Nathan of Gaza wrote. A number of them felt that these written records were sacrilegious; <b>they</b> <b>defied</b> the basic tenets of the Jewish faith. Nevertheless, the composition of these texts provided for a further platform in which Shabbetai Zevi and Nathan of Gaza could promote their Sabbatean ideologies.|$|E

His most memorable contributions came in the club's glorious 1974–75 season, when <b>they</b> <b>defied</b> all expectations to face Aston Villa in the Football League Cup semi–finals. Trailing 4–2 on aggregate in the second leg, Mason scored a stunning goal to give Chester hope in a tie they eventually lost 5–4. Later in the season he scored the winner {{on the final day of}} the season at Crewe Alexandra that ultimately secured promotion from Division Four for Chester and ensured he would forever hold hero status with supporters. Two years later Mason scored in Chester's 4–1 second leg win over Port Vale to help the club win the Debenhams Cup, their first national English trophy.|$|E

25|$|Owing to the Ottoman Empire's {{expansion}} into Hungarian territory, Bratislava was designated the new capital of Hungary in 1536, {{ahead of the}} old Hungarian capital of Buda falling in 1541. It {{become part of the}} Austrian Habsburg monarchy, marking {{the beginning of a new}} era. The territory comprising modern Slovakia, then known as Upper Hungary, became the place of settlement for nearly two-thirds of the Magyar nobility fleeing the Turks and far more linguistically and culturally Hungarian than it was before. Partly thanks to old Hussite families, and Slovaks studying under Martin Luther, the region then experienced a growth in Protestants. For a short period in the 17th century, most Slovaks were Lutherans. <b>They</b> <b>defied</b> the Catholic Habsburgs and sought protection from neighboring Transylvania, a rival continuation of the Magyar state that practiced religious tolerance and normally had Ottoman backing. Upper Hungary, modern Slovakia, became the site of frequent border wars and changes to the frontier, which was on a constant state of military alert and heavily fortified by castles and citadels often manned by German and Italian troops on the Habsburg side. The Ottoman wars, rivalry between Austria and Transylvania, and the frequent insurrections against the Habsburg Monarchy inflicted a great deal of devastation, especially in the rural areas. In the Austro-Turkish War (1663–1664) a Turkish army led by the Grand Vizier decimated Slovakia. Even so, Slovaks from the Principality of Upper Hungary fought alongside the Turks against the Austrians at the Battle of Vienna of 1683. As the Turks withdrew from Hungary in the late 17th century, the importance of the territory comprising modern Slovakia decreased, although Pressburg retained its status as the capital of Hungary until 1848, when it was transferred back to Buda.|$|E

2500|$|Butler {{died in the}} Fall of 1786, {{leaving his}} estate to his wife, Anne.

[...] Caruthers made the claim that officers under Butler's command, particularly Colonel Robert Mebane, were justified in several incidents of insubordination in which <b>they</b> <b>defied</b> Butler's orders to retreat.

2500|$|The Mongol Empire was {{governed by}} a code of law devised by Genghis, called Yassa, meaning [...] "order" [...] or [...] "decree". A {{particular}} canon of this code was that those of rank shared {{much of the same}} hardship as the common man. It also imposed severe penalties — e.g., the death penalty was decreed if one mounted soldier following another did not pick up something dropped from the mount in front. Penalties were also decreed for rape and to some extent for murder. Any resistance to Mongol rule was met with massive collective punishment. Cities were destroyed and their inhabitants slaughtered if <b>they</b> <b>defied</b> Mongol orders.|$|E
2500|$|The use of {{the term}} coincided with a fashion among teenage girls in the United States in the early 1920s for wearing unbuckled galoshes, and a {{widespread}} false etymology held that they were called [...] "flappers" [...] because they flapped when they walked, as they wore their overshoes or galoshes unfastened, showing that <b>they</b> <b>defied</b> convention {{in a manner similar to}} the 21st century fad for untied shoelaces. Another suggestion to the origin of the term, in relation to fashion, comes from a 1920s fashion trend in which young women left their overcoat unbuttoned to allow it to flap back and forth as they walked, appearing more independent and freed from the tight, Victorian Era style clothing.|$|E

2500|$|Brazilian elite {{culture was}} {{originally}} {{strongly tied to}} Portugal. Gradually writers developed a multi-ethnic body of work that was distinctively Brazilian. The presence {{of large numbers of}} former slaves added a distinctive African character to the culture. Subsequent infusions of immigrants of non-Portuguese origin broadened the range of influences. Mário de Andrade and Oswald de Andrade were the prototypical modernists. With the urban poems of [...] "Paulicéia Desvairada" [...] and [...] "Carefree Paulistan land" [...] (1922), Mário de Andrade established the movement in Brazil. His rhapsodic novel Macunaíma (1928), with its abundance of Brazilian folklore, represents the apex of modernism's nationalist prose through its creation of an offbeat native national hero. Oswald de Andrade's experimental poetry, avant-garde prose, particularly the novel Serafim Ponte Grande (1933) and provocative manifestos exemplify the movement's break with tradition. Modernist artists and writers chose the Municipal Theatre of São Paulo to launch their Modernist manifesto. The site happened to be a bastion of European culture with opera and classical music presentations from Germany, France, Austria and Italy. <b>They</b> <b>defied</b> the high society that frequented the venue and who insisted on speaking only foreign languages such as French, behaving as if Brazilian culture did not matter.|$|E

In the 1988 final <b>they</b> <b>defied</b> all odds by beating Western Province and drew with Province again in 1989 at Newlands. This was the one finals victory that has always eluded the team and to this day The Bulls have never managed to win a final at Newlands against their greatest rivals. They were runners-up to the Sharks in the 1990 final at Loftus but won the cup back in 1991 by defeating Transvaal. Northerns, Province and Free State ended tied second after Transvaal on the 1991 Currie Cup log. Due to points difference, Province and Northerns had to slug it out in a first semi-final on a Tuesday afternoon and managed to do so by winning 34-21. On the Saturday they had to play Free State in the second semi-final and after trailing at one stage 11-0 {{in the first half and}} with about 20 minutes to go by 20-9, they managed to turn around the match and run out victors 27-23 - fullback (and old Grey College learner) Gerbrand Grobler being the hero with 6 penalties and a conversion!
