50|$|With the {{adoption}} of the Restriction of Hazardous Substances Directive (RoHS) regulations in Europe, and similar regulations elsewhere, traditional lead/tin solder alloys in electronic devices have been replaced by nearly pure tin, introducing <b>tin</b> <b>pest</b> and related problems such as tin whiskers.|$|E
50|$|With the {{adoption}} of the Restriction of Hazardous Substances Directive (RoHS) regulations in Europe and California banning most uses of lead, and similar regulations elsewhere, the problem of <b>tin</b> <b>pest</b> has returned, since some manufacturers who previously used tin/lead alloys, now use pure tin. For example, the leads of some electrical and electronic components are plated with pure tin. In cold environments, this can change to α-modification grey tin, which is not electrically conductive, and falls off the leads. After reheating, it changes back to β-modification white tin, which is electrically conductive, and can cause electrical short circuits and failure of equipment. Such problems can be intermittent as the powdered particles of tin move around. <b>Tin</b> <b>pest</b> can be avoided by alloying with small amounts of electropositive metals or semimetals soluble in tin's solid phase e.g. antimony or bismuth, which prevent the decomposition.|$|E
50|$|Tin has two allotropes: α-tin, {{also known}} as gray tin, and β-tin. Tin is {{typically}} found in the β-tin form, a silvery metal. However, at standard pressure, β-tin converts to α-tin, a gray powder, at temperatures below 13.2° Celsius/56° Fahrenheit. This can cause tin objects in cold temperatures to crumble to gray powder in {{a process known as}} <b>tin</b> <b>pest</b> or tin rot.|$|E

5000|$|The {{story is}} often told of Napoleon's men {{freezing}} in the bitter Russian Winter, their clothes falling apart as <b>tin</b> <b>pest</b> ate the buttons. This clearly {{appears to be}} an urban legend, and {{there is no evidence that}} there existed any failing buttons at all, and thus they cannot have been a contributing factor in the failure of the invasion. [...] Critics of the theory point out that the tin used would have been quite impure and thus more tolerant of low temperatures. Laboratory tests provide evidence that the time required for unalloyed tin to develop significant <b>tin</b> <b>pest</b> damage at lowered temperatures is about 18 months, which is more than twice the length of the invasion. It is clear though that some of the regiments employed in the campaign had tin buttons and that the temperature reached sufficiently low values (at least -40 °C). [...] However, none of the many survivors' tales mention problems with buttons and it has been suggested that the legend is an amalgamation of a case of disintegrating Russian tin buttons in an army warehouse in the 1860s [...] and the utterly desperate state of Napoleon's army turning soldiers into ragged beggars.|$|E
50|$|At 13.2 °C (about 56 °F) and below, {{pure tin}} {{transforms}} from the silvery, ductile metallic allotrope of β-form white tin to brittle, nonmetallic, α-form grey tin with a diamond cubic structure. The transformation is slow to initiate {{due to a}} high activation energy but the presence of germanium (or crystal structures of similar form and size) or very low temperatures of roughly −30 °C aids the initiation. There is also a large volume increase of about 27% associated with the phase change to the nonmetallic low temperature allotrope. This frequently makes tin objects (like buttons) decompose into powder during the transformation, hence the name <b>tin</b> <b>pest.</b>|$|E
50|$|Allotropes are {{different}} structural {{forms of the}} same element and can exhibit quite different physical properties and chemical behaviours. The change between allotropic forms is triggered by the same forces that affect other structures, i.e. pressure, light, and temperature. Therefore, {{the stability of the}} particular allotropes depends on particular conditions. For instance, iron changes from a body-centered cubic structure (ferrite) to a face-centered cubic structure (austenite) above 906 °C, and tin undergoes a modification known as <b>tin</b> <b>pest</b> from a metallic form to a semiconductor form below 13.2 °C (55.8 °F). As an example of allotropes having different chemical behaviour, ozone (O3) is a much stronger oxidizing agent than dioxygen (O2).|$|E
5000|$|In 1910 British polar {{explorer}} Robert Scott {{hoped to}} be the first to reach the South Pole, but was beaten by Norwegian explorer Roald Amundsen.

50|$|Another {{claim is}} from the slang name during the age of sail of the bronze {{brackets}} supporting the correcting spheres of soft iron {{on both sides of}} a wooden binnacle containing a magnetic compass on a steel ship. The brackets are slotted so that the compass adjustor can accurately compensate for the magnetic effects of the hull. Bronze is used because it is non-magnetic and not subject to de-zincification like brass. Bronze is an alloy of copper and tin and the latter can be subject to <b>tin</b> <b>pest</b> at very low temperatures. This would tend to weaken the bronze, particularly at the edged of the adjusting slots, allowing the correcting sphere(s) to fall off.|$|E
50|$|Tin {{has long}} been used in alloys with lead as solder, in amounts 5 to 70% w/w. Tin forms a {{eutectic}} mixture with lead in the proportion 63% tin and 37% lead. Such solders are primarily used for joining pipes or electric circuits. Since the European Union Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment Directive (WEEE Directive) and Restriction of Hazardous Substances Directive came into effect on 1 July 2006, the lead content in such alloys has decreased. Replacing lead has many problems, including a higher melting point, {{and the formation of}} tin whiskers causing electrical problems. <b>Tin</b> <b>pest</b> can occur in lead-free solders, leading to loss of the soldered joint. Replacement alloys are rapidly being found, although problems of joint integrity remain.|$|E

However, a number of problems have plagued the study of ancient tin such as the limited archaeological remains of placer mining, the destruction of ancient mines by modern mining operations, and the poor preservation of pure tin objects due to tin disease or <b>tin</b> <b>pest.</b> These problems are compounded by the difficulty in provenancing tin objects and ores to their geological deposits using isotopic or trace element analyses.

50|$|The fibula is a {{multilayered}} structure. Its face {{consists of}} a very thin fire gilded and contoured silver disc, having a diameter of 58 mm. This is fixed by three silver rivet pins to an identically sized, 3 mm thick copper plate and together with this on a stronger silver plate. The rear plate, 78 mm in diameter, is significantly larger. On its rear, the pin was mounted. The reverse of the front plate {{was filled with a}} now whitish green mix of tin, lead and traces of copper in order to support the sensitive friction work and to prevent the pressing of the driven ornaments. But the tin components of the filler have damaged some of the metal parts of the decoration due to allotropic processes forced by low temperatures during long term storage in the soil (<b>tin</b> <b>pest).</b> The decoration {{consists of a}} quadrupedal animal walking to the right, with the animals head facing backwards. It has two ears and a protruding tongue. Around its neck it wears a collar shaped ornament. The legs are positioned under the body to accommodate the round shape of the disc. The background is decorated with irregularly distributed impressions, imitating a granulation. The scene is framed by two ribbed bands, which are enclosed by an ornamental wreath and another ribbed band. Around the body of the animal there are three rosette shaped rivet heads. The body of the animal has a large defect caused by the degenerated tin filling. Some of the protruding edges of the rear mounting plate are broken away. Beneath the copper plate, residual amounts of organic material were found, which were interpreted as ivory. Due to typological comparisons of the ornaments, the fibula was dated to circa 300 AD.|$|E
40|$|<b>Tin</b> <b>pest</b> is {{the product}} of the β → α {{allotropic}} transition at 13. 2 C in pure tin. It is a brittle crumbly material, often responsible for the total disintegration of the sample. The transformation involves nucleation and growth, with an incubation period requiring months or years for completion. Experimental observations reveal a substantial inconsistency and an incomplete understanding of the process. Some alloy additions promote <b>tin</b> <b>pest</b> by reducing the incubation time, whereas others retard or inhibit its formation. Traditional solder alloys have generally been immune to <b>tin</b> <b>pest</b> in service due to the presence of lead, and bismuth and antimony as common impurities. However, the new generation of lead-free solders are more dilute—closely resembling tin. A much debated question is the susceptibility of these alloys to <b>tin</b> <b>pest.</b> Bulk samples of tin- 0. 5 copper solder undergo the transition at − 18 C although not at − 40 C after five years exposure. Other lead-free alloys (Sn– 3. 5 Ag, Sn– 3. 8 Cu– 0. 7 Cu and Sn–Zn–Bi) are immune from <b>tin</b> <b>pest</b> after a similar period. Large scale model joints exhibit <b>tin</b> <b>pest</b> but it appears that actual joints may be resistant due to the limited free solder surface available and the constraint of intermetallic compounds and components. It seems likely that impurities are essential protection against <b>tin</b> <b>pest,</b> but for long term applications there is no certainty that <b>tin</b> <b>pest</b> and joint deterioration will never occur...|$|E
40|$|Purpose - To {{review the}} literatures, and to {{consider}} the latest results regarding the formation of <b>tin</b> <b>pest</b> in lead-free solders and interconnections. Design/methodology/approach - Previous work, over almost a century, on <b>tin</b> <b>pest</b> formation in tin and its alloy has been critically analysed. Samples of {{the new generation of}} lead-free solders, which have experienced long term storage at - 18 and - 40 degrees C, have been examined. Findings - <b>Tin</b> <b>pest</b> has been observed in bulk samples of tin - 0. 5 (wt%) copper solder after exposure at - 18 degrees C although not at - 40 degrees C. Other leadfree alloys (Sn- 3. 5 Ag, Sn- 3. 8 Cu- 0. 7 Cu and Sn-Zn-Bi) have been immune to date. Large-scale model joints exhibit <b>tin</b> <b>pest</b> but actual joints may be resistant due to the limited free solder surface available and the constraint of intermetallic compounds and components. Research limitations/implications - The possibility of <b>tin</b> <b>pest</b> formation in joints remains. It seems that impurities are essential protection against it, but for long term applications there is no certainty that <b>tin</b> <b>pest</b> and joint deterioration will never occur. Originality/value - The paper considers the various factors that may affect <b>tin</b> <b>pest</b> formation and demonstrates its existence in one of the more popular new lead-free alloys...|$|E
40|$|The {{phenomenon}} of <b>tin</b> <b>pest</b> {{has been known}} for hundreds of years. It was observed in pewter in the 18 th century. There is even historic debate {{as to whether or not}} <b>tin</b> <b>pest</b> destroyed the buttons on Napoleon’s army on its disastrous return from Russia in the early 19 th century. <b>Tin</b> <b>pest</b> can occur in some high tin-bearing alloys at temperatures below 13 oC. The “normal ” white (beta) tin, with a density of 7. 31 g/cm 2, is slowly converted into gray (alpha) tin with a much lower density of 5. 77 g/cm 2. This transformation and resulting expansion causes the tin to essentially crumble as shown in the photos below...|$|E
40|$|<b>Tin</b> <b>pest</b> (the {{product of}} the {{allotropic}} transformation of β-tin into α-tin at temperatures below 286 K) has been observed in a Sn- 0. 5 wt. % Cu solder alloy. Some 40 percent of the specimen surface was transformed into gray tin after aging at 255 K for 1. 5 years, and after 1. 8 years, the proportion increased to about 70 percent. The degree of transformation in work-hardened areas {{is much higher than}} in other areas, suggesting residual stress might provide an additional driving force for the transformation into α-tin. The allotropic change results in a 26 percent increase in volume, and cracks are initiated to accommodate the changes in volume. Results indicate that <b>tin</b> <b>pest</b> could lead to total disintegration of micro-electronic solder joints. The tin-copper eutectic system may become a prominent lead-free solder, and <b>tin</b> <b>pest</b> could have major ramifications on service lifetime of electronic assemblies...|$|E
40|$|The {{most recent}} {{observations}} of the response of bulk samples of several lead-free solder alloys, exposed to temperatures below the allotropic transition for tin for extended periods, are reported. <b>Tin</b> <b>pest</b> has been observed in Sn- 0. 5 Cu, Sn- 3. 5 Ag, Sn- 3. 8 Ag- 0. 7 Cu, and Sn- 3. 0 Ag- 0. 5 Cu alloys at both - 18 degrees C and - 40 degrees C. The process is slow and inconsistent, usually requiring several years, but may eventually result in complete disintegration of the sample. No <b>tin</b> <b>pest</b> was detected in Sn-Zn- 3 Bi or in the traditional Sn- 37 Pb solder alloy after exposure for up to 4 and 10 years, respectively. It is suggested that nucleation is affected by local composition and that extremely small amounts of either intentional solute or impurity are influential. Growth of <b>tin</b> <b>pest</b> {{is accompanied by a}} large volume change, and it is likely that stress relaxation ahead of the expanding grey tin front is a controlling factor. A stronger matrix would be more resistant in this case, and at the temperatures of exposure Sn- 37 Pb is stronger than either Sn- 3. 5 Ag or Sn- 0. 5 Cu. The absence of <b>tin</b> <b>pest,</b> to date, on actual joints is attributed to their restricted free surface area and the greater strength associated with very small samples...|$|E

40|$|Management of used {{electrical}} and electronic equipment (EEE) {{is becoming a}} major issue as each year around 20 to 50 million tonnes of electronic waste (e-waste) is generated worldwide. EEE contains over 1000 materials of which lead (Pb) {{has been one of the}} targets of the regulators forcing manufacturers to adopt lead free products. Industry has come up with several lead free solders with preference given to alloys containing tin, silver, and copper but there is no,drop-in' substitute to leaded solder. Issues with lead free solders such as temperature, intermetallics, tin whisker, <b>tin</b> <b>pest,</b> and reliability are yet to be resolved. The paper investigated the contribution of lead free soldering to green electronics in a holistic way. Global lead free movement has reached a point of no return.

40|$|Tin-rich organ pipes {{are often}} {{affected}} by localised {{deterioration in the}} form of grey pustules, pinholes, cracks and exfoliations at the surface. Two main types of decay of tin-base materials that might have a similar appearance, i. e. the surface of the object covered with dark grey pustules, are known. The first is the allotropic transformation of white metallic tin into grey tin, the so-called tin-pest The second form of decay is due to corrosion {{in the form of}} localised oxidation of tin. The identification of the causes of deterioration is of main concern because, whereas oxidised material can be treated, an object that suffers <b>tin</b> <b>pest</b> cannot be reconstituted. In the present paper the results of investigations on ancient tin-rich organ pipes affected by localised degradation are presented. The study of the composition and the microstructure of the pipes has been coupled with the results of analyses on the corrosion products.

40|$|Abundant data {{exist on}} the {{short-term}} reliability (i. e. less than 5 years) of lead-free solder joints under single loading conditions. Data on combined loading conditions and long-term reliability is scarce. The lead-free electronics will be deployed in many products that serve markets where long-term (greater than 5 years) is a critical requirement. In many applications, electronics will be subjected to long-term exposure to temperature extremes (high and low), humidity, atmospheric contaminants, and combined thermo-mechanical loading (temperature cycling and vibrations). To assess long-term reliability, an experimental plan includes assessing the interactions among the applications conditions. The interacting influences include the growth of intermetallics at the solder joints due to high temperature exposure, electro-chemical degradation of electronics assemblies due to the exposure to humidity and atmospheric contaminants, formation of <b>tin</b> <b>pest</b> due to extended exposure to low temperature {{and the effects of}} combined thermo-mechanical loading conditions on the electronics assemblies.
