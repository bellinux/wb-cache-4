500|$|Though {{critics have}} pointed out the song's {{similarities}} {{to some of the}} hits by the Police, Mars told MTV News that he did not intend to write anything mimicking by the Sting-fronted band. Instead, it came to him out of the blue, one night during his studio sessions prior to recording the Unorthodox Jukebox album. [...] "I don't think it initially <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>sound</b> like anybody else, but I picked up the guitar and just started playing ," [...] Mars explained. [...] "That's how it normally works; I'll pick up a guitar and I'll start humming a melody, and I started singing that, and I was up there in Sting-ville, in that register, so that's what you get...". John Marx, a partner in the music division at William Morris Endeavor (WME), who was responsible for managing the Moonshine Jungle Tour said [...] "it's the type of song that really motivates people to purchase a ticket. It has that live element to it; it was a very active track".|$|E
500|$|Writing for iVillage, Donna Kaufman praised will.i.am and Spears on the video, {{saying that}} the latter [...] "looks like the pop star of the future," [...] while Daily Mails Chelsea White wrote that Spears [...] "looks like a re-imaging of a Versace model from the 1990s albeit one from space." [...] Erin Strecker of Entertainment Weekly wrote that Spears' style on the video is similar to her [...] "Stronger" [...] (2000) music video and that will.i.am, [...] "for his part, does his best to get {{it started with a}} KING crown and plenty of {{technological}} devises, before performing some futuristic slow-mo running and watching approvingly as the back-up dancers party on." [...] Yahoo! Music blogger Wendy Geller wrote that Spears' accent on the song was [...] "terrible", that [...] "her physique is looking undeniably good" [...] on the video, and that Spears [...] "is looking to be in a much, much healthier place than she was the last time she <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>sound</b> all cockney. So she gets a pass in our book." [...] Sadao Turner of RyanSeacrest.com said that the video looked like a Sharper Image Catalog coming to life in a nightclub, and T. Kyle of MTV Buzzworthy wrote that [...] "Scream & Shout' is pure fire, and Britney's parts in the video are...very cool and amazing".|$|E
2500|$|As a young guitarist, Metheny <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>sound</b> like Wes Montgomery, {{but when}} he was 14 or 15, he decided it was disrespectful to imitate him. In the liner notes on the 2-disc Montgomery {{compilation}} Impressions: The Verve Jazz Sides, Metheny is quoted as saying, [...] "Smokin' at the Half Note is the absolute greatest jazz-guitar album ever made. It is also the record that taught me how to play." ...|$|E
5000|$|Composer Jeff Lynne {{described}} {{writing the}} song in a 1990 radio interview with Roger Scott:"So Fine's a bouncy little (number). I really don't know much about it. It's just that I wrote it and sang the thing. And um- I suppose it was {{along the lines of}} a - like an American, <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>sound</b> like an American style. Maybe like The Doobie Brothers or something, y'know, <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>sound</b> a bit like an American group with harmonies. I wasn't <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> copy 'em, but it was... it was sort of bouncy American style with a wobbly bit on the top." [...] Jeff Lynne (August 21, 1990 - Classic Albums radio interview by Roger Scott) ...|$|R
5000|$|AllMusic critic William Ruhlmann {{said that}} [...] "on 'Because I Love You,' {{they sound like}} the Raspberries <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>sound</b> like the Beatles." [...] Despite this comment, he still cited the song as a {{highlight}} from the Say No More album.|$|R
5000|$|While Roger Burnley {{believes}} all {{of those}} divas to be oversingers in their own right, vocal coach, Chrys Page argues the opposite. [...] "They don't oversing, but some young hopefuls, <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>sound</b> exactly like those artists, consistently {{do it because they}} haven't yet found their own voice and style," [...] she said.|$|R
6000|$|Before {{she sent}} it she held council with her father. She {{sat on the}} foot of his bed and <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>sound</b> dutiful. [...] "I don't want to do {{anything}} that's bad for you, daddy. But isn't it taking your mind away from business?" ...|$|E
6000|$|Concurrently {{with these}} {{insidious}} speculations Lady Harman found herself {{trying to imagine}} how one sold jewels. She <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>sound</b> Peters by taking up {{the story of the}} necklace again. But Peters was uninforming. [...] "But where," [...] asked Lady Harman, [...] "could such a thing be done?" ...|$|E
6000|$|Paul <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>sound</b> his shining eyes; {{the strange}} {{thing was that}} he seemed sincere--not a mocking fiend. He turned away, and {{as he did so}} heard the Master say {{something}} about his giving them all the proof, being the joy of his old age. He faced him again, taking another look. [...] "Do you mean to say you've stopped writing?" ...|$|E

Black Horse recalls Bufan’s encounter and deduces that the latter has contracted aids. He <b>tries</b> <b>to</b> <b>sound</b> the latter out and seeing Bufan’s secretiveness, starts to avoid him.|$|R
5000|$|Rusty {{is often}} seen to wear his {{drumming}} influences on his sleeve. In a Triple J radio J File interview he comments [...] "I <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>sound</b> like three different drummers in every song laughs", citing Ian Paice of Deep Purple as a key influence. Other sixties and seventies influences referenced include the Super Stocks, The Pretty Things, The Honeycombs and the Who.|$|R
5000|$|Early {{in their}} career {{a number of}} reviewers dubbed their sound [...] "jamtronic" [...] for its blend of jam and {{electronic}} music, but the band rejected the label for being inaccurate. According to Godchaux, [...] "Jamtronic, to me, is jam bands <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>sound</b> like a DJ. We {{think of ourselves as}} just one DJ. Bands already have their songs, they have their sets. A DJ is <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> make the party happen." ...|$|R
6000|$|She {{backed off}} and <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>sound</b> {{as if it}} hadn't happened, but she was quavery: [...] "I can't believe it! It's too ridiculously {{wonderful}} to see you!" [...] She retreated toward the Barmberry porch, Jeff following, his two hands out. They came {{within the range of}} the house lights, and Mr. Boltwood hailed, [...] "Ah! Geoffrey! Never had such a surprise--nor a more delightful one!" ...|$|E
6000|$|If Howard {{had come}} home before midnight it is {{possible}} that she might have <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>sound</b> him as to his relations with Trixton Brent. That gentleman, she remembered, had the reputation of being a peculiarly hardheaded business man, and it was of course absurd that he should offer her husband a position merely to please her. And her imagination failed her when she tried to think of Howard as the president of a trust company. She was unable to picture him in a great executive office: ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Of course I do! I just meant--" [...] Remembering that Paul Riesling had {{predicted}} this, {{he was as}} desperate as she. [...] "I mean, sometimes it's {{a good thing for}} an old grouch like me to go off and get it out of his system." [...] He <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>sound</b> paternal. [...] "Then when you and the kids arrive--I figured maybe I might skip up to Maine just a few days ahead of you--I'd be ready for a real bat, see how I mean?" [...] He coaxed her with large booming sounds, with affable smiles, like a popular preacher blessing an Easter congregation, like a humorous lecturer completing his stint of eloquence, like all perpetrators of masculine wiles.|$|E
50|$|When the Royal Trumpeter <b>tries</b> <b>to</b> <b>sound</b> the alarm, Oobleck {{gets into}} the trumpet and the trumpeter gets his hand stuck <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> remove the Oobleck. When Bartholomew <b>tries</b> <b>to</b> tell the Captain of the Guard to warn the kingdom, the captain <b>tries</b> <b>to</b> prove that he's not afraid by {{scooping}} some Oobleck up with his sword and eating it, only to get his mouth stuck and breathe out green bubbles. Bartholomew <b>tries</b> <b>to</b> go to the Royal Stables for a horse to warn the kingdom on his own, but they are covered in Oobleck.|$|R

He is very strong, however, and knows many things and has even medical {{knowledge}} {{to the extent that}} he can stitch a wound back together perfectly. He gives himself the nickname [...] "Mon-Mon", and <b>tries</b> <b>to</b> <b>sound</b> cute. This usually means he isn't taken seriously. Voiced by Tetsu Inada ...|$|R
5000|$|Whereas Waters {{is known}} for {{recording}} all studio guitar and bass for Annihilator records himself, Waters said of this album: [...] "This {{was one of the}} coolest things I have done in my long career. Having five people in a room, from all different backgrounds and talents, coming together to play songs from the past and <b>to</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>sound</b> like we are one but totally live." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'He <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>sound</b> {{my thought}} with an {{attentive}} glance dropped {{on me in}} passing. [...] "Do {{you mean to say}} you had been deliberating with yourself whether you would die?" [...] I asked in as impenetrable a tone as I could command. He nodded without stopping. [...] "Yes, it had come to that as I sat there alone," [...] he said. He passed on a few steps to the imaginary end of his beat, and when he flung round to come back both his hands were thrust deep into his pockets. He stopped short in front of my chair and looked down. [...] "Don't you believe it?" [...] he inquired with tense curiosity. I was moved to make a solemn declaration of my readiness to believe implicitly anything he thought fit to tell me.' ...|$|E
60|$|The Soubah {{frequently}} visited me, always protesting I was no prisoner, that Campbell's seizure {{was a very}} trifling affair, and {{the violence}} employed all a mistake. He always brought presents, and <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>sound</b> me about the government at Calcutta. On the 12th he paid his last visit, looking wofully dejected, being out of favour at court, and dismissed to his home: he referred me to Meepo for all future communications to the Rajah, and bade me a most cordial farewell, which I regretted being unable to return with any show of kind feeling. Poor fellow! he had staked his last, and lost it, when he undertook to seize the agent {{of the most powerful}} government in the east, and to reduce him to the condition of a tool of the Dewan. Despite the many obstructions he had placed in my way, we had not fallen out since July; we had been constant companions, and though at issue, never at enmity. I had impeached him, and my grievances had been forwarded to the Rajah with a demand for his punishment, but he never seemed to owe me a grudge for that, knowing the Rajah's impotence as compared with the power of the Dewan whom he served; and, in common with all his party, presuming on the unwillingness of the British government to punish.|$|E
6000|$|On July 25 the Times divulged {{the text}} of a {{projected}} agreement in 1869 (it was in truth 1867) between the French and Prussian governments in five articles, including one that the incorporation of Belgium by France would not be objected to by Prussia. The public was shocked and startled, and many were inclined {{to put down the}} document for a forgery and a hoax. As a matter of fact, in substance it was neither. The Prussian ambassador a few days before had informed Mr. Gladstone and Lord Granville personally and in strict secrecy, that the draft of such a project existed in the handwriting of M. Benedetti. This private communication was taken by Mr. Gladstone to have been made with the object of prompting him to be the agent in producing the evil news to the world, and thus to prejudice France in the judgment of Europe. He thought that no part of his duty, and took time to consider it, in the expectation that it was pretty sure to find its way into print by some other means, as indeed soon happened. “For the sake of peace,” Bismarck explained to Lord Granville (July 28, 1870), “I kept the secret, and treated the propositions in a dilatory manner.” When the British ambassador on one occasion had <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>sound</b> him on the suspected designs of France, Bismarck answered, “It is no business of mine to tell French secrets.” ...|$|E
5000|$|The song, {{produced}} and arranged by Brian, was recorded over two sessions in 1964 at United Western Recorders. The instrumental track {{was most likely}} recorded on August 5 with the vocals being overdubbed five days later on August 10. The lead vocal is shared by Brian and Mike Love. Brian expressed disappointment with his vocal, saying that the group were <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>sound</b> like the Four Freshmen, but his voice was too [...] "whiney".|$|R
5000|$|On July 24, 2003, the Chicago Tribune {{negatively}} {{reviewed the}} Special One album and mentioned the single, describing it as [...] "one saccharine, female-empowering anthem that'll make you cringe." [...] In the August 2003 issue of CMJ New Music Monthly, {{a review of}} the album stated [...] "Scent of a Woman" [...] finds Zander sounding like Bob Pollard <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>sound</b> like Roger Daltrey, and the testosterone-fueled emoting is at odds with the feminist message." ...|$|R

60|$|The opera resumed its course, but Mr. Booker did {{not come}} back. The American singer trilled and warbled, {{executed}} remarkable flights, and there was much applause, every symptom of success; but Laura {{became more and more}} unaware of the music--she had no eyes but for Lady Ringrose and her friend. She watched them earnestly--she <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>sound</b> with her glass the curtained dimness behind them. Their attention was all for the stage and they gave no present sign of having any fellow-listeners. These others had either gone away or were leaving them very much to themselves. Laura was unable to guess any particular motive on her sister's part, but the conviction grew within her that she had not put such an affront on Mr. Wendover simply {{in order to have a}} little chat with Lady Ringrose. There was something else, there was some one else, in the affair; and when once the girl's idea had become as definite as that it took but little longer to associate itself with the image of Captain Crispin. This image made her draw back further behind her curtain, because it brought the blood to her face; and if she coloured for shame she coloured also for anger. Captain Crispin was there, in the opposite box; those horrible women concealed him (she forgot how harmless and well-read Lady Ringrose had appeared to her that time at Mellows); they had lent themselves to this abominable proceeding. Selina was nestling there in safety with him, by their favour, and she had had the baseness to lay an honest girl, the most loyal, the most unselfish of sisters, under contribution to the same end. Laura crimsoned with the sense that she had been, unsuspectingly, part of a scheme, that she was being used as the two women opposite were used, but that she had been outraged into the bargain, inasmuch as she was not, like them, a conscious accomplice and not a person to be given away in that manner before hundreds of people. It came back to her how bad Selina had been the day of the business in Lincoln's Inn Fields, and how in spite of intervening comedies the woman who had then found such words of injury would be sure to break out in a new spot with a new weapon. Accordingly, while the pure music filled the place and the rich picture of the stage glowed beneath it, Laura found herself face to face with the strange inference that the evil of Selina's nature made her wish--since she had given herself to it--to bring her sister to her own colour by putting an appearance of 'fastness' upon her. The girl said to herself that she would have succeeded, in the cynical view of London; and to her troubled spirit the immense theatre had a myriad eyes, eyes that she knew, eyes that would know her, that would see her sitting there with a strange young man. She had recognised many faces already and her imagination quickly multiplied them. However, after she had burned a while with this particular revolt she ceased to think of herself and of what, as regarded herself, Selina had intended: all her thought went to the mere calculation of Mrs. Berrington's return. As she did not return, and still did not, Laura felt a sharp constriction of the heart. She knew not what she feared--she knew not what she supposed. She was so nervous (as she had been the night she waited, till morning, for her sister to re-enter the house in Grosvenor Place) that when Mr. Wendover occasionally made a remark to her she failed to understand him, was unable to answer him. Fortunately he made very few; he was preoccupied--either wondering also what Selina was 'up to' or, more probably, simply absorbed in the music. What she had comprehended, however, was that when at three different moments she had said, restlessly, 'Why doesn't Mr. Booker come back?' he replied, 'Oh, there's plenty of time--we are very comfortable.' These words she was conscious of; she particularly noted them and they interwove themselves with her restlessness. She also noted, in her tension, that after her third inquiry Mr. Wendover said something about looking up his friend, if she didn't mind being left alone a moment. He quitted the box and during this interval Laura tried more than ever to see with her glass what had become of her sister. But it was as if the ladies opposite had arranged themselves, had arranged their curtains, on purpose to frustrate such an attempt: it was impossible to her even to assure herself of what she had begun to suspect, that Selina was now not with them. If she was not with them where in the world had she gone? As the moments elapsed, before Mr. Wendover's return, she went to the door of the box and stood watching the lobby, for the chance that he would bring back the absentee. Presently she saw him coming alone, and something in the expression of his face made her step out into the lobby to meet him. He was smiling, but he looked embarrassed and strange, especially when he saw her standing there as if she wished to leave the place.|$|E
5000|$|Jon Bream from Star Tribune made a {{positive}} review about the show, writing: [...] "Newton-John positively sparkled, singing into their eyes, radiating desire, devotion and delight that couldn't be denied". But stated that [...] "when she <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>sound</b> contemporary, she {{seemed out of}} character".|$|E
5000|$|Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic {{described}} Abracadabra as a [...] "disheartening latter-day album from ABC". He {{felt that}} ABC had <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>sound</b> modern by [...] "incorporating both house and smooth Philly soul flourishes to their sound". Although {{he felt that}} sometimes the results were supple and alluring", he felt the album lacked [...] "strong, melodic songs".|$|E
50|$|Eventually, {{the trio}} dubbed {{themselves}} America, chosen {{because they did}} not want anyone to think they were British musicians <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>sound</b> American. They played their first gigs in the London area, including some highlights at the Roundhouse, Chalk Farm where Pink Floyd had played at the beginning of its career. Through Ian Samwell and Jeff Dexter's efforts they were eventually contracted to Kinney Records (UK) in March 1971 by Ian Ralfini and assigned to the UK Warner Brothers label.|$|R
50|$|In a {{contemporary}} review for Rolling Stone, J. D. Considine wrote that Violent Femmes was precocious yet dynamic, {{with a good}} balance between Gano's direct lyrics and the full sound of the music. Robert Christgau of The Village Voice compared Gano and the album as a whole to Jonathan Richman of The Modern Lovers. Gano himself grew tired of comparisons to Richman, as by his own account he was actually <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>sound</b> like Steve Wynn of The Dream Syndicate.|$|R
5000|$|In his Allmusic review, {{music critic}} William Ruhlman {{wrote of the}} album [...] "An {{emphasis}} on {{the parts of the}} album is a way of describing it as more a loose collection of disparate tracks than a unified effort, despite Sebastian's hand in all the compositions and his lead vocals on most of them. This was by necessity, but also by design, since Sebastian and co. went into the studio <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>sound</b> completely different each time. They often succeeded..." ...|$|R

5000|$|In 1962, {{tired of}} the bruises and {{fractured}} bones, he began {{to pursue a career}} in country music. He assembled a band that he called Moe And The Mavericks and found work playing small beer joints, honky-tonks, and clubs over a wide area around San Antonio. When he was young he <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>sound</b> like Hank Williams and George Jones - [...] "I even had my hair cut short like his." ...|$|E
5000|$|Desmond {{produced}} a light, melodic tone on the alto saxophone, {{he said he}} <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>sound</b> [...] "like a dry martini." [...] With a style that {{was similar to that}} of Lee Konitz, one of his influences, he quickly became one of the best-known saxophonists from the West Coast's cool school of jazz. Much {{of the success of the}} classic Brubeck quartet was due to the juxtaposition of his airy style over Brubeck's sometimes relatively heavy, polytonal piano work.|$|E
5000|$|The Pink Spiders {{recorded}} {{their first}} EP three weeks later. According to Ferrari, the record {{can be described}} as [...] "bubblegum" [...] music. He said: [...] "We didn't <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>sound</b> like anyone. We just stole from everyone. That's what good artists do in my opinion." [...] The Pink Spiders Are Taking Over! (2004) was influenced by The Ramones, The Dead Boys, Buddy Holly, and the Bay City Rollers. The band's live debut consisted of a sold-out show in Nashville.|$|R
5000|$|Islam said, Mýa's songwriting is {{consistent}} with the label's philosophy. [...] "We want artistry and strong songs with good messages that appeal to the heart, soul and imagination". Revealing, Mýa's album takes us to another level; my label always want to present something positive and edgy, to reflect young people today. Harrison added that the album is [...] "lady-like" [...] and done in a [...] "tasteful" [...] way, leaving some things to the imagination; rather than <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>sound</b> vulgar or explicit.|$|R
5000|$|On her eponymous 1993 release, Ashton {{was quoted}} during the {{recording}} of the album track [...] "Heart Like a Rock, [...] "I was messing around doing vocals and singing along <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>sound</b> like an electric guitar.
