5|$|The {{image of}} a Wild West filled with countless gunfights was a myth {{generated}} primarily by dime-novel authors in the late 19th century. An estimate of 20,000 men in the American West were killed by gunshot between 1866 and 1900, and over 21,586 total casualties during the American Indian Wars from 1850 to 1890. The most notable and well-known {{took place in the}} states/territories of Arizona, New Mexico, Kansas, Oklahoma, and Texas. Actual gunfights in the Old West were very rare, very few and far between, but when gunfights did occur, the cause for each varied. Some were simply the result of <b>the</b> <b>heat</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>moment,</b> while others were longstanding feuds, or between bandits and lawmen. Lawless violence such as range wars like the Lincoln County War and clashes with Indians were also a cause. Some of these shootouts became famous, while others faded into history with only a few accounts surviving. To prevent gunfights from happening, many cities in the American frontier, such as Dodge City and Tombstone, put up a local ordinance to prohibit firearms in the area.|$|E

He then added that similar to Chute Boxe, Hammer House is also like a family, and thanked Baroni for coming in and watching his back. An outraged Chute Boxe refused to accept Coleman's backstage apology. The Chute Boxe team was assigned a yellow card for instigating this infraction.|$|E

25|$|After her husband's death, Laura Upthegrove {{lived under}} an assumed name in western Florida for a time. In {{the next two}} years, she was arrested on several {{occasions}} before eventually opening a gas station at Canal Point on Lake Okeechobee.

25|$|On one occasion, {{irritated by}} {{the noise from}} a hut where cast and crew were playing cards, the {{explosive}} Kinski fired three gunshots at it, blowing the tip off one extra's finger. Subsequently, Kinski started leaving the jungle location (over Herzog's refusal to fire a sound assistant), only changing his mind after Herzog threatened to shoot first Kinski and then himself. The latter incident {{has given rise to}} the legend that Herzog made Kinski act for him at gunpoint. However Herzog has repeatedly denied the claim during interviews, explaining he only verbally threatened Kinski in <b>the</b> <b>heat</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>moment,</b> {{in a desperate attempt to}} keep him from leaving the set.

25|$|The RAF {{units in}} Burma moved to Arakan on 24 October. Intelligence {{suggested}} the Japanese army would strike {{up the coast}} of Burma to reach India.

25|$|New York City Police Commissioner Julius Enderby is {{secretly}} {{a member}} of the Medievalists, a subversive anti-robot group which pines for the 'olden days' where men did not live in the 'caves of steel'. He uses his position to engineer meetings with Spacer Dr. Sarton under the guise of further cooperation, but he actually intends to destroy R. Daneel - who lives with and resembles Dr. Sarton. Enderby orders R. Sammy to bring a blaster through the unmonitored 'open air' (something that no Earthman could countenance), but in <b>the</b> <b>heat</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>moment</b> Enderby drops his glasses and fails to distinguish between the human and robot, accidentally shooting the human. Knowing that Baley's wife is also a Medievalist, he assigns Baley to the case, working with R. Daneel who represents the Spacers, and spreads a rumour about humanoid robots amongst the subversives to throw suspicion on Baley when Enderby later destroys R. Sammy with radiation. Furthermore, Daneel rules out Enderby as the murderer as his brain patterns show him incapable of deliberately killing.|$|E
500|$|The closing {{arguments}} were heard on 9 and 10 November 2009.

The defence argued for a conviction for manslaughter and attempted manslaughter, by reasoning that the killing was in <b>the</b> <b>heat</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>moment</b> and that the defendant may have a paranoid personality disorder. The verdict was delayed because the requested medical information from Russian authorities that arrived 9 November 2009 attested [...] "undifferentiated schizophrenia" [...] in 2000, thereby requiring additional testimony by a medical expert witness.|$|E

He followed this up with two goals against Real Valladolid on 13 September, Villa's first league goals of the 2009–10 season. He scored twice more a week later against former club Sporting Gijón in a 2–2 draw at the Mestalla, where he also performed duties as the team's captain. After the match, Villa hinted towards being unhappy with Unai Emery's managerial decisions, stating, [...] "The approach {{for the second half}} was not right.

Following the match Solo called her opponents [...] "a bunch of cowards" [...] in reference to their ultra-defensive tactics. The remark was made to Grant Wahl in the raw aftermath of the defeat. [...] The International Olympic Committee called Solo's comments [...] "disappointing" [...] but said she was unlikely to face formal disciplinary action adding [...] "People are free to say those things. We wouldn’t stop their right to express themselves, within boundaries, obviously." [...] Swedish coach Pia Sundhage was more blunt in her assessment: [...] "I don't give a crap.
