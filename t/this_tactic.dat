5|$|Mimesis is also {{employed}} by some predators and parasites to lure their prey. For example, a flower mantis mimics {{a particular kind}} of flower, such as an orchid. <b>This</b> <b>tactic</b> has occasionally been used in warfare, for example with heavily armed Q-ships disguised as merchant ships.|$|E
5|$|Blackberry: A clever buck rabbit with black-tipped ears. He {{is often}} capable of {{understanding}} concepts {{that the other}} rabbits find incomprehensible. He realises, for instance, that wood floats, and the rabbits use <b>this</b> <b>tactic</b> twice to travel on water. He also works out how to dismantle the snare that almost kills Bigwig, saving him. He is one of Hazel's most trusted advisors, given the task to plan a way to rescue does from Efrafa.|$|E
5|$|The Varangians {{had been}} ordered to march {{just in front of}} the main line with a strong {{division}} of archers a little behind them. The archers had been commanded to move in front of the Varangians and fire a volley before retreating behind them. The archers continued <b>this</b> <b>tactic</b> until the army neared contact.|$|E
50|$|Attacking the {{opponent}} groups after their mission over {{and on the}} way to the waiting circle, in a group to fly back across the distance range over the sea. <b>This</b> <b>tactics</b> was taken when his group had much less number of aircraft.|$|R
50|$|According to the United Nations Secretary General Ban Ki-Moon, Hamas is {{launching}} rockets inside schools {{in order to}} use the death toll as a media stunt and deter Israel from attacking Gaza. <b>This</b> <b>tactics</b> is usually referred to as the Human Shield.|$|R
50|$|That {{gold medal}} was {{controversial}} {{because of the}} assistance by the compatriot Kees Bakker. At {{the end of the}} race, Bakker, a 35-year-old veteran at the time, was exactly one lap behind Pronk, who was in the lead. Then, up to the finish line, Bakker rode behind Pronk, covering him from attacks by the competitors. There were speculations that Bakker was paid by Pronk before the race; nevertheless, <b>this</b> <b>tactics</b> was then banned at competitions.|$|R
5|$|The {{player has}} {{a set of}} binoculars. While it is {{generally}} ignored during infantry-limited gameplay, {{it is vital to}} the long-range use of the Crusader tanks and one of the missions in which the player must direct artillery fire to defend a town. It is also important for scouting, though most of the game takes place in personal, close combat situations reducing the importance of <b>this</b> <b>tactic.</b>|$|E
5|$|In {{line with}} this geopolitical perspective, Pablo {{argued that the}} only way the Trotskyists could avoid {{isolation}} was for various sections of the Fourth International to undertake long-term entryism in the mass Communist or Social Democratic parties. <b>This</b> <b>tactic</b> was known as entrism sui generis, to distinguish it from the short-term entry tactic employed before World War II. For example, it meant that the project of building an open and independent Trotskyist party was shelved in France, because it was regarded as not politically feasible alongside entry into the French Communist Party.|$|E
5|$|Not much {{is known}} about the early history of John de Vere, 13th Earl of Oxford, another Lancastrian commander; the chronicles mention little about him until the Battle of Losecoat Field. His father, the {{previous}} earl and a loyal Lancastrian, was executed for a failed plot to assassinate Edward IV. The Yorkist king tried to secure the loyalty of Oxford by knighting him and pardoning his transgressions. <b>This</b> <b>tactic</b> failed; Oxford remained true to the Lancastrian crown and participated in Warwick's effort to dethrone Edward. Historians describe the young Oxford as a decent military leader, exemplified by his conduct in the Battle of Barnet.|$|E
50|$|Status and {{equipment}} of the brigade {{meant that it}} was always used in the worst fighting. Once the Croatian Army went from defensive to offensive strategy in 1993, the army doctrine {{was based on a}} variation of blitzkrieg strategy in which weaker units would hold lines and Guard brigades - like the Tigers - would be used as line breakers to penetrate defenses, then isolate and destroy enemy formations. <b>This</b> <b>tactics</b> was used with great success during 1995.|$|R

50|$|Afterward, the Poles withdrew again, {{this time}} {{to the area of}} Kasina Wielka, where two ambushes were {{organized}} on 4 September. The following day the Poles followed the road towards Myślenice, where yet another ambush was organized. <b>This</b> <b>tactics</b> proved to be a good weapon against the German blitzkrieg as the Germans in the area could not advance faster than mere 10 to 20 kilometres a day and suffering heavy losses in men and equipment. Because of its success, the 10th Motorized Cavalry Brigade remained a fully operational unit until 19 September 1939, when it was ordered to cross the border with Hungary.|$|R
5|$|The {{revival of}} ramming had a {{significant}} effect on naval tactics. Since the 17th century the predominant tactic of naval warfare had been the line of battle, where a fleet formed a long line to give it the best fire from its broadside guns. <b>This</b> <b>tactic</b> was totally unsuited to ramming, and the ram threw fleet tactics into disarray. The question of how an ironclad fleet should deploy in battle to make best use of the ram was never tested in battle, and if it had been, combat might have shown that rams could only be used against ships which were already stopped dead in the water.|$|E
5|$|Federer {{plays with}} a single-handed backhand, which gives him great variety. He employs the slice, {{occasionally}} {{using it to}} lure his opponent to the net and deliver a passing shot. Federer can also fire topspin winners and possesses a 'flick' backhand with which he can generate pace with his wrist; this is usually used to pass the opponent at the net. His serve is difficult to read because he always uses a similar ball toss, regardless of what type of serve {{he is going to}} hit and where he aims to hit it, and turns his back to his opponents during his motion. He is often able to produce big serves on key points during a match. His first serve is typically around 200km/h (125mph); however, he is capable of serving at 220km/h (137mph). Federer is also accomplished at serve and volleying, and employed <b>this</b> <b>tactic</b> frequently in his early career.|$|E
5|$|Sega of America CEO Tom Kalinske wanted {{reassurance}} {{that the character}} would not fail. The global head of marketing, Al Nilsen, became involved, and playtested the game across the United States with Mario fans: they were shown Mario and then played Sonic the Hedgehog. 80 percent preferred Sonic the Hedgehog, and the game was shown at the 1991 Summer Consumer Electronics Show. The game was released in North America on June 23, 1991, and in the PAL regions and Japan the following month. Sega of America packaged it with American Genesis consoles, replacing Altered Beast. <b>This</b> <b>tactic</b> enabled Sega of America to sell 15 million Genesis units. Genesis owners who bought their consoles before the switch could request free copies of Sonic the Hedgehog by mail. Sega of America created a large-scale marketing campaign to promote the game and Sonic as a mascot for the company.|$|E
50|$|Split the market: Branch {{one product}} into two, selling {{one as a}} premium and another as a basic. <b>This</b> {{effective}} <b>tactic</b> was notably used by Heublein, the former owner of the Smirnoff brand of vodka.|$|R
50|$|A {{deliberate}} {{policy of}} aiming {{the line of}} the ball at the batsman's body was employed by England during their 1932-1933 tour of Australia. <b>This</b> dangerous <b>tactic</b> has since been outlawed. See Bodyline for full details.|$|R

5|$|The Cunningham–Rawnsley team {{used the}} AI {{specifically}} to position themselves directly astern and underneath the enemy. Although the German bombers carried a dorsal gunner, {{it was difficult}} to locate an enemy against the black colour of the landscape. Usually the blackness of the country would swallow up the outline of an approaching night fighter. As they approached, the slipstream of the enemy could prove hazardous; bucking the Beaufighter and throwing the pilot off his aim. Approaching from slightly below allowed the attacking pilot to avoid the slipstream. The tactics allowed for Cunningham to close the range and fire first, which was usually sufficient to end the engagement quickly and successfully. Bob Braham, a rival night fighter ace, also used <b>this</b> <b>tactic.</b>|$|E
5|$|The opening {{passages}} {{of the match}} were tentative. Faced with a hostile atmosphere, Liverpool were content {{to sit back and}} frustrate Roma. Despite <b>this</b> <b>tactic,</b> Liverpool took the lead in the 15th minute. Souness and Sammy Lee exchanged passes before passing to Craig Johnston on the right hand side of the pitch. Johnston played a high cross into the Roma penalty area, which was challenged for by Roma goalkeeper Franco Tancredi and Ronnie Whelan. The result was that Tancredi dropped the ball, Roma defenders tried to clear the ball, but Michele Nappi's attempted clearance bounced off Tancredi's back and fell to Liverpool defender Phil Neal who scored to give Liverpool a 1–0 lead. Two minutes later, Souness volleyed the ball into the Roma goal from close range, but his goal was disallowed for offside.|$|E
5|$|<b>This</b> <b>tactic</b> proved highly successful, with Sinclair announcing by March 1982 that it {{had sold}} 250,000 ZX81s worldwide. 50,000 {{computers}} were sold each month, 60% outside the UK, despite Sinclair and W. H. Smith being the only distributors. When sales fell {{in the wake of}} the launch of its successor, the ZX Spectrum, Sinclair reduced the price of the pre-assembled version to £49.95 in May 1982. It was cut by another £10 the following April. Despite the increased competition from much more capable computers, the ZX81 was still shipping in excess of 30,000 units a month even as late as July 1983, more than two years after it had been launched. By that time, according to Sinclair Research, over 1.5 million ZX81s had been sold.|$|E
50|$|Another type of {{interposing}} in chess {{can involve}} placing a piece between two opponent's pieces {{where one of}} those pieces is protecting the other, or they are both protecting each other. <b>This</b> chess <b>tactic</b> can be called interference.|$|R
50|$|The second {{hunger strike}} that began on June 2 {{was led by}} intellectuals and was {{inspired}} by this one. <b>This</b> same <b>tactic</b> was also used by student leaders during the 2014 Hong Kong protests, the next mass movement on Chinese soil.|$|R
50|$|The group's first {{fundraising}} appeal {{promised to}} send a printout of an individual's Social Security records {{in exchange for a}} $10 contribution. <b>This</b> solicitation <b>tactic</b> was met with criticism as the Social Security Administration provides such information for free.

5|$|Vietnam sent 13 {{divisions}} {{into the}} country on 25 December 1978, with an estimated 150,000 soldiers supported by heavy artillery and air power. Kampuchea attempted a conventional defense, but <b>this</b> <b>tactic</b> led {{to the loss of}} half of its army within two weeks. The defeats prompted much of the Kampuchean leadership to evacuate towards the western region of the country. On 7 January 1979, the Vietnamese Army entered Phnom Penh along with the Kampuchean United Front for National Salvation. On the following day, a pro-Vietnamese state, known as the People's Republic of Kampuchea (PRK), was established, with Heng Samrin as head of state and Pen Sovan as General Secretary of the Kampuchean People's Revolutionary Party. The struggle between the Khmer Rouge and the PRK ended only with Vietnam's withdrawal in 1989.|$|E
5|$|Warnings {{in reports}} from Vasco da Gama's voyage to India had {{prompted}} King Manuel I to brief Cabral regarding another port {{to the south}} of Calicut where he could also trade. This city was Kochi and the fleet set sail, reaching it on 24 December. Kochi was nominally a vassal of Calicut, as well as being dominated by other Indian cities. Kochi was eager to achieve independence, and the Portuguese were willing to exploit Indian disunity—as the British would three hundred years later. <b>This</b> <b>tactic</b> eventually ensured Portuguese hegemony over the region. Cabral forged an alliance with Kochi's ruler, as well with rulers of other Indian cities, and was able to establish a factory. At last, loaded with precious spices, the fleet went to Kannur for further trade before setting out on its return voyage to Portugal on 16 January 1501.|$|E
5|$|A lull {{probably}} occurred {{early in}} the afternoon, and a break for rest and food {{would probably have been}} needed. William may have also needed time to implement a new strategy, which may have been inspired by the English pursuit and subsequent rout by the Normans. If the Normans could send their cavalry against the shield wall and then draw the English into more pursuits, breaks in the English line might form. William of Poitiers says the tactic was used twice. Although arguments have been made that the chroniclers' accounts of <b>this</b> <b>tactic</b> were meant to excuse the flight of the Norman troops from battle, this is unlikely as the earlier flight was not glossed over. It was a tactic used by other Norman armies during the period. Some historians have argued that the story of the use of feigned flight as a deliberate tactic was invented after the battle; most historians agree that it was used by the Normans at Hastings.|$|E
50|$|Gameplay is more combat-oriented {{than that}} of No Remorse. In that game, many {{obstacles}} could either be circumvented, defeated with items such as passkeys, or blown up with brute force. <b>This</b> latter <b>tactic</b> is usually the only available course of action in No Regret.|$|R
50|$|In the 2016 London mayoral election, it was {{reported}} that Crosby was involved in linking the Labour candidate Sadiq Khan to terrorist organisations. <b>This</b> campaign <b>tactic</b> is understood to have backfired - it was poorly received by the public and Khan beat Conservative candidate Zac Goldsmith.|$|R

5|$|Armed {{with the}} {{knowledge}} gained from their prisoners, Alvarado sent 40 men to cover the exit from the cave and launched another assault along the ravine from the west, in single file owing to its narrowness, with crossbowmen alternating with soldiers bearing muskets, each with a companion sheltering him from arrows and stones with a shield. <b>This</b> <b>tactic</b> allowed the Spanish {{to break through the}} pass and storm the entrance of the city. The Poqomam warriors fell back in disorder in a chaotic retreat through the city, and were hunted down by the victorious conquistadors and their Mesoamerican allies. Those who managed to retreat down the neighbouring valley were ambushed by Spanish cavalry who had been posted to block the exit from the cave, the survivors were captured and brought back to the city. The siege had lasted more than a month and because of the defensive strength of the city, Alvarado ordered it to be burned and moved the inhabitants to the new colonial village of Mixco.|$|E
5|$|Born in Arenys de Mar, Barcelona, Catalonia, to Francesc Fàbregas Sr., {{who runs}} a {{property}} company, and Núria Soler, {{the owner of a}} pastry company, Fàbregas has supported FC Barcelona since childhood and went to his first match when he was nine months old with his grandfather. He began his club football career with CE Mataró before being signed for Barcelona's La Masia youth academy aged ten in 1997. His first coach, Señor Blai, reportedly did not select Fàbregas for matches against Barcelona in an attempt to hide him from their scouts. <b>This</b> <b>tactic,</b> however, was unable to withstand Barcelona for long, and Mataró gave in and allowed Fàbregas to train with Barcelona one day per week. Eventually Fàbregas joined Barcelona's academy full-time. His initial training was as a defensive midfielder playing alongside notable names such as Gerard Piqué and Lionel Messi. Although he was a prolific scorer, sometimes scoring even more than 30 goals in a season for the club's youth teams, he did not manage to play a first team game at the Camp Nou. During his time at Barcelona's youth academy, Fàbregas idolised Barcelona's then-captain and number four Pep Guardiola, who would later give Fàbregas his shirt as consolation when Fàbregas' parents divorced.|$|E
5|$|Chambers and {{his second}} in command, Captain Charles Spragg, {{immediately}} set about constructing a defensive trench across the post, and strengthening its other defences. But by now the Turks, from the 72nd Infantry Regiment, about 1,000-strong, had managed to use the terrain and darkness to close in on the position. At 22:00 Chambers reported that the position was under attack and surrounded, and at 23:35 the telephone line to headquarters was cut by the Turks. The area in front of No.3 Post was in a gully {{and out of sight}} to the defenders, so they had to climb on the trench parapet to engage the Turks. <b>This</b> <b>tactic</b> worked well, and they broke up the Turkish assault, causing the attackers some casualties. The Turks did not withdraw far, and crept up {{to the edge of the}} New Zealanders' trench during the night. They then threw hand grenades into the New Zealanders' position. At the same time, small arms fire from the surrounding Turkish positions pinned the New Zealanders down.|$|E
