5|$|A Braxy-like disease {{originated}} in the Beverley-York region in 1915. Over the next 15 years it spread across most of the state's farming districts. Flock losses generally were around 5% though there were reported cases of 30% loss. In 1918 Professor Dakin of the University of Western Australia identified the disease as a <b>toxaemia</b> of bacterial origin {{but was unable to}} establish the source.|$|E
5|$|In 1930, Downes' son John, then in {{his first}} year as a boarder at Geelong Grammar School, fell seriously ill with meningitis. Despite the best efforts of two eminent medical practitioners, Dr Keith Fairley and Dr Reginald Webster, John succumbed to <b>toxaemia</b> and died in 1933, at the age of 10. The failure of modern {{medicine}} to save his son affected Downes deeply, and led him to abandon his medical career in favour of a military one.|$|E
25|$|After graduation, {{he became}} a Royal Air Force medical officer for two years, and then {{returned}} to Oxford University in 1950 for a MA degree. In 1950, as a research assistant in Obstetrics, he started to pursue research into preeclamptic <b>toxaemia</b> and started to publish medical papers in 1953. In 1952, he was named a Nichols Research Fellow of the Royal Society of Medicine. From 1952 through 1956, he served at various hospitals in England as the House Surgeon of either Obstetrics or Gynecology and, in 1956, became a lecturer in Obstetrics and Gynecology at London University.|$|E
500|$|Upon {{his return}} to Australia in 1950, McClymont was reassigned as Officer in Charge of the department's Animal Nutrition Research Laboratory at Glenfield Veterinary Research Station. [...] At Glenfield, he {{developed}} research programs on drought feeding and pregnancy <b>toxaemia</b> in sheep and established a nutritional diagnostic service.|$|E
500|$|Good {{nutrition}} {{is vital}} to ewes during the last 6 weeks of pregnancy {{in order to prevent}} pregnancy <b>toxaemia,</b> especially in twin bearing ewes. [...] Overfeeding, however, may result in over large single lambs and dystocia. Shearing ewes before lambing reduces the number of ewes that are cast (i.e. unable to rise unassisted), and the number of lambs and ewes that are lost. Lambs, too, are aided in finding the udder and suckling a shorn ewe.|$|E
500|$|During the 1960s and 1970s, the University of New England {{became a}} {{prominent}} international centre in ruminant research. [...] McClymont published {{a series of}} articles in academic journals on biochemistry and animal nutrition, including pregnancy <b>toxaemia</b> in sheep, poultry nutrition, and mineral deficiencies in dairy cattle. [...] He promoted an original approach to researching metabolic diseases in livestock, utilizing radioactive tracer methods to identify [...] "the quantitative importance of various metabolites including glucose, volatile fatty acids, B-hydroxybutyrate and long chain fatty acids in ruminant metabolism, and the metabolic interactions between these materials." ...|$|E
500|$|Tuberculosis was {{for centuries}} {{associated}} with poetic and artistic qualities among those infected, {{and was also}} known as [...] "the romantic disease". Major artistic figures such as the poets John Keats, Percy Bysshe Shelley, and Edgar Allan Poe, the composer Frederic Chopin, the novelists Charlotte Brontë, Fyodor Dostoevsky, Thomas Mann, W. Somerset Maugham, and Robert Louis Stevenson, and the artists Alice Neel, Jean-Antoine Watteau, Elizabeth Siddal, Marie Bashkirtseff, Edvard Munch, Aubrey Beardsley and Amedeo Modigliani either had the disease or were surrounded by people who did. A widespread belief was that tuberculosis assisted artistic talent. Physical mechanisms proposed for this effect included the slight fever and <b>toxaemia</b> that it caused, allegedly helping them to see life more clearly and to act decisively.|$|E

2500|$|Because of {{the size}} of the parasite, as adult F. hepatica: [...] or adult F. gigantica: 25–75×12mm, fasciolosis is a big concern. The amount of {{symptoms}} depend on how many worms and what stage the infection is in. The death rate is significant in both sheep and cattle, but generally low among humans. Treatment with triclabendazole has been highly effective against the adult worms as well as various developing stages. Praziquantel is not effective, and older drugs such as bithionol are moderately effective but also cause more side effects. Secondary bacterial infection causing cholangitis [...] has also been a concern and can be treated with antibiotics, and <b>toxaemia</b> may be treated with prednisolone.|$|E
2500|$|Royal Society of Medicine {{called a}} 1913 meeting, but, despite some 60 {{synonyms}} circulating for autointoxication from varying perspectives, suggested neutrality by choosing none and introducing a new term, alimentary <b>toxæmia.</b> Several authors, including Lane, presented papers, whereupon some two dozen responded from April to May. There, [...] "chronic intestinal stasis received its deathblow" [...] when a Fellow's severely antagonistic speech, apparently influencing {{the course of}} Lane's career, preempted Lane's opening a surgery school. World War I broke out in 1914, diverting the attention of Lane, newly head of army surgery. Returning from war service, Lane retired from Guy's Hospital in 1920, and continued in private practice. From then onward, Lane wrote almost only on chronic intestinal stasis. Meanwhile, focal infection theory was [...] "coming of age".|$|E
2500|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} in the series many times that regeneration is not guaranteed and can fail. After his cellular structure is decimated by the Metabelis crystals in Planet of the Spiders, the Third Doctor's regeneration requires [...] "a little push" [...] from fellow Time Lord K'anpo Rimpoche before it can proceed. As he succumbs to spectrox <b>toxaemia</b> in The Caves of Androzani, the Fifth Doctor says, [...] "I might regenerate... I don't know... It feels different this time...". He then hallucinates, seeing his former companions encouraging him to survive, before the Master overwhelms them all, telling him he must die. The 1996 TV movie showed the Doctor's regeneration delayed {{for more than three}} hours, with the Eighth Doctor later remarking that the fact his Seventh incarnation was under anaesthesia {{at the time of his}} [...] "death" [...] could have [...] "destroyed the regenerative process", and that he was [...] "dead too long this time" [...] prior to his regeneration. In many episodes, the Doctor doubts his own survival, though it is not always clear whether such statements refer to the death of only that particular incarnation. (The only time he makes a completely unambiguous distinction between these two scenarios – in The End of Time – he makes it clear that he regards regeneration as nearly as bad as death, because as he sees it, he dies and [...] "a new man" [...] walks away). In The Mind of Evil the Master points a conventional firearm at the Doctor and threatens to [...] "put a bullet through both [...] hearts," [...] while in [...] "Forest of the Dead", Professor Song warns that electrocution would stop both the Time Lord's hearts, killing him. In [...] "Turn Left", in which the Tenth Doctor dies in a parallel world, a UNIT member speculates that what happened to the Doctor [...] "must have happened too fast for him to regenerate" [...] (It is suggested that he drowned without his future companion Donna Noble there to inspire him to leave). In The End of Time, the Doctor explains to Wilfred Mott that if he is killed before the regeneration can start, then it will fail.|$|E

50|$|Symptoms {{in humans}} {{are due to}} {{allergic}} responses or systematic <b>toxaemia</b> caused by waste products of the tapeworm. Light infections are usually symptomless, whereas infection with more than 2000 worms can cause enteritis, abdominal pain, diarrhea, loss of appetite, restlessness, irritability, restless sleep, and anal and nasal pruritus. Rare symptoms include increased appetite, vomiting, nausea, bloody diarrhea, hives, extremity pain, headache, dizziness, and behavioral disturbances. Occasionally, epileptic seizures occur in infected children.|$|E
50|$|The {{condition}} was named by Friedrich Albert von Zenker. It is a hyaline degeneration of skeletal muscles such as rectus abdominis and diaphragm, and occurs in severe <b>toxaemia</b> as typhoid fever. It is also seen in electrical burns. Grossly the muscles appear pale and friable; microscopically, the muscle fibres are swollen, have {{a loss of}} cross striations, and show a hyaline appearance. Rupture and small hemorrhage may complicate the lesion. Coagulative necrosis occurs here.|$|E

5000|$|When ticks feed, they secrete saliva {{containing}} powerful enzymes and substances {{with strong}} pharmacological properties to maintain {{flow of blood}} and reduce host immunity.

However, the result can be various forms of <b>toxaemia</b> caused by a variety of ticks. A moist eczema, sometimes with hair loss (alopecia) known as sweating sickness in cattle is caused by Hyalomma truncatum. Tick paralysis can be life-threatening and is caused in sheep by feeding of Ixodes rubicundus of South Africa; in cattle caused by Dermacentor andersoni in North America; in cattle, dogs and humans caused by the Australian paralysis tick, Ixodes holocyclus. 1 ...|$|E
5000|$|According to Walker, {{the number}} one affliction {{underlying}} almost every ailment is constipation, stating that constipation is [...] "the primary cause of nearly every disturbance of the human system." [...] This was, in his view, because the blood vessels lining the colon collect nutrients missed by the small intestine. In his book Pure and Simple Natural Weight Control, Walker stated: [...] "If the feces in the colon have putrefied and fermented, any nutritional elements present in it would pass into the bloodstream as polluted products. What would otherwise be nutritional instead generates toxemia, {{a condition in which}} the blood contains poisonous products which are produced by the growth of pathogenic or disease-producing bacteria." [...] Pimples can be an indication of the presence of <b>toxaemia.</b> Walker maintained that the Standard American Diet causes the colon to be filled with toxins that strain the eliminative channels and, ultimately, the immune system.|$|E
