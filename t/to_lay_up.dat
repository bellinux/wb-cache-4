5|$|The crew of Pamiat' Merkuria pledged its {{allegiance}} to the Ukrainian People's Republic on 12 November 1917 soon after the October Revolution. The occupation of the Ukrainian People's Republic by the Red Army early in 1918 led it <b>to</b> <b>lay</b> <b>up</b> on 28 March 1918 with her guns stripped by Bolsheviks to equip armoured trains. She was captured by the Germans on 1 May 1918 after being left behind in Sevastopol due to its uselessness and used as a barracks ship. She was renamed to Hetman Ivan Mazepa on 17 September 1918 and formally {{handed over to the}} Ukrainian State's Navy.|$|E
5|$|Arthropods {{that are}} Narcissus pests include insects such as three species of fly that have larvae that attack the plants, {{narcissus}} bulb fly Merodon equestris, and two species of hoverflies, the lesser bulb flies Eumerus tuberculatus and Eumerus strigatus. The flies lay their eggs {{at the end of}} June in the ground around the narcissi, a single female fly being able <b>to</b> <b>lay</b> <b>up</b> to fifty eggs. The hatching larvae then burrow through the soil towards the bulbs and consume their interiors. They then overwinter in the empty bulb shell, emerging in April to pupate in the soil, from which the adult fly emerges in May. The larvae of some moths such as Korscheltellus lupulina (the common swift moth) attack Narcissus bulbs.|$|E
25|$|By 1667 Charles {{had run out}} of money. He {{was forced}} <b>to</b> <b>lay</b> <b>up</b> his fleet, giving free rein to the Dutch blockade. In June 1667, De Ruyter, now ably {{assisted}} by Cornelis de Witt, again as deputy-in-the-field, performed his daring Raid on the Medway, a day that went down in English infamy. But it was less a feat of Dutch arms than one of Dutch finance, as {{it would not have been}} possible without the Dutch government simply outspending the English till the latter became exhausted.|$|E

25|$|Mariehamn was {{the base}} for the last large oceanic {{commercial}} sailing ships in the world. Their final tasks were bringing Australian wheat to Great Britain, on which Åland shipowner Gustaf Erikson kept going until after WW2, 1947 being his last year. The ships latterly made only one round-trip from South Australia to Britain per year, (the grain race), after each marathon voyage going back to Mariehamn <b>to</b> <b>lay</b> <b>up</b> for a few months. The ship Pommern, now a museum in Mariehamn, {{was one of these}} last vessels.|$|E
25|$|The {{life cycle}} of Ixodes holocyclus {{consists}} of four (4) stages- egg, larva, nymph, adult. Ticks hatch as six-legged larvae after an incubation period of 40 to 60 days. Larvae search for a blood meal from a host, feed for four to six days, then drop from the host and moult to become an eight-legged nymph. Nymphs require a second blood meal before they can moult again to become an adult. Female adults then require a further blood meal of up to ten days before dropping off <b>to</b> <b>lay</b> <b>up</b> to 3000 eggs in leaf litter. Male adults will search for females on the host for mating, and to parasitise the females for blood meals. This life cycle takes around a year to complete (average 365 days, minimum 135 days, maximum 437 days).|$|E
25|$|As {{a result}} of their defeat in the First Anglo-Dutch War, the Dutch {{transformed}} their navy, largely abandoning the use of militarised merchantmen and establishing a fleet composed mainly of heavily armed, purpose-built warships, as the English had done previously. Consequently, the Second Anglo-Dutch War (1665–1667) was a closely fought struggle between evenly matched opponents, with English victory at Lowestoft (1665) countered by Dutch triumph in the epic Four Days Battle (1666). The deadlock was broken not by combat but by the superiority of Dutch public finance, as in 1667 Charles II was forced <b>to</b> <b>lay</b> <b>up</b> the fleet in port for lack of money to keep it at sea, while negotiating for peace. Disaster followed, as the Dutch fleet mounted the Raid on the Medway, breaking into Chatham Dockyard and capturing or burning many of the Navy's largest ships at their moorings. In the Third Anglo-Dutch War (1672–1674), Charles II allied with Louis XIV of France against the Dutch, but the combined Anglo-French fleet was fought to a standstill in a series of inconclusive battles, while the French invasion by land was warded off.|$|E

500|$|In early 1547 Protector Somerset, the English regent, was contemplating {{to take up}} the War of the Rough Wooing {{once more}} to press home the agreed {{marriage}} of Edward VI and Mary Queen of Scots. On 27 February Andrew Dudley was appointed admiral of the fleet. He was to oversee the [...] "annoyance of the Scots" [...] in the North Sea and to interrupt the shipping of munition from France to Scotland. On 7 March he captured one of the Scottish principal ships, the Great Lion off Dover, giving her a broadside from the Pauncey (correctly the Pensée, sometimes called the Pansy). Odet de Selve, the French ambassador in London, gained a detailed account from Nicolas d'Arfeville, a French painter and cartographer. Dudley was 30 miles from Yarmouth when he saw the Great Lion, with the Lyonesse, the Mary Gallante and another unnamed Scottish ship. The Great Lion was overwhelmed by superior firepower, and the others surrendered, excepting the unnamed ship. The Lion was lost while being towed to Yarmouth when she grounded on a sandbank. Those on board were brought as prisoners to the Tower of London, and at least one notable passenger was killed in the firefight. The Privy Council sent Dudley a letter of commendation on 10 March 1547 for [...] "his hardy enterprise against the Scots" [...] with more detailed instructions. Dudley was told <b>to</b> <b>lay</b> <b>up</b> the Pauncey and other ships for repair; he was to release his Scottish prisoners, except notables, [...] "gentlemen of estimation", and 40 sailors judged to be the best seamen and pilots. Those released would pay their ransom at £4 for a master or officer, and 40 shillings a sailor or mariner.|$|E

[...] Shoalwater was fitted with two geared engines, of which historian Corning said [...] "generated more noise than power".

2500|$|Southern Cross {{was used}} for {{cruising}} from Southampton and Liverpool to Mediterranean ports from June 1971 onwards. Although her design was otherwise well suited for such duties, the ship was not fitted with private facilities in all cabins, which made her a challenging ship to market. Mainly due to Southern Crosss diminishing returns, after just five months of cruising, Shaw Savill decided <b>to</b> <b>lay</b> <b>up</b> the ship in November of the same year. The ship's early withdrawal proved to be her salvation as she escaped the poor maintenance which afflicted her fleet mates {{over the next few}} years resulting in them being sold for scrap by 1974 in spite of being younger than Southern Cross ...|$|E
2500|$|At 14:00 Villaret split his forces, one {{division}} sailing northwards to {{take advantage}} of the breeze coming off the land, while the other maintained passage to the south. Cornwallis tacked his squadron at 06:00 and 17:00, but Villaret de Joyeuse's plan worked well and a shift in the wind at 18:00 allowed the northern squadron to weather and the southern <b>to</b> <b>lay</b> <b>up,</b> the British squadron now lying directly between them about [...] from either French division. During the night the chase continued into the Atlantic, the British squadron struggling to maintain formation due to the slow speed of two members: Brunswicks sailing deficiencies had already been noted, but it became clear that Bellerophon was similarly suffering. In an effort to decrease the weight of the ships and thus increase their speed and allow them to keep pace with the rest of the squadron, captains Lord Charles Fitzgerald and Lord Cranstoun ordered the anchors, boats and much of the provisions and fresh water carried aboard to be thrown over the side: Bellerophon was sailing so slowly that Cranstoun even ordered four carronades to be jettisoned with a large amount of roundshot.|$|E
