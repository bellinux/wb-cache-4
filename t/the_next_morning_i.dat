500|$|The {{writer of}} the ceremony, Frank Cottrell Boyce, said: [...] "People around us thought it might need defending, so I was told to do press <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>morning.</b> <b>I</b> was {{completely}} surprised [...] [...] A {{lot of people were}} surprised. [...] But I don't think Danny was surprised. [...] Danny never blinked. At no point did he show any feeling {{that it was going to}} be anything but amazing. [...] And he was right." ...|$|E
500|$|The deeper {{waters of}} the Tennessee River allowed the Timberlake {{expedition}} to proceed much more quickly. A hunting party led by the Cherokee chief Slave Catcher met the Timberlake expedition {{near the mouth of}} the Little Tennessee River, and supplied the weary expedition with provisions of [...] "dried venison, homminy, and boiled corn." [...] The following day, Slave Catcher guided the expedition by canoe up the Little Tennessee, although the Timberlake party struggled to keep up. Timberlake recalled, [...] "my hands were so galled, that the blood trickled from them, and when we set out <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>morning</b> <b>I</b> was scarce able to handle a pole." [...] The Timberlake party arrived in the Overhill town of Tomotley on December 20, where they were greeted by the town's head man, Chief Ostenaco.|$|E
500|$|MSR Studios was {{the final}} New York City-based studio used, and where most of 4 was {{recorded}}—only [...] "Party" [...] and [...] "I Was Here" [...] were recorded entirely at other studios. At MSR, Beyoncé emphasized the use of live instruments on songs such as [...] "I Care" [...] and [...] "End of Time". Consequently, most of the instruments, including drums, keyboards, guitar and bass work, were recorded there and performed by Jeff Bhasker and Shea Taylor. Beyoncé asked Frank Ocean to write and record [...] "I Miss You" [...] at MSR, saying to Complex, [...] " [...] had a CD playing in the car one Sunday when we were driving to Brooklyn. I noticed his tone, his arrangements, and his storytelling. I immediately reached out to him—literally <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>morning.</b> <b>I</b> asked him to fly to New York and work on my record." ...|$|E

60|$|But <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>morning,</b> when <b>I</b> went to Chevenix’s rooms, {{and after}} I had dutifully {{corrected}} his exercise—‘I compliment {{you on your}} taste,’ said he to me.|$|R
60|$|That is all. Is it a story? In <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>morning's</b> paper <b>I</b> saw {{a little}} news item, and the last {{sentence}} of it may help you (as it helped me) to weld the incidents together.|$|R
500|$|In July 2011, Beyoncé sat for an {{interview}} with Gabriel Alvarez of Complex magazine, where she elaborated on how she came to know about Ocean: [...] "Jay had a CD playing in the car one Sunday when we were driving to Brooklyn. I noticed his tone, his arrangements, and his storytelling. I immediately reached out to him—literally <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>morning.</b> <b>I</b> asked him to fly to New York and work on my record." [...] In this way, Ocean ended up co-writing [...] "I Miss You". Beginning on June 16 to June 27, 2011, the songs from 4 were available to listen to in full each day on Beyoncé's official website, paired with its accompanying photo spread from the album packaging and an insightful quote. On June 18, 2011, [...] "I Miss You"" [...] was the third song to be chosen. The quote found Beyoncé elaborating on what motivated her to record a song like [...] "I Miss You": ...|$|E
500|$|Before {{the release}} of Nostalgia, Ultra, Ocean was a {{relatively}} unknown artist who made a majority of his money from ghostwriting. Within six months, {{it was noted that}} Ocean had become the [...] "go-to vocal hook man." [...] The release of the mixtape interested rap recording artist and producer Kanye West, who was reported to be a big fan. West invited Ocean to write and sing on two songs off Watch the Throne, a collaborative record with rapper Jay-Z. Frank wrote and provided vocals on tracks [...] "No Church in the Wild" [...] and [...] "Made in America". Singer Beyoncé Knowles heard of the mixtape through her husband Jay-Z and was a fan of it. She subsequently invited Ocean to co-write [...] "I Miss You" [...] for her album 4. Discussing how she first heard of Ocean and Nostalgia, Ultra, she commented; [...] "Jay-Z had a CD playing in the car one Sunday when we were driving to Brooklyn. I noticed his tone, his arrangements, and his storytelling. I immediately reached out to him—literally <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>morning.</b> <b>I</b> asked him to fly to New York and work on my record.|$|E
2500|$|Niittymäki was the Philadelphia Flyers' 6th round pick (168th overall) in the 1998 NHL Entry Draft. [...] "I didn't {{even know}} I got drafted. I found out <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>morning.</b> <b>I</b> was really surprised," [...] {{he said in}} an {{interview}} in November 2003. Even if he had opted to go immediately to the United States to play hockey, compulsory military service kept Niittymäki in Finland until January 2001. He would return to TPS in 2012 for his final season, playing 14 games.|$|E
6000|$|<b>The</b> <b>next</b> <b>morning,</b> while <b>I</b> was dressing, {{the steward}} of {{my side of}} the ship came to me as usual to see what I wanted. But the first thing he said to me was--'Rather a bad job, sir--a {{passenger}} missing.' ...|$|R
60|$|Neither Alexander Abraham nor I had worried {{much about}} the smallpox. We didn't believe he would take it, for he hadn't even seen the girl who was sick. But <b>the</b> very <b>next</b> <b>morning</b> <b>I</b> heard him calling me from the upstairs landing.|$|R
60|$|<b>The</b> <b>next</b> <b>morning,</b> when <b>I</b> {{returned}} from my inspection, I found the rector and Philip had decamped {{with two of}} our choice horses, and that my uncle and aunt had commanded the barge, and gone to Mr. Lloyd's. I sent for Scipio.|$|R
2500|$|I {{picked up}} the {{telephone}} and called in from somewhere, and the phone operator said, [...] "University of California." [...] And I said, [...] "Is this Berkeley?" [...] She said, [...] "No." [...] I said, [...] "Well, who have I gotten to?" [...] "UCLA." [...] I said, [...] "Why didn't you say UCLA?" [...] "Oh," [...] she said, [...] "we're instructed to say University of California." [...] So <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>morning</b> <b>I</b> went {{to the office and}} wrote a memo; I said, [...] "Will you please instruct the operators, as of noon today, when they answer the phone to say, 'UCLA. And they said, [...] "You know they won't like it at Berkeley." [...] And I said, [...] "Well, let's just see. There are a few things maybe we can do around here without getting their permission." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>The</b> <b>next</b> <b>morning</b> <b>I</b> proclaimed my {{intention}} {{of going to}} Mr. Dix.|$|E
60|$|<b>The</b> <b>next</b> <b>morning,</b> <b>I</b> {{was awakened}} by Rectus coming into the room.|$|E
60|$|My watch had stopped, but I {{suppose it}} was the middle of the {{afternoon}} when I went to bed, and I slept steadily until some hours after sunrise <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>morning,</b> when <b>I</b> was awakened by a loud knock at the door.|$|R
60|$|<b>The</b> <b>next</b> <b>morning,</b> as <b>I</b> {{was going}} to the well, I saw Phineas Colwell coming down the lane and Mrs. Betty Perch coming up it. I did not wish them to {{question}} me, so I stepped behind some bushes. When they met they stopped.|$|R
60|$|ON TUESDAY, the 20th of February, while I sat at my master's {{work in the}} evening, he came in, looking sad, {{and said}} it had been decided to begin the trial at eight o'clock <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>morning,</b> and <b>I</b> must get ready to assist him.|$|R
60|$|By daybreak <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>morning,</b> <b>I</b> {{was on my}} {{way back}} to my own country.|$|E
60|$|Early <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>morning</b> <b>I</b> left London for Paris by the tidal-train. Benjamin {{accompanied}} {{me to the}} Terminus.|$|E
60|$|But <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>morning</b> <b>I</b> {{started for}} Checkshill, started, I remember, in a curiously hopeful state of mind, {{oblivious}} of comets, strikes, and wars.|$|E
60|$|As {{they were}} to remain with us that day and had taken their places to return by <b>the</b> coach <b>next</b> <b>morning,</b> <b>I</b> sought an {{opportunity}} of speaking to Mr. Skimpole.

6000|$|... "Yes, {{the general}} sympathy had {{penetrated}} to Mrs. Westangle, though I don't {{say that she}} had been more than negatively indifferent to Miss Shirley's claim on her before. As it was, she sent for me to her room <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>morning,</b> and <b>I</b> found Miss Shirley alone there. She said Mrs. Westangle would be down in a moment." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You will {{remember}} that I {{refused to discuss}} things with you then. I told you that I was coming for you <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>morning,</b> and <b>I</b> mentioned what I thought of bringing with me. When I arrived at your boarding-house you had gone. You left no word nor any message. I don't consider that that was treating me nicely." ...|$|R
60|$|Early <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>morning,</b> <b>I</b> {{set forth}} {{for the little}} town of Dorking--the place of Sergeant Cuff's retirement, as {{indicated}} to me by Betteredge.|$|E

60|$|Early <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>morning</b> <b>I</b> {{took the}} first train for Richmond and within two hours was being ushered into the room {{occupied}} by John Carter.|$|E
60|$|<b>The</b> <b>next</b> <b>morning</b> when <b>I</b> came on deck I found a {{new world}} indeed. The wind was fair; the sun mounted into a {{cloudless}} heaven; through great dark blue seas the ship cut a swath of curded foam. The horizon was dotted all day with companionable sails, and the sun shone pleasantly on the long, heaving deck.|$|R
5000|$|.....In {{those days}} (1938), {{the trip from}} New York to Pavilion took at least 10 hours. I arrived late in the evening, so it wasn't until <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>morning</b> that <b>I</b> {{had a chance to}} walk around the grounds. Bill Gratwick and I were strolling down the long {{driveway}} when suddenly my breath was taken by the incredible color of rows of tree peonies in full bloom.|$|R
5000|$|He left {{college to}} tour with Earl Carroll's Vanities, playing five shows {{a day on}} the movie circuit for 3 months. [...] "They said if I was {{interested}} in joining them, I had to be in Kansas City <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>morning.</b> So <b>I</b> quickly quit school and joined the show." [...] The movie circuit consisted of performing between movie screenings at theatres across the country.|$|R
6000|$|... "That is so, sir," [...] I answered. [...] "And early <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>morning</b> <b>I</b> {{reported}} to the Duke that the papers had been tampered with." ...|$|E
60|$|This was {{all that}} could be desired. We {{exchanged}} cards. At Chalk-Farm, <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>morning,</b> <b>I</b> shot off his nose--and then called upon my friends.|$|E
60|$|Early <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>morning</b> <b>I</b> arose {{and went}} upstairs to {{consider}} what had better be done, when I saw the boarder standing on shore, near by.|$|E
6000|$|I went to {{the head}} cashier <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>morning</b> when <b>I</b> opened my little modicum of an account. He had {{received}} orders to pay my drafts without reference to my balance. My checks, when I had overdrawn, were to be privately shown to Mr. Fauntleroy. Do many young men who start in business find their prosperous superiors ready to help them in that way? ...|$|R
60|$|I {{kept the}} evening of the day I met Hawthorne wholly for the {{thoughts}} of him, or rather for that reverberation which continues in the young sensibilities after some important encounter. It must have been <b>the</b> <b>next</b> <b>morning</b> that <b>I</b> went to find Thoreau, and I am dimly aware of making one or two failures to find him, if I ever really found him at all.|$|R
60|$|The {{following}} day I {{was obliged to}} go to Nice, and did not return till midnight. The porter told me that Jules le Ferrier had been to see me. <b>The</b> <b>next</b> <b>morning,</b> while <b>I</b> was still in bed, the door was opened, and Jules appeared. His face was very pale; and the moment he stood still drops of perspiration began coursing down his cheeks.|$|R
