5|$|As the French fleet was {{preparing}} to depart Brest, France in March 1781, several important decisions were made. The West Indies fleet, led by the Rear-Admiral Comte François Joseph Paul de Grasse, after operations in the Windward Islands, was directed to go to Cap-Français (present-day Cap-Haïtien, Haiti) to determine what resources {{would be required to}} assist Spanish operations. Because of a lack of transports, France also promised six million livres to support the American war effort instead of providing additional troops. The French fleet at Newport was given a new commander, the Comte Jacques-Melchior de Barras Saint-Laurent. He was ordered to take the Newport fleet to harass British shipping off Nova Scotia and Newfoundland, and the French army at Newport was ordered to combine with Washington's army outside New York. In orders that were deliberately not fully shared with General Washington, De Grasse was instructed to assist in North American operations after his stop at Cap-Français. The French Lieutenant-General Comte Jean-Baptiste de Rochambeau, was instructed to tell Washington <b>that</b> <b>de</b> Grasse might be able to assist, without making any commitment (Washington learned from John Laurens, stationed in Paris, <b>that</b> <b>de</b> Grasse had discretion to come north).|$|E

40|$|We place {{our sample}} of 18 Virgo dwarf early-type galaxies (dEs) on the (V - K) (e) -velocity dispersion, Faber-Jackson, and {{fundamental}} plane (FP) scaling relations for massive early-type galaxies (Es). We use a generalized velocity dispersion, which includes rotation, {{to be able}} to compare the location of both rotationally and pressure supported dEs with those of early and late-type galaxies. We find <b>that</b> <b>dEs</b> seem to bend the Faber-Jackson relation of Es to lower velocity dispersions, being the link between Es and dwarf spheroidal galaxies (dSphs). Regarding the FP relation, we find <b>that</b> <b>dEs</b> are significantly offset with respect to massive hot stellar systems, and re-casting the FP into the so-called. -space suggests that this offset is related to dEs having a total mass-to-light ratio higher than Es but still significantly lower than dSph galaxies. Given a stellar mass-to-light ratio based on the measured line indices of dEs, the FP offset allows us to infer that the dark matter fraction within the half light radii of dEs is on average greater than or similar to 42 % (uncertainties of 17 % in the K band and 20 % in the V band), fully consistent with an independent estimate in an earlier paper in this series. We also find <b>that</b> <b>dEs</b> in the size-luminosity relation in the near-infrared, like in the optical, are offset from early-type galaxies, but seem to be consistent with late-type galaxies. We thus conclude that the scaling relations show <b>that</b> <b>dEs</b> are different from Es, and that they further strengthen our previous findings <b>that</b> <b>dEs</b> are closer to and likely formed from late-type galaxies...|$|R
5|$|Becket excommunicated both de Brocs {{again on}} Christmas Day, 1170. On 28 December 1170, de Broc {{received}} at Saltwood Castle four knights– William de Tracy, Reginald fitzUrse, Hugh de Morville, and Richard le Breton– {{who had arrived}} from the continent. The five men conceived a plan to surround Canterbury Cathedral and force Becket to rescind his excommunications. On 29 December 1170, the five men arrived at Canterbury, where it appears <b>that</b> <b>de</b> Broc {{was in charge of}} the soldiers surrounding the cathedral while the other four went inside to negotiate with the archbishop. The four did not succeed in persuading the archbishop and the situation degenerated into the four men murdering Becket at one of the altars of the cathedral. After this, the four rejoined de Broc and searched the archiepiscopal residence for papers and other documents <b>that</b> <b>de</b> Broc was to send to the king.

5|$|British Vice-Admiral Sir George Brydges Rodney {{had been}} warned <b>that</b> <b>de</b> Grasse was {{planning}} {{to take at least}} part of his fleet north. Although he had some clues that he might take his whole fleet (he was aware of the number of pilots de Grasse had requested, for example), he assumed <b>that</b> <b>de</b> Grasse would not leave the French convoy at Cap-Français, and that part of his fleet would escort it to France. So Rodney accordingly divided his fleet, sending Rear-Admiral Sir Samuel Hood north with 15 ships of the line and orders to find de Grasse's destination in North America and report to New York. Rodney, who was ill, took the rest of the fleet back to Britain in order to recover, refit his fleet, and to avoid the Atlantic hurricane season. Hood sailed from Antigua on 10 August, five days after de Grasse. During the voyage, one of his ships became separated and was captured by a privateer.|$|E

The paper argues that Leibniz introduced the notion of a substantial bond, at the demand of Des Bosses, in order to secure the reality of extension; <b>that</b> <b>Des</b> Bosses had strong views on matter and extension, which could not be satisfied by Leibniz's proposal; that these views led him to reject Leibniz's notion of the substantial bond; consequently, that Leibniz's notion of corporeal substance was incompatible with the views on matter and extension defended by Des Bosses; and, finally, <b>that</b> <b>Des</b> Bosses developed his metaphysical ideas in 1735 by using Leibnizian insights for his agenda.
