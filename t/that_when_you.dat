5|$|De Hauteclocque {{broke his}} leg {{in two places}} in a fall from his horse in 1936. He told his company {{that it was his}} own fault for riding on the {{shoulder}} of the road. Thereafter he frequently walked with a cane. After another mishap involving losing his way during a tactical exercise and getting stuck in a field cordoned off with barbed wire, he told them <b>that</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> have done something really stupid, it is best to admit it.|$|E
5|$|It's good to {{know people}} didn't see it coming. That's a big concern when you {{have this kind of}} story line and you are leading to that kind of reveal. You don't want people to be expecting it, {{especially}} in the Walking Dead. I pride myself in the fact <b>that,</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> pick up an issue of the comic, you don't know what's going to happen at any time. So any time we can work that into the show and maintain that in a television environment, it's very exciting for me. I’m glad people are being caught off guard.|$|E
25|$|The Croydon area {{by itself}} is {{considered}} a fairly safe Labor area. The table to the right shows <b>that</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> {{just look at the}} polling booths in the suburb of Croydon, Labor has consistently returned around 60% of the two-party preferred vote even when the first preference votes have fluctuated. The Greens vote, while not as large as {{in other parts of the}} inner-west has been steadily increasing in recent years.|$|E

25|$|The early 1970s saw the {{emergence}} of a new crop of West Indian cricketers, ones eager to shake the tag of Calypso, and who could dominate world cricket. However, it is said <b>that</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> have 10 young men from various islands in the Caribbean, you don't have a team; you have a gang. What was needed was a guiding hand, who could steer this young team in the right direction, and unite them for a common cause on the cricket field. That man was Clive Lloyd. Appointed as Captain in 1974, Lloyd's first major challenge came in the 1975-76 West Indies Tour of Australia.|$|E
25|$|The {{substance}} of your answer was: That many people exhort others to charity from self-interest; that men of fortune must mind their fortune; that you cannot go about {{to look for}} poor people; <b>that</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> have seen them your-self, and relieved them, they were scarce ever satisfied; that many make an ill use of what you give them; that you cannot trust the account people give of themselves by letters; that nevertheless you do give to private persons by the hands of Colonel Hudson and others; that you have also given to several hospitals an hundred pounds at a time, but that you must support your family; that the Lowther family has continued above four hundred years; that you are for great things -- for public charities and for saving the nation from ruin; and that others may think as they please, but this is your way of thinking, {{and has been for}} many years...|$|E
500|$|Sony {{then held}} auditions {{for the role}} of the young Peter, who needed to {{resemble}} Garfield. Webb said, [...] "I think we saw the origin of Spider-Man before but not the origin of Peter Parker." [...] Webb felt <b>that</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> try to build the film you must build the protagonist from the ground up. That's why he wanted Parker to begin as a child.|$|E

500|$|Concurrently {{with his}} work at The Spectator, Levin was the drama critic of The Daily Express from 1959, {{offending}} many in theatrical circles by his outspoken verdicts. He modelled his reviewing style on that of Bernard Shaw's musical reviews of the late 19th century. He gave a fellow-critic an edition of Shaw's collected criticism, writing inside the cover, [...] "'In the hope <b>that</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> come across the phrases I have already stolen you will keep quiet about it".|$|E
500|$|Meyer, the author, and Hardwicke, the director, {{had a close}} {{relationship}} while developing Twilight. Hardwicke wanted to embrace the experience and make {{the characters in the}} books come to life. She would call Meyer after changing a scene slightly, which surprised the author because, [...] "I've heard the stories...I know it's not normally like <b>that</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> adapt a book." [...] Meyer, a natural pessimist, was waiting for the worst but, instead, called her experience in the book's film adaptation [...] "the best I could have hoped for." ...|$|E
500|$|Taborn has {{commented on}} the {{similarities}} and differences in his playing on piano and electronic instruments. Comparing his accompaniments on piano and Fender Rhodes, he said that: I play some of the same chords on the piano, but there are definitely things I would do on the piano because it's a more transparent instrument that I wouldn't do on the Rhodes. [...] The Rhodes is so strong <b>that</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> play something on it, it really can dictate, because it's louder and the timbre is much more opaque. So you leave more holes. On the piano, I would maybe play more sustain chords.|$|E

500|$|As with {{previous}} ceremonies he produced, Cates centered the show around a theme. This year, he christened {{the show with}} the theme [...] "Togetherness of Moviegoing" [...] commenting, [...] "The thing that's kind of wonderful about movies is that you watch them with other people. The only other areas where you do <b>that,</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> think about it, are religion and sports." [...] He concluded by noting that the movie theater is [...] "a wonderful place where you come together to laugh, to cry." [...] In tandem with the theme, actress Winona Ryder presented a montage featuring film clips from Matinee, Casablanca, and A Streetcar Named Desire depicting audiences inside a movie theater.|$|E

It was registered with the U.S. Copyright Office on April 26, 2003 under the title of [...] "Everytime I Try" [...] and SRU000530591 registration number with a given recording year of 2002. Spears named it the most personal song of the album along with [...] "Touch of My Hand", explaining, [...] "It's one of the songs <b>that</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> hear, it's like the kind of song when you go to heaven. It kind of takes you away. You know, it takes you in to a very cool consciousness I think." ...|$|E
500|$|Barrowman {{spent his}} senior year shovelling coal for an Illinois power company. His father had {{arranged}} the job (and similar jobs for his brother and sister) to give Barrowman the experience of manual labour. His father told him: [...] "If {{you want to do}} manual labour {{for the rest of your}} life you'll know <b>that</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> do it; it's a choice. But if you don't like it, you'll understand the importance of educating yourself and – if you decide what you want to do – being good at your craft or your skill." [...] Barrowman worked for the power company for the entire summer, but did not like the job. Eventually, he convinced the company to move him to work in the storeroom.|$|E

500|$|In 2006, Frank was one {{of three}} Representatives to oppose the Respect for America's Fallen Heroes Act, which {{restricted}} protests (notably those of Fred Phelps' Westboro Baptist Church) at soldiers' funerals. He opposed the bill, which passed unanimously in the Senate, on civil liberties and constitutional grounds. Frank said of the vote, [...] "I think it's very likely to be found unconstitutional. [...] It's true <b>that</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> defend civil liberties you are typically defending people who do obnoxious things... You play into their hand when you let them provoke you into overdoing it. I don't want these thugs to [...] claim [...] America is hypocritical." [...] The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People scored him at 100% in 2006 indicating a pro-affirmative-action stance.|$|E
500|$|No {{specific}} {{details of the}} workings of the claimed technology were made public. McCarthy stated in a 2006 RTÉ radio interview, [...] "What we have developed is a way to construct magnetic fields so <b>that</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> travel round the magnetic fields, starting and stopping at the same position, you have gained energy". In 2011, Steorn's website was updated to suggest that the Orbo is based on magnetic fields which vary over time. Barry Williams of the Australian Skeptics has pointed out that Steorn is [...] "not the first company to claim they have suddenly discovered the miraculous property of magnetism that allows you to get free energy" [...] while Martin Fleischmann says that it is not credible that positioning of magnetic fields could create energy.|$|E
500|$|... "Steve Burdick" [...] {{scored a}} Nielsen rating of 9.7, equating to {{approximately}} 9.5 million viewers, and a 17 share, meaning that 17% of all television {{sets in use}} during its time period were tuned to the episode. NBC reported losing $500,000 in advertising revenue. Speaking of this loss, then-NBC president Warren Littlefield said, at odds with NBC's earlier denial of possible revenue loss being a factor in its scheduling decision, [...] "There are few things in broadcasting that we know for sure, {{and one of those}} is <b>that</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> do an episode of any series that deals with AIDS, {{there is going to be}} advertiser sensitivity to it. And if you choose to do it anyway, you better count on losing money." ...|$|E

[...] We talked about this {{and we talked about}} it openly. [...] If Bump had said to me, ‘Look, give me a couple of more years,’ I would have given it to him. [...] I mean that. [...] I didn’t fire Bump Elliott. [...] My first year as director Bump had an 8 and 2 record. [...] Anyone could live with that." ...|$|E
500|$|On 4 October, TV3 {{broadcast}} Vincent Browne's Big Presidential Debate. Gay Mitchell challenged Martin McGuinness on the [...] "fairytale" [...] that he {{left the}} IRA in 1974, asking him directly: [...] "If you (McGuinness) say you left the IRA in 1974 and persist in saying <b>that</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> didn’t; {{if you say you}} are living on the average industrial wage when you are drawing down a couple of hundred grand– how can people have confidence in your word?" [...] Moderator Vincent Browne later challenged Martin McGuinness' claims {{that he left}} the Provisional Irish Republican Army in 1974, producing eight books with alleged evidence claiming otherwise. McGuinness referenced this moment when he said in a later debate on the radio that people would blame him for the 1916 Rising if they {{could find a way to}} implicate him.|$|E
500|$|Eisenhower sent Attorney General Herbert Brownell to {{meet with}} Bricker to try to delay {{consideration}} of the resolution while the administration studied it; Bricker refused, noting his original proposal was introduced over a year earlier in the previous session of Congress. Bricker was willing, however, to compromise on the language of an amendment, unlike Frank Holman, who was intent on a particular wording. [...] However, the administration, particularly Dulles, irritated Bricker by refusing to offer an alternative to his resolution. [...] Eisenhower privately continued to disparage the Amendment with strong language, calling it [...] "a stupid blind violation of the Constitution by stupid, blind non-interventionists" [...] and stating [...] "if it is true <b>that</b> <b>when</b> <b>you</b> die {{the name of the}} things that bothered you the most are engraved on your skull, I'm sure I'll have there the mud and dirt of France during the invasion and the name of Senator Bricker." ...|$|E
