5|$|The {{solution}} circle may {{be either}} internally or externally tangent {{to each of}} the given circles. An external tangency is one where the two circles bend away from each other at <b>their</b> <b>point</b> <b>of</b> contact; they lie {{on opposite sides of the}} tangent line at that point, and they exclude one another. The distance between their centers equals the sum of their radii. By contrast, an internal tangency is one in which the two circles curve in the same way at <b>their</b> <b>point</b> <b>of</b> contact; the two circles lie on the same side of the tangent line, and one circle encloses the other. In this case, the distance between their centers equals the difference of their radii. As an illustration, in Figure1, the pink solution circle is internally tangent to the medium-sized given black circle on the right, whereas it is externally tangent to the smallest and largest given circles on the left.|$|E
5|$|In arid climates, {{the main}} source of erosion is wind. The general wind {{circulation}} moves small particulates such as dust across wide oceans thousands of kilometers downwind of <b>their</b> <b>point</b> <b>of</b> origin, which is known as deflation. Westerly winds in the mid-latitudes of the planet drive the movement of ocean currents from west to east across the world's oceans. Wind has a very important role in aiding plants and other immobile organisms in dispersal of seeds, spores, pollen, etc. Although wind is not the primary form of seed dispersal in plants, it provides dispersal for {{a large percentage of the}} biomass of land plants.|$|E
5|$|In {{the second}} approach, the radii of the given circles are {{modified}} appropriately by an amount Δr so {{that two of}} them are tangential (touching). <b>Their</b> <b>point</b> <b>of</b> tangency is chosen as the center of inversion in a circle that intersects each of the two touching circles in two places. Upon inversion, the touching circles become two parallel lines: Their only point of intersection is sent to infinity under inversion, so they cannot meet. The same inversion transforms the third circle into another circle. The solution of the inverted problem must either be (1) a straight line parallel to the two given parallel lines and tangent to the transformed third given circle; or (2) a circle of constant radius that is tangent to the two given parallel lines and the transformed given circle. Re-inversion and adjusting the radii of all circles by Δr produces a solution circle tangent to the original three circles.|$|E

5|$|In the spring, mature birds {{return to}} land, usually to the colony {{at which they}} were hatched. Birds that were removed as chicks and {{released}} elsewhere were found to show fidelity to <b>their</b> <b>point</b> <b>of</b> liberation. They congregate {{for a few days}} on the sea in small groups offshore before returning to the cliff top nesting sites. Each large puffin colony is subdivided into sub-colonies by physical boundaries such as stands of bracken or gorse. Early arrivals take control of the best locations, the most desirable nesting sites being the densely packed burrows on grassy slopes just above the cliff edge where take-off is most easily accomplished. The birds are usually monogamous, but this is the result of their fidelity to their nesting sites rather than to their mates and they often return to the same burrows year after year. Later arrivals at the colony may find that all the best nesting sites have already been taken and be pushed towards the periphery where they are in greater danger of predation. Younger birds may come ashore a month or more after the mature birds and find no remaining nesting sites. They will not breed till the following year although it has been found that if the ground cover surrounding the colony is cut back before these sub-adults arrive, the number of successfully nesting pairs may be increased.|$|E
5|$|The main {{characters}} in the Five Nights at Freddy's series are generally security guards working at a Freddy Fazbear's Pizza or related location. None of them have distinct personalities {{and most of the}} gameplay takes place from <b>their</b> <b>point</b> <b>of</b> view. In Five Nights at Freddy's, the guard's name is Mike Schmidt. In Five Nights at Freddy's 2, the guard is named Jeremy Fitzgerald for all of the main five nights and the bonus sixth night, though he is replaced in the custom seventh night by another guard, Fritz Smith. The security guard for Fazbear's Fright: The Horror Attraction in Five Nights at Freddy's 3, is unknown. The main character of Five Nights at Freddy's 4 is an unnamed boy, who experiences nightmares of the animatronics. The player in Five Nights at Freddy's: Sister Location is a technician who has their name jokingly autocorrected to Eggs Benedict. The technician's name is assumed, although not confirmed to be, Mike.|$|E
