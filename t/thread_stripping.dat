40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis is to study the {{behaviour}} of bolted steel connections subjected to tension. Quasi-static conditions have been considered. By performing laboratory tests on single bolts and simple T-stub connections the failure modes of the bolts have been examined. Finite element models are created and validated to represent the behaviour observed in the laboratory. Different grip length configurations have been tested for a single bolt and nut assembly subjected to pure tension. Both partially and fully threaded bolts have been considered. It was found that partially threaded bolts with three threads between the unthreaded part of the shank and the bearing surface of the nut experienced <b>thread</b> <b>stripping.</b> This is inconsistent with the recommendations given in NS-EN 1090 - 2, which states that one full thread is sufficient to avoid <b>thread</b> <b>stripping.</b> Finite element models are able to recreate the behaviour of all configurations tested with acceptable accuracy. In addition to the grip length, the material properties and geometry of the threads are identified as the crucial factors for the failure modes of the bolts. Simple T-stub connections with one bolt in each flange have been tested to examine the behaviour of the bolts when they are subjected {{to a combination of}} tension and bending. The center distance between the bolts was varied to examine the behaviour when subjected to increased bending effects. Connections with partially threaded bolts all failed due to <b>thread</b> <b>stripping.</b> The fully threaded bolts experienced both <b>thread</b> <b>stripping</b> and bolt failure. The complexity of the stress distribution when large bending effects are present was difficult to recreate with a simplified finite element model. Acceptable accuracy up to maximum force was possible to achieve for the smallest bolt center distance. The response of the finite element model was very mesh sensitive, and difficult to recreate with limited computational capacity when applying an explicit solution algorithm...|$|E
40|$|Worldwide {{interest}} {{in how to}} prevent the progressive collapse for tall and large buildings under exceptional loading conditions was heightened {{by the collapse of}} the twin towers at the World Trade. The performance of steel-framed structures subjected to fire loading is heavily reliant on the interaction between structural members such as columns, slabs and beams. The implicit assumption in fire engineering design is that bolted connections are able to maintain the structural integrity for a large and tall building under fire conditions. Unfortunately, evidence from the collapse of the World Trade Centre towers and full scale fire tests at the BRE Cardington Laboratory indicates that connections may be particularly vulnerable during both heating and cooling. Hence, this PhD research is focused on structural performance of simple steel connections under fire conditions, particularly the interaction mechanism between non-ductile and ductile components in a connection and connection failure mechanism in a steel-framed structure subjected to fire loading. The research involved experimental testing of simple steel connections and components (structural 8. 8 bolts) at elevated temperatures. High temperature tests on structural bolts demonstrated two modes of failure at elevated temperatures: bolt breakage and <b>thread</b> <b>stripping.</b> In order to prevent the <b>thread</b> <b>stripping</b> in a connection, the manufacturing process of bolts and nuts has been investigated and the 'overtapping' of nut threads to accommodate the (zinc) coating layer for corrosion resistance has been indentified as a primary reason resulting in this premature failure between bolts and nuts. Experimental tests on endplate connections revealed the ductility of these connections to decrease at high temperatures, which might hinder the development of catenary actions in fire if plastic hinges are attempted to be formed within the connection zones. Component-based modelling and finite element simulation have been utilized for investigation of the performance of these connections. An improved component-based model has been developed which includes nonductile (brittle) components (bolts and welds) into a connection model with a reasonable assumption of their failure displacements, based on experimental tests. This model also features vertical components for consideration of shear response of these connections in fire. The component-based connection model has been used in a sub-frame structure and a parametric study demonstrates that a connection may fail {{due to a lack of}} rotational capacity (failure of bolts or welds) in a structure exposed to a fire. Therefore, partial depth endplate connections are recommended to be fireprotected to prevent the failure of these brittle components. Alternatively, ensuring the strength of brittle components (bolts and welds) is higher than that of other components in each bolt row is necessary to achieve the ductile failure mechanism of simple connections. Based on the experimental tests, component-based connection modelling and finite element simulation, recommendations to improve the robustness of simple steel connections in fire have been presented...|$|E

Four types of implants (Conex&# 227;o&# 174;) were analyzed: Master Porous (MP - external hexagon, cylindrical, double-porous surface implants; 11. 5 X 3. 75 mm), Master Screw (MS - external hexagon, cylindrical, machined implants; 11. 5 X 3. 75 mm), Conect Conic (CC - external hexagon, cylindrical, machined implants; 11. 5 X 3. 5 mm) and Master Conect AR (CA - internal hexagon, cylindrical, double-porous surface implants; 11. 5 X 3. 75 mm). The Nikon&# 174; model C profile projector {{was used for the}} analysis before and after torsion test with a Mackena&# 174; model MK- 20 XX digital torque meter. The measures analyzed in the profile of implants were: diameter and height of the platform, diameter of the screw/platform connection, angle of the screw/platform connection, external diameter, internal diameter, thread pitch, height and length of the thread. Statistical analysis was performed using ANOVA and Tukey test at 5 % significance level. The torsion test caused a visible deformity on the external implant profile. There was a statistical difference among the implants before and after torsion (p< 0. 05) for the variables: platform diameter, platform height, diameter of the screw/platform connection and length. Changes were observed in platform height of CC and CA, fracture of CA implants, fracture of the MP and MS assembler/connectors, and internal <b>thread</b> <b>stripping</b> of CC. Thus, it was concluded that excessive or some unadvised torque by the manufacturer can lead to changes in different geometric measurements of implants...|$|E
40|$|Structural bolts {{have been}} {{manufactured}} for building construction {{for hundreds of}} years. In practice, failure of high strength structural bolts might be caused by their tolerance classes or coating procedures, which may weaken their internal or external threads. However, this research work is dedicated to understanding a bit more on bolt performance in tension, accounting for effects of tolerance classes in the applied numerical simulation for assessment of performance of structural bolts subjected to tensile loading. In addition, different constitutive relationships has also been {{taken into account in}} the numerical analysis in use of both implicit and explicit methods. The observed simulation results demonstrated two failure mechanisms for structural bolts, <b>threads</b> <b>stripping</b> and bolt shank failure, which has proved to be associated with their tolerance classes and coating procedures applied. As a result of this, carefully selecting bolts and nuts is a deliberate solution in preventing the premature failure (<b>threads</b> <b>stripping)</b> in bolted connections for performance-based steel construction...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—To {{determine}} {{the length of}} engagement threads of a bolt installed in a tapped part {{in order to avoid}} the <b>threads</b> <b>stripping</b> remains a very current problem in the design of the thread assemblies. It does not exist a calculation method formalized for the cases where the bolt is screwed directly in a ductile material. In this article, we study the behavior of the <b>threads</b> <b>stripping</b> of a loaded assembly by using a modelling by finite elements and a rupture criterion by damage. This modelling enables us to study the different parameters likely to influence the behavior of this bolted connection. We study in particular, the influence of couple of materials constituting the connection, of the bolt’s diameter and the geometrical characteristics of the tapped part, like the external diameter and the length of engagement threads. We established an experiments design to know the most significant parameters. That enables us to propose a simple expression making possible to calculate the resistance of the threads whatever the metallic materials of the bolt and the tapped part. We carried out stripping tests in order to validate our model. The estimated results are very close to those obtained by the tests.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis is to study the {{behaviour}} {{of the connection between}} the guardrail and post in a steel road safety barrier subject to tensile, shear and combined loading conditions. This is accomplished by performing laboratory tests on a special-built test rig. Finite element models of the connection are created and validated in order to form a basis for large scale numerical simulations of road safety barriers. The laboratory tests all failed by <b>thread</b> <b>stripping</b> of the bolt in the connection. The ultimate failure load decreased by 15. 9 and 17. 3 percent when loading in 15 and 30 from pure tension respectively. A two-step finite element model was created to simulate the behaviour of the threaded bolt and nut assembly in question. The relative displacement between the bolt and the nut in an initial model of the guard rail and post with an unthreaded connection was enforced on a separate model of the bolt and nut with threads. A full model including the threaded connection was created and compared to the two-step model. The results indicate that the behaviour prior to failure is controlled by deformations in the guardrail, post and washers. Failure is controlled by the threaded bolt, and the ultimate load is highly dependent on the bolt material. It is possible to model the bolted connection, subject to combined tension and shear loading conditions, with an acceptable degree of accuracy. A consistent failure mode can be achieved with both the two-step model and the full model. The ultimate loads experienced in the two-step model were in close proximity to the experimental results in some load combinations. The full model was close to the laboratory results in most load combinations, where the deviation from the average failure load in pure tension was 1. 1 - 2. 7 percent. </p...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{presents}} an experimental and numerical {{study on the}} behaviour of Flow-Drilling Screw (FDS) connections under various quasi-static loading conditions. The behaviour and fracture of the connections were closely studied by means of tests on simple coupons joined with a single connector and component tests. Single-connector tests were performed on both two- and three-layered specimens. Cross tests in three loading directions, lap-joint tests and peeling tests were conducted for both configurations. The two-layered cross tests were used to calibrate two different macroscopic models. The first model was a point-connector model developed for self-piercing rivets (SPR), while {{the other was a}} material model developed for spot welds. Two different assemblies of three-layered cross tests were used to calibrate the SPR model for three-layered FDS connections. All models were validated by simulations of the lap-joint and peeling tests. A component test was performed to validate the two-layered macroscopic models for complex loading situations. In the single-connector tests, shear-dominated loading situations generally produced higher forces than tension-dominated. Failure in the connections were mostly caused by pull-out from the bottom sheet. For the three-layered crosses and lap-joint specimens failure due to fracture of the screw itself, near the screw-head, was observed. In the component, all screws experienced both rotation and one-sided <b>thread</b> <b>stripping.</b> The spotweld model was able to represent the stiffness and maximum force in some tests, but failure occurred too early in all simulations. The macroscopic model developed for SPR connections generally gave a good representation of the results, except under-predicting the force in peeling. The macroscopic model of the three-layered specimens showed some acceptable results, but under-estimated the forces in peeling, and over-estimated both force and displacement for the lap-joint. The macroscopic models gave an acceptable representation of maximum force in the component test, but were not able to accurately represent the stiffness observed in the experiments. To develop a point-connector model for FDS more work is necessary. The SPR model seems reliable for two-layered connections, but a model for three-layered connections requires further calibration, especially for shear-dominated loading cases. The spotweld model shows promising results, but further optimisation of the parameters must be conducted to conclude. </p...|$|E

Once the <b>threads</b> <b>stripped</b> out, the horizontal stabilizer assembly was then subjected to aerodynamic forces it was not designed to withstand, and finally, the overstressed stabilizer assembly failed completely. Based on the time since the last inspection of the jackscrew assembly, the NTSB determined that the nut threads had deteriorated at [...] per 1,000 flight‑hours, much faster than the expected wear of [...] per 1,000 flight‑hours. Over {{the course of the}} investigation, the NTSB considered a number of potential reasons for the substantial amount of deterioration of the nut threads on the acme screw, including the substitution by Alaska Airlines (with the approval of the aircraft manufacturer McDonnell Douglas) of Aeroshell 33 grease instead of the previously approved lubricant, Mobilgrease 28. The use of Aeroshell 33 was found not to be a factor in this accident. Insufficient lubrication of the components was also considered as a reason for the wear. Examination of the jackscrew and acme nut revealed that no effective lubrication was present on these components {{at the time of the}} accident. Ultimately, the lack of lubrication and resultant excessive wear of the acme nut threads were determined to be the direct causes of the accident.|$|R

While most compositional analysis of metal wrappings has been done with SEM-EDS, some have also supplemented this with wavelength dispersive X-ray spectrometry (WDS) quantitative analysis of the interiors of the metal strips to get better results on the minor elements which may be below the minimum detection limits of SEM-EDS [17].
