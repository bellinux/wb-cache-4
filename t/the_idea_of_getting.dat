Eno, who was credited in the tour programme for the [...] "Video Staging Concept", explained his vision for the tour: [...] "the idea to make a stage set {{with a lot of}} different video sources was mine, to make a chaos of uncoordinated material happening together... <b>The</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> <b>getting</b> away from video being a way of helping people to see the band more easily ... this is video as a way of obscuring them, losing them sometimes in just a network of material." ...|$|E

[...] Bell also talked about the cliffhanger involving Simmons being absorbed by a Kree monolith: [...] "When we first started talking about the Monolith, we knew that it needed to present a threat and we needed to demonstrate some of that threat and the promise of more story...

500|$|When older Neighbours viewers {{expressed}} their concern {{about a young}} unwed couple moving in together, producers decided to have them marry instead. On-screen, neither family approved of Scott and Charlene's plan to move in together, but when Scott learned his father was only 18 when he got married, Scott found the solution to their problem and asked Charlene to marry him. Minogue said Charlene was shocked at first, but she became [...] "very excited" [...] about <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> <b>getting</b> married. She continued, [...] "She knows {{they want to live}} together and they have had so much trouble getting their parents' approval that I suppose getting married seems the logical thing to do. They will be together anyway, so they may as well finalise it." [...] After getting over her initial shock, Madge gave the couple her blessing to get married. Minogue and Donovan both agreed that they would not get married so young, and Donovan thought that younger couples should live together first. He also believed that Scott was rushing into things. Scott and Charlene were married during [...] "Episode 523", which was first broadcast on 1 July 1987 to two million Australian viewers.

Rater described that she got the idea after being told {{that her husband had}} to undergo a craniotomy. She noted that the plan for the episode was to focus on Ellis' inner feelings, mainly her fright, frustration and stress. [...] "The concept of someone with this disease having a lucid day is real. The disease varies for everyone, but experts we talked to said that patients have bad days and good days and then sometimes they have great days where it seems like they are their old selves. Maybe it's a moment, maybe an hour, for some a whole afternoon, but we were fascinated with <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> <b>getting</b> this time, this gift, and knowing that it's only temporary. What would you do with that one day? And what would it mean for Meredith?", stated Rater, explaining the premise of the episode. She also stated that [...] "the cool idea" [...] to have Meredith and Ellis connect again had been considered for almost a year before the actual concept of the episode was written, after numerous attempts to include the storyline in other episodes that [...] "didn't feel quite right": [...] "If you're going to give Meredith her mother back and then take her away again, you'd better have a pretty good reason." [...] Rater also explained that, in her vision, the episode introduces a new period in the interns' lives, focusing on their finding an identity as surgeons, becoming more central than {{in the beginning of the}} season, which revolved around the aftermath of Denny Duquette (Jeffrey Dean Morgan)'s death and Meredith's involvement in the love triangle between her, Shepherd and Finn Dandridge (Chris O'Donnell).|$|E

It has similar introductory chords to [...] "The Boy Is Mine" [...] (1998) by Brandy Norwood and Monica. [...] "This Cannot Be Love" [...] has a progressive uptempo melody which continues to gather pace {{over the course of the}} song, while in the lyrics Lopez [...] "asks if true love exists." [...] When asked what inspired some of the album's records, Lopez told The Advocate, that whenever she records a new album she always thinks of dance music as it is popular in the gay community and club cultures. She said songs like [...] "This Cannot Be Love"have musicality similar to her worldwide hit, [...] "Waiting for Tonight" [...] (1999), which was well received by the LGBT community. [...] " [...] talks about <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> <b>getting</b> lazy in love. You know how we do that?

We had done this slow building up to where as many as a thousand people might be coming to see us in some places, which for us was a huge deal, so we thought we'd try to see if maybe we could get the records out to more people." [...] "In {{the past year or so}} we've seen bands like Green Day and Season to Risk turning up at the Walmart in Brookfield, Missouri", [...] remarked bassist Karl Alvarez. [...] "We really like <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> <b>getting</b> our records in places where people go who aren't hip to the mom-and-pop record stores that traditionally carry the independents. People forget that punk rock was on the majors early on with bands like Iggy and the Ramones.

Originally, Leone wanted Enrico Maria Salerno (who had dubbed Eastwood's voice for the Italian versions of the Dollars Trilogy films) or Charles Bronson to play Angel Eyes, but the latter was already committed to playing in The Dirty Dozen (1967). Leone thought about working with Lee Van Cleef again: [...] "I said to myself that Van Cleef had first played a romantic character in For a Few Dollars More. <b>The</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> <b>getting</b> him to play a character who was the opposite of that began to appeal to me."

Stacey writes Martin a letter revealing that Arthur is Kush's son, but decides not to send it, however a nurse finds it and gives it to Martin; Martin is heartbroken. Stacey begs for his forgiveness, but he goes to America, returning a few weeks later and they reunite. Stacey is allowed a home visit, where she meets Kyle again. He explains that he is transgender and he used to be her sister but is now her brother. Stacey accepts and supports him and allows him to stay at her and Martin's flat. Stacey says she no longer wants to be Martin's [...] "not-wife" [...] and proposes to him, which he accepts, and tells Kush he can be part of Arthur's life, but Kush later decides he does not want to be Arthur's role model.
