40|$|In {{this paper}} we propose a {{framework}} of verb semantic description in order to organize different granularity of similar-ity between verbs. Since verb mean-ings highly depend on their arguments we propose a verb thesaurus on the ba-sis of possible shared meanings with predicate-argument structure. Motiva-tions of this work are to (1) construct a practical lexicon for dealing with alter-nations, paraphrases and entailment re-lations between predicates, and (2) pro-vide a basic database for statistical learn-ing system as well as a theoretical lex-icon study such as Generative Lexicon and Lexical Conceptual Structure. One of the characteristics of our description is that we assume several granularities of semantic classes to characterize verb meanings. The <b>thesaurus</b> <b>form</b> allows us to provide several granularities of shared meanings; thus, this gives us a further re-vision for applying more detailed analy-ses of verb meanings. ...|$|E

40|$|The {{ability of}} {{computers}} to store data is unlimited. As a result, {{we have at}} our service as much data as we want, {{but at the same}} time emerges the problem of converting them in useful information and knowledge. There are many cases where this information is required to be perceived directly and quickly. The visualization of data is the way to take advantage of the strongest human sense, in order to achieve our goal. Data visualization is the graphical representation of data, aiming to reveal the complex information at a glance. In this paper, the visualization of the research field of four professors of ATEI of Thessaloniki is attempted. The general idea of visualization, as well as the implementations of some real examples, is also presented. For the data mining, the tf-idf weighting scheme is used upon the words of a corpus, for the extraction of the important concepts. The creation of a thesaurus including the interesting concepts, is compulsory. The counting of their occurrences is done by writing a program in Java. Finally, the vector array which is created, together with the <b>thesaurus,</b> <b>forms</b> the input for the VOS viewer, which is a program for creating knowledge domain visualization maps...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{reports a}} {{full-scale}} linkage of noun senses between two existing lexical resources, namely WordNet and Roget's <b>Thesaurus,</b> to <b>form</b> an Integrated Lexical Resource (ILR) {{for use in}} natural language processing (NLP). The linkage was founded on a structurally-based sense-mapping algorithm. About 18, 000 nouns with over 30, 000 senses were mapped. Although exhaustive verification is impractical, we show that {{it is reasonable to}} expect some 70 - 80 % accuracy of the resultant mappings. More importantly, the ILR, which contains enriched lexical information, is readily usable in many NLP tasks. We shall explore some practical use of the ILR in word sense disambiguation (WSD), as WSD notably requires a wide range of lexical information. ...|$|R

40|$|Introduction. This study {{sought to}} answer three questions: 1) Would the level of domain {{knowledge}} significantly affect the user's search behavior? 2) Would the level of domain knowledge significantly affect search effectiveness, and 3). What would be the relationship between search behaviour and search effectiveness? Method. Participants {{were asked to rate}} their familiarity with 200 thesaurus terms to measure their level of domain knowledge. They also searched on three assigned topics using the COMPENDEX database. Data were collected through pre- and post-search questionnaires, <b>thesaurus</b> term rating <b>form,</b> computer logs, and search session printouts. Analysis. Twenty-two engineering and science students' data were analysed both quantitatively and qualitatively. Quantitative analysis included both descriptive statistics and statistical testing, while the qualitative analysis was on the use of terms in queries. Results. As the level of domain knowledge increases, the user tends to do more searches and to use more terms in queries. However, the search effectiveness remained the same for all participants. Conclusion. The level of domain knowledge seems to have an effect on search behaviour, but not on search effectiveness, and search behaviour {{does not seem to be}} related to search effectiveness. The findings are limited by the small sample size and need to be confirmed in further studies...|$|R

The subject of the research is the electronic catalog of the Scientific Library of the Odessa I. I. Mechnikov National University. The purpose of work is development of a technique of edition of sections of the thesaurus. In 2012 the Scientific Library of the Odessa I. I. Mechnikov National University has moved to the new software ABIS Absotheque Unicode which allowed to improve (to simplify) search in the electronic catalog. The department of scientific processing {{and the organization of}} catalogs carried out edition of sections of the <b>thesaurus,</b> instructions are <b>formed,</b> and the edition technique is developed, process of editing is studied. Drawing up the thesaurus of subject headings is carried out by means of loans from full tables BBC for scientific libraries. Even if he has no clear idea and profound knowledge of a search subject, simplifies correctly made subject headings for the reader and does more effective thematic search. The main finding of the work is in need of continuous editing subject headings that simplifies and does more comfortable search in the electronic catalog for the user of library.
