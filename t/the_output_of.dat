5|$|The Euclidean {{algorithm}} proceeds in {{a series}} of steps such that <b>the</b> <b>output</b> <b>of</b> each step is used as an input for the next one.

30|$|As a result, one {{of these}} two P-point RFFT is {{redundant}} which can be eliminated, while <b>the</b> <b>outputs</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> eliminated P-point RFFT can be obtained by simply conjugating <b>the</b> <b>outputs</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> retained P-point RFFT.|$|R
30|$|In {{the same}} wind farm, the {{relationship}} between <b>the</b> <b>outputs</b> <b>of</b> different wind turbines is strongly correlated, the correlation coefficient is 1; and {{the relationship between}} <b>the</b> <b>outputs</b> <b>of</b> different wind farms is mutually independent, the correlation coefficient is thus 0.|$|R
5|$|The Student and Instructor {{models were}} also {{introduced}} in the late 1960s. They were designed to teach the piano in the classroom. By connecting <b>the</b> <b>output</b> <b>of</b> a network of student models, the teacher could listen to each student in isolation on the instructor model, and send an audio backing track to them. This allowed the teacher to monitor individual students' progress.|$|E
5|$|The {{complete}} pilot's course initially lasted six months, {{split into}} two months each of elementary, intermediate and advanced instruction. Ground subjects were also taught and each trainee had to fly at least 150 hours to qualify.

30|$|Similarly, in {{the same}} PV station, the {{relationship}} between <b>the</b> <b>outputs</b> <b>of</b> different PV modules has a correlation coefficient of 1; {{and the relationship between}} <b>the</b> <b>outputs</b> <b>of</b> different PV stations is mutually independent with correlation coefficient equal to 0.|$|R
30|$|Since integrators in a continuous-time {{control system}} serve as memory devices, <b>the</b> <b>outputs</b> <b>of</b> such integrators can be {{considered}} as the variables that define the internal state of the dynamic system.

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>output</b> <b>of</b> a SGD may be {{digitized}} and/or synthesized: digitized systems play directly recorded {{words or}} phrases while synthesized speech uses text-to-speech software that can carry less emotional information but permits {{the user to}} speak novel messages by typing new words. Today, individuals {{use a combination of}} recorded messages and text-to-speech techniques on their SGDs. However, some devices are limited to only one type of output.|$|E
5|$|There are {{two primary}} {{alternatives}} for configuring this conversion equipment; centralised and string inverters, although {{in some cases}} individual, or micro-inverters are used. Single inverters allows optimizing <b>the</b> <b>output</b> <b>of</b> each panel, and multiple inverters increases the reliability by limiting the loss of output when an inverter fails.|$|E
5|$|VK3RTV is an {{experimental}} Amateur Television repeater located on Mt Dandenong {{to the east}} of Melbourne. In late September 2009 the former single analog channel was converted to a 2 channel digital system. <b>The</b> <b>output</b> <b>of</b> the transmitter is on 446.5MHz which can be received on some set top boxes and digital televisions. Both channels are transmitted in standard definition.|$|E

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>output</b> power <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{transmitter}} {{is defined}} as the power during sync pulse. (Real output power is variable depending on the content.) But <b>the</b> <b>output</b> power <b>of</b> <b>the</b> transmitting equipment and <b>the</b> <b>output</b> power <b>of</b> <b>the</b> antenna are two different quantities. <b>The</b> <b>output</b> power <b>of</b> <b>the</b> antenna is known as ERP which is actually the transmitter power times the antenna gain.|$|R
5|$|According to the Montour County Multi-jurisdictional Hazard Mitigation Plan, a {{major failure}} in the Lake Chillisquaque Dam could cause damage to several nearby communities, such as Strawberry Ridge and Washingtonville. It {{could also result in}} a {{decrease}} in <b>the</b> <b>output</b> <b>of</b> the Montour Power Plant, causing a brownout in the area. A severe failure of the dam is considered by the Multi-jurisdictional Hazard Mitigation Plan to be the most dangerous threat to Montour County.|$|E
5|$|An outward {{shift of}} the PPF results from growth of the {{availability}} of inputs, such as physical capital or labour, or from technological progress in knowledge of how to transform inputs into outputs. Such a shift reflects, for instance, economic growth of an economy already operating at its full productivity (on the PPF), which means that more of both outputs can now be produced during the specified period of time without sacrificing <b>the</b> <b>output</b> <b>of</b> either good. Conversely, the PPF will shift inward if the labor force shrinks, the supply of raw materials is depleted, or a natural disaster decreases the stock of physical capital.|$|E
5|$|Bute {{was closely}} {{involved}} in the developments across Glamorganshire {{during the first half}} of the 19th century. The region saw tremendous economic and social changes in a short period of time. The population almost trebled in the first forty years of the century and industrial outputs soured, with <b>the</b> <b>output</b> <b>of</b> pig iron increasing from 34,000 to 277,000 tons between 1796 and 1830. Industry and mining replaced agriculture as the main sources of work. In driving forward and responding to these changes, Bute transformed his South Wales estate into a major industrial enterprise.|$|E

5|$|Cadmium is {{a common}} {{impurity}} in zinc ores, and it is most often isolated during the production of zinc. Some zinc ores concentrates from sulfidic zinc ores contain up to 1.4% of cadmium. In the 1970s, <b>the</b> <b>output</b> <b>of</b> cadmium was 6.5 pounds per ton of zinc. Zinc sulfide ores are roasted {{in the presence of}} oxygen, converting the zinc sulfide to the oxide. Zinc metal is produced either by smelting the oxide with carbon or by electrolysis in sulfuric acid. Cadmium is isolated from the zinc metal by vacuum distillation if the zinc is smelted, or cadmium sulfate is precipitated from the electrolysis solution.|$|E
5|$|During the 1930s the Japanese {{government}} {{adopted an}} ultranationalist militancy {{with a view}} to greatly expand the Japanese Empire. Japan withdrew from the League of Nations in 1934, renouncing its treaty obligations. After withdrawing from the Washington Naval Treaty, which limited the size and power of capital ships, the Imperial Japanese Navy began their design of the new Yamato class of heavy battleships. Their planners recognized Japan would be unable to compete with <b>the</b> <b>output</b> <b>of</b> U.S. naval shipyards should war break out, so the 70,000ton vessels of the Yamato class were designed to be capable of engaging multiple enemy battleships at the same time.|$|E
5|$|During {{the early}} 1940s, Coggins {{obtained}} more work producing war pictures for other magazines, including {{a series of}} double-page spreads for the controversial newspaper PM, and illustrations for The Saturday Evening Post. Throughout the war years, most of <b>the</b> <b>output</b> <b>of</b> many large corporations was reserved for materiel production; however, management were keen to promote their connection {{to the war effort}} and keep their name before the buying public until they could resume peacetime sales. Coggins received advertising commissions from such corporations including Elco, Koppers, US Steel, and Westinghouse. He also received commissions from the U.S. War Department for aircraft recognition charts, and he was intrigued to later find these charts used during his army basic training.|$|E

5|$|Early filters {{utilised}} {{the phenomenon}} of resonance to filter signals. Although electrical resonance had been investigated by researchers from a very early stage, it was at first not widely understood by electrical engineers. Consequently, the much more familiar concept of acoustic resonance (which in turn, can be {{explained in terms of}} the even more familiar mechanical resonance) found its way into filter design ahead of electrical resonance. Resonance can be used to achieve a filtering effect because the resonant device will respond to frequencies at, or near, to the resonant frequency but will not respond to frequencies far from resonance. Hence frequencies far from resonance are filtered out from <b>the</b> <b>output</b> <b>of</b> the device.|$|E
5|$|Early {{photovoltaic}} systems output decreased {{as much as}} 10%/year, but as of 2010 the median degradation rate was 0.5%/year, with modules made after 2000 having a significantly lower degradation rate, so that a system would lose only 12% of its output performance in 25 years. A system using modules which degrade 4%/year will lose 64% of its output during the same period. Many panel makers offer a performance guarantee, typically 90% in ten years and 80% over 25 years. <b>The</b> <b>output</b> <b>of</b> all panels is typically warranteed at plus or minus 3% {{during the first year}} of operation.|$|E
5|$|Four bee {{families}} (Andrenidae, Colletidae, Halictidae, and Apidae) {{contain some}} {{species that are}} crepuscular. Most are tropical or subtropical, {{but there are some}} which live in arid regions at higher latitudes. These bees have greatly enlarged ocelli, which are extremely sensitive to light and dark, though incapable of forming images. Some have refracting superposition compound eyes: these combine <b>the</b> <b>output</b> <b>of</b> many elements of their compound eyes to provide enough light for each retinal photoreceptor. Their ability to fly by night enables them to avoid many predators, and to exploit flowers that produce nectar only or also at night.|$|E
50|$|In practice, several such {{centrifuges}} {{are connected}} in series. Each centrifuge receives one input and produces two output lines, corresponding to light and heavy fractions. The input of each centrifuge is <b>the</b> <b>output</b> (light) <b>of</b> <b>the</b> previous centrifuge and <b>the</b> <b>output</b> (heavy) <b>of</b> <b>the</b> following stage.
