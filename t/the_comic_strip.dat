5|$|Fun Home: A Family Tragicomic is a 2006 graphic memoir by the American {{cartoonist}} Alison Bechdel, {{author of}} <b>the</b> <b>comic</b> <b>strip</b> Dykes to Watch Out For. It chronicles the author's childhood and youth in rural Pennsylvania, United States, focusing on her complex {{relationship with her}} father. The book addresses themes of sexual orientation, gender roles, suicide, emotional abuse, dysfunctional family life, {{and the role of}} literature in understanding oneself and one's family. Writing and illustrating Fun Home took seven years, in part because of Bechdel's laborious artistic process, which includes photographing herself in poses for each human figure.|$|E

50|$|Unlike <b>the</b> <b>comic</b> <b>strips,</b> {{which are}} made with short jokes, the movie is not made {{with a series of}} short shots but with a big storyline.

Boogie also lacks in <b>the</b> <b>comic</b> <b>strips</b> a female sidekick: although Marcia does exist in such media, she's just one more of many others secondary characters abused or insulted by Boogie. The Marcia character in the film collects into a single character situations of many others. She was also designed as a femme fatale, despite the lack of such characters in the work of Fontanarrosa.|$|R

5|$|Other major plot {{elements}} were the 1937 marriage of Winnie to engineer Will Wright and {{the disappearance of}} Will during World War II, leaving a pregnant Winnie behind. This realistic and unfortunate situation was too risqué for some newspapers: The Baltimore Sun dropped the strip early in 1941 because of the pregnancy of Winnie. <b>The</b> <b>comic</b> <b>strip</b> changed significantly over the years; with Winnie working in the fashion industry after the war, seemingly as a widow until her husband returned after a few decades. She took on various other jobs and endeavors over the years, including {{a stint in the}} Peace Corps.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>comic</b> <b>strip</b> began {{serialisation}} in Le Petit Vingtième on 9 August 1934 as Les Aventures De Tintin Reporter En Extrême-Orient (The Adventures of Tintin in the Far East). It began serialisation in France in Cœurs Vaillants from 29 December 1935, {{and later}} in the Swiss magazine L'Écho Illustré. Alongside protagonists Tintin and Snowy, Hergé also included the detectives Thomson and Thompson in the story, who had been introduced in the previous story. He also alluded to the movie that Tintin had witnessed being filmed in Cigar, Rastapopoulos' The Sheik's House, having characters enter a cinema where it was being screened.|$|E
5|$|Kurtzman, a cartoonist, {{created the}} series at the {{culmination}} of his career. He had launched Mad magazine, worked briefly for Playboy publisher Hugh Hefner and {{on a series of}} solo and collaborative projects, then returned to working for Hefner with Little Annie Fanny. Each episode of <b>the</b> <b>comic</b> <b>strip</b> was designed and written by Kurtzman and rendered in oil, tempera, and watercolor by Elder. Hefner edited each episode, often requiring detailed changes to ensure that the series remained true to the magazine's editorial style. Critical reaction was mixed, with most praising the elaborate, fully painted comic, but some dismissing it as falling short of Kurtzman's full potential. The complete series was first collected into two volumes in 2000 and 2001 by Dark Horse Comics.|$|E

In <b>the</b> <b>comic</b> <b>strips</b> featuring Eega Beeva, Goofy {{only makes}} very few appearances and Eega acts as Mickey's sidekick instead. In {{the first two}} strips of the storyline Mousepotamia in July 1950, it is explained that Eega is homesick. Therefore, {{he returns to the}} cave where Mickey found him.

50|$|Gunnar Persson (born 1933) is a Swedish {{cartoonist}} {{and comic}} creator. He {{is the son}} of Elov Persson, creator of one of Sweden's oldest <b>comic</b> <b>strip</b> characters, Kronblom.

5|$|Hanna {{was given}} the {{opportunity}} to direct his first cartoon in 1936; the result was To Spring, part of the Harman-Ising Happy Harmonies series. The following year, MGM decided to terminate their partnership with Harman-Ising and bring production in-house. Hanna was among the first people MGM hired away from Harman-Ising to their new cartoon studio. During 1938–1939, he served as a senior director on MGM's Captain and the Kids series, based upon <b>the</b> <b>comic</b> <b>strip</b> of the same name (an alternate version of the Katzenjammer Kids that had resulted from a 1914 lawsuit). The series did not do well; consequently, Hanna was demoted to a story man and the series was canceled. Hanna's desk at MGM was opposite that of Joseph Barbera, who had previously worked at Terrytoons. The two quickly realized they would make a good team. By 1939 they had solidified a partnership that would last over 60 years. Hanna and Barbera worked alongside animation director Tex Avery, who had created Daffy Duck and Bugs Bunny for Warner Bros. and directed Droopy cartoons at MGM.|$|E
5|$|Remi {{developed}} {{a love of}} cinema, favouring Winsor McCay's Gertie the Dinosaur and the films of Charlie Chaplin, Harry Langdon and Buster Keaton; his later work in <b>the</b> <b>comic</b> <b>strip</b> medium displayed an obvious influence from them in style and content. Although not a keen reader, he enjoyed the novels of British and American authors, such as Huckleberry Finn, Treasure Island, Robinson Crusoe and The Pickwick Papers, {{as well as the}} novels of Frenchman Alexandre Dumas. Drawing as a hobby, he sketched out scenes from daily life along the edges of his school books. Some of these illustrations were of German soldiers, because his four years of primary schooling at the Ixelles Municipal School No. 3 coincided with the First World War, during which Brussels was occupied by the German army. In 1919, his secondary education began at the secular Place de Londres in Ixelles, but in 1920 he was moved to Saint-Boniface School, an institution controlled by the archbishop where the teachers were Roman Catholic priests. Remi proved a successful student, being awarded prizes for excellence. He completed his secondary education in July 1925 as the top of his class.|$|E
