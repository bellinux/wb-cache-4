I've had one negative remark—that I should be tried for treason—and one caller on C-SPAN said that I was an anti-Semite. My most troubling experience has been the rejection of my offers to speak, for free, about the book on university campuses with high Jewish enrollment and to answer questions from students and professors. I have been most encouraged by prominent Jewish citizens and members of Congress who have <b>thanked</b> <b>me</b> privately for presenting the facts and some new ideas.|$|E
500|$|Bakshi {{is quoted}} as saying that he had [...] "mixed feeling" [...] about Jackson's adaptations, {{although}} he had not seen the films. [...] "In some respects I feel good that Peter Jackson continued and went on, and in some respects I feel bad that Saul Zaentz, the producer, and various people never called me, <b>thanked</b> <b>me,</b> or asked my permission to do the movie. [...] has anyone sent me a bottle of wine, on the tremendous success. [...] But I have more feelings on the business side of that than I do on the creative side. I'm glad Peter Jackson had a movie to look at—I never did. And certainly there's a lot to learn from watching any movie, both its mistakes and when it works. So he had a little easier time than I did, and a lot better budget." ...|$|E
500|$|The U.S. {{announcement}} {{of support for}} Khánh helped to deter ARVN officers from joining Phát and Đức, who decided to give up. Westmoreland had spoken to Đức and reported to Washington that he [...] "in no uncertain terms ... informed him [...] that MACV, the U.S. Mission, and the U.S. Government did not support in any way his move, [...] advised that he get his troops moved out of town [...] immediately. He said that he understood and <b>thanked</b> <b>me.</b> He {{seemed to be a}} shaky and insecure young man." [...] Đức mistakenly thought that Kỳ and his subordinates would be joining the coup, but he later realized his misjudgement. When he found out he had been tricked into thinking the plotters had great strength, he gave up. According to an anonymous source, Đức was alarmed by Phát's strong statements during his radio broadcast, which made him reconsider his participation in the coup.|$|E
