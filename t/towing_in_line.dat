50|$|Weeks and his Marines of the 4th Platoon disembarked from Kane; twenty men and two {{officers}} loaded onto one Higgins landing craft while the remaining ten loaded onto two rubber boats, which were <b>towed</b> <b>in</b> <b>line</b> astern to the Higgins boat. During the first 2000 yards, due to heavy seas, the towing rings were {{pulled out of}} both rubber boats and the Marines attempted to maintain the movement by grasping the towline and bracing their feet against the rubber cross pieces.|$|R

The coracles are <b>towed</b> <b>in</b> a <b>line</b> behind a motor boat, like beads on a string, to their fishing ground. There the fisherman lay fishing nets in the sea before another tow returns them with their catch.|$|R
50|$|Submarines tow long sonar arrays {{to detect}} ships, {{and can even}} {{recognise}} different propeller noises. The sonar arrays need to be accurately positioned so they can triangulate direction to targets (e.g. ships). The arrays do not <b>tow</b> <b>in</b> a straight <b>line,</b> so fluxgate magnetometers are used to orient each sonar node in the array.|$|R

40|$|The {{concept of}} using an {{unmanned}} towed glider for high altitude scientific research {{had been previously}} proposed. This paper examines the feasibility of this concept by determining what impact the various characteristics of the tow line, glider and tow aircraft have on tow line drag. A description of the analysis and computer code used to generate the results is given. The parameters examined were glider altitude, tow aircraft glider separation distance, velocity, tow line drag coefficient and tow line material properties. The results from the analysis show that the tow line drag increases significantly with tow aircraft/glider separation. The drag increased from 940 N (211 lb) with a tow aircraft/glider separation of 3 km to 11, 970 N (2691 lb) with a tow aircraft/glider separation of 10 km. The results also show that by varying some of the initial assumptions significant reductions <b>in</b> <b>tow</b> <b>line</b> drag and weight can be obtained. The variables which had the greatest effect on reducing the tow line drag were the decrease <b>in</b> <b>tow</b> aircraft/glider separation distance, the increase <b>in</b> <b>tow</b> <b>line</b> strength and the decrease in glider Mach number...|$|R
25|$|Movements over 30 {{kilometers}} (daily horse travel limit) {{were particularly}} slow and complex. Longer hauls were relegated to trucks at first opportunity, while horses persisted at divisional level and in auxiliary units. Horse transports were particularly inadequate in deep offensive operations, {{just like they}} were in 1914. American trucks supplied to the Soviets allowed operations up to 350 kilometers away from the railhead, a distance impossible for horse-drawn sleighs. Likewise, replacement of field artillery horses with jeeps allowed <b>towing</b> 120-mm mortars <b>in</b> <b>line</b> with advancing troops, another tactic not possible with horses.|$|R
40|$|When {{conducting}} marine seismic surveys it {{is important}} to know the vertical profile of the seismic streamer. Typically the streamer has a density that is different from the seawater; therefore the streamer is held at depth by depth control units, and the streamer׳s tail is held at the surface by a tail buoy. In this paper, a semi-analytical solution is presented. It is the first-order solution for the profile of a streamer, <b>towed</b> <b>in</b> a straight <b>line,</b> at a constant speed. The solution is adapted to describe the streamer shape when there are significant changes in cable density due to the presence of components over small regions. The resulting profiles have good agreement with a numerical solution evolved to the steady state...|$|R

50|$|Privately, Cartland took an {{interest}} in the early gliding movement. Although aerotowing for launching gliders first occurred in Germany, she thought of long-distance <b>tows</b> <b>in</b> 1931 and did a 200-mile (360 km) <b>tow</b> <b>in</b> a two-seater glider. The idea led to troop-carrying gliders. In 1984, she was awarded the Bishop Wright Air Industry Award for this contribution.|$|R
