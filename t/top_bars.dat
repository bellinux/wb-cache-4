25|$|Acarine mites are {{commonly}} controlled with grease patties (typically made {{from one part}} vegetable shortening mixed with three to four parts powdered sugar) placed on the <b>top</b> <b>bars</b> of the hive. The bees come to eat the sugar and pick up traces of shortening, which disrupts the mite's ability to identify a young bee. Some of the mites waiting to transfer to a new host remain on the original host. Others transfer to a random bee—a proportion of which will die of other causes before the mite can reproduce.|$|E
2500|$|Syndrome 1 [...] Abnormal {{trembling}} of {{the wings}} and body occurs. The bees cannot fly, and often crawl {{on the ground and}} up plant stems. In some cases, the crawling bees can be found in large numbers (1000+). The bees huddle together {{on the top of the}} cluster or on the <b>top</b> <b>bars</b> of the hive. They may have bloated abdomens due to distension of the honey sac. The wings are partially spread or dislocated.|$|E
2500|$|In his apiary, Dzierzon {{studied the}} social life of honeybees and {{constructed}} several experimental beehives. In 1838 he devised the first practical movable-comb beehive, which allowed manipulation of individual honeycombs without destroying {{the structure of}} the hive. The correct distance between combs had been described as 1½ inches from the center of one top bar {{to the center of the}} next one. In 1848 Dzierzon introduced grooves into the hive’s side walls, replacing the strips of wood for moving <b>top</b> <b>bars.</b> The grooves were 8×8mm—the exact average between ¼ and ⅜ inch, which is the range called the [...] "bee space." [...] His design quickly gained popularity in Europe and North America. On the basis of the aforementioned measurements, [...] (May 1852) in Thuringia and L.L. Langstroth (October 1852) in the United States designed their frame-movable hives.|$|E

5000|$|A {{growing number}} of amateur beekeepers are {{adopting}} various top-bar hives similar to the type commonly found in Africa. <b>Top</b> <b>bar</b> hives were originally used as a traditional beekeeping method in Greece and Vietnam with a history dating back over 2000 years. These hives have no frames and the honey-filled comb is not returned after extraction. Because of this, the production of honey {{is likely to be}} somewhat less than that of a frame and super based hive such as Langstroth or Dadant. <b>Top</b> <b>bar</b> hives are mostly kept by people who are more interested in having bees in their garden than in honey production per se. Some of the most well known top-bar hive designs are the Kenyan <b>Top</b> <b>Bar</b> Hive with sloping sides, the Tanzanian <b>Top</b> <b>Bar</b> Hive with straight sides, and Vertical <b>Top</b> <b>Bar</b> Hives, such as the Warre or [...] "People's Hive" [...] designed by Abbe Warre in the mid-1900s.|$|R

50|$|Medals {{that are}} {{intended}} to be hung from a ribbon also include a small suspension piece at the crest with which to loop a suspension ring through. It is through the ring that a ribbon is run or folded so the medal may hang pendent. Medals pinned to the breast use only a small cut of ribbon that {{is attached to a}} top bar where the brooch pin is affixed. <b>Top</b> <b>bars</b> may be hidden under the ribbon so they are not visible, be a plain device from which the ribbon attaches, or may even be decorative to complement the design on the medal. Some <b>top</b> <b>bars</b> are elaborate and contain a whole design unto themselves.|$|E
5000|$|A {{beekeeper}} {{can make}} <b>top</b> <b>bars</b> from any plain wood. The <b>top</b> <b>bars</b> are usually 1¼ inches to 1⅜ inches (32-35 mm) wide, depending on local {{conditions and the}} type of bee to be housed. Combs can be handled individually. The depth of the bar and the length of the bar can be whatever the beekeeper wants, but usually between 17" [...] and 20". The depth of the top bar hive should be 12" [...] or less. If deeper, the weight of the comb filled with honey tends to cause it to fall off the bar {{into the bottom of the}} hive. The bees will lose access to this during the winter cluster in the hanging combs, thus increasing their likelihood of starving.|$|E

50|$|Although guidebooks {{for use in}} Africa often give precise {{dimensions}} for the Kenyan hive, {{and encourage}} beekeepers to keep their equipment of uniform and interchangeable sizes, {{one of the main}} selling points of the KTBH among proponents from English speaking countries {{is the fact that it}} can be made to practically any size and shape, as long as the <b>top</b> <b>bars</b> have an appropriate width.|$|E
50|$|The {{angle of}} the sloped sides is most {{commonly}} recommended to be 30 degrees. The width of the <b>top</b> <b>bars</b> {{is the sum of}} comb thickness and one measure of beespace.

5000|$|It is {{important}} to give the bees a clear starting point to build comb on each top bar. Some TBH beekeepers fashion their <b>top</b> <b>bars</b> with a V-shaped bottom to guide the comb building. Alternatively, some use a table saw to cut two closely spaced slots along the long axis of each new top bar. Either type of guide, wax line or grooves, gives bees a place {{to hold on to}} with their hooked feet. This allows a substantial [...] "drape" [...] of bees to form, which is the beginning of comb building.|$|E
50|$|In 1814, Petro Prokopovych, {{the founder}} of {{commercial}} beekeeping in Ukraine, invented {{one of the very}} first beehive frames.

In 1848 Dzierzon introduced grooves into the hive's side walls replacing the strips of wood for moving <b>top</b> <b>bars.</b> The grooves were 8 x 8 mm, the spacing later termed bee space. The Langstroth hive was the first successful top-opened hive with movable frames. Langstroth hive was however a direct descendant of Dzierzon's hive designs.|$|E
