500|$|Hubbard's war {{service has}} great {{significance}} in the history and mythology of the Church of Scientology, as {{he is said to}} have cured himself through techniques that would later underpin Scientology and Dianetics. According to Moulton, Hubbard told him that he had been machine-gunned in the back near the Dutch East Indies. Hubbard asserted <b>that</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> had been damaged as well, either [...] "by the flash of a large-caliber gun" [...] or when he had [...] "a bomb go off in my face". Scientology texts say that he returned from the war [...] "linded with injured optic nerves, and lame with physical injuries to hip and back" [...] and was twice pronounced dead.|$|E

They {{resolved}} {{to stay in the}} house and wait for the arrival of the king's men.

He refused to be taken prisoner, [...] "against that only he would defend himself with his sword".|$|E
500|$|Producer Nik Korda noted how helpful {{it was to}} have Sean Gunn and Krystian Godlewski portray Rocket and Groot on set, as it {{provided}} references for lighting and on-set performances to the animators. When creating Groot, MPC realized early on <b>that</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> would be essential in maintaining the character's human qualities, as his face couldn't move in the way that humans' do. MPC visual effects supervisor Nicolas Aithadi explained that, [...] "When you look at humans what makes the eyes interesting is the imperfections – trying to make these two irises not aimed at the same place – trying to make them strange and look more human." [...] Textures for Groot came from a number of sources, including inspiration from a botanical garden in London, and the character was modeled as individual branches, rigged individually, to simulate a muscle system for the character.|$|E
500|$|Soap Opera Magazine {{attributed}} {{the success of}} Todd to Howarth's face and skill as an actor. In February 1998, the magazine stated, [...] "Although the scar that traverses his face while he plays Llanview's dark prince isn't real, the menacing intensity Roger Howarth can so effortlessly convey with his eyes and furrowed brow are frighteningly authentic." [...] Soap Opera Weekly called his presence [...] "hypnotic" [...] and stated <b>that</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> relayed his focus. [...] The magazine added that Howarth [...] "has given Todd such a deliciously frightening edge we hope he wreaks more havoc in Llanview". [...] Marla Hart of the Chicago Tribune stated that [...] "it has been an unexpected pleasure to watch actor Roger Howarth as a lost soul in search of spiritual redemption". Hart speculated that the darkness Howarth brought to the role made him interesting to watch and was responsible for his Emmy win in 1994.|$|E

Doctors observing Domery saw no signs of mental illness and although illiterate, he was considered of normal intelligence by his crewmates and by the prison doctors who studied him. Despite eating vast amounts of food, it was noted by the doctors studying him that he never vomited, other than when fed large amounts of roasted or boiled meat. He showed no outward signs of ill health, and doctors observing him noted <b>that</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> were lively and his tongue clean. His pulse was regular at around 84BPM, and his body temperature normal. His muscles were normally formed, but observed by doctors to be weaker than usual, although during his time in the army he had marched 14French leagues (approximately 25mi/42km) in a day with no ill effects.|$|E
500|$|The Russian {{characters}} {{from the start}} of the episode came from a [...] "great" [...] Russian acting community in Vancouver, British Columbia who had defected from the Soviet Union. Both Lea and Laurie Holden were required to learn Russian for the first scene following the opening credits. Alex Shostak Jr., who portrayed Dmitri, worked 12–14 hours a day; make-up was applied to give the appearance <b>that</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> and mouth had been sewed up, and a small straw was pushed between his lips to give him water. During the filming of the episode, he was [...] "literally" [...] blind and guided by the crew members throughout the filming of his scenes. Shostak provided the translation for his own lines from English to Russian. Holden and Lea worked diligently together to perfect their lines in Russian. Holden explained, [...] "we'd come up with these fun ways to test ourselves to know if we had really nailed it. Show tunes come to mind, but I also remember this one time my dialect coach had me call a Russian friend of his on his cell phone to see if he could understand me. I passed the test." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1989, Lionel visits Smallville {{to buy the}} Ross Creamed Corn company {{immediately}} before a meteor shower occurs. Twelve years later during season one, Lionel exiles his son Lex Luthor (Michael Rosenbaum) to Smallville to run LuthorCorp's local fertilizer plant as a test. When Lex makes a profit {{for the first time}} in years, Lionel closes the plant and blames Lex's poor managerial skills. Lionel later confronts his son at the Luthor mansion when Lex tries to orchestrate an employee buyout to save the fertilizer plant. When strong winds force debris to smash through the mansion, Lionel is pinned under a fallen support beam and Lex hesitates to save his father. In Season two, Lex saves Lionel but loses his sight because of Lex's judgment to rush into surgery. Season two's first half shows Lionel as blind. Lex and Lucas Luthor (Paul Wasilewski)—Lionel's illegitimate son—devise a plan to uncover Lionel's deception; it is revealed that Lionel was blind but <b>that</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> healed and he intentionally neglected to tell anyone so he could watch how they acted around him. Season two's second half shows Lionel is aware of the Kawatche caves and tries to unlock the mysterious symbols there, to the dismay of Clark Kent (Tom Welling).|$|E

500|$|Thomas Moulton, Hubbard's {{executive}} {{officer on the}} USS PC-815, testified in 1984 that Hubbard had {{said that he had}} been shot in the Dutch East Indies, and that on another occasion Hubbard had told him <b>that</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> had been damaged by the flash of a large-caliber gun. Hubbard himself told Scientologists in a taped lecture that he had suffered eye injuries after having had [...] "a bomb go off in my face." [...] He told Robert Heinlein, the science fiction writer, that [...] "both of his feet had been broken (drumhead-type injury) when his last ship was bombed." [...] According to Heinlein, Hubbard said that he [...] "had had a busy war – sunk four times and wounded again and again". Hubbard was said to have been [...] "twice been pronounced dead" [...] and to have spent a year in a naval hospital which he [...] "utilized in the study of endocrine substances and protein". The techniques that he developed [...] "made possible not only his own recovery from injury, but helped other servicemen to regain their health". On another occasion, Hubbard said that he had been hospitalized because [...] "I was utterly exhausted. I'd just been in combat theater after combat theater, you see, with no rest, no nothing between." ...|$|E
500|$|Industrial Zen has {{received}} generally favorable reviews from music critics. John Kelman from All About Jazz called the album a [...] "perfect confluence of [...] divergent interests". He also {{thought that the}} album was proof that despite the criticism for McLaughlin's [...] "occasionally unsuccessful aspirations", {{he is able to}} [...] "show <b>that</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> and ears remain fully open". Stuart Nicholson from Jazzwise was highly favorable of Industrial Zen; calling it [...] "one of his most exciting and dangerous albums in a long while", Nicholson noted that McLaughlin's ability to [...] "bring [...] a variety of influences" [...] into his music allowed him to create a comprehensive album. A writer from Billboard noted that McLaughlin was [...] "vibrant reinventing" [...] his career with Industrial Zen; the same critic also noted that the record has [...] "clarity, focus and surprise". In a more mixed opinion, AllMusic's Richard S. Ginell awarded the album three out of five stars. He praised [...] "Mother Nature" [...] as a standout on the album but found it to be [...] "the only track that really sticks in the memory". David R. Adler, writing for JazzTimes, found McLaughlin to be [...] "in good form" [...] on Industrial Zen.|$|E
2500|$|From {{the age of}} ten, Eugene {{had been}} brought up {{for a career in}} the church; a {{personal}} choice of the King, basing the decision on the young Prince's poor physique and bearing.

2500|$|Tolkien was not {{consistent}} in describing Túrin's eyes. According to some texts [...] "he had {{the beauty of}} his mother and the eyes of his father", which were blue, while in other Túrin is said to have inherited the grey eyes of his mother. It is also stated <b>that</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> were bright, and that [...] "few indeed could challenge the eyes of Túrin in set will or in wrath." [...] Thus it is possible that he inherited the [...] "elven-light ... hard to endure" [...] of his mother's eyes.|$|E
2500|$|The pirates {{were given}} their {{last chance to}} show why they should be spared execution, with most simply {{claiming}} ignorance and pleading for mercy. May argued that, being [...] "a very sickly man," [...] he had [...] "never acted in all the voyage," [...] while Bishop reminded the court that he was [...] "forced away," [...] and, being only eighteen years of age during the 1694 mutiny, desired mercy. Joseph Dawson, the only defendant to plead guilty, was granted a reprieve. The remainder of the death sentences were upheld. Sparkes was the only pirate to publicly express some regret, but not for piracy, which was of [...] "lesser concern"—instead, he was repentant for the [...] "horrid barbarities he had committed, though only on {{the bodies of the}} heathen," [...] implying that he had participated in the violation of the women aboard the Mughal ships. His [...] "Last Dying Words and Confession" [...] declared <b>that</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> were [...] "now open to his crimes," [...] and he [...] "justly suffered death for such inhumanity." ...|$|E
2500|$|Dev Anand and Suraiya met Peck for {{the first}} time at Mumbai's Willingdon Club, after the Filmfare Awards in 1954, on Peck's {{stopover}} from a schedule at Sri Lanka after shooting for The Purple Plain. He knew of the [...] "Indian Star" [...] as an actor, more so probably because his romance with Suraiya was grabbing the headlines, and they had a chat. The second time they met was in Rome when Dev Anand was on his way back from the Venice Film Festival, he visited him on the set of Roman Holiday. [...] "I was returning from the Venice film fest. I stopped my car and joined the crowd watching the shoot, hoping <b>that</b> <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> would fall on me. As expected, he nodded and I walked up to him. He remembered me and we exchanged pleasantries." [...] The third meeting was at London on the set of Moby Dick. However, Suraiya asked for an exclusive meeting with her idol at her house. Though Anand says jealousy was natural for anyone in love, he didn't mind that he was not invited. [...] "I didn't quite feel anything. It wasn't as if they were going to fall in love or make love. Even if they would have, it wouldn't have mattered. I was mature enough. Moreover, he wasn't my rival. I too was a big star by then," [...] says Anand.|$|E
