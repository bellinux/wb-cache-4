5|$|By the 15th century, English {{was back}} in fashion among all classes, though much changed; the Middle English form showed many signs of French influence, both in {{vocabulary}} and spelling. During the English Renaissance, many words were coined from Latin and Greek origins. Modern English has extended this custom of flexibility, {{when it comes to}} incorporating words from different languages. <b>Thanks</b> <b>in</b> <b>large</b> part to the British Empire, the English language is the world's unofficial lingua franca.|$|E
5|$|While details {{regarding}} Richard Cantillon's {{life are}} scarce, {{it is thought}} that he was born sometime during the 1680s in County Kerry, Ireland. He was son to land-owner Richard Cantillon of Ballyheigue. Sometime {{in the middle of the}} first decade of the 18th century Cantillon moved to France, where he attained French citizenship. By 1711, Cantillon found himself in the employment of British Paymaster General James Brydges, in Spain, where he organised payments to British prisoners of war during the War of Spanish Succession. Cantillon remained in Spain until 1714, cultivating a number of business and political connections, before returning to Paris. Cantillon then became involved in the banking industry working for a cousin, who at that time was lead-correspondent of the Parisian branch of a family bank. Two years later, <b>thanks</b> <b>in</b> <b>large</b> part to financial backing by James Brydges, Cantillon bought his cousin out and attained ownership of the bank. Given the financial and political connections Cantillon was able to attain both through his family and through James Brydges, Cantillon proved a fairly successful banker, specialising in money transfers between Paris and London.|$|E

They provided seed money for the university's Gaylord College of Journalism and Mass Communication which then constructed a new facility <b>thanks</b> <b>in</b> a <b>large</b> part to Gaylord donations.|$|R
25|$|The league regained some {{popularity}} by this year, <b>thanks</b> <b>in</b> <b>large</b> part to Barangay Ginebra's three PBA championships led by Eric Menk, Jayjay Helterbrand and Mark Caguioa.

50|$|The {{fluctuating}} {{performance of}} his army in 1643 was {{in contrast to the}} ascendancy of the Eastern Association. This was an alliance of pro-Parliament militiamen from Essex, Hertfordshire, Norfolk, Suffolk, Cambridgeshire, Huntingdonshire and Lincolnshire commanded by Edward Montagu, 2nd Earl of Manchester. One of their cavalry commanders was Oliver Cromwell. The Eastern Association established itself as a formidable fighting force <b>in</b> 1643, <b>thanks</b> <b>in</b> a <b>large</b> part to Cromwell's regiment, who became known as the 'Ironsides'.|$|R

60|$|Wulf {{throughout}} the day had fought close to Harold. Osgod had kept close beside him, and had warded off many a sweeping blow and cut down many a pressing enemy. At {{the end of the}} day his left arm hung useless by his side, well-nigh cleft off by the blow of a Norseman's sword. Wulf himself had escaped without a scratch, <b>thanks</b> <b>in</b> a <b>large</b> measure to his follower's watchfulness. When the battle was over he was one of the few thanes who gathered round Harold. The latter felt no exultation at this victory. It had cost him the flower of his army and numbers of his most valued thanes. It had cost him, too, the life of a brother, to whom in spite of his faults he had been deeply attached. He knew that there was before him a struggle even more serious than that from which he had just emerged a victor, and there was no saying how that struggle might end.|$|R
25|$|In the UK in this period, the BBC Radiophonic Workshop (established in 1958) came to prominence, <b>thanks</b> <b>in</b> <b>large</b> {{measure to}} their work on the BBC science-fiction series Doctor Who.

40|$|The eastern bluebird (Sialia sialis) {{was nearly}} {{eliminated}} during the mid 1900 ’s by habitat destruction, competition, and other human-related disturbances. However, {{the past few}} decades have seen an unprecedented resurgence <b>in</b> bluebird numbers <b>thanks</b> <b>in</b> a <b>large</b> part to the placement of bluebird nest boxes by concerned citizens. A study was conducted using geographic information system (GIS) technology to determine the optimal nest box locations for bluebirds in Minnesota by analyzing nest site selection in relation to the distance between nest boxes and elements of the landscape such as roads, buildings, water, trees, and other boxes. Thirty-five years worth of data of roughly 80 nest boxes from an existing study near Pierz, MN were provided by bluebird researchers Dave and Carol Fiedler of Buffalo, MN. Field work included marking the locations of the boxes with a global positioning system (GPS) as well as describing the landscape characteristics surrounding the box. Distances were measured using ortho-rectified aerial photographs with much of the display and analysis done using Arcview 3. 2 and ArcGIS. Each of the bluebird competitors was analyzed separately and then combined to develop buffer distances for ideal bluebird box placement...|$|R
2500|$|Hobbs {{ended the}} series with an {{aggregate}} of 662 runs {{at an average}} of 82.75, setting a new record number of runs for an individual batsman in a Test series. Jack Crawford, now living in Australia, was struck by the improvement in Hobbs since they had played together at Surrey, noting that he seemed to possess no weaknesses. In his review of the tour, Warner said: [...] "I have long since exhausted my vocabulary of praise in favour of Rhodes and Hobbs, and, <b>thanks</b> <b>in</b> a very <b>large</b> degree to their superlative work, our batting was eminently successful. Too much stress cannot be laid on what they accomplished, for in innings after innings they gave us a wonderful start. They were the backbone of the batting." [...] In addition, Hobbs ran out 15 batsmen and Warner praised his fielding at cover point. The Australians did not dare run when he fielded the ball for fear of the speed of his throw. In all first-class matches, Hobbs scored 943 runs at 55.47.|$|R

Jackson became a western hero, and building on his militia connections, Jackson built a strong political base and in 1828, Jackson was elected President.|$|E
25|$|Transit {{planning}} {{is crucial for}} a growing region. The Lexington area is growing in population, and is forecast to continue this trend. Transit service is currently expanding, <b>thanks</b> <b>in</b> <b>large</b> part to a dedicated tax that was passed in 2004. Along with the expansion of service and routes comes an increased amount of transit planning work. Regular transit planning duties include developing a Long Range Transit Plan, developing maps and statistical reports, updating Title VI documentation, and various other activities.|$|E
25|$|In 1958, the Braves again won the National League pennant {{and jumped}} {{out to a}} three games to one lead in the World Series against New York once more, <b>thanks</b> <b>in</b> part to the {{strength}} of Spahn's and Burdette's pitching.

40|$|General {{lighting}} {{is the next}} and largest ever market for LED light sources. However, for most segments, LEDs are still too expensive compared to incumbent technologies in term of both upfront and total ownership cost. The LED industry still has {{plenty of room for}} cost improvement. A more than 10 x reduction in both $/lum and $/lumen. hour is expected at the packaged LED level [1]. This can be achieved through a combination of technology and manufacturing improvements at both the frontend and backend levels. We will review the main opportunities for cost reduction and focus on the most recent and promising trends to give a complete overview of how innovation and manufacturing efficiency will help enabling massive adoption of solid state lighting. LED industry needs cost reduction to propel growth After a first wave of growth driven by cell phone keypads and small LCD backlight applications for handheld devices, the LED industry experienced phenomenal growth in 2010 (close to 70 % at the packed LED level) <b>thanks</b> to adoption <b>in</b> <b>large</b> LCD display applications (TV an...|$|R
25|$|The Fred Allen Show was radio's top-rated {{show of the}} 1946-47 season. Allen {{was able}} to {{negotiate}} a lucrative new contract as a result {{not only of the}} show's success, but <b>thanks</b> <b>in</b> <b>large</b> measure to NBC's anxiety to keep more of its stars from joining Jack Benny in a wholesale defection to CBS. The CBS talent raids broke up NBC's hit Sunday night, and Benny also convinced George Burns and Gracie Allen and Bing Crosby to join his move.|$|E
25|$|In 1935, the Bureau of Investigation {{was renamed}} the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI). In 1939, the FBI became {{pre-eminent}} {{in the field}} of domestic intelligence, <b>thanks</b> <b>in</b> <b>large</b> part to changes made by Hoover, such as expanding and combining fingerprint files in the Identification Division, to compile the largest collection of fingerprints to date, and Hoover's help to expand the FBI's recruitment and create the FBI Laboratory, a division established in 1932 to examine and analyze evidence found by the FBI.|$|E

25|$|The next {{attack on}} the English colonists took place at South Deerfield, in August of the same year. Throughout {{the rest of the}} 1675, the Native American forces had a string of victories, <b>thanks</b> <b>in</b> <b>large</b> part to {{skillful}} leadership of sachems like Metacomet, Muttawmp and Matoonas, who exploited their knowledge of local terrain to achieve surprise and often successfully ambushed colonial forces sent to track them down, much {{in the same way as}} happened in Wheeler's Surprise. However, 1675 ended with a significant defeat for the Native Americans, with the defeat of the Narragansetts in the Great Swamp Fight.|$|E
25|$|It was {{revealed}} through these proceedings that Van Zandt's annual {{income in the}} years before his death had climbed to over $100,000, <b>thanks</b> <b>in</b> <b>large</b> part to the royalties accrued from his songs being covered by Willie Nelson, Emmylou Harris, Merle Haggard, Cowboy Junkies, and other major music stars. After Van Zandt's death his road manager, Harold Egger, released video and audio recordings from the songwriter's concerts. An out-of-court settlement in 2006 granted the Van Zandts conditional control of Harold Eggers' mastered recordings while Harold retaining a 50% ownership of seven albums and some royalties for the remaining recordings.|$|E
25|$|Jacksonville's mostly {{conservative}} residents, however, {{objected to}} the hallmarks of the early movie industry, such as car chases in the streets, simulated bank robberies and fire alarms in public places, and even the occasional riot. In 1917, conservative Democrat John W. Martin was elected mayor on the platform of taming the city's movie industry. By that time, southern California was emerging as the major movie production center, <b>thanks</b> <b>in</b> <b>large</b> part to the move of film pioneers like William Selig and D.W.
