5|$|Enlightenment {{philosophy}} {{had developed}} Western Europeans’ interest in Greece, or rather in an idealised Ancient Greece, <b>the</b> <b>linchpin</b> <b>of</b> Antiquity, {{as it was}} perceived and taught. The Enlightenment philosophers, for whom the notions of Nature and Reason were so important, believed that these had been the fundamental values of Classical Athens. The Ancient Greek democracies, and above all Athens, became models to emulate. There they searched for answers to the political and philosophical problems of their time. Works {{such as those of}} Abbé Barthélemy, Voyage du Jeune Anacharsis (1788), served to fix definitively the image that Europe had of the Aegean.|$|E
5|$|Chauvel {{arrived on}} 12 May 1915 {{and took over}} the {{critical}} sector, which included Pope's Hill and Quinn's, Courtney's and Steele's Posts, from Colonel John Monash. Open to Turkish observation on two sides, these four advanced posts {{at the top of}} Monash Valley were <b>the</b> <b>linchpin</b> <b>of</b> the defence. Chauvel reorganised the defence, appointing permanent commanders for the posts. He also formed special sniper groups who eventually managed to suppress the Turkish snipers, making it safe even for mule trains to move up Monash Valley. Chauvel's brigade soon found itself under heavy pressure from the Turks. On 29 May 1915, the Turks fired a mine under Quinn's Post and broke into it. The permanent commander of the post, Lieutenant Colonel J. H. Cannan was absent on leave and the acting commander, Lieutenant Colonel G. J. Burnage was wounded in the fighting. Chauvel responded by bringing up reserves and appointing a temporary post commander, Lieutenant Colonel H. Pope, with orders to drive the Turks out at all costs. Major S. C. E. Herring was miraculously able to charge across the open practically unscathed, his attack having coincided with a Turkish one on another part of the post so that the Turkish machine gunners could not shoot without hitting their own men. There were in fact only about seventeen Turks in the post, who eventually surrendered. Chauvel's decision may have been the wrong one, but it was decisive; he was also lucky. For this action, he was mentioned in despatches.|$|E

40|$|Bibliography: leaves 99 - 105. Retrenchments {{have become}} {{increasingly}} prevalent in South Africa affecting those that are retrenched and the survivors of such a process. Despite survivors being <b>the</b> <b>linchpins</b> <b>of</b> future profitability, research on their experiences is limited in this country. This research followed a case study approach and examined survivor experiences in a South African alcoholic beverage organisation. Qualitative data was obtained through fourteen semi-structured interviews with employees who are retrenchment survivors. Following thematic analysis, three key themes emerged: survivor responses throughout the retrenchment process, survivor work attitudes and behaviours throughout the retrenchment process and survivor perceptions on {{the management of the}} process...|$|R

[...] Movements of alchemy, life-prolonging techniques, and the quest for [...] "immortality" [...] flourished, yet most mystical allusions remained firmly ground in the Zhuangzi. From the Zhuangzian perspective, the religious experience (etymologically, that which binds together) becomes a personal rapture that elevates one from the microcosmic to an altogether macrocosmic perspective - a perspective that affirms continuity as the fabric of unity - that somehow binds one to the totality of existence in a personal integration and affirmation of all.

25|$|Maddux was {{the jewel}} in the much-vaunted Braves trio of Maddux, Glavine, and Smoltz, who pitched {{together}} {{for over a}} decade as the core of one of the best pitching staffs {{in the history of the}} game.

The three pitchers were frequently augmented by other strong starters such as Steve Avery, Kevin Millwood, Denny Neagle, and Russ Ortiz. In 1995, they pitched the Braves to a World Series title. In 29 postseason games with Atlanta, Maddux had a 2.81 ERA and a 1.19 WHIP, but just an 1113 record.|$|E

25|$|By the 18th century, {{the port}} of Málaga, <b>the</b> <b>linchpin</b> <b>of</b> the city’s economy, was again {{one of the most}} {{important}} on Andalusia’s Mediterranean coast. Following the Decree of Free Trade in 1778 by King Charles III, which allowed the Spanish American ports to trade directly with ports in Spain, commercial traffic at the port increased further, and the population grew considerably. Major urban renovations were made in Málaga under the influence of the ideas of the European Enlightenment, bestowing on it many of its most characteristic features: the Cathedral, the harbour of the port and its Customs House, the Alameda, and the Antequera and Velez roadways. In 1783 a bayfront boulevard, the Paseo de la Alameda, a symbol of urban prosperity, was built on land reclaimed from the sea with sand dredged from the Guadalmedina River. By 1792 mansions had risen on either side of the avenue in the fashionable new residential area settled by the Málaga merchant class.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} {{recognizing}} the contribution made to development by grassroots women {{working on a}} voluntary basis in long term development projects. Using the example of healthcare, the paper problematizes the widespread move towards an increased reliance on voluntary and third sector provision. Drawing on literature around women’s community activism, the research considers the extent to which women carrying out health promotion work in Peru have taken on this role as more than “just voluntary work,” highlighting their long term commitment during {{more than a decade of}} health promotion activities. The paper develops debates around the professionalization of voluntary work, particularly considering the issue of economic remuneration for health promoters, and emphasizing the gendered nature of their voluntarism; concluding by questioning the sustainability of poor women’s long term, and largely unpaid, involvement as <b>the</b> <b>linchpins</b> <b>of</b> community development projects...|$|R
25|$|Against US {{forces the}} record is more mixed. There {{were a number of}} successes {{particularly}} in ambushes, sapper attacks and various other engagements. When entrenched in strong positions, they were able to exact a price on attacking American troops, before withdrawing to cross-border sanctuaries to fight another day. VC/NVA operations however were sometimes marked by very heavy casualties. Typical of these were the Tet attacks and the border battles that saw heavy losses against superior US air, ground and naval firepower. American strategic mobility, using airpower and helicopters also took a heavy toll and blunted several communist initiatives, most notably at the Ia Drang, Tet and other places. In general during the war, US forces caused far more casualties to the VC/NVA than the other way round. However, the communist forces were usually able to replenish their forces. Expansion of the battle-space over a wide area, and attrition over time however, <b>the</b> <b>linchpin</b> <b>of</b> their protracted war strategy, kept their forces intact until this formidable opponent withdrew.|$|E
25|$|Columbushaus was {{completed}} and opened in January 1933, {{the same month}} that the Nazi dictator Adolf Hitler (1889–1945) came to power. Hitler had big plans for Berlin, to transform it into the Welthauptstadt (World Capital) Germania, to be realised by his architect friend Albert Speer (1905–81). Under these plans the immediate vicinity of Potsdamer Platz would have got off fairly lightly, although the Potsdamer Bahnhof (and the Anhalter Bahnhof a short distance away) would have lost their function. The new North-South Axis, <b>the</b> <b>linchpin</b> <b>of</b> the scheme, would have severed their approach tracks, leaving both termini stranded {{on the wrong side}} of it. All trains arriving in Berlin would have run into either of two vast new stations located on the Ringbahn to the north and south of the centre respectively, to be known as Nordbahnhof (North Station) and Südbahnhof (South Station), located at Wedding and Südkreuz. In Speer's plan the former Anhalter Bahnhof was earmarked to become a public swimming pool; the intended fate of the Potsdamer Bahnhof has not been documented.|$|E

40|$|The {{political}} {{case for}} tort reform {{is based in}} large measure on the perception {{that there are too}} many frivolous law suits and too many excessive jury awards. Where there is considerable empirical evidence casting doubt on both these propositions, they remain <b>the</b> <b>linchpins</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> tort reform movement. Scholars, lobbyists, and legislators all have had a voice in the tort reform debates. The viewpoints of trial judges, however, have been largely absent. This is unfortunate because trial judges are the government officials with the closest view of the tort litigation system. They are the ones who see tort litigation on a day-in, day-out basis and are therefore uniquely qualified to comment on the extent of problems in the system. This study begins to fill this void by reporting on the views of Georgia Superior Court and State Court judges on tort litigation in their courts...|$|R

For scientists taking on the role of a PI represents an important landmark in their research career. Set in an Irish research system we found two main categories of influencing factors - push and pull. Pull factors are where the PI has more choice in choosing to become a PI, where as push factors is where the PI has less choice in choosing to become a PI. Pull factors we identified were control, career ambition and advancement, personal drive and ambition. Pull factors we identified were project dependencies and institutional pressures...|$|R
