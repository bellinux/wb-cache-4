5|$|The {{story begins}} as a girl named Sally and her unnamed brother, who serves as the narrator of the book, sit alone in their house on a cold, rainy day, staring wistfully out the window. Then they hear a loud bump which is quickly {{followed}} {{by the arrival of}} the Cat in the Hat, a tall anthropomorphic cat in a red and white striped hat and a red bow tie. The Cat proposes to entertain the children with some <b>tricks</b> <b>that</b> he knows. The children's pet fish refuses, insisting that the Cat leave. The Cat responds by balancing the fish on the tip of his umbrella. The game quickly becomes more complicated, as the Cat balances himself on a ball and tries to balance lots of household items on his limbs until he falls on his head, dropping everything he was holding. The fish admonishes him again, but the Cat in the Hat just proposes another game.|$|E

500|$|The Swansea {{coach in}} the {{immediate}} post-war period was Frank Barson, a notoriously aggressive character who was known as [...] "the centre-forward's graveyard" [...] in his playing days. Barson instructed Paul {{in the art of}} tackling during lengthy practise sessions, and made him aware of the <b>tricks</b> <b>that</b> a wily opponent could use to gain the upper hand in a physical battle. Paul went on to make 159 league appearances for Swansea in a four-year period, winning the Third Division South championship in 1948–49. An impressive appearance against top-flight club Arsenal in a 1950 FA Cup match resulted in the Londoners making an offer for the player, but Swansea turned it down.|$|E
500|$|Killen avouched {{that writing}} the episode's script {{was one of}} the more {{difficult}} processes of creating the series. He and his writing team would often get confused with exchanging and executing ideas for the script; as a result, they created outlines and distinguished them in green and red ink. Slade edited the language to better separate the ideas. [...] "So the things that are initially confusing to us when we are just trying to break story, I think by the time they reach an audience, so much {{attention has been paid to}} how to make it clear where you are that all of the little <b>tricks</b> <b>that</b> we needed sort of go away. And hopefully when you see it on the screen, you are pretty instantly oriented as to which world you are in." ...|$|E
500|$|Molly Longman of mic.com writes that, {{in terms}} of {{bridging}} the relationship between music and hallucinogens, the Beatles and the Beach Boys were the era's most pivotal acts. In 1965, the Beach Boys' leader Brian Wilson started exploring song composition while {{under the influence of}} psychedelic drugs, and after being introduced to cannabis in 1964 by Dylan, members of the Beatles also began using LSD. The considerable success enjoyed by these two bands allowed them the freedom to experiment with new technology over entire albums. Producer George Martin, who was initially known as a specialist in comedy and novelty records, responded to the Beatles' requests by providing a range of studio <b>tricks</b> <b>that</b> ensured the band {{played a key role in}} the development of psychedelic effects, including the drug-inspired drone on [...] "Ticket to Ride" [...] (1965).|$|E

It was directed by Marcos Siega, who is most notable for his work with Blink-182 and Papa Roach. In an interview with MTV, Wade talked about the idea behind the music video and said, [...] "This is the closest we'll probably ever come to being in a Tim Burton fantasy world. It was done in a real 'Jack and the Beanstalk' style. And Marcos used some camera <b>tricks</b> <b>that</b> make it look amazing. From far away, the stage set looked normal, {{but when you get}} closer you get smaller and it gets huge. We were being filmed in front of this bookcase that was like 150 feet high.

500|$|Hawke {{pursued a}} number of {{projects}} away from acting throughout the early 2000s. He made his directorial debut with Chelsea Walls (2002), an independent drama about five struggling artists living in the famed Chelsea Hotel in New York City. The film was critically and financially unsuccessful. A second novel, 2002's Ash Wednesday, was better received and made the New York Times Best Seller list. The tale of an AWOL soldier and his pregnant girlfriend, the novel attracted critical praise. The Guardian called it [...] "sharply and poignantly written... makes for an intense one-sitting read". The New York Times noted that in the book Hawke displayed [...] "a novelist's innate gifts... a sharp eye, a fluid storytelling voice and the imagination to create complicated individuals", but was [...] "weaker at narrative <b>tricks</b> <b>that</b> can be taught". In 2003 Hawke made a television appearance, guest starring in the second season of the television series Alias, where he portrayed a mysterious CIA agent.|$|E
500|$|Organizations such as World Animal Protection and the Whale and Dolphin Conservation Society {{campaign}} against the practice of keeping cetaceans, particularly killer whales, in captivity. In captivity, they often develop pathologies, such as the dorsal fin collapse seen in 60–90% of male killer whales. Captives have vastly reduced life expectancies, on average only living into their 20s. In the wild, females who survive infancy live 46 years on average, and up to 70–80 years in rare cases. Wild males who survive infancy live 31 years on average, and up to 50–60 years. Captivity usually bears little resemblance to wild habitat, and captive whales' social groups are foreign {{to those found in}} the wild. Captive life is also stressful due the requirement to perform circus <b>tricks</b> <b>that</b> are not part of wild killer whale behavior, as well as restricting pool size. Wild killer whales may travel up to [...] in a day, and critics say the animals are too big and intelligent to be suitable for captivity. Captives occasionally act aggressively towards themselves, their tankmates, or humans, which critics say is a result of stress. Dolphins are often trained to do several anthropomorphic behaviors, including waving and kissing—behaviors wild dolphins would rarely do.|$|E

500|$|The dog {{has been}} {{neglected}} or treated unfavorably {{by the family}} in some episodes. In [...] "Dog of Death" [...] (season three, 1992), he nearly dies of bloat and they decide to make budget cuts {{in order to pay}} for the required operation. Although the dog's life is saved, the family begins to feel the strain of their sacrifices and starts treating him badly, causing him to run away. He ends up in the possession of Mr. Burns, who trains him to become a vicious attack dog. Several days later, Bart stumbles upon the trained Santa's Little Helper and is attacked, but the greyhound eventually recognizes his old friend and stops. In [...] "The Canine Mutiny" [...] (season eight, 1997), Bart uses a fake charge card to buy a well-trained rough collie named Laddie from a mail-order catalog. Laddie learns many <b>tricks</b> <b>that</b> Santa's Little Helper is completely unable to perform, and the Simpson family nearly forgets about their old pet. Bart eventually gives Santa's Little Helper away instead of Laddie when repo men take back everything he fraudulently purchased. Feeling guilty about this disloyalty and bored with his too perfect new dog, Bart tries to get him back. When he finally finds him, Santa's Little Helper is serving as a seeing-eye dog for a blind man, but eventually decides to return to the family.|$|E
