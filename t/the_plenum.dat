5|$|Consequently, on 13April1961, HSA {{decided to}} conduct {{preliminary}} {{work on a}} supersonic derivative of the P.1127 {{under the guidance of}} Ralph Hooper. This would result in a new design, designated P.1150, which was 50% larger than the preceding P.1127; it was proposed that a new performance enhancing feature be adopted in the form of <b>the</b> <b>plenum</b> chamber burning (PCB)– essentially an afterburner – in the engine. The P.1150 proposal broadly resembled its P.1127 predecessor despite major changes being made, including its revised fuselage, the adoption of a thinner wing, and an advanced version of the Pegasus engine. The Bristol Siddeley BS100 engine was equipped with a similar arrangement of four swivelling exhaust nozzles, the front nozzles of which were to be equipped with PCB. According to aviation author Derek Wood, the P.1150 was to have been capable of Mach 1.3.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>plenum</b> {{put forward}} three points {{to solve the}} {{problems}} alleged by Tho; (1) to get party cadres to focus on technical economic and management responsibilities, (2) cadres were to be organized and get specialized training in economic and administrative fields to reequip them with information on how to run an increasingly complex economy, and (3) engineer a shift in the internal balance of power.In a Nhân Dân (The People) editorial, Lê Đức Thọ stressed the need to go beyond political slogans and remonstration to enhance the level of management skills of party cadres in party-level organizations. Lê Đức Thọ wanted to change the party's role in the economy from that of implementer to one of supervisor. The central leadership faced an obstacle; most party cadres had what the party leadership considered an outdated education from 20 to 30 years ago, while the party lacked young cadres. To solve this problem, the central party leadership began talking about the need to introduce personnel planning, a retirement age, rotation of officials and tenure length for cadres and sensitive posts.|$|E

50|$|The WPK 5th Central Committee held 19 plenary {{meetings}} from 1970 to 1980. <b>The</b> 1st <b>Plenum</b> on 13 November 1970 appointed Kim Il-sung as General Secretary, a 15-member Political Committee and a 9-member Secretariat. <b>The</b> 8th <b>Plenum</b> in February 1974 designated Kim Jong-il as Kim Il-sung's successor.|$|R
5000|$|Planning for the 9th National Congress {{began in}} August 1999 at <b>the</b> 7th <b>plenum</b> of <b>the</b> 8th Central Committee. Preparatory {{work for the}} {{congress}} began at <b>the</b> 8th <b>plenum</b> of <b>the</b> 8th Central Committee [...] "by assigning various organizational tasks to senior party officials." [...] After <b>the</b> 8th <b>plenum</b> several officials lost their post because of either disciplinary cases, government reshuffling or reassignment within the party. These changes were implemented because of widespread criticism of the Communist Party of Vietnam's (CPV) tackling of corruption, {{and in order to}} strengthen the coherence of national policy and its implementation. A statement issued by <b>the</b> 8th <b>plenum</b> stated that Ngô Xuân Lộc, a Deputy Prime Minister, and Cao Sĩ Kiêm, a party official working in the economic sector, had been given disciplinary warnings. In addition, <b>the</b> 8th <b>plenum</b> recommended to dismiss Ngô Xuân Lộc as a Deputy Prime Minister because of implication in the Thanh Long amusement park scandal. Cao Sĩ Kiêm on the other hand was criticised for mismanaging loans that resulted in a sudden increase in bad debts.|$|R

25|$|These {{plans were}} {{subsequently}} advanced at the Central Committee's Eighth Plenum (Fifth Congress) in June 1985. Acting to disperse economic decision making, <b>the</b> <b>plenum</b> resolved to grant production autonomy {{at the factory}} and individual farm levels. <b>The</b> <b>plenum</b> also sought to reduce government expenditures by ending state subsidies on food and certain consumer goods for state employees. It further determined that all relevant costs to the national government needed to be accounted for in determining production costs and that the state should cease compensating for losses incurred by state enterprises. To implement these resolutions, monetary organizations were required to shift to modern economic accounting. The government created a new dong in September 1985, and set maximum quotas for the amount permitted to be exchanged in bank notes. The dong also was officially devalued.|$|E
25|$|A further {{refinement}} to the facelift {{range was}} via the two GX models, with a 3mm wider bore in the throttle body (increased from 60mm to 63mm and mated to <b>the</b> <b>plenum</b> bore), helping {{to provide the}} additional 10PS over the earlier GR model engine. Whilst the GR model only continued to offer 4-speed auto and 5-speed manual into the 'facelift' era, the GX Sport and GX Sport Aero upgrade came either as 5-speed manual or 5-speed auto. On the GS and GR models aircon operation became manual from Feb 1997.|$|E

25|$|One of {{the oldest}} types of filters, the undergravel filters consist of a porous plate which is placed beneath the gravel {{on the base of}} the {{aquarium}} and one, or more, uplift tubes. Historically, undergravel filters have been driven via air displacement. Air stones are placed at the base of uplift tubes which force water out of the uplift tube creating negative pressure beneath the undergravel filter plate (also called <b>the</b> <b>plenum).</b> Water then percolates down through the gravel which itself is the filtration material. Greater flow rate of water through the gravel can be achieved via the use of water pump rather than air displacement.|$|E
25|$|The work-teams issue {{marked a}} decisive defeat for President Liu Shaoqi politically; it also {{signaled}} that disagreement {{over how to}} handle the unfolding events of the Cultural Revolution would break Mao from the established party leadership irreversibly. On August 1, the Eleventh Plenum of the Eighth Central Committee was hastily convened to advance Mao's now decidedly radical agenda. At <b>the</b> <b>plenum,</b> Mao showed outright disdain for Liu, repeatedly interrupting Liu as he delivered his opening day speech. For several days, Mao repeatedly insinuated that the Party's leadership had contravened his revolutionary vision. Mao's line of thinking received a lukewarm reception from the conference attendees. Sensing that the largely obstructive party elite was unwilling to fully embrace his revolutionary ideology, Mao went on the offensive.|$|E

500|$|In June 1956 Molotov {{was removed}} as Foreign Minister; on 29 June 1957, he was {{expelled}} from the Presidium (Politburo) after a failed attempt to remove Khrushchev as First Secretary. Although Molotov's faction initially won {{a vote in the}} Presidium, 7–4, to remove Khrushchev, the latter refused to resign unless a Central Committee plenum decided so. In <b>the</b> <b>plenum,</b> which met from 22 to 29 June, Molotov and his faction were defeated. Eventually he was banished, being made ambassador to the Mongolian People's Republic. Molotov and his associates were denounced as [...] "the Anti-Party Group" [...] but, notably, were not subject to such unpleasant repercussions as had been customary for denounced officials in the Stalin years. In 1960 he was appointed Soviet representative to the International Atomic Energy Agency, which was seen as a partial rehabilitation. However, after the 22nd Party Congress in 1961, during which Khrushchev carried out his de-Stalinisation campaign, including the removal of Stalin's body from Lenin's Mausoleum, Molotov (along with Lazar Kaganovich) was removed from all positions and expelled from the Communist Party. In 1962 all of Molotov's party documents and files were destroyed by the authorities.|$|E
500|$|As {{the meeting}} progressed, some delegates {{publicly}} {{demanded that the}} congress {{should be given the}} authority to elect the general secretary {{and the head of the}} Central Commission for Inspection. This was approved and a survey form which listed four possible candidates; Mạnh, Nguyễn Minh Triết, Nguyễn Văn An and Nguyễn Phú Trọng was created. Nguyễn Văn An withdrew his candidacy, knowing he would not be elected to the 10th Politburo because he was not elected to the 10th Central Committee. However, because of party rules which stated that the Central Committee after the congress elected the general secretary, the vote at the congress was considered a survey. Another version of the proceedings, that given by [...] Mạnh at the press conference after the congress, was that the 1,176 congress delegates were given a list of the elected members of the 10th Central Committee, and were given a free choice of electing any of them to the general secretaryship. After the congress, on 25 April, the 1st plenum of the Central Committee convened to elect the general secretary. The two leading candidates at the congress survey, Mạnh and Nguyễn Minh Triết, stood for election at <b>the</b> <b>plenum.</b> Mạnh was elected and Nguyễn Minh Triết was appointed state president.
