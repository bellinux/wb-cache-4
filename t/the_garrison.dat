5|$|Henry {{returned}} to the castle from Leicester in September, where another 600 Royalist soldiers soon joined him and its 60 man garrison, carrying out raids on Parliamentary convoys and <b>the</b> <b>garrison</b> at Coleorton. Plague broke {{out at the end}} of the year, forcing the besiegers to retreat to Leicester, while <b>the</b> <b>garrison</b> temporarily abandoned the castle buildings and occupied the neighbouring park. Once the epidemic passed, Parliament began to raid the town and Henry worked through Ferdinando to agree the surrender of the castle on good terms: this was achieved in February 1646, and allowed for the release of himself, <b>the</b> <b>garrison</b> and their weapons.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, a Byzantine fleet {{arrived and}} – after joining with the Venetian fleet – {{attacked}} the Norman fleet, which was again routed. <b>The</b> <b>garrison</b> at Dyrrhachium {{managed to hold}} out all summer, despite Robert's catapults, ballistae and siege tower. <b>The</b> <b>garrison</b> made continuous sallies from the city; on one occasion, Palaiologos fought all day with an arrowhead in his skull. Another sally succeeded in destroying Robert's siege tower.|$|E
5|$|While campaigning against Venetian forces, Skanderbeg {{managed to}} inflict a serious defeat on July 23, 1448, seriously {{weakening}} Venetian power in Albania. The siege of Svetigrad continued, however, and Marin Barleti {{writes that the}} Ottomans bribed a soldier to throw a dead dog into {{the well of the}} fortress, forcing <b>the</b> <b>garrison</b> to refuse to drink out of it. It is more likely, however, that the Ottomans had cut off the water supply and induced <b>the</b> <b>garrison</b> to surrender. Given the circumstance, Perlati promised a surrender if <b>the</b> <b>garrison</b> were allowed a safe passage through the Ottoman lines. Prince Mehmed suggested that <b>the</b> <b>garrison</b> should be promised safe passage and then massacred, but Murad rejected his son's proposal, in fear that the rebellion would only be intensified through such an act; he decided to instead return the garrisoning force to Skanderbeg. On July 31, 1448 <b>the</b> <b>garrison</b> of Svetigrad surrendered.|$|E

5|$|At {{the same}} time, Skanderbeg {{had been at}} war with Venice. Realizing the {{magnitude}} of his challenge, Skanderbeg attempted to relieve <b>the</b> <b>garrison</b> by engaging in skirmishes with the Ottoman army. His forces succeeded in inflicting heavy casualties on the Turkish forces through guerrilla-style attacks. Efforts were made by Skanderbeg to use intelligence forces, operating as far as Constantinople, to gather information on Murad's plans of action. Meanwhile, near Scutari, {{he had been able}} to defeat a Venetian force and managed to considerably weaken the Venetian presence in Albania. Despite these efforts, on July 31 <b>the</b> <b>garrison</b> of Svetigrad surrendered due to a disruption in the water supply. <b>The</b> <b>garrison</b> was spared and a force of Ottoman Janissaries was stationed inside the fortress instead. Two years later, Murad would march against Krujë, only to suffer a heavy defeat.|$|E
5|$|At {{the start}} of the English Civil War in 1642, {{fighting}} broke out around Portsmouth between the Royalist forces, led by Colonel George Goring, and Parliamentarians under the command of Colonel Richard Norton. Southsea Castle was held by the Royalist Captain Challoner, supported by a small garrison of eleven men and 14 guns, and Norton decided to attack the fortification with 400 infantry and two troops of cavalry. The assault took place at {{in the early hours of}} the morning on 5 September; <b>the</b> <b>garrison</b> had positioned their guns to point inland, so the attackers stormed the moat on the seaward side. They then demanded that <b>the</b> <b>garrison</b> surrender but Challoner, who had been drinking heavily with Goring the night before, refused to discuss this and asked them to return later in the day. A fresh assault began and <b>the</b> <b>garrison</b> surrendered without loss of life. The capture of the castle meant left Portsmouth's position untenable and the town surrendered. A significant Parliamentarian garrison was then installed in the castle to keep it from being retaken.|$|E

5|$|Belgian plans did {{not call}} for <b>the</b> <b>garrison</b> of the fort and the {{attached}} defending forces to fight a sustained battle against an attacking force; {{it was assumed that}} sufficient warning of an attack would be given so that the detachment on {{the eastern side of the}} canal could be withdrawn, the bridges destroyed and <b>the</b> <b>garrison</b> ready to fight a delaying action. The defending force would then retire to the main defensive positions along the River Dyle, where they would link up with other Allied forces.|$|E
5|$|Both sides claimed victory {{after the}} battle, with the JNA hailing the {{evacuation}} of <b>the</b> <b>garrison</b> as its greatest success. However, they achieved only part of their objectives; the JNA failed to secure the area surrounding the barracks or remove all the weapons and equipment in it, and the planned coordinated advance against Turanj also failed. Croatian forces failed in their primary objective: containing <b>the</b> <b>garrison.</b> Nonetheless, the JNA threat from the Logorište barracks was removed (freeing up forces assigned to the blockade of the barracks) {{and a large number}} of weapons were captured.|$|E
5|$|Brough, {{guarded by}} six knights, {{put up a}} strong resistance, but William took the outer defences and then besieged the keep, {{threatening}} to execute <b>the</b> <b>garrison</b> if the castle was not surrendered. The keep was set on fire, forcing the surrender of <b>the</b> <b>garrison,</b> including one knight who, according to the chronicler Jordan Fantosme, fought on first with spears and then wooden stakes, until finally overwhelmed. William then destroyed the remaining defences of the castle using Flemish mercenary troops. Henry II's forces defeated William {{at the battle of}} Alnwick and Brough Castle was recovered later in the year.|$|E

5|$|By early 1645 the war {{had turned}} decisively against the King, and in February, Parliamentary forces seized the county town of Shrewsbury. This exposed {{the rest of the}} region to attack, and in June a force of 800 Parliamentary {{soldiers}} pushed south towards Ludlow, attacking Stokesay en route. The Royalist garrison, led by Captain Daurett, was heavily outnumbered {{and it would have been}} impossible for them to effectively defend the new gatehouse, which was essentially ornamental. Nonetheless, both sides complied with the protocols of warfare at the time, resulting in a bloodless victory for the Parliamentary force: the besiegers demanded that <b>the</b> <b>garrison</b> surrender, <b>the</b> <b>garrison</b> refused, the attackers demanded a surrender for a second time, and this time <b>the</b> <b>garrison</b> were able to give up the castle with dignity.|$|E
5|$|Due to the {{extensive}} coastal defences erected by the Germans {{to protect the}} installation from a seaborne raid, {{it was believed that}} a commando raid from the sea would suffer heavy losses and give sufficient time for <b>the</b> <b>garrison</b> at the installation to destroy the Würzburg radar set. It was therefore decided that an airborne assault followed by seaborne evacuation would be the most practicable way to surprise <b>the</b> <b>garrison</b> of the installation, seize the technology intact, and minimise casualties to the raiding force.|$|E
5|$|Finally, on 20 August 1462, Enrique's son Juan Alonso de Guzmán, 1st Duke of Medina Sidonia {{succeeded in}} {{capturing}} Gibraltar after launching a surprise attack. His {{success in the}} brief Eighth Siege of Gibraltar was due to <b>the</b> <b>garrison</b> being greatly depleted after its men of rank had left for Granada, with their retinues, {{to pay homage to}} the newly enthroned sultan Abu l-Hasan Ali. An initial assault by the Count of Arcos was beaten back with many casualties on both sides, but the men of <b>the</b> <b>garrison</b> realised that in their depleted state they could not withstand a second assault. They offered to surrender on condition that <b>the</b> <b>garrison</b> and inhabitants of Gibraltar would be allowed to leave with their wives, children and movable goods, with compensation to be paid for the property that they left behind. Although the proposal was welcomed, it fell through due to rivalry between the Christian commanders. The Moorish inhabitants of Gibraltar retreated to the castle and surrendered after a few days to Medina Sidonia. They were expelled along with the city's Jewish population, to be replaced by Spanish Christians.|$|E

5|$|In July 1778, Clark {{and about}} 175 men crossed the Ohio River at Fort Massac and marched to Kaskaskia, {{capturing}} {{it on the}} night of July 4 without firing their weapons. The next day, Captain Joseph Bowman and his company captured Cahokia in a similar fashion without firing a shot. <b>The</b> <b>garrison</b> at Vincennes along the Wabash River surrendered to Clark in August. Several other villages and British forts were subsequently captured, after most of the French-speaking and Indian inhabitants refused to take up arms on behalf of the British. To counter Clark's advance, Hamilton recaptured <b>the</b> <b>garrison</b> at Vincennes, which the British called Fort Sackville, with a small force in December 1778.|$|E

By late 1644, the war turned against the King, and the Parliamentary forces based at nearby Coleorton had contained <b>the</b> <b>garrison</b> in the castle. King Charles passed through the castle in May 1645 on his way to besiege Leicester, but the following month his forces were defeated at the Battle of Naseby; the King briefly stayed at the castle once again as he retreated west.

5|$|Many {{members of}} <b>the</b> <b>garrison</b> tried to sneak aboard Leake's ships {{to escape the}} siege. The {{situation}} was precarious and was only worsened when a storm damaged many of Leake's ships on 4–5 December. By this time, <b>the</b> <b>garrison</b> was critically short of medicines and supplies. Many were sick or injured and too few remained to carry out repairs to the shell-damaged fortifications. Only 1,300 were healthy enough to man the defences. Their living conditions were increasingly grim; their shoes had worn out and many men wore makeshift sandals made from hay and straw.|$|E
5|$|Many of the cottages {{were now}} burning, {{obscuring}} {{the field of}} fire and driving the defenders out of their positions. Hearing the din of battle in Blenheim, Tallard {{sent a message to}} Marlborough offering to order <b>the</b> <b>garrison</b> to withdraw from the field.|$|E
