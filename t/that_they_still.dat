In 865, Khafaja led in person an expedition against the environs of Enna—which may signify that the Byzantines had retaken it, or <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>still</b> held forts in its vicinity—before moving onto Syracuse, but again his son Muhammad was defeated in an ambush, losing 1,000 men.|$|E

5|$|No further {{constitutional}} {{reforms were}} enacted during the Principate. The only development of any significance was the continuing slide towards monarchy, as the constitutional distinctions {{that had been}} set up by Augustus lost whatever meaning <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>still</b> had. Starting in 235, with the reign of the barbarian Emperor Maximinus Thrax, the Empire was put through a period of severe military, civil, and economic stress. The crisis arguably reached its height during the reign of Gallienus, from 260 to 268. The crisis ended with the accession of Diocletian in 284, and the abolishment of the Principate.|$|E
5|$|The {{second section}} of the Fourteenth Amendment punished, by reduced {{representation}} in the House of Representatives, any states that disenfranchised any male citizens over 21 years of age. By failing to adopt a harsher penalty, this signaled to the states <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>still</b> possessed the right to deny ballot access to blacks. Northern states were generally as averse to granting voting rights to blacks as Southern states. In the year of its ratification, only eight Northern states allowed blacks to vote. In the South, blacks were able to vote in many areas, but only through {{the intervention of the}} occupying Union Army. Congress had granted suffrage to the blacks in the territories in 1867 by passing the Territorial Suffrage Act.|$|E

In later interviews relating to Final Fantasy VII, multiple staff members including Nomura stated that the Compilation was only ever intended to extend to three games and a movie, ending with the release of Crisis Core.

5|$|If early {{tetrapods}} {{lived in}} freshwater, {{and if they}} {{lost the ability to}} produce urea and used ammonia only, they would have to evolve it from scratch again later. Not a single species of all the ray-finned fishes living today has been able to do that, so it is not likely the tetrapods would have done so either. Terrestrial animals that can only produce ammonia would have to drink constantly, making a life on land impossible (a few exceptions exist, as some terrestrial woodlice can excrete their nitrogenous waste as ammonia gas). This probably also was a problem at the start when the tetrapods started to spend time out of water, but eventually the urea system would dominate completely. Because of this it is not likely they emerged in freshwater (unless they first migrated into freshwater habitats and then migrated onto land so shortly after <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>still</b> retained the ability to make urea), although some species never left, or returned to, the water could of course have adapted to freshwater lakes and rivers.|$|E
5|$|Aquinas {{supported}} Augustine's {{view that}} evil is a privation of goodness, maintaining that evil has existence as a privation intrinsically found in good. The {{existence of this}} evil, Aquinas believed, can be completely explained by free will. Faced with the assertion that humans {{would have been better}} off without free will, he argued that the possibility of sin is necessary for a perfect world, and so individuals are responsible for their sin. Good is the cause of evil, but only owing to fault on the part of the agent. In his theodicy, to say something is evil is to say that it lacks goodness which means that it could not be part of God's creation, because God's creation lacked nothing. Aquinas noted that, although goodness makes evil possible, it does not necessitate evil. This means that God (who is good) is not cast as the cause of evil, because evil arises out of a defect in an agent, and God is seen to be without defect. Philosopher Eleonore Stump, considering Aquinas' commentary on the Book of Job, argues that Aquinas has a positive view of suffering: it is necessary to contrast Earth with heaven and remind humans <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>still</b> have the propensity to commit evil. Aquinas believed that evil is acceptable because of the good that comes from it, and that evil can only be justified when it is required in order for good to occur. Attempting to relieve God of responsibility for the occurrence of evil, Aquinas insisted that God merely permits evil to happen, rather than willing it. He recognised the occurrence of what seems to be evil, but did not attribute to it the same level of existence that he attributed to spirituality. Like Augustine, Aquinas asserted that humans bear responsibility for evil owing to their abuse of free will.|$|E
5|$|On March 13, amidst heavy {{fighting}} in the northern provinces of South Vietnam, General Ngô Quang Trưởng flew out to Saigon {{for a meeting with}} President Nguyễn Văn Thiệu. In this meeting, President Thiệu outlined his decision to abandon most of the provinces in I Corps Tactical Zone, and ordered General Trưởng to withdraw his forces towards the coastal regions of central Vietnam instead. In addition, the Airborne Division (South Vietnam) would be redeployed to the Mekong Delta region, where it could protect the nation's capital. Unwilling to concede the northern provinces to the enemy, General Trưởng tried unsuccessfully to convince President Thiệu to reverse his decision in the belief that he could hold onto I Corps, and recapture lost territories by using the Airborne and Marine Corps Divisions. After he returned to his headquarters that afternoon, General Trưởng decided to redeploy his forces instead of carrying out President Thiệu's order straightaway, for several reasons. Firstly, he wanted to convince the President that most South Vietnamese units were still intact, and <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>still</b> had the time to recapture lost territories. And secondly, General Trưởng did not want to create confusion amongst his subordinates, when the military situation in I Corps was still under control.|$|E

5|$|The {{episodes of}} Flywheel, Shyster, and Flywheel were recorded, {{but for many}} years it was thought the {{recordings}} had not been preserved. At {{the time of the}} broadcasts, pre-recorded shows were frowned upon by advertisers and audiences. However, in 1988, Michael Barson, who worked in the United States Copyright Office at the Library of Congress discovered that the scripts for twenty-five of the twenty-six episodes had been submitted to the Office, where they had been placed in storage. Nobody was aware <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>still</b> existed and their copyrights had not been renewed. This meant that Flywheel, Shyster, and Flywheel had fallen into the public domain. The scripts were published that same year by Pantheon in a book titled Flywheel, Shyster, and Flywheel: The Marx Brothers' Lost Radio Show, edited by Michael Barson and with an interview with Perrin. In October 1988, Flywheel, Shyster and Flywheel scenes were broadcast {{for the first time since}} the show went off the air in 1933 when National Public Radio, a non-profit media organization that provides content to public radio stations around the United States, aired an 18-minute recreation of Flywheel, Shyster and Flywheel in markets such as Chicago, Illinois, Dallas, Texas, and Los Angeles, California, using Washington, D.C.-based Arena Stage actors to perform the Chico and Groucho lead roles from the published scripts. Years later, three recordings of Flywheel, Shyster, and Flywheel were found, including a five-minute excerpt of Episode 24 and a fifteen-minute recording of Episode 25. A complete recording of Episode 26 exists and was broadcast on BBC Radio 4 in 2005.|$|E

25|$|Though {{extraversion}} and neuroticism seem to {{have the}} largest effect on personal happiness, other Big 5 personality factors have also been shown to correlate with happiness and subjective well-being.
