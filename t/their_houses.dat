5|$|The {{remaining}} {{members of the}} Sicilian aristocracy who still inhabit their ancestral palazzi are unable to make opening <b>their</b> <b>houses</b> to tourism {{a major source of}} income, unlike some Northern, especially English, counterparts. The local equivalent of the National Trust is very small, and there is much less local interest among the general population. The Princes, Marquesses, and Counts of Sicily still living in <b>their</b> <b>houses</b> dwell in splendid isolation, surrounded often by beauty and decay. It is only today both owners and the state are awakening to the possibility that if action is not taken soon it will be too late to save this particular part of the Sicilian heritage.|$|E

5|$|After the Croatian Serb forces, the JNA and the paramilitaries {{established}} their {{control in the}} village, the Croat population was required to wear white armbands and mark <b>their</b> <b>houses</b> using white sheets.

5|$|Although the Croatian {{government}} sponsored reconstruction {{efforts in}} and around Vukovar, the Serb-populated town centre remained in ruins until 2003. Both Croat and Serb residents believed the government had neglected it deliberately, in order to punish the Serb community. Human Rights Watch noted that, of 4,000 homes that had been rebuilt, {{none of them were}} inhabited by Serbs. Unemployment was high because of the destruction of the town's major industries, and many of the inhabitants could not sell <b>their</b> <b>houses.</b> Most houses and many of Vukovar's historic buildings had been restored by 2011.|$|E

40|$|Purposes of {{this paper}} are to {{establish}} the model for explaining Japanese young's housing demand and to derive the implication to guide Japanese housing policy. For this, I investigate the determinants of their tenure choice, considering <b>their</b> <b>housing</b> independence from <b>their</b> parents. On the basis of Japanese features, I would rather regard <b>their</b> <b>housing</b> self-pay as <b>their</b> independence than regard their nest-leaving as <b>their</b> independence. Here, <b>housing</b> self-pay means people bear <b>their</b> <b>housing</b> cost by themselves. As a result, this paper finds the strong relationship between Japanese young's financial ability and <b>their</b> <b>housing</b> independence. Just as I thought, recent severe economic environment of Japanese young discourages them from entering housing market. This result also shows their complete dependent choice is an essential element for considering the magnitude of <b>their</b> <b>housing</b> demand. Furthermore, my findings validate Japanese housing policy of recent years. ...|$|R
