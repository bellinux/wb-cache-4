The Philistines learned why Samson burned their crops and burned Samson's wife and father-in-law to death in retribution.|$|E
5|$|After being {{linked to}} girlfriend Dahn Bryan, {{a model and}} actress, early in his NHL career, Bure shared a {{relationship}} with tennis star and fellow Russian Anna Kournikova. The two met in 1999 {{when she was still}} linked to Bure's former Russian teammate Sergei Fedorov. Bure and Kournikova were reported to have been engaged in 2000 after reporter Andrew Greven took a photo of <b>them</b> <b>together</b> <b>in</b> a Florida restaurant where Bure supposedly asked Kournikova to marry him. As the story made headlines in Russia, where they were both heavily followed in the media as celebrities, Bure and Kournikova both denied any engagement. Kournikova, 10 years younger than Bure, was 18 years old at the time. The following year, Kournikova and Fedorov were married in Moscow, though they soon divorced.|$|E
5|$|For his String Quartet, Lutosławski had {{produced}} only the four instrumental parts, refusing to bind {{them in a}} full score, because he was concerned that this would imply that he wanted notes in vertical alignment to coincide, {{as is the case}} with conventionally notated classical ensemble music. The LaSalle Quartet, however, specifically requested a score from which to prepare for the first performance. Bodman Rae relates that Danuta Lutoslawska solved this problem by cutting up the parts and sticking <b>them</b> <b>together</b> <b>in</b> boxes (which Lutosławski called mobiles), with instructions on how to signal in performance when all of the players should proceed to the next mobile. In his orchestral music, these problems of notation were not so difficult, because the instructions on how and when to proceed are given by the conductor.|$|E

5|$|Four Quartets {{is a set}} of four poems {{written by}} T. S. Eliot that were {{published}} individually over a six-year period. The first poem, Burnt Norton, was written and published with a collection of his early works following the production of Eliot's play Murder in the Cathedral. After a few years, Eliot composed the other three poems, East Coker, The Dry Salvages, and Little Gidding, which were written during World War II and the air-raids on Great Britain. The poems were not collected until Eliot's New York publisher printed <b>them</b> <b>together</b> <b>in</b> 1943. They were first published as a series in Great Britain in 1941 to 1942 towards the end of Eliot's poetic career.|$|E
5|$|In 1888 and 1889, Othniel Charles Marsh {{described}} the first well preserved horned dinosaurs, Ceratops and Triceratops. In 1890 Marsh classified <b>them</b> <b>together</b> <b>in</b> the family Ceratopsidae {{and the order}} Ceratopsia. This prompted Cope to reexamine his own specimens and to realized that Triceratops, Monoclonius, and Agathaumas all represented a single group of similar dinosaurs, which he named Agathaumidae in 1891. Cope redescribed Monoclonius as a horned dinosaur, with a large nasal horn and two smaller horns over the eyes, and a large frill.|$|E
5|$|In December 2012, Network Rail {{appointed}} BAM Nuttall as {{its main}} contractor. The Network Rail team which {{worked on the}} line was {{essentially the same as}} the one which delivered the Airdrie-Bathgate Rail Link in 2009. A Network Rail spokesman confirmed that lessons learned from the previous project had been applied to the Borders project, such as better coordination between the different teams by having <b>them</b> <b>together</b> <b>in</b> one office in Newtongrange. In June 2013, the design contract for the line was awarded to URS which agreed to design new bridges, stations and roads, as well as the refurbishment of existing bridges and the provision of engineering support, for £3.5 million.|$|E

5|$|The museum’s plan {{concept was}} {{developed}} by architect, Laurie Baker, without charging any fee, because of his interest in rural architectural design. Baker's approach included the use of local materials and the adaptation of artisanal production methods suited to the environment. Benny Kuriakose was the architect at site. Kuriakose, retained the main “spatial types and syntax”, but altered the layout plan. The {{southern part of the}} museum was devoted to restoring and recreating native structures and putting <b>them</b> <b>together</b> <b>in</b> a sequence in the order of the states of Andhra Pradesh, Karnataka, and Tamil Nadu; a separate area was initially earmarked for the tribal people of these states but this was not put into effect.|$|E
5|$|There are two new battle mechanics: Triple Battles and Rotation Battles. In Triple Battles, {{both teams}} must send out three Pokémon {{in a row}} at once; Pokémon on {{the left or right}} side can only attack the opponent's Pokémon on the same side or in the center. Changing {{position}} takes up one turn. In Rotation Battles, each side sends out three Pokémon at once, but they are arranged in a circle that can be rotated at will. Black has more Rotation Battles than Triple Battles, and the opposite is true in White. Another introduction is Combination Moves: a starter Pokémon can be taught one of three moves, and using <b>them</b> <b>together</b> <b>in</b> Double or Triple battles produces more powerful attacks. In the wild, walking through different-colored tall grass can trigger Double Battles against wild Pokémon rather than only Single Battles as usual.|$|E
5|$|In 1896, Baden-Powell was {{assigned}} to the Matabeleland region in Southern Rhodesia (now Zimbabwe) as Chief of Staff to Gen. Frederick Carrington during the Second Matabele War, and it was here (in June, 1896) that he first met and began a lifelong friendship with Frederick Russell Burnham, the American-born Chief of Scouts for the British Army in Africa. This was a formative experience for Baden-Powell not only because he had the time of his life commanding reconnaissance missions into enemy territory, but because many of his later Boy Scout ideas took hold here. During their joint scouting patrols into the Matobo Hills, Burnham augmented Baden-Powell's woodcraft skills, inspiring him and sowing seeds for both the programme and for the code of honour later published in Scouting for Boys. Practised by frontiersmen of the American Old West and Indigenous peoples of the Americas, woodcraft was generally little known to the British Army but well-known to the American scout Burnham. These skills eventually formed the basis of what is now called scoutcraft, the fundamentals of Scouting. Both men recognised that wars in Africa were changing markedly and the British Army needed to adapt; so during their joint scouting missions, Baden-Powell and Burnham discussed the concept of a broad training programme in woodcraft for young men, rich in exploration, tracking, fieldcraft, and self-reliance. It was also during this time in the Matobo Hills that Baden-Powell first started to wear his signature campaign hat like the one worn by Burnham, and it was here that Baden-Powell acquired his Kudu horn, the Ndebele war instrument he later used every morning at Brownsea Island to wake the first Boy Scouts and to call <b>them</b> <b>together</b> <b>in</b> training courses.|$|E

5|$|Nothing {{is known}} about its {{reproduction}} or nuptial flight. Collectors note that no alates or pupae resembling alate forms were found in excavated colonies between August and February, and the larvae collected were not {{large enough to be}} reproductive ants. However, it is possible that nuptial flight takes place in spring or summer, and like N. albisetosus and N.cockerelli, alates most likely start to occur by June. After nuptial flight, queens search for a suitable colony by building a chamber under objects such as stones and exposed roots of woody plants. This theory stated by entomologist Paul Kannowski is supported by the fact that these ants depend on stones buried in the soil for nest construction. The larvae and pupae are unsorted in the upper chambers of the nest that are joined together by hooked hairs {{on the side of the}} larvae. This arrangement most likely helps workers move the brood efficiently and keep <b>them</b> <b>together</b> <b>in</b> a group. Incipient colonies may only have 30 workers and brood in all life stages. Unlike the larvae and pupae, the eggs and queen are not found in the uppermost galleries, but rather they are found in the deepest chambers of the nest. In large nests, small workers resembling the first generation of brood are either rare or absent.|$|E

25|$|In Greek mythology, Gemini was {{associated}} with the myth of Castor and Pollux, the children of Leda and Argonauts both. Pollux was the son of Zeus, who seduced Leda, while Castor was the son of Tyndareus, king of Sparta and Leda's husband. Castor and Pollux were also mythologically associated with St. Elmo's fire in their role as the protectors of sailors. When Castor died, because he was mortal, Pollux begged his father Zeus to give Castor immortality, and he did, by uniting <b>them</b> <b>together</b> <b>in</b> the heavens.|$|E

25|$|Sesame {{seeds are}} {{protected}} by a capsule which only bursts when the seeds are completely ripe. This is called dehiscence. The dehiscence time tends to vary, so farmers cut plants by hand and place <b>them</b> <b>together</b> <b>in</b> an upright position to continue ripening until all the capsules have opened. The discovery of an indehiscent mutant (analogous to nonshattering domestic grains) by Langham in 1943 began the work towards development of a high-yielding, dehiscence-resistant variety. Although researchers have made significant progress in sesame breeding, harvest losses due to dehiscence continue to limit domestic US production.|$|E
25|$|The {{best known}} case of {{possible}} homosexuality in ancient Egypt {{is that of}} the two high officials Nyankh-Khnum and Khnum-hotep. Both men lived and served under pharaoh Niuserre during the 5th Dynasty (c. 24942345 BC). Nyankh-Khnum and Khnum-hotep each had families of their own with children and wives, but when they died their families apparently decided to bury <b>them</b> <b>together</b> <b>in</b> one and the same mastaba tomb. In this mastaba, several paintings depict both men embracing each other and touching their faces nose-on-nose. These depictions leave plenty of room for speculation, because in ancient Egypt the nose-on-nose touching normally represented a kiss.|$|E
