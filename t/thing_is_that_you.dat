2500|$|Mary Dell in the Daily Mirror of 1 April 1937 said: [...] "Agatha Christie {{is keeping}} her famous detective, Poirot, busy. Here {{he is the}} murderer-chaser in four short stories which show that this author can keep you as [...] "on edge" [...] in shorter thrillers as in {{full-length}} ones. And another good <b>thing</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> {{can come to the}} last untying of all the knots in one sitting.|$|E
2500|$|Though Stein {{collected}} cubist paintings, {{especially those}} of Picasso, the largest visual arts influence on her literary work is that of Cézanne. Particularly, he influenced her idea of equality, distinguished from universality: [...] "the whole field of the canvas is important" [...] (p.8). Rather than a figure/ground relationship, [...] "Stein in her work with words used the entire text as a field in which every element mattered {{as much as any}} other." [...] It is a subjective relationship that includes multiple viewpoints. Stein explained: [...] "The important <b>thing</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> must have deep down as the deepest thing in you a sense of equality." ...|$|E
2500|$|After Hamas leader Khaled Mashal paid an {{official}} visit to Turkey, relations began to cool off. In January 2010, Israel protested when an episode ("Ambush") of the Turkish soap opera Valley of the Wolves depicted Israeli intelligence spying inside Turkey and kidnapping Turkish babies. The series depicted a fictional Mossad {{attack on the}} Turkish embassy in Tel Aviv in which the ambassador {{and his family are}} taken hostage. On 11 January 2010, Israeli Deputy Foreign Minister Danny Ayalon met with Turkish ambassador Ahmet Oğuz Çelikkol, who was seated on a stool that was lower than Ayalon's. Ayalon allegedly turned to his aide and quipped, [...] "The main <b>thing</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> see that he is seated low and that we are high ... that there is one flag on the table (the Israeli flag) and that we are not smiling." ...|$|E
5000|$|At {{the age of}} twelve, Condon {{found himself}} drawn to {{screenplay}} writing with his first viewing of Bonnie and Clyde: Part of the pleasure {{of it was a}} completely instinctual thing that drew me into the world of writing about movies. Suddenly it became all of your senses—your mind was engaged by it. The most pleasurable <b>thing</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> felt as if you were part of the movement and part of that fun.|$|R
5000|$|I {{think if}} you pay {{attention}} to life and the way <b>things</b> <b>are,</b> <b>that</b> <b>you,</b> you come out pretty jaded by, you know, life. Or things arent the way they should be. I think Anti Hero {{is a reflection of}} that. I think Julians own twisted take on <b>things</b> has <b>been,</b> like I said, theres no expectation—we just skate, we fuck off, we have a good time. We go to trips sometimes and nothing happened. Or sometime we go on a trip and everything happens at once; you never know. And I think that that translates very much into Johns way of life—whether its hunting, fishing , or whatever, Johns Cardiel an outdoorsman, and I think that, that hearty spirit of America translated very well with Julians gritty grime of, like, the city slime, into making a really solid, [...] "This is what it is to us." ...|$|R
6000|$|There was {{a tremor}} of voice, an eager look, {{that made her}} fear that the crushed hope was reviving, and she hastened to say, 'The best <b>thing</b> would <b>be</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> should think no more about me.' ...|$|R
2500|$|On {{the night}} of the murder, 16/17 December 1916, Rasputin was invited to Felix's {{apartment}} at the Moika Palace. He was told that Irina would be in residence and Rasputin would have an opportunity to meet her. Rasputin had often expressed interest in meeting the beautiful 21-year-old princess. Irina, however, was on a visit to the Crimea. Irina had been aware that Felix had talked about eliminating Rasputin and it was originally intended that she participate in the murder. [...] "You too must take part in it," [...] Felix wrote to her before the murder. [...] "Dm(itri) Pavl(ovich) knows all about it and is helping. It will all take place in the middle of December, when Dm(itri) comes back." [...] In late November 1916, Irina wrote to Felix: [...] "Thanks for your insane letter. I didn't understand the half of it. I see that you're planning to do something wild. Please take care and do not get mixed up in any shady business. The dirtiest <b>thing</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> have decided to do it all without me. I don't see how I can take part in it now, since it's all arranged... In a word, be careful. I see from your letter that you're in a state of wild enthusiasm and ready to climb a wall... I'll be in Petrograd on the 12th or 13th, so don't dare do anything without me, or else I won't come at all." ...|$|E
6000|$|I {{turned this}} over. [...] "You've made evidently an admirable use of it. But the {{wonderful}} <b>thing</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> {{seem to have}} done so without having all the elements." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Perhaps," [...] Deane answered. [...] "The only <b>thing</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> {{did not do}} enough. I am {{perfectly}} convinced, Hardaway, {{that that}} man did not go there {{with the intention of}} murdering Sinclair." ...|$|E
6000|$|But she continued, undeterred: [...] "You are a coward--a pitiful coward," [...] {{she told}} him. [...] "Consult your mirror. It {{will tell you}} what a palsied <b>thing</b> <b>you</b> <b>are.</b> <b>That</b> <b>you</b> should dare so speak to Ruth..." ...|$|R
60|$|ATTEN. It must needs be {{so as you}} say, {{if these}} <b>things</b> <b>be</b> true <b>that</b> <b>you</b> have {{asserted}} of him. And I do the rather believe them, because I think you dare not tell a lie of the dead.|$|R
60|$|Now, I {{was going}} to make a speech--I {{supposed}} I was, but I am not. It is late, late; and so I am going to tell a story; and there is this advantage about a story, anyway, that whatever moral or valuable thing you put into a speech, why, it gets diffused among those involuted sentences and possibly your audience goes away without finding out what <b>that</b> valuable <b>thing</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>were</b> trying to confer upon it; but, dear me, you put the same jewel into a story and it becomes the keystone of <b>that</b> story, and <b>you</b> <b>are</b> bound to get it--it flashes, it flames, it is the jewel in the toad's head--you don't overlook that.|$|R
6000|$|... "So had I," [...] {{the proud}} {{proprietor}} replied; [...] "but one <b>thing</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> can't get {{here in the}} daytime. I reckon if they knew a feller was livin' in these boxes, they'd fire him out." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That {{does not}} matter. The great <b>thing</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> are ill and unhappy--that I can't help you. I can't do anything.... I'd go {{anywhere}} ... to save you.... All I can do, I suppose, is to part {{like this and}} go." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "All that is good," [...] Polani said; [...] "but to me, just at present, I {{own that}} the {{principal}} <b>thing</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> have got safely back. Now I will not keep you from your bed, for I suppose {{that you will not}} be able to lie late in the morning." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Hard cases!" [...] said Harry presently. [...] "If I was sheriff I'd clean {{this hole}} right out. There are decent folks here, but the curious <b>thing</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> when <b>you</b> let {{two or three}} toughs into a place they seem to get on top." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It's fine {{sport for}} a change," [...] Sir Henry declared. [...] "The only <b>thing</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> if <b>you</b> strike a shoal one gets tired of hauling the beggars in. By-the-by, has Jimmy {{been up for}} me, Philippa? Have you heard whether there are any {{mackerel}} in?" ...|$|R
30|$|Ix: The bad <b>thing</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> if <b>you</b> put {{together}} a team that consists of prostate cancer patients only, you’re kind of focusing on their illness. I {{think we should be}} careful not to do this; it’s certainly important. So it’s not like, oh here comes the prostate team, let’s go and watch them.|$|R
6000|$|... "You say {{a terrible}} thing," [...] rejoined the old man. [...] "Can {{conscience}} {{be too much}} alive in us? is not everything however trifling it seems, an item in the great account, which it is of infinite importance therefore to have right? A terrible <b>thing</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> have said." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You see we're not together--not a bit. But I oughtn't to {{tell you}} such things; all the more that you won't really do it--not you. No, old chap," [...] the young man continued; [...] "there you'll break down. But it won't matter--we'll rub along. The great <b>thing</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> and I are all right." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We'll {{let it go}} at that. The main <b>thing</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> didn't {{come back}} for help. Instead, you made another start for yourself; and {{you seem to have}} done well here. According to a {{newspaper}} which I've read, you have even distinguished yourself lately." [...] He laughed before he proceeded. [...] "Anyway, you have shown that one could have some confidence in you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I cannot tell you. I don't know. Don't ask me, aunt, about <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> passed. <b>You</b> cannot do {{it without}} {{wounding}} me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Warn? You?" [...] This {{with the}} air of one who finds loathsome gifts in his locker. [...] "Carson, would you {{be good enough to}} tell us what {{conceivable}} <b>thing</b> there <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>are</b> entitled to warn us about after this exposure? Warn? Oh, it's a little too much! Let's go somewhere where it's clean." ...|$|R
6000|$|Foster {{wished he}} had been more tactful and thought his comrade's {{amusement}} might better have been restrained; but Lawrence resumed: [...] "It must have been annoying to leave the mill when you had much to do. The curious <b>thing</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> when <b>you</b> set off from the Crossing with me you declared you were tired of working for dollars." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Messires," [...] said Sir Tristram, [...] "I {{have only}} to demand two things of you. One {{of them is that}} you give me your word that you will go to Cornwall and confess to King Mark that you have been overthrown by a Cornish knight; and the second <b>thing</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> tell me if you saw Sir Bleoberis de Ganys pass this way?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "So does a bad dream," [...] said Godfrey, [...] "but for {{all that}} it isn't real. Still it is odd that {{everything}} important seems to happen to us within {{a few feet of}} that lady's dust, and I can't quite disbelieve in spirits and their power of impressing themselves upon us; I wish I could. The strange <b>thing</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> should put any faith in them." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well," [...] I {{said when}} I heard the tale, [...] "one <b>thing</b> <b>is,</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> {{will never see}} him again, for he will be off during the night back to his friends the Zulus." [...] But I was wrong, for next morning there was Gaasha, and there he {{remained}} even after his foot was quite well, making the best Kaffir servant that ever I had to do with.|$|E
6000|$|... "You are angry, and do {{not know}} what you say. Hearken proud lass. I will take care of one <b>thing,</b> and <b>that</b> <b>is,</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> shall speak the truth." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "If my {{wife does}} not get tired of you, I shall not," [...] Lord Peterborough said to Nora. [...] "The <b>thing</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> when <b>you</b> do go we shall miss you so terribly." [...] In September, too, there {{happened}} another event which took Stanbury to Exeter, and all needful particulars as to <b>that</b> event shall <b>be</b> narrated in the next chapter.|$|R
5000|$|The then Prime Minister, David Cameron, {{compared}} {{himself in}} April 2014 to the company's services, saying [...] "If there <b>are</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> stopping <b>you</b> from doing more, {{think of me}} as a giant Dyno-Rod".|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{think of}} him first," [...] said Hugh, jealously. [...] "Yes: he is safe; and, I do hope, gone away, out of the country, never to come back any more. The more {{important}} <b>thing</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> should be safe from him. As for the doctor--but I cannot speak of the doctor with common patience. Let him {{be left to the}} end which always awaits such men. It is to be hoped that he will never, wherever he goes, feel himself in safety." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Once you get {{the dying}} started, it goes right along. And the funny <b>thing</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> are all there all the time. Because your toes are dead don't make you in the least bit dead. By-and-by your legs are dead to the knees, {{and then to the}} thighs, and you are just the same as you always were. It is your body that is {{dropping}} out of the game a chunk at a time. And you are just you, the same you were before you began." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'How sweet {{it is to}} {{hear you}} say so! And the {{wonderful}} <b>thing</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> have never seemed disappointed. I always expected that some day after marriage--not immediately, perhaps, {{but at the end of}} a week or so--you would suddenly give a start, like those poor people who are hypnotised, and you would say, [...] "Why, I used to think that she was pretty! I used to think that she was sweet! How could I be so infatuated over a little, insignificant, ignorant, selfish, uninteresting--" [...] O Frank, the neighbours will see you?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No, it won't do," [...] he said, {{when he had}} {{somewhat}} recovered himself. [...] "Miss Withersteen, there <b>are</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> don't know, and there's not a soul {{among us}} who can tell you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Thanks, I {{hope you}} will. This long voyage {{will give you}} new experiences, and being an officer, you will have new duties and responsibilities. Are you ready for them? You take {{everything}} so gaily, I've been wondering if <b>you</b> realized <b>that</b> now <b>you</b> will have not only to obey but to command also, and power <b>is</b> a dangerous <b>thing.</b> <b>Be</b> careful <b>that</b> <b>you</b> don't abuse it or let it make a tyrant of you.' ...|$|R
6000|$|Leland {{swung his}} arm up, and {{appeared}} to be pointing in front of him. [...] "You're going to. Go on slow, but be ready to run when you see a twinkle. The one <b>thing</b> to remember <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> have a rifle." ...|$|R
