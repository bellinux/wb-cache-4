5|$|Eleven {{species of}} {{reptiles}} and four species of amphibians {{have been found}} in the park. Reptiles include the Great Basin rattlesnake, short-horned lizard, side-blotched lizard, striped whipsnake, and the <b>tiger</b> <b>salamander.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{body of the}} long-toed {{salamander}} is dusky black with a dorsal stripe of tan, yellow, or olive-green. This stripe can also be broken up {{into a series of}} spots. The sides of the body can have fine white or pale blue flecks. The belly is dark-brown or sooty in color with white flecks. Root tubercles are present, but they are not quite as developed as other species, such as the <b>tiger</b> <b>salamander.</b>|$|E
5|$|This {{species is}} one of the most widely {{distributed}} salamanders in North America, second only to the <b>tiger</b> <b>salamander.</b> Its altitudinal range runs from sea level up to , spanning a wide variety of vegetational zones. The range includes isolated endemic populations in Monterey Bay and Santa Cruz, California. The distribution reconnects in northeastern Sierra Nevada running continuously along the Pacific Coast to Juneau, Alaska, with populations dotted along the Taku and Stikine River valleys. From the Pacific coast, the range extends longitudinally to the eastern foothills of the Rocky Mountains in Montana and Alberta.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Tiger</b> <b>salamanders</b> {{are popular}} as pets. A [...] {{aquarium}} {{is used to}} house this species. Non-chemical treated topsoil is a recommended substrate, usually 4-5 inches deep, as these salamanders love to burrow. Coco fiber is also a safe alternative. <b>Tiger</b> <b>salamanders</b> in captivity are fed crickets, earthworms, mealworms, superworms and waxworms and the occasional [...] "pinky" [...] mouse.|$|R
5|$|The <b>tiger</b> <b>salamander</b> (Ambystoma tigrinum) {{is typical}} of the frogs and {{salamanders}} that hide under cover ready to ambush unwary invertebrates. Others amphibians, such as the Bufo spp. toads, actively search for prey, while the Argentine horned frog (Ceratophrys ornata) lures inquisitive prey closer by raising its hind feet over its back and vibrating its yellow toes. Among leaf litter frogs in Panama, frogs that actively hunt prey have narrow mouths and are slim, often brightly coloured and toxic, while ambushers have wide mouths and are broad and well-camouflaged. Caecilians do not flick their tongues, but catch their prey by grabbing it with their slightly backward-pointing teeth. The struggles of the prey and further jaw movements work it inwards and the caecilian usually retreats into its burrow. The subdued prey is gulped down whole.|$|E
5|$|Only four {{species of}} {{reptiles}} are {{documented in the}} park: three species of snakes which are the wandering garter snake, the less commonly seen valley garter snake and rubber boa, {{as well as one}} lizard species, the northern sagebrush lizard, that was first reported in 1992. None of the species are venomous. Six amphibian species have been documented including the Columbia spotted frog, boreal chorus frog, <b>tiger</b> <b>salamander</b> and the increasingly rare boreal toad and northern leopard frog. A sixth amphibian species, the bullfrog, was introduced. An estimated 10,000 insect species frequent the park; they pollinate plants, provide a food source for birds, fish, mammals and other animals, and help in the decomposition of wood. In one example of the importance of insects to the ecosystem, swarms of Army cutworm moths die in huge numbers after mating and provide a high fat and protein diet for bears and other predators. One study concluded that when this moth species is most available, bears consume 40,000 moths per day which is roughly 20,000kcal/day.|$|E

50|$|Axolotls {{should not}} be {{confused}} with waterdogs, the larval stage of the closely related <b>tiger</b> <b>salamanders</b> (A. tigrinum and A. mavortium), which are widespread in much of North America and occasionally become neotenic. Neither should they be confused with mudpuppies (Necturus spp.), fully aquatic salamanders that are not closely related to the axolotl but bear a superficial resemblance.|$|R
25|$|Reptiles include {{olive ridley}} sea turtle, western fence lizard, various {{rattlesnake}} species and species of blind snake and gopher snake. Amphibians included the barred <b>tiger</b> <b>salamander</b> and California tree frog.|$|E
25|$|Golf {{course and}} a {{seasonal}} lake: The university {{also has its}} own golf course and a seasonal lake (Lake Lagunita, actually an irrigation reservoir), both home to the vulnerable California <b>tiger</b> <b>salamander.</b> As of 2012 Lake Lagunita was often dry and the university {{had no plans to}} artificially fill it.|$|E
25|$|Many {{species of}} salamander, and {{amphibians}} in general, {{are known to}} have neotenized characteristics because of the environment they live in. The axolotl is a species of salamander that retains its juvenile aquatic form throughout adulthood, an excellent example of full neoteny. Gills are a common juvenile characteristic in amphibians that are kept after maturation; an example of this would be a comparison of the <b>tiger</b> <b>salamander</b> and the rough-skinned newt, both of which retain gills into adulthood.|$|E
50|$|The larvae of {{some species}} (especially {{those in the}} south, and <b>tiger</b> <b>salamanders)</b> can reach their adult size before {{undergoing}} metamorphosis. During metamorphosis, the gills of the larvae disappear, as do the fins. Their tails, skin, and limbs become thicker, and the eyes develop lids. Their lungs become fully developed, allowing for a fully terrestrial existence.|$|R
50|$|<b>Tiger</b> <b>salamanders</b> are {{frequently}} kept in captivity; they mostly hide and ambush their prey. It {{is illegal to}} sell adults {{in most parts of}} the United States. Their large size allows for ease of feeding, and their hardy nature make them excellent captives. Their larval stage is often sold as fishing bait, marketed as mud puppies or water dogs.|$|R
40|$|Emerging {{infectious}} diseases {{are one of}} the factors that have contributed to global amphibian population declines over the past few decades. The recent emergence of the highly virulent Amybstoma tigrinum virus (ATV) in <b>tiger</b> <b>salamanders</b> at three sites in Alberta has led to concerns regarding the population status of this prairie icon. Results from my population surveys showed that <b>tiger</b> <b>salamanders</b> occurred in approximately 50 % of 15 sites in southwestern Alberta, but densities were low. In a longitudinal survey of a salamander population in Livingston Lake, Alberta in 2013 and 2014, ATV was strongly seasonal, increasing from 0 to 100 % prevalence between early July and metamorphosis in mid-August. Despite a consistent seasonal pattern of exposure to ATV, host mortality was high in one year, but low in the next. These results suggest that ecological factors (i. e. triggers) act in addition to ATV exposure to contribute to AT...|$|R
25|$|Mammals {{such as the}} white-tailed deer, badger, skunk, beaver, raccoon are {{relatively}} common, while the pronghorn, mule deer and coyote {{are a few of}} the less likely to be observed of the 36 mammal species that have been recorded on the refuge. Lake Ilo NWR is also home to three species of amphibians and six species of reptiles including the <b>tiger</b> <b>salamander,</b> common snapping turtle, bull snake and the chorus frog. Northern pike, yellow perch and black crappie are examples of the 11 fish species that have been documented in the refuge.|$|E
25|$|Amphibians include {{numerous}} toads and frogs in the American Southwest. Toads {{which can}} be found in the region include: the Great Plains toad (Anaxyrus cognatus); the green toad (Anaxyrus debilis); the Arizona toad (Anaxyrus microscaphus); the New Mexico spadefoot (Spea multiplicata stagnalis); and the Colorado River toad (Incilius alvarius), also known as the Sonoran Desert toad. Frog representation includes: western barking frog (Craugastor augusti); the canyon tree frog (Hyla arenicolor); the Arizona treefrog (Hyla wrightorum); the western chorus frog (Pseudacris triseriata); Chiricahua leopard frog (Lithobates chiricahuensis); and the relict leopard frog (Lithobates onca). There are quite a few salamanders throughout the region, including: the Arizona <b>tiger</b> <b>salamander</b> (Ambystoma mavortium nebulosum) and the painted ensatina (Ensatina eschscholtzii picta).|$|E
25|$|There {{are many}} grazing {{practices}} that also encourage native biodiversity. In Rosenzweig’s book {{he uses the}} example of a rancher in Arizona who intentionally deepened his cattle ponds in order to save a population of threatened leopard frogs (Rana chiricahuensis), with no detriment to the use of those tanks for cattle, and a similar situation has occurred with the vulnerable California <b>tiger</b> <b>salamander</b> (Ambystoma californiense) in the Central Valley of California. Research has shown that without cattle grazing, many of the remaining vernal pools would dry too early for the salamanders to complete their life cycle under global climate change predictions. In Central America, a large percentage of pastureland is fenced using live trees which are not only low maintenance for the farmer, but also provide habitat for birds, bats, and invertebrates which cannot persist in open pastureland. Another example from Rosenzweig involves encouraging loggerhead shrikes (Lanius ludovicianus) to populate pastureland by placing perches around the pasture. These are all simple, low-cost ways to encourage biodiversity without negatively impacting the human uses of the landscape.|$|E
40|$|Species {{recognition}} of four species of salamanders, Ambystoma, tigrinum, A. maculatum, A. opacum, and A. tremblavi, was studied {{in a series}} of investigations performed from September 9, 1984 to October 29, 1984. The {{purpose of the study was}} to determine if vision is a component in interspecies recognition in these salamanders and, if so, to determine what specific sign stimuli are effective. A total of 23 individual salamanders were tested in three experimental situations involving choices between live conspecific and heterospecific salamanders, live conspecifics and heterospecifics where no olfactory cues were available, and between different models, varying either in pattern composition or ground color. In the preliminary tests, all four species of salamander preferred their conspecifics. In the live animal tests only the <b>tiger</b> <b>salamanders</b> preferred their conspecifics. In the model tests only the <b>tiger</b> <b>salamanders</b> showed a preference for one of the models, preferring the supernormal to the natural model. Thesis (M. S. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Hybrid zones {{represent}} valuable {{opportunities to}} observe evolution in {{systems that are}} unusually dynamic and where {{the potential for the}} origin of novelty and rapid adaptation co-occur with the potential for dysfunction. Recently initiated hybrid zones are particularly exciting evolutionary experiments because ongoing natural selection on novel genetic combinations can be studied in ecological time. Moreover, when hybrid zones involve native and introduced species, complex genetic patterns present important challenges for conservation policy. To assess variation of admixture dynamics, we scored a large panel of markers in five wild hybrid populations formed when Barred <b>Tiger</b> <b>Salamanders</b> were introduced into the range of California <b>Tiger</b> <b>Salamanders.</b> Results At three of 64 markers, introduced alleles have largely displaced native alleles within the hybrid populations. Another marker (GNAT 1) showed consistent heterozygote deficits in the wild, and this marker was associated with embryonic mortality in laboratory F 2 's. Other deviations from equilibrium expectations were idiosyncratic among breeding ponds, consistent with highly stochastic demographic effects. Conclusion While most markers retain native and introduced alleles in expected proportions, strong selection appears to be eliminating native alleles at a smaller set of loci. Such rapid fixation of alleles is detectable only in recently formed hybrid zones, though it might be representative of dynamics that frequently occur in nature. These results underscore the variable and mosaic nature of hybrid genomes and illustrate the potency of recombination and selection in promoting variable, and often unpredictable genetic outcomes. Introgression of a few, strongly selected introduced alleles should not necessarily affect the conservation status of California <b>Tiger</b> <b>Salamanders,</b> but suggests that genetically pure populations of this endangered species will be difficult to maintain. </p...|$|R
500|$|The eggs of {{this species}} look {{similar to those of}} the related northwestern {{salamander}} (A. gracile) and <b>tiger</b> <b>salamander</b> (A. tigrinum). Like many amphibians, the eggs of the long-toed salamander are surrounded by a gelatinous capsule. This capsule is transparent, making the embryo visible during development. Unlike A.gracile eggs, there are no visible signs of green algae, which makes egg jellies green in color. When in its egg, the long-toed salamander embryo is darker on top and whiter below compared to a <b>tiger</b> <b>salamander</b> embryo that is light brown to grey above and cream-colored on the bottom. The eggs are about [...] or greater in diameter with a wide outer jelly layer. Prior to hatching—both in the egg and as newborn larvae—they have balancers, which are thin skin protrusions sticking out the sides and supporting the head. The balancers eventually fall off and their external gills grow larger. Once the balancers are lost the larvae are distinguished by the sharply pointed flaring of the gills. As the larvae mature and metamorphose, their limbs with digits become visible and the gills are resorbed.|$|E
500|$|Other {{research}} included {{field work}} in Colombia, South Africa, and Australia, and {{the description of}} several species: the Jemez Mountains salamander, southern torrent salamander, [...] yellow-eyed ensatina, and the panamint alligator lizard. Two salamanders were named in his honor during his time at Berkeley: the Tehachapi slender salamander (Batrachoseps stebbinsi) and the Sonora <b>tiger</b> <b>salamander</b> (Ambystoma tigrinum stebbinsi). [...] Over his 32 years at Berkeley, Stebbins was the advisor to 29 graduate students, including Wade Fox, Richard G. Zweifel, and R. Bruce Bury. [...] Upon his retirement from UC Berkeley in 1978, Stebbins was awarded the highest faculty honor, the Berkeley Citation.|$|E
500|$|At hatching, {{a typical}} {{salamander}} larva has eyes without lids, teeth in both {{upper and lower}} jaws, three pairs of feathery external gills, a somewhat laterally flattened body and a long tail with dorsal and ventral fins. The forelimbs may be partially developed and the hind limbs are rudimentary in pond-living species but may be rather more developed in species that reproduce in moving water. Pond-type larvae often have a pair of balancers, rod-like structures {{on either side of}} the head that may prevent the gills from becoming clogged up with sediment. Some members of the genera Ambystoma and Dicamptodon have larvae that never fully develop into the adult form, but this varies with species and with populations. The northwestern salamander (Ambystoma gracile) is one of these and, depending on environmental factors, either remains permanently in the larval state, a condition known as neoteny, or transforms into an adult. Both of these are able to breed. Neoteny occurs when the animal's growth rate is very low and is usually linked to adverse conditions such as low water temperatures that may change the response of the tissues to the hormone thyroxine. Other factors that may inhibit metamorphosis include lack of food, lack of trace elements and competition from conspecifics. The <b>tiger</b> <b>salamander</b> (Ambystoma tigrinum) also sometimes behaves in this way and may grow particularly large in the process. The adult <b>tiger</b> <b>salamander</b> is terrestrial, but the larva is aquatic and able to breed while still in the larval state. When conditions are particularly inhospitable on land, larval breeding may allow continuation of a population that would otherwise die out. There are fifteen species of [...] neotenic salamanders, including species of Necturus, Proteus and Amphiuma, and many examples of [...] ones that adopt this strategy under appropriate environmental circumstances.|$|E
50|$|<b>Tiger</b> <b>salamanders</b> grow to {{a typical}} length of 6 - 8 in {{and a maximum}} of 14 in in length, {{particularly}} neotenic individuals. Adults are usually blotchy with grey, green, or black, and have large, lidded eyes. They have short snouts, thick necks, sturdy legs, and long tails. Their diets consist largely of small insects and worms, {{though it is not}} rare for an adult to consume small frogs and baby mice.|$|R

500|$|Robert Cyril Stebbins (March 31, 1915 – September 23, 2013) was an American herpetologist and {{illustrator}} {{known for}} his field guides and popular books {{as well as his}} studies of reptiles and amphibians. His Field Guide to Western Reptiles and Amphibians, first published in 1966, is still considered the definitive reference of its kind, owing to both the quality of the illustrations and the comprehensiveness of the text. A professor of zoology at the University of California, Berkeley, for over 30 years, he was the first curator of herpetology at the Museum of Vertebrate Zoology, a 1949 Guggenheim fellow, and author of over 70 scientific articles. [...] His discovery of the ring species phenomenon in Ensatina salamanders is now a textbook example of speciation, and he performed extensive research on the parietal eye of reptiles. He produced nature films, supported science education in primary grades, and organized conservation efforts that aided in the passing of the 1994 California Desert Protection Act. After retirement he continued to paint, collect field notes, and write books. Stebbins is commemorated in the scientific names of three species: Batrachoseps stebbinsi, the Tehachapi slender salamander; Anniella stebbinsi, a legless lizard; and Ambystoma tigrinum stebbinsi, the endangered Sonora <b>tiger</b> <b>salamander.</b>|$|E

40|$|Ranaviruses, a genus of the Iridoviridae, {{are large}} {{double-stranded}} DNA viruses that infect cold-blooded vertebrates worldwide. Ranaviruses have caused severe epizootics in commercial frog and fish populations, and are currently classified as notifiable pathogens in international trade. Previous work {{shows that a}} ranavirus that infects <b>tiger</b> <b>salamanders</b> throughout Western North America (Ambystoma tigrinum virus, or ATV) is in high prevalence among salamanders in the fishing bait trade. Bait ATV strains have elevated virulence and are transported long distances by humans, providing widespread opportunities for pathogen pollution. We sequenced the genomes of 15 strains of ATV collected from <b>tiger</b> <b>salamanders</b> across western North America and performed phylogenetic and population genomic analyses and tests for recombination. We find that ATV forms a monophyletic clade within {{the rest of the}} Ranaviruses and that it likely emerged within the last several thousand years, before human activities influenced its spread. We also identify several genes under strong positive selection, some of which appear to be involved in viral virulence and/or host immune evasion. In addition, we provide support for the pathogen pollution hypothesis with evidence of recombination among ATV strains, and potential bait-endemic strain recombination...|$|R
