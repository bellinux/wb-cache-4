Hughes was also complimented on his achievements in using humour or horror when describing Myrrha or a flood, respectively. The work received critical acclaim winning the Whitbread Book Of The Year Award 1997 and being adapted to the stage in 1999, starring Sirine Saba as Myrrha.|$|E

5|$|Several {{artists have}} applied Ovid's account to new {{translations}} or reworkings, or adapted {{the story for}} the stage. British poet Ted Hughes (1930–1998) used the myth in his 1997 work <b>Tales</b> <b>from</b> Ovid (1997) which was a loose translation and retelling of twenty-four <b>tales</b> <b>from</b> Ovid's Metamorphoses. Both Israeli dramatist Hanoch Levin (in The Great Whore of Babylon) and English playwright Joanna Laurens (in The Three Birds) wrote plays based on the story. Most recently the story was adapted into an opera by Scottish composer James Dillon in 2004 and a 1964 vocal composition by American composer Milton Babbitt with text by John Hollander.|$|E
