5|$|Hanuman Bahuka (हनुमान बाहुक), {{literally}} The Arm of Hanuman, is a Braja work of 44 verses {{believed to}} have been composed by Tulsidas when he suffered acute pain in his arms at an advanced age. Tulsidas describes <b>the</b> <b>pain</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> arms and also prays to Hanuman for freedom from the suffering. The work has two, one, five and 36 verses respectively in the Chhappaya, Jhulna, Savaiya and Ghanakshari metre.|$|E
5|$|Rheumatoid {{arthritis}} in {{his left}} knee, which spread to the right knee, ankles, elbows, wrists and hands, stopped him from making {{a career out of}} football. Despite often being in agony during training, he managed to play part-time for Hereford United, including in the first team when they were in the fourth, and later in the third, division of the English Football League. He was earning up to £33 a week. But in 1973, at the age of 21, <b>the</b> <b>pain</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> joints became so severe that he was forced to retire.|$|E
5|$|At the time, {{the injury}} was still {{believed}} to be minor and Cloutier volunteered to continue playing in lieu of backup Mathieu Garon also being sidelined with a broken finger. When <b>the</b> <b>pain</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> hip quickly got worse, Cloutier appealed to team management. He saw a specialist who diagnosed him with a torn hip labrum and told him the injury could put his career in jeopardy. He was subsequently flown to Colorado for surgery on January 12, 2007. Cloutier remained in Colorado for ongoing treatment and was lodged by the organization in a motel 31 {{miles away from the}} clinic. The Kings' original insistence that he play and his subsequent lodging proved to be a contentious issue for Cloutier.|$|E
50|$|According to Kevin Booth, in the BBC {{documentary}} Dark Poet, it {{was during}} the early recording sessions for Arizona Bay, around Christmas 1992, that Hicks first started suffering from <b>the</b> <b>pains</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> side, which would later be diagnosed as pancreatic cancer. Upon learning that he had developed cancer, Hicks used his time to mix music into Rant in E-Minor and Arizona Bay, calling it his Dark Side of the Moon.|$|R
50|$|According to Elijah's mysterious words, Ahab {{long ago}} lay for dead {{for three days}} and three nights off Cape Horn, was {{involved}} in a deadly scrimmage with the Spaniard afore the altar in Santa, and spat into the silver communion cup. Last voyage, a whale, the monstrousest parmacetty that ever chipped a boat, bit off Ahab's leg, and <b>the</b> <b>pains</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> stump made him, never jolly, desperate moody. Adding insult to injury, Ahab is dependent upon a whalebone for a prosthesis. Neither sick nor well, Ahab keeps close inside the house.|$|R

5|$|Caracciola and {{his wife}} Alice {{returned}} to their home in Lugano. For {{the duration of the}} war he was unable to drive; the rationing of petrol meant motor racing was unfeasible. <b>The</b> <b>pain</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> leg grew worse, and they went back to the clinic in Bologna to consult a specialist. Surgery was recommended, but Caracciola decided against that option, deterred by the minimum three months it would take to recover from the operation. He spent much of {{the last part of the}} war—from 1941 onwards—attempting to gain possession of the two W165s used at the 1939 Tripoli Grand Prix, with a view to maintaining them for the duration of the hostilities. When they finally arrived in Switzerland in early 1945, they were confiscated as German property by the Swiss authorities.|$|E
5|$|Caracciola {{tested the}} new Mercedes-Benz W25 at the AVUS track in April, {{and despite his}} injuries—his right leg had healed five shorter than his left, leaving him with a {{noticeable}} limp—he was cleared to race. However, Neubauer withdrew the Mercedes team from their first race, also at the AVUS track, as their practice times compared too unfavourably to Auto Union's. Caracciola was judged not fit to race for the Eifelrennen at the Nürburgring, but made the start for the German Grand Prix at the same track six weeks later. He took the lead from Auto Union driver Hans Stuck {{on the outside of}} the Karussel on the 13th lap, but retired a lap later when his engine failed. He had better luck at the 1934 Italian Grand Prix in September. In very hot weather, Caracciola started from fourth and moved to second, where he trailed Stuck. After 59laps, <b>the</b> <b>pain</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> leg overwhelmed him, and he pitted, letting teammate Fagioli take over his car. Fagioli won from Stuck's car which by then had been taken over by Nuvolari. His best results in the rest of the season were a second place in the Spanish Grand Prix—he led before Fagioli passed him, much to the anger of Neubauer, who had ordered the Italian to hold position—and first at the Klausenpass hillclimb.|$|E
25|$|On March 11, Mauer was {{diagnosed}} with inflammation in the sacroiliac joint by team doctors following a magnetic resonance arthrogram. He was unable {{to take part in}} team workouts during spring training due to <b>the</b> <b>pain</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> lower back, which he first began experiencing late in the 2008 season. Mauer missed the start of the 2009 regular season and returned on May 1. He went 2 for 3 with an RBI and three runs scored in his first game back, hitting a home run on his first swing of the season.|$|E

60|$|Some {{soup and}} wine {{had been placed}} by the fire, and {{likewise}} a shirt and a suit of Humfrey's clothes were spread before it. Aime burst out into the yard, absolutely weeping with impatience, when, unheeding all his remonstrances, his three companions applied themselves to feeding, rubbing, and warming Osbert, and assuring him that <b>the</b> <b>pains</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> limbs would pass away with warmth and exercise. He had been valiant of heart <b>in</b> <b>his</b> dungeon; but his sudden plunge into upper air was like rising from the grave, and brought on all the effects of his dreary captivity, {{of which he had}} hardly been sensible when he had first listened to the voice of hope.|$|R
25|$|The {{eleventh}} {{match was}} a Powerbomb match between Sid Vicious and Kevin Nash. Vicious gained the advantage after attacking Nash outside the ring {{with the use}} of a steel chair and the guard rail. Vicious continued with a leg drop and a scoop slam. Vicious sent Nash into the referee, knocking him down, and performed a powerbomb on Nash. Jeff Jarrett came down, and hit Vicious with a guitar. Nash attempted a powerbomb, but failed due to <b>the</b> <b>pain</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> back. The referee revived, and Nash told him he performed a powerbomb on Vicious. The referee believed Nash, and awarded him the victory.|$|E
25|$|During a {{performance}} of L'elisir d'amore by Donizetti at the Brooklyn Academy of Music on December 11, 1920, he suffered a throat haemorrhage and the performance was canceled {{at the end of}} Act 1. Following this incident, a clearly unwell Caruso gave only three more performances at the Met, the final one being as Eléazar in Halévy's La Juive, on 24 December 1920. By Christmas Day, <b>the</b> <b>pain</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> side was so excruciating that he was screaming. Dorothy summoned the hotel physician, who gave Caruso some morphine and codeine and called in another doctor, Evan M. Evans. Evans brought in three other doctors and Caruso finally received a correct diagnosis: purulent pleurisy and empyema.|$|E
25|$|In January 2017, he {{held two}} sold-out concerts at Carnegie Hall in New York. In March 2017, Yoshiki {{performed}} with a 4-piece string quartet at Hong Kong’s Asia Film Awards. In April 2017, Yoshiki debuted a special collaboration T-Shirt with rock group KISS titled “YOSHIKISS”. During these performances, he lost sensation {{in his left}} hand and was rediagnosed with cervical foraminal stenosis. In May 2017, it was announced that Yoshiki would undergo emergency cervical artificial disc replacement surgery in Los Angeles on May 16, resulting in the cancelling of his schedule for May, and future events being possibly cancelled or rescheduled based on discussions after his surgery. The surgery was successful, with his surgical wound expected to take six weeks to heal, and for him to make a 90% recovery in six months. However, the recovery period for <b>the</b> <b>pain</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> hand is unknown.|$|E
60|$|In {{a moment}} Dan {{was ready for}} a second shot, but it was not needed. Stiger's pistol was now useless, and as he could not stand up, because of <b>the</b> intense <b>pain</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> knee, {{handling}} his knife was out of the question. As he sat up, the boy faced him sternly.|$|R

60|$|Learning that Saturius {{had not yet}} arrived, he went to {{his private}} chambers, and to pass away the time {{commanded}} his most beautiful slaves to dance before him, where he inflamed himself by drinking more wine of a vintage that he loved. As the fumes of the strong liquor mounted to <b>his</b> brain <b>the</b> <b>pains</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> head ceased, at any rate for a while. Very soon he became half-drunk, and as was <b>his</b> nature when <b>in</b> drink, savage. One of the dancing slaves stumbled and growing nervous stepped out of time, whereon he ordered the poor half-naked girl to be scourged before him by the hands of her own companions. Happily for her, however, before the punishment began a slave arrived with the intelligence that Saturius waited without.|$|R
25|$|Marching {{about fifty}} yards behind the leading Union brigade, Dana’s command began to receive {{artillery}} fire {{but continued to}} head forward. Shortly after entering the West Woods, Dana's brigade was struck hard on their left by Confederate troops, and became {{in danger of being}} completely surrounded and cut off. Maneuvering his soldiers in the difficult terrain and spacing, Dana led his men to the relative safety of the Miller Farm, despite receiving a serious wound to his left leg. When <b>the</b> <b>pain</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> leg became unbearable, Dana turned command of his brigade over to his senior regimental commander, Col. Norman Hall, and was carried to a Union field hospital in nearby Keedysville for treatment. After spending two days at the field hospital, Dana was sent to Washington, D.C. and later again to Philadelphia to recover. At Antietam, Dana's command lost about 900 men killed, wounded, or missing.|$|E
25|$|Ulyett {{also played}} in the first-ever Test match, staged at the MCG, during that tour. His first real action in Test cricket came when he held onto a catch off the bowling of James Southerton to dismiss Billy Midwinter for five. With the bat, however, Ulyett failed in the first innings, lasting just {{a quarter of an}} hour before Nat Thomson had him trapped in front; in the second innings, however, with England in dire straits, he fought hard with John Selby for about 45 minutes—but then the rampant Tom Kendall got one through his defences and {{effectively}} brought an end to England's resistance, the match being lost by 45 runs. In bowling, Ulyett took three for 39 in the second innings, his first wicket being that of Charles Bannerman, who famously managed an incredible 165 out of Australia's first innings total of 245 (or 67.3 per cent of it, still a Test-Match record). This amazing effort finally came to an end when the toiling Ulyett let loose a sharp, rising bouncer that found its way through Bannerman's primitive gloving and struck him a blow on the index finger, splitting it open rather badly. A short delay revealed the fact that Bannerman could no longer grip his bat properly and that, therefore, he would have to retire. The Australian opener walked off, wincing from <b>the</b> <b>pain</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> bloodied right hand. George Ulyett, although never regarded as a truly-quick bowler, could nevertheless do real damage on occasion. Bannerman was unable to field, and, in the second innings, when Ulyett dismissed him again (this time in orthodox fashion—bowled), he faced just nine deliveries.|$|E
500|$|Despite <b>the</b> <b>pain</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> {{feet and}} knees, McBride was {{characterized}} by manager Dallas Green as the most consistent player on the team in 1980. The Phillies went to the 1980 World Series, {{and in the first}} game, McBride's three-run home run put the Phillies ahead of the Kansas City Royals. The Phillies won the game and won the World Series in six games. McBride hit [...]304 (7 hits in 23 at bats) in his only career World Series. During the strike-shortened 1981 season, McBride missed most of May because of knee problems. He underwent arthroscopy on his left knee just before the strike. He had surgery on his right knee in November.|$|E
60|$|Next day {{he set out}} for Bradford. He {{was glad}} {{to get away from}} Fairdale for a while. But the hours and the miles in no wise changed <b>the</b> new <b>pain</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> heart. <b>The</b> only way he could forget Miss Longstreth was to let his mind dwell upon Poggin, and even this was not always effective.|$|R
50|$|On 21 July 2015, {{during the}} {{preparations}} for the new season, Ćetković was forced undergo surgery <b>in</b> <b>his</b> right knee <b>in</b> an hospital in Zagreb that kept him out until November 2015. <b>The</b> constanct <b>pain</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> leg had concerned him for months, and the surgery was unavoidable.

500|$|As the Battle of Churubusco approached, Scott ordered Pierce to {{the rear}} to convalesce. He responded, [...] "For God's sake, General, {{this is the last}} great battle, and I must lead my brigade." [...] Scott yielded, and Pierce entered the fight tied to his saddle, but <b>the</b> <b>pain</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> leg became so great that he passed out on the field. The Americans won the battle and Pierce helped {{negotiate}} an armistice. He then returned to command and led his brigade {{throughout the rest of the}} campaign, eventually taking part in the capture of Mexico City in mid-September, although his brigade was held in reserve for much of the battle. He spent much of Mexico City fight in the sick tent, plagued with acute diarrhea. Pierce remained in command of his brigade during the three-month occupation of the city, while frustrated with the stalling of peace negotiations, and tried to distance himself from the constant conflict between Scott and the other generals.|$|E
500|$|With the {{lull in the}} fighting, and {{the onset}} of autumn rains, coupled with endless hills and {{deepening}} mud, Middleton's left knee, which had been uncomfortable {{for more than a}} year, was now becoming agonizing. He had hurt his right knee many years earlier playing football, but there was no immediate explanation for <b>the</b> <b>pain</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> left leg. Medics studied his leg, but had no answers. In late November Middleton went to the hospital in Naples, staying well into December, still without adequate diagnosis. He was able to hobble around, and did some staff work, then flew to General Eisenhower's headquarters in North Africa. He stayed there until mid-January, when he was sent to Walter Reed Hospital back in the United States. While Middleton was at Walter Reed, General Eisenhower communicated to General George Marshall, the U.S. Army Chief of Staff, that he needed Middleton back overseas. Acknowledging Middleton's difficulty with his knees, Eisenhower said, [...] "I don't give a damn about his knees; I want his head and his heart. And I'll take him into battle on a litter if we have to." [...] Command of the 45th Division went to Major General William W. Eagles.|$|E
500|$|In 1975, the 48-year old Davis {{embarked}} on a three-week tour of Japan; between January 22 and February 8, he played 14 concerts in large-hall venues to capacity crowds and enthusiastic reviews. Japanese critic Keizo Takada said Davis was leading his [...] "magnificent and energetic" [...] band just as Duke Ellington had his orchestra: [...] "Miles must be the genius of managing men and bringing out their hidden talent." [...] Throughout the tour, he had been sick with pneumonia and a bleeding ulcer that grew worse, while his hip occasionally and unpredictably slipped out of its socket. Unable to work his trumpet's volume and effects pedals because of <b>the</b> <b>pain</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> legs, he would go {{down on his knees}} to press them with his hand during performances. To relieve his pain and perform, he used codeine and morphine, smoked, and drank large quantities of Heineken beer. On several occasions, Davis was able to play two concerts in one day, as he did on February 1 at the Festival Hall in Osaka. [...] "The Japanese people were very beautiful", Henderson recalled from the concerts. [...] "They came in with their suit and ties on and we proceeded to blow the roof off the suckers with a million amplifiers." ...|$|E
60|$|After a time {{he seemed}} to wake up again, and waking, {{to know that he}} was at the front, and that he was killed. He did not open his eyes. Light was not yet <b>his.</b> <b>The</b> clanging <b>pain</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> head rang out the rest of his consciousness. So he lapsed away from consciousness, in unutterable sick abandon of life.|$|R
50|$|At the {{beginning}} of season three, House temporarily regains his ability to walk and run after receiving ketamine treatment for his gunshot injuries. However, <b>the</b> chronic <b>pain</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> leg comes back and House, who seems depressed because of <b>the</b> returning <b>pain,</b> takes painkillers and uses his cane once again. The other doctors speculate his cane and opiate re-usage are due to his psychological tendencies.|$|R
50|$|Having noticed <b>the</b> <b>pain</b> <b>in</b> which <b>his</b> {{mother was}} put in, he {{consolidated}} {{the intention to}} take a position that in the eyes of some Paraguayans was considered vile. Arturo Bray noted that Ferreira was a man of laws, but that the imperative of the facts made him assume positions such as enrolling in the ranks of the army. At age 19 he joined the Paraguayan Legion.|$|R
500|$|On May17,2002, Robert S. Stephens and Roger A. Roffman of The Seattle Times {{wrote an}} {{analysis}} of [...] "Weekend at Burnsie's" [...] in a guest column for the newspaper. The two argued that drugs are almost always shown as having only negative effects, even though 10million people in the United States use marijuana for recreational purposes. [...] "We believe {{there are good reasons}} for a more honest dialogue about the positive and negative effects of marijuana use. A recent episode of the popular TV show The Simpsons highlighted {{the pros and cons of}} marijuana use, and Homer Simpson's experiences with marijuana provide an example of what we mean", they wrote. For example, when under the influence of marijuana, Homer is relieved from <b>the</b> <b>pain</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> eye, and he also finds himself having a variety of sensory experiences and an enhanced appreciation of music and food. [...] "These are real effects reported by many marijuana users, and we would be hard pressed to call them anything other than benefits", Stephens and Roffman wrote. However, Homer is also depicted spending more time with other drug users than with his family, and his friends find that his personality has changed. Eventually, Homer is shown having problems with memory and attention, losing track of the date on which a pro-marijuana rally takes place. Stephens and Roffman wrote that the side effects shown in the episode are [...] "Perhaps a bit exaggerated, but clearly there are costs of marijuana use similar to these that are experienced by real-life users." ...|$|E
2500|$|Heim had {{to undergo}} a series of at least 50 {{operations}} [...] after a laboratory explosion resulted {{in the loss of}} his arms.

2500|$|The {{only person}} {{to survive the}} crash was Paul Olsen, {{one of the two}} radio operators. He was sitting in the aircraft's rear in one of the Catalina's side blisters. Upon impact he was ejected [...] from the aircraft. Olsen stated that he did not recall {{anything}} from the accident and that he initially was unconscious. After waking up he tried calling to the other crew members. He then tried to walk around, but <b>the</b> <b>pain</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> foot made this impossible. The aircraft was still on fire and he dared not approach it. Because of the aircraft's poor insulation, Olsen was wearing a leather jacket and a sheepskin sweater, which kept him warm until he was rescued.|$|E

60|$|He {{now made}} no further attempt {{to evade the}} menacing stare of the gun barrel.

5000|$|Although House's crankiness is {{commonly}} misattributed to <b>the</b> chronic <b>pain</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> leg, both Stacy and Cuddy {{have said that}} he was the same before the infarction. To handle <b>the</b> chronic <b>pain</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> leg, House takes Vicodin every day, and as a result has developed an addiction to the drug. He refuses to admit that he has an addiction ("I do not have a pain management problem, I have a pain problem"). However, after winning a bet from Cuddy by not taking the drug for a week, he concedes that he has an addiction, but says {{that it is not a}} problem because it does not interfere with his work or life. In the 2009 season House goes through detox and his addiction goes into remission, so to say. However, it does seem that House may have gotten over <b>his</b> addiction <b>in</b> the season 6 premiere. House creator David Shore told the Seattle Times in 2006 that Vicodin is [...] "becoming less and less useful a tool for dealing with his pain, and it's something writers are going to continue to deal with, continue to explore".|$|R
