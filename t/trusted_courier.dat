5|$|According to a U.S. official, in 2004 a {{prisoner}} named Hassan Ghul revealed that bin Laden {{relied on a}} <b>trusted</b> <b>courier</b> known as al-Kuwaiti. Ghul stated that al-Kuwaiti was close to bin Laden as well as Khalid Sheik Mohammed and Mohammed's successor Abu Faraj al-Libbi. Ghul revealed that al-Kuwaiti had not been seen in some time, which led U.S. officials to suspect he was traveling with bin Laden. When confronted with Ghul's account, Mohammed maintained his original story. Abu Faraj al-Libbi was captured in 2005 and transferred to Guantánamo in September 2006. He told CIA interrogators that bin Laden's courier was a man named Maulawi Abd al-Khaliq Jan and denied knowing al-Kuwaiti. Because both Mohammed and al-Libbi had minimized al-Kuwaiti's importance, officials speculated that {{he was part of}} bin Laden's inner circle.|$|E
50|$|During {{the early}} history of cryptography, two parties would rely upon a key that they would {{exchange}} by means of a secure, but non-cryptographic, method such as a face-to-face meeting or a <b>trusted</b> <b>courier.</b> This key, which both parties kept absolutely secret, could then be used to exchange encrypted messages. A number of significant practical difficulties arise with this approach to distributing keys.|$|E

50|$|The key {{exchange}} {{problem is}} how to exchange whatever keys or other information are needed {{so that no one}} else can obtain a copy. Historically, this required <b>trusted</b> <b>couriers,</b> diplomatic bags, or some other secure channel. With the advent of public key / private key cipher algorithms (i.e., asymmetric ciphers), the encrypting key (aka, the public key of a pair) could be made public, since (at least for high quality algorithms) no one without the decrypting key (aka, the private key of that pair) could decrypt the message.|$|R

50|$|In {{symmetric}} key cryptography, both parties must possess a secret key which they must exchange prior to using any encryption. Distribution of secret keys has been problematic until recently, because it involved face-to-face meeting, {{use of a}} <b>trusted</b> <b>courier,</b> or sending the key through an existing encryption channel. The first two are often impractical and always unsafe, while the third depends on {{the security of a}} previous key exchange.|$|E
50|$|Traditionally, secure {{encrypted}} {{communication between}} two parties required that they first exchange keys by some secure physical channel, such as paper key lists transported by a <b>trusted</b> <b>courier.</b> The Diffie-Hellman key exchange method allows two parties {{that have no}} prior knowledge of each other to jointly establish a shared secret key over an insecure channel. This key can then be used to encrypt subsequent communications using a symmetric key cipher.|$|E
50|$|Another {{method of}} key {{exchange}} involves encapsulating one key within another. Typically a master key is generated and exchanged using some secure method. This method is usually cumbersome or expensive (breaking a master key into multiple parts and sending {{each with a}} <b>trusted</b> <b>courier</b> for example) and not suitable for use on a larger scale. Once the master key has been securely exchanged, it can then be used to securely exchange subsequent keys with ease. This technique is usually termed Key Wrap. A common technique uses Block ciphers and cryptographic hash functions.|$|E

40|$|Introduction Steganography {{is the art}} {{and science}} of hiding {{information}} by embedding messages within other, seemingly harmless messages. Steganography means "covered writing" in Greek. As the goal of steganography is to hide {{the presence of a}} message, it {{can be seen as the}} complement of cryptography, whose goal is to hide the content of a message. A famous illustration of steganography is Simmons' "Prisoners' Problem" [10]: Alice and Bob are in jail, locked up in separate cells far apart from each other, and wish to devise an escape plan. They are allowed to communicate by means of sending messages via <b>trusted</b> <b>couriers,</b> provided they do not deal with escape plans. But the couriers are agents of the warden Eve (who plays the role of the adversary here) and will leak all communication to her. If Eve detects any sign of conspiracy, she will thwart the escape plans by transferring both prisoners to high-security cells from which nobody has ever escaped. Alice and Bob are well aware of t...|$|R

In August 1581 Thomas accompanied Sir Francis to Paris on a delicate diplomatic mission connected with the proposed marriage between Elizabeth and the French king's brother, Francis, Duke of Anjou. In 1584, still only 20 or 22 years of age, he was given a trusted position in the state's intelligence operation against Catholic plots, operating from his own office in Sir Francis's house in Seething Lane, next door to the Tower. He was allowed to relinquish this post in 1590, when he came into his inheritance. In 1596 he was appointed Justice of the Peace for the Kent hundred of Rokesley and he organised the local defences against the Armada. He was knighted soon afterwards, on a royal progress to Scadbury, a visit probably resulting from family connections at Court of Audrey, his wife. Audrey became a favourite of the queen and the couple were thereafter regular attenders at Court. In the following year he was elected Member of Parliament for Rochester.In 1614 he was returned to parliament as knight of the shire for Kent.|$|R

To avoid suspicion, politicians and warlords of the nominally neutral Anhui clique were enlisted to act as middlemen. For example, Anhui clique warlord Wu Guangxin (吴光新) was a <b>trusted</b> <b>courier</b> for both sides and relayed information by personally traveling between Beijing and Shenyang. When the Fengtian clique gave Feng Yuxiang 2,000,000 yen of Japanese bribes for his support and defection, the money was delivered by Anfu Club politician Jian Deyao (贾德耀).|$|E

40|$|The {{main problem}} {{associated}} with using symmetric/ asymmetric keys {{is how to}} securely store and exchange the keys between the parties over open networks particularly in the open environment such as cloud computing. Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) have been providing a practical solution for session key exchange for loads of web services. The key limitation of PKI solution {{is not only the}} need for a trusted third partly (e. g. certificate authority) but also the absent link between data owner and the encryption keys. The latter is arguably more important where accessing data needs to be linked with identify of the owner. Currently available key exchange protocols depend on using <b>trusted</b> <b>couriers</b> or secure channels, which can be subject to man-in-the-middle attack and various other attacks. This paper proposes a new protocol for Key Exchange using Biometric Identity Based Encryption (KE-BIBE) that enables parties to securely exchange cryptographic keys even an adversary is monitoring the communication channel between the parties. The proposed protocol combines biometrics with IBE in order to provide a secure way to access symmetric keys based on the identity of the users in unsecure environment. In the KE-BIOBE protocol, the message is first encrypted by the data owner using a traditional symmetric key before migrating it to a cloud storage. The symmetric key is then encrypted using public biometrics of the users selected by data owner to decrypt the message based on Fuzzy Identity-Based Encryption. Only the selected users will be able to decrypt the message by providing a fresh sample of their biometric data. The paper argues that the proposed solution eliminates the needs for a key distribution centre in traditional cryptography. It will also give data owner the power of fine-grained sharing of encrypted data by control who can access their data...|$|R
50|$|It is {{remarkable}} {{that many of}} those who were assigned to negotiate between Poland and the Teutonic Knights with Sigismund as a part in negotiations, were members of the Clan of Ostoja, creating picture of family meetings. It is also possible that Zawisza Czarny also was a relative to the Clan {{and the fact that he}} spent much time visiting many castles of the Clan during many years also show close connection between this famous Black Knight (named so because of wearing black armor) and the Ostoja. Another interesting fact is that King Jogaila was also a member of the Order of the Dragon, the most powerful association of Kings, Duke's and mighty Knights in Europe at that time. It was a secret society and there was never any member list done at the time. However, all members of this Order formed one political body against the enemy of Christianity (read Ottoman Empire). No member of the Order represented the Teutonic Knights. Secret meetings and agreements between Hungary and Poland and so between the Sigismund and Jogaila, using their most <b>trusted</b> <b>couriers,</b> question wherever there was ever any serious dispute between both ruling Kings. Declaring war against Poland in 1410 was more of a show in order to gain economic advantage from Teutonic Knights, than a real war. The facts remain, Teutonic Knights paid a considerable amount to Sigismund for declaring and attacking Poland from south. The outcome was small piece of land burned down to show the Teutonic Knights some action. The penalty paid by Teutonic side after losing the Battle of Grunwald was much bigger and was transferred as a loan to Sigismund. All together, the diplomatic game showed on paper that Poland and Hungary were enemies, but in reality they were close friends.|$|R

40|$|Quantum {{cryptography}} {{makes it}} possible to expand a short shared key (of e. g. 256 bits[1]) into an arbitrary long shared key. The novelty of quantum cryptography is that whenever a spy tries to eavesdrop the communication he causes disturbances in the transmission of the message. Ultimately this unavoidable disturbance is a consequence of Heisenberg's uncertainty principle that limits the joint knowledge of complementary observables. Now, a problem remains: in order to initialize quantum key distribution, Alice and Bob need to share a short shared key {{in order to be able}} to identify each other unambiguously. Therefore a <b>trusted</b> <b>courier</b> is needed. We propose in this paper a solution to the trusted courrier problem that was inspired by quantum cryptography. The idea is to encode the key that Alice sends to Bob into unstable nuclei in such a way that the message gets revealed only after the courrier has delivered it to Bob. In this approach, we replace Heisenberg uncertainties by another type of uncertainty, that characterizes the knowledge of the time at which an unstable nucleus decays. As we shall show, this scheme {{makes it possible}} to refresh a key even in the case that we do not trust the courier who carries the key.

40|$|Information {{security}} {{is a growing concern}} in our modern world, where almost everything can be done online. To protect security, classical encryption protocols, such as RSA, are used. These encryption protocols are almost always based on mathematical problems that are computational difficult. Therefore, the {{security is}} only valid under limited computational resources, and therefore do not provide provable security. An exception is the one-time pad protocol, which is provably secure but requires an existing shared key that is as long as the information it must encrypt. The exchange of such a key can be challenging, often requiring the two partied to physically meet to exchange the key or the use a <b>trusted</b> <b>courier</b> to physically carry the key on a hard drive. Quantum key distribution (QKD) offers a solution by utilizing quantum mechanics to grow a secure cryptographic key shared between two distant parties. The quantum nature of the particles used in the exchange ensure that any eavesdropper would leave signs of their presence, allowing the users to precisely quantify the security of the key that is produced. This allows secure generation of a random key which can be used for the one-time pad encryption protocol which, unlike most encryption protocols, does not rely on computational assumptions, and is secure regardless of available computational power. Current implementations of QKD are limited to a single link distance of ≈ 200 km, preventing implementation of QKD on a global scale, or even between distant cities within a single country, without some additional techniques. One promising solution is the use of orbiting low Earth orbit satellite platforms as trusted nodes in a quantum communications network. The main purpose of this work has been to show the viability of this solution, trough theoretical performance modeling and experimental demonstrations. Thorough numerical simulations have been developed to evaluate the performance and challenges in implementing QKD using a low Earth orbit satellite platform and determine an optimal approach to its implementation. The simulations include a realistic satellite orbit analysis, all expected loss mechanisms, estimates of background contributions and realistic simulation of quantum optical processes. This work addresses the questions of optimal wavelength and beam waist, the effect of the telescope design and pointing error, and the impact of detector degradation due to exposure to radiation in the space environment. The simulation is used to determine the length of secure key for QKD and the performance of fundamental quantum optics experiments such as Bell tests and quantum teleportation. We compare {{the advantages and disadvantages of}} uplink and dowlink scenarios, and show that an uplink, despite having reduced performance compared to a downlink, offers more scientific freedom, by allowing changes to the quantum source, and benefits from a simpler satellite design with reduced pointing requirement. This work provides a theoretical foundation for ongoing design and development of quantum systems for satellite implementation of QKD. In addition to theoretical analyses, experiments where developed and conducted corresponding to the challenges likely to be faced by a satellite uplink. Two main challenges where identified and experimentally overcome. First, the difficulty of operating in the high loss regime of a satellite uplink, which typically experience losses in the range of 40 - 50 dB when above 40 ° of elevation from the horizon, an elevation only reached by half of the satellite passes. This challenge was addressed by demonstrating full QKD protocols at losses exceeding 50 dB. Also, the ability to perform full QKD during the short duration of a satellite pass was shown by replicating the varying loss of archetypal passes and successfully extracting secure keys. Secondly, the difficulty of accurately tracking and pointing to a receiver platform traveling at the high angular speed of a satellite was overcome by successfully exchange quantum signals to a truck traveling at angular speeds exceeding that of a low Earth orbit satellite. This required the design, construction, and implementation of a transmitter system and a quantum receiver system capable of active pointing using a custom pointing system. An additional experiment was also performed where we experimentally investigate the feasibility of performing QKD using light scattered by a diffusive screen. A system capable of doing so could be used to create QKD hot-spots, where a QKD source could be aimed at a diffusive screen to allow multiple users to simultaneously exchange secure keys with the source without the need for high precision pointing. Through these analyses and experimental demonstrations we evaluated the performance of QKD using a satellite and have shown its technological readiness to be implemented. Implementation of such a system would allow QKD to be performed on a global scale, enabling communications security that is not based on computational assumptions without the need to physically transport the key from one party to the other...|$|E

If you truly want to keep the information secret, you need to agree on some sort of key that you and he can use to encode/decode messages. But you don’t want to keep using the same key, or you will make it easier and easier for others to crack your cipher. But it’s also a pain to get keys to your friend. If you mail them, they might be stolen. If you send them cryptographically, and someone has broken your code, that person will also have the next key.

One solution is provided by digital signature as digital signatures are used to detect unauthorized modifications to data and to authenticate the identity of the signatory. Both security algorithms have their flaws and benefits and they both prove to handy in long term with some compromise.
