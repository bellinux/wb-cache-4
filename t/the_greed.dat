5|$|The most {{prominent}} themes are the anti-war and environmental {{focus of the}} film. Nausicaä, the heroine, believes {{in the value of}} life regardless of its form and through her actions stops a war. Loy and Goodhew state there is no evil portrayed in the film, but the Buddhist roots of evil: greed, ill will and delusion. Fear is what drives the conflicts, the fear of the poisoned forest results in <b>the</b> <b>greed</b> and resentment. Nausicaä, {{in addition to being a}} transformative force, leads people to understand and respect nature which is portrayed as welcoming, spiritual, and restorative for those who enter it peacefully.|$|E
5|$|The film {{presents}} {{examples of}} crowd psychology and collective behavior {{which can lead}} to mass hysteria and the loss of social order. The bafflement, outrage, and helplessness associated with the lack of information, combined with new media such as blogs, allow conspiracy theorists like Krumwiede to spread disinformation and fear, which become dangerous contagions themselves. Dr. Cheever must balance the need for full disclosure but avoid a panic and allow the time to characterize and respond to an unknown virus. The movie indirectly critiques <b>the</b> <b>greed,</b> selfishness, and hypocrisy of isolated acts in contemporary culture and the unintended consequences they can have {{in the context of a}} pandemic. For example, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends social distancing by forcibly isolating the healthy to limit the spread of the disease, which stands in stark opposition to contemporary demands for social networking. Responding to the pandemic presents a paradox, as the contagiousness and lethality of the virus instills deep distrust of others but surviving and limiting the spread of the disease also requires individuals to work together.|$|E

Turunen responded through an open letter on her website and through some interviews in which she explained her view. She was upset that after nine years of working together, Holopainen announced the separation via an open letter. Because of the continuing media interest, Marcelo Cabuli posted a message addressing the situation on the website in February 2006. He asked that anyone who had questions should email him. In June 2006, Cabuli posted a lengthy reply to many of the questions he had received. He answered questions related to <b>the</b> <b>greed</b> accusation by explaining that the band had agreed on the distribution of earnings in a contract at the formation of Nightwish. Based on that contract, every band member got a fixed share of 20% of the band's income. Marcelo Cabuli stated that, unlike others, Turunen had never fought for additional songwriter royalties.|$|E

Things did not go as well as they were supposed to, and Vane was kicked out of the band just before they got into the studio to record the new album. And so Greenway returned to Napalm Death.|$|E
25|$|By the 12th {{century the}} only known bourgeois were the {{multinational}} inhabitants of Compostela, by this stage a fortified and strong city. Meanwhile, the City Council of Santiago for centuries had struggled against their bishops for the recognition {{of a number of}} liberties. In the country, most people were freemen, peasants, artisans, or infantrymen, who could freely choose a patron, or buy and sell properties, although they frequently fell prey to <b>the</b> <b>greed</b> of the big owners, leading many of them to a life of servitude. Finally, servos, libertos, and pueros (serfs and slaves), either obtained in war with the Moors or through trial, constituted a visible part of the society; they were employed as household workers (domesticos and scancianes), shepherds, and farmhands. Local charters also show that, in time, they were freed.|$|E

25|$|The Buddhist {{religious}} establishment discovered {{new opportunities}} for political gain and financial profit.

There is a commonly held misconception that, over time, <b>the</b> <b>greed</b> of the Buddhist religious establishment so disaffected the lay nobility that it came to reject the very principles of theocracy upon which the new country had been founded. According to Mongolian and Russian sources, the Mongolian society was generally satisfied with the theocracy but there were different views on future development of the country.|$|E

The first OVA series was directed by Satoshi Saga and ran for eight episodes in four released volumes from January 17 to April 17, 2002. The second OVA series, Hunter × Hunter: Greed Island, was directed by Yukihiro Matsushita and ran for eight episodes in four released volumes from February 19 to May 21, 2003.

25|$|Certain {{authors have}} prostitutes talking about themselves: Lucian in his Dialogue of courtesans or Alciphron in his {{collection}} of letters; but these are works of fiction. The prostitutes of concern here are either independent or hetaera: the sources here do not concern themselves with the situation of slave-prostitutes, except to consider them {{as a source of}} profit. It is quite clear what ancient Greek men thought of prostitutes: primarily, they are reproached for the commercial nature of the activity. <b>The</b> <b>greed</b> of prostitutes is a running theme in Greek comedy. The fact that prostitutes were the only Athenian women who handled money likely increased male acrimony. An explanation for their behavior is that a prostitute's career tended to be short, and their income decreased with the passage of time: a young and pretty prostitute, across all levels of the trade, could earn more money than her older, less attractive colleagues. To provide for old age, they thus had to acquire as much money as possible in a limited period of time.|$|E

40|$|In {{this thesis}} I {{present the results}} of an {{exploratory}} study into the extraction and the application of the low- energy eigenmode spectrum of the Wilson-Dirac Operator. To extract the eigenmode spectrum I use the Arnoldi Method to partially diagonalize the Wilson-Dirac Operator in an ensemble of Monte Carlo generated SU(3) gauge- fields. I use the low-energy eigenmodes in two distinct ways, one that relies on the properties of the individual eigenmodes, and one that relies on the spectrum of eigenmodes. I use the individual eigenmodes to present evidence that shows that instantons do not dominate the QCD vacuum, and to demonstrate that OZI suppression is evident in the eigenmodes of low-energy QCD. I use the spectrum to construct <b>the</b> <b>Greeds</b> function of <b>the</b> Wilson- Dirac Operator using the Eigenmode Approximation. This approach is novel because it does not rely on matrix inversion to obtain <b>the</b> <b>Greeds</b> Function, instead it explicitly constructs it using a truncated eigenmode expansion. I constructed the single Green's function and tested the Eigenmode Approximation's strength in the calculation of the winding number of gauge fields and found that only the lowest energy eigenmodes contribute in a significant way to the winding number. I next constructed a two Green's function system, the valence pion propagator and found that it is not effectively modeled using the low-energy spectrum...|$|R
