5|$|Bevelle, {{the spiritual}} {{center of the}} Yevon religion, lies on a <b>thin</b> <b>strip</b> of land {{slightly}} north of Macalania. The city is built {{as a series of}} layers, with the headquarters of Yevon located at the top. The Via Purifico, located beneath Bevelle, serves as an oubliette for outcasts. Further north are the Calm Lands, a series of plains that have been the site of numerous battles in Spira's history; the Cavern of the Stolen Fayth, an equally historical area; and Mt. Gagazet, home of the Ronsos. Lastly, the sacred city of Zanarkand is on the northern tip of the Spiran mainland, reduced to ruins by Sin one thousand years before the events of Final Fantasy X.|$|E
5|$|After the German Army {{captured}} much of Belgium {{following the}} Battle of the Frontiers in 1914, the Allied forces were left holding a <b>thin</b> <b>strip</b> of coastline {{to the west}} of the Yser. The remainder of the Belgian coast came under the occupation of German Marine Divisions, including the important strategic ports of Antwerp and Bruges. A network of canals connected Bruges with the coast at Ostend and Zeebrugge, through which small warships such as destroyers, light cruisers and submarines could travel and find a safe harbour from which to launch raids into the English Channel and along the coasts of southeast England. U-boats could also depart from Bruges at night, cutting a day off the journey to the Western Approaches, more easily avoiding the North Sea Mine Barrage and allowing U-boat captains to gain familiarity with the net and mine defences of the English Channel, through which they had to pass to reach the main battlegrounds of the Atlantic.|$|E
5|$|US-89 leaves Salt Lake City at exit 312 of I-15, {{where it}} acts as I-15's {{frontage}} roads. Just south of I-15's junction with I-215, US-89 splits to the northeast, passing through Bountiful and Woods Cross. A northerly curve onto 500 West removes the highway from Bountiful's Main Street, and it merges with I-15 at exit 317 to bypass Centerville and Farmington, where the old road (former US-91, but never US-89) is SR-106, through the narrow strip of land that separates Farmington Bay from the Wasatch Mountains. US-89 leaves I-15 at exit 324, where the Legacy Parkway also ends, and proceeds north on a freeway. This portion of US-89 {{is the only one}} to include exit numbers based on its own mileage, as opposed to the overlapping I-15 or I-70. The freeway ends after US-89 crosses SR-273, the former surface alignment of US-91 in both directions, and heads north as a four-lane road along the Wasatch foothills, to the east of Layton and Hill Air Force Base. After crossing I-84 in Uintah, US-89 enters Ogden, which it traverses via Washington Boulevard, rejoining old US-91 (now SR-26) south of downtown. Beyond Ogden, US-89 continues in a general northerly direction along the <b>thin</b> <b>strip</b> between Willard Bay and the Wasatch Mountains to Brigham City, where it finally turns east away from the I-15 corridor.|$|E

5|$|Uttar Pradesh, with a {{total area}} of , is India’s fourth-largest state in terms of land area. It is {{situated}} on the northern spout of India and shares an international boundary with Nepal. The Himalayas border the state on the north, but the plains that cover {{most of the state}} are distinctly different from those high mountains. The larger Gangetic Plain region is in the north; it includes the Ganges-Yamuna Doab, the Ghaghra plains, the Ganges plains and the Terai. The smaller Vindhya Range and plateau region is in the south. It is characterised by hard rock strata and a varied topography of hills, plains, valleys and plateaus. The Bhabhar tract gives place to the terai area which is covered with tall elephant grass and thick forests interspersed with marshes and swamps. The sluggish rivers of the bhabhar deepen in this area, their course running through a tangled mass of thick undergrowth. The terai runs parallel to the bhabhar in a <b>thin</b> <b>strip.</b> The entire alluvial plain is divided into three sub-regions. The first in the eastern tract consisting of 14 districts which are subject to periodical floods and droughts and have been classified as scarcity areas. These districts have the highest density of population which gives the lowest per capita land. The other two regions, the central and the western are comparatively better with a well-developed irrigation system. They suffer from waterlogging and large-scale user tracts. In addition, the area is fairly arid. The state has more than 32 large and small rivers; of them, the Ganges, Yamuna, Saraswati, Sarayu, Betwa, and Ghaghara are larger and of religious importance in Hinduism.|$|E

25|$|This wine {{district}} {{is composed of}} a <b>thin</b> <b>strip</b> of land along the Luxembourg border. The region starts just north of Igel and continues south {{to the village of}} Palzem where it meets the Moseltor district.

25|$|A twist tie is a {{metal wire}} that is {{encased in a}} <b>thin</b> <b>strip</b> of paper or plastic and is used to tie the {{openings}} of bags, such as garbage bags or bread bags. A twist tie is used by wrapping it around the item to be fastened, then twisting the ends together. The original twist tie was invented by the California-based packaging company T and T Industries, Inc. It was patented in 1939 and marketed as the Twist-Ems.|$|E
25|$|Until the 1997 general election, Berkhamsted was, with Hemel Hempstead, part of {{the former}} West Hertfordshire {{parliamentary}} constituency. The town {{is now in the}} South West Hertfordshire constituency represented in the House of Commons since 2005 by David Gauke, a Conservative. At the General Election 2015 he had a majority of over 23,000. The constituency seat forms a <b>thin</b> <b>strip</b> along the southwest border of Hertfordshire, from South Oxhey (near Watford) in the south, through interspersed settlements including Chipperfield, Chorleywood, Croxley Green, Moor Park and Rickmansworth to Tring in the north.|$|E
25|$|If {{the strip}} is cut along {{about a third}} of the way in from the edge, it creates two strips: One is a thinner Möbius strip – it is the center third of the {{original}} strip, comprising one-third of the width and the same length as the original strip. The other is a longer but <b>thin</b> <b>strip</b> with two full twists in it – this is a neighborhood of the edge of the original strip, and it comprises one-third of the width and twice the length of the original strip.|$|E

25|$|The term Lontara {{has also}} come to refer to {{literature}} regarding Bugis history and genealogy, including the Sure’ Galigo creation myth. Historically, Lontara was also used {{for a range of}} documents including contracts, trade laws, treaties, maps, and journals. These documents are commonly written in a contemporary-like book form, but they can be written in a traditional palm-leaf manuscript also called Lontara, in which a long, <b>thin</b> <b>strip</b> of dried lontar is rolled to a wooden axis in similar manner to a tape recorder. The text is then read by scrolling the lontar strip from left to right.|$|E

While the crew is back in England, three soldiers are killed in a friendly fire incident. Eight days after, the crew returned to Afghanistan for a second tour in late August for three weeks. On returning to the UK, Kemp met Defence Secretary Des Browne and gave MPs a preview of the series at the House of Commons.|$|E
25|$|Passing is {{the most}} basic and common thread used in goldwork; it {{consists}} of a <b>thin</b> <b>strip</b> of metal wound around a core of cotton or silk. For gold thread this is typically yellow, or in older examples orange; for silver, white or gray. This is always attached by couching, either one or two threads at a time, and pulled through to the back to secure it. When multiple threads must be laid next to each other, a technique called bricking is used: {{the position of the}} couching stitches is offset between rows, producing an appearance similar to a brick wall. This same type of thread is used in making cloth of gold.|$|E

25|$|In {{the eighth}} and ninth {{years of his}} reign, Ramesses {{extended}} his military successes; this time, he proved more successful against his Hittite foes when he successfully captured the cities of Dapur and Tunip, where no Egyptian soldier had been seen {{since the time of}} Thutmose III almost 120 years previously. His victory proved to be ephemeral, however. The <b>thin</b> <b>strip</b> of territory pinched between Amurru and Kadesh did not make for a stable possession. Within a year, they had returned to the Hittite fold, which meant that Ramesses had to march against Dapur once more in his tenth year. His second success here was equally as meaningless as his first, since neither Egypt nor Hatti could decisively defeat the other in battle.|$|E
25|$|The {{color and}} {{markings}} of a Rottweiler are very distinctive. A Rottweiler is always, by any breed club standards, black with well-defined mahogany or rust-colored markings {{that do not}} take up more than {{ten percent of the}} dog's body color. All Rottweilers standard to AKC specifications have one mahogany dot above each eye on the inner brow ridge, on the cheeks, one strip {{on each side of the}} snout; cheek markings do not cross over the bridge of the nose, the top of the nose should remain black. The markings on the face should move down onto the dog's throat. On the chest, a Rottweiler will have two downward-facing triangular marks. On each front leg, the marks will stretch from the forearm to the toes. On the hind legs, the markings will begin on the inside and move outward onto the stifle, then out onto the hock stretching to the toes as well. AKC standards recognize that the black base color is not completely voided on the rear pasterns. There is a patch of rust or mahogany underneath the tail that resembles a triangle as well. A <b>thin</b> <b>strip</b> of black should be present on each of the Rottweiler's toes.|$|E
