5|$|The Pharisee Nicodemus {{supports}} Christ {{as he is}} lowered, and can {{be identified}} by his similarity to Simon the Pharisee in another canvas attributed to Bouts, Christ in the House of Simon. The Virgin wears a white headdress and a dark blue dress with a yellowish mantle, and holds Christ's arm just above his wrist as if afraid {{to let go of}} her dead son. She is supported by John the Evangelist, who wears a red robe. Dressed in green robes, Mary Salome stands to the Virgin's left, wiping <b>tears</b> <b>from</b> her face with the fold of her white headdress. Mary of Clopas is behind them, holding a red cloth over her mouth, while the Magdalen is in the foreground at Christ's feet, dressed in a heavily folded cloak. The man in the brown–green tabard at the feet of Christ is probably Joseph of Arimathea, who, according to Gospel, brought Christ's body to Golgotha from Pontius Pilate.|$|E
25|$|Although Garrick {{restored}} {{a considerable}} amount of Shakespeare's text in 1756, it was by no means a complete return to Shakespeare, and he continued to play Tate's Lear in some form {{to the end of his}} career. His performances met with enormous success, and continued to draw <b>tears</b> <b>from</b> his audiences, even without Shakespeare's final, tragic scene where Lear enters with Cordelia's body in his arms.|$|E
25|$|More than 100 {{people were}} present in the {{courtroom}} as the tape was played, and many members of both the jury and the audience wept openly upon hearing the contents, with several members of the audience either burying their heads in their hands, daubing <b>tears</b> <b>from</b> their eyes or rushing out of the courtroom before the tape had finished. Bittaker was undisturbed at hearing the contents of the tape—smiling throughout the hearing of the recording.|$|E

25|$|The {{character}} {{is named after}} Eru from Mashima's one-shot manga {{that served as a}} pilot for Fairy Tail. Mashima initially designed her to only shed <b>tears</b> <b>from</b> one eye due to a defect with her artificial eye, but he eventually abandoned this aspect after accidentally drawing some scenes where Erza has tears flowing from both eyes. He also said that he often forgets what Erza's armor looks like, and changes the design every time she appears.|$|E
25|$|Debra once left a Red Sox game, when Clemens pitched {{for another}} team, in <b>tears</b> <b>from</b> the {{heckling}} she received. This is documented in an updated later edition to Dan Shaughnessy's best-selling book, Curse of the Bambino.

25|$|Veratrum nigrum {{contains}} more than 200 steroid-derived alkaloids, including isorubijervine, jervine, pseudojervine, rubijervine, tienmuliumine, tienmuliluminine, and verazine. The herb causes irritation of mucous membranes. When ingested, the irritation of the mucosal membranes of the stomach and intestines will cause nausea and vomiting. If the herb is introduced to the nose, this mucosal irritation will cause sneezing and coughing. Ingestion can also cause bradycardia (slow heart rate), hyperactivity, and hypotension (low blood pressure). In high concentrations, topical contact can cause skin irritation, excessive <b>tears</b> <b>from</b> the eyes, and redness.|$|E

25|$|Retinal {{detachment}} can be mitigated in {{some cases}} when the warning signs are caught early. The most effective means of prevention and risk reduction is through education of the initial signs, and encouragement for people to seek ophthalmic medical attention if they have symptoms suggestive of a posterior vitreous detachment. Early examination allows detection of retinal tears {{which can be treated}} with laser or cryotherapy. This reduces the risk of retinal detachment in those who have <b>tears</b> <b>from</b> around 1:3 to 1:20. For this reason, the governing bodies in some sports require regular eye examination.|$|E
25|$|Dongalor and his advisor Barnabus (Alex MacQueen) try {{to extract}} <b>tears</b> <b>from</b> the kidnapped women by torturing them, {{whipping}} them and peeling onions {{in front of}} them, to no avail. Dongalor also tries staging a tragic play with a boy saying goodbye to his dog because his father cannot afford the pet due {{to the death of}} his mother, but the Pagan women are unmoved, although Dongalor cries like a baby. Meanwhile, Longshaft tells Kröd and his three friends to go to the Hessemeel Mountains, through the Forest of Certain Death, and light a pyre {{at the top of a}} tower to warn the other freedom fighters about the pending danger. The foursome go through the forest, where they find a strong man has been savagely killed. They are approached by three beautiful wenches, who insist a group of banshees just tried to kill them. When they seek romance from the group, the homosexual Bruce is the only one who is skeptical, until the wenches bring a gay man from the forest for him. The wenches, who are revealed to be Succubi, impregnate Loquasto and Zezelryck after kissing them, as does the Incubus after kissing Bruce.|$|E
25|$|After {{spending}} the night in Grimshank's room and waking up as humans, Kröd and his men steal the vial of tears, throw the canine tooth {{out the window and}} tie up Grimshank. Kröd reveals to Aneka (India de Beaufort) and Ralph Longshaft (James Murray) that Grimshank is a traitor, but Grimshank insists he had to do it so that he could get close to Dongalor and stop him. Aneka is thrilled Kröd is still alive, but when Longshaft reveals that he and Aneka have been having sex, a disheartened Kröd gives him the Pagan tears, much to Grimshank's horror. Suddenly, Dongalor arrives with his army and Longshaft, who reveals himself to be the true traitor, gives him the tears. Kröd says the tears are fake and that he simply was trying to expose the real traitor, but Dongalor calls out his guards and takes the real <b>tears</b> <b>from</b> Kröd (Krod tries to swallow the vial, but ends up choking it up into Dongalor's hands: Aneka, Longshaft and Dongalor's advisor Barnabus (Alex MacQueen) then make cutting remarks about what he could have done with the vial). An annoyed Grimshank explains he planned to give the tears to Dongalor then use his powers to turn the weapon against him, but that he is now powerless without his canine tooth and cannot help. However, Loquasto, Zezelryck and Bruce arrive to fend off the guards and a battle ensues.|$|E

500|$|Tamil {{magazine}} Ananda Vikatan, in {{its original}} review of the film dated 20 December 1964, mentioned that {{the highlight of the}} film was Nagesh's acting and the film gave the experience of conversing and enjoying with friends in a car journey without living much impact. Tamil Canadian journalist D. B. S. Jeyaraj stated that Nagesh [...] "played the [...] "server" [...] (waiter) role to perfection", that the film gave him [...] "another dimension as an actor who could evoke <b>tears</b> <b>from</b> the audience through his emotional performance" [...] and that Server Sundaram was one film in which he [...] "provided stellar displays of his histrionic talents".|$|E
500|$|The {{author of}} the text is [...] , which has been {{discovered}} recently. [...] means Way of the Cross, literally the stations of the cross presented along {{a way to be}} walked in meditation, but often a general description of the way of a Christian following Jesus [...] "carrying the cross" [...] in life and death. The text refers indirectly to the Gospel. Although there is no explicit reference to the sick man in the text, he appears as a follower of Christ who bears his cross and suffers torment until the end, when in the words of [...] "God shall wipe away the <b>tears</b> <b>from</b> their eyes". The cantata accordingly takes as its starting point the torment that the faithful must endure, told in the first person.|$|E
500|$|Some {{families}} of servicemen and servicewomen {{who were killed}} in Iraq reacted angrily to the book, in which Blair does not apologise for the invasion. [...] "I can't regret the decision to go to war. I can say never did I guess the bloody, destructive and chaotic nightmare that unfolded—and that too is part of the responsibility," [...] he says in the book. Reg Keys, whose son Tom Keys was killed in Iraq in 2003, said that the book was [...] "just crocodile <b>tears</b> <b>from</b> Blair." [...] Keys said, [...] "The tears he claims to have shed are nothing like the tears I and my wife have shed for our son. They are nothing like the tears that tens of thousands of Iraqis have shed for their loved ones. They don't even come close to it. They seem to me like crocodile tears. It is a cynical attempt to sanitise his legacy." [...] A spokesperson for Military Families Against the War said that Blair's expression of regret over the loss of life was [...] "completely meaningless." [...] The spokesperson added, [...] "He has to prove his regret and giving money to charity doesn't come close. He is giving a minuscule amount compared to the cost of war and rehabilitation of injured soldiers. It is laughable." ...|$|E

500|$|When the 2000 Republican National Convention {{began in}} Philadelphia {{at the end}} of July, McCain took his Straight Talk Express to meet with his delegates and {{supporters}} before formally releasing them to Bush. [...] There were <b>tears</b> <b>from</b> McCain, his wife Cindy, and some of the campaign staff and delegates. [...] Many of McCain's supporters were vocally unhappy with his words of support for Bush, and the Times wrote that, [...] "Politics as usual with its compromises, cruelties and emotional costs — caught up with Senator John McCain this weekend." [...] McCain made a point of having Cindy McCain head the Arizona delegation at the convention, not his antagonist Governor Hull. [...] On August 1, the second night of the convention, McCain delivered a speech in praise of Bush, in particular trying to solidify Bush's national security and foreign policy credentials. In it, McCain connected his family to Bush's, making reference to former President George H. W. Bush's combat service as a naval aviator in the Pacific Theater of World War II under Admiral John S. McCain, Sr., McCain's grandfather. [...] He said directly of the nominee, [...] "I support him. I am grateful to him. And I am proud of him."
