5|$|Kinematic {{studies of}} {{matter in the}} Milky Way and other galaxies have {{demonstrated}} {{that there is more}} mass than can be accounted for by visible matter. A dark matter halo appears to dominate the mass, although the nature of <b>this</b> <b>dark</b> matter remains undetermined.|$|E

5|$|The {{emergence}} of a woman writing {{in the press and}} composing poetry in <b>this</b> <b>dark</b> era was a significant event. Our recent history shows that it was rare for even men to read and write; her appearance in these dark nights was thus like a bright star {{in the center of the}} heavens.|$|E

50|$|The ramparts {{beyond the}} rim {{have a lower}} albedo than the {{interior}} for a distance of over a hundred kilometers, and are free of the ray markings that lie beyond. <b>This</b> <b>darker</b> rim may have been formed from minerals excavated during the impact.|$|R
5|$|An {{unidentified}} dark parrot seen {{alive by}} the Swedish naturalist Fredrik Hasselqvist in Africa {{was given the}} name Psittacus obscurus by Linnaeus in 1758, who again synonymised it with the Mascarene parrot in 1766. Because of this association, some authors believed {{it was from the}} Mascarene Islands as well, but <b>this</b> <b>dark</b> parrot's description differs from that of the Mascarene parrot. This disagreement led some authors to use now-invalid combinations of the scientific names, such as Mascarinus obscurus and Coracopsis obscura. The unidentified parrot may have been an African grey parrot (Psittacus erithacus) instead.|$|E
5|$|Nothing {{is known}} about the {{internal}} structure of Puck. It is probably made of a mixture of water ice with the dark material similar to that found in the rings. <b>This</b> <b>dark</b> material is probably made of rocks or radiation-processed organics. The absence of craters with bright rays implies that Puck is not differentiated, meaning that ice and non-ice components have not separated from each other into a core and mantle.|$|E
5|$|The {{differences}} between subspecies are small, making subspecific boundaries hard to define, and the exact distribution of S. a. heineken is unclear, since birds from northwest Africa {{may be of}} this form. About 2% of male blackcaps on Madeira and the Azores are melanistic, with black plumage on the whole head and upper breast. Melanistic females are rarer, and are characterised by grey-brown underparts. <b>This</b> <b>dark</b> morph has also been recorded from the Canary Islands, but not from Cape Verde. The melanistic birds were formerly sometimes {{considered to be a}} distinct subspecies, S. a. obscura.|$|E
25|$|The {{motif of}} bureaucratic absurdity is further {{explored}} in 1994's Closing Time, Heller's sequel to Catch-22. <b>This</b> <b>darker,</b> slower-paced, apocalyptic novel explores the pre- and post-war lives {{of some of}} the major characters in Catch-22, with particular emphasis on the relationship between Yossarian and tail gunner Sammy Singer.|$|R

5|$|Throughout {{the history}} of fabric {{production}} natural dyes {{have been used to}} apply a form of colour, with dyes from plants, including indigo from Woad, having dozens of compounds whose proportions may vary according to soil type and climate; therefore giving rise to variations in shade. In the case of the Saltire, variations in shades of blue have resulted in the background of the flag ranging from sky blue to navy blue. When incorporated as part of the Union Flag during the 17th century, the dark blue applied to Union Flags destined for maritime use was possibly {{selected on the basis of}} the durability of darker dyes, with <b>this</b> <b>dark</b> blue shade eventually becoming standard on Union Flags both at sea and on land. Some flag manufacturers selected the same navy blue colour trend of the Union Flag for the Saltire itself, leading to a variety of shades of blue being depicted on the flag of Scotland.|$|E
25|$|Upon Cassio's exit, <b>this</b> <b>dark</b> tone rapidly becomes {{predominant}} as the gestures {{which opened}} the act repeat, but this time, will a full string and woodwind section. The famous aria that follows ("Credo in un Dio crudel") {{is marked by}} trills in the lowest clarinet register and quick yet powerfully accented notes played by the full orchestra at several intervals that portray the evil of Iago to its fullest extent.|$|E
25|$|The {{landscape}} surrounding Devils Tower {{is composed}} mostly of sedimentary rocks. The oldest rocks visible in Devils Tower National Monument were {{laid down in}} a shallow sea during the Triassic period, 225 to 195 million years ago. <b>This</b> <b>dark</b> red sandstone and maroon siltstone, interbedded with shale, can be seen along the Belle Fourche River. Oxidation of iron minerals causes the redness of the rocks. This rock layer {{is known as the}} Spearfish Formation.|$|E

50|$|On {{the other}} hand, Hokkien char mee, {{which is more}} common in central Peninsular Malaysia and {{particularly}} the Klang Valley, was originally developed in Kuala Lumpur. By default in the Klang Valley, the term Hokkien mee refers to <b>this</b> <b>darker,</b> stir fried variant. The Penang variant is sometimes referred to as mee yoke.|$|R
25|$|A {{dark age}} of poverty, low {{population}} and metals starvation is not {{compatible with the}} idea of great population movements of successful warriors wielding the latest military equipment sweeping into the Peloponnesus and taking it over to rebuild civilization their way. <b>This</b> <b>dark</b> age consists of three periods of art and archaeology: sub-Mycenaean, Proto-geometric and Geometric. The most successful, the Geometric, seems to fit the Dorians better, but there is a gap, and this period is not localized to and did not begin in Dorian territory. It is more to be associated with Athens, an Ionian state.|$|E
25|$|With {{the help}} of her family, and the stirrings of {{religious}} faith, Natasha manages to persevere in Moscow through <b>this</b> <b>dark</b> period. Meanwhile, the whole of Russia is affected by the coming confrontation between Napoleon's troops and the Russian army. Pierre convinces himself through gematria that Napoleon is the Antichrist of the Book of Revelation. Old Prince Bolkonsky dies of a stroke knowing that French marauders are coming for his estate. No organized help from any Russian army seems available to the Bolkonskys, but Nikolai Rostov turns up at their estate in time to help put down an incipient peasant revolt. He finds himself attracted to the distraught Princess Maria.|$|E
25|$|The {{increasing}} number of messages and social relationships embedded in SNS also increases the amount of social information demanding a reaction from SNS users. Consequently, SNS users perceive they are giving too much social support to other SNS friends. <b>This</b> <b>dark</b> side of SNS usage is called 'social overload'. It {{is caused by the}} extent of usage, number of friends, subjective social support norms, and type of relationship (online-only vs offline friends) while age has only an indirect effect. The psychological and behavioral consequences of social overload include perceptions of SNS exhaustion, low user satisfaction, and high intentions to reduce or stop using SNS.|$|E

50|$|David Gedge {{originally}} recorded Take Fountain as {{the fourth}} Cinerama album, {{but after the}} break-up {{of his relationship with}} fellow Cinerama founder Sally Murrell, Gedge decided that <b>this</b> <b>darker</b> record should be released under his Wedding Present name. Take Fountain is the band's first album release since 1996's Saturnalia, and returns to the noisy, jangly, intelligent indie sound of old.|$|R
25|$|Those species {{which have}} {{relatively}} large dry seeds have a dark, crust-like (crustose) outer layer containing the pigment phytomelan. However, some species with hairy seeds (e.g. Eriospermum, family Asparagaceae s.l.), berries (e.g. Maianthemum, family Asparagaceae s.l.), or highly reduced seeds (e.g. orchids) lack <b>this</b> <b>dark</b> pigment in their seed coats. Phytomelan {{is not unique}} to Asparagales (i.e. it is not a synapomorphy) but it is common within the order and rare outside it. The inner portion of the seed coat is usually completely collapsed. In contrast, the morphologically similar seeds of Liliales have no phytomelan, and usually retain a cellular structure in the inner portion of the seed coat.|$|E
25|$|Another serious fire {{occurred}} in Hastings {{in the spring}} of 1864, by which a fine brick store and a large stock of goods were almost entirely destroyed. Hastings was buoyant, rapidly progressive, and looking forward to the time ere long, it might become an incorporated village, when these severe disasters, followed by the general depression occasioned by scant harvests, and the embarrassment of the agricultural community, placed a barrier against further progress, and caused a withdrawal of a portion of the inhabitants to seek more remunerative employment elsewhere. But <b>this</b> <b>dark</b> day, it is believed, has to a threat extent passed away; and increased hope and renewed enterprise promise ere long to restore this fine village to more than its former prosperity.|$|E
25|$|As {{part of the}} {{rebranding}} of the New Zealand Railways Corporation {{during the}} 1980s, a new dark blue livery {{was applied to the}} TranzAlpine, with a horizontal full-length 220mm thick white stripe sandwiching a 100mm thick red band. The name InterCity was imposed into the stripe as well. <b>This</b> <b>dark</b> blue livery would become standard and remain contemporary until 18 October 1995. In 1990, when New Zealand Rail Limited took over rail operations from the Corporation, the InterCity livery was modified to facilitate the new blue and yellow primary colours, and the red band on carriage sides was replaced by a 100mm yellow one. In 1993-1994 the yellow band was replaced by a green 100mm band, the white stripe and dark blue livery retained. In 1995, a new full-length 350mm light blue stripe, incorporating the Tranz Scenic logo was introduced on cars that were not painted all over in the new blue colour scheme. However, during the 1995 rebranding, the TranzAlpine cars were the first long-distance passenger cars to receive the new paint scheme and did not wear the transitional light blue stripe.|$|E
50|$|During {{the last}} years of the nineteenth century, a {{brooding}} element entered his work, perhaps the result of turmoil in his private life, as he left his wife, Anna, and took up with her younger sister, Signe, and was often short of money. <b>This</b> <b>darker</b> quality in his paintings gradually began to attract interest, and he had paintings exhibited at the Paris Salon.|$|R

25|$|The case of soil {{management}} in the Neotropics (including the Amazon) {{is a classic example}} of beneficial results of human-mediated disturbance. In this area, prehistoric peoples altered the texture and chemical composition of natural soils. The altered black and brown earths, known as Amazon Dark Earths, or Terra preta, are actually much more fertile than unaltered surrounding soils. Furthermore, the increased soil fertility improves the results of agriculture. Terra preta is characterized by the presence of charcoal in high concentrations, along with pottery shards and organic residues from plants, animal bones, and feces. It is also shows increased levels of nutrients such as nitrogen, phosphorus, calcium, zinc, and manganese; along with high levels of microorganic activity. It is now accepted that these soils are a product of a labor-intensive technique termed slash-and-char. In contrast to the commonly known slash-and-burn technique, this uses a lower temperature burn that produces more charcoal than ashes. Research shows these soils were created by human activity between 9000 and 2500 years ago. Contemporary local farmers actively seek out and sell <b>this</b> <b>dark</b> earth, which covers around 10% of the Amazon basin. Harvesting Terra preta does not deplete it however, for it has the ability to regenerate at the rate of one centimeter per year by sequestering more carbon.|$|E
25|$|Prior to World War II Jewish {{life and}} culture played an {{important}} role in the whole Hesselberg region. Jewish settlers had already been mentioned in writs in the 14th century and many Jews achieved eminence as merchants and scholars. The National Socialists were active in the villages around Hesselberg, they destroyed synagogues and expelled or displaced Jews to internment camps. The notorious anti-semitic publisher Julius Streicher, as the head of the Frankish Nazi district, established Hesselberg as a meeting place of the Nazis. After the NSDAP came to power in 1933 the annual Frankish Days (held until 1939) developed from party manifestations. Those were the largest manifestations in Franconia besides the Nuremberg rally. Hermann Göring attended the Frankish Days twice as a speaker and Adolf Hitler also once attended. Up to 100,000 visitors on the Osterwiese listened to the virulently anti-Semitic speeches of Julius Streicher. At that time Hesselberg was named Heiliger Berg der Franken (Holy Mountain of the Franks). No remains of <b>this</b> <b>dark</b> time are left on Hesselberg. The lofty Nazi plans were never put into practice—the construction of the Adolf-Hitler-School was not realised, nor the Julius-Streicher-Mausoleum. Prior to World War II the Nazis could only finish an administration building with a garage. Later this garage was used as a chapel by the refugees that were placed on Hesselberg.|$|E

5|$|Callisto's leading {{hemisphere}} is less reflective {{than its}} trailing hemisphere, which could indicate {{that one of}} its sides has a higher surface temperature. On <b>this</b> <b>darker,</b> warmer side, sublimation rates of its icy surface would also be higher, causing more water vapor to be released into the atmosphere. This process would ultimately produce more hydrogen, which might explain the aforementioned variance in Callisto's atmospheric hydrogen levels.|$|R
