5|$|The reason I haven't spoken <b>to</b> <b>you</b> <b>before</b> now is this: You {{deserve the}} truth.

2500|$|An Ifrit is {{mentioned}} in the Qur'an, Sura An-Naml (27:38-40): [...] said, [...] "O assembly , which of you will bring me her [...] throne before they come to me in submission?" [...] An ifrit (strong one) from the jinn said: [...] "I will bring it <b>to</b> <b>you</b> <b>before</b> you rise from your place. And verily, I am indeed strong, and trustworthy for such work." [...] One with whom was knowledge of the Scripture said: [...] "I will {{bring it to you}} within the twinkling of an eye!" [...] Then when Solomon saw it placed before him, he said: [...] "This is by the Grace of my Lord - to test me whether I am grateful or ungrateful!

2500|$|Theodore of Mopsuestia paraphrases: [...] "In {{addition}} to all which I have said, I give you this last commandment, to remember My law, which I gave to all Israel through Moses, plainly declaring {{what they ought to}} do in each thing, and as the first token of obedience, to receive the Lord Christ when He cometh, appearing for the salvation of all men: Who will end the law, but show His own perfection. It had been well, had you immediately believed Him when He came, and known Him, as He whom Moses and all the prophets signified, Who should {{put an end to the}} law, and reveal the common salvation of all men, so that it should be manifest to all, that this is the sum and chief good of the whole dispensation of the law, to bring all men to the Lord Christ, Who, for those great goods, should be manifested in His own time. But since, when He manifested Himself, ye manifested your own ungainliness, the blessed Elias shall be sent <b>to</b> <b>you</b> <b>before</b> the second Coming of Christ, when He will come from heaven, to unite those who, for religion, are separated from each other, and, through the knowledge of religion, to bring the fathers to one-mindedness with the children, and in a word, to bring all men to one and the same harmony, when those, then found in ungodliness, shall receive from him the knowledge of the truth in the communion with the godly thence ensuing." ...|$|E
