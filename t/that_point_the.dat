At <b>that</b> <b>point</b> <b>the</b> Embraer was just approaching the Brasilia VOR. The Embraer overflew the Brasilia VOR at 15:55, four minutes later, and proceeded northwest-bound along UZ6. At 16:02, seven minutes after crossing the Brasilia VOR, secondary radar contact was lost with the Embraer, thus stopping the display of the Embraer's reported altitude (Mode C) on the controller's radar screen.|$|E

5|$|Compartment {{syndrome}} is treated with surgery {{to relieve the}} pressure inside the muscle compartment and {{reduce the risk of}} compression on blood vessels and nerves in that area. Fasciotomy is the incision of the affected compartment. Often, multiple incisions are made and left open until the swelling has reduced. At <b>that</b> <b>point,</b> <b>the</b> incisions are closed, often requiring debridement (removal of non-viable tissue) and skin grafting in the process. The need for fasciotomy may be decreased if mannitol is used, as it can relieve muscle swelling directly.|$|E
