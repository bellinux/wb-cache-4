5|$|Except {{those with}} an {{advertising}} livery, the trams are painted a light blue. The first series was delivered with a deeper blue color <b>than</b> <b>has</b> been tradition with Oslo Sporveier trams, but all have since been repainted to match the standard livery. Prior to the delivery of the second series, a single tram was painted deep red to match the buses and the T1000 trains used on the Oslo Metro. Due to negative feedback from the riders, the historic color was kept.|$|E
5|$|Johan Huizinga (1872–1945) {{acknowledged}} {{the existence of}} the Renaissance but questioned whether it was a positive change. In his book The Waning of the Middle Ages, he argued that the Renaissance was a period of decline from the High Middle Ages, destroying much that was important. The Latin language, for instance, had evolved greatly from the classical period and was still a living language used in the church and elsewhere. The Renaissance obsession with classical purity halted its further evolution and saw Latin revert to its classical form. Robert S. Lopez has contended that it was a period of deep economic recession. Meanwhile, George Sarton and Lynn Thorndike have both argued that scientific progress was perhaps less original <b>than</b> <b>has</b> traditionally been supposed. Finally, Joan Kelly argued that the Renaissance led to greater gender dichotomy, lessening the agency women had had during the Middle Ages.|$|E
5|$|The coins {{struck by}} Beonna's last known moneyer, Wilred, are so {{different}} from Efe's that {{it is highly unlikely}} that they were produced at the same mint or at the same time. It can also be assumed that Wilred is the same moneyer who struck coins for Offa of Mercia, possibly at Ipswich. Wilred's coins can be used to demonstrate that Offa's influence over the East Angles occurred at an earlier date <b>than</b> <b>has</b> previously been supposed, but are of little use in determining a secure chronology for Beonna's reign. Wilred's name is always depicted in runes. Nearly all his reverse dies have two crosses placed between the elements of his name (+ wil + red): most of the obverse dies show crosses and the king's name in a similar design, but also include an extra rune. This unique rune, similar to ᚹ, possibly meant walda ('ruler').|$|E

5|$|Western jackdaws {{practice}} active food sharing– {{where the}} initiative {{for the transfer}} lies with the donor– {{with a number of}} individuals, regardless of sex or kinship. They also share more of a preferred food than a less preferred food. The active giving of food by most birds is found mainly in the context of parental care and courtship. Western jackdaws show much higher levels of active giving <b>than</b> <b>has</b> been documented for other species, including chimpanzees. The function of this behaviour is not fully understood, though it {{has been found to be}} detached from nutrition and compatible with hypotheses of mutualism, reciprocity and harassment avoidance. It has also been proposed that food sharing may be motivated by prestige enhancement.|$|E
5|$|Across {{northern}} Australia, Banksia dentata {{has been}} recorded as far west as the King Leopold Ranges in the western Kimberley through the Northern Territory and extending south to Katherine Gorge and into Queensland, where it is found on the Cape York Peninsula to {{as far south as}} Cooktown. Off the coast, it {{has been recorded}} from Groote Eylandt and the Wessel Islands, as well as Melville and Bathurst Islands. It also extends onto the Aru Islands, where it is found around Trangan, and New Guinea, where it ranges in the south from Merauke east to Port Moresby, and around Bulolo and Mount Mau. It is the only Banksia species not endemic to Australia. As much of its range is in remote and poorly surveyed country, it is possible that it is found more widely <b>than</b> <b>has</b> been recorded. Pollen samples indicate it has been present on the Torres Strait Islands over the past 8000 years, though it has not been a prominent component of the island flora.|$|E
5|$|Like other requiem sharks, {{the milk}} shark is viviparous; females {{usually have a}} single {{functional}} ovary (on the left) and two functional uteruses divided into separate compartments for each embryo. The details of its life history vary across different parts of its range. Females generally produce young every year, though some give birth every other year or even every third year. Mating and parturition take place in spring or early summer (April to July) off western and southern Africa, and in winter off India, Alternately, off Oman parturition occurs year-round with a peak in spring. Parturition also occurs continuously in Australian waters; in the Herald Bight of Shark Bay, the number of newborns peaks in April and again in July. One proposed explanation {{for the lack of}} reproductive seasonality in these subpopulations is a lengthier and/or more complex reproductive cycle <b>than</b> <b>has</b> been detected (such as a period of dormancy in embryonic development, though there is presently no evidence of this occurring). Females do not store sperm internally.|$|E
