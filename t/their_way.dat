5|$|Adult female rabbit fleas, Spilopsyllus cuniculi, {{can detect}} the {{changing}} levels of cortisol and corticosterone hormones in the rabbit's blood that indicate {{it is getting}} close to giving birth. This triggers sexual maturity in the fleas and they start producing eggs. As soon as the baby rabbits are born, the fleas make <b>their</b> <b>way</b> down to them and once on board they start feeding, mating, and laying eggs. After 12 days, the adult fleas make <b>their</b> <b>way</b> back to the mother. They complete this mini-migration every time she gives birth.|$|E

50|$|Flor and Ongkiko (1998), {{in their}} book- Introduction to Development Communication, state that {{development}} communication is purposive as it primarily uses communication {{not merely to}} give information but practically to influence the people- the receivers of information. Coyle (2008), in his article- Theory of Development Communication, articulates that where people have options to change <b>their</b> <b>ways</b> of life, communication becomes important in informing, persuading, listening, data gathering, educating, training and managing change. Communication then becomes an instrument in facilitating changes in people {{in order for them}} to realize their full potentials. Through it, people would improve <b>their</b> <b>ways</b> of thinking, <b>their</b> <b>ways</b> of acting and <b>their</b> <b>ways</b> of living resulting in a higher quality of life.
