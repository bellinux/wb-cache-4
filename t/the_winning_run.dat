5|$|The {{image of}} Griffey {{at the bottom}} of the dogpile after scoring <b>the</b> <b>winning</b> <b>run</b> is one of the most memorable images of Griffey's storied career with the Mariners. In 2007, when Griffey {{returned}} to Seattle for the first time since his 1999 trade to the Cincinnati Reds, that image was included in a photo collage of highlights of Griffey's Mariners career that was presented to him by former teammates Martinez and Jay Buhner (both retired by then).|$|E

Distracted by Mr. Burns, the first pitch hits Homer in the head, rendering him unconscious, but forcing in <b>the</b> <b>winning</b> <b>run.</b> The team wins the title and Homer, still unconscious, is paraded as a hero.|$|E
5|$|A Super Over eventuated, and Laura Marsh bowled for England. Healy {{came in at}} 1/3 after Leah Poulton fell on {{the fourth}} ball. She hit a two from the fifth ball, and was run out by Jenny Gunn while {{attempting}} to complete a second run on the sixth and final ball of Australia's Super Over, leaving them at 2/6. England also ended with 2/6 after a run out {{in an attempt to}} secure <b>the</b> <b>winning</b> <b>run</b> on the final ball. Australia was awarded the match because they had hit more sixes in the matchJess Cameron scored the solitary six.|$|E
5|$|A Super Over eventuated, and Marsh bowled for England. Farrell and Poulton batted for Australia.

5|$|As a manager, Virdon led the Pirates to the 1972 NL East {{division}} title, but the Pirates {{lost the}} 1972 National League Championship Series (NLCS) to the Cincinnati Reds when Pittsburgh pitcher Bob Moose unleashed a wild {{pitch in the}} final inning of Game 5, allowing <b>the</b> <b>winning</b> <b>run</b> to score. The 1973 Pirates had to play without Clemente, who died during the previous offseason. Further struggles included pitcher Steve Blass' inability to throw strikes and injuries to Dock Ellis. In 1973, Virdon clashed with Ellis and Richie Hebner, and the Pirates fell into third place, with a 67–69 record, and the team fired Virdon, replacing him with Murtaugh.|$|E
5|$|Australia {{were grouped}} with England, South Africa and the West Indies. In the first match against England, Poulton ran out Laura Marsh, {{triggering}} {{the loss of}} the last four wickets without the addition of a run, in six balls, leaving 15 deliveries unused. In pursuit of 105 for victory, Poulton top-scored for Australia with 23 from 28 balls, helping to stabilise the innings after the Australians had fallen to 2/10. However, she fell at 4/45, bowled by Holly Colvin, and eventually, Rene Farrell was run out going for <b>the</b> <b>winning</b> <b>run</b> from the third last ball available, leaving the scores tied.|$|E
5|$|In Game 2 of the NLDS against Atlanta on October 8, Burrell hit {{a three-run}} {{home run in}} a 54 loss. On October 16, in Game 1 of the NLCS against the Phillies, he had an RBI double against Roy Halladay. Nate Schierholtz then pinch-ran for him, scoring <b>the</b> <b>winning</b> <b>run</b> in the Giants' 43 victory. In the World Series, Burrell struck out eleven times in {{thirteen}} at-bats, had no hits, and was benched for Game 4. However, the Giants won the World Series in five games, and Burrell received his second championship ring.|$|E

5|$|Australia {{were grouped}} with England, South Africa and the West Indies. In the first match against England, Healy took one catch to dismiss Danielle Hazell from the bowling of Sthalekar. In pursuit of 105 for victory, Australia were {{struggling}} when Healy {{came to the}} crease with the score at 7/63 after 14.2 overs. Three wickets had fallen {{in the space of}} 16 balls, during which only three runs had been added, and England had the momentum, and 42 runs were needed from 34 balls for victory. Healy then struck three fours, making 15 from 9 balls before being dismissed by Nicki Shaw, ending a stand of 23 from 13 balls with Sthalekar. However, Rene Farrell was run out going for <b>the</b> <b>winning</b> <b>run</b> from the third last ball available, leaving the scores tied.|$|E
5|$|Christopher {{gained the}} weight back and rejoined the Athletics for the 1947 season. While {{there was talk}} of keeping him in the rotation, he ended up {{becoming}} a full-time reliever for the team. Despite this, Christopher was still able to contribute with his bat; he drove in <b>the</b> <b>winning</b> <b>run</b> in a May 29 game against the Red Sox. Over the course of the season, Christopher evolved into the Athletics' closer, finishing the games when the team's pitchers could not go the distance. He finished the season having played 44 games, finishing 38 of them and getting 12 saves in the process. He also had 10 wins, seven losses, and a 2.90 ERA. At the end of the season, Christopher was holding out on his contract, wanting either a starting role in the rotation or more money to remain a reliever. The two sides agreed to a deal at the end of February, and he looked to be a starting pitcher during the 1948 season.|$|E
5|$|In {{the bottom}} half of the inning, Yankees ace Jack McDowell, who had entered the game in the 9th inning for a rare relief appearance, faced Joey Cora, Ken Griffey, Jr., and Edgar Martínez—the second, third, and fourth batters in the Mariners' order, respectively. Second baseman Cora dragged a bunt down the first base line and reached first base safely on an infield hit. Yankees manager Buck Showalter argued the call, believing Cora should have been called out for running off the baselines; however, the umpires' ruling stood. Center fielder Griffey singled to short right-center field, {{allowing}} Cora to reach third base. Designated hitter Martinez then doubled down the left field line, scoring Cora with the tying run and Griffey with <b>the</b> <b>winning</b> <b>run.</b> The Mariners' dugout emptied and mobbed Griffey, Martinez, and Cora on the field in celebration of the franchise's first ever playoff series victory.|$|E
50|$|Needing only 19 {{runs for}} victory, Australia made the runs inside three overs {{for the loss}} of one wicket. Debutant David Warner scored <b>the</b> <b>winning</b> <b>runs.</b>|$|R
25|$|In the One Day Internationals Matthews batted {{at number}} eight and hit <b>the</b> <b>winning</b> <b>runs</b> at Old Trafford (22 not out) and Lord's (29 not out) as Australia <b>won</b> <b>the</b> Texaco Trophy 2-1.|$|R
25|$|Hussain {{continued}} as a batsman in the Test team until May 2004; {{in his final}} Test, against New Zealand at Lord's, Hussain scored 34 and 103 not out, hitting <b>the</b> <b>winning</b> <b>runs.</b>|$|R
5|$|Upon Bradman's dismissal, {{dark clouds}} began {{to close in}} on the ground, and rain {{appeared}} to be a possible saviour for England. However, it never came, and meanwhile Hassett joined Barnes. The pair attacked, Hassett twice driving Bedser over the infield for boundaries, and later pulling another ball in the air for another four. Barnes gave Young an opportunity for a return catch, but the ball was dropped. The pair reached the target without further loss after 87 minutes of batting. Barnes ended on 64 with 11 boundaries, having been prolific on the square cut. He tied the scores with a swept boundary, and having taken a stump as souvenir, ran off the ground believing the match was over. Barnes tossed his souvenir back into the playing arena and returned to the field after noticing the reaction of the amused crowd and Hassett promptly hit <b>the</b> <b>winning</b> <b>run.</b>|$|E
5|$|Born in Houston, Bates {{attended}} the University of Texas and, in his freshman season, won the 1983 College World Series {{as a part}} of the Texas Longhorns baseball team. For the next two seasons, Bates was named to the College Baseball All-America Team, a team composed of the best collegiate baseball athletes in America. Drafted by Milwaukee in the 4th round of the 1985 MLB draft, he rose through the Brewers' farm system and teams that he played for won multiple minor league titles. He subsequently made his MLB debut in 1989, after Milwaukee starting second baseman became injured. A trade sent Bates to Cincinnati in 1990, where the Reds used him as a pinch runner at the end of the regular season and into the postseason. Facing the Oakland Athletics in the World Series, Bates reached base on a pinch hit single against Dennis Eckersley and later scored <b>the</b> <b>winning</b> <b>run</b> in Game 2, as the Reds ultimately swept the Athletics, four games to none. Following the World Series championship, Bates spent two years in minor league baseball, one for the Reds and one for the Chicago Cubs, and last played exhibition baseball in 1995. After retirement, he worked as an equipment supplier in the oil and gas industry in Houston and coached his daughter's softball team.|$|E
5|$|During England’s second innings, Joe Hardstaff, Jr. {{fell for}} 43, lofting Ernie Toshack to Hassett {{on the leg}} side to end a {{partnership}} of 93 with Denis Compton. The ball looped {{up in the air}} and travelled half-way to the square leg boundary, but Hassett managed to keep track of its trajectory through the fog. Australia eventually finished off the hosts for 441, leaving them a target of 98 on the final afternoon. Australia proceeded steadily to 38 from 32 minutes before Morris fell. Bradman came in and was out for a duck. This left Australia at 2/48, at which point dark clouds began to close in on the ground, and it appeared that rain might save England. However, it never came, and meanwhile Hassett joined Barnes. The pair attacked, Hassett twice driving Bedser over the infield for boundaries, and later pulling another ball in the air for another four. The tourists reached the target without further loss after 87 minutes of batting. Barnes tied the scores with a swept boundary, but ran off the field with a souvenir stump, believing that the match was over. He returned to the field when he noticed the crowd reaction; Hassett hit <b>the</b> <b>winning</b> <b>run</b> to end with an unbeaten 21.|$|E
50|$|Most recently, {{he participated}} in the Twenty20 Cup matches of 2003 and 2004, {{finishing}} his career by hitting <b>the</b> <b>winning</b> <b>runs</b> in <b>the</b> crucial game of Glamorgan's 2004 totesport League championship victory.|$|R
25|$|O'Donnell {{kept his}} place in the side for the second test. He proved his {{usefulness}} with the bat, helping Australia navigate a tricky second innings run chase and hitting <b>the</b> <b>winning</b> <b>runs</b> with a six.|$|R
50|$|In the {{semifinal}} {{game against}} Team Japan, Lee hit a dramatic go-ahead two-run {{home run in}} the bottom of the eighth inning off reliever Hitoki Iwase, which proved to be <b>the</b> <b>winning</b> <b>runs</b> in Korea's 6-2 win.|$|R
5|$|Entering the 1945 Cleveland Indians season, Gromek {{was named}} one of the Indians' main {{starting}} pitchers, and would hold that title throughout the season. On June 8, Gromek defeated the Browns, 2–1, to improve to 7–1 with a 1.62 ERA. On July 4, the Indians accomplished one of the more bizarre firsts in baseball history with Gromek on the mound. In a complete game victory over the Yankees, Gromek struck out four. Fifteen outs came via fly balls to the outfield; another four pop-ups were handled by the infielders. Catcher Frankie Hayes caught two foul balls, and the only ground ball outs recorded were handled by first baseman Mickey Rocco unassisted. It was the only time in major league history that a team went nine innings without recording a putout. A week later, Gromek was named to the All-Star team for the 1945 All-Star Game, which was cancelled due to travel restrictions in place during World War II. In late August, Gromek won his 16th game in a 5–4 victory against the Detroit Tigers, but injured his knee when scoring <b>the</b> <b>winning</b> <b>run,</b> causing him to miss two weeks. For the year, Gromek went 19–9, with a career best 2.55 ERA; he ranked fourth in wins and seventh in ERA in the American League that season.|$|E
5|$|For the season, Killebrew set career highs in RBIs, runs, {{walks and}} on-base percentage, tied his career high with 49 home runs, and even {{registered}} eight of his 19 career stolen bases, {{en route to}} winning his only Most Valuable Player Award. He led the AL in home runs, RBIs, on-base percentage, walks, and intentional walks and knocked in <b>the</b> <b>winning</b> <b>run</b> 20 times while playing in all 162 games. As of 2011, Killebrew's home run, RBI, and walk totals from 1969 remain team records, and his 145 walks are tied for the 20th highest single season total in MLB history and 7th highest for a right-handed batter. In the 1969 American League Championship Series, the Baltimore Orioles used their pitching staff, {{the best in the}} league, to defeat Minnesota and win the series three games to none. Baltimore avoided Killebrew by walking him six times in the three games to avoid pitching to him, which was as many times as they walked the rest of the Twins team.|$|E
5|$|Gilchrist {{played in}} every match of Australia's {{successful}} World Cup campaign, but struggled at first, {{with scores of}} 6, 14 and 0 {{in the first three}} matches against Scotland, New Zealand and Pakistan. Australia lost the latter two matches and had to avoid defeat for six consecutive matches to reach the final. Gilchrist's quick-fire 63 runs in 39 balls against Bangladesh helped the Australians into the Super Six stage of the tournament, which was secured with a win over the West Indies, although Gilchrist made only 21. Gilchrist continued to struggle in the Super Six phase, scoring 31, 10 and 5 against India, Zimbabwe and South Africa. Australia won all three matches, the last in the final over, to scrape into the semifinals. Gilchrist made only 20 in the semifinal against South Africa, but completed the final act of the match. With the scores tied, South Africa were going for <b>the</b> <b>winning</b> <b>run</b> when Gilchrist broke the stumps to complete the run out of Allan Donald; the match was tied, and Australia proceeded to the final as they had won the group stage match against South Africa. Gilchrist's 54 in the final helped secure Australia's first world title since 1987 with an eight wicket victory over Pakistan. It was a happy ending for Gilchrist, who had struggled through the tournament, with 237 runs at 21.54.|$|E
2500|$|He {{continued}} to play in Ranji Trophy until he took Pakistan citizenship in 1955. [...] He played one Test for Pakistan, against Australia in 1956/57 where he scored 12 and 27 not out and hit <b>the</b> <b>winning</b> <b>runs.</b>|$|R
