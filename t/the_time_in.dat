5|$|A {{technical}} foul {{requires that the}} defenceman who fouled a player on the opposing team {{be placed in the}} penalty box for 30 seconds. As with a personal foul, until the penalty time expires, no replacement for the player is allowed and the team must play one man short. The player (or a replacement) is allowed to reenter the game once <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>in</b> the penalty box is over and the team is thus once again at full strength.|$|E
5|$|According to Sorkin, {{the episode}} benefited greatly from input by two former White House employees.

5|$|Actress Jennifer Ehle {{was chosen}} out {{of half a}} dozen serious {{candidates}} to play Elizabeth, the second Bennet daughter, the brightest girl, and her father's favourite. At <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>in</b> her mid-20s, Ehle had first read Pride and Prejudice at the age of 12 and was the only actor to be present throughout the whole filming schedule. Sue Birtwistle particularly wanted Colin Firth, a relatively unknown British actor in his mid-30s at the time, to play the wealthy and aloof Mr. Darcy. Birtwistle had worked with him on the mid-1980s comedy film Dutch Girls, but he repeatedly turned down her offer as he neither felt attracted to Austen's feminine perspective nor believed himself to be right for the role. Birtwistle's persistent coaxing and his deeper looks into the Darcy character finally convinced him to accept the role. Firth and Ehle began a romantic relationship during the filming of the series, which only received media attention after the couple's separation.|$|E
5|$|After being omitted in {{the opening}} tour match against Worcestershire, Davidson made his debut on English soil against Leicestershire. He scored 63, {{featuring}} in a century partnership with Harvey, before taking 2/23 and 0/35 in an innings victory. In the next match against Yorkshire, he removed Len Hutton, regarded as the best batsman {{in the world at}} <b>the</b> <b>time.</b> <b>In</b> the nine first-class matches leading up to the Tests, Davidson performed steadily without being spectacular. He scored two fifties and passed 20 in every completed innings to aggregate 317 runs at 45.28, and took 17 wickets at 22.12, taking more than two wickets in an innings on only one occasion. That occasion was against the Marylebone Cricket Club, which was a virtual England Test team, while Australia fielded their strongest possible team. In what was effectively a dress rehearsal for the Tests, Davidson took 2/17 and 3/49, removing Trevor Bailey, Godfrey Evans, Johnny Wardle, Tom Graveney and leading batsman Denis Compton.|$|E
5|$|After being {{vacated by}} the Keys, the {{building}} was purchased by 's Bank. Not long after acquiring the building, the bank removed the ceiling from the chamber, and added a large skylight to create a grand banking hall. The building was repainted in an expensive shade of blue which was fashionable at <b>the</b> <b>time.</b> <b>In</b> 1900, when 's Bank collapsed, {{the building was}} taken over by Parr's Bank. The render was stripped off the outside of the building sometime during the 1910s or 1920s, revealing the limestone underneath. In 1918, the bank became part of Westminster Bank. In the 1960s, the upper floor of the chamber was replaced. The building was presented to the Castletown Commissioners in 1973 by the National Westminster Bank on the condition that it serve the town. It was used as the Town Hall until the opening of the Town Hall and Civic Centre in 1989, and then as the Castletown Rural Library.|$|E

5|$|After graduation, Kerst {{worked at}} General Electric Company for a year, {{working on the}} {{development}} of x-ray tubes and machines.

Wheeler Loomis encouraged Kerst in his efforts to create a better particle accelerator. The result of these efforts was the betatron. When it became operational on July 15, 1940, Kerst became the first person to accelerate electrons using electromagnetic induction, reaching energies of 2.3 MeV.|$|E
5|$|After his {{graduation}} Hayden {{moved to}} Detroit {{to work for}} Dodge but returned to Kentucky after the first summer because of homesickness. During the 1922-23 basketball season he coached at Kentucky Wesleyan College which was in Winchester at <b>the</b> <b>time.</b> <b>In</b> his one season at Kentucky Wesleyan he went 8-1. He then taught and coached at George Rogers Clark High School while taking {{a job in the}} insurance business in Richmond, Kentucky. In 1926 he was called to replace Ray Eklund as the head basketball coach at the University of Kentucky but was given only one week to prepare for the task with a team made up of unskilled members. The squad consisted primarily of football players, many of whom lacked the incentive to fully participate. The team finished with a 3–13 record, winning once against the University of Florida and twice against Centre College. When Harry Gamage was named the new head coach of the university's football squad, he had Hayden replaced with John Mauer. The team would not have another losing season until 1988–89 under Eddie Sutton.|$|E

5|$|Alboin's {{decision}} {{to create a}} duchy and designate a duke were both important innovations; until then, the Lombards had never had dukes or duchies based on a walled town. The innovation adopted was part of Alboin's borrowing of Roman and Ostrogothic administrative models, as in Late Antiquity the comes civitatis (city count) was the main local authority, with full administrative powers in his region. But the shift from count (comes) to duke (dux) and from county (comitatus) to duchy (ducatus) also signalled the progressive militarization of Italy. The selection of a fortified town as the centre for the new duchy was also an important change from <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>in</b> Pannonia, for while urbanized settlements had previously been ignored by the Lombards, now a considerable part of the nobility settled itself in Forum Iulii, a pattern that was repeated regularly by the Lombards in their other duchies.|$|E
5|$|Although it {{was common}} to bury dogs in ancient Egypt, the funeral of Abuwtiyuw was unusually elaborate, an honour {{normally}} reserved for upper-class humans.

5|$|Arizona sailed from New York for Hampton Roads, {{where she}} arrived on 22 January, and she {{continued}} south to Guantanamo Bay not long after, arriving on 8 February. <b>The</b> <b>time</b> <b>in</b> Caribbean waters was mostly used in training for battles and fleet maneuvering, although it included a liberty visit to Port of Spain. In April, Arizonas crew won the Battenberg Cup rowing {{competition for the}} second straight year before the ship was deployed to France once again to escort President Wilson back to the United States. While the ship was awaiting Wilson's departure, she was redeployed to Smyrna (now Izmir) in Turkey in response to tensions between Greece and Italy over the awarding of Smyrna to Greece in the Paris Peace Treaty. The Greek and Italian governments had each deployed a major warship to the area (Georgios Averof and Caio Duilio, respectively) to enforce their interests. Shortly after Arizona arrived, Greek ground forces arrived in transports and were off-loaded in the port. The resultant chaos in the city caused many American citizens in the area to seek shelter on board Arizona.|$|E
