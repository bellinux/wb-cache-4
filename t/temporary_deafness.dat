25|$|Hearing {{begins in}} utero, but the central {{auditory}} system continues to develop {{for at least}} the first decade. There is considerable interest in the idea that disruption to hearing during a sensitive period may have long-term consequences for auditory development. One study showed thalamocortical connectivity in vitro was associated with a time sensitive developmental window and required a specific cell adhesion molecule (lcam5) for proper brain plasticity to occur. This points to connectivity between the thalamus and cortex shortly after being able to hear (in vitro) as at least one critical period for auditory processing. Another study showed that rats reared in a single tone environment during critical periods of development had permanently impaired auditory processing. ‘Bad’ auditory experiences, such as <b>temporary</b> <b>deafness</b> by cochlear removal in rats leads to neuron shrinkage. In a study looking at attention in APD patients, children with one ear blocked developed a strong right-ear advantage but were not able to modulate that advantage during directed-attention tasks.|$|E

40|$|Auditory fatigue is {{now known}} as Temporary Threshold Shift (subsequently {{abbreviated}} to TTS). It has been defined as the temporary elevation in the absolute threshold of hearing for a given test sound resulting from preceding auditory stimulation by a given stimulus sound (see Hirsh, 1952, page 177). Associated with the phenomenon there are six physical variables which sub-divide themselves into stimulus, test and recovery factors. In IMS study each of the latter factors was systematically Investigated using four groups of six undergraduate subjects. Thresholds were measured using the Bek 6 sy (1947) technique of threshold measurement. Control experiments were carried out to verify that TTS results from the application of the stimulus tone, to study the mechanisms involved in the Bekesy technique of threshold measurement and the effects of this technique on the measurement of TTS, to investigate any additive effects of TTS and to study the possibility of any measurement errors resulting from the physical test environment. The results of the experiments showed that the stimulus test and recovery factors all produced a consistent duality of results. It was concluded that the unitary definition of TTS is inadequate and that there are two TTS mechanisms. These are referred to as fatigue and temporal stimulation deafness. Fatigue is associated with moderately intense stimulus tones of fairly short duration. It increases linearly with logarithm of the stimulus duration; it is maximal at stimulus frequencies of 1000, 2000 and 3000 cps; it does not vary significantly with stimulus intensities of up to 90 db. but thence increases rapidly to a maximum; it is maximal at a test frequency equal to the stimulus frequency and recovery from it is complete within one minute of the cessation of the stimulus. <b>Temporary</b> stimulation <b>deafness</b> is associated with high intensity stimulus tones of fairly long duration. It increases linearly with the logarithm of the stimulus duration; it is maximal with stimulus frequencies of 4000 to 6000 cps; it increases rapidly as the stimulus intensity is increased; it is maximal at a test frequency an octave above the stimulus frequency and recovery from it takes longer than one minute from the cessation of the stimulus tone. It is hypothesized that fatigue is a neural, possibly bio-chemical, adaptation effect and that <b>temporary</b> stimulation <b>deafness</b> results from structural damage to the organ of Corti. Other work supports this differentiation. The phenomena of fatigue support either a "place" or a "volley" theory of hearing.

50|$|The {{usage of}} {{wormseed}} oil on humans {{is limited by}} the toxicity of ascaridole and has therefore been discouraged. In high doses, wormseed oil causes irritation of skin and mucous membranes, nausea, vomiting, constipation, headache, vertigo, tinnitus, <b>temporary</b> <b>deafness</b> and blindness. Prolonged action induces depression of the central nervous system and delirium which transits into convulsions and coma. Long-term effects include pulmonary edema (fluid accumulation in the lungs), hematuria, and albuminuria (presence of red blood cells and proteins in the urine, respectively) and jaundice (yellowish pigmentation of the skin). Fatal doses of wormseed oil were reported as one teaspoon for a 14-month-old baby (at once) and daily administration of 1 mL over three weeks to a 2-year-old child. Ascaridole is also carcinogenic in rats.|$|E

5000|$|In one study, {{participants}} {{listened to}} short narratives {{in which a}} man and woman converse about an inanimate object that is semantically related to the man (e.g., [...] "tourist" [...] and [...] "suitcase"). In the fifth sentence of the narrative, either the woman would continue her conversation with the man (coherent continuation), or she would suddenly start talking to the inanimate object instead (anomalous continuation); except for the critical words, these continuations were identical in coherent and anomalous continuations. In both cases the critical words of the continuation were de-accented, in order to minimize prosodic differences across both versions of the story. It was predicted that listeners would immediately notice the semantic change in the anomalous continuation condition, despite conditions that have been demonstrated to elicit semantic illusions, since it produces a strong discourse coherence break. This was tested using ERP analysis, with the expectation that the anomalous continuation would immediately elicit a large N400 effect relative to the coherent continuation, given that semantically anomalous, or even coherent but unexpected words, have been shown to elicit significantly larger N400 effects than semantically coherent or expected words about 150-250 ms after the onset of the critical word. Contrary to this prediction, results yielded the absence of an N400 effect and the presence of a differential effect that began to emerge at approximately 500-600 ms after critical word onset. The absence of an N400 effect is interpreted as a <b>temporary</b> change <b>deafness</b> effect in which the semantic change momentarily went undetected, because of the well-established sensitivity of the N400 to very subtle differences in the relatedness of a word to its semantic context. The experimenters speculate that the initial lack of change detection is a product of strong expectations combined with input that is superficially consistent with the context, in that the anomalous word is semantically associated with the correct word and not accented in any unusual way. Crucially, the differential ERP shows that the participants did process the change, but it took significantly longer to detect than expected.|$|R
50|$|Typical {{effects of}} {{non-lethal}} weaponry include stamina depletion, target immobilization and information manipulation. Support items {{are the most}} diverse in realizing these goals. Stun grenades, for instance, deplete the stamina of nearby opponents, but also cause <b>temporary</b> blindness and <b>deafness</b> to targets up to medium distance. Other examples include proximity and trigger activated sleepgas mines, e-locators that disclose the position of close-by targets, chaff grenades to both limit visibility and temporarily obscure the SOP radar, and magazines that occupy a target, rendering them immobile. Non lethal fire-arms consist of the Mosin-Nagant sniper rifle, the Ruger Mk. 2 tranquilizer pistol, the VSS sniper rifle equipped with anesthetic rounds, and any shotgun equipped with Vortex Ring ammo. Headshots from the Mosin-Nagant, VSS, and Ruger Mk. 2 tranquilize instantly, irrespective of target distance.Stunned characters can be body searched for their primary weapon and support items, killed by the enemy to grant even more Drebin Points, or woken up to return to battle. Stunning offers many advantages to simply killing the enemy. A stunned enemy will typically take significantly longer to awake then he would to respawn after being killed, {{and he does not}} gain the advantage of having his health and ammo supply regenerated as would happen upon respawning. In addition, his teammates will often divert manpower to attempt to rescue the knocked out player, giving the other team an advantage.|$|R

5000|$|Stitch's {{greatest}} {{weakness is}} {{his inability to}} float or swim due to his dense molecular structure, which causes him to sink in water. Another weakness {{is the fact that}} his super-sensitive hearing can lead to <b>temporary</b> <b>deafness</b> when exposed to sonic blasts. Stitch originally had an instinctive aquaphobia, but was able to overcome it because of Lilo. In episode 6 of Lilo & Stitch: The Series, Experiment 300 ("Spooky") was activated. It has the ability to transform into people's worst fear; for Stitch it transformed into water, until Lilo showed Stitch her coping mechanism for when she gets scared (for her it's singing the chorus of [...] "Aloha ʻOe"), which is how Stitch was able to save her later in the episode. Another of Stitch's weaknesses, as mentioned earlier, is that he cannot lift things over 3,000 times his size and weight. Also as mentioned earlier, since Stitch's molecules were not fully charged upon creation as shown in Lilo & Stitch 2: Stitch Has a Glitch, if his initial charging was not finished he would later suffer seizure-like glitches that would revert him to his original destructive programming before dying. This issue was resolved by the film's end, and he no longer suffers these glitches.|$|E
6000|$|This visit only {{preceded by}} a few weeks the death of Mrs. Carey, after {{thirteen}} years' marriage, the happiest of Dr. Carey's life; but in another year he married a widow of forty-five, who was ready to nurse his now declining years. That year 1822 was a year of much sorrow; the cholera, said to have first appeared in 1817, became very virulent. The Hindoos viewed it as a visitation from the goddess of destruction, and held services to propitiate it, and when that had passed away, a more than usually fatal form of fever set in. Krishnu-pal, the first convert, who had for twenty years been a consistent Christian, {{was one of the}} first to be taken away.

5000|$|Rudish's {{next project}} saw him work with {{characters}} not created by him or frequent collaborator Tartakovsky: Mickey Mouse and friends. Rudish created, executive produced and directed {{a series of}} 19 three-and-a-half minute shorts titled simply Mickey Mouse. The series uses the character designs and personalities from the earliest Mickey, Donald, and Goofy shorts, even using lesser known characters such as Clarabelle. Many of the shorts use a classic story structure in which Mickey must overcome a series of obstacles to achieve a seemingly simple goal, though some highlight the more playful aspects of animation, such as Mickey's cartoony evasive moves in [...] "No Service" [...] or the ability of characters to detach and reattach their ears (complete with <b>temporary</b> <b>deafness)</b> in [...] "Bad Ear Day". Despite the retro feel, the developers used modern animation techniques and tools. Further, they did update some elements, most notably the vivid, detailed backgrounds and super-smooth animation in fast-paced scenes. They also took stylistic risks, basing some episodes entirely in foreign countries. In most of these, the characters speak sparingly, if at all, while in [...] "Croissant de Triomphe", set in Paris, the characters speak entirely in French. The first short was released on June 28, 2013, on Disney Channel, Disney.com and WATCH Disney Channel.|$|E

40|$|Graduation date: 2017 Access {{restricted}} to the OSU Community, at author's request, from February 15, 2017 - February 15, 2019 Hearing loss {{is one of the}} most common defect, affecting 360 million people worldwide due to several factors including congenital, present at or soon after birth or acquired with age. Congenital hearing loss affects 32 million children in the world. The economic impact of hearing loss is estimated to cost society an average of 300, 000 dollars over the lifetime of a person. It also has serious impacts on quality of life including the literacy rate in children. Although, hearing loss is clearly a major health problem its genetic basis for the pathology is poorly understood. To date, over 60 pathogenic mutations in otoferlin have been found to be associated with inherited, non-syndromic congenital hearing loss and temperature sensitive auditory neuropathy (TSAN). The sense of hearing depends on reliable and temporally precise neurotransmitter release at the synapses of inner hair cells (IHCs) of the cochlea. Inner hair cells of the cochlea derive their name from hair bundle (stereocilia) protruding at the apical tip of the cell, that are arranged in rows of graded height. The nanometer displacement of the hair bundle opens mechanically gated ion channels that depolarize the cell. This change in membrane potential triggers calcium dependent fusion of synaptic vesicles with the plasma membrane and the release of neurotransmitter. In IHCs, Calcium-regulated exocytosis and neurotransmitter release exhibit fast kinetics in achieving exquisite temporal fidelity. To aid in fidelity and for allowing high rates of sustained synaptic neurotransmission, IHCs contain specialized structures called synaptic ribbons for tethering synaptic vesicles at release sites. The calcium triggered synaptic vesicle fusion with the plasma membrane is believed to be driven by the assembly of SNARE proteins. However, SNARE proteins are insensitive to calcium. In conventional neurotransmission in neurons, synaptotagmin 1 confers calcium sensitivity to SNARE-mediated fast synchronous neurotransmission. However, Yasunaga et al. 1999 and Beurg et al. 2010 have reported that synaptotagmin 1 was not detected in mature IHCs and it has been suggested that IHCs have evolved a unique calcium sensor, otoferlin for calcium-regulated synaptic neurotransmission. The evidence for calcium sensor hypothesis of otoferlin comes from Roux et al., 2006 who reported that mice lacking otoferlin were profoundly deaf and lack synaptic vesicle exocytosis in IHCs. Otoferlin has also been shown to be required for calcium dependent synaptic exocytosis at immature outer hair cells (OHCs) and vestibular hair cells. Otoferlin belongs to ferlin family of proteins and consists of six C 2 domains (C 2 A- C 2 F) linked in tandem followed by a single-pass C-terminal transmembrane region. C 2 domains are known to bind to calcium and lipids. The lipid and calcium binding properties of synaptic proteins are critical characteristics that define and shape the release properties of a synapse, and thus, without a quantitative characterization of these activities, an understanding of otoferlin’s function in hair cells will remain elusive. This dissertation addresses the intrinsic calcium binding properties of each C 2 domain of otoferlin and also the lipid binding specificity and the effects of lipids on calcium binding were also assessed using liposome sedimentation assays and laurdan fluorescence measurements. On the basis of our results, we proposed that the C 2 C and C 2 F domains of otoferlin preferentially bind PI(4, 5) P 2 and that PI(4, 5) P 2 may serve to target otoferlin to the presynapse in a calcium-independent manner. This positioning would facilitate fast calcium-dependent exocytosis at the hair cell synapse. Many C 2 domains involved in exocytosis also tilt, orient and partially insert into membranes to aid facilitating membrane fusion. To determine the orientation and structural characterization of the C 2 F domain at the membrane interface, we used label free sum frequency generation vibrational spectroscopy. We found that the C 2 F domain of the otoferlin interact with membranes DPPC:DPPS and orients 32 ° normal to the membrane. Our results represent the first structural view of any C 2 domain of otoferlin docked at the membrane interface. In my dissertation, I also characterized the temperature sensitive mutants of otoferlin. Deletion of glutamic acid at position 1804 in otoferlin results in a temperature-sensitive mutant in the C 2 F domain (C 2 F-TS) that causes <b>temporary</b> <b>deafness</b> in febrile patients. our results using CD-spectroscopy, tryptophan fluorescence and urea denaturation methods, we found that C 2 F-TS may have minor structural changes localized in the active site...|$|E
