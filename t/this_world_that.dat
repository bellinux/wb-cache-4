500|$|The album also {{garnered}} numerous {{mixed reviews}} that {{felt that it}} would only be enjoyed by fans of the franchise; Staples described the tracks as [...] "musical fan fiction ready for both celestial dance floors and distant forgotten landscapes", while Jon Dolan, reviewing for Rolling Stone magazine, rated it {{two and a half stars}} out of five, feeling that many of the producers involved with the project didn't experiment enough with the concept that it was [...] "hard to get beyond timid fanboy reverence." [...] The harshest review came from Sam Goldner of Tiny Mix Tapes, who bashed the album as a major contributing factor to [...] "the nasty details, the blemishes, the facts of <b>this</b> <b>world</b> <b>that</b> truly corrupt our collective sense of well-being and hope" [...] in regards to how the Star Wars franchise has been marketed.|$|E
500|$|He wrote: [...] "I have {{declared}} and demonstrated openly and concluded, from chapter 22 {{to the end}} of this whole book, that all people of these our Indies are human, so far as is possible by the natural and human way and without the light of faith â€“ had their republics, places, towns, and cities most abundant and well provided for, and did not lack anything to live politically and socially, and attain and enjoy civil happiness.... And they equaled many nations of <b>this</b> <b>world</b> <b>that</b> are renowned and considered civilized, and they surpassed many others, and to none were they inferior. Among those they equaled were the Greeks and the Romans, and they surpassed them by many good and better customs. They surpassed also the English and the French and some of the people of our own Spain; and they were incomparably superior to countless others, in having good customs and lacking many evil ones." [...] This work in which Las Casas combined his own ethnographic observations with those of other writers, and compared customs and cultures between different peoples, has been characterized as an early beginning of the discipline of anthropology.|$|E

500|$|Most {{historians have}} seen Nigel as an administrator, not a {{religious}} bishop. The historian David Knowles wrote that Nigel [...] "had devoted all his energies and abilities to matters purely secular; {{in the department of}} financial administration he was supreme, and more than any other man he helped to ensure the continuity and development of the excellent administrative practice initiated under Henry I". The historian W. L. Warren said that [...] "Stephen probably paid dearly for the dismissal of Bishop Roger of Salisbury and Bishop Nigel of Ely, for the expertise of the exchequer was lodged in their expertise." [...] Whatever Nigel's administrative talent, his ecclesiastical abilities are generally held to be low; the Gesta Stephani says of both him and Alexander that they were [...] "men who loved display and were rash in their reckless presumption... disregarding the holy and simple manner of life that befits a Christian priest they devoted themselves so utterly to warfare and the vanities of <b>this</b> <b>world</b> <b>that</b> whenever they attended court by appointment they... aroused general astonishment on account of the extraordinary concourse of knights by which they were surrounded on every side." ...|$|E

In an interview with MTV News, Lovato said that it [...] "really describes the show. I'm excited about that." [...] Speaking of the video, co-director Malloy said, [...] "The idea for the video is to create this hyperreal world, that's the word we keep using, La La Land. Fame has definitely gotten to everybody's head. It's more like [...] {{is the only one}} in <b>this</b> <b>world</b> <b>that</b> fame hasn't gotten to." [...] According to Lovato, her Sonny with a Chance co-stars play [...] "stereotypical Hollywood Los Angeles [...] big type of people." [...] The video premiered on December 19, 2008 on Disney Channel. It was released to the iTunes Store on January 20, 2009. For the video, the lyric [...] "I still eat McDonald's" [...] was changed to [...] "I still eat at Ronald's". Jefferson Reid of E! Online praised the video, writing, [...] "Mocking Hollywood phonies is always cool by us, and bonus points to Demi Lovato for doing it while rocking out in admirable form. Skewering the [...] "La La Land" [...] machine with sass and grit, Disney's latest everygirl rock star seems like she might eventually give Miley Cyrus a real run for her money." ...|$|E
500|$|On March 5, 1770, {{a street}} {{confrontation}} resulted in British soldiers killing five civilians in {{what came to}} be known as the Boston Massacre. The accused soldiers were arrested on criminal charges and had trouble finding legal representation. Adams ultimately agreed to defend them, though he feared that it would hurt his reputation. In arguing their case, Adams made his legendary statement regarding jury decisions: [...] "Facts are stubborn things; and whatever may be our wishes, our inclinations, or the dictates of our passion, they cannot alter the state of facts and evidence." [...] He also expounded upon Blackstone's Ratio: [...] "It is more important that innocence be protected than it is that guilt be punished, for guilt and crimes are so frequent in <b>this</b> <b>world</b> <b>that</b> they cannot all be punished. But if innocence itself is brought to the bar and condemned, perhaps to die, then the citizen will say, 'whether I do good or whether I do evil is immaterial, for innocence itself is no protection,' and if such an idea as that were to take hold in the mind of the citizen that would be the end of security whatsoever." [...] Adams won an acquittal for six of the soldiers. Two of them who had fired directly into the crowd were charged with murder but were convicted only of manslaughter. Adams was paid a small sum by his clients.|$|E

500|$|Principal {{photography}} {{took place}} in Vancouver, British Columbia in April 2009, and lasted for approximately 67 days. Many filming locations were established in Downtown Vancouver and its surroundings. Stage shooting for the film {{took place at the}} Canadian Motion Picture Park studio in Burnaby, an adjacent city that forms part of Metro Vancouver. Kosinski devised and constructed twelve to fifteen of the film's sets, including Kevin Flynn's safe house, a creation he illustrated on a napkin for a visual effects test. [...] "I wanted to build as much as possible. It was important to me that this world feel real, and anytime I could build something I did. So I hired guys that I went to architecture school with to work on the sets for this film, and hopefully people who watch the film feel like thereâ€™s a certain physicality to <b>this</b> <b>world</b> <b>that</b> hopefully they appreciate, knowing that real architects actually put this whole thing together." [...] The film was shot in dual camera 3D using Pace Fusion rigs like James Cameron's Avatar, but unlike the Sony F950 cameras on that film, Tron used the F35s. [...] "The benefit of ," [...] according to director Kosinski, [...] "is that it has a full 35mm sensor which gives you that beautiful cinematic shallow depth of field." [...] The film's beginning portions were shot in 2D, while forty minutes of the film were vertically enhanced for IMAX. Digital Domain was contracted to work on the visual effects, while companies such as Prime Focus Group, DD Vancouver, and Mr. X were brought on to collaborate with producer on the post-production junctures of Tron: Legacy. Post-production wrapped on November 25, 2010.|$|E
500|$|On the red suit, Maslansky said, [...] "We wanted {{something}} that looked militaristic and functional, but also dramatic and sexy" [...] adding that it was [...] "tricky" [...] making it practical. To {{begin the process of}} creating the suit, Quesada contacted Ryan Meinerding and the costume artists and design team at Marvel Studios, who all contributed design ideas, with one of Meinerding's ultimately being picked. Quesada, who previously worked as an artist on Daredevil comics, gave several suggestions, including the incorporation of some of how New York was created into the suit, which led to the use of rivets and [...] "architectural" [...] shapes. The suit is intended to look like a Kevlar vest, and the black sections are an homage to comic panels where the artists highlighted certain areas with red, with [...] "deeper portions" [...] in shadow. On the mask, Meinerding noted the difficulty in designing the entire top half of a face that is intended to match the bottom half of an actor's face, [...] "because half of his face has to be covered and has its own expression and the actorâ€™s face is going to be doing something else". For the billy clubs used by Daredevil in the series, which were designed by Andy Park, discussions were had about having them holstered on the right leg, given that both Cox and his stunt double Chris Brewster are right handed, but it was ultimately decided to have the holster on the left hand side {{as it is in the}} [...] "classic profile" [...] of the comics. DeKnight explained that Murdock's Daredevil suit does not have the [...] "DD" [...] emblem on the chest as seen in the comics, because Murdock receives his moniker only after the suit is introduced. He also felt that the emblem was [...] "one of the more problematic emblems in superhero-dom", and that Daredevil's suit in the comics was [...] "very difficult to translate to screen, especially in <b>this</b> <b>world</b> <b>that</b> is grounded and gritty".|$|E

2500|$|Folklorist Sabina Magliocco {{supported}} this idea, noting {{that a great}} many of those Californian Pagans whom she interviewed claimed that they had been greatly interested in mythology and folklore as children, imagining a world of [...] "enchanted nature and magical transformations, filled with lords and ladies, witches and wizards, and humble but often wise peasants". Magliocco noted that it was <b>this</b> <b>world</b> <b>that</b> pagans [...] "strive to re-create in some measure". Further support for Adler's idea came from American Wiccan priestess Judy Harrow, who noted that among her comrades, there was a feeling that [...] "you don't become pagan, you discover that you always were". They have also been supported by Pagan studies scholar Graham Harvey.|$|E

2500|$|In 1952, Cartier-Bresson {{published}} his book Images Ã  la sauvette, whose English-language edition was titled The Decisive Moment. It included {{a portfolio of}} 126 of his photos from the East and the West. The book's cover was drawn by Henri Matisse. For his 4,500-word philosophical preface, Cartier-Bresson took his keynote text from the 17th century Cardinal de Retz, [...] "Il n'y a rien dans ce monde qui n'ait un moment decisif" [...] ("There is nothing in <b>this</b> <b>world</b> <b>that</b> {{does not have a}} decisive moment"). Cartier-Bresson applied this to his photographic style. He said: [...] "Photographier: c'est dans un mÃªme instant et en une fraction de seconde reconnaÃ®tre un fait et l'organisation rigoureuse de formes perÃ§ues visuellement qui expriment et signifient ce fait" [...] ("To me, photography is the simultaneous recognition, in a fraction of a second, of the significance of an event as well as of a precise organization of forms which give that event its proper expression.").|$|E
2500|$|The trope {{of masculinity}} {{continued}} in season two. Vox's Todd VanDerWerff stated, [...] "...above all else, True Detective wants {{to explore the}} role of men in society." [...] "Yet if season one was already interested in the topic, then season two has nearly jumped off the cliff with its obsessions, {{to the degree that}} Rachel McAdams's Ani is defined largely by her rejection of the more open and traditionally [...] "feminine" [...] New Age philosophy of her father and her embrace of the hardened, traditionally [...] "masculine" [...] life of the emotionally closed-off police officer," [...] he continued. VanDerWerff also noted that season two's three male leads are all dealing with their own issues of masculinity; [...] "Ray seems tortured by having to exist as a man in <b>this</b> <b>world</b> <b>that</b> doesn't share his ideals," [...] "Frank is trying to walk a very noble, masculine path by taking his dark, dirty enterprise legitimate," [...] and [...] " [...] is mostly playing out a very typical story of a deeply repressed gay man who's trying to fight back his own impulses." ...|$|E

[...] The women heard (this), but they were unwilling to give their earrings to their husbands; but they said to them: Ye desire to make a graven image of a molten image without any power in it to deliver. The Holy One, blessed be He, gave the women their reward {{in this world and}} the world to come.
