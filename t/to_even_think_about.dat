500|$|The entire Simpson {{family was}} {{designed}} {{so that they would}} be recognizable in silhouette. The family was crudely drawn, because Groening had submitted basic sketches to the animators, assuming they would clean them up; instead, they just traced over his drawings. Maggie's physical features are generally not used in other characters; for example, in the later seasons, no character other than Lisa shares her hairline. While designing Maggie and Lisa, Groening [...] "couldn't be bothered <b>to</b> <b>even</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> girls' hair styles". At the time, Groening was primarily drawing in black and white and when designing Lisa and Maggie, he [...] "just gave them this kind of spiky starfish hair style, not thinking that they would eventually be drawn in color".|$|E
500|$|Fans of {{the show}} speculated that Dylan would be paired with Nick's ex-wife, Sharon Newman (Sharon Case), to which Case responded by stating, [...] "Everybody’s speculating about Dylan, the new {{character}} coming to town but, all I can say is, I think it’s fun because it’s a hoot to speculate". Luke Kerr of Zap2it noted how fast Dylan met Sharon, and said they could potentially be a [...] "popular pairing with fans". Of working with Case, Burton stated: [...] "Sharon Case is actually very fun, and she makes me laugh. So half the time in scenes where I am laughing, I am really laughing at Sharon! [...] She has that personality where she makes me laugh." [...] He also noted that fans {{of the show}} on Twitter have seen how [...] "comfortable" [...] and [...] "easy" [...] the character's on-screen relationship is. Dylan later shares a one-night stand with Chelsea Lawson (Melissa Claire Egan), who was pregnant with Adam Newman's (Michael Muhney) child; she decides to pass the baby off as Dylan's, and the two later marry. Egan described the character's decision to keep the child's paternity a secret as a [...] "ticking time bomb". Burton stated that Dylan is [...] "not the sharpest tool in the shed", since he believed what Chelsea was telling him. When asked about the child, Burton said: [...] "This kid is everything to him, so once we figure out whose it is, if it’s not his, it’s {{not going to be}} a good situation for anybody." [...] When asked if Dylan could forgive Chelsea, Burton added: [...] "That’s a tough one. I don’t know what kind of mental state this is going to put Dylan in, <b>to</b> <b>even</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> that." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{family was}} crudely drawn, because Groening had {{submitted}} basic sketches to the animators, assuming they would clean them up; instead, they just traced over his drawings. The entire Simpson family was {{designed so that}} they would be recognizable in silhouette. When Groening originally designed Homer, he put his own initials into the character's hairline and ear: the hairline resembled an 'M', and the right ear resembled a 'G'. Groening decided that this would be too distracting though, and redesigned the ear to look normal. He still draws the ear as a 'G' when he draws pictures of Homer for fans. Marge's distinct beehive hairstyle was inspired by Bride of Frankenstein and the style that Margaret Groening wore during the 1960s, although her hair was never blue. Bart's original design, which appeared in the first shorts, had spikier hair, and the spikes were of different lengths. The number was later limited to nine spikes, all of the same size. At the time Groening was primarily drawing in black and [...] "not thinking that [...] would eventually be drawn in color" [...] gave him spikes that appear to be an extension of his head. Lisa's physical features are generally not used in other characters; for example, in the later seasons, no character other than Maggie shares her hairline. While designing Lisa, Groening [...] "couldn't be bothered <b>to</b> <b>even</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> girls' hair styles". When designing Lisa and Maggie, he [...] "just gave them this kind of spiky starfish hair style, not thinking that they would eventually be drawn in color". Groening storyboarded and scripted every short (now known as The Simpsons shorts), which were then animated by a team including David Silverman and Wes Archer, both of whom would later become directors on the series.|$|E

2500|$|The crash {{causes the}} airbags to deploy, {{and the one}} on the passenger's side sends the Tender figurine into Adam's left eye. [...] Adam pulls out the figurine and asks Tender to find a rock and hit him with it. Tender refuses, but Adam asks him to find any rock that he can just to disfigure him with, {{pleading}} that if he goes to jail for his murders, he doesn't want the other inmates <b>to</b> <b>even</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> sexually abusing him. Tender reluctantly agrees to do this, as long as Adam will tell him when to stop, but Adam keeps telling him to swing again until it is too late and Adam dies. Immediately afterwards, Fertility shows up in a taxicab and takes Tender away from the landfill. They go back to Oregon, and Fertility plans to go on a quick job assignment to make some money. Fertility's job is being a surrogate mother for couples who can't conceive (Fertility is actually a pseudonym - her real name is Gwen); however, Fertility actually happens to be barren, so her job is, in essence, prostitution. The job she takes coincidentally happens to be for Tender's former employers. In the middle of the night, Tender sneaks into the house, and Fertility has sex with him in the guest bedroom (for a short while, for according to Tender, he only got in her a half an inch and it was over).|$|E
2500|$|... "Kim" [...] was {{the first}} song the rapper {{recorded}} for the album, shortly after finishing work on The Slim Shady LP in late 1998. Eminem wrote [...] "Kim" [...] {{at a time in}} which {{he and his wife were}} separated, and he had just watched a romantic movie alone at a theater. Originally intending to write a love song for her while using ecstasy, the rapper hoped to avoid overt sentimentality and thus began writing a song of hate. With the track, the rapper aimed to create a short horror story in the form of a song. Once the couple reconciled, Eminem recalls, [...] "I asked her to tell me what she thought of it. I remember my dumb ass saying, 'I know this is a fucked-up song, but it shows how much I care about you. <b>To</b> <b>even</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> you this much. To even put you on a song like this'. [...] " [...] The song [...] "Stan" [...] was produced by The 45 King. Eminem's manager, Paul Rosenberg, sent Eminem a tape of the producer's beats, and the second track featured a sample of English singer-songwriter Dido's [...] "Thank You". Upon hearing the song's lyrics, Eminem felt they described an obsessed fan, which became the inspiration for the song. The writing process for [...] "Stan" [...] differed greatly from Eminem's usual strategy, in which song concepts form during the writing: [...] "'Stan' was one of the few songs that I actually sat down and had everything mapped out for. I knew what it was going to be about. [...] " [...] Dido later heard [...] "Stan" [...] and enjoyed it, and observed, [...] "I got this letter out of the blue one day. It said, 'We like your album, we've used this track. Hope you don't mind, and hope you like it. ' When they sent [...] to me and I played it in my hotel room, I was like, 'Wow! This track's amazing.

60|$|In {{all this}} she spoke most truthfully, for she hated her step-daughter, both {{because she was}} a fine young woman and much {{regarded}} by her father, and because she had certain rights to the estate of said father, which his present wife did not wish <b>to</b> recognise, or <b>even</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>about.</b> So Martin Newcombe was perfectly welcome to take away such things as would render it unnecessary for the girl to now return to the home in which she had been born.

2500|$|In contrast, Marty Sliva of IGN was {{critical}} of Trico's behavior during puzzles combined with camera controls making sections of the game more frustrating, particularly during interiors due to the cramped nature of certain levels {{and the size of}} Trico detracting from the experience, calling it [...] "rare <b>to</b> <b>even</b> have <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> the camera in a third-person game in 2016, but I found myself constantly being pulled out of the experience trying to wrestle with my point of view".

40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we are trying}} to answer the question: how to <b>think</b> <b>about</b> the Beyond?

In brief encounter of gods and men in the fourfold, gods wink at mortals and mediate a sense of how we should understand the divine essence. This is the breakthrough from and of the Beyond. The Beyond in the mirror-play of the fourfold is now considered to be as part of the world and that is a radically different way of philosophical understanding of the world and things in it, including humans as mortals...|$|R

40|$|While {{usability}} {{testing is}} well established, assessing the usability of security software, tools, or methods deserves more careful consideration. It {{has been argued}} that dealing with security has become too difficult for individuals or organizations to manage effectively or to use conveniently. As difficult as it is for system administrators and developers to deal with, security is even more challenging for casual users. Indeed, it is much too easy for casual/home users to configure the security of their systems in non-optimal ways that leave their systems inadvertently insecure. This is exacerbated by the fact that casual users are focused on matters other than security, and likely would prefer not <b>even</b> <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>about</b> security. This brief report argues that when security and/or privacy are part of the equation, traditional methods for usability testing should be re-considered. The purpose of this brief report is to argue for and outline a method associated with a new approach to usability testing for examining usable security issues...|$|R
