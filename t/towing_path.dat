5|$|The steady {{increase}} in traffic encouraged the trustees {{to press on}} with improvements. Witton Brook was widened in 1788, and the lock was raised, but subsidence caused by the salt mining resulted in a new lock being needed in 1826. A longer-term solution {{was provided by the}} decision to move Northwich lock to a new site below the town. When the work was finished in 1829, Witton Brook lock was no longer necessary, and was removed. New cuts and locks were built through the 1790s at Vale Royal, Newbridge, Hartford and Hunts, and Butty Meadow lock was removed. In response to petitions, the construction of a <b>towing</b> <b>path</b> suitable for horses was started in 1792, and was completed as far as Anderton by mid-1793. It was later extended to Winsford, and bow-hauling of boats by men was ended.|$|E
5|$|In 1794, a basin {{was built}} above Framilode lock, so that vessels could wait {{there until the}} tide in the Severn was at a {{suitable}} level. This had been requested by the Thames and Severn Canal company, but requests for a horse <b>towing</b> <b>path</b> in 1799 and 1812 were dismissed as too expensive. They eventually provided one after the Gloucester and Berkeley Canal had been built, and the canal was {{the only part of}} the waterway from Shrewsbury on the Severn to Teddington on the Thames that did not have one. It was completed in August 1827. The opening of the Gloucester and Berkeley Canal in 1825 required a slight diversion where they crossed at Saul, and the levels were adjusted by building a new lock on the Stroudwater below the junction, to ensure neither company lost water to the other. The new company paid for its construction.> After the Gloucester and Berkeley Canal opened to Sharpness in 1827, the link between Saul and the Severn at Framilode was used much less, although coal from the Forest of Dean still used that route.|$|E
5|$|The locks were {{suitably}} sized for Severn Trows, which were , and could carry 60 tons. The canal was not {{provided with a}} <b>towing</b> <b>path</b> for horses. Some boats sailed along the canal, but most were bow-hauled by men. Framilode lock {{at the entrance to}} the canal was a tide lock, with multiple gates to cope with all states of the tide. When a vessel arrived at the junction, a rope would be taken from it to the shore, and attached to a capstan, which would then be used to haul the boat into the lock. Once the canal was open, the Proprietors worked hard to improve the facilities, and a number of warehouses were built. Many of the shareholders were also involved with the Thames and Severn Canal scheme, which was completed in 1789 and provided a through route between Wallbridge and the River Thames at Lechlade. The navigation was seen as a commercial waterway; pleasure boats were discouraged by the imposition of a charge of £1 (2012:£) for the use of each lock.|$|E

25|$|Users of the Trent and Mersey Canal, the Loughborough Canal and the Erewash Canal next demanded major {{improvements}} to the river down to Gainsborough, including new cuts, locks, dredging and a <b>towing</b> <b>path</b> suitable for horses. The Dadfords, who were engineers on the Trent and Mersey Canal, estimated the cost at £20,000, but the proposal was opposed by landowners and merchants on the river, while the Navigator, published in 1788, estimated that around 500 men who were employed to bow-haul boats would have lost their jobs. Agreement could not be reached, and so William Jessop was asked to re-assess the situation. He suggested that dredging, deepening, and restricting {{the width of the}} channel could make significant {{improvements to the}} navigable depth, although cuts would be required at Wilford, Nottingham bridge and Holme. This proposal formed the basis for an Act of Parliament obtained in 1783, which also allowed a horse <b>towing</b> <b>path</b> to be built. The work was completed by September 1787, and dividends of 5 per cent were paid on the capital during 1786 and 1787, increasing to 7 per cent, the maximum allowed by the Act, after that. Jessop carried out a survey for a side cut and lock at Sawley in 1789, and it was built by 1793.|$|E
25|$|Muncy Dam {{was built}} {{across the river}} at Muncy Creek Township. This dam {{provided}} the water that was needed to fill the canal along a stretch canal that began at Port Penn and ended at Sunbury. The dam, canal and <b>towing</b> <b>path</b> were all constructed for {{a considerable amount of}} money. Around these construction projects, the hamlet of Port Penn was built. Upon completion of the canal in 1834 it was already a thriving community featuring a manufacturer of canal boats. Other businesses in Port Penn included hotels and taverns that provided housing and food for the men working on the canal, and a blacksmith and a saddle maker. There was a butcher who also operated a grocery business, a weaver, a wagon builder, a shoemaker, an ice business, as well as several teachers, masons and general merchants.|$|E
25|$|Navigation through Lincoln {{and on to}} Boston was {{hampered}} by the shallow draught available under the medieval High Bridge, just below Brayford Pool. Sir Joseph Banks, when proposing {{the construction of the}} Horncastle Canal knew that the problem needed addressing, and William Jessop was commissioned to survey the Witham and the Fossdyke in 1791, with particular reference to the junction between the two. He proposed a bypass to the south of the city, using the Sincil Dyke, or excavating the channel beneath the bridge, although he recognized that this solution was not ideal, due to the narrow width of the bridge hole, and the lack of a <b>towing</b> <b>path</b> through it. However, the city was keen to keep trade within its limits, and improvements to High Bridge, which were completed by 1795, were authorised as part of the Horncastle Canal act of 1792.|$|E

25|$|Simpson's {{victory in}} 1904 coincided with an {{increased}} use of the river for leisure. As he could not charge these boats {{for use of the}} locks, the situation was resolved for a time in 1906 by the formation of the River Ouse Locks Committee, who rented the locks between Great Barford and Bedford. Over 2000 boats were recorded using Bedford Lock in a three-month period soon afterwards. Despite pressure from local authorities and navigation companies, the upper river was closed for trade, and a Royal Commission reported in 1909 on the poor state of the lower river, the lack of any consistent authority to manage it, and the unusual practice of towing horses having to jump over fences because there were no gates where they crossed the <b>towing</b> <b>path.</b> The Ouse Drainage Board was formed in 1918, but had no powers to deal with navigation issues, and {{it was not until the}} powers of the Land Drainage Act (1930) were used to create the Great Ouse Catchment Board that effective action could be taken.|$|E

The first , running from a junction with the Kennet and Avon Canal, along the Cam valley, to a terminal basin at Paulton, were in use by 1805, together with several tramways. A planned [...] branch to Midford was never built, but in 1815 a tramway was laid along its <b>towing</b> <b>path.</b> In 1871 the tramway was purchased by the Somerset & Dorset Joint Railway (S), and operated until the 1950s.|$|E

Boats also worked along part of the Newmill Channel towards Tenterden. The river {{did not have a}} <b>towing</b> <b>path,</b> and the boats were bow-hauled by men.

500|$|Construction of {{the canal}} was {{authorised}} by an Act of Parliament passed in 1665. The Act allowed a number of rivers to be made navigable, and in each case, undertakers were appointed, {{to carry out the}} work, as were commissioners, chosen from the local justices, who were responsible for confirming the tolls. The undertakers made very slow progress, and it was not until 1710 that the work was completed. They had built locks and some artificial cuts to bypass difficult sections of the river, and created a <b>towing</b> <b>path</b> for horses. The route was [...] long, of which [...] were new cuts, and although some of the rest used the course of the river, much of it followed secondary streams. New undertakers were not appointed as old ones died, and by 1767, the navigation was effectively owned by one man, a Mr Edward Pyott. Local people felt that he was exceeding his powers, and they obtained a second Act of Parliament in 1767, which noted that Pyott had created a trading and carrying monopoly, as he would refuse to carry coal and other goods which interfered with his own activities. The preamble to the Act claimed that this was harming the poor and the inhabitants of Winchester.|$|E
