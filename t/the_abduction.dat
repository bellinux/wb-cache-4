5|$|Abduction of marriage-age {{women was}} common during the Liao dynasty. Khitans men of all social classes {{participated in the}} activity, and the abductees were both Khitan and Han. In some cases, this was {{a step in the}} {{courtship}} process, where the woman would agree to <b>the</b> <b>abduction</b> and the resulting sexual intercourse, and then the abductor and abductee would return to the woman's home to announce their intention to marry. This process was known as baimen (拜門). In other cases, <b>the</b> <b>abduction</b> would be non-consensual and would result in a rape.|$|E
5|$|Carl Probyn {{witnessed}} <b>the</b> <b>abduction</b> of his stepdaughter {{from within}} sight of their home. He saw two people in a mid-sized gray carpossibly a Mercury Monarchmake a U-turn at the school bus stop where Dugard was waiting, and a woman forcing Dugard into the car. Probyn gave chase on a bicycle, {{but was unable to}} overtake the vehicle. Some of Dugard's classmates were also witnesses to <b>the</b> <b>abduction.</b> Initial suspects included Probyn and Slayton, though they did not know each other and Slayton had only had a brief relationship with Terry in 1979, not knowing he had a child. When Dugard was rescued, Slayton expressed an interest in meeting his daughter and taking a paternity test. Dugard refused. Probyn took and passed several polygraph tests, and Slayton was also quickly cleared of suspicion.|$|E

50|$|Many Tamil nationalists claim {{there was}} a {{resurgence}} of abductions in 2005 after the failure of Norwegian mediated peace process. The victims of <b>the</b> <b>abductions</b> were predominantly Sri Lankan Tamils living in Jaffna and the capital Colombo. A notable feature in <b>the</b> <b>abductions</b> is <b>the</b> use of white vans without number plates. White van abductions {{are a part of}} life in Jaffna and <b>the</b> <b>abductions</b> are carried with impunity even during curfew hours.|$|R

Załuski, Wacław Rzewuski and Seweryn Rzewuski, all vocal opponents of foreign domination and the recently proclaimed policies. The Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth had legally and practically become a protectorate of the Russian Empire. Nonetheless, several minor beneficial reforms were adopted, political {{rights of the}} religious minorities were restored {{and the need for}} more reforms was becoming increasingly recognized.|$|E
5|$|Six months later, {{a second}} trial {{took place in}} Orlando for <b>the</b> <b>abduction</b> and murder of Kimberly Leach. Bundy was found guilty once again, after less than eight hours' deliberation, due principally to the {{testimony}} of an eyewitness who saw him leading Leach from the schoolyard to his stolen van. Important material evidence included clothing fibers with an unusual manufacturing error, found in the van and on Leach's body, which matched fibers from the jacket Bundy was wearing when he was arrested.|$|E

Goffredo and Eustazio are shocked at Rinaldo's impulsiveness and believe that he has deserted their cause.|$|E
5|$|Black {{struggles to}} find {{anything}} useful while investigating <b>the</b> <b>abduction.</b> However, he begins to experience seemingly-psychic visions which lead him to believe she {{is being held in}} their former home. The police raid the address but find it empty; Black finds a polaroid of another house inside. He is able to track down the address of this house, but goes alone this time. Reaching it, he finds Catherine in the basement, bound to a rafter. He goes to untie her but is blinded by a camera flash. He struggles with the Polaroid Man, which we see through a series of photographs taken by the man's camera. Black is able to wrest the Polaroid Man's knife away from him and stab him to death.|$|E
5|$|By {{this time}} Monteverdi {{was in his}} sixties, and his rate of {{composition}} seems to have slowed down. He had written a setting of Strozzi's Proserpina rapita (<b>The</b> <b>Abduction</b> of Proserpina), now lost except for one vocal trio, for a Mocenigo wedding in 1630, and produced a Mass for deliverance from the plague for San Marco which was performed in November 1631. His set of Scherzi musicali was published in Venice in 1632. In 1631, Monteverdi {{was admitted to the}} tonsure, and was ordained deacon, and later priest, in 1632. Although these ceremonies took place in Venice, he was nominated {{as a member of the}} clergy of Cremona; this may imply that he intended to retire there.|$|E

He attacks a security guard and steals his gun, taking head psychiatrist Dr. Hakkie hostage before escaping. Barry seeks to return to his original abduction site with Dr. Hakkie, in the hopes that the aliens will take the doctor instead when they return.

5|$|Near {{midnight on}} 20 May, Eichmann was sedated by an Israeli doctor on the Mossad team and {{dressed as a}} flight attendant. He was smuggled out of Argentina aboard the same El Al Bristol Britannia {{aircraft}} that had {{a few days earlier}} carried Israel's delegation to the official 150th anniversary celebration of Argentina's independence from Spain. After a tense delay at the airport getting the flight plan approved, the plane took off for Israel, stopping over in Dakar, Senegal, to refuel. They arrived in Israel on 22 May, and Ben-Gurion announced Eichmann's capture to the Knesset—Israel's parliament—the following afternoon. In Argentina, <b>the</b> <b>abduction</b> was met with a violent wave of antisemitism carried out by far-right elements, including the Tacuara Nationalist Movement.|$|E
5|$|The {{collection}} contains three episodes from the fifth season, five from the sixth, six from the seventh, and {{two from the}} eighth. The episodes follow the investigations of paranormal-related cases, or X-Files, by FBI Special Agents Fox Mulder and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson). Mulder is a believer in the paranormal, while the skeptical Scully has been assigned to debunk his work. Events covered in the episodes include the discovery of alien-human hybrid Cassandra Spender (Veronica Cartwright), {{the destruction of the}} Syndicate; the discovery of the remains of a space ship in Africa; the fate of Mulder's sister, Samantha; and <b>the</b> <b>abduction</b> of the former, as well as the subsequent hunt for him under the direction of John Doggett (Robert Patrick).|$|E
5|$|The {{drama is}} based on Ovid's tale of <b>the</b> <b>abduction</b> of Proserpine by Pluto, which itself {{was based on the}} Greek myth of Demeter and Persephone. Mary Shelley's version focuses on the female characters. In a largely feminist retelling from Ceres's point of view, Shelley emphasises the {{separation}} of mother and daughter and the strength offered by a community of women. Ceres represents life and love, and Pluto represents death and violence. The genres of the text also reflect gender debates of the time. Percy contributed in the lyric verse form traditionally dominated by men; Mary created a drama with elements common to early nineteenth-century women's writing: details of everyday life and empathetic dialogue.|$|E

5|$|The {{first of}} the campaigns fought by the Romans in this legendary account are the wars with various Latin cities and the Sabines. According to Livy, the Latin village of Caenina responded to the event of <b>the</b> <b>abduction</b> of the Sabine women by invading Roman territory, but were routed and their village captured. The Latins of Antemnae and those of Crustumerium were {{defeated}} next in a similar fashion. The remaining {{main body of the}} Sabines attacked Rome and briefly captured the citadel, but were then convinced to conclude a treaty with the Romans under which the Sabines became Roman citizens.|$|E
5|$|A legend narrates {{that the}} {{sacrificial}} cow Kamadhenu resided with sage Jamadagni. The earliest {{version of the}} legend, which appears in the epic Mahabharata, narrates that the thousand-armed Haihaya king, Kartavirya Arjuna, destroyed Jamadagni's hermitage and captured the calf of Kamadhenu. To retrieve the calf, Jamadagni's son Parashurama slew the king, whose sons in turn killed Jamadagni. Parashurama then destroyed the kshatriya ("warrior") race 21 times and his father is resurrected by divine grace. Similar accounts of <b>the</b> <b>abduction</b> of the celestial cow or her calf, the killing of Jamadagni by Kartavirya Arjuna, and the revenge of Parashurama resulting {{in the death of}} Kartavirya Arjuna, exist in other texts. The Bhagavata Purana mentions that the king abducted Kamadhenu as well as her calf and Parashurama defeated the king and returned the kine to his father. The Padma Purana mentions that when Kartavirya Arjuna tried to capture her, Kamadhenu, by her own power, defeated him and his army and flew off to heaven; the enraged king then killed Jamadagni.|$|E
5|$|In September 1990, Dugard and {{her family}} moved from the Los Angeles County city of Arcadia, to Meyers, a rural town south of South Lake Tahoe, California, because {{they thought it was}} a safer community. At the time of <b>the</b> <b>abduction,</b> Dugard was in the fifth grade and, because of her shyness, was {{worrying}} about an upcoming field trip. She was close to her mother, Terry Probyn, and her infant half sister Shayna who was born in 1990. Her biological father, Ken Slayton, did not know he had fathered a child. Although her mother married a man named Carl Probyn, Dugard was never close to her stepfather. On June 10, 1991, Dugard's mother, who worked as a typesetter at a print house, left for work early in the day. Eleven-year-old Dugard, wearing her favorite all-pink outfit, walked up the hill from her house, against traffic, to catch the school bus. When she was halfway up the hill, a car approached her. She thought that the man in the car would ask for directions. When he rolled down the window, he shocked her unconscious with a stun gun and abducted her. The man was Phillip Greg Garrido. Nancy, who the District Attorney in the Dugard case believes scouted Dugard as a prize for Garrido, held Dugard down in the car as she drifted {{in and out of consciousness}} during the three hour drive from her home to the Garrido home in Antioch. The only time Dugard spoke was when she pleaded that her parents could not afford a ransom.|$|E
40|$|Aim: Measurement of the {{acetabular}} cup {{orientation is}} critical in patients after total hip arthroplasty (THA). One important measurement is <b>the</b> acetabular <b>abduction</b> angle. <b>The</b> {{purpose of the present}} study was to compare the measurements of <b>the</b> acetabular <b>abduction</b> angle using radiographic analysis software with the measurements made by computed tomography (CT) analysis software. Methods: CT scans and radiograph exams were performed on 150 patients after THA. <b>The</b> acetabular <b>abduction</b> angle was measured from CT using CT-based image analysis software and from radiographs using the dedicated measurement tools of digital radiographic software. Results: The two measurement systems showed no significant difference in the calculation of <b>the</b> acetabular <b>abduction</b> angle (0. 35 ± 5. 41 °; p= 0. 425) and a moderate correlation was found between the two methods (r= 0. 619; p< 0. 001). Discussion: Digital radiographic software provides an accurate and precise measurement of <b>the</b> acetabular <b>abduction</b> angle...|$|R
