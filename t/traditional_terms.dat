5|$|The {{holding up}} {{of one hand}} with middle and index fingers crossed was the usual gesture found in New Zealand in 1999–2001. The T-shape was also used when saying {{time-out}}. The time-out gesture is made with two hands - one hand held horizontally, palm down, the other hand vertically with the fingertips touching {{the bottom of the}} horizontal hand. In the US, although the more modern time-out has largely supplanted <b>traditional</b> <b>terms,</b> often accompanied by the time-out gesture, the crossed fingers gesture remains common.|$|E
5|$|In Scandinavian folklore, {{a diverse}} array of human-like supernatural beings are attested which might {{be thought of as}} elves and which might partly {{originate}} in medieval Scandinavian beliefs. However, the characteristics and names of these beings has varied widely across time and space, and they cannot be neatly categorised. These beings are sometimes known by words descended directly from Old Norse álfr. However, in the modern languages, these <b>traditional</b> <b>terms</b> have tended to be replaced with other terms. Things are further {{complicated by the fact that}} when referring to the elves of Old Norse mythology, scholars have adopted new forms based directly on the Old Norse word álfr. The following table summarises the situation in the main modern standard languages of Scandinavia.|$|E

40|$|In {{order to}} improve the {{comprehensive}} performance and expand the scope of application of <b>traditional</b> <b>term</b> co-occurrence models, this study proposes Unified Term Co-occurrence Model. It unites two types of <b>traditional</b> <b>term</b> co-occurrence models (which are called mother models of Unified Term Co-occurrence Model) and could make a series of compound models of them for various research conditions. Precision and stability are two key performance indicators of term co-occurrence models. The first type of <b>traditional</b> <b>term</b> co-occurrence models are good at stability and {{the second type of}} <b>traditional</b> <b>term</b> co-occurrence models are good at precision. The experimental results in this study confirm that precision and stability of Unified Term Co-occurrence Model (UTCM) are not lower than both of its mother models. Then, a new measure for comprehensive performance is proposed and Unified Term Co-occurrence Model (UTCM) achieves better comprehensive performance compared with both of its mother models. Researchers can use unified term co-occurrence model instead of traditional models as an important tool to get more rational experimental results in relative research fields such as information retrieval, natural linguistic processing and computational linguistics, etc...|$|R

Consisting of 37 {{characters}} and four tone marks, it transcribes all possible sounds in Mandarin. Zhuyin was introduced in China by the Republican Government in the 1910s and used alongside the Wade-Giles system, which used a modified Latin alphabet. The Wade system was replaced by Hanyu Pinyin in 1958 by the Government of the People's Republic of China, and at the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) in 1982. Although Taiwan adopted Hanyu Pinyin as its official romanization system in 2009, Bopomofo is still an official transliteration system there and remains widely used as an educational tool and for electronic input methods.|$|E

25|$|As per the {{principle}} of cabinet solidarity, all cabinet ministers were expected to vote in favour of government-introduced legislation. While backbench MPs in 2003, six future cabinet ministers voted in favour of a Canadian Alliance motion defining marriage in exclusively <b>traditional</b> <b>terms.</b> Joe Comuzzi decided to leave cabinet in order to vote against SSM. John Efford, a cabinet minister who recently opposed SSM decided to vote in favour of C-38. Former Liberal MP Pat O'Brien said he was personally told by six ministers that they may leave the cabinet rather than support SSM legislation, but this did not happen. Stephen Harper has pressured Paul Martin to allow his cabinet members a free vote, citing the precedent of Brian Mulroney in a capital punishment vote in 1988.|$|E
25|$|He was {{possibly}} the Theban proxenos or consul for Aegina and/or Molossia, {{as indicated in}} another of his odes, Nemean 7, in which he glorifies Neoptolemus, a national hero of Aegina and Molossia. According to tradition, Neoptolemus died disgracefully {{in a fight with}} priests at the temple in Delphi over their share of some sacrificial meat. Pindar diplomatically glosses over this and concludes mysteriously with an earnest protestation of innocence"But shall my heart never admit that I with words none can redeem dishonoured Neoptolemus". Possibly he was responding to anger among Aeginetans and/or Molossians over his portrayal of Neoptolemus in an earlier poem, Paean 6, which had been commissioned by the priests at Delphi and which depicted the hero's death in <b>traditional</b> <b>terms,</b> as divine retribution for his crimes.|$|E

500|$|Nicole Oresme (c.1323-1382) {{explained}} {{the motion of}} the spheres in <b>traditional</b> <b>terms</b> of the action of intelligences but noted that, contrary to Aristotle, some intelligences are moved; for example, the intelligence that moves the Moon's epicycle shares {{the motion of the}} lunar orb in which the epicycle is embedded. [...] He related the spheres' motions to the proportion of motive power to resistance that was impressed in each sphere when God created the heavens. [...] In discussing the relation of the moving power of the intelligence, the resistance of the sphere, and the circular velocity, he said [...] "this ratio ought not to be called a ratio of force to resistance except by analogy, because an intelligence moves by will alone... and the heavens do not resist it." ...|$|E
500|$|Jean Holm (The Times Higher Education Supplement) too {{noted the}} fast growth of {{conservative}} Christian schools {{but added that}} the book was also relevant in Britain, which was experiencing similar growth. She found the first few chapters somewhat repetitive as it expressed the uniformity of the school's practices. Richard V. Pierard (Christian Century) felt that Peshkin wrote with [...] "deeply respect" [...] for the school and its community, but Pierard, himself an evangelical, was [...] "disturbed" [...] by the community's [...] "indoctrinated" [...] values—"biblical absolutes" [...] that are [...] "part of a conservative program that has been read into Scripture". Paul F. Parsons (Christianity Today) noted that Peshkin found the school successful by <b>traditional</b> <b>terms,</b> with standardized tests, orderly climate, and [...] "fun-loving" [...] students, but lacking free exchange of ideas, as education is seen more as a transfer than a quest, and students do not learn [...] "choice, doubt, suspended judgment, [...] dissent". Parsons affirmed Peshkin's findings as [...] "remarkably representative" [...] based on his own visits to [...] "Christian schools in 60 cities", though others are less absolutist. And while Julian McAllister Groves (Journal of Contemporary Ethnography) described the text as [...] "beautifully written" [...] and [...] "poetic", he doubted whether the school's students were as converted as they said, and felt that Peshkin might have seen more [...] "role distance" [...] and examples of playing along simply for community acceptance had he stayed for lunch and other informal observations.|$|E

2500|$|Falconry is {{the hunting}} of wild quarry {{in its natural}} state and habitat {{by means of a}} trained bird of prey. There are two <b>traditional</b> <b>terms</b> used to {{describe}} a person involved in falconry: a falconer flies a falcon; an austringer (German origin) flies a hawk (Accipiter and some buteos and similar) or an eagle (Aquila or similar). In modern falconry, the red-tailed hawk (Buteo jamaicensis), the Harris's hawk (Parabuteo unicinctus), and the peregrine falcon (Falco perigrinus) are some of the more commonly used birds of prey. The practice of hunting with a conditioned falconry bird is also called [...] "hawking" [...] or [...] "gamehawking", although the words [...] "" [...] and [...] "hawker" [...] have become used so much to refer to petty traveling traders, that the terms [...] "falconer" [...] and [...] "falconry" [...] now apply to most use of trained birds of prey to catch game.

2500|$|Several {{authors have}} used the terms organ gifting and [...] "tissue gifting" [...] to {{describe}} processes behind organ and tissue transfers that are not captured by more <b>traditional</b> <b>terms</b> such as donation and transplantation. [...] The concept of [...] "gift of life" [...] in the U.S. refers {{to the fact that}} [...] "transplantable organs must be given willingly, unselfishly, and anonymously, and any money that is exchanged is to be perceived as solely for operational costs, but never for the organs themselves". [...] "Organ gifting" [...] is proposed to contrast with organ commodification. The maintenance of a spirit of altruism in this context has been interpreted by some as a mechanism through which the economic relations behind organ/tissue production, distribution, and consumption can be disguised. [...] Organ/tissue gifting differs from commodification in the sense that anonymity and social trust are emphasized to reduce the offer and request of monetary compensation. [...] It is reasoned that the implementation of the gift-giving analogy to organ transactions shows greater respect for the diseased body, honors the donor, and transforms the transaction into a morally acceptable and desirable act that is borne out of voluntarism and altruism.|$|E
