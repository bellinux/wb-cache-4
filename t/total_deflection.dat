Third-point loading was applied with a total span of 360  cm. The <b>total</b> span <b>deflection</b> of green round timber was measured using the CDP- 100 displacement gauge with 10 -cm capacity (made by Tokyo Sokki Kenkyujo Co., Ltd.). The displacement gauge was mounted on a yoke to measure the neutral axis deflection. The targeted duration of testing was 5  min. The apparent Young’s modulus was obtained based on the <b>total</b> span <b>deflection,</b> and calculated at the middle circumference of the round timber. The bending strength was calculated at the circumference of a failure part from the ratio of the mid-length circumference to the circumference at the loading point. However, 9 of the 40 green round timbers did not show failure, even at the extension limit of the testing machine’s ram cylinder. For these specimens, load at the extension limit of the test machine’s ram cylinder was considered the maximum load.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} an approximate analytical method {{to determine the}} large-deflection behaviour of rectangular simply supported thin plates under transverse loading. The method {{is based on a}} simple trial function to describe the shape of the initial and <b>total</b> <b>deflections</b> of the plate, corresponding to the first buckling mode shape of the plate when subjected to uniform in-plane compression. Therefore, the large-deflection behaviour of the plate under transverse loading can be expressed {{as a function of the}} ratio of the pre- to post-buckling in-plane stiffness of the plate, which is given in literature for plates with various membrane boundary conditions of the plate edges. Due to the simplicity of the trial function flexural and membrane actions of the plate are decoupled. It was found that the approximate method gives good insight into the large-deflection behaviour. The results of the approximate method have been compared to the results of finite element solutions and solutions available in literature. For uniformly distributed loads the approximate method gives deflections which differ less than about 10 % from the finite element simulation values...|$|R

50|$|The {{relative}} importance of each loss process {{is a function of}} the planet's mass, its atmosphere composition, and its distance from its sun. One non-thermal escape mechanism is atmospheric stripping by a solar wind in the absence of a planetary magnetosphere. Excess kinetic energy from solar winds can impart sufficient energy to the atmospheric particles to allow them to reach escape velocity, causing atmospheric escape. The solar wind, composed of ions, is deflected by magnetic fields because the charged particles within the wind flow along magnetic field lines. The presence of a magnetic field thus deflects solar winds, preventing the loss of atmosphere. On Earth, for instance, the interaction between the solar wind and earth's magnetic field deflects the solar wind about the planet, with near <b>total</b> <b>deflection</b> at a distance of 10 Earth radii. This region of deflection is called a bow shock.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, we re-examine {{the light}} {{deflection}} in the Schwarzschild and the Schwarzschild-de Sitter spacetime. First, supposing a static and spherically symmetric spacetime, we propose {{the definition of}} the <b>total</b> <b>deflection</b> angle α of the light ray by constructing a quadrilateral Σ^ 4 on the optical reference geometry M^ opt determined by the optical metric g̅_ij. On the basis of {{the definition of the}} <b>total</b> <b>deflection</b> angle α and the Gauss-Bonnet theorem, we derive two formulas to calculate the <b>total</b> <b>deflection</b> angle α; (i) the angular formula that uses four angles determined on the optical reference geometry M^ opt or the curved (r, ϕ) subspace M^ sub being a slice of constant time t and (ii) the integral formula on the optical reference geometry M^ opt which is the areal integral of the Gaussian curvature K in the area of a quadrilateral Σ^ 4 and the line integral of the geodesic curvature κ_g along the curve C_Γ. As the curve C_Γ, we introduce the unperturbed reference line that is the null geodesic Γ on the background spacetime such as the Minkowski or the de Sitter spacetime, and is obtained by projecting Γ vertically onto the curved (r, ϕ) subspace M^ sub. We demonstrate that the two formulas give the same <b>total</b> <b>deflection</b> angle α for the Schwarzschild and the Schwarzschild [...] de Sitter spacetime. In particular, in the Schwarzschild case, the result coincides with Epstein [...] Shapiro's formula when the source S and the receiver R of the light ray are located at infinity.

The results from the theoretical calculation and numerical analysis are compared with those measured using a CCD camera and magnification lenses for a chip level microcantilever array fabricated in this study. The bimorph microcantilevers are thermally actuated by joule heating generated by a 0. 4 μm thin-film Au heater deposited on 0. 6 μm Si 3 N 4 microcantilevers. The initial deflections caused by residual stress resulting from the thermal bonding of two metallic layers with different coefficients of thermal expansion (CTEs) are additionally considered, to find the exact deflected position. The numerically calculated <b>total</b> <b>deflections</b> caused by electrical actuation show differences of 10 %, on average, with experimental measurements in the operating current region (i. e., ~ 25 mA) to prevent deterioration by overheating.

Methods: Twenty-four sound upper premolar teeth with Class II cavities were allocated to three groups (n = 8). Restoration of the teeth involved the placement of an RBC (GrandioSO) in eight oblique increments (Group A) or Groups B and C were restored to within 2 mm of the palatal cusp in a single increment with bulk-fill flowable RBC bases (SDR and x-tra base) before the two occlusal cavity increments were placed with GrandioSO. Buccal and palatal cusp deflections were recorded postirradiation using a twin channel deflection measuring gauge. Following restoration, the teeth were thermocycled, immersed in 0. 2 % basic fuchsin dye for 24 h, sectioned and examined for cervical microleakage Results: The mean <b>total</b> cuspal <b>deflection</b> for the oblique incremental restoration technique was 11. 26 (2. 56) ?m (Group A) and 4. 63 (1. 19) ?m (Group B) and 4. 73 (0. 99) ?m (Group C) for the bulk-fill flowable RBC bases.

40|$|Coronal mass ejections (CMEs) are ejections of plasma and {{magnetic}} flux from the Sun. These eruptions are large {{in size and}} they propagate over large distances in the heliosphere. If a CME is directed towards the Earth it can cause major space weather disturbances. Thus {{it is important to}} know whether a CME will hit the magnetosphere of the Earth and what kind of disturbances it could cause. CMEs contain large-scale twisted magnetic fields called flux ropes. Information about the orientation and the structure of the flux rope is crucial in determining its space weather effects. This thesis is focused on the determination of the orientation and the direction of flux rope CMEs from the corona all the way to the orbit of the Earth. An overview of a number of methods to obtain the necessary flux rope parameters both from remote sensing and in situ measurements is given. In particular, a technique combining the remote and in situ observations with a Sun-to-Earth propagation model for the CME is described in detail. In this thesis, the technique is used to study the propagation of a slow and a fast CME and the results are compared with each other and with earlier studies on the subject.

40|$|Abstract:- Pipe bends are {{critical}} components in piping systems. In {{the manufacturing process}} of pipe bends {{it is difficult to}} avoid thickening on the inner radius of the pipe bend and thinning on the outer radius of the pipe bend. The cross section of the bend also becomes non circular due to bending process; this tends to cause ovality in pipe bends. The acceptability of pipe bends is based on the induced level of shape imperfections considered. Ovality is the shape imperfection considered for the analysis which varies from 0 to 8 %. This study is an attempt to analyze the ovality effect of inlet pigtail bend, INCOLOY 800 ASTM B 407 material which is used in hydrogen reformer application. The finite element method is used to model and analyze a stand-alone, long-radius pipe bend with 42. 2 mm nominal diameter and a 250 mm bend radius with specified length. A parametric study was performed in which the bend factor is taken as 1. 90 to 2. 07. Internal pressure is incremented for each model, until it reaches 27 x 108 N/mm 2. During this process, the bend undergoes plastic instability due to pressure and thermal effect. The results are presented in the form of <b>total</b> <b>deflection</b> and stresses for the incremented internal pressure and the same is computed for various percentage of ovality.

40|$|Understanding the {{trajectory}} of a coronal mass ejection (CME), including any deflection from a radial path, and the orientation of its magnetic field is essential for space weather predictions. Kay et al. (2015 b) developed a model, Forecasting a CME's Altered Trajectory (ForeCAT), of CME deflections and rotation due to magnetic forces, not including the effects of reconnection. ForeCAT is able to reproduce the deflection of observed CMEs (Kay et al. 2015 a). The deflecting CMEs tend to show a rapid increase of their angular momentum close to the Sun, followed by little to no increase at farther distances. Here we quantify the distance at which the CME deflection is "determined," which we define as the distance after which the background solar wind has negligible influence on the <b>total</b> <b>deflection.</b> We consider a wide range in CME masses and radial speeds and determine that the deflection and rotation of these CMEs can be well-described by assuming they propagate with constant angular momentum beyond 10 Rs. The assumption of constant angular momentum beyond 10 Rs yields underestimates of the <b>total</b> <b>deflection</b> at 1 AU of only 1 % to 5 % and underestimates of the rotation of 10 %. Since the deflection from magnetic forces is determined by 10 Rs, non-magnetic forces must be responsible for any observed interplanetary deflections or rotations where the CME has increasing angular momentum.
