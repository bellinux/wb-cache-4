25|$|A {{trust is}} a three-party {{fiduciary}} relationship {{in which the}} first party, the <b>trustor</b> or settlor, transfers ("settles") a property (often but not necessarily a sum of money) upon the second party (the trustee) {{for the benefit of}} the third party, the beneficiary. At least two of the three parties must be different individuals or business entities; that is, one person can be <b>trustor</b> and trustee, and another can be the beneficiary or one can be <b>trustor</b> and beneficiary, and another be trustee or one person can be <b>trustor</b> and another can be trustee and beneficiary.|$|E
2500|$|A trustee can be {{a natural}} person, a {{business}} entity or a public body. A trust itself is a distinct entity from its trustee and, in the United States, is subject to federal and state taxation. [...] Trusts can be incorporated or formed into limited liability companies, with the business entity acting as both <b>trustor</b> and trustee.|$|E
2500|$|Living trusts, {{as opposed}} to {{testamentary}} (will) trusts, may help a <b>trustor</b> avoid probate. Avoiding probate may save costs and maintain privacy and living trusts have become very popular. Probate is potentially costly, and probate records are {{available to the public}} while distribution through a trust is private. [...] Both living trusts and wills {{can also be used to}} plan for unforeseen circumstances such as incapacity or disability, by giving discretionary powers to the trustee or executor of the will.|$|E
40|$|Rational trust {{decisions}} {{depend on}} potential outcomes {{and expectations of}} reciprocity. In the trust game, outcomes and expectations correspond to the structural factors of risk and temptation. Two experiments investigated how risk and temptation influenced information search and final decisions in the trust game. The central finding was that <b>trustors</b> underemphasized temptation relative to its effects on the expected value of trust. Instead, <b>trustors</b> made decisions egocentrically, focusing on potential outcomes. In Experiment 1, information search data revealed that <b>trustors</b> often made decisions without learning about the payoffs related to temptation. Experiment 2 investigated whether <b>trustors</b> {{were able to use}} temptation to form accurate expectations of reciprocity. <b>Trustors</b> understood, but underestimated, the relationship between temptation and the probability of reciprocity. Moreover, they did not fully consider expectations in their final trust decisions. Changes in potential outcomes had larger effects on trust than comparable changes in expectations. These results suggest that levels of trust are too high when the probability of reciprocity is low and too low when that probability is high...|$|R
30|$|Benevolence or malevolence {{is one of}} the key {{dimensions}} of trust or distrust. Benevolence is concerned with commitment and intentions of the trustee’s good will; therefore, the <b>trustor’s</b> emotional assessment of the trustee’s positive behavior takes place (Dimoka 2010). Benevolence is different from credibility, which is believed to be associated with cognitive assessment of contracts, laws, and structural assurances (Williamson 1985). On the opposite note, malevolence is associated with the <b>trustor’s</b> emotional assessment of the trustee’s negative and/or harmful behavior. Malevolence is different from discredibility, which deals with the <b>trustor’s</b> cognitive assessment of the potential loss through the trustee’s incompetence and unreliability.|$|R
40|$|We {{describe}} {{three different}} treatments of a one-shot trust experiment {{in which we}} vary the outcome considered to be fair by inducing different entitlements. Subjects obtain property rights by performing a real effort, noncompetitive working task. As expected, {{we find that the}} Trustees reciprocate significantly more the more the <b>Trustors</b> are entitled. However, our results unambiguously refute strategic reliance of the <b>Trustors</b> on the reciprocal behavior of the Trustees. Instead, the <b>Trustors</b> tend to aim at unilaterally implementing a fair outcome. Thus our observations provide strong evidence that the fairness norm is much more decisive than trust in the norm of reciprocity. (orig.)

50|$|Sociology {{acknowledges}} that the contingency of the future creates dependency between social actors, and specifically that the <b>trustor</b> becomes dependent on the trustee.

40|$|We {{test whether}} {{altruism}} {{is a significant}} confound of observed choices in the standard trust game. We allow for rich and poor trustees and examine whether, consistent with dominant altruism, <b>trustors</b> give more to the poor, or whether, consistent with dominant trust motives, <b>trustors</b> give no more to the poor than to the rich.

40|$|We {{offer new}} and clean {{evidence}} that social interactions impact on individuals’ choices. In an experimental trust game we study {{whether and how}} <b>trustor’s</b> behaviour is affected by social influence of other trustors’ choices over time. We account for three important factors of trustors’ preferences: risk attitude, generosity and expected trustworthiness. Our results confirm that <b>trustor’s</b> behaviour is affected by peers. We find a general convergence in trusting behaviour: the effect of social influence is (for most of subjects) significantly reducing the amount sent by <b>trustors</b> in each period. Furthermore, analyzing contagion within the neighbourhoods, we find that agents tend to imitate similar types ((un) -generous or (un) trusting) when placed in the same neighbourhood. Indeed – in the few neighbourhoods with a prevalence of generous and risk-loving subjects – trust substantially increases over time. Nearness, without any strategic component, is a clear element of contagion in trustors’ behaviour...|$|R
50|$|Joachim Posener {{refused to}} return to Sweden to be {{questioned}} and was sought by interpol but was never apprehended. Lord Moyne was declared bankrupt and later prosecuted along with Jisander and Mattson. Moyne was acquitted {{due to lack of}} evidence and after appeal so were also Jisander and Mattson. However Jisander was later prosecuted and convicted in 2009 for embezzlement related to <b>Trustor.</b> He is the only one to be convicted of a crime in connection with the <b>Trustor</b> Affair. There are no longer any open police investigations concerning the <b>Trustor</b> Affair as the statutes of limitations are in effect since June 2007. Smallbone was never prosecuted but was sued in a civil lawsuit by <b>Trustor</b> but this was later abandoned. Separate lawsuits were issued against Jisander, Moyne and Posener. <b>Trustor</b> also started a court case in 1999 against Barclay's Bank for their part in the irregularities.|$|E
5000|$|In {{a social}} context, trust has several connotations. Definitions of trust {{typically}} {{refer to a}} situation characterized by the following aspects: One party (<b>trustor)</b> is willing {{to rely on the}} actions of another party (trustee); the situation is directed to the future. In addition, the <b>trustor</b> (voluntarily or forcedly) abandons control over the actions performed by the trustee. As a consequence, the <b>trustor</b> is uncertain about the outcome of the other's actions; they can only develop and evaluate expectations. The uncertainty involves the risk of failure or harm to the <b>trustor</b> if the trustee will not behave as desired. Vladimir Ilych Lenin expressed this idea with the sentence [...] "Trust is good, control is better".|$|E

It argued that Smallbone's company was a sham to help breaches of duty, it had been involved in improper acts and the interests of justice demanded the result.

40|$|Abstract Members of {{organizations}} are {{often called upon}} to trust others and to recip-rocate trust {{while at the same time}} competing for bonuses or promotions. We suggest that competition affects trust not only within dyads including direct competitors, but also between individuals who do not compete against each other. We test this idea in a trust game where <b>trustors</b> and trustees are rewarded based either on their ab-solute performance or on how well they do relative to players from other dyads. In Experiment 1, we show that competition among <b>trustors</b> significantly increases trust. Competition among trustees decreases trustworthiness, but <b>trustors</b> do not anticipate this effect. In Experiment 2, we additionally show that the increase in trust under competition is caused by a combination of increased risk taking and lower sensitivity to non-financial concerns specific to trust interactions. Our results suggest that tour-nament incentives might have a “blinding effect ” on considerations such as betrayal and inequality aversion...|$|R
40|$|Interpersonal {{trust is}} a one-sided social dilemma. Building on the binary trust game, we ask how trust and {{trustworthiness}} can evolve {{in a population}} where partners are matched randomly and agents sometimes act as <b>trustors</b> and sometimes as trustees. <b>Trustors</b> {{have the option to}} costly check a trustee's last action and to condition their behavior on the signal they receive. We show that the resulting population game admits two components of Nash equilibria. Nevertheless, the long-run outcome of an evolutionary social learning process modeled by the best response dynamics is unique. Even if unconditional distrust initially abounds, the trustors' checking option leads trustees to build a reputation for trustworthiness by honoring trust. This invites free-riders among the <b>trustors</b> who save the costs of checking and trust blindly, until it does no longer pay for trustees to behave in a trustworthy manner. This results in cyclical convergence to a mixed equilibrium with behavioral heterogeneity where suspicious checking and blind trusting coexist while unconditional distrust vanishes.

50|$|In social {{sciences}} and in information technology, <b>trustor</b> (alt. truster in e.g.) is an entity that trusts the other entity (the trustee). <b>Trustor</b> may be a social agent (such as a person or an institution) or a technical agent (such as a computer or a software application), {{acting on behalf of}} a social agent.|$|E
40|$|Social {{relations}} {{through which}} information disseminates promote efficiency {{in social and}} economic interactions that are characterized by problems of trust. This provides incentives for rational actors to invest in their relations. In this article, we study a game-theoretic model in which two <b>trustors</b> interact repeatedly with the same trustee and decide, {{at the beginning of}} the game, whether to invest in establishing an information exchange relation between one another. We show that the costs the <b>trustors</b> are willing to bear for establishing the relation vary in a non-monotonic way with the severity of the trust problem. The willingness to invest in the information exchange relation is high particularly for trust problems that are neither too small nor too severe...|$|R
30|$|On the {{opposite}} note, distrust {{is defined as}} “the buyer’s unwillingness to be vulnerable to a seller {{on the basis that}} the seller will be inept, exhibit reckless behavior, violate obligations, not care about the buyer’s welfare, act against the buyer’s interests, even intend to harm the buyer” (Dimoka 2010, p. 376). Distrust, too, is found to have two distinct dimensions—discredibility and malevolence (Dimoka 2010). Discredibility refers to “the <b>trustor’s</b> assessment of the potential of loss due to the trustees’ incompetence, dishonesty, and unreliability,” while malevolence refers to “the <b>trustor’s</b> fear that the trustee will not act in his or her best interests” (Dimoka 2010, p. 378). Particularly, distrust due to malevolence indicates a concern that the trustee will engage in a harmful behavior with ill intention (Pavlou & Dimoka 2006).|$|R
40|$|Prior meta-analytic {{evidence}} has indicated no association between relationship length and perceived trustworthiness. Viewing <b>trustors</b> as information processors, the authors propose {{a model in}} which relationship length, although having no direct effect on perceived trustworthiness, moderates the association between perceived trustworthiness and the basis on which people decide to trust each other. Specifically, as <b>trustors</b> learn about others, they base their trust on different kinds of information (demographic similarity, trustworthy behavior, and shared perspective). Hierarchical multiple regression analyses of a field survey of supervisors and subordinates from 3 companies (N 88) provide evidence consistent with this prediction: Perceived trustworthiness is associated with demographic similarity in newer relationships, with trustworthy behavior in relationships that are neither brand new nor old but in-between, and with shared perspective in older relationships...|$|R

In all conditions, <b>trustors</b> earn more when they invest more of their endowment, <b>trustors</b> and trustees gravitate to "fair and efficient" interactions, and the majority of trustees adhere to their commitments, whether explicit or implicit.

40|$|Behavioral {{economists have}} come to {{recognize}} that reciprocity, the interaction of trust and trustworthiness, is a distinct and economically relevant component of individual preferences alongside selfishness and altruism. This recognition is principally due to observed decisions in laboratory “trust games”. However, recent research suggests that altruism may explain much of what “looks like ” trust in such experiments. We formally derive discriminatory tests for altruism and trust based on withintreatment and within-subject comparisons, and we control for group attributes of experimental subjects. The central idea is to allow for rich and poor trustees, and to examine whether, consistent with dominant altruism, <b>trustors</b> give more to the poor, or whether, consistent with dominant reciprocity motives, <b>trustors</b> give no more to the poor than to the rich. Our results support trust as the dominant motivation for “trust like ” decisions, with at most a subsidiary role for altruism. JEL classification: Keywords...|$|R
