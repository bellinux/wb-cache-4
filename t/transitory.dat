5|$|Ant colonies can be long-lived. The queens {{can live}} {{for up to}} 30years, and workers live from 1 to 3years. Males, however, are more <b>transitory,</b> being quite {{short-lived}} and surviving {{for only a few}} weeks. Ant queens are estimated to live 100 times as long as solitary insects of a similar size.|$|E
5|$|Indium metal {{does not}} react with water, {{but it is}} {{oxidized}} by stronger oxidizing agents such as halogens to give indium(III) compounds. It does not form a boride, silicide, or carbide, and the hydride InH3 has at best a <b>transitory</b> existence in ethereal solutions at low temperatures, being unstable enough to spontaneously polymerize without coordination. Indium is rather basic in aqueous solution, showing only slight amphoteric characteristics, and unlike its lighter homologs aluminium and gallium, it is insoluble in aqueous alkaline solutions.|$|E
5|$|The {{song was}} {{composed}} during a <b>transitory</b> time in musical history when songs {{first began to}} be recorded for the phonograph. It was among the earliest pieces of popular music to be recorded. Dresser's inability to control the distribution of phonograph cylinders led him and his company to join other composers to petition the United States Congress to expand federal copyright protections over the new technology.|$|E
5|$|The story centres on Bond's {{investigation}} of a diamond-smuggling ring originating in the mines of Sierra Leone and ends in Las Vegas. Along the way Bond meets and {{falls in love with}} {{one of the members of}} the smuggling gang, Tiffany Case. Much of Fleming's background research formed the basis for his non-fiction 1957 book The Diamond Smugglers. Diamonds Are Forever deals with international travel, marriage and the <b>transitory</b> nature of life.|$|E
5|$|During 1935, {{he began}} {{work for the}} National Resources Planning Board, which was then working on a large {{consumer}} budget survey. Ideas from this project later {{became a part of}} his Theory of the Consumption Function. Friedman began employment with the National Bureau of Economic Research during autumn 1937 to assist Simon Kuznets in his work on professional income. This work resulted in their jointly authored publication Incomes from Independent Professional Practice, which introduced the concepts of permanent and <b>transitory</b> income, a major component of the Permanent Income Hypothesis that Friedman worked out in greater detail in the 1950s. The book hypothesizes that professional licensing artificially restricts the supply of services and raises prices.|$|E
5|$|Evans {{sought to}} promote a form of nativist, Protestant nationalism. In {{addition}} to his white supremacist ideology, he fiercely condemned Catholicism, unionism, and communism, which were associated with recent immigrants from eastern and southern Europe. He argued that Jews formed a non-American culture and resisted assimilation, although he denied being an anti-Semite. Historians credit Evans with refocusing the Klan on political activities and recruiting outside the Southern United States; the Klan grew most in the Midwest and industrial cities. However, they note that the political influence and membership gains he sought were <b>transitory.</b> Some commentators argue that Evans was more focused on money and power than any particular ideology.|$|E
5|$|In a 1989 {{review of}} the {{research}} on juvenile delinquency and violence, Lisabeth DiLalla and Gottesman found delinquency could be <b>transitory</b> or continuous, and genes contributed more to the continuous type. In 1991 the same authors published a critique of the then-prevalent idea of antisocial behavior being transmitted through generations by child abuse alone in antisocial families. They stated that a review by Cathy Spatz Widom and the studies she cited had missed an element: children maltreated in families might have been targets because their genes might have influenced them into committing antisocial acts and attracting such treatment from parents.|$|E
5|$|Minton's time on {{the court}} {{marked the end of}} a <b>transitory</b> period in the judiciary. Since Minton, justices have tended to serve {{increasingly}} longer terms on the court, which has had strong political science implications on the Supreme Court. The growing concept of judicial non-partisanship became the norm in American politics after Minton—he was the last member of Congress of be appointed to the court. Linda Gugin and Professor James St. Clair have noted that the federal courts have lost a valuable point of view by not having experienced legislators among their ranks.|$|E
5|$|Most World War I war {{designers}} {{attempted to}} produce memorials that were, as cultural historian Jay Winter describes, noble, uplifting, tragic and endurably sad. There were various architectural styles used on memorials, {{but most were}} essentially conservative in nature, typically embracing well established styles such as classicism and embracing mainstream Christian symbolism. This conservatism in part resulted from the age and background of the committees that were commissioning the memorials, and also from a sense that established architectural styles, rather a potentially more <b>transitory</b> but fashionable style, would be more enduring and appropriate.|$|E
5|$|One day god Indra of {{the first}} heaven {{arranged}} a dance by celestial dancers in the assembly hall of Rishabhanatha. One of the dancers was Nilanjana. While {{in the midst of}} a series of vigorous dance movements, she died. The sudden death of Nilanjana reminded Rishabhanatha of the world's <b>transitory</b> nature, triggering him to renounce his kingdom along with his family and material wealth. He gave his kingdom to his hundred sons, of whom Bharata got the city of Vinita (Ayodhya) and Bahubali got the city of Podanapur (Taxila). He became an ascetic on the ninth day of the month of Chaitra Krishna (Hindu calendar). According to Jain mythologies, he practiced severe austerities for 1,000 years, then gained enlightenment, became a Jina.|$|E
5|$|SR78 {{was one of}} the {{original}} state highways designated in 1934, although portions of the route existed as early as 1900. However, it was not designated east of Brawley until 1959. The freeway section in the North County of San Diego that connects Oceanside and Escondido was built {{in the middle of the}} twentieth century in several stages, including a <b>transitory</b> stage known as the Vista Way Freeway, and has been improved several times. An expressway bypass of the city of Brawley was completed in 2012. There are many projects slated to improve the freeway due to increasing congestion in the region.|$|E
5|$|The {{main entry}} {{gate to the}} tomb is two-storied and its façade has very {{elaborate}} ornamentation over plastered surfaces and is in ornate purple colour. There is an inscription in Arabic {{on the surface and}} its translation reads “When the hero of plain bravery departs from the <b>transitory,</b> may he become a resident of god’s paradise”. The rear side of the façade, which is seen after entering through the gate, has many rooms and the library. To the right of the gate is the mosque which is a three-domed structure marked with stripes.|$|E
5|$|The mutual {{attraction}} {{between individual}} insects continues into adulthood, {{and they continue}} to act as a cohesive group. Individuals that get detached from a swarm fly back into the mass. Others that get left behind after feeding, take off to rejoin the swarm when it passes overhead. When individuals {{at the front of the}} swarm settle to feed, others fly past overhead and settle in their turn, the whole swarm acting like a rolling unit with an ever-changing leading edge. The locusts spend much time on the ground feeding and resting, moving on when the vegetation is exhausted. They may then fly a considerable distance before settling in a location where <b>transitory</b> rainfall has caused a green flush of new growth.|$|E
5|$|According to Jain {{traditional}} accounts, he {{was born}} to King Nabhi and Queen Marudevi in north Indian city of Ayodhya, also called Vinita. He had two wives, Sunanda and Sumangala. Sumangala is described {{as the mother of}} his ninety-nine sons (including Bharata) and one daughter, Brahmi. Sunanda is depicted as the mother of Bahubali and Sundari. The sudden death of Nilanjana, one of the dancers of Indra, reminded him of the world's <b>transitory</b> nature and he developed a desire for renunciation. After renouncing, the Jain legends state he wandered without food for a whole year. The day on which he got his first ahara (food), is celebrated as Akshaya Tritiya by Jains. He is said to have attained Moksha on Mount Kailash. The text Adi Purana by Jinasena is an account of the events of his life. His iconography includes colossal statues such as Statue of Ahimsa, Bawangaja and those erected in Gopachal hill. His icons include the eponymous bull as his emblem, the Nyagrodha tree, Gomukha (bull-faced) Yaksha, and Chakreshvari Yakshi.|$|E
5|$|All the same, between 1853 and the 1930s, fiscal {{instability}} was a <b>transitory</b> phenomenon. The depressions of 1873–77 and 1890–91 {{played a}} crucial role in fostering the rise of industry: timidly in the 1870s and more decisively in the 1890s, industry grew with each crisis in response to the need of a damaged economy to improve its trade balance through import-substitution. By 1914, about 15% the Argentine labour force was involved in manufacturing, compared to 20% involved in commercial activities. In 1913, the country's income per head was on a par with that of France and Germany, and far ahead of Italy's or Spain's. At the end of 1913, Argentina had a gold stock of £59 million, or 3.7% of the world's monetary gold, while representing 1.2% of the world's economic output.|$|E

25|$|Food {{stability}} {{refers to}} the ability to obtain food over time. Food insecurity can be <b>transitory,</b> seasonal, or chronic. In <b>transitory</b> food insecurity, food may be unavailable during certain periods of time. At the food production level, natural disasters and drought result in crop failure and decreased food availability. Civil conflicts can also decrease access to food. Instability in markets resulting in food-price spikes can cause <b>transitory</b> food insecurity. Other factors that can temporarily cause food insecurity are loss of employment or productivity, which can be caused by illness. Seasonal food insecurity can result from the regular pattern of growing seasons in food production.|$|E

25|$|The Šiška Cultural Quarter hosts {{a number}} of art groups and {{cultural}} organisations dedicated to contemporary and avant-garde arts. Part of it is also Kino Šiška Center for Urban Culture, a venue where music concerts of indie, punk, and rock bands as well as exhibitions take place. Museum of <b>Transitory</b> Art (MoTA) is a museum without a permanent collection or a fixed space. Instead, its programs are realised in different locations and contexts in temporary physical and virtual spaces dedicated to advancing the research, production and presentation of <b>transitory,</b> experimental, and live art forms. Yearly MoTA organizes Sonica Festival. Ljudmila (since 1994) strives to connect research practices, technologies, science, and art.|$|E
25|$|The Ertebølle {{population}} derived its {{living from}} a variety of means, but chiefly from the sea. They prospered, grew healthy and multiplied on a diet of fish. They were masters of the inland waters, which they traversed in paddled dugouts. Like many peoples known in history, they were able to hunt whales and seals from their dugouts. Their materials were mainly wood, with bone, antler and flint for functions requiring harder surfaces. Homes were constructed of brush or light wood. The materials encourage us to view them as <b>transitory.</b> They were, nevertheless, able to place the dead in longer-used cemeteries. Perhaps the dwelling-places were <b>transitory,</b> but the territories were not.|$|E
25|$|The IPCC AR4 says {{explosive}} volcanic {{events are}} episodic, but the stratospheric aerosols resulting from them yield substantial <b>transitory</b> perturbations to the radiative energy {{balance of the}} planet, with both shortwave and longwave effects sensitive to the microphysical characteristics of the aerosols.|$|E

Other considerations include cost, constructability, safety, aesthetics and sustainability.|$|E
25|$|Human complexities, like {{reason and}} cognition, can produce {{well-being}} or happiness, but such form is limited and <b>transitory.</b> In temporal life, {{the contemplation of}} God, the infinitely Beautiful, is the supreme delight of the will.

25|$|During thelarche, the {{developing}} breasts are sometimes of unequal size, and usually the left breast is slightly larger. This condition of asymmetry is <b>transitory</b> and statistically normal in female {{physical and sexual}} development. Medical conditions can cause overdevelopment (e.g., virginal breast hypertrophy, macromastia) or underdevelopment (e.g., tuberous breast deformity, micromastia) in girls and women.|$|E
25|$|Like velcro, {{carbohydrate}} ligands on the circulating leukocytes bind to selectin molecules on {{the inner}} wall of the vessel, with marginal affinity. This causes the leukocytes {{to slow down and}} begin rolling along the inner surface of the vessel wall.
