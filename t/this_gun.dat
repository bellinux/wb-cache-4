5|$|<b>This</b> <b>gun</b> was {{retrofitted}} into German and Dutch Leopard 2s, and {{chosen as}} the main gun of the Spanish Leopard 2E and the Greek Leopard 2HEL. It was tested on the British Challenger 2 as a potential replacement for its current weapon, the rifled L30 120mm cannon.|$|E
5|$|The NGS deemed <b>this</b> <b>gun</b> {{obsolete}} {{shortly after}} the first ships were laid down, but the gun that it wanted to use, the Canon de 138 mm modèle 1923, was not yet available, so they planned to replace the 130mm guns later. The guns and their larger hoists were ordered well before any of the ships were completed {{and had to be}} written off when it became apparent that the ships' stability was too marginal to tolerate the additional top weight.|$|E

5|$|Another crucial {{literary}} {{source for}} film noir was W. R. Burnett, whose first novel {{to be published}} was Little Caesar, in 1929. It {{was turned into a}} hit for Warner Bros. in 1931; the following year, Burnett was hired to write dialogue for Scarface, while The Beast of the City (1932) was adapted from one of his stories. At least one important reference work identifies the latter as a film noir despite its early date. Burnett's characteristic narrative approach fell somewhere between that of the quintessential hardboiled writers and their noir fiction compatriots—his protagonists were often heroic in their own way, which happened to be that of the gangster. During the classic era, his work, either as author or screenwriter, was the basis for seven films now widely regarded as films noir, including three of the most famous: High Sierra (1941), <b>This</b> <b>Gun</b> for Hire (1942), and The Asphalt Jungle (1950).|$|E
5|$|The German {{artillery}} bombardment was heaviest in {{the sector}} {{held by the}} right company of the 47th Battalion and the 2nd Tyneside Pioneers {{on either side of}} the railway bridge northwest of Dernancourt. I/230 RIR had barely been able to reach its jumping off point in time, and fell behind its barrage. It advanced through the British barrage south of Dernancourt and quickly moved through the village, with part of the battalion reaching the railway embankment. About 09:30, the German shelling in the sector near the bridge lessened. The commander of the right section of the 12th Machine Gun Company, stationed near the bridge with the 2nd Tyneside Pioneers, climbed up the embankment and looking over the rails, saw a number of German bayonets sticking up on the other side. After a quick discussion with the ranking officer of the pioneers in that area, it was decided they would attack immediately. Charging across the railway line, they pushed the German force back far enough to bring one of the Vickers guns into action. The fire from <b>this</b> <b>gun</b> drove the Germans of I/230 RIR back as far as Dernancourt. Before this counter-attack was launched, Foord, feeling his position to be insecure, requested reinforcement. Two companies of Highland Light Infantry were sent forward from the 106th Brigade support line, arriving around the time of the counter-attack, although they suffered significant casualties as they moved down the exposed slope. II and III/230 RIR were unable to get through Dernancourt to reinforce I/230 RIR, due to a tremendous British bombardment that fell on the village as they approached. They sought shelter in the cellars of the village. Any troops that attempted to cross the open ground between the village and the railway were shot down.|$|E

5000|$|In 1927 Vollmer also {{obtained}} a patent covering the breech {{mechanism of the}} weapon. [...] Later on, Vollmer co-developed the gun with Mauser Werke as the MV 31 (Mauser-Vollmer 1931). It was offered to the German ordnance board (Inspektion für Waffen und Gerät - IWG) but, after testing, it was not adopted for service. <b>This</b> <b>guns</b> had a quick-change barrel and used a drum magazine.|$|R

40|$|A newly {{designed}} cross electrode-type plasma spray gun, which can inject the spraying materials into the arc column, has been developed. In order {{to demonstrate the}} application feasibility of <b>this</b> spray <b>gun</b> to formation of Ti-Al functionally graded coatings, the performance characteristics of <b>this</b> spray <b>gun</b> and the structure and composition of formatted coatings were investigated. It was clarified that <b>this</b> spray <b>gun</b> was operated stably during spraying, jet power was easily controlled by arc current and the high quality Ti-Al functionally graded coatings was formatted under the following conditions: the jet power of over 7 kW and Ti powder diameter distribution of 54 - 63 μm.

25|$|Over {{the period}} of gunnery trials {{continued}} between 1927 and 1930, thirteen reports of structural damage were filed, indicating that there remained problems with absorbing the blast and recoil of the guns.
