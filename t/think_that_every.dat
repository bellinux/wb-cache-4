25|$|Those who are {{suffering}} most keenly, and who have lost most, either of their children by death or their possessions by fire and sword, such as those reconcentrated women in the camps, have the most conspicuous patience, and never express a wish that their men should {{be the ones to}} give way. It must be fought out now, they think, to the bitter end. It is a very costly business upon which England has embarked, and even at such a cost hardly the barest necessities can be provided, and no comforts. It is so strange to <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>every</b> tent contains a family, and every family is in trouble–loss behind, poverty in front, sickness, privation and death in the present. But they are very good, and say they have agreed to be cheerful and {{make the best of it}} all. The Mafeking camp folk were very surprised to hear that English women cared a rap about them or their suffering. It has done them a lot of good to hear that real sympathy is felt for them at home, and so I am glad I fought my way here, if only for that reason.|$|E
500|$|Swift's friend, Anderson, portrayed {{herself in}} the video. The love {{interests}} of both Swift and Anderson were cast by Swift after she received images of them via e-mail. The video was filmed in two days. The first day consisted of actors, including Swift and Anderson, filming before a green screen. On the set, White presented Swift with caricature drawings depicting the music video, in order to guide herself. Swift was impressed by Anderson's acting skills, considering her lack of experience, and called it [...] "prolific". On the second day, scenes {{at a high school}} were filmed; artificial rain was made. Afterward, White and a team of visual effect artists created the setting. [...] "If you watch just the offline edit of this video, it's just green. It's just Taylor walking around a giant green screen. And to <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>every</b> single thing in that video was created is amazing, 'cause a lot of people worked really hard on it", White said. The visual effects team were at work for the video for some time, sometimes staying overnight in the office to produce the video. The direction was to make the video seem [...] "magical". Some of the props used when filming were recreated using digital animation, such as the door and the desks. Because extras were filmed separately, White was meticulous to find the right shots to make the scene more cohesive. White believed the finished product had a sense of innocence.|$|E
2500|$|In May 2005, two Conservative MPs were photographed posing with {{a poster}} from the Western Standard {{with the title}} [...] "The Liberano$", {{comparing}} the Liberal Party to the mafia television show The Sopranos. [...] The poster was sparked by accusations made against the Liberal Party during the federal sponsorship scandal of 2004–05. [...] Volpe argued that the poster was offensive to Canadians of Italian heritage, and commented [...] "These are the same Conservatives who <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>every</b> immigrant is a potential terrorist and criminal and everything else", and [...] "Notwithstanding that they don't have their cowl and their cape, the Klan looks like they're still very much alive." [...] The Conservative Party demanded an apology from Volpe, who acknowledged that his words [...] "might {{have been a little}} intemperate" [...] because of what he interpreted as a [...] "racial slur".|$|E

6000|$|... "Yes, he's quite ornamental," [...] agreed Miss Cornelia. [...] "Oh, and VERY ladylike. And he <b>thinks</b> <b>that</b> <b>every</b> {{girl who}} looks at him {{falls in love with}} him--as if a Methodist minister, {{wandering}} about like any Jew, was such a prize! If you and the young doctor take MY advice, you won't {{have much to do with}} the Methodists. My motto is--if you ARE a Presbyterian, BE a Presbyterian." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, if {{they feel}} they have {{capabilities}} for higher things. Then she <b>thinks</b> <b>that</b> <b>every</b> woman who has leisure should take up the study of some branch of science, and that, as far as possible, every woman should qualify herself for some trade or profession, choosing for preference those which have been hitherto monopolized by men. To enter the others would only be to intensify the present competition." ...|$|R

5000|$|Personality: Lisa is {{the oldest}} of the three but the newest rider; she begins in #1, Horse Crazy because her mother <b>thinks</b> <b>that</b> <b>every</b> young lady should know {{something}} about horses. She is extremely organized, a straight-A student, and a perfectionist. Although stable owner, Max, often tells her that she has potential, her desire to [...] "catch up" [...] to Carole and Stevie is an element of most of the series. Lisa is shorter than Carole and Stevie.|$|R

5000|$|On {{the other}} hand, {{there are some}} {{teachers}} who want to carry a firearm to protect their students. Kasey Hansen, a special needs teacher in Utah <b>thinks</b> <b>that</b> <b>every</b> teacher should carry. She says, [...] "We are {{the first line of}} defense. Someone is going to call the cops {{and they are going to}} be informed, but how long is it going to take for them to get to the school? And in that time how many students are going to be affected by the gunman roaming the halls?" ...|$|R

50|$|Isabel Cordero (Elizabeth Álvarez) is an unlucky in love {{architect}} who lost {{the love of}} her life, Rubén (Alejandro Nones), when she was 18 years old because of her controlling father, Leopoldo (Alfonso Iturralde) who left his wife to start a relationship with Isabel's godmother. For this reason, Isabel's mother, Sara (Silvia Mariscal) loses her mind for a while and is admitted to a psychiatric medical institution. Isabel believes that she is cursed. She <b>thinks</b> <b>that</b> <b>every</b> man who falls in love with her will suffer for it. She thinks she will never succeed in love and be happy, until she meets Fernando Lobo (Diego Olivera).|$|R

40|$|In this article, {{originally}} published on «Foreign Affairs» in 1949, Reinhold Niebuhr argued a tough criticism against some scholars and politicians that have suggested {{the possibility of}} World Government. Though tecnics have established a rudimentary world community, they have not integrated the international system organically, morally or politically. Niebuhr <b>thinks</b> <b>that</b> <b>every</b> community needs a rooted social tissue, while the anarchical interntional system lacks it. Indeed the forces – as the mutual fear of nuclear annihilation and the increasing economic interdependence – which were operating to integrate the world community, were limited. According to the protestant theologian, there is no viable constitutional {{solution to the problem}} of international order. To achieve peace and justice in the world community states can only go beyond their national interest...|$|R
6000|$|... ‘Nay, I {{sometimes}} <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>every</b> one has had {{his share}} of it but me,’ was the reply. ‘All England hath paid his taxes with my patrimony: I was a sheep that left my wool on every briar.’ ...|$|E

'For really I <b>think</b> <b>that</b> {{the poorest}} he {{that is in}} England have a life to live, as the {{greatest}} he: and therefore truly, sir, I <b>think</b> it's clear, <b>that</b> <b>every</b> man <b>that</b> is to live under a government ought first by his own consent to put himself under that government.' ...|$|R

6000|$|Do you <b>think,</b> Gentlemen, <b>that</b> <b>every</b> public {{act in the}} {{six years}} since I stood in this place before you, that all the arduous things which {{have been done in}} this eventful period which has crowded into a few years' space the {{revolutions}} of an age, can be opened to you on their fair grounds in half an hour's conversation? ...|$|R

6000|$|Mr. Waddington {{shook his}} head sorrowfully. [...] "I've had a private detective now working ever since that day," [...] he declared. [...] "The man thinks me, of course, a sort of lunatic, but I have made it worth his while to find it. I should <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>every</b> child in the {{neighborhood}} has been interviewed. What about the novel?" ...|$|E
60|$|It {{may seem}} {{difficult}} to believe that fifty bullets could fall in a camp, only 100 yards square--crowded with animals and men--without any other result than to hit a single mule in the tail. Such was, however, the fact. This shows of what value, a little active service is to the soldier. The first time he is under fire, he imagines himself to be in great danger. He <b>thinks</b> <b>that</b> <b>every</b> bullet is going to hit him, and <b>that</b> <b>every</b> shot is aimed at him. Assuredly he will be killed in a moment. If he goes through this ordeal once or twice, he begins to get some idea of the odds in his favour. He has heard lots of bullets and they have not hurt him. He will get home safely to his tea this evening, just as he did the last time. He becomes a very much more effective fighting machine.|$|R
6000|$|... "For {{the love}} of all saints and of England, do not <b>think</b> of avenging <b>that!</b> <b>Every</b> man must now put away old grudges, and {{remember}} that he has but one foe,--William and his Frenchmen." ...|$|R
60|$|Kookooskoos {{is always}} {{catching}} the wrong rat. The {{reason is that}} he is a great hunter, and <b>thinks</b> <b>that</b> <b>every</b> furry thing which moves must be game; and so he is like the fool sportsman who shoots at a sound, or a motion in the bushes, before finding out what makes it. Sometimes the rat {{turns out to be a}} skunk, or a weasel; sometimes your pet cat; and, once in a lifetime, it is your own fur cap, or even your head; and then you feel the weight and the edge of Kookooskoos' claws. But he never learns wisdom by mistakes; for, spite of his grave appearance, he is excitable as a Frenchman; and so, whenever anything stirs in the bushes and a bit of fur appears, he cries out to himself, A rat, Kookoo! a rabbit! and swoops on the instant.|$|R
6000|$|... "God bless my soul!" [...] said Mr. Damer, again. It {{often does}} strike an old gentleman as very odd that any man should {{fall in love}} with his daughter, whom he has not ceased to look upon as a child. The case is {{generally}} quite different with mothers. They seem to <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>every</b> young man must {{fall in love with}} their girls.|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{is not a}} pose at all," [...] Jeanne {{answered}} calmly. [...] "I do {{not want}} to be cynical, and I {{do not want to}} have unkind thoughts. But tell me, Lord Ronald, honestly, do you <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>every</b> one would have been as kind to a girl just out of boarding-school as they have been to me if it were not that I have so much money?" ...|$|E
6000|$|Jack. [Moving to {{sofa and}} {{kneeling}} upon it.] My dear fellow, {{what on earth}} is there in that? Some aunts are tall, some aunts are not tall. That is a matter that surely an aunt may be allowed to decide for herself. You seem to <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>every</b> aunt should be exactly like your aunt! That is absurd! For Heaven's sake give me back my cigarette case. [Follows Algernon round the room.] ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh," [...] said I poisonously, [...] "so {{you don't}} <b>think</b> <b>that</b> to cheat the blackguard, {{as you call}} him, at the last moment--and please don't suppose I have {{forgotten}} what you have called other friends of mine--you don't <b>think</b> <b>that</b> to break <b>every</b> promise I have made wouldn't be wallowing worse than---- Oh, {{thank you for the}} wallowing, I shall remember that." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I saw such {{a frenzy}} once before, but, of course, {{only in a}} small band of savages. Many times have I seen Indians {{preparing}} for the war-path, in search of both white men and redskins. They were fierce then, but nothing like this. Every one of these frenzied fiends is honest. <b>Think</b> of <b>that!</b> <b>Every</b> man feels it his duty to murder these Christians. Girty has led up to this by cunning, and now the time is come to let them loose." ...|$|R
6000|$|Nothing {{but this}} tedious Introduction, wherein he supposes {{it all along}} as a thing granted. That {{there might be a}} perfect union in the whole Christian Church, is a blessing which every good man wishes, but no {{reasonable}} man can hope. That the more polite Roman Catholics have in several places given up some of their superstitious fopperies, particularly concerning legends, relics, and the like, is what nobody denies. But the material points in difference between us and them are universally retained and asserted, in all their controversial writings. And if his Lordship really <b>thinks</b> <b>that</b> <b>every</b> man who differs from him, under the name of a Tory in some church and state opinions, is ready to believe transubstantiation, purgatory, the infallibility of pope or councils, to worship saints and angels, and the like; I can only pray God to enlighten his understanding, or graft in his heart the first principles of charity; a virtue which some people ought not by any means wholly to renounce, [...] "because it covers a multitude of sins." ...|$|R
