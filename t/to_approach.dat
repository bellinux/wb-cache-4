5|$|A {{variety of}} marine animals possess active {{camouflage}} through {{their ability to}} change colour rapidly. Several bottom-living fish such as the flounder can hide themselves effectively against a variety of backgrounds. Many cephalopods including octopus, cuttlefish, and squid similarly use colour change, in their case both for camouflage and signalling. For example, the big blue octopus, Octopus cyanea, hunts during the day, and can match itself to the colours and textures of its surroundings, both to avoid predators and to enable it <b>to</b> <b>approach</b> prey. It can perfectly resemble a rock or a coral it is hiding beside. When necessary, in order to scare away a potential predator, it can display markings which resemble eyes.|$|E

Before returning to Alaska, Bear made a final attempt to reach Herald Island; ice limited their approach to , and they saw no signs of life. The reunited party arrived at Nome on 13 September, to a great welcome from the local population.|$|E

5|$|After {{weakening}} into {{a remnant}} low, Felicia continued <b>to</b> <b>approach</b> the Hawaiian Islands and on August12, the system produced copious amounts of rainfall across several islands. The highest total was recorded on Oahu at , causing isolated mudslides and flooding. In Maui, the heavy rains helped to alleviate drought conditions and water shortages, significantly increasing the total water across the island's reservoirs. In addition, river flooding {{resulted in the}} closure of one school and large swells produced by the storm resulted in several lifeguard rescues at island beaches. In all, only minor impacts were caused by the remnants of Felicia.|$|E

In general aggressive resemblance, the predator or parasite blends in with the background, for example when a leopard is hard to see in long grass.|$|E

5|$|An infant with an anxious-avoidant {{pattern of}} {{attachment}} will avoid or ignore the caregiver—showing little emotion when the caregiver departs or returns. The infant will not explore very much {{regardless of who}} is there. Infants classified as anxious-avoidant (A) represented a puzzle in the early 1970s. They did not exhibit distress on separation, and either ignored the caregiver on their return (A1 subtype) or showed some tendency <b>to</b> <b>approach</b> together with some tendency to ignore or {{turn away from the}} caregiver (A2 subtype). Ainsworth and Bell theorized that the apparently unruffled behaviour of the avoidant infants was in fact a mask for distress, a hypothesis later evidenced through studies of the heart-rate of avoidant infants.|$|E
