5|$|The first {{spacecraft}} to traverse {{the asteroid belt}} was Pioneer 10, which entered the region on 16 July 1972. At the time there was some concern that the debris in the belt would pose a hazard to the spacecraft, but it has since been safely traversed by 12 spacecraft without incident. Pioneer 11, Voyagers 1 and 2 and Ulysses passed through the belt without imaging any asteroids. Galileo imaged 951 Gaspra in 1991 and 243 Ida in 1993, NEAR imaged 253 Mathilde in 1997, Cassini imaged 2685 Masursky in 2000, Stardust imaged 5535 Annefrank in 2002, New Horizons imaged 132524 APL in 2006, Rosetta imaged 2867 Šteins in September 2008 and 21 Lutetia in July 2010, and Dawn orbited Vesta between July 2011 and September 2012 and has orbited Ceres since March 2015. On its way to Jupiter, Juno traversed the asteroid belt without collecting science data. Due to the low density of materials within the belt, <b>the</b> <b>odds</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> probe running into an asteroid are now estimated at less than one in a billion.|$|E

2500|$|In the US, several {{politicians}} in the Republican Party have advanced claims that pregnancy from rape is rare.

[...] In 1998, Arkansas state senator Fay Boozman lost a campaign for a US Senate seat after remarking that fear-induced hormonal changes made rape victims unlikely to become pregnant. He later apologized and eventually called the claim a mistake, but the controversy was renewed in 1999 when he was appointed director of the Arkansas Department of Health by then-governor Mike Huckabee. During his campaign in the United States Senate election in Missouri, 2012, US Representative Todd Akin commented on abortion exceptions for rape victims: [...] "I understand from doctors, that's really rare. If it's a legitimate rape, the female body has ways to try to shut that whole thing down." [...] The comment was widely criticized, and Akin apologized, saying he [...] "misspoke". Akin's suggestion that rape is unlikely to result in pregnancy was defended by some prominent individuals and groups which oppose legal abortion. A SurveyUSA poll one day after Akin's comments reported that 76% of Missouri adults disagreed with Akin, 13% [...] agreed with the statement and 11% were unsure (±3.8%).|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVES: We {{investigated}} {{the effects of}} the density of specialists and of the area-level percentage of highly educated individuals on <b>the</b> <b>odds</b> <b>of</b> consulting <b>a</b> specialist, and examined whether these variables could explain the observed urban/rural contrast in utilization of specialty care. STUDY DESIGN: The study sample, representative of the French population aged 18 - 75 years in 1999, comprised 12, 435 individuals. METHODS: Multilevel logistic models allowed us to investigate predictors <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>odds</b> <b>of</b> consulting <b>a</b> specialist occasionally, regularly and frequently over the previous 12 months. RESULTS: We observed a modest but significant clustering within areas of the utilization of specialty care, with higher levels of clustering for behaviours representing heavy consumption of care. After adjustment for individual factors, <b>the</b> <b>odds</b> <b>of</b> consulting <b>a</b> specialist were higher in larger cities compared with rural areas, but most of this effect was attributable to other area-level variables. These area-level effects were different in magnitude and nature among males and females. Among males, <b>the</b> <b>odds</b> <b>of</b> consulting <b>a</b> specialist increased with the area-level density of specialists. Among females, such an effect was not significant, but <b>the</b> <b>odds</b> <b>of</b> consulting <b>a</b> specialist increased with the area-level percentage of highly educated individuals. CONCLUSIONS: Further investigation is required to better understand the processes operating at the area level that were shown to affect healthcare utilization in a different way for males and females. Policies may be needed to address problems of geographical access to specialty care, as well as situations of overuse of specialty care without regular recourse to primary care...|$|R
