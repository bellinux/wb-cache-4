5|$|Zur was {{extremely}} reluctant to withdraw his personal forces. He {{decided to do}} so only at 09:00, {{when it became clear}} that the other two companies were at a safe distance, and the Egyptians were massing for a counterattack. First, the injured were evacuated, then the rest of the forces made their way back, each squad providing cover for the next. The Egyptian artillery caused the forces to scatter, and the commanders had difficulty diverting them to the general retreat path. After <b>they</b> <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> small grove to the west of the main road, it was discovered that three were missing and 17 injured, who were treated by the only remaining medic. Approximately at noon, Zur's men met with Dromi and Harpaz, and the working communication device was used to summon vehicles to take the soldiers to Gan Yavne.|$|E
25|$|The 20th Brigade led the assault, {{with the}} 26th {{following}} them up while the 24th formed the divisional reserve. The 9th Division faced formidable natural barriers {{in the form}} of rivers swollen by recent rain. <b>They</b> <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> halt at the Busu River, which could not be bridged for two reasons: the 9th lacked heavy equipment, and the far bank was occupied by Japanese soldiers. On 9 September, the 2/28th Infantry Battalion led the attack across the Busu River and secured a bridgehead after fierce fighting.|$|E

25|$|The 818th {{supported}} the 5th Division in fighting around Saarlautern until 19 December, {{when it was}} ordered to disengage and move into reserve {{in response to the}} German attack in the Ardennes. It was assigned to join the 26th Infantry Division on 21 December; this division had been held in reserve near Metz to refit, and was now being sent north to hold the southern flank of the German offensive as part of III Corps. For the next ten days, the battalion pressed north, with the companies split up among the divisional infantry regiments, until <b>they</b> <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> standstill in Luxembourg {{at the end of the}} month. They remained in the line until 27 January, when the division was relieved and returned to the Saarlautern bridgehead.|$|E
25|$|On 7 June 2001, a Beechcraft B300C Super King Air 350, {{registration}} F-GOAE, {{departed from}} Le Mans-Arnage Airport (LME), France, to Santiago De Compostela Airport (SCQ), Spain, on a cargo flight according to instrument flight rules. Near the destination airport, the meteorological conditions {{were reported to}} be good, and the crew requested a visual approach to runway 17, even though the active runway was 35. Once cleared to land, the aircraft encountered a fog patch and from this moment it began a high ate descent (2000 to 3000ft/min). A minute after entering an unexpected and unforeseen fog patch, the aircraft struck some trees in level flight and with an airspeed of 148 kt. The wings and engines detached from the fuselage, and they dragged along a scrubland area until <b>they</b> <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> stop. The crew suffered minor injuries and the aircraft was completely destroyed.|$|E
25|$|One such {{story is}} that of Rabbi Joshua ben Levi. The rabbi, a friend of Elijah’s, was asked what favor he might wish. The rabbi {{answered}} only that {{he be able to}} join Elijah in his wanderings. Elijah granted his wish only if he refrained from asking any questions about any of the prophet’s actions. He agreed and they began their journey. The first place they came to was the house of an elderly couple who were so poor they had only one old cow. The old couple gave of their hospitality as best they could. The next morning, as the travelers left, Elijah prayed that the old cow would die and it did. The second place they came to was the home of a wealthy man. He had no patience for his visitors and chased them away with the admonition that they should get jobs and not beg from honest people. As they were leaving, they passed the man’s wall {{and saw that it was}} crumbling. Elijah prayed that the wall be repaired and it was so. Next, <b>they</b> <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> wealthy synagogue. They were allowed to spend the night with only the smallest of provisions. When they left, Elijah prayed that every member of the synagogue might become a leader.|$|E

500|$|In 1806, Charles {{issued a}} new guide for army and unit tactics. The main {{tactical}} innovation was {{the concept of}} the [...] "mass", an anti-cavalry formation created by closing up the spacing between ranks. However, Austrian commanders disliked the innovation and rarely used it unless directly supervised by Charles. Following the failures at Ulm and Austerlitz, the Austrians went back to using the six-companies-per-battalion model, abandoning the four-company-per-battalion that had been introduced by Mack on the eve of war in 1805. Problems persisted despite the reforms. The Austrians lacked sufficient skirmishers to successfully contend with their French counterparts, the cavalry was often sprinkled into individual units throughout the army, preventing the shock and hitting power evident in the French system, and even though Charles imitated the French corps command structure, leaders in the Austrian military establishment were often wary of taking the initiative, relying heavily on written orders and drawn-out planning before <b>they</b> <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> decision.|$|E

[...] Without orders from Houston {{and with no}} {{discussion}} amongst themselves, the troops in the lead took the road to Harrisburg. [...] They arrived on April 18, {{not long after the}} Mexican army's departure. [...] That same day, Deaf Smith and Henry Karnes captured a Mexican courier carrying intelligence on the locations and future plans of all of the Mexican troops in Texas. [...] Realizing that Santa Anna had only a small force and was not far away, Houston gave a rousing speech to his men, exhorting them to [...] "Remember the Alamo" [...] and [...] "Remember Goliad". [...] His army then raced towards Lynchburg. [...] Out of concern that his men might not differentiate between Mexican soldiers and the Tejanos in Seguín's company, Houston originally ordered Seguín and his men to remain in Harrisburg to guard those who were too ill to travel quickly. [...] After loud protests from Seguín and Antonio Menchaca, the order was rescinded, provided the Tejanos wear a piece of cardboard in their hats to identify them as Texian soldiers.|$|E
500|$|Stop 2 landed, formed {{up into a}} sweep {{line and}} marched {{carefully}} to the north alongside a dry riverbed. As darkness fell, just as <b>they</b> <b>came</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> widening in the riverbed, they were suddenly fired upon by an unseen foe. All four men {{dropped to the ground}} to avoid being hit. The Canadian lance-corporal called for covering fire from Soares, which he provided as Lamb and Rok rose to their feet and cautiously moved forward. A dark figure suddenly ran across the soldiers' line of sight, between Lamb and the riverbed, and from a distance of about 16 paces Olivier reflexively swung his rifle around and let off a frenzied, imprecise burst of fire. Mortally wounded by two errant shots through the chest, Lamb stumbled, slumped to the ground and lay face-down in a heap. One of the bullets exited through the back of his body, smashing the radio he had been carrying. He died almost instantly. Meanwhile, the cadres ahead ran headlong into Stop 1, led by Sergeant Derrick Taylor, and were all killed in the ensuing fire fight. Taylor's stick sustained no casualties. When the battle was over, Stops 1 and 3 joined Olivier, Rok and Soares and waited beside Lamb's lifeless body all night until it could be evacuated by helicopter to the local hospital at Chipinga. The death was officially recorded as [...] "killed in action", with no reference to friendly fire.|$|E
