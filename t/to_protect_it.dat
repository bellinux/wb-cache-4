5|$|Trees {{much older}} than 10,000 years would be {{practically}} impossible in Sweden, because until around 11,000 years ago the area was {{in the grip of}} a world-wide ice age.

50|$|From the 19th century, the {{building}} had various uses and had at different periods a ballroom, a restaurant and even two bowling alleys. These changes, and changes to the surrounding buildings, meant that the Old Synagogue, which is on a back lot down a narrow alleyway, was largely forgotten about.

50|$|Avimimus was a small, bird-like dinosaur with {{a length}} of 1.5 m (5 ft). The skull was small {{compared}} to the body, though the brain and eyes were large.

This {{is also consistent with}} the hypothesis that Avimimus had a proportionally large brain.|$|R
5|$|At {{least some}} wild {{bottlenose}} dolphins use tools. In Shark Bay, dolphins place a marine sponge on their rostrum, presumably <b>to</b> <b>protect</b> <b>it</b> when searching for {{food on the}} sandy sea bottom. This has only been observed in this bay (first in 1997), and is predominantly practiced by females. Sea otters are the only other known marine mammalian tool users. A 2005 study showed mothers most likely teach the behavior to their offspring, evincing culture (behavior learned from other species members).|$|E

John made extensive use of Wallingford Castle during the First Barons' War between 1215 and 1216, reinforcing the fortifications and mobilising a substantial garrison <b>to</b> <b>protect</b> <b>it.</b>|$|E
5|$|Calabria was {{designed}} for use in Italy's colonial empire, rather than the earlier vessels intended as fleet scouts. As such, her steel hull was sheathed with wood and then a layer of zinc <b>to</b> <b>protect</b> <b>it</b> from fouling during lengthy tours in the overseas colonies. Additionally, she was equipped with less powerful though more efficient engines than the earlier cruisers. The ship was otherwise similar to preceding designs like the Regioni class, having a displacement only slightly lower and a nearly identical gun battery.|$|E

Between 1924 and 1930, he excavated two lodges and over fifty graves.|$|E
