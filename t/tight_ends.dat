50|$|Because of {{the hybrid}} {{nature of the}} position, the <b>tight</b> <b>end's</b> role in any given offense depends on the {{tactical}} preferences and philosophy of the head coach. In some systems, the <b>tight</b> <b>end</b> will merely act as a sixth offensive lineman, rarely going out for passes. Other systems use the <b>tight</b> <b>end</b> primarily as a receiver, frequently {{taking advantage of the}} <b>tight</b> <b>end's</b> size to create mismatches in the defensive secondary. Many coaches will often have one <b>tight</b> <b>end</b> who specializes in blocking in running situations while using a <b>tight</b> <b>end</b> with better pass-catching skills in obvious passing situations.|$|R

5|$|After he {{graduated}} from Warren High School in Arkansas, where he played football as a wide receiver, Gragg committed to the University of Arkansas along with three other Warren players. Although he spent his freshman season as a receiver on the Arkansas Razorbacks football squad, the coaching staff converted Gragg into a tight end in 2010. In his sophomore and junior seasons, the Razorbacks made appearances in Bowl Championship Series games and defeated the Kansas State Wildcats in the 2012 Cotton Bowl Classic, which culminated the 2011 season. A knee injury caused Gragg to miss eight games in his senior season as the Arkansas team finished with a losing record.
