40|$|Process of <b>transition</b> <b>movements</b> in Republic of Sebia is in progress. <b>Transition</b> <b>movements</b> {{have not}} {{bypassed}} agrarian sector. Market agriculture should gain significance along this process. On this occasion {{we would like}} to emphasis two elements which affect development of Market Agriculture. Those are regionalization and specialization of agriculture. In study about agrarian regions in conditions of transition two charts are given, that pinpoint the essence of natural foundation and market opportunities in transition circumstances. Study of agro-identities starts with introspection of each reagion in respect of its natural values: plain (Vojvodina), hilly (Sumadija), mountain-hilly (Pester). Therefore, plain region is specialized for production of stable livestocking (cattle and hogs), mountain-hilly is based on pasture (sheep and cattle) etc. Regional disposition of some types of livestocking is limited by natural conditions and structure of agricultural area. Essentially, the level of livestock farming has been determined by economic progress of the region and Market development. The certain other regions are specialized in viticulture, fruit-growing or vegetable growing (vicinity of big cities). In time of transition, i. e. transferring to Market Agriculture, issue of regional identity has become more actual than ever. This could be best illustrated on the example of forming specialized cooperatives, agricultural markets and companies (plum and apple production and other agricultural cropping) spread throughout particular areas of Serbia. Agrarian regions, Regionalization, Specialization, Agribusiness, Community/Rural/Urban Development, International Development,...|$|R

50|$|The levade {{was first}} {{taught at the}} {{beginning}} of the 20th century, asking the horse to hold a position approximately 30-35 degrees from the ground. Unlike the pesade, which is more of a test of balance, the decreased angle makes the levade an extremely strenuous position to hold, and requires a greater effort from the horse. Therefore, many horses are not capable of a good-quality levade. The levade is also a <b>transition</b> <b>movement</b> between work on the ground and the airs above the ground. Neither of these movements are equivalent to rearing, as they require precise control, excellent balance, and a great deal of strength, and are the product of correct training, rather than resistance from the horse.|$|E

Preventable {{medication}} errors {{are often the}} result of ineffective processes {{that contribute to the}} occurrence of adverse drug events. Care <b>transitions,</b> <b>movement</b> between settings or levels of care, present a particularly vulnerable time for patients. Errors are frequently introduced into a patient's medication regimen during transitions of care, including the inappropriate discontinuation or duplication of medications. Inappropriate discontinuation (non-persistence) of evidence based therapies for chronic diseases places patients at an increased risk for adverse health outcomes. Previous investigations have indicated that care transitions due to hospitalization have been associated with increased rates of non-persistence, and that non-persistent patients were at an increased risk for poor health outcomes...|$|R
50|$|There is an {{increasing}} number of post-growth-oriented initiatives that are emerging in order to create prosperity in locally resilient, self-sufficient ways. Often these initiatives have come about as a response to sustainability issues. One example of a post-growth initiative is the <b>Transition</b> <b>Movement,</b> which seeks to create local resiliency in the context of peak oil and climate change (Transition Network). Voluntary simplicity (also known as simple living) and downshifting are also growing trends that can be considered post-growth. Tiny homes, ecovillages, and Quakers are good examples of how voluntary simplicity can be put into practice (see the Testimony of Simplicity). Post-growth ideas and actions are gaining international attention in the mainstream media, as The Guardian and Treehugger both featured articles about the post-growth movement in 2012.|$|E

40|$|The major {{challenges}} that sign language recognition (SLR) now faces are developing methods that solve large vocabulary continuous sign problems. In this paper, large vocabulary continuous SLR based on <b>transition</b> <b>movement</b> models is proposed. The proposed method employs the temporal clustering algorithm to cluster {{a large amount}} of transition movements, and then the corresponding training algorithm is also presented for automatically segmenting and training these <b>transition</b> <b>movement</b> models. The clustered models can improve the generalization of <b>transition</b> <b>movement</b> models, and are very suitable for large vocabulary continuous SLR. At last, the estimated <b>transition</b> <b>movement</b> models, together with sign models, are viewed as candidate models of the Viterbi search algorithm for recognizing continuous sign language. Experiments show that continuous SLR based on <b>transition</b> <b>movement</b> models has good performance over a large vocabulary of 5113 signs...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{explores the}} <b>Transition</b> <b>movement</b> {{as a model}} for {{sustainable}} development. The grassroots movement aims to increase community resilience in response to climate change and peak oil and emphasises local positive action. ‘Haddenham in Transition’, a village initiative in Buckinghamshire, is used as a case study. The <b>Transition</b> <b>movement</b> at the theoretical level is compared with its practical implementation in Haddenham. Their Transition activities and the level of local awareness and engagement are examined. The research method is through desktop research on Transition philosophy, a face-to-face survey of 20 Haddenham residents, and a telephone interview with the key contact for the initiative, David Lyons. The findings are that local residents were generally not familiar with the <b>Transition</b> <b>movement.</b> However, specific events and projects had a high level of awareness, Homemade in Haddenham in particular. The top priorities for respondents were ‘Education and Awareness ’ and ‘Transport’. The Transition group currently focuses on ‘Buildings and Energy’, ‘Food ’ and ‘Education and Awareness’. It is concluded that Haddenham in Transition needs more active members to progress. It is recommended that the group find new ways of recruiting participants. The use of terms like Transition and sustainability are found to be offputting. Framing activities in terms of saving money and having fun are more likely to engage the community. The <b>Transition</b> <b>movement</b> as a whole is judged to be replicable in most communities. However this is dependent on residents being open to the ideas. Having a motivated core group is the key to a successful initiative...|$|E
