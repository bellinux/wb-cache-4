5|$|Although Gandhi {{was not the}} {{originator}} of {{the principle}} of nonviolence, he was the first <b>to</b> <b>apply</b> <b>it</b> in the political field on a large scale. The concept of nonviolence (ahimsa) has a long history in Indian religious thought, with it being considered the highest dharma (ethical value virtue), a precept to be observed towards all living beings (sarvbhuta), at all times (sarvada), in all respects (sarvatha), in action, words and thought. Gandhi explains his philosophy and ideas about ahimsa as a political means in his autobiography The Story of My Experiments with Truth.|$|E
5|$|The {{success and}} {{expansion}} of Islam brought it into contact with different cultures, societies and traditions, {{such as those of}} Byzantines and Persians. With such contact, new problems emerged for Islamic law to tackle. Moreover, there was a significant distance between Medina, the Islamic capital, and the Muslims on the periphery on the Islamic state. Thus far off jurists had to find novel Islamic solutions without the close supervision of the hub of Islamic law (back in Medina). During the Umayyad dynasty, the concept of qiyas was abused by the rulers. The Abbasids, who succeeded the Umayyads defined it more strictly, in an attempt <b>to</b> <b>apply</b> <b>it</b> more consistently.|$|E

25|$|Tarski {{proved that}} {{elementary}} Euclidean geometry is complete: {{there is an}} algorithm which, for every proposition, can show it to be either true or false. (This does not violate Gödel's theorem, because Euclidean geometry cannot describe a sufficient amount of arithmetic for the theorem <b>to</b> <b>apply.)</b> <b>It</b> therefore follows that elementary elliptic geometry is also self-consistent and complete.|$|E
25|$|In {{the late}} 15th century and early 16th century, architects such as Bramante, Antonio da Sangallo the Younger and others showed a {{mastery of the}} revived style and ability <b>to</b> <b>apply</b> <b>it</b> to {{buildings}} such as churches and city palazzo which were {{quite different from the}} structures of ancient times.

25|$|Dijkstra's {{ideas about}} {{programming}} methodology (especially the structured programming movement) helped lay {{the foundations for}} the birth {{and development of the}} professional discipline of software engineering (in particular the software design and development), enabling programmers to organize and manage increasingly complex software projects. In the late 1960s Dijkstra discussed the concept of program families. And in the mid 1970s David Parnas and others clarified the idea and showed how <b>to</b> <b>apply</b> <b>it</b> in software engineering principles.|$|E

25|$|It is {{not only}} the Knesset, however, which has been {{repeatedly}} obliged to directly or indirectly address these issues. Over the years, many of Israel's interior ministers have examined the issue of the Law of Return and wavered as to how <b>to</b> <b>apply</b> <b>it.</b> The judiciary has also been called upon to express an opinion on matters relating to the Law. This burning and recurrent question in the country's political dialogue not only reveals but also exacerbates differences of opinion between Israelis.|$|E
25|$|Characterising by {{reference}} to the lex causae, the law that is identified {{in the choice of}} law stage of the conflict process as the one to be applied to determine the case, would be problematic. Although it may appear logical to allow the whole of the lex causae, including its characterisation rules, <b>to</b> <b>apply,</b> <b>it</b> actually produces a circular argument: the lex causae is to apply to the process of characterisation before the process of characterisation has led to the choice of the relevant lex causae.|$|E
25|$|Three-banked ("trireme") dromons are {{described}} in a 10th-century work dedicated to the parakoimōmenos Basil Lekapenos. However, this treatise, which survives only in fragments, draws heavily upon references on the appearance and construction of a Classical trireme, and must therefore be used with care when trying <b>to</b> <b>apply</b> <b>it</b> to the warships of the middle Byzantine period. The existence of trireme vessels is, however, attested in the Fatimid navy in the 11th and 12th centuries, and references made by Leo VI to large Arab ships in the 10th century may also indicate trireme galleys.|$|E

He argued bigness conflicted with efficiency and added {{a new dimension to}} the Efficiency Movement of the Progressive Era. As early as 1895 he had pointed out the harm that giant corporations could do to competitors, customers, and their own workers. The growth of industrialization was creating mammoth companies which he felt threatened the well-being of millions of Americans.

Furthermore, in questioning the witnesses about procedures and evidence, the Committee seemed to direct their line of inquisition towards attempting to coerce a response desirable to the Disciplinary Committee.|$|E
