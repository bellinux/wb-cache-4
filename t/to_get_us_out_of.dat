500|$|The {{next month}} Biden {{was not able}} to {{participate}} in two debates, the August 4 debate sponsored by the DailyKos and the August 9 LGBT Debate featured on the gay network Logo. He participated in the August 7 AFL-CIO Debate and the August 19 Iowa debate featured on ABC. On August 20 Biden aired his first campaign advertisement in the first caucus state of Iowa. In the 30-second ad a voiceover states that Biden has a plan to end the Iraq War, and that [...] "We (America) must end this war in a way that doesn't require us to send their (soldiers) grandchild back." [...] It continues by declaring, [...] "Joe Biden is the only candidate with a plan <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>us</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> Iraq and keep us out." ...|$|E
500|$|In February 2009, Pearl Jam {{went for}} a two-week session at Henson. It {{was the first time}} the band spent a {{considerable}} amount of time recording outside of Seattle since 1996's No Code. McCready said, [...] " [...] we got together with Ed and it really started getting more cohesive, we took that momentum down to Los Angeles with Brendan... It was a great idea <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>us</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> Seattle. You've gotta get out [...] your comfort zone, and we've talked about doing that for the past ten years and kind of haven't, so we trusted Brendan's judgment." [...] In April 2009, the band {{went for a}} two-week session to finish the album with O'Brien at his mixing facility at Southern Tracks in Atlanta, Georgia. The album took a total of thirty days in the studio to get finished, and O'Brien stated [...] "we had 90% of the record cut in the first nine days".|$|E
500|$|Matt Hills and Rebecca Williams also {{discuss the}} {{treatment}} of Cordelia (and Darla) in [...] "Angels Monstrous Mothers and Vampires with Soul: Investigating the Abject in 'Television Horror'", from [...] by Stacey Abbot. They see the send-offs of Cordelia, Fred and other characters {{as part of a}} pattern of highly gendered [...] "elaborated abjection" [...] seen in Angel. They also see Cordelia's possession in season four as part of a recurring pattern: [...] "More so than other characters in [...] and Angel, Cordelia has suffered or been threatened with bodily invasion and rape, either symbolically or literally" [...] and recounts the demon impregnation in [...] "Expecting", and similarly in [...] "Epiphany", where she develops a gestating demon in her head and then told she must mate with the Groosalugg in [...] "Through the Looking Glass". Cordelia even remarks on this, as Hills and Williams quote her as she remarks on her [...] "status as a violated and devalued character"; Cordelia states, [...] "If you ever figure out how <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>us</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> here, I want you to find me a dimension where some demon doesn't want to impregnate me with his spawn!" [...] They liken the horror motif in these examples, and in [...] "Inside Out", to what Barbara Creed called the 'monstrous womb' in her book The Monstrous-feminine: Film, Feminism, Psychoanalysis. Jes Battis also comments how, in comparison with the Fred-Illyria season five storyline, Cordelia's storyline is not as positive as Fred's rebirth, because Fred got to [...] "'live on' through Illyria, whereas Cordelia is taken right out of the show and receives no interesting blue-haired reincarnation". Continuing, they say that in fact, there is no meaningful connection between the [...] "real" [...] Cordelia and Jasmine, as the Cordelia who did those bad things is killed the moment Jasmine is, [...] "and the 'true' Cordy wakes up from her coma". Further illustrating the comparisons, [...] "Fred/Illyria become a joined mother/daughter subjectivity, a dual being whose constituent essences are inseparable; Cordelia is never so intimately connected with her evil child and is remembered as the healthy, vibrant Cordy that everyone knew." [...] Pointing out symbolic parallels in the subtexts of these gestations, Battis notes Cordelia, a vocal advocate of her own privilege, creates a fully formed supernatural being, Jasmine, who attempts (shockingly) to control the world. Fred, on the other hand, who internalizes her own privilege and cannot express it except in terms of insecurity and awkwardness, has her body devoured from the inside by the demon Illyria.|$|E

6000|$|... "I thought," [...] he whispered, [...] "that {{we should}} soon {{get a message}} of some sort. The news of our arrest will have set the hearts of a score of people quaking, and they would do {{anything}} now <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>us</b> <b>out</b> from this prison. They have already, you see, succeeded in bribing our warder." ...|$|R
40|$|A win-win {{measure that}} will {{contribute}} <b>to</b> <b>getting</b> <b>us</b> <b>out</b> {{of the crisis}} is {{the abolition of the}} tax void in OECD countries. The tax void is explained with graphics and it is shown how it can be eliminated for free. Adjustment costs will lie in understanding and adaptation of administrative procedure and not in the real economy. ...|$|R
2500|$|Part of {{what you}} have said and Senator Kerry has said {{that you are going to}} do in order <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>us</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the {{problems}} in Iraq is to internationalize the effort. Yet French and German officials have both said they have no intention even if John Kerry is elected of sending any troops into Iraq for any peacekeeping effort. Does that make your effort or your plan to internationalize this effort seem kind of naïve? ...|$|E
2500|$|On January 10, 2007, Bush {{announced}} {{his plans for}} the Iraq War troop surge of 2007. The gist of this announcement had been known around the Capitol for over a week, and when the Associated Press asked Ellison for his reaction to the idea on January 8, 2007, he stated that it was [...] "way too late, way too little.... So rather than do something small and ineffective, why not get about the business of what we're {{going to have to do}} eventually, which is to begin to end the occupation?" [...] Ellison called for an immediate withdrawal in Iraq: [...] "We could describe it as a redeployment or withdrawal, but I think we have run the course in terms of our ability to resolve this conflict militarily. I think we need to have a political and economic and diplomatic engagement, and we need to encourage the forces that are in Iraq to begin to resolve the violence in Iraq." [...] When asked if he would support Bush's call for an additional $100 billion to fund the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, Ellison said, [...] "I want to see [...] first, I want to actually look at it, but I'm not inclined to continue to support a war or an occupation that he has no plans <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>us</b> <b>out</b> <b>of,</b> and which is so costly in terms of dollars and lives of American soldiers but also Iraqis." [...] The White House, when asked for a reaction to the comments, referred to a previous statement by press secretary Tony Snow: [...] "Democrats will have to decide where they stand on two issues: 'No. 1, do you want Iraq to succeed, and, if so, what does that mean? And, No. 2, do you believe in supporting the troops as you say, and how do you express that support?'" ...|$|E

6000|$|... "It is {{the voice}} of sanity!" [...] said Summerlee with conviction. [...] "We have had adventures enough and they are neither {{suitable}} to our character or our position. I hold you to your word, Challenger. From now onwards you devote your energies <b>to</b> <b>getting</b> <b>us</b> <b>out</b> of this horrible country and back once more to civilization." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, if {{they give}} us the chance, Messer Francisco; but long before we are {{sufficiently}} near to Genoa to make out whether Pisani is lying off the port, they will see us from the hills, and will send off a galley to bring us in. However, we must take our chance, and if we get into a scrape I shall look to you confidently <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>us</b> <b>out</b> again." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "The saints are {{no doubt}} to be praised," [...] Harry said, [...] "but we feel at present {{a good deal more}} indebted to Dias and {{yourself}} than to them. We are indeed grateful to you both, and you managed it splendidly. My brother and I felt so confident that you would do something <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>us</b> <b>out,</b> that we were not in the least surprised when we recognized you and Diaz got up as travelling hawkers." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, I'm steady enough," [...] Mr. Mace replied impatiently. [...] "I want to {{know how}} you're going <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>us</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> this. What was the charge, anyhow?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I hope not. If they do, we'll be in a pickle, for I {{guess it}} will be Tom and the others who will have <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>us</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> this hole." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "If {{what you}} told Queen Coo-ee-oh was the truth," [...] they said to her, [...] "you are our lawful mistress, and we may depend on you <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>us</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> our difficulties." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "There's {{only one}} thing, lads," [...] Skysail Jack finally said. [...] "It'll soon be morning, and then they'll take <b>us</b> <b>out</b> and give <b>us</b> bloody hell. We were caught dead to rights with our clothes on. Winwood crossed us and squealed. They're going <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>us</b> <b>out</b> {{one by one}} and mess us up. There's forty of us. Any lyin's bound to be found out. So each lad, when they sweat him, just tells the truth, the whole truth, so help him God." ...|$|R
60|$|The {{fighting}} had {{now become}} intermittent. It {{was a sort}} of deadlock. We were in the caves, and the question with the Fire People was how <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>us</b> <b>out.</b> They did not dare come in after us, and in general we would not expose ourselves to their arrows. Occasionally, when one of them drew in close {{to the base of the}} cliff, one or another of the Folk would smash a rock down. In return, he would be transfixed by half a dozen arrows. This ruse worked well for some time, but finally the Folk no longer were inveigled into showing themselves. The deadlock was complete.|$|R
6000|$|... "There are {{precautions}} I mean to take," [...] Harding {{informed him}} dryly. [...] "However, I haven't {{come here to}} argue. For reasons of your own, you sent us into a belt of country which you thought we couldn't possibly get through. You expected us to be held up there until our provisions ran out and winter set in, when these Stonies would no doubt have moved on. Well, {{part of what you}} wished has happened; but the matter is taking a turn you couldn't have looked for. You led us into difficulties--and now you're going <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>us</b> <b>out.</b> I guess delay means danger. <b>Get</b> ready <b>to</b> start." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Very well, Jeekie. Now {{listen to}} me--you've got <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>us</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> Asiki-land by this day two months. If you don't, that lady will do {{anything}} to oblige me and no doubt there are more executioners left." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "By damn, it's dead," [...] was Captain Doane's comment {{five minutes}} later. [...] "Who'd believe it? A rifle bullet! I wish to heaven {{we could get}} half an hour's breeze of wind <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>us</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> this neighbourhood." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You'd {{better not}} say too much; I've stuck by you when worse men would have a' given you the cold shake, an' don't intend {{to take any}} guff, {{especially}} since I've had sich hard work <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>us</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the scrape you jumped into." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't {{think as}} hard of the 'squire as all that," [...] {{answered}} Thousandacres. [...] "He'll never {{send out a}} warrant ag'in <b>us,</b> without sendin' <b>out</b> a messenger to let us hear of it, and that in time <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>us</b> all <b>out</b> of the way." ...|$|R
60|$|This manœuvre {{of getting}} under way I had studied and worked out a score of times; and, with the jib-halyard to the windlass, I knew Maud was capable of {{hoisting}} that most necessary sail. A brisk wind was blowing into the cove, and though the water was calm, rapid work was required <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>us</b> safely <b>out.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "If they {{continue}} to guard us like this, Bertie, I really don't see {{a shadow of a}} chance of getting away. We calculated on there being one, or perhaps two sentries at the door, and thought we could have cut a hole through that adobe wall at the back and crept out through it; but as there is a guard at each corner, I don't see a chance of it. The fellows are evidently afraid of their captain, and each keeps to his corner, and sits there and smokes and drones out songs, but they never move till they are relieved. Of course we must make the attempt if we see no other way of escaping. But I have still great hope that Dias will somehow or other try <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>us</b> <b>out,</b> though how he can do it I don't know." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{has nothing}} to do with perspicacity," [...] Jeanne said. [...] "Harry saved my life from that dreadful dog, and after that I knew if there was danger he would be able <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>us</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> it. That is, if it were {{possible}} for anyone to do so." ...|$|E
6000|$|... “From {{the very}} beginning,” he said, “I think every {{man on the}} boat {{believed}} {{that we could not}} escape being sunk, and that is what would have happened {{had it not been for}} the bravery of the boys on the Hudson, who worked for over an hour under the most terrific fire <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>us</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> range.” ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I wouldn't swear at Oom Sam too hard," [...] Monty continued. [...] "Remember for {{the last}} two days he was doing all he could <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>us</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the place. It was those fetish fellows who worked the {{mischief}} and he--certainly--warned us all he could. He took us safely to Bekwando and he worked the oracle with the King!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "None, save my {{love and}} duty. Tell him that, thanks to you, {{although}} still somewhat feeble, I am recovered of my hurt upon {{the ship and}} the fever which I took from the sun, and that if he can make any plan <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>us</b> all <b>out</b> of this accursed city and the grip of Morella I will bless his name and yours." ...|$|R
50|$|In 1923, Harding, now tainted {{further by}} scandals, died and his vice-president, Calvin Coolidge, became president. Under Coolidge, the economy revived and the conservatives regained control of US Congress in 1924 In general, the Republicans {{retained}} control of Congress until 1931, after 19 Republicans in the US House of Representatives died and Democrats took their {{places in the}} special elections- after Republican President Herbert Hoover had continuously failed <b>to</b> <b>get</b> the <b>US</b> <b>out</b> of the Great Depression.|$|R
5000|$|Their novels were {{published}} by a self-publishing press called New Horizons, {{and they made}} many attempts to sell short stories to magazines, but were unsuccessful. A brief fling with some American boys, the sons of a US Navy serviceman, led nowhere. The girls committed a number of crimes including arson, which led to their being admitted to Broadmoor Hospital, a high-security mental health hospital. There they remained for 14 years. June later blamed this lengthy sentence to their selective muteness: [...] "'Juvenile delinquents get two years in prison... We got 12 years of hell because we didn't speak... We lost hope, really. I {{wrote a letter to}} the Queen, asking her <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>us</b> <b>out.</b> But we were trapped." [...] Placed on high doses of antipsychotic medications, they found themselves unable to concentrate; Jennifer apparently developed tardive dyskinesia (a neurological disorder resulting in involuntary, repetitive movements). Their medications were apparently adjusted sufficiently to allow them to continue the copious diaries they had begun in 1980, and they were able to join the hospital choir, but they lost most of their interest in creative writing.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{will tell}} you why, sir," [...] {{returned}} Dave, and related the affair of the Widow Breen. [...] "That made him very sore on us, and he wanted <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>us</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> the school. At first he tried it by overworking us in our lessons, and when he found that that didn't work he tried this game of making out that we were criminals." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "They're hard tickets, {{and were}} most likely marooned here because of their misdeeds," [...] he muttered {{to himself as he}} lounged on deck to {{ascertain}} if the enemy had made any change of position. [...] "It'll take some mighty neat work <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>us</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> this scrape, for we can't risk a fight, and it's a question whether Bob can be held in check." ...|$|E
60|$|Your betters had no {{share in}} the {{immediate}} cause of the war; we know what nation has that blot to wipe out; but for fifty years or so we heeded not the rumblings of the distant drum, I do not mean by lack of military preparations; and when war did come we told youth, who had <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>us</b> <b>out</b> <b>of</b> it, tall tales of {{what it really is}} and of the clover beds to which it leads.|$|E
6000|$|... "You're always wanting <b>to</b> <b>get</b> {{me out of}} the house," [...] he continued; [...] "I {{think you}} want <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>us</b> ALL <b>out,</b> for you manage to keep Nanda from showing even more than you do me. Don't you think your {{children}} good ENOUGH, mummy dear? At any rate it's as plain as possible that if you don't keep us at home you must keep us in other places. One can't live anywhere for nothing--it's all bosh that a fellow saves by staying with people. I don't know how it is for a lady, but a man's practically let in--" ...|$|R
50|$|One day of {{the festival}} was devoted to {{solidarity}} {{with the people of}} Puerto Rico, especially the fight <b>to</b> <b>get</b> the <b>U.S.</b> Navy <b>out</b> of the island of Vieques, which was then being used as a bombing range and testing ground by the navy and United States Navy in Vieques, Puerto Rico.|$|R
5000|$|... "Right Here", {{together}} with the second single, [...] "Cut It Out", were both recorded with producer Craig Leon in London in late December 1986.
