40|$|Abstract: A two-states quantum {{system with}} one control is {{proved to be}} flat. This {{provides}} a simple procedure to design smooth open-loop controls that steer in finite time from one eigen-state to the other one. A <b>three-states</b> quantum system with one control is not flat in general. Following the Rabi oscillations used by physicists to control stimulated transition, we associate to this system an averaged control system where the number of controls is increased and where flatness-based motion planning techniques can be used. This allows to steer directly from one eigen-state to any other one without using an additional intermediate eigen-state. In certain energy configurations our method is a noticeable improvement of the standard Rabi transitions strategy and leads to ” active tunnelling control”, as illustrated by simulations. This method can be extended without major difficulties to higher dimensional cases...|$|R
40|$|I {{study the}} effects of product and labor market {{frictions}} in a dynamic general equilibrium model with a <b>three-states</b> representation of the labor market. Firms bargain with unions over wages and employment levels. This generates unemployment. Households take the associated unemployment risk as given in making participation and consumption-saving decisions. Unemployment harms output because it inserts a wedge between labor supply (participation) and employment. New firms make entry decisions based on expected future profitability as determined by macroeconomic conditions. The model produces dynamics consistent with the long-run trends exhibited by the US and EU 15 economies over the last 40 - 50 years. It also features feedback mechanisms linking the two markets that amplify the adverse effects on output of labor and product market frictions. These multiplier effects have interesting policy implications. Product Market, Labor Market, Market Structure, Employment, Unemployment...|$|R

40|$|We {{consider}} a general class of mathematical models for stochastic gene expression where the transcription rate {{is allowed to}} depend on a promoter state variable that can take an arbitrary (finite) number of values. We provide {{the solution of the}} master equations in the stationary limit, based on a factorization of the stochastic transition matrix that separates timescales and relative interaction strengths, and we express its entries in terms of parameters that have a natural physical and/or biological interpretation. The solution illustrates the capacity of multiple states promoters to generate multimodal distributions of gene products, without the need for feedback. Furthermore, using the example of a three states promoter operating at low, high, and intermediate expression levels, we show that using multiple states operons will typically lead to a significant reduction of noise in the system. The underlying mechanism is that a <b>three-states</b> promoter can change its level of expression from low to high by passing through an intermediate state with a much smaller increase of fluctuations than by means of a direct transition.

40|$|Although several {{prognostic}} {{factors have}} been identified in ALS, there remains some discordance concerning the prognostic significance of the age and clinical form at onset. In order to clarify these findings, we have analysed already known prognostic factors using a multi-state model. Two hundred and twenty-two sporadic ALS patients were followed. A simple unidirectional <b>three-states</b> model was used to summarize clinical course of ALS. States 1 and 2 reflected the progression of neurological impairment and state 3 represented the end of follow-up (tracheotomy or death). Gender, diagnostic delay, body mass index (BMI) and slow vital capacity (SVC) were also recorded. A time-inhomogeneous Markov model with piecewise constant transition intensities was used to estimate the effect of the covariates in each transition. The bulbar form at onset was only correlated with a more rapid clinical progression between state 1 and state 2. In contrast, an advanced age at diagnosis affected only survival from state 2. This methodological approach suggests that these two factors have a different prognostic significance: age at onset is related to patient's survival and the clinical form at onset predicts the progression of motoneuronal impairment in different regions...|$|R
