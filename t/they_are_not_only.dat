25|$|Fluoride {{glass is}} {{a class of}} non-oxide optical quality glasses {{composed}} of fluorides of various metals. Because of their low viscosity, {{it is very difficult}} to completely avoid crystallization while processing it through the glass transition (or drawing the fiber from the melt). Thus, although heavy metal fluoride glasses (HMFG) exhibit very low optical attenuation, <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>only</b> difficult to manufacture, but are quite fragile, and have poor resistance to moisture and other environmental attacks. Their best attribute is that they lack the absorption band associated with the hydroxyl (OH) group (3,200–3,600cm−1; i.e., 2,777–3,125nm or 2.78–3.13 μm), which is present in nearly all oxide-based glasses.|$|E
25|$|Ever {{since the}} over-commercialization of hip hop {{occurred}} between the late 1980s and the mid 1990s (at peak), traditional hip hop supporters {{have been in}} a feud with more progressive hip hop fans, claiming that they are uneducated towards what they are building, and that it <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>only</b> building music that steps further and further away from Hip Hop, but causes ignorance and misconceptions between fans of more progressed Hip Hop, and traditional fans of the Hip Hop culture.

25|$|The social {{structures}} {{of many of}} these places perpetuate the marginalization and oppression of women in the form of cultural norms and legal codes. As a result of this unequal social order, women are usually relegated into positions where <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>only</b> more vulnerable to suffering from health problems, but also less able to have access and control over healthcare resources than men. For example, women living in areas with a patriarchal system are often less likely to receive tertiary education or to be employed in the paid labor market due to gender discrimination. As a result, female life expectancy at birth and nutritional well-being, and immunity against communicable and non-communicable diseases, are often lower than those of men.|$|E

25|$|William A. Croft's radical {{construction}} grammar {{is designed}} for typological purposes and takes into account cross-linguistic factors. It deals mainly with the internal structure of constructions. Radical construction grammar is totally non-reductionist, and Croft argues that constructions are not derived from their parts, but that the parts are derived from the constructions they appear in. Thus, in radical construction grammar, constructions are likened to s. Radical construction grammar rejects the idea that syntactic categories, roles, and relations are universal and argues that <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>only</b> language-specific, but also construction specific. Thus, there are no universals that make reference to formal categories, since formal categories are language- and construction-specific. The only universals {{are to be found}} in the patterns concerning the mapping of meaning onto form. Radical construction grammar rejects the notion of syntactic relations altogether and replaces them with semantic relations. Like Goldbergian/Lakovian construction grammar and cognitive grammar, radical construction grammar is closely related to cognitive linguistics, and like cognitive grammar, radical construction grammar appears to be based on the idea that form is semantically motivated.|$|E
25|$|New {{forms of}} New Media are {{emerging}} like Web 2.0 tools Facebook and YouTube, along with {{video games and}} the consoles they are played on. It is helping to make video games and video game consoles branch out into New Media as well. Gamers on YouTube post videos of them playing video games they like and {{that people want to}} watch. Cultural changes are happening because people can upload their gaming experiences to a Web 2.0 tool like Facebook and YouTube for the world to see. Consoles like the Xbox One and the PlayStation 4 have WiFi connectivity and chat rooms on most of their video games that allow gamer-to-gamer conversations around the world. They also allow people to connect to YouTube, so if they stream/record a gamer, it allows for easy uploading to YouTube for the world to see. Even the older video game consoles are becoming new media because YouTube can display the walkthroughs and let's plays of the game. YouTube gaming is evolving because some YouTubers are getting wealthy and earning money from their videos. The more people that become YouTube members, the popular YouTube becomes and the more it starts emerging as a new source of media, along with video games and consoles. The chat room/online gaming/WiFi consoles are getting the highest increase in popularity because <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>only</b> the most advanced, but because of the newest video games being created {{that the majority of the}} gaming community wants to buy, play and watch. The older video games and consoles also get popularity, but from YouTube's capabilities of uploading them to the gamer's channels for everyone to see. The older games get popularity from the communities nostalgia of the game(s), and the old school graphics and gameplay that made people see how old-school technology was the best at some point in time. Facebook helps those video games and consoles get popularity as well. People can upload the videos they create to Facebook as well. Facebook is a much larger website with a lot more users, so people use Facebook to spread their gaming content as well.|$|E

And you wouldn't sit down and write a book about a book, it's like recycling, it misses the point. And music isn't brilliant unless it goes beyond the point of being music and becomes real life. So I'm influenced by real life. And when people listen to my music and say [...] "Oh, I can see great influence from this artist in there", I read that and I say [...] "Okay, I didn't succeed". But if people listen to my music and say [...] "Oh, this made me feel like this and that [...] ", that's right.

2500|$|Distortion of the {{electric}} current by loads is measured in several ways. [...] Power factor is the ratio of resistive (or real) power to volt-amperes. [...] A capacitive load has a leading power factor, and an inductive load has a lagging power factor. A purely resistive load (such as a filament lamp, heater or kettle) exhibits a power factor of 1. Current harmonics are a measure of distortion of the wave form. [...] For example, electronic loads such as computer power supplies draw their current at the voltage peak to fill their internal storage elements. [...] This {{can lead to a}} significant voltage drop near the supply voltage peak which shows as a flattening of the voltage waveform. This flattening causes odd harmonics which are not permissible if they exceed specific limits, as <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>only</b> wasteful, but may interfere with the operation of other equipment. Harmonic emissions are mandated by law in EU and other countries to fall within specified limits.|$|E
2500|$|However commendable {{these views}} may be, <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>only</b> {{unofficial}} but also entirely statistical.

The historical view centres on the historical significance of a match and its known contemporary importance measured by, {{as is often the case}} with early matches, the amount of money at stake. Other factors are the size of the crowd, if known, and the fact that a match was deemed notable enough to be reported in the press. The earliest match known to have been accorded superior status in a contemporary report (i.e., [...] "a great match" [...] in this case) and to have been played for a large sum of money was one in Sussex between two unnamed eleven-a-side teams contesting [...] "fifty guineas apiece" [...] in June 1697, a match of enormous historical significance but with no statistical data recorded.|$|E
2500|$|The {{construction}} of the C 37/40 was ahead of it's time. Utilizing aircraft grade pre-impregnated balsa core material and Kevlar / fibreglass fabric, the hull and deck are laid up using vinyl ester resin for strength, blister resistance and light weight. The C 37 Plus series are built up with isophthalic (Hydrex®) gelcoat, C's exclusive Kevlar hybrid, E-Glass, pre-impregnated end-grain Baltek AL-600 balsa ( [...] balsa core in hull and [...] in deck) and Hydrex® resin. Hydrex®, a modified isophthalic [...] vinyl ester resin, has higher hydrolytic stability, toughness and is more crack resistant than conventional resins. The layups of the R and XL series use Kevlar hybrid exclusively with Hydrex® resin {{on both sides of}} a core of Balteck AL-600 aircraft grade balsa. All materials are Lloyd's approved. These exclusive C laminate schedules result in hulls and decks which despite significant weight reduction are stronger than the conventional glass laminates of the time. <b>They</b> <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>only</b> much lighter, but stiffer and more rigid.
