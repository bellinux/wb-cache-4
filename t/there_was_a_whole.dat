Without the bra, it wouldn't have worked. <b>There</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>whole</b> lot there to be held in and pushed up." [...] It has been claimed that her bosom was a major force behind the development of the 1950s brassieres, including the [...] "Whirlpool bra", Cuties, the [...] "Shutter bra", the [...] "Action bra", latex pads, cleavage revealing designs and uplift outline.|$|E
500|$|Paxton {{learned of}} the novel A Simple Plan from his father five years before {{securing}} the role of Hank. He stated, [...] "... for five years, <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>whole</b> list of actors and directors who kind of marched through it. Billy Bob and I were set to do these roles in 1997, and then it fell apart. That was the cruelest twist for an actor, to get a part you dreamed you'd get and then they decide to scrap the whole thing." [...] Rudin considered casting Anne Heche as Hank's wife Sarah Mitchell. In December 1997, Bridget Fonda, who had previously collaborated with Raimi on Army of Darkness (1992), was cast as Sarah Mitchell.|$|E
500|$|One of the {{consequences}} of all the uncertainty behind the scenes was Chrissie's final fate, which was left largely unresolved. Oberman revealed in July 2009 that originally there were plans for a trial, but that poor timing ultimately shelved the storyline. She recalled how the storyline [...] "was put on hold and then <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>whole</b> different team involved after that. I know that if they couldn't get me, Michelle and Kim together, [...] And I'd moved straight on to Doctor Who, too. Nobody was available until the following year, by which point Michelle was in Bionic Woman, I was pregnant and Kim was in Cabaret." [...] Because of this [...] "I never felt it was finished off and I {{would have loved to have}} wrapped it up." [...] She went on to declare her desire to return for a proper resolution. [...] "I'd love to finish off Chrissie's storyline because I love the character and I do feel that she was left in limbo. To know what happened to her would be great. Even if she went back to say goodbye or wanted to make peace with Sam. Or maybe we could see her in prison?" ...|$|E

500|$|Possessing a {{mezzo-soprano}} vocal range, Madonna {{has always}} been self-conscious about her voice, especially in comparison to her vocal idols such as Ella Fitzgerald, Prince, and Chaka Khan. Mark Bego, author of Madonna: Blonde Ambition, called her [...] "the perfect vocalist for lighter-than-air songs", despite not being a [...] "heavyweight talent." [...] According to MSNBC critic Tony Sclafani, [...] "Madonna's vocals {{are the key to}} her rock roots. Pop vocalists usually sing songs [...] "straight," [...] but Madonna employs subtext, irony, aggression and all sorts of vocal idiosyncrasies in the ways John Lennon and Bob Dylan did." [...] Madonna used a bright, girlish vocal timbre in her early albums which became passé in her later works. The change was deliberate since she was constantly reminded of how the critics had once labelled her as [...] "Minnie Mouse on helium". During the filming of Evita, Madonna had to take vocal lessons, which increased her range further. Of this experience she commented, [...] "I studied with a vocal coach for Evita and I realized <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>whole</b> piece of my voice I wasn't using. Before, I just believed I had a really limited range and was going {{to make the most of}} it." ...|$|E
500|$|When {{asked what}} {{led him to}} write a novel {{centered}} on two Afghan women, Hosseini responded:"I had been entertaining the idea of writing a story of Afghan women for some time after I'd finished writing The Kite Runner. That first novel was a male-dominated story. All the major characters, except perhaps for Amir's wife Soraya, were men. <b>There</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>whole</b> facet of Afghan society which I hadn't touched on in The Kite Runner, an entire landscape that I felt was fertile with story ideas...In the spring of 2003, I went to Kabul, and I recall seeing these burqa-clad women sitting at street corners, with four, five, six children, begging for change. I remember watching them walking in pairs up the street, trailed by their children in ragged clothes, and wondering how life had brought them to that point...I spoke to many of those women in Kabul. Their life stories were truly heartbreaking...When I began writing A Thousand Splendid Suns, I found myself thinking about those resilient women over and over. Though no one woman that I met in Kabul inspired either Laila or Mariam, their voices, faces, and their incredible stories of survival were always with me, and a good part of my inspiration for this novel came from their collective spirit." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{band has}} stated that the album's tenth track, [...] "Wretches and Kings", pays homage to the hip-hop group Public Enemy. Speaking to NME about the song's {{reference}} to Public Enemy, Shinoda said, [...] "There is a homage to Chuck D on there. It's probably the most hip-hop song on the record {{and one of the}} most aggressive...Public Enemy were very three-dimensional with their records because although they seemed political, <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>whole</b> lot of other stuff going on in there too. It made me think how three-dimensional I wanted our record to be without imitating them of course, and show where we were at creatively." [...] Ian Winwood of Kerrang! noted that [...] "Wretches and Kings" [...] references the Public Enemy song [...] "Fight the Power" [...] and compared the album's content to Public Enemy's third studio album, Fear of a Black Planet. Chuck D later provided vocals on a remix by HavocNdeeD. The fifth track [...] "When They Come for Me" [...] references , the seventh studio album by hip hop artist Jay-Z, with whom the band collaborated on the 2004 EP Collision Course. The album includes samples of notable speeches by American political figures, including Martin Luther King, Jr., J. Robert Oppenheimer, and Mario Savio.|$|E

500|$|The {{third and}} final session, in the evening on 15 October, {{produced}} four more recordings that completed the album— [...] "The Way Young Lovers Do" [...] "Sweet Thing", [...] "Ballerina" [...] and [...] "Slim Slow Slider". Davis expressed to Rolling Stone {{that there was a}} [...] "certain feel about a seven-to-ten o' clock session" [...] and that [...] "the ambience of that time of day was all through everything we played". Both [...] "Sweet Thing" [...] and [...] "Ballerina" [...] were originally scheduled for the session, but the search for a 'closer' consumed a considerable amount of time. [...] They attempted (and rejected) a number of songs until Morrison suggested [...] "Slim Slow Slider". [...] "I don't think we'd ever done [...] live," [...] recalls Payne. [...] " [...] had a book full of songs... I don't know why he decided to do it...And we were first doing it with the drums, with Richard Davis and Connie Kay and the guitar player and the vibe player and me and Van— all of us were playing. Then I started playing soprano sax on the thing, and Lew said, 'OK, I wanna try it again. Start again. And I want just the bass, the soprano sax, and Van.'" [...] It was a successful take, but it also came with a very long coda, prompting Merenstein to make a large cut during the editing process. Many of the tracks on Astral Weeks would be subjected to edits (mainly to tighten the performances), but the one on [...] "Slim Slow Slider" [...] was easily the most substantial. [...] "I would estimate three, five minutes of instrumental stuff," [...] says Payne. [...] "We went through stages [...] we got to be avant-garde kind of weird, which is what you hear after the splice – all that weird stuff we're playing – but <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>whole</b> progression to that." [...] According to Merenstein, before he cut it, the coda [...] "was a long, long ending that went nowhere, that just carried on from minute to minute...If it had [...] relativity to the tune itself, I would have left it there." ...|$|E
2500|$|Upon {{their arrival}} at Elstree Studios, Wendy Carlos and Rachel Elkind were shown {{the first version}} of the film by Kubrick: [...] "The film was a little on the long side. There were great gobs of scenes that never made it to the film. <b>There</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>whole</b> strange and mystical scene in which Jack Nicholson discovers objects that have been {{arranged}} in his working space in the ballroom with arrows and things. He walks down and thinks he hears a voice and a ghost throws a ball back to him. None of that made it to the final film. We scored a lot of those. We didn't know what was going to be used for sure". Carlos has said that she was so disillusioned by Kubrick's actions that she vowed never to work with him again. Her own music was released in its near entirety in 2005 as part of her Rediscovering Lost Scores compilation.|$|E
2500|$|After the Democrats {{took control}} of the Senate in 1986, giving them control of both Houses of Congress, {{allegations}} were made to Attorney General Edwin Meese that Whittlesey had granted diplomatic favors for private contributions to her State Department-administered representational fund and that she had also obstructed justice. [...] Meese [...] "found no 'reasonable grounds' to pursue allegations that" [...] Whittlesey [...] "mishandled entertainment funds at the embassy or improperly aided contributors to the funds" [...] in contravention of the independent counsel statute. Hearings into the subject were held by a House Foreign Affairs subcommittee, but the hearings failed to produce substantiation of the charges and went nowhere. [...] The Wall Street Journal, in an editorial entitled [...] "True Grit," [...] echoing a popular movie of the time, dismissed the investigation. [...] "The ambassador had been back in Washington for the past few months, where she successfully defended herself against charges that she'd misspent money that had been donated to the U.S. State Department and then tried to obstruct the investigation into her spending. The U.S. Justice Department has now filed a notification in Federal Circuit Court in Washington clearing the ambassador of any wrongdoing and vindicating the view that <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>whole</b> lot less to the whole affair than had met either the eye or ear....It is impressive to come out of such an investigation clean and clear." ...|$|E
