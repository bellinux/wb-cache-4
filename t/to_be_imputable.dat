40|$|The {{issue of}} {{imputation}} in penal law generated, through out the history, many controversies. The principal {{aim of this}} study is to clarify this concept, both in relation with the Romanian and foreign doctrine, and with the new provisions of the new Penal code, enforced by the Law nr. 286 / 2009. The new Penal code introduces, a new definition of the offence, containing the concept of “imputability”. Our study is based both on the opinions of some foreign authors regarding the concept of imputability, imputation and Romanian authors. According to the Initiator (Ministry of Justice) the main justification for introducing this concept into the offence definition was that “a deed, in order to bring upon criminal responsibility, must not only to correspond with the legal description, to be unjustified, but also, the deed, must be able <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>imputable</b> to the offender; that means, the deed could be reproached to the offender. In order to discuss this concept of imputation, there are necessary some premises: the offender must have had the representation of his/her actions or inactions and the lack of any duress (the offender should not have been irresponsible, intoxicated or an under aged). In addition, the offender must have known the illicit character of the deed when committing the offence (the lack of error). Also, the study is structured in tree parts, fist beginning with the need for a definition of the offence, second part refers to the concept of offence in Romanian law; third part (the extended one) is dedicated to the essential features of the offence, with a special view on imputation/imputability...|$|E
40|$|Subject {{matter of}} the present study is the right of redress {{provided}} by the Directive 44 / 1999 on consumer sales for final seller. To him art. 1519 -quinquies, which according <b>to</b> the Directive <b>was</b> introduced into the Italian civil code, grants a remedy as against anyone of the previous sellers in the chain to whom the non conformity <b>to</b> contract <b>is</b> <b>imputable.</b> The final seller can recover any expense due to the non conformity he has made, and this is true redress in a technical sense. After this precision, the author tries to single out the foundation of this remedy and comes to the conclusion that this is the liability of the one in the chain who has caused the non conformity. Question arises whether the redress includes also damages paid to the consumer by the final seller, since the discipline introduced by the Directive does not deal with this problem. The study finally <b>is</b> an occasion <b>to</b> discuss the question regarding the nature of the fundamental remedy granted by the new discipline to the consumer as against the final seller. The relationship between the rules on products liability and those newly introduced on consumer sales is also dealt with...|$|R

40|$|We {{carried out}} a {{large-scale}} analysis on quantitative and qualitative composition of the bird communities living in Italian urban ecosystems, comparing them with the avifaunas of regional areas. The comparison between these two territorial levels {{makes it possible to}} identify the effects of urbanization in different biogeographical and ecological contexts. Particularly, we have analysed the variation of some diversity indexes, biogeographical and chorological categories according to latitudinal gradient. In contrast with the expected biogeographical peninsular effect, the decreasing in species richness for Italian cities is significantly less steep than that observed for their corresponding not urbanized areas. Moreover, Palearctic-Oriental species clearly prevail in cities, regardless of latitude. In the cities small Passerine species are more abundant than in the surrounding areas. The diversity found in the cities, relative to biogeographical categories, may <b>be</b> <b>imputable</b> <b>to</b> the typical ecological diversity of the urban ecosystems.

Although Froissait and most other historians described him as a noble and courteous man, Aymeric insisted on the avarice, selfishness and hypocrisy of the count. This negative and reproachful point of view attests to the fact that other writers also conjectured that certain deeds may have <b>been</b> <b>imputable</b> <b>to</b> the count. But in Aymeric's opinion there is no doubt whatsoever concerning the murder of Gaston Fébus's son, for instance, or the accusation of sorcery. Linked to the Armagnac clan, the writer's judgment was above all moral and political; he expounded on Fortune and death on an elevated literary level, serving to promote the figure of King Charles VI as a model. Among princes, chivalrous nobles like the Black Prince, or Jean d'Armagnac, Fébus's rival, were set apart, despite their failures, from the cynical princes, who refused the counsel of the Church and neglected the peace and wellbeing of their subjects.

However, methodologies for {{the discovery of}} biomarkers using microarray data often provide results with limited overlap. These differences <b>are</b> <b>imputable</b> <b>to</b> 1) dataset size (few subjects {{with respect to the}} number of features); 2) heterogeneity of the disease; 3) heterogeneity of experimental protocols and computational pipelines employed in the analysis. In this paper, we focus on the first two issues and assess, both on simulated (through an in silico regulation network model) and real clinical datasets, the consistency of candidate biomarkers provided by a number of different methods. Methods: We extensively simulated the effect of heterogeneity characteristic of complex diseases on different sets of microarray data. Heterogeneity was reproduced by simulating both intrinsic variability of the population and the alteration of regulatory mechanisms. Population variability was simulated by modeling evolution of a pool of subjects; then, a subset of them underwent alterations in regulatory mechanisms so as to mimic the disease state. Results: The simulated data allowed us to outline advantages and drawbacks of different methods across multiple studies and varying number of samples and to evaluate precision of feature selection on a benchmark with known biomarkers. Although comparable classification accuracy was reached by different methods, the use of external cross-validation loops i...|$|R
