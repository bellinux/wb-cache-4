5|$|According to Herodotus, only 43,000 Persians {{survived the}} battle. <b>The</b> <b>number</b> <b>who</b> died, of course, {{depends on how}} many there were in the first place; there would be 257,000 dead by Herodotus' reckoning. Herodotus claims that the Greeks as a whole lost only 159 men. Furthermore, he claims that only Spartans, Tegeans and Athenians died, since {{they were the only}} ones who fought. Plutarch, who had access to other sources, gives 1,360 Greek {{casualties}}, while both Ephorus and Diodorus Siculus tally the Greek casualties to over 10,000.|$|E

5|$|Bonaparte {{began with}} an army of 13,000 men; 1,500 were {{reported}} missing, 1,200 died in combat, and thousands perished from disease—mostly bubonic plague. He failed to reduce the fortress of Acre, so he marched his army back to Egypt in May. To speed up the retreat, Bonaparte ordered plague-stricken men to be poisoned with opium; <b>the</b> <b>number</b> <b>who</b> died remains disputed, ranging {{from a low of}} 30 to a high of 580. He also brought out 1,000 wounded men. Back in Egypt on 25 July, Bonaparte defeated an Ottoman amphibious invasion at Abukir.|$|E
5|$|The Liverpool badge {{is based}} on the city's liver bird, which in the past had been placed inside a shield. In 1992, to commemorate the centennial of the club, a new badge was commissioned, {{including}} a representation of the Shankly Gates. The next year twin flames were added at either side, symbolic of the Hillsborough memorial outside Anfield, where an eternal flame burns in memory of those who died in the Hillsborough disaster. In 2012, Warrior Sports' first Liverpool kit removed the shield and gates, returning the badge to what had adorned Liverpool shirts in the 1970s; the flames were moved to the back collar of the shirt, surrounding the number 96 for <b>the</b> <b>number</b> <b>who</b> died at Hillsborough.|$|E
5|$|The {{air attacks}} on Japan caused {{hundreds}} of thousands of casualties, though estimates of <b>the</b> <b>number</b> <b>who</b> were killed and wounded vary considerably. The strategic attacks by the Twentieth Air Force caused most of the casualties and damage. The figures most frequently cited in the literature on the campaign are sourced from the USSBS report The Effects of Bombing on Health and Medical Services in Japan which estimated that 333,000 Japanese were killed and 473,000 wounded. Included in this figure were an estimated 120,000 dead and 160,000 injured in the two atomic bomb attacks. Another USSBS report, The Effects of Strategic Bombing on Japanese Morale, included a much higher estimate of 900,000 killed and 1.3million injured which was reached by a Japanese research team using a statistical sampling methodology. While this figure is also occasionally cited, the USSBS' investigators regarded the work of their statistical teams as unsatisfactory, and the researchers were unable to calculate the error rate of this estimate. The postwar Japanese government calculated in 1949 that 323,495 people had been killed by air attacks in the home islands. The destruction of buildings housing government records during air raids contributed to the uncertainty about the number of casualties. The Twentieth Air Force lost 414 B-29s during attacks on Japan. Over 2,600 American bomber crew members were killed, including POWs who died in captivity, and a further 433 were wounded.|$|E

They were initially settled on the Creek Reservation, which created tensions. The next year, the Florida people numbered 3,136.
