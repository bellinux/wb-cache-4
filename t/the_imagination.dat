Two more rímur cycles on the same topic were composed in the 18th century, {{one of which is}} preserved. In the 19th century, the popular poet Sigurður Breiðfjörð composed yet another rímur cycle on the battle, based on the account in Mesta.|$|E

At the same time, the certainty of the old biblical paradise began to slip from the grasp of thinkers into the realms of mythology.

5|$|Antoinism {{believes}} in a dualistic universe {{composed of a}} spiritual world governed by the law of God or consciousness, and of a corporal world, governed by natural laws, in which matter is an illusion perceived by <b>the</b> <b>imagination</b> generated by intelligence.

In Antoinist views, the importance of human laws and science is weakened as they are based not on consciousness, but on intelligence.

The idea that people could be lifted from the ground to fly and return safely fired <b>the</b> <b>imagination</b> of the public, and the novelty of balloon ascents continued to draw large crowds through the 1860s and 1870s.

Social associations and <b>the</b> moral <b>imagination</b> [...] Chapter Eight. Politics and <b>the</b> moral <b>imagination</b> [...] Conclusion. This thesis is a comprehensive investigation of Russell Kirk’s doctrine of <b>the</b> Moral <b>Imagination.</b> It focuses especially {{on the nature of}} <b>the</b> Moral <b>Imagination</b> as integrative and non-reductionist, or what Kirk sometimes describes as illative. It explores Kirk’s development of this concept as one through which the individual can grasp his fully human nature and dignity, and which makes use of all the important areas of human social interactions and all the human faculties of knowing, providing man with immersive moral knowledge and support. The thesis is significant for its unique focus on Kirk’s Christian humanist influences – especially T. S. Eliot, Christopher Dawson, G. K. Chesterton, and C. S. Lewis. The aim is to understand Kirk’s attempt to develop the concept of a normative imagination that avoids reductionism in understanding man’s moral life, by presenting a unified vision that neglects no important aspects of man’s life, being, and social interactions. The thesis also aims to explore the norms that Kirk believes it is the purpose of <b>the</b> Moral <b>Imagination</b> to apprehend and to structure human life. This contribution is clarified through comparing Kirk’s use of the concept of the moral or normative imagination to recent use of the concept by writers such as Martha Nussbaum and David Bromwich. This thesis also contrasts Kirk’s vision of <b>the</b> Moral <b>Imagination</b> with <b>the</b> kind of sceptical conservatism exemplified in the writings of Michael Oakeshott. The aim of this comparison is to discover whether Kirk’s theory of <b>the</b> Moral <b>Imagination</b> can overcome <b>the</b> limitations of a conservatism that rejects the role of universal norms and purposes in politics and constructs its conservatism only on the foundation of avoiding rapid and incautious change.

The state includes many historically strong industries, such as banking and insurance, which accounts for 8% of the gross state product, motor vehicle manufacturing, research and development, and steel production, accounting for 14-17% of the nation's raw output. More traditional industries include agriculture, employing one out of seven Ohioans, and new and developing sectors include bioscience, green, information, and food processing industries.

5|$|The {{themes of}} Reflections are {{connected}} to Coleridge's The Eolian Harp as the scene for both is the same.

Both poems also describe Coleridge's relationship with his wife and feelings of sexual desire. <b>The</b> <b>imagination</b> aspects of the poem represent an unwillingness to accept nature on its own and rejects the conclusion of The Eolian Harp. Although the land of Clevedon can bring one closer to God, one cannot just simply exist in such an area but must seek out truth.|$|E

5|$|During {{the early}} 20th century, Bosch's work enjoyed a popular resurrection. The early surrealists' fascination with dreamscapes, the {{autonomy}} of <b>the</b> <b>imagination,</b> and a free-flowing connection to the unconscious brought about {{a renewed interest in}} his work. Bosch's imagery struck a chord with Joan Miró and Salvador Dalí in particular. Both knew his paintings firsthand, having seen The Garden of Earthly Delights in the Museo del Prado, and both regarded him as an art-historical mentor. Miró's The Tilled Field contains several parallels to Bosch's Garden: similar flocks of birds; pools from which living creatures emerge; and oversize disembodied ears all echo the Dutch master's work. Dalí's 1929 The Great Masturbator is similar to an image {{on the right side of}} the left panel of Bosch's Garden, composed of rocks, bushes and little animals resembling a face with a prominent nose and long eyelashes.|$|E
