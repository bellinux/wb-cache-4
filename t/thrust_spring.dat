40|$|Part I: Stratigraphic {{constraints}} {{on the number of}} discrete neoproterozoic glaciations and the relationship between glaciation and ediacaran evolution. Stratigraphic and structural observations in the Death Valley region provide new insights into two topical problems. First, stratigraphic observations provide {{a better understanding of the}} number of discrete Neoproterozoic glaciations and the relationship between glaciation and the diversification of the first animals. Detailed stratigraphic investigations reveal incised valleys within the Neoproterozoic Johnnie Formation. The size (> 150 m) and regional extent of the valleys, and the carbon isotope signature of underlying carbonates show that the valleys are probably glacioeustatic in origin. The incised valleys help to complete the Neoproterozoic glacial record in the western United States. The incised valleys and a pair of glacial diamictites in the underlying Kingston Peak Formation represent two to three discrete Neoproterozoic glaciations. This record of two to three glaciations matches the global Neoproterozoic glacial record. The incised valleys provide the youngest evidence for large-scale Neoproterozoic glaciation in the western United States. Correlation of the Johnnie valleys with incised valleys in the uppermost Caddy Canyon Formation of Idaho and Utah shows that this glaciation occurred before 580 Ma. These findings suggest that diverse Ediacaran faunas post-date the youngest major Neoproterozoic glaciation by tens of millions of years. Second, structural and stratigraphic observations provide new {{constraints on}} the magnitude of extension in the Death Valley extended domain. These observations reveal a thrust fault in the northwestern Spring Mountains, NV. Correlation of this thrust fault with thrusts in other ranges constrains the translation of those ranges relative to the Spring Mountains. While these correlations are not unique, the most plausible correlations require large-magnitude extension in the Death Valley area and north of Las Vegas Valley. Correlation of contractile structures in the northwestern Spring Mountains and Specter Range with Permo-Triassic structures in the Cottonwood Mountains may provide a link between the Permo-Triassic thrust belt in the Cottonwood Mountains and the Central Nevada thrust belt. The Central Nevada thrust belt may be at least in part Permo-Triassic in age, and may represent a foreland fold and thrust belt which developed inboard of the Golconda allochthon during its emplacement. Part II: The Kwichup <b>Spring</b> <b>thrust</b> in the northwestern Spring Mountains, Nevada : implications for large-magitude extension and the structure of the Cordilleran thrust belt. Approximately 170 km(2) of new mapping in the northwestern Spring Mountains reveals contractile structures related to a regional thrust fault called the Kwichup <b>Spring</b> <b>thrust.</b> The Kwichup <b>Spring</b> <b>thrust</b> involves at least 1. 4 km of stragraphic throw. Along much of its length, the Kwichup <b>Spring</b> <b>thrust</b> has been reactivated or excised by a normal fault. Stratigraphic and structural evidence suggest that the Kwichup <b>Spring</b> <b>thrust</b> correlates with the Montgomery thrust in the Montgomery Mountains. Correlation of these two thrusts requres a reappraisal of the geometry of the Cordilleran thrust belt in Nevada and southeastern California. The Kwichup <b>Spring</b> - Montgomery <b>thrust</b> probably correlates with either the Clery thrust in the Funeral Mountains or the Panamint thrust in the Panamint Mountains. Both possible correlations require large (> 115 km) west-northwest translation of the Panamint and Cottonwood Mountains with respect to the Spring Mountains during Neogene extension. Before this large-scale translation, the Panamint and Cottonwood Mountains were positioned along the southern projection of the Central Nevada thrust belt of Taylor and others (1993). Since contractile structures in the Cottonwood Mountains are Permo-Triassic, the Central Nevada thrust belt may be at least in part Permo-Triassic. ...|$|R

40|$|SYNOPSIS. Animals {{can lower}} the {{metabolic}} cost of swimming by using appropriately tuned, elastic springs. Jet-powered invertebrates use springs that lie in functional parallel to their swimming muscles to power half the locomotor cycle. The parallel geometry constrains the spring to be non-linearly elastic; muscle power is diverted {{to load the}} spring only when swimming muscles are not capable of producing maximal hydro-dynamic <b>thrust.</b> The <b>springs</b> of jellyfish and scallops are forced at or near their resonant frequency, producing large energy savings. Measuring the contribution of elastic energy storage to jet-powered locomotion has been facilitated by the relatively simple geometries of invertebrate locomotor systems. In contrast, complex musculoskeletal systems and kinematics have complicated the study of springs in swimming vertebrates. Skins, tendons and axial skeletons of some vertebrate swimmers have appropri-ate mechanical properties to act as springs. To date, though, there exist {{just a handful of}} studies that have investigated the mechanical behaviors of these locomotor structures in swimming vertebrates, and these data have yet to be integrated with measures of swimming power. Integrating mechanical, kinematic, hydrodynamic and metabolic data are required to understand more fully the role of elastic springs in vertebrate swimming energetics...|$|R

40|$|The Blackrock Canyon {{area in the}} {{southern}} White Pine Range, Nevada mostly consists of the highly extended upper plate of a low-angle normal fault, the Blackrock fault. The post- 31. 3 Ma Blackrock fault places upper Paleozoic sedimentary rocks and overlying Tertiary volcanic rocks of the Garret Ranch Group in its hangingwall against a 50 degrees E-dipping homocline of Cambrian through Mississippian rocks in its footwall. The 15 to 30 degrees W-dipping Blackrock fault is non-planar and consists of two fault segments and a pronounced corrugation, the Bull Spring corrugation. These geometric irregularities suggest the slip direction on the fault was east-southeast or west-northwest. Additional geometric data such as dips of footwall strata and bedding-to-fault angles constrain the slip direction to west-northwest. This movement of the upper plate over the irregular Blackrock fault resulted in non-conservative deformation within the hanging wall block. Blackrock upper plate faults with diverse attitudes are approximately synchronous and orthorhombically symmetrical. Classical Andersonian conjugate faulting theory, which employs two-dimensional (plane) strain cannot explain these geometric and temporal fault relationships. Rather, {{these data suggest that}} non-conjugate processes generated these faults and that they represent three-dimensional or non-plane strain. A kinematic model, which invokes movement of the hangingwall block over a geometrically irregular detachment, explains the non-conservative, three-dimensional deformation observed in the Blackrock upper plate. In the Blackrock upper plate, Blackrock-related faults cut and Tertiary volcanic rocks cover Mesozoic contractile structures. Restored and retrodeformable cross sections allow the reconstruction of the pre-extensional structures. They indicate that normal movement on the Blackrock fault tectonically denuded and disrupted Mesozoic folds and a previously unrecognized thrust fault, which is here named the White Pine thrust. A restored and retrodeformable cross section across the Pancake Range, Duckwater Hills, and the White Pine Range reveals large-scale folds and thrust faults {{that are part of the}} central Nevada thrust belt. These structures correlate with previously reported folds and thrust faults that crop out in surrounding areas and consist of the Pancake <b>thrust,</b> McClure <b>Spring</b> syncline, Duckwater <b>thrust,</b> and the Easy Ridge or Green <b>Springs</b> <b>thrust</b> (Pipkin, 1956; Humphrey, 1960; Nolan and others, 1974; Perry and Dixon, 1993; Carpenter and others, 1993). This regional step-wise balanced and restored cross section, for the first time, allows (1) documentation of central Nevada thrust belt geometry across northern Railroad Valley and (2) examination of Tertiary extensional structural styles and the distribution of extension across this pan of the belt. Together these findings suggest that northern Railroad Valley is an excellent petroleum prospect...|$|R
40|$|The HYDROS {{thruster}} uses a novel hybrid electrical/chemical propulsion {{scheme to}} enable CubeSates and other secondary payloads to perform missions requiring orbit agility and large ∆Vs while launching with an inert, unpressurized, non-toxic propellant: water. The HYDROS thruster splits the water propellant on-orbit using electrical power to produce {{hydrogen and oxygen}} gas. The evolved gases are then combusted in a bipropellant thruster to provide hight-thrust propulsion or utilized as cold gas to provide minimum impulse-bit thrust events. The addition of a larger gas volume to the current engineering test unit has allowed for more robust operation of the electrolyzer and longer thrust events. The parallel development of a torsional <b>spring</b> <b>thrust</b> stand allows for increased thrust and impulse measurement accuracy. Utilizing these tools we have conducted a detailed characterization of the electrolyzer and thruster performance. The electrolyzer characterization effort has demonstrated that the electrolyzer provides consistent and efficient performance across the range of upstream and downstream pressures and has demonstrated that electrolyzer wetting is the key predictor of electrolyzer performance. The thruster characterization effort has demonstrated high thrust (300 - 600 mN) performance and provided insight into potential design improvements moving forward...|$|R
40|$|A torsional-type thrust stand {{has been}} {{designed}} and built to test Pulsed Plasma Thrusters (PPT's) in both single shot and repetitive operating modes. Using this stand, momentum per pulse was determined strictly {{as a function of}} <b>thrust</b> stand deflection, <b>spring</b> constant, and natural frequency. No empirical corrections were required. The accuracy of the method was verified using a swinging impact pendulum. Momentum transfer data between the thrust stand and the pendulum were consistent to within 1 %. Following initial calibrations, the stand was used to test a Lincoln Experimental Satellite (LES- 8 / 9) thruster. The LES- 8 / 9 system had a mass of approximately 7. 5 kg, with a nominal thrust to weight ratio of 1. 3 x 10 (exp - 5). A total of 34 single shot thruster pulses were individually measured. The average impulse bit per pulse was 266 microN-s, which was slightly less than the value of 300 microN-s published in previous reports on this device. Repetitive pulse measurements were performed similar to ordinary steady-state thrust measurements. The thruster was operated for 30 minutes at a repetition rate of 132 pulses per minute and yielded an average thrust of 573 microN. Using average thrust, the average impulse bit per pulse was estimated to be 260 microN-s, which was in agreement with the single shot data. Zero drift during the repetitive pulse test was found to be approximately 1 % of the measured thrust...|$|R

"May, 2012 "Deformation along the southeastern margin of the Wind River Mountains during the late stages of the Laramide orogeny is a result of local ~N-S Laramide shortening, which is in contrast to the regional NE-SW shortening typical in the Laramide orogen. The shortening resulted in the reactivation of Precambrian brittle structures that are concentrated north of the region where the trend of the Wind River thrust changes from its typical NW-SE trend to a more E-W trend. The Spring Creek fault (SCF) is an ENE-trending feature that extends from the Archean core of the range across Paleozoic and Mesozoic units deformed in Sheep Mountain anticline (SMA). Laramide reactivation of the Spring Creek fault produced reverse, south-side-up offset and steep to overturned sections of the Tensleep Sandstone and Madison Limestone on the hanging wall of the fault. The Beaver Creek thrust (BCT), just south of the Spring Creek fault, is a largely E-W trending, northerly dipping Laramide fault that terminates at the Spring Creek fault. It is the controlling fault along the southern margin of the Schoettlin Mountain anticline (ScMA), which is cored by Archean granitic gneiss. Results from mapping, structural analysis, fracture analysis, and 2 D seismic experiments all show consistent late-stage ~N-S Laramide compression throughout the area. The ~E-W orientations of the Beaver Creek <b>thrust</b> and the <b>Spring</b> Creek fault, parallel to the ~E-W trace of the Wind River thrust to the south, are interpreted as late-stage hanging wall deformation above the Wind River thrust...|$|R
