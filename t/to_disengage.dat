5|$|Five minutes later, the Allied ships spotted {{clouds of}} smoke {{on the horizon}} and Acton ordered the Italian ships to attack shortly {{afterwards}} while the two British cruisers turned {{to cut off the}} two Austrian destroyers. Aquila opened fire at 08:15 at long range, but inflicted no damage before she was immobilised by a hit at 08:32 that detonated inside her central boiler room and severed her main steam pipe.

5|$|Initially, the {{division}} did not fare well, though it improved quickly. Its anti-aircraft and armor assets {{were used as}} mobile artillery, which continuously pounded Chinese positions. The 45th, in turn, was under constant artillery and mortar attack. It also conducted constant small-unit patrols along the border seeking to engage Chinese outposts or patrols. These small-unit actions made {{up the majority of}} {{the division}}'s combat in Korea. Chinese troops were well dug-in and better trained than the troops of the inexperienced 45th, and it suffered casualties and frequently had <b>to</b> <b>disengage</b> when it was attacked.|$|E
5|$|On 13 February, having fought three {{successful}} {{actions in}} three days against the Prussian and Russian army at Champaubert, Montmirail and Château-Thierry, Napoleon was pursuing the defeated enemy. After his consecutive defeats, Field-marshal Blücher decided <b>to</b> <b>disengage</b> from Napoleon and move a significant force against the isolated French Army Corps of Marshal Marmont, at Étoges. Blücher knew that Marmont's Corps was weak and his plan was to destroy it and thus fall upon the rear of Napoleon's main force.|$|E
5|$|Oryol {{took the}} lead after Borodino was sunk; she was joined by Nebogatov's Second Division after Tōgō ordered the Japanese battleships <b>to</b> <b>disengage</b> in the {{gathering}} darkness. Nebogatov assumed command of {{the remains of the}} fleet and they continued towards Vladivostok. The ships were discovered by the Japanese early the following morning and attacked by Tōgō's battleships around 10:00. The faster Japanese ships stayed beyond the range at which Nebogatov's ships could effectively reply and he decided to surrender his ships at 10:30 as he could neither return fire nor close the range.|$|E

5|$|Prince of Wales {{was forced}} <b>to</b> <b>disengage</b> by a {{combination}} of damage from German hits and mechanical failures in her guns and turrets after Hood was sunk. Despite these problems, she had hit Bismarck three times.

Bismarck was temporarily able to evade detection, but was later spotted and sunk by the British on 27 May.|$|E
5|$|Still {{enduring}} is {{the debate}} {{as to why}} Voss chose to fight on against clearly almost impossible odds rather than disengage from the action. However, {{it is possible that}} he wanted to close the kill gap between himself and the Red Baron, by shooting down some British aircraft, so he stayed on. Although Voss's apparent refusal to retreat is not mentioned in the contemporary English combat reports, nor in McCudden's autobiography written in June and July 1918, McCudden is credited with the observation that Voss seemingly rejected several opportunities <b>to</b> <b>disengage</b> and withdraw from the tactically grave situation in which he found himself. In 1942 Hector Bolitho and James Ira Thomas Jones received letters from both Chidlaw-Roberts and Bowman concerning their recall of Voss's last stand. Bowman read and savaged the Chidlaw-Roberts account for its inaccuracies, although his own account had obvious errors. At the same time Bowman also stated that he believed Voss had an opportunity <b>to</b> <b>disengage</b> and save himself, but had deliberately chosen instead to fight in spite of the overwhelmingly unequal situation with which he was faced. This is the earliest positively identified historical source for the assertion that Voss rejected chances for a safe retreat that were open to him. The dogfight remains a subject of debate and controversy among combat aviation historians and interested parties.|$|E
5|$|Unlike Hans-Joachim Marseille, {{who was a}} {{marksman}} {{and expert}} {{in the art of}} deflection shooting, Hartmann was a master of stalk-and-ambush tactics.

5|$|A Japanese convoy {{approaching}} Endau {{was detected}} by reconnaissance aircraft on 26 January and was ineffectually attacked multiple times by Allied aircraft as it was landing its troops. The Allies suffered heavy casualties, while the Japanese lost only a single aircraft. The Royal Navy committed two destroyers later that day {{to break up the}} Japanese landings, despite the much larger Japanese escort force. Sailing under the cover of darkness, they were able to locate the convoy anchored there without being detected, but could not find the troopships in the darkness. The ships attempted <b>to</b> <b>disengage,</b> but were fired upon by the convoy's escorts and one destroyer was sunk {{in the early morning hours}} of 27 January.|$|E
5|$|After Re d'Italia sank, the Italian fleet began <b>to</b> <b>disengage,</b> {{with the}} badly burning Palestro {{trailing}} behind, {{soon to be}} destroyed by a magazine explosion. Persano broke off the engagement, and though his ships still outnumbered the Austrians, he refused to counter-attack with his badly demoralized forces. In addition, the fleet was low on coal and ammunition. The Italian fleet began to withdraw, followed by the Austrians; Tegetthoff, having gotten the better of the action, kept his distance {{so as not to}} risk his success. As night began to fall, the opposing fleets disengaged completely, heading for Ancona and Pola, respectively.|$|E
5|$|After nearly 40 {{minutes of}} brutal, close-quarters fighting, {{the two sides}} broke contact and ceased fire at 02:26, after Abe and Captain Gilbert Hoover (the captain of Helena and senior {{surviving}} U.S. officer) ordered their respective forces <b>to</b> <b>disengage.</b> Admiral Abe had one battleship (Kirishima), one light cruiser (Nagara), and four destroyers (Asagumo, Teruzuki, Yukikaze, and Harusame) with only light damage and four destroyers (Inazuma, Ikazuchi, Murasame, and Samidare) with moderate damage. The U.S. had only one light cruiser (Helena) and one destroyer (Fletcher) that were still capable of effective resistance. Although perhaps unclear to Abe, the way was now clear for him to bombard Henderson Field and finish off the U.S. naval forces in the area, thus allowing the troops and supplies to be landed safely on Guadalcanal.|$|E

5|$|At the {{beginning}} of 1814, the armies of the French Empire, under the direct command of Emperor Napoleon I, were scrambling to defend Eastern France against the invading Coalition Armies. Despite fighting against vastly superior forces, Napoleon managed to score a few significant victories and, between 10 and 13 February repeatedly beat Blücher’s Army of Silesia. On 13 February, reeling from his successive defeats, Blücher looked <b>to</b> <b>disengage</b> from Napoleon and instead manoeuvre with {{a part of his}} forces to fall upon the isolated VI Corps of Marshal Auguste de Marmont, who was defending Napoleon’s rear. The Prussian commander attacked and pushed back Marmont late on 13 February. Nevertheless, the Emperor had read into his enemy’s intentions and directed powerful forces to support Marmont.|$|E
5|$|By 20:00, Scheer {{ordered the}} German line to {{complete}} a 180-degree turn eastward <b>to</b> <b>disengage</b> from the British fleet.

As a result, Kaiserin had to remain out of line and could not return to her assigned position. The turn reversed the order of the German line; Kaiserin was now the seventh ship {{from the rear of the}} German line. At around 23:30, the German fleet reorganized into the night cruising formation. Kaiserin was the eleventh ship, in the center of the 24-ship line.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{embodied}} performance of 'doing citizen science'. It examines how 'citizen scientists' produce scientifi c data using {{the resources available}} to them, and how their socio-Technical practices and emotions impact {{the construction of a}} crowdsourced data infrastructure. We found that conducting citizen science is highly emotional and experiential, but these individual experiences and feelings tend to get lost or become invisible when user-contributed data are aggregated and integrated into a big data infrastructure. While new meanings can be extracted from big data sets, the loss of individual emotional and practical elements denotes the loss of data provenance and the marginalisation of individual eff orts, motivations, and local politics, which might lead <b>to</b> <b>disengaged</b> participants, and unsustainable communities of citizen scientists. The challenges of constructing a data infrastructure for crowdsourced data therefore lie in the management of both technical and social issues which are local as well as global...|$|R
