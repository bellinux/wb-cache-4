40|$|In 2005 Deloitte Research {{released}} a paper examining the phenomenon {{they refer to}} as the ‘Innovation Paradox’, the inability or reluctance of manufacturing firms to pursue the strategies that build the operational capabilities necessary for innovation that will provide both profitability and growth. The report claims that {{this is due to the}} rapidly increasing complexity of global markets and the lack of synchronising innovation efforts across their value chain, thus positing the problem as a 21 st century issue. While the research did not target the small and medium enterprises specifically, the implications for the business sector are apparent given their substantial contribution to global economies and their high failure rates in the first three to five years of operation. While the researchers do not question the data contained in the Deloitt’s research, this paper does question the assumption that the phenomenon is irreversible and the apparent underlying self fulfilling prophecy with respect to Small to Medium Enterprises. To demonstrate this the authors draw on a case study of a small manufacturing company in rural New South Wales, Australia, operating between 1889 and 1983 to show that the breaking of the innovation paradox was successfully achieved by this firm in the late 19 th and early 20 th century. Applying the case <b>study</b> to <b>the</b> <b>Deloitte</b> model, <b>the</b> authors overlay the history of Joseph Laycock and Son on the various success factors, and problems, identified in <b>the</b> <b>Deloitte’s</b> <b>study</b> to demonstrate temporal similarities or differences...|$|R

The four proposals selected for further consideration included a revised proposal for the Hundertwasser Arts Centre (renamed Hundertwasser Wairau Maori Art Centre) by a newly formed trust called Prosper Northland. The proposal was backed up by a new feasibility study which affirmed <b>the</b> original <b>Deloitte's</b> <b>study</b> {{and said it was}} based on conservative figures. One of the other proposals withdrew in support of the HWMAC proposal leaving a short-list of three. Under the new proposal Prosper Northland commit to finding all funding except for the earthquake strengthening. Whangarei District Council staff analysis states that [...] "Overall staff considers the HWMAC proposal to be about economic development while on balance the other three are more about enhancing Sense of Place and telling our story". A public meeting to present the HWMAC proposal was attended by over 1000 supporters ...|$|R
