25|$|The {{constitutionality}} of Social Security is intricately {{linked to the}} evolving nature of Supreme Court jurisprudence on federal power (the 20th century saw {{a dramatic increase in}} allowed congressional action). When Social Security was first passed, there were significant questions over its constitutionality as the Court had found another pension scheme, the original Railroad Retirement Act, to violate the due process clause of the Fifth Amendment. Some, such as University of Chicago law professor Richard Epstein and Harvard University professor Robert Nozick, have argued <b>that</b> <b>Social</b> <b>Security</b> should be unconstitutional.|$|E
5000|$|The opinion argued <b>that</b> the <b>Social</b> <b>Security</b> tax {{application}} was problematic as it [...] "singled out then-sitting federal judges for unfavorable treatment".

40|$|On March 17, 2003, the {{trustees}} of the <b>Social</b> <b>Security</b> program released their annual report on the system's financial status. Many observers took the report's extension of the trust fund's solvency one year to 2042 to mean <b>that</b> <b>Social</b> <b>Security's</b> financial health had improved. In fact, <b>Social</b> <b>Security's</b> actuarial balance declined and its cash flow deficits over the next 75 years increased to $ 25. 33 trillion (in 2003 dollars). More important, the report contained significant new methodologies that {{are central to the}} debate over personal retirement accounts. The trustees now measure <b>Social</b> <b>Security's</b> deficits over the infinite horizon, providing remedies to the previous 75 -year scoring window that substantially understates the costs of the current program and overstates the costs of personal account plans. Under this new perpetuity benchmark, the present value of <b>Social</b> <b>Security's</b> cash flow shortfalls totals $ 11. 9 trillion, versus only $ 4. 9 trillion over 75 years. To cover <b>Social</b> <b>Security's</b> cash deficits permanently would demand an immediate tax increase equal to 4. 47 percent of payroll. The 2003 report also includes a "stochastic analysis" accounting for the variability of the economic and demographic factors affecting <b>Social</b> <b>Security's</b> finances, finding there is less than a 1 -in- 40 chance of <b>Social</b> <b>Security</b> remaining solvent for even 75 years without reform. The 2003 Trustees Report shows <b>that</b> <b>Social</b> <b>Security's</b> cash deficits are large, growing, and unlikely to fix themselves without action. Only personal account proposals have been certified to eliminate <b>Social</b> <b>Security's</b> multitrillion dollar cash shortfalls...|$|R
50|$|Some argue <b>that</b> since <b>Social</b> <b>Security</b> {{taxes are}} {{eventually}} returned to taxpayers, with interest, {{in the form}} of <b>Social</b> <b>Security</b> benefits, the regressiveness of the tax is effectively negated. That is, the taxpayer gets back what he or she put into the <b>Social</b> <b>Security</b> system. Others, including The Economist and the Congressional Budget Office, point out <b>that</b> the <b>Social</b> <b>Security</b> system as a whole is progressive in the lower income brackets. Individuals with lower lifetime average wages receive a larger benefit (as both a percentage of their lifetime average wage income and a percentage of <b>Social</b> <b>Security</b> taxes paid) than do individuals with higher lifetime average wages; but for some lower earners, shorter lifetimes may negate the benefits.|$|R

2500|$|Although Social Security is {{sometimes}} compared to private pensions, {{the two systems}} are different {{in a number of}} respects. It has been argued <b>that</b> <b>Social</b> <b>Security</b> is an insurance plan as opposed to a retirement plan. Unlike a pension, for example, Social Security pays disability benefits. A private pension fund accumulates the money paid into it, eventually using those reserves to pay pensions to the workers who contributed to the fund; and a private system is not universal. Social Security cannot [...] "prefund" [...] by investing in marketable assets such as equities, because federal law prohibits it from investing in assets other than those backed by the U.S. government. As a result, its investments to date have been limited to special non-negotiable securities issued by the U.S. Treasury, although some argue that debt issued by the Federal National Mortgage Association and other quasi-governmental organizations could meet legal standards. Social Security cannot by law invest in private equities, although some other countries (such as Canada) and some states permit their pension funds to invest in private equities. As a universal system, Social Security generally operates as a pipeline, through which current tax receipts from workers are used to pay current benefits to retirees, survivors, and the disabled. When there is an excess of taxes withheld over benefits paid, by law this excess is invested in Treasury securities (not in private equities) as described above.|$|E

60|$|But the {{essential}} {{reason is that}} a type of culture came out on top in America and England in the nineteenth century, which cannot {{and would not be}} tolerated on top of the world. To unite all the systems at the top, without improving and simplifying their social organisation below, would be to tie all the tops of the trees together where they rise above a dense and poisonous jungle, and make the jungle darker than before. To create such a cosmopolitan political platform would be to build a roof above our own heads to shut out the sunlight, on which only usurers and conspirators clad in gold could walk about in the sun. This is no moment when industrial intellectualism can inflict such an artificial oppression upon the world. Industrialism itself is coming to see dark days, and its future is very doubtful. It is split from end to end with strikes and struggles for economic life, in which the poor not only plead that they are starving, but even the rich can only plead that they are bankrupt. The peasantries are growing not only more prosperous but more politically effective; the Russian moujik has held up the Bolshevist Government of Moscow and Petersburg; a huge concession has been made by England to Ireland; the League of Nations has decided for Poland against Prussia. It is not certain that industrialism will not wither even in its own field; it is certain that its intellectual ideas {{will not be allowed to}} cover every field; and this sort of cosmopolitan culture is one of its ideas. Industrialism itself may perish; or on the other hand industrialism itself may survive, by some searching and scientific reform that will really guarantee economic security to all. It may really purge itself of the accidental maladies of anarchy and famine; and continue as a machine, but at least as a comparatively clean and humanely shielded machine; at any rate no longer as a man-eating machine. Capitalism may clear itself of its worst corruptions by such reform as is open to it; by creating humane and healthy conditions for labour, and setting the labouring classes to work under a lucid and recognised law. It may make Pittsburg one vast model factory for all who will model themselves upon factories; and may give to all men and women in its employment a clear social status in which they can be contented and secure. And on the day when <b>that</b> <b>social</b> <b>security</b> is established for the masses, when industrial capitalism has achieved this larger and more logical organisation and found peace at last, a strange and shadowy and ironic triumph, like an abstract apology, will surely hover over all those graves in the Wilderness where lay the bones of so many gallant gentlemen; men who had also from their youth known and upheld such a social stratification, who had the courage to call a spade a spade and a slave a slave.|$|E
