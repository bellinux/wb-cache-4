2500|$|In late 2006 {{and early}} 2007, the Zapatistas (through Subcomandante Marcos), {{along with other}} {{indigenous}} peoples of the Americas, announced the Intercontinental Indigenous Encounter. They invited indigenous people from throughout the Americas {{and the rest of}} the world to gather on October 11–14, 2007, near Guaymas, Sonora. The declaration for the conference designated this date because of [...] "515 years since the invasion of ancient Indigenous territories and the onslaught of the war of conquest, spoils and capitalist exploitation". Comandante David said in an interview, [...] "The object of this meeting is to meet one another and to come to know one another’s pains and sufferings. It is <b>to</b> <b>share</b> <b>our</b> experiences, because each tribe is different." ...|$|E

[...] Original racecars from Trans-Am's [...] "golden era" [...] are faithfully restored to original condition, and then [...] "raced" [...] at select events. They are a regular group at historic automobile racing events. In 2010, the Monterey Historic Automobile Races at Mazda Raceway Laguna Seca in Monterey, California paid tribute to the under 2000cc group. On occasion, the Monterey Historics and its former sister event at Sonoma Raceway, also in California, have paid tribute to 1980s Trans-Am cars, often referring to them as [...] "IMSA GTO" [...] cars. In recent years, the Sonoma event has referred to them as [...] "SCCA cars".|$|E

2500|$|Westbrook {{has said}} that the cast and crew became like a second family to her, with the roles in the soap {{mirroring}} their relationships off-screen. In her autobiography she comments, [...] "Sid [...] and I became very close [...] we were as thick as thieves. When we weren't shooting together we'd hang out [...] Once Sid and I got so bored hanging around on set that we decided to take the milk float for a spin around Albert Square, but Sid drove it too fast and turned it over [...] we couldn't stop laughing, but the producers didn't seem <b>to</b> <b>share</b> <b>our</b> amusement. We were seriously told off that day." [...] She has described other actors like Michelle Gayle, Letitia Dean, Adam Woodyatt and Nick Berry like brothers and sisters, and has said she was very close to older cast members such as June Brown, Wendy Richard, Mike Reid and Gillian Taylforth. She has also revealed that her off-screen relationship with actors McFadden and Kemp mirrored her character's on-screen one: [...] "In the soap they were my older brothers, always looking out for me, making sure I didn't get into trouble, and off set they were exactly the same." ...|$|E
2500|$|From {{relatively}} {{early in}} his professional career, Lowell worried {{about the role of}} racial and ethnic minorities in American society. As early as 1887, he wrote of the Irish: [...] "What we need is not to dominate the Irish, but to absorb them.... We want them to become rich, and send their sons to our colleges, <b>to</b> <b>share</b> <b>our</b> prosperity and our sentiments. We do not want to feel that they are among us and yet not really part of us." [...] He believed that only a homogeneous society could safeguard the achievements of American democracy. Sometime before 1906, he became an honorary vice-president of the Immigration Restriction League, an organization that promoted literacy tests and tightened enforcement of immigration laws. In 1910, he wrote approvingly in private of excluding Chinese immigrants entirely and of Southern states that denied the franchise to black citizens. Publicly he consistently adopted assimilation as the solution to absorbing other groups, limiting their numbers to levels he believed would allow American society to absorb them without being changed itself, a stance that [...] "fused liberal and racist ideas in making the case for exclusion." ...|$|E
2500|$|Chamberlain {{joined the}} Nazi Party {{and contributed to}} its publications. Its primary journal, the Völkischer Beobachter {{dedicated}} five columns to praising him on his 70th birthday, describing The Foundations as the [...] "gospel of the National Socialist movement." [...] In January 1924, Chamberlain published an essay praising Hitler {{as one of the}} [...] "rare beautiful beings...a man of genuine simplicity with a fascinating gaze", whose words [...] "always come directly from the heart". Chamberlain praised Hitler for embarking upon a [...] "Vernichtungskrieg" [...] ("war of destruction") against all of Germany's enemies. Chamberlain further wrote about Hitler-whom he viewed as the greatest of all his heroes-that:Because he [...] is no mere phrasemonger, but consistently pursues his thought to an end and draws his conclusions from it, he recognizes and proclaims that one cannot simultaneously embrace Jesus and those that crucified him. That is the splendid thing about Hitler-his courage!...In this respect he reminds one of Luther. And whence come the courage of these two men? It derives from the holy seriousness each has for the cause! Hitler utters no word he does not mean in earnest; his speeches contain no padding or vague, provisional statements...but the result of this is that he is decried as a visionary dreamer. People consider Hitler a dreamer whose head is full of impossible schemes and yet a renowned and original historian called him [...] "the most creative mind since Bismarck in the area of statecraft". I believe...we are all inclined to view those things as impractical that we do not already see accomplished before us. He, for example, finds it impossible <b>to</b> <b>share</b> <b>our</b> conviction about the pernicious, even murderous influence of Jewry on the German Volk and not to take action; if one sees the danger, then steps must be taken against it with utter dispatch. I daresay everyone recognizes this, but nobody risks speaking out; nobody ventures to extract the consequences of his thoughts for his actions; nobody except Hitler...This man has worked like a divine blessing, cheering hearts, opening men's eyes to clearly seen goals, enlivening their spirits, kindling their capacity for love and for indignation, hardening their courage and resoluteness. Yet we still need him badly: May God who sent him to us preserve him for many years as a [...] "blessing for the German Fatherland!".|$|E
