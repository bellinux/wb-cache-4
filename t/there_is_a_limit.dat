25|$|The oxide {{forms on}} the surface of the tantalum, but it also grows into the material. For each unit {{thickness}} of oxide growth, one third grows out and two thirds grows in.

25|$|S visas are nonimmigrant visas {{issued to}} {{individuals}} who have assisted law enforcement as a witness or informant. <b>There</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>limit</b> of 200 S visas a year.

25|$|Experimental {{research}} for treatment has been mostly focused on facial synkinesis {{due to its}} abundant prevalence compared to extra-ocular synkinesis. Additionally, since the extra-ocular muscles are hidden within the orbits, <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>limit</b> {{on the type of}} practical treatments that can be established (e.g. massage). Treatments for synkinesis in general include facial retraining, biofeedback, mime therapy, and Botox and surgery, as a last resort.|$|E

25|$|The {{variability}} of production {{from a single}} wind turbine can be high. Combining any additional number of turbines (for example, in a wind farm) results in lower statistical variation, {{as long as the}} correlation between the output of each turbine is imperfect, and the correlations are always imperfect due to the distance between each turbine. Similarly, geographically distant wind turbines or wind farms have lower correlations, reducing overall variability. Since wind power is dependent on weather systems, <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>limit</b> to the benefit of this geographic diversity for any power system.|$|E
25|$|Another {{theory that}} is being {{examined}} to explain age related declines in working memory is that <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>limit</b> in attentional resources seen as we age. This means that older individuals are less capable of dividing their attention between two tasks, and thus tasks with higher attentional demands {{are more difficult to}} complete due to a reduction in mental energy. Tasks that are simple and more automatic, however, see fewer declines as we age. Working memory tasks often involve divided attention, thus {{they are more likely to}} strain the limited resources of aging individuals.|$|E
25|$|In microeconomics, the Bertrand–Edgeworth {{model of}} price-setting {{oligopoly}} looks at {{what happens when}} there is a homogeneous product (i.e. consumers want to buy from the cheapest seller) where <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>limit</b> to the output of firms which they are willing and able to sell at a particular price. This differs from the Bertrand competition model where it is assumed that firms are willing and able to meet all demand. The limit to output can be considered as a physical capacity constraint which is the same at all prices (as in Edgeworth’s work), or to vary with price under other assumptions.|$|E

Personal watercraft are not allowed on any lakes. Canoes, kayaks and sail boats are allowed on all waters.|$|E
25|$|In the United States, {{the company}} {{provides}} a monthly flat-fee for DVD and Blu-ray rentals. A subscriber creates a rental queue, a list, of films to rent. The films are delivered individually via the United States Postal Service from regional warehouses.

To rent a new disc, the subscriber must return the previous disc in a metered reply mail envelope. Upon receipt, Netflix ships the next available disc in the subscriber's rental queue.|$|E
25|$|Lynn and Harvey {{have argued}} that the causes of the above are {{difficult}} to interpret since these countries have had significant recent immigration from countries with lower average national IQs. Nevertheless, they expect that similar patterns will occur, or have occurred, first in other developed nations and then in the developing world as <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>limit</b> to how much environmental factors can improve intelligence. Furthermore, during the last century there is a negative correlation between fertility and intelligence although there is not yet any conclusive evidence of the association between the two. They estimate {{that there has been a}} dysgenic decline in the world's genotypic IQ (masked by the Flynn effect for the phenotype) of 0.86 IQ points per decade for the years 1950–2000.|$|E

25|$|The P54C was {{followed}} by the P54CQS which operated at 120MHz. It was fabricated in a 0.35µm BiCMOS process and was the first commercial microprocessor to be fabricated in a 0.35µm process. Its transistor count is identical to the P54C and, despite the newer process, it had an identical die area as well. The chip was connected to the package using wire bonding, which only allows connections along the edges of the chip. A smaller chip would have required a redesign of the package, as <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>limit</b> on the length of the wires and the edges of the chip would be further away from the pads on the package. The solution was to keep the chip the same size, retain the existing pad-ring, and only reduce the size of the Pentium's logic circuitry to enable it to achieve higher clock frequencies.|$|E
25|$|Chemical {{forms of}} {{nitrogen}} {{are most often}} of concern with regard to eutrophication, because plants have high nitrogen requirements so that additions of nitrogen compounds will stimulate plant growth. Nitrogen is not readily available in soil because N2, a gaseous form of nitrogen, is very stable and unavailable directly to higher plants. Terrestrial ecosystems rely on microbial nitrogen fixation to convert N2 into other forms such as nitrates. However, <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>limit</b> to how much nitrogen can be utilized. Ecosystems receiving more nitrogen than the plants require are called nitrogen-saturated. Saturated terrestrial ecosystems then can contribute both inorganic and organic nitrogen to freshwater, coastal, and marine eutrophication, where nitrogen is also typically a limiting nutrient. This {{is also the case}} with increased levels of phosphorus. However, because phosphorus is generally much less soluble than nitrogen, it is leached from the soil at a much slower rate than nitrogen. Consequently, phosphorus is much more important as a limiting nutrient in aquatic systems.|$|E
25|$|Probably no one {{living in}} the eighth century would have {{predicted}} that the great Mercian empire would be destroyed and that the West Saxons with their poor track record for feuds and infighting within the royal house would emerge as the dominant kingdom in the ninth century. The nobility {{under the influence of}} Alfred became involved with developing the cultural life of their kingdom. As the kingdom became one they brought the monastic and spiritual life of the kingdom under one rule and stricter control. However the Anglo-Saxons believed in 'luck' as a random element in the affairs of man and so would probably have agreed that <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>limit</b> to the extent one can understand why one kingdom failed while another succeeded. They also believed in 'destiny' and interpreted the fate of the kingdom of England with Biblical and Carolingian ideology, with parallels, between the Israelites, the great European empires and the Anglo-Saxons. Danish and Norman conquests were just the manner in which God punished his sinful people and the fate of great empires.|$|E

500|$|Tropical {{cyclones}} tend {{to develop}} during the summer, {{but have been}} noted in nearly every month in most basins.

[...] <b>There</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>limit</b> on tropical cyclone intensity which is strongly related to the water temperatures along its path. [...] An average of 86 tropical cyclones of tropical storm intensity form annually worldwide.

500|$|General {{inpatient}} care is an intensive {{level of care}} which may be provided in a nursing home, a specially contracted hospice bed or unit in a hospital, or in a free-standing hospice unit.
