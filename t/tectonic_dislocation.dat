50|$|Gotha is {{situated}} in a flat landscape within the fertile Thuringian Basin. A <b>tectonic</b> <b>dislocation</b> traverses the city from north-west to south-east. Thereby, it forms three prominent hills: the 431 m high Krahnberg with the Ratsholz forest in the north-west, the hill of Friedenstein Castle in the city centre and the 409 m high Seeberg in the south-east. The city itself lies at an elevation of 300 m and the municipal territory is nearly free of forest (with the two named mountains as exceptions) and is in intensive agricultural use. As one out of only very few ancient cities in Germany, Gotha is not situated on a river, so that water supply was already {{a problem in the}} Middle Ages. For that reason, the Leinakanal was built in the 14th century over a distance of more than 25 kilometres, which was at the time an enormous task. The Leinakanal brings water from Hörsel and Apfelstädt river to Gotha, overcoming the watershed between Elbe (Apfelstädt) and Weser (Gotha). The drain of Leinakanal is the Flutgraben, a tributary of Nesse. The Thuringian Forest is located 15 km south-west of Gotha.|$|E

40|$|The {{ultimate}} {{composition of}} any sandstone {{is affected by}} a host of primary and secondary factors, including the lithologies present in source terranes, climate, depositional environment and diagenesis. In the case of a subduction complex, however, unequivocal identification of detrital provenance may be impossible because of the cumulative effects of tectonic and sedimentary transport. Long-distance sedimentary transport (> 1000 km) is common within trenches, and abyssal-plain turbidites can be tectonically transported for long distances as the underlying oceanic basement drifts towards a subduction front. Post-accretionary displacement can occur as a consequence of strike-slip faulting, and the total distance of <b>tectonic</b> <b>dislocation</b> may reach several thousand kilometers. The present-day Aleutian forearc region (North Pacific Ocean) illustrates many of the "problems" which typify subduction zones. Several petrologic suites can be identified, and there are significant variations in detrital modes in both time and space. The Aleutian region serves as a sobering modern analog for accreted rock units such as the Franciscan Complex of California, where intercalations of discrete sandstone suites have been noted. In the absence of paleomagnetic control, interpretations of sediment provenance within ancient subduction complexes probably should be restricted to the generic level...|$|E
40|$|Tunnels are {{believed}} to be rather ""insensitive"" to earthquakes. Although a number of case histories seem to favor such an argument, failures and collapses of underground structures in the earthquakes of Kobe (1995), Düzce-Bolu (1999), and Taiwan (1999) have shown that there are exceptions to this ""rule"". Among them: the case of tunnels crossed by fault rupture. This paper presents the analysis and design of two highway cut-and-cover tunnels in Greece against large <b>tectonic</b> <b>dislocation</b> from a normal fault. The analysis, conducted with finite elements, places particular emphasis on realistically modeling the tunnel-soil interface. Soil behavior is modeled thorough an elastoplastic constitutive model with isotropic strain softening, which has been extensively validated through successful predictions of centrifuge model tests. A primary conclusion emerging from the paper is that the design of cut-and-cover structures against large tectonic deformation is quite feasible. It is shown that the rupture path is strongly affected by the presence of the tunnel, leading to development of beneficial stress-relieving phenomena such as diversion, bifurcation, and diffusion. The tunnel may be subjected either to hogging deformation when the rupture emerges close to its hanging-wall edge, or to sagging deformation when the rupture is near its footwall edge. Paradoxically, the maximum stressing is not always attained with the maximum imposed dislocation. Therefore, the design should be performed on the basis of design envelopes of the internal forces, with respect to the location of the fault rupture and the magnitude of dislocation. Although this study was prompted by the needs of a specific project, the method of analysis, the design concepts, and many of the conclusions are sufficiently general to merit wider application. © 2009 Springer Science+Business Media B.

40|$|The {{geochemistry}} of late Caledonian minettes {{from across}} the orogenic belt is compared in order to constrain {{the composition of the}} Caledonian sub-continental lithospheric mantle (SCLM). All the minettes are similar petrographically and chemically and several samples have characteristics typical of near primary mantle melts. Samples from the Northern Highlands and the Caledonian foreland show enrichment in many trace elements (notably LILE and LREE) relative to those from the Grampians, the Southern Uplands and northern England, coupled with distinct Nd and Sr isotope characteristics. Processes uch as fractional crystallization, crustal assimilation, and partial melting played a negligible role in creating {{the differences between the two}} groups which reflect long-term, time-integrated differences in the compositions of their SCLM sources. The Great Glen Fault appears to represent the boundary between these two lithospheric mantle domains. Other currently exposed Caledonian <b>tectonic</b> <b>dislocations</b> cannot be correlated irectly with compositional changes within the SCLM. The chemical provinciality displayed by the minettes hows some resemblance to that within other late Caledonian igneous suites, including the newer granites, suggesting that the minettes may represent the lithospheric mantle contributions to these rocks.

Carbon isotopic composition of the carbon dioxide (δ 13 C-CO 2 - 2. 0 ‰ to - 3. 8 ‰) and He isotope ratios (R/RA 0. 12 to 0. 27) are used to calculate the fraction of CO 2 originating from mantle degassing versus sedimentary sources. Results show that CO 2 predominantly (average of 80 %) derives from thermo-metamorphic reaction of limestone. The remaining 20 % are attributed to a mantle source. The presence of <b>tectonic</b> <b>dislocations</b> allows upward gas migration from a deep source to the Earth’s surface, not only in the peri-Tyrrhenian sector, but also in the more eastern part of central Italy. Isotope ratios of methane ( 13 C-CH 4 - 6. 1 ‰ to - 22. 7 ‰; D-CH 4 - 9 ‰ to - 129 ‰) shows that the gas vent releases gas of thermogenic origin, involving CO 2 and/or organic matter.

The complex morpho-structural setting of the area has been influenced by Pleistocene extensional tectonics, probably still active. <b>Tectonic</b> <b>dislocations,</b> characterized by a strike-slip component on a regional scale, have caused the superimposition of the Bulgheria-Verbicaro unit on the Crete Nere Formation and the tectonic contact of the last formation on the Alburno-Cervati unit, cropping out on the right flank of the valley. This paper reports on evidence of the seaward prolongation of the Maratea Valley, based on the geological interpretation of high resolution seismic reflection profiles, recently acquired in the surrounding offshore area. The morpho-bathymetry of the area shows steep and articulated sea bottoms, resulting from the seaward prolongation of the rocky coastal cliff, up to a water depth of - 30 m, where the continental shelf starts. The sea bottom then becomes more regular, up to the shelf break, located at about 2 km of distance from the shoreline, at water depths ranging from - 100 m and - 120 m. The shelf break is articulated and incised by deep channels linked {{to the head of}} a submarine canyon (the Maratea canyon).

Methane is not related to mantle or magma degassing. The abiogenic fraction accounts for about half of the total gas released, which is estimated to be well beyond 50 ton year to the power of - 1.

40|$|The {{application}} of geological and geophysical methods on the Ionian Island of Kefalonia {{has provided a}} new-found basis by which {{to test the hypothesis}} that Ancient Ithaca, the home of Odysseus as described in Homer’s epic the Odyssey, a subject which has perplexed academics for centuries. Although popular belief places Odysseus’ homeland on Ithaki, a small mountainous island lying to the east of Kefalonia, its location does not fit Homer’s descriptions of Ancient Ithaca since it is described as a “low-lying” island lying “furthest to the west” (facing dusk not dawn). Being land-locked and connected to the rest of Kefalonia by a narrow (6 km x 2 km) isthmus called the Thinia valley, the Paliki Peninsula of Western Kefalonia provides a better geographical fit. However, it has generally been dismissed as a candidate for Ancient Ithaca since it is not an island today and the topography of the connecting isthmus rises to a height of c. 200 m along the centre of the Thinia valley. Despite these obstacles and based on a quote by the ancient geographer Strabo made around 1 BC, Bittlestone et al. (2005) proposed that during the Mycenaean Era an ancient seaway (“Strabo’s Channel”) could have existed where Thinia stands today and the valley’s present topography is due to landslide deposition which eventually closed the seaway. This thesis presents the results of a 3 -year geological, geomorphological and geophysical investigation of “Strabo’s Channel”. The investigation was carried out using a survey programme of complimentary non-invasive geophysical techniques calibrated by 17 shallow sedimentary cores and combined with surface geological mapping and geomorphological observations. In addition to a helicopter-mounted electromagnetic (HEM) survey acquired for Northern Paliki, gravity measurements were taken across the Thinia isthmus, and resistivity and seismic refraction surveys were carried out at strategic sites. Marine shallow seismic reflection surveys were also undertaken in the coastal areas adjacent to the isthmus to chart postglacial transgression into these shallow coastal areas and to reconstruct the paleo-geography of Northern Paliki since the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) (c. 21 500 BP). The survey area is sited in the Pre-Apulian isopic zone of the Hellenide thrust belt which represents a structurally-inverted passive continental margin subsequently affected by foreland contraction and overprinted by neotectonic (outer-arc) deformation resulting from African-Eurasian plate collision. The results showed that the geology and geomorphology of Thinia was far more complicated than originally believed. The bedrock geology records the Cretaceous-Quaternary evolution of an extensional-compressional regime brought about through the foreland-migration of the Hellenide fold-and-thrust deformation in the Early Miocene which reactivated earlier south-easterly-dipping extensional faults. The peninsula was affected by further Late Quaternary, Holocene and recent neotectonic deformation caused by the formation of the dextral Kefalonia Transform Fault (KTF) and slope failure resulting from the generation of steep slopes. The shallow marine seismic reflection survey showed clear differentiation between the tectonised “pre-Holocene” and onlapping postglacial sediments separated by a prominent erosional surface associated with the LGM sea level lowstand of - 120 m. The survey detected a buried drainage valley deeply-incised into the pre-Holocene of the Gulf of Argostoli indicating that a major glacial river drained from Thinia during this lowstand. During postglacial sea level rise this valley was infiltrated by marine waters to form a ria, flooding two large glacial lakes which acted as depocentres for postglacial sediments. While the prevalence of slope collapse of the steep valley sides in Thinia favoured the idea that “Strabo’s Channel” was infilled through repeated deposition of landslide debris, the presence of bedrock at the surface of Thinia ruled out the possibility that the present valley topography was built-up through Late Holocene deposition of landslide material between Kefalonia and Paliki. The onshore tests confirmed the presence of a thick deposit of steeply-dipping and tectonised marine sediments within the valley. Biostratigraphic analysis of core samples dated these as Early Miocene to Early Pleistocene (Gelasian) indicating marine waters existed along the valley until at least 1. 80 million years ago, an order of magnitude younger than previously reported in the area. However, no new independent sediment younger than Early Pleistocene was retrieved in the cores obtained for this study despite the findings of an earlier borehole which appeared to contain Late Quaternary and Holocene marine fauna (Ehux). The geophysical surveys and cores failed to detect the sides or bottom of a channel or evidence of substantial clastic debris within the proposed channel route thus ruling out the possibility that a buried marine-level channel which extended from “sea-to-sea” had existed during the Late Bronze Age. One strategic area of investigation was the upland site of a suspected paleo-lake (Lake Katachori) which overlapped the proposed route of Strabo’s Channel at 170 m elevation. Although the presence of freshwater algae within the upper few metres confirmed a lacustrine environment, the geophysical and core evidence showed it was shallow (6 m thick) and was sited on steeply easterly-dipping Plio-Pleistocene sediments uplifted to 170 m above sea level. The occurrence of freshwater algae admixed with uppermost Plio-Pleistocene sediments probably represents a basal reworked basal lag deposit thus, implying departure from marine depositional setting occurred in Thinia sometime after the Gelasian (1. 80 Ma). Coring at Livadi Marsh suggested that while the marsh was flooded during the Bronze Age to a depth of c. 1. 2 m, making it a candidate for Ancient Ithaca’s harbour, no significant coseismic uplift appears to have occurred since the Late Bronze Age. Current coastal position was due to progradation and aggradation of marsh sediments with no more than 1. 2 m of coseismic uplift. The lack of Holocene-Late Quaternary sediment relating to an uplifted marine channel and the presence of Lake Katachori may tentatively be explained through the uplift and westwards translation of the sediments of central Thinia through establishment of a contractional-extensional linked gravity driven rotational slip linking the listric “Agia Ioanni Fault” with the Atheras Thrust. The boreholes detected shear-thrusting and steep dips within the Miocene and Plio-Pleistocene marl sediments demonstrating that the area experienced strong <b>tectonic</b> <b>dislocation</b> which is in favour of this model however further tests are required to investigate this and whether it could feasibly have occured in the required timescale...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT. — The Anatolian ophiolitic series consist {{mainly of}} harzburgites, dunites, diabases and gabbros being {{frequently}} serpentinized, sericitized or chloritized. They {{are associated with}} radiolarites, slates, dark flysh-like deposits and various limestone types. The whole generally form intensively disturbed masses including «exotic » carbonate blocks of various age and size. Limited occurrences of Paleozoic rocks excepted, the Anatolian green rocks are of Lower Mesozoic age, {{as it is shown}} by their stratigraphic position. But the textural unstable ophiolites were disrupted during the Middle-Upper Cretaceous paroxysm, by both thrusts and submarine slides, which explains why they were frequently unconformly overlain by or intercalated with Upper Cretaceous sedi-ments. The main green rock zones of N and S Anatolia show a striking parallelism to the major earthquake zones of the country. Both phenomena must be related evidently to important, deep-seated longitudinal <b>tectonic</b> <b>dislocations</b> (like boundaries between deep-seated tectonic units — f. ex. between foreland and orogenic zone — or deep root zones of nappes). The ophiolitic series of Turkey (Serpentine Series, Green Rock Series) consisting of ul-trabasic extrusive rocks and associated sediments are a characteristic element of the Alpine folds of the country. Representing a typical geosynclinal formation, these rock successions are strongly related {{to the development of the}} Alpine orogenic belt; their particularities furnish information on the deep mechanics of the Alpine orogeny. The chromite and magnesite ore deposits of Turkey are related to the ultrabasic «green rocks»; the famous sepiolite («meerschauni») found in old alluvial deposits on the N border of the Eskişehir basin is evidently a special decomposition product of these rocks (hydrothermal effects originating in the fault zone along which these deposits are developed). Following some authors (f. ex. Ami, 1941), the bauxite layers interstratified in Upper Cretaceous carbonates in the Central Toros Mountains (S Anatolian Folds) could be resedimented decomposition mate-rial derived from weathered green rocks. Iron ore deposits developed in the ophiolite areas in SE Anatolia and the Aegean region seem to be of a similar origin (İlhan, verbal information) ...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} the main morphological {{features of the}} region surrounding Rome, which extends {{as far as the}} foot of the Latian Subapennines. This region includes {{a good part of the}} Campagna Romana (or Agro Romano), a term traditionally used to indicate the area, hav-ing no well-defined boundaries, which sur-rounds the Eternal City (Almagià 1976). It is a generally hilly region with altitudes gradually decreasing from a top level of about 1000 m toward the sea and also characterized by more or less wide coastal plains among which the deltaic plain of the Tiber river stands out. The present morphological aspect of this region is the result of the combined action of the Middle and Late Quaternary volcanism and of the exogenous agents. The most important landforms encountered are volcanic, due to the activity of the Monti Sabatini and Alban Hills complexes. The volcanic activity of the Monti Sabatini complex was mainly of areal kind. The vol-canic products were ejected from numerous centres widespread over an area of about 1500 km 2; a main central edifice originated only in the eastern sector, where the Sacrofano Volcano developed. The volcanic activity started at the margins of the main graben and then migrated to its centre, following <b>tectonic</b> <b>dislocations</b> of regional importance. It caused the emplace-ment of a large amount of products (about 180 km 3) prevailingly made up of pyroclastic flows, hydromagmatic products, lava sheets and pyro-clastic fall products. As a consequence of its mainly areal activity, the Monti Sabatini com-plex generally shows a very smooth morpholo-gy characterized by low relief and structural surfaces originated by the emplacement of vol-canites (Biasini et al. 1993). The Alban Hills volcanic complex is charac-terized by an important central edifice, which erupted most of the volcanic products. The activity of this volcano had three main phases.

40|$|The authors {{argue that}} {{optimization}} of monitoring systems {{is a complicated}} task, as multiple factors {{need to be taken}} account of at one and the same time. The authors consider a monitoring system as a system of "supervision" that incorporates a set of tools, as well as registration, archiving, classification, and analysis of inspection results, inclusive of their comparison with the projected data, development and implementation of engineering solutions. The basic goal of any geomechanical monitoring project consists in development of a methodology of rational arrangement of items of monitoring equipment that employ GIS technologies. The objective of this research is to apply advanced numerical methods in combination with geographic information systems with a view to the optimization of a system of monitoring applicable to subterranean structures. Should the proven methodological and scientific validity of the research findings be in place, long-term geomechanical projections of the structural behaviour will be feasible. The proposed methodology may be introduced as a standard method of structural behaviour monitoring in the course of construction and operation of structures for engineering solutions {{to be made in the}} real-time mode. The principal goal of a monitoring system is the identification of the rock nature, processes initiated in the medium, their development pattern, and the identification of technical and economic factors of impact onto the engineering solutions to be made at each stage of engineering surveys, design, construction and operation of major subterranean structures. The analysis of calculations made for various loading scenarios have proven that any further research should take account of a lateral load that is equal to doubled vertical loads. The research was performed at a subterranean structure composed of two parallel chamber pits. The analysis of GIS modeling methods has proven that development of GIS projects requires the employment of statistical methods of the multidimensional analysis. Employment of multidimensional analysis methods makes it possible to examine the geological features that demonstrate a high degree of complexity. Terrain modeling requires the employment of models of formal characterization and differentiation. Identification of positions of geological strata and <b>tectonic</b> <b>dislocations</b> may be reduced to interpolation and extrapolation.

40|$|This article {{describes}} the petroleum potential of the Mesozoic deposits in the western segment of the Yenisei-Khatanga regional trough, as assessed from the hydrogeological data. The study area includes the Krasnoyarskregion and neighbouring zones of the Yamal-Nenets Autonomous District (Fig. 1). In tectonic terms, it is confined to the Yenisei-Khatanga regional trough and separates the Taimyr system of <b>tectonic</b> <b>dislocations</b> from the Siberian Platform [Kontorovich, 2011; Pronkin et al., 2012]. The Meso-Cenozoic section (up to 6 – 12 km) [Dolmatova, Peshkova, 2001] {{is limited by the}} Malokhet-Rassokhin-Balakhnin deep fault and the same name system of mega-ramparts in the east. In the west, it opens up and merges with the structures of the West Siberian megabasin. The hydrogeological materials collected in the study area for almost 40 years, since 1977, remained unconsolidated, and our study did so for the first time. To date, more than 200 deep wells have been drilled in this area, and more than 25 hydrocarbon fields have been discovered. Most geologists acknowledge the leading role of water in the processes of formation, migration, accumulation and degradation of hydrocarbons: water is a medium and an active participant in mass transfer. In this regard, the compositions of groundwater, water-soluble gas and organic matter are widely discussed as hydrogeological criteria that may suggest the presence of oil and gas. The hydrogeological criteria for petroleum prospecting have been classified, and it is now possible {{to take into account the}} origin and significance of each indicator, integrate their impacts and attempt at forecasting the regional, zonal and local oil and gas fields. In the Mesozoic section, sodium chloride ground waters predominate. The inversion type of vertical hydrogeochemical zoning is dominant in the study area, and involves the entire complex of deposits: the mineralization decreases from 16 – 20 g/dm 3 in the Apt-Alb-Senoman complex to 5 – 10 g/dm 3 or less in the Jurassic aquifers (Fig. 4). The inversion is accompanied by a change in the ion-salt composition of groundwater. The concentration of HCO 3 ion increases with depth; the type of groundwater changes from predominantly sodium chloride (at a depth of ~ 2300 m) to chloride-hydrocarbonate sodium and hydrocarbonate-chloride sodium. Using the hydrogeological data, we assessed the petroleum potential of the sedimentary cover in the western segment of the Yenisei-Khatanga regional trough. Based on the analysis of the set of criteria and their individual contributions to the overall assessment of the prospects, we have identified 16 highly promising and 20 medium-potential structures that can substantiate further oil-and-gas prospecting, which may discover skipped and new fields. Prospecting can prove highly effective in the Cretaceous reservoirs (Upper Sukhodudinka and Lower Kheta) located in the Nadadyan, Middle Yarov, Tokachin, Turkov, Yarov and other areas (Fig. 6). The Jurassic deposits are promising for small- and medium-sized oil-and-gas reservoirs, as suggested by the geological exploration of previous years, which discovered the Zima (1966) and Khabei (1982) fields. According to the proposed set of the hydrogeological criteria, the most promising among the Jurassic reservoirs is the Malyshev reservoir in the Deryabin, Pelyatkin, Middle Yarov, Tampei and Turkov areas. Promising to a lesser extent are the Sigov (Rassokhin and Sukhodudinka areas) and Nadoyakh (Sukhodudinka area) reservoirs. </p...|$|R
40|$|The {{subject of}} {{comprehensive}} studies is the underground hydrosphere {{of the upper}} crust of the western shoulder of the Baikal rift, being characterized by high tectonic activity in the recent stage of tectogenesis. The studies were focused on the Bayandai – Krestovsky Cape site, considering it as a benchmark for {{the territory of the}} Western Pribiakalie (Fig. 1). The available hydrogeological survey database is used to study underground waters circulating at depth of several kilometers. Analyses of deeper waters are conducted on the basis of geophysical data. According to results of initial geological and geophysical studies [Семинский и др., 2010], the crust at the junction of the Siberian crater and the SayanBaikal folded belt is characterized by a hierarchic zoneblock structure (Fig. 2). Regardless of the scale of studies, the territory under study can be divided into sections of two types, that alternate from NW to SE and represent wide highly destructed zones and relatively monolithic blocks of the crust. The Obruchev fault system is distinguished as the main interblock zone (the 2 nd hierarchic level in the study area). It represents the 50 km long NW shoulder of the Baikal rift (the 1 st  hierarchic level) and includes the Morskaya, Primorskaya and Prikhrebtovaya interplate zones (the  3 rd  hierarchic level).   These zones are traced from depth of dozens of kilometers ; at the surface, they are represented by fault structures of the highest hierarchic levels. Specific features of the current zoneblock divisibility of the crust serve as the structural basis for interpreting the materials obtained by hydrogeological studies conducted on the Bayandai – Krestovsky Cape site to research the distribution, mineralization and macrocomponent compositions of waters which represent the subsurface part of the underground lithosphere in the study area. The research is based on analyses of the underground water samples from 46 observation points scattered within the study area. The available amount of sample data can actually be considered as a complete base of standard hydrogeological data for the study area. The known specific features of hydrogeology of the Western Pribaikalie are confirmed by the general analysis of the available data. In general, fresh waters of subsurface origin of the midand submontane regions are dominant. In the anionic composition of the waters, hydrocarbon ion is predominant. Calcium and magnesium are abundant among basis ions, while potassium and sodium are rare. With the detail data on the Bayandai – Krestovsky Cape site, the above conclusions are more precisely determined, and it is generally concluded that the structural tectonic factor controls the hydrogeology of the region. The analysis of mineralization, composition, temperature and other characteristics of the underground waters (Fig. 3 – 6) show that at the low hierarchic level the NW boundary of the Obruchev interblock zone performs a function of a distinct hydrogeological barrier which represents the marginal suture of the Siberian platform. The marginal suture is active at the currently stage of tectogenesis. It separates lowmineralized and fresh waters of the platform block from fresh and ultrafresh waters of the mountainous area. The Predbaikalskaya, Prikhrebtovaya, Primorskaya and Morskaya interplate zones are distinguished within the limits of these structures. At the given hierarchic level, they control the positions of the corresponding anomalies in terms of water exchange modes, general mineralization and water cut ratios. The magnetotelluric sounding data (Fig. 2 and 7) suggest that the anomalies are subsurface manifestations of deep sections of conductivity ; such sections have fluid origin in the region under study. Specific features of the structure of such anomalies are controlled by the presence of interblock zones of the fault level of the hierarchy. The interblock zones are composed of <b>tectonic</b> <b>dislocations</b> of various ranks. Depending on their specific internal structures, such dislocations can act as impermeable screens or channels for migration of fluids. Based on the joint interpretation {{of the results of the}} hydrogeological studies and the earlier geological and geophysical studies on the Bayandai – Krestovsky Cape site, a conceptual model showing specific features of fluid saturation of the upper crust of the western shoulder of the Baikal rift is developed (Fig. 8). Generally speaking, the underground hydrosphere of the Western Pribaikalie is a uniform system at the subsurface and deeper levels, and its structure and content are mainly determined by the active zoneblock structure of the crust in the region under study. Its nature is controlled by the development of the Baikal rift, which western shoulder (and also the adjacent platform region) is occupied by a hierarchy of subvertical zones in the upper crust that are anomalous in terms of permeability concerning underground waters. In the tectonically active segment of the region, these zones are larger than the blocks and thus cause more significant dislocations and higher watercut of the crust. The relationship between dislocations and watercut allows determining specific features of the zoneblock structure by regions by applying methods of hydrogeological surveys for studies of shallow horizons and geophysical methods, which are more sensitive to fluid contents, for studies of deeper layers. On the other side, geophysical and hydrogeological data (at least on tectonically active regions) should be interpreted with account to the concept that the fields under study depend on the structural status of the rock massif, rather than on the lithology. </p...|$|R
