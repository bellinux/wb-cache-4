50|$|In England and Wales, {{charitable}} trusts are {{a form of}} {{express trust}} dedicated to charitable goals. There {{are a variety of}} advantages to charitable trust status, including exemption from most forms of tax and freedom for the trustees not found in other types of English trust. To be a valid charitable trust, the organisation must demonstrate both a charitable purpose and a public benefit. Applicable charitable purposes are normally divided into four categories; <b>trusts</b> <b>for</b> the relief of poverty, <b>trusts</b> <b>for</b> the promotion of education, <b>trusts</b> <b>for</b> the promotion of religion and all other types of trust recognised by the law, which includes <b>trusts</b> <b>for</b> the benefit of animals and <b>trusts</b> <b>for</b> the benefit of a locality. There is also a requirement that the trust's purposes benefit the public (or some section of the public), and not simply a group of private individuals.|$|R
500|$|The first {{definition}} of a [...] "charitable purpose" [...] {{was found in the}} preamble to the Charitable Uses Act 1601.

This [...] "charitable purpose" [...] was expanded on in Section 2(2) of the Charities Act 2006, but the Macnaghten categories are still widely used.|$|R
