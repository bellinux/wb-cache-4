5|$|In {{response}} to the Apollo 1 accident which killed three astronauts in 1967, Congress directed NASA to form an Aerospace Safety Advisory Panel (ASAP) to advise <b>the</b> <b>NASA</b> Administrator on safety issues and hazards in NASA's aerospace programs. In {{the aftermath of the}} Shuttle Columbia accident, Congress required that the ASAP submit an annual report to <b>the</b> <b>NASA</b> Administrator and to Congress. By 1971, NASA had also established the Space Program Advisory Council and the Research and Technology Advisory Council to provide the administrator with advisory committee support. In 1977, the latter two were combined to form <b>the</b> <b>NASA</b> Advisory Council (NAC).|$|E

5|$|Glenn {{remained}} {{an officer in}} the Marine Corps after his selection, but was assigned to <b>the</b> <b>NASA</b> Space Task Group at Langley Research Center in Hampton, Virginia. The task force moved to Houston, Texas, in 1962, and became part of <b>the</b> <b>NASA</b> Manned Spacecraft Center. A portion of the astronauts' training was in space science, but it had a practical aspect, which included scuba diving and work in simulators. Astronauts secured an additional role in the spaceflight program: to provide pilot input in design. The astronauts divided the various tasks between them. Glenn's specialisation was cockpit layout design and control functioning for the Mercury and early Apollo programs. He pressed the other astronauts to set a moral example, living up to the squeaky-clean image of them that had been portrayed by Life magazine, a position that was not popular with the other astronauts.|$|E
