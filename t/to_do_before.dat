He {{refused to take}} his anti-retroviral {{medication}} unless it was made affordable and available to everyone—a hugely courageous thing <b>to</b> <b>do.</b> <b>Before</b> then, I'd been frustrated because I wanted to be more hands-on. I just feel that TAC are doing it where it needs to happen. It really needed to be given support, and I thought that perhaps I might be well-placed to do it.|$|E
5|$|Homer {{decides to}} take his family to the new sushi bar, The Happy Sumo. After {{sampling}} most of {{the items on the}} menu, he tries sushi made from fugu. The chef in charge is busy making love with Edna, so his apprentice has to slice the fish, of which certain parts are toxic. He tries to do it carefully, but Homer becomes impatient, only to have it served and become unsure if the poisonous portions have been removed. Homer considers it a treat, but the chef soon returns and believes that the fish has not been prepared correctly and tells Homer that he may have been poisoned. Homer and Marge go to the hospital, where Dr. Hibbert informs Homer that based on a chat he had with the sushi chef, Homer is found out that he has increased likeliness of death and has 22 hours left to live. At night with Marge by his side, he decides not to tell his children about the bad news and makes {{a list of all the}} things he wants <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>before</b> death.|$|E
25|$|Because {{of these}} factors and more, fMRI {{evidence}} has been excluded from any form of legal system. The testing is too uncontrolled and unpredictable. Therefore, it has been stated that fMRI has much more testing <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>before</b> it can be considered viable in the eyes the legal system.|$|E

25|$|The version {{shown at}} the 2000 Cannes Film Festival was three hours long. This was a working version that was later cut to 139 minutes with {{director}} Jiang Wen's full participation {{in order to enhance}} the film's commercial prospects and to tighten the storyline, which he did not have time <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>before</b> the Cannes premier.|$|E
25|$|The kick {{sailed through}} the {{uprights}} and the Oklahoma sideline {{thought it was}} good; the kickoff unit trotted out and the Schooner, as was traditional, also trotted slowly onto the Orange Bowl's wet, mushy field. However, the field goal kick was nullified due to an illegal procedure penalty on Oklahoma. A Sooner player did not report his temporary jersey number to the officials, which he was required <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>before</b> the ball was snapped.|$|E

Or, in the last episode of the series illustrating the marriage of Donna and David, it is alluded to a party that Brenda had organized when {{they were still in}} high school.|$|E
25|$|Not all ceramic {{pieces are}} dry {{when they need}} cleaning. Some ceramics, {{such as those that}} are {{excavated}} archaeologically, will be damp or wet in nature. Conservators tend to remove the surface dirt before the object is completely dry. This is done because it is easier <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>before</b> the dirt hardens and because as it dried the dirt may shrink and cause physical damage to the ceramic surface. Some ceramics are kept damp until treatment can be completed.|$|E

Shortly before starting work on Doctor Who, she had a starring role in the horror film Spirit Trap, released in August 2005 to poor reviews. In November 2005, she starred as Hero in a BBC adaptation of Much Ado About Nothing, updated for the modern day {{in a similar manner}} to the Canterbury Tales series in which she featured, with Hero now being a weather presenter in a television station.|$|E

25|$|Simeon I {{was content}} with results and {{considered}} {{that he had}} superiority over the Byzantine Empire. Despite the success, he {{realized that there was}} still a lot <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>before</b> prevailing over the Empire for good. He needed his own political and ideological base, and he consequently launched an ambitious construction program in Preslav so that it could rival Constantinople. In the meanwhile, Simeon I had also imposed his authority over Serbia in return for recognizing Petar Gojniković as its ruler. That was an important move towards reducing Byzantine influence over the Western Balkans.|$|E
25|$|Figo left Real Madrid to join Italian club Internazionale in {{the middle}} of 2005 on a free {{transfer}} after his contract with Madrid had expired. This meant that Figo would finally be able to play for a club in Italy, something he had the chance <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>before</b> his move to Barcelona, but was scuppered due to a dispute between the two clubs interested, Juventus and Parma. During the middle of 2008, Figo's compatriot José Mourinho joined Inter on a managerial level. This has been said to please Figo, as he would have several Portuguese teammates during the remainder of his stay at Inter.|$|E
25|$|Among {{the plot}} twists are {{the death of}} {{apparently}} crucial characters and the reappearances of believed-to-be dead characters. However, Rachael Brown of The Atlantic said that Martin's penchant for unpredictability may make the reader grow increasingly skeptical of apparent deaths, alluding to Jon Snow's fate in A Dance with Dragons. Martin believes that bringing back a dead character necessitates a transformative experience of the character. The body may be moving, but {{some aspect of the}} spirit is changed or lost. One of the characters who has come back repeatedly from death is Beric Dondarrion, The Lightning Lord, and what has happened with him echoes with some of the other revived characters; bits of his humanity and his past lives are lost every time he comes back from death, his flesh is falling away from him, but he remembers the mission he was sent <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>before</b> death.|$|E

In the episode, Homer consumes a poisonous fugu fish at a sushi restaurant, and is told that he has only 22hours left to live. He accepts his fate and makes {{a list of all}} the things he wants <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>before</b> he dies.|$|E

[...] She begged Malibu neighbour Larry Hagman to check Moon into a clinic to dry out (as he had attempted <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>before),</b> but when doctors recorded Moon's chemical intake at breakfast – a bottle of champagne, Courvoisier and amphetamines – they concluded that there was no hope for his rehabilitation.|$|E

Cash is subsequently taken to various locations around the city and forced to face off against a series of increasingly dangerous gangs. First, he is pitted against a group of white nationalists and Neo-Nazis in a scrap yard. Then, he faces a gang of a former military turned mercenaries called [...] "The Wardogs" [...] in an abandoned zoo. Here Cash has to save members of his own family who have been kidnapped by the Wardogs and are being used as bait to lure him out. Following this, he fights a gang of Satanic Latino occultists and perverted pedophiles called [...] "The Innocentz" [...] in a derelict shopping center.|$|E

500|$|In 11 days {{of action}} in the Sangju area the 24th Regiment had {{suffered}} 323 battle casualties, 27 killed, 293 wounded, and 3 missing. The light casualty count was partially credited to effective use of fortifications and North Korean caution in advancing during the fight, {{but the fact that}} 24th Infantry troops were quick to withdraw was also blamed. The regiment, a mostly black unit left over from the US military's recently abolished segregated system, was blasted for its poor performance during the fight. Walker, seeing the 24th Infantry as an ineffective unit, resolved to use it only as a [...] "trip wire force" [...] on the front lines, requiring it to be reinforced by another regiment in reserve to conduct serious resistance when the 24th broke. Other leaders saw the poor performance as a reason to demand further integration of the armed forces, which had not been easy <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>before</b> the war. The 24th Infantry was fully desegregated on October 1, 1951.|$|E
500|$|The {{town was}} {{previously}} {{served by a}} station on the Somerset and Dorset Railway (S) but this closed in 1966, and by a second station on the Bristol and North Somerset Railway at Welton in the valley. The railways were separate, the S being administered by the Midland Railway and the London and South Western Railway companies (later the London Midland and Scottish Railway and the Southern Railway) and the North Somerset being run by and then owned by the Great Western Railway. The stations were both called [...] "Midsomer Norton and Welton" [...] (the B station was originally called just [...] "Welton"); under British Railways, the S station was renamed as Midsomer Norton South after a short period as Midsomer Norton Upper; and is currently being restored with occasional open weekends with engines in steam. The Somerset & Dorset Railway Heritage Trust one day hopes to operate steam trains for a mile up to Chilcompton Tunnel but there remains much <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>before</b> this can happen.|$|E
500|$|There was broad {{agreement}} {{regarding the}} scene where Will asks Finn to be his best man: not one reviewer approved. Lynch called it [...] "questionable" [...] and said it crossed a [...] "line of weirdness", Slezak and TV Guide Kate Stanhope felt it was inappropriate, if not unethical, and Bell said the actual request was the episode's [...] "biggest WTF?! moment". Will's statement that Finn had taught him [...] "more about being a man" [...] was met with incredulity. Slezak declared [...] "Finn {{has a lot of}} growing up <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>before</b> he's really a man", and Sullivan wrote that since Finn acted [...] "like a petulant man-boy" [...] on the show, Will must have been referring to events in [...] "a season of Glee that didn't air". Finn did receive some praise from Lesley Goldberg of The Hollywood Reporter, however; she called the sequence where he discovers the truth about his father [...] "one of Cory Monteith's best scenes yet", and Slezak described it as [...] "beautifully handled" [...] by Monteith. Finn's marriage proposal to Rachel {{at the end of the}} episode was controversial. Reviewers thought it was a bad idea—Kubicek declared, [...] "No one in high school should get engaged"—but Poniewozik wrote that it [...] "made a lot of sense for Finn" [...] as a character, and VanDerWerff said the scene [...] "worked" [...] for him.|$|E
