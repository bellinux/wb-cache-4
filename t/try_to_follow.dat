5|$|Set in 2090, {{the game}} is centred on a fictional extreme racing sport known as Ballistics, a {{descendant}} of Formula One. The player takes {{the role of a}} Ballistic's pilot, racing hoverbikes called speeders through the inside of tubes which form the courses. The speeders are magnetically attached to the race surface, allowing the player 360 degrees of movement along the left/right axis. The player can detach the speeder from the track and navigate down the center in order to avoid track obstacles and to acquire the power-ups exclusively located there. Players must <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>follow</b> the outside of each curve, as hitting the inside of a curve at speed could lead to an involuntary detachment, leading to a loss of control and seconds dropped in securing reattachment.|$|E
5|$|The next morning, Tintin finds {{electric}} cables and red beacons in the garden, surmising {{that they are}} there designed to attract a plane drop. At night, he lights the flares, and finds that planes drops sacks of counterfeit money, revealing that Müller {{is part of a}} gang of forgers. He pursues Müller and his accomplice Ivan and along the way, Thompson and Thomson try to arrest him again, but he convinces them to follow him. When Müller takes a plane north, Tintin and Snowy <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>follow,</b> but hit a storm and crash land in rural Scotland. The detectives commandeer another plane, but discover too late that the man they told to fly it is actually a mechanic who has never flown before, and after a harrowing air-bound odyssey they end up crash-landing into (and winning) an aerobatics competition.|$|E
25|$|In the 17th century, the Empire {{had set up}} Orthoepy Academies (正音书院/正音書院 Zhèngyīn Shūyuàn) in {{an attempt}} to make {{pronunciation}} conform to the standard. But these attempts had little success, since as late as the 19th century the emperor had difficulty understanding some of his own ministers in court, who did not always <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>follow</b> any standard pronunciation.|$|E

The team sends a report back to the orbital base. They receive a reply from Leonid Gorbovsky. The mission of ER-2 is changed to establish contact with a possible alien race.|$|E
25|$|During the 2014 Winter Olympics, Byline host Brian Lilley aired {{a segment}} which criticized CBC personalities for pronouncing {{the names of}} Olympic {{competitors}} from Quebec in the French manner rather than anglicizing them. Canadian English {{does not have a}} single standard for handling non-English names; some speakers anglicize them while others <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>follow</b> the native pronunciation as closely as possible, but neither practice is considered to be objectively incorrect, and many international news organizations throughout the world follow the latter practice as a matter of respect to the personalities they cover. Lilley apologized for the segment the following day.|$|E

25|$|Copenhagen's {{relatively}} well-developed bicycle {{culture has}} given rise to the term copenhagenization. This is the practice where other cities <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>follow</b> the example Copenhagen has set in recent decades, by moving from their own (often long-held) car-centric transport policies to those that attempt to greatly increase the number of journeys by bicycle; they do this by developing bicycle infrastructure and/or improving their current bicycle infrastructure just as Copenhagen has done and continues to do. An example of a city which has introduced bike lanes acknowledging inspiration from Copenhagen is Melbourne in Australia where kerbside bike lanes separated from moving and parked cars by a low concrete kerb are referred to as 'Copenhagen lanes'. The concept of Copenhagenization has been featured by CNNs Richard Quest in the Futures Cities series and on Al Jazeera's Earthrise series.|$|E
25|$|Apotropaic marks, made to keep witches out of buildings, {{are also}} {{referred}} to as witch marks or witches' marks. Marks have been found at Knole House, at Shakespeare's Birthplace in Stratford-upon-Avon, at the Tower of London, and many churches, but little effort has been made to find them on secular buildings. The marks are most common near places where witches were thought to be able to enter, whether doors, windows or chimneys. At the Bradford-on-Avon Tithe Barn, a flower-like pattern of overlapping circles is incised into a stone in the wall. Similar circles occur on a window cill dated about 1616 at Owlpen Manor, in Gloucestershire. Other types of mark include the intertwined letters V and M (for the protector, the Virgin Mary), and crisscrossing lines to confuse any spirits that might <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>follow</b> them.|$|E
25|$|In the morning, Brigadier General Fitzhugh Lee's division, while {{proceeding}} {{across the}} road between York and Gettysburg, discovered that Major General Jubal Early had marched west towards Gettysburg. He sent a staff officer in that direction to locate Early. The officer, Major Andrew R. Venable, found General Lee and Lieutenant General Ewell near Gettysburg. Despite Lee's intelligence, Stuart did not <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>follow</b> Early's route but moved away from Gettysburg toward Carlisle, Pennsylvania {{in an effort to}} find supplies and part of the Confederate Army. Instead, he found Carlisle in possession of Union militia supported by artillery and a cavalry force. As Stuart began to attack the town, he received orders from General Lee, who learned Stuart's location through Venable, to take a position on the left flank of the Army of Northern Virginia at Gettysburg. On July 2, his force rode to Gettysburg, arriving in the afternoon.|$|E

(Coffin didn't keep records, but estimated the number to be around 3,000.) When questioned about his motives for aided fugitive slaves, Coffin once replied: [...] "The Bible, in bidding us to feed the hungry and clothe the naked, said nothing about color, and I should <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>follow</b> out the teachings of that good book." [...] He also said, [...] "I thought it was always safe to do right." ...|$|E
500|$|Pierce {{returns to}} the {{farmstead}} shortly after with six other men, including a doctor, who begin examining Nahum's remains. They discover both Merwin and Zenas' eroding skeletons {{at the bottom of}} the well, as well as remnants of several other creatures. As they reflect upon their discoveries in the house, a light begins to emit from the well that eventually transforms into the [...] "colour" [...] and begins pouring out, spreading over everything nearby. The men flee the house just as the horror blights the land and then shoots toward the sky. Pierce alone turns back after the [...] "colour" [...] has gone and witnesses a small part of it <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>follow</b> the rest, only to fail and return to the well. The knowledge that part of the alien still resides on earth is sufficient to alter his mental state.

If there's anything I can do to champion the cause and further it, I will, shy of getting arrested." [...] Swedish athletes Emma Green Tregaro and Moa Hjelmer painted her fingernails in rainbow colors as a symbolic protest. However, Tregaro was forced to re-paint them after they were deemed a political gesture that violated {{the rules of the}} IAAF. In response, she re-painted them red as a symbol of love. Russian pole vaulter Yelena Isinbaeva criticized Tregaro's gesture as being disrespectful to the host country, stating in a press conference that [...] "we have our law which everyone has to respect. When we go to different countries, we <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>follow</b> their rules. We are not trying to set our rules over there. We are just trying to be respectful." [...] After Isinbaeva's remarks were characterized as being homophobic, she argued that her choice of words had been misinterpreted by the media, and that she was against the discrimination of gays.|$|E

She believes she is being followed, and contacts Lincoln Lee (Seth Gabel) at the Fringe division, who sends over a security detail. By the time they arrive, Fauxlivia has been kidnapped; though they <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>follow</b> a secret tracker each agent carries, her abductors have extracted it to throw Fringe off their tracks. Walternate (John Noble) and Lincoln believe the abduction to be an inside job due to this. Astrid Farnsworth (Jasika Nicole) identifies a vehicle that has passed by Fauxlivia's home at a high frequency, that being the taxi that belongs to Henry (Andre Royo). Lincoln and Charlie (Kirk Acevedo) track down Henry, who explains he has been keeping an eye on Fauxlivia, surprised to have seen her return and seeming like a different person than his previous encounters with her; Henry is unaware that he had actually helped the prime universe's Olivia to escape ("Olivia" [...] and [...] "The Abducted"). Lincoln, suspicious of these events, forces Walternate to admit that Fauxlivia was switched with Olivia, and that the child Fauxlivia carries is his grandchild. Meanwhile, Marilyn learns that Fauxlivia's test for the virus is positive and warns Charlie that Fauxlivia will die if she has the child.|$|E

To compensate for this, the gradient should {{be a little less}} steep the sharper the curve is; the necessary grade reduction is assumed to be given by a simple formula such as 0.04 per cent per [...] "degree of curve", the latter being a measure of curve sharpness used in the United States. On a 10-degree curve (radius 573.7 feet) the grade would thus need to be 0.4% less than the grade on straight track.|$|E

Watterson quickly discovered that the job was full of unexpected challenges which prevented him from performing his duties to the standards set for him. [...] Not the least of these challenges was his unfamiliarity with the Cincinnati political scene, as he had never resided in or near the city, having grown up in the Cleveland area and attending college in central Ohio. The Post abruptly fired Watterson before his contract was up.|$|E
