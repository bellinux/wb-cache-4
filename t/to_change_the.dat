40|$|Kaplan and Norton (2001) {{presented}} their Balanced Scorecard (BSC) for {{the measurement of}} corporate performance and the setting of measures for employees' performance and adaptation to fit into corporate dynamism. Studies show that when a leader is unable to raise his/her followers' level of commitment <b>to</b> <b>change</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> organisational BSC approach, the corporation will have difficulty in achieving its mission. <b>The</b> commitment <b>to</b> <b>change</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> BSC approach provides for long-run growth and healthy business performance. This {{study was designed to}} empirically examine the effect of both mediated and moderated relations for the transformational leadership process on the followers' level of commitment <b>to</b> <b>change</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> organisational BSC approach. The results of the findings indicated that: there was a positive association between the transformational leader's people-oriented behaviour and the followers' level of trust, but a negative relationship between the followers' level of trust and their commitment <b>to</b> <b>change</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> BSC approach; the level of trust mediated the association between the leader's transformational task- and people-oriented behaviour and the followers' level of commitment <b>to</b> <b>change</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> organisational BSC approach. The findings suggest that the followers' attitude towards the leader, such as their level of general satisfaction, should be identified as a moderating effect/contingency approach. transformational leadership; leadership behaviour; moderated relations; mediated relations; change commitment; organisational BSC; balanced scorecard; corporate performance; performance measurement; trust; organisational change. ...|$|R
