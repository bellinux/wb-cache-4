Upon learning of this, Martin becomes emotionally frustrated. Even so, he accepts Just's offer of work and accommodation at his farm. He learns <b>that</b> <b>Just</b> <b>is</b> in conflict with his uncle Bent (Jørn Jeppesen), co-owner of the farm, who wants to sell the property before their money situation worsens.

5000|$|In 2005, Werbach {{generated}} considerable {{controversy in}} the environmental community when {{it was revealed that}} Saatchi & Saatchi was doing consulting work for Wal-Mart, creating its Personal Sustainability Project (“PSP”) to teach the company's American employees about sustainability. The move was seen as hypocritical, since Werbach had previously criticized Wal-Mart’s labor conditions, called it [...] "a new breed of toxin" [...] that [...] "could wreak havoc on a town," [...] and claimed he had set foot in a Wal-Mart store exactly once in his entire life. Werbach lost friends and clients, received death threats, and stopped speaking in public without special security. The Sierra Club (which funds the watchdog Wal-Mart Watch) begged him to reconsider, and activists John Sellers and Barbara Dudley openly accused Werbach of abandoning his principles and integrity. Wade Rathke, founder of ACORN, stated, [...] "For Werbach to believe that you and your little lonesome are changing something with a million-and-a-half employees, $350 billion of sales, well, there's a level of ego there <b>that</b> <b>just</b> <b>is</b> staggering...

40|$|Abstract. Maintaining {{compact and}} {{competent}} case bases {{has become a}} main topic of Case Based Reasoning (CBR) research. The main goal is to obtain a compact case base (with a reduced number of cases) without losing accuracy. In this work we present JUST, a technique {{to reduce the size}} of a case base while maintaining the classification accuracy of the CBR system. JUST uses justifications in order to select a subset of cases from the original case base that will form the new reduced case base. A justification is an explanation that the CBR system generates to justify the solution found for a given problem. Moreover, we present empirical evaluation in various data sets showing <b>that</b> <b>JUST</b> <b>is</b> an effective case base reduction technique that maintains the classification accuracy of the case base. Keywords: CBR, Case Base Management, Case Base Reduction. ...|$|E

Focus on borderline cases suggests that an alternative model is to be preferred, in which meaning is seen as the product of interaction between a relatively homogeneous just and features of context. These include not only other semantic entities present in the utterance but also a considerable range of pragmatic and cognitive factors involving the interpersonal dimension of the speech event and alternative cognitive models applicable to situations falling within the scope of the adverb. The discussion is relevant to issues concerning discreteness in linguistic description (Langacker 1987) and the nature of linguistic categories (Lakoff 1987) ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Indigenous {{agriculture}} is base on farmer’s cooperation with nature. Sustainable agriculture that inspired by indigenous systems would rectify most of deficiencies of modern agriculture. Indigenous agriculture systems is production of centuries {{of cultural and}} subsistence revolution. These systems are collections of farmer’s experiences that haven't enjoy sources except inputs, capital and indigenous knowledge. And consequently they accessed to such sustainable agriculture <b>that</b> <b>just</b> <b>is</b> dependent on using restricted local resources and existing humane and animal power. At indigenous agriculture, culture diversity and frequency would minimize possibility of loss crops in spite of simple technology. These systems despite of limitation of sources enjoy merits of sponsors traditions and intelligent methods of using animals, fields, and compatible crop species. Thus ecological agriculture scholars consider these systems as unique samples to determine sustainability standards in agricultures activities. This knowledge would rise at {{different fields such as}} language, botanical and zoology and also skills and manual and agriculture professions that all are product of human efforts in his environment. This information contain best, useful and consistent collocation of exploiting methods and living in special environment which be transmitted through verbal and empirical way from one generation to another.

40|$|Understanding and {{exploring}} complex and protracted social questions requires sophisticated investigative approaches. In {{this article we}} intend looking at a research approach capable of providing {{a better understanding of}} what is going on in schools, students and communities in “exceptionally challenging contexts” (Harris et al., 2006) —code for schools and communities that have as a result of wider social forces, been historically placed in situations of disadvantage. Ball (2006) summarized neatly the urgent necessity for research approaches that are theoretically tuned into being able to explore and explain what Bourdieu, Chamboredon & Passeron (1991) describe as a world that is “complicated, confused, impure [and] uncertain” (p. 259). Ball’s (2006) claim is for a research approach with the “conceptual robustness” to move us beyond the moribund situation we currently find ourselves in. As he put it: “Much of what passes for educational research is hasty, presumptive, and immodest” (p. 9). What is desperately needed are theoretically adroit research approaches capable of “challenging conservative orthodoxies and closure, parsimony, and simplicity”, that retain “some sense of the obduracy and complexity of the social”, and that don’t continually “overestimate our grasp on the social world and underestimate our role in its management” (p. 9). Our particular interest here is in research orientations that are up to the task of uncovering what we know to be something extremely complex and controversial going on in schools, namely how it is that schools work in ways in which “class is achieved and maintained and enacted rather than something <b>that</b> <b>just</b> <b>is!</b> (Ball, 2006, p. 8) ...|$|E
40|$|Everyday life is {{something}} we take for granted, something <b>that</b> <b>just</b> <b>is</b> there but we rarely notice. The study of everyday life sociology {{is the study of}} our everyday life in the micro-sociological level, things happen around us that we rarely think about because it is so integrated into our daily lives. I chose to study the phenomenon of coffee drinking, Sweden was ranked second in the list of most coffee-consuming country in the world in 2011 (Kaffeinformation. se). The purpose of this essay was to study and describe when, where, how and why people drink coffee today, and examine what experiences people have of drinking coffee at social gatherings. My research questions were: In what social contexts do people drink coffee today? What experiences do people have of coffee drinking in social settings today and how important is the coffee for our everyday life and its different contexts? The coffee was very exclusive at first, it was even a pharmacy for some time, and therefore the coffee drink belonged to the upper class in the beginning. Today everybody drinks coffee and it is not a class issue. At the time when coffee was a luxury, people drank it less often, maybe after a fancy dinner, today however we drink it several times a day and {{at any time during the}} day. I recognize coffee as one of our most common everyday beverages and it interested me to study why it is so popular. In my results I found that coffee was not just an ordinary beverage with a common taste, for coffee drinkers the coffee seems to involve a variety of experiences. The coffee is a social drink and a way for people to feel fellowship but also a reason for a pause, a commercial symbol and it has become a norm in our culture. Validerat; 20120625 (anonymous...|$|E
