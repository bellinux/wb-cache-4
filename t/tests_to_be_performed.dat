25|$|The first {{field trials}} of golden rice cultivars were {{conducted}} by Louisiana State University Agricultural Center in 2004. Additional trials have been conducted in the Philippines and Taiwan, and in Bangladesh (2015). Field testing provides an accurate measurement of nutritional value and enables feeding <b>tests</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>performed.</b> Preliminary results from field tests have shown field-grown golden rice produces 4 to 5 times more beta-carotene than golden rice grown under greenhouse conditions.|$|E
25|$|In 1982, the S.Tu.R.P. group {{published}} {{the list of}} <b>tests</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>performed</b> on the shroud; these aimed to identify how the image was impressed onto the cloth, to verify the relic's purported origin, and to identify better-suited conservation methods. However, a disagreement between the S.Tu.R.P. group and the candidate laboratories turned into a P.R. rift: the S.Tu.R.P. group expected to perform the radiometric examination under its own aegis and after the other examinations had been completed, while the laboratories considered radio-carbon dating to be the prime test, which should be completed at the detriment of other tests, if necessary.|$|E

50|$|New {{biomedical}} {{technologies like}} microarrays, next generation sequencers (for genomics) and mass spectrometry (for proteomics) generate {{enormous amounts of}} data, allowing many <b>tests</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>performed</b> simultaneously. Careful analysis with biostatistical methods is required to separate the signal from the noise. For example, a microarray {{could be used to}} measure many thousands of genes simultaneously, determining which of them have different expression in diseased cells compared to normal cells. However, only a fraction of genes will be differentially expressed.|$|E
50|$|An RF (Radio Frequency) and {{microwave}} switch is {{a device to}} route high frequency signals through transmission paths. RF {{and microwave}} switches are used extensively in microwave test systems for signal routing between instruments and devices under test (DUT). Incorporating a switch into a switch matrix system enables you to route signals from multiple instruments to single or multiple DUTs. This allows multiple <b>tests</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>performed</b> with the same setup, {{eliminating the need for}} frequent connects and disconnects. The entire testing process can be automated, increasing the throughput in high-volume production environments.|$|E

The application of this modified <b>test</b> <b>to</b> a group of asthmatic children {{with regard to the}} house-dust mite allergen (Dermatophagoides farinae) is described...|$|R
5000|$|Beginning with NUnit 2.4, a new Constraint-based {{model was}} introduced. This {{approach}} uses a single method of the [...] class for all assertions, passing a [...] object that specifies the <b>test</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>performed.</b> This constraint-based model is now used internally by NUnit for all assertions. The {{methods of the}} classic approach have been re-implemented {{on top of this}} new model.|$|R
50|$|Automatic {{test system}} {{switching}} test equipment allows for high-speed testing of a device or devices {{in a test}} situation, where strict sequences and combinations of switching must be observed. By automating the process in this way, the possibility of test errors and inaccuracies is minimized, and only systematic errors would generally be encountered due to such as an incorrect programmed test condition. This eliminates error due to human factors and allows application of a standard test sequence repetitively. The design of a test system’s switching configuration is governed by the test specification, which {{is derived from the}} functional <b>tests</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>performed.</b>|$|E

50|$|However, {{even while}} {{it is clear that}} Islamic law is used and imposed it the film also shows how the Iranian court is willing to combine secular state law as well. This is {{especially}} true in terms of the court issuing orders for medical <b>tests</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>performed</b> to determine if facts presented in a case are true before rendering a verdict. It also clear that along with the religious elements which are in place, the Iranian court has a well established state run bureaucracy within the court. There are clear procedures in place and a litany of papers which must be filed with the correct departments with the proper signatures included.|$|E

5000|$|The United States {{adopted the}} Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Act in 1996, which gave {{individual}} states {{the authority to}} drug test welfare recipients. Drug testing in order for potential recipients to receive welfare has become an increasingly controversial topic. Richard Hudson, a Republican from North Carolina claims he pushes for drug screening {{as a matter of}} [...] "moral obligation" [...] and that testing should be enforced as a way for the United States government to discourage drug usage. [...] Others claim that ordering the needy to drug test [...] "stereotypes, stigmatizes, and criminalizes" [...] them without need. States that currently require drug <b>tests</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>performed</b> in order to receive public assistance include Arizona, Florida, Georgia, Missouri, Oklahoma, Tennessee, and Utah.|$|E
5000|$|For {{reliability}} testing, data is {{gathered from}} {{various stages of}} development, such as the design and operating stages. The tests are limited due to restrictions such as cost and time restrictions. Statistical samples are obtained from the software products to test for {{the reliability of the}} software. Once sufficient data or information is gathered, statistical studies are done. Time constraints are handled by applying fixed dates or deadlines for the <b>tests</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>performed.</b> After this phase, design of the software is stopped and the actual implementation phase starts. As there are restrictions on costs and time, the data is gathered carefully so that each data has some purpose and gets its expected precision. To achieve the satisfactory results from reliability testing one must take care of some reliability characteristics.For example, Mean Time to Failure (MTTF) is measured in terms of three factors: ...|$|E
5000|$|Because many {{causes of}} {{diarrhea}} give IBS-like symptoms, the American Gastroenterological Association published {{a set of}} guidelines for <b>tests</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>performed</b> to rule out other causes of these symptoms. These include gastrointestinal infections, lactose intolerance, and coeliac disease. Research has suggested these guidelines are not always followed. Once other causes have been excluded, the diagnosis of IBS is performed using a diagnostic algorithm. Well-known algorithms include the Manning criteria, the obsolete Rome I and II criteria, and the Kruis criteria, and studies have compared their reliability. The more recent Rome III process was published in 2006, the Rome IV criteria were published in 2016. Physicians may choose {{to use one of}} these guidelines or may simply choose to rely on their own anecdotal experience with past patients. The algorithm may include additional tests to guard against misdiagnosis of other diseases as IBS. Such [...] "red flag" [...] symptoms may include weight loss, gastrointestinal bleeding, anemia, or nocturnal symptoms. However, red flag conditions may not always contribute to accuracy in diagnosis; for instance, as many as 31% of IBS patients have blood in their stool, many possibly from hemorrhoidal bleeding.|$|E

50|$|The {{audience}} is introduced to Gina (Lena Headey), a successful radiologist, who is examining x-rays {{of a patient}} with Situs Inversus, an uncommon condition {{in which a person}} is born with their heart and other organs reversed or mirrored from their normal positions. On the birthday of her father, John (Richard Jenkins), Gina, along with her boyfriend Stefan (Melvil Poupaud), her brother Daniel (Asier Newman) and his girlfriend Kate (Michelle Duncan) surprises John in his home. In the middle of the dinner party, a mirror previously knocked askew when John entered the room falls and shatters. Kate and Gina proceeded to clean the shards and discuss that mirrors breaking is a sign of bad luck. At work the next day, Gina was baffled by her assistant Anthony (Damian O'Hare) when he tells her that he saw Gina walking out of the building. Gina explains that she has been inside the whole time. On her way home however, she sees a woman who looks exactly like her driving a car identical to hers. Gina follows the woman to her flat and sees a picture of her and John inside the woman's room. A frightened Gina runs out of the building and drives her car. Seemingly disturbed at what she saw, she collides head on with another truck {{in the middle of the}} road. Gina awakens in a hospital with no memory of the accident. She is introduced to a therapist Dr. Robert Zachman (Ulrich Thomsen). Robert leaves her a calling card and Stefan fetches her out of the hospital. At Stefan's flat, Gina notices his mirror is missing and he explains he broke it by accident. A leakage bothers Gina in the bathroom and goes to check on it in the attic but is stopped by Stefan. Stefan appears to be cold and less emotional than earlier appearances in the film. Stefan's dog also whines at him, and attempts to bite his hand. Gina contacts Robert about her concerns that Stefan is not really her boyfriend. Dr. Zachman suggests this may be a form of Prosopagnosia, or face blindness, brought on by brain damage and memory loss sustained in the car crash. Dr. Zachman advises more <b>tests</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>performed,</b> and recommends that Gina visit her wrecked car in hopes that it will help her remember the events surrounding the accident.|$|E

30|$|Another {{difference}} in the guidelines was stipulated to mitigate bioavailability-related risks in patients with lower stomach acid. The ratio of achlorhydric (i.e., hypochlorhydric) patients in Japan is higher compared to that in US and EU countries, particularly among the elderly population (Morihara et al. 2001). Thus, the guidelines requires BE <b>tests</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>performed</b> on subjects with low gastric acidity, if the test formulation shows a dissolution profile different from the reference product in neutral (pH  6.8) media. For drugs used only for a specific group of patients, the guidelines recommend BE <b>tests</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>performed</b> with the specific population, if a large {{difference in}} dissolution profiles is present.|$|E
