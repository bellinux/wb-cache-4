5|$|Many of {{the sites}} {{are located in the}} Highlands and Islands. This may be because of the {{relatively}} sparse modern populations and consequent lack of disturbance. Much of the area also has a <b>thick</b> <b>covering</b> of peat that preserves stone fragments, although the associated acidic conditions tend to dissolve organic materials. There are also numerous important remains in the Orkney archipelago, where sand and arable land predominate. Local tradition hints at both a fear and veneration of these ancient structures that may have helped to preserve their integrity.|$|E

At Providence, the creek flowed directly southeast prior to the glacial period, reaching the Lackawanna River approximately [...] downstream of its current location. However, the course now flows to the east instead. The old course of the creek has been build over. There is a ledge on the north bank of Leggetts Creek in its lower reaches. The creek makes a sharp eastward bend around Providence. From this point downstream to its mouth, it flows through a rocky channel that contains a <b>thick</b> <b>covering</b> of till on its upper walls.|$|E
500|$|Crinipellis zonata, {{commonly}} known as the zoned Crinipellis or the zoned-cap Collybia, is a species of gilled mushroom in the Marasmiaceae family. Though considered a little brown mushroom of unknown edibility, it is distinctive because of its <b>thick</b> <b>covering</b> of coarse hairs, and differentiated from other members of Crinipellis by its slightly larger cap size, which reaches up to [...] in diameter. The white gills {{on the underside of the}} cap are crowded closely together, and are free from attachment to the stem. Saprobic, it grows on the dead wood of deciduous trees from late summer to autumn. The fungus is found commonly in eastern North America, but has also been collected in Portugal and Korea. The variety C.zonata var. cremoricolor, found in eastern North America, may be distinguished microscopically by its longer spores.|$|E

2500|$|The town of Mole Creek lies at [...] {{above sea}} level. The Mole Creek-Chudleigh karst {{is an area}} {{underlain}} by limestone with underground streams, sinkholes and caves. It was formed when Gondwanaland was covered by a shallow sea approximately 500 million years ago. The area has a layer of Ordovician limestone, approximately [...] <b>thick</b> <b>covering</b> an area , and other sedimentary rocks. [...] The town {{is surrounded by a}} plain underlain by this limestone which crops up through the overlying sediments. Nearby hills have prominent basalt, limestone and dolerite depending on location. The flats are of alluvial origin with Permian sediments formed from mudstone and sandstone. The karst is riddled with over 400 caves and sinkholes, some of which are open to the public. [...] King Solomon's Cave and the Marakoopa Caves became part of a state cave reserve in 1939. The caves and many other parts of the karst became part of the Mole Creek Karst National Park when it was formed in 1996.|$|E

Seven specimens of M. zhaoianus have been described in detail, from which most feather impressions are known. Unusual even among early birds and feathered dinosaurs, Microraptor {{is one of the few}} known bird precursors to sport long flight feathers on the legs as well as the wings. Their bodies had a <b>thick</b> <b>covering</b> of feathers, with a diamond-shaped fan on the end of the tail (possibly for added stability during flight). Xu et al. (2003) compared the longer plumes on Microraptors head to those of the Philippine eagle. Bands of dark and light present on some specimens may indicate color patterns present in life, though at least some individuals almost certainly possessed an iridescent black coloration. Several anatomical features found in Microraptor, such as a combination of unserrated and partially serrated teeth with constricted 'waists', and unusually long upper arm bones, are shared with both primitive avians and primitive troodontids. Microraptor is particularly similar to the basal troodontid Sinovenator; in their 2002 description of two M. zhaoianus specimens, Hwang et al. note that this is not particularly surprising, given that both Microraptor and Sinovenator are very primitive members of two closely related groups, and both are close to the deinonychosaurian split between dromaeosaurids and troodontids.|$|E

50|$|The nīkau palm shows {{considerable}} {{variation in}} the wild. Plants from the South Island and the offshore islands of the North Island have larger, more-gracefully-arching fronds and are popular in cultivation. The Chatham Islands form is particularly different, having a distinct juvenile form and larger fruits, and a <b>thicker</b> <b>covering</b> of fine hairs on the fronds. More research is needed into its precise relationship with the mainland form. The New Zealand nīkau palm {{is very similar to}} Rhopalostylis baueri of the Kermadecs and Norfolk Island, which can be distinguished by its more rounded or oval fruits, and by its leaflets which are broader than those found in most populations of R. sapida.|$|R

Middleton was obliged to acquiesce, and, as it was confessedly dangerous to remain upon their feet, each one set about assisting in the means to be adopted for their security. Inez and Ellen were quickly bestowed beneath the warm and not uncomfortable shelter of the buffaloe skins, which formed a <b>thick</b> <b>covering,</b> and tall grass was drawn over the place, {{in such a manner}} as to evade any examination from a common eye.

"At Katimbang, {{from which}} place the island can be seen, it was {{noticed that a}} second column of vapour was {{ascending}} from {{the centre of the}} island, and that the appearance of Perboewatan had entirely changed, its conspicuous summit having apparently been blown away. In July there were some explosions of exceptional violence, and I have now no doubt that it was these we heard in the interior of this island when we were travelling hither, quite lately. On the 11th of this month, I believe, the island was visited in a boat by a government officer, but he did not land, owing to the heavy masses of vapour and dust driven about by the wind, which also prevented him from making a careful examination, but he could see that the forests of nearly the whole island have been destroyed--only a few trunks of blighted trees being left standing above the <b>thick</b> <b>covering</b> of pumice and dust.

60|$|It {{is true that}} I now saw {{a little}} more of my aunt, but she was in every way an unsocial being; and to a timid child she was as a plant beneath a <b>thick</b> <b>covering</b> of ice; I should cut my hands in endeavouring to get at it. So I was entirely thrown upon my own resourses. The {{neighbouring}} minister was engaged to give me lessons in reading, writing and french, but he was without family and his manners even to me were always perfectly characteristic of the profession in the exercise of whose functions he chiefly shone, that of a schoolmaster. I sometimes strove to form friendships with the most attractive of the girls who inhabited the neighbouring village; but I believe I should never have succeeded [even] had not my aunt interposed her authority to prevent all intercourse between me and the peasantry; for she was fearful lest I should acquire the scotch accent and dialect; a little of it I had, although great pains was taken that my tongue should not disgrace my English origin.|$|E
60|$|The Rio Grande and {{its tributaries}} for {{the most of their}} length in Texas ran between wide, low, flat lands covered by a dense growth of willow. Cottonwood, mesquite, prickly pear, and other growths mingled with the willow, and {{altogether}} they made a matted, tangled copse, a thicket that an inexperienced man would have considered impenetrable. From above, these wild brakes looked green and red; from the inside they were gray and yellow--a striped wall. Trails and glades were scarce. There were a few deer-runways and sometimes little paths made by peccaries--the jabali, or wild pigs, of Mexico. The ground was clay and unusually dry, sometimes baked so hard that it left no imprint of a track. Where a growth of cottonwood had held back the encroachment of the willows there usually was thick grass and underbrush. The willows were short, slender poles with stems so close together that they almost touched, and with the leafy foliage forming a <b>thick</b> <b>covering.</b> The depths of this brake Duane had penetrated was a silent, dreamy, strange place. In {{the middle of the day}} the light was weird and dim. When a breeze fluttered the foliage, then slender shafts and spears of sunshine pierced the green mantle and danced like gold on the ground.|$|E

I descended from the pi-pi, and attended by Kory-Kory, who on this occasion did not show his usual commiseration for my lameness, but seemed only anxious to hurry me on, walked away from the place.
