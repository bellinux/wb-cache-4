5|$|Nebraska widened {{its lead}} with a 33-yard {{touchdown}} run six {{minutes into the}} second half, but Tech answered right back with a 33-yard touchdown pass on its subsequent possession. The score cut Nebraska's lead to 24–21. Unfortunately for the Hokies, that score was the closest <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>get</b> to a lead as Nebraska's offense began to wear down the Tech defense. Nebraska scored another touchdown {{in the fourth quarter}}, then racked up 10points in the fourth quarter to secure the victory. Nebraska won, 41–21.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the other}} boys ran {{across the street to}} tell Curtis Jones what {{happened}} in the store. When the older man with whom Jones was playing checkers heard the story, he urged the boys to leave quickly, fearing violence. Bryant told others of the events at the store, and the story spread quickly. Jones and Till declined to tell his great-uncle Mose Wright, fearing <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>get</b> in trouble. Till said he wanted to return home to Chicago. Carolyn's husband Roy Bryant was on an extended trip hauling shrimp to Texas and did not return home until August 27.|$|E
5|$|Filming {{took place}} {{primarily}} in Cornwall and the Upper Boat Studios in Wales. The {{exterior of the}} pirate ship was filmed at a dock in Cornwall, while the lower decks were built from a set at the studio. The principal challenge to film at the dock was to ensure the audience would not see it. The crew set up smoke machines to simulate fog. To create the storm the crew used wind and rain machines, the latter of which went through 15,000 litres of water. The loud noise from the wind machines caused communication difficulties during takes. Anticipating <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>get</b> soaked, the cast present on the deck wore dry suits underneath their clothes. Before filming began on the storm sequences, Darvill heard that he would perform the stunt where he is thrown into the sea, and was willing to perform it. The stunt would later be performed by a double.|$|E

5|$|Five {{days after}} {{the closing of the}} Montreal Forum, the Canadiens played its first game at the Molson Centre (since renamed the Bell Centre). With a {{capacity}} of 22,500, the Bell Centre claims to be the largest indoor arena in North America. In the inaugural game, Montreal defeated the Rangers 4–2, with the first goal scored by Vincent Damphousse. The Canadiens qualified for the playoffs but struggled to achieve playoff success in the new arena during the arena's first three seasons. The Habs were eliminated {{in the first round of}} the playoffs by the Rangers in six games in 1996 and by the New Jersey Devils in 1997, respectively. In 1998, they won their first playoff series since their 1993 championship by defeating the Pittsburgh Penguins in six games; however, <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>get</b> swept by the Buffalo Sabres in the second round of the playoffs. It would be the last time the Canadiens would win a playoff series until 2002.|$|E
5|$|Officially {{having no}} role in the {{provisional}} government, Castro exercised a great deal of influence, largely because of his popularity and control of the rebel army. Ensuring the government implemented policies to cut corruption and fight illiteracy, he did not initially force through any radical proposals. Attempting to rid Cuba's government of Batistanos, the Congress elected under Batista was abolished, and all those elected in the rigged elections of 1954 and 1958 were banned from politics. The government now ruling by decree, Castro pushed the president to issue a temporary ban on all political parties, but repeatedly stated that <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>get</b> around to organizing multiparty elections; this never occurred. He began meeting members of the Popular Socialist Party, believing they had the intellectual capacity to form a socialist government, but repeatedly denied being a communist himself.|$|E
5|$|The cup {{stayed in}} the convent until 1882 when the nuns were short of funds and wanted to sell it. It was {{at some point during}} this period that the pearl border to the cover and the Tudor finial were removed. The nuns decided <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>get</b> a better price in Paris than in Spain, and the cup was {{entrusted}} to Simon Campo, a priest, who took it to Paris and approached several leading dealers and collectors. There had been a spate of forgeries of medieval objects, and the Parisians were suspicious, until one, Baron Jérôme Pichon, researched the second added cylinder and was sufficiently convinced that this was the cup documented in 1604 to make a rather low offer, which was accepted. In the course of his researches the baron had contacted the current Duke of Frías, who had supplied useful information, and then initially congratulated the buyer on his purchase. However, on looking further into the matter the duke realized that the sale was contrary to the 1610 deed of gift he had discovered in the family archives, and sued in the French courts to recover the cup.|$|E

50|$|We did {{the cover}} {{so it was}} a {{pastiche}} of something you would find in a Woolworth’s bargain bin. We took the photograph at the most famous suicide spot in England, called Beachy Head. So, the picture is not what it seems, it is not so nicey nicey at all, and neither is the music once you take it home and buy it. We had this idea in mind that someone quite innocently would come along to a record store and see record and think <b>they</b> <b>would</b> be <b>getting</b> 20 really good jazz/funk greats, and then <b>they</b> <b>would</b> put it on at home and <b>they</b> <b>would</b> just <b>get</b> decimated.|$|R
5|$|Willkie {{spent much}} of 1943 {{preparing}} for a second presidential run, addressing Republican and nonpartisan groups. He did not meet with Roosevelt; with the presidential election approaching and with both men likely to run in it as candidates, their continued association would have been awkward. Although they differed with him on many issues, Republican leaders recognized Willkie's appeal and they had wanted him to campaign for the party in the 1942 midterm elections, but he went around the world instead. The huge publicity received by the titular head of the Republican Party as an emissary for a Democratic president frustrated leading Republicans. In spite of this, the Republicans gained seats in both the House and the Senate, though they still remained in the minority. Few Republican members of Congress were by then willing to support Willkie, and he dropped to second place behind General Douglas MacArthur in polls of likely voters in the party's 1944 presidential primaries. By 1943, even liberal Democrats did not doubt Willkie's progressive credentials. He spoke of appointing an African American to either the cabinet or the Supreme Court, and he warned California's Republican committee that the New Deal was irreversible and he stated that all <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>get</b> by opposing it was oblivion.|$|E
25|$|The {{idea was}} to feed Canterbury enough runs so that <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>get</b> {{close enough to the}} target and then perhaps risk their last two wickets going for glory. They began the over on 196 for 8 with Germon 75 not out.|$|E

When Yuki gets married for real, Kawa helps her move and finds out that her new husband is a mean drunkard.|$|E

25|$|Early in {{the second}} half, Oliver fumbled a punt return that Johnston {{recovered}} {{to set up a}} Boniol field goal, cutting the deficit to 17–14. But this was as close as <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>get,</b> as the Panthers kicked three more field goals over the Cowboys one. On the ensuing drive, Johnson rushed six times for 44 yards to set up Kasay's 40-yard field goal. Then after a punt, he carried the ball six times for 22 yards to set up another score on Kasay's 40-yard kick a few plays into the fourth quarter.|$|E
25|$|The {{black market}} also {{attracted}} an export drain into the Gambia. The Senegalese government began {{to institute a}} delayed payment system with its groundnut (peanut) farms. When farmers sold their harvest to the Senegalese government, <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>get</b> a voucher, known as a chit, which they could turn into cash after a three-month waiting period. Not wanting {{to wait for the}} Senegalese marketing system to pay them, more farmers began to smuggle their goods to Banjul, where the Gambian government paid in cash; by 1990, estimates show that 20% of the Gambian groundnut market was from smuggled Senegalese crops.|$|E
25|$|During the 18th century, opium {{was found}} to be a good remedy for nervous disorders. Due to its {{sedative}} and tranquilizing properties, it was used to quiet the minds of those with psychosis, help with people who were considered insane, and also to help treat patients with insomnia. However, despite its medicinal values in these cases, it was noted that in cases of psychosis, it could cause anger or depression, and due to the drug's euphoric effects, it could cause depressed patients to become more depressed after the effects wore off because <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>get</b> used to being high.|$|E

25|$|In the {{championship}} game, Tennessee {{was too much}} for Rutgers. The Lady Vols had an eleven-point lead at halftime, which Rutgers cut to seven, but that was as close as <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>get.</b> Candace Parker scored 17 points, but Pat Summitt noted the contribution of their 5-foot 2-inch point guard Shannon Bobbitt, who hit two key three-pointers en route to scoring 13 points of her own. Tennessee won 59–46, bringing the seventh national championship to the school, and increasing the win total of Summitt to 947, which is 33 more than Bob Knight, the most victorious coach on the men's side.|$|E
25|$|One {{containing}} American species {{which are}} mainly black-footed, black-plumaged, and have yellow skin {{at the base}} of the bill as well as white display crests behind the eyes in breeding plumage. They occur in marine and freshwater habitats. The flightless cormorant of the Galápagos Islands also seems to belong here. Its wings have been reduced by evolution to a tiny size, it is extremely apomorphic due to its flightlessness, and its plumage is entirely nondescript. If considered a distinct genus, <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>get</b> the name Dilophalieus or (more probably) Nannopterum, the old genus of the flightless cormorant.|$|E
25|$|Whereas NBC {{normally}} televised 33 regular games per year, ABC would generally air {{fewer than}} 20 regular season games annually. According to NBA Commissioner David Stern, the reduced number of network telecasts {{was at the}} league's own request since the NBA believed that <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>get</b> a higher audience for a single game (in contrast to NBC's tripleheaders). From 2002 to 2006, the NBA's ratings on broadcast television (ABC) have dropped almost a full ratings point (from nearly a 3.0 average rating to just above a 2.0 rating). NBC averaged a 5.5 average rating during the 2002 NBA Playoffs. ABC averaged a 3.3 average rating for the 2005 NBA Playoffs.|$|E

50|$|Neil Duncanson (who joined Chrysalis as a {{freelance}} producer in 1991) suggested the documentary, though {{some of his colleagues}} believed <b>they</b> <b>would</b> never <b>get</b> permission.

25|$|The Netherlands' {{target was}} {{therefore}} 198 to win (in 36 overs), or 197 to tie. It is fair that their target was increased, {{even though they}} had the same number of overs to bat as Australia, as Australia would have batted less conservatively in their first 28 overs, and scored more runs at the expense of more wickets, if they had known that their innings would only be 36 overs long. Increasing the Netherlands' target score neutralizes the injustice done to Australia when they were denied some of the overs to bat they thought <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>get.</b> The Netherlands were all out for 122, giving Australia victory by 197 minus& 122 = 75 runs.|$|E
25|$|General {{bystander}} effect {{research was}} mainly {{conducted in the}} context of non-dangerous, non-violent emergencies. A study (2006) tested bystander effect in emergency situations to see if <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>get</b> the same results from other studies testing non-emergencies. In situations with low potential danger, significantly more help was given when the person was alone than when they were around another person. However, in situations with high potential danger, participants confronted with an emergency alone or in the presence of another person were similarly likely to help the victim. This suggests that in situations of greater seriousness {{it is more likely that}} people will interpret the situation as one in which help is needed and will be more likely to intervene.|$|E
25|$|The {{disaster}} in Fukushima has revealed {{the practice of}} Japanese nuclear power plants systematically using unskilled laborers with short contracts. These people are paid per day, and are hired per day from questionable agencies and firms. From data provided by NISA, {{it was concluded that}} 80 percent of all of the workforce hired in commercial nuclear power plants is done using temporary contracts, In Fukushima this number was even higher, at 89 percent. This had been practiced for decades. Unemployed people gathered in parks in the morning, and were picked up to be taken to the nuclear power plants. <b>They</b> <b>would</b> <b>get</b> a contract for a few months to do unskilled and the most dangerous labor. After the work was finished, these people were supposed to disappear.|$|E
