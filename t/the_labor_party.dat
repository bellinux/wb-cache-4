Weaver contested the result, accusing <b>the</b> <b>Labor</b> <b>Party</b> of manipulating the rolls. An inquiry found no fault in these accusations against <b>the</b> <b>Labor</b> <b>Party,</b> but instead found Weaver's own organisers guilty of roll-stuffing.|$|E

Under a legalistic interpretation of the ALP rules, Seiffert was readmitted to the party and, together with the support of Geraghty, McGirr and Labor were able to stay in power. On 20 June, Treatt declared that he and his party would not make any concessions or compromises to <b>the</b> <b>Labor</b> <b>Party,</b> particularly in regards to the election of a speaker.
