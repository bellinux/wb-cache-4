Like the first round, they stood up for a moment. At the beginning of the third round, Sherk took Hughes down, while Hughes attempted a kimura from the bottom.

5|$|Eggs are {{individually}} {{deposited on}} leaf hairs and corn silks (not in reference given). The eggs are initially pale green in color, {{but over time}} they turn yellowish and then grey. Eggs are 0.5mm in height and average about 0.55mm in diameter. They hatch after 66 to 72 hours of development. Once larvae have breached the chorion, they spend up to 85% of their time emerging from their shell. In this eclosion process, the larvae work to make the exit hole larger than their heads. Larvae spend <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> making a silk meshwork around the exit hole; this both helps them escape the shell and helps them find the shell afterwards so they can feed on it. After feeding on their shell, larvae rest about 3 minutes before they begin feeding on the plant material around them.|$|E

5|$|After John Myers' {{recommendations}} of a regulatory overhaul in commercial radio were published, and the Digital Economy Act 2010 allowing stations to co-locate or discontinue local shows and to broadcast on national DAB was passed, Smooth Radio merged its five English stations into one quasi-national station, and local news feeds were produced from GMG Radio's headquarters in Salford Quays. GMG Radio announced on 29 June 2010 that {{it wanted to}} compete with BBC Radio 2 by broadcasting on the Digital One multiplex on DAB to the whole of England and Wales, and Sky, Freesat, Freeview, Virgin Media and online. Regional content would be kept; split news, travel and weather bulletins would be broadcast on the FM and regional DAB stations in the North East, North West, West Midlands and East Midlands. Listeners in London and those tuning to the national output would hear national information. 105.2 Smooth Radio in Scotland would keep its local breakfast and drivetime programmes because of the rules governing its broadcast licence, but networked content would be broadcast <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>time.</b> The jazz commitments for London and the North West were also ended.

It secured Beja and then sent out patrols to harass German troops, ambushing a convoy and inflicting numerous German casualties, and defended a bridge at Medjez el Bab, although it was eventually forced to retreat. Hill was wounded during an attack by the battalion on Gue Hill, in which he attempted to capture three Italian tanks using his revolver; the crews of two were successfully subdued without incident, but the third opened fire and hit Hill in the chest several times. He was awarded the Distinguished Service Order (DSO) and Légion d'Honneur for his service in North Africa and then evacuated back to England. There he took command of the 3rd Parachute Brigade in the newly formed 6th Airborne Division, and jumped with the brigade during Operation Tonga, the British airborne landings in Normandy {{on the night of}} 5/6 June 1944.

40|$|Background The adult smoking {{prevalence}} {{has declined}} more in California than <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> US {{in the past}} 2 decades. Further, California has faster declines in cancer mortality, lung cancer incidence and heart disease mortality. However, no study has examined smoking-related cancer mortality between California and <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> US. Methods The smoking-attributable cancer mortality rate (SACMR) from 1979 to 2005 in California and <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> US are calculated among men and women 35 {{years of age or}} older using the Joinpoint regression model to calculate the SACMR annual percentage change. The SACMR is <b>the</b> sum <b>of</b> <b>the</b> smoking-attributable death rates of 10 smoking-attributable cancers. Results The SACMR has declined more in California (25. 7 %) than <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> US (8. 9 %) from 1979 to 2005. California men had a lower SACMR than <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> US over the entire study period, with the difference tripling from 7. 4 % in 1979 to 23. 9 % in 2005. <b>The</b> difference <b>of</b> female SACMR between California and <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> US went from 17. 9 % higher in 1979 to 13. 4 % lower in 2005. Conclusions California’s SACMR decrease started 7 years earlier than <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> US (1984 vs 1991), and California experienced an accelerated decline <b>of</b> SACMR compared to <b>the</b> <b>rest</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> US overall and among men and women from 1979 to 2005.
