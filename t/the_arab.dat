5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Arab</b> {{army was}} well-provisioned, with Arab {{accounts}} reporting high mounds of supplies {{piled up in}} their camp, and had even brought along wheat to sow and harvest the next year. The failure of <b>the</b> <b>Arab</b> navy to blockade the city, however, meant that the Byzantines too could ferry in provisions. In addition, <b>the</b> <b>Arab</b> army had already devastated the Thracian countryside during its march and could not rely on it for foraging. <b>The</b> <b>Arab</b> fleet and the second Arab army, which operated in the Asian suburbs of Constantinople, were able to bring in limited supplies to Maslama's army. As the siege drew into winter, negotiations opened between the two sides, extensively reported by Arab sources but ignored by Byzantine historians. According to <b>the</b> <b>Arab</b> accounts, Leo continued to play a double game with the Arabs. One version claims that he tricked Maslama into handing over most of his grain supplies, while another claims that <b>the</b> <b>Arab</b> general was persuaded to burn them altogether, so as to show {{the inhabitants of the}} city that they faced an imminent assault and induce them to surrender. The winter of 718 was extremely harsh; snow covered the ground for over three months. As the supplies in <b>the</b> <b>Arab</b> camp ran out, a terrible famine broke out: the soldiers ate their horses, camels, and other livestock, and the bark, leaves and roots of trees. They swept the snow of the fields they had sown to eat the green shoots, and reportedly resorted to cannibalism and eating their own excrement. Consequently, <b>the</b> <b>Arab</b> army was ravaged by epidemics; with great exaggeration, the Lombard historian Paul the Deacon put the number of their dead of hunger and disease at 300,000.|$|E

However, in 654, the Karenids under Karin, along with the Hephthalites under Nezak Tarkan, made an insurrection against <b>the</b> <b>Arabs.</b> <b>The</b> {{rebellion}} spread in Herat, Badghis and Quhistan, and later they even managed to repel <b>the</b> <b>Arabs</b> from Nishapur and Balkh.

50|$|The Siege of Shushtar {{was fought}} from 641 to 642 between the Sasanian Empire and <b>the</b> invading <b>Arab</b> Muslims of <b>the</b> Rashidun Caliphate. Shushtar was an ancient strong stronghold in Khuzestan, and was {{attacked}} by <b>the</b> <b>Arabs</b> under their commander Abu Musa Ashaari. Although the city managed to resist <b>the</b> <b>Arabs,</b> <b>the</b> Sasanians later faced desertion, which resulted in <b>the</b> <b>Arabs</b> capturing <b>the</b> city and capturing its commander, Hormuzan.|$|R
50|$|However, <b>the</b> <b>Arabs</b> were {{eventually}} defeated {{at the battle}} of the Bridge. This made Busbuhra change his allegiance back to the Sasanians. He shortly confronted <b>the</b> <b>Arabs</b> at Burs, but was defeated and routed, while also wounded by a spear. He then fled to Bavel (Babylon) and regrouped with Sasanian troops and officers, who had survived another battle with <b>the</b> <b>Arabs</b> at al-Qadisiya. Busbuhra, however, died due to his wounds before he could confront <b>the</b> <b>Arabs</b> once more.|$|R
5|$|Aflaq {{at first}} {{extended}} his {{support to the}} new government, believing {{that he and the}} Ba'ath Party could collaborate with Shishakli because they shared the same Arab nationalist sentiments. His analysis of Shishakli proved to be wrong, and one of Shishakli's first decisions as ruler was to ban all political parties, including the Ba'ath Party. The Ba'ath Party leadership, and several leading members, escaped to Lebanon in the wake of increased government repression. In Lebanon Aflaq and al-Bitar agreed to a merger of <b>the</b> <b>Arab</b> Ba'ath Party and <b>the</b> <b>Arab</b> Socialist Party (ASP), led by Akram al-Hawrani, to establish <b>the</b> <b>Arab</b> Socialist Ba'ath Party in 1952. The newly formed party worked as a base of operation against Shishali's rule – Aflaq and the rest cooperated with non-Ba'athist opposition forces too. Shishakli was toppled in February 1954.|$|E
5|$|After {{wintering}} in {{the western}} coastlands of Asia Minor, <b>the</b> <b>Arab</b> army crossed into Thrace in early summer 717 and built siege lines to blockade the city, which was protected by the massive Theodosian Walls. <b>The</b> <b>Arab</b> fleet, which accompanied the land army and was meant to complete the city's blockade by sea, was neutralized soon after its arrival by the Byzantine navy {{through the use of}} Greek fire. This allowed Constantinople to be resupplied by sea, while <b>the</b> <b>Arab</b> army was crippled by famine and disease during the unusually hard winter that followed. In spring 718, two Arab fleets sent as reinforcements were destroyed by the Byzantines after their Christian crews defected, and an additional army sent overland through Asia Minor was ambushed and defeated. Coupled with attacks by the Bulgars on their rear, the Arabs were forced to lift the siege on 15 August 718. On its return journey, <b>the</b> <b>Arab</b> fleet was almost completely destroyed by natural disasters and Byzantine attacks.|$|E
5|$|As {{reported}} by the Byzantine chronicler Theophanes the Confessor, <b>the</b> <b>Arab</b> attack was methodical: in 672–673 Arab fleets secured bases along the coasts of Asia Minor, and then proceeded to install a loose blockade around Constantinople. They used the peninsula of Cyzicus near {{the city as a}} base to spend the winter, and returned every spring to launch attacks against the city's fortifications. Finally, the Byzantines, under Emperor Constantine IV, managed to destroy <b>the</b> <b>Arab</b> navy using a new invention, the liquid incendiary substance known as Greek fire. <b>The</b> <b>Arab</b> land army in Asia Minor was also defeated by the Byzantines, forcing the Arabs to lift the siege. The Byzantine victory was of major importance for the survival of the Byzantine state, as <b>the</b> <b>Arab</b> threat receded for a time. A peace treaty was signed soon after, and following the outbreak of another Muslim civil war, the Byzantines even experienced a period of ascendancy over the Caliphate.|$|E

5|$|Despite his {{popularity}} {{with the people}} of <b>the</b> <b>Arab</b> world, by mid-1957 his only regional ally was Syria. In September, Turkish troops massed along the Syrian border, giving credence to rumors that the Baghdad Pact countries were attempting to topple Syria's leftist government. Nasser sent a contingent force to Syria as a symbolic display of solidarity, further elevating his prestige in <b>the</b> <b>Arab</b> world, and particularly among Syrians.|$|E
5|$|In spring, new {{reinforcements}} {{were sent}} by the new caliph, Umar ibn Abd al-Aziz (r. 717–720), by sea from Africa and Egypt and over land through Asia Minor. The crews of the new fleets were composed mostly of Christians, who began defecting in large numbers, while the land forces were ambushed and defeated in Bithynia. As famine and an epidemic continued to plague <b>the</b> <b>Arab</b> camp, the siege was abandoned on 15 August 718. On its return, <b>the</b> <b>Arab</b> fleet suffered further casualties to storms and an eruption of the volcano of Thera.|$|E
50|$|According {{to another}} version {{written in the}} Khuzestan Chronicle, similar to the version by al-Tabari, a {{defector}} from Qatar, along with another person, asked <b>the</b> <b>Arabs</b> for some of their plunder in exchange for how to enter <b>the</b> city. <b>The</b> <b>Arabs</b> agreed, and after some time, they managed to enter the city. According to al-Baladhuri, during <b>the</b> siege, <b>the</b> <b>Arabs</b> were reinforced {{with a group of}} professional Iranian elites under Siyah al-Uswari, known as the Asawira. The reason for their defection was in order to preserve their status and wealth. However, according to the Khuzestan Chronicle, the Asawira first defected to <b>the</b> <b>Arabs</b> after they entered Shushtar. The brother of Hormuzan, Shahriyar, {{is said to have been}} a part of the Asawira. According to Pourshariati, the story of the Asawira helping <b>the</b> <b>Arabs</b> in their conquest of Khuzestan, may have been false. Nevertheless, it is known that Hormuzan was after his surrender taken by <b>the</b> <b>Arabs</b> and brought to their capital Medina.|$|R

5|$|Initially, the {{governing}} power within Israel remained silent. However, on May 27, the Israeli daily Maariv printed a sceptical coverage of Arab accounts, which {{spoke of a}} great victory by <b>the</b> <b>Arab</b> Legion, involving some 800 Israeli dead. In response, the Israeli press stressed that {{the aim of the}} operation was not to take Latrun, but to strike the Legion and, on June 1, it published casualty figures of 250 deaths for <b>the</b> <b>Arab</b> side and 10 deaths, with 20 badly wounded, and another 20 lightly wounded on the Israeli side.|$|E
5|$|It {{was in this}} {{environment}} that the ideology of Ba'athism came into being. <b>The</b> <b>Arab</b> Ba'ath Movement was established by Michel Aflaq and Salah al-Din al-Bitar in the 1940s, others who played a notable role {{in the early stages}} of the Ba'athist movement were Zaki al-Arsuzi, Wahib al-Ghanim and Jallal al-Sayyid. Akram al-Hawrani founded <b>the</b> <b>Arab</b> Socialist Party (ASP) in 1953 – the Ba'ath Party was established through a merger of the ASP and <b>the</b> <b>Arab</b> Ba'ath Party. Of the 150 delegates to the founding congress of <b>the</b> <b>Arab</b> Ba'ath Party in 1947, the majority were either middle-class professionals or intellectuals. By the 1950s the party had managed to acquire an urban middle class base. However, the Ba'ath Party was not a purely middle class party, and from the very beginning, it sent party cadres to rural areas to recruit new members and form new party organisations. In 1956, the Ba'ath Party organized the first labour protest in Syrian history. While the Ba'ath Party was strong, its decision to recruit members from across society led to tribalism and clientelism within the party. Party leaders then opted to overlook democratic norms and procedures.|$|E

The ALA's establishment was sponsored by <b>the</b> <b>Arab</b> League following the UN partition vote and Fawzi al-Qawuqji, a Syrian commander who played leading roles in the Great Syrian Revolt and the 1936 revolt in Palestine, was appointed its commander. Quwatli did not believe the armies of Syria and <b>the</b> <b>Arab</b> world were ready to successfully confront Jewish forces and as war drew near in early 1948, he petitioned Abdel Rahman Azzam, head of <b>the</b> <b>Arab</b> League, to not enter Arab armies into Palestine. Instead, Quwatli offered to provide local Palestinian Arab fighters arms and funding. Azzam was not swayed and continued his effort of rallying Arab governments to dispatch their armies.
