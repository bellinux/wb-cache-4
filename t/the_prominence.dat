5|$|Nevertheless, Antillean {{music can}} be {{characterized}} by <b>the</b> <b>prominence</b> of the Carnival celebration (prominently from Trinidad and Tobago), {{and the importance of}} calypso-like song traditions. The Lesser Antilles is also home to a strong Indo-Caribbean population; though Indo-Caribbean music is found elsewhere in the Caribbean, <b>the</b> <b>prominence</b> of Indian-influenced styles is a hallmark of the Antillean music scenes. Regional forms can also be found outside of the Caribbean entirely, most notably in New York City, where Brooklyn's Labor Day Carnival features music and parades, mas and steel bands; this Carnival is distinct to New York, and reflects elements of a pan-Caribbean nature.|$|E
50|$|As <b>the</b> maxillary <b>prominences</b> {{continue}} growing they merge laterally with <b>the</b> mandibular <b>prominences</b> to form <b>the</b> cheeks. Their growth compresses <b>the</b> medial nasal <b>prominences</b> {{and causes}} them to fuse around the 10th week of development. This establishes {{the bridge of the}} nose and the intermaxillary segment, which is the region of <b>the</b> medial nasal <b>prominence</b> located inferior to the bridge of the nose and superior to <b>the</b> mandibular <b>prominence.</b> <b>The</b> intermaxillary segment yields the portion of the upper lip containing the philtrum, the upper jaw with 4 incisors, and the primary palate. <b>The</b> medial <b>prominence</b> fuses with <b>the</b> maxillary <b>prominence,</b> giving rise to a smooth upper lip while fusing the primary and secondary palate. Meanwhile, <b>the</b> lateral nasal <b>prominence</b> gives rise to the alae of the nose and fuses with <b>the</b> maxillary <b>prominence,</b> forming <b>the</b> Nasolacrimal duct. This duct is formed when the ectoderm thickens into a cord and sinks into the underlying mesenchyme.|$|R

40|$|The {{optical depth}} {{at the head}} of the Lyman continuum, tau sub H, was {{determined}} at several positions in three hedgerow prominences using spectroheliograms of C III 977 A, LC 896 A, and O IV 554 A, observed with the Harvard experiment on Skylab. It is found that tau sub H varies over a wide range at positions even in a single <b>prominence.</b> At <b>the</b> central part of <b>the</b> <b>prominences</b> where <b>the</b> opacity is largest, tau sub H reaches a maximum value of 30 to 50 for <b>the</b> three <b>prominences.</b> In general, tau sub H decreases with height in <b>the</b> <b>prominences.</b> Most positions near the outer boundary of <b>the</b> <b>prominences</b> are optically thin in the LC (tau sub H less than 1).

5|$|Despite {{their legal}} {{privileges}} over that of merchants, {{the work of}} artisans was considered by Han Confucian scholars to be of secondary importance to that of farmers. This is perhaps largely because scholars and officials could not survive without the farmer's product and taxes paid in grain. The government relied on taxed grain to fund its military campaigns and stored surplus grain to mitigate widespread famine during times of poor harvest. Despite <b>the</b> <b>prominence</b> given to farmers, Confucian scholars did accept that artisans performed a vital economic role. This view was only rejected by {{a small minority of}} Legalists, who advocated a society of only soldiers and farmers, and certain Daoists who wanted everyone to live in self-sufficient villages and without commercial interests.|$|E
5|$|For a long time, {{bivalves}} {{were thought}} to be better adapted to aquatic life than brachiopods were, outcompeting and relegating them to minor niches in later ages. These two taxa appeared in textbooks as an example of replacement by competition. Evidence given for this included the fact that bivalves needed less food to subsist because of their energetically efficient ligament-muscle system for opening and closing valves. All this has been broadly disproven, though; rather, <b>the</b> <b>prominence</b> of modern bivalves over brachiopods seems due to chance disparities in their response to extinction events.|$|E
5|$|In most cases, thyroid cancer {{presents}} as a painless {{mass in the}} neck. It is {{very unusual}} for thyroid cancers to present with other symptoms, although in some cases cancer may cause hyperthyroidism. Most malignant thyroid cancers are papillary, followed by follicular, medullary, and thyroid lymphoma. Because of <b>the</b> <b>prominence</b> of the thyroid gland, cancer is often detected earlier {{in the course of}} disease as the cause of a nodule, which may undergo fine needle aspiration. Thyroid function tests will help reveal whether the nodule produces excess thyroid hormones. A radioactive iodine uptake test can help reveal the activity and location of the cancer and metastases.|$|E

30|$|We {{now know}} that <b>the</b> <b>prominences</b> form <b>the</b> core of most CMEs. After the {{demonstration}} by Janssen and Lockyer in 1868 that prominences can be observed outside of eclipses using spectroscopes, <b>the</b> knowledge on <b>prominences</b> grew rapidly. By 1871, Secchi classified prominences into active and quiescent prominences. By 1892, it was a common knowledge that prominences erupted with speeds exceeding 100 Â s of km/s (from Tandberg-Hanssen 1995). The disk counterpart of eruptive prominences was termed as disparition brusque (DB) by dâ€™Azambuja and dâ€™Azambuja (1948).|$|R

5|$|In the {{tradition}} of sixteenth-century royal festivals, Catherine de' Medici's magnificences took place over several days, with a different entertainment each day. Often individual nobles or {{members of the royal}} family were responsible for preparing one particular entertainment. Spectators and participants, including those involved in martial sports, would dress up in costumes representing mythological or romantic themes. Catherine gradually introduced changes to {{the tradition}}al form of these entertainments. She forbade heavy tilting of the sort that led to the death of her husband in 1559; and she developed and increased <b>the</b> <b>prominence</b> of dance in the shows that climaxed each series of entertainments. As a result, the ballets de cour, a distinctive new art form, emerged from the creative advances in court entertainment devised by Catherine de' Medici.|$|E
5|$|Like other conduct {{books of}} the time, Thoughts adapts older genres to the new middle-class ethos. The book {{encourages}} mothers to teach their daughters analytical thinking, self-discipline, honesty, contentment in their social position, and marketable skills (in case they should ever need to support themselves). These goals reveal Wollstonecraft's intellectual debt to John Locke; however, <b>the</b> <b>prominence</b> she affords religious faith and innate feeling distinguishes her work from his. Her aim is to educate women to be useful wives and mothers, because, she argues, it is through these roles that they can most effectively contribute to society. The predominantly domestic role Wollstonecraft outlines for womena role that she viewed as meaningfulwas interpreted by 20th-century feminist literary critics as paradoxically confining them to the private sphere.|$|E

40|$|During a {{total eclipse}} of the sun, when the light of the disk is {{completely}} cut off by the moon, the solar atmosphere is momentarily revealed.
