Subjects and methods: The subjects were six patients who underwent CPO and six healthy adults. Gait analysis was performed before surgery and at an average of 7. 3 months after surgery using a three-dimensional motion analysis system. Temporospatial factors (gait velocity and stride length) and kinematic factors (range of motion of the hip joint in the sagittal plane, and ranges of <b>tilting</b> <b>movement</b> of the trunk and of the pelvic region in the coronal plane) were evaluated. Results: Gait velocity increased after surgery, but it was significantly lower than that of the healthy group (P< 0. 05). Stride length significantly increased after surgery compared to before surgery (P< 0. 05), though the significant difference seen before surgery disappeared. The full range of motion of the hip joint in the sagittal plane during walking increased after surgery, though the significant difference evident between the two groups before surgery also disappeared. The range of <b>tilting</b> <b>movement</b> of the trunk during walking increased after surgery, with a significant difference emerging when compared to the healthy group, which was not observed before surgery (P< 0. 05). Conclusion: The characteristics of gait were investigated in patients treated with CPO before and after surgery, and compared with those in healthy subjects. Gait improved, except for sway of the trunk while walking, despite the analysis being performed soon after surgery.

40|$|The Division of Subatomic Physics and Plasma Physics (formerly Division of Nuclear Engineering) in Chalmers, Göteborg, and the Ringhals Nuclear Plant have {{investigated}} the core barrel vibrations in the Ringhals PWRs over the last 20 years. Based on the different symmetry properties of the vibration modes, a mode separation technique was developed to enhance the contributions from the different modes. Recent observations of wear at both the lower and upper core-barrel-support structures in the Ringhals PWRs indicated that vibration modes of the core barrel other than pendular (beam mode) and shell mode are likely to occur. A beam mode type movement alone {{is not able to}} explain such a wear, and therefore, it is fair to assume that the vibration mode in question is a small amplitude periodic <b>tilting</b> <b>movement</b> of the core barrel around a horizontal, diagonal pivot at the half height of the core.

40|$|The aim of {{the present}} work was to {{determine}} if the elbow joint instability and translatory movements during elbow flexion lead to significant errors in elbow angle perception. The matching elbow was fixed on a rocking platform of two different heights so that the elbow flexion was associated with <b>tilting</b> <b>movement</b> of the support and the angle/torque relation-ship changed depending on the height of the platform. The matching on any of the rocking supports did not cause an over-flexion constant error but it did increase the error variance, especially in the high rocking support condition. An adaptation to the rocking support condition was revealed by an after-effect resulting in an overestimation of the reference angle in the final testing on a rigid support. It is concluded that the elbow angle percep-tion is modified as a result of adaptation to the rocking support, which is associated with recalibration of position sense during the experimental session. The results are consistent with the hypothesis that the estimation of the elbow joint angle depends on the internal representation of the arm’s dynamics...|$|E

Our duties are to suggest a direction oftheir program, to prepare simple and inexpensive methods for their observation of natural phenomenaassociated with the occurrence of earthquakes, and to study with them on characteristics of precursoryphenomena of big earthauakes. In this paper we have described on some kinds of methods newly designed for the continuousobservation of the variation of ground water level, ground <b>tilt</b> <b>movement</b> and self-potential. To observe the variation of ground water level we designed a new digital water level gauge. It is composed of a float, photo-electric detectors, a digital IC circuit, a up/down counter and LEDdisplay. This water level gauge has very high sensitivity and can detect 1 mm change of water level. Now twenty gauges have been settled on the well {{in or near the}} campus of model high schools andcontinuous observation by them have been carried out. For the observation of ground <b>tilt</b> <b>movements</b> long span water pipe tiltmeters have been set inthe shallow underground of the campus of each high school. They have two components which areperpendicular to each other and spans of more than 50 meters. We calculate the variation of tiltfrom data of changes of water level detected by magnetic sensors. Although water pipes are buriedin 1 meter depth from the ground surface and so a noise level is comparatively high, we can detecta <b>tilt</b> <b>movement</b> of 5 x 10 - 6 radian by only reading output voltage of sensors once in a day. In thecase of continuous recording of signals we can detect a tilt of 0. 1 x 10 - 6 radian. The variation of self-potential is continuously recorded on a paper chart by a multi-channelrecorder.

40|$|The {{direction}} of flagellar rotation is regulated by a rotor-mounted protein assembly, termed the “switch complex,” formed from multiple {{copies of the}} proteins FliG, FliM, and FliN. The structures of major parts of these proteins are known, and the overall organization of proteins in the complex has been elucidated previously {{using a combination of}} protein-binding, mutational, and cross-linking approaches. In Escherichia coli, the switch from counterclockwise to clockwise rotation is triggered by the signaling protein phospho-CheY, which binds to {{the lower part of the}} switch complex and induces small movements of FliM and FliN subunits relative to each other. Direction switching also must produce movements in the upper part of the complex, particularly in the C-terminal domain of FliG (FliGC), which interacts with the stator to generate the torque for flagellar rotation. In the present study, protein movements in the middle and upper parts of the switch complex have been probed by means of targeted cross-linking and mutational analysis. Switching induces a <b>tilting</b> <b>movement</b> of the FliM domains that form the middle part of the switch and a consequent rotation of the affixed FliGC domains that reorients the stator interaction sites by about 90 °.

40|$|Studies {{investigating}} {{the effects of}} observing a gaze shift in another person often apply static images of a person with an averted gaze, while measuring response times to a peripheral target. Static images, however, are unlike how we normally perceive gaze shifts of others. Moreover, response times might only reveal {{the effects of a}} cue on covert attention and might fail to uncover cueing effects on overt attention or response preparation. We therefore extended the standard paradigm and measured cueing effects for ore realistic, dynamic cues (video clips),while comparing response times, saccade direction errors and saccade trajectories. Three cues were compared: A social cue, consisting of a eye-gaze shift, and two socially less relevant cues, consisting of a head <b>tilting</b> <b>movement</b> and a person walking past. Similar results were found for the two centrally presented cues (eye-gaze shift and head tilting) on all three response measures, suggesting that cueing is unaffected by the social status of the cue. Interestingly, the cue showing a person walking past showed a dissociation {{in the direction of the}} effects on response times on the one hand, and saccade direction errors and latencies on the other hand, suggesting the involvement of two types of (endogenous and exogenous) attention or a distinction between attention and saccadic response preparation.

30|$|Upon protonation, the proton-titratable, key residue D 407 TM 4 {{positioned}} {{in the middle}} of the TM domain is subjected to an additional electrostatic force (Fig. S 3). Together with hydrophobic mismatch forces (Mouritsen and Bloom, 1984), this electrostatic force generates a mechanical torque and is likely to result in tilting of the TM domain. Through the connecting peptides, this <b>tilting</b> <b>movement</b> of the TM domain relative to the membrane is likely to drive the conformational change inside the porter domain and results in substrate transport. Previously, it has been shown that many mutations in the H-bond network around the protonation site, e.g., at positions D 407, D 408, K 940, and T 978, result in reduced transport activity. In the present work, we further showed that properly switching off the proton wire connecting to the cytosolic side is essential for EcAcrB transport activity. Disrupting the switching process (e.g., L 944 N) abolishes transport activity (Fig.  2 D). Furthermore, the electrostatic force exerted on the titratable key residue D 407 TM 4 does not pass through the amphipathic helix α 6 - 7 (which is attached to the cytosolic surface of the membrane). Thus, this helix is expected to serve as a pivotal point to generate the rotation torque required for tilting of the TM domain when protonation occurs. Our mutagenesis data showed that disrupting the amphipathic property of α 6 - 7 or its interaction with the TM domain reduces or abolishes the transport activity of EcAcrB (Fig.  2 C).|$|E
40|$|Impaired {{balance control}} is a {{hallmark}} symptom in Parkinson's disease (PD). Altered sensory-motor integration contributes to the deficiency. We aimed to determine whether impaired vestibular signal processing added to the disorder. We exposed patients (N = 11; 68 ± 6 y) and age-matched healthy subjects (hS: N = 19; 65 ± 11 y) on a motion platform in complete darkness to two consecutive forward <b>tilt</b> <b>movements</b> (12 series; N = 24; overall 288 trials) {{and asked them to}} indicate which tilt was perceived larger. By combing <b>tilt</b> <b>movements</b> with translations we manipulated vestibular sensory input in order to investigate whether putative impairment resulted from a deficiency of the sensory organs (semicircular canals in 'single-SCC-cue-condition', otoliths in 'single-OT-cue-condition') themselves or to a sensory integration failure ('multi-cue-condition'). Tilt discrimination in the multi-cue-condition was inferior in patients compared to hS (p = 0. 02). No {{significant differences between the two}} groups were found for both single-cue-conditions. Comparison of multi-cue-condition with a prediction resulting from the combination of both single-cue-conditions by optimal observer theory revealed that patients (p = 0. 04), in contrast to hS, failed to efficiently combine SCC and OT information to improve tilt perception. We found that PD patients distinguished forward tilts less precise than hS, suggesting impaired vestibular perception. Tilt discrimination in patients, moreover, did not improve as much as in hS in conditions where both SCC and OT information was available compared to conditions where only SCC or OT cues were activated. The latter provides evidence that tilt misperception in PD most likely results from an integration failure of vestibular signals...|$|R
