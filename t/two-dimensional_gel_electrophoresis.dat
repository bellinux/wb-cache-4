50|$|PROTOMAP is a {{recently}} developed proteomic technology for identifying changes to proteins that manifest in altered migration by one-dimensional SDS-PAGE. It is similar, conceptually, to <b>two-dimensional</b> <b>gel</b> <b>electrophoresis</b> and difference gel electrophoresis {{in that it}} enables global identification of proteins that undergo altered electrophoretic migration resulting from, for example, proteolysis or post-translational modification. However, it is unique in that all proteins are sequenced using mass spectrometry which provides information on the sequence coverage detected in each isoform of each protein thereby facilitating interpretation of proteolytic events.|$|E
50|$|In {{light of}} these problems, the methods of one- and <b>two-dimensional</b> <b>gel</b> <b>electrophoresis</b> and high {{performance}} liquid chromatography are widely used for separation of proteins. The first method fractionates whole proteins via <b>two-dimensional</b> <b>gel</b> <b>electrophoresis.</b> The first-dimension of 2D gel is isoelectric focusing (IEF). In this dimension, the protein is separated by its isoelectric point (pI) and the second-dimension is SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE). This dimension separates the protein according to its molecular weight. Once this step is completed in-gel digestion occurs. In some situations, {{it may be necessary}} to combine both of these techniques. Gel spots identified on a 2D Gel are usually attributable to one protein. If the identity of the protein is desired, usually the method of in-gel digestion is applied, where the protein spot of interest is excised, and digested proteolytically. The peptide masses resulting from the digestion can be determined by mass spectrometry using peptide mass fingerprinting. If this information does not allow unequivocal identification of the protein, its peptides can be subject to tandem mass spectrometry for de novo sequencing. Small changes in mass and charge can be detected with 2D-PAGE. The disadvantages with this technique are its small dynamic range compared to other methods, some proteins are still difficult to separate due to their acidity, basicity, hydrophobicity, and size (too large or too small).|$|E

Proteomics and metabolomics have no standardized procedures yet, but usually, proteome analysis is done by <b>two-dimensional</b> <b>gel</b> <b>electrophoresis</b> and Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry, while metabolome analysis is conducted through gas chromatography-mass spectrometry, liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry and liquid chromatography-nuclear magnetic resonance.

50|$|In 2000 Tjalsma et al. {{coined the}} term 'secretome' {{in their study of}} the {{eubacterium}} B. subtilis.

In 2001 the same lab set a standard of secretomics - predictions based on amino acid sequence alone are not enough to define the secretome. They used <b>two-dimensional</b> <b>gel</b> <b>electrophoresis</b> and mass spectrometry to identify 82 proteins secreted by B. subtilis, only 48 of which had been predicted using the genome-based method of their previous paper.

50|$|Quantitative {{proteomics}} is {{an analytical}} chemistry technique {{for determining the}} amount of proteins in a sample. Rather than just providing lists of proteins identified in a certain sample, quantitative proteomics yields information about differences between samples. For example, this approach {{can be used to}} compare samples from healthy and diseased patients. The methods for protein identification are identical to those used in general (i.e. qualitative) proteomics, but include quantification as an additional dimension. Quantitative proteomics is mainly performed by <b>two-dimensional</b> <b>gel</b> <b>electrophoresis</b> (2-DE) or mass spectrometry (MS). However, a recent developed method of Quantitative Dot Blot (QDB) analysis is able to measure both the absolute and relative quantity of an individual proteins in the sample in high throughput format, thus open a new direction for proteomic research.
