5|$|Because the feats <b>the</b> <b>Baron</b> {{describes}} are overtly implausible, {{they are}} easily recognizable as fiction, {{with a strong}} implication that <b>the</b> <b>Baron</b> is a liar. Whether he expects his audience to believe him varies from version to version; in Raspe's original 1785 text, he simply narrates his stories without further comment, but in the later extended versions he is insistent that he is telling the truth. In any case, <b>the</b> <b>Baron</b> appears to believe every word of his own stories, no matter how internally inconsistent they become, and he usually appears tolerantly indifferent to any disbelief he encounters in others.|$|E

5|$|In {{the first}} {{published}} illustrations, {{which may have}} been drawn by Raspe himself, <b>the</b> <b>Baron</b> appears slim and youthful. For the 1792 Sequel to the Adventures of Baron Munchausen, an anonymous artist drew <b>the</b> <b>Baron</b> as a dignified but tired old soldier whose face is marred by injuries from his adventures; this illustration remained the standard portrait of <b>the</b> <b>Baron</b> for about seventy years, and its imagery was echoed in Cruikshank's depictions of the character. Doré, illustrating a Théophile Gautier fils translation in 1862, retained the sharply beaked nose and twirled moustache from the 1792 portrait, but gave <b>the</b> <b>Baron</b> a healthier and more affable appearance; the Doré Baron became the definitive visual representation for the character.|$|E

Originally, <b>the</b> <b>barons</b> were charged with bearing a ceremonial canopy over the sovereign during the procession to and from Westminster Abbey.
