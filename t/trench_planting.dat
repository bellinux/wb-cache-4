In Western Australia (WA) the development of decentralised systems has been slow. However significant steps have been made towards making decentralisation a reality, with several innovative technologies based on natural biological processes being trialed, such as constructed wetlands. The WA State Government is investing research in practical case studies that will assess the viability of decentralised wastewater schemes, within WA urban villages. The research is to be conducted over three years starting with two decentralised greywater systems, progressing in the final year (2008) with research into combined wastewater systems. The first case study site, Bridgewater Lifestyle Village (BWLV) located in Erskine south of Perth, will encompass 380 individual greywater systems that are centrally managed with the treated greywater used to irrigate the gardens of each home. The second site, Timbers Edge Residential Resort (TERV) located in Dawesville also south of Perth, will encompass 260 homes connected to one centrally managed greywater treatment system, with the treated greywater being used to irrigate the estates public open space. Both of these sites are located in a high population growth corridor adjacent to the Peel Harvey Estuary; are within close proximity to RAMSAR 5 protected wetlands; and experience high water table levels. In order to meet environmental and public health concerns, innovative solutions would be required. Each site employs a wastewater treatment and recycling system that mimics natural processes.

5000|$|Some herbivores use feeding {{behaviors}} {{that are capable of}} disarming the defenses of their host plants. One such plant defensive strategy is the use of latex and resin canals that contain sticky toxins and digestibility reducers. These canal systems store fluids under pressure, and when ruptured (i.e. from herbivory) secondary metabolic products flow to the release point. [...] Herbivores can evade this defense, however, by damaging the leaf veins. This technique minimizes the outflow of latex or resin beyond the cut and allows herbivores to freely feed above the damaged section. Several strategies are employed by herbivores to relieve canal pressure, including vein cutting and trenching. The technique used by the herbivore corresponds to the architecture of the canal system. Dussourd and Denno examined the behavior of 33 species of insect herbivores on 10 families of plants with canals and found that herbivores on plants with branching canal systems used vein cutting, while herbivores found on plants with net-like canal systems employed <b>trenching</b> to evade <b>plant</b> defenses.|$|R

The aqueous and organic liquid waste that remained {{at the end of}} this process was discharged to soil columns in waste cribs located near Z Plant. Included in this waste slurry along with CCl{sub 4 } were tributyl phosphate, dibutyl butyl phosphate, and lard oil. (Truex et al., 2001). In the mid 1980 's, CCl{sub 4 } was found in the unconfined aquifer below the 200 West Area and subsequent ground water monitoring indicated that the plume was widespread and that the concentrations were increasing. It has been estimated that approximately 750, 000 kg (826. 7 tons) of CCl{sub 4 } was discharged to the soil from 1955 to 1973. (Truex et al., 2001). With initial concentration readings of approximately 30, 000 parts per million by volume (ppmv) in one well field alone, soil vapor extraction began in 1992 in an effort to remove the CCl{sub 4 } from the soil.

This allowed Lee to repulse the breakthrough.Despite the setback with the Crater incident and a Congressional investigation that followed, Grant was able to lock in Lee and the Army of Northern Virginia at Petersburg. Grant's Union siege at Petersburg allowed the Union war effort on other fronts to finally bear fruit. Sherman took Atlanta on September 2, 1864 and began his March to the Sea in November. With victories at Atlanta and Mobile Bay, Lincoln was re-elected President and the war effort continued. On October 19, after three battles, Philip Sheridan and the Army of the Shenandoah defeated Early's army. Sheridan and Sherman followed Lincoln and Grant's strategy of total war by destroying the economic infrastructure of the Shenandoah Valley and a large swath of Georgia and the Carolinas. On December 16, Maj. Gen. George H. Thomas beat Confederate general John B. Hood at Nashville. Grant continued for months to stretch the Petersburg siege line westward to capture vital railroad lines that supplied Richmond, stretching Lee's defensive works thin.In March 1865, Grant invited Lincoln to visit his headquarters at City Point, Virginia. By coincidence, Sherman (then campaigning in North Carolina) happened to visit City Point at the same time. This allowed for the war's only three-way meeting of Lincoln, Grant, and Sherman, which was memorialized in G.P.A. Healy's famous painting The Peacemakers. Grant continued to apply months of relentless military pressure at Petersburg on the Army of Northern Virginia until Lee was forced to evacuate Richmond in April 1865. After a nine-day retreat, during which Grant expertly maneuvered his armies to block all paths of retreat, Lee surrendered his army at Appomattox Court House on April 9, 1865. Considered his greatest triumph, this was the third time a Confederate Army surrendered to Grant. There, Grant offered generous terms that did much to ease tensions between the armies and preserve some semblance of Southern pride, which was needed to reunite the warring sides. Within a few weeks, the American Civil War was over, though minor actions continued until Kirby Smith surrendered his forces in the Trans-Mississippi Department on June 2, 1865.|$|R

Nagytevel is a {{small village}} in West-Central Transdanubia close {{to the city of}} Pápa (Fig. 1). It is {{situated}} along the north-western fringes of the Bakony Mountains facing the Kisalföld (Little Hungarian Plain). To the south of the village centre we find the Tevel hill, a calcareous block mountain within the Northern Bakony. It is built up of Upper Senonian limestone with large siliceous nodules. This locality is the only source of flint in the strict sense within Hungary and probably also within the Carpathian Basin. This flint became known during the geological mapping of the area. Fortunately, the mapping geologist, Dániel Bihari had a good eye for archaeology. He collected some worked flakes from the W 3 sandy sediments around the outcrop. In course of the systematic field survey of prehistoric lithic raw materials in the early 1980 -ies by the Hungarian Geological Institute several surveys were made in the area, though at that time it was difficult to access because Tevel hill was a military ground for Russian troops. After 1989, the environs of Tevel hill became accessible. During the research of the exploitation areas in the Bakony Mountains we paid regular visits to the site. From 2000 onwards, the investigation of the Tevel quarry became more topical as we were excavating the Neolithic settlement at Kup, some 10 kms to the south of the flint outcrop where about half of the chipped stone artefacts were made of Tevel flint. Kup was known to have the most spectacular conical cores, made naturally of Tevel flint in Transdanubia. Results of the Kup excavations were published in a preliminary study as well as a local exhibition. The next step in the analysis of the quarry was a geodetic survey and analysis of archaeological distribution data followed by an analysis of the Bakony workshop districts. Excavations at Nagytevel. Tevel flint crops out in an abandoned village quarry (for limestone) on the north-western side of the Tevel hill facing the village (Fig. 2). As the former Russian military exercise ground was situated immediately over the modern quarry, it was not evident, in spite of the frequent occurrence of worked flint flakes in the sandy slopes that any traces of prehistoric mining were preserved. The intensive study of the area was started with a geophysical survey by Sándor Puszta and his team. The survey involved two rectangular areas yielding characteristic patterns of low and high magnetic signals (Figs 3 – 5). To get an overview of the situation as well as to interpret the geophysical survey results correctly, a 30 × 30 m large area was cleared and appearing features mapped, right over the modern quarry at area (excavation area “A”; Figs 6 – 7). By cleaning, intact bedrock, prehistoric mining debris and argillaceous sediment filling the pits could be observed. It was noted, that bedrock (limestone with more or less flint nodules) corresponds to low magnetic values (blue, under – 5 nT) and argillaceous fill gave the high values (orange and red, over 5 nT). We started to excavate in squares of 5 × 5 meters. Ten squares were started and excavated at least till the surface of the mining debris. We reached the bottom only in two squares. Altogether seven features were identified. The finds comprised large amount of flaked flint, some of them very large and flint nodules/precores rejected. There were occasional hammerstones and a few antler fragments in very bad state of preservation. We believe that we hit the most intensively exploited area of the mine at least among the existing evidence because it is certain that the modern (limestone) quarry destroyed {{a large part of the}} prehistoric mining field. Unfortunately we had to cover the cleaned surface by the end of the excavation, and could not finish all mining pits observed. Next year we sampled the area “B” with less frequent magnetic anomalies. We were planning exploring trenches on the exact spot (line) of positive anomalies and could transect six new mining features (Figs 8. 1, 9, 16). The mining pits at this spot were obviously more shallow and less complex. The method of exploring <b>trenches</b> and sections <b>planted</b> along observed features enabled us to excavate the features completely. In the 2006 pits, shards of the Lengyel culture were also found. In 2007, we returned to the “A” territory. To the south of the area explored we planted a new exploring trench in the length of 25 meters. Five new pits were observed (Fig. 8. 2). In the last year, a new geophysical survey was made. The area covered about 50, 000 square meters, incorporating part of former area “B” and new territories allowed by surface visibility and vegetation, to the south and south-east of the former rectangular square. The newly surveyed territories were not controlled by new excavations, the 2008 trenches and sections remained within the confines of the former geophysical survey, both on territory A and B, respectively. The new trenches (30 m and 15 m long, respectively) were planted almost adjacent to the 2006 – 2007 trenches on the line of observed positive anomalies. Six new features were observed. Two features in trench 2008 / 1 and 2008 / 2, respectively, were sampled for OSL (Figs 14, 18). Since 2007, the area is protected in the framework of “Natura 2000 ” project. Though there are obviously wide possibilities for further excavations, the work was stopped to evaluate existing finds and make strategic decisions about the site. Mining features and finds. The basic units for flint extraction at Nagytevel were simple pits. They were rather shallow at most of the observed parts (an average of 80 – 120 cm), deeper only towards the central parts of the quarry where the pits were deepened below 2 m. At the central parts of the quarry the mining features were more complex, too, involving longer trenches and ridges in between. No sign of shafts or more complex array was observed as yet. The bedrock, wherever it was preserved, started almost immediately under the surface (10 – 30 cms below present surface). Mining debris was deposited in most of the left-over pits. The miners utilised cracks and tectonic inhomogeneities of the rocks. In several cases, a monolith-like columnar object was observed across the pits or cuts which can be related to mining technique. Traces of fire is suspected as a means for facilitating extraction, documented by remains of greyish lilac ash and compact lime. The structure of the mine is best seen on the geophysical map: croissant-form blocks of bedrock were left among the pits and ridges, probably to support sediments and prevent slide on the steep slope. Most of the finds are naturally flint debris, partly worked. Some of the flakes are of very large size like the pieces found in Feature 2005 / 2 (Fig. 15). Many of the pieces can be refitted, though not all of the refittings can be considered intentional flaking. The mining tools are relatively scarcely represented; mainly hammerstones and very few and badly deteriorated antler pics, also recovered from the deepest part of the flint mine excavated so far, i. e. Feature 2005 / 2. Few but very important Late Neolithic shards were found in Features 2006 / 1 and 2007 / 1. Chipping floors were identified in some of the large features filled with argillaceous sediments over the barren debris. This is interpreted as a secondary use of the abandoned mining pits. Worked flakes are frequent in the sand and the surface surrounding the quarry area, though not in their original position. The most likely form of the Tevel quarry products was precore or core (blade core), but a lot more analysis is needed to specify the work-flow on the site. The minimal extent of the mining field, according to the geophysical survey, can be estimated at 10 hectares. The maximal extent can be estimated on the basis of the geological mapping data as 1 – 3 km 2 (Fig. 19), i. e. the distribution of the flint-bearing layers. Dating the mining features. The mining features are very difficult to date. The flaking is not really characteristic chronologically and we have very little dateable evidence. Prior to the excavations, the known distribution data and the evidence of the most significant settlement where Tevel flint was used and procured in large quantities (Kup-Egyes) indicated a peak in production, and, probably, exploitation during the Transdanubian LBC and the Lengyel cultures. The most evident proofs of prehistoric mining activity are the Neolithic shards found in some of the trenches and extraction pits. So far, only Late Neolithic shards were found probably belonging to the Lengyel Culture. In the last year of the excavations, samples were taken for OSL dating (Optically Stimulated Luminescence Dating). This method can measure the last time the sediments were irradiated by natural light. The underlying principles are similar to the better known TL dating. OSL is widely used now to date sandy layers and sediments. The results were presented on the conference of Mineralogy and Petrology, Budapest (Thamó-Bozsó–Biró 2009, Table 1). The dates obtained are consistent with the indirect evidence of flint distribution data and the scanty evidence of pottery found in the mining features. Distribution data. Tevel flint is an important regional raw material. It contributes to the chipped stone raw material stock of Transdanubia at least 5...|$|R
