5|$|After {{the work}} of John R. Carson in 1915 {{it became clear that}} {{multiplexed}} telephone transmissions could be greatly improved by the use of single sideband suppressed carrier (SSB) transmission. Compared to basic amplitude modulation (AM) SSB has the advantage of half the bandwidth and a fraction of the power (one sideband can have no more than 1/6 of the total power and would typically be a lot less). AM analysed in the frequency domain consists of a carrier and two sidebands. The carrier wave in AM represents the majority of the transmitted power but contains no information whatsoever. The two sidebands both contain identical information so only one is required, at least from an information <b>transmission</b> <b>point</b> of view. Up to this point filtering had been by simple tuned circuits. However, SSB required a flat response over the sideband of interest and maximum rejection of the other sideband with a very sharp transition between the two. As the idea was to put another (completely different) signal in the slot vacated by the unwanted sideband it was important that all traces of it were removed to prevent crosstalk. At the same time minimum distortion (i.e. flat response) is obviously desirable for the sideband being retained. This requirement led to a big research effort in the design of electric wave filters.|$|E

40|$|Veterinary {{nosocomial}} infections caused by antibiotic resistant bacteria cause increased morbidity, higher cost {{and length of}} treatment and increased zoonotic risk {{because of the difficulty}} in treating them. In this study, an individual-based model was developed to investigate the effects of movements of canine patients among ten areas (<b>transmission</b> <b>points)</b> within a veterinary teaching hospital, and the effects of these movements on transmission of antibiotic susceptible and resistant pathogens. The model simulates contamination of <b>transmission</b> <b>points,</b> healthcare workers, and patients as well as the effects of decontamination of <b>transmission</b> <b>points,</b> disinfection of healthcare workers, and antibiotic treatments of canine patients. The model was parameterized using data obtained from hospital records, information obtained by interviews with hospital staff, and the published literature. The model suggested that transmission resulting from contact with healthcare workers was common, and that certain <b>transmission</b> <b>points</b> (housing wards, diagnostics room, and the intensive care unit) presented higher risk for transmission than others (lobby and surgery). Sensitivity analyses using a range of parameter values demonstrated that the risk of acquisition of colonization by resistant pathogens decreased with shorter patient hospital stays (P, 0. 0001), more frequent decontamination of <b>transmission</b> <b>points</b> and disinfection of healthcare workers (P, 0. 0001) and better compliance of healthcare workers with hygiene practices (P, 0. 0001).

50|$|The first revival {{has been}} criticized, {{particularly}} by David Harker, {{as having a}} romanticized view of agricultural society, of ignoring urban and industrial forms of music such as work songs and those performed in music hall, and of bowdlerising the texts. The focus on collecting performed songs also disregarded the complex, but important, relationship between printed and oral forms, particularly the role of broadside ballads, which were sometimes records of existing songs and sometimes the origin or <b>transmission</b> <b>point</b> for others. Although collectors, from Grainger in 1905 onwards, experimented with new recording technology, it was generally rejected {{and there was a}} concentration on transcribing folk song in Britain, in contrast to America, where in a parallel movement John Avery Lomax made extensive recordings for the Library of Congress from 1933. This is thought to have created difficulties, since subtleties of performance have been lost and collectors often adjusted notation to fit their own, often classical, views of music or to fit their own preconceptions.|$|E

30|$|In Release 11, it {{has been}} agreed that the UE may receive {{multiple}} CSI-RS configurations corresponding to the points in the measurement set. One CSI-RS configuration corresponds typically to transmission from one point, {{but it is possible}} to configure two transmission points under one CSI-RS configuration transparently to a UE. For example, there can be two 2 Tx transmission points that can be configured to a UE as two separate transmission points or as one virtual 4 Tx <b>transmission</b> <b>point.</b> In addition, a term CSI-RS resource is defined as a CSI-RS configuration and an interference assumption, which provides a CQI assumption.|$|E

40|$|Terahertz (THz) band {{communication}} has abundant spectral {{resources to}} accommodate multiple broadband carriers. However, the strong path loss attenuation {{and the limited}} transmission power affect {{the maximum number of}} carriers that can be activated. A simple way to address this limitation consists in transmitting the same message from multiple <b>transmission</b> <b>points,</b> using Joint-Transmission (JT) Coordinated Multi-Point (CoMP). However, the distance-frequency-dependent molecular absorption that THz channels experience makes the implementation of JTCoMP challenging. In this paper, we propose a decentralized scheme that takes into account the effect of distance to select the per-carrier transmit beamforming weights and powers. For this purpose, low-rate feedback information is reported from the receiver to the <b>transmission</b> <b>points,</b> such that decisions performed locally take into account the ones made in the coordinated set. Notable sum data rate gains are observed when compared to the baseline schemes, where transmission power is equally divided among carriers or independently allocated using waterfilling. As expected, the accuracy of the reported channel phase information, the number active <b>transmission</b> <b>points,</b> and the distance-dependent frequency selectivity of the THz channel affect the sum data rate that multi-carrier JT-CoMP can provid...|$|R

30|$|A coordinated {{multipoint}} (CoMP) {{is recognized}} as an effective method to further improve the cell edge users’ performance. In Rel. 10 [8], downlink (DL) CoMP includes the possibility of coordination among different points or cells. If inter-eNB coordination is supported, information needs to be signaled among eNBs. There are various types of CoMP schemes: joint transmission (JT), dynamic point selection (DPS), and coordinated scheduling/beamforming (CS/CB). For JT and DPS, the data for an UE should be available at multiple transmission points, but at only one <b>transmission</b> <b>point</b> for CS/CB. In this paper, CS CoMP is considered for the coexistence of PS-LTE and LTE-R networks.|$|E

We consider cost functions of the form sum_j f(r_j), where f(r) =r^alpha is the cost of transmission to radius r. Special cases arise for alpha= 1 (sum of radii) and alpha= 2 (total area); power consumption models in wireless network design often use an exponent alpha> 2. Different scenarios arise according to possible restrictions on the transmission centers t_j, which may be constrained to belong to a given discrete set or to lie on a line, etc. We obtain several new results, including (a) exact and approximation algorithms for selecting <b>transmission</b> <b>points</b> t_j on a given line in order to cover demand points Y in the plane; (b) approximation algorithms (and an algebraic intractability result) for selecting an optimal line on which to place <b>transmission</b> <b>points</b> to cover Y; (c) a proof of NP-hardness for a discrete set of <b>transmission</b> <b>points</b> in the plane and any fixed alpha> 1; and (d) a polynomial-time approximation scheme for the problem of computing a minimum cost covering tour (MCCT), in which the total cost is a linear combination of the transmission cost for the set of disks and the length of a tour/path that connects the centers of the disks.
