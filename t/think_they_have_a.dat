2500|$|U.S. Rep. Adam Schiff, D-Pasadena, {{appealed to}} federal {{prosecutors}} to scrutinize the widespread political corruption in Los Angeles County. [...] At least six other cities where {{officials have been}} recently charged with corruption include Irwindale, La Puente, Monterey Park, Pico Rivera, Temple City, and Vernon. [...] "A much more rigorous focus is obviously merited by events", Schiff said, citing statutes that specifically aim at scams involving [...] taxpayer dollars. [...] "Some of these cases are difficult to prosecute (at the local level) and where the U.S. Attorney does very well is chasing it down." [...] Schiff {{said he would like}} to see federal prosecutors look closely at these several cities beside Bell. [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> compelling interest ...The federal government clearly has jurisdiction in public corruption investigations", Schiff said. There is now a deficit of several million dollars in the general fund. An audit by the Los Angeles County auditor-controller found that the city needs to significantly downsize its budget, including the possibility of disbanding the Bell Police Department and contracting with the L.A. County Sheriff's Department.|$|E

6000|$|The Moresco's Arabic Gospel and Breviary are {{mentioned}} in Lady Calcott's History of Spain, {{but she does}} not give her authority. Nor can I go further than Knight's Pictorial History for the King's adventure in the marsh. He does not say where it happened, but as in Stowe's map [...] "Dead Man's Hole" [...] appears in what is now Regent's Park, the marsh was probably deep enough in places for the adventure there. Brand's Popular Antiquities are the authority for the nutting in St. John's Wood on Holy Cross Day.

Horrid {{perversion}} of Scripture and of religion! To father the worst of crimes on the God of peace and love! Even the Jews, to whom that particular commission was directed, spared the Gibeonites on account of their faith once given. The faith of this government has been frequently given to those Indians, but that did not avail them with people who despise government.|$|E

I can imagine, that if you, as you are, Mr. Knightley, were to be transported and placed all at once in Mr. Frank Churchill's situation, you {{would be able to}} say and do just what you have been recommending for him; and it might have a very good effect. The Churchills might not have a word to say in return; but then, you would have no habits of early obedience and long observance to break through. To him who has, it might not be so easy to burst forth at once into perfect independence, and set all their claims on his gratitude and regard at nought. He may have as strong a sense of what would be right, as you can have, without being so equal, under particular circumstances, to act up to it." ...|$|E
6000|$|I don't mention Bristol as if {{that were}} the part furthest gone in this mortification. Far from it: I know that there is, rather, a little more life in us than in any other place. In Liverpool they are {{literally}} almost ruined by this American war; but they love it as they suffer from it. In short, from whatever I see, and from whatever quarter I hear, I am convinced that everything that is not absolute stagnation is evidently a party-spirit very adverse to our politics, and to the principles from whence they arise. There are manifest marks of the resurrection of the Tory party. They no longer criticize, as all disengaged people in the world will, on the acts of government; but they are silent under every evil, and hide and cover up every ministerial blander and misfortune, with the officious zeal of men who <b>think</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> party of their own to support in power. The Tories do universally think their power and consequence involved in the success of this American business. The clergy are astonishingly warm in it; and what the Tories are, when embodied and united with their natural head, the crown, and animated by their clergy, no man knows better than yourself. As to the Whigs, I think them far from extinct. They are, what they always were, (except by the able use of opportunities,) by far the weakest party in this country. They have not yet learned the application of their principles to the present state of things; and as to the Dissenters, the main effective part of the Whig strength, they are, to use a favorite expression of our American campaign style, [...] "not all in force." [...] They will do very little, and, as far as I can discern, are rather intimidated than provoked at the denunciations of the court in the Archbishop of York's sermon. I thought that sermon rather imprudent, when I first saw it; but it seems to have done its business.|$|E
6000|$|Notwithstanding his {{hatred of}} this cavern of brigands, {{and the little}} pains he took to conceal his {{feelings}} from any individual brigand, whether male or female, {{with whom he had}} to deal, he found out that [...] "it is not always so easy as people suppose to be poor and independent." [...] Merciless invasion of his time in every shape made his life weariness. Sometimes he had the courage to turn and rend the invader, as in the letter to a painter who sent him the same copy of verses three times, requiring immediate acknowledgment. [...] "It is not just," [...] at length wrote the exasperated Rousseau, [...] "that I should be tyrannised over for your pleasure; not that my time is precious, as you say; it is either passed in suffering or it is lost in idleness; but when I cannot employ it usefully for some one, I do not wish to be hindered from wasting it in my own fashion. A single minute thus usurped is what all the kings of the universe could not give me back, and it is to be my own master that I flee from the idle folk of towns,--people as thoroughly wearied as they are thoroughly wearisome,--who, because they do {{not know what to do}} with their own time, <b>think</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> right to waste that of others."[226] The more abruptly he treated visitors, persecuting dinner-givers, and all the tribe of the importunate, the more obstinate they were in possessing themselves of his time. In seizing the hours they were keeping his purse empty, as well as keeping up constant irritation in his soul. He appears to have earned forty sous for a morning's work, and to have counted this a fair fee, remarking modestly that he could not well subsist on less.[227] He had one chance of a pension, which he threw from him in a truly characteristic manner.|$|E
