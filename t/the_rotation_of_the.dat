5|$|Adding {{complexity}} to the model, such as rider movement, suspension movement, tire compliance, or frame flex, adds {{degrees of}} freedom. While the rear frame does pitch with leaning and steering, the pitch angle is completely {{constrained by the}} requirement for both wheels {{to remain on the}} ground, and so can be calculated geometrically from the other seven variables. If the location of the bike and <b>the</b> <b>rotation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> wheels are ignored, the first five degrees of freedom can also be ignored, and the bike can be described by just two variables: lean angle and steer angle.|$|E
5|$|Another area of {{interest}} for Rubin was the phenomenon of counter-rotation in galaxies. Her discovery that some gas and stars moved {{in the opposite direction}} to <b>the</b> <b>rotation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> rest of the galaxy challenged the prevailing theory that all of the material in a galaxy moved in the same direction, and provided the first evidence for galaxy mergers and the process by which galaxies initially formed.|$|E
40|$|In {{conventional}} frame methods, the lintel beams {{are assumed to}} be rigidly connected to the horizontal rigid arms such that <b>the</b> <b>rotations</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> beams at the joints are equal to those <b>of</b> <b>the</b> rigid arms. However, this would lead to incompatibility at the joints. It is found in this study that <b>the</b> <b>rotations</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> beams at the joints should instead be taken as <b>the</b> <b>rotations</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> wall axis.

40|$|This {{study shows}} that the common {{practice}} in existing frame methods <b>of</b> assuming <b>the</b> <b>rotations</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> coupling beams at beam-wall joints to be equal to <b>the</b> <b>rotations</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> horizontal rigid arms would lead to incompatibility between the beam and wall elements at their joints and eventually errors in <b>the</b> effective stiffness <b>of</b> <b>the</b> coupling beams. It is postulated that to resolve the problem, the rotational DOF at the beam-wall joints should be changed to <b>the</b> <b>rotations</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> vertical fibres there. This would, however, necessitate <b>the</b> use <b>of</b> frame elements with two rotational DOF at each end or solid wall elements with rotational DOF at each node to model the structure. Such required frame and solid wall elements are developed in this paper based on a Timoshenko beam element with two rotational DOF at each end. The resulting new frame method is much more accurate and versatile than the existing frame methods. © 1992. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
5|$|Early radio {{telescope}} interferometers used a single baseline for measurement. Later astronomical interferometers, {{such as the}} Very Large Array illustrated in Fig11, used arrays of telescopes arranged in a pattern on the ground. A limited number of baselines will result in insufficient coverage. This was alleviated by using <b>the</b> <b>rotation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Earth to rotate the array relative to the sky. Thus, a single baseline could measure information in multiple orientations by taking repeated measurements, a technique called Earth-rotation synthesis. Baselines thousands of kilometers long were achieved using very long baseline interferometry.|$|E
5|$|Gliese 581 is {{classified}} as a variable star of the BY Draconis type, and has been given the variable star designation HO Librae. This is a star that exhibits variability {{because of the presence}} of star spots combined with <b>the</b> <b>rotation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> star. However, the measured variability is close to the margin of error, and, if real, is most likely a long term variability. Its brightness is stable to 1%. Gliese 581 emits X-rays.|$|E
5|$|However, {{because the}} planet is {{rotating}} underneath the atmosphere, and frictional forces arise as the planetary surface drags some atmosphere with it, the air flow from center to periphery is not direct, but is twisted due to the Coriolis effect, or the merely apparent force that arise when the observer is in a rotating frame of reference. Viewed from above this twist in wind direction {{is in the same}} direction as <b>the</b> <b>rotation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> planet.|$|E

5|$|In 1955, Bernard Burke and Kenneth Franklin {{detected}} {{bursts of}} radio signals coming from Jupiter at 22.2MHz. The period of these bursts matched <b>the</b> <b>rotation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> planet, {{and they were}} also able to use this information to refine the rotation rate. Radio bursts from Jupiter were found to come in two forms: long bursts (or L-bursts) lasting up to several seconds, and short bursts (or S-bursts) that had a duration of less than a hundredth of a second.|$|E
5|$|In March 2007, it {{was found}} that the {{variation}} of radio emissions from the planet did not match Saturn's rotation rate. This variance may be caused by geyser activity on Saturn's moon Enceladus. The water vapor emitted into Saturn's orbit by this activity becomes charged and creates a drag upon Saturn's magnetic field, slowing its rotation slightly relative to <b>the</b> <b>rotation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> planet.|$|E
5|$|The {{source of}} the long {{secondary}} periods is unknown, but they certainly aren't due to radial pulsations. Interferometric observations of Betelgeuse have shown hotspots that {{are thought to be}} created by massive convection cells, a significant fraction of the diameter of the star and each emitting 5–10% of the total light of the star. One theory to explain long secondary periods is that they are caused by the evolution of such cells combined with <b>the</b> <b>rotation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> star. Other theories include close binary interactions, chromospheric magnetic activity influencing mass loss, or non-radial pulsations such as g-modes.|$|E

5|$|A {{different}} scenario {{occurs when}} the moon is either revolving around the primary faster than the primary rotates, or is revolving in the direction opposite the planet's rotation. In these cases, the tidal bulge lags behind the moon in its orbit. In the former case, the direction of angular momentum transfer is reversed, so <b>the</b> <b>rotation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> primary speeds up while the satellite's orbit shrinks. In the latter case, the angular momentum of the rotation and revolution have opposite signs, so transfer leads to decreases in the magnitude of each (that cancel each other out). In both cases, tidal deceleration causes the moon to spiral in towards the primary until it either is torn apart by tidal stresses, potentially creating a planetary ring system, or crashes into the planet's surface or atmosphere. Such a fate awaits the moons Phobos of Mars (within 30to50million years), Triton of Neptune (in 3.6 billion years), Metis and Adrastea of Jupiter, and at least 16 small satellites of Uranus and Neptune. Uranus's Desdemona may even collide with one of its neighboring moons.|$|E
5|$|A {{structure}} {{with the same}} name is often found in invertebrates, including molluscs and arthropods, connecting the oral cavity with the stomach. In terms of the digestive system of snails and slugs, the mouth opens into an esophagus, which connects to the stomach. Because of torsion, which is <b>the</b> <b>rotation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{main body of the}} animal during larval development, the esophagus usually passes around the stomach, and opens into its back, furthest from the mouth. In species that have undergone de-torsion, however, the esophagus may open into the anterior of the stomach, which is the reverse of the usual gastropod arrangement. There is an extensive rostrum {{at the front of the}} esophagus in all carnivorous snails and slugs. In the freshwater snail species Tarebia granifera, the brood pouch is above the esophagus.|$|E
5|$|As protons {{cross the}} {{membrane}} through the channel {{in the base}} of ATP synthase, the FO proton-driven motor rotates. Rotation might be caused by changes in the ionization of amino acids in the ring of c subunits causing electrostatic interactions that propel the ring of c subunits past the proton channel. This rotating ring in turn drives <b>the</b> <b>rotation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> central axle (the γ subunit stalk) within the α and β subunits. The α and β subunits are prevented from rotating themselves by the side-arm, which acts as a stator. This movement of the tip of the γ subunit within the ball of α and β subunits provides the energy for the active sites in the β subunits to undergo a cycle of movements that produces and then releases ATP.|$|E

5|$|As {{the signal}} {{passes through the}} satellite, it is {{translated}} by—added to—a signal generated by an oscillator in the satellite. Although the oscillator is housed in a temperature-controlled enclosure, it is subjected to thermal variation throughout the day that results in minor changes {{in the frequency of}} the translation signal. The thermal variation results from <b>the</b> <b>rotation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> satellite relative to the sun over a given 24-hour period, including the time the satellite passes through the Earth's shadow (which affected the 3:40 and 4:26 handshakes), and is complicated by the use of heaters that run when the oscillator temperature exits pre-determined limits. The variation in the translation frequency was calculated over several days, including the day of Flight 370's disappearance, and could be factored into the BFO measurement.|$|E
5|$|Because Jupiter {{is not a}} solid body, {{its upper}} {{atmosphere}} undergoes differential rotation. The rotation of Jupiter's polar atmosphere is about 5minutes longer {{than that of the}} equatorial atmosphere; three systems are used as frames of reference, particularly when graphing the motion of atmospheric features. System I applies from the latitudes 10°N to 10°S; its period is the planet's shortest, at 9h 50m 30.0s. System II applies at all latitudes north and south of these; its period is 9h 55m 40.6s. System III was first defined by radio astronomers, and corresponds to <b>the</b> <b>rotation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> planet's magnetosphere; its period is Jupiter's official rotation.|$|E
5|$|Due to <b>the</b> <b>rotation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Earth, {{tropical}} cyclones in the Northern Hemisphere tend to {{move from}} east to west. This causes tropical cyclones to approach the West Coast of the United States infrequently. Another inhibiting factor for a California landfall is the water temperatures. Because of the water currents, the waters off California are rarely above , which is too cold for hurricanes to sustain themselves. This tropical cyclone was rare enough that only three other eastern Pacific tropical cyclones brought tropical storm-force winds to the Continental United States during the twentieth century. The Long Beach Tropical Storm {{was the only one}} to make landfall; the other three hit Mexico before moving north.|$|E

5|$|In meteorology, {{winds are}} often {{referred}} to according to their strength, and the direction from which the wind is blowing. Short bursts of high speed wind are termed gusts. Strong winds of intermediate duration (around one minute) are termed squalls. Long-duration winds have various names associated with their average strength, such as , gale, storm, and hurricane. Wind occurs {{on a range of}} scales, from thunderstorm flows lasting tens of minutes, to local breezes generated by heating of land surfaces and lasting a few hours, to global winds resulting from the difference in absorption of solar energy between the climate zones on Earth. The two main causes of large-scale atmospheric circulation are the differential heating between the equator and the poles, and <b>the</b> <b>rotation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> planet (Coriolis effect). Within the tropics, thermal low circulations over terrain and high plateaus can drive monsoon circulations. In coastal areas the sea breeze/land breeze cycle can define local winds; in areas that have variable terrain, mountain and valley breezes can dominate local winds.|$|E
5|$|Owing to {{the present}} state of {{continental}} drift, the Northern Hemisphere is now fairly equally divided between land and sea (a ratio of about 2:3) but the South is overwhelmingly oceanic (1:4.7). Salinity in the open ocean is generally in a narrow band around 3.5% by mass, although this can vary in more landlocked waters, near the mouths of large rivers, or at great depths. About 85% of the solids in the open sea are sodium chloride. Deep-sea currents are produced by differences in salinity and temperature. Surface currents are formed by the friction of waves produced by the wind and by tides, the changes in local sea level produced by the gravity of the Moon and Sun. The direction of all of these is governed by surface and submarine land masses and by <b>the</b> <b>rotation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Earth (the Coriolis effect).|$|E
5|$|The {{evolution}} of moon systems {{is driven by}} tidal forces. A moon will raise a tidal bulge in the object it orbits (the primary) due to the differential gravitational force across diameter of the primary. If a moon is revolving {{in the same direction}} as the planet's rotation and the planet is rotating faster than the orbital period of the moon, the bulge will constantly be pulled ahead of the moon. In this situation, angular momentum is transferred from <b>the</b> <b>rotation</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> primary to the r{{evolution of}} the satellite. The moon gains energy and gradually spirals outward, while the primary rotates more slowly over time.|$|E
