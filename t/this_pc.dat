25|$|A 2009 {{study by}} Goldstein et al. {{shows that it}} is {{possible}} to predict full Ashkenazi Jewish ancestry with 100% sensitivity and 100% specificity, although it should be noted that the exact dividing line between a Jewish and non-Jewish cluster will vary across sample sets which in practice would reduce the accuracy of the prediction. While the full historical demographic explanations for this distinction remain to be resolved, it is clear that the genomes of individuals with full Ashkenazi Jewish ancestry carry an unambiguous signature of their Jewish heritage, and this seems more likely to be due to their specific Middle Eastern ancestry than to inbreeding. The authors note that there is almost perfect separation along PC 1, and, they note that most of the non-Jewish Europeans who are closest to the Jews on <b>this</b> <b>PC</b> are of Italian or Eastern Mediterranean origin.|$|E

The next year, Panzer Dragoon was ported on PC. Identical to the Saturn version except {{with a higher}} resolution, <b>this</b> <b>PC</b> port was also included as an unlockable bonus in the Xbox game Panzer Dragoon Orta, released in 2002. Aside from providing the source code, Team Andromeda had no involvement {{in the development of}} the PC version. The PlayStation 2 console saw the release of an updated version of the game in 2006 in Japan, as part of the Sega Ages 2500 collection. The port was handled by development studio Land Ho, and features both the original Saturn game and an [...] "arrange" [...] version with anti-aliasing filter, better texturing, and improved 3D models for the dragon and some enemies. The [...] "arrange" [...] version also includes new unlockable extras such as level selection and artworks, in the form of a [...] "Pandora's Box" [...] option menu (similar to Panzer Dragoon II Zwei).|$|E
2500|$|PC-552 was a Class 461 ship. Class 461 Patrol Craft {{were built}} mainly for the US Navy from 1941 to 1944. [...] This class was called Class 461 {{because the first}} one built was PC-461, which began the series. The first of the class to enter service was the PC-471. The class 461 was {{designed}} for rapid production in large numbers, to be effective anti-submarine vessels, and to relieve larger vessels from convoy duty. The U.S. Navy usually did not provide traditional names to PCs; the [...] of this ship was PC-552. <b>This</b> <b>PC</b> class was considered seaworthy but bounced around on the water like no other craft. The PCs were a match for the enemy submarines when the submarines were submerged but the PCs were clearly outgunned in a surface battle. In such a case, the PCs preferred tactic was to charge the submarine to ram it, before the submarine could bring its superior gun to bear. Class 461 Patrol Craft were designed to get most of their drinking water from an onboard distillation plant. Because of the violent pitching, the distillation plants of the PCs rarely worked. Consequently, the PCs were continuously plagued by a shortage of drinking water.|$|E
