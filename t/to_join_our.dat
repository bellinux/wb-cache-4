Speaking on {{the tour}} name, Shinoda said, [...] "'Carnivores' is a metaphor that is meant to convey an {{appetite}} for something visceral and substantive. I feel that's exactly the hunger this tour will feed." [...] Leto added, [...] "We are so excited <b>to</b> <b>join</b> <b>our</b> friends on this epic journey. It's {{going to be the}} adventure of a lifetime." [...] American rock band AFI was confirmed as the supporting act for the tour, promoting their ninth album Burials (2013).

We produced a custom board (in a light blue frame with shiny aluminium end cheeks!) for them that eventually went on <b>to</b> <b>join</b> <b>our</b> inventory as the Series 4." ...|$|E

2500|$|The first change {{occurred}} in late 1972 when Trinity's youth lobbied {{for a greater}} role in the church. [...] Under a dynamic new choir director the youth brought in, they led musical worship using gospel music (also see Urban contemporary gospel) for the first time, while incorporating dramatic visual props. [...] As Speller describes it, the youth choir [...] "ushered in a new day at Trinity Church, and through their music they ignited the flame that would burn off the dross of black shame to reveal the refined gem of self-love." [...] However, with call and response increasing and the Pilgrim Hymnal no longer in favor, some of Trinity's congregants left because of what Wright described as [...] "fear of changechange in the style of worship but, more importantly, change in the kind of members that would desire <b>to</b> <b>join</b> <b>our</b> church." ...|$|E
2500|$|On January 12, 2010, it was {{announced}} that Michelle had parted ways with Mathew Knowles (her manager) and Music World Entertainment. On February 8, 2010, Williams made a return to Broadway by commencing a seven-week limited engagement in Chicago at the Ambassador Theatre, replacing Ashlee Simpson. In April, producers Barry and Fran Weissler announced that Williams would extend her limited engagement in Chicago. Williams was scheduled to play her final performance on Sunday, March 28, 2010, but played an additional 18 performances through Tuesday, April 13, prior to joining the Los Angeles engagement of the Chicago national tour, Tuesday, April 20 through Sunday, May 9 at the Pantages Theatre. In commenting on Williams' engagements Barry Weissler said, [...] "Michelle {{has proven to be a}} tremendous asset to CHICAGO, first in London last year and now on Broadway. In addition to being a fantastic performer, she's as delightful and genuine offstage as she is onstage. We're thrilled that she's not only able to extend her Broadway run, but <b>to</b> <b>join</b> <b>our</b> national tour for its third return engagement in Los Angeles." ...|$|E
2500|$|After it was {{confirmed}} that Taylforth {{was returning to}} EastEnders, executive producer Dominic Treadwell-Collins teased about Gavin in May 2015 when he said of Kathy's return: [...] "It's a big, big story with lots of twists and turns. We know that there was a man named Gavin, who Kathy went off with to South Africa. So there's Gavin, Kathy—and lots of Phil [...] involved." [...] Then, on 17 June, Treadwell-Collins posted on Twitter a photo of part of a script, featuring Gavin, and the caption [...] "He's on his way...". The following day, 18 June, Paul Nicholas's casting in the role was announced, and it {{was confirmed}} that the character would play a major part in Kathy's return storyline. Nicholas said of his role: [...] "I am delighted to be joining the wonderful cast of EastEnders for {{what is going to be}} an exciting time ahead. I can't wait to get started and seeing what's in store for my character." [...] Executive producer Dominic Treadwell-Collins said: [...] "We are all thrilled that Paul has agreed <b>to</b> <b>join</b> <b>our</b> cast to play Gavin. So many British television viewers have grown up with Paul Nicholas so it's brilliant to have him back on our screens, playing a major part in Kathy's explosive return to the Square, while also holding the key to many more of the Square's secrets." [...] Nicholas later said it was [...] "great" [...] for him to join a [...] "brilliantly produced and very well acted" [...] show, but said it was [...] "quite daunting" [...] as he had not acted in a soap opera before. He said that when he joined the cast, he met the writers who explained the character to him and gave him a [...] "really good insight into where they wanted it to go" [...] and added, [...] "It is nice to be involved in something so successful and that people actually watch." [...] Two days after Nicholas's casting was announced, Nicholas and Taylforth were seen filming on location at King's Cross station, for Gavin's introduction scene that aired on 21 August 2015, and on 30 June, on-location photos emerged of Nicholas, Taylforth, Steve McFadden (Phil Mitchell) and Samantha Womack (Ronnie Mitchell), filming at an airfield in Essex, for Gavin's third episode, broadcast on 11 September 2015.|$|E
