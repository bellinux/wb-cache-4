5|$|Groening {{thought that}} it would be funny to have a baby {{character}} that did not talk and never grew up, but was scripted <b>to</b> <b>show</b> <b>any</b> emotions that the scene required. Maggie's comedic hallmarks include her tendency to stumble and land on her face while attempting to walk, and a penchant for sucking on her pacifier, the sound of which has become the equivalent of her catchphrase and was originally created by Groening during the Tracey Ullman period. In the early seasons of the show, Maggie would suck her pacifier over other characters' dialogue, but this was discontinued because the producers found it too distracting.|$|E
5|$|New {{construction}} almost halted {{when the}} Great Depression {{began in the}} 1930s. As a result, there are few buildings in the district in that era's architectural styles. The post office at Fourth and Broadway, built despite much public outcry over the demolition of its landmark 1894 predecessor, is the district's most notable building of the 1930s. Its stripped-down Classical Revival style shows the influence of Art Deco in its smooth, finished surfaces. The enameled metal facade on a Third Street storefront, dating to 1940, makes it the only building in the district <b>to</b> <b>show</b> <b>any</b> trace of the Streamline Moderne style.|$|E

5|$|Other {{atmospheric}} observations {{included a}} swirling dark oval of high atmospheric-haze, {{about the size}} of the Great Red Spot, near Jupiter's north pole. Infrared imagery revealed aspects of circulation near the poles, with bands of globe-encircling winds, and adjacent bands moving in opposite directions. The same announcement also discussed the nature of Jupiter's rings. Light scattering by particles in the rings showed the particles were irregularly shaped (rather than spherical) and likely originated as ejecta from micrometeorite impacts on Jupiter's moons, probably on Metis and Adrastea. On December 19, 2000, the Cassini spacecraft captured a very-low-resolution image of the moon Himalia, but it was too distant <b>to</b> <b>show</b> <b>any</b> surface details.|$|E
5|$|The {{coenzyme}} NAD is {{not itself}} currently {{used as a}} treatment for any disease. However, it is being studied for its potential use in the therapy of neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson disease.

5|$|The {{government}} censored {{news reports}} and withheld exact casualty figures during the protests.

5|$|Bacterial {{diseases}} {{carried by}} wolves include brucellosis, lyme disease, leptospirosis, tularemia, bovine tuberculosis, listeriosis, anthrax and foot and mouth disease. Wolves can catch Brucella suis from wild and domestic reindeer. While adult wolves tend not <b>to</b> <b>show</b> <b>any</b> clinical signs, it can severely weaken the pups of infected females. Although lyme disease can debilitate individual wolves, {{it does not}} appear to have any significant effect on wolf populations. Leptospirosis can be contracted through contact with infected prey or urine, and can cause fever, anorexia, vomiting, anemia, hematuria, icterus, and death. Wolves living near farms are more vulnerable to the disease than those living in the wilderness, probably because of prolonged contact with infected domestic animal waste. Wolves may catch tularemia from lagomorph prey, though its effect on wolves is unknown. Although bovine tuberculosis is not considered a major threat to wolves, it has been recorded to have once killed two wolf pups in Canada.|$|E
5|$|In 1993, Enron {{established}} {{a joint venture}} in energy investments with CalPERS, the California state pension fund, called the Joint Energy Development Investments (JEDI). In 1997, Skilling, serving as Chief Operating Officer (COO), asked CalPERS to join Enron in a separate investment. CalPERS {{was interested in the}} idea, but only if it could be terminated as a partner in JEDI. However, Enron did not want <b>to</b> <b>show</b> <b>any</b> debt from assuming CalPERS' stake in JEDI on its balance sheet. Chief Financial Officer (CFO) Fastow developed the special purpose entity Chewco Investments limited partnership (L.P.) which raised debt guaranteed by Enron and was used to acquire CalPERS's joint venture stake for $383 million. Because of Fastow's organization of Chewco, JEDI's losses were kept off of Enron's balance sheet.|$|E
5|$|In {{sentencing}} Lawrence, {{the judges}} {{found no evidence}} to support her claim that her life was threatened and although the prosecutors requested a lighter 20-year sentence due to her early cooperation with police, the judges sentenced her to life imprisonment. On the next day, the remaining three defendants, Chen, Nguyen and Norman, were sentenced to life imprisonment as well. On 24 January 2006, the prosecutors demanded the death penalty for Sukumaran, this being {{the first time that a}} demand of death was put forward for any of the Bali Nine. They told the Bali court that there was no reason <b>to</b> <b>show</b> <b>any</b> leniency to the 24-year-old, because he helped organize the heroin smuggling operation. The prosecutors also claim that it was Sukumaran who strapped heroin to the bodies of his fellow accused. Indonesian police identified Sukumaran as one of the main players, in what they said to be a major smuggling ring. On 26 January, it was also recommended that Andrew Chan receive the death penalty.|$|E

5|$|One of {{the most}} {{extensively}} studied cerebellar learning tasks is the eyeblink conditioning paradigm, in which a neutral conditioned stimulus (CS) such as a tone or a light is repeatedly paired with an unconditioned stimulus (US), such as an air puff, that elicits a blink response. After such repeated presentations of the CS and US, the CS will eventually elicit a blink before the US, a conditioned response or CR. Experiments showed that lesions localized either to a specific part of the interposed nucleus (one of the deep cerebellar nuclei) or to a few specific points in the cerebellar cortex would abolish learning of a conditionally timed blink response. If cerebellar outputs are pharmacologically inactivated while leaving the inputs and intracellular circuits intact, learning takes place even while the animal fails <b>to</b> <b>show</b> <b>any</b> response, whereas, if intracerebellar circuits are disrupted, no learning takes place—these facts taken together make a strong case that the learning, indeed, occurs inside the cerebellum.|$|E
5|$|Reviews {{on the use}} of {{vitamins}} and minerals have not found enough consistent evidence to recommend them.

5|$|In the men's tournament, Fiji secured {{their first}} Olympic medal with {{emphatic}} 43–7 win over Great Britain, as South Africa won bronze with big win over Japan. Having never previously won an Olympic medal of any colour, Fiji won gold at the Deodoro Stadium by demolishing Britain in the final. The opening minute saw Osea Kolinisau left one {{and one with}} Tom Mitchell and although his fellow captain halted his progress, Kolinisau {{was still able to}} stretch and touch the ball down behind his head. Almost straight away, Fiji had a second try. Samisoni Viriviri muscled his way past two players before offloading to Jerry Tuwai to score under the posts. After that Britain were shell shocked and Fiji were in no mood <b>to</b> <b>show</b> <b>any</b> compassion racking up a further five tries. A silver medal is still a considerable achievement for a team that was only formed ten weeks prior the tournament. Aside from the one-sided nature of the final, it still must rank among the most unexpected of British success stories at these Rio Games. Where other teams on the sevens circuit had been preparing two years or longer for the moment when rugby returned to the Olympic fold after a 92-year wait, Team Great Britain coach Amor only got his players {{together for the first time}} on May 30. England, Wales and Scotland all compete as separate nations in the World Sevens Series, where their results veered between the disappointing and disastrous, this season.|$|E

5|$|The appeal {{began on}} 29 February 2008 in the Victorian Court of Appeal. Nine Network lawyers {{argued that the}} network {{should be allowed to}} {{broadcast}} the first three episodes of the series, arguing Justice King had erred in her decision to suppress the series because she had viewed the unedited version, rather than the final edited cut that was to be shown to audiences. The network believed the first three episodes, which depicted events {{from the beginning of the}} underworld war in 1995, would have no potential to prejudice any part of the trial. Goussis's murder trial was due to begin on 31 March 2008. The judges overseeing the appeal retired to decide their verdict on 3 March 2008. Their decision on 26 March 2008 upheld Justice King's ruling that the series was not to be broadcast or distributed in or out of Victoria. During the appeal the Nine Network had proposed to screen the first three episodes immediately after any successful appeal, and would give the court seven days written notice of its intention <b>to</b> <b>show</b> <b>any</b> further episodes that it believed would not prejudice the murder trial. The Court of Appeal had dismissed the network's application to appeal, and the network was compelled to comply with the suppression order issued by Justice King until the offending trial was complete.|$|E
