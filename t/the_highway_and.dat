5|$|When {{the highway}} was first opened in 2009, the average daily weekday traffic volume north of Old Bunbury Road was 9,680. By April 2011, it had {{increased}} to 10,660 vehicles. In 2012 up to 14,000 vehicles per day used <b>the</b> <b>highway,</b> <b>and</b> 17,000 by 2014.|$|E
5|$|Every {{year the}} Washington State Department of Transportation (WSDOT) conducts {{a series of}} surveys on its {{highways}} {{in the state to}} measure traffic volume. This is expressed in terms of average annual daily traffic (AADT), which is a measure of traffic volume for any average day of the year. In 2009, WSDOT calculated that as few as 2,000cars traveled through the central part of <b>the</b> <b>highway,</b> <b>and</b> as many as 2,500cars at the interchange with SR22.|$|E

5|$|First {{designated}} by 1919, M-76 initially terminated at Roscommon. It was later extended north through Grayling and west to Kalkaska in the 1920s. A second, disconnected, segment {{was added to}} the highway in the 1930s. By the early 1940s, both the disconnected section and the Kalkaska–Grayling were added to M-72. M-76 was converted in stages into a freeway in the late 1960s and early 1970s. When the last segment was completed, the number was removed from <b>the</b> <b>highway,</b> <b>and</b> the freeway was added to I-75.|$|E
5|$|For {{the next}} several miles, NY33 runs {{parallel}} to the Thruway and very close to it, with both roads visible from the other. Much of this section of Lancaster has remained rural in character; however, that began {{to change in the}} mid-1990s when Tops Friendly Markets, the regional supermarket chain headquartered in nearby Williamsville, chose a site near the Gunnville Road intersection for a major distribution center. It necessitated the widening of <b>the</b> <b>highway</b> <b>and</b> construction of a traffic light and turn lanes at its entrance.|$|E

5|$|On- and off-ramps project northward from Eastern Avenue, each {{adding a}} lane to both carriageways. The {{expressway}} continues northward, with the Don River sandwiched between <b>the</b> <b>highway</b> <b>and</b> Bayview Avenue. The Parkway passes beneath Dundas and Gerrard Streets and rises onto the 'Don Flats' plateau at Riverdale Park. In this section, {{the elevation of}} the highway {{is close to the}} level of the river and is liable to flood after heavy rains, as occurred in June 2010, for example.|$|E
5|$|Service roads allowed {{engineers}} to separate local access from <b>the</b> <b>highway</b> <b>and</b> avoid space-consuming interchanges in many places. As such, interchanges were only opened at Bronte Road (then Highway25), Kerr Street, Royal Windsor Drive (then Highway122), Erin Mills Parkway, Mississauga Road, Hurontario Street (then Highway10), Cawthra Road, Dixie Road, and Highway27.|$|E

5|$|The {{portion of}} NY9N between Lake George village and Hague is {{relatively}} isolated, with mountains lining {{the western edge}} of <b>the</b> <b>highway</b> <b>and</b> the lakeshore located to the immediate east. Along this stretch, NY9N serves numerous lakeside hamlets, the southernmost of which is Diamond Point, a community just south of the Lake George–Bolton town line. The route continues on, passing through the hamlets of Bolton and Bolton Landing, the latter of which is home to The Sagamore, a resort situated on an island in Lake George.|$|E

5|$|The route {{has been}} mostly {{unchanged}} since its formation, {{except for the}} moniker of <b>the</b> <b>highway</b> <b>and</b> the western terminus, of which SR-103 progresses. The western terminus, in a stretch of fourteen years from its inception, went from SR-1 in 1965, to SR-106 in 1967 to SR-84 in 1969 and SR-126 in 1979. In 1979, the moniker of the roadway for SR-103 was changed from 600North to 650North. In 1998, the legal definition of SR-103 was changed in the state codes.|$|E
5|$|Then, SR 78 intersects with SR 115 east of Brawley, running {{concurrently}} {{with it for}} a brief distance. Shortly {{after passing}} through the small community of Glamis, the road turns northeast and eventually north towards Blythe, passing near the Chocolate Mountain Naval Reserve. As it nears the Colorado River and the Arizona border, SR78 briefly passes through Cibola National Wildlife Refuge before entering the community of Palo Verde, where the river turns away from <b>the</b> <b>highway</b> <b>and</b> SR78 enters Riverside County.|$|E
5|$|Efforts were {{underway}} in 1997 to secure {{federal funding for}} <b>the</b> <b>highway</b> <b>and</b> other infrastructure near the Mexican border, largely supported by Senator Barbara Boxer and Representative Bob Filner, and Representative Bud Schuster, {{the chairman of the}} House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, visited the region before giving informal approval to the proposal. In 1999, Governor Gray Davis approved allocating $27million in federal funding to complete the freeway. Concerns were expressed by local residents and municipal officials regarding the apparent priority of SR125 over SR905 in terms of funding, especially since SR125 was to be constructed as a toll road, and SR905 would compete with the toll road enterprise. In May 1998, Congress approved $54million in funding for the completion of SR905.|$|E
