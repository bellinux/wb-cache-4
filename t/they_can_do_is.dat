25|$|Isaac Anderson, The New York Times Book Review (January 7, 1940) — There {{is more of}} Archie Goodwin than of Nero Wolfe in this book, {{and that}} is all to the good, for, {{although}} Wolfe is Archie's boss and the one who does the heavy thinking, Archie is, unless our guess is wide of the mark, the person whom readers of the Nero Wolfe stories take to their hearts. If Nero is the brains of the concern, Archie is its arms and hands and legs. When Nero wants something done, he does not need to tell Archie how to do it. Archie will figure that out for himself, and the thing is as good as done, however difficult the assignment may be. In the murder case with which this story deals there are international complications which make things unusually difficult. The police and the G-men are in it too, but the best that <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> <b>is</b> to watch Nero Wolfe and wait for him to come through with the solution. The book is full of surprises for everybody concerned, including not only the reader but also the police, Archie and even Nero Wolfe himself. Read one chapter of this book and you will need no urging to go on with it.|$|E

But two days prior to the October 25 departure date, White House Chief of Staff Andrew Card informed Weldon that the administration was [...] "pulling all support." [...] Weldon then wrote a 4½-page letter to President George W. Bush that said that Bush's national security team was [...] "arrogant and disrespectful" [...] {{in the way it}} cancelled the trip. Weldon said he would continue his efforts to dialogue with North Korean officials whether the White House supports him or not. [...] "They can’t stop me from going there", he said.

One day in Japan, Meegan’s boy, Geoffrey, was in tears because the school was telling him [...] "how bad he was."

He imagined a world where all children could have their uniqueness, and what <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> <b>be</b> celebrated, rather than being judged and life blighted by what they cannot do. Democracy equals no more children made unhappy by school, ever. He wrote, [...] "This is what I fight for every single day of my life remaining." ...|$|R

I can see his straining efforts now, his eyes like {{the eyes of a}} spirit; I can hear his daily words: [...] "Il me semble que j'ai un peu plus de force dans mes jambes ce matin, Monsieur!" [...] though, I fear, he never had. Men of such indomitable initiative, though not rare, are but a fraction. The great majority have rather the happy-go-lucky soul. For them it is only too easy to postpone self-help till sheer necessity drives, or till some one in whom they believe inspires them. The work of re-equipping these with initiative, with a new interest in life, with work which <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>do,</b> <b>is</b> one of infinite difficulty and complexity. Nevertheless, it must be done.|$|E
60|$|There is {{of course}} more or less {{accuracy}} of knowledge and execution combined with this aim at effect, according to the industry and precision of eye possessed by the master, and more or less of beauty in the forms selected, according to his natural taste; but both the beauty and truth are sacrificed unhesitatingly where they interfere with the great effort at deception. Claude had, {{if it had been}} cultivated, a fine feeling for beauty of form, and is seldom ungraceful in his foliage; but his picture, when examined with reference to essential truth, is one mass of error from beginning to end. Cuyp, on the other hand, could paint close truth of everything, except ground and water, with decision and success, but he has no sense of beauty. Gaspar Poussin, more ignorant of truth than Claude, and almost as dead to beauty as Cuyp, has yet a perception of the feeling and moral truth of nature which often redeems the picture; but yet in all of them, everything that <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> <b>is</b> done for deception, and nothing for the sake or love of what they are painting.|$|E
6000|$|Instruction of the British farmer {{begins with}} the {{fortification}} of his will by confidence. When you ask him to plough up grass land, to revise the rotation of his crops, to grow wheat, to use new brands of corn, to plough with tractors, and to co-operate, you are asking a man deeply and deservedly cynical about your intentions and your knowledge. He has seen wheat fail all his life, he has seen grass succeed. Grass has saved him, {{and now he is}} asked to turn his back on it. Little wonder that he curses you for a meddling fool. [...] "Prove it!" [...] he says--and you cannot. You could if you had it in your power to show him that your guarantee of a fair price for wheat was [...] "good as the Bank." [...] Thus, the first item of instruction to the farmer consists in the definite alteration of public opinion towards the land by adoption of the sine quâ non that in future we will feed ourselves. The majority of our farmers do not think their interests are being served by the present revolution of farming. Patriotic fear for the country, and dread of D.O.R.A.--not quite the same thing--are driving them on. Besides, it is the townsmen of Britain, not the farmers, who are in danger of starvation, not merely now, but henceforth for evermore until we feed ourselves. If starvation really knocked at our doors, the only houses it would not enter would be the houses of those who grow food. The farmers in Germany are all right; they would be all right here. The townsmen of this country were entirely responsible for our present condition, and the very least <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> <b>is</b> to support their own salvation. But while with one corner of their mouths the towns are now shouting: [...] "Grow food! Feed us, please!" [...] with the other they are still inclined to add: [...] "You pampered industry!" [...] Alas! we cannot have it both ways.|$|E
