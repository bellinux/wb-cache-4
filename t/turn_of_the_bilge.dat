40|$|AbstractIn this paper, 2 D {{nonlinear}} {{viscous flow}} caused by rolling motion of submerged cylinder {{with and without}} bilge keels are simulated using the finite-volume method in order to investigate {{the relationship between the}} damping moment induced by <b>the</b> <b>bilge</b> keel and <b>the</b> width <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bilge</b> keel. <b>The</b> cylinder is submerged far away from the free surface to eliminate <b>the</b> interaction <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cylinder and the surface wave induced by <b>the</b> motion <b>of</b> it, and in this way, the damping moments obtained are caused by the cylinder and <b>the</b> <b>bilge</b> keels only. Verification and validation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> numerical results are performed in <b>the</b> conditions <b>of</b> different rolling periods and maximal rolling angles. Three parameters such as <b>the</b> width <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bilge</b> keel, <b>the</b> rolling period and the maximal rolling angle are taken into account, and <b>the</b> effect <b>of</b> <b>the</b> width <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bilge</b> keel is discussed. <b>The</b> analysis <b>of</b> <b>the</b> numerical result shows that there is a minimum effective width <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bilge</b> keel, so <b>the</b> further research is performed, in which a result that <b>the</b> damping moment <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cylinder with <b>the</b> given <b>bilge</b> keels is less than <b>the</b> one without <b>bilge</b> keels is discovered.

5000|$|A {{bilge keel}} {{is a long}} fin of metal, often in a [...] "V" [...] shape, welded {{along the length of}} the ship at the <b>turn</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bilge.</b> Bilge keels are {{employed}} in pairs (one for each side of the ship).

40|$|Bilge keels are {{effective}} passive devices in mitigating the rolling motion, and <b>the</b> usage <b>of</b> them covers {{almost all the}} sea going vessels. This paper focuses on <b>the</b> viscous effect <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bilge</b> keel, ignored <b>the</b> effect <b>of</b> <b>the</b> free surface and <b>the</b> effect <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ship hull, for the general viscous characteristic <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bilge</b> keel. In order to investigate <b>the</b> viscous effect <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bilge</b> keel on <b>the</b> total damping moment, a special 2 dimensional numerical model, which includes a submerged cylinder with and without bilge keels, is designed for <b>the</b> simulation <b>of</b> forced rolling. Three important factors such as bilge keels width, rolling periods, as well as maximal rolling angles are taken into account, and the viscous flow field around the cylinder is simulated by some codes based on the viscous method in different conditions, in which the three factors are coupled. Verification and validation based on the ITTC method are performed for <b>the</b> cylinder without <b>bilge</b> keels in <b>the</b> conditions <b>of</b> different rolling periods and maximal rolling angles. <b>The</b> primary calculation <b>of</b> damping moment induced by the cylinder with 0 mm, 4 mm, and 10 mm width bilge keels shows some interesting results, and a systematic analysis is conducted. <b>The</b> analysis <b>of</b> <b>the</b> damping moment components suggests there is phase difference between the damping moment induced by the cylinder and <b>the</b> <b>bilge</b> keels, and when <b>the</b> <b>bilge</b> keels width reaches a special size, the total damping moment is mitigated. <b>The</b> calculation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> damping moments induced by the cylinder with some larger bilge keels are also performed, and the results suggest that, the damping moment induced by <b>the</b> <b>bilge</b> keels is increased rapidly and becomes the dominant part in the total damping moment while <b>the</b> width <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bilge</b> keels are increased, but the damping moment induced by the cylinder is not changed significantly.

5000|$|The term bedar, (in Terengganu spelled [...] "bedor"), {{is applied}} {{to a wide variety}} of boats of the east coast of Malaysia that carry one or two Chinese junk sails and lack the typical transom stern of the perahu pinas.

50|$|The Sutton Hoo longship, {{sometimes}} referred to as the ghost ship of the Wulflings, is about 27 x 4.5 m maximum beam and built about 625 AD. It is associated with the Saxons. The ship was crushed by the weight of soil when buried but most details have been reconstructed. The ship was similar in hull section to the Nydam ship with flared topsides. Compared to later longships, the oak planks are wide—about 250 mm including laps, with less taper at bow and stern. Planks were 25 mm thick. The 26 heavy frames are spaced at 850 mm in the centre. Each frame tapers from the <b>turn</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bilge</b> to the inwale. This suggests that knees were used to brace the upper two or three topside planks but have rotted away. The hull had a distinctive leaf shape with the bow sections much narrower than the stern quarters. There were nine wide planks per side. The ship had a light keel plank but pronounced stem and stern deadwood. The reconstruction suggests the stern was much lower than the bow. It had a steering oar to starboard braced by an extra frame. The raised prow extended about 3.7 m above the keel and the hull was estimated to draw 750 mm when lightly laden. Between each futtock the planks were lapped in normal clinker style and fastened with six iron rivets per plank. There is no evidence of a mast, sail, or strengthening of the keel amidships but a half-sized replica, the Soe Wylfing, sailed very well with a modest sail area.|$|E

50|$|When {{designing}} a bilge keel {{there are important}} decisions to consider.

For such a usage <b>the</b> ends <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bilge</b> keel should be tapered and properly faired into the hull. Also, a bilge keel should not protrude from the hull so far that the device could be damaged when the vessel is alongside a pier, even with a few degrees of adverse heel. Bilge keels on commercial vessels should not protrude below the baseline either, {{where they could be}} damaged or fouled by grounding. Note that small bilge keels are often fitted to smaller fishing boats precisely to protect the hull on drying moorings and to help keep the vessel upright.|$|R

5000|$|The Viking shipbuilders had no written {{diagrams}} or standard written design plan. The shipbuilder {{pictured the}} longship before its construction, {{based on previous}} builds, and the ship was then built from the keel up. The keel and stems were made first. The shape of the stem was based on segments of circles of varying sizes. The keel was an inverted T shape to accept the garboard planks. In the longships the keel {{was made up of}} several sections spliced together and fastened with treenails. The next step was building the strakes [...] - [...] the lines of planks joined endwise from stern to stern. Nearly all longships were clinker (also known as lapstrake) built, meaning that each hull plank overlapped the next. Each plank was hewn from an oak tree so that the finished plank was about 25 mm thick and tapered along each edge to a thickness of about 20 mm. The planks were radially hewn so that the grain is approximately at right angles {{to the surface of the}} plank. This provides maximum strength, an even bend and an even rate of expansion and contraction in water. This is called in modern terms quartersawn timber, and has the least natural shrinkage of any cut section of wood. The plank above the <b>turn</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bilge,</b> the meginhufr, was about 37 mm thick on very long ships, but narrower to take the strain of the crossbeams. This was also the area subject to collisions. The planks overlapped by about 25 mm-30 mm and were joined by iron rivets. Each overlap was stuffed with wool or animal hair or sometimes hemp soaked in pine tar to ensure water tightness. At midlength, where the planks are straight, the rivets are about 170 mm apart, but they were closer together as the planks sweep up to the curved bow and stern. There is considerable twist and bend in the end planks. This was achieved by use of both thinner (by 50%) and narrower planks. In more sophisticated builds, forward planks were cut from natural curved trees called reaction wood. Planks were installed unseasoned or wet. Partly worked stems and sterns have been located in bogs. It has been suggested that they were stored there over winter to stop the wood from drying and cracking. The moisture in wet planks allowed the builder to force the planks into a more acute bend, if need be; once dry it would stay in the forced position. At the bow and the stern builders were able to create hollow sections, or compound bends, at the waterline, making the entry point very fine. In less sophisticated ships short and nearly straight planks were used at the bow and stern. Where long timber was not available or the ship was very long, the planks were butt-joined, although overlapping scarf joints fixed with nails were also used.|$|E

The upper strakes, those above <b>the</b> <b>bilge</b> strake, did not survive. However, evidence of caulking, found on <b>the</b> upper edges <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>bilge</b> strakes clearly suggests that the sides had been heightened by at least one or two strakes. This, in turn, led to estimates suggesting that <b>the</b> maximum height <b>of</b> <b>the</b> boat was about 0.80 to 0.90 m.|$|R
