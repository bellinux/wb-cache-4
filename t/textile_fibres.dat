25|$|The {{spinning}} mule spins <b>textile</b> <b>fibres</b> into yarn by an intermittent process. In {{the draw}} stroke, the roving is pulled through rollers and twisted; {{on the return}} it is wrapped onto the spindle. Its rival, the throstle frame or ring frame uses a continuous process, where the roving is drawn, twisted and wrapped in one action. The mule {{was the most common}} spinning machine from 1790 until about 1900 and was still used for fine yarns until the early 1980s. In 1890, a typical cotton mill would have over 60 mules, each with 1,320 spindles, which would operate four times a minute for 56 hours a week.|$|E

25|$|Most {{banknotes}} {{are made}} from cotton paper with a weight of 80 to 90grams per square meter. The cotton is sometimes mixed with linen, abaca, or other <b>textile</b> <b>fibres.</b> Generally, the paper used is different from ordinary paper: {{it is much more}} resilient, resists wear and tear (the average life of a banknote is two years), and also does not contain the usual agents that make ordinary paper glow slightly under ultraviolet light. Unlike most printing and writing paper, banknote paper is infused with polyvinyl alcohol or gelatin, instead of water, to give it extra strength. Early Chinese banknotes were printed on paper made of mulberry bark. Mitsumata (Edgeworthia chrysantha) and other fibers are used in Japanese banknote paper (a kind of Washi).|$|E
500|$|Some dyestuffs, such as indigo and lichens, {{will give}} good color when used alone; these dyes are called direct dyes or {{substantive}} dyes. The majority of plant dyes, however, also {{require the use}} of a mordant, a chemical used to [...] "fix" [...] the color in the <b>textile</b> <b>fibres.</b> [...] These dyes are called adjective dyes. [...] By using different mordants, dyers can often obtain a variety of colors and shades from the same dye. Fibres or cloth may be pretreated with mordants, or the mordant may be incorporated in the dyebath. [...] In traditional dyeing, the common mordants are vinegar, tannin from oak bark, sumac or oak galls, ammonia from stale urine, and wood-ash liquor or potash (potassium carbonate) made by leaching wood ashes and evaporating the solution.|$|E

50|$|Vat dyes are {{essentially}} {{insoluble in water}} and incapable of dyeing fibres directly. However, reduction in alkaline liquor produces the water-soluble alkali metal salt of the dye, which, in this leuco form, has an affinity for the <b>textile</b> <b>fibre.</b> Subsequent oxidation reforms the original insoluble dye. The color of denim is due to indigo, the original vat dye.|$|R

40|$|The modern <b>textile</b> <b>fibre</b> {{treatments}} aim {{to obtain}} the required level of beneficial effect while attempting to confine the modification to the fibre surface. Recently, much attention {{has been focused on}} different physical methods of fibre surface modification, cold plasma treatment being considered as very useful. Moreover, there are efficient chemical methods available, such as peroxide, biopolymer and enzyme treatment. Some interesting combinations of these physical and chemical surface modification methods as means to modify fibre surface topography and thus controlling the surface-related properties of the fibre are presented in this paper. The properties obtained are discussed {{on the basis of the}} physico-chemical changes in the surface layer of the fibre, being assessed by wettability and contact angle measurements, as well as by FTIR-ATR and XPS analysis. The SEM and AFM technique are used to assess the changes in the fibre surface topography and to correlate these changes to the effectiveness, uniformity and severity of the <b>textile</b> <b>fibre</b> surface modification treatments...|$|R

50|$|A huge {{benefit of}} using bamboo as the organic base for <b>textile</b> <b>fibres</b> {{is that there}} is no need for {{pesticides}} or fertilizers when growing bamboo. However, herbicide and fertilizer applications are common in some places to encourage edible shoot growth. Bamboo also contains a substance called bamboo-kun - an antimicrobial agent that gives the plant a natural resistance to pest and fungi infestation, though some pathogen problems do still exist in some bamboo plantations.|$|E
50|$|Bamboo {{textiles}} are cloth, yarn, {{and clothing}} {{made out of}} bamboo fibres. While historically used only for structural elements, such as bustles and the ribs of corsets, in recent years a range of technologies have been developed allowing bamboo fibre {{to be used in}} a wide range of textile and fashion applications. Modern clothing labeled bamboo is usually rayon. The bamboo yarn can also be blended with other <b>textile</b> <b>fibres</b> such as hemp or even spandex.|$|E
