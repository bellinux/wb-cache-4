25|$|Under the Solomonic dynasty, {{the chief}} provinces became Tigray (northern), {{what is now}} Amhara (central) and Shewa (southern). The seat of government, or rather of overlordship, had usually been in Amhara or Shewa, the ruler of which, calling himself nəgusä nägäst, exacted tribute, when he could, from the other provinces. The title of nəgusä nägäst was to a {{considerable}} extent based on their alleged direct descent from Solomon and the queen of Sheba; but it is needless <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>in</b> many, if not in most, cases their success was due more to the force of their arms than to the purity of their lineage. Under the early Solomonic dynasty Ethiopia engaged in military reforms and imperial expansion which left it dominating the Horn of Africa, especially {{under the rule of}} Amda Seyon I. There was also great artistic and literary advancement at this time, but also a decline in urbanisation as the Solomonic emperors didn't have any fixed capital, but rather moved around the empire in mobile camps.|$|E

African-American spirituality, as represented by Angelou's grandmother, has influenced all of Angelou's writings, {{in the activities of}} the church community she first experiences in Stamps, in the sermonizing, and in scripture. Hagen goes on <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>in</b> addition to being influenced by rich literary form, Angelou has also been influenced by oral traditions. In Caged Bird, Mrs. Flowers encourages her to listen carefully to [...] "Mother Wit", which Hagen defines as the collective wisdom of the African-American community as expressed in folklore and humor.|$|E
500|$|In August 2010, in {{response}} to notification that the UN tribunal would indict some Hezbollah members, Hassan Nasrallah said Israel {{was looking for a}} way to assassinate Hariri as early as 1993 in order to create political chaos that would force Syria to withdraw from Lebanon, and to perpetuate an anti-Syrian atmosphere [...] in the wake of the assassination. He went on <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>in</b> 1996 Hezbollah apprehended an agent working for Israel by the name of Ahmed Nasrallah – no relation to Hassan Nasrallah – who allegedly contacted Hariri's security detail and told them that he had solid proof that Hezbollah was planning to take his life. Hariri then contacted Hezbollah and advised them of the situation. Saad Hariri responded that the UN should investigate these claims.|$|E

500|$|In disclaiming U.S. culpability in January 2001, then-President Clinton told reporters, [...] "The {{evidence}} {{was not clear}} that there was responsibility for wrongdoing high enough {{in the chain of}} command in the Army <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that,</b> <b>in</b> effect, the government was responsible." [...] American lawyers for the No Gun Ri survivors rejected that rationale, saying that whether 7th Cavalry troops acted under formal orders or not, [...] "the massacre of civilian refugees, mainly the elderly, women and children, was in and of itself a clear violation of international law for which the United States is liable under the doctrine of command responsibility and must pay compensation". Writing to the Army inspector general's office in May 2001, the lawyers also pointed out that numerous orders were issued at the war front to shoot civilians, and said that the U.S. military's self-investigation – [...] "allowing enforcement to be subject to the unbridled discretion of the alleged perpetrator" [...] – was an ultimate violation of victims' rights.|$|E
500|$|According to the New Straits Times, Hickling {{later wrote}} in 1989, [...] "I {{could not imagine}} then that the time would come when the power of detention, {{carefully}} and deliberately interlocked with Article 149 of the Constitution, would be used against political opponents, welfare workers and others dedicated to nonviolent, peaceful activities." [...] However, he commented {{that it was not}} for him to say if the Internal Security Act should be scrapped. [...] "As a lawyer, I'm all for its review but on whether it should be scrapped, I don't know. You've got a multi-racial society [...] in which emotions can run high very quickly." [...] Interviewed on the Australian Broadcasting Corporation's radio programme PM in April 2001, Hickling agreed with the interviewer, Geoff Thompson, that he supported the law's continued existence and said he was [...] "sorry <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that,</b> <b>in</b> the light of my own experience, I'm inclined to think you couldn't really safely get rid of it at the moment". Worldwide terrorist attacks such as 9/11 confirmed his views on the matter.|$|E
500|$|In {{his book}} , author J. Randy Taraborrelli {{describes}} the song as a [...] "somber, sarcastic, all-the-world's-a-stage song about unrequited love... whose phoniness might have fooled everyone else, but not her." [...] He goes on <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>in</b> the song Madonna tells {{the subject of}} her unrequited love to take a bow for [...] "rendering a great, transparent performance in life and love." [...] Alongside the betrayal of her lover, the lyrics also talk about Madonna {{trying to understand the}} reasons behind adultery. As the song progresses, the listener realizes that through the lyrics the singer was talking about herself—"One lonely star and you don't know who you are". According to Musicnotes.com, the song has a moderate calypso feel and is set in the time signature of common time and progresses in 80 beats per minute. The composition is set in the key of A major with Madonna's vocal ranging from E3 to C5. [...] "Take a Bow" [...] contains a basic sequence of A–Bm7/E–A–Fmaj7 during the opening strings, and A–A/G–Fm7 during the verses as its chord progression.|$|E

500|$|Anthony Julius, a British {{lawyer who}} is one of Eliot's most trenchant critics on this issue, writes that [...] "A Song for Simeon" [...] is [...] "exceptional in a poetry in which {{elsewhere}} Jews are dumb. The voice, however is a disciplined one and speaks lines prepared for it... The song is for, not of Simeon. Eliot gives the Jew lines that locate him, and by implication all Jews, wholly within the Christian drama. Incapable of denying its truth, but equally incapable of living that truth." [...] He accuses Eliot of animating [...] "the topoi of the Jew acknowledging his obsolescence"—essentially employing a tired characterisation of a Jewish figure as a voice attesting that Jews have no role in the Christian future. [...] Julius compares Simeon to Moses stating that he is [...] "fated to see the Promised Land but not to enter it ... witness to its truth, but denied its redemptive power, the Jew stands solemnly, humbly, outside Christianity's gates". Further, Julius draws on a quote from Eliot's earlier poem [...] "Gerontion" [...] <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>in</b> this Christian future the Jews [...] "may find a ledge there to squat on".|$|E
500|$|Heydrich went on <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>in</b> {{the course}} of the [...] "practical {{execution}} of the final solution", Europe would be [...] "combed through from west to east" [...] but that Germany, Austria, and the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia would have priority [...] "due to the housing problem and additional social and political necessities". This was a reference to increasing pressure from the Gauleiters (regional Nazi Party leaders) in Germany for the Jews to be removed from their areas to allow accommodation for Germans made homeless by Allied bombing, as well as to make space for laborers being imported from occupied countries. The [...] "evacuated" [...] Jews, he said, would first be sent to [...] "transit ghettos" [...] in the General Government, from which they would be transported eastward. Heydrich said that to avoid legal and political difficulties, it was important to define who was a Jew for the purposes of [...] "evacuation". He outlined categories of people who would not be killed. Jews over 65 years old, and Jewish World War I veterans who had been severely wounded or who had won the Iron Cross, might be sent to Theresienstadt concentration camp instead of being killed. [...] "With this expedient solution," [...] he said, [...] "in one fell swoop many interventions will be prevented." ...|$|E
500|$|Montgomery {{went on to}} {{say that}} the video is full of [...] "temptation, love and lust," [...] and [...] "about {{distance}} and the effect it has on all those things." [...] He goes on <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>in</b> the video [...] "All Ush wants to do is make it back to her, to do all those things that husbands and wives tend to do. The only problem is he can't." [...] At the end of the video, Lenoir has enough, and walks out. Montgomery notes that it is not clear whether Usher even makes it home, or if the song was even referring to the wife character, and not [...] "someone special stashed in a nearby suite." [...] In resolving the video's review, Montgomery said, [...] "Distance may make the heart grow fonder, but there are limits to everything. Usher may want to be no place but home, but there's a big, wide world out there with pitfalls aplenty. He's a superstar, a businessman, a father and an (ex-) husband, but at the end of the day, Ush is also human, and [...] "Hey Daddy" [...] is proof of that." [...] In a review of the video, Rap-Up said that [...] "Even though it’s been a minute since his last video, the ladies man still knows how to bust a move." ...|$|E

500|$|During the revolution, {{there was}} an orgy of {{violence}} committed against the South Asian and Arab communities with thousands of women being raped by the Okello's followers, much looting and massacres of Arabs all over the island. The American diplomat Don Petterson described the killings of Arabs by the African majority {{as an act of}} genocide. Petterson wrote [...] "Genocide was not a term that in the vogue then, as it came to be later, but it is fair <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> <b>in</b> parts of Zanzibar, the killing of Arabs was genocide, pure and simple". Okello, an eccentric, power-crazed man with a taste for cruelty frequently went on the radio to urge his followers in thunderous Old Testament language to kill as many Arabs as possible, with the maximum of brutality. As a Pan-African nationalist who made his followers sing [...] "God Bless Africa" [...] whenever he marched through the streets, Okello appealed to the black majority, but at same time, as a militant Christian who claimed to hear the voice of God in his head, Okello's appeal on an island whose population was 95% Muslim was limited. It was only discontent with the Arabs that gave Okello any sort of mass support, and once the government was overthrown, most of the Muslim Africans gave their loyalty to the mainstream black politicians, and shunned the bloodthirsty Okello who presented himself as a messianic figure ordered by the voices in his head (which Okello said were messages from God) to liberate Africa for Jesus Christ. Okello claimed that Christ was an African and that Africa was God's special continent.|$|E
