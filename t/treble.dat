40|$|This thesis {{explores the}} pronominal and {{agreement}} marking {{systems of the}} Bislama and Raga languages. A feature characteristic of the Bislama language, which has been subject to {{a great deal of}} debate, is pronoun doubling and <b>trebling.</b> The debate has centred on what syntactic categories ought to be given to the pronominal elements in pronoun doubling and <b>trebling</b> constructions and it has been proposed that the preverbal "mi" is either the genuine subject pronoun or the agreement marker. Using questionnaire and conversational data obtained from speakers of Raga and Bislama, I argue that the preverbal "mi" in pronoun doubling and <b>trebling</b> constructions is becoming an agreement marker. Thus, we are seeing a regularisation of the Bislama agreement marking paradigm in which agreement markers are extending into 1 SG and 2 SG persons. While regularisation of the agreement marking paradigm and grammatical reanalysis have been argued to be features of creolisation, I demonstrate that although pronoun <b>trebling</b> may be associated with creolisation, it is not necessarily a feature that distinguishes speakers who occupy different points in the creole continuum...|$|R

Barcelona won the Primera División and UEFA Champions League soon after, completing a <b>treble</b> for the Frenchman, who had combined with Messi and Samuel Eto'o to score 100 goals between them that season. The trio was also the most prolific trio in Spanish league history, scoring 72 goals and surpassing the 66 goals of Real Madrid's Ferenc Puskás, Alfredo Di Stéfano and Luis del Sol of the 1960–61 season (this was later surpassed by Real Madrid trio Cristiano Ronaldo, Karim Benzema and Gonzalo Higuaín who scored 89 goals in 2011–12). Later in 2009, Henry helped Barcelona win an unprecedented sextuple, consisting of the aforementioned <b>treble,</b> the Supercopa de España, the UEFA Super Cup, and the FIFA Club World Cup.|$|E
