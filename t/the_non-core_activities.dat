40|$|The paper {{investigates the}} impact of {{different}} organizational models {{in the management of}} non-core processes. The analysis of literature empirical evidences has allowed to identify a total of 11 organizational models consequence of five different strategic approaches. The authors propose a comprehensive classification framework of the strategies and organizational models on the basis of two dimensions. The first one refers to organizational role of non-core processes manager (called facility manager), while the second one on the typology of non-core process/service provider. The framework allows to identify and to explain the main advantages and disadvantages of each strategy and to highlight how a company should coherently choose organizational model on the basis of (a) complexity of the non-core processes, (b) its inclination to outsourcing and (c) the desired level of autonomy in <b>the</b> <b>non-core</b> <b>activities</b> management...|$|E
40|$|We {{introduce}} a multi-attribute combinatorial auction-based mechanism, called contract clause mechanism (CCM), {{as a mean to}} innovate procurement design related to outsourcing of facility management activities. The CCM allows a procurer and sellers to dynamically and simultaneously bargain {{the characteristics of}} distinct procurement contracts. The procurer does not directly call for goods and/or services; in fact, firstly he involves sellers in defining a collection of contract clauses related to different features of the supply of goods/services; secondly he requests bids on such clauses. The procurer also assigns scores to clauses to signal their relevance to the sellers. Submitted offers concern bundles of sets of clauses and define detailed procurement contracts. CCM allows procurers to mitigate the relevant problem concerning the lack of competences on <b>the</b> <b>non-core</b> <b>activities,</b> since CCM can partially extract from sellers their private knowledge as well as information on the supply cos...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Under {{the great}} trend of social manufacturing, the {{professional}} social {{division of labour}} in manufacturing industry {{and the distribution of}} manufacturing resources force more and more enterprises focus on their core business than ever before and outsource most of <b>the</b> <b>non-core</b> manufacturing <b>activities</b> to other professional organizations. In this condition, this paper proposed a new-type cloud system which is call cloud machining community (CMC) to integrate the distributed MRs and provide on-demand services for service requestors who need them. The framework of CMC together with it working flow is proposed. At last, some key enabling technologies are talked about in detail, such as virtual access of machining resources (MRs) and machining demands (MDs), retrieval and matching between MRs and MDs, generation of machining groups and creditworthiness evaluation mechanism...|$|R

This paper presents industrial and service activity issues at CERN based on the experience of the exploitation of the power network. The most important problems linked to the application of the industrial approach to the exploitation of equipment in the CERN research environment are covered. These include the interface between accelerators and electrical exploitation services, external and internal regulations, sharing of responsibility between CERN staff and external contractors, continuous modification of clients' requirements, the balance between the cost of accelerator downtime versus the cost of infrastructure upgrade. A benchmarking through a comparison with a big industrial manufacturer is followed by recommendations for possible improvements...|$|R

These cost economies arise typically from sharing common inputs and spreading fixed costs over a larger output. Economies of scale in production are the most obvious motivation {{and are more likely}} to be achieved following horizontal integrations (Table  2). In a logistics context, horizontal integration increases the company’s productivity for core activities (e.g. optimising vehicle capacity utilization, reducing empty mileage, better usage of storage facilities, etc.); it reduces <b>the</b> costs of <b>non-core</b> <b>activities</b> (e.g. organizing safety trainings, joint fuel facilities, etc.); and it cuts purchasing, marketing and R&D costs (e.g. vehicles, onboard computers, fuel, etc.) [9, 34].|$|R
40|$|Business Process Outsourcing {{has become}} new mantra in the {{corporate}} business world. Modern as well as traditional organizations are now trimming down their employees from their payroll, and thus Human Resource Outsourcing (HRO) is slowly becoming the new buzzword. In order to utilize the true worth of the employees to its fullest, one must outsource <b>the</b> <b>non-core</b> <b>activities</b> of the orga-nization. The awareness of this has already been realised by the organizations. Outsourcing has no longer the privilege of only huge multinational organizations.

40|$|The {{organisation}} {{under discussion}} {{is a part}} of a Steel Company and consists of a group of captive underground coal mines required to produce coking coal, wash it in the coal washeries (benefitiation plants) and send the good quality clean coal to the steel plant for steel-making. The emergence of liberalisation in India has affected Indian industries and compelled them to think of ways to become more competitive. The very existence of this coking coal-mining division is at stake due to the availability of better quality imported coal at a cheaper price. Also, the demand for metallurgical-grade coking coal has reduced due to an improvement in coke-making technology, which does not require very high quality metallurgical-grade coking coal. In order to become competitive, the organisation has adopted the strategy of downsizing by technological upgradation and outsourcing <b>the</b> <b>non-core</b> <b>activities.</b> This paper uses System Dynamics Simulation methodology as a tool for structuring as well as evaluating the different alternative policies and scenarios for the future. manpower; strategy; liberalisation; system dynamics; policy. ...|$|E
40|$|Abstract- With growing {{diversity}} in business organisations, {{it has become}} mandatory to outsource <b>the</b> <b>non-core</b> <b>activities</b> and focus more on core functions, because only those organisations succeed which have core competency in conducting and managing their business. A major concern is to manage diversified human resources since, human resources are the most valuable resources for every organisation and optimal utilization of this resource helps to meet individual, organizational and societal objectives. This concern paved way for growth of agencies which specialize in providing right people for the right job, {{at the right time}} and in right number. Such agencies are called as Recruitment Process Outsourcing agencies, with whose help organisations get the right type of people to work in their organisation. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to communicate Human Resource Management needs to industries across the globe so that the organisations which are not aware get awareness about latest trends in recruitment outsourcing and avail benefit with its services. This paper will enable us to get answers to questions like, what it is, how it functions, is it useful, how companies are currently using it, what is the future scope of Recruitment agencies, how it is linked to both individual and organizational goals...|$|E
40|$|We {{introduce}} a multi-attribute auction-based mechanism with an endogenous scoring rule {{as a mean to}} innovate procurement design related to outsourcing of facility management (FM) activities {{in private and}} public sectors. The mechanism allows the procurer to request bids on several measurable technical and economic attributes of the supply of FM services, detailed in the procurement contract. The procurer also assigns weights to such features to signal their relevance to the sellers, while the score obtained with respect to any attribute is endogenously determined {{on the basis of the}} submitted offers. The proposed mechanism allows the procurer to mitigate the most relevant drawbacks due to the lack of skills and crucial information on <b>the</b> outsourced <b>non-core</b> <b>activities.</b> In fact, on one hand, it can extract from suppliers valuable private technical knowledge as well as information on the supply cost, and, on the other hand, it save the procurer from supporting the effort to specify ex ante both the exact required value for any technical feature of the supply, and the way a specific offer is scored...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT. As well known, Facility Management (FM) can {{constitute}} a significant opportunity for making more efficient {{the management of}} public firms, through <b>the</b> outsourcing of <b>non-core</b> <b>activities</b> like building services. Nevertheless there is an increasing awareness in management literature {{that the decision to}} outsource facilities services is a complex one with uncertain outcomes. In this paper we present a decision support tool for facilities managers in hospital enterprises. We started from a model presented in literature and validated him in healthcare sector. Then we built up to rationalise the decision making process. The relationships among the variables impacting the sourcing strategy choice have been introduced in the multi-criteria evaluation technique Analytic Hierarchy Process. Several scenarios have been hypothesised taking into account qualitative measures of the four variables considered, and the priority vectors by AHP have been calculated...|$|R
40|$|Increasingly, {{firms are}} allocating more {{resources}} to their core competencies and encouraging <b>the</b> outsourcing of <b>non-core</b> <b>activities,</b> which increases their reliance and dependence on suppliers.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to examine and analyse how the {{transformation}} taking place at the University of Dar es Salaam in the context of corporatisation addressed the challenges of access and equity as central features of national development. The study was based on the premise that widening access to and equity in higher education contributes to the development and prosperity of the nation in Tanzania. The study used a qualitative case study design. Epistemologically, the study was located within the constructivist paradigm which is premised on a social construction of reality. I used both purposive and snowball sampling techniques to select both the research site and the participants. Face-to-face, semi-structured interviews and an in-depth document analysis were used to collect the requisite data. The data were analysed qualitatively by developing themes using the Atlas. ti program. The findings revealed firstly that both internal and external factors had provided the impetus for the transformation of the university. The findings also indicated a strong move towards the privatisation of the university. This was evident in the outsourcing of <b>the</b> <b>non-core</b> <b>activities</b> of the university as well as the introduction of market-driven programmes. Secondly, the implementation of corporate strategies had both–positive and negative, planned and unplanned consequences. While the university had significantly increased its student intake, improved the efficient utilisation of its resources and diversified its sources of income, it had, nevertheless, been unable to match the increased student intake with improved teaching and learning resources as well as enhanced student support services. In addition, the influence of both donors and the organisational culture shaped and influenced the adoption and implementation of a corporate culture with regard to the management of the university. With respect to the role played by the university in national development, the adoption and implementation of the market approach was characterised by a paradigm shift from viewing the university as a social institution that serves the community to that of an institution that meets the demands of the market. Overall, the findings indicate that effective leadership, supported by a favourable policy environment, was a critical component in the realisation of the institutional transformation goals. The study suggests that a combination of both the state-controlled model and the market model in public higher education institutions should be encouraged and promoted for the purposes of equity, efficiency and effectiveness. Accordingly, this study suggests that the idea of „asymmetrical balance‟ is a strategic approach that will enable the university to mediate the contesting demands of both the national and the market imperatives. The notion of asymmetrical balance argues that the goals of national development and efficiency are not mutually exclusive and that they could potentially be mutually beneficial.

40|$|Outsourcing {{has been}} growing both {{domestically}} and internationally in recent years. Contemporary highly competitive business environment today acts as strong stimulus for firms to go outsourcing. In addition, economic globalization facilitates the process of looking for opportunities on the global market to outsource some of the firm’s activities instead of performing them on their own. However, there are challenges associated with the practice. Methodology used was questionnaires, interviews and observations to collect data for the research work. Interestingly, certain findings were discovered which include benefits and challenges faced by the bank in outsourcing some of their activities. Some of these challenges {{were known to be}} quality problems; inability to nurture-in-house talent, poor supplier selection, high cost, loss of managerial control, failure to conduct outsourcing exercise, lack of proper planning and understanding <b>the</b> core <b>activities</b> from <b>non-core</b> <b>activities.</b> <b>The</b> assessment and evaluation of the findings clearly identified that Prudential Bank Limited outsources its <b>non-core</b> <b>activities</b> and its benefit can be seen in obtaining improved performance, cost savings, access to world class capabilities, accelerated re-engineering benefits, shared risks, free resources for other purposes, improve quality of service and adequate time for management.

40|$|Outsourcing of <b>non-core</b> <b>activities</b> by firms is {{nowadays}} {{a common}} business strategy. This paper provides {{a theoretical framework}} for analyzing a firms’ incentive to follow such a strategy and its consequences for macroeconomic variables like growth and product variety. We divide production activities into core and <b>non-core</b> <b>activities.</b> <b>Non-core</b> <b>activities</b> can be performed within the firm or can be mediated by the market. We will derive conditions under which outsourcing will occur, and under which outsourcing will be socially desirable. These conditions do not necessarily coincide due to two externalities. Outsourcing may hence be a profitable strategy for firms, while it is socially suboptimal. Crucial parameters in the model are the relative scale of core versus <b>non-core</b> <b>activities,</b> traditional management costs, transaction costs and taste for variety of consumers. This paper suggests that declining transaction costs are a crucial factor in explaining the observed increase in outsourcing. ...|$|R
