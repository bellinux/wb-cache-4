5|$|Forster was {{not present}} in Mainz during the siege.

The application was accepted, but had no effect, since Mainz was conquered by Prussian and Austrian troops, and the old order was restored.

5|$|In 1957, the Russian {{flight of}} Sputnik 1 {{prompted}} the United States to accelerate its fledgling space program. On July 29, 1958, President Dwight D. Eisenhower signed the National Aeronautics and Space Act, which established NASA and subsumed NACA within this newly created organization. Langley Research Center {{became a part}} of NASA, as did Langley employees such as Kraft. Even before NASA began its official existence in October, Kraft was invited by Gilruth <b>to</b> <b>become</b> <b>a</b> <b>part</b> of a new group that was working on the problems of putting a man into orbit. Without much hesitation, he accepted the offer. When the Space Task Group was officially formed on November 5, Kraft became one of the original thirty-five engineers to be assigned to Project Mercury, America's man-in-space program.|$|E
5|$|La Masia is {{also the}} name of FC Barcelona's {{football}} training facilities, originally located near the Camp Nou in the Les Corts district of Barcelona. The original building itself was an ancient country residence (In Catalan: masia) built in 1702, and once Camp Nou was inaugurated in 1957, the building was remodelled and extended for use as the club's social headquarters. With the gradual expansion of the club, the building became too small for headquarters, and on 20 October 1979, La Masia was converted into a dormitory for young players from outside Barcelona. On 30 June 2011, the Masia building ceased housing the young sportsmen who are trained <b>to</b> <b>become</b> <b>a</b> <b>part</b> of the club’s professional teams. In a simple ceremony, the doors were closed and the Ciutat Esportiva Joan Gamper took over {{the function of the}} residential center for the youngsters.|$|E
5|$|Prior to the book's publication, Garland had {{approached}} the film's producers—Andrew Macdonald and Andrew Reich—about a possible film, {{and wrote a}} 96-page script.

Mulligan, a fan of the book, enthusiastically accepted the role, as it had long been a wish of hers {{to have the opportunity to}} play the part.

5|$|When the GWR {{was opened}} no trains in the United Kingdom were fitted with vacuum brakes, instead handbrakes were fitted to {{individual}} wagons and trains also conveyed brake vans where a guard had {{control of a}} screw-operated brake. The first goods wagons to be fitted with vacuum brakes were those that ran in passenger trains carrying perishable goods such as fish. Some ballast hoppers were given vacuum brakes in December 1903, and general goods wagons were constructed with them from 1904 onwards, although unfitted wagons (those without vacuum brakes) still formed {{the majority of the}} fleet in 1948 when the railway was nationalised <b>to</b> <b>become</b> <b>a</b> <b>part</b> of British Railways.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} {{technologies}} from the European Renaissance period were adopted by Russia rather early and subsequently perfected <b>to</b> <b>become</b> <b>a</b> <b>part</b> {{of a strong}} domestic tradition. Mostly these were military technologies, such as cannon casting adopted by at least the 15th century. The Tsar Cannon, which is the world's largest bombard by caliber, is a masterpiece of Russian cannon making. It was cast in 1586 by Andrey Chokhov and is notable for its rich, decorative relief. Another technology, that according to one hypothesis originally was brought from Europe by the Italians, resulted {{in the development of}} vodka, the national beverage of Russia. As early as 1386 Genoese ambassadors brought the first aqua vitae ("water of life") to Moscow and presented it to Grand Duke Dmitry Donskoy. The Genoese likely developed this beverage {{with the help of the}} alchemists of Provence, who used an Arab-invented distillation apparatus to convert grape must into alcohol. A Moscovite monk called Isidore used this technology to produce the first original Russian vodka c. 1430.|$|E
5|$|The {{entire length}} of US 130 follows {{a part of the}} Ocean Highway, a coastal highway that ran from New Brunswick south to Jacksonville, Florida. The current route was {{designated}} as portions of three state routes prior to 1927. In 1916, the road between the Camden area and Bordentown was legislated as part of pre-1927 Route 2 while the current US 130 north of Robbinsville was <b>to</b> <b>become</b> <b>a</b> <b>part</b> of pre-1927 Route 1. In addition, pre-1927 Route 17S was legislated to run from Penns Grove northeast to Westville in 1923; the only portion of road built ran from Pennsville south to Salem. When the U.S. Highway System was established in 1926, US 130 was designated to connect US 30 in Camden to US 1 in Trenton, following pre-1927 Route 2. In the 1927 renumbering a year later, the US 130 alignment was designated Route 25 from Camden to Bordentown, Route 39 from Bordentown to White Horse, and Route 37 from White Horse to Trenton.|$|E

5|$|After the Austro-Hungarian Empire {{collapsed}} in 1918, the Austrians {{wanted to turn}} the fleet over to the newly created State of Slovenes, Croats and Serbs (later <b>to</b> <b>become</b> <b>a</b> <b>part</b> of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia) {{in order to prevent}} the Italians from claiming the ships as spoils of war. However, the victorious Allies refused to acknowledge the conversations between the Austrians and the south Slavs and, in due course, reallocated the ships. The ship had been boarded by a scratch Yugoslav crew on 10 November 1918, one day before the Armistice, and had left Pola along with her sister ship, Radetzky. They were soon spotted by heavy Italian ships, so the two battleships hoisted American flags and sailed south along the Adriatic coast to Castelli Bay near Spalato (also known as Split). They appealed for American naval forces to meet them and accept their surrender, which a squadron of United States Navy (USN) submarine chasers in the area did. She had apparently been turned over to the fledgling south Slav state, as it was a Croat naval officer, Korvettenkapitän Marijan Polić, who presented the ship as a prize of war to representatives of the United States Navy on the afternoon of 22 November 1919 at Spalato (Split) in Dalmatia. Simultaneously she was commissioned as USS Zrínyi and Lieutenant E.E. Hazlett, USN, assumed command. The initial American complement consisted of four officers and 174 enlisted men—the latter entirely composed of United States Navy Reserve Force personnel. The ship remained at anchor at Spalato for nearly a year while the negotiations that would determine her ultimate fate dragged on. Only once did she apparently turn her engines over, and that occurred during a severe gale that struck Spalato on 9 February 1920.|$|E
5|$|The first {{portion of}} Port Republic Road <b>to</b> <b>become</b> <b>a</b> <b>part</b> {{of the state}} highway system was from Main Street (now SR 605) in Port Republic north to Pineville Road (now SR 672). That highway, SR 809, ran from Greenville through Waynesboro and Grottoes to SR 17 (now US 33) at Montevideo between Harrisonburg and Elkton by 1928. In 1930, the state highway was {{relocated}} to {{the east side of}} the South River from Grottoes to Port Republic along South River Road (now SR 825). SR 809 was not paved along Port Republic Road until 1932. As of 1932, the remainder of Port Republic Road followed highways maintained by the city of Harrisonburg and Rockingham County. These included county route (CR) 31 from Harrisonburg through the junction with CR 12 (now SR 276) near Cross Keys to Goods Mill Road (now SR 708), on which CR 31 continued. Port Republic Road continued along CR 214 to Battlefield Road (then CR 7, now SR 679). The road continued along CR 7 to the junction with SR 809. CR 31 was paved from Harrisonburg to about the modern city limits of Harrisonburg, and CR 7 was paved from SR 809 to the Battlefield Road split. By July 1933, after the passage of the Byrd Road Act that established Virginia's secondary highway system and transferred maintenance responsibility for local highways from the county to the state, all of Port Republic Road's route numbers changed. SR 807 became part of SR 340, which became SR 12 in 1936. After the East Side Highway, the modern route of US 340, was completed from Grottoes to Elkton in 1941, SR 12 was moved to the new highway by 1944; the old highway became SR 865.|$|E
