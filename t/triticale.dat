5|$|Some {{crop plants}} are hybrids from {{different}} genera (intergeneric hybrids), such as <b>Triticale,</b> × Triticosecale, a wheat–rye hybrid. Most modern and ancient wheat breeds are themselves hybrids; bread wheat, Triticum aestivum, is a hexaploid hybrid of three wild grasses. Several commercial fruits including loganberry (Rubus × loganobaccus) and grapefruit (Citrus × paradisi) are hybrids, as are garden herbs such as peppermint (Mentha × piperita), and trees {{such as the}} London plane (Platanus × acerifolia). Among many natural plant hybrids is Iris albicans, a sterile hybrid that spreads by rhizome division, and Oenothera lamarckiana, a flower that {{was the subject of}} important experiments by Hugo de Vries that produced an understanding of polyploidy.|$|E
5|$|The Enterprise {{is called}} to Deep Space Station K7 by a {{distress}} call. It is near Sherman's Planet, a world whose ownership is under dispute between the Federation and the Klingon Empire. On arrival, Captain James T. Kirk (William Shatner) becomes furious when he finds out {{the reason for the}} distress call, which was made by station manager Lurry (Whit Bissell) by the orders of Nilz Baris (William Schallert), the Undersecretary of Agriculture for the sector: Baris wants someone to guard the shipments of quadrotriticale (related to <b>triticale)</b> grain bound for Sherman's Planet, since quadrotriticale is the only Earth grain that would grow on Sherman's Planet and thus is required to resolve the ownership issue. Kirk assigns two crewmen to guard the grain, but afterwards learns that Starfleet Command share Baris' concerns. In addition, a Klingon ship commanded by Captain Koloth (William Campbell) arrives, who requests permission for his crew to board K7 for shore leave. Kirk agrees, but limits the number of Klingons at any one time and they must travel under Starfleet guard while on the station.|$|E
25|$|The {{induction}} of polyploidy is {{a common}} technique to overcome the sterility of a hybrid species during plant breeding. For example, <b>Triticale</b> is the hybrid of wheat (Triticum turgidum) and rye (Secale cereale). It combines sought-after characteristics of the parents, but the initial hybrids are sterile. After polyploidization, the hybrid becomes fertile and can thus be further propagated to become <b>triticale.</b>|$|E

It is the leading producer in Europe of potatoes and rye (world's second largest in 1989) the world's largest producer of <b>triticale,</b> {{and one of the}} more important producers of barley, oats, sugar beets, flax, and fruits. Poland is the European Union's fourth largest supplier of pork after Germany, Spain and France.|$|E
25|$|Respiratory allergies are an {{occupational}} disease that develop in food service workers. Previous studies detected 40 allergens from wheat; some cross-reacted with rye proteins and a few cross-reacted with grass pollens. A later study showed that baker's allergy extend over {{a broad range of}} cereal grasses (wheat, durum wheat, <b>triticale,</b> cereal rye, barley, rye grass, oats, canary grass, rice, maize, sorghum and Johnson grass) though the greatest similarities were seen between wheat and rye, and that these allergies show cross reactivity between seed proteins and pollen proteins, including a prominent crossreactivity between the common environment rye pollen and wheat gluten.|$|E
25|$|Because pairing between {{homoeologous}} chromosomes {{is rare in}} established allopolyploids, {{they may}} benefit from fixed heterozygosity of homoeologous alleles. In certain cases, such heterozygosity can have beneficial heterotic effects, either in terms of fitness in natural contexts or desirable traits in agricultural contexts. This could partially explain the prevalence of allopolyploidy among crop species. Both bread wheat and <b>Triticale</b> are examples of an allopolyploids with six chromosome sets. Cotton is an allotetraploid with multiple origins. In Brassicaceous crops, the Triangle of U describes {{the relationships between the}} three common diploid Brassicas (B. oleracea, B. rapa, and B. nigra) and three allotetraploids (B. napus, B. juncea, and B. carinata) derived from hybridization among the diploid species. A similar relationship exists between three diploid species of Tragopogon (T. dubius, T. pratensis, and T. porrifolius) and two allotetraploid species (T. mirus and T. miscellus). Complex patterns of allopolyploid evolution have also been observed in animals, as in the frog genus Xenopus.|$|E

2500|$|Barley is more {{tolerant}} of soil salinity than wheat, which might explain the increase of barley cultivation in Mesopotamia from the second millennium BCE onwards. Barley is not as cold tolerant as the winter wheats (Triticum aestivum), fall rye (Secale cereale) or winter <b>triticale</b> (× Triticosecale Wittm. ex A. Camus.), but may be sown as a winter crop in warmer areas of [...] Australia and Great Britain.|$|E
50|$|The <b>triticale</b> hybrids are all amphidiploid, {{which means}} the plant is diploid for two genomes derived from {{different}} species. In other words, <b>triticale</b> is an allotetraploid. In earlier years, most work was done on octoploid <b>triticale.</b> Different ploidy levels have been created and evaluated over time. The tetraploids showed little promise, but hexaploid <b>triticale</b> was successful enough to find commercial application.|$|E

50|$|Colchicine's {{ability to}} induce {{polyploidy}} can be also exploited to render infertile hybrids fertile, {{for example in}} breeding <b>triticale</b> (× Triticosecale) from wheat (Triticum spp.) and rye (Secale cereale).

50|$|Since the {{induction}} of the CIMMYT <b>triticale</b> breeding programme in 1964, {{the improvement in}} realised grain yield has been remarkable. In 1968, at Ciudad Obregón, Sonora, in northwest Mexico, the highest yielding <b>triticale</b> line produced 2.4 t/ha. Today, CIMMYT has released high yielding spring <b>triticale</b> lines (e.g. Pollmer-2) which have surpassed the 10 t/ha yield barrier under optimum production conditions.|$|E
50|$|The International Maize and Wheat Improvement Center <b>triticale</b> {{improvement}} program {{was intended to}} improve food production and nutrition in developing countries. <b>Triticale</b> was thought to have potential {{in the production of}} bread and other food products, such as cookies, pasta, pizza dough and breakfast cereals. The protein content is higher than that of wheat, although the glutenin fraction is less. The grain has also been stated to have higher levels of lysine than wheat. Acceptance would require the milling industry to adapt to <b>triticale,</b> as the milling techniques employed for wheat are unsuited to <b>triticale.</b> Sell et al. found <b>triticale</b> {{could be used as a}} feed grain, and later research found its starch was particularly readily digested. As a feed grain, <b>triticale</b> is already well established and of high economic importance. It has received attention as a potential energy crop, and research is currently being conducted on the use of the crops biomass in bioethanol production.|$|E
50|$|Tissue culture {{techniques}} {{with respect}} to wheat and <b>triticale</b> have seen continuous improvements, but the isolation and culturing of individual microspores seems to hold the most promise. Many molecular markers {{can be applied to}} marker-assisted gene transfer, but the expression of R-genes in the new genetic background of <b>triticale</b> remains to be investigated. More than 750 wheat microsatellite primer pairs are available in public wheat breeding programmes, and could be exploited in the development of SSRs in <b>triticale.</b> Another type of molecular marker, single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), is likely to {{have a significant impact on}} the future of <b>triticale</b> breeding.|$|E
50|$|Abundant {{information}} exists concerning {{disease resistance}} (R) genes for wheat, and a continuously updated on-line catalogue, the Catalogue of Gene Symbols, of these genes {{can be found}} at http://wheat.pw.usda.gov/ggpages/wgc/98/. Another on-line database of cereal rust resistance genes is available at http://www.cdl.umn.edu/res_gene/res_gene.html. Unfortunately, less is known about rye and particularly <b>triticale</b> R-genes. Many R-genes have been transferred to wheat from its wild relatives, and appear in the catalogue, thus making them available for <b>triticale</b> breeding. The two mentioned databases are significant contributors to improving the genetic variability of the <b>triticale</b> gene pool through gene (or more specifically, allele) provision. Genetic variability is essential for progress in breeding. In addition, genetic variability can also be achieved by producing new primary triticales, which essentially means the reconstitution of <b>triticale,</b> and the development of various hybrids involving <b>triticale,</b> such as triticale-rye hybrids. In this way, some chromosomes from the R genome have been replaced by some from the D genome. The resulting so-called substitution and translocation <b>triticale</b> facilitates the transfer of R-genes.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Triticale</b> (× Triticosecale), [...] is {{a hybrid}} of wheat (Triticum) and rye (Secale) first bred in {{laboratories}} during the late 19th century in Scotland and Germany. Commercially available <b>triticale</b> is almost always a second-generation hybrid, i.e., a cross between two kinds of primary (first-cross) triticales. As a rule, <b>triticale</b> combines the yield potential and grain quality of wheat with the disease and environmental tolerance (including soil conditions) of rye. Only recently has it been developed into a commercially viable crop. Depending on the cultivar, <b>triticale</b> {{can more or less}} resemble either of its parents. It is grown mostly for forage or fodder, although some triticale-based foods can be purchased at health food stores and can be found in some breakfast cereals.|$|E

50|$|Based on the {{commercial}} success of other hybrid crops, {{the use of}} hybrid triticales as a strategy for enhancing yield in favourable, as well as marginal, environments has proven successful over time. Earlier research conducted by CIMMYT made use of a chemical hybridising agent to evaluate heterosis in hexaploid <b>triticale</b> hybrids. To select the most promising parents for hybrid production, test crosses conducted in various environments are required, because the variance of their specific combining ability under differing environmental conditions {{is the most important}} component in evaluating their potential as parents to produce promising hybrids. The prediction of general combining ability of any <b>triticale</b> plant from the performance of its parents is only moderate with respect to grain yield. Commercially exploitable yield advantages of hybrid <b>triticale</b> cultivars is dependent on improving parent heterosis and on advances in inbred-line development.|$|E
50|$|This area of {{agronomy}} involves {{selective breeding}} of plants {{to produce the}} best crops under various conditions. Plant breeding has increased crop yields and has improved the nutritional value of numerous crops, including corn, soybeans, and wheat. It has also {{led to the development}} of new types of plants. For example, a hybrid grain called <b>triticale</b> was produced by crossbreeding rye and wheat. <b>Triticale</b> contains more usable protein than does either rye or wheat. Agronomy has also been instrumental in fruit and vegetable production research.|$|E

50|$|The genetic {{transformation}} of crops involves {{the incorporation of}} 'foreign' genes or rather, very small DNA fragments compared to introgression discussed earlier. Amongst other uses, transformation is a useful tool to introduce new traits or characteristics into the transformed crop. Two methods are commonly employed: infectious bacterial-mediated (usually Agrobacterium) and biolistics, with the latter being most commonly applied to allopolyploid cereals such as <b>triticale.</b> Agrobacterium-mediated transformation, however, holds several advantages, such as {{a low level of}} transgenic DNA rearrangement, a low number of introduced copies of the transforming DNA, stable integration of an a-priori characterized T-DNA fragment (containing the DNA expressing the trait of interest) and an expected higher level of transgene expression. <b>Triticale</b> has, until recently, only been transformed via biolistics, with a 3.3% success rate (Zimny et al. 1995). Little has been documented on Agrobacterium-mediated transformation of wheat; while no data existed with respect to <b>triticale</b> until 2005, the success rate in later work was nevertheless low.|$|E
