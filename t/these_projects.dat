5|$|The {{architectural}} {{designs of}} <b>these</b> <b>projects</b> have reflected {{not only the}} style currents of their time, but the societal debate over the purpose they were intended to serve. Nationalistic ambitions early on gave way to austere designs based on functionalism, and then to designs that emphasized human and ecological needs. To a great extent, Norwegian architects have found {{the opportunity to develop}} their signature styles through <b>these</b> <b>projects,</b> and thereby also a Norwegian architectural dialect.|$|E
5|$|The {{problems}} {{encountered by}} <b>these</b> <b>projects</b> have been credited to factors including overly optimistic estimates of their value; declines throughout the global economy, particularly the U.S. crash in home prices; and decreased appeal of Woods following his 2009 infidelity scandal.|$|E

5|$|During the 1960s and 1970s, the building's {{exterior}} {{became increasingly}} dilapidated; among those {{concerned about the}} church's deterioration was Russian bard Vladimir Vysotsky, {{who lived in a}} house across the street. In the late 1970s the city considered renovating the building, possibly to use as a concert hall for organ recitals, or as a general cultural administration centre. <b>These</b> <b>projects</b> were never carried out due to resistance from the research institute.|$|E
5|$|Florida State University {{has seen}} {{considerable}} expansion and construction since T. K. Wetherell {{came into office}} in 2003. Numerous renovations {{as well as new}} constructions have been completed or {{are in the process of}} completion. <b>These</b> <b>projects</b> include student athletic fields, dormitories, new classroom space as well as research space. Currently the campus is undergoing a revival and beautification of the campus' main spaces.|$|E
5|$|In 1953, the World Health Organization (WHO) {{launched}} an antimalarial program {{in parts of}} Liberia as a pilot project to determine the feasibility of malaria eradication in tropical Africa.

5|$|In recent years, many {{traditional}} houses are being reconstructed and owners lured to come back, thus revitalizing tourism {{as a potential}} revenue source for the local economy. However, some houses continue to degrade from lack of investment, abandonment or inappropriate renovations as local craftsmen {{are not part of}} <b>these</b> <b>projects.</b>|$|E
5|$|In the 1980s and 1990s, {{silicon carbide}} was studied in several {{research}} programs for high-temperature gas turbines in Europe, Japan and the United States. The components {{were intended to}} replace nickel superalloy turbine blades or nozzle vanes. However, none of <b>these</b> <b>projects</b> resulted in a production quantity, mainly because of its low impact resistance and its low fracture toughness.|$|E

5|$|Matthias {{started at}} least two major {{building}} projects. The works in Buda and Visegrád began in about 1479. Two new wings and a hanging garden were built at the royal castle of Buda, and the palace at Visegrád was rebuilt in Renaissance style. Matthias appointed the Italian Chimenti Camicia and the Dalmatian Giovanni Dalmata to direct <b>these</b> <b>projects.</b>|$|E
5|$|Most of <b>these</b> <b>projects</b> {{were focused}} in Brussels, where he {{constructed}} two large palaces, and Ostende, where a vast colonnaded arcade was built along the seafront {{in an attempt}} to turn the town into a fashionable seaside resort. During Leopold's reign, Belgium hosted five prestigious World Exhibitions, in 1885, 1888, 1894, 1897 and 1905, as well as a major national exhibition in 1880 to mark the 50th anniversary of Belgian independence.|$|E
5|$|The Rüstungsstab assumed {{responsibilities}} for the underground transfer projects of the Jägerstab. In November 1944, 1.8 million square meters of underground space {{were ready for}} occupancy, encompassing over 1,000 spaces commissioned by the task force. (Post-war, Speer sought to downplay his involvement with <b>these</b> <b>projects</b> and claimed that only 300,000 square meters had been completed). According Buggeln, the Rüstungsstab {{played a key role}} in maintaining and increasing production of fighter aircraft and V-2 rockets.|$|E
50|$|Demos' text {{analyses}} the artist’s installations {{and conceptual}} mixed-media pieces - {{such as his}} La Boîte-en-valise, which Duchamp called his “portable museum.” The book places <b>these</b> <b>project</b> {{in relation to the}} aesthetic and geopolitical dislocations of early twentieth-century nationalisms and world war.|$|R
25|$|The transepts {{each have}} a {{semi-circular}} entrance portico. Wren was inspired in the design by studying engravings of Pietro da Cortona's Baroque facade of Santa Maria della Pace in Rome. <b>These</b> <b>projecting</b> arcs echo {{the shape of the}} apse at the eastern end of the building.|$|R
50|$|There is {{a network}} of {{libraries}} with three national libraries, 689 public libraries, 143 higher education libraries and 11 non-specialised libraries as at 1998.

5|$|The {{prospect}} of developing such large tourist accommodations has encountered concerns from both APSARA and the ICC, claiming that previous tourism {{developments in the}} area have neglected construction regulations and more of <b>these</b> <b>projects</b> {{have the potential to}} damage landscape features. Also, the large scale of <b>these</b> <b>projects</b> have begun to threaten the quality of the nearby town's water, sewage, and electricity systems. It has been noted that such high frequency of tourism and growing demand for quality accommodations in the area, such as the development of a large highway, has had a direct effect on the underground water table, subsequently straining the structural stability of the temples at Angkor Wat. Locals of Siem Reap have also voiced concern that the charm and atmosphere of their town have been compromised in order to entertain tourism. Since this local atmosphere is the key component to projects like Angkor Tourist City, the local officials continue to discuss how to successfully incorporate future tourism without sacrificing local values and culture.|$|E

5|$|Under {{the rule}} of Isma'il Pasha, the {{grandson}} of Muhammad Ali, major public works projects were initiated {{with the aim of}} transforming Cairo into a European styled city. <b>These</b> <b>projects,</b> at first funded by a boom in the cotton industry, eventually racked up a massive debt which was held by the British, providing an excuse for the British to occupy Egypt in 1882 after having pushed out Isma'il Pasha in 1879.|$|E

5|$|A {{number of}} filmmakers have {{proposed}} films based on Cassidy's life, and {{have worked with}} her family to greater or lesser degrees, but to date <b>these</b> <b>projects</b> have not progressed past the early development stages. In late 2007, AIR Productions acquired the rights to produce a film based on Cassidy's life. It is being produced by Amy Redford (daughter of actor/director Robert Redford), Irwin Shapiro and Rick Singer. In an interview a year earlier, Cassidy's parents suggested Kirsten Dunst or Emily Watson as possible actresses who could play their daughter.|$|E
5|$|As New Orleans {{continues}} {{to recover from}} Hurricane Katrina, various projects have been proposed but increasing material and labor costs have eliminated some. The tallest tower approved for construction in the city was Trump International Hotel & Tower; upon completion it would have become the tallest building in New Orleans at a height of , but construction was delayed and eventually cancelled in 2011. Phase 3 of Canal Place is another skyscraper proposed for construction in the city.
