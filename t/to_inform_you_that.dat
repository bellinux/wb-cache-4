25|$|I {{am happy}} to be able <b>to</b> <b>inform</b> <b>you</b> <b>that</b> we have now in the United States a negro, {{the son of a}} black man born in Africa, and of a black woman born in the United States, who is a very respectable mathematician. I {{procured}} him to be employed under one of our chief directors in laying out the new federal city on the Patowmac, & in the intervals of his leisure, while on that work, he made an Almanac for the next year, which he sent me in his own hand writing, & which I inclose to you. I have seen very elegant solutions of Geometrical problems by him. Add to this that he is a very worthy & respectable member of society. He is a free man. I shall be delighted to see these instances of moral eminence so multiplied as to prove that the want of talents observed in them is merely the effect of their degraded condition, and not proceeding from any difference {{in the structure of the}} parts on which intellect depends.|$|E

Therefore I had Mr. Barber make me a proof of this change, and as this left so much blank space over the top we concluded {{that it would be better}} to put on the motto, [...] "In God We Trust".

Marianna screamed hysterically, ran to Edgardo's bed and shrieked {{that they would have to}} kill her before taking him. Lucidi said repeatedly that he was only following Feletti's orders. He reported afterwards that he [...] "would have a thousand times preferred to be exposed to much more serious dangers in performing my duties than to have to witness such a painful scene." ...|$|E

[...] General Washington, who was not always happy with the performance of the militias, wrote, [...] "Genl Dickinsons behaviour reflects the highest honour upon him, for tho' his Troops were all raw, he lead them thro' the River, middle deep, and gave the Enemy so severe a charge, that, altho' supported by three field pieces, they gave way and left their Convoy", and only reported the taking of nine prisoners.|$|E

A half {{hour before the}} press conference, White avoided metal detectors by entering City Hall through a basement window, and went to Moscone's office, where witnesses heard shouting followed by gunshots. White shot Moscone in the shoulder and chest, then twice in the head. White then quickly walked to his former office, reloading his police-issue revolver with hollow-point bullets along the way, and intercepted Milk, asking him to step inside for a moment. Dianne Feinstein heard gunshots and called police, then found Milk {{face down on the}} floor, shot five times, including twice in the head. Soon after, she announced to the press, [...] "Today San Francisco has experienced a double tragedy of immense proportions. As President of the Board of Supervisors, it is my duty <b>to</b> <b>inform</b> <b>you</b> <b>that</b> both Mayor Moscone and Supervisor Harvey Milk have been shot and killed, and the suspect is Supervisor Dan White."

500|$|Work for {{the season}} lasted only until 11 September, by which time the barrack legs had been secured {{although}} not the main structure.

It began: [...] "Dear Sir, I am extremely sorry <b>to</b> <b>inform</b> <b>you</b> <b>that</b> the barrack erected on Skerryvore Rock has totally disappeared." [...] The structure had been destroyed during in a gale on 3 November and four months effort had been wasted. Stevenson hired a boat to take him out to inspect the damage the same day he received this news. Firm in his self-belief, he resolved to build a stronger but otherwise identical replacement. Work began in April 1839 and by early September the completed barrack stood [...] above the rock. Entry was via ladders attached to the legs that led into the lowest level containing a kitchen. The middle level contained two cabins, one for Stevenson, the other for his master of works, whilst the top level provided sleeping quarters for a further 30 to 40 men.|$|E
