5|$|Data on Kepler-40 was {{analyzed}} {{by a team}} of French and Swiss astronomers, who first tested for false positives. When all obvious false positives were cleared, the science team used the SOPHIE échelle spectrograph at the Haute-Provence Observatory in southern France to gather radial velocity measurements on the star. Collected data was then checked to see if it corresponded with that of a closely orbiting binary star or that of a planet; it was found to be that of a planet, leading to <b>the</b> <b>confirmation</b> <b>of</b> Kepler-40b.|$|E

5|$|Ranking Democratic {{committee}} member Patrick Leahy objected to Republican {{use of a}} secret hold {{to slow down the}} Sotomayor nomination, and Leahy attributed that anonymous tactic to GOP reticence about publicly opposing a female Hispanic nominee. The prior month, Leahy had triggered a procedural delay in <b>the</b> <b>confirmation</b> <b>of</b> fellow Second Circuit nominee Chester J. Straub—who, although advanced by Clinton and supported by Senator Moynihan, was considered much more acceptable by Republicans—in an unsuccessful effort to force earlier consideration of the Sotomayor confirmation.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>confirmation</b> <b>of</b> HIP 78530 b was {{reported}} on January 24, 2011. In imaging the ninety-one stars, HIP 78530 b and 1RXSJ1609-2105b were discovered. The discoveries {{of these two}} orbiting bodies allowed astronomers to predict that bodies with such low planet/brown dwarf-to-star mass ratios (below 0.01) orbiting {{at a distance of}} hundreds of AU exists in the orbits of 2.2% of all stars. However, this number is a lower limit, as astronomers have been unable to detect smaller, low-mass planets that fit this scenario.|$|E

Wu later conducted research into the molecular changes in the deformation of hemoglobins that cause sickle-cell disease. She also did research on magnetism, and on the Mössbauer effect during the 1960s. She wrote a textbook with , Beta Decay, which was published in 1966, and became a standard reference on the subject.|$|E
