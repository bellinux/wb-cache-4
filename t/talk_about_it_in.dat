5|$|Murray {{grew up in}} Dunblane and {{attended}} Dunblane Primary School. He and his brother were present during the 1996 Dunblane school massacre, when Thomas Hamilton killed 16 children and a teacher before shooting himself; Murray took cover in a classroom. Murray says {{he was too young}} to understand what was happening and is reluctant to <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> interviews, but in his autobiography Hitting Back he states that he attended a youth group run by Hamilton, and that his mother gave Hamilton lifts in her car. Murray later attended Dunblane High School.|$|E

In bed, {{in the middle of}} the night, they find they are back to normal. They agree not to forget what has {{happened}} and <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> the morning, and the play ends as they sleep in each other's arms.|$|E
25|$|Although both {{footage and}} the film's soundtrack were off-limits, the {{designers}} {{were allowed to}} re-create the likenesses of the actors who {{had appeared in the}} film. Westwood never intended for Rick Deckard to be a major character in the game, but they did attempt to contact Harrison Ford with the intention of asking him to make a cameo appearance. However, they never received a response. This didn't surprise them, as Ford had had a negative experience working on the film and, at the time, even refused to <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> interviews. According to Castle, Ford was also against the concept of video games based on films in general. The designers were also unable to get any input from Ridley Scott, the film's director, as he too had had a bad experience on the film, and had fallen out with Yorkin and Perenchio when they took over production. He was uninterested in participating in the game.|$|E

2500|$|Nikita [...] "Nikki" [...] Singh {{is played}} by Anannya Kolvankar, and is the title {{character}} and the second-youngest Singh child. She is generally portrayed as being happy. It sometimes takes a few tries {{to get her to}} do the right thing. Many of the Singh family's adventures revolve around Nikki. Both her older brothers, Rohan and Sunny, are often seen using Nikki for their own benefit, although Rohan shows that he cares about her deeply. Sunny seems to dislike Nikki the most although, in some episodes, he is seen being quite fond of her. Himani thinks of Nikki as the perfect baby. It was revealed in [...] "Nikki is 1!" [...] that it was Dolly's idea to nickname her Nikki. Nikki speaks more often in later episodes of seasons two and three. Bobby was born on her birthday; she responded to this by [...] "I like this present." [...] In season three, her personality begins to develop, as she is seen as sneaky and mischievous, such as pretending to like a doll Himani bought for her to like Bobby, then throwing it away when she was not looking, and also telling Himani's [...] "friends" [...] what she really thinks of them, causing her to lose them all. Also, she is shown as not liking Bobby as in the episode [...] "The Extravagant Couch", when she asks Avatar if Bobby is going to stay at the hotel and he says no and Nikki asks if they can <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>it.</b> <b>In</b> Good Luck Charlie, Nikki is the equivalent of Charlie Duncan who {{is played by}} Mia Talerico.|$|E

60|$|Painful as {{this first}} re-introduction had been, {{there was not}} much more in it than that. No {{questions}} were asked, and no explanations expected. It may be that Mrs. Stantiloup was affected with fresh moral horrors when she heard of the return, and that the Bishop said that the Doctor was foolish and headstrong as ever. It may be that there was a good deal of <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> the Close at Broughton. But at the school there was very little more said about it than what has been stated above.|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{will be more}} {{convenient}} for me {{to talk with you}} about this to-morrow, than to-night, if you are willing to wait. Besides, we can examine it more calmly, then. But if we put it off till then, you must not <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> the meantime, blaming one another, and keeping up the irritation that you feel. Are you both willing to leave it just where it is, till to-morrow, and try to forget all about it till then? I expect I shall find you both a little to blame." ...|$|E

6000|$|It was {{possible}} that {{one or both of}} the negroes had discovered the mound, but it was difficult to believe that they would have dared to venture into that awful cavern, even if the vigilance of Edna, Mrs. Cliff, and the boy had given them an opportunity, and Edna had written that the two men had always slept outside the caves, and had had no call to enter them. Furthermore, if Cheditafa had found the treasure, why should he keep it a secret? He would most probably have considered it an original discovery, and would have spoken of it to the others. Why should he be willing that they should all go away and leave so much wealth behind them? The chief danger, in case Cheditafa had found the treasure, was that he would <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> Mexico or the United States. But, in spite of the hazards to which such disclosures might expose his fortunes, the captain would have preferred that the black men should have been pilferers than that other men should have been discoverers. But who else could have discovered it? Who could have been there? Who could have gone away? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "By George! {{she must}} be a stiff-necked one if she'll do that." [...] Then Mrs. Mountjoy, with tears in her eyes, began to explain with very many epithets that her {{daughter}} was the best girl in all the world. She was entirely worthy of confidence. Those who knew her were aware that no better behaved young woman could exist. She was conscientious, religious, and high-principled. [...] "But she'll {{go out in the}} streets and walk with a young man when all her friends tell her not. Is that her idea of religion?" [...] Then Mrs. Mountjoy, with some touch of anger in the tone of her voice, said that she would return to England, and carry her daughter with her. [...] "What the deuce can I do, Sarah, when the young lady is so unruly? I can give orders to have him shut out, and can take care that they are obeyed; but I cannot give orders to have her shut in. I should be making her a prisoner, and everybody would <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>it.</b> <b>In</b> that matter you must give her the orders;--only you say that she would not comply with them." ...|$|E
6000|$|Now, am I being unkind? Well, you mustn't mind me, Dolly. You must just say, [...] "She has got it bad," [...] {{and go on}} {{and learn}} as much about Altruria as you can from me. Some of the things were hard to get used to, and at first seemed quite impossible. For one thing, there was the matter of service, which is dishonorable with us, and honorable with the Altrurians: I {{was a long time}} getting to {{understand}} that, though I knew it perfectly well from hearing my husband <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> New York. I believe he once came pretty near offending you by asking why you did not do your own work, or something like that; he has confessed as much, and I could not wonder at you in your conditions. Why, when we first went to the guest-house, and the pretty young girls who brought in lunch sat down at table to eat it with us, I felt the indignation making me hot all over. You know how democratic I am, and I did not mind those great, splendid boat-girls hugging and kissing me, but I instinctively drew the line at cooks and waitresses. In New York, you know, I always tried to be kind to my servants, but as for letting one of them sit down in my presence, much less sit down at table with me, I never dreamed of such a thing in my most democratic moments. Luckily I drew the line subjectively here, and later I found that these young ladies were daughters {{of some of the most}} distinguished men and women on the continent, though you must not understand distinction as giving any sort of social primacy; that sort of thing is not allowed in Altruria. They had drawn lots with the girls in the Regionic school here, and were proud of having won the honor of waiting on us. Of course, I needn't say they were what we would have felt to be ladies anywhere, and their manners were exquisite, even to leaving us alone together as soon as we had finished luncheon. The meal itself was something I shall always remember for its delicious cooking of the different kinds of mushrooms which took the place of meat, and the wonderful salads, and the temperate and tropical fruits which we had for dessert.|$|E
