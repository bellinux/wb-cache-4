5|$|On September 10, 2013, a Deep Impact mission {{status report}} {{explained}} <b>that</b> <b>mission</b> controllers believe the computers on the spacecraft are continuously rebooting themselves {{and so are}} unable to issue any commands to the vehicle's thrusters. As {{a result of this}} problem, communication with the spacecraft was explained to be more difficult, as the orientation of the vehicle's antennas is unknown. Additionally, the solar panels on the vehicle may no longer be positioned correctly for generating power.|$|E

5|$|Ro joined Starfleet, {{and after}} being posted to the USS Wellington, she formed {{part of an}} away team. During <b>that</b> <b>mission,</b> she disobeyed orders, {{resulting}} {{in the death of}} eight crewmen. She was subsequently court-martialled, and was imprisoned on Jaros II. Admiral Kennelly (Cliff Potts) later gave her a pardon and allowed her to return to Starfleet service, in return for convincing the Bajoran terrorist Orta (Jeffrey Hayenga) to call off his attacks after a raid on a Federation colony. He brings her to the USS Enterprise for the purpose of completing this mission.|$|E
5|$|Several other Venus flybys {{took place}} in the 1980s and 1990s that {{increased}} the understanding of Venus, including Vega 1 (1985), Vega 2 (1985), Galileo (1990), Magellan (1994), Cassini–Huygens (1998), and MESSENGER (2006). Then, Venus Express by the European Space Agency (ESA) entered orbit around Venus in April 2006. Equipped with seven scientific instruments, Venus Express provided unprecedented long-term observation of Venus's atmosphere. ESA concluded <b>that</b> <b>mission</b> in December 2014.|$|E
5|$|The {{actions taken}} in earlier {{parts of a}} map can affect later parts of <b>that</b> <b>mission,</b> {{triggering}} scripted changes in objectives and enemy behavior: for instance, when a castle is raided, the neighboring castle will have troops ready to swarm attackers. After each action, a player character gains experience points, along with raising their health and magic meters, and giving random boosts to their statistics such as strength and agility. They may also learn new skills, including skills which are unique to specific characters. If they are defeated in battle, all characters are subject to permanent death, removing them {{from the rest of}} the game. If the army's leader is killed, the map must be restarted. Victory is achieved when the map's objective has been completed, which can vary from defeating an enemy force to capturing specific points on a map.|$|E

5|$|The {{new design}} reduced the bomb aimer's setup {{workload}} to dialling in four settings. Two of {{these could be}} set before the mission; the altitude of the target above sea level and the terminal velocity of the bomb, {{a function of the}} particular bomb being used on <b>that</b> <b>mission.</b> The only settings that had to be adjusted in flight were the measured wind direction and speed. The altitude, airspeed and course were all measured by the internal instruments and presented to the user in windows {{on the side of the}} computor case. Once set, the computor would automatically update the calculations and display the resulting bombing angle in another window. The computor could even account for steady changes in altitude, allowing the bomb run to take place in a shallow climb of up to 5 degrees or dive of up to 20 degrees.|$|E
5|$|After {{graduating from}} the U.S. Naval Academy in 1867, Sebree was posted {{to a number of}} vessels before being {{assigned}} to a rescue mission to find the remaining crew of the missing Polaris in the Navy's first mission to the Arctic. This attempt was only a partial success—the Polaris crew was rescued by a British ship rather than the US Navy—but this led to Sebree's selection eleven years later for a second expedition to the Arctic. <b>That</b> <b>mission</b> to rescue Adolphus Greely and the survivors of the Lady Franklin Bay expedition was a success. Sebree was subsequently appointed as the second acting governor of American Samoa. He served in this position for only a year before returning to the United States. In 1907, he was promoted to rear admiral and given command of the Pathfinder Expedition around the South American coast before being appointed commander of the 2nd Division of the Pacific Fleet and then commander-in-chief of the entire fleet. He retired in 1910 and died in Coronado, California, in 1922. Two geographical features in Alaska—Sebree Peak and Sebree Island—are named for Admiral Sebree.|$|E
