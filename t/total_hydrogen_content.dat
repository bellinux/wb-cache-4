Infrared, Raman and optical transmission measurements, correlated with electron paramagnetic resonance ones, are applied to characterize the Films in their as-deposited state.

A decrease of the optical gap, with increasing radiofrequency power also occurs, and might suggest an increasing overlapping of the Gaussian pi-pi* bands around the Fermi level. Simultaneously, an increase of the spin density is observed in the same range of the radiofrequency power, suggesting that most of the spins originate from C-sp(2) complexes. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|Hydrogenated {{amorphous}} silicon has been prepared at a plasma excitation frequency in the very-high-frequency band at 70 MHz with the glow discharge technique at substrate temperatures between 280 and 50 °C. The structural properties {{have been studied}} using hydrogen evolution, elastic recoil detection analysis, and infrared spectroscopy. The films were further characterized by dark and photoconductivity and by photothermal deflection spectroscopy. With respect to films prepared at the conventional frequency of 13. 56 MHz considerable differences concerning the electronic and structural properties are observed as the substrate temperature is decreased from 280 to 50 °C. Down to a substrate temperature of 150 °C the electronic film properties change only a little and the <b>total</b> <b>hydrogen</b> <b>content</b> c H {{and the degree of}} microstructure that can be directly correlated to c H increase only moderately.

40|$|The present work aims {{to model}} the {{fracture}} mechanical behavior of a high-strength low carbon steel, AISI 4130 operating in hydrogen contaminated environment. The study deals {{with the development of}} 2 D finite element cohesive zone model (CZM) reproducing a toughness test. Along the symmetry plane over the crack path of a C(T) specimen a zero thickness layer of cohesive elements are implemented in order to simulate the crack propagation. The main feature of this kind of model is the definition of a traction-separation law (TSL) that reproduces the constitutive response of the material inside to the cohesive elements. Starting from a TSL calibrated on hydrogen non-contaminated material, the embrittlement effect is simulated by reducing the cohesive energy according to the <b>total</b> <b>hydrogen</b> <b>content</b> including the lattice sites (NILS) and the trapped amount. In this perspective, the proposed model consists of three steps of simulations. First step evaluates the hydrostatic pressure. It drives the initial hydrogen concentration assigned in the second step, a mass diffusion analysis, defining in this way the contribution of hydrogen moving across the interstitial lattice sites. The final stress analysis, allows getting the <b>total</b> <b>hydrogen</b> <b>content,</b> including the trapped amount, and evaluating the new crack initiation and propagation due to the hydrogen presence. The model is implemented in both plane strain and plane stress configurations; results are compared in the discussion. From the analyses, it resulted that hydrogen is located only into lattice sites and not in traps, and that the considered steel experiences a high hydrogen susceptibility. By the proposed procedure, the developed numerical model seems a reliable and quick tool able to estimate the mechanical behavior of steels in presence of hydrogen...|$|E

The samples were grown by dc-saddle field glow discharge at various substrate temperatures between 150 and 300 °C. The tracer property of radioactive tritium is used to detect tritium release. Tritium effusion measurements are performed in a nonvacuum ion chamber and are found to yield similar results as reported for standard high vacuum technique. The results suggest for decreasing substrate temperature the growth of material with an increasing concentration of voids. These data are corroborated by analysis of infrared absorption data in terms of microstructure parameters.

The second process, slow tritium outgassing with a time constant of 200 - 300 h, appears to be limited by oxygen diffusivity in a growing oxide layer.

40|$|Abstract Hydrogen {{embrittlement}} is a {{degradation process}} of mechanical/tribological properties (toughness, wear etc.) of mating steel surfaces. This {{is caused by}} the presence and interaction of hydrogen with applied stresses. Therefore, it is important to quantify the <b>hydrogen</b> <b>content</b> which could be dissolved under applied stresses in steel. Water contamination of lubricants is often considered as a reason of hydrogen embrittlement of rolling bearings. Thus the effect of water and %RH (relative humidity) on the hydrogenation/dehydrogenation of steel was studied experimentally under different operating conditions. Two types of steels were used, that are silver steel and AISI- 52100 ball bearing steel. The testing conditions used in various tests, were percent relative humidity (%RH), temperature, rotating bending stresses, uni-axial tensile stress, rolling and sliding in combination with rotating bending stresses. As a first task, the <b>hydrogen</b> <b>content</b> was quantified in as-received specimens of bearing steel. The spread of <b>hydrogen</b> <b>content</b> was measured in radial and axial directions of the as-received bearing steel bars. This was done to show the importance of the internal hydrogen embrittlement effects of the initial <b>hydrogen</b> <b>content.</b> Sample melting technique (SMT) was used to quantitatively analyze the <b>total</b> <b>content</b> of <b>hydrogen</b> in all specimens using a hydrogen analyzer. In addition to this, Elastic Recoil Detection Technique (ERDT) was employed to qualitatively analyze the local <b>hydrogen</b> <b>content</b> distribution in soft and hard AISI- 52100 bearing steel. Secondly, the influence of applied stresses on the absorption of <b>hydrogen</b> <b>content</b> into respective steel specimens was studied. A rotating bending set up was used through a lathe machine. Water was used as a source of hydrogen charging of the testing samples in all rotating bending tests. The influence of rotating bending stresses on the absorption of hydrogen was studied in silver steel and in bearing steel bar samples. Further, a universal fatigue testing machine was used to study the effect of cyclic released uni-axial tension on the absorption of hydrogen in the bearing steel. Similarly, the influence of Sliding and Rolling on the absorption/desorption of <b>hydrogen</b> <b>content</b> was studied in combination of rotating bending stresses using the same lathe machine. Mild and water quenched silver steel bar specimens were used to study the influence of quenching and applied stresses on the absorption of hydrogen. Finally, the experiments were conducted on SKF- 624 deep groove ball bearing (DGBB) under isolated operating environment. Non water absorbing grease was used as lubricant. Tests were run for 10 % of L 10 life of deep groove ball bearing. Two different amplitudes of pure radial loading were selected for testing under high and low relative humidity of the operating environment. <b>Total</b> <b>content</b> of <b>hydrogen</b> was measured in the inner ring, outer ring and 7 -balls of DGBB (deep groove ball bearing) using the hydrogen analyzer. Results are presented for total dissolved (or absorbed) <b>hydrogen</b> <b>content</b> in various components as a function of bearing shaft revolutions and operating conditions. Results obtained revealed a dependence of <b>total</b> <b>content</b> of <b>hydrogen</b> on the number of inner ring shaft revolutions. Hydrogen seems to accumulate in the specimens with the increase of number of stress cycles or shaft revolutions...|$|R
