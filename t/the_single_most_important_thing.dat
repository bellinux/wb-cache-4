2500|$|Grant was {{instrumental}} in setting up Led Zeppelin's publishing company, Superhype Music in 1968. He was also the driving force in establishing Swan Song Records in 1974, which gave Led Zeppelin further financial and artistic control over its products. Although initially he solely managed Led Zeppelin, in later years he additionally assumed management of other bands signed to Swan Song, such as Stone the Crows, Bad Company and Maggie Bell. In 1975 he turned down a lucrative offer to manage Queen. When he was once questioned on what was <b>the</b> <b>single</b> <b>most</b> <b>important</b> <b>thing</b> a manager could say, Grant's response was [...] "Know when to say 'no'." [...] In 1977, he was asked by Colonel Tom Parker to manage a proposed concert tour of Europe by Elvis Presley, but Elvis died on 16 August 1977, just as negotiations had commenced.|$|E

50|$|An {{important}} factor in map symbols is {{the order in which}} they are ranked according to their relative importance. This is known as intellectual hierarchy. The most important hierarchy is the thematic symbols and type labels that are directly related to the theme. Next comes the title, subtitle, and legend. The map must also contain base information, such as boundaries, roads, and place names. Data source and notes should be on all maps. Lastly, the scale, neat lines, and north arrow are the least important of the hierarchy of the map. From this we see that the symbols are <b>the</b> <b>single</b> <b>most</b> <b>important</b> <b>thing</b> to build a good visual hierarchy that shows proper graphical representation. When producing a map with good visual hierarchy, thematic symbols should be graphically emphasized. A map with a visual hierarchy that is effective attracts the map user’s eyes to the symbols with the most important aspects of the map first and to the symbols with the lesser importance later.|$|E

For winners with a U.S.-issued Social Security number, prizes of $5,000 or more are subject to Louisiana income tax withholding, and also have federal tax withheld. Unpaid child support owed by the winner may also be withheld. Annuitized prizes are {{the property of the}} winner’s estate in the event of death. Lottery tickets are bearer instruments, which means that the Lottery must pay the holder of a winning ticket presented for payment. Signing the back of the ticket is <b>the</b> <b>single</b> <b>most</b> <b>important</b> <b>thing</b> one can do to help protect themselves from theft and demonstrate ownership of the ticket. Any alteration to a winning ticket worth more than $600 is cause for an immediate security investigation. Once a winning ticket has been paid, however, it is much more difficult to determine whether another individual was the rightful owner. By law, the Lottery can pay a winning ticket only once.|$|E

5000|$|For Melvilles allegory <b>the</b> <b>single</b> <b>most</b> <b>important</b> <b>thing</b> {{was that}} Ahab [...] "did {{evil in the}} sight of the Lord above all that were before him" [...] in 16:30-31. The Biblical Ahab foreshadows the tragic end of Captain Ahab and the {{essential}} duality of his character. Both Ahabs are shrewd in their secular associations. The captain is successful in whaling, with a record of forty years. [...] "The very evidence of this success," [...] Nathalia Wright observes, [...] "is fantastically like that in King Ahabs story: Captain Ahab, too, lives in an ivory house, the ivory Pequod as it is often called, tricked out in trophies of whale bones and teeth from profitable voyages." [...] The ships last voyage, however, is not entirely commercial: from the moment Ahab attaches the golden doubloon on the mast, it becomes a pursuit of a perceived enemy, under a captain unable to compromise. King Ahab, an able politician but a patron of foreign gods, offended Jehovah by introducing Baal as a god. Jehovah tolerated no other gods and contrived with false prophets to destroy King Ahab.|$|E
