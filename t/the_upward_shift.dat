What land cover / land use classes did primarily regenerate to forest, and what forest structural types did primarily regenerate? And, what are possible drivers of forest regeneration in the tree line ecotone, climate and/or land use change? Location: Swiss Alps. Methods: Forest expansion was quantified {{using data from the}} repeated Swiss land use statistics GEOSTAT. A moving window algorithm was developed to distinguish between forest ingrowth and <b>upward</b> <b>shift.</b> To test a possible climate change influence, <b>the</b> resulting <b>upward</b> <b>shifts</b> were compared to a potential regional tree line. Results: A significant increase of forest cover was found between 1650 to and 2450 m. Above 1650 m, 10 % of the new forest areas were identified as true <b>upward</b> <b>shifts</b> whereas 90 % represented ingrowth, and we identified both land use and climate change as likely drivers.

Only 4 % of <b>the</b> <b>upward</b> <b>shifts</b> were identified to rise above the potential regional tree line, thus indicating climate change. Conclusions: Land abandonment was the most dominant driver for the establishment of new forest areas, even at the tree line ecotone.

The influence of bioturbation on vertical SOM transport is complex {{because it is the}} result of interaction between different groups of soil faunal species that redistribute SOM through the soil profile in distinct ways. We performed a semi-quantitative micromorphological analysis of soil faunal pedofeatures and related their occurrence to the vertical distribution of SOM and high-resolution radiocarbon dating in volcanic ash soils under montane forest and grassland (paramo) vegetation in the northern Ecuadorian Andes. The paramo soil data suggest that bioturbation was largely responsible for the vertical distribution of SOM, while illuviation and root input were of minor importance. Bioturbation was caused by endogeic species, which typically mix the soil only over short vertical distances.

The treatment of HL- 1 adult mouse atrial-muscle cells with ET- 1 (30 nM) caused a rapid increase in the DNA binding activity of GATA- 4 within 3 min. The activation was associated with an upward mobility shift of the GATA- 4 band on native PAGE in an electrophoretic- mobility-shift assay. <b>The</b> <b>upward</b> <b>shift</b> of the GATA- 4 band also occurred on SDS/PAGE as monitored by immunoblotting.

40|$|Resurvey of {{historical}} plant distribution data can provide valuable {{information about how}} plant communities have changed, a topic which is of great interest due to recent decades of climate and land use change. Range shifts towards higher elevations have been observed for alpine vegetation in mountainous areas {{all over the world}} during the recent decades. A correlation in time between the observed range shift and climatic changes has led to an expectation of climate as the driving factor, while other factors and their interactions with climate have received less attention. One factor which might affect species distribution, both directly and in interaction with climate, is dynamics in the species communities induced by two key factors of disturbance: large herbivores and hikers. Intensity of these factors has changed dramatically over the past century. I investigated the effect of large herbivore grazing and hiking on upward plant species range shift and dynamics in the summit flora species composition, through a resurvey study in three areas along the south-north axis of the Scandes. I demonstrate a buffering effect on <b>the</b> <b>upward</b> range <b>shift</b> from grazing by semi- domestic reindeer and sheep.

40|$|Many {{features}} of the general circulation of the atmosphere shift upward in response to warming in simulations of climate change with both general circulation models (GCMs) and cloud-system-resolving models. The importance of <b>the</b> <b>upward</b> <b>shift</b> is well known, but its physical basis {{and the extent to}} which it occurs coherently across variables are not well understood. A transformation is derived here that shows how an upward shift of a solution to the moist primitive equations gives a new approximate solution with higher tropospheric temperatures. According to the transformation, all variables shift upward with warming but with an additional modification to the temperature and a general weakening of the pressure velocity. The applicability of the vertical-shift transformation is explored using a hierarchy of models from adiabatic parcel ascents to comprehensive GCMs. The transformation is found to capture many {{features of}} the response to climate change in simulations with an idealized GCM, including the mid- and upper-tropospheric changes in lapse rate, relative humidity, and meridional wind. The transformation is less accurate when applied to simulations with more realistic GCMs, but it nonetheless captures some important features. Deviations from the simulated response are primarily due to the surface boundary conditions, which do not necessarily conform to the transformation, especially in the case of the zonal winds. The results allow for a physical interpretation of <b>the</b> <b>upward</b> <b>shift</b> in terms of the governing equations and suggest that it may be thought of as a coherent response of the general circulation of the mid- and upper troposphere.
