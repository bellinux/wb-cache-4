500|$|Dworkin {{rejected}} that interpretation of her argument, stating {{in a later}} interview that [...] "I think both intercourse and sexual pleasure can and will survive equality" [...] and suggesting that the misunderstanding came about because of the very sexual ideology she was criticizing: [...] "Since the paradigm for sex {{has been one of}} conquest, possession, and violation, I <b>think</b> <b>many</b> men believe they need an unfair advantage, which at its extreme would be called rape. I do not think they need it." ...|$|E
500|$|Following {{the high}} mintage of the Bicentennial piece, {{the number of}} pieces struck per year declined. [...] However, in 1979, Mint Director Stella B. Hackel {{indicated}} that the Mint would continue to strike them. [...] "We really don't <b>think</b> <b>many</b> half dollars are being used in commerce. [...] They do go somewhere, though, so someone must want them." [...] By then, more than 2.5billion Kennedy half dollars had been struck, more than all previously struck half dollars combined. [...] The New York Times numismatic columnist Ed Reiter suggested that hoarding had continued even into the base-metal era, accounting for the shortage of pieces in commerce. [...] 1979-80 saw the destruction of many early Kennedy half dollars, as record high silver prices caused extensive melting of silver coins for their [...] metal content.|$|E
50|$|Kids: For example, Akinori Otsuka {{said his}} nine-year-old son throws a gyroball-like ball even though Otsuka himself cannot throw it. Tezuka <b>thinks</b> <b>many</b> {{children}} throw it unconsciously before their instructors modify their natural pitching form.|$|R
40|$|Megacities {{are a new}} {{phenomenon}} in history. The {{fact that many of}} them are in emerging countries deepens the challenges of governing these spaces. Can these vast, complex entities, rife with inequalities and divisions, be governed effectively? Elli Thomas <b>thinks</b> <b>many</b> of the conclusions made in Governing Megacities will be relevant for urban policymakers for a long time yet...|$|R
500|$|The cast's {{opinions}} {{on why the}} movie has endured differ. Hathaway told Variety that she <b>thinks</b> <b>many</b> people relate to Andy's predicament of working for someone who seems impossible to please. [...] "Everybody has had an experience like this." [...] Tucci did not believe specific explanations were necessary. [...] "It’s a fucking brilliant movie ... The brilliant movies become influential, {{no matter what they}} are about." ...|$|R
500|$|Loretta {{has stated}} {{on-screen}} {{that she does}} not want to conform with the stereotype of a blond pole dancer, and makes it clear that she is a keen bird watcher and enjoys documentaries. Speaking of the character Walton stated, [...] "I love that Loretta's not a stereotypical stripper sort of girl—there’s a lot more depth to her. She’s actually quite shy and reserved. She’s got lots of interesting little hobbies, like bird-watching and Roman history! Then at night she skips off and turns into a stripper. It’s like two different lives, and I <b>think</b> <b>many</b> real-life pole-dancers are like that. They’re really nice, normal girls by day, and by night they turn into these temptresses." [...] Walton also praised the soap's realistic portrayal of the occupation, saying that many pole dancers attend university or have good professions but rely on stripping for extra money, and that she has met people like her character in the strip club where Hollyoaks films scenes.|$|E
500|$|Yuri on Ice has {{highlighted}} homophobia {{in figure}} skating and other areas; the seventh episode features a flashback {{in which a}} younger Victor performs in a costume based on those worn by openly-gay figure skater Johnny Weir, who was subject to homophobic comments throughout his career. Weir {{said in an interview}} with The Geekiary, [...] "I think all positive imagery of LGBT themes in sport are good. Unfortunately, the majority of people that rule the skating world are conservative and more business minded. I <b>think</b> <b>many</b> of them, while they may love and appreciate the art and the sport, are more interested in the business side of things or power trips. I don't know if Yuri on Ice will be able to change the perception of gay athletes to a 60 year old businessman, but I am of the school of thought that every little bit helps". The series finale features a scene in which Yuri K. and Victor skate together at an exhibition event; something which has not yet occurred in actual competition. Critics have noted that the series depicts two characters from countries with problems concerning LGBT rights.|$|E
2500|$|However, Buddhadasa {{was skeptical}} of his fame; when {{reflecting}} on the busloads of visitors to Suan Mokkh he would say, [...] "sometimes I <b>think</b> <b>many</b> of these people just stop here {{because they have to}} visit the bathroom." ...|$|E

2500|$|Prior to Lakin officially violating {{his order}} to deploy, former Republican U.S. Senator Bob Smith, {{who founded the}} American Patriot Foundation, said: [...] "...my {{personal}} belief is that when an officer has a constitutional question I don't {{have a problem with}} that being answered, that's his legal right to have that answered, but I'm not involved in it." [...] Three retired United States generals expressed support for Lakin. [...] The first was retired Army Major General Paul E. Vallely, a senior military analyst for Fox News. [...] In an interview, Vallely stated [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>many</b> in the military – and many out of the military – question the natural-birth status of Barack Obama." [...] Following Vallely's announcement, retired Army Major General Jerry Curry and retired Air Force Lieutenant General (and Fox News analyst) Thomas McInerney also expressed public support for Lakin.|$|E
2500|$|Commentators {{attributed}} the rivalry between {{the left and}} the right as an important factor in the controversy. The NAACP had passed a resolution asking the Tea Party to repudiate racist language among its members. Breitbart said he posted the videos in response. [...] Commentators from each side noted that racial issues were being manipulated for political gain. Imani Perry, a professor at Princeton's Center for African American Studies, said some conservatives manipulated white fears for political advantage:I <b>think</b> <b>many</b> white Americans are fearful that with Obama in the White House, and the diversity in his appointments, that the racial balance of power is shifting. And that's frightening both because people always are afraid to give up privilege, and because of the prospect of a black-and-brown backlash against a very ugly history. Some liberals have long maintained that racism requires power, and so black people can't be racist. Obama's election undercut the first argument and made the specter of black racism appear more threatening.|$|E
2500|$|On December 29, 2013 DiFranco {{issued an}} apology, announcing {{that she was}} {{cancelling}} the retreat, stating that [...] "i am not unaware of the mechanism of white privilege {{or the fact that}} i need to listen more than talk when it comes to issues of race. if nottoway is simply not an acceptable place for me to go and try to do my work in the eyes of many, then let me just concede before more divisive words are spilled. ... i <b>think</b> <b>many</b> positive and life-affirming connections would have been made at this conference, in its all of its complexity of design. [...] {{i do not wish to}} reinvent the righteous retreat at this point to eliminate the stay at the Nottoway Plantation. at this point I wish only to cancel." [...] The singer's statements were called [...] "remarkably unapologetic" [...] on Jezebel, and [...] "a variety of excuses and justifications" [...] by Ebony,. Additionally, a piece at The Guardian said the announcement made [...] "much of the idea that this was all a mistake, with no indication of remorse." ...|$|E

500|$|According to Josh Weinstein, {{when the}} episode was first broadcast, many fans {{felt it was}} too dark, lacked humor and that Homer was portrayed as overly bad-mannered. Weinstein {{considers}} this episode {{one of the most}} controversial of the seasons he ran, as it involves sharp observational humor which he <b>thinks</b> <b>many</b> fans [...] "didn't get." [...] Weinstein also talks about a [...] "generation gap"—he believes the episode was originally panned by viewers, but has since become a favorite among fans who grew up with the show.|$|R
2500|$|As {{former member}} and founder Bullington puts it [...] "we {{can play an}} old folks home in the {{afternoon}} and then play for a bunch of punk rockers, or whoever else might still be up and ready for a good time, or some music at midnight. They all seem to enjoy it equally." [...] Fellow founder Sickmen claims [...] "the original intent of the band [...] [...] was to bring old-time Appalachian country punk rock." [...] Band member Jesse [...] "Baby J." [...] Fiske questions the importance of assigning a specific style: [...] "We're not really an old-time band either. As long as we speak to someone, it doesn't really matter what the genre is." [...] The group largely performs original material, with a traditional feel. [...] As former member Shawn Galbraith, banjo player, puts it: [...] "We play original material provided by different members of the band. There are some traditional elements to our sound for sure, but we always try to maintain some uniqueness." [...] "I don't <b>think</b> <b>many</b> people would call us a traditional oldtime band," [...] states bandleader David Sickmen: [...] "I'd say our songs are about ninety percent originals. Then we have some old-time songs we play in our own way." ...|$|E
2500|$|A {{few months}} after the pageant, Williams {{discussed}} the apology in an interview with Gayle King, Charlie Rose, and Norah O'Donnell for CBS This Morning. King asked her about the circumstances that led to it stating, [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>many</b> people were touched when the Miss America pageant issued an apology to you.” Williams credited Haskell (who was one of her judges during the Miss America 1984 pageant) for orchestrating her return. While both she and her mother initially responded with hesitation to the invitation, Williams finally agreed to participate on the condition that she could sing her song [...] "Oh How the Years Go By" [...] (to symbolize the passing of time since she was Miss America). She didn't know what Haskel would say, stating that she was simply told to stand and wait for him during the commercial break that would take place after her song. It was only when he arrived and placed his hand on her back (where she noticed that his hand was shaking) that Williams realized something significant was about to happen. Williams said {{that one of the most}} important outcomes of the apology was the positive impact that it had on her mother, who [...] "endured a lot" [...] during that period.|$|E
2500|$|Wales' maiden {{appearance}} in the tournament, {{it was also the}} only time all four of the Home Nations qualified for the same World Cup, though only Wales and Northern Ireland made it past the group stage. The Welsh FA were pessimistic for their prospects, and before the tournament they arranged for five days of training on some free land at Hyde Park and booked the flights home for before the beginning of the knockout stages. Manager Jimmy Murphy used highly defensive tactics, they would prove highly effective as Wales never conceded more than once in any of their five games in the tournament. Wales remained undefeated in the group stage, battling to draws with Hungary, Mexico, and eventual runners-up Sweden. Wales had played well against the Hungarians but played poorly against the Mexicans, though they still came close to recording two victories; in the third match both the Swedes and the Welsh were happy to amble to a draw, as that way both sides remained in the competition. As Hungary also recorded three points in the group, a play-off match ensued, and Wales came from behind at the Råsunda Stadium to advance with a 2–1 win; however due to dirty play from the opposition John Charles was injured in the match and missed out {{on the rest of the}} tournament. The Welsh were eventually knocked out by Brazil in the quarter-finals at the Ullevi stadium in Gothenburg, thanks to a goal by Pelé in the 66th minute – this was only Pelé's second game for his country, and the goal made him the youngest player ever to score in a World Cup game. Charles later recalled that Pelé miskicked the ball, and even in later life it upset him greatly to remember the ball trickling across the line. Pelé himself said that Charles was the best centre-half of the tournament, and the Brazilian swapped shirts with Charles after the game. The Brazilians went on to win the competition. It was a difficult experience for Wales, who were forced to play five highly competitive games in eleven days. Despite their heroics, the competition received little publicity in Britain at the time – the South Wales Evening Post's back page headlined a Glamorgan cricket match – and Charles said in his autobiography that [...] "I don't <b>think</b> <b>many</b> people in Wales even knew the World Cup was on." ...|$|E

5000|$|John H. Collins, {{analysing}} {{the influence}} of Mudford's work, comments that [...] "the Shroud story is a first rate piece of writing comparable to the best half-dozen works by Poe" [...] and that [...] "it should not just be dismissed as a mere potboiler which the genius of Poe transformed." [...] He goes on to mention that he <b>thinks</b> <b>many</b> readers mistakenly <b>think</b> that the [...] "Iron Shroud" [...] is one of Poe's works thus further strengthening Poe's reputation by attributing to him a story that he actually plagiarised.|$|R
