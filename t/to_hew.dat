5|$|After {{the opera}} became {{successful}} in London, Richard D'Oyly Carte quickly sent touring companies into the British provinces. At least one D'Oyly Carte company, and sometimes {{as many as}} three, played Pinafore under Carte's aegis every year between 1878 and 1888, including its first London revival in 1887. The opera was then given a rest, returning to the touring repertory between 1894 and 1900 and again {{for most of the}} time between 1903 and 1940. Gilbert directed all the revivals during his lifetime, and after his death, the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company had exclusive performing rights to the Savoy operas until 1962. It continued <b>to</b> <b>hew</b> closely to Gilbert's directions throughout that period, as recorded in Gilbert's prompt books, and it also required its licensees to follow them closely.|$|E
25|$|Born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, Bork {{pursued a}} legal career after {{attending}} the University of Chicago. After {{working at the}} law firm of Kirkland & Ellis, he served as a Yale Law School professor. He became a prominent advocate of originalism, calling for judges <b>to</b> <b>hew</b> to the framers' original understanding of the United States Constitution. Bork also became an influential antitrust scholar, arguing that consumers often benefited from corporate mergers and that antitrust law should focus on consumer welfare rather than on ensuring competition. Bork wrote several notable books, including The Antitrust Paradox and Slouching Towards Gomorrah.|$|E

It was passed to his illegitimate son, [...] George Douglas, later created Earl of Angus, and despite several sieges, it {{remained}} the property of his descendants for much of its history. It was besieged by King James IV in 1491, and again by his successor James V in 1528, when extensive damage was done. Tantallon saw action in the First Bishops' War in 1639, and again during Oliver Cromwell's invasion of Scotland in 1651, when it was once more severely damaged. It was sold by the Marquis of Douglas in 1699 <b>to</b> <b>Hew</b> Dalrymple, Lord North Berwick and the ruin is today in the care of Historic Scotland.|$|E

2500|$|David Souter, in one {{of three}} dissents, used Connick to {{indicate}} one extreme of the continuum of free speech claims, that where no constitutional interest could be found. He argued the majority was applying precedents in an overly broad fashion; Ceballos was not being paid for his speech as much for his legal skills. [...] "The only sense in which his position apparently required him <b>to</b> <b>hew</b> to a substantive message was at the relatively abstract point of favoring respect for law and its evenhanded enforcement, subjects that are not at the level of controversy in this case." [...] Stephen Breyer also noted that Ceballos had professional and ethical reasons that could have compelled him to speak as he did, and the Court should have been mindful of that.|$|E
2500|$|In 1939 he left Zagreb for Argentina {{to write}} an article on Croat exiles for a Zagreb {{newspaper}} Hrvatski Dnevnik. Sekelj was on the ship Teresa on {{what might have been}} that ship's last voyage due to the start of World War II. In 1939 the other ships that normally traveled to South America from Rijeka-Fiume were being used by Italy due to the war in Africa. Setting sail from Rijeka (then Fiume in Italy), he headed for Buenos Aires, with stops in Naples, Genoa (Italy) Santos (Brazil), and Montevideo (Uruguay). Tibor reached Buenos Aires on August 19, 1939. A pacifist by nature, Sekelj had anticipated the outbreak of war and so chose to be far from the fighting. [...] This difficult decision was due not to a lack of personal courage—Sekelj was known to display almost foolhardy bravery throughout his life—but because this Jewish Hungarian/world citizen was simply unwilling <b>to</b> <b>hew</b> to any ideology tied to military purposes.|$|E

2500|$|After Simeona's {{death in}} 1992, her former student and administrator, Ihaleakala Hew Len, co-authored {{a book with}} Joe Vitale called Zero Limits {{referring}} to Simeona's Hooponopono teachings. Len makes no {{claim to be a}} kahuna. In contrast to Simeona's teachings, the book brings the new idea that the main objective of Hooponopono is getting to [...] "the state of Zero, where we would have zero limits. No memories. No identity." [...] To reach this state, which Len called 'Self-I-Dentity thru Ho'oponopono', includes using the mantra, [...] "I love you. I'm sorry. Please forgive me. [...] Thank you." [...] It is based on Len's idea of 100% responsibility, taking responsibility for everyone's actions, not only for one's own. If one would take complete responsibility for one's life, then everything one sees, hears, tastes, touches, or in any way experiences would be one's responsibility because it is in one's life. The problem would not be with our external reality, it would be with ourselves. Total Responsibility, according <b>to</b> <b>Hew</b> Len, advocates that everything exists as a projection from inside the human being. As such, it is similar to the philosophy of solipsism.|$|E
2500|$|A {{few months}} after Sony {{acquired}} the film's North American distribution rights, it was announced by The Hollywood Reporter that its subsidiary company, Screen Gems, had begun negotiations to produce a Hollywood remake. The deal was completed in November 2011, with writer-director Gareth Evans {{to serve as an}} executive producer of the remake. XYZ Films, executive producers on the original Indonesian version, will be producers on the American version. Screen Gems also wants the same choreographers from The Raid involved with the remake.

On 4 August 2014, The Wrap reported that Taylor Kitsch has been cast in the lead role, and also that XYZ Films is returning to produce the remake, which is expected <b>to</b> <b>hew</b> closely to the original film. On August 22, 2014, Hughes revealed that describes his version as being in the vein of Black Hawk Down and Zero Dark Thirty with 12 integral roles [...] According to Tracking Board, on October 23, 2015, both Screen Gems and Kitsch had dropped out of the project and Hughes also dropped out as director. In February 2017, XYZ Films revealed that Joe Carnahan will produce and direct the remake with Evans as a producer.|$|E

Material and Methods: In-depth interview <b>to</b> 20 <b>HEWs,</b> seven focus discussion with malaria treated patients, and 400 malaria patients medical records review were conducted. Results: The majority of HEWs correctly responded how to diagnose malaria patients using signs and symptoms, and rapid diagnostic test (RDT).
