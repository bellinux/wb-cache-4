A case study has been conducted with a large brewery <b>company</b> as <b>the</b> case organization. We have been looking at the use of mobile ICT and how the sales consultants relate to the recently implemented mobile applications. The main research question is: How can mobile workers relate to recently implemented mobile ICT? In addition to this, there are three sub questions.
