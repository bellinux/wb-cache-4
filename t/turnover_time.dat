5|$|In 2011, The Royal Park {{embarked}} on {{the restoration of}} the Serpentine to combat growing concerns about the status of the water {{and the quality of the}} aquatic environment. The project resulted in a substantial change to the hydrology of the lake, which had a <b>turnover</b> <b>time</b> of 10 years, and is now reduced to 4–5 months as a result of new borehole water being pumped into the lake. The three boreholes, drilled into the Upper Chalk, now supply the lake with up to 900,000 cubic metres of water per annum ensuring that the lake remains fresh and does not stagnate. In addition, the historically contaminated sediments have been treated and nutrients within the sediments chemically neutralised. Thirdly, the oxygen status of the water and the overall mixing of the lake is now controlled by a series of 24 aeration pumps fixed to the base of the lake. These ensure that the dissolved oxygen levels in the lake do not fall and result in chronic ecological stress. Finally, the overall ecology of the lake was reviewed and some of the large bream and carp were removed in February 2012 to reduce their disturbance of the sediment and vegetation of the lake. These measures were implemented over the period October 2011 to June 2012. The resultant water quality of the lake was excellent and proved to be an extremely popular venue for the swimming portion of the London 2012 Triathlon and the Marathon Swim events in August 2012.|$|E

25|$|Oslo was at {{the time}} a highly {{segregated}} community with little interaction between the higher and lower classes. Amongst the concerns of the upper classes was that the trams would become popular with the lower classes and that there would be more interaction between classes. At first there were no regular stops, the horsecar would simply lower its speed and allow people to jump on and off where they wished. This was especially important on hills to keep the momentum and not wear out the horses. The horsecar would stop for elderly passengers and those of sufficient prominence. The company took delivery of seventeen sleds for use during winter. These proved much less suitable for operations, as the horses could not pull the same load on snow as on rails. The <b>turnover</b> <b>time</b> for horses was reduced, resulting in increased headway. The company therefore decided to salt and plow the tracks and instead use the horsecars during winter.|$|E
40|$|Potential {{benefits}} to reducing <b>turnover</b> <b>times</b> are both quantitative (e. g., complete more cases and reduce staffing costs) and qualitative (e. g., improve professional satisfaction). Analyses {{have shown the}} quantitative arguments to be unsound except for reducing staffing costs. We describe a methodology by which each surgical suite can use its own numbers to calculate its individual potential reduction in staffing costs from reducing its <b>turnover</b> <b>times.</b> Calculations estimate optimal allocated operating room (OR) time (based on maximizing OR efficiency) before and after reducing the maximum and average <b>turnover</b> <b>times.</b> At four academic tertiary hospitals, reductions in average <b>turnover</b> <b>times</b> of 3 to 9 min would result in 0. 8 % to 1. 8 % When surgeons evaluated the performance of an academic anesthesiology department, they rated <b>turnover</b> <b>times</b> {{as the most important}} quality attribute with below average performance (1).

40|$|We {{report the}} first attempt to {{estimate}} fungal biomass production in soil by correlating relative fungal growth rates (i. e., acetate incorporation into ergosterol) with fungal biomass increase (i. e., ergosterol) following amendments with dried alfalfa or barley straw in soil.

2500|$|A common {{feature of}} many {{tropical}} rainforests is the distinct buttress roots of trees. [...] Instead of penetrating to deeper soil layers, buttress roots create a widespread root network {{at the surface}} for more efficient uptake of nutrients in a very nutrient poor and competitive environment. Most of the nutrients within the soil of a tropical rainforest occur near the surface because of the rapid <b>turnover</b> <b>time</b> and decomposition of organisms and leaves. Because of this, the buttress roots occur at the surface so the trees can maximize uptake and actively compete with the rapid uptake of other trees. These roots also aid in water uptake and storage, increase surface area for gas exchange, and collect leaf litter for added nutrition. Additionally, these roots reduce soil erosion and maximize nutrient acquisition during heavy rains by diverting nutrient rich water flowing down the trunk into several smaller flows while also acting {{as a barrier to}} ground flow. Also, the large surface areas these roots create provide support and stability to rainforests trees, which commonly grow to significant heights. This added stability allows these trees to withstand the impacts of severe storms, thus reducing the occurrence of fallen trees.|$|E
2500|$|Currency {{is defined}} as the unit that is {{optimized}} by the animal. [...] It is also a hypothesis of the costs and benefits that are imposed on that animal. [...] For example, a certain forager gains energy from food, but incurs the cost of searching for the food: the time and energy spent searching could have been used instead on other endeavors, such as finding mates or protecting young. [...] It would be in the animal's best interest to maximize its benefits at the lowest cost. [...] Thus, the currency in this situation could be defined as net energy gain per unit time. [...] However, for a different forager, {{the time it takes to}} digest the food after eating could be a more significant cost than the time and energy spent looking for food. In this case, the currency could be defined as net energy gain per digestive <b>turnover</b> <b>time</b> instead of net energy gain per unit time. Furthermore, benefits and costs can depend on a forager's community. [...] For example, a forager living in a hive would most likely forage in a manner that would maximize efficiency for its colony rather than itself. By identifying the currency, one can construct a hypothesis about which benefits and costs are important to the forager in question.|$|E
40|$|We {{investigated}} the decomposability of {{soil organic matter}} (SOM) along a chronosequence of rainforest sites in Hawaii that form a natural fertility gradient and at two long-term fertilization experiments. To estimate <b>turnover</b> <b>times</b> and pool sizes of organic matter, we used two independent methods: (1) long-term incubations and (2) a three-box soil model constrained by radiocarbon measurements. <b>Turnover</b> <b>times</b> of slow-pool SOM (the intermediate pool between active and passive pools) calculated from incubations ranged from 6 to 20 y in the 0 horizon and were roughly half as fast in the A horizon. The radiocarbon-based model yielded a similar pattern but slower <b>turnover</b> <b>times.</b> The calculation of the C- 14 <b>turnover</b> <b>times</b> is sensitive to the lag time between photosynthesis and incorporation of organic C into SOM in a given horizon. By either method, <b>turnover</b> <b>times</b> at the different sites varied two- or threefold in soils with the same climate and vegetation community. <b>Turnover</b> <b>times</b> were fastest at the sites of highest soil fertility and were correlated with litter decay rates and primary productivity. However, experimental fertilization at the two least-fertile sites had only a small and inconsistent effect on turnover, with N slowing turnover and P slightly speeding it at one site. These results support studies of litter decomposition in suggesting that while plant productivity can respond rapidly to nutrient additions, decomposition may respond much more slowly to added nutrients...|$|R

40|$|Previous {{studies of}} the {{subsurface}} biosphere have deduced average cellular doubling times of hundreds to thousands of years based upon geochemical models. We have directly constrained the in situ average cellular protein <b>turnover</b> or doubling <b>times</b> for metabolically active micro-organisms based on cellular amino acid abundances, D/L values of cellular aspartic acid, and the in vivo aspartic acid racemization rate. Application of this method to planktonic microbial communities collected from deep fractures in South Africa yielded maximum cellular amino acid <b>turnover</b> <b>times</b> of approximately 89 years for 1 km depth and 27 C and 1 - 2 years for 3 km depth and 54 C. The latter <b>turnover</b> <b>times</b> are much shorter than previously estimated cellular <b>turnover</b> <b>times</b> based upon geochemical arguments. The aspartic acid racemization rate at higher temperatures yields cellular protein doubling times {{that are consistent with}} the survival times of hyperthermophilic strains and predicts that at temperatures of 85 C, cells must replace proteins every couple of days to maintain enzymatic activity. Such a high maintenance requirement may be the principal limit on the abundance of living micro-organisms in the deep, hot subsurface biosphere, as well as a potential limit on their activity. The measurement of the D/L of aspartic acid in biological samples is a potentially powerful tool for deep, fractured continental and oceanic crustal settings where geochemical models of carbon <b>turnover</b> <b>times</b> are poorly constrained. Experimental observations on the racemization rates of aspartic acid in living thermophiles and hyperthermophiles could test this hypothesis. The development of corrections for cell wall peptides and spores will be required, however, to improve the accuracy of these estimates for environmental samples...|$|R
40|$|Soils {{represent}} the largest carbon {{pool in the}} terrestrial biosphere, and climate change might affect the main carbon fluxes associated with this pool. These fluxes are the production of aboveground litter and root litter, and decomposition of the soil organic matter (SOM) pool by soil microorganisms. Knowledge about the temperature sensitivity of the decomposition of different SOM fractions is crucial {{in order to understand}} how climate change might affect carbon storage in soils. In this study, the temperature sensitivity of the <b>turnover</b> <b>times</b> of three different SOM fractions (labile, intermediate, and stabilized) was investigated for 11 forest sites along a temperature gradient. Carbon- 14 isotope analyses of the SOM fractions combined with a model provided estimates of their <b>turnover</b> <b>times.</b> The <b>turnover</b> <b>times</b> of the labile SOM fraction were not correlated with mean annual soil temperature. Therefore {{it was not possible to}} estimate temperature sensitivity for the labile SOM fraction. Given considerable evidence elsewhere for significant temperature sensitivities of labile SOM, lack of temperature sensitivity here most likely indicates limitations of the applied methodology for the labile SOM fraction. The <b>turnover</b> <b>times</b> of the intermediate and the stabilized SOM fractions were both correlated with mean annual soil temperatures. The temperature sensitivity of the stabilized SOM fraction was at least equal to that of the intermediate SOM fraction and possibly more than twice as high. A correction for confounding effects of soil acidity and clay content on the temperature sensitivities of the intermediate and stabilized SOM fractions was included in the analysis. The results as observed here for the three SOM fractions may have been influenced by (1) modeling assumptions for the estimation of SOM <b>turnover</b> <b>times</b> of leaf and needle longevities, constant annual carbon inputs, and steady-state SOM pools, (2) the occurrence of summer drought at some sites, (3) differences between sites in quality of the SOM fractions, or (4) the relatively small temperature range.
