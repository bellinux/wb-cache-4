5|$|Erie was an {{important}} shipbuilding, fishing, and railroad hub during the mid-19th century. The city was the site where three sets of track gauges met. While the delays engendered cargo troubles for commerce and travel, they provided much-needed local jobs in Erie. When a national standardized gauge was proposed, <b>those</b> <b>jobs,</b> {{and the importance of}} the rail hub itself, were put in jeopardy. In an event known as the Erie Gauge War, the citizens of Erie, led by the mayor, set fire to bridges, ripped up track and rioted to try to stop the standardization.|$|E

Time Warner's {{market share of}} the music {{industry}} had dropped almost five percent from the mid-1990s, and the new executives ordered the termination of 600 jobs. One of <b>those</b> <b>jobs</b> was Reprise Records president Howie Klein, who had been a big supporter of Wilco on the label. Klein's dismissal placed head A representative David Kahne in charge of the decision whether to release Yankee Hotel Foxtrot.|$|E
5|$|Similar {{to other}} {{industrial}} {{cities in the}} U.S., Omaha suffered severe job losses in the 1950s, more than 10,000 in total, as both the railroad and meatpacking industries restructured. Stockyards and packing plants were located closer to ranches, and union achievements were lost as wages declined in surviving jobs. Many workers left the area {{if they could get}} to other jobs. Poverty deepened in areas of the city whose residents had depended on <b>those</b> <b>jobs,</b> specifically North and South Omaha. At the same time, with reduced revenues, the city had less financial ability to respond to longstanding problems. Despair after the assassination of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. in April 1968 contributed to riots in North Omaha, including one at the Logan Fontenelle Housing Project. For some, the Civil Rights Movement in Omaha, Nebraska evolved towards black nationalism, as the Black Panther Party was involved in tensions in the late 1960s. Organizations such as the Black Association for Nationalism Through Unity became popular among the city's African-American youth. This tension culminated in the cause célèbre trial of the Rice/Poindexter Case, in which an Omaha Police Department officer was killed by a bomb while answering an emergency call.|$|E

25|$|According to the Mexican Social Security Institute, between December 2012 and June 2016, {{more than}} two million jobs were created in Mexico. Of <b>those</b> <b>jobs,</b> 41% were taken by women and 36% were taken by {{individuals}} between 20 and 34 years of age. IMSS also revealed that 86% were long-term jobs and 14% were temporary. These jobs have led to a 26% increase in revenue accumulation for IMSS, an additional MXN$50 billion. More than half a million jobs had salaries worth five minimum wages (about MXN$10,000 per month) and there was a 22% increase in jobs with salaries greater than 20 minimum wages.|$|E

Eighty-three {{percent of the}} Citizen-Leader Track cadets had a job or graduate school offer in hand upon graduation in May 2016. Recently, Northrop Grumman funded six scholarships for Citizen-Leader Track cadets or Military-Leader Track cadets not on scholarship which included an opportunity to intern with Northrop Grumman as well. Citizen-Leader Track cadets participate in an exercise called Job-Ex, where the junior and senior cadets learn to write a job description, freshman and sophomore cadets apply to <b>those</b> <b>jobs,</b> the upperclass cadets review them, and then they conduct panel interviews with the underclass cadets, so they can learn from their peers what is successful in an job interview. The upperclass cadets learn what interviewers expect, so they can improve their interviewing skills as well.

500|$|Political and {{economic}} transformation in post-Soviet Russia caused deep economic {{decline in the}} 1990s and particular financial struggles for women. Although many held jobs, women were also expected to be homemakers. Soviet working women often received extensive employment benefits, such as long child-care leaves, which pushed women {{into the role of}} housewife. In the 1990s domestic work grew increasingly demanding as acquiring goods became more time-consuming in the restructured economy. Women’s benefits also made them less attractive employees, and during privatization many companies fired women. While 90% of women were in the labor market in the 1980s, by 1991 women made up 70–80% of unemployed Russians. <b>Those</b> <b>jobs</b> available to women in the 1990s were often in low-wage sectors, and many job descriptions specified that only young, attractive women need apply.

500|$|In {{his notes}} of the Philadelphia Convention in 1787, James Madison {{expressed}} the fear that members of Congress would create new federal jobs, or increase the salaries for existing jobs, and then take <b>those</b> <b>jobs</b> for themselves. Madison wrote that corrupt legislative actions, {{in the form of}} the unnecessary creation of offices and the increase of salaries for personal benefit, were one of his greatest concerns. The delegates who were present agreed that no member of Congress should be eligible to be appointed to an executive position while serving in Congress. Madison originally proposed a one-year length on such a bar. However, Nathaniel Gorham, James Wilson, and Alexander Hamilton wanted no bar at all at the conclusion of congressional service. Eventually, Madison proposed a compromise: [...] "that no office ought to be open to a member, which may be created or augmented while he is in the legislature"; this led to extensive debate.|$|E
500|$|In 1933, H. R. Hutchinson, {{who was the}} Librarian at the Lindley Library, Royal Horticultural Society's (RHS) in London, was due to retire. John Gilmour, now {{assistant}} director at the Kew Gardens, put forward his name, together with Bowles, a Vice-president of the Society, who had discovered Stearn at the bookshop. Stearn was 22 when he began work at the library, initially as Assistant Librarian, before taking over Hutchinson's position after six months. He later explained the appointment {{at such a young}} age on World War I – [...] "All the people who should have had <b>those</b> <b>jobs</b> were dead." [...] There he collaborated with Bowles on a number of plant monographs, such as Bowles' Handbook of Crocus and their work on Anemone japonica (Anemone hupehensis var. japonica). Written in 1947, it is still considered one of the most comprehensive accounts of the origins and nomenclature of fall-blooming anemones. Stearn was one of the last people to see Bowles alive, and when Bowles died, Stearn wrote an appreciation of him, and later contributed the entry on Bowles to the Oxford Dictionary of National Biography. Much of his spare time was spent studying at the Kew Gardens.|$|E
500|$|The strike paralyzed {{the public}} {{transport}} system in Philadelphia for several days, bringing {{the city to}} a standstill and crippling its war production. Although the Transport Workers Union (TWU) {{was in favor of}} allowing promotions of black workers to any positions they were qualified for, and opposed the strike, the union was unable to persuade the white PTC employees to return to work. (However, historian James Wolfinger established that the PTC locked workers out in solidarity with the hate strikers, turning the transit depots over to them and refusing to allow union workers to resume work.) On August 3, 1944, under the provisions of the SmithConnally Act, [...] President Franklin D. Roosevelt authorized the Secretary of War Henry L. Stimson {{to take control of the}} Philadelphia Transportation Company, and Major-General Philip Hayes was put in charge of its operations. After several days of unsuccessful negotiations with the strike leaders, Hayes issued an order that the striking workers return to work on August 7, 1944, and that those refusing to comply be fired, stripped of their military draft deferment, and denied job availability certificates by the War Manpower Commission for the duration of the war. This ultimatum proved effective and on August 7 the strike ended and the strikers returned to work.

There is currently a paucity of research regarding how to assess the amount of control workers have over the job duties on which they are being measured.

This study found that on average such variability is correlated r=-. 447 with productivity improvement following a motivational intervention. The second study attempted to link perceptions of control to baseline variability and productivity improvement, but yielded inconclusive results, possibly due to a small sample size and an insufficiently long measurement period.
