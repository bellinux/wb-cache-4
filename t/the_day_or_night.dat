5|$|Nothomyrmecia and Prionomyrmex {{share similar}} {{behaviours}} with other Myrmeciinae relatives. Prionomyrmex may have foraged {{on the ground}} or onto trees and low vegetation, feeding on nectar and arthropods. Nothomyrmecia workers, however, drink hemolymph from the insects they capture, and the larvae are carnivorous. It is not known if the ants were active during <b>the</b> <b>day</b> <b>or</b> <b>night,</b> but Nothomyrmecia is a nocturnal ground forager that prefers very cold nights. Both ants have large compound eyes, relying on their vision for prey and navigational purposes. Due to their primitive and simplified social life, workers of both genera do not recruit others to food sources or leave down trail pheromones, suggesting that both these ants are solitary foragers. Prionomyrmex ants were hosts to female stylopid parasites. Predators are unknown for both ants.|$|E
5|$|Approximately {{three-quarters of}} all extant strepsirrhine species are nocturnal, {{sleeping}} in nests made from dead leaves or tree hollows during the day. All of the lorisoids from continental Africa and Asia are nocturnal, a circumstance that minimizes their {{competition with the}} simian primates of the region, which are diurnal. The lemurs of Madagascar, living {{in the absence of}} simians, are more variable in their activity cycles. The aye-aye, mouse lemurs, woolly lemurs, and sportive lemurs are nocturnal, while ring-tailed lemurs and most of their kin, sifakas, and indri are diurnal. Yet {{some or all of the}} brown lemurs (Eulemur) are cathemeral, which means that they may be active during <b>the</b> <b>day</b> <b>or</b> <b>night,</b> depending on factors such as temperature and predation. Many extant strepsirrhines are well adapted for nocturnal activity due to their relatively large eyes; large, movable ears; sensitive tactile hairs; strong sense of smell; and the tapetum lucidum behind the retina. Among the adapiforms, most are considered diurnal, with the exception of Pronycticebus and Godinotia from Middle Eocene Europe, both of which had large orbits that suggest nocturnality.|$|E
5|$|Fish {{and other}} aquatic prey {{taken in the}} water or at the water's edge form the major part of American alligator's diet and may be eaten {{at any time of}} <b>the</b> <b>day</b> <b>or</b> <b>night.</b> Adult American {{alligators}} also spend considerable time hunting on land, up to 50m (170ft) from water, ambushing terrestrial animals on trailsides and road shoulders. Usually, terrestrial hunting occurs on nights with warm temperatures. When hunting terrestrial prey, American alligators may also ambush them {{from the edge of the}} water by grabbing them and pulling the prey into the water, the preferred method of predation of larger crocodiles. The teeth of the American alligator are designed to grip prey, but can not rip or chew flesh like teeth of some other predators (such as canids and felids), and depend on their gizzard instead to masticate their food. The American alligator is capable of biting though a turtle's shell or a moderately sized mammal bone. Additionally, American alligators have recently been filmed and documented killing and eating sharks and rays; four incidents documented indicated that bonnetheads, lemon sharks, Atlantic stingrays and nurse sharks are components of the animal's diet. Sharks are also known to prey on American alligators in turn, indicating encounters between the two predators are more common than thought.|$|E

25|$|A {{black bear}} has better {{eyesight}} {{and a better}} sense of hearing compared to humans. Their keenest sense is the sense of smell, which is about seven times greater than a dog's. Black bears are excellent and strong swimmers, doing so for pleasure and to feed (largely on fish). They regularly climb trees to feed, escape enemies, and hibernate. Half of bear species are habitually arboreal (the most arboreal species, the American and Asian black bears and the sun bear, being fairly closely related). Their arboreal abilities tend to decline with age. Black bears may be active at any time of <b>the</b> <b>day</b> <b>or</b> <b>night</b> although they mainly forage by night. Bears living near human habitations tend to be more extensively nocturnal, and bears living near brown bears tend to be more extensively diurnal. Their social behavior is somewhat similar to that of canids.|$|E

Its most-recognised sound is its alarm call which is a rapid chit-chit-chit-chit, although it has more melodious sounds in its repertoire.

However, he would play his prized heavy metal records very loudly at any time of <b>the</b> <b>day</b> <b>or</b> <b>night</b> and take LSD with casual indifference. Hurley attempted to calm Friday down by moving him into an apartment above the football club's elderly ex-groundsman, but to no avail: [...] "Even if it was three in the morning, the first thing would be to get the music playing", Simmonds later said. [...] "We had an old boy living below us ... the ex-groundsman at Reading. He was coming up to 80 and he had a dog's life in the flat.

[...] The requirements or conditions may include mandatory programs such as a drug or alcohol treatment seminars, curfews, house arrest, or electronic monitoring. [...] Most offenders who receive conditional sentences are low risk and are usually serving time for impaired driving where no death occurred. When an offender receives a conditional sentence of home confinement in comparison to incarceration, the offender is still able to see family members, maintain a normal job, and attend school. This is a huge advantage to conditional sentencing, since offenders are not completely cut off from the external world. [...] Although the offender is not locked away in a prison cell, the offender is still expected to stay at home during certain times of <b>the</b> <b>day</b> <b>or</b> <b>night.</b> [...] In order to verify that offenders are abiding by the restrictions placed on them, electronic monitoring is often used. The development of GPS, which allows law enforcement agencies to know the exact location of the offender by the use of satellites, has increased the effectiveness of offenders serving home confinement sentences drastically. Offenders can now easily be identified and tracked down through the use of GPS allowing law enforcement officers to quickly move in to make an arrest when an offender is in breach of their conditions.|$|E
2500|$|Alfred Richardson duly {{started his}} duties at Newcastle-under-Lyme Police Station on 2 September 1901. The Force size {{for the town}} was 18 men. His new {{telephone}} number was '9'. Within a few days there was a ceremony at the Town Hall and Square for the Mayor and the town dignitaries and local citizens to meet their new Chief Constable, which he attended in his Number One uniform. This showed the Chief Constable's badge of rank, worn on the epaulettes, which consisted of crossed tipstaves in a wreath, surmounted by a crown, similar to the insignia of a Lieutenant General in the British Army. The population of the town was about 20,000 people and it was heavily industrialized. The conditions for his men were, [...] "All Officers had to wear helmets for all duties and keep Truncheons. Constables would work twelve hours a day, seven days a week. There would be two shifts, one day and one night." [...] There were no meal breaks. A beat system was such that a Constable {{was taken to the}} start of his beat on foot by a superior. Constables worked on 'shifts', which meant they spent about six or seven hours during <b>the</b> <b>day</b> <b>or</b> <b>night</b> at their work. Some weeks they did 'nights', others they did 'evenings', others did 'days'. At this period they worked seven days a week with no rest days, which was to become a factor in Richardson's next appointment. As he had in Birmingham previously, the new Chief Constable now appeared by name regularly in the local newspaper in court cases. In these cases Alfred Richardson was the prosecutor, a role he was to continue in his next post. At this time, and later, the Borough had an ongoing problem with smallpox which added to police work with contagion. Newcastle-under-Lyme Fire Service worked, as all fire services did, in conjunction with the local police force, but it was an entirely separate unit.
