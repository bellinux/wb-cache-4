5|$|The {{boys and}} the backpackers visit a water park, where Jay intends to find his ex-girlfriend, Jane. The park staff tell Jay that Jane has found a new job in the vast Outback, which leaves Jay feeling very dejected. Lucy tells Simon via Skype that Jane {{is working on a}} stud farm in the remote {{settlement}} of Birdsville, and the boys intend to drive there. Their car runs out of petrol {{in the middle of the}} desert. The group hold hands together as they realise that they will most likely die, but are rescued by Jane and her co-workers. She realises how far Jay came to win her over again, and although she is touched by the gesture, she does not take him back. Back at Jay's uncle's house, the boys find that <b>their</b> <b>parents</b> <b>have</b> travelled to find them after hearing of their near-death experience. The boys are shocked to find Mr Gilbert (their old head of sixth form and Will's nemesis) there too, and Will's mother announces that she and Gilbert are in a relationship, to the abject horror of Will and amusement of the other three friends. Over Skype, Lucy breaks-up with Simon because she is now in a relationship with his university 'best friend' Pete, which Simon responds to by cheering and abruptly hanging-up on her.|$|E

500|$|Due to its {{tone and}} subject matter, it is {{considered}} one of the band's darker songs, alongside [...] "Adam's Song", their 2000 single revolving around suicide. Hoppus told an interviewer at the time of the album's release that [...] "There's always a song or two where we really try to really push ourselves [...] On this new record I think we've done a lot of different stuff that people wouldn't ever expect from us. [...] On the new one, it's 'Stay Together for the Kids.'" [...] DeLonge later confirmed he had received emails from fans thanking him for the song's message. [...] "With [...] "Stay Together", we get emails—just kid after kid after kid—saying, 'I know exactly what you're talking about! That song is about my life!'" [...] In 2002, divorce statistics were four times higher than their average just over thirty years prior, with over 50 percent of marriages ending in divorce. [...] "You look at statistics that 50 percent of parents get divorced, and you’re going to get a pretty large group of kids who are pissed off and who don’t agree with what <b>their</b> <b>parents</b> <b>have</b> done," [...] said DeLonge. [...] "Stay Together" [...] was the final song completed during the recording sessions; it was created one day before the album was handed off to the mixing engineer.|$|E
500|$|When Fenmore {{and female}} {{character}} Summer Newman (Hunter King) were rapidly aged to teenagers {{at the same}} time, Deanna Barnert of MSN Entertainment previewed: [...] "These two kids may learn {{about some of the}} insane things <b>their</b> <b>parents</b> <b>have</b> done – as fans know, that says a lot!" [...] She also wrote that given who their parents are, [...] "that can only mean trouble". Fenmore has dated Summer, to which Ehrich stated: [...] "Everything he does is for his love for Summer. He has this obsession with her. Every action he does stems from that." [...] In another interview, he stated of their relationship: [...] "I think Fen’s first love is Summer; he falls in love; he’s infatuated with her. She plays games with him, and where it’s going is – will Fen get into her ways, or will he stand his ground? Everything Fenmore does is coming from his love for Summer, so he’s still the same kid, it’s just sometimes love makes you do some crazy thing Fenmore later began to enter a rebellious phase." [...] Tracey Bregman (who portrays his mother Lauren) stated that she [...] "was always hoping they would show the dark side of our child, because both Lauren and Michael have dark sides. That is something they both work hard on to suppress, that comes out now and them." [...] Christian LeBlanc (who portrays his father Michael) stated Michael has [...] "troubled youth to deal with", saying: [...] "It’s the first time on Y that such a young storyline has pulled such focus. It’s going to be really fascinating. The whole family gets drawn in. The trouble with Fenmore affects Lauren and Michael. [...] rippling effect, like every good story." [...] The character was later involved in a cyberbullying storyline with Summer and Jamie Vernon (Daniel Polo). Michael Logan of TV Guide previewed the storyline, writing: [...] "Adding fuel to the fire is young Fen Baldwin (Max Ehrich), who is so infatuated with Summer that he becomes her partner in crime — in fact, he takes things a few dangerous steps further once he sees Summer's growing fondness for Jamie." [...] Ehrich liked the plot as he was bullied as a child, stating: [...] "Kids do it out of their own sadness or insecurity, but needless to say that doesn’t matter when you’re a victim of it - you feel so isolated and so alone. To have a storyline that addresses it, it’s like, [...] "This is real; this is what happens". People need to know the truth {{of what is going on}} out there." ...|$|E

2500|$|In {{a debate}} during the 2010 campaign, O'Malley {{referred}} to undocumented immigrants as [...] "new Americans" [...] while endorsing stricter enforcement against undocumented immigration {{by the federal}} government. In May 2011, he signed a law making the children of undocumented immigrants eligible for in-state college tuition under certain conditions. The law provides that undocumented immigrants can be eligible for in-state tuition if they have attended {{a high school in}} Maryland for three years, and if they or <b>their</b> <b>parents</b> <b>have</b> paid state income taxes during that time. In response, Delegate Neil Parrott created an online petition to suspend the law pending a referendum to be voted on in the 2012 general election. On November 6, 2012, a majority (58%) of state voters passed referendum Question 4 in support of the law O'Malley had signed.|$|E
2500|$|Oftentimes {{divorce is}} viewed as {{detrimental}} to one’s emotional health, but {{studies have shown that}} cultivating resilience may be beneficial to all parties involved. The level of resilience a child will experience after <b>their</b> <b>parents</b> <b>have</b> split is dependent on both internal and external variables. Some of these variables include their psychological and physical state and the level of support they receive from their schools, friends, and family friends. The ability to deal with these situations also stems from the child’s age, gender, and temperament. Children will experience divorce differently and thus their ability to cope with divorce will differ too. About 20–25% of children will “demonstrate severe emotional and behavioral problems” when going through a divorce. This percentage is notably higher than the 10% of children exhibiting similar problems in married families. Despite having divorces parents of approximately 75–80% of these children will [...] "develop into well-adjusted adults with no lasting psychological or behavioral problems". This comes to show that most children have the tools necessary to allow them to exhibit the resilience needed to overcome their parents’ divorce.|$|E
2500|$|Autism is {{classified}} by psychologists as a disorder, {{rather than the}} variation in functioning preferred by supporters of neurodiversity, with an attendant focus on the burden placed on society in caring for autistic individuals. Caring for autistic individuals {{has been compared to}} treating a patient with cancer, though extended over the duration of a normal lifespan. Autistic children have also been described as being held hostage to a psychiatric disorder. [...] Others have used the term [...] "mad child disease" [...] to describe autism, which some autistic individuals and <b>their</b> <b>parents</b> <b>have</b> found highly offensive. Margaret Somerville, founding director of the McGill Centre for Medicine, Ethics and Law, said that with activism there is a direct goal and it is sometimes necessary to sacrifice complexity and nuance to make a point, but some autistic activists don't believe desperation justifies the rhetoric. Bennett L. Leventhal said he understands concern about comparing autistic children to hostages but thinks the campaigns make the point that these are real diseases that will consume children if untreated. Autistic rights activists also reject terming the reported increase in autism diagnoses as an 'epidemic' since the word implies autism is a disease.|$|E

30|$|The first-generation {{immigrants}} {{group is}} the most important for our purposes, as it is the most immediately affected by changes in migration policies. All children included in this category in the PISA 2009 sample were born abroad, and almost all of them just before the new migration policy was implemented. 5 This means that <b>their</b> <b>parents</b> <b>had</b> migrated to Switzerland after the new policy was put in place, whereas almost 6 all comparable first-generation immigrant students tested in 2000 were from <b>parents</b> that <b>had</b> migrated under the old regime. Conversely, {{in the case of the}} children from the second-generation group (children born in Switzerland), it is almost certain that <b>their</b> <b>parents</b> <b>had</b> migrated to Switzerland under the old policy regime even in the case of the PISA 2009 test group.|$|R

'The Princess Pimminy was taken a drive, attended by her ladies of honour, and accompanied by her doll,' &c. We laugh at the solemnity with which Saint Simon announces that SA MAJESTE SE MEDICAMENTE AUJOURD'HUI. Under our very noses the same folly is daily going on. That wonderful and mysterious man, the author of the COURT CIRCULAR, drops in with his budget at the newspaper offices every night.

60|$|Again; {{some men}} {{think that because}} <b>their</b> <b>parents</b> <b>have</b> been {{religious}} before them, and have been indeed the people of God, they think if they also do as to the outward observing of that which they learned from their forerunners, that therefore God doth accept them; but this also is from a wrong spirit; and yet how many are there in England at this day that think the better of themselves merely upon that account; ay, and think the people of God ought to think so too, not understanding that it is ordinary for an Eli to have a Hophni and a Phinehas, both sons of Belial; also a good Samuel to have a perverse offspring; likewise David an Absalom. I say, their being ignorant of, or else negligent in regarding this, they do think that because they do spring from such and such, as the Jews in their generation did, that therefore they have a privilege with God more than others, {{when there is no}} such thing; but for certain, if the same faith be not in them which was in their forerunners, to lay hold of the Christ of God in the same spirit as they did, they must utterly perish, for all their high conceits that they have of themselves (John 8:33-35; Matt 3:7-9).|$|E

It is astounding, therefore, that in a country which possesses an Established Church, richly endowed universities, and even several professors of education, no book exists which can be put {{into the hands of}} every intelligent youth, and of every intelligent father and mother, showing what our wisest and best men believe are the best things which can be done in life, and what is the kind of training which makes the doing of these things most easy. It is often said that each of us can profit only by his own experience, but no one believes that. No one can see how many well-meaning persons mistake means for ends and drift into error and sin, simply because neither they nor <b>their</b> <b>parents</b> <b>have</b> known what course should be steered, and what equipment is needed, in the voyage of life,--no one can see this and doubt that a 'guidebook to life,' containing the results of the comparison of the experiences of even half-a-dozen able and sincere men, would save countless people from wasting their lives as most lives are now wasted.|$|E

But here, although we are soldiers of France, we are as strangers in the land. Here in Paris we have many acquaintances, and a welcome at most of the receptions; but that is the end of it. It is seldom, indeed, that we are invited into the country houses of those we know. That sort of hospitality is not the fashion in France. Here, nobles may throw open their houses to all gentlemen by birth who happen to be presented to them, but at home they are rigidly exclusive; and, moreover, I am inclined to think they regard us Irishmen as detrimental and dangerous. Many Irishmen make exceedingly good matches, and we are regarded as having a way with us, with the girls, that is likely to interfere with the arrangements <b>their</b> <b>parents</b> <b>have</b> made for their marriages. Now, {{it seems to me that}} your baron must be a very confiding old gentleman, or he would never take you to stay in the society of the young lady who owes so much to you.

[...] Ah! my friends, if we offered that sacrifice oftener, we should have more seldom need to offer the first sacrifice of repentance. I am astonished when I look at my own heart, by which alone I can judge the hearts of others, to see how unthankful one is. How one takes as a matter of course, without one aspiration of gratitude to our Father in heaven--how one takes, as a matter of course, I say, life, health, reason, freedom, education, comfort, safety, and all the blessings of humanity, and of this favoured land. How we never really feel that these are all God's undeserved and unearned mercies; and then, how, if we set our hearts on anything which we have not got, forget all that we have already, and begin entreating God to give us something which, if we had, we know not whether {{it would be good for}} us; like children crying peevishly for sweets, after <b>their</b> <b>parents</b> <b>have</b> given them all the wholesome food they need. Ah! that we would offer to God more frankly the sacrifice of thanksgiving! So we should do God justice, by confessing all we owe to Him; and so, we must believe, we should please God; for if God be indeed our Father in heaven, as surely as a parent is pleased with the affection and gratitude of his child, so will our Father in heaven be pleased when He sees us love Him, who first loved us.|$|E
