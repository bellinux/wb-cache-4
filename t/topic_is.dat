5|$|A {{subfield}} of {{the sociology}} of health and illness that overlaps with cultural sociology {{is the study of}} death, dying and bereavement, sometimes referred to broadly as {{the sociology of}} death. This <b>topic</b> <b>is</b> exemplifed by the work of Douglas Davies and Michael C. Kearl.|$|E
5|$|Another <b>topic</b> <b>is</b> the {{relationship}} between brain structures and language acquisition. Research in first language acquisition has already established that infants from all linguistic environments go through similar and predictable stages (such as babbling), and some neurolinguistics research attempts to find correlations between stages of language development and stages of brain development, while other research investigates the physical changes (known as neuroplasticity) that the brain undergoes during second language acquisition, when adults learn a new language.|$|E
5|$|The text of {{the short}} work was written by Georg Christian Lehms, for two arias and a {{connecting}} recitative. The <b>topic</b> <b>is</b> to resist sin, based on the Epistle of James. The text was published in a 1711 collection, dedicated to the Sunday Oculi. It is not known when Bach composed the work but is assumed that he performed {{it as part of}} his monthly cantata productions in 1714 on the seventh Sunday after Trinity, 15 July. The solo voice is accompanied by strings: two violin parts, two viola parts and continuo. The composition begins with a striking dissonant chord.|$|E

5|$|While English is a subject-prominent language, at the {{discourse}} level {{it tends to}} use a topic-comment structure, where the known information (topic) precedes the new information (comment). Because of the strict SVO syntax, the topic of a sentence generally {{has to be the}} grammatical subject of the sentence. In cases where the <b>topic</b> <b>is</b> not the grammatical subject of the sentence, frequently the <b>topic</b> <b>is</b> promoted to subject position through syntactic means. One way of doing this is through a passive construction, the girl was stung by the bee. Another way is through a cleft sentence where the main clause is demoted to be a complement clause of a copula sentence with a dummy subject such as it or there, e.g. it was the girl that the bee stung, there was a girl who was stung by a bee. Dummy subjects are also used in constructions where there is no grammatical subject such as with impersonal verbs (e.g., it is raining) or in existential clauses (there are many cars on the street). Through the use of these complex sentence constructions with informationally vacuous subjects, English is able to maintain both a topic-comment sentence structure and a SVO syntax.|$|E
5|$|Analysis of her visions is {{problematic}} since {{the main source}} of information on this <b>topic</b> <b>is</b> the condemnation trial transcript in which she defied customary courtroom procedure about a witness' oath and specifically refused to answer every question about her visions. She complained that a standard witness oath would conflict with an oath she had previously sworn to maintain confidentiality about meetings with her king. It remains unknown to what extent the surviving record may represent the fabrications of corrupt court officials or her own possible fabrications to protect state secrets. Some historians sidestep speculation about the visions by asserting that her belief in her calling is more relevant than questions about the visions' ultimate origin.|$|E
5|$|Common to all {{crimes against}} {{the person is}} the {{infringement}} {{of the right to}} bodily integrity. It extends to the touching of clothing, for example, and where no physical harm actually results. However, if all touchings were criminalised, this would interfere with the right to liberty. It is the very touching, and not the harm, that is the violation of principle. This is related to the right to privacy under Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights. The central statute on this <b>topic</b> <b>is</b> Offences against the Person Act 1861, which brought together a multitude of difference offences, with much overlap and inconsistent terminology. These include both the actual infliction and the threat of violence. Although criticised, the Act has not been replaced.|$|E
30|$|A {{correlated}} <b>topic</b> model (CTM) <b>is</b> {{proposed in}} Blei and Lafferty (2007). As in the above-mentioned hierarchical topic models, the <b>topics</b> <b>are</b> not independent in the CTM, but only pairwise correlations among <b>topics</b> <b>are</b> modeled by a logistic normal distribution.|$|R
40|$|Researchers {{have used}} topic {{modeling}} and concept location {{to understand the}} latent topics of software development artifacts.

5|$|From its inception, users {{would use}} the {{newsgroup}} to discuss {{the quality of the}} episode, as well as to talk about continuity errors and trivia. They would also discuss cultural references, usually related to pop culture. Another common <b>topic</b> <b>is</b> freeze frame gags, which are jokes that can only be seen when the viewer tapes the episode and freezes the image. All of these many discussions were compiled and submitted to The Simpsons Archive, which contains at least 330 episode guides as well as other guides. The newsgroup also provides The Simpsons Archive with information on the characters and the setting, as well as a compilation of articles about the show and interview with its cast and crew.|$|E
5|$|Tanasescu {{explores the}} idea of rights for nature, an idea which, though unorthodox, has seen success in implementation. He first {{introduces}} the concept, {{with a focus on}} the differences between moral and legal rights, before examining the particular case of Ecuador's entrenchment of rights for nature in its 2008 constitution, which is compared with other real-world cases. He finally addresses what can be learnt from these theoretical and practical considerations. He concludes that much work on the <b>topic</b> <b>is</b> left to be done, but the key lesson to be learnt is the significance of innovation; environmental politics, he claims, should remain both inventive and optimistic.

5|$|The changes seen {{in series}} VII were {{seen by some}} as a disappointment; while much slicker and higher-budget in appearance, the shift away from {{outright}} sitcom and into something approaching comedy drama was seen as a move in the wrong direction. Furthermore, the attempt to shift back into traditional sitcom format for series VIII was greeted with a response that was similarly lukewarm. There was criticism aimed at the decision to resurrect the entire crew of Red Dwarf, as it was felt this detracted from the series' central premise of Lister being the last human being alive. There are other critics who feel that series VII and VIII are no weaker than the earlier series, however, and the <b>topic</b> <b>is</b> the subject of constant fervent debate among the show's fanbase.|$|E

50|$|In {{traditional}} BBS, the <b>topics</b> <b>are</b> usually broadly covered, {{which may}} contain {{a wide range}} of information.

5|$|The {{decline in}} {{amphibian}} populations {{is an ongoing}} mass extinction of amphibian species worldwide. Since the 1980s, decreases in amphibian populations, including population crashes and mass localized extinctions, have been observed in locations all over the world. These declines are {{known as one of}} the most critical threats to global biodiversity, and several causes are believed to be involved, including disease, habitat destruction and modification, exploitation, pollution, pesticide use, introduced species, and ultraviolet-B radiation (UV-B). However, many of the causes of amphibian declines are still poorly understood, and the <b>topic</b> <b>is</b> currently a subject of much ongoing research. Calculations based on extinction rates suggest that the current extinction rate of amphibians could be 211 times greater than the background extinction rate and the estimate goes up to 25,000–45,000 times if endangered species are also included in the computation.|$|E
