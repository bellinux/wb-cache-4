40|$|MCur, North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2015 The {{prevalence}} of learner <b>teenage</b> <b>pregnancies</b> is a winnable battle, provided the major stakeholders, namely the Departments of Education (DoE) and Health (DoH) provide joint positive efforts. The situation requires continuous effective {{support to the}} teachers that have to handle the situation of <b>teenage</b> <b>pregnancies</b> at secondary schools. In spite of the implementation of Life Orientation as a school subject, to deals with sexual behaviour, sexual health, decision making regarding sexuality, risk of pregnancy, sexually transmitted infections, including HIV and Aids the {{prevalence of}} learner <b>teenage</b> <b>pregnancies</b> at secondary schools remains high. Health care professionals should become involved by promoting and implementing preventive measures to reduce the increase in learner <b>teenage</b> <b>pregnancies</b> {{in collaboration with the}} DoE. This will achieve a situation where there is assistance and support for vulnerable learners, and teachers that are daily exposed to learner pregnancies, as well as deliveries of babies on school premises. The intervention of health care professionals will provide quality care to learners and continuous support for teachers in all provinces, not only KwaZulu-Natal (KZN). The objective {{of this study is to}} explore and describe the teachers‟ experiences regarding learner <b>teenage</b> <b>pregnancies</b> in KZN. The study is explorative, descriptive and contextual in nature. An interpretative approach was suitable to address the research aim of this qualitative research design, namely to answer the research question: “How do secondary school teachers experience <b>teenage</b> <b>pregnancies</b> and unexpected deliveries at school?” Participants were selected by purposeful sampling strategy. Data were collected through individual interviews and the data analysis followed Tesch‟s (1990) method of systematic open coding. During the data analysis themes were identified, including for instance the overall experiences with learner <b>teenage</b> <b>pregnancies,</b> experiences related to unexpected deliveries at school and recommendations to cope with <b>teenage</b> <b>pregnancies</b> and unexpected deliveries at school. The participants were all aware of the negative consequences of learner <b>teenage</b> <b>pregnancies,</b> which include leaving school, the resulting unemployability of learners who left school early and subsequent poverty and low social economic status. Recommendations aimed at stakeholders such as the DoE and Health centre on jointly supporting secondary school teachers with respect to their experiences with learner <b>teenage</b> <b>pregnancies</b> and unexpected deliveries at school. Health professionals are requested to implement campaigns and school visits to supply contraceptive services, whereas the DoE has to emphasise and ensure that teachers understand the importance of contemporary approaches when implementing the Life Orientation curriculum that explicity deals with sexuality, sexual behaviour, sexual health, decision making regarding sexuality, risk of pregnancy, sexually transmitted infections including HIV and Aids.

40|$|Objectives. We {{estimated}} {{the effects of}} high incarceration rates on rates of sexually transmitted infections and <b>teenage</b> <b>pregnancies.</b> Methods. We calculated correlations between rates of incarceration in state prisons and county jails and rates of sexually transmitted infections and <b>teenage</b> <b>pregnancies</b> {{for each of the}} 100 counties in North Carolina during 1995 to 2002. We also estimated increases in negative health outcomes associated with increases in incarceration rates using negative binomial regression analyses. Results. Rates of sexually transmitted infections and <b>teenage</b> <b>pregnancies,</b> adjusted for age, race, and poverty distributions by county, consistently increased with increasing incarceration rates. In the most extreme case, <b>teenage</b> <b>pregnancies</b> exhibited an increase of 71. 61 per 100000 population (95 % confidence interval [CI]= 41. 88, 101. 35) in 1996 after an increase in the prison population rate from 223. 31 to 468. 58 per 100 000 population in 1995. Conclusions. High rates of incarceration can have the unintended consequence of destabilizing communities and contributing to adverse health outcomes...|$|R

5|$|Abstinence-only sex {{education}} does not reduce <b>teenage</b> <b>pregnancy.</b> Teen pregnancy rates are higher in students given abstinence-only education, {{as compared with}} comprehensive {{sex education}}. Some authorities recommend that those using abstinence as a primary method have backup method(s) available (such as condoms or emergency contraceptive pills). Deliberate non-penetrative sex without vaginal sex or deliberate oral sex without vaginal sex are also sometimes considered birth control. While this generally avoids pregnancy, pregnancy can still occur with intercrural sex {{and other forms of}} penis-near-vagina sex (genital rubbing, and the penis exiting from anal intercourse) where sperm can be deposited near the entrance to the vagina and can travel along the vagina's lubricating fluids.|$|E

Mansour remained director of DSS until 1987.

The most deleterious risk factors were poor diet, tobacco smoking, obesity, high blood pressure, high blood sugar, physical inactivity, and alcohol use. Alzheimer's disease, drug abuse, kidney disease, cancer, and falls caused the most additional years of life lost over their age-adjusted 1990 per-capita rates.

In the 2000s and 2010s, the show dealt with controversial issues such as homosexuality, gambling, prostitution, surrogacy, and exotic dancing. Health issues were also focused on, including multiple sclerosis, bipolar disorder, epilepsy, amnesia, congenital diaphragmatic hernia, and alzheimer's disease.

In 2013, the average age at first birth was 26 and 40.6% of births were to unmarried women.|$|E
5|$|In teenagers, pregnancies are {{at greater}} risk of poor outcomes. Comprehensive sex {{education}} and access to birth control decreases the rate of unwanted pregnancies in this age group. While all forms of birth control can generally be used by young people, long-acting reversible birth control such as implants, IUDs, or vaginal rings are more successful in reducing rates of <b>teenage</b> <b>pregnancy.</b> After the delivery of a child, a woman who is not exclusively breastfeeding may become pregnant again after as few as four to six weeks. Some methods of birth control can be started immediately following the birth, while others require a delay of up to six months. In women who are breastfeeding, progestin-only methods are preferred over combined oral birth control pills. In women who have reached menopause, it is recommended that birth control be continued for one year after the last period.|$|E

5|$|Of {{near miss}} events, {{obstetrical}} fistulae (OF), including vesicovaginal and rectovaginal fistulae, remain {{one of the}} most serious and tragic. Although corrective surgery is possible it is often not available and OF is considered completely preventable. If repaired, subsequent pregnancies will require cesarian section. While unusual in developed countries, it is estimated that up to 100,000 cases occur every year in the world, and that about 2 million women are currently living with this condition, with the highest incidence occurring in Africa and parts of Asia. OF results from prolonged obstructed labor without intervention, when continued pressure from the fetus in the birth canal restricts blood supply to the surrounding tissues, with eventual fetal death, necrosis and expulsion. The damaged pelvic organs then develop a connection (fistula) allowing urine or feces, or both, to be discharged through the vagina with associated urinary and fecal incontinence, vaginal stenosis, nerve damage and infertility. Severe social and mental consequences are also likely to follow, with shunning of the women. Aprt from lack of access to care, causes include young age, and malnourishment. The UNFPA has made prevention of OF a priority and is the lead agency in the Campaign to End Fistula, which issues annual reports and the United Nations observes May 23 as the International Day to End Obstetric Fistula every year. Prevention includes discouraging <b>teenage</b> <b>pregnancy</b> and child marriage, adeaquate nutrition, and access to skilled care, including caesarian section.|$|E
