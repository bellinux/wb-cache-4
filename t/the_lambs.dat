5|$|The Silence of <b>the</b> <b>Lambs,</b> a film {{adaptation}} of Harris' next Lecter novel, {{was released in}} 1991. However, none of the cast of Manhunter reprise their roles in the later film, although actors Frankie Faison and Dan Butler appear in both films as different and unrelated characters. The Silence of <b>the</b> <b>Lambs</b> earned several awards and accolades, including the Academy Award for Best Picture. It {{is one of only}} three films to have won the Academy Awards for Best Picture, Best Director, Best Actor and Actress, and Best Screenplay. The Silence of <b>the</b> <b>Lambs</b> was followed in turn by a sequel and two prequels: Hannibal, Red Dragon and Hannibal Rising, plus an NBC television series, Hannibal.|$|E

5|$|Hannibal is a 2001 American {{psychological}} horror film {{directed by}} Ridley Scott, {{adapted from the}} novel {{of the same name}} by Thomas Harris. It is the sequel to the 1991 Academy Award–winning film The Silence of <b>the</b> <b>Lambs</b> in which Anthony Hopkins returns to his role as the iconic serial killer, Hannibal Lecter. Julianne Moore co-stars, in the role first held by Jodie Foster, as FBI Special Agent Clarice Starling.|$|E
5|$|Set {{ten years}} after The Silence of <b>the</b> <b>Lambs,</b> Hannibal follows Starling's {{attempts}} to apprehend Lecter before his surviving victim, Mason Verger, captures him. It is set in Italy and the United States. The novel Hannibal drew attention for its violence. Hannibal broke box office records in the United States, Australia, Canada and the United Kingdom in February 2001, but was met with a mixed critical reception.|$|E
50|$|Then {{takes place}} the {{elaborate}} rite of the choosing of the Lamb: while the congregation sing 41 times the Kyrie eleison, the priest checks {{the wine and}} chooses among the bread one loaf which will be consecrated (<b>the</b> <b>Lamb).</b> <b>The</b> <b>Lamb</b> is cleaned with a napkin and blessed with the priest's thumb wet of wine. Afterwards the priest takes <b>the</b> <b>Lamb</b> in procession around the altar and the deacon follows with the wine and a candle. At the altar, the priest, with appropriate prayers, blesses <b>the</b> <b>Lamb</b> and <b>the</b> wine, places <b>the</b> <b>Lamb</b> in <b>the</b> Paten and pours wine and a few water in the chalice (the chalice is stowed into a wooden box named ark on the altar).|$|R

5|$|Despite the {{low gross}} on its initial release, Manhunter grew in {{popularity}} by the 2000s {{and has been}} mentioned in several books and lists of cult films. These reappraisals often cite the success of Silence of <b>the</b> <b>Lambs</b> and its sequels {{as the reason for}} the increased interest in Manhunter, while still favoring the earlier film over its successors. Telling of this resurgence in appreciation are the film's ratings on review aggregation sites such as Metacritic or Rotten Tomatoes. Compiled mostly from reviews written decades after its original release, Manhunter has a metascore of 78 on Metacritic, based on ten reviews, and a 94% fresh rating on Rotten Tomatoes, from 33 reviews.|$|E
5|$|In 1892, his {{grandmother}} Louisa Drew's business began to suffer, and she {{lost control of}} her theater, causing disruption in the family. The following year, when Barrymore was 11 years old, his mother died from tuberculosis; her consistent touring and his absence at school meant that he barely knew her, and he was mostly raised by {{his grandmother}}. The loss of their mother's income prompted both Ethel and Lionel to seek work as professional actors. Barrymore's father was mostly absent from the family home while on tour, and when he returned he would spend time at <b>The</b> <b>Lambs,</b> a New York actors' club.|$|E
5|$|Red foxes may on {{occasions}} prey on lambs. Usually, lambs {{targeted by}} foxes {{tend to be}} physically weakened specimens, but not invariably. Lambs belonging to small breeds, such as Blackface, are more vulnerable than larger breeds such as Merino. Twins may be more vulnerable to foxes than singlets, as ewes cannot effectively defend both simultaneously. Crossbreeding small, upland ewes with larger, lowland rams can cause difficult and prolonged labour for ewes due to the heaviness of the resulting offspring, thus making <b>the</b> <b>lambs</b> more at risk to fox predation. Lambs born from gimmers (ewes breeding for the first time) are more often killed by foxes than those of experienced mothers, who stick closer to their young.|$|E

One day, they were playing a counting-out game in a meadow by a pool, and their stepmother turned the boy into a fish and the girl into a lamb. Then guests came, and the stepmother ordered the cook to serve <b>the</b> <b>lamb.</b> <b>The</b> <b>lamb</b> and fish lamented their fates to each other, and the cook served another animal and gave <b>the</b> <b>lamb</b> to a good peasant woman, {{who had been the}} girl's nurse. She suspected who <b>the</b> <b>lamb</b> was, and brought her to a wise woman.

5|$|The {{concept for}} The Texas Chain Saw Massacre {{arose in the}} early 1970s while Tobe Hooper was working as an {{assistant}} film director at the University of Texas at Austin and as a documentary cameraman. He had already developed a story involving the elements of isolation, the woods, and darkness. He credited the graphic coverage of violence by San Antonio news outlets as one inspiration for the film and based elements of the plot on serial killer Ed Gein in 1950s Wisconsin; Gein inspired other horror films such as Psycho (1960) and The Silence of <b>the</b> <b>Lambs</b> (1991). During development, Hooper used the working titles of Headcheese and Leatherface.|$|E
5|$|The dump months {{evolved over}} the course of the 20th century. Although during the studio era most major {{releases}} followed annual patterns similar to today's, several classics like The Kid, Shadow of a Doubt and The Treasure of the Sierra Madre were released during January. Since the decline of the studios, however, memorable films from the dump months have become rare exceptions. The most notable is The Silence of <b>the</b> <b>Lambs,</b> a well-reviewed box office smash released in late January 1991 that went on to win that year's Academy Award for Best Picture. Several years before that, Dirty Dancing and Fatal Attraction became hits following releases in August and September respectively.|$|E
5|$|The film had a {{difficult}} and occasionally troubling pre-production history. When the novel was published in 1999, The Silence of <b>the</b> <b>Lambs</b> director Jonathan Demme, screenwriter Ted Tally, and actress Jodie Foster all declined {{to be involved in}} its adaptation. Ridley Scott became attached as director after the success of Gladiator (2000), and eventually signed onto the project after reading the script pitched by Dino De Laurentiis, who produced Manhunter (1986), based on the 1981 Harris novel Red Dragon. After the departure of Foster and screenwriter Tally, Julianne Moore took on Foster's role while David Mamet and Steven Zaillian wrote the screenplay.|$|E

50|$|In his book, <b>The</b> Vegetable <b>Lamb</b> of Tartary (1887), Henry Lee {{describes}} <b>the</b> legendary <b>lamb</b> as {{believed to}} be both a true animal and a living plant. However, he states that some writers believed <b>the</b> <b>lamb</b> to be <b>the</b> fruit of a plant, sprouting forward from melon-like seeds. Others, however, believed <b>the</b> <b>lamb</b> to be a living member of the plant that, once separated from it, would perish. <b>The</b> vegetable <b>lamb</b> was believed to have blood, bones, and flesh {{like that of a}} normal lamb. It was connected to the earth by a stem, similar to an umbilical cord, that propped <b>the</b> <b>lamb</b> up above ground. The cord could flex downward, allowing <b>the</b> <b>lamb</b> to feed on the grass and plants surrounding it. Once the plants within reach were eaten, <b>the</b> <b>lamb</b> died. It could be eaten, once dead, and its blood supposedly tasted sweet like honey. Its wool was said to be used by the native people of its homeland to make head coverings and other articles of clothing. The only carnivorous animals attracted to the lamb-plant (other than humans) were wolves.|$|R

We determine SN(x,L) analytically for the special cases of N = 1 and N → ∞. For large but finite N, we determine the unusual asymptotic form whose leading behavior is SN(z) ∼ N −z 2, with z = x/L. Simulations of the capture process very slowly converge to this asymptotic prediction as N reaches 10500...|$|R
