They caught up with the Greeks outside Ephesus and the Greeks were forced to turn and prepare to fight. Holland suggests that the Persians were primarily cavalry (hence their ability <b>to</b> <b>catch</b> <b>up</b> with the Greeks). The typical Persian cavalry of the time were probably missile cavalry, whose tactics were to wear down a static enemy with volley after volley.|$|E

The paper is organized as follows. After an introduction <b>to</b> the <b>catch</b> <b>up</b> of countries in general, Section 2 puts forward the claim that <b>catch</b> <b>up</b> of countries has been usually associated with the emergence and growth of some leading sectors. These sectors are characterized by sectoral systems that differ greatly in their characteristics and dynamics. The notion of sectoral system is discussed in general in Section 3, while in Section 4 some basic evidence on the factors affecting <b>catch</b> <b>up</b> of countries in different sectoral systems is discussed. Then in Section 5 differences in the <b>catch</b> <b>up</b> across countries {{but in the same}} sectoral system are discussed. The paper then concludes discussing the <b>Catch</b> <b>up</b> Project which is underway and, among other issues, aims <b>to</b> tackle <b>catch</b> <b>up</b> in sectoral systems...|$|R
