30|$|This study {{provides}} {{a brief overview}} of <b>the</b> <b>terms</b> and descriptions currently used in press and academic literature plus a clear delineation of <b>the</b> <b>terms.</b> Hereby, <b>the</b> specific attributes of <b>the</b> <b>terms</b> are identified and consolidated. Subsequently, the consolidated attributes serve as measurement where <b>the</b> <b>terms</b> can be aligned to. In this vein, the linkages and relationships between <b>the</b> <b>terms</b> and their underlying concepts are uncovered. In the last step, a conceptual framework is introduced to classify <b>the</b> <b>terms</b> in several dimensions.|$|R

5|$|The {{office of}} {{governor}} {{was established by}} the first New York State Constitution in 1777. The governor was originally for a term of three years, though the constitution did not specify when <b>the</b> <b>term</b> began. A 1787 law set the start of <b>the</b> <b>term</b> at July 1. The New York State Constitutional Convention of 1821 amended the state constitution, reducing <b>the</b> <b>term</b> of office to two years, moving the election to November, and moving {{the beginning and the}} end of <b>the</b> <b>term</b> to coincide with the calendar year. An 1874 amendment extended <b>the</b> <b>term</b> of office back to three years, but the 1894 constitution again reduced it to two years. The most recent constitution of 1938 extended <b>the</b> <b>term</b> to the current four years. There is no limit to the number of consecutive terms a governor may serve.|$|E
5|$|Agnosticism is criticized from {{a variety}} of standpoints. Some {{religious}} thinkers see agnosticism as limiting the mind's capacity to know reality to materialism. Some atheists criticize the use of <b>the</b> <b>term</b> agnosticism as functionally indistinguishable from atheism; this results in frequent criticisms of those who adopt <b>the</b> <b>term</b> as avoiding the atheist label.|$|E
5|$|Although Dawkins invented <b>the</b> <b>term</b> meme, {{he has not}} {{claimed that}} the idea was entirely novel, {{and there have been}} other {{expressions}} for similar ideas in the past. For instance, John Laurent has suggested that <b>the</b> <b>term</b> may have derived from the work of the little-known German biologist Richard Semon. In 1904, Semon published Die Mneme (which appeared in English in 1924 as The Mneme). This book discusses the cultural transmission of experiences, with insights parallel to those of Dawkins. Laurent also found <b>the</b> <b>term</b> mneme used in Maurice Maeterlinck's The Life of the White Ant (1926), and has highlighted the similarities to Dawkins's concept.|$|E

5|$|Another {{claim for}} {{the origin of}} <b>the</b> <b>term</b> comes from the works of science fiction author Motoko Arai, who used the word in her novels as a second-person pronoun and the readers adopted <b>the</b> <b>term</b> for themselves.

40|$|This paper {{contributes}} to empirical {{research on the}} dynamics of <b>the</b> <b>terms</b> of trade. We start by proposing a method for constructing different measures of <b>the</b> <b>terms</b> of trade. This is achieved by estimating a range of substitution elasticities using a panel data approach and highly disaggregated data on trade flows. Next, various measures of <b>the</b> <b>terms</b> of trade and trade margins are related to productivity and demand proxies. We find that domestic demand side movements are positively related to <b>the</b> <b>terms</b> of trade, while domestic productivity gains result in a deterioration of <b>the</b> <b>terms</b> of trade. Our results suggest that higher relative productivity raises the real component of exports relative to imports along the intensive margin inducing a weakening of <b>the</b> <b>terms</b> of trade.

5|$|The {{original}} California Constitution of 1849 {{called for}} elections every two years, with no set start date for <b>the</b> <b>term.</b> An amendment ratified in 1862 increased <b>the</b> <b>term</b> to four years, and the 1879 constitution set <b>the</b> <b>term</b> to begin {{on the first}} Monday in January following an election. In 1990, Proposition 140 led to a constitutional amendment implementing a term limit of two terms; prior to this limit, only one governor, Earl Warren, served more than two terms. Jerry Brown {{was able to be}} elected to a third term in 2010 because his previous terms were before <b>the</b> <b>term</b> limit was enacted. The 1849 constitution also created the office of lieutenant governor, who, in cases of vacancy in the office of governor, becomes governor.

50|$|Osmolarity and tonicity {{are related}} but {{distinct}} concepts. Thus, <b>the</b> <b>terms</b> ending in -osmotic (isosmotic, hyperosmotic, hyposmotic) are not synonymous with <b>the</b> <b>terms</b> ending in -tonic (isotonic, hypertonic, hypotonic). <b>The</b> <b>terms</b> are related {{in that they}} both compare the solute concentrations of two solutions separated by a membrane. <b>The</b> <b>terms</b> are different because osmolarity {{takes into account the}} total concentration of penetrating solutes and non-penetrating solutes, whereas tonicity takes into account the total concentration of only non-penetrating solutes.|$|R
