5|$|Australia's two {{new leaders}} {{featured}} in a dramatic game during the season—the first tied match in Sheffield Shield history, played at the Junction Oval in Melbourne. New South Wales, chasing 161 to win, slumped to 7/70 when Craig (suffering <b>tonsillitis)</b> defied medical orders, left his hospital bed, and came out to bat. A partnership of 75 with Richie Benaud took them to within 16 runs of victory, but another collapse left the scores tied.|$|E
5|$|African {{tribes in}} several {{countries}} have termites as totems, {{and for this reason}} tribe members are forbidden to eat the reproductive alates. Termites are widely used in traditional popular medicine; they are used as treatments for diseases and other conditions such as asthma, bronchitis, hoarseness, influenza, sinusitis, <b>tonsillitis</b> and whooping cough. In Nigeria, Macrotermes nigeriensis is used for spiritual protection and to treat wounds and sick pregnant women. In Southeast Asia, termites are used in ritual practices. In Malaysia, Singapore and Thailand, termite mounds are commonly worshiped among the populace. Abandoned mounds are viewed as structures created by spirits, believing a local guardian dwells within the mound; this is known as Keramat and Datok Kong. In urban areas, local residents construct red-painted shrines over mounds that have been abandoned, where they pray for good health, protection and luck.|$|E
5|$|Leopold {{had been}} {{specific}} in letters to Hagenauer {{that the family}} would not visit the Dutch Republic, but would go to Paris and then return home to Salzburg. However, he was persuaded by an envoy of the Princess Carolina of Orange-Nassau, sister of the Prince of Orange, to go instead to The Hague and to present the children to her, as official guests of the court. After the party's landing at Calais there was a month's delay at Lille, as first Wolfgang fell sick with <b>tonsillitis,</b> then Leopold suffered prolonged dizziness attacks. Early in September the family moved on to Ghent, where Wolfgang played on the new organ at the Bernardines chapel; {{a few days later}} he played on the cathedral organ at Antwerp. On 11 September the family finally reached The Hague.|$|E
5|$|At Emma Town Bartlett met Baron Kleist, a {{distinguished}} Russian official who {{offered to take}} him to Emma Harbour on the coast, a week's journey away, where he could look for a ship to Alaska. Bartlett accepted, and on 10 May, though still weak from his journey and an attack of <b>tonsillitis,</b> said goodbye to Kataktovik (who was remaining for the time being in Emma Town), and set off with the baron. On the way they learned that Captain Pedersen was in the area. On 16 May they reached Emma Harbour; five days later Pedersen arrived in the whaler Herman and, without delay, took Bartlett on board and set out for Alaska. They arrived off Nome on 24 May, but ice prevented them reaching the shore. After three days' waiting they turned south, and landed at St Michael, where Bartlett was at last able to send a radio message to Ottawa informing the government of Karluk's fate. He also made enquiries about the whereabouts of the United States revenue cutter Bear, which he saw as a possible rescue vessel for the stranded party.|$|E
5|$|Eberle debuted {{with the}} Pats in 2006–07, scoring 55 points and a team-high 28 goals as a rookie. He added two goals and seven points {{in six games}} against the Swift Current Broncos in the opening round of the 2007 WHL playoffs, but was sidelined for the {{entirety}} of the second round against the Medicine Hat Tigers with a virus. Eberle started his second major junior season by earning WHL Player of the Month honours for October 2007, totalling sixteen goals and 26 points over sixteen games for the Pats. He had missed two games early in the season with <b>tonsillitis,</b> before scoring a hat trick in his return on October 6, 2007, against the Moose Jaw Warriors. Eberle later represented Team WHL against Russia in the 2007 ADT Canada-Russia Challenge in late November. Midway through the season, he was chosen to compete in the 2008 CHL Top Prospects Game in Edmonton.|$|E
5|$|In 1929–30, ill-health {{restricted}} Jackson to {{just five}} first-class matches and five innings for Balmain. Despite his health, Jackson {{had a successful}} season, and scored 168 not out against Arthur Gilligan's English team, which toured Australia briefly en route to New Zealand. He {{was seen as an}} automatic selection for the 1930 Ashes tour of England. He confirmed his selection with 182 in a Test trial, an innings regarded by many as the best he had ever played. Another scare with illness saw him hospitalised in Adelaide after the Christmas match against South Australia, missing the next two state matches. His health problems continued after an operation to remove his tonsils; a procedure that was arranged by the Australian Board of Control despite Jackson never having previously suffered any problems with his tonsils. Bill Ponsford had suffered from <b>tonsillitis</b> during the previous tour and the Board were anxious to avoid similar occurrences. Complications resulting from the operation saw Jackson lose a stone (6.4 kilograms) in weight.|$|E
5|$|Hammond's health {{remained}} poor at {{the start}} of the 1935 season. He developed septic <b>tonsillitis</b> which made it difficult for him to breathe, eat and sleep, and ultimately required an operation to remove his tonsils in early 1936. Hammond's form was indifferent and he believed it was his worst season. In first-class matches, he scored 2,616 runs (average 49.35) and took 60 wickets (average 27.26). He became the ninth player to reach 100 first-class centuries, emerging from a run of bad form against Somerset. Long a regular in the side, for the first time he captained the Players against the Gentlemen at Lord's. In the five-Test series against South Africa, a run of low scores again brought press speculation about his place in the national side. He did not pass fifty until the third Test, when he scored 63 and 87 not out, ending a run of 22 innings without a fifty, in which time he averaged 23.47 over 14 Tests. Hammond made two more fifties in the last two Tests, although they were insufficient to prevent England from losing 1–0, their third successive series defeat. He finished the series with 389 runs at an average of 64.83, but remained unsatisfied with his form.|$|E
5|$|In {{the final}} two Tests, Hutton shared three {{consecutive}} century opening partnerships with Cyril Washbrook. A four-hour 94 in the first innings was followed by 76 in the second. Press opinion was divided over Hutton's performance; some critics, including the Australian bowlers, detected insecurity against fast bowling, particularly the bouncers with which Ray Lindwall and Miller targeted him. Hutton's preferred tactic of ducking under the ball reinforced {{the impression that he}} was afraid. In the final Test, Hutton scored a century, batting through the first day to score 122 not out, his first Test century in Australia, despite another barrage from Lindwall and Miller. The Sydney Morning Herald criticised the high number of short balls bowled by the Australian pacemen, bowled at Hutton as often as three times per over. After the second day was rained off, Hutton was taken ill overnight with <b>tonsillitis,</b> missed the remainder of the match and flew home soon after. In all first-class matches on tour, Hutton scored 1,267 runs at an average of 70.38, while in the Tests, he managed 417 runs at an average of 52.12; he topped both sets of averages. Wisden noted that it took him time to find form in the Tests, but that he often batted well despite ill health. Bill Bowes, covering the tour as a journalist, believed that Hutton was unable to master bowling faster than he had encountered for eight years, but acquitted himself reasonably well.|$|E
5|$|Miller {{was given}} the {{responsibility}} of batting in the number three position when Hassett was afflicted by <b>tonsillitis.</b> In the First Test at Johannesburg, Miller scored 21 and then took 5/40 in South Africa's first innings, only his second match on tour, resulting in the home side being forced to follow on and lose by an innings. In the Second Test at Cape Town, he scored 58 and then took 3/54 in the first innings. On the third morning, Miller crashed his car and arrived late to the ground, still putting on his trousers {{as he entered the}} playing field. Despite, this he dismissed Dudley Nourse with his third ball. He was wicketless in the second innings, and took only one in the Third Test in Durban and did not pass 10 with the bat. Australia won both matches. He returned to the form in the Fourth Test with 84, 33 notout and 3/75 in a high scoring draw. Miller took match figures of 5/66 in the Fifth Test as Australia took the series 4–0. He ended the series with 246runs at 41.00 and 17wickets at 22.94, placing in the top six in the Test averages for bat and ball. During the tour matches, he took match figures of 11/54 against Natal Country Districts and scored a century against Transvaal.|$|E
5|$|Voce {{missed the}} fourth Test of the series, being {{replaced}} by a leg spinner, Tommy Mitchell. Larwood continued to use bodyline, {{but he was the}} only bowler in the team using the tactic; even so, he used it less frequently than usual and seemed less effective in high temperatures and humidity. England won the game by eight wickets, thanks in part to an innings of 83 by Eddie Paynter who had been admitted to hospital with <b>tonsillitis</b> but left in order to bat when England were struggling in their innings. Voce returned for the final Test, but neither he nor Allen were fully fit, and despite the use of bodyline tactics, Australia scored 435 at a rapid pace, aided by several dropped catches. Australia included a fast bowler for this final game, Harry Alexander who bowled some short deliveries but was not allowed to use many fielders on the leg side by his captain, Woodfull. England built a lead of 19 but their tactics in Australia's second innings were disrupted when Larwood left the field with an injured foot; Hedley Verity, a spinner, claimed five wickets to bowl Australia out; England won by eight wickets and won the series by four Tests to one.|$|E
5|$|Verity {{regained his}} place in the team for the third Test, {{replacing}} Bowes. The match was highly controversial owing to England's continued and increased use of Bodyline tactics. Verity's main contributions to the match came from his batting: he shared partnerships worth over 90 runs in both innings, scoring 45runs in the first innings and 40 in the second. He took one wicket in the game; after 16wicketless overs in the first innings, Verity dismissed Bradman in the second, his first Test wicket against Australia, and England won the match by 338runs. After the third Test, the MCC played New South Wales again. Rain before the beginning of the third day affected the pitch; Bradman, possibly irritated by a minor show of bravado from Verity, scored 71 in conditions which should have been perfect for the Yorkshireman, who took only two wickets. During the fourth Test, Verity took few wickets but Wisden noted that he kept a good length and prevented the Australian batsmen scoring quickly. His batting was important once more. In their first innings, England had lost eight wickets, and were still 76runs behind Australia's score when Verity joined Paynter, who had left a hospital bed where he had been confined with <b>tonsillitis.</b> The two men scored 92runs together, to give England a small lead. Verity scored 23 not out in two-and-three-quarter hours, although he was lucky not to be dismissed several times. Australia were bowled out in their second innings and Verity took two wickets; England scored the required runs to record a six-wicket win which ensured victory in the series—and the Ashes. Verity's bowling was most successful in the final Test, when Jardine allowed him to depart from his role of restricting the batsmen's scoring and bowl a more attacking line and length in an attempt to take wickets. Having taken three for 62 in Australia's first innings, he took five for 33 in the second, assisted by a worn pitch that helped him to spin the ball. He dismissed Bradman for 71 and later took two wickets with successive deliveries.|$|E
25|$|OSA and {{recurrent}} <b>tonsillitis</b> (RT) {{are different}} in their mechanism and outcome.|$|E
25|$|In December 1924, {{several days}} after the last ship left the port, Welch treated a few {{children}} for what he first diagnosed as sore throats or <b>tonsillitis,</b> initially dismissing diphtheria since it is extremely contagious {{and he would have}} expected to see the same symptoms in their family members or other cases around town. In the next few weeks, as the number of <b>tonsillitis</b> cases grew and four children died whom he {{had not been able to}} autopsy, Welch became increasingly concerned about diphtheria.|$|E
25|$|<b>Tonsillitis</b> is a sub type of pharyngitis. If the {{inflammation}} includes both the tonsils {{and other parts}} of the throat, it may be called pharyngotonsillitis. Another sub classification is nasopharyngitis (the common cold).|$|E
25|$|A match {{best remembered}} for the heroism of Paynter, who despite {{spending}} {{much of the}} match in hospital with severe <b>tonsillitis,</b> scored 83 in the first innings, and won the match with a six in the second.|$|E
25|$|Infectious {{mononucleosis}} ("glandular fever") {{caused by}} the Epstein–Barr virus. This may cause significant lymph gland swelling and an exudative <b>tonsillitis</b> with marked redness and swelling of the throat. The heterophile test can be used if this is suspected.|$|E
25|$|More simply still, gargling with warm, salty {{water may}} help {{alleviate}} the discomfort of <b>tonsillitis,</b> which often accompanies tonsil stones. Vigorous gargling each morning can also keep the tonsil crypts clear {{of all but}} the most persistent tonsilloliths.|$|E
25|$|Tonsilloliths or {{tonsillar}} concretions {{occur in}} up to 10% of the population, frequently due to episodes of <b>tonsillitis.</b> While small concretions in the tonsils are common, true tonsilloliths or stones are rare. They commonly occur in young adults and are rare in children.|$|E
25|$|The {{mechanism}} by which these calculi form is subject to debate, though they appear to result from the accumulation of material retained within the crypts, along {{with the growth of}} bacteria and fungi – sometimes in association with persistent chronic purulent <b>tonsillitis.</b>|$|E
25|$|Non-invasive disease manifestations include {{predominantly}} <b>tonsillitis</b> and superficial skin infections. Additionally, it {{has long}} been recognized as a potential cause of cellulitis/erysipelas. However, the role of SDSE in cellulitis might have been previously underestimated, and it was linked to a majority of the cellulitis cases in a recent study.|$|E
25|$|Imaging {{diagnostic}} {{techniques can}} identify a radiopaque mass {{that may be}} mistaken for foreign bodies, displaced teeth or calcified blood vessels. Computed tomography (CT) may reveal nonspecific calcified images in the tonsillar zone. The differential diagnosis must be established with acute and chronic <b>tonsillitis,</b> tonsillar hypertrophy, peritonsillar abscesses, foreign bodies, phlebolites, ectopic bone or cartilage, lymph nodes, granulomatous lesions or calcification of the stylohyoid ligament {{in the context of}} Eagle syndrome (elongated styloid process).|$|E
25|$|Radcliffe {{went on to}} win the New York City Half Marathon in 1:09:45, {{two seconds}} off the course record. However, after this she pulled out of the World Championships as she felt unfit, and she missed the 2009 IAAF World Half Marathon Championships in Birmingham due to a bout of <b>tonsillitis.</b> She {{returned}} to action at the 2009 New York City Marathon but failed to notch her third consecutive victory, instead fading to fourth place with knee problems.|$|E
25|$|Barrington had a poor {{season in}} 1962, <b>tonsillitis</b> robbed him of match {{practice}} before the First Test against the visiting Pakistanis {{and he made}} only 10 runs {{in the first three}} Tests. He was dropped for the Fourth Test, but recalled for the Fifth at the Oval, where he came in at 365/2 and made 50 not out. He made only 60 runs (20.00), but did better for Surrey, making 1,865 first-class runs (49.07) in the season and was kept in the team set to tour Australia and New Zealand.|$|E
25|$|Streptococcus dysgalactiae is a gram positive, beta-haemolytic, coccal {{bacterium}} {{belonging to}} the family Streptococcaceae. It is capable of infecting both humans and animals, but is most frequently encountered as a commensal of the alimentary tract, genital tract, or less commonly, {{as a part of}} the skin flora. The clinical manifestations in human disease range from superficial skin-infections and <b>tonsillitis,</b> to severe necrotising fasciitis and bacteraemia. The incidence of invasive disease has been reported to be rising. Several different animal species are susceptible to infection by S.dysgalactiae, but bovine mastitis and infectious arthritis in lambs (joint ill) have been most frequently reported.|$|E
25|$|Many people {{experience}} episodes of OSA {{for only a}} short period. This can {{be the result of}} an upper respiratory infection that causes nasal congestion, along with swelling of the throat, or <b>tonsillitis</b> that temporarily produces very enlarged tonsils. The Epstein-Barr virus, for example, is known to be able to dramatically increase the size of lymphoid tissue during acute infection, and OSA is fairly common in acute cases of severe infectious mononucleosis. Temporary spells of OSA syndrome may also occur in individuals who are under the influence of a drug (such as alcohol) that may relax their body tone excessively and interfere with normal arousal from sleep mechanisms.|$|E
25|$|Radiofrequency ablation: Monopolar {{radiofrequency}} thermal ablation transfers radiofrequency {{energy to}} the tonsil tissue through probes inserted in the tonsil. The procedure can be performed in an office (outpatient) setting under light sedation or local anesthesia. After the treatment is performed, scarring occurs within the tonsil causing it to decrease in size {{over a period of}} several weeks. The treatment can be performed several times. The advantages of this technique are minimal discomfort, ease of operations, and immediate return to work or school. Tonsillar tissue remains after the procedure but is less prominent. This procedure is recommended for treating enlarged tonsils and not chronic or recurrent <b>tonsillitis.</b>|$|E
25|$|Tonsillectomy is a {{surgical}} procedure {{in which each}} tonsil is removed from a recess {{in the side of}} the pharynx called the tonsillar fossa. The procedure is performed in response to repeated occurrence of acute <b>tonsillitis,</b> sleep surgery for obstructive sleep apnea, nasal airway obstruction, diphtheria carrier state, snoring, or peritonsillar abscess. For children, the adenoids (also known as a pharyngeal tonsil or nasopharyngeal tonsil) are usually removed, a procedure called adenoidectomy (or tonsilloadenoidectomy or adenotonsillectomy when combined). Adenoidectomy is uncommon in adults in whom the adenoids are usually vestigial. Although tonsillectomy is performed less frequently than in the 1950s, it remains a common surgical procedures in children in the United States and many other western countries.|$|E
25|$|The first Test was delayed, at the {{instigation}} of the SCG {{to allow}} time for Ranjitsinhji {{to recover from}} <b>tonsillitis</b> and because Andrew Stoddart's mother had died. In the event, Stoddart did not play, but Ranjitsinhji did, although he did drop down to seventh in the batting order. England were captained by Archie MacLaren for the first time. The Test was dominated by an innings of 175 by Ranjitsinhji. There {{was a moment of}} controversy when Australian batsman Charlie McLeod was run out by Bill Storer when he left his crease after being bowled by a no-ball, when his deafness prevented him from hearing the umpire's call. England won comfortably by 9 wickets.|$|E
25|$|The {{international}} break left Middlesbrough without Tuncay and Shawky after both {{picked up}} injuries, while David Wheater could only make the bench after suffering from <b>tonsillitis,</b> so Digard, Riggott and Mido came in. Nathan Porritt was named {{as a substitute}} {{for the first time on}} an all-Academy bench. Portsmouth were the more dominant side throughout the match, however it was Boro who took the lead after Mido's fourth goal of the season. Jermain Defoe scored a brace for the home side in the second half to give them a 2–1 win. Digard picked up an injury and had to be taken off while Boro thought they should have had a penalty after Downing was brought down in the box.|$|E
25|$|Larger tonsilloliths {{may cause}} {{multiple}} symptoms, including recurrent halitosis, which frequently accompanies a tonsil infection, sore throat, white debris, a bad taste {{in the back}} of the throat, difficulty swallowing, ear ache, and tonsil swelling. A medical study conducted in 2007 found an association between tonsilloliths and bad breath in patients with a certain type of recurrent <b>tonsillitis.</b> Among those with bad breath, 75% of the subjects had tonsilloliths, while only 6% of subjects with normal halitometry values (normal breath) had tonsilloliths. A foreign body sensation may also exist {{in the back of}} the throat. The condition may also be an asymptomatic condition, with detection upon palpating a hard intratonsillar or submucosal mass.|$|E
25|$|Rosa Parks {{was born}} Rosa Louise McCauley in Tuskegee, Alabama, on February 4, 1913, to Leona (née Edwards), a teacher, and James McCauley, a carpenter. She was of African ancestry, though {{one of her}} great-grandfathers was Scots-Irish {{and one of her}} great-grandmothers was a slave of Native American descent. She was small as a child and {{suffered}} poor health with chronic <b>tonsillitis.</b> When her parents separated, she moved with her mother to Pine Level, just outside the state capital, Montgomery. She grew up on a farm with her maternal grandparents, mother, and younger brother Sylvester. They all were members of the African Methodist Episcopal Church (AME), a century-old independent black denomination founded by free blacks in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, in the early nineteenth century.|$|E
25|$|For the Ashes {{series against}} Australia in 1926, Carr was named captain of England. In the third Test at Leeds, he {{controversially}} put Australia into bat {{after winning the}} toss, and compounded it by dropping Charlie Macartney at slip in the first over of the match. Macartney scored a hundred before lunch and England was lucky to avoid defeat. He came down with <b>tonsillitis</b> during the fourth Test of the series, and although he recovered {{in time for the}} fifth Test, was replaced as captain by Percy Chapman. He was bitterly disappointed with this decision, and although he captained England twice more in his final two Tests against South Africa in 1929, from then on he put most of his effort into captaining Nottinghamshire into a dominant position within the English County cricket competition.|$|E
25|$|Unfortunately for Chappell, {{his health}} was now blighted by {{recurring}} <b>tonsillitis</b> {{and he found}} it difficult to bat for long periods during the 1974–75 Ashes series. He was the backbone of Australia's sometimes inconsistent batting, scoring 608 runs at 55.3. At Sydney, where Australia won to reclaim the Ashes, Chappell dominated with 84 and 144, which he followed up with a century in a losing cause in the sixth Test at Melbourne. At Perth, he broke the world record for a fielder by snaring seven catches. Ironically, his grandfather Vic Richardson was one of several players who held the old record of six. Chappell reluctantly had his tonsils removed, but he quickly lost a lot of weight which affected his performance on the tour of England that followed. He played in the World Cup (for what proved to be the only time), then made only one good score (73* at Lords) in the four Ashes Tests that followed.|$|E
25|$|On the Jets' second possession, Namath threw deep to Maynard, who, {{despite his}} pulled hamstring, was open by a step. The ball was overthrown, {{but this one}} play helped change {{the outcome of the}} game. Fearing the speedy Maynard, the Colts decided to rotate their zone defense to help cover Maynard, leaving Sauer covered {{one-on-one}} by Lenny Lyles, helping Sauer catch 8 passes for 133 yards, including a crucial third quarter 39-yard reception that kept a scoring drive alive. The Jets kept rushing Snell to their strong left, rushing off tackle with Boozer blocking the linebacker, and gained first down after first down as the Colts defense gave ground. The Colts defense was more concerned about Maynard, the passing game, and the deep threat of a Namath to Maynard touchdown. Although the Colts were unaware of Maynard's injury, the Jets were aware that Lyles had been weakened by <b>tonsillitis</b> all week, causing them great glee when they saw the one-on-one matchup with Sauer.|$|E
25|$|Cracknell began rowing whilst {{attending}} the independent Kingston Grammar School and rowed at the Junior World Championships in 1989 and 1990, winning {{a gold medal}} in 1990. He graduated from the University of Reading as a Bachelor of Science (BSc) in Human Geography in 1993, followed by a PGCE at the Institute of Education and a Master of Science (MSc) from Brunel University in 1999. Moving into the senior squad, Cracknell made numerous appearances in the World Rowing Championships; however, he did not win any medals prior to the 1996 Summer Olympics. He qualified in the double scull for the 1996 Games, but fell ill with <b>tonsillitis</b> and was unable to race. In 1997, he won a seat in the men's coxless fours, with Steve Redgrave, Matthew Pinsent and Tim Foster. With this crew, he won the rowing World Championships in 1997, 1998 and 1999 (with Ed Coode replacing the injured Foster), and finally the gold medal at the 2000 Summer Olympics. In August 2000, the month prior to winning gold in Sydney, he took part in a 3-part BBC documentary entitled Gold Fever. This followed the coxless four team in the years leading up to the Olympics, including video diaries recording the highs and lows in their quest for gold.|$|E
500|$|Musial {{began the}} 1947 season by hitting [...]146 in April. On May 9, team doctor Dr. Robert Hyland {{confirmed}} a previous diagnosis of appendicitis, while discovering that Musial was concurrently suffering from <b>tonsillitis.</b> He received treatment, {{but did not}} have either his appendix or tonsils surgically removed until after the season ended. Despite his health woes, he finished the year with a batting average of [...]312.|$|E
