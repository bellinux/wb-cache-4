40|$|In this survey, it {{is aimed}} to {{determine}} parents’ thoughts of children using a <b>toys</b> <b>library</b> opened within a public library. The {{concept of a}} “Toys Library”, which is growing in popularity, combines the perceptions of <b>toys</b> and <b>library,</b> {{based on the principle}} of lending toys out to disadvantaged children. This study is a qualitative phenomenological research in which parents’ thoughts and knowledge gathered from the literature are examined. The study group is composed of 306 children, 134 from pre-schools and 172 from primary schools, and their parents. In this research, which is based on proper sampling method, statistical data were obtained from the software prepared for the <b>toys</b> <b>library</b> and qualitative data obtained from semi-structured interviews over a 12 month period. As a result of content analysis of 48 parents interviews recorded via video, it has been concluded that the project contributed to the functioning of the public libraries, has fully met the children’s toys needs, and has positively affected the children’s character and social development. As a result of this project, it is hoped that the survey will be seen as a reference point for <b>toy</b> <b>libraries</b> planned to be opened elsewhere...|$|R

Joanna von Levetzow was a Toronto social worker who worked with children with disabilities and was interested in adapting toys to the physical needs of the children. She {{was inspired by the}} work of international <b>toy</b> lending <b>libraries</b> and worked to form an informal toy lending network in Ontario called the Canadian Association of <b>Toy</b> <b>Libraries.</b> In the beginning the members were mostly children's hospitals and treatment centres but others soon joined. In the mid-1970s, the National Task Force on Children's Play (under the jurisdiction of the Canadian Council of Children and Youth) were also defining the importance of play. Their findings led to the establishment of a Children's Play Resource Centre (CPRC, currently now part of the Society for Children and Youth of B.C.).
