The accumulating gas was later ignited by a candle that Fisher had allegedly lit, waiting for the gas to accumulate and descend to the flame hours after being lit. This delayed fuse would have given Fisher an approximate 10 hour head start in his successful attempt to evade law enforcement. Burned bodies of a woman and two children were found lying in bed in the remains of the burnt out house. They were identified as Mary (age 38), and her two children, Brittney (age 12) and Bobby (age 10). Investigators have theorized that Fisher murdered his family because he felt threatened by Mary's intent to divorce him, and didn't want his children <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>through</b> <b>what</b> he did as a child.|$|E

However, both singles underperformed on the charts, prompting the album to be postponed for a 2015 release. After months with no updates on the album, Stefani revealed in an interview for Entertainment Weekly that she scrapped the entire album in favor of starting over, since she did not feel fulfilled and totally involved with the previous project. Stefani started writing new material in June 2015, and following her divorce from Gavin Rossdale a month later, she felt very inspired. In the same interview, Stefani claimed: [...] "I needed <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>through</b> <b>what</b> I needed to go through to write the record that I needed to write.

However, she suffers a miscarriage and does not tell him, instead checking into Fairview Sanitarium; Case was disappointed when she heard that the character would be returning to the psychiatric facility. Case explained that Sharon was [...] "feeling insecure at the time about her [...] She was trying to build her relationship with Dylan and wasn't sure if {{he really wanted to}} be with her or if it was just because of the baby." [...] The actress also commented that Sharon did not want [...] "Dylan <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>through</b> <b>what</b> he went through before", having lost children previously. While in Fairview, Sharon encounters her psychiatrist Dr. Anderson (Elizabeth Bogush), who in actuality is Sandra [...] "Sandy" [...] Allen, a woman seeking revenge on Nick for a diving accident during their high school years which left her paralyzed. At first, Case was not aware of Dr. Anderson's true identity, until she finally asked Bogush about her character. Dr. Anderson tells Sharon (who had been trying to conceive again) that she is pregnant, although in reality is drugging Sharon into experiencing a phantom pregnancy. Case said that she was [...] "up for anything" [...] upon learning that Sharon would be drugged. That November, Dr. Anderson presents Christian, the kidnapped newborn son of Nick's wife Sage Newman (Kelly Sullivan), to Sharon as her own child. Sharon, who does not remember giving birth, nevertheless accepts that the baby is hers, and names him Sully. Case noted that [...] "from Sharon's point of view, this woman pulled off a miracle. And that's why she trusts her so much." [...] Meanwhile, Nick and Sage are led to believe that their baby had died.|$|E

He asserted that the NSA had copies of emails he sent to their Office of General Counsel, oversight and compliance personnel broaching [...] "concerns about the NSA's interpretations of its legal authorities.

[...] "It's such a part of me, the record, 'cause of what I've gone through." [...] In another clip, Spears talks about how she uses her work as a dancer and singer to deal with the stress of her life and how it helps her deal with her emotions. She said that for her, dancing is like therapy. [...] "If I have a lot of nervous energy, when I start dancing, it all goes away and I just feel emotion. It's like a rollercoaster," [...] she says. [...] "People think that when you go through something in life {{you have to go to}} therapy. For me, art is therapy, because it's like you're expressing yourself in such a spiritual way.

[...] The procedure that he ultimately concocted to write The Sonnets {{is the essence of}} the work's novelty and ingenuity. After attempting several sonnets, Berrigan decided <b>to</b> <b>go</b> back <b>through</b> <b>what</b> he had written and take out certain lines, one line from each work until he had six lines. He then <b>went</b> <b>through</b> the poems backwards and took one more line from each until he had accumulated six more lines, twelve lines total. Based on this body of the work, Berrigan knew what the final couplet would be; this process became the basis for The Sonnets. Addressing claims that the method is totally mechanical, Berrigan explains that some of the seventy-seven sonnets came to him [...] "whole," [...] not needing to be pieced together. The poet's preoccupation with style, his concern for form and his own role as the creator as evinced by The Sonnets pose a challenge to traditional ideas about poetry and signify a fresh and innovative artistic approach.|$|R

[...] "Le Lion Noir," [...] bad, dirty, and dear. Now say, there are three travellers--three inn-inspectors, who are sent forth by Mr. Murray on a great commission, and who stop at every inn in the world. The eldest goes to the [...] "Lion d'Or"--capital house, good table-d'hote, excellent wine, moderate charges. The second commissioner tries the [...] "Silver Lion"--tolerable house, bed, dinner, bill and so forth. But fancy Commissioner No. 3--the poor fag, doubtless, and boots of the party. He {{has to go to}} the [...] "Lion Noir." [...] He knows he is to have a bad dinner--he eats it uncomplainingly. He is to have bad wine. He swallows it, grinding his wretched teeth, and aware that he will he unwell in consequence. He knows he is to have a dirty bed, and what he is to expect there. He pops out the candle. He sinks into those dingy sheets. He delivers over his body to the nightly tormentors, he pays an exorbitant bill, and he writes down, [...] "Lion Noir, bad, dirty, dear." [...] Next day the commission sets out for Arras, we will say, and they begin again: [...] "Le Cochon d'Or," [...] "Le Cochon d'Argent," [...] "Le Cochon Noir"--and that is poor Boots's inn, of course.

40|$|In a very {{interesting}} paper, ‘Pritchard on Virtue Epistemology’, Christoph Kelp argues that my recent critique of a proposal that I refer to as robust virtue epistemology (RVE) fails <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>through.</b> 1 <b>What</b> is distinctive about RVE is that it tries to completely analyse knowledge into true belief and a virtue-theoretic condition (e. g., some sort of demand that the true belief be appropriately due to the agent’s cognitive ability). In particular, RVE does not involve any appeal to an anti-luck condition. 2 As Kelp makes clear, my argument against RVE is based on two types of counterexample. Neither example is meant to constitute a knock-down argument on its own, in that I grant that there is scope to reject the intuitions in play in each case. My claim, however, is that once you push both objections together then RVE is in serious trouble since it is, in effect, being pulled in two directions. This is because while the one kind of case puts pressure on the proponent of RVE to strengthen the proposal, the other kind of case puts pressure on the proponent to weaken it. It is thus {{hard to see how}} one could defend RVE from this pair of objections in a principled manner. Kelp’s way of defending RVE involves noting that there are in fact two ways o...|$|R
