500|$|As a batsman, Verity {{occasionally}} showed {{potential to}} become good, but concentrated his energy on bowling. He modelled his batting on Herbert Sutcliffe, and Robertson-Glasgow wrote: [...] "As a batsman, he looks like Sutcliffe gone stale. <b>That</b> <b>is,</b> <b>pretty</b> good." ...|$|E
500|$|The Moving Picture World gave it minor {{praise and}} short {{summary of the}} film, {{but it does not}} {{evaluate}} or describe the special camera effects used to produce the film. The reviewer states: [...] "To see the doll and the pumpkin suddenly assume life is interesting and naturally causes the little girl to whom they belong surprise. The good times they have with the fairy's help will long remain in her memory, even though it is only a dream." [...] The New York Dramatic Mirror was critical of the production, stating [...] "This sounds as if it ought to be very clever, but aside from the work of the little heroine and the dance of the fairies it is entirely uninspired. It needs a drastic application of imagination. The broad idea is excellent, but the details of the management indicate impoverished resources. When the aid of fairies is invoked it opens up all sorts of avenues of fanciful treatment, but this film doesn't get away from stolid realities. For example, nobody could imagine anything more earthly than the outside of the house from which the little girl escaped with the fairy queen and her comrades. That should have been treated fancifully. The events pictured don't amount to anything; there is a sameness about them, nothing surprising happens, and not very much <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>pretty.</b> Worst of all is the poetry(?), which is interpolated to explain the narrative; that is beyond criticism. The Thanhouser Company has missed good opportunities in this film." [...] The strange inclusion of the question mark after poetry is not a note by Bowers, for it was actually written into the review itself in the edition. Though no other review mentions poetry.|$|E
2500|$|Gary Vincent, an {{employee}} of Funspot and now curator of the Classic Arcade Museum, {{came up with the}} idea of collecting the games in one spot to give visitors to the arcade a different way of understanding the games. Opened in the late 1990s, the American Classic Arcade Museum collects games built no later than 1987. When asked why 1987 was picked as the cut off date, Vincent replied, [...] "We set the cut off date as 1987 because <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>pretty</b> much about the time when we noticed that the videogame industry was starting to change. Instead of having fantasy-based games, puzzle-based, space shoot 'em up games or whatever, it seemed to switch over to more of what I call 'kick-punch-shoot' games." ...|$|E

6000|$|A {{hush fell}} over the dinner-table, and every ear was open and {{inclined}} as Cameron, the host, continued: [...] "No, I wouldn't say <b>that.</b> There <b>are</b> some things <b>that</b> <b>are</b> <b>pretty</b> well established--telepathy, for instance." ...|$|R
2500|$|Lind {{said there}} was no {{trepidation}} in taking on a gay role, and that she is [...] "really proud" [...] to portray Bianca. [...] "I am surprised that the gay community is still struggling and fighting so many years later," [...] she said. [...] "They are still fighting for basic human rights. I am excited {{to be a part of}} that fight." [...] Regarding most of Pine Valley being okay with Bianca being gay, Lind stated that she is [...] "a little curious" [...] to see some [...] "sort of real-life conflict arrive and see that some people in her small town do not accept her sexuality." [...] Lind clarified, [...] "In a sense, <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>pretty</b> relevant and controversial and true. Because Pine Valley is the exception, it’s a beautiful utopia right now. I wouldn’t mind attacking those issues that are happening in small towns right now." ...|$|E
2500|$|Rothenberg {{said he and}} {{his crew}} do some {{research}} with regard to depicting societies, such as the Grounders, within the series, but most of what is shown is based on his personal tastes. He enjoys the world-building aspect the most. [...] "Getting to create this universe from the language to the wardrobe to the tattoos ... we obviously get pretty deep into what the grounder spirituality is and means," [...] he stated. [...] "All of <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>pretty</b> awesome. So yes, we do some research as to how societies have evolved in the past {{but for the most part}} it's fiction." [...] Rothenberg said there are more than just men writing the show; there are several women [...] "writing hardcore sci-fi." [...] In 2015, two commander jackets were described as being [...] "made out of leather, metal, and fur". Debnam-Carey felt that the Grounder culture—the language, wardrobe, makeup and [...] "all the symbolic meaning behind that"—was [...] "one of the highlights" [...] for her. [...] "We explored it as much as we could as actors to break down its meaning, but the best thing about this was finally finding out all this backstory and fully creating this world," [...] she stated, adding they [...] "had three sets built just for the Grounders".|$|E
2500|$|... 20/20 {{also asked}} Black Swan editor Andy Weisblum for {{his take on}} the math. He responded that [...] "there are about 35 shots that are full body shots in the movie. Of those 35 shots, 12 are Natalie, {{and then the rest}} are Sarah. But over the overall film, Natalie did a lot more than that. I mean, she did most of the other shots. It was {{sometimes}} hard for me to tell the difference as the editor, it was so close." [...] Lane further reiterated the point that prior to the Oscar ceremony, she gave an interview with Glamour for an article titled The Real Black Swan. After this interview, a Black Swan producer contacted her: [...] "He asked if I would please not do any more interviews until after the Oscars because it was bad for Natalie's image ... They were trying to create this image, this facade, really, that Natalie had done something extraordinary. Something <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>pretty</b> much impossible ... to become a professional ballerina in a year and half." [...] Lane also emphasized that her criticism was not directed at Portman's acting: [...] "I think she is a really beautiful actress ... I loved working with her. And she was really focused on her character every day. I definitely think she deserves all the credit that she got with the Oscar." ...|$|E

Brief excerpt from interview: The instructor will write more than you. You get it back and are blown away with what did I do wrong?

6000|$|There was an {{interchange}} {{of books}} between the French and English priest. Pere Montrouzier lent, and finally gave, Martinet's 'Solution de Grands Problemes,' which Patteson calls 'a very interesting book, {{with a great}} deal of dry humour about it, not unlike Newman's more recent publications. [...] "It is," [...] he (Montrouzier) says, [...] "thought very highly of in France." [...] He is a well-read man, I should imagine, in his line; and <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>pretty</b> extensive, for he is a really scientific naturalist, something of a geologist, a good botanist, besides having a good acquaintance with ecclesiastical literature.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>pretty</b> clear also. There are evidently {{only two}} of them in it. The other is impersonating you at the office.

He changed his appearance as far as he could, and trusted that the likeness, which you could not fail to observe, would be put down to a family resemblance.
