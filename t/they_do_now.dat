5|$|Finally {{there is}} often a need to correct for the {{apparent}} movement of the stars. On the timescale of human civilisation the stars have largely maintained the same position relative to each other. Each night they appear to rotate around the celestial poles due to the Earth's rotation about its axis. However, the Earth spins rather like a spinning top. Not only does the Earth rotate, it wobbles. The Earth's axis takes around 25,800 years to complete one full wobble. The effect to the archaeoastronomer is that stars did not rise over the horizon in the past in the same places as they do today. Nor did the stars rotate around Polaris as <b>they</b> <b>do</b> <b>now.</b> In the case of the Egyptian pyramids, it has been shown they were aligned towards Thuban, a faint star in the constellation of Draco. The effect can be substantial over relatively short lengths of time, historically speaking. For instance a person born on 25 December in Roman times would have been born with the sun in the constellation Capricorn. In the modern period a person born on the same date would have the sun in Sagittarius due to the precession of the equinoxes.|$|E

25|$|The Mixtec {{people who}} live in the south of Puebla are part of an ethnic group which are still the {{dominant}} indigenous group in an area that stretches over Puebla, Oaxaca and the mountains of Guerrero. They are the fourth largest indigenous group in Mexico. The Sierra Mixteca region in Puebla is part of the Mixteca Baja region, which crosses into parts of Oaxaca as well. In the Mesoamerican period, the Mixtecs of Puebla dominated further north than <b>they</b> <b>do</b> <b>now</b> and archeologists classify “Mixteca-Puebla” art as distinct from other Mixtec arts and crafts. There are an estimated 6,700 Mixtecs living in Puebla, however, many have emigrated out of traditional Mixtec areas into other parts of the state, Mexico City and even the United States to work.|$|E
25|$|A {{frequent}} {{critique of}} the discipline is that the hypotheses of evolutionary psychology are frequently arbitrary and difficult or impossible to adequately test, thus questioning its status as an actual scientific discipline, for example because many current traits probably evolved to serve different functions than <b>they</b> <b>do</b> <b>now.</b> While evolutionary psychology hypotheses are difficult to test, evolutionary psychologists assert {{that it is not}} impossible. Part of the {{critique of the}} scientific base of evolutionary psychology includes a critique of the concept of the Environments of Evolutionary Adaptation. Some critics have argued that researchers know so little about the environment in which Homo sapiens evolved that explaining specific traits as an adaption to that environment becomes highly speculative. Evolutionary psychologists respond that they do know many things about this environment, including the facts that present day humans' ancestors were hunter-gatherers, that they generally lived in small tribes, etc.|$|E
500|$|Toscanini {{recognised}} {{that this}} was the view of many, but he believed the work to be Verdi's greatest opera; he said, [...] "I believe it will take years and years before the general public understand this masterpiece, but when they really know it they will run to hear it like <b>they</b> <b>do</b> <b>now</b> for Rigoletto and La traviata." ...|$|E

50|$|Early Elend albums {{utilized}} samplers and synthesizers {{to create}} a dense and horrifying orchestral sound. In their last three albums for the Winds Cycle, Elend's sound was broadened; <b>they</b> <b>did</b> <b>now</b> rely almost entirely on acoustic instruments and chamber orchestras instead of synthesizers, giving them a more full and natural sound. <b>They</b> <b>did</b> also include electronic and industrial elements in some of their pieces.|$|R
2500|$|The report criticized Perbix for {{reacting}} negatively on September 11, 2009, when Frazier {{told him}} a teacher had requested that his webcam be disabled, with Perbix writing to Frazier: [...] "teachers should not even be allowed to cover the cameras as <b>they</b> <b>do</b> <b>now</b> … theft track … does not record video, only a snapshot every 15 minutes. Is someone afraid that we are spying on them?" [...] Jason Hilt, district Supervisor of Instructional Technology, {{when he learned that}} TheftTrack could be activated without police involvement taped over his camera and shared his concern about remote webcam activation with Frazier and Director of Curriculum Services Steve Barbato.|$|E
2500|$|Indie Vision Music's Lee Brown {{said that}} [...] "Disciple {{has been around}} for a while. Because of this, it’s hard for {{anything}} <b>they</b> <b>do</b> <b>now</b> to feel completely unique. That being said, if O God Save Us All is more of the same, it’s more of the same done better. The album really shines in Disciple’s discography for several of the following reasons. First of all, the message of the album is laid out like a story that unfolds with each new chapter. The music is balanced and the flow of the album is very well done. There is a nice mix of radio-friendly, ballad, and too-hard-for-radio screaming. Plus, it doesn’t hurt that a song or two feel a little bit like Disciple’s great This Might Sting a Little album." ...|$|E
2500|$|Stallman has {{regularly}} given a talk entitled [...] "Copyright vs. Community" [...] {{where he}} reviews {{the state of}} DRM and names many of the products and corporations which he boycotts. His approach to DRM is best summed up by the FSF Defective by Design campaign. In the talks, he makes proposals for a [...] "reduced copyright" [...] and suggests a 10-year limit on copyright. He suggests that, instead of restrictions on sharing, authors be supported using a tax, with revenues distributed among them based on cubic roots of their popularity to ensure that [...] "fairly successful non-stars" [...] receive a greater share than <b>they</b> <b>do</b> <b>now</b> (compare with private copying levy which is associated with proponents of strong copyright), or a convenient anonymous micropayment system for people to support authors directly. He indicates that no form of non-commercial sharing of copies {{should be considered a}} copyright violation. He has advocated civil disobedience in a comment on Ley Sinde.|$|E

2500|$|In the 28 Tests that Bannerman played {{from then}} until 1893, he scored 1,108 runs {{at an average}} of 23.03, without ever scoring a hundred. [...] He often found his steady defence coupled {{at the top of the}} order with the almost all-out {{aggression}} of such partners as Hugh Massie, George Bonnor, Percy McDonnell and J.J. Lyons. [...] With the last-mentioned at Sydney in the 1891/92 Ashes series, Bannerman played a crucial role in securing the Test (and thus the series) for Australia, which had trailed on the first innings by 163 runs. [...] In the home team's second innings, Lyons and Bannerman put on 174 for the first wicket in 7½ hours, scoring 134 and 91 respectively. [...] Bannerman's knock spanned three days, scoring at a rate of twelve runs an hour. [...] As the bowlers of his time bowled almost twice the number of overs in an hour that <b>they</b> <b>do</b> <b>now,</b> his cumbersome scoring is astonishing. [...] The admittedly accurate William Attewell bowled 204 balls to him during this innings, only five of which brought runs. [...] The frustrated crowd was moved to barracking (the polite sort: they always referred to him as [...] "Good old Alick") and one poet to verse: ...|$|E

60|$|Whitney {{enjoyed the}} journey. He had {{understood}} that southern Scotland {{was the home}} of scientific agriculture, and in this respect the valleys came up to his expectations; but when they left them on foot, as <b>they</b> <b>did</b> <b>now</b> and then, <b>they</b> crossed barren, wind-swept spaces clothed with bent-grass and heather. In places, lonely hills rolled from horizon to horizon without sign of life except for the black-faced sheep and the grouse that skimmed the heath.|$|R
