40|$|The {{recursive}} {{structure of}} natural language {{was one of}} the principal, and most <b>telling,</b> <b>sources</b> <b>of</b> difficulty for associationist models of linguistic behaviour. It has, more recently, become a focus in the debate surrounding the generality of neural network models of language, which many would regard as the natural heirs of the associationist legacy. Can neural networks learn to handle recursive structures? If not, many would argue, neural networks can be ruled out a priori as viable models of language processing. In this paper, we shall reconsider the implications of natural language recursion for neural network models, and present a range of simulations in which recurrent neural networks are trained on very simple recursive structures. We suggest implications for theories of human language processing. 1 Introduction From its inception, cognitive science has paradigmatically eschewed finite state models of natural language processing. The existence of complex recursive langu [...] ...|$|R

40|$|First {{note that}} {{encryption}} provides {{no guarantee that}} a message is authentic. For example, if a message is encrypted with the one-time pad, the adversary can flip any of its bits by simply flipping the corresponding bit of the ciphertext. In any public-key encryption scheme, {{there is no way}} to <b>tell</b> the <b>source</b> <b>of</b> the message, because the key is public. Furthermore, the message can be modified in transit by the adversary in every encryption scheme we studied so far. Thus, encryption ensures secrecy, but can’t help you figure out who the message came from or what it was really meant to say. We need digital signatures for that. A digital signature scheme is a triple of probabilistic polynomial-time algorithms (Gen, Sig, Ver). The key generation algorithm Gen outputs (PK, SK) when given 1 k as input. The signing algorithm Sig takes SK and m as input, and outputs a signature σ. The verification algorithm Ver takes PK, m, σ as input and outputs 1 or 0 (or true/false, valid/invalid, etc.). We require that signatures produced by Sig verify as correct by Ver...|$|R

40|$|We have {{implemented}} Kima, an automated error correction system for concurrent logic programs. Kima corrects near-misses such as wrong variable occurrences {{in the absence}} of explicit declarations of program properties. Strong moding/typing and constraint-based analysis are turning to play fundamental roles in debugging concurrent logic programs as well as in establishing the consistency of communication protocols and data types. Mode/type analysis of Moded Flat GHC is a constraint satisfaction problem with many simple mode/type constraints, and can be solved efficiently. We proposed a simple and efficient technique which, given a non-well-moded/typed program, diagnoses the ``reasons'' of inconsistency by finding minimal inconsistent subsets of mode/type constraints. Since each constraint keeps track of the symbol occurrence in the program, a minimal subset also <b>tells</b> possible <b>sources</b> <b>of</b> program errors. Kima realizes automated correction by replacing symbol occurrences around the possible sources and recalculating modes and types of the rewritten programs systematically. As long as bugs are near-misses, Kima proposes a rather small number of alternatives that include an intended program. Comment: In M.

In this view, held by the majority of historians until the mid to late twentieth century, much of England was cleared of its prior inhabitants. If this 'traditional' viewpoint were to be correct, the genes of the later English people would have been overwhelmingly inherited from Germanic migrants.|$|R
