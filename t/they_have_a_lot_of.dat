25|$|People {{tend to be}} more optimistically biased {{when they}} believe they have more control over events than others. For example, {{people are more likely to}} think that they will not be harmed in a car {{accident}} if they are driving the vehicle. Another example is that if someone believes that <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> control over becoming infected with HIV, they are more likely to view their risk of contracting the disease to be low. Studies have suggested that the greater perceived control someone has, the greater their optimistic bias. Stemming from this, control is a stronger factor when it comes to personal risk assessments, but not when assessing others.|$|E

Commenting on the rigidity of his routine, Chabon said, [...] "There have been plenty of self-destructive rebel-angel novelists over the years, but writing is about getting your work done and getting your work done every day.

[...] Writing for the Sunday Mail, Steve Hendry assessed that the plot would serve to [...] "bring the arrogant and often spiteful Steph down a peg or two", humbling her. Stenson agreed that Steph's epilepsy would make her [...] "more understanding", inspiring thoughtfulness towards others, as opposed to her former rejection of those different to her. However, she observed that the condition may also serve to worsen her behaviour towards [...] "a chosen few." [...] The character's epilepsy was further explored in the Hollyoaks spin-off , in which Steph has a seizure and believes she is possessed by a spirit, almost causing her to drown.|$|E

2500|$|In {{contrast}} with commercial broadcasting, NPR's radio broadcasts do not carry traditional commercials, but has advertising {{in the form}} of brief statements from major sponsors which may include corporate slogans, descriptions of products and services, contact information such as website addresses and telephone numbers. These statements are called underwriting spots and, unlike commercials, are governed by specific FCC restrictions in addition to truth in advertising laws; they cannot advocate a product or [...] "promote the goods and services" [...] of for-profit entities. These restrictions apply only to radio broadcasts and not NPR's other digital platforms. When questioned on the subject of how corporate underwriting revenues and foundation grants were holding up during the recession, in a speech broadcast on C-SPAN before the National Press Club on March 2, 2009, then President and CEO Vivian Schiller stated: [...] "underwriting is down, it's down for everybody; this is the area that is most down for us, in sponsorship, underwriting, advertising, call it whatever you want; just like it is for all of media." [...] Hosts of the NPR program Planet Money stated the audience is indeed a product being sold to advertisers {{in the same way as}} commercial stations, saying: [...] "they are not advertisers exactly but, <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> the same characteristics; let's just say that." ...|$|E
2500|$|Lexa's {{relationship}} with Clarke {{is presented as}} intense, complex, {{and the one thing}} that manages to soften Lexa's outlook on life. Debnam-Carey said the characters progression from being allies to becoming romantic [...] "stems from a connection that they both share—which is similar experiences and similar positions" [...] in that they are [...] "both very young leaders with great authority, a lot of responsibility. They have to lead a huge amount of people. <b>They</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> expectations riding on them." [...] She said the sudden responsibilities they faced, the need to make the right decisions, and the fact they both grieved over past lovers helped connect them further, and it is a connection they do not have with others. Rothenberg originally stated that while he would not go as far {{to say that it was}} love at first sight for Lexa, [...] "it definitely was a bit of a thunderbolt moment for her when she first saw Clarke." [...] He said Clarke's attraction to Lexa [...] "developed a little bit more slowly, but by the end [...] they were very much intrigued at the possibility of a romantic relationship." [...] He later said [...] "Lexa was definitely smitten—like love at first sight, probably", but maintained it took longer for Clarke to develop romantic feelings for Lexa.|$|E
2500|$|Although reviewers {{have read}} {{political}} intonations into the album's ostensible themes, deeming it “unashamedly prog in its ambition and dimensions”, Turner {{is reluctant to}} admit to such an agenda. [...] "I'd hesitate to call the record 'political' because Isis has never taken a public political stand on anything. At the same time, it's intended to draw a parallel between the system that Bentham created and what's {{going on in the}} world right now". Likewise, he notes that the album is “absolutely not about a political agenda. I always try to write about stuff that is specific to my life during the time I write an album. And I try to find things that I'm emotionally and intellectually attached to. We've never been a political band. But right now politics are such a great importance. You can travel everywhere and you simply cannot ignore them. And so this is one of the main things that have been occupying my mind during the creation of this record. So beyond these things just being interesting themselves <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>lot</b> <b>of</b> relevance to what's {{going on in the world}} right now [...] I think these things are relevant to everybody's lives and specifically to me and this band and what we experienced through living in this country over the last couple of years. And also I think my lyrics are so abstract and fragmented sometimes that I feel like those things are a better representation of what I'm writing about than printed lyrics might be.” Despite his denial that Panopticon is politically motivated, Turner does refer to the then-incumbent George W. Bush administration's tenure as a source of inspiration; about how Bentham's essay bore relevance to “hit home in terms of how [...] is treating its own citizens outside and within the country.” ...|$|E
