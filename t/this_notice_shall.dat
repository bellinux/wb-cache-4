A meeting of Cork Corporation was held that afternoon at the Corn Exchange. Councillor J.J.

Walsh said that while the people of Cork had been suffering, [...] "not a single word of protest was uttered , and today, after the city has been decimated, he saw no better course than to add insult to injury". Councillor Michael Ó Cuill, alderman Tadhg Barry and the Lord Mayor agreed with Walsh's sentiments. The members resolved that the Lord Mayor should send a telegram asking for the intervention of the European governments and the USA.|$|E

40|$|On September 1, 1983, {{over the}} Sea of Japan, a Soviet Union {{military}} aircraft destroyed a Korean Air Lines Boeing 747 {{en route from}} Kennedy Airport in New York to Seoul, South Korea. All 269 persons on board the plane were killed. The Warsaw Convention (2 ̆ 2 Convention 2 ̆ 2), a multilateral treaty governing the international carriage of passengers, baggage, and cargo by air, provides a per passenger damage limitation for personal injury or death. The Convention further provides that passenger tickets must include notice of this limitation, and a private accord among airlines known as the Montreal Agreement (2 ̆ 2 Agreement 2 ̆ 2) states that <b>this</b> <b>notice</b> <b>shall</b> be in print size no smaller than 10 -point type. In Chan v. Korean Air Lines, Ltd., 2 ̆ 7 the United States Supreme Court held that international air carriers do not lose {{the benefit of the}} Warsaw Convention 2 ̆ 7 s damages limitation if they fail to provide notice of that limitation. Accordingly, the liability of Korean Air Lines was limited to 75, 000 per passenger. This Note first explores the majority and concurring opinions in Chan and concludes that the Court erred in enabling a carrier to benefit from the Warsaw Convention 2 ̆ 7 s damage limitation when the carrier has failed to warn its passengers of that limitation. This Note further discusses how the Court created a confusing and disturbing precedent by failing to interpret the Montreal Agreement in conjunction with the Warsaw Convention, and by wrongly relying on a literal reading of the Warsaw Convention. for its conclusions. Finally, this Note asserts that the concurrence in Chan correctly resolved the fundamental issue by examining the drafting history of the Convention and concluding that an international air carrier cannot receive the benefit of the Convention 2 ̆ 7 s damage limitation if it fails to provide adequate notice of that limitation on passenger tickets. The concurrence failed, however, to appreciate the relationship between the Montreal Agreement and the Convention and replaced a clear standard of adequate notice with an unclear standard...|$|E

40|$|In an {{illuminating}} new essay ‘Die Einheit des Erkenntnisvermögens bei Kant’ (Conant 2016 / 2017), James Conant critically addresses what {{he argues}} {{is a widespread}} assumption in modern philosophy, namely, the assumption that our rational capacity to know is a capacity that is somehow “added” or tacked on to the capacity that we humans share with other animals, that is, our receptive capacity for sensations, our sensibility. This is the so-called “additive” theory of cognition, more specifically {{of the relation between}} sensibility and the understanding. He addresses this assumption by looking at the main argument of Kant’s Transcendental Deduction. I quite agree with the general tenor of Conant’s paper, namely that the Deduction should not be read as if the two stems of knowledge, sensibility and understanding, were connected in the way suggested by what he aptly calls the “layer-cake conception of human mindedness” (2016 : 78 / 2017 a: 232), whereby concepts are somehow “added” or tacked on to pre-given manifolds of representations to constitute acts of cognition. This is not to say though that I agree with all of the arguments he presents in support of this critical view, or even with the main argument he mounts in support of undermining the layer-cake conception of human mindedness. I think Conant oversells his rightful critique of the layer-cake conception by underestimating the modal nature of Kant’s reasoning in the Deduction and the compatibility between it and a minimally or relatively nonconceptual interpretation. Conant thinks that a rejection of the layer-cake conception of human mindedness entails an unqualified rejection of nonconceptualism of any sort. I think there is a third possible route, which likewise rejects the layer-cake conception of human mindedness, but is still compatible with a kind of minimal nonconceptualism about the relation between sensibility and the understanding, which also avoids the problems of Conant’s own positive reading (which I come to {{in the course of this}} discussion). To put it succinctly, I think Conant’s reading of the Deduction is too strongly conceptualist, and unnecessarily so. In <b>this</b> <b>notice,</b> I <b>shall</b> address some of the main points on which I diverge from Conant’s reading...|$|R
