5|$|Much of {{the debate}} in the 2008 {{legislative}} session centered on crafting a budget for the 2008–2010 biennium, a period when the state was projected to encounter a shortfall of nearly $1 billion. Beshear expressed surprise that the budget issues consumed so much of the Assembly's time during the session, but admitted that the legislature had become much more independent of the governor <b>than</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>when</b> he was a legislator two decades earlier. He listed early childhood education and expanded health care for children among the priorities that he was unable to address in the session.|$|E

25|$|A 2005 DVD reissue of A Face in the Crowd {{includes}} a mini-documentary on the film, with comments from Schulberg and cast members Griffith, Franciosa, and Neal. In his interview, Griffith, revered for his wholesome image for decades, reveals {{a more complex}} side of himself. He recalls Kazan prepping him to shoot his first scene with Remick's teenaged baton twirler, who captivates Griffith's character {{on a trip to}} Arkansas. Griffith also expresses his belief that the film was far more popular and respected in more recent decades <b>than</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>when</b> originally released.|$|E

The problem under consideration is to determine whether <b>it</b> <b>is</b> easier for a third-grade child to understand a given meaning <b>when</b> that meaning <b>is</b> presented to him in spoken words <b>than</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>when</b> the meaning <b>is</b> presented in printed words...|$|R
50|$|Hysteresis {{can also}} occur during {{physical}} adsorption processes. In {{this type of}} hysteresis, the quantity adsorbed <b>is</b> different <b>when</b> gas <b>is</b> being added <b>than</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>when</b> being removed. The specific causes of adsorption hysteresis are still an active area of research, but <b>it</b> <b>is</b> linked to differences in the nucleation and evaporation mechanisms inside mesopores. These mechanisms are further complicated by effects such as cavitation and pore blocking.|$|R

25|$|Within Iraq, Annandale {{collected}} his specimens from a sandy lake-bed deposit, in {{the vicinity}} of Nasiriyah on the Euphrates. Eames and Wilkins found the species in borings made in the Hammar Marshes, and Plaziat and Younis found it in other localities of the Hammar Formation; they described it as a typical species of this formation. The deposits in Iraq where the species has been found are in brackish habitat (although Annandale believed the deposits to be freshwater, this was due to reworking), toward the outer edge of tidal influence in the Euphrates and Tigris. Much of the species' former habitat, as evidenced by subfossil remains, is now less brackish <b>than</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>when</b> the fossils were deposited, meaning it is less likely to be extant in such places.|$|E
500|$|The {{concentration}} {{of carbon dioxide}} in the atmosphere today is much lower <b>than</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>when</b> plants emerged onto land during the Ordovician and Silurian periods. Many monocots like maize and the pineapple and some dicots like the Asteraceae have since independently evolved pathways like Crassulacean acid metabolism and the [...] carbon fixation pathway for photosynthesis which avoid the losses resulting from photorespiration in the more common [...] carbon fixation pathway. These biochemical strategies are unique to land plants.|$|E
500|$|Tillman {{had been}} re-elected in 1901 and 1907. By 1912, the Democratic nominee, {{who would be}} elected by the {{overwhelming}} Democratic majority in the legislature, was determined by a primary. A primary was also used for governor, and Tillman ran {{at the same time}} as Governor Cole Blease, who also sought re-election. Blease, also an outspoken white supremacist, had entered politics as a Tillmanite legislator in 1890, and breaking from him, adopted similar techniques to Tillman's to appeal to poor farm workers and mill hands. Tillman faced two opponents in his re-nomination bid—his control over South Carolina politics had deteriorated over the years, and he had moved towards the Conservatives. He had not endorsed Blease in 1910. The two men reached an agreement that Tillman would remain neutral in the governor's race in 1912, but Tillman became convinced Blease could not win against former state chief justice Ira B. Jones. Both sides claimed to have letters from Tillman endorsing their candidate, but three days before the primary, Tillman condemned Blease and endorsed Jones. Blease, outraged, alleged betrayal, accused Tillman of [...] "insane jealousy", and said of the senator, [...] "possibly his mind has become more diseased of late <b>than</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>when</b> I had my last talk with his confidential physician". Both men were re-elected.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. We {{consider}} two Bayesian {{agents who}} learn from exogenously provided private signals, {{as well as}} the actions of the other. Our main finding is that increased interaction between the agents can lower the speed of learning: when both agents observe each other, learning <b>is</b> significantly slower <b>than</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>when</b> one only observes the other. This slowdown is driven by a process in which a consensus on the wrong action causes the agents to discount new contrary evidence...|$|R

The solution {{is to provide a}} small amount of very fast memory known as a CPU cache which holds recently accessed data. As long as the data that the CPU needs are in the cache, the performance <b>is</b> much higher <b>than</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>when</b> the cache has to get the data from the main memory.|$|R
50|$|Wood <b>is</b> {{stronger}} <b>when</b> stressed {{along the}} grain (longitudinally) <b>than</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>when</b> stressed across the grain (radially and tangentially). Wood is a natural composite material; parallel strands of cellulose fibers are held together by a lignin binder. These long chains of fibers make the wood exceptionally strong by resisting stress and spreading the load over {{the length of the}} board. Furthermore, cellulose is tougher than lignin, a fact demonstrated by the relative ease with which wood can be split {{along the grain}} compared to across it.|$|R
2500|$|In a 2004 {{interview}} (published 9 December), Flew, then 81 years old, {{said that}} he had become a deist. In the article Flew states that he has renounced his long-standing espousal of atheism by endorsing a deism of the sort that Thomas Jefferson advocated ("While reason, mainly in the form of arguments to design, assures us that there is a God, there is no room either for any supernatural revelation of that God or for any transactions between that God and individual human beings"). [...] Flew stated that [...] "the most impressive arguments for God’s existence are those that are supported by recent scientific discoveries" [...] and that [...] "the argument to Intelligent Design is enormously stronger <b>than</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>when</b> I first met it". The argument of ID is that evidenced objects and physical concepts are either too simple or too complex to be simply natural, which ever of the two extremes one chooses to be the hallmark of design by an outside intelligence. He also answered in the affirmative to Habermas's question, [...] "So of the major theistic arguments, such as the cosmological, teleological, moral, and ontological, the only really impressive ones that you take to be decisive are the scientific forms of teleology?". He supported the idea of an Aristotelian God with [...] "the characteristics of power and also intelligence", stating that the evidence for it was stronger than ever before. He rejected the idea of an afterlife, of God as the source of good (he explicitly states that God has created [...] "a lot of" [...] evil), and of the resurrection of Jesus as a historical fact, although he has allowed a short chapter arguing in favor of Joshua's/Jesus' resurrection to be added into his latest book.|$|E
2500|$|Gary Marshall of TechRadar commented in 2016 that [...] "Where Office {{tries to}} do {{everything}} imaginable, Google's suite is much more basic. That said, it's much more powerful <b>than</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>when</b> the package debuted in 2006, but the emphasis on simplicity and speed remains." [...] Marshall wrote that [...] "We wouldn't want to craft a massive, complicated manuscript in Docs, but then that isn't what Docs is designed to do. It's a fast and user-friendly way to create everyday documents and to share them with colleagues and clients", and that fellow service Google Sheets [...] "covers the most common Excel functions [...] but doesn't have the power of Microsoft's offering". Marshall praised collaboration for being [...] "effortless", and praised importing of external file formats and making those editable and collaborative for being a [...] "big selling point". PC Magazines Eric Grevstad wrote that [...] "what's online is what you get", adding that [...] "configuring them to [...] is a rigmarole". He stated that the package was [...] "an illustration of software's version of the 80/20 rule [...] 80 percent of users will never need more than 20 percent of the features". He stated that [...] "comparing [...] to Office 2016 is like bringing a handgun to a cannon fight [...] Microsoft's PC-based suite is designed to have almost every feature anyone might ever need; Google's online suite is designed to have most features most people use daily." [...] Tom's Hardwares James Gaskin wrote that [...] "like most Google products, it can claim the cleanest and most minimal interface in the market", and [...] "No other suite except Office 365 can {{get close to the}} ease of collaboration Google provides. And even Microsoft's product trails by a wide margin as changes only appear in real-time in Word 2016, not the other apps". Conclusively, he wrote: [...] "The progress made between the first Google App release and now has been considerable. As the world moves to more and more mobile computing, Google has a distinct advantage. But tradition dies hard, and those who build more than basic documents, spreadsheets, and presentations will remain tied to their desktops and laptops for the time being." ...|$|E

5000|$|As {{a result}} of their porosity, {{sedimentary}} strata are compacted by overlaying sedimentary layers after deposition.

50|$|It's {{essential}} {{to note that}} the autoclave is far more dangerous <b>when</b> the pressure <b>is</b> low <b>than</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>when</b> the pressure <b>is</b> high. This is because the higher pressures create frictional forces that tend to make the door ring very hard to move. In some instances, hydraulic cylinders have buckled rather than turn the ring. At lower pressures, the ring can be moved, and there is enough stored energy in the vessel to ruin someone's day completely. Properly designed autoclaves incorporate several additional interlocks for added assurance. These extra interlocks are comparatively inexpensive and should always be designed to be failsafe.|$|R
