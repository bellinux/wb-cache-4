5|$|Muscle cells (myocytes) {{form the}} active {{contractile}} tissue of the body. Muscle tissue functions to produce force and cause motion, either locomotion or movement within internal organs. Muscle is formed of contractile filaments and is separated into three main types; smooth muscle, skeletal muscle and cardiac muscle. Smooth muscle has no striations when examined microscopically. It contracts slowly but maintains contractibility {{over a wide}} range of stretch lengths. It is found in such organs as sea anemone tentacles and the body wall of sea cucumbers. Skeletal muscle contracts rapidly but has a limited range of extension. It is found in the movement of appendages and jaws. Obliquely striated muscle is intermediate between the other two. The filaments are staggered and <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>type</b> of muscle found in earthworms that can extend slowly or make rapid contractions. In higher animals striated muscles occur in bundles attached to bone to provide movement and are often arranged in antagonistic sets. Smooth muscle is found in the walls of the uterus, bladder, intestines, stomach, oesophagus, respiratory airways, and blood vessels. Cardiac muscle is found only in the heart, allowing it to contract and pump blood round the body.|$|E

2500|$|The first fossil {{remains of}} {{what we now know}} as Montanoceratops were {{discovered}} on the Blackfeet Indian Reservation, west of Buffalo Lake, Montana in the St. Mary River Formation. It was collected in 1916 by Barnum Brown and Peter C. Kaisen of the American Museum of Natural History from terrestrial sediments that were deposited during the Maastrichtian stages of the Cretaceous period, approximately 70 million years ago.

2500|$|An {{excess of}} {{acetylene}} creates a carbonizing flame. This flame {{is characterized by}} three flame zones; the hot inner cone, a white-hot [...] "acetylene feather", and the blue-colored outer cone. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>type</b> of flame observed when oxygen is first added to the burning acetylene. The feather is adjusted and made ever smaller by adding increasing amounts of oxygen to the flame. A welding feather is measured as 2X or 3X, with X being {{the length of the}} inner flame cone. The unburned carbon insulates the flame and drops the temperature to approximately [...] The reducing flame is typically used for hard facing operations or backhand pipe welding techniques. The feather is caused by incomplete combustion of the acetylene to cause an excess of carbon in the flame. Some of this carbon is dissolved by the molten metal to carbonize it. The carbonizing flame will tend to remove the oxygen from iron oxides which may be present, a fact which has caused the flame to be known as a [...] "reducing flame".|$|E
