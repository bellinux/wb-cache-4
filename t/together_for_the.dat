5|$|In 1983, an {{extended}} cut {{was released on}} VHS and premiered on the ABC television network. It added roughly 12minutes to the film.

This version was released by Paramount in late 1983 on VHS, Betamax, and Laserdisc.|$|E

Chris Cornell and Tom Morello shared the stage <b>together</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> first time in seven years, among many musicians, at the 2013 Rock and Roll Hall of Fame concert. Cornell also joined Morello on stage on September 26, 2014, guesting on his solo Seattle show.

5|$|On 12 November, in New York, Harrison, Starr and McCartney came <b>together</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> last time. Less {{than three}} weeks later, on 29 November 2001, Harrison died at a friend's home in Los Angeles, aged 58. He was cremated at Hollywood Forever Cemetery and his funeral {{was held at the}} Self-Realization Fellowship Lake Shrine in Pacific Palisades, California. His ashes were then {{scattered}} in the Ganges and Yamuna rivers near Varanasi, India, by his close family in a private ceremony according to Hindu tradition. He left almost £100million in his will.|$|E

5|$|Tracy's first post-MGM {{appearance}} was in The Mountain (1956) with Robert Wagner, who played his much younger brother (Wagner had earlier played {{his son in}} Broken Lance). The location filming in the French Alps proved a difficult experience, and he threatened to leave the project. His performance earned a BAFTA nomination for Best Foreign Actor. Tracy and Hepburn then paired <b>together</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> eighth time in the office-based comedy Desk Set (1957).

5|$|A {{free agent}} in March 2001, Henderson {{returned}} to the Padres. During the 2001 season, he broke three major league career records and reached an additional major career milestone. He broke Babe Ruth's record of 2,062 career walks, Ty Cobb's record of 2,245 career runs, and Zack Wheat's record of 2,328 career games in left field, and {{on the final day}} of the season collected his 3,000th career hit, a leadoff double off Rockies pitcher John Thomson. That final game was also Padre Tony Gwynn's last major league game, and Henderson had originally wanted to sit out so as not to detract from the occasion, but Gwynn insisted that Henderson play. After scoring the game's first run, Henderson was removed from the lineup. With Gwynn having 3,141 hits, it was just the second time in Major League history that a pair of teammates each had 3,000 career hits; Ty Cobb and Tris Speaker had previously played many games <b>together</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> 1928 A's.|$|E

5|$|Both of the {{principal}} French squadrons departed Brest on 13 December, remaining <b>together</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> first two days before dividing in pursuit of separate British merchant convoys on 15 December. The squadron under Leissègues clashed with the convoy's escort, before breaking off and sailing south for the French Caribbean, where Leissègues was intending to land the 1,000 soldiers carried aboard as reinforcements for the garrison at Santo Domingo, via the Azores. The voyage was long and difficult, Leissègues struggling through winter storms that divided his squadron and inflicted severe damage to his ships. Arriving at Santo Domingo on 20 January, Leissègues disembarked his troops and began extensive repairs to his ships in preparation for raiding cruises in the Caribbean.|$|E
5|$|Burnley's 30-game unbeaten streak {{during the}} 1920–21 season stood as a Football League record for 83 years {{until it was}} surpassed by Arsenal, who {{completed}} the entire season without losing in the 2003–04 campaign. After the defeat to Bradford City on 28 August 1920, Burnley did not lose another match at Turf Moor until 11 February 1922, when they were beaten 1–2 by Blackburn Rovers. In the same match, the halfback line of Tommy Boyle, George Halley and Billy Watson—used in 25 first-team games during 1920–21—was seen for the final time, having played <b>together</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> first time in September 1913. The majority of the championship-winning team remained intact going into the 1921–22 season, although players such as David Taylor and Walter Weaver found themselves less involved in first-team matches.|$|E
5|$|Burton hired Danny Elfman, his {{collaborator}} on Pee-wee's Big Adventure and Beetlejuice, {{to compose}} the music score. For inspiration, Elfman was given The Dark Knight Returns. Elfman was worried, {{as he had}} never worked on a production this large in budget and scale. In addition, producer Jon Peters was skeptical of hiring Elfman, but was later convinced {{when he heard the}} opening number. Peters and Peter Guber wanted Prince to write music for the Joker and Michael Jackson to do the romance songs. Elfman would then combine the style of Prince and Jackson's songs <b>together</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> entire film score.|$|E

5|$|He was {{introduced}} to complex flamenco techniques by Spanish guitarist Paco de Lucía when the two shared a loft and performed <b>together</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> jet set in New York City in the early 1970s. In 1982, Laucke was selected by Andrés Segovia to perform for the PBS network at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City. He became Segovia's pupil, and studied with other classical guitar players including Julian Bream and Alirio Díaz. Laucke performed mainly on classical guitar until 1990, {{and from then on}} his concerts consisted solely of flamenco and new flamenco.|$|E
5|$|Higham theorises that Gregory {{believed}} {{that the end of}} the world was imminent, and that he was destined to be a major part of God's plan for the apocalypse. His belief was rooted in the idea that the world would go through six ages, and that he was living at the end of the sixth age, a notion that may have played a part in Gregory's decision to dispatch the mission. Gregory not only targeted the British with his missionary efforts, but he also supported other missionary endeavours, encouraging bishops and kings to work <b>together</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> conversion of non-Christians within their territories. He urged the conversion of the heretical Arians in Italy and elsewhere, as well as the conversion of Jews. Also pagans in Sicily, Sardinia and Corsica were the subject of letters to officials, urging their conversion.|$|E
5|$|Highly gregarious, western jackdaws are {{generally}} seen in flocks of varying sizes, though {{males and females}} pair-bond for life and pairs stay together within flocks. Flocks increase in size in autumn and birds congregate at dusk for communal roosting, with up to several thousand individuals gathering at one site. At Uppsala, Sweden, 40,000 birds have been recorded at a single winter roost with mated pairs often settling <b>together</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> night. Western jackdaws frequently congregate with hooded crows or rooks, the latter particularly when migrating or roosting. They have been recorded foraging with the common starling (Sturnus vulgaris), Northern lapwing (Vanellus vanellus), and common gull (Larus canus) in northwestern England. Flocks are targets of coordinated hunting by pairs of lanner falcons (Falco biarmicus), although larger groups are more able to elude the predators. Western jackdaws sometimes mob and drive off larger birds such as European magpies, common ravens, or Egyptian vultures (Neophron percnopterus); one gives an alarm call which alerts its conspecifics to gather and attack as a group. Occasionally, a sick or injured western jackdaw is mobbed until it is killed.|$|E

5|$|In 2000, {{the band}} {{released}} the cover album Renegades. The same year, growing tensions over {{the direction of}} the band prompted de la Rocha to quit, leading to the band's breakup. De la Rocha started a low-key solo career, {{while the rest of the}} band formed the rock supergroup Audioslave with Chris Cornell, then-former frontman of Soundgarden; Audioslave recorded three albums before disbanding in 2007. The same year, Rage Against the Machine announced a reunion and performed <b>together</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> first time in seven years at the Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival in April 2007. Up until 2011, the band continued to perform at more live venues and festivals around the world. In 2016, Morello, Commerford and Wilk formed a new band, Prophets of Rage, with Chuck D and B-Real. In 2017, they were nominated for induction into the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame in their first year of eligibility.|$|E
5|$|Life on Brook Farm {{was based}} on {{balancing}} labor and leisure while working <b>together</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> benefit of the greater community. Each member could choose to do whatever work they found most appealing and all were paid equally, including women. Revenue for the community came from farming and from selling handmade products like clothing {{as well as through}} fees paid by the many visitors to Brook Farm. The main source of income was the school, which was overseen by Mrs. Ripley. A pre-school, primary school, and a college preparatory school attracted children internationally and each child was charged for his or her education. Adult education was also offered.|$|E
5|$|Mehldau's first {{recording}} was for Hollyday's The Natural Moment in 1991; {{his first}} tour of Europe was {{also with the}} saxophonist that year. Mehldau's interest in classical music returned {{when he was in}} his early twenties, and spurred him into developing his left-hand playing. He led his own trio from at least 1992, when he played at New York's Village Gate. Mehldau also played as sideman with a variety of musicians around this time. His performances with saxophonist Perico Sambeat included a tour of Europe early in 1993, and Mehldau's first released recordings as co-leader, from a May concert in Barcelona. Mehldau also toured for 18 months with saxophonist Joshua Redman. This association began in 1993, but they had played together for a short period the previous year. Redman and his band attracted attention, with their 1994 album Moodswing also aiding Mehldau's profile. They also played <b>together</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> soundtrack to the 1994 film Vanya on 42nd Street, for which Redman wrote the music.|$|E
