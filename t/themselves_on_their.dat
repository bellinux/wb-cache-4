5|$|After {{the recent}} Polish Campaign, the German Army staff {{analysis}} had been rigorous in its analysis of that battle. The Army's General Staff had assessed {{the problems of}} leadership, tactics, command and control to improve effectiveness. It appears that Schumacher's fighter units did not {{do the same and}} were too busy congratulating <b>themselves</b> <b>on</b> <b>their</b> success. There is little evidence that the Luftwaffe took anything like the Army's approach in Poland, following their own victory at Heligoland Bight. The historian for the Luftwaffes General Staff noted it was only exploited for propaganda, despite the operational problems and warnings the battle had flagged for attacker and defender.|$|E
5|$|In the 18th century, Shakespeare became {{associated}} with rising British nationalism, and Boydell tapped {{into the same}} mood that many other entrepreneurs were exploiting. Shakespeare appealed not only to a social elite who prided <b>themselves</b> <b>on</b> <b>their</b> artistic taste, {{but also to the}} emerging middle class who saw in Shakespeare's works a vision of a diversified society. The mid-century Shakespearean theatrical revival was probably most responsible for reintroducing the British public to Shakespeare. Shakespeare's plays were integral to the theatre's resurgence at this time. Despite the upsurge in theatre-going, writing tragedies was not profitable, and thus few good tragedies were written. Shakespeare's works filled the gap in the repertoire, and his reputation grew as a result. By the end of the 18th century, one out of every six plays performed in London was by Shakespeare.|$|E

5|$|The {{influences}} between Scotland and Donegal went {{both ways}} and were furthered {{by a wave}} of immigration from Donegal to Scotland in the 19th century (the regions share common names of dances), as {{can be heard in}} the volume of strathspeys, schottisches, marches, and Donegal's own strong piping tradition, has influenced and been influenced by music, and by the sounds, ornaments, and repertoire of the Píob Mhór, the traditional bagpipes of Ireland and Scotland. There are other differences between the Donegal style and the rest of Ireland. Instruments such as the tin whistle, flute, concertina and accordion were very rare in Donegal until modern times. Traditionally the píob mór and the fiddle were the only instruments used and the use of pipe or fiddle music was common in old wedding customs. Migrant workers carried their music to Scotland and also brought back a number of tunes of Scottish origin. The Donegal fiddlers may well have been the route by which Scottish tunes such as Lucy Campbell, Tarbolton Lodge (Tarbolton) and The Flagon (The Flogging Reel), that entered the Irish repertoire. These players prided <b>themselves</b> <b>on</b> <b>their</b> technical abilities, which included playing in higher positions (fairly uncommon among traditional Irish fiddlers), and sought out material which would demonstrate their skills.|$|E

25|$|In California, Spanish {{settlement}} {{began in}} 1769 {{with the establishment}} of the Presidio and Catholic mission of San Diego. 20 more missions were established along the California coast by 1823, along with military Presidios and civilian communities. Settlers in California tended to stay close to the coast and outside of the California interior. The California economy was based on agriculture and livestock. In contrast to central New Spain, coastal colonists found little mineral wealth. Some became farmers or ranchers, working for <b>themselves</b> <b>on</b> <b>their</b> own land or for other colonists. Government officials, priests, soldiers, and artisans settled in towns, missions, and presidios.|$|E

Nastasi stayed with Non-Fiction for a short time before leaving to embark on a brief stint with Murphy's Law. Nastasi's position in Mucky Pup was filled by band friend Sean Kilkenny. After a year or so, Neabore and Kilkenny left to form the band Dog Eat Dog and Nastasi returned to Mucky Pup while simultaneously joining Dog Eat Dog as well.|$|E

25|$|Wealthy Loyalists wielded great {{influence}} in London and {{were successful in}} convincing the British that the majority view in the colonies was sympathetic toward the Crown. Consequently, British planners pinned {{the success of their}} strategies on popular uprisings of Loyalists, which never transpired on the scale required. Historians have estimated that Loyalists made up only 15–20% of the population (vs. 40-45% Patriots) and that they continued to deceive <b>themselves</b> <b>on</b> <b>their</b> level of support as late as 1780. The British discovered that any significant level of organized Loyalist activity would require the continued presence of British regulars, which presented them with a major dilemma. The manpower that the British had available was insufficient to both protect Loyalist territory and counter American advances. The vulnerability of Loyalist militias was repeatedly demonstrated in the South, where they suffered strings of defeats to their Patriot neighbors. The most crucial juncture of this was at Kings Mountain, and the victory of the Patriot partisans irreversibly crippled Loyalist military capability in the South.|$|E
25|$|Despite {{having a}} slight first-innings lead, Derbyshire lost {{within three days}} against Middlesex at Lord's, having been bowled out for just 60 in their second innings, their lowest total against Middlesex. Surrey's {{first game of the}} season ended as a draw against Somerset, in part as a result of play being lost due to rain. Durham {{suffered}} a change in fortunes, falling to a heavy defeat against Warwickshire, who bowled them out for 94 after setting a target of 413 to win. Nottinghamshire picked up their first win of the season against Derbyshire, who had yet to win <b>themselves</b> <b>on</b> <b>their</b> return to Division One. Surrey drew their second consecutive game at The Oval, this time against Sussex, on a pitch that appeared to favour batting. Durham fell to a second consecutive defeat when Yorkshire set a record for the highest successful chase at Chester-le-Street. Warwickshire's tenth-wicket partnership denied Somerset their first victory of the season, holding out for 78 minutes in a match that was somewhat overshadowed by a series of questionable umpiring decisions. Middlesex, with two wins out of two, remained {{at the top of the}} table at the end of April, eight points clear of Warwickshire.|$|E
25|$|We hear {{little of}} Tyndaris under Roman government, {{but it appears}} to have been a flourishing and {{considerable}} city. Cicero calls it nobilissima civitas and we learn from him that the inhabitants had displayed their zeal and fidelity towards the Romans upon many occasions. Among others they supplied naval forces for the armament of Scipio Africanus the Younger, a service for which he repaid them by restoring to them a statue of Mercury which had been carried off by the Carthaginians and which continued as an object of great veneration in the city, until it was stolen by the rapacious Verres. Tyndaris was also one of seventeen cities selected by the Roman senate, apparently as an honorary distinction, to contribute to certain offerings to the temple of Venus at Eryx. In other respects it had no peculiar privileges, and was in the condition of an ordinary municipal town, with its own magistrates, local senate, etc., but was certainly in the time of Cicero one of the most considerable places in the island. It, however, suffered severely from the exactions of Verres and the inhabitants, to revenge <b>themselves</b> <b>on</b> <b>their</b> oppressor, publicly demolished his statue as soon as he had quit the island.|$|E

500|$|Defence {{continued}} {{to dominate the}} game, however, as in 1928–29, the league averaged less than three goals per game. [...] Canadiens goaltender George Hainsworth set what remains a league record with 22 shutouts in only 44 games. [...] As a result, the league allowed {{the use of the}} forward pass in all zones beginning in 1929. Previously, forward passing was allowed only in the defensive and neutral zones. The change saw offence rise to 6.9 goals per game over the first third of the season as players began to park <b>themselves</b> <b>on</b> <b>their</b> opponent's goal crease. The league responded by introducing the offside rule early in the 1929–30 season, barring offensive players from entering their opponent's zone before the puck. [...] Despite this, Cooney Weiland, Dit Clapper and Howie Morenz all broke the 40-goal mark, the first players to do so since Joe Malone scored 44 in the NHL's first season.|$|E

James called the judges before him and, furious, ripped up the letter, patronisingly telling them that [...] "I well know the true and ancient common law {{to be the most}} favourable to Kings of any law in the world, to which law I do advise you my Judges to apply your studies". While all the other judges [...] "succumbed to royal pressure and, throwing <b>themselves</b> <b>on</b> <b>their</b> knees, prayed for pardon", Coke defended the letter and stated that [...] "When the case happens I shall do that which shall be fit for a judge to do".|$|E

500|$|The wind, tide and sea made it {{impossible}} for the Liverpool lifeboat to link up with the waiting tug for another tow, so the men were forced to start rowing home. [...] About twenty minutes later, as the boat reached the safer waters of the channel, the master elected to raise the foresail to help steady the vessel.

Rattlers master witnessed the incident, signaled to the New Brighton lifeboat, Willie and Arthur, which promptly turned around to come to the rescue. The men who were on the capsized boat directed the New Brighton lifeboat to first assist three others who were in more danger clinging to bits of wood in the sea. After picking up the survivors and one casualty, the New Brighton lifeboat was taken in tow by Rattler, which brought her back to New Brighton.
