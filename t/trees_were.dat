5|$|Across Ulithi, 29homes were destroyed, 64were damaged, and the {{remaining}} 33were intact. Of the 79non-residential structures, only 4were left standing. All four schools and medical buildings were destroyed, with nearly all medical supplies being washed away. Agriculture saw extensive losses with nearly the entire taro crop devastated and more than 75% of the food crop was ruined. Roughly 23% of the coconut <b>trees</b> <b>were</b> destroyed and 45% were damaged. It took approximately two years for the coconut crop to return to normal. Banana and breadfruit <b>trees</b> <b>were</b> temporarily useless, though they were in recoverable statuses.|$|E

5|$|Northeast of Eoline, {{the tornado}} {{weakened}} to EF2 intensity, continuing to cause significant damage as it crossed County Road 9, Alabama State Highway 5, and County Road 26, south of West Blocton.

5|$|The White County Emergency Management Director {{reported}} that an F0 tornado touched {{down in the}} southwest corner of White County near the Hall County line at the Wauka Valley Farms area, which formed on the tail end of a feeder band associated with the remnants of Hurricane Dennis. The tornado path width was estimated to be approximately 1/8 to 1/4mile wide. Significant damage was reported at the Wauka Valley Farms facility. Hundreds of <b>trees</b> <b>were</b> uprooted, and two barns were completely destroyed. One structure sustained room damage and a number of trees and power lines were also down along Town Creek road. Overall, in excess of 200 <b>trees</b> <b>were</b> down in the southwest part of the county.|$|E
5|$|Although {{no longer}} a {{tropical}} cyclone, {{the remnants of the}} depression brought moderate rainfall to parts of Sinaloa, Nayarit and Jalisco. High winds accompanied the rainfall and left about 50,000 residences without power. Several <b>trees</b> <b>were</b> downed and some structures sustained damage from fresh water flooding. Landslides occurred along major highways and significant structural damage was reported around Mazatl√°n. However, there was no loss of life or reports of injuries.|$|E
5|$|At Brooklyn, {{still an}} {{independent}} city from New York, houses were dismantled and uprooted trees blocked streets.

5|$|Beginning in {{the early}} 1970s, the Bureau of Land Management {{identified}} damaged riparian zones and began projects to restore natural habitat in those areas. Approximately 20,000 willow <b>trees</b> <b>were</b> planted along streams, small dams were put together to create more pools in the streams, and fencing was added to protect riparian zones from grazing. Next, the agency sought to reform land-use plans to change grazing practices, which became a complex and controversial project.|$|E
5|$|Brushes Clough and Pingot {{are former}} coal and {{sandstone}} quarries on Crompton Moor. During the 1970s, quarrying was halted, {{the land was}} reclaimed, and thousands of pine <b>trees</b> <b>were</b> planted. The area has since been used for recreation, including hiking, orienteering, and mountain biking. Brushes Clough Reservoir was constructed in the 19th century by the Oldham County Borough Council, using stone quarried from this site. The area is now managed by United Utilities.|$|E
5|$|During {{early years}} of colonisation, the {{surrounding}} <b>trees</b> <b>were</b> cut down and the river's gravel used in road making and construction of buildings.

However, due to the low population density in the area the reported damage was sparse, with one house destroyed, several others unroofed and hundreds of <b>trees</b> <b>were</b> snapped.|$|E
