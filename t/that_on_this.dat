5|$|On the day Alexander was born, Philip was {{preparing}} a siege {{on the city}} of Potidea on the peninsula of Chalcidice. That same day, Philip received news that his general Parmenion had defeated the combined Illyrian and Paeonian armies, and that his horses had won at the Olympic Games. It was also said <b>that</b> <b>on</b> <b>this</b> day, the Temple of Artemis in Ephesus, one of the Seven Wonders of the World, burnt down. This led Hegesias of Magnesia {{to say that it}} had burnt down because Artemis was away, attending the birth of Alexander. Such legends may have emerged when Alexander was king, and possibly at his own instigation, to show that he was superhuman and destined for greatness from conception.|$|E

25|$|The {{record was}} {{generally}} well received by critics, with some reviewers calling it more focused, tight and cohesive than Psychic Chasms and some praising the songcraft. However, some mixed reviews noted <b>that</b> <b>on</b> <b>this</b> album, Neon Indian {{lost much of}} the charm that was apparent on Psychic Chasms. The album peaked at No. 74 on the US Billboard 200, the band's first release {{to appear on the}} chart.|$|E
25|$|On this {{occasion}} Ali did not replace Abu Bakr as Amir-ul-Hajj. Ali was merely assigned a special mission {{to read the}} proclamation as according to Muhammad only a man from his own house could communate the revelation. We can thus say <b>that</b> <b>on</b> <b>this</b> occasion Abu Bakr represented the temporal side, while Ali represented the spiritual side. After the death of Muhammad {{there was no longer}} the question of any spiritual representation; the issue was only temporal representation, and for this Abu Bakr was the best choice as he had thus represented Muhammad even in his lifetime.|$|E
25|$|Meares later {{claimed that}} Maquinna, a {{chief of the}} Nuu-chah-nulth (Nootka) people, sold him some land {{on the shore of}} Friendly Cove in Nootka Sound, in {{exchange}} for some pistols and trade goods, and <b>that</b> <b>on</b> <b>this</b> land some kind of building was erected. These claims would become a key point in Britain's position during the Nootka Crisis. Spain strongly disputed both claims, and the true facts of the matter have never been fully established. The land and building aside, {{there is no doubt that}} Meares's men, and a group of Chinese workers they brought, built the sloop North West America. It was launched in September 1788, the first non-indigenous vessel built in the Pacific Northwest. The North West America would also play a role in the Nootka Crisis, being one of the vessels seized by Spain.|$|E

Comentale, Watt and Willman note that Fleming, through Bond, parallels Blofeld with Caligula, Nero and Hitler, and that this exemplifies Blofeld's actions as being on [...] "a titanic scale", {{as much of the}} criminal action was throughout the Bond series. Linder echoes this, noting that the crimes perpetrated are not against individuals per se, but entire nations or continents.|$|E
500|$|Grimm theorizes {{that the}} Helhest, a three legged-horse that roams the {{countryside}} [...] "as {{a harbinger of}} plague and pestilence" [...] in Danish folklore, was originally the steed of the goddess Hel, and <b>that</b> <b>on</b> <b>this</b> steed Hel roamed the land [...] "picking up the dead that were her due." [...] In addition, Grimm says that a wagon was once ascribed to Hel, with which Hel made journeys. Grimm says that Hel {{is an example of}} a [...] "half-goddess;" [...] "one who cannot be shown to be either wife or daughter of a god, and who stands in a dependent relation to higher divinities" [...] and that [...] "half-goddesses" [...] stand higher than [...] "half-gods" [...] in Germanic mythology.|$|E
500|$|By August 1770, {{just seven}} months after fire had {{destroyed}} his shop and goods, Johnson had re-established himself at 72 St. Paul's Churchyard—the largest shop on a street of booksellers—where he was to remain {{for the rest of}} his life. How Johnson managed this feat is unclear; he later cryptically told a friend that [...] "his friends came about him, and set him up again". An early 19th-century biography states that [...] "Mr. Johnson was now so well known, and had been so highly respected, <b>that</b> <b>on</b> <b>this</b> unfortunate occasion, his friends with one accord met, and contributed to enable him to begin business again". Chard speculates that Priestley assisted him since they were such close friends.|$|E

500|$|Herbert left Universal Classics and Jazz {{to pursue}} a less {{commercial}} and more personal musical direction and then self-financed a project in which she collaborated with Polar Bear's Seb Rochford in a production role. Between Me and the Wardrobe, an album of self-penned songs, was recorded in three days and was never intended for general release. The album was initially made available, in 2006, on Herbert's own Monkeywood label before being picked up by Blue Note Records, making Herbert their first UK signing in 30 years. In a five-starred review, Stuart Nicholson of The Observer said <b>that</b> <b>on</b> <b>this</b> album she [...] "lets the lyrics do the work for her. They are well thought out, moving between artfully constructed soft-focus simplicities to poignant yearning".|$|E
500|$|Initially {{after the}} {{construction}} of the Grand Palace, King Rama I ordered <b>that</b> <b>on</b> <b>this</b> location a copy of the Phra Thinang Sanphet Maha Prasat (พระที่นั่งสรรเพชญมหาปราสาท) should be built. The ancient throne hall was once located at the old palace in Ayutthaya, which had been destroyed 15 years earlier. This new throne hall was given the name Phra Thinang Amarinthara Pisek Maha Prasat (พระที่นั่งอมรินทราภิเษกมหาปราสาท; [...] ). Construction began in 1782 and was finished in 1784. This was the hall where King Rama I celebrated his full coronation ceremony. However, in 1789 the entire hall was struck by lighting and burnt to the ground. In its place King Rama I ordered {{the construction of}} a new hall, however under a different design and name.|$|E

Lopez stated that: [...] "They all express {{different}} moments in love and that's what this album was about. You know, sometimes it's difficult, sometimes it's amazing, sometimes overwhelming, sometimes you just don't know what to do. And I hope that I captured all of <b>that</b> <b>on</b> <b>this</b> album". MTV News noted that on the songs, Lopez might be [...] "giving us some insight about what she was dealing with in her personal life in the months before it was released".|$|E
40|$|In a unidimensional factor model it {{is assumed}} that the set of {{indicators}} <b>that</b> loads <b>on</b> <b>this</b> factor are conditionally independent given the latent factor. Two indicators are, however, never conditionally independent given (a set of) other indicators <b>that</b> load <b>on</b> <b>this</b> factor, as this would require one of the indicators <b>that</b> is conditioned <b>on</b> to correlate one with the latent factor. Although partial correlations between two indicators given the other indicators can thus never equal zero (Holland and Rosenbaum, 1986), we show in this paper that the partial correlations do need to be always weaker than the zero-order correlations. More precisely, we prove that the partial correlation between two observed variables <b>that</b> load <b>on</b> one factor given all other observed variables <b>that</b> load <b>on</b> <b>this</b> factor, is always closer to zero than the zero-order correlation between these two variables...|$|R

Five days later in another letter, Austen wrote she expected an [...] "offer" [...] from her [...] "friend" [...] and that [...] "I shall refuse him, however, unless he promises to give away his white coat", going on to write [...] "I will confide myself in the future to Mr Tom Lefroy, for whom I don't give a sixpence" [...] and refuse all others.

500|$|A remix {{version for}} the song, [...] "Jackie's In Love In The Club Mix", done by DJ Jackie Christie, was made {{available}} {{as one of}} the exclusive tracks of the American and European maxi-single release of the song.

[...] Peter Rauhofer's remix of the song was added along with the remixes of the follow-up single, [...] "Love Profusion". Another version, the [...] "Jason Nevins Mix", was included on Madonna's 2003 remix album Remixed & Revisited. Stephen Thomas Erlewine from Allmusic commented <b>that</b> <b>on</b> <b>this</b> remix, Madonna sounds as if she is {{out of step with the}} music of 2003.|$|E
500|$|Their second Dualtone album, Weather and Water, was {{released}} on June 28, 2005. Warned stated that during the recording sessions, Dualtone Records let them record what they wanted, with no interference or changes requested. In a review of Weather and Water in The Washington Post, it was noted <b>that</b> <b>on</b> <b>this</b> album, unlike their debut, {{the focus was on}} the music supporting lyrics, rather than the blues virtuosity of Movin' On. All three members of the band sang on Weather and Water, but Young's voice was noted for its [...] "dreamy, haunting quality". Their music through the Weather and Water album had been called Celtic-influenced and bluegrass-flavored by John Lehndorff of the Rocky Mountain News, but he noted that the band had a distinctly American sound despite their overseas origins. In early 2005, The Greencards performed at South by Southwest in Austin for the first time, and afterwards made their debut at the prestigious MerleFest.|$|E
