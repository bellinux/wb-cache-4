5|$|A print from Sheila's right {{ring finger}} {{was found on the}} right side of the butt, {{pointing}} downwards. A print from Bamber's right forefinger was on the rear end of the barrel, above the stock and pointing across <b>the</b> <b>gun.</b> He said he had used <b>the</b> <b>gun</b> to shoot rabbits. There were three other prints that could not be identified.|$|E
5|$|Although the casemates {{have been}} altered over the years, {{many of their}} {{original}} features survive. None of the guns remain in situ but the metal rails on which they traversed are still in place. The casemates {{were divided into two}} sections. During periods of high alert <b>the</b> <b>gun</b> crews would live next to their weapons in the casemates' rear, an area known as the war accommodation. The front of the casemate was <b>the</b> <b>gun</b> emplacement proper, where the loading and firing took place. The iron shield protecting each casemate was fitted with iron bars from which two mantlets made of thick lengths of rope were hung. These protected <b>the</b> <b>gun</b> crew from splinters and smoke. A loading bar above the gun-port enabled the crew to lift the heavy shells and cartridges up to the mouth of <b>the</b> <b>gun.</b> These were dispensed from the magazines below via lifts {{on either side of the}} emplacements.|$|E
50|$|With <b>The</b> <b>Guns</b> is <b>the</b> {{debut album}} from the Welsh rock quartet <b>The</b> <b>Guns.</b> Originally to be {{released}} in 2007 under German record label Motor Records, however, With <b>The</b> <b>Guns</b> was delayed for so long that <b>The</b> <b>Guns</b> decided to release it themselves. The album was finally released independently on July 17, 2009 through iTunes, and on August 31, 2009, 1000 copies With <b>The</b> <b>Guns</b> CDs became available from their official website. Produced by Richard Emanuel & Alex Wiltshire at The Lodge Productions studio, With <b>The</b> <b>Guns</b> produced two music videos, one of which is often played on UK music channel, Lava TV.|$|R

5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>guns</b> of Battery French {{were removed}} in 1917 for {{potential}} {{service on the}} Western Front; three of <b>the</b> <b>guns</b> were sent to France for use on field carriages, but sources indicate that none of <b>the</b> 6-inch <b>gun</b> regiments completed training before the Armistice and thus they did not see combat. <b>The</b> <b>guns</b> were not returned to Fort Kearny.|$|R
5|$|An assault is {{not caused}} if a {{defendant}} threatens {{to shoot the}} victim, but the victim is aware that <b>the</b> <b>gun</b> is not loaded or fake. However, {{it would be the}} actus reus of an assault if the victim wrongly believes <b>the</b> <b>gun</b> is, or may be, loaded. Since assault is a summary offence, no prosecutions take place for attempted assault. However, it is possible to commit attempts of aggravated forms of assault.|$|E
5|$|Breech-loading guns {{seemed to}} offer {{important}} advantages. A breech-loader could be reloaded without moving <b>the</b> <b>gun,</b> a lengthy process particularly if <b>the</b> <b>gun</b> then {{needed to be}} re-aimed. The Warriors Armstrong guns also had the virtue of being lighter than an equivalent smoothbore and, because of their rifling, more accurate. Nonetheless, the design was rejected because of problems which plagued breech-loaders for decades.|$|E
5|$|During {{the course}} of the fly-off, <b>the</b> <b>gun</b> turrets proved troublesome, their drive motors proving to be underpowered, and issues with wind blast through <b>the</b> <b>gun</b> slots were also encountered.

5|$|In October 1995, a Houston jury convicted Saldívar {{of first-degree}} murder and sentenced her {{to life in prison}} with the {{possibility}} of parole after 30 years in 2025.

5|$|Several press {{accounts}} {{reported that}} Timoshenko {{was shot by}} an unlicensed gun that came from Virginia. Previous reports indicated that <b>the</b> <b>gun</b> dealer had previously been indicted for his illegal gun sales, and that all the weapons found in the BMW were illegally obtained. <b>The</b> <b>gun</b> shop in question is now closed, and the dealer has been stripped of his license.

5|$|That <b>the</b> <b>gun</b> had a {{silencer}} on {{it during}} the murders was central to the prosecution's case. With the silencer, <b>the</b> <b>gun</b> was too long for Sheila to have turned <b>the</b> <b>gun</b> on herself. According to the prosecution, paint on the silencer could be matched to fresh scratch marks on the kitchen mantelpiece, assumed {{to have been made}} during a fight for <b>the</b> <b>gun.</b> That the silencer was found in <b>the</b> <b>gun</b> cupboard was important to the prosecution, because Sheila had no reason to return it to the cupboard before killing herself. But that it was found by one of the cousins who inherited part of the estate—days after the police had searched the house—has blighted the prosecution's case, even though it was accepted by a majority of the jury.|$|E

50|$|If <b>the</b> <b>guns</b> of {{a battery}} were widely separated, the firing data, {{computed}} for the DP, {{might have had}} to be corrected in azimuth for <b>the</b> various <b>guns.</b> These calculations could be performed in the plotting room and telephoned to the battery or be performed at <b>the</b> <b>guns.</b> If <b>the</b> <b>guns</b> were relatively close to each other, then it might be enough to point them all at the same azimuth, to fire a salvo in parallel with each other.|$|R
