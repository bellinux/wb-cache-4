5|$|According to Eliot {{the poetic}} {{aspects of the}} poem are {{grounded}} {{in the tradition of}} John Cleveland, Edward Benlowes, William Blake, and William Butler Yeats's early work. Additionally, many of the images are connected to the poetry of Stéphane Mallarmé. In terms of theology, Eliot is orthodox in his theory and relies primarily on the writings of St Augustine. There are some additional influences from the works of Thomas Browne and Saint John of the Cross. In applying these views upon society, Eliot was heavily influenced by the writings of Christopher Dawson and Dawson's reliance on understanding God as the first step <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>better</b> society.|$|E
5|$|In 1634, another tale with a trickster cat as hero was {{published}} in Giambattista Basile's collection Pentamerone although neither the collection nor the tale were published in France during Perrault's lifetime. In Basile, the lad is a beggar boy called Gagliuso (sometimes Cagliuso) whose fortunes are achieved {{in a manner similar}} to Perrault's Puss. However, the tale ends with Cagliuso, in gratitude to the cat, promising the feline a gold coffin upon his death. Three days later, the cat decides to test Gagliuso by pretending to be dead and is mortified to hear Gagliuso tell his wife to take the dead cat by its paws and throw it out the window. The cat leaps up, demanding to know whether this was his promised reward for helping the beggar boy <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>better</b> life. The cat then rushes away, leaving his master to fend for himself. In another rendition, the cat performs acts of bravery, then a fairy comes and turns him to his normal state to be with other cats.|$|E

5|$|Never Let Me Go premiered at the 37th annual Telluride Film Festival in September 2010, {{where the}} {{audience}} responded positively to its message.

5|$|Starting in April 2006, Bethesda {{released}} small {{packages of}} additional downloadable content (DLC) {{for the game}} from their website and over the Xbox Live Marketplace. The first update came {{as a set of}} specialized armor for Oblivions ridable horses; released on April 3, 2006. Although gamers generally displayed enthusiasm for the concept of micropayments for downloadable in-game content, many expressed their dissatisfaction at the price they had to pay for the relatively minor horse-armor package on the Internet and elsewhere. Hines assured the press that Bethesda was not going to respond rashly to customer criticism. New releases continued into late 2006, at lower prices with more substantial content, leading <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>better</b> reception in the gaming press. Other small DLC packs include a set of houses themed after the game's factions, a new dungeon, and new spells that were absent in the initial release. Oblivions final content pack was released October 15, 2007.|$|E

5|$|The Killer was {{director}} Woo's follow-up <b>to</b> <b>A</b> <b>Better</b> Tomorrow 2 which {{was released in}} 1987. The first cut of A Better Tomorrow 2 was too long for the studio so the film was edited within a week separately by both producer Tsui Hark and Woo. According to producer Terence Chang, Tsui Hark felt that John Woo ruined A Better Tomorrow 2 and asked Chang to fire Woo from the studio. When Chang refused, Hark began rejecting Woo's new film ideas, including ideas for films that would later be made, such as Bullet in the Head and Once a Thief.|$|E
5|$|The Ottomans' {{attempt to}} conquer new territories led <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>better</b> {{organized}} policy against them. The temporary {{union of the}} Eastern and Western Churches proclaimed by the Council of Florence in 1439 also created a favorable background for the concentration of Christian forces. Christendom found its champion in John Hunyadi who gained a series of victories over the Ottomans after 1441. For instance, in 1442 he routed an Ottoman army that had been devastating Transylvania. Through his last victory over Mehmed II at the siege of Belgrade (in modern Serbia) in 1456, he saved the kingdom from Ottoman occupation for several decades. During the reign of his son, Matthias I of Hungary (14581490), the Ottomans launched only one serious attack against Transylvania in 1479 when they were defeated at Câmpul Pâinii.|$|E
5|$|The game {{begins in}} a city on the planet Efate. Here, as on all explorable planets in this game, the player observes the party and its {{surroundings}} from a directly overhead {{point of view and}} issues commands via hotkeys or clickable icons displayed onscreen. The explorable terrain of planets is limited to certain cities and immediately adjacent regions. Cities feature several types of buildings that are a recurrent feature on most planets, including a store for purchasing or selling armor, weapons and other items, a library, hospital, police station, and a starport for launching and outfitting a spaceship. Some cities host additional visitable buildings which may include a tavern or a hotel in which important non-player characters are located. Building types are color-coded for easier player identification. The player directs the party's movements and issues commands to perform various actions such as communicating with non-player characters, using objects or firing a weapon. Combat takes place in real-time and requires the player to direct individual party members to target opponents and fire their weapons, reload, or move <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>better</b> position.|$|E

5|$|X-ray {{crystallography}} has led <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>better</b> {{understanding of}} chemical bonds and non-covalent interactions. The initial studies revealed the typical radii of atoms, and confirmed many theoretical models of chemical bonding, {{such as the}} tetrahedral bonding of carbon in the diamond structure, the octahedral bonding of metals observed in ammonium hexachloroplatinate (IV), and the resonance observed in the planar carbonate group and in aromatic molecules. Kathleen Lonsdale's 1928 structure of hexamethylbenzene established the hexagonal symmetry of benzene and showed a clear difference in bond length between the aliphatic C–C bonds and aromatic C–C bonds; this finding led {{to the idea of}} resonance between chemical bonds, which had profound consequences for the development of chemistry. Her conclusions were anticipated by William Henry Bragg, who published models of naphthalene and anthracene in 1921 based on other molecules, an early form of molecular replacement.|$|E

25|$|The {{majority}} of Oriental carpets, however, {{continue to be}} depicted as objects with visual appeal, without political connotations, but ignoring their original cultural context.

Whilst Islamic carpets initially served to adorn Renaissance paintings, later on the paintings contributed <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>better</b> understanding of the carpets. Comparative art historical research on Oriental carpets in Renaissance painting thus adds another facette, and leads <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>better</b> understanding of the highly multifaceted, and sometimes ambivalent, image of the Ottomans during the Western European Renaissance.|$|E
