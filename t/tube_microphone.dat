500|$|Jason Corsaro, the record's audio engineer, persuaded Rodgers to use digital recording, a new {{technique}} at the time which Corsaro believed {{was going to be}} the future of recording because test pressings always sounded consistent. To ensure this, Corsaro used a Sony 3324 24-track digital tape recorder and a Sony F1 two-track for the 12-bit mix. Madonna recorded the lead parts in a small, wooden, high-ceilinged piano room at the back of Studio C, also known as Power Station's [...] "R room". Corsaro then placed gobos around her while using the top capsule of a stereo AKG C24 <b>tube</b> <b>microphone,</b> with a Schoeps microphone preamplifier and a Pultec equalizer. Once the track met with everybody's approval, Robert Sabino added the keyboard parts, playing mostly a Sequential Circuits Prophet-5, as well as some Rhodes piano and acoustic piano, while Rodgers also played a Synclavier. Madonna, although not required, was present every minute of the recording sessions and the mixing process, Corsaro commented: [...] "Nile was there most of the time, but she was there all of the time. She never left".|$|E
500|$|... "Love Story" [...] was {{recorded}} in March 2008 at Blackbird Studios in Nashville, Tennessee, alongside record producer Nathan Chapman and various personnel. Swift sang into an Avantone CV-12 multi-pattern <b>tube</b> <b>microphone,</b> manufactured by Avant Electronics. The microphone had a new old stock tube that was designed and built by country singer, record producer, and audio engineer Ray Kennedy for Chapman. Chapman had received the microphone from Kennedy as a loan, as a [...] "try this for a while" [...] experiment. Although he previously had tested numerous microphones on Swift, {{he had not been}} able to find one to match her voice perfectly. When Swift came to Chapman's home to record a radio edit for one of the singles from Taylor Swift, she immediately grew fond of the microphone. [...] "When she put on the headphones and said, 'Test,' completely unprompted, she said, 'This is my mic. I love this mic. I just wanna use this one from now on!' She had no idea what it was, just loved it, and I went along with something that felt right for her. We've been using it ever since, and it sounds great on her voice," [...] Chapman said.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{starts with}} a short summary about {{previous}} work done {{in the field of}} head-related transfer function (HRTF) measurement and processing. Afterwards a new method to find and optimize HRTFs is explained. The main idea is to use expert listeners to select and tune the HRTFs with the help of real-time interaction adjustment of all parameters under test. Afterwards a listening test validates the previous results. Additionally several practical remarks regarding HRTF measurement and available HRTF sets are given. A possible scheme for the post processing is presented. The use of small standard microphones improves also the signal to noise ratio compared to the earlier used <b>tube</b> <b>microphones.</b> See the change of measurement technique by Møller et. al.

5000|$|A {{single-ended}} amplifier {{may have}} an asymmetric transfer characteristic and will generally produce even as well as odd harmonics. [...] A particularly famous research about [...] "tube sound" [...] compared a selection of single-ended <b>tube</b> <b>microphone</b> preamplifiers to a selection of push-pull transistorized microphone preamplifiers. The difference in harmonic patterns of these two topologies has henceforth been often incorrectly attributed as difference of tube and solid-state devices (or even the amplifier class). Push-pull tube amplifiers can be run in class A (rarely), AB, or B. Also, a class-B amplifier may have crossover distortion that will be typically high order and thus sonically very undesirable indeed.|$|E

When the inlet pressure is varied, these frequencies remain almost the same, however, the magnitude changes. The RHVT produces different set of frequencies when using different swirl generator. These sets of frequencies-magnitudes represent signatures for each configuration. Different swirl generator nozzles were tested and presented. Frequency signatures with their related thermofluid performance are obtained...|$|R

5000|$|Generally, {{professional}} producers opt for {{a condenser}} microphone for studio recording, mostly due to their wide-range response and high quality. A primary alternative to the expensive condenser microphone is the dynamic microphone, used more often in live performances due to its durability. The major disadvantages of condenser microphones are their expense and fragility. Also, most condenser microphones require phantom power, unlike dynamic microphones. Conversely, the disadvantages of dynamic microphones are they do not generally possess the wide spectrum of condenser microphones and their frequency response is not as uniform. Many hip-hop producers typically used the Neumann U-87 for recording vocals which imparts a glassy [...] "sheen" [...] especially on female vocals. But today, many producers in this musical genre use the Sony C-800 <b>tube</b> <b>microphone,</b> vintage microphones, and high-end ribbon microphones tuned for flattering, [...] "big" [...] vocal expression.It {{should also be noted}} that many classic hip-hop songs were recorded with the most basic of equipment.
