It’s like a phase. <b>This</b> <b>morning</b> <b>I</b> said it’s time to move on."

2500|$|On 6 June 2006, while {{addressing}} {{a conference in}} New York City, he criticised the United States administration for allowing [...] "too much unchecked UN-bashing and stereotyping". He stated {{that much of the}} political dialogue in the US about the UN had been abdicated to its most strident critics, such as conservative talk-show host Rush Limbaugh and the Fox News cable channel and, as a result of this, the true role and value of the UN has become [...] "a mystery in Middle America". These remarks resulted in a backlash from the White House and some US conservative commentators, culminating in a call for an apology by the US envoy to the United Nations John Bolton. Bolton added to reporters, [...] "I spoke to the secretary-general <b>this</b> <b>morning,</b> <b>I</b> said [...] "I've known you since 1989 and I'm telling you this is the worst mistake by a senior U.N. official that I have seen in that entire time." ...|$|E
2500|$|By {{the end of}} 1904, KR became {{somewhat}} {{attached to}} an attractive young {{man by the name}} of Yatsko. [...] "I sent for Yatsko and he came <b>this</b> <b>morning.</b> <b>I</b> easily persuaded him to be candid. It was strange for me to hear him describe the familiar characteristics: he has never felt drawn to a woman, and has been infatuated with men several times. I did not confess to him that I knew these feelings from my own personal experience. Yatsko and I talked for a long time. Before leaving he kissed my face and hands; I should not have allowed this, and should have pushed him away, however I was punished afterwards by vague feelings of shame and remorse. He told me that, ever since the first time we met, his soul has been filled with rapturous feelings towards me, which grow all the time. How this reminds me of my own youth." [...] A few days later, KR and Yatsko met again, and a relationship developed between the two.|$|E

2500|$|Mahindra team {{principal}} Dilbagh Gill eulogised his team's maiden victory, {{calling it}} [...] "a massive breakthrough for Mahindra and Indian sport" [...] but stated {{the company would}} not get eager for more wins but believed further successes would come: [...] "We knew it would happen soon because we have had increased confidence with multiple podiums. For some reason when I woke up <b>this</b> <b>morning</b> <b>I</b> knew we would win." [...] After starting from 14th and gaining positions to finish in fifth place, Buemi was disqualified from the race after post-race scrutineering determined that all four tyres on both his cars were below the minimum mandated pressure of [...] set by tyre supplier Michelin, causing {{him to be in}} breach of Article 25.11 of the series' sporting regulations. Buemi's disqualification meant his teammate Prost, Bird, Vergne and Engel all gained one place and Turvey moved into the final points-scoring position of tenth. e.Dams-Renault co-owner Alain Prost admitted it was a mistake by his team but stated their task was to improve in the following day's race and enable Buemi to remain in contention for the championship. Buemi spoke of his disappointment in the outcome but said he would remain focused on the second race and return with stronger form.|$|E
