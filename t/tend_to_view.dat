25|$|Many {{explanations}} for the optimistic bias come from the goals that people want and outcomes they wish to see. People <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> <b>view</b> their risks as less than others {{because they believe that}} this is what other people want to see. These explanations include self-enhancement, self-presentation, and perceived control.|$|E

25|$|A {{number of}} {{international}} polls {{have shown that}} residents of Africa and Asia <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> <b>view</b> globalization more favorably than residents of Europe or North America. In Africa, a Gallup poll found that 70% of the population views globalization favorably. The BBC found that 50% of people believed that economic globalization was proceeding too rapidly, while 35% believed it was proceeding too slowly.|$|E
25|$|People with schizoid {{personality}} disorder rarely seek treatment for their condition. This is an issue found in many personality disorders, which prevents {{many people who are}} afflicted with these conditions, who <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> <b>view</b> their condition as not conflicting with their self-image and their abnormal perceptions and behaviors as rational and appropriate, from coming forward for treatment. There is little data on the effectiveness of various treatments on this personality disorder due to the infrequency of encountering this personality disorder in clinical settings. However, those in treatment have the option of medication and therapy.|$|E

25|$|Solo invasions {{are more}} common {{although}} few in number. In some cases these are streakers who try to invade the pitch while nude. Supporters <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> <b>view</b> this as harmless fun. One such pitch invasion was at Euro 2004, in the final game between Portugal and Greece, when Jimmy Jump ran onto the pitch to disrupt the game. Another well known invasion {{was carried out by}} Karl Power, who sneaked into Manchester United's team photograph before their Champions League game with Bayern Munich; his other stunts have involved the England national rugby union team and the British Grand Prix.|$|E
25|$|Syrian-Egyptian Gnosticism {{includes}} Sethianism, Valentinianism, Basilideans, Thomasine traditions, and Serpent Gnostics, {{as well as}} {{a number}} of other minor groups and writers. Hermeticism is also a western Gnostic tradition, though it differs in some respects from these other groups. The Syrian–Egyptian school derives much of its outlook from Platonist influences. It depicts creation in a series of emanations from a primal monadic source, finally resulting in the creation of the material universe. These schools <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> <b>view</b> evil in terms of matter that is markedly inferior to goodness and lacking spiritual insight and goodness rather than as an equal force.|$|E
25|$|In 1998, President Ernesto Zedillo (of the PRI) {{appointed}} Pedro Joaquín-Coldwell (an openly-bisexual {{politician and}} {{former governor of}} Quintana Roo) ambassador to Cuba. Nevertheless, most individual officeholders <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> <b>view</b> LGBT issues as a private matter (to be ignored) or a moral problem (to be opposed). The PRI has allied with the PAN to block legislation concerning LGBT rights in some states (except in two cases). The party unanimously {{voted in favor of}} the recognition of same-sex civil unions in Mexico City and Coahuila. There was some internal debate within the PRI whether or not the party should have a platform plank on the issue.|$|E

25|$|Many Orthodox Jews {{view the}} Written and Oral Torah {{as the same}} as Moses taught, for all {{practical}} purposes. Conservative Jews {{tend to believe that}} much of the Oral law is divinely inspired, while Reform and Reconstructionist Jews <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> <b>view</b> all of the Oral law as an entirely human creation. Traditionally, the Reform movement held that Jews were obliged to obey the ethical but not the ritual commandments of Scripture, although today many Reform Jews have adopted many traditional ritual practices. Karaite Jews traditionally consider the Written Torah to be authoritative, viewing the Oral Law as only one possible interpretation of the Written Torah.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} 20th century, {{anthropologist}} Margaret Murray and occultist Aleister Crowley {{are among those}} who questioned {{the involvement of the}} ecclesiastic and secular authorities in the case. Murray, who propagated the witch-cult hypothesis, speculated in her book The Witch-Cult in Western Europe that Gilles de Rais was really a witch and adherent of a fertility cult centered on the pagan goddess, Diana. However, most historians reject Murray's theory. Norman Cohn argues that her theory does not agree with what is known of Gilles' crimes and trial. Historians do not regard Gilles as a martyr to a pre-Christian religion; other scholars <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> <b>view</b> him as a lapsed Catholic who descended into crime and depravity, whose real crimes caused the land forfeitures.|$|E
25|$|Members of the Deaf {{community}} <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> <b>view</b> deafness as {{a difference}} in human experience rather than a disability or disease. Many members take pride in their Deaf identity. Deaf people, {{in the sense of}} a community or culture, can then be seen as a minority group, and therefore some who are a part of this community may feel misunderstood by those who don't know sign language. Another struggle that the Deaf community often faces is that educational institutions usually consist primarily of hearing people. Additionally, hearing family members may need to learn sign language in order for the deaf person to feel included and supported. Unlike other cultures, a deaf person may join the community later in life, rather than being born into it.|$|E

5000|$|Prior {{scholarship}} <b>tended</b> <b>to</b> <b>view</b> Anglo-Saxon paganism as {{a development}} from an older Germanic paganism.

25|$|The {{natural gas}} {{industry}} is older in Alberta than oil, dating from 1883 discoveries near Medicine Hat. During {{the first half}} of the twentieth century, those who applied for permits to export Alberta natural gas often made the painful discovery that it was politically more complex to export gas than oil. Canadians <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> <b>view</b> oil as a commodity. However, through much of Canadian history, they have viewed natural gas as a patrimony, an essential resource to husband with great care for tomorrow. Although the reasons behind this attitude are complex, they are probably rooted in its value for space heating. This trend goes back as far as an incident at the end of the nineteenth century, when Ontario revoked export licenses for natural gas to the United States.|$|E
25|$|Automobiles play a great role in American culture, {{whether it}} is in the mundane lives of private {{individuals}} or in the areas of arts and entertainment. The rise of suburbs and the desire for workers to commute to cities brought about the popularization of automobiles. In 2001, 90% of Americans drove to work in cars. Lower energy and land costs favor the production of relatively large, powerful cars. The culture in the 1950s and 1960s often catered to the automobile with motels and drive-in restaurants. Americans <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> <b>view</b> obtaining a driver's license as a rite of passage. Outside of a relative few urban areas, it is considered a necessity for most Americans to own and drive cars. New York City is the only locality in the United States where {{more than half of all}} households do not own a car.|$|E
25|$|Salary {{disparities between}} men and women may {{partially}} be explained by differences in negotiation tactics used by men and women. Although men and women are equally likely to initiate in a salary negotiation with employers, men will achieve higher outcomes than women by about 2% of starting salary Studies have indicated that men tend to use active negotiation tactics of directly asking for a higher salary, while women tend to use more of an indirect approach by emphasizing self-promotion tactics (e.g. explaining the motivation to be a good employee). Other research indicates that early-childhood play patterns may influence the way men and women negotiate. Men and women <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> <b>view</b> salary differently in terms of relative importance. Overall level of confidence in a negotiation may also be a determinant of why men tend to achieve higher outcomes in salary negotiations. Finally, the awareness of this stereotype alone may directly cause women to achieve lower outcomes as one study indicates. Regardless of the cause, the outcome yields a disparity {{between men and}} women that contributes to the overall wage gap observed in many nations.|$|E

500|$|The {{protocol}} {{has been}} criticised by legal academics such as Bal Sokhi-Bulley and feminists such as Catharine MacKinnon who view the complaints mechanism as difficult, lengthy, and lacking transparency. [...] The voluntary {{nature of the}} protocol and the non-binding nature of its [...] "recommendations" [...] are seen as key limits on its effectiveness. [...] Despite this, these critics <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> <b>view</b> the protocol as a valuable, if flawed, instrument for realizing women's rights.|$|E

500|$|Moaveni {{identified}} two factors {{which may have}} contributed to the intensity of Iranian indignation over the film. First, she describes the timing of the film's release, on the eve of Norouz, the Persian New Year, as [...] "inauspicious." [...] Second, Iranians <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> <b>view</b> the era depicted in the film as [...] "a particularly noble page in their history". Moaveni also suggests that [...] "the box office success of 300, compared with the relative flop of Alexander (another spurious period epic dealing with Persians), is cause for considerable alarm, signaling ominous U.S. intentions".|$|E
25|$|The first {{concerns}} traditional grammar, which <b>tends</b> <b>to</b> <b>view</b> a predicate {{as one of}} {{two main}} parts of a sentence, the other part being the subject; {{the purpose of the}} predicate is to complete an idea about the subject, such as what it does or what it is like.|$|R
