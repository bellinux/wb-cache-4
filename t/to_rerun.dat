He was invited to stand again in Beaconsfield, and was initially inclined to agree but was advised by his head of chambers Derry Irvine to find somewhere else which might be winnable. The situation was {{complicated by the fact}} that Labour was fighting a legal action against planned boundary changes, and had selected candidates on the basis of previous boundaries. When the legal challenge failed, the party had <b>to</b> <b>rerun</b> all selections on the new boundaries; most were based on existing seats, but unusually in County Durham a new Sedgefield constituency had been created out of Labour-voting areas which had no obvious predecessor seat.|$|E

2500|$|The Ameren plants-for-debt swap {{also ran}} into trouble. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) had {{to approve the}} deal and ensure {{that there was no}} {{negative}} impact on consumers from Dynegy's expanding market share in the Midwest. But on April 16, FERC said that the studies submitted by Dynegy and Ameren were inadequate, and it ordered the two firms <b>to</b> <b>rerun</b> the studies and report back to FERC by July 14. On July 16, FERC again declined to approve or disapprove the Dynegy-Ameren deal. The agency said that it Dynegy's study showed it charging market rates for energy in the Midwest. But FERC said it worried that transmission bottlenecks in the area would permit Dynegy to charge much more. [...] Furthermore, federal regulators were considering an expansion in the market area IPH could serve. FERC asked Dynegy to provide additional information on transmission limitations and market area expansion. In August, the Sierra Club formally filed opposition to the Dynegy-Ameren deal. The environmental group said the transmission bottleneck issue gave Dynegy too much market power. It also argued that Dynegy and Ameren had submitted only regional market power data, and had not accounted for local impacts (which could be very severe).|$|E

50|$|Traditionally, shows {{most likely}} <b>to</b> be <b>rerun</b> {{in this manner}} are scripted comedies and dramas.

Most variants of reality television {{have proven to be}} a comparative failure in <b>reruns,</b> due <b>to</b> the competitive nature of the format and the lack of the element of surprise. Despite this, reruns of sports broadcasts have found a niche, and networks such as MSG Network, ESPN Classic and NFL Network currently have a significant portion of programming time devoted <b>to</b> <b>reruns</b> of live sportscasts.|$|R
