40|$|A {{study has}} been made of the {{production}} of hyperfragments by the interactions of K [...] mesons of 3. 0 and 5. 0 GeV/c momentum in nuclear emulsion. The observed frequencies of production, (3. 0 ± 0. 1) % and (2. 2 ± 0. 1) % respectively, are significantly smaller than at lower K [...] meson momenta, while the range distributions show a relative {{increase in the number of}} hyperfragments of range greater than 5 μm. This increase is attributed to a larger contribution from the fragmentation process, which is especially significant <b>at</b> intermediate <b>ranges</b> [(10 ÷ 50) μm], and to greater mean ranges for the heavy hyperfragments, which broaden <b>the</b> <b>peak</b> <b>at</b> short <b>ranges</b> (≤ 10 μm). The hyperfragments of range less than 10 μm are mainly heavy residual products of silver and bromine nuclei; their mass numbers differ on the average from those of the parent nuclei by about 30 and 35 nucleon masses for 3. 0 and 5. 0 GeV/c interactions respectively. Eight examples of π- mesonic decays of heavy hyperfragments, and one probable example of a double hyperfragment, have been observed. © 1966 Società Italiana di Fisica.

40|$|Abstract—A radar {{simulator}} capable of treating multiple-breakscattering effects has been upgraded {{to include the}} inter-action with a Kirchoff surface, which realistically reproduces the effect of water surfaces. Multiple-scattering effects explain in a straightforward way some peculiar features of the first images delivered by the 94 -GHz cloud-profiling radar onboard the CloudSat, overpassing precipitating systems. The reflectivity profiles without <b>the</b> usual <b>peaks</b> <b>at</b> surface <b>range</b> {{are found to be}} distinctive signatures of strong multiple scattering. Moreover, multiple scattering is responsible for producing long signal tails <b>at</b> apparent <b>ranges</b> far below the surface with a strong sensitivity on the microphysical assumptions of the icy segment of the cloud. The estimates of multiple-scattering enhancement at surface and close to the surface range and the saturation levels for simplified precip-itating profiles for both CloudSat and EarthCARE configurations are provided.

40|$|Abstract. The self-aggregation of polysaccharides (PS) in {{solution}} {{has led to}} high viscosity, unstable {{biological activity}} and poor resolution in instrumental characterization as well. In this work, ultrasound with low power level was applied to disrupt the PS aggregation of an exopolysaccharide(EPS) from Cordyceps sinensis mycelial culture. Ultrasonic irradiation with 20 % amplitude (about 4 W) for 0. 5 min decreased the specific viscosity of EPS by 59 %. Dynamic light scattering(DLS) experiments on native EPS showed four distinct population with diameter range of 10 ~ 500 nm, 500 ~ 2500 nm, 3500 ~ 12300 nm and 22150 ~ 115400 nm respectively. <b>The</b> <b>peaks</b> <b>at</b> large size <b>range</b> in the intensity-weighted size distribution disappeared or shifted to small size range, indicating a gradual disassociation of EPS with the prolongation of ultrasonic duration. AFM observation proved the disassociation of EPS from a highly across-linked gel into single strand under ultrasonic treatment. According to DLS analysis, ultrasonic treated EPS did not show any sign of aggregation over 8 days in contrast to an immediate aggregation growth with native EPS. Ultrasonic irradiation control PS association by means of weakening the hydrogen bonds through the hydrodynamic shear forces arising from acoustic cavitation in the irradiated liquid, which has importance in the applications and structural characterization of PS...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Intracerebral {{hemorrhage}} (ICH) is {{a life-threatening}} complication of non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants (NOAC). Little {{is known about}} the effect of intensity of anticoagulation on NOAC-ICH. We describe the current use of coagulation testing in the emergency setting and explore associations with baseline size and expansion of hematoma as determined in a previous study. METHODS: Data from the prospective multicenter RASUNOA registry were analyzed. Patients with NOAC-ICH were enrolled between February 2012 and December 2014. Frequency of local test performance of specific (anti-factor Xa tests, diluted thrombin time) and non-specific tests (international normalized ratio (INR), activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT), thrombin time) was analyzed. The association of anticoagulation intensity at admission with hematoma volume and hematoma expansion was explored. RESULTS: In 61 NOAC-ICH patients enrolled at 21 centers, drug-specific coagulation testing was performed in 16 cases (26 %), and only 29 % of centers appeared to use drug-specific tests in NOAC-ICH at all. In some cases, INR and aPTT values were normal despite drug concentrations in <b>the</b> <b>peak</b> range. In patients with available drug-specific concentrations, 50 % had drug levels in <b>the</b> <b>peak</b> <b>range</b> <b>at</b> admission. Higher intensity of anticoagulation was not associated with higher hematoma volume at admission or with subsequent hematoma expansion. CONCLUSION: Drug-specific tests are only infrequently used in NOAC-ICH. Normal results in non-specific coagulation do not reliably rule out peak range concentrations. Anticoagulation intensity at admission does not predict baseline hematoma volume or subsequent hematoma expansion...|$|R
40|$|We have {{previously}} demonstrated (unpublished data) that extracellular field activity at theta frequency (4 - 15 Hz) can be evoked in the medial septum/diagonal band of Broca (MS/DB) slice in vitro {{in the presence}} of kainate. To investigate the involvement of the neuronal populations of the MS/DB in this activity, we carried out simultaneous intracellular and extracellular field recordings. MS/DB slices were prepared from male Wistar rats (21 days) which were terminally anaesthetised with pentobarbitone sodium (120 mg kg- 1, I. P.). The animals were transcardially perfused with 25 ml of modified ACSF and rapidly decapitated. Longitudinal slices (450 μm) were placed in an interface recording chamber and maintained at 32 °C. Persistent theta oscillations were induced by bath application of 100 nM kainate. Previously we have demonstrated that the kainate-induced theta frequency activity in the MS/DB is significantly reduced upon application of the GABAA receptor antagonist bicuculline. Here we show that there is also a significant reduction in <b>the</b> <b>peak</b> power <b>at</b> theta <b>range</b> following application of the AMPA/kainate receptor antagonist NBQX (10 μM, n = 4, P < 0. 05, Man-Whitney rank sum test), but not after application of the specific AMPA antagonist SYM 2206 (10 µM, n = 12) or the NMDA receptor antagonist D-AP 5, (50 μM, n = 12). Moreover, we demonstrate that the regions where we find extracellular field recordings of kainate-induced theta frequency activity correspond to areas of the MS/DB that have parvalbumin immunopositive somata. Therefore these data suggest that the theta activity is dependent upon both kainate receptor and GABAA receptor activation. Intracellular recordings were made from three types of MS/DB neuron during extracellular field recordings of kainate-induced theta-frequency activity. These neurons were identified as fast-spiking, slow-firing and regular-spiking according to previous criteria (Gorelova & Reiner, 1996; Morris et al. 1999). The fast-spiking type (n = 5) displayed spontaneous and persistent rhythmic single spiking activity at theta frequencies. The slow-firing (n = 5) and regular-spiking (n = 1) types displayed non-rhythmic single spiking activity. Previous studies have shown that fast-spiking and regular-spiking neurons in the MS/DB are GABAergic and that parvalbumin is localised selectively in the fast-spiking neuron type; conversely the slow-firing neurons were shown to be cholinergic. We conclude that the parvalbumin GABAergic neurons may pace rhythmic theta activity in the MS/DB...|$|R

These results reveal that the depolymerized product obtained under the strongest acid condition contains not only aromatic compounds linked with oxygen-containing groups including carboxyl, nitro, carbonyl, and sulfate groups and aliphatic compounds, but also mineral salts such as sulfate salts and silicon oxides which may be produced by the reaction of the minerals in the coal structure with the mixed acids. Curve 5 is the FT-IR spectrum of the depolymerized product obtained at pH =  1.99 – 4.09, <b>the</b> characteristic <b>peaks</b> of which are summarized: <b>the</b> <b>peaks</b> <b>at</b> 3076 and 740  cm− 1 correspond to the adsorption band of the –CH group in aromatic compounds; the in-plane bending vibration band of the –CH group in aromatic ring appeared at 1223  cm− 1; the adsorption band of COOH group showed up between 3000 and 2300  cm− 1; <b>the</b> <b>peak</b> <b>at</b> 3371  cm− 1 is assigned to the adsorption band of –OH group; <b>the</b> <b>peak</b> <b>at</b> 1725  cm− 1 is <b>the</b> characteristic <b>peak</b> of <b>the</b> carbonyl group C=O; <b>the</b> <b>peak</b> <b>at</b> 1612  cm− 1 is attributed to the adsorption band of aryl ketone group; <b>the</b> two <b>peaks</b> <b>at</b> 1538 and 1345  cm− 1 correspond to the unsymmetric and symmetric stretching vibration band of the nitro group linking the aromatic compounds, respectively; <b>the</b> <b>peaks</b> <b>at</b> 667 and 600  cm− 1 are associated with the bending vibration band of the O–N=O group in aromatic compounds; the adsorption band of sulfur containing groups appeared at 909, 536, and 467  cm− 1. The results indicate that the depolymerized product obtained at pH =  1.99 – 4.09 is aromatic compound linked with more oxygen-containing groups including hydroxyl, carboxyl, ester, carbonyl, nitro, and sulfonic groups.|$|R

30|$|Figure  1 {{also shows}} the {{reduction}} of nickel oxide under four different <b>peaks.</b> <b>The</b> <b>peak</b> <b>at</b> 305  °C {{can be attributed to}} {{the reduction of}} bulk NiO [22, 23]. <b>The</b> <b>peaks</b> <b>at</b> 352  °C and 411  °C can be assigned due to the sequential reduction of Ni 3 + to Ni 2 + and Ni 2 + to Ni 0, respectively [24]. Finally, most of the nickel in the catalyst is reduced under <b>the</b> <b>peak</b> <b>at</b> 550  °C, which {{can be attributed to the}} reduction of highly dispersed NiO species interacting strongly with the support [25]. This indicates that most of the Ni in the catalyst is present in a highly dispersed form, strongly interacting with the pyrochlore support.|$|R
3000|$|The reconstructed NMR spectra {{elucidate}} {{the reasons for}} the sample groupings. From the PC 1 loadings (Figure  4 b), it is clear that <b>the</b> large aliphatic <b>peak</b> <b>at</b> about 1.5  ppm versus the oxygenated region at 2.4 - 3.2  ppm are the main factors driving the PC 1 variance. Because <b>the</b> <b>peak</b> <b>at</b> 1.5  ppm has a negative PC 1 loading, it is enhanced in the whole, acid-insoluble, and acid-soluble samples (as they have negative PC 1 scores). The whole and acid-insoluble samples are more enriched in <b>the</b> <b>peak</b> <b>at</b> 1.5  ppm than in the oxygenated region (as they have larger negative PC 1 scores). However, the acid-soluble sample has both of these regions at quite high intensities, giving a PC 1 score that is closer to 0 (but still negative). <b>The</b> <b>peak</b> <b>at</b> 1.2  ppm (which is defined in all samples, Figure  3) is due to CHx protons on aliphatic chains, while <b>the</b> <b>peak</b> <b>at</b> 1.5 is likely due to aliphatic protons that are attached to carbons that are next to either an olefin group or a carboxyl group (H 2 C[*]=[*]CH-CH 2 -R; HOOC-CH [...]...|$|R
