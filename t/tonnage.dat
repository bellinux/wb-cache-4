5|$|A Naval Board of Inquiry was convened on July 21, 1944, to {{find out}} what had happened. The {{official}} proceeding lasted for 39 days and included interviews with witnesses who were officers, civilians and enlisted men. Ordnance experts were questioned as well as inspectors who had overseen previous loading procedures. Five African Americans were questioned, none of whom were later to refuse to load ammunition. Captain Kinne's posted division <b>tonnage</b> results came to light in the inquiry but Kinne stated that the competition to load the most <b>tonnage</b> did not make for unsafe conditions; he implied that any junior officers who said so did not know what they were talking about.|$|E

5|$|In January 1629, Charles {{opened the}} second session of the English Parliament, which had been prorogued in June 1628, with a {{moderate}} speech on the <b>tonnage</b> and poundage issue. Members of the House of Commons began to voice opposition to Charles's policies {{in light of the}} case of John Rolle, a Member of Parliament whose goods had been confiscated for failing to pay <b>tonnage</b> and poundage. Many MPs viewed the imposition of the tax as a breach of the Petition of Right. When Charles ordered a parliamentary adjournment on 2 March, members held the Speaker, Sir John Finch, down in his chair so that the ending of the session could be delayed long enough for resolutions against Catholicism, Arminianism and <b>tonnage</b> and poundage to be read out and acclaimed by the chamber. The provocation was too much for Charles, who dissolved Parliament and had nine parliamentary leaders, including Sir John Eliot, imprisoned over the matter, thereby turning the men into martyrs, and giving popular cause to their protest.|$|E
5|$|Injection {{moulding}} machines {{consist of}} a material hopper, an injection ram or screw-type plunger, and a heating unit. Also known as platens, they hold the moulds in which the components are shaped. Presses are rated by <b>tonnage,</b> which expresses the amount of clamping force that the machine can exert. This force keeps the mould closed during the injection process. <b>Tonnage</b> can vary from less than 5 tons to over 9,000 tons, with the higher figures used in comparatively few manufacturing operations. The total clamp force needed {{is determined by the}} projected area of the part being moulded. This projected area is multiplied by a clamp force of from 1.8 to 7.2 tons for each square centimetre of the projected areas. As a rule of thumb, 4 or 5 tons/in2 can be used for most products. If the plastic material is very stiff, it will require more injection pressure to fill the mould, and thus more clamp <b>tonnage</b> to hold the mould closed. The required force can also be determined by the material used {{and the size of the}} part. Larger parts require higher clamping force.|$|E

5|$|Beginning in {{the late}} 1880s, Brazil's navy fell into obsolescence, a {{situation}} exacerbated by an 1889 revolution, which deposed Emperor Dom Pedro II, and an 1893 civil war.

5|$|By 1818, seventy 60-ton barges {{were working}} on the canal, the {{majority}} of the <b>tonnage</b> being coal and stone travelling via the Somerset Coal Canal. The journey from Bath to Newbury took an average of three and a half days. By 1832, 300,000tons of freight was being carried each year and, between 1825 and 1834, the company had an annual revenue of around £45,000.|$|E

5|$|Rather than direct {{involvement}} in the European land war, the English Parliament preferred a relatively inexpensive naval attack on Spanish colonies in the New World, hoping for the capture of the Spanish treasure fleets. Parliament voted to grant a subsidy of £140,000, which was an insufficient sum for Charles's war plans. Moreover, the House of Commons limited its authorisation for royal collection of <b>tonnage</b> and poundage (two varieties of customs duties) to a period of one year, although previous sovereigns since Henry VI of England had been granted the right for life. In this manner, Parliament could delay approval of the rates until after a full-scale review of customs revenue. The bill made no progress in the House of Lords past its first reading. Although no Parliamentary Act for the levy of <b>tonnage</b> and poundage was obtained, Charles continued to collect the duties.|$|E
5|$|The stages {{were built}} by the Belgian company Stageco along with the U.S.-based company Enerpac. Each stage {{deployed}} high-pressure, state-of-the-art hydraulic systems.

5|$|Additionally {{in early}} May, Charles assented to an {{unprecedented}} Act that forbade {{the dissolution of the}} English Parliament without its consent. In the following months, ship money, fines in distraint of knighthood and excise without parliamentary consent were declared unlawful, and the Courts of Star Chamber and High Commission were abolished. All remaining forms of taxation were legalised and regulated by the <b>Tonnage</b> and Poundage Act. The House of Commons also launched bills attacking bishops and episcopacy, but these failed in the Lords.|$|E
5|$|Agincourt {{was later}} {{transferred}} to the 2nd Battle Squadron and {{was present at the}} surrender of the High Seas Fleet on 21November 1918. She was placed in reserve at Rosyth in March 1919. After unsuccessful attempts to sell her to the Brazilian Government, she was listed for disposal in April 1921, but was used for experimental purposes later that year. She was sold for scrap on 19December 1922 to comply with the <b>tonnage</b> limitations of the Washington Naval Treaty, although she was not actually broken up until the end of 1924.|$|E
5|$|All three boats had successes during World War I; {{between them}} they sank five ships with a {{combined}} <b>tonnage</b> of 22,391.

All three boats were sunk during the war, though U-5, the lead boat of the class, was raised and recommissioned after her sinking. After the war's end, U-5, the only survivor of the class, was ceded to Italy as a war reparation and was broken up in 1920.|$|E
