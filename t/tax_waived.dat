With the help of lawyers in August 1937 he was successful in claiming a pension; he received a cash settlement for his house, which had {{been taken over by}} the city of Cologne; his unpaid mortgage, penalties and <b>taxes</b> were <b>waived.</b> With reasonable financial security he managed to live in seclusion for some years. After the failed assassination attempt on Hitler in 1944, he was imprisoned for a second time as an opponent of the regime. He fell ill and credited Eugen Zander, a former municipal worker in Cologne and communist, with saving his life. Zander, then a section Kapo of a labor camp near Bonn, discovered Adenauer's name on a deportation list to the East and managed to get him admitted to a hospital. Adenauer was subsequently rearrested (as was his wife), but {{in the absence of any}} evidence against him, was released from prison at Brauweiler in November 1944.|$|R

Realizing that Knossos was too expensive even for a rich man, he donated the palace, the grounds, and the Villa Ariadne to the British School at Athens. In essence the school was to take over the excavation and operate it as a means of training students. Evans had had a long relationship with the British School since before excavation. Hogarth had been its director. The Greek and British governments approved the transfer, <b>waiving</b> <b>taxes.</b>|$|R
50|$|Tax amnesty is a limited-time {{opportunity}} for a specified group of taxpayers to pay a defined amount, in exchange for forgiveness of a tax liability (including interest and penalties) relating to a previous tax period or periods and without fear of criminal prosecution. It typically expires when some authority begins a tax investigation of the past-due tax. In some cases, legislation extending amnesty also imposes harsher penalties on those who are eligible for amnesty but do not take it. Tax amnesty is one of voluntary compliance strategies to increase tax base and tax revenue. Tax amnesty is different from other voluntary compliance strategies in part where <b>tax</b> amnesty usually <b>waives</b> the taxpayers' <b>tax</b> liability.|$|R

Excise <b>taxes</b> are usually <b>waived</b> or refunded on goods being exported, so as to encourage exports. Smugglers and other tax evaders will often seek to obtain items at a point at which they are not taxed or taxed much lower and then later sell or use them at a price lower than the post-tax price in their jurisdiction.|$|R
40|$|Many East Asian {{countries}} or cities have experienced {{rapid economic growth}} since the 1990 s, {{and at the same}} time have had to face increasingly worse economic situations such as that brought about by the Asian financial crisis in the late 1990 s and the global financial tsunami in 2008 / 2009. This creates a rising demand for social welfare and an increase in grievances among the citizens. Some Asian states tend to resort to ad hoc 'flexible welfare strategies', such as handing out short-term and piecemeal cash subsidies to their citizens, reducing salary <b>tax</b> and <b>waiving</b> property rates and taxes. This article points out that such flexible welfare strategies are not new innovations, but an extension of the 'flexible accumulation' strategy (as described by David Harvey) in the post-Fordist society. A flexible welfare strategy is unlikely to meet the long-term needs of the citizens. At best, it acts only as a painkiller that temporarily pacifies the grievances of these citizens. Meanwhile, it wastes resources and is expensive and unsustainable and has no long-term effect. This article calls for a thorough evaluation of this 'flexible welfare strategy' and development of more appropriate welfare strategies for facing the age of uncertainty.

The chamber asked the school district to exempt the taxes because neighboring school districts had adopted the exemption and put the territory in AISD in a competitive disadvantage.

Authorities stopped both men at the airport and neither could leave the country unless they posted bonds for the tax money. Norton settled his dispute first, paying $47,000 in taxes and posting a $60,000 bond which enabled him to leave the country on March 29. Foreman, however, remained in the country as Venezuelan government demanded no less $150,000 in taxes from his purse.

The 20% <b>tax</b> penalty is <b>waived</b> for persons who have reached the age of 65 or have become disabled at the time of the withdrawal. Then, only income tax is paid on the withdrawal and in effect, the account has grown tax deferred (similar to an IRA). Medical expenses continue to be tax free.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the effects of}} a proportional capital gains tax in an economy with an Austrian sector (with wine and trees) and an ordinary sector. We analyze the effect of capital gains taxation (on both an accrual and a realization basis) on the efficiency with which resources are used within the Austrian sector. Since time is the only input which can be varied in the Austrian sector this amounts to looking at the effect of capital gains taxation on the harvesting time or selling time of assets. Accrual taxation decreases the selling time of Austrian assets. Realization taxation decreases the selling time of some Austrian assets and leaves it unchanged for others. Inflation further reduces the selling time of assets taxed on an accrual basis; often, but not always, inflation increases. the selling time of Austrian assets taxed on a realization basis. These results suggest that the capital gains tax can reduce the holding period of an asset. However, there is a sense in which such taxes (at least when levied on a realization basis) discourage transactions and increase holding periods. It is never profitable to change the ownership of an Austrian asset between the time of the original investment and the ultimate harvesting of the asset for final use. We examine the effect of capital gains taxation on the efficiency of the allocation of investment between sectors. No neutrality principles emerge when ordinary investment income is taxed {{at the same rate as}} capital gains income. We also analyze the effect of the special tax treatment of capital gains at death and find that the current U. S. tax system, under which capital gains <b>taxes</b> are <b>waived</b> at death, encourages investors to hold assets longer than they otherwise would. ...|$|R
5000|$|During the Italian occupation, Gojjam {{came to be}} {{the home}} of armed bands who {{resisted}} the Italian occupiers, whose leaders included Belay Zelleke, Mengesha Jemberie, Negash Bezabih and Hailu Belew.

Belay Zelleke was even able to fully liberate and run civil administrations {{in the eastern part}} of Gojjam and some adjacent woredas in South Wollo and North Shoa. Since the Italians were unable to bring Gojjam under their control, the province was finally chosen by Emperor Haile Selassie as the safest way to return to Ethiopia. During his return, he was supported by the combined forces of the British army, Gojjamie Patriots, and other Ethiopians living abroad before then in fear of persecution by Italians. During the reign of Emperor Haile Selassie, however, the inhabitants of Gojjam rebelled several times due to resentment over ill-treatment of patriots and increased taxes, the latest occasion in 1968—about the same time as the Bale revolt. Unlike in Bale, the central government did not use a military solution to end the revolt, instead replacing the governors and reversing the attempt to levy new taxes; in response to the 1968 revolt, the central government went as far as <b>waiving</b> <b>tax</b> arrears back to 1950.|$|R

40|$|Special {{provisions}} {{in the tax code}} of some countries enable homeowners to <b>waive</b> <b>tax</b> payments on the capital gain from selling their previous house if they buy a new house of equal or greater value within a short period time of when they move. Owing to this special tax treatment on the capital gain, house owners often face a kinked budget constraint. This paper incorporates this special capital gains tax treatment into the two-period intertemporal housing demand framework. We assume individuals may have a certain degree of myopia on the tax treatment on the beginning of the first period in which the first house decision is made. However, they will become knowledgeable on the tax treatment as well as the stock of previous house when the second house decision is made on the beginning of the second period. Optimal solutions obtained from traditional intertemporal optimization framework suggest that the capital gains tax rate generally has a negative effect on the optimal first-period housing consumption, while it generally has a positive effect on the optimal second-period housing consumption. However, the optimal second-period housing consumption should be modified when the information of tax treatment and previous house stock becomes available on the beginning of the second period. We find the previous house stock has a negative effect on the modified second period housing consumption. The influence of the capital gains tax rate on the modified second period housing consumption becomes ambiguous...|$|R
5000|$|According to the {{historical}} records, the Parthian kings did not care about the qanats the way the Achaemenid kings and even Sassanid kings did. As an instance, Arsac III, one of the Parthian kings, destroyed some qanats {{in order to make}} it difficult for Seleucid Antiochus to advance further while fighting him.The historical records from this time indicate a perfect regulation on both water distribution and farmlands. All the water rights were recorded in a special document which was referred to in case of any transaction. The lists of farmlands - whether private or governmental - were kept at the tax department. During this period there were some official rulings on qanats, streams, construction of dam, operation and maintenance of qanats, etc. The government proceeded to repair or dredge the qanats that were abandoned or destroyed for any reason, and construct the new qanats if necessary. A document written in the Pahlavi language pointed out the important role of qanats in developing the cities at that time.In Iran, the advent of Islam, which coincided with the overthrow of the Sassanid dynasty, brought about a profound change in religious, political, social and cultural structures.

40|$|As in most states, Congolese VAT {{legislation}} – {{in force}} since 2012 – {{is based on}} the neutrality principle. The neutrality principle aims to guarantee that VAT is applied to all economic activities in order to avoid distortions of competition between liable enterprises. This doctoral thesis first clarifies the concept of “neutrality” and determines the scope of this concept in the field of VAT. Second, we analyze the mechanisms that ensure the application of the neutrality principle under VAT Congolese law in comparison with European Union law and Belgian law. It appears that, in these three legal orders, neutrality is first guaranteed by the generalization of VAT to all economic activities. This suggests that no economic activity can escape from being burdened by VAT. This logically results in a rather broad view of the fundamental concepts of “economic activity” and “taxable transaction”. Secondly, neutrality is ensured by the rule of proportionality of VAT to the final price of goods and services. This rule is applied through the deduction of input VAT and the fractioned payments of VAT at each stage of the economic cycle. This rule requires that VAT is paid at each stage of the production or distribution chain, while ensuring that input VAT has been recovered by the economic operator in principle by deduction. Finally, the Congolese law ensures neutrality of VAT through the application of a single rate to all goods and services, except for the zero rating of exports and similar transactions. Regarding European Union law and Belgian law, they apply a multi-rate VAT system considered contrary to the neutrality principle. However, the Congolese VAT law is not fully neutral. It contains imprecisions, inadequacies or gaps in relation to certain key concepts. This situation may adversely affect, either the taxpayers or the Treasury. Taxable persons may be deprived of their right to recover the input VAT paid to their suppliers. Moreover, the <b>tax</b> authorities may <b>waive</b> the requirement to pay VAT on certain operations or economic activities. Therefore, this doctoral thesis formulates proposals to solve the above identified issues, which are consistent with a more neutral Congolese VAT system. Furthermore, it may be observed that the difficulty of applying general rules to all situations is the cause of the organization of special schemes derogating from the VAT neutrality principle. The objective is to ensure a VAT treatment that takes into account specific situations. The application of the special schemes for certain categories of taxpayers is thus legitimate. In this case, SMEs are emblematic of the difficulty of applying the VAT general scheme to all situations. In this respect, it has been found that the VAT treatment of SMEs is not sufficiently organized in the Congolese VAT system. The specificities of these economic entities – plural and multi-sectoral reality – are insufficiently taken into account by VAT Congolese law. The notion of “SME” is not explicitly defined. In addition, they are few mechanisms dedicated to the VAT treatment of these companies that nevertheless dominate the Congolese economy. In this regard, this doctoral work aims to design an effective VAT regime for the Congolese SMEs. Such regime would allow not only mobilizing the fiscal potential of these entities, but also taking into account their specificities and plural and multi-sectoral nature.
