25|$|Arkan {{became an}} {{untouchable}} criminal figure in Belgrade {{and all of}} the former Yugoslavia. He was really so powerful, so strong financially that no one could do anything about him.... In 1993, I learned that Željko Ražnatović, Arkan, had in Belgrade kidnapped and taken to Erdut and there killed Isa Lero... also a man from the criminal underground who had come into conflict with Arkan. I even found a witness to the murder. I publicly accused Arkan. I submitted a report to the police. The police inspectors came to see me. We talked about it. I gave them all <b>the</b> <b>information</b> <b>I</b> had, but then the police inspector told me that they were aware of it but that they were unable to prove it because of the fear among the potential witnesses. So the police were quite well-informed about his criminal activities, but {{it was very hard to}} prove anything or to bring charges because his support network was so widespread, and this can be shown through various newspaper articles and so on. In one television statement, I told him when we were debating on TV, that he had pulled a sock over his head more often than I had pulled one on my feet.|$|E
500|$|In August 2007 The Washington Post {{reported}} Katherine Wone's {{frustration with}} the FBI crime lab, [...] "It has been trying at times {{as we continue to}} wait for the FBI to complete their analysis of all the samples that were taken." [...] Over one year the case had been transferred to three separate prosecutors, earning it [...] "vagabond status" [...] in the U.S. Attorneys' office. On the one-year anniversary of Wone's death, Katherine Wone held a press conference to appeal for public assistance in finding the killer, her first public comment on the case. During the press conference, Holder publicly pleaded with the three residents to provide additional information, saying [...] "You need to ask yourself, 'Have I provided police with all <b>the</b> <b>information</b> <b>I</b> know?'" [...] Interested parties, such as the OCA, used the first anniversary of Wone's death to criticize what they deemed police inaction in the investigation. In contrast to the first anniversary of Wone's murder, there was no press conference on the second anniversary, and neither the Wone family nor police made any statements to the press.|$|E

Burroughs recalled that Whitman had been [...] "deeply interested in what I tell him of the hermit thrush, {{and he says he}} largely used <b>the</b> <b>information</b> <b>I</b> have given him in one of his principal poems". Burroughs described the song as [...] "the finest sound in nature...perhaps more of an evening than a morning hymn...a voice of that calm, sweet solemnity one attains to in his best moments." [...] Whitman took copious notes of his conversations with Burroughs on the subject, writing of the hermit thrush that it [...] "sings oftener after sundown...is very secluded...likes shaded, dark places...His song is a hymn...in swamps—is very shy...never sings near the farm houses—never in the settlement—is the bird of the solemn primal woods & of Nature pure & holy." [...] Burroughs published an essay in May 1865 in which he described the hermit thrush as [...] "quite a rare bird, of very shy and secluded habits" [...] found [...] "only in the deepest and most remote forests, usually in damp and swampy localities". Loving notes that the hermit thrush was [...] "a common bird on Whitman's native Long Island" [...] Biographer Justin Kaplan draws a connection between Whitman's notes and the lines in the poem: ...|$|E
