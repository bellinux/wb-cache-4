5|$|To {{compete in}} this market, Roberts needed more capital. He took MITS public in November 1973 with a stock {{offering}} of 500,000 shares at $1 each. The 1973 oil crisis caused {{a stock market}} downturn and MITS was only able to sell 250,000 shares. This allowed MITS {{to pay off the}} existing debt, but did not allow for any expansion. Roberts had developed several test equipment products such as a Waveform Generator and a Digital Voltmeter so he attempted to appeal <b>to</b> <b>kit</b> builders again by featuring the test equipment and digital clocks in the advertisements, instead of calculators. MITS was losing money, and by July 1974, the full page prominent ads were replaced with quarter-page ads {{in the back of the}} magazine.|$|E

25|$|One 'Clyde' {{shipyard}} was {{not even}} located {{on one of these}} waterways: Alley & MacLellan's Sentinel Works in Jessie Street at Polmadie is around half a mile from the Clyde yet it is reputed to have constructed over 500 vessels, many of which were pre-assembled then 'knocked down' <b>to</b> <b>kit</b> form for despatch to some far distant and remote location – one such vessel being the SS Chauncy Maples, still in service on Lake Malawi. Clyde shipbuilding reached its peak in the years just before World War I and it is estimated that over 370 ships were completed in 1913.|$|E
25|$|Harington {{was born}} on 26 December 1986 in Acton, London, to Deborah Jane (Catesby), a former playwright, and Sir David Harington, 15th Baronet, a businessman. His full name is Christopher Catesby Harington. His mother named him after Christopher Marlowe, whose first name was {{shortened}} <b>to</b> <b>Kit,</b> a name Harington prefers. Harington's uncle was Sir Nicholas John Harington, 14th Baronet, and his patrilineal great-grandfather was Sir Richard Harington, 12th Baronet. The Haringtons are an ancient family that once spelled their name Haverington and derived the name from their estate, a lordship in Cumberland. The first person identified with their name was one Robert De Haverington, the son of Osulphus or Oswulf whose manor was Flemingby. Through his paternal grandmother, Lavender Cecilia Denny, Harington's eighth-great-grandfather was Charles II of England. Also, through his father, Harington descends from Scottish politician Henry Dundas, 1st Viscount Melville.|$|E
25|$|In October 1958, TVR's debt {{with the}} bank was nearing £10,000. At that point in the year, the factory had {{completed}} as few as ten cars, and orders from the United States had almost ceased {{due to the lack}} of sales success there. All of this was of little concern to TVR director and financier Fred Thomas, as he had apparently intended to close TVR and use the failure as a tax loss to benefit his own engineering firm. In actuality, the directors decided on 30 October that the company would be dissolved and re-formed as Layton Sports Cars Ltd. When the new company began trading in December 1958, the directors voted to immediately inject £15,000 to expand the workforce and build stocks of car components. In February 1959, a sister company was formed under the name Grantura Engineering Ltd. to avoid incurring the UK's Purchase Tax on sales of the cars (which were then still being offered as kits); Purchase Tax would not be applied <b>to</b> <b>kit</b> cars that were purchased from a different company than that which supplied the mechanical components.|$|E

2500|$|Truettner writes [...] "...images from Christopher Columbus <b>to</b> <b>Kit</b> Carson {{show the}} {{discovery}} and {{settlement of the}} West as a heroic undertaking. Many nineteenth-century artists and the public believed that these images represented a faithful account of civilization moving westward. [...] A more recent approach argues that these images are carefully staged fiction and that heir role was to justify the hardship and conflict of nation building. Western scenes extolled progress but rarely noted damaging social and environmental change." ...|$|E

They generally have no amenities other than seating and stowage for dive gear, and the divers are usually exposed to wind, spray and sun during the trip. It is common for divers <b>to</b> <b>kit</b> up in their dive suits before boarding, for protection from the weather. It is unusual for the operator to provide refreshments other than bottled drinking water and an after-dive candy.|$|E

Sister Mary Eunice later announces in the dayroom that the movie The Sign of the Cross will be shown to the residents to soothe them during the coming storm.

2500|$|By 1862, the Union Army {{had pushed}} the Confederates down the Rio Grande. The United States {{government}} again turned {{its attention to}} the Navajos, determined to eliminate Navajo raiding and raids on the Navajo. James H. Carleton was ordered to relieve Canby as the Commander for the New Mexico Military Department in September1862. Carleton gave the orders <b>to</b> <b>Kit</b> Carson to proceed to Navajo territory and to receive the Navajo surrender on July 20, 1863. When no Navajos showed up, Carson and another officer entered Navajo territory {{in an attempt to}} persuade Navajos to surrender, and used a scorched earth policy to starve the Navajo out of their traditional homeland and force them to surrender. He was partly successful by early 1864, when thousands of Navajo began surrendering to the Army. Some Navajos evaded and refused to surrender to the U.S.Army. These groups scattered to Navajo Mountain, the Grand Canyon, the territory of the Chiricahua Apache, and to parts of Utah.|$|E
2500|$|Sabino-white {{horses are}} pink-skinned with all-white or nearly-white coats and dark eyes. They are {{homozygous}} for the dominant SB1 allele at the Sabino 1 locus, {{which has been}} mapped <b>to</b> <b>KIT.</b> [...] Without a DNA test, Sabino-white horses are indistinguishable from dominant white horses. The Sabino1 allele, and the associated spotting pattern, is found in Miniature horses, American Quarter Horses, American Paint Horses, Tennessee Walkers, Missouri Fox Trotters, Mustangs, Shetland Ponies, and Aztecas. Sabino 1 has not {{been found in the}} Arabian horse, Clydesdale, Thoroughbred, Standardbred horse, or Shire horse. The Sabino 1 allele is not linked to any health defects, though sabino-whites may need some protection from sunburn. [...] Horses with only one copy of the Sabino1 gene usually have dramatic spotting, including two or more white legs, often with white running up the front of the leg, extensive white on the face, spotting on the midsection, and jagged or roaned margins to the pattern.|$|E

Immediately after the failure is revealed, Singh is {{executed}} by the other board members of the Brotherhood for incompetence. Finally, Kit confronts Vandermaark, who it turns out is a morally questionable man with a streak of cruelty and who deliberately tipped the Brotherhood off <b>to</b> <b>Kit's</b> foster parents' location in order <b>to</b> entice <b>Kit</b> <b>to</b> become the Phantom.

The most common general-purpose stick is a 5A (wood tip, for snare tone) or 5N (nylon tip, for cymbal tone) or 7a for a smooth and easy tone [...] Materials, other than wood (hickory, maple, oak, persimmon), used for producing sticks include aluminum (used primarily for marching band applications), acrylic (primarily for visual appeal) and graphite (most often used by [...] "heavy hitters", playing hard rock and metal, etc.). Other sticks commonly used are rutes, {{consisting of a}} bundle of canes, and wire or nylon drum brushes. More rarely, other beaters such as cartwheel mallets (known <b>to</b> <b>kit</b> drummers as [...] "soft sticks") may be used.
