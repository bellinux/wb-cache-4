Airbus A330-300, B-HYQ, was the first aircraft to wear the new livery.|$|E
5|$|The {{standard}} EVA Air livery utilizes dark green, signifying durability, and orange, representing technological innovation.

There were only minor adjustments made to the pre-1975 silverface Super Reverbs. Today after market kits are sold for non-master silverface amps allowing them to be taken back to the more desired blackface specs.|$|R
2500|$|However, due to {{criticism}} the design was modified {{before the first}} Boeing 777 was delivered. The <b>tail</b> <b>logo</b> {{was replaced by a}} flowing Pakistan flag on a beige background.

In 1996, the livery was slightly modified, with JAT being painted in billboard size at the front with a small Yugoslav flag in the [...] "A" [...] in JAT. During this time, {{as a result of the}} extensive leasing of aircraft by JAT, most aircraft lost the <b>tail</b> <b>logo</b> completely. The livery was updated again in 2001 with the flag in the billboard titles disappearing, and the words Yugoslav Airlines and Jugoslovenski Aerotransport being painted in blue using the same font as the main logo. Not all of the aircraft received this update as the livery was updated again with the introduction of the new name [...] "Jat Airways".|$|E

[...] Sports teams were identified only as [...] "Tam" [...] for the fall and winter seasons of that school year. [...] A school-wide contest was held and the Red Tailed Hawks was chosen as the winner, beating out other entries such as Mountaineers and Locomotives. [...] The Red <b>Tailed</b> Hawk <b>logo</b> and mascot was adopted beginning in the 1990/1991 school year.

5000|$|In 1989, {{the airline}} started {{to add the}} McDonnell Douglas MD-80 to the fleet, {{initially}} in the same livery. In the mid-1990s, the livery was substantially revised. The {{top half of the}} aircraft remained blue (albeit slightly brighter), but the bottom half was repainted light grey, along with the engines, and they were now separated by a gold, white, and red cheatline. The <b>tail</b> <b>logo</b> also underwent minor changes, adding a circle around the lettering and the same cheatline from the fuselage connecting the circle to {{the leading edge of the}} tail. Despite the unchanged lettering on the tail, the titles on the fuselage were changed to all bold letters, rather than the script [...] "Express" [...] titles.|$|E

The [...] "Pakistan" [...] titles were removed and the PIA acronym was enlarged and moved onto the fuselage. The engines and Urdu PIA titles remained the same. The leased A310s and most of the PIA fleet also adopted this livery at a later date.In early 2006 the airline launched four new tail designs for its fleet. The tails represented the four provinces of Pakistan: Sindh, Punjab, Khyber Pakhtoonkhwa and Balochistan. The tails promoted the cultures of the four provinces of Pakistan by applying motifs to the tails and adding a city name {{to the rear of the}} fuselage corresponding to the province. The [...] "Frontier" [...] tail represented the [...] "Phulkari" [...] (flowering) pattern, which reflected a tradition of embroidery generally done on shawls, shirts and linen. The [...] "Punjab" [...] tail was loosely related to the tile decoration of the Wazir Khan Mosque in Lahore. The [...] "Balochistan" [...] tail showed the creativity seen in the local kilims, carpets and rugs woven with wool, goat or camel hair and mixed yarn. The pattern was mostly bold geometric motifs in primary colours dominated by red. The [...] "Sindh" [...] tail was influenced by the Hala tile work with electric blue and white floral patterns. In 2009 management stopped the application of provincial tails, deeming them too costly.|$|E
50|$|The airline was {{initially}} named 'British Caledonian Charter' with {{exactly the same}} livery as its parent company British Caledonian. Two ex Laker Airways/Skytrain DC-10-10s were acquired along with many highly experienced ex Laker Airways Pilots, Flight Engineers and Cabin Crew. The DC-10s were re-registered as G-BJZE and G-BJZD. However {{it was not long}} before British Caledonian realised that its own high quality scheduled product and image was being somewhat tarnished by the more utility charter product in addition to the general public not being able to differentiate between the two companies, even the charter cabin crew all wore identical tartan uniforms to those of the parent company. It was therefore decided to make slight changes to the charter company and livery by introducing 'BCA Charter' decals to the aircraft and outlining the golden St Andrews lion rampant <b>tail</b> <b>logo</b> with a white shield. This lasted only a short time when a radical step was taken between the Rank Organisation and BCAL to completely rebrand the charter arm as 'Cal Air International' This saw the introduction of a striking bold livery never seen in the UK at the time. Cal Air’s DC-10s were mainly used on UK charter flights to the usual popular Mediterranean resorts, North Africa and the Canary Islands. Long haul destinations included Orlando & Tampa Florida, Los Angeles USA, Caribbean, Toronto & Vancouver Canada and The Gambia & Kenya in Africa. A third ex Laker Airways DC-10-10 was acquired in 1986 and re-registered G-GCAL. Occasional ad hoc charter work was also undertaken which saw the companies DC-10s flying to destinations all over the world.|$|E
5000|$|In 2003, Midwest Express Airlines {{began to}} create a new identity, as the first Boeing 717's were being delivered, and the DC-9 {{aircraft}} were being retired. The company started with removing the [...] "Express" [...] from its name (and thus, off the fuselage), and it designed a new logo that would help point it out as a representative of Milwaukee. The result was a logo that looked much like a wing, with a small 'M' inside of it. However, if the logo is turned on its side, it bears a resemblance to the Milwaukee Art Museum, designed by Santiago Calatrava, which was being constructed at the same time. The Art Museum has risen as an icon of Milwaukee, and so the new Midwest Airlines felt {{this would be a good}} representation. Along with this new identity came a new livery. The bottom of the aircraft remained grey, while the top was repainted in a deeper blue, with essentially the same gold, white, and red cheatlines separating the two. On the lower half, there was also a blue swoop, starting at the front (looking much like another stripe), getting larger as it went back, until it covered the entire rear fuselage. The engines on these planes were painted in the same blue color, with four gold rings on the port engine, and three on the starboard. This was meant to represent the ranking of Captain and First Officer, along with where they sit. Only three MD-80 aircraft, registered N813ME, N822ME, and N823ME ever wore the full new livery; all other MD-80s wore a hybrid livery until retirement, combining the second Midwest Express livery with the current logo and titling of Midwest Airlines. In the transitional period, some MD-80s also received the new titles before the new <b>tail</b> <b>logo,</b> resulting in another variation on the livery.|$|E
