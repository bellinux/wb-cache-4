5|$|A {{system is}} {{designated}} as a tropical depression or a subtropical depression when it reaches wind speeds above 28knots (50km/h, 32mph). Should a tropical depression reach wind speeds of 35knots (65km/h, 40mph) <b>then</b> <b>it</b> <b>will</b> be classified as a moderate tropical storm and assigned a name by either the Sub Regional Center in Mauritius or Madagascar. No matter how strong a subtropical system is in this basin, it is always {{designated as a}} subtropical depression.|$|E
5|$|If {{a system}} intensifies into a {{tropical}} cyclone between the Equator– 10°S and 141°E– 160°E, <b>then</b> <b>it</b> <b>will</b> be named by Papua New Guinea National Weather Service (NWS, TCWC Port Moresby). Names are assigned in sequence from list A and are automatically retired after being used regardless of any damage caused.

5|$|Should the {{tropical}} system further intensify and have winds estimated or measured, as greater than 64kn (74mph; 119km/h), <b>then</b> <b>it</b> <b>will</b> {{be called a}} hurricane and classified on the Saffir–Simpson hurricane wind scale. The lowest classification on the SSHWS is a Category 1 hurricane, which has winds of between 64–82kn (74–95mph, 119–153km/h). Should the hurricane intensify further <b>then</b> <b>it</b> <b>will</b> be rated as a Category 2 hurricane, if it has winds of between 83–95kn (96–110mph, 154–177km/h). When a system becomes a Category 3 hurricane with winds of between 96–112kn (111–129mph, 178–208km/h), it {{is considered to be}} a major hurricane by the warning centers. A Category 4 hurricane has winds of 113–136kn (130–156mph, 209–251km/h), while a Category 5 hurricane has winds of at least 137kn (157mph, 252km/h). A post tropical cyclone is a system that has weakened, into a remnant low or has dissipated and formal advisories are usually discontinued at this stage. However, advisories may continue if the post tropical cyclone, poses a significant threat to life and property. They may also continue if the remnants of the system have a chance of regeneration and producing tropical storm or hurricane-force winds over land within 48hours.|$|E
5|$|When {{a system}} {{develops}} into a tropical cyclone below 10°S between 90°E and 160°E, <b>then</b> <b>it</b> <b>will</b> be {{named by the}} Australian Bureau of Meteorology (BoM) which operates three Tropical Cyclone Warning Centres in Perth, Darwin, and Brisbane. The names are assigned in alphabetical order and used in rotating order without regard to year.|$|E
5|$|Should the named storm intensify {{further and}} reach winds speeds of 48knots (89km/h, 55mph), <b>then</b> <b>it</b> <b>will</b> be {{classified}} as a severe tropical storm. A severe tropical storm is designated as a tropical cyclone when it reaches wind speeds of 64knots (118km/h, 74mph). Should a tropical cyclone intensify further and reach wind speeds of 90knots (166km/h, 103mph), it will {{be classified as}} an intense tropical cyclone. A very intense tropical cyclone is the highest category on the South-West Indian Ocean Tropical Cyclone scale, and has winds of over 115knots (212km/h, 132mph).|$|E

5|$|Tropical {{cyclones}} {{that develop}} in the Northern Hemisphere are officially classified, by the warning centres on one of three intensity scales. Tropical cyclones or subtropical cyclones that exist, within the North Atlantic Ocean or the North-eastern Pacific Ocean, are classified as either tropical depressions or tropical storms. Should a system intensify further and become a hurricane, <b>then</b> <b>it</b> <b>will</b> be classified on the Saffir–Simpson hurricane wind scale, {{which is based on}} the estimated maximum sustained winds over a 1-minute period. In the Western Pacific, the Typhoon Committee uses four separate classifications for tropical cyclones that exist within the basin, which are based on the estimated maximum sustained winds over a 10-minute period.|$|E
5|$|Workers who {{are older}} {{typically}} start satellite nests {{and have more}} developed ovaries. Younger and lesser-developed workers join the satellite after its establishment. The distribution of workers between the main nest and satellite is very important because they are needed {{for the establishment of}} the satellite and for the continued running of the main nest. Although, after several months the main nest can become abandoned. If not enough workers follow the initial worker to the new nest, <b>then</b> <b>it</b> <b>will</b> most likely fail as a satellite.|$|E
5|$|Any {{tropical}} cyclone that develops within the North Indian Ocean between 100°E and 45°E is {{monitored by the}} India Meteorological Department (IMD, RSMC New Delhi). Within the region a {{tropical cyclone}} is defined as being a non frontal synoptic scale cyclone, that originates over tropical or subtropical waters with organized convection and a definite cyclonic surface wind circulation. The lowest official classification used in the North Indian Ocean is a Depression, which has 3-minute sustained wind speeds of between 17–27kn (20–31mph; 31–49km/h). Should the depression intensify further <b>then</b> <b>it</b> <b>will</b> become a Deep Depression, which has winds between 28–33kn (32–38mph; 50–61km/h). The system will be classified as a cyclonic storm and assigned a name by the IMD, if it should develop gale-force wind speeds of between 34–47kn (39–54mph; 62–88km/h). Severe Cyclonic Storms have storm force wind speeds of between 48–63kn (55–72mph; 89–117km/h), while Very Severe Cyclonic Storms have hurricane-force winds of 64–89kt (73–102mph; 118–166km/h). Extremely Severe Cyclonic Storms have hurricane-force winds of 90–119kn (166–221km/h, 104–137mph). The highest classification used in the North Indian Ocean is a Super Cyclonic Storm, which have hurricane-force winds of above 120kn (138mph; 222km/h).|$|E

When Leslie reluctantly agrees to do so, Jerry expresses disappointment that she would give up so easily. Feeling empowered again, Leslie asks Jerry to quickly paint another, similar painting, only this time with Tom as the centaur. Leslie tells Marcia the new painting is the original one but painted over. With no more nudity in the painting, a frustrated Marcia gives up her quest to have the painting destroyed. Tom is delighted with the painting until he realizes that Jerry forgot to draw a penis on the centaur. Ben later confides to Andy he likes Leslie but is unable to ask her out because of Chris, but Andy tells him if they truly care about each other, <b>then</b> <b>it</b> <b>will</b> eventually happen.|$|E
5|$|Tropical {{cyclones}} {{that occur}} within the Northern Hemisphere {{to the east}} of the anti-meridian, are officially monitored by either the National Hurricane Center or the Central Pacific Hurricane Center. Within the region a tropical cyclone is defined to be a warm cored, non-frontal synoptic disturbance, that develops over tropical or subtropical waters, with organized atmospheric convection and a closed well defined circulation centre. The region also defines a subtropical cyclone as a non-frontal low pressure disturbance, that has the characteristics of both tropical and extratropical cyclones. Once either of these classifications are met, then advisories are initiated and the warning centers will classify the system as either a tropical or subtropical depression, if the one-minute sustained winds estimated or measured as less than 33kn (38mph; 62km/h). However, if a tropical disturbance is capable of producing tropical storm or hurricane conditions on land within 48 hours, then advisories will be initiated and it will be classified as a potential tropical cyclone. Should the system intensify further or already have one-minute sustained winds of 34–63kn (39–73mph; 63–118km/h), <b>then</b> <b>it</b> <b>will</b> be called either a tropical or subtropical storm and assigned a name.|$|E
