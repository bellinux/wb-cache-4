6000|$|... "I <b>thank</b> <b>you,</b> <b>indeed,</b> sir," [...] John said, [...] "for saving my life; {{and that}} of my cousin Mary, the {{daughter}} of my father's brother. Truly, {{my father and mother}} will be grateful to you, for having saved us; for I am their only son.|$|E
6000|$|... "We <b>thank</b> <b>you,</b> <b>indeed,</b> Sir Robert, and {{it would}} be much better so. The first shine is not off our armour at present, {{and it would}} be {{cumbrous}} to carry a second suit with us, therefore we would much rather that you postponed your gift." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I <b>thank</b> <b>you</b> <b>indeed,</b> sir. I am the Count de Montego. I have my {{wife and}} daughters here and, in their name {{as well as my}} own, I thank you most cordially. I have some twenty men, sir. Alone we could do nothing, but they will aid you in every way, if you will but give orders." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I <b>thank</b> <b>you</b> {{very much}} <b>indeed,</b> sir," [...] Mr. Rubenstein {{declared}} quickly. [...] "It {{is very good}} of you to set the example," [...] he continued, thrusting his hand into Mr. Parker's pockets. [...] "Ah! I see nothing here--nothing! Notes in this pocket--ten, twenty, thirty. Not mine, I see--no Lloyd's stamp. Gold! A pleasant little handful of gold, that. Mr. Parker, I <b>thank</b> <b>you,</b> sir. If you will be so good as to pass into the next room." ...|$|R

"It {{was very}} well behaved in <b>you,</b> <b>indeed,</b> Beatrice," [...] said he, smiling; [...] "a {{sacrifice}} which very few husbands would have had resolution either to make themselves, or to ask of their wives.

6000|$|... 'I mean,' said Mr Toots, 'that I shall {{consider}} it my {{duty as a}} fellow-creature generally, until I am claimed by the silent tomb, {{to make the best}} of myself, and to--to have my boots as brightly polished, as--as--circumstances will admit of. This is the last time, Miss Dombey, of my intruding any observation of a private and personal nature. I <b>thank</b> <b>you</b> very much <b>indeed.</b> If I am not, in a general way, as sensible as my friends could wish me to be, or as I could wish myself, I really am, upon my word and honour, particularly sensible of what is considerate and kind. I feel,' said Mr Toots, in an impassioned tone, 'as if I could express my feelings, at the present moment, in a most remarkable manner, if--if--I could only get a start.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Sir, I <b>thank</b> <b>you</b> <b>indeed.</b> I {{thank you}} very gratefully. It was told me by the Bank that the gentleman would explain to me {{the details of the}} business, and that I must prepare myself to find them of a {{surprising}} nature. I have done my best to prepare myself, and I naturally have a strong and eager interest to know what they are." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I <b>thank</b> <b>you,</b> <b>indeed,</b> lady, {{for your}} kind offices," [...] Walter said earnestly; [...] "for the present I am well content {{to remain at}} my craft, which is that of an armourer, until, at any rate, I have gained such manly {{strength}} and vigour as would fit me for a man-at-arms, and my good master, Geoffrey Ward, will, without payment received, let me go when I ask that grace of him." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We <b>thank</b> <b>you</b> <b>indeed,</b> sir," [...] the settler said, [...] "for {{you have}} saved us {{the loss of}} all our property, and, for aught I know, from being carried off as prisoners. We were {{intending}} to trek down to Ladysmith today, and had just driven in our herds when the Boers arrived. If they had been content with stealing them, {{they would have been}} away before you arrived; but they stopped to plunder everything they could carry off, and, as I should say, from noises that we heard in the house, to smash up all the furniture they could not carry off. We are indeed grateful to you." ...|$|E
60|$|I <b>thank</b> <b>you</b> {{again for}} your letter, and I <b>thank</b> <b>you</b> very kindly <b>indeed</b> for {{the volume of}} Beardsley's letters, by which I have been greatly touched. I knew him a little, and he was himself to my vision touching, and {{extremely}} individual; but I hated his productions and thought them extraordinarily base--and couldn't find (perhaps didn't try enough to find!) the formula that reconciled this baseness, aesthetically, with his being so perfect {{a case of the}} artistic spirit. But now the personal spirit in him, the beauty of nature, is disclosed to me by your letter as wonderful and, in the conditions and circumstances, deeply pathetic and interesting. The amenity, the intelligence, the patience and grace and play of mind and of temper--how charming and individual an exhibition!...And very right have you been to publish the letters, for which Father Gray's claim is indeed supported. The poor boy remains quite one of the few distinguished images on the roll of young English genius brutally clipped, a victim of victims, given the vivacity of his endowment. I am glad I have three or four very definite--though one of them rather disconcerting--recollections of him.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, my dear Jane, I {{believe we}} must be running away. The weather does not look well, and grandmama will be uneasy. You are too obliging, my dear Miss Woodhouse; but we really must take leave. This has been a most {{agreeable}} piece of news indeed. I shall just go round by Mrs. Cole's; but I shall not stop three minutes: and, Jane, you had better go home directly--I would not have you out in a shower!--We think she is the better for Highbury already. <b>Thank</b> <b>you,</b> we do <b>indeed.</b> I shall not attempt calling on Mrs. Goddard, for I really do not think she cares for any thing but boiled pork: when we dress the leg it will be another thing. Good morning to you, my dear sir. Oh! Mr. Knightley is coming too. Well, that is so very!--I am sure if Jane is tired, you will be so kind as to give her your arm.--Mr. Elton, and Miss Hawkins!--Good morning to you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I <b>thank</b> <b>you</b> from my heart,' {{answered}} Hans. 'My {{bones are}} still sore from their blows, {{and had it}} not been for <b>you</b> I should <b>indeed</b> have fared badly.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{have done}} well, Anderson," [...] the colonel {{said when he}} had concluded; [...] "and if ever Leslie should come to see his son he will have cause to <b>thank</b> <b>you,</b> <b>indeed,</b> for {{the way in which}} you have carried out the charge he {{committed}} to you, and he may well be pleased at seeing him grown up such a manly young fellow. As to Leslie himself, we know not whether he be alive or dead. Every interest was made at the time to assuage his majesty's hostility, but the influence of the Marquis of Recambours was too strong, and the king at last peremptorily forbade Leslie's name being mentioned before him. You see, although the girl's father was, of course, at liberty to bestow her hand on whomsoever he pleased, he had, with the toadyism of a courtier, asked the king's approval of the match with Chateaurouge, which, as a matter of course, he received. His majesty, therefore, chose to consider it as a personal offence against himself that this Scottish soldier of fortune should carry off one of the richest heiresses of France, whose hand he had himself granted to one of his peers. At the same rime I cannot but think that Leslie still lives, for had he been dead we should assuredly have heard of the marriage of his widow with some one else. The duke has, of course, long since married, and report says that the pair are ill-matched; but another husband would speedily have been found for the widow." ...|$|E
40|$|<b>Thank</b> <b>you</b> <b>indeed</b> to Christopher Plowe for {{the very}} generous introduction—I think it was perhaps too generous. Chris showed the list of fellows and {{students}} {{who have worked with}} me at National Institutes of Health (NIH), and great credit really goes to them. I have been fortunate and privileged to have been surrounded by the brilliance of all of these individuals and their accomplishments through the years. Also, Chris did not name himself in the photographs with our Malian colleagues, instead referring to himself only as one of the “less talented ” fellows. Not at all! In fact, Chris was overly generous to me when he spoke of our field work in Mali on chloroquine resistance. It really was Chris ’ project with Abdoulaye Djimdé while I was collaborating on much of that work. So I return the credit for that to Chris, with the comment that it was particularly rewarding to see the impact on health in the villages where we collaborated with our Malian colleagues to deliver relatively inexpensive medicines that worked wonders. Tonight marks the end of a wonderful experience for me as your ASTMH President. The period has left me with lasting memories, new colleagues, and friends. And it is a great satisfaction to say that this extraordinary Society continues to grow in strength and collective voice as the leading international organization of scientists and clinicians dedicated to tropical medicine and global health. ASTMH is alive with an abundance of positive spirit and teamwork in our membership. This year we have held our largest and most successful Annual Meeting ever, with over 3, 400 registrants. We have also seen excellent progress in areas of membership, policy and advocacy, media communications, and awards program funding. Time does not allow me to thank by name everyone who made this progress possible. However, I would like to express my gratitude to some individuals in particular: • To Sally Finney, our Executive Director, for her initiative and careful attention to our ASTMH activities thi...|$|E
40|$|NOTE FOR TOJDE EDITOR 3 rd International Conference of Open and Distance Learning (ICODL 2005) held in Patra, Greece Dear Friends and Tojde Readers, First of all I {{would like}} to thank very much those who participated in the 3 rd International Conference of Open and Distance Learning (ICODL 2005) in Patra, Greece. Those who couldn't come, I hope to meet them some time in the future. I {{personally}} want to give my thanks to all who sent their papers for the Conference and trusted us for the organization of the Conference and our involvement in Open and Distance Learning. In total, the 3 days of the Conference there were 620 people (registered) who attended the presentations and panels and about 70 people. The proceedings of the Conference are in two volumes; Volume A (pages 686) and Volume B (pages 592). All those presentations (names and titles) which are in the final programme (see [URL] are included in the proceedings. I must inform you {{that the majority of the}} papers are in Greek. I haven't counted the English language papers, but I presume that they must be around 40. The success of the ICODL 2005 is already leading us to the preparation of the next conference which - I believe - will take place in Athens in the year 2007. I will keep you informed for our plans. At the same time the Hellenic Network of Open and Distance Education (H-NODE) in cooperation with the 'Propobos Publishing Company' has published the second issue of the Journal 'Open Education'. If you want information about the Journal you can contact 'Propobos Publishing Company': E-mail propobos@propobos. gr. The H-NODE in cooperation with the Department of Education - University of Crete is also organizing a "Summer School" in the town of Rethymnon (Crete) in July 2006 (16 - 23). The "Summer School" will take place in the campus which is by the sea and will be only in Greek. Last year we had organized a similar "Summer School" in the island of Kefalonia, in the west Greek islands with 80 participants. There is a strong opinion to organize in the future a "Summer School" in English language. We are open to ideas and proposals. We all <b>thank</b> <b>you</b> <b>indeed</b> for your involvement in the ICODL 2005. Many regards Antonis Lionarakis Assist.
