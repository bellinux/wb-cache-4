The current studies tested a social-communicative theory of empathic weeping. Also, it was hypothesized that cognitive dissonance may contribute to empathic weeping. Based on social communication theory, weeping was expected to both communicate and elicit an empathic response. Subjects (N = 77 females) wrote an essay that either supported (positive) or opposed (negative) weeping. Controls wrote an essay unrelated to weeping. Subjects presented their essays to a female confederate and then watched a movie with the confederate. The essay manipulation was intended to test communicative aspects of weeping by comparing three situations: one that called for emotional expression to communicate support (positive), another that called for emotional restraint to communicate support (negative), and a control condition. The elicitation factor was tested by placing subjects with either a weeping or nonweeping confederate during the movie. Both elicitation and communication hypotheses were supported. Regarding elicitation, compared to nonweeping confederates, weepers elicited greater levels of subject weeping and empathic feelings. Regarding communication, positive subjects wept longer and more intensely than negatives. Results also supported the hypothesis that dissonance contributed to empathic weeping. The second study further examined the relationship between weeping and dissonance. Again, subjects (N = 41 females) wrote and defended an essay and watched a film with a confederate. Study 2 compared factors from Study 1 that maximized versus minimized weeping and presumably empathy and dissonance, i. e., high (positive essay, simulated confederate weeping and depression) versus low (essay unrelated to weeping, no simulated confederate weeping and depression) conditions. It was hypothesized that behaving in an essay dissonant manner posed a threat to self-esteem, resulting in cognitive dissonance. Thus, high condition subjects had dissonance motivation to weep and change <b>their</b> <b>attitude</b> (<b>positively)</b> <b>about</b> weeping. Low subjects had no such motivation. Also, dissonance was manipulated by showing different film segments. Half the subjects viewed the complete film. For the other half, the film was discontinued prior to the scene that typically elicited tears. The incomplete group, therefore, was not confronted with the possibility of behaving in an essay consonant versus dissonant manner. Social Communication predictions concerning empathic weeping were again supported. Dissonance predictions were not supported...|$|E

Results {{of the online}} questionnaire (N= 177) showed that the program was evaluated positively by the mentored migrants. No relation was found between objective similarity in the sociodemographic background of the mentees and mentors and the program’s evaluation. However, {{the evaluation of the}} program also increased with the increasing subjectively perceived similarity. The time mentees and mentors spent together partly mediated this relationship. It is discussed that matching mentees and mentors according to <b>their</b> <b>attitudes</b> could <b>positively</b> influence the program’s success...|$|R
50|$|An {{attitude}} {{is an expression}} of favor or disfavor toward a person, place, thing, or event. The interesting thing about an attitude and human beings is that it alters between each individual. Everyone has a different attitude towards different things. A main factor that determines {{attitude is}} likes and dislikes. The more one likes something or someone the more one is willing to open up and accept what they have to offer. When one doesn’t like something, one is more likely to get defensive and shut down. An example of how one's attitude affects one's human behavior could be as simple as taking a child to the park or to the doctor. Children know they have fun at the park so <b>their</b> <b>attitude</b> becomes willing and positive, but when a doctor is mentioned, they shut down and become upset with the thought of pain. Attitudes can sculpt personalities and the way people view who we are. People with similar attitudes tend to stick together as interests and hobbies are common. This does not mean that people with different attitudes do not interact, the fact is they do. What it means is that specific attitudes can bring people together (e.g., religious groups). Attitudes {{have a lot to do}} with the mind which highly relates to human behavior. The way a human behaves depends a lot on how they look at the situation and what they expect to gain from it. Positive attitudes are better than negative ones as negativity can bring on negative emotions that most of the time can be avoided. It is up to humans to make sure <b>their</b> <b>attitudes</b> <b>positively</b> reflect the behaviors they want to show. This can be done by assessing <b>their</b> <b>attitudes</b> and properly presenting them in society.|$|R
40|$|Language holiday {{camps for}} {{children}} or adolescents who are learners {{of a second}} or additional language are a world-wide phenomenon. They are particularly popular in the USA, Canada and Britain for languages such as French, German and Spanish. Youth camps (also called summer camps) during the European school holidays to learn English or other languages have also enjoyed a long tradition. In Malaysia, English language holiday camps are prolific and have been running since the 1940 s. With such popularity that these camps enjoy the world over, the subject is coming under research. In line with such researches, the present study covers a four day long residential English language holiday camp in Malaysia for 31 female students (aged 16) during May 2013. Its aim was to identify activities that actively engage learners and increase <b>their</b> <b>attitudes</b> <b>positively</b> in regards to learning English. The paper is intended to stimulate further research into extra-curricular activities, specifically English language holiday camps due to their global abundance, to build a corpus of literature in order to fill the current vacuum, and to gather empirical data {{on the value of}} such camps. The findings of the focused study have broad relevance internationally due to the significant numbers of language camps around the world and will contribute to the scanty knowledge currently available on this topic. It is anticipated that the issues discussed in this paper will be useful for students, teachers, researchers, policy makers and practitioners of English language studies alike...|$|R
40|$|Objectives: To {{describe}} {{the reasons why}} cancer patients use Chinese medicine (CM) in terms of <b>their</b> expectations, knowledge, <b>attitudes</b> and barriers. To generate {{an understanding of the}} interrelationships between these factors which could explain the cancer patient's healthcare seeking behavior. Method: Twenty-six in-depth interviews and one focus group were carried out in oncology wards in Xiyuan Hospital, China Academy of Chinese Medical Sciences. Twenty-three cancer patients participated in an in-depth interview and a focus group after providing informed consent. Interviews and focus group were tape recorded, transcribed. Atlas. ti 6. 0 was employed and thematic analysis was used to code and theme the information. Results: A total of 249 codes were identified, which resulted in three main themes: (1) Better outcome - most of participants reported that they believed that they would have a better outcome by using CM treatment. (2) Safe and cheap - CM appeared not to have major side effects and so could be used in the long term and CM remedies cost less. (3) Understandings of CM - Chinese people understand about CM due to its long cultural and historical context and this affected <b>their</b> <b>attitude</b> <b>positively.</b> They trusted CM and used it based on their understandings. Conclusions: Chinese cancer patients expected CM to improve their quality of life and contribute to achieving a better overall outcome. It is safe and relative cheap to use in the long term. Chinese patients appear to trust CM because of its cultural and historical context. More qualitative research is needed to further assess the role of CM in China...|$|R
40|$|Most {{explanations}} of social influence focus on why individuals {{might want to}} agree with the opinions or attitudes of others. The authors propose a different explanation that assumes the attitudes of others influence only the activities and objects individuals are exposed to. For example, individuals are likely to be exposed to activities that their friends enjoy. The authors demonstrate that such influence over sampling behavior is sufficient to produce a social influence effect when individuals form attitudes by learning from experience. Even if the experiences of 2 individuals, when they sample an object or event, are independent random variables, <b>their</b> <b>attitudes</b> will become <b>positively</b> correlated if their sampling processes are interdependent. Interdependent sampling of activities thus provides a different explanation of social influence with distinct empirical and theoretical implications...|$|R
40|$|Over {{the last}} ten years the Royal National Lifeboat Institution (RNLI) have taken a {{proactive}} approach to sea safety, in an effort {{to reduce the number of}} incidents afloat. The RNLI called this proactive measure the Sea Safety Programme. The RNLI's Sea Safety Programme has two aims; • to save lives by changing user attitudes and behaviours, and • to become the lead provider of sea safety information. In order to establish the effectiveness of the RNLI's Sea Safety Programme, the degree to which they have met their aims was evaluated. The methods used to investigate the effectiveness of the RNLI's Sea Safety Programme were a questionnaire, designed specifically to evaluate the impact of the RNLI's Sea Safety Programme, and focus groups to provide contextual input. The questionnaire results were gathered from multiple locations throughout the United Kingdom and the Republic of Ireland. A total of 396 questionnaires were returned, which provided a wide geographical coverage within the United Kingdom and the Republic of Ireland. The questionnaire was specifically targeted at the individuals who take responsibility for safety of watercraft In the chosen categories, corresponding to the focus of the RNLI's Sea Safety campaign. The resulting dataset provides a unique insight into the attitudes and behaviour of this group. The questionnaire showed that the RNLI's Sea Safety Programme has a positive impact on user behaviours. Interpretation of the attitude results showed that the RNLI's Sea Safety Programme has a positive impact on user attitudes. As the RNLI's Sea Safety Programme has had a positive impact on both user attitudes and behaviours it is considered to be meeting its aim to save lives by changing user attitudes and behaviours. The extent of alteration to attitude and behaviour determines the level of Impact the RNLI achieves. Of those respondents that had received RNLI intervention 48 % alter their behaviour iii positively towards safety and 7 % altered <b>their</b> <b>attitude</b> <b>positively</b> towards safety. However, generally it is an act rather than an opinion that will save a life; therefore the effectiveness of the RNLI's Sea Safety Programme is considered to be approximately half of the effort applied. In respect of the RNLI's bid to become the lead provider of Sea Safety information in the UK and the Republic of Ireland, this study has shown that leisure boat users cite the RNLI as the second most influential organisation - behind the RYA, but ahead of the MCA. The RNLI has only been pro-active in this area during {{the last ten}} years, and therefore this rise to this to such a prominent position has been quite rapid. ivFaculty of Scienc...|$|R
40|$|Is it {{possible}} to cover an issue as a journalist {{to the extent that}} you are practically a human rights activist, and still contribute to its continuation by unconsciously upholding the values causing the issue? This study asks the question if journalists help or hinder the elimination of female genital mutilation (FGM), and puts forth the thesis that journalists as a collective in fact are affecting the development more negatively through <b>their</b> <b>attitudes</b> than <b>positively</b> through <b>their</b> actions. The study consists of a theoretical analysis connecting to patriarchy and post-colonialism, and a field study from Tanzania where journalists are interviewed. The theoretical results show a clear connection between patriarchal values and FGM, and that if a journalist upholds these values she will not be as inclined to see the victim of FGM as a subaltern, she {{will be more likely to}} generalize the groups status and characteristics and she will be caught in between traditional and modern values. If a journalist ascribes to more traditional values when it comes to the difference between the genders, her attitudes will to some extent be counterproductive to the work she does when she covers FGM with the intention to prevent it. The field study supports this by showing that awareness about gender inequality and FGM does not necessarily mean awareness of patriarchal structures and how they affect men, women and traditions. One journalist can make a significant difference, but if she is a part of a journalist collective with strong, patriarchal values her efforts might not be sufficient to help in changing the overall development of FGM...|$|R
40|$|Social {{interdependence}} {{theory and}} the 2 × 2 achievement goal framework represent two important literatures that are often studied independently. The present research examined general social interdependence attitudes in school (cooperative, competitive, and individualistic) as antecedents of individuals' situation-specific (semester- or class-focused) achievement goal adoption. All three studies consistently found that a cooperative <b>attitude</b> <b>positively</b> predicted mastery-approach goals, a competitive <b>attitude</b> <b>positively</b> predicted performance-approach and performance-avoidance goals, and an individualistic <b>attitude</b> <b>positively</b> predicted mastery-approach goals. The only anticipated relation that did not emerge consistently was that of an individualistic attitude as a positive predictor of mastery-avoidance goals. Implications of the present work for future empirical and theoretical development both in the social interdependence and the achievement goal literature are discussed...|$|R
40|$|Although {{emphasis}} {{has been}} placed on including content on treating the elderly in the medical school curriculum, little attention has been given to whether content on surgical management of the elderly should be provided in the surgical clerkship. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to describe geriatric principles emphasized in a surgical clerkship and changes in attitudes of students. Junior students (N = 175) were tested on attitudes before and after the clerkship. Attitudes about treating the elderly and surgery in the elderly changed significantly and <b>positively.</b> <b>Attitudes</b> <b>about</b> emergency surgery in the elderly became more realistic, particularly in those selecting surgery as a career. This study differs from others that found that students became more negative about treating the elderly as they progressed through medical school. The surgical clerkship provides a different perspective of the older patient from that seen on medicine or in long-term care, in that the elderly are usually admitted and treated successfully in a short time. The fact that the surgical clerkship, in contrast to other medical school experiences, can <b>positively</b> influence <b>attitudes</b> <b>about</b> aging for all students, regardless of career choice, is encouraging and suggests that including content on surgical management of the elderly can help students become more favorable about treating older patients...|$|R

40|$|Introduction: We {{investigated}} {{the impact of}} Cardio-Pulmonary Resuscitation (CPR) instruction by children on the attitude of people to perform bystander CPR. Methods: In 2012, children from primary and secondary school (age span 11 - 13 years) received a free individual CPR training package containing an inexpensive manikin and a training video. After a CPR training session by their class teacher, they were invited to teach their relatives and friends. After the training, the trainees {{of the children were}} invited to participate in a web survey, containing a test and questions about prior CPR training and about <b>their</b> <b>attitude</b> towards bystander CPR (BCPR) before and after the training. We measured the impact on the attitude to perform BCPR and the theoretical knowledge transfer by the children. Results: A total of 4012 training packages were distributed to 72 schools of which 55 class teachers subscribed their students (n= 822) for the training programme for relatives and friends. After a validation procedure, 874 trainees of 290 children were included in the study. In comparison to trainees of secondary schoolchildren, trainees of primary schoolchildren scored better for the test as well as for a positive change of attitude towards future BCPR (. P<. 0. 001). For every child-instructor 1. 7 people changed <b>their</b> <b>attitude</b> towards BCPR <b>positively.</b> Conclusions: Instructing schoolchildren to teach their relatives and friends in Basic Life Support (BLS) led to a more positive attitude towards BCPR. The results were more positive with trainees from primary schoolchildren than with trainees from secondary schoolchildren. SCOPUS: ar. jinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R

40|$|Despite much {{research}} into vegetarianism, the psychological relationship between eating meat and evaluating animals remains relatively neglected. Through focus groups, questionnaires and experiments, {{this study investigated}} whether people experienced psychological inconsistency in this relationship and, if so, how they handled that inconsistency. Unlike vegetarians' attitudes, the content of meat-eaters' attitudes towards eating meat rarely included animals. Meat-eaters' positive attitudes towards eating meat were consistent with their eating behaviour; however, <b>their</b> <b>attitudes</b> towards farm animals were more positive than <b>their</b> <b>attitudes</b> towards eating meat. It therefore depends upon which attitudes are salient {{at any given time}} to determine whether psychological consistency is maximised overall. By focusing on the relationship between <b>their</b> own genuinely-held <b>attitudes</b> towards farm animals, animals' slaughter, and eating meat, meat-eaters' cognitive dissonance increased. <b>Their</b> <b>attitudes</b> towards eating meat were expected to become more positive in order to restore consonance between <b>their</b> <b>attitudes</b> and eating behaviour. However, meat-eaters' attitudes towards eating meat became less positive and <b>their</b> <b>attitudes</b> towards animals' slaughter became more negative. In contrast, <b>their</b> <b>attitudes</b> towards farm animals resisted change. Therefore meat-eaters' attitudes towards farm animals became relatively even more positive than <b>their</b> <b>attitudes</b> towards eating meat and animals' slaughter. Hence, the attitudes stimulated by this research, in an environment which prevented psychological denial strategies, caused (a) meat eaters' attitudes to become more inconsistent with their behaviour and (b) the consequent lack of consonance restoration. This study both helps to understand the empirical relationship between eating meat and evaluating animals and extends cognitive dissonance theory's explanatory power to real-world complex phenomena...|$|R
