This would be disastrous for the country, so it would be far better for the government to implement its own scheme to reimburse owners for lost cargoes and ships.|$|E

25|$|By the 12th {{century the}} only known bourgeois were the {{multinational}} inhabitants of Compostela, by this stage a fortified and strong city. Meanwhile, the City Council of Santiago for centuries had struggled against their bishops for the recognition {{of a number of}} liberties. In the country, most people were freemen, peasants, artisans, or infantrymen, who could freely choose a patron, or buy and sell properties, although they frequently fell prey to the greed of the big owners, leading many of them to a life of servitude. Finally, servos, libertos, and pueros (serfs and slaves), either obtained in war with the Moors or through trial, constituted a visible part of the society; they were employed as household workers (domesticos and scancianes), shepherds, and farmhands. Local charters also show <b>that,</b> <b>in</b> <b>time,</b> they were freed.|$|E
40|$|Our {{understanding}} of the world is largely shaped by the words of prominent figures. Leaders persuade our world-view, in order to achieve support. Research on identity entrepreneurs suggests that leaders construct reality with narratives, based on a strategic reading of the context. It has been consistently found <b>that</b> <b>in</b> <b>times</b> of economic downturn, Populist-Right Wing Party (PRWP) leaders construct realistic threat narratives to receive anti-immigration support. An overlooked phenomenon is that PRWPs receive increased support <b>in</b> <b>times</b> of economic prosperity. The leaders in this context are evidently influential, but what do they say? As realistic threat narratives are not relevant <b>in</b> prosperous <b>times,</b> perhaps leaders are constructing different narratives, pertaining to symbolic threat. In order to understand more about the relationship between economic state and opposition to immigration, Study 1 examined data from a national Australian survey. Analysis confirmed existing knowledge on threat narratives and economic struggle. It also revealed <b>that</b> <b>in</b> <b>times</b> of economic prosperity, people do not express any real opposition to immigration. How would leaders then strategically position themselves and work with the economic reality they find themselves in? To examine this, Study 2 created an economic reality, and engaged participants in a novel thought experiment concerning opposition to immigration. In line with predictions, it was found <b>that</b> <b>in</b> <b>times</b> of economic prosperity, people will generate more symbolic threat narratives to justify why immigrants are a problem, compared to those experiencing economic decline. Also in line with predictions, it was found <b>that</b> <b>in</b> <b>times</b> of economic decline, people generate more realistic threat narratives, compared to <b>in</b> <b>times</b> of economic growth.

Later, Madonna commented: [...] "We were all wounded {{in one way or another}} by , and then we spent the rest of our lives reacting to it or dealing with it or trying to turn into something else. The anguish of losing my mom left me with a certain kind of loneliness and an incredible longing for something. If I hadn't had that emptiness, I wouldn't have been so driven.

500|$|Similarly, {{where an}} over-inclusive {{classification}} is concerned, a rational relation still {{exists between the}} differentia adopted and the legislative object. Thus, it is tolerated under the rational nexus test in Singapore. While the effect of an over-inclusive classification may be to accord similar treatment to persons differently placed, courts have nonetheless justified {{it on the ground}} that the exigencies of the situation require such classification. The US Supreme Court case Hirabayashi v. United States (1943) is an example of this principle. Following the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor on 7 December 1941, President Franklin D. Roosevelt issued an executive order requiring, among other things, all persons of Japanese ancestry within a designated military area to be [...] "within their place of residence between the hours of 8 p.m. and 6 a.m." [...] and to report to the authorities to register for removal from the military area. The defendant, Gordon Hirabayashi, was convicted of violating the curfew and the registration requirement. The order was arguably over-inclusive as it did not distinguish between Japanese Americans who were loyal to the US and those in respect of which there was evidence of disloyalty. Although the Court noted that distinctions between citizens {{solely on the basis of}} ancestry [...] "are, by their very nature, odious to a free people whose institutions are founded upon the doctrine of equality", because the US was at war with Japan the race-based classification bore a rational relation to the aim of the order, which was to protect from sabotage war materials and utilities in areas believed to be in danger of Japanese invasion and air attack. The Court said: [...] "We cannot close our eyes to the fact, demonstrated by experience, <b>that,</b> <b>in</b> <b>time</b> of war, residents having ethnic affiliations with an invading enemy may be a greater source of danger than those of a different ancestry." ...|$|E
