40|$|Background: Continuous <b>training</b> of teachers, <b>in</b> {{discipline}} and pedagogical topics, {{is a key}} step {{to improve the quality}} of educational processes. Aim: To report the perception of Chilean teachers of undergraduate health care programs, about continuous training activities. Material and Methods: Twenty teachers working at different undergraduate health care programs in Chile were interviewed. Maximum variation and theoretical sampling methods were used to select the sample. Data was analyzed by open coding, according to the Grounded Theory guidelines. Results: Nine categories emerged from data analysis: Access to continuous training, meaning of <b>training</b> <b>in</b> discipline, activities of continuous <b>training</b> <b>in</b> discipline, meaning of continuous <b>training</b> <b>in</b> pedagogy, kinds of continuous <b>training</b> <b>in</b> pedagogy, quality of continuous <b>training</b> <b>in</b> pedagogy, ideal of continuous <b>training</b> <b>in</b> pedagogy, outcomes of continuous <b>training</b> <b>in</b> pedagogy and needs for continuous <b>training</b> <b>in</b> pedagogy. Conclusions: Teachers of health care programs prefer to participate <b>in</b> contextualized <b>training</b> activities. Also, they emphasize their need of <b>training</b> <b>in</b> evaluation and teaching strategies...|$|R
