500|$|RTÉ {{reported}} that [...] "Danger man Fahey was quieter than usual" [...] as Pats lost 2–0 to Hertha BSC {{in the first}} round of the 2008–09 UEFA Cup, held at the Olympiastadion; however, in the second leg, despite Pats' [...] "excellent performance" [...] failing to overturn the deficit, an RTÉ feature picked out [...] "Keith Fahey's control of the game, dictating almost every Pat's attack with that delicate but incisive right foot of his. Fahey stood head and shoulders above the many highly decorated full internationals in the Hertha team, showing the full range of his passing from deep and from close range, and generally showing a poise and guile on the ball <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> expect from a League of Ireland player amongst such illustrious company." ...|$|E
2500|$|You pledged {{during the}} last debate <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> raise taxes on those making less than $200,000 a year. But the price of {{everything}} is going up, {{and we all know}} it. Health care costs, as you all talking about, is skyrocketing, the cost of the war. My question is, how can you or any president, whoever is elected next time, keep that pledge without running this country deeper into debt and passing on more of the bills that we're running up to our children? ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{names of}} the other Nazi executioners are also known due to their {{frequent}} presence in the village (Eilert Dieken, Michael Dziewulski and Erich Wilde). The village Vogt (...) Teofil Kielar was ordered to bury the victims {{with the help of}} other witnesses. He asked the German commander whom he had known from prior inspections and food acquisitions, why the children were also killed. Dieken answered in German, [...] "So <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> have any problems with them." [...] On 11 January 1945, in defiance of the Nazi prohibition, relatives of the Ulmas exhumed the bodies to bury them in the cemetery, and found out that Wiktoria's seventh child was almost born in the grave pit of its parents.|$|E

2500|$|Shrimpton {{believes}} that the apparent indifference of earlier authors {{was due to the}} general hatred by other Greeks against the Thebans who had medized (i.e. allied with the Persians) in the second Persian invasion in 480 BC and again in 368 BC. Athenians, in particular, held a special contempt for Thebes due to the latter's actions in the Peloponnesian War; as well as the Thebans' destruction of Plataea in 373 BC, and the invasion of the Athenian-allied Boeotian city of Oropus in 366 BC. Demosthenes records this sentiment very clearly in a disclaimer in his speech On the Navy (354 BC): [...] "It is difficult to speak to you about , because you have such a hearty dislike of them <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> care to hear any good of them, even if it were true." ...|$|E
2500|$|After {{the debacle}} of the Katt affair in 1730, the Crown Prince lived in virtual house arrest in Rheinsberg; by 1733, after visiting his {{recalcitrant}} son, Frederick William eased {{the restrictions on}} the prince's life, and sent him on the Imperial military campaign in the Rhineland. Bredow was assigned by Frederick William I to teach the Crown Prince [...] "order and economy" [...] (Ordung und Haushaltung). [...] He was not only an [...] "observer", assigned to watch over the prince and report back to the king any problems, and presumably to report back to the king, Bredow developed a good mentoring relationship with Frederick. He stayed with the Crown Prince from early 1734 through December, when Frederick returned to Berlin. Bredow traveled between the front, Berlin, and Bayreuth several times. In February of that year, Frederick wrote to his sister: [...] "Captain Bredow has scared us all so much, especially me, {{when he said he}} found you so altered he did not recognize you and <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> eat anything." ...|$|E
2500|$|Rav's disciples told Rabbi Abba that Rav {{interpreted}} {{the words of}} [...] "Blessed shall you be in the city," [...] to mean that your house would be near a synagogue. Rav {{interpreted the}} words, [...] "and blessed shall you be in the field," [...] to mean that your property would be near the city. Rav interpreted the words of [...] "Blessed shall you be when you come in," [...] to mean <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> find your wife in doubt of being a niddah upon returning home from travels. And Rav interpreted the words, [...] "and blessed shall you be when you go out," [...] to mean that your children would be like you. Rabbi Abba replied that Rabbi Johanan interpreted the words of [...] "Blessed shall you be in the city," [...] to mean that the privy, not the synagogue, would be near at hand. Rabbi Johanan's interpretation was in accordance with his opinion that one receives reward for walking (some distance) to a synagogue. Rabbi Johanan interpreted the words, [...] "And blessed shall you be in the field," [...] to mean that your estate would be divided into three equal portions of cereals, olives, and vines.|$|E

6000|$|... "You {{must have}} some idea," [...] he persisted, [...] "as to who he is. You seemed to expect his coming <b>that</b> night. <b>You</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> let me give an alarm or send for the police. It was {{the same man who}} killed Rosario." ...|$|R
2500|$|Book of Leviticus: [...] "God {{spoke to}} Moses at Mount Sinai, {{telling him to}} speak to the Israelites and say to them: When you come to the land that I am giving you, the land must be given a rest period, a sabbath to God. For six years you may plant your fields, prune your vineyards, and harvest your crops, but the seventh year is a sabbath of sabbaths for the land. It is God's sabbath during which you may not plant your fields, nor prune your vineyards. Do not harvest crops that grow on their own and do not gather the grapes on your unpruned vines, since it is a year of rest for the land. [...] the land is resting may be eaten by you, by your male and female slaves, and by the {{employees}} and resident hands who live with you. All the crops shall be eaten by the domestic and wild animals that are in your land." [...] (Leviticus 25:1–7) [...] "And if ye shall say: 'What shall we eat the seventh year? behold, we may not sow, nor gather in our increase'; then I will command My blessing upon you in the sixth year, and it shall bring forth produce for the three years. And ye shall sow the eighth year, and eat of the produce, the old store; until the ninth year, until her produce come in, ye shall eat the old store." [...] (Leviticus 25:20–22) [...] " [...] I will scatter you among the nations, and keep the sword drawn against you. Your land will remain desolate, and your cities in ruins. Then, as long as the land is desolate and you are in your enemies' land, the land will enjoy its sabbaths. The land will rest and enjoy its sabbatical years. Thus, {{as long as it is}} desolate, [...] will enjoy the sabbatical rest <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> give it when you lived there." [...] (Leviticus 26:33-35) ...|$|E
