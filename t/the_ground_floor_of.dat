5|$|Since 1993 {{the tower}} has been {{owned by the}} Bath Preservation Trust and managed by its subsidiary, The Beckford Tower Trust. The tower was {{restored}} in 1995. In 1972 it was designated as a Grade I listed building. <b>The</b> <b>ground</b> <b>floor</b> <b>of</b> the tower is available to rent through the Landmark Trust as a holiday home.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>ground</b> <b>floor</b> <b>of</b> the {{building}} was dedicated to public access and use. It is entered via wide steps under columns that are three- or four-storeys high, and these pilotis {{create a sense of}} space for the naturally ventilated public lobby areas. From the concourse, which is decorated with wall-relief sculptures, steps lead to upper and lower public service areas, a cafeteria and carparks.|$|E
50|$|Construction of Unit 3 {{commenced}} in 1934, using day labour, and {{was finished}} by 1937. The design {{took advantage of}} the street frontages in Units 1, 2 and 3 by including small shops and an arcade on <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> <b>floors</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Edward and Adelaide Street elevations (now known as ANZAC Square Arcade).|$|R
50|$|When {{the club}} first opened as {{licensed}} premises in 1960, {{it had a}} capacity of some 1,650 people. In 1963, the adjacent warehouse was acquired. The basement and <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> <b>floors</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> two buildings were opened up into single spaces. After the club closed in 1964 the premises became the Pyramid Club.|$|R

5|$|Towers A and B {{are very}} similar to each other. All rooms in both towers are doubles, meaning that two people share each room. There is a lounge the size of three dorm rooms every third floor, {{containing}} a large television and several couches and tables for studying. Communal and university-sponsored events frequently take place in the various lounges throughout the towers. Every floor shares a communal bathroom, with several shower and restroom stalls. Each floor has twenty rooms, except for the lounge floors, which only have seventeen. Each floor's resident assistant lives alone in their respective room, meaning each floor houses 39 people. On <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> <b>floor</b> <b>of</b> Tower A there is a small fitness center containing treadmills, ellipticals, bikes, and weight equipment. A fully functioning post office and all student mailboxes are located on <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> <b>floor</b> <b>of</b> Tower B. Due to the fact that both Towers A and B are exclusively residences for first year students, they are both designated as alcohol-free. Its distribution, sale, and consumption, is punished if discovered.|$|E
5|$|A line to Horsham, {{now part}} of the Arun Valley Line, was opened on 14 February 1848. A station was {{provided}} next to Crawley High Street from that date. A new station was constructed slightly to the east, in conjunction with the Overline House commercial development, and replaced the original station which closed on 28 July 1968. The ticket office and Up (London-bound) platform waiting areas form <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> <b>floor</b> <b>of</b> the office building.|$|E
5|$|Between the Octagon and {{the main}} {{gatehouse}} in the north wall was a barbican, of which little survives– {{just a piece of}} the west wall– although the structure was originally two storeys high. The surviving fabric includes a slot for a portcullis for the barbican's north gate, although there are no hinges for gates. The base of a garderobe demonstrates that second storey would have provided space for habitation, probably a guard room. Drawings from the late 18th century show <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> <b>floor</b> <b>of</b> the barbican still standing and includes detail such as vaulting inside the passageway.|$|E
50|$|The {{original}} neighbourhood shops {{were built}} at <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> <b>floors</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> tenement blocks, following the old Glasgow pattern. Ownership {{of these small}} shops has been transferred from the Council to the Glasgow Housing Association, who have let the surviving blocks of shops in Stravanan Road, Tormusk Road and Machrie Road to various tenants.|$|R

5|$|By 1508, {{construction}} work was completed {{at the north}} of the Loggia, which contained the staircase to access the upper level of the public building. The construction is designed as a body in itself, separated from the main building by a path and connected to it by a covered overpass, a configuration that has come down to us intact. The contribution of Cairano, who at that point returned to the Loggia after at least five years of a stellar career elsewhere, is the portal to <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> <b>floor</b> <b>of</b> the annex and in some ornamentation on the overpass.|$|E
5|$|By mid-August 1942, Stanley had {{recovered}} {{enough to be}} moved to the dysentery wing at Block 151 of Roberts Barracks. Padres Chambers and Payne had heard that Stanley had decorated the prisoners' chapel at Bukit Batok. So they {{asked him if he}} would do some paintings for St Luke's Chapel, which was recently converted from <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> <b>floor</b> <b>of</b> Block 151, near the area where Stanley was recuperating. The Chapel was dedicated to St Luke the Physician. Stanley agreed, and sought inspiration for the proposed paintings in the Gospels.|$|E
5|$|During the 17th century, <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> <b>floor</b> <b>of</b> the keep– made of {{hardened}} gravel– was dug up, {{probably to}} reuse for surfacing roads or pathways. The apartments in the forebuilding were abandoned and {{this part of}} the keep fell into decay as well. In 1644, the lands surrounding the castle were disparked, bringing an end to Castle Rising Chase. In 1705 stone was stripped from the castle to help repair a nearby sluice gate.|$|E

50|$|In the 1960s-1970s, {{residential}} and industrial construction {{was carried out}} on a substantial scale. A large number of social buildings consisting of more than 400 {{residential and}} industrial constructions were built in those decades. On <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> <b>floors</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> multi-storyed buildings cafes, shops, libraries, social and community centers were opened. New schools and a hospital were also built.|$|R

5|$|In 1855, the {{businessman}} Charles Seale Hayne restored Kingswear {{to form a}} summer house, using the local architect Thomas Lidstone; the ground floor was redesigned, a conical roof added and a detached round tower constructed on the north-west side. During the Second World War, it {{was used by the}} Royal Marines and the site reinforced by a concrete blockhouse. The Landmark Trust acquired it in 1987 for use as a holiday let, restoring <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> <b>floor</b> <b>of</b> the main building to its original appearance and recreating the earlier flat, lead roof. It is protected under UK law as a Grade I listed building.|$|E
5|$|Lady Grange was {{abducted}} {{from her home}} {{on the night of}} 22 January 1732 by two Highland noblemen, Roderick MacLeod of Berneray and Macdonald of Morar, and several of their men. After a bloody struggle, she was taken out of the city in a sedan chair and then on horseback to Wester Polmaise near Falkirk, where she was held until 15 August on <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> <b>floor</b> <b>of</b> an uninhabited tower. She was by then over fifty years old.|$|E
5|$|Nash's {{designs for}} the house {{included}} a three-storey octagonal tower, with two wings coming off it and a second square tower above a porte-cochère. Inside the drawing room occupied <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> <b>floor</b> <b>of</b> the tower, with a sitting room above. The dining room was designed to hold views across the valley, and the asymmetric rooms allowed for a panorama of views. To allow {{easy access to the}} gardens, the servant's quarters were moved to a separate wing, but made to be less prominent. A chapel was added in approximately 1862, and the house's loggia was converted into a conservatory.|$|E

5|$|The {{circular}} keep {{was turned}} into a Martello tower, a type of Napoleonic artillery fortification. It was now only two storeys tall, although remaining original interior walls and doorways largely survived untouched. It was accessed on the first floor via an unusual sliding drawbridge, which was supported on rails and could retract into the floor, and the different storeys were linked by a spiral staircase. <b>The</b> <b>ground</b> <b>floor</b> <b>of</b> the keep included a brick-built magazine, and the roof, supported by a central pillar running up through the building, held a single, large gun emplacement.|$|E

25|$|The hamlets, {{particularly}} Rhinecliff and Tivoli, {{also reflect}} the area's original land distributions. Many {{of their houses}} are small two-story frame structures in Victorian styles that occupy small lots on narrow streets. Commercial buildings, in the core neighborhoods, usually occupy <b>the</b> <b>ground</b> <b>floors</b> <b>of</b> such houses or small brick buildings. The landowners often donated money for various public buildings like churches and schools, such as Rhinecliff's Morton Memorial Library.|$|R
