5|$|In {{yet another}} {{alternate}} timeline, Nemo speaks with Elise at her house, and learns {{that she is}} {{still in love with}} her boyfriend, Stefano. Nemo does not back down and keeps assuring her of his feelings. Finally, Elise gives in and a few years later, they get married. In one version of the story line, Elise dies in an accident on the return from the wedding. Nemo keeps her ashes, having promised her to spread them on Mars. In a far future, Nemo carries Elise's ash to Mars and spreads them on the planet's surface. Aboard the spacecraft traveling back to Earth, he meets Anna. Before <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>say</b> much to each other, the ship is destroyed by meteoroids. In an alternate version of events, he works at the same television studio but his assistant drowns instead. The assistant's widow is Anna, whom he recognizes. Another storyline has Nemo and Elise married with three children. However, their marriage is unhappy as Elise suffers from borderline personality disorder and chronic depression. She has attacks of hysteria and, despite Nemo's attempts to save their marriage, ultimately leaves him to pursue Stefano.|$|E
500|$|Later in June, Biden {{participated in}} another debate, this time {{featured}} on PBS and set at Howard University in Washington D.C. At the debate the candidates discussed issues pertinent to African-Americans including education, {{civil rights and}} reproductive safety. Biden stated that {{to prevent the spread}} of AIDS public servants have to communicate to [...] "black men... it is not unmanly to wear a condom, getting women to understand <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>say</b> no, getting people in the position where testing matters. I got tested for AIDS. I know Barack [...] got tested for AIDS." ...|$|E
500|$|In July, Dylan {{appeared}} at the second Newport Folk Festival. That weekend, Peter, Paul and Mary's rendition of [...] "Blowin' in the Wind" [...] reached number two on Billboards pop chart. Baez was also at Newport, appearing twice on stage with Dylan. The combination of the chart success of [...] "Blowin' in the Wind", and the glamor of Baez and Dylan singing together generated excitement about Dylan and his new album. Tom Paxton recalled: [...] "That was a big breakout festival for Bob. The buzz kept growing exponentially {{and it was like}} a coronation of Bob and Joan. They were King and Queen of the festival". His friend Bob Fass recalled that after Newport, Dylan told him that [...] "suddenly I just can't walk around without a disguise. I used to walk around and go wherever I wanted. But now it's gotten very weird. People follow me into the men's room just so <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>say</b> that they saw me pee." ...|$|E

500|$|The album's {{exploration}} of sexuality was particularly well received by reviewers. The New York Times chief critic Jon Pareles described the tracks as [...] "steamy and sleek, full of erotic exploits and sultry vocals" [...] noting that [...] "every so often, for variety, they turn vulnerable, compassionate or pro-feminist". Caitlin White, writing for The 405, characterized Beyoncé as a feminist text. She {{noted that the}} tracks demonstrate Beyoncé's desire to retain complete sexual agency, while also forgoing the expectations of pop songcraft by placing female pleasure at the forefront unquestioningly. Robert Christgau admired the album's [...] "sex sequence" [...] of songs, where for [...] "over seven well-differentiated tracks", Beyoncé [...] "performs the unlikely feat of conveying an open-ended eroticism that varies because [...] knows eroticism does, {{for each of us}} in our individual responses as well as for her". PopMatters' David Amidon similarly praised the album's honest, highly sexual nature, observing it was [...] "her first attempt at bridging an audience, making music that makes the men want to hear {{what she has to say}} and the women feel like <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>say</b> it to men as well".|$|E
500|$|Longtime Spielberg {{collaborator}} John Williams {{composed the}} music score of War of the Worlds. It {{was the first}} time Williams had to compose with an incomplete Spielberg film, as only the first six reels, totalling sixty minutes, were ready for him to use as reference. He considered the score [...] "a very serious piece," [...] which had to combine [...] "necessary frightening atmosphere" [...] with [...] "propulsively rhythmic drive for the action scenes" [...] – the music would be symbolically [...] "pulling forward" [...] vehicles in chase scenes such as Ray driving out of Bayonne or the Tripod attacking the Hudson ferry. Williams added small nods to classic monster movie scores by having orchestras doing a [...] "grand gesture" [...] in scenes overlooking Tripods. To increase the scariness, Williams added a female chorus with a crescendo resembling a shriek – which would [...] "humanize" [...] the track representing [...] "victims that go out without saying an 'ouch' – they're gone before <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>say</b> that" [...] – for the Tripod attacks, and a nearly inaudible male choir – which Williams compared to [...] "Tibetan monks, the lowest known pitch our bodies can make" [...] – for the aliens exploring the basement. The only deviation from orchestras were electronic sounds for the opening and closing narrations.|$|E

2500|$|Northern Ireland Secretary Tom King {{acknowledged}} that the Milltown Cemetery attack and the killing of Howes and Wood were [...] "wholly unacceptable and do require immediate review in regard to policing to be followed at any future funeral." [...] Conservative MP Michael Mates nonetheless defended the [...] "hands off" [...] policy, saying [...] "A return to heavy-handed policing could provoke riots, {{which is what the}} IRA want so <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>say</b> to the world 'They won't even let us bury our dead in peace.'" [...] Fine Gael leader Alan Dukes, Labour leader Dick Spring and Taoiseach Charlie Haughey all condemned the killings. The British prime minister at the time, Margaret Thatcher called the killings [...] "an act of appalling savagery".|$|E
2500|$|Rick Moranis {{drove me}} out of my mind. There's this whole wave of insult comedy. In the real world, if someone insults you a couple of times, you can smack them. Or punch them. You can't do that on a movie set. And these comedians walk around, and <b>they</b> <b>can</b> <b>say</b> {{whatever}} they want. I'm just not that handy with that. Comedians are a special breed. They can antagonize you and say whatever they... want, and you can't do anything to stop them... He's this weird looking little guy who couldn't get laid in a whore house with a fistful of fifties. He would imitate me. The first thing he says to me is, [...] "Do you just act cool, or are you really cool?" [...] That was the first sentence out of his mouth to me in Joel Silver's office. And I was like, [...] "Oh... {{this is not going to}} go well." [...] But he was one of Joel's dear friends, and he ended up making a bunch of movies for Disney. I just wasn't that sharp. I wasn't ready for that kind of crap.|$|E
2500|$|Jonathan Zimmerman {{critically}} {{framed the}} question of Confucius Institutes and academic freedom, [...] "Let's suppose that a cruel, tyrannical, and repressive foreign government offered to pay for American teens to study its national language in our schools. Would you take the deal?" [...] Zimmerman concluded that more Americans should study Chinese, but [...] "on our own terms, making sure that it also reflects our best civic language of freedom, open discussion, and democracy." [...] Chinese history professor Jonathan Lipman from Mount Holyoke College expressed the dilemma of accepting CI funding thus: [...] "By peddling a product we want, namely Chinese language study, the Confucius Institutes bring the Chinese government into the American academy in powerful ways. The general pattern is very clear. <b>They</b> <b>can</b> <b>say,</b> 'We'll give you this money, you'll have a Chinese program, and nobody will talk about Tibet.' In this economy, turning them down has real costs." [...] Professor Terry Russell at the University of Manitoba questioned the Hanban's real motivation, fearing the university {{would not be able}} to organize certain activities judged [...] "sensitive" [...] to the Chinese, such as bringing the Dalai Lama onto campus. He said, [...] "'We have a real conflict of our principles of academic freedom,' with the potential to have a faculty version of Chinese history and a Confucius Institute version being taught on campus." [...] According to Cameron Morrill, president of the University of Manitoba Faculty Association, [...] "It is inappropriate to allow any government, either foreign or domestic, control over a university classroom, regardless of how much money they offer." [...] The university later decided against taking Chinese government money to set up CIs.|$|E
