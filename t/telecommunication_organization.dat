Key measures are summed in order to give hourly, weekly or daily summaries depending on the reporting requirements. Some governments require that at least 6 months of detailed data must be readily available in the RDMS. They also require that a minimum of 5 years of summaries should be available.

40|$|Purpose - This {{purpose of}} this paper is to assess the {{perceived}} importance and actual implementation of four knowledge management (KM) strategies, i. e. culture; leadership; information technology; and measurement, in the Malaysian telecommunication industry. Design/methodology/approach - Data were collected from 289 <b>telecommunication</b> <b>organizations</b> in Malaysia and analyzed using indices and parametric statistics. Findings - The paired t-test results show significant differences among all the KM strategies in terms of their importance and actual implementation. Strategies such as technology, culture and leadership are moderately implemented, with measurement being the least implemented factor. Research limitations/implications - This paper focuses on KM implementation rather than on learning and knowledge utilization. Practical implications - Malaysian <b>telecommunication</b> <b>organizations</b> should give equal attention to the implementation of all the four KM strategies. They need to have proper planning and overcome any problem or difficulty for the four KM strategies to be implemented smoothly, and subsequently narrow the gaps between the perceived importance and actual implementation of these strategies.

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to assess the {{perceived}} importance and actual level of implementation of five preliminary success factors, four knowledge management (KM) strategies and three KM processes towards the performance of the Malaysian telecommunication industry. Design/methodology/approach – A questionnaire survey was conducted on telecommunication companies based on a convenience sampling technique. Data were analyzed using paired t-tests and multiple regression analyses. Findings – The results show that Malaysian <b>telecommunication</b> <b>organizations</b> view all the KM preliminary success factors, strategies and process as important and critical but fall short of implementation. K Audit, K Map, leadership, measurement, construction and embodiment are the variables that have the largest gap between perceived importance and actual implementation.

A critical review of the literature is presented to identify the different approaches and key principles that make up the field of training and development. Using the survey approach, primary data were collected to answer the research question. A total of 142 questionnaires were distributed among senior and middle managers with 110 questionnaires being completed and returned (77 per cent response rate). Field work was also supported with 10 selected interviews with high ranking officials in the surveyed organizations to help corroborate the results. Thereafter, data was analysed using SPSS and spread sheets, and then compared with data available from literature. Despite the presence of a rather systematic approach to training, the findings show that the current status of training in the surveyed organizations is inadequate with heavy emphasis on traditional methods throughout the three stages; the current system does not offer a holistic perspective to training and development. This study presents an exploratory investigation into the training status in <b>telecommunication</b> <b>organizations.</b> It provides a fundamental foundation for future research aimed at expanding the available knowledge within the context of the study.

A questionnaire survey was conducted on <b>Telecommunication</b> <b>organizations</b> of Sri Lanka. The organizations considered for this study as representing the Telecommunication industry of Sri Lanka are only the seven major network operators. The sampling method adopted was convenience sampling within stratified sampling. Data were analyzed using indices and parametric statistics, after conducting reliability and construct validity tests on the variables. The findings show that the industry does not perceive various strategic reasons for implementing Knowledge Management as highly important, although some reasons are perceived as moderately important. Also the level of implementation of both organizational factors for Knowledge Management readiness and Knowledge Management processes are currently at a moderate level. Apart from being limited to a single industry in Sri Lanka and the limitations of the sample itself, the main limitation could be observed is the fact that this study is primarily concerned with Knowledge Management implementation rather than learning and knowledge utilization.
