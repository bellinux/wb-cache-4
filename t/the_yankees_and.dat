5|$|Peckinpaugh was {{considered}} an excellent defensive shortstop and strong leader. When he managed the Yankees, he became the youngest manager in MLB history. He was named American League Most Valuable Player in 1925. He played in the World Series three times: winning the 1924 World Series with the Senators, losing the 1921 World Series with <b>the</b> <b>Yankees,</b> <b>and</b> losing the 1925 World Series with the Senators.|$|E
5|$|Since {{the owners}} of the Yankees are {{involved}} with Mansour bin Zayed Al Nahyan, owner of Manchester City F.C., the Major League Soccer team New York City FC, and the Red Sox being involved with Liverpool F.C., the 2014 International Champions Cup match between Manchester City and Liverpool at Yankee Stadium carried the classic angle of <b>the</b> <b>Yankees</b> <b>and</b> Red Sox rivalry.

50|$|In {{the fall}} of 1943, <b>the</b> <b>Yankee</b> was {{captured}} along with his young sidekick Sparky. They were taken to a concentration camp to be imprisoned and eventually disposed of, as the Nazis considered Delta soldiers, and Deltas who refused to serve the Reich, too dangerous to be kept alive indefinitely like normal prisoners of war. However, after almost two years of torture <b>and</b> interrogation, <b>Yankee</b> <b>and</b> Sparky staged their revolt. At first it seemed like <b>the</b> <b>Yankee</b> <b>and</b> Sparky, {{along with all the}} other Deltas, were killed in the resulting battle, but as the Nazis threw <b>the</b> <b>Yankee</b> <b>and</b> Sparky's bodies into the ovens to be incinerated, something incredible happened: out of the charnal fires of the ovens came Superior, the most powerful superhuman ever born.|$|R
5|$|The Yankees' 1980s demise and {{downfall}} {{continued into}} the early 1990s and was at its frustrating peak in 1994, when they finished with {{the best record in}} the American League in a season that was prematurely halted by the 1994–95 Major League Baseball strike, which left New York sports fans disappointed that Mattingly had not played in a postseason despite being poised to do so that year. At that time, he led active players in both games played and at-bats without participating in a postseason game. Throughout October, the news media added to the embarrassment when they often made references to dates that games in the World Series would have been played. That year, <b>the</b> <b>Yankees</b> <b>and</b> Red Sox would have finished the season against each other at Fenway Park. Both managers, Buck Showalter of <b>the</b> <b>Yankees</b> <b>and</b> Butch Hobson of the Red Sox, who made their managerial debuts against each other, were fired as a result of or during the strike.|$|E
5|$|The {{broadcasts}} of {{the games}} between the rivals have led {{to an increase in}} television ratings. These games have had at least 50% higher ratings than all of the other games broadcast, sometimes almost twice as high than locally broadcast games. In most cases, the most-watched MLB game on any network during a season is a game between <b>the</b> <b>Yankees</b> <b>and</b> the Red Sox.|$|E
5|$|After {{six innings}} of {{allowing}} no earned runs – {{which gave him}} a total of 13 innings against <b>the</b> <b>Yankees</b> <b>and</b> Cardinals with only one earned run allowed on a torn ankle tendon – Schilling made way for Alan Embree, who pitched a scoreless seventh. Mike Timlin replaced Embree in the eighth, in which a sacrifice fly by Scott Rolen reduced the Red Sox lead to four. Keith Foulke then came in to strike out Jim Edmonds to end the inning and also pitched the ninth to end the game. For the second game in a row, the Red Sox won despite committing four fielding errors.|$|E

5|$|Bill Donovan {{was hired}} as the Yankees manager in the offseason. In the 1914–15 offseason, Peckinpaugh {{considered}} leaving the Yankees to join the Federal League, as he received offers from the Chicago Federals, Buffalo Blues, and Indianapolis Hoosiers. After considering the offer from Chicago, he chose to stay with <b>the</b> <b>Yankees,</b> <b>and</b> received a three-year contract worth $6,000 ($ in current dollar terms) per season from 1915 through 1917. He resigned with the Yankees in 1918. Peckinpaugh tied Buck Weaver for fourth in runs scored (89) and several players for eighth in home runs (7) in the 1919 season.|$|E
5|$|During {{his time}} in baseball, Paschal was {{described}} as a five-tool player who excelled at running, throwing, fielding, hitting for average, and power. However, his playing time with the Yankees was limited because they already had future Baseball Hall of Famers Ruth and Earle Combs, and star Bob Meusel, in the outfield. Paschal was considered one of the best bench players in baseball during his time with <b>the</b> <b>Yankees,</b> <b>and</b> sportswriters wrote how he would have started for most other teams in the American League. He {{was one of the best}} pinch hitters in the game during the period, at a time when the term was still relatively new to baseball.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Yankees</b> <b>and</b> the Red Sox {{finished}} {{tied for}} first in 1978; subsequently, the Yankees won a high-profile tie-breaker {{game for the}} division title. The first-place tie came after the Red Sox had enjoyed a 14-game lead over the Yankees more than halfway through the season. Similarly, in the 2004 AL Championship Series, the Yankees ultimately lost a best-of-7 series after leading 3–0. The Red Sox comeback {{was the only time}} in baseball history that a team has come back from a 0–3 deficit to win a series. The Red Sox {{went on to win the}} World Series, effectively ending the 86-year-old curse.|$|E

5|$|The pennant race {{continued}} {{between the}} three teams throughout the entire season. On September 25, after playing 147 games, with seven games left to play, all three teams had a record of 91–56. After each team played four more games, the Indians were up two games, meaning <b>the</b> <b>Yankees</b> <b>and</b> Red Sox had to win their games on September 30 {{to stay in the}} pennant race. They did, and the month of October opened up with both teams 1.5 games behind the Indians. The Indians' last series was a three-game stand against the Tigers, while the Red Sox and Yankees had a two-game series against each other.|$|E
5|$|Turley {{played for}} the Yankees from 1955 to 1962. In the 1955 season, Turley won 17 games for <b>the</b> <b>Yankees,</b> <b>and</b> {{recorded}} 210 strikeouts, second to Herb Score (245). But, he also {{led the league in}} walks with 177. The Yankees won the American League pennant, and advanced to the 1955 World Series, where they faced the Brooklyn Dodgers. He pitched in Game Three of the 1955 World Series, losing to Johnny Podres. He also made two relief appearances in the series, in Games Five and Seven, as the Dodgers defeated the Yankees four games to three.|$|E
5|$|After Game2 {{ended on}} October 3, <b>the</b> <b>Yankees</b> <b>and</b> Cardinals boarded trains to St. Louis, Missouri. The mayor of St. Louis, Victor J. Miller, ordered that the workday end by three the next {{afternoon}} so that the city could welcome the Cardinals at Union Station. The Cardinals players were treated like champions by fans and citizens alike. Just outside the station, Mayor Miller stood at a podium and presented club manager and player Rogers Hornsby with a brand new Lincoln sedan priced at US$4,000 and {{paid for by the}} city's top businessmen. Each member of the Cardinals' team received a new hat, a new pair of shoes, and an engraved white-gold watch valued at a manufacturer's price of $100. As the Cardinals were receiving special treatment from the people of St. Louis, fans were lining up outside Sportsman's Park with the hope of being able to purchase tickets to Game3 for a price of $3.30.|$|E

5|$|After fifth-place {{finishes}} in 1968 and 1969 (the latter {{in the newly}} created six-team American League East division), the 1970 Yankees improved to second in the AL East with a 93–69 record, finishing behind the Baltimore Orioles. Catcher Thurman Munson played his first full season for <b>the</b> <b>Yankees</b> <b>and</b> won AL Rookie of the Year honors for 1970. New York had 11 more losses during their 1971 season than they had in 1970, but in 1972 they contended for the AL East title and a playoff berth. Late in the season, the Yankees were in a four-way tie for the most wins in the division, but a slump caused them to fall to fourth {{by the end of}} their campaign with a record of 79–76.|$|E
5|$|DiMaggio {{returned}} from injury on June 28 after missing 65 games. He hit four {{home runs in}} three games to help sweep Boston and extend the Yankees' league lead. Despite DiMaggio's return, the lineup remained plagued with injuries. After consulting with Stengel, Weiss obtained Johnny Mize from the Giants, but he was soon sidelined with a separated shoulder. Twelve games behind on the Fourth of July, the Red Sox steadily gained ground on <b>the</b> <b>Yankees,</b> <b>and</b> tied them by sweeping a two-game set at Fenway September 24 and 25, {{the first time the}} Yankees had not been in sole possession of first place since the third game of the season. The Red Sox took the lead the following day with a comeback win in a makeup game, as Stengel lost his temper at the umpire {{for the first time in}} Yankee uniform; although he was not ejected, he was fined by the league.|$|E
5|$|Former {{manager for}} the Yankees, Joe McCarthy came out of {{retirement}} after a feud with Yankee ownership to sign with the Red Sox as their manager in 1948.

The Red Sox eliminated the Yankees in the final series at Fenway Park, overcoming four DiMaggio hits in the final game to tie Cleveland for the pennant. The situation forced the first-ever one-game playoff in AL history, which the Indians won 8–3 at Fenway Park. The city of Boston missed out on a chance for its first all-Boston World Series, as the Indians went on to defeat the Boston Braves in the Series, the last one the Indians have won to date.|$|E

5|$|In 1912, Chance endured {{surgeries}} {{to correct}} blood clots {{in his brain}} that were caused by being hit by pitches in his head. Meanwhile, Chance argued with Murphy, who had been releasing expensive players from the Cubs {{in an effort to}} save the team money. The New York Yankees negotiated for Chance's release from the Cubs after the 1912 season. The Cubs released Chance while he was hospitalized, and in January 1913, Chance signed a three-year contract with the Yankees, worth $120,000 ($ in current dollar terms), to serve as the Yankees' manager. He also played first base for <b>the</b> <b>Yankees</b> <b>and</b> served as field captain, though he played in no more than 12 games in a season. The Yankees sat in last place on the next-to-last day of the 1913 season, but won their final game to finish in seventh place. In 1914, Chance named Roger Peckinpaugh the Yankees' new captain.|$|E
5|$|In 1999, <b>the</b> <b>Yankees</b> <b>and</b> Red Sox {{faced each}} other {{for the first time in}} the ALCS. The Yankees were the {{defending}} World Series champions and in the midst of a run of three consecutive World Championships, while Boston had not appeared in the ALCS since 1990. The Yankees won the first game of the ALCS against the Red Sox on a 10th-inning walk-off home run by Bernie Williams off Boston reliever Rod Beck. The game was the first actual postseason meeting between the rivals because the one-game playoff in 1978 technically counted as a regular season game. Intensity built up due to this historic, first-ever postseason meeting between the two longtime rivals. The Yankees would win the first two games at home with 7th-inning comebacks.|$|E
5|$|Just {{two years}} after Ruth's sale, {{he went on to}} have a record setting season—statistically, one of the {{greatest}} in major league history for a batter. This propelled the Yankees to capture their first pennant and face their rival Giants. On October 5, 1921, the Yankees appeared in and won their very first World Series game. Ruth got hurt during the Series, and the Yankees eventually dropped the last three games, losing the Series five games to three to the Giants in the last ever best-of-nine Series. Both <b>the</b> <b>Yankees</b> <b>and</b> Giants would play in the 1922 World Series as well, a series that would be the Yankees' last in the two teams' shared stadium at the Polo Grounds as the Giants served the Yankees an eviction notice after the 1921 season.|$|E
