40|$|The Rous-associated virus 1 env gene, which encodes the {{envelope}} gp 85 and gp 37 glycoproteins, was isolated and inserted {{in place of}} the v-erbB oncogene into an avian erythroblastosis virus-based vector, carrying the neo resistance gene substituted for the v-erbA oncogene, to generate the pNEA recombinant vector. A helper-free virus stock of the pNEA vector was produced on an avian <b>transcomplementing</b> <b>cell</b> line and used to infect primary chicken embryo fibroblasts (CEFs) or quail QT 6 cells. These infected cells, selected with G 418 (CEF/NEA and QT 6 /NEA, respectively) were found to be resistant to superinfections with subgroup A retroviruses. The CEF/NEA preparations were used as a cell-associated antigen to inoculate adult chickens by the intravenous route compared with direct inoculations of NEA recombinant helper-free virus used as a cell-free antigen. Chickens injected with the cell-associated antigen (CEF/NEA) exhibited an immune response demonstrated by induction of high titers of neutralizing antibodies and were found to be protected against tumor production after Rous sarcoma virus A challenge. Conversely, no immune response and no protection against Rous sarcoma virus A challenge were observed in chickens directly inoculated with cell-free NEA recombinant virus or in sham-inoculated chickens...|$|E
