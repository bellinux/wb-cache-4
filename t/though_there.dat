5|$|December 14, 1952: Sleet {{and snow}} falls across the {{northern}} {{portion of the}} state, <b>though</b> <b>there</b> is very little accumulation.|$|E
5|$|The {{same story}} {{is found in}} Gesta Danorum, <b>though</b> <b>there</b> Einarr is aiming at Svein, rather than Eirik.|$|E
5|$|A {{church has}} been on the site since at least 1180, but the current {{structure}} dates from the 15th century, <b>though</b> <b>there</b> have been several restorations in the intervening period.|$|E
6000|$|... "You'd expect {{very little}} of Europe, then, in most things; <b>though</b> <b>there's</b> no disputing that it's a very pretty {{illusion}} of the Old World." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Not at all; {{nobody can}} say that we be that, <b>though</b> <b>there's</b> more {{of it in the}} country than there should be by all account.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I can't say, sir, I'm sure. It's seldom I {{see other}} folks's butter, <b>though</b> <b>there's</b> some {{on it as}} one's no need to see--the smell's enough." ...|$|R
5|$|A set {{of events}} {{similar to those}} that doomed Star Dust also caused the crash of Uruguayan Air Force Flight 571 in 1972 (depicted in the film Alive), <b>though</b> <b>there</b> were {{survivors}} from that crash because it involved a glancing blow to a mountainside rather than a head-on collision.|$|E
5|$|August 7, 1980- Hurricane Allen passes about 310miles (500km) {{south of}} Key West, Florida. The {{threat of the}} large {{hurricane}} prompts the National Hurricane Center to issue gale warnings for the Florida Keys. The hurricane produces gale force winds across the keys, <b>though</b> <b>there</b> was no significant damage.|$|E
5|$|Each {{hemisphere}} is conventionally {{divided into}} four lobes; the frontal lobe, parietal lobe, temporal lobe, and occipital lobe, named according to the skull bones that overlie them. Each lobe is associated {{with one or two}} specialised functions <b>though</b> <b>there</b> is some functional overlap between them.|$|E
6000|$|... "It's at your service," [...] Blake responded. [...] "I'm {{sorry we}} can't offer you much supper, <b>though</b> <b>there's</b> {{a bit of}} a bannock and some flour." ...|$|R
6000|$|... - [...] "You get small rest--that read I quite; [...] And so do I, maybe; <b>Though</b> <b>there's</b> a rest hid {{safe from}} sight [...] Elsewhere {{awaiting}} me!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It's at your service," [...] Blake told him. [...] "I'm {{sorry we}} can't offer you much supper, <b>though</b> <b>there's</b> {{a bit of}} a bannock and some flour." ...|$|R
5|$|Imelda Staunton voiced the Tall Flower Faces. <b>Though</b> <b>there</b> {{are many}} flowers that appear around Underland, {{only one of}} them speaks {{and one of them is}} clearly a {{caricature}} of Staunton. Staunton only speaks three lines that are heard very briefly at the beginning of the film.|$|E
5|$|In the {{automotive}} field, Cluj-Napoca hosts two {{stages in the}} National Rally Championship. Raliul Clujului is held in June; the Avram Iancu Rally, held in September, has been officially organised since 1975, <b>though</b> <b>there</b> were several years when it was not held. The latter rally begins in Cipariu Square and runs across the surroundings of the city.|$|E
5|$|Like Compsognathus, {{and unlike}} Sinosauropteryx, {{a patch of}} fossilized skin from the tail and hindlimb of the {{possible}} relative Juravenator starki shows mainly scales, <b>though</b> <b>there</b> is some indication that simple feathers were also present in the preserved areas. This may mean that a feather covering was not ubiquitous in this group of dinosaurs.|$|E
5000|$|... "Banquet" [...] {{describes}} a metaphorical table from which [...] "some get the gravy / Some get the gristle... and some get nothing / <b>Though</b> <b>there's</b> plenty to spare".|$|R
6000|$|... "Pneumonia," [...] he said. [...] "Anyway, in the meanwhile, I'll {{figure on}} it as that, <b>though</b> <b>there's</b> {{what one might call}} a general {{physical}} collapse as well. Where did he come from?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, that's what I be. <b>Though</b> <b>there's</b> {{more than}} one. You little {{children}} think there's only one cuckoo, one fox, one giant, one devil, and one reddleman, when there's lots of us all." ...|$|R
5|$|Presidents Néstor Kirchner of Argentina, Evo Morales of Bolivia, Álvaro Uribe of Colombia, Rafael Correa of Ecuador, and Fernando Lugo of Paraguay {{were present}} at the ceremony, but {{television}} footage showed that the inauguration was not interrupted, even <b>though</b> <b>there</b> was a tsunami warning in place; however, it was reported the ceremony was concluded more quickly than planned.|$|E
5|$|Stevens never married, <b>though</b> <b>there</b> {{were rumors}} about his 20-year {{relationship}} (1848–1868) with his widowed housekeeper, Lydia Hamilton Smith (1813–1884). She was a light-skinned African-American; her husband Jacob {{and at least}} one of her sons were much darker than she was.|$|E
5|$|The {{origins of}} the pasty are unclear, <b>though</b> <b>there</b> are many {{references}} to them throughout historical documents and fiction. The pasty is now popular worldwide due {{to the spread of}} Cornish miners, and variations can be found in Australia, the United States, Argentina, Mexico, Ulster and elsewhere.|$|E
6000|$|... "I fear this is {{the last}} one, Benjy, <b>though</b> <b>there's</b> no end to the {{applications}} of these contrivances. You'd better apply this one to yourself now, and see how you get on in it." ...|$|R
60|$|Now I'll see how {{she looks}} after it; <b>though</b> <b>there's</b> not much to be got out of her face, the {{deceitful}} hussy, thought Dean, marching down the corridor and knitting her black brows as she went.|$|R
6000|$|... "Ah!--You don't love to {{talk about}} it," [...] said Uncle Venner. [...] "Well, well! we'll say no more, <b>though</b> <b>there's</b> word of it all over town. I {{remember}} him, Miss Hepzibah, before he could run alone!" ...|$|R
5|$|The {{sides of}} the {{building}} were faced with plain brick, and flanked by narrow alleys with iron gates at each entrance. The walls generally had plain windows, <b>though</b> <b>there</b> was a round arched {{one on each side}} of the fourth floor. One fire escape remained, in the east alley.|$|E
5|$|The vulture's {{head and}} neck are featherless as an {{adaptation}} for hygiene, <b>though</b> <b>there</b> are black bristles on parts of the head; this lack of feathers prevents bacteria from the carrion it eats from ruining its feathers and exposes the skin to the sterilizing effects of the sun.|$|E
5|$|There {{are three}} {{recognised}} subspecies, <b>though</b> <b>there</b> is {{a zone of}} intermediate birds across western Victoria and eastern South Australia, bordered by western Port Phillip Bay to the east, Mount Lofty Ranges to the West and Little and Big Desert parks to the north. The differences in plumage are not generally prominent enough to be noticeable in the field.|$|E
6000|$|... "I've {{got to get}} at it {{some other}} way," [...] said Jimmy, [...] "but you bet your life I'm going to get at it. It looks to me as <b>though</b> <b>there's</b> {{something}} funny about that pay-roll." ...|$|R
50|$|Cavern of Spirits: <b>Though</b> <b>there's</b> {{nothing much}} spiritual about this cavern, you will face your own ghost if you don't fight the current. Careful {{coordination}} with the Mantis and Leopard styles should {{get you through}} just fine.|$|R
5000|$|Major living Jiangnan {{lineages}} include Guangling, Zhe (Xumen) and Wumen. Others, like a [...] "Jinling" [...] style {{centered in}} Nanjing, don't really seem to exist anymore — <b>though</b> <b>there's</b> always an old master or two as counterexample.|$|R
5|$|These points can {{be applied}} to the {{structure}} of The Waste Land, <b>though</b> <b>there</b> is not necessarily a fulfilment of these but merely a longing or discussion of them.|$|E
5|$|<b>Though</b> <b>there</b> are {{doubts about}} the {{authenticity}} of the White Horse Prophecy as a whole, several sources attribute to Smith the idea that the United States Constitution would one day hang by a thread, and LDS Church leaders have issued similar warnings with regard to the Constitution.|$|E
5|$|Threat to {{national}} culture: The proposal {{would lead to}} permanent deactivation of firearms owned by collectors and museums, including army museums, even <b>though</b> <b>there</b> is no empirical data supporting need for such a measure.|$|E
6000|$|Before he and Benson had {{finished}} their repast Clarke joined them and, answering a question, said, [...] "I believe the worst danger's over, <b>though</b> <b>there's</b> {{a possibility of}} a relapse. He'll need careful attention for several days." ...|$|R
6000|$|... “We won’t {{discuss that}} point,” said Ossipon, {{with an air}} of rising above {{personal}} considerations. “I am afraid I’ll have to spoil your holiday for you, <b>though.</b> <b>There’s</b> a man blown up in Greenwich Park this morning.” ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I'm not sure," [...] said Evan, [...] "that {{the story}} is a true one, <b>though</b> <b>there's</b> truth {{at the bottom of}} it, for we all know well enough that we {{sometimes}} pick up a corpse in our nets." ...|$|R
