25|$|In {{spite of}} its {{formidable}} definition, the topological index is usually straightforward <b>to</b> <b>evaluate</b> explicitly.

Many important invariants of a manifold (such as the signature) can be given as the index of suitable differential operators, so the index theorem allows us <b>to</b> <b>evaluate</b> these invariants in terms of topological data.|$|E

We report results of two case studies in which MSIO sampling was successfully applied <b>to</b> <b>evaluating</b> complex graphical outputs...|$|R
