For example, in delusional jealousy, where a person believes that their partner is being unfaithful (and may even follow them into the bathroom believing them <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>seeing</b> their lover even during the briefest of partings), it may actually be true that the partner is having sexual relations with another person. In this case, the delusion does not cease to be a delusion because the content later turns out to be verified as true or the partner actually chose to engage in the behavior of which they were being accused.|$|E

[...] Joss Whedon did state that the show would be autonomous from The Avengers, saying [...] "It's gotta be a show that works for people who haven't seen the Marvel movies. It will please Marvel fans, I think." [...] He reiterated that sentiment {{in an interview at}} the 2012 Toronto International Film Festival, explaining [...] "It's new characters. It needs to be its own thing. It needs to be adjacent ... What does S.H.I.E.L.D. have that the other superheroes don't?

[...] One group of female fans wore matching pink tops that said [...] "Bald Ambition" [...] on one side and [...] "The Comeback 2007" [...] on the other.
