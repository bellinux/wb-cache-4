25|$|In April 1957, Macmillan reaffirmed {{his strong}} support for the British nuclear weapons programme. A {{succession}} of prime ministers since the Second World War had been determined to persuade the United States to revive wartime co-operation in the area of nuclear weapons research. Macmillan believed <b>that</b> <b>one</b> <b>way</b> to encourage such co-operation would be for the United Kingdom to speed up the development of its own hydrogen bomb, which was successfully tested on 8 November 1957.|$|E
25|$|Long-term {{storage of}} {{radioactive}} waste requires the stabilization {{of the waste}} into a form which will neither react nor degrade for extended periods. It is theorized <b>that</b> <b>one</b> <b>way</b> to do this might be through vitrification. Currently at Sellafield the high-level waste (PUREX first cycle raffinate) is mixed with sugar and then calcined. Calcination involves passing the waste through a heated, rotating tube. The purposes of calcination are to evaporate {{the water from the}} waste, and de-nitrate the fission products to assist the stability of the glass produced.|$|E
25|$|Use of the {{empirical}} CFE equation (42), and {{the measurement of}} κ, may be of particular use for non-metals. Strictly, Fowler-Nordheim-type equations apply only to emission from the conduction band of bulk crystalline solids. However, empirical equations of form (42) should apply to all materials (though, conceivably, modification might be needed for very sharp emitters). It seems very likely <b>that</b> <b>one</b> <b>way</b> in which CFE equations for newer materials may differ from Fowler-Nordheim-type equations is that these CFE equations may have a different power of F (or V) in their pre-exponentials. Measurements of κ might provide some experimental indication of this.|$|E

25|$|When Mazuz asked Metzger {{to resign}} in 2005, the story {{initially}} sparked some {{debate over the}} necessity of having two Israeli Chief Rabbis at all, or of maintaining the Chief Rabbinate as an institution. Some suggested <b>that</b> <b>one</b> <b>way</b> of preserving the integrity and relevance of the office might be to convince the religious Ashkenazi communities of Israel to decline to hold elections to replace Metzger, should he resign. This move would have consolidated the post from two seats to one, and help eliminate {{one of the most}} public representations of the office's perceived anachronism often cited by its critics. However, since then there has been little follow-up.|$|E
25|$|Hilbert and Pólya {{suggested}} <b>that</b> <b>one</b> <b>way</b> {{to derive}} the Riemann hypothesis {{would be to}} find a self-adjoint operator, from the existence of which the statement on the real parts of the zeros of ζ(s) would follow when one applies the criterion on real eigenvalues. Some support for this idea comes from several analogues of the Riemann zeta functions whose zeros correspond to eigenvalues of some operator: the zeros of a zeta function of a variety over a finite field correspond to eigenvalues of a Frobenius element on an étale cohomology group, the zeros of a Selberg zeta function are eigenvalues of a Laplacian operator of a Riemann surface, and the zeros of a p-adic zeta function correspond to eigenvectors of a Galois action on ideal class groups.|$|E

The CAMC believes <b>that</b> <b>one</b> <b>way</b> to meet this goal is to identify, recognize and reward excellence in mathematics through a series of national contests called the American Mathematics Competitions. The AMC include: the American Mathematics Contest 8 (AMC 8) (formerly the American Junior High School Mathematics Examination) for students in grades 8 and below, begun in 1985; the American Mathematics Contest 10 (AMC 10), for students in grades 9 and 10, begun in 2000; the American Mathematics Contest 12 (AMC 12) (formerly the American High School Mathematics Examination) for students in grades 11 and 12, begun in 1950; the American Invitational Mathematics Examination (AIME), begun in 1983; and the USA Mathematical Olympiad (USAMO), begun in 1972.|$|E

2500|$|The Hawkeye had {{directed}} additional Tomcats to close with the airliner, {{and it began}} {{to communicate with the}} Boeing 737 on a VHF frequency demanding it divert to Sigonella, Italy. When the pilot of the EgyptAir Boeing 737 refused to comply, the Hawkeye gave the command to the Tomcats [...] "Lights on, now!" [...] With the illumination of the American aircraft, the Egyptian pilot suddenly realized he was surrounded by advanced war planes. The Hawkeye relayed to the Boeing <b>that</b> <b>one</b> <b>way</b> or another they must reach Sigonella. The Egyptian pilot later reported that the American fighter pilots had ordered him to comply with their commands or be shot down.

2500|$|He found <b>that</b> <b>one</b> <b>way</b> {{to enhance}} his pitches was to extemporize his commercials, {{poking fun at}} the {{sponsors}} (while never showing disrespect for the products themselves), the sponsors' company executives, and advertising agency types who wrote the scripted commercials that he regularly ignored. (If he read them at all, he ridiculed them or even threw aside the scripts {{in front of the}} cameras.) To the surprise of the advertising agencies and sponsors, Godfrey's kidding of the commercials and products frequently enhanced the sales of those products. His popularity and ability to sell brought a windfall to CBS, accounting for a significant percentage of their corporate profits. [...] While his willingness to mock the scripted commercials provided to him by sponsors' ad agencies angered those agencies, the sponsored, concerned only with improving their sales, were happy to let Godfrey tear apart those scripts (even physically on occasion).|$|E
2500|$|Some Ming dynasty Taoist sects {{believed}} <b>that</b> <b>one</b> <b>way</b> for men {{to achieve}} longevity or 'towards immortality' is by having intercourse with virgins, particularly young virgins.

Zhao Liangpi concludes that the ideal ding is a premenarche virgin just under 14 years of age and women older than 18 should be avoided. Zhang Sanfeng went further and divided ding into three ranks: the lowest rank, 21- to 25-year-old women; the middle rank, 16- to 20-year-old menstruating virgins; the highest rank, 14-year-old premenarche virgins.|$|E
