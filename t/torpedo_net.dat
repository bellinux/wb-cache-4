500|$|Triumph {{participated in}} the main attack on the Narrows forts on 18 March, and fired on Ottoman {{trenches}} at Achi Baba on 15 April. On 18 April, one of her picket boats and one from Majestic torpedoed and sank the British submarine , which had run aground near Fort Dardanos and {{was in danger of}} being captured by Ottoman forces. Triumph supported the main landing by the Anzac forces at Gaba Tepe on 25 April, and continued to support them through May. On 25 May, the ship was underway off Gaba Tepe, firing on Ottoman positions, with torpedo nets out and most watertight doors shut, when she sighted a submarine periscope [...] off her starboard beam at about 1230 hours. It belonged to the U-boat [...] under the command [...] of Lieutenant Otto Hersing.Triumph opened fire on the periscope, but was almost immediately struck by a torpedo, which easily cut through her <b>torpedo</b> <b>net,</b> on her starboard side. A tremendous explosion resulted, and Triumph took on a list 10° to starboard. She held that list for about five minutes, then it increased to 30°. The destroyer [...] evacuated most of her crew before she capsized ten minutes later. She remained afloat upside down for about 30 minutes, then began to sink slowly in about [...] of water. Three officers and 75 enlisted men died in her sinking.|$|E
2500|$|At 12:20 Evstafi, with a {{clear view}} of the Ottomans, opened fire on Yavuz, {{striking}} and disabling the third starboard [...] casemated gun with its first salvo. The Russian battleships were using a new form of fire control that had been devised in the aftermath of the Russo-Japanese War, with Ioann Zlatoust directing for all other ships except Rostislav, which had a different main armament. The 12-inch shell had passed through the casemate armour and barely penetrated a 150mm plate before detonating. Splinters badly damaged the ship's <b>torpedo</b> <b>net.</b> It also detonated three [...] high explosive shells and set 16 cartridges on fire. The resulting explosion tore a square meter-sized hole in the side of the ship and killed the gun's crew. The flash fire traveled down the munitions elevator and up into the fourth starboard casemate, which was temporarily abandoned.|$|E

50|$|The sinking by torpedo {{of three}} Allied battleships during the 1915 Dardanelles Campaign, all with torpedo nets deployed, {{demonstrated}} that the increased speed of newer torpedoes and the tactic of firing several torpedoes at the same location on the target had made the <b>torpedo</b> <b>net</b> ineffective. Torpedo nets were superseded by the anti-torpedo bulge and torpedo belts.|$|E
50|$|On 24 January 1945, Abele left Pearl Harbor, {{bound for}} Iwo Jima. After sailing via Eniwetok and Guam with Task Group 51.5, the ship arrived off Iwo Jima on 20 February and began laying a <b>torpedo</b> <b>net.</b> She {{remained}} {{in the area for}} eight days laying nets and fleet moorings before getting underway on the 28th and heading for Saipan to prepare for the upcoming Okinawa invasion.|$|E

50|$|The first {{land vehicle}} wire cutter to be {{demonstrated}} was fitted to the Killen-Strait tractor, during a demonstration in 1915. This used a pre-existing design of <b>torpedo</b> <b>net</b> cutter, {{intended for use}} on submarines. Despite the tactical importance of removing barbed wire barriers during World War I, this type of cutter was not attempted in the field. Heavy tanks were used simply to crush the obstacles.|$|E
50|$|From 1885 onwards, the {{organisation}} received further orders from J. Samuel White of Cowes, Isle of Wight, for main power and generating machinery for Royal Navy torpedo boats. The companies subsequently went {{in a limited}} production partnership, with Morcom also assisting White in Royal Navy trials of early versions of the <b>torpedo</b> <b>net.</b> In 1887, the Royal Navy placed an order directly with Belliss and Morcom for triple-expansion engine-based main power and generator set for all 13 of the Sharpshooter class torpedo gunboats, designed by White.|$|E

25|$|Really a {{mine and}} not a bomb, it worked by {{skimming}} like a pebble over water to jump over <b>torpedo</b> <b>nets.</b> It was then designed to hit the dam and roll down to 30 feet where the water pressure caused detonation.|$|R
50|$|Some of {{the better}} known weapons trialled were the seaborne Bouncing bomb {{designed}} specifically to bounce to a target such as across water to avoid <b>torpedo</b> <b>nets,</b> Anti-submarine missile AMUCK and the expendable acoustic emitter (designed to confuse noise seeking torpedoes).|$|R
50|$|Jencks, {{a fourth}} {{generation}} Californian, {{was born in}} Oakland, California, in 1921. As a child, he vacationed during the summer at Fallen Leaf Lake near Lake Tahoe, where his family had opened a resort (present-day Stanford Sierra Camp). He initially enrolled at the University of California, Berkeley, but left to join the U.S. military during World War II. He served as a commanding officer for several harbor defense vessels, which placed anti-submarine nets and <b>torpedo</b> <b>net</b> throughout the Aleutian Islands and the Caribbean Sea during the war. He enrolled at Stanford University after the war, where he earned both his bachelor's degree (1946) and his law degree (1948).|$|E
50|$|At 12:20 Evstafi, with a {{clear view}} of the Ottomans, opened fire on Yavuz, {{striking}} and disabling the third starboard 15 cm casemated gun with its first salvo. The Russian battleships were using a new form of fire control that had been devised in the aftermath of the Russo-Japanese War, with Ioann Zlatoust directing for all other ships except Rostislav, which had a different main armament. The 12-inch shell had passed through the casemate armour and barely penetrated a 150 mm plate before detonating.

50|$|Recommissioned 14 February 1952 and {{assigned}} to the 5th Naval District, Nahant installed and tended harbor defense nets within that district until 1 March 1954, when she temporarily assumed duties as a salvage vessel. By 28 May, however, diving equipment and a decompression chamber had been permanently installed and Nahant was converted into a ship of dual mission: salvage ship and net tender. From that time until 1968, Nahant participated in Mine Hunting Unit operations, harbor clearance projects, NATO and Atlantic Fleet training operations, mining operations, <b>torpedo</b> <b>net</b> laying and recovery operations, fleet service mine tests, harbor defense operations and training exercises, and experimental mine and net test and evaluation exercises. Such operations took Nahant, homeported first at Little Creek, Virginia, and later at Charleston, South Carolina, {{as far north as}} Naval Station Argentia and as far south as Cuba. Nahant decommissioned on 30 September 1968 and was struck from the Naval Register 1 October.|$|E
50|$|He was {{considered}} by many to be a crack marksman and innovator, but unfit for field command. Berdan subsequently invented numerous engines of war, including a twin-screw submarine gunboat, a torpedo boat for evading <b>torpedo</b> <b>nets,</b> a long-distance rangefinder and a distance fuse for shrapnel.|$|R
50|$|Assigned to the 3rd Naval District, Minerva {{served as}} a patrol boat in the coastal waters of the New York City area {{for the rest of}} World War I. She also guarded the {{submarine}} <b>nets</b> and <b>torpedo</b> <b>nets</b> in the approaches to New York Harbor.|$|R
25|$|The {{ship was}} fitted with <b>torpedo</b> <b>netting</b> and spars in 1887. At {{some point in}} the 1890s, Cerberus was retasked as a storeship. In May 1900, one of the ship's company began to show the {{symptoms}} of the bubonic plague. Consequently, all of Cerberus personnel were quarantined at Point Nepean.|$|R
5000|$|Early booms {{were made}} of wood, {{originally}} 10 in in diameter but increased in the 1880s to 12 in. Each boom weighed 20 to 24 long cwt kg and cost £28 to £30. In the House of Commons on 9 April 1888 Admiral Field, who was MP for Eastbourne, asserted that steel booms designed by William Bullivant were at least 5 long cwt kg lighter, one-third less expensive and [...] "superior in many other respects", and asked Lord George Hamilton, First Lord of the Admiralty whether the Committee on <b>Torpedo</b> <b>Net</b> Defence had recommended steel booms and whether the Admiralty would further test them. In reply the First Sea Lord claimed that steel booms doubled up on impact, were more vulnerable to accidental damage and were harder to repair aboard a ship, whereas wooden ones were easier to replace. His Lordship further stated that the steel booms that the Committee favoured were of a different type to those designed by Bullivant.|$|E
50|$|The Chariot force sailed from Falmouth with MTB 74 towed by Campbeltown. The MTB was {{equipped}} with three Packard engines capable of almost 40 knots (74 km/h) and two Ford V8s which were designed for manoeuvring at 6 kn. Too fast with one combination of engines and too slow with the other, the MTB was put onto tow until the convoy reached St. Nazaire. The ships crossed 400 mi of open sea and were three miles (5 km) up the Loire estuary before the Germans opened fire. Campbeltown, which was flying the German ensign, immediately replied in German by Morse and Aldis lamp, and the enemy batteries held their fire, allowing Campbeltown to move closer to the docks. At 1.27 am and closing on the gate, Campbeltown replaced the German flag and hauled up the British ensign. Under intense fire Campbeltown cut through the <b>torpedo</b> <b>net</b> and rammed the dock gates at 1.34. Wynn, who had been cast off from Campbeltown, was ordered to fire his two torpedoes at his secondary target, the gate at the old entrance. Wynn reported to Commander Ryder and was congratulated on his success with a swift drink from a flask.|$|E
5000|$|Upon {{completion}} of her refit in January 1915, Triumph {{was transferred to}} the Dardanelles for service in the Dardanelles Campaign. The ship departed Hong Kong on 12 January and stopped at Suez from 7 February to 12 February before moving on to join the Dardanelles Squadron. Triumph took part in the opening attack on the entrance forts on 18 February and 19 February, and joined the predreadnoughts [...] and [...] in using her secondary battery to silence the fort at Sedd el Bahr on 25 February. She, Albion, and [...] were the first Allied battleships to enter the Turkish Straits during the campaign when they carried out the initial attack on the inner forts on 26 February. She also took part in the attack on Fort Dardanos on 2 March 1915. She and Swiftsure were detached from the Dardanelles on 5 March for operations against forts at Smyrna, returning to the Dardanelles on 9 March.Triumph participated in the main attack on the Narrows forts on 18 March, and fired on Ottoman trenches at Achi Baba on 15 April. On 18 April, one of her picket boats and one from Majestic torpedoed and sank the British submarine , which had run aground near Fort Dardanos and was in danger of being captured by Ottoman forces. Triumph supported the main landing by the Anzac forces at Gaba Tepe on 25 April, and continued to support them through May. On 25 May, the ship was underway off Gaba Tepe, firing on Ottoman positions, with torpedo nets out and most watertight doors shut, when she sighted a submarine periscope 300 to 400 yd off her starboard beam at about 1230 hours. It belonged to the U-boat [...] under the command of Lieutenant Otto Hersing.Triumph opened fire on the periscope, but was almost immediately struck by a torpedo, which easily cut through her <b>torpedo</b> <b>net,</b> on her starboard side.

5000|$|Three {{destroyer}} divisions {{attacked the}} Russian fleet in port, firing {{a total of}} 18 torpedoes. However, only two Russian battleships were seriously damaged due to the proper deployment of <b>torpedo</b> <b>nets.</b> The Russian flagship, the battleship , which had her nets deployed, had at least four enemy torpedoes [...] "hung up" [...] in them, and other warships were similarly saved from further damage.|$|R
50|$|The {{ships of}} the Brandenburg-class were 113.9 m long at the {{waterline}} and 115.7 m long overall. They had {{a beam of}} 19.5 m which was increased to 19.74 m {{with the addition of}} <b>torpedo</b> <b>nets,</b> and had a draft of 7.6 m forward and 7.9 m aft. The Brandenburgs displaced 10,013 MT at their designed weight, and up to 10,670 MT at full combat load.|$|R
