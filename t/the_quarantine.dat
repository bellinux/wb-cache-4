The ShadowNet {{infrastructure}} for insider cyber attack pre-vention {{is comprised of}} a tiered server system that is able to dynami-cally redirect dangerous/suspicious network traffic away from production servers that provide web, ftp, database and other vital services to cloned virtual machines in a quarantined environment. This is done transpar-ently {{from the point of}} view of both the attacker and normal users. Existing connections, such as SSH sessions, are not interrupted. Any malicious activity performed by the attacker on a quarantined server is not reflected on the production server. The attacker is provided ser-vices from <b>the</b> <b>quarantined</b> server, which creates the impression that the attacks performed are successful. The activities of the attacker on <b>the</b> <b>quarantined</b> system are able to be recorded much like a honeypot system for forensic analysis. ...|$|R
