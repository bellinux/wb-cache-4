In its place, condiments such as soy sauce, {{fish sauce}} and oyster sauce tend <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>high</b> sodium content and fill a similar role to table salt in western cultures. They are most often used for cooking rather than as table condiments.|$|E
5|$|The Koch {{index is}} the ratio between peak {{steering}} torque {{and the product}} of peak lean rate and forward speed. Large, touring motorcycles tend <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>high</b> Koch index, sport motorcycles {{tend to have a}} medium Koch index, and scooters tend to have a low Koch index. It is easier to maneuver light scooters than heavy motorcycles.|$|E
5|$|As a result, it is {{both the}} {{percentage}} of GC base pairs and the overall length of a DNA double helix that determines {{the strength of the}} association between the two strands of DNA. Long DNA helices with a high GC-content have stronger-interacting strands, while short helices with high AT content have weaker-interacting strands. In biology, parts of the DNA double helix that need to separate easily, such as the TATAAT Pribnow box in some promoters, tend <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>high</b> AT content, making the strands easier to pull apart.|$|E

5|$|As such, {{the role}} of the Army Reserve now {{encompasses}} the '3 Rs'—that is reinforcement, round-out and rotation. With a total strength in 2005–06 of just 15,579 active personnel, recruitment and retention remain an ongoing issue for Defence planners, nevertheless Reservists continue <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>high</b> training obligation. Since September 2006, in an incentive to rectify sliding retention rates, Reservist salaries have been streamlined with those of regular forces as a reflection of overall higher standard of training. This initiative shows that in recent decades, there are now many positions for which there is little training gap at all between Reservists and Permanent Force members. In 2008–09 total strength included 17,064 active personnel. In addition there were another 12,496 members of the Standby Reserve.|$|E
5|$|Hormonal {{therapy is}} only {{beneficial}} in {{certain types of}} endometrial cancer. It was {{once thought to be}} beneficial in most cases. If a tumor is well-differentiated and known to have progesterone and estrogen receptors, progestins may be used in treatment. About 25% of metastatic endometrioid cancers show a response to progestins. Also, endometrial stromal sarcomas can be treated with hormonal agents, including tamoxifen, hydroxyprogesterone caproate, letrozole, megestrol acetate, and medroxyprogesterone. This treatment is effective in endometrial stromal sarcomas because they typically have estrogen and/or progestin receptors. Progestin receptors function as tumor suppressors in endometrial cancer cells. Preliminary research and clinical trials have shown these treatments <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>high</b> rate of response even in metastatic disease.|$|E
5|$|In New York, {{the city}} asked commuters to avoid driving unless necessary, and {{apartment}} buildings to stop incinerating their residents' garbage and turn heating down to 60°F (15°C). New Jersey and Connecticut asked their residents not to travel, {{and to use}} less power and heat. Although it was a workday, traffic was light in New York City. A check on 303 buildings of the New York City Housing Authority later found near-total cooperation with the city's requests.

40|$|CgSS 2010 (家户卷) 调查数据表明,相对于男性,客观社会经济地位明显弱势的农村妇女,在主观上倾向于做出更高的阶层认同。本文探讨了农村妇女的阶层认同之特征和影响因素。通过AnOVA分析和多元回归分析,文章发现,性别是影响农村阶层认同的重要因素,其中,农村妇女的阶层认同来源于配偶和自身社会经济地位的共同影响,社会经济地位代际传递的影响不显著。总体来看,个人或配偶具有高收入、配偶属于共产党员、从事非农职业劳动和养育子女(尤其儿子) 等条件下的农村妇女更可能做出较高的阶层认同。The 2010 CGSS(Household) {{survey data}} indicates,although {{compared}} with men,rural women usually be {{in a more}} disadvantageous social status,they tend <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>higher</b> class identity. Based on the ANOVA analysis and multiple regression analysis,this paper explores the influencing factors of rural women's class identity,and figures out that gender {{is one of the}} key influential factors. Rural women's class identity is influenced by both the social status of their own and that of their spouses'. Furthermore,the intergenerational transmission is not significant. If the rural women or their spouses <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>higher</b> income or <b>a</b> membership of CCP,they are more likely <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>higher</b> class identity. Besides,those women,who are engaged in non-agriculture job or parenting children(especially sons),tend <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>higher</b> class identity...|$|R

A study was recently done {{on how well}} four different breeds (Labrador Retriever, Golden Retriever, Labrador Retriever/Golden Retriever Mix, and German Shepherds) trained to become guide dogs. In this experiment, German Shepherds had the highest chance of not completing it. Labrador Retrievers and Labrador Retriever/Golden Retriever Mix had the highest success rate. However, German Shepherds and Golden Retrievers had a higher success rate after going through longer training than the training required for Labrador Retrievers.|$|E
5|$|One {{measure of}} an instrument's {{usefulness}} {{is to see}} how closely it agrees with another similar instrument that has been validated against information from a clinical interview by a trained clinician. In this respect, the BDI-II is positively correlated with the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale with a Pearson r of 0.71, showing good agreement. The test was also shown <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>high</b> one-week test–retest reliability (Pearson r =0.93), suggesting {{that it was not}} overly sensitive to daily variations in mood. The test also has high internal consistency (α=.91).|$|E
5|$|The Thin Man gun-type {{design was}} at that time based on the fissibility of the very pure plutonium-239 isotope so far only {{produced}} in microgram quantities by the Berkeley cyclotron. When the Hanford production reactors came on-line in early 1944, the mix of plutonium-239 and plutonium-240 obtained was found <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>high</b> rate of spontaneous fission. To avoid pre-detonation, the muzzle velocity of the gun-type design would need to be greatly raised, making it impractically long.|$|E

5|$|In 2000, a study scrutinised {{two major}} {{populations of the}} Swayne's hartebeest, from the Senkele Wildlife Sanctuary and the Nechisar National Park, for {{mitochondrial}} (D-loop) and nuclear (microsatellite) variability {{in an attempt to}} estimate the levels of genetic variation between the populations and within the subspecies. The results showed a remarkable differentiation between the two populations; that from the Senkele Wildlife Sanctuary showed more genetic diversity than the one from the Nechisar National Park. Another revelation was that the translocation of the individuals from the Senkele Wildlife Sanctuary in 1974 had not made a significant contribution to the gene pool of the Nechisar National Park. Additionally, the Swayne hartebeest populations were compared with a large red hartebeest population, and both subspecies were found <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>high</b> degree of genetic variation. The study advocated in situ conservation of the Swayne's hartebeest and a renewed attempt at its translocation in order to conserve genetic diversity and increase its population size in both the protected areas.|$|E
5|$|Production on {{the game}} started at the {{beginning}} of 2001 with a team of only four programmers. Since Resident Evil was one of Capcom's first titles developed for the GameCube, the development team had to study the system's performance during the first stages of development. Initially, the team considered the possibility of creating the game's environments with computer graphic animation, but then realized that this approach would require too much hardware capacity and processing to achieve realistic graphics. As a result, the graphical style of the remake features 3D models over pre-rendered backgrounds like the Resident Evil games for the PlayStation. Despite this, the camera is more dynamic and can track the player at varying angles. The backgrounds also make use of particle effects and full motion video layers to simulate effects such as rushing water or swaying tree branches. Causing fear to the player was a high priority, and many of the game's backgrounds were designed <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>high</b> contrast between dark and light so that enemies could appear unexpectedly.|$|E
5|$|The 2011 NHL Entry Draft {{was held}} in St. Paul, Minnesota, on June 24 and 25. In the draft, Columbus {{selected}} two players who were projected to go higher in the draft. Boone Jenner, a projected second line center, {{was expected to be}} a first-round selection, but slipped to the second round. Seth Ambroz, a projected third line enforcer, had some believing he would be taken in the second round prior to falling to the fifth. They filled out the other the remainder of their draft with players considered <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>high</b> upside, but in need of time to develop their game. Their final selection, goaltender Anton Forsberg, was taken following the recommendation of Goaltender Coach Ian Clark. Jenner (Canada), third round pick T. J. Tynan (United States), and Forsberg (Sweden) all played for their national teams at the 2012 World Junior Championship.|$|E

5|$|Three {{days before}} {{scheduled}} services were to start, {{permission to use}} the trains had still not been granted by the Norwegian Railway Inspectorate. The inspectorate had a series of safety concerns, including follow-up on the safety terms for the wheels and axles; lack of documentation of the crew's training; denying NSB's request to have fewer inspections and less maintenance on the trains; lack of consideration of critical events deemed <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>high</b> probability to occur but have a low consequence; lack of a safety inspector for operations and maintenance; and that the trains were so heavy that they would exceed the permitted axle load of the lines. Det Norske Veritas (DNV) warned against a possible weakness in the axles. NSB wanted to use an expert from Deutsche Bahn to perform the necessary tests, but limited availability of the expert resulted in the Norwegian National Rail Administration granting a half-year delay of the inspections.|$|E
