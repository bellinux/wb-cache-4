5|$|Pete is {{in talks}} with Mohawk Airlines for their return <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>agency.</b> The {{arrangement}} calls for Roger to handle the day-to-day business. Roger puts Peggy in charge of hiring a new male copywriter for Mohawk. Stan advises her to hire a mediocre employee to make her competition lighter. Peggy, however, chooses to interview a talented young Jewish man named Michael Ginsberg whose work impresses her. When Peggy interviews Michael, he is over-the-top in his disposition. However, Roger forces her to bring Michael to Don. During his interview with Don, Michael is more upstanding and professional, which puzzles Peggy. Michael is hired. He returns home to find his domineering father reading the paper. Michael's personality changes yet again, this time more shy and reserved. When he learns of his son's success, Michael's father blesses his son with a Jewish prayer.|$|E
5|$|After soccer practice, Bart {{waits for}} Homer {{to pick him}} up, though his father has forgotten. When Homer finally remembers, he reasons to an angered Bart that they should just both admit they are wrong and try to put the issue behind them. Later, Bart views a {{commercial}} for a mentor program called The Bigger Brothers, which pairs up fatherless boys with positive male role models. Still angry at Homer, Bart goes <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>agency</b> {{pretending to be a}} young boy whose father was a drunken gambler who abandoned him. Bart's story is so sad that the receptionist pairs him up with their best Bigger Brother, a military test pilot named Tom. The two spend time together doing a variety of activities, though Bart begins to feel guilty over taking up Tom's time despite not actually being fatherless. Eventually, Homer finds out about Bart's Bigger Brother and confronts Bart for it. Homer then decides to go to the Bigger Brothers Agency to get revenge by being assigned with a replacement son; a young poor boy named Pepi. Just like Tom and Bart, Homer and Pepi spend time together doing activities.|$|E

50|$|Structured {{investment}} was very profitable <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>agencies</b> and by 2007 accounted for just under half of Moody's total ratings revenue {{and all of}} the revenue growth.

Thus there was a conflict of interest between accommodating clients - for whom higher ratings meant higher earnings - and accurately rating the debt {{for the benefit of the}} debt buyer/investors - who provided zero revenue <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>agencies.</b>|$|R
