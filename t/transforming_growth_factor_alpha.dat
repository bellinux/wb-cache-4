50|$|<b>Transforming</b> <b>growth</b> <b>factor</b> <b>alpha</b> (TGF-α) is {{a protein}} that in humans is encoded by the TGFA gene.

40|$|<b>Transforming</b> <b>growth</b> <b>factors</b> have a {{wide range}} of {{biological}} activities related to cell proliferation and differentiation. In general TGF-alpha promotes cell proliferation while TGF-beta may stimulate or inhibit proliferation depending on the cell type and <b>growth</b> <b>factor</b> environment. Cultured human keratinocytes, skin and oral squamous cell carcinomas were analysed for the presence of transcripts and protein for the <b>transforming</b> <b>growth</b> <b>factors</b> <b>alpha</b> & beta. Both <b>growth</b> <b>factors</b> were detected in cultured keratinocytes (which have receptors for and respond to both ligands), and in medium conditioned by these cells. Additionally transcripts for TGF-alpha were found preferentially in the basal, proliferative compartment of cultured keratinocytes. Similarly both <b>growth</b> <b>factors</b> were detected in oral squamous cell carcinomas and a highly significant inverse correlation was found between the levels of TGF-alpha and the epidermal <b>growth</b> <b>factor</b> receptor in these tumours. The data for TGF-alpha are consistent with the existence of an autocrine growth control loop influencing cell proliferation in both a normal cell type and malignant epithelial tissues, a process that in keratinocytes and responsive squamous cell carcinomas could be modulated by TGF-beta...|$|R

40|$|Cardiac {{allograft}} vasculopathy {{is thought}} to be triggered by an alloreactive response to the donor coronary vasculature, resulting in smooth muscle cell proliferation and ultimate occlusion of the donor coronary arteries. To determine whether allogeneic lymphocytes are capable of regulating endothelial-derived smooth muscle cell (SMC) <b>growth</b> <b>factors,</b> human aortic endothelial cells (HAECs) were exposed to allogeneic lymphocytes. The HAEC-lymphocyte co-cultures were assessed for (a) lymphocyte proliferation in response to the allogeneic HAECs; (b) release of soluble factors that stimulate human aortic SMC proliferation; and (c) alteration of HAEC mRNA levels for a panel of known SMC <b>growth</b> <b>factors.</b> Co-culture conditioned medium increased SMC proliferation, compared to medium conditioned by HAECs alone. HAECs exposed to allogeneic lymphocytes increased their expression of mRNA for basic fibroblast <b>growth</b> <b>factor,</b> <b>transforming</b> <b>growth</b> <b>factors</b> <b>alpha</b> and beta, and platelet derived <b>growth</b> <b>factor</b> A and B chains. These results demonstrate that allogeneic lymphocytes are capable of inducing HAECs to increase mRNA levels for several mesenchymal <b>growth</b> <b>factors</b> and to release bioactive products capable of stimulating SMC cell proliferation in vitro. Additionally, the data support the hypothesis that alloreactive lymphocytes can stimulate allogeneic donor endothelial cells to produce <b>growth</b> <b>factors</b> that may contribute to the intimal thickening seen in cardiac allograft vasculopathy...|$|R

40|$|Several <b>growth</b> <b>factors</b> are {{potential}} mediators of wound healing, although their actual roles, interactions, and therapeutic use are not established. Six well-characterized human <b>growth</b> <b>factors</b> {{were chosen for}} detailed investigation by topical application to standardized skin wounds in swine: epidermal <b>growth</b> <b>factor</b> (EGF), <b>transforming</b> <b>growth</b> <b>factors</b> <b>alpha</b> and beta (TGF-alpha and TGF-beta), fibroblast <b>growth</b> <b>factor</b> (FGF), insulin-like <b>growth</b> factor-I (IGF-I), and platelet-derived <b>growth</b> <b>factor</b> (PDGF). When applied singly in doses up to 1, 500 ng, only TGF-beta produced a marked tissue response, as demonstrated {{by an increase in}} the new connective tissue volume, the collagen content and maturity, and increased angiogenesis. However, TGF-beta enhanced inflammation and caused abnormal epithelial differentiation and decreased epithelial volume, the last reversed by addition of IGF-I. Recombinant PDGF- 2 homodimer, if given in combination with recombinant IGF-I, caused a similar increase in the new connective tissue volume and collagen content and maturity, but without increased inflammation. In addition, this combination stimulated increased amounts of epithelium with normal differentiation. The synergy of PDGF- 2 and IGF-I was optimal at a ratio of 2 : 1 by weight. Of the six individual factors and nine combinations tested, the combinations of PDGF- 2 and IGF-I or PDGF- 2 and TGF-alpha were the most potent stimulators of healing in the absence of increased inflammation...|$|R
40|$|Inhalation of fibrogenic {{particles}} causes {{injury to}} the bronchiolar-alveolar epithelium. Consequently, there is a rapid proliferative response as the epithelium recovers and interstitial mesenchymal cells divide and produce connective tissue. In our model of brief (5 -hr) exposure to chrysotile asbestos (- 1000 fibers/cc) in rats and mice, these events result in focal scarring at the bronchiolar-alveolar duct junctions in a histopathologic pattern identical to that seen in asbestos-exposed individuals. After 3 consecutive days of exposure, these lesions persist for at least 6 months postexposure. We postulate that cell proliferation and production of extracellular matrix is mediated {{in large part by}} three peptide <b>growth</b> <b>factors,</b> <b>transforming</b> <b>growth</b> <b>factors</b> <b>alpha</b> and beta (TGF-c and-P), and platelet-derived <b>growth</b> <b>factor</b> (PDGF) A- and B-chains. To test this hypothesis in part, we have asked whether the genes that code for these <b>growth</b> <b>factor</b> proteins are activated at sites of asbestos-induced lung injury.

40|$|The mucosa of the {{functioning}} pelvic ileal pouch undergoes loss of villous height {{and an increase}} in crypt cell proliferation as an adaptive response to its new luminal environment. These changes can occur in the absence of inflammation and could be mediated by <b>growth</b> <b>factors</b> such as <b>transforming</b> <b>growth</b> <b>factors</b> <b>alpha</b> and beta 1 (TGF alpha and TGF beta 1). Expression of TGF alpha and TGF beta 1 messenger RNA (mRNA) and protein was determined by in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry in sections of terminal ileum taken at the time of pouch formation and of subsequent pouch biopsies from 14 patients (total of 90 specimens). Crypt cell proliferation was assessed using the monoclonal antibody MIB- 1. As ileal pouch mucosa underwent loss of villous height and crypt hyperplasia, epithelial expression of TGF alpha mRNA and protein decreased. In contrast, TGF beta 1 mRNA and protein were abundant in both normal and flat mucosa. Epithelial expression of TGF beta 1 protein was maximal in flat, inflamed biopsies. These results suggest that although altered expression of TGF alpha and TGF beta 1 mRNA and protein may play some part in the regulation of the adaptive response in ileal pouch mucosa, TGF alpha does not have a direct, positive role in the regulation of crypt cell proliferation...|$|R
40|$|Previous {{studies have}} shown that <b>transforming</b> <b>growth</b> <b>factor</b> <b>alpha</b> is {{expressed}} during rodent development. To establish the site(s) of <b>transforming</b> <b>growth</b> <b>factor</b> <b>alpha</b> mRNA expression during rat embryogensis, we performed in situ hybridization and Northern blot analyses on samples of embryonic and maternal tissues at various gestational ages. Our results indicate that the high levels of <b>transforming</b> <b>growth</b> <b>factor</b> <b>alpha</b> mRNA that are observed during early development are the result of expression in the maternal decidua and not in the embryo. Decidual expression appears to be induced after implantation, peaks at day 8, and then slowly declines through day 15 at which time the decidua is being resorbed. Expression of <b>transforming</b> <b>growth</b> <b>factor</b> <b>alpha</b> mRNA is highest in that region of the decidua adjacent to the embryo and is low or nondetectable in the uterus, placenta, and other maternal tissues. The developmentally regulated expression of <b>transforming</b> <b>growth</b> <b>factor</b> <b>alpha</b> mRNA in the decidua, together with the presence of epidermal growth factor receptors in this tissue, suggests that <b>transforming</b> <b>growth</b> <b>factor</b> <b>alpha</b> stimulates proliferation locally through an autocrine mechanism.

40|$|BACKGROUND [...] Previous {{studies have}} shown the {{importance}} of <b>transforming</b> <b>growth</b> <b>factors</b> <b>alpha</b> and beta (TGF alpha and TGF beta) in modulating epithelial cell restitution after injury in vitro. AIM [...] To investigate {{the role of the}} <b>growth</b> <b>factors</b> TGF <b>alpha</b> and TGF beta after acute epithelial injury in vivo. METHODS [...] An in vivo model of phytohaemagglutinin (PHA) induced acute epithelial injury in rat small intestine was used. Epithelial cell turnover was assessed by autoradiography and liquid scintillation counting of thymidine uptake. Expression of TGF alpha and TGF beta was assessed by immunohistochemistry. RESULTS [...] An expansion of the proliferative compartment and increased turnover of intestinal epithelial cells was seen in rats with PHA induced intestinal epithelial injury. Expression of TGF alpha and TGF beta peptides was shown in both the epithelial cell and lamina propria compartment. Different patterns of TGF alpha and TGF beta expression were seen, however, within the epithelium of rats with acute intestinal injury compared with untreated controls, while the expression of these peptides within the lamina propria was not changed. CONCLUSIONS [...] These findings suggest that acute intestinal epithelial cell injury in vivo is associated with compensatory changes in expression of TGF alpha and TGF beta in the epithelial cell compartment, while the lamina propria {{does not seem to be}} significantly affected...|$|R
5000|$|Newborns {{have very}} {{immature}} and small [...] digestive systems, and colostrum delivers its nutrients {{in a very}} concentrated low-volume form. It has a mild laxative effect, encouraging {{the passing of the}} baby's first stool, which is called meconium. This clears excess bilirubin, a waste-product of dead red blood cells, which is produced in large quantities at birth due to blood volume reduction from the infant's body and helps prevent jaundice. Colostrum is known to contain immune cells (as lymphocytes) and many antibodies such as IgA, [...] IgG, and IgM. These are some of the components of the adaptive immune system. In preterm infants some IgA may be absorbed through the intestinal epithelium and enter the blood stream though there is very little uptake in full term babies.

Other immune components of colostrum include the major components of the innate immune system, such as lactoferrin, lysozyme, lactoperoxidase, complement, and proline-rich polypeptides (PRP). A number of cytokines (small messenger peptides that control the functioning of the immune system) are found in colostrum as well, including interleukins, tumor necrosis factor, chemokines, and others.

Time course studies indicate that FCS can exert this enhancing effect when it is added several days after the transfection with T 24 DNA.

40|$|Summary Epidermal {{growth factor}} and <b>transforming</b> <b>growth</b> <b>factor</b> <b>alpha</b> are two {{peptides}} which bind to the {{epidermal growth factor}} receptor. One hundred and seventy-four samples from 133 patients with ovarian cancer were examined for EGF and TGFa. EGF was detected in only 27. 6 % of samples while TGFa was present in 88. 5 %. The median values for TGFa presence were at least 10 -fold greater than those of EGF. There was no statistical difference between either TGFa or EGF levels and degree of differentiation of the tumours. There was no statistical difference between stage three and four in relation to concentration of either peptide.

Epidermal growth factor (EGF) interacts with its receptor, epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR), initiating the responses which can lead to growth modulation. Additionally such ligand-receptor interaction induces pleiotropic effects in the cell including enhanced glycolysis, increased amino acid transport, calcium, sodium and hydrogen ion exchange and protein synthesis (Owen et al., 1982).

40|$|Ménétrier’s {{disease is}} a rare protein-losing hypertrophic gastropathy. Histologically, it can be mistaken for other {{disorders}} showing hypertrophic gastropathy. The pathogenesis of Ménétrier’s disease is not fully understood; however, {{it appears that the}} epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) ligand, <b>transforming</b> <b>growth</b> <b>factor</b> <b>alpha,</b> contributes to the pathogenesis of this disorder. In this review, we will discuss disease entities that can mimic Ménétrier’s disease and the role of EGFR signaling in Ménétrier’s disease...|$|E
40|$|<b>Transforming</b> <b>growth</b> <b>factor</b> <b>alpha</b> (TGF-alpha) is a transformation-responsive mitogenic {{polypeptide}} that {{is expressed}} in the brain, epithelial cells, and activated macrophages. We isolated and characterized the TGF-alpha promoter and localized the 5 ' end of the TGF-alpha transcript to a unique position. Surprisingly, no apparent TATA box was present in the promoter sequence, suggesting that transcription from mammalian genes can initiate at unique and specific positions from promoters lacking this sequence motif...|$|E
40|$|Platelet-derived <b>growth</b> <b>factor</b> (PDGF) {{has been}} implicated in several nonmalignant {{pathophysiological}} processes, including proliferative diseases of the kidney. Glomerular mesangial cells secrete a PDGF-like factor and express the PDGF A-chain and c-sis (or B-chain) mRNAs. We report here that both mRNAs are induced by serum and this effect can be mimicked by recombinant PDGF, which also markedly stimulates DNA synthesis. Other <b>growth</b> <b>factors,</b> such as epidermal <b>growth</b> <b>factor</b> (EGF), <b>transforming</b> <b>growth</b> <b>factor</b> type <b>alpha,</b> basic fibroblast <b>growth</b> <b>factor</b> (bFGF), and tumor necrosis <b>factor</b> type <b>alpha</b> (TNF-alpha) also are mitogenic for human mesangial cells and induce expression of the PDGF mRNAs. EGF, TNF-alpha, and bFGF also stimulate these cells to secrete a PDGF-like factor. Furthermore, anti-PDGF antibody partially abrogates the mitogenic effect of EGF, suggesting that mitogen-stimulated PDGF synthesis in mesangial cells is at least partly responsible for cell growth induced by other <b>growth</b> <b>factors.</b> In contrast to these results, <b>transforming</b> <b>growth</b> <b>factor</b> type beta (TGF-beta), while inducing both mRNAs, is not mitogenic, indicating that its effect on message levels can be dissociated from DNA synthesis. These data suggest that several peptide <b>growth</b> <b>factors</b> regulate the <b>growth</b> of mesangial cells and that PDGF may be an effector molecule that {{plays a role in}} the mitogenic response to many of these growth stimuli...|$|R
40|$|Inhalation of fibrogenic {{particles}} causes {{injury to}} the bronchiolar-alveolar epithelium. Consequently, there is a rapid proliferative response as the epithelium recovers and interstitial mesenchymal cells divide and produce connective tissue. In our model of brief (5 -hr) exposure to chrysotile asbestos (approximately 1000 fibers/cc) in rats and mice, these events result in focal scarring at the bronchiolar-alveolar duct junctions in a histopathologic pattern identical to that seen in asbestos-exposed individuals. After 3 consecutive days of exposure, these lesions persist for at least 6 months postexposure. We postulate that cell proliferation and production of extracellular matrix is mediated {{in large part by}} three peptide <b>growth</b> <b>factors,</b> <b>transforming</b> <b>growth</b> <b>factors</b> <b>alpha</b> and beta (TGF-alpha and -beta), and platelet-derived <b>growth</b> <b>factor</b> (PDGF) A- and B-chains. To test this hypothesis in part, we have asked whether the genes that code for these <b>growth</b> <b>factor</b> proteins are activated at sites of asbestos-induced lung injury. If these genes were not activated, it would be reasonable to suspect that other potent <b>growth</b> <b>factors</b> and cytokines released during lung injury could be the primary mediators of fibroproliferative lung disease. In the studies reported here, we show, by in situ hybridization (ISH) and immunohistochemistry, that the four genes and their concomitant proteins are expressed within 24 hr in the bronchiolar-alveolar epithelium and underlying mesenchymal cells. RNase protection assay and ISH showed that the PDGF gene was upregulated during the first 5 hr of exposure and all the gene products remained above control levels for at least 2 weeks postexposure. TGF-alpha is a potent mitogen for epithelial cells, whereas the PDGF isoforms are potent <b>growth</b> <b>factors</b> for mesenchymal cells. TGF-beta retards fibroblast growth but stimulates extracellular matrix synthesis. Further studies using gene knockouts, appropriate antibodies, or antisense technology will be necessary to prove whether any of the <b>growth</b> <b>factors</b> are playing a significant role in fibrogenic lung disease. In addition, we have carried out a series of studies using type II alveolar epithelial cells purified from adult mouse lungs and maintained for up to 8 weeks in serum-free culture. These cells exhibit high transepithelial resistance values and they release TGF-beta 1 and -beta 2. This cell type also has been cultured from TGF-alpha knockout mice, resulting in monolayers with increased transepithelial resistance. This combination of studies in vivo and in vitro will allow us to pursue the mechanisms through which <b>growth</b> <b>factors</b> mediate lung fibrosis...|$|R
40|$|The new {{functionality}} of {{the program}} CONGEN (Bruccoleri RE, Karplus M, 1987, Biopolymers 26 : 137 - 168; Bassolino-Klimas D et al., 1996, Protein Sci 5 : 593 - 603) has been applied for energy refinement of two previously determined solution NMR structures, murine epidermal <b>growth</b> <b>factor</b> (mEGF) and human type-alpha <b>transforming</b> <b>growth</b> <b>factor</b> (hTGF <b>alpha).</b> A summary of considerations used in converting experimental NMR data into distance constraints for CONGEN is presented. A general protocol for simulated annealing with restrained molecular dynamics is applied to generate NMR solution structures using CONGEN together with real experimental NMR data. A total of 730 NMR-derived constraints for mEGF and 424 NMR-derived constraints for hTGF alpha were used in these energy-refinement calculations. Different weighting schemes and starting conformations were studied to check and/or improve the sampling of the low-energy conformational space {{that is consistent with}} all constraints. The results demonstrate that loosened (i. e., "relaxed") sets of the EGF and hTGF alpha internuclear distance constraints allow molecules to overcome local minima in the search for a global minimum with respect to both distance restraints and conformational energy. The resulting energy-refined structures of mEGF and hTGF alpha are compared with structures determined previously and with structures of homologous proteins determined by NMR and X-ray crystallography...|$|R
