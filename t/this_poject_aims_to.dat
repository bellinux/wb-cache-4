40|$|Abstract Mycolic acids {{are major}} {{components}} of the cell wall of Mycobacterium tuberculosis and other mycobacteria. They are usually long chain high molecular mass branched ~- hydroxy fatty acids, containing 70 - 90 carbons, a-alkyl (C 22 -C 24) and containing different functionalities in the main chain. Their presence is thought to explain the characteristic resistance of these mycobacteria to most antibiotics and other chemotherapeutic agents. Synthetic mycolic acids have applications in the detection and treatment of tuberculosis and {{in the treatment of}} asthma. <b>This</b> <b>P!oject</b> consists of three parts. The first part was to synthesise (R,R) -epoxy-trans-alkene-mycolic acid (I) and (S,S) -epoxy-trans-alkene-mycolic acid (11). The target for this part of the project was an epoxy-mycolate present in the cell wall of Mycobacterium fortuitum. Two synthetic stereoisomers (I) and (11) were compared by 'n and l 3 C NMR spectra with natural epoxy-trans-alkene mycolic acid and the stereochemistry of natural mycolic acid was also proved to be as in compound (11). The second part was to synthesise (S,R) -eis- cyclopropane (R,R) -epoxy-mycolic acid (Ill) and (S,R) -cis-cyclopropane (S,S) -epoxy- mycolic acid (IV) from Mycobacterium smegmatis. Two synthetic stereoisomers (Ill) and (IV) were compared by proton NMR spectroscopy with natural eis-cyclopropane epoxy mycolic acid isolated from M smegmatis. The third part was to synthesise (E/Z) - (R,R) -epoxy-alkene mycolic acid methyl ester (V) and (E/Z) -(S,S) -epoxy-alkene mycolic acid methyl ester (VI) from M smegmatis. An attempt was made to separate the (E/Z) -alkene-epoxy mycolic, acid methyl esters by silver ion TLC but was not successful. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R
40|$|In 1997 / 98 a {{follow-up}} of about 18. 000 subjects from three population-based MONICA-Augsburg surveys (aged 25 - 74 years at baseline) was conducted. The {{aim of this}} study was 1. to assess the survival status of all subjects and to update their address information, 2. to obtain information on the health status of all surviving subjects, 3. to validate self-reported heart attack information with medical records or information from the Myocardial Infarction Registry of Augsburg (MIR), and 4. to obtain the death certificates for the deceased persons from the local Health Departments. Almost 88 % of all subject involved were still living in the study area of Augsburg, about 5 % had moved out of the study area, and 7 % had already died (6 % of the MONICA participants and 10 % of the former non-participants). More than 17. 000 questionnaires concerning health related question have been mailed to the survivors in the frame of <b>this</b> <b>pojects.</b> The response rate was 56 % (n= 9631) for all subjects, 68 % for participants of former MONICA studies and 20 % for non-participants, respectively. 40 % of all self-reported heart attacks (n= 335) could be validated by MIR, 16 % of self-reported cases were not confirmed, 20 % could not be validated since these persons reported no hospital treatment, the remaining proportion did not satisfy the criteria for MIR (MI not in the study area, age #>=# 75 years, MI before 1984).
