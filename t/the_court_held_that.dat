5|$|In United States v. Gooding (1827), the Court {{construed}} {{the elements}} of the fitting out offense. First, <b>the</b> <b>Court</b> <b>held</b> <b>that</b> the offense of fitting out a vessel for slave trading could be committed even if the owner of the vessel did not personally fit it out. Second, <b>the</b> <b>Court</b> <b>held</b> <b>that</b> the statute could be violated by a partial fitting out (as opposed to a complete fitting out) of a vessel for that purpose. Third, the Court held thatsince slave trading was a misdemeanorthere was no distinction between principal and accessory. Fourth, <b>the</b> <b>Court</b> <b>held</b> <b>that,</b> for the statute to be violated, the fitting out must have occurred within the United States. Finally, <b>the</b> <b>Court</b> <b>held</b> <b>that</b> the statute's mens rea required that the owner intend to cause the vessel to be used for slave trading, as opposed to intending that the vessel be used for slave trading (by some third party).|$|E

5|$|The Marshall Court heard six {{original}} habeas {{cases of}} a criminal nature. All of the cases involved detention in the District of Columbia and prior proceedings in the United States Circuit Court of the District of Columbia.

In the first two cases, <b>the</b> <b>Court</b> <b>held</b> <b>that</b> it had jurisdiction to issue the writ in pre-conviction situations. In the next two cases, <b>the</b> <b>Court</b> <b>held</b> <b>that</b> it did not have jurisdiction to issue the writ in post-conviction cases.|$|E

First, <b>the</b> <b>Court</b> <b>held</b> <b>that</b> the state statute of incorporation of the insurance company required {{no more than the}} state's seal to be authenticated. Second, {{there was no need to}} prove the existence of the insurance company (i.e., that its stock had actually been subscribed) because it was not a party. Nor was it necessary to prove that the policy would have been binding against the insurance company. Nor did it matter whether the policy would have paid out under the circumstances of the fraud. Finally, it was held that an insurance corporation was a person within the meaning of the statute.|$|E

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>court</b> <b>held</b> further <b>that</b> <b>the</b> {{appellant}} {{had taken}} no steps whatsoever {{to see that}} the animal did not get out of its cage while he was engaged in repairing it.

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Court</b> thus <b>held</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> {{denial of}} {{benefits}} violate equal protection.|$|R
5|$|Not every {{question}} or every criminal case was {{eligible for a}} certificate of division. In United States v. Daniel (1821), <b>the</b> <b>Court</b> <b>held</b> <b>that</b> a motion for a new trialas authorized by the ยง 17 of the Judiciary Act of 1789could not {{be the subject of}} a certificate of division; rather, the division would operate a rejection of the motion. Similarly, in United States v. Bailey (1835), <b>the</b> <b>Court</b> <b>held</b> <b>that</b> {{the question of whether the}} evidence was legally sufficient to support the offense charged could not be certified. In United States v.

5|$|The Blockburger test, {{originally}} {{developed in the}} multiple punishments context, is also the test for prosecution after conviction. In Grady v.

Dixon (1993).|$|E
5|$|The Court {{wrote that}} {{consideration}} of age involved no {{consideration of the}} specific mindset of the individual. Rather, <b>the</b> <b>Court</b> <b>held</b> <b>that</b> age is an objective factor that affects how a reasonable person would perceive his or her freedom to leave.|$|E

5|$|Burton next {{argued that}} his {{prosecution}} violated the Double Jeopardy Clause.

The Court rejected this argument. <b>The</b> <b>Court</b> <b>held</b> <b>that</b> the earlier and later counts did not describe the same offense because they named the payor as Mahaney and Rialto, respectively.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Court</b> also <b>held</b> <b>that</b> only {{legislature}} should {{extend the}} scope of liability.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> {{district}} <b>court</b> <b>held</b> <b>that</b> LoopNet was {{not liable}} for direct copyright infringement based on Religious Technology Center v. Netcom.
