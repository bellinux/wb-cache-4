500|$|Marshall's wit is {{best remembered}} for a phrase he {{introduced}} to the American lexicon. While presiding over a Senate session in 1914, Marshall responded to earlier comments from Senator Joseph L. Bristow in which the senator provided {{a long list of}} what he felt the country needed. Marshall reportedly leaned over and muttered to one of his clerks, [...] "What <b>this</b> <b>country</b> <b>needs</b> is more of this; what <b>this</b> <b>country</b> <b>needs</b> is more of that" [...] and quipped loudly enough others to overhear, [...] "What <b>this</b> <b>country</b> <b>needs</b> is a really good five-cent cigar." [...] Marshall’s remark was popularized and widely circulated among a network of newspapers. Other accounts later embellished the story, including the exact situation that prompted his comment. In 1922 Marshall explained that the five-cent cigar was a metaphor for simpler times [...] and [...] "buckling down to thrift and work." ...|$|E
500|$|Well {{known for}} his wit and sense of humor, one of Marshall's most {{enduring}} jokes came during a Senate debate in which, in response to Senator Joseph Bristow's catalog of the nation's needs, Marshall quipped the often-repeated phrase, [...] "What <b>this</b> <b>country</b> <b>needs</b> {{is a really good}} five-cent cigar", provoking laughter. After his terms as vice president, he opened an Indianapolis law practice, where he authored several legal books and his memoir, Recollections. He continued to travel and speak publicly. Marshall died while on a trip after suffering a heart attack in 1925.|$|E
2500|$|Phelps viewed Arminianism (particularly {{the views}} of the Methodist theologian William Elbert Munsey) as a [...] "worse blasphemy and heresy than that heard in all filthy Saturday night fag bars in the {{aggregate}} in the world". In addition to John Calvin, Phelps admired Martin Luther and Bob Jones Sr., and approvingly quoted a statement by Jones that [...] "what <b>this</b> <b>country</b> <b>needs</b> is 50 Jonathan Edwardses turned loose in it." [...] Phelps particularly held to equal ultimacy, believing that [...] "God Almighty makes some willing and he leads others into sin", a view he said is Calvinist. However, many theologians would identify him as a Hyper-Calvinist ("hyper" [...] meaning [...] "beyond" [...] or [...] "above" [...] not [...] "extreme").|$|E

2500|$|In July 2007, Hagel was one {{of three}} Republican Senators who {{supported}} Democratic-proposed legislation requiring a troop withdrawal from Iraq to begin within 120 days. He told Robert D. Novak [...] "This thing is really coming undone quickly, and [...] Maliki's government is weaker by the day. The police are corrupt, top to bottom. The oil problem is a huge problem. They still can't get anything through the parliament—no hydrocarbon law, no de-Baathification law, no provincial elections." [...] In 2008, along with then-Senator (and presumptive Democratic nominee for president) Barack Obama, and Senator Jack Reed (D-RI), Hagel visited Iraq in a congressional delegation trip, meeting with U.S. service members, General David Petraeus, and the Prime Minister of Iraq Nouri al-Maliki.

2500|$|A banker by profession, Hungerford {{was well}} aware of the {{importance}} of maintaining the value of money as a medium of exchange. To him, the laborer and the capitalist were dependent on each other and needed to be confident in the monetary system, which rewarded each for his services and contributions. On February 21, 1878, he addressed the U.S. House of Representatives regarding a bill seeking to restore silver dollars as legal tender. In his speech, he called for a stable currency in which bank notes should only be redeemed for a set amount of gold or silver as determined at the international level. Overall, he favored a gold standard. That said, he informed the chamber as follows: [...] "What <b>this</b> <b>country</b> <b>needs</b> to-day is men in public as well as private station, who will not yield to every popular clamor but stand firmly and fearlessly for an honest currency be it silver, gold or paper, so that individual rights and national obligations may be preserved and maintained." ...|$|E

Proctor holds up a wad of cash, while Bergman holds a handful of cigars.

Manganese-bearing materials occur within the iron-rich strata of the Trommald Formation and the Rabbit Lake Formation. Computer-assisted resource estimates, based on exploration drill hole information, indicate that the Cuyuna range contains a minimum of 176 million metric tons (MMT) of marginally economic manganiferous rock with an average grade of 10. 46 weight percent manganese. The calculated 18. 5 MMT of manganese on the Cuyuna range could supply <b>this</b> <b>country's</b> <b>needs</b> for <b>this</b> important and strategic metal for nearly 14 years.

40|$|Forecasting is an {{essential}} analytical tool in tourism policy and planning. This paper focuses on forecasting methods based on ARFIMA(p,d,q) or fractionally integrated moving average(ARFIMA). The secondary data were used to produce forecasts of international tourist arrivals to Thailand for during period of 2009. From these period the results confirm that the best forecasting method based on ARFIMA(p,d,q) method is ARFIMA(0, 0. 443, 1). Furthermore these methods predict that international tourism arrivals to Thailand for during period of 2009 will be both down trend and constant trend. If these results can be generalized for future year, then it suggests that the both Thailand government sector and also the private tourism industry sector of <b>this</b> <b>country</b> <b>need</b> to both develop tourism market of Thailand more and develop tourism product in Thailand more too.

The French creole was also considered patois because it differed to the French or Paris. By the pass of time, the meaning of the term patois expanded even more. As an analogy to the French creole, the English creole was also called with patois.
