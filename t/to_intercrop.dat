The objective {{of the study was to}} evaluate the crop responses <b>to</b> <b>intercropping</b> maize with different growth length cowpea cultivars. The effects of intercropping on weed growth, maize and cowpea growth and yield components were investigated. The experiment was conducted during the 2005 / 06 and 2006 / 07 seasons at Bethlehem and Potchefstroom. Treatments were: maize sole, maize+PAN 311 (short duration cowpea cultivar), maize+Glenda (medium duration cowpea cultivar), maize+Agrinawa (long duration cowpea cultivar) and sole plots of all cowpea varieties. Each plot was divided into two weed levels where all the plots were kept weed free for one month after planting, after which one half was left weedy and the other half weed free. Weed sampling was done within each weed treatment. Intercropping reduced maize LAI and plant height while time to physiological maturity was also reduced by weed infestation, especially under drier and warmer environments. Glenda and Agrinawa intercrops produced more nodules per plant under cooler and wetter conditions. Agrinawa produced the highest leaf and total DMY under sole crop conditions and this was significantly reduced by weed infestation. Different growth duration cultivars did not differ in their N 2 -binding abilities. Maize intercropping, especially with Glenda and Agrinawa, significantly reduced weed biomass. Maize sole crop under zero weeds had high grain yield compared <b>to</b> <b>intercropping.</b> PAN 311 and Glenda sole crops under zero weeds produced higher yields under dry and warmer conditions, and cooler and wetter conditions, respectively, compared <b>to</b> <b>intercropping.</b> High cowpea grain yields were strongly correlated to more seeds per pod and larger pod lengths and number of pods per plant especially for Glenda. No <b>intercropping</b> advantage compared <b>to</b> sole cropping was observed (total LER < 1).

PREP-PAC contains of 2 kg of the reactive/biogenic locally available Minjingu (Tanzania) rock phosphate (PR), 0. 2 kg imported urea, 0. 13 kg seed of a N-fixing food legume, rhizobial inoculant (Biofix), seed adhesive (gum arabic), lime pellets and instruction sheet for use in English, Kiswahili and other local languages. The pack is assembled at US$ 0. 58 per unit and is intended to meliorate of 25 m. The product is particularly effective in acid (pH < 5. 5) and low P (10 mgP kg soils. In PREP-PAC testing in the field, several experiments were conducted form 1998 to date. The general principle is to apply slowly the available PR sufficient for several cropping seasons with readily available nitrogen fertilizer (urea) and <b>to</b> <b>intercrop</b> with a legume that provides residual fixed-nitrogen and organic inputs to the soil.

40|$|Abstract Diverse {{agricultural}} system such as intercrop is practised widely {{in developing countries}} and is gaining increasing interest for sustainable agriculture in developed countries. Plants in intercrops grow differently from plants in single crops, due to interspecific plant interactions and heterogeneous resource distribution, but adaptive plant morphological responses to competition in intercrops have not been studied in detail. This thesis aims to link the performance of an intercropping system with plasticity in plant traits. Grain yield of border-row wheat of an intercrop was 141 % higher than in sole wheat. The yield increase was mainly associated with plasticity in tillering and leaf sizes. Compared to maize in monoculture, maize in intercrops had lower leaf and collar appearance rates, larger blade and sheath sizes at low ranks and smaller ones at high ranks. The data suggest many of those changes are linked to each other through feedback mechanisms both at plant level and at phytomer level. A model of maize development was further developed based on three coordination rules between leaf emergence events and dynamics of organ extension. Flexible timing of organ development can emerge from the model {{as well as the}} distribution of leaf sizes over ranks. A wheat-maize architectural model was developed for quantifying the role of architectural trait plasticity in light capture in intercrop. Simulated light capture was 23 % higher in intercrop with plasticity in traits than the expected value weighted from the light capture in sole crops. Thirty-six percentage of the light increase was due <b>to</b> <b>intercrop</b> configuration alone and 64 % was due to plasticity. Overall, this thesis clearly shows the importance of plasticity in architectural traits for overyielding in wheat-maize intercropping and probably in diversified cropping systems in general. Thus it points to a previously under-appreciated mechanism driving the relationship between species diversity and overyielding of plant communities.  ...|$|E
40|$|Grain legume-cereal intercrops allow {{a gain of}} {{productivity}} grown along the growth cycle on the same piece of land under low input (of which nitrogen (N) fertilizers) levels. This {{is partly due to}} a better use of soil nitrogen (larger available soil N per plant for cereal N uptake and an increased contribution of N fixation for pea nutrition) under combinations (species and crop management systems) fully optimized within a given soil and climate environment. Modeling is a powerful tool to explore a wide range of combinations. It can be further used as a decision making oriented-tool provided below-ground resources and light sharing is satisfactorily simulated. Our work aimed at designing a new dynamic intercrop growth model (Azodyn Inter-Crop (IC)) based upon Azodyn for wheat and Afisol for pea. Nitrogen and water partitioning between species is firstly driven by nitrogen and water demand of each species. When intercrop demand is larger than soil supply then water and N acquisition is limited by root exploration, soil nutrient supply and N taken up by the companion species as it concurrently depletes available below-ground resources. The ‘functional’ root layer concept allows to account for advantage towards species with a faster root penetration rate. Leaf area expansion is driven by daily satisfaction of N demand, itself computed through an adapted version of N dilution curve <b>to</b> <b>intercrop</b> growth. Light sharing depends on leaf area index (LAI) growth and leaf properties (reflectance, leaf angle) of each species. Model outputs show Azodyn-IC can satisfactorily simulate N taken up, LAI, light interception efficiency and crop growth of each sole- and intercropped species along the growth cycle leading to realistic yields for the applied N fertilizer rates. It also emphasizes competition for light and below-ground resources within intercrops is tightly and dynamically linked within intercrop...|$|E

Crops were planted as pure stands and intercrops in three arrangements: A) alternating rows of a field crop and a medicinal plant, B) two rows of field crops and one row of medicinal plant, C) alternating double rows of field crops and medicinal plants. Results showed that land equivalent ratio was more than 1 in all treatment indicating seed yield of the plants were higher in pure stands compared <b>to</b> <b>intercrops</b> but the advantages of the <b>intercropping</b> compared <b>to</b> sole cropping.

40|$|The use {{of winter}} legumes in {{southern}} Brazil is hindered by the slow growth {{of these species}} during establishment exposing soil surface to erosion. Introduction of these species along with spring wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) was studied {{as a means of}} increasing ground cover during their initial establishment period, without reducing wheat grain yield. Two experiments were conducted in nearby areas, one in each year. Birdsfoot trefoil (Lotus corniculatus L.), red clover (Trifolium pratense L.) cultivar Quiñequelli, white clover (T. repens L.), and arrowleaf clover (T. vesiculosum Savi) did not reduce cereal yield in either year. Wheat yield was reduced by intercropped red clover cultivar Kenland and by subclover (T. subterraneum L.) in the first year. No grain yield differences due <b>to</b> <b>intercropping</b> with any legume were detected in the second year, when rainfall was below normal. Intercropping with wheat showed to be a practical alternative to enhance ground cover at establishing forage legumes. 200...|$|R
