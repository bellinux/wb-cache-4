5|$|Despite {{the dangers}} from <b>the</b> <b>intense</b> hurricane, {{evacuations}} in Bluefields {{were met with}} resistance and disbelief from residents. In Managua, 70,000 people were evacuated to safe areas. In the remaining areas of Nicaragua, 300,000 people were evacuated. In Costa Rica, a total of 55,000 people were evacuated.|$|E
5|$|Morocco had {{a similar}} effect on Rix as it did on many artists who visited. Paintings were created in high-keyed colours that {{captured}} <b>the</b> <b>intense</b> north African light, and most works focussed on the figures, dress and activity of the people, or the local architecture.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>intense</b> {{nature of}} National Gallery of Scotland's Olive Trees (F714) likely expresses Van Gogh's {{agitated}} {{state of mind}} when he completed this work, dramatic impact evidenced both through his brushstrokes and color use.|$|E

5|$|A tornado is not {{necessarily}} visible; however, <b>the</b> <b>intense</b> low pressure caused by the high wind speeds (as described by Bernoulli's principle) and rapid rotation (due to cyclostrophic balance) usually cause water vapor {{in the air to}} condense into cloud droplets due to adiabatic cooling. This results in the formation of a visible funnel cloud or condensation funnel.|$|E
5|$|At 16:29, the Japanese dive bombers {{began their}} attacks. Although several {{attempted}} {{to set up}} to attack the Saratoga, they quickly shifted back to the nearer carrier, Enterprise. Thus, Enterprise {{was the target of}} almost the entire Japanese air attack. Several Wildcats followed the Vals into their attack dives, despite <b>the</b> <b>intense</b> anti-aircraft artillery fire from Enterprise and her screening warships, {{in a desperate attempt to}} disrupt their attacks. As many as four Wildcats were shot down by U.S. anti-aircraft fire, as well as several Vals.|$|E
5|$|At {{the same}} time that the {{landings}} on Tulagi and Gavutu–Tanambogo were taking place, Allied troops were also landing on nearby Guadalcanal, with the objective of capturing an airfield under construction by Japanese forces. In contrast to <b>the</b> <b>intense</b> fighting on Tulagi and Gavutu, the landings on Guadalcanal were essentially unopposed. The landings on both Tulagi and Guadalcanal initiated the six-month-long Guadalcanal campaign and a series of combined-arms battles between Allied and Japanese forces in the Solomon Islands area.|$|E

5|$|Callisto is {{surrounded}} by an extremely thin atmosphere composed {{of carbon dioxide and}} probably molecular oxygen. Investigation revealed that Callisto may possibly have a subsurface ocean of liquid water at depths less than 300 kilometres. The likely presence of an ocean within Callisto indicates that it can or could harbour life. However, this is less likely than on nearby Europa. Callisto has long been considered the most suitable place for a human base for future exploration of the Jupiter system since it is furthest from <b>the</b> <b>intense</b> radiation of Jupiter.|$|E
5|$|Carbon is {{the fourth}} most {{abundant}} chemical element in the universe by mass after hydrogen, helium, and oxygen. Carbon is abundant in the Sun, stars, comets, and in the atmospheres of most planets. Some meteorites contain microscopic diamonds that were formed when the solar system was still a protoplanetary disk. Microscopic diamonds may also be formed by <b>the</b> <b>intense</b> pressure and high temperature at the sites of meteorite impacts.|$|E
5|$|General {{relativity}} {{has developed}} into an essential tool in modern astrophysics. It provides {{the foundation for}} the current understanding of black holes, regions of space where the gravitational effect is so strong that even light cannot escape. Their strong gravity is thought to be responsible for <b>the</b> <b>intense</b> radiation emitted by certain types of astronomical objects (such as active galactic nuclei or microquasars). General relativity is also part of the framework of the standard Big Bang model of cosmology.|$|E

30|$|Atomap {{implements}} {{a version}} of this by removing <b>the</b> most <b>intense</b> sublattice before fitting <b>the</b> less <b>intense</b> sublattices. This is equivalent to having a model where <b>the</b> most <b>intense</b> atomic columns are fitted first, then locked, and afterwards fitting <b>the</b> second most <b>intense</b> atomic columns. Fitting 2 D Gaussians to all atomic columns in a data set simultaneously will be experimented with in Atomap in the near future, using the aforementioned process to find reasonable initial values first.|$|R
5|$|In Week 2, the Terrapins {{played the}} inaugural {{game at the}} newly {{completed}} Byrd Stadium. It was the first game against the Naval Academy in 16 years. The series had been canceled in 1934 after Maryland accused Navy of an illegal game-winning play. In 1950, Maryland agreed to fill a vacancy in the Navy schedule left open by a Georgetown cancellation. The high-scoring game was the 12th meeting of <b>the</b> <b>intense</b> in-state rivalry and resulted in just the second-ever Maryland win.|$|E
5|$|In {{contrast}} to <b>the</b> <b>intense</b> single character {{focus of his}} first novel, ¡Ecue-Yamba-O! (Praised Be the Lord!), Carpentier offers a diversified understanding of black society and its beliefs in The Kingdom of This World. There exists remarkable respect for accuracy on all sides including historical facts, character names, place names, and even street names. This adds to the key blend of marvellous fantasy and historical accuracy.|$|E
5|$|In the 1960s, a Grand Tour {{to study}} the outer planets was {{proposed}} which prompted NASA to begin work on a mission in the early 1970s. Information gathered by the Pioneer 10 spacecraft helped Voyagers engineers design Voyager to cope more effectively with <b>the</b> <b>intense</b> radiation environment around Jupiter.|$|E

5|$|Jackson {{also stated}} during the 1993 {{interview}} that he first began taking painkiller medications regularly in 1984. On January 24 of that year, Jackson was filming a Pepsi commercial when his hair caught on fire from faulty pyrotechnics on stage that were intended {{to be part of}} one of many being filmed. He sustained second-degree burns to his scalp and never fully recovered from the injury or from the lingering pain. He reportedly began taking the painkillers after refusing at first {{in order to deal with}} <b>the</b> <b>intense</b> pain.|$|E
5|$|Looking {{directly}} at the photosphere of the Sun (the bright disk of the Sun itself), even {{for just a few}} seconds, can cause permanent damage to the retina of the eye, because of <b>the</b> <b>intense</b> visible and invisible radiation that the photosphere emits. This damage can result in impairment of vision, up to and including blindness. The retina has no sensitivity to pain, and the effects of retinal damage may not appear for hours, so there is no warning that injury is occurring.|$|E
5|$|New York's 1988 season {{got off to}} a {{turbulent}} start due an offseason scandal involving Taylor. Taylor had abused cocaine, violating the NFL's substance abuse policy and was suspended for the first four games of the season. Taylor's over-the-edge lifestyle was becoming an increasing concern for fans and team officials. After his return, however, Taylor recorded 15.5 sacks in 12 games. <b>The</b> <b>intense</b> worry and scrutiny would prove to be for naught as {{for the rest of his}} career Taylor would pass his drug tests.|$|E

In 2014, Hurricane Odile beat both storms when it attained a minimum pressure of 918 mbars. Olivia was also <b>the</b> most <b>intense</b> September hurricane. Since, Hurricane Linda beat Olivia. Olivia remains <b>the</b> third most <b>intense</b> September hurricane.|$|R
5|$|Nine {{years after}} the 1917 Russian Revolution, Du Bois {{extended}} a trip to Europe to include {{a visit to the}} Soviet Union. Du Bois was struck by the poverty and disorganization he encountered in the Soviet Union, yet was impressed by <b>the</b> <b>intense</b> labors of the officials and by the recognition given to workers. Although Du Bois was not yet familiar with the communist theories of Karl Marx or Vladimir Lenin, he concluded that socialism may be a better path towards racial equality than capitalism.|$|E
5|$|On 4 July, Overton was on {{a mission}} near Sakchu, leading a group of 37 F-84s on an attack mission against the North Korean Military Academy when they were {{attacked}} by almost 200 MiG-15s in the largest engagement of the war. In spite of <b>the</b> <b>intense</b> fire, Overton's group took no losses, {{and the results of}} the engagement, as well as Overton's heroism were cause for subsequent decoration. With this unit, Overton flew 102 combat missions {{over the course of a}} 6-month tour. It concluded in August 1952.|$|E
5|$|Principal {{photography}} {{began on}} July 9, 1979, {{with a budget}} of $8.5 million. Parker described shooting in New York City as a less than pleasurable experience due to <b>the</b> <b>intense</b> summer weather conditions. He also faced difficulties with U.S. labor union representatives who disapproved of the British crew members working on the film without permits. In order to gain work permits, Parker made {{an agreement with the}} unions that allowed local laborers to work on the film.|$|E
