40|$|The {{presence}} of the heat stress response-related ATPases ClpC and ClpX or the peptidase ClpP in the cell is crucial for <b>tolerance</b> <b>of</b> many <b>forms</b> <b>of</b> stress in Bacillus subtilis. Assays for detection of defects in protein degradation suggest that ClpC, ClpP, and ClpX participate directly in overall proteolysis of misfolded proteins. Turnover rates for abnormal puromycyl peptides are significantly decreased in clpC, clpP, and clpX mutant cells. Electron-dense aggregates, most likely due to the accumulation of misfolded proteins, were noticed in studies of ultrathin cryosections in clpC and clpP mutant cells even under nonstress conditions. In contrast, in the wild type or clpX mutants such aggregates could only be observed after heat shock. This phenomenon supports the assumption that clpC and clpP mutants are deficient {{in the ability to}} solubilize or degrade damaged and aggregated proteins, the accumulation of which is toxic for the cell. By using immunogold labeling with antibodies raised against ClpC, ClpP, and ClpX, the Clp proteins were localized in these aggregates, showing that the Clp proteins act at this level in vivo...|$|R

I found that (1) no pasture or plantation had more than 5 % of the possible significant positive associations, (2) clustering metrics showed groups of species participating in similar clusters among the five pasture/plantations over a gradient of decreasing association strength, and (3) there was evidence for repeatable communities—especially after banana cultivation—suggesting that past crops not only persist after abandonment but also form significant associations with invading plants. I then showed how the clustering hierarchy {{could be used to}} decide if any two pasture/plantation plots were in the same community, that is, to define old field communities.

Political campaigns, such as those to confront <b>tolerance</b> <b>of</b> myriad <b>forms</b> <b>of</b> violence against women, {{have been successful in}} forcing the position of women on to the international stage. These battles were hard fought and fraught with tensions but nonetheless the ‘culturally sensitive’ universalism (Engle 2005) that emerged laid the cornerstones for creative use of rights by women’s activist groups throughout the world.

40|$|Biofilms are {{composed}} of surface-attachedmicrobial communities. A hallmark of biofilms is their profound <b>tolerance</b> <b>of</b> antimi-crobial agents. While biofilm drug tolerance has been considered to be multifactorial, our findings indicate, instead, that bacte-ria within biofilms employ a classical regulatory mechanism to resist the action of antimicrobial agents. Here we report that the transcriptional regulator BrlR, {{a member of the}} MerR family of multidrug transport activators, plays a role in the high-level drug <b>tolerance</b> <b>of</b> biofilms <b>formed</b> by Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Expression of brlRwas found to be biofilm specific, with brlR inactiva-tion not affecting biofilm formation, motility, or pslA expression but increasing ndvB expression. Inactivation of brlR rendered biofilms but not planktonic cells grown to exponential or stationary phase significantly more susceptible to hydrogen peroxide and five different classes of antibiotics by affecting theMICs and the recalcitrance of biofilms to killing by microbicidal antimi-crobial agents. In contrast, overexpression of brlR rendered both biofilms and planktonic cells more tolerant to the same com-pounds. brlR expression in three cystic fibrosis (CF) isolates was elevated regardless of the mode of growth, suggesting a selection for constitutive brlR expression upon in vivo biofilm formation associated with chronic infections. Despite increased brlR ex-pression, however, isolate CF 1 - 8 was as susceptible to tobramycin as was abrlRmutant because of a nonsense mutation in brlR. Our results indicate {{for the first time that}} biofilms employ a specific regulatory mechanism to resist the action of antimi-crobial agents in a BrlR-dependent manner which affects MIC and recalcitrance to killing by microbicidal antimicrobial agents.

40|$|Recent {{developments}} in design algorithm allow the calculation <b>of</b> free <b>form</b> surfaces that generate {{a picture in}} the target plane {{with the help of}} one optical surface. In contrast to conventional imaging, light modulation is done by a ray-optical redistribution of the incident light which is comparable to incoherent beam shaping. Such picture-generating surfaces normally exhibit very complex surface sags, that are manufactured using diamond turning machining. The knowledge <b>of</b> manufacturing <b>tolerances</b> is important to generate the desired intensity distribution with the required accuracy {{and at the same time}} reduce manufacturing effort. However, compared to the <b>tolerancing</b> <b>of</b> conventional optical elements (e. g. spheres), the <b>tolerancing</b> <b>of</b> picture-generating free <b>form</b> optical elements is a demanding task. The complexity of their surface shapes and the target intensity distribution are challenging considering the finding <b>of</b> <b>tolerance</b> parameters and performance criteria. Tolerance parameters strongly depend on the manufacturing process. Therefore they can be obtained by a detailed analysis of their manufacturing process. In this contribution we focused on picture-generating free form optical elements manufactured using diamond turning with slow tool servo support. Astigmatism and spherical aberration are typical manufacturing errors caused by this tool exhibiting low spatial frequency. Errors with middle to high spatial frequency have not been investigated so far. Conventional software tools for tolerancing, as e. g. implemented in Zemax, provide only such tolerance parameters as radius, thickness or tilt, corresponding to conventional manufacturing methods of classical optical elements (e. g. spheres). Therefore we implemented a software tool developed in Matlab and using Zemax for raytracing in order to perform sensitivity analysis and Monte Carlo analysis. Conventional performance criteria like spot radius or wavefront error to evaluate the tolerance analysis cannot be applied for picture-generating free from elements. Consequently, other performance criteria were investigated. The correlation between the desired and the generated intensity distribution was chosen to be an appropriate performance criterion for the tolerancing analysis...|$|R

40|$|Background: Physicians’ <b>tolerance</b> <b>of</b> {{uncertainty}} (TU) is a trait potentially {{associated with}} desirable outcomes, and emerging evidence suggests it may change over time. Past studies of TU, however, have been cross-sectional {{and have not}} measured <b>tolerance</b> <b>of</b> the different, specific types of uncertainty that physicians confront. We addressed these limitations in a longitudinal exploratory study of medical students. Methods: At the end of medical school (Doctor of Medicine degree) Years 1 and 4, a cohort of 26 students at a US medical school completed measures assessing <b>tolerance</b> <b>of</b> different types of uncertainty: 1) complexity (uncertainty arising from features of information that {{make it difficult to}} comprehend); 2) risk (uncertainty arising from the indeterminacy of future outcomes); and 3) ambiguity (uncertainty arising from limitations in the reliability, credibility, or adequacy of information).
