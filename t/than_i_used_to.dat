500|$|Following {{a three-year}} {{absence from the}} big screen, Gosling starred in five movies in 2010 and 2011. [...] "I’ve never had more energy,” Gosling has said. “I’m more excited to make films <b>than</b> <b>I</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> be. I used to kind of dread it. It was so {{emotional}} and taxing. But I’ve {{found a way to}} have fun while doing it. And I think that translates into the films.” He has also spoken of feeling depressed when not working.|$|E

2500|$|In November 2011, a judge granted McGraw {{permission}} to record music for another label, ending {{his relationship with}} Curb Records that began in 1990. A few hours after the ruling, Curb released [...] "Better <b>Than</b> <b>I</b> <b>Used</b> <b>to</b> Be", the second single from [...] Emotional Traffic. The album was released on January 24, 2012.|$|E
60|$|The parrot sat, {{preening}} her plumage, on Long John's shoulder. He himself, I thought, looked somewhat paler {{and more}} stern <b>than</b> <b>I</b> was <b>used</b> <b>to.</b> He still wore the fine broadcloth suit {{in which he}} had fulfilled his mission, but it was bitterly the worse for wear, daubed with clay and torn with the sharp briers of the wood.|$|R
5000|$|Beecher first {{worked with}} the Comets in fall 1954 as a session musician, {{replacing}} the recently deceased guitarist Danny Cedrone. Beecher's first work with Haley was the single [...] "Dim, Dim the Lights". Beecher had to be instructed to make his guitar solos less jazzy. [...] "They wanted to play a more basic style <b>than</b> <b>I</b> was <b>used</b> <b>to,</b> more country really, they called it rockabilly." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "He is like my brother," [...] Honora explained, {{aware that}} Howard {{was looking at}} her. [...] "Only he is much older <b>than</b> <b>I.</b> He <b>used</b> <b>to</b> wheel {{me up and down}} when I was a baby. He was, an errand boy in the bank then, and Uncle Tom took an {{interest}} in him, and now he is a lawyer. A very good one, I believe." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You're right, Fred. D'you know, {{it strikes}} me that I'm a far more selfish and despicable brute <b>than</b> <b>I</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> think myself." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I feel so {{much more}} solitary and {{helpless}} without Lizzie now, <b>than</b> <b>I</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> feel before I knew her.' (Tears were in {{her eyes as she}} said so.) ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Same old story, Daren, {{same old}} way, {{a game of}} billiards now and then, and a little game of cards. But I'm more lonely <b>than</b> <b>I</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> be." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We {{must take}} fortune as it offers. But the most {{wonderful}} sight of the day, after all, though Luigi and his fellows did so well, was to see a poor fisherman, named Antonio, in his bare head and naked legs, a man of seventy years, and with a boat no better <b>than</b> that <b>I</b> <b>use</b> <b>to</b> carry liquors to the Lido, entering on the second race, and carrying off the prize!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Indeed I have, and it {{is because}} I have sought it and {{obtained}} it," [...] said Tom, earnestly, [...] "that I am anxious {{to point out the}} way to you. I've come through much the same experiences, no doubt, as you have. I have been a scouter of my mother's teachings, a thief, and, in heart if not in act, a murderer. No one could be more urgently in need of salvation from sin <b>than</b> <b>I,</b> and <b>I</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> think that <b>I</b> was so bad that my case was hopeless, until God opened my eyes to see that Jesus came to save His people from their sins. That is what you need, is it not?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Rather so,' said John, smiling; 'but it {{has done}} him {{a great deal of}} good. He has more heart in him <b>than</b> you and <b>I</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> think; and home is drawing it out, and making a man of him in spite of himself.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Ay, ay!" [...] {{said the}} doctor, [...] "there's {{much more in}} the boy <b>than</b> <b>I</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> think. He's a capital fellow, and more like his mother than any of them." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'It's a {{complaint}} {{we are all}} liable to, Little One, as we get on in life,' said my aunt, cheerfully; 'I don't feel more free from it <b>than</b> <b>I</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> be, I assure you.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Maybe. He surely has strange {{passion for}} horses. I think I {{understand}} better <b>than</b> <b>I</b> <b>used</b> <b>to.</b> I owned {{a couple of}} racers once. They were just animals to me, I guess. But Blanco Sol!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I'm sure I don't wish to! ... Ah--they {{are making}} {{for the art}} department. I should {{like to see some}} {{pictures}} myself. Suppose we go that way?-- Why, if all Wessex isn't here, I verily believe! There's Dr. Vilbert. Haven't seen him for years, and he's not looking a day older <b>than</b> when <b>I</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> know him. How do you do, Physician? I was just saying that you don't look a day older than when you knew me as a girl." ...|$|R
60|$|The pomp of this pew and the aristocratical air of {{the family}} struck My {{imagination}} wonderfully, and I fell desperately {{in love with a}} little daughter of the squire's about twelve years of age. This freak of fancy made me more truant from my studies <b>than</b> ever. <b>I</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> stroll about the squire's park, and would lurk near the house to catch glimpses of this little damsel at the windows, or playing about the lawns, or walking out with her governess.|$|R
6000|$|... "There {{are as good}} fish in the sea as {{ever were}} caught. Tom Daly is a {{first-class}} man, I admit; {{and he had no}} more obedient slave <b>than</b> myself when <b>I</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> get out hunting two or three days in the session. But he is a desponding man, and cannot look forward to better times. For myself, I own that my hopes are fixed. Hang Lax, and then the millennium!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{only want}} to say that I should hate any one who bought Pardons ten times worse <b>than</b> <b>I</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> hate the second Mrs. Chapin. Think what we've put into it of our two selves." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That's all. That is, if you {{and father}} are agreed." [...] He {{reflected}} upon this provision, and added, with a laugh of confusion and pleasure: [...] "It seems to be so very {{much more of a}} family affair <b>than</b> <b>I</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> think it was." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The fact is, my dear Belmont--I'm {{sure you}} would not let it go further--above all not to the ladies; but I am rather older <b>than</b> <b>I</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> be, and rather than lose the {{military}} carriage which has always been dear to me, I--" ...|$|E
6000|$|I {{have said}} I {{was not allowed}} to shoot before the age of ten, but the desire had come long before that; I was no more <b>than</b> seven when <b>I</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> wish to be a big, or at all events a bigger, boy, so that, like my brother, I too might carry a gun and shoot big wild birds. But he said [...] "No" [...] very emphatically, and there was an end of it.|$|R
6000|$|... "It is {{the first}} time that I have ever gone up the mast of a man-of-war," [...] Edgar replied; [...] "but {{everything}} is so big and solid here, that it seems easy after being accustomed to smaller craft. It is a wonderful spread of sail, Wilkinson, after having been on board nothing bigger <b>than</b> a brig. <b>I</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> help reef the sails on my way back from England; but these tremendous sails seem altogether too big to handle." ...|$|R
5000|$|Schoen {{was also}} {{extremely}} {{impressed with the}} sound of the Basie band, [...] "There was quite a large difference {{in the way that the}} white bands played versus the black bands. When I would show up to Basie's rehearsals to hear my arrangements sometimes I didn't even realize they were playing one of my charts. The unique way they played and phrased was so different <b>than</b> what <b>I</b> was <b>used</b> <b>to</b> hearing." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, dearest, it {{will give}} you a great deal of trouble, but you never mind that, you know; and I am so much {{stronger}} <b>than</b> <b>I</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> be, that you need not fear. Besides, I want help so much! And it is the day Colin goes away!" ...|$|E
6000|$|Fading is {{the taper}} waist-- [...] Shapeless grows the shapely limb, [...] And {{although}} securely laced, [...] Spreading is the figure trim! [...] Stouter <b>than</b> <b>I</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> be, [...] Still more corpulent grow I-- [...] There {{will be too}} much of me [...] In the coming bye and bye! ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'It is all I CAN give you,' said my aunt. 'You know I {{have had}} losses, and am poorer <b>than</b> <b>I</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> be. I {{have told you}} so. Having got it, why do {{you give me the}} pain of looking at you for another moment, and seeing what you have become?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You're thicker <b>than</b> when <b>I</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> know you, then," [...] he {{returned}} with candor. [...] "To tell the truth, Crocker, I often wish I were back at the law, and had never written a line. I am paying the penalty of fame. Wherever I go I am hounded to death {{by the people who}} have read my books, and they want to dine and wine me for the sake of showing me off at their houses. I am heartily sick and tired of it all; you would be if you had to go through it. I could stand a winter, but the worst comes in the summer, when one meets the women who fire all sorts of socio-psychological questions at one for solution, and who have suggestions for stories." [...] He shuddered.|$|R
6000|$|... "Very well," [...] said Gwendolen, {{arranging}} her hat fastidiously, [...] "then {{you will}} please {{to consider that}} you are half happy, which is more <b>than</b> <b>I</b> am <b>used</b> <b>to</b> seeing you." [...] With the last words she again turned with her old playful smile to her mother. [...] "Now I am ready; but oh, mamma, Mr. Grandcourt gives me a quantity of money, and expects me to spend it, and I can't spend it; and you know I can't bear charity children and all that; and here are thirty pounds. I wish the girls would spend it for me on little things for themselves {{when you go to}} the new house. Tell them so." [...] Gwendolen put the notes into her mother's hands and looked away hastily, moving toward the door.|$|R
60|$|How {{thoughtful}} {{a little}} adversity makes one. As I came {{in sight of}} the school-house where I had so often been flogged {{in the cause of}} wisdom, you would hardly have recognized the truant boy who but a few years since had eloped so heedlessly from its walls. I leaned over the paling of the playground, and watched the scholars at their games, and looked to see if there might not be some urchin among them, like I was once, full of gay dreams about life and the world. The play-ground seemed smaller <b>than</b> when <b>I</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> sport about it. The house and park, too, of the neighboring squire, the father of the cruel Sacharissa, had shrunk in size and diminished in magnificence. The distant hills no longer appeared so far off, and, alas! no longer awakened ideas of a fairy land beyond.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Yes; I {{see it now}} I am with Aunt Melicent. You put so {{many more}} {{thoughts}} in my head, and showed me that so much more was good and wholesome <b>than</b> <b>I</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> fancy. Dear mamma once said you were educating me; and I hope to go on, and not let your lessons waste away.' ...|$|E
6000|$|Hollow is the {{laughter}} free, Spectacled the limpid eye, Little {{will be left}} of me, In the coming by-and-by! Fading is the taper waist - Shapeless grows the shapely limb, And although securely laced, Spreading is the figure trim! Stouter <b>than</b> <b>I</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> be, Still more corpulent grow I - There will {{be too much of}} me In the coming by-and-by! ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I say,' {{he began}} hurriedly, 'do {{you mind if}} I come {{in here for a}} little? I'm a bit edgy.' I must have shown surprise. 'I'm ever so much better about liquor <b>than</b> <b>I</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> be, but--it's the whisky in the {{suitcase}} that throws me. For God's sake, old man, don't go back on me to-night! Look at my hands!' ...|$|E
60|$|But now {{considering}} that I had two mouths to feed instead of one, {{it was necessary}} that I must provide more ground for my harvest, and plant a larger quantity of corn <b>than</b> <b>I</b> commonly <b>used</b> <b>to</b> do; upon which I marked out a larger piece of land, fencing it in, {{in the same manner}} as I had done before; in the execution of which I must give Friday this good word; that no man could work, more hardy or with better will than he did: and when I made him sensible that it was for bread to serve him as well as me, he then very passionately made me understand that he thought I had much more labour on his account, <b>than</b> <b>I</b> had for myself; and that no pains or diligence should be wanting in him, if I would but direct him in those works wherein he might proceed.|$|R
5000|$|Concerning {{the manner}} in which Ella {{regularly}} received the ball from his scrum-half; Ella gave no quarter to the speed at which the ball was delivered to him, regardless of how close he stood, trusting in his ability to safely hold the ball. Ella writes: “Once you have positioned yourself, the next thing is to demand a fast pass from the halfback. The quicker the ball reaches you the better, for every fraction of a second is important to the five-eighth, given that the opposition can be on top of him in less <b>than</b> two seconds. <b>I</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> insist on having the ball passed to me like a rocket." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You know, dear," [...] said Mrs. Van Astrachan to Rose, [...] "that I {{never like}} to stay long away from papa" [...] (so the worthy lady called her husband); [...] "and so, if it's just the same to you, you shall let me have the {{carriage}} come for me early, and then you and Harry shall be left free to see it out. I know young folks must be young," [...] she said, with a comfortable laugh. [...] "There was a time, dear, when my waist was not bigger <b>than</b> yours, that <b>I</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> dance all night {{with the best of}} them; but I've got bravely over that now." ...|$|R
