5|$|Aksel Winther, Bent and Jørgen's handler, {{signals to}} them to kill Elisabeth Lorentzen, Horst Gilbert, and Hermann Seibold–members of the Abwehr, the German {{military}} intelligence service. Bent and Jørgen argue over it as they kill only Danes, to reduce the chance of retaliation by the Nazis. However, Winther claims orders from the government in exile in London. Bent kills Lorentzen but fails to kill Gilbert and Seibold. Later, Jørgen, his wife, Bodil, and their daughter, Ann, celebrate the girl's birthday on their car as they are without money, and Bodil laments over their relationship. Three weeks later, Bent, Jørgen and Whinter meet Spex from the Danish Army Intelligence. He says <b>there</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>no</b> <b>more</b> attacks, as they need peace to assemble men for a big attack. The three agree {{that they should not}} follow Spex's order, and later Jørgen kills Gilbert. That night, Jørgen robs a grocery store and takes the products to his wife and daughter; however, Bodil announces she is seeing another man.|$|E

25|$|Forty-one Discworld novels {{have been}} published. After Pratchett was {{diagnosed}} with Alzheimer's disease, {{he said that he}} would be happy for his daughter Rhianna to continue the series when he could no longer do so. However, Rhianna has stated she will only be involved in spin-offs, adaptations and tie-ins, and that <b>there</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>no</b> <b>more</b> novels. The original British editions of the first 26 novels, up to Thief of Time (2001), had distinctive cover art by Josh Kirby. The American editions, published by Harper Collins, used their own cover art. Since Kirby's death in October 2001, the covers have been designed by Paul Kidby. Companion publications include eleven short stories (some only loosely related to the Discworld), four popular science books, and a number of supplementary books and reference guides. In addition, the series has been adapted for graphic novels, theatre, computer and board games, and television.|$|E

25|$|Interbreeding {{with other}} {{domestic}} dogs {{is regarded as}} the greatest threat to the survival of the “pure” dingo. Genetic analyses, observations and skull measurements {{over the course of several}} years strongly indicate that in approximately 50 years the “pure” dingo will have disappeared in the wilderness of the continent and that it is no longer possible to preserve them there. The dingo researcher Laurie Corbett considers that, given the current rate of interbreeding, <b>there</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>no</b> <b>more</b> “pure” dingoes in the wilderness of Victoria in 20 years. The president of the Dingo Conservation Association Barry Oakman was in an interview in the year 2003 of the opinion that without appropriate measures the “pure” dingo would be extinct in the wild in 30 years, in New South Wales possibly in less than 10 years. According to other statements the “pure” dingoes are either close to extinction or they will be close to it over the course of the next 20 years. It is assumed that, should the process go on unhindered, the increasing number of genes from other domestic dogs will effectively lead to the extinction on the Australian continent of the dingo as a separate subspecies by 2100 and that the dog population will then consist of hybrids and other feral dogs.|$|E
25|$|Poirot {{travels with}} Diana {{to the family}} seat of Lyde Manor where he meets the people involved. Hugh strikes Poirot as a fine young bull of a man. He learns further details {{of the history of}} {{insanity}} in the family from Colonel Frobisher, including Hugh's grandfather who was committed to an asylum. Poirot learns that Hugh's mother died when he was ten years old in a boating accident when she was out with the Admiral, and that she was previously engaged to Frobisher before he went off to India with the British Army. When he came home he learned she had married Admiral Chandler, however this incident did nothing to lessen the ties of friendship between the two men. Poirot forces Frobisher to tell him more details of the incident with the sheep and finds out that on the night concerned, the Admiral found his son in bed with blood on his clothes and blood in the washbasin but Hugh remembered nothing of what he had done. Poirot questions the Admiral who has aged immensely since these incidents started and who feels that breaking the engagement is best for everyone, remarking that <b>there</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>no</b> <b>more</b> Chandlers at Lyde Manor after he and his son have died.|$|E
25|$|On February 1, 2006, Liberty Corporation {{merged with}} Raycom Media. In November 2006, WFIE added The Tube (a 24-hour music video channel {{similar to the}} early years of MTV) on digital channel 14.3 along with many other Raycom Media stations. In summer 2007, The Tube shut down from the lack of {{advertiser}} support and this station ceased programming on 14.3 for the time. WFIE, along with many Raycom Media stations, added This TV to 14.3 on February 4, 2009. On November 1, 2013, This TV ceased programming on 14.3 after Tribune Broadcasting bought out Weigel Broadcasting's ownership of the network. WFIE, along with some other stations, added Movies! to 14.3 on November 1, 2013. WFIE replaced its Movies! affiliation on 14.3 that same day with MeTV, to have it kept in the area. On October 28, 2014 at 12:00 noon, 14Xtra was replaced with the MeTV affiliation from the 14.3 subchannel. At the same time, MeTV from 14.3 was replaced with a free-to-air movie network called Grit, meaning that <b>there</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>no</b> <b>more</b> weather channels that are on broadcast TV in the area. Secondary affiliations on 14.2 are college basketball on early Saturday afternoons from the ACC Network (which is owned by Raycom Media) for its airings at that time, which was the same since the change.|$|E

500|$|Qin Hui, an {{official}} of the Song court, recommended a peaceful solution to the conflict in 1130, saying that, [...] "If it is desirable that <b>there</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>no</b> <b>more</b> conflicts under Heaven, it is necessary for the southerners to stay in the south and the northerners in the north." [...] Gaozong, who considered himself a northerner, initially rejected the proposal. There were gestures toward peace in 1132, when the Jin freed an imprisoned Song diplomat, and in 1133, when the Song offered to become a Jin vassal, but a treaty never materialized. The Jin requirement that the border between the two states be moved south from the Huai River to the Yangtze was too large of a hurdle for the two sides to reach an agreement.|$|E
500|$|Nevertheless, in the Great Catechism, Gregory {{suggests}} that while every human will be resurrected, salvation {{will only be}} accorded to the baptised, although he also states that others driven by their passions can be saved after being purified by fire. While he believes that <b>there</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>no</b> <b>more</b> evil in the hereafter, it is arguable that this does not preclude a belief that God might justly damn sinners for eternity. Thus, {{the main difference between}} Gregory's conception of ἀποκατάστασις and that of Origen would be that Gregory believes that mankind will be collectively returned to sinlessness, whereas Origen believes that personal salvation will be universal. This interpretation of Gregory has been criticized recently, however. Indeed, this interpretation is explicitly contradicted in the [...] "Great Catechism" [...] itself, for at the end of chapter XXXV Gregory declares that those who have not been purified by water through baptism will be purified by fire in the end, so that [...] "their nature may be restored pure again to God". Furthermore, in the next chapter (ch. XXXVI), Gregory says that those who are purified from evil will be admitted into the [...] "heavenly company".|$|E
500|$|Most of {{the lyrics}} were written by Manson as she {{included}} and filtered some of her bandmates' ideas on songwriting. [...] "It was a very do-it-yourself, homemade thing {{when it comes down}} to it", Erikson explained; [...] "We all pitch in. Shirley had just as many comments on the guitar parts or the sound of the guitars as anybody else, and likewise, if we don't like a lyric, we say it right away." [...] Many songs have a more optimistic view in life, inspired by Manson overcoming a desire to quit music after the death of her mother and realizing how important her work is to her. Darker themes still appear as Manson described herself as [...] "enthusiastic and passionate, but I do see death marching toward me." [...] "Blood for Poppies" [...] came [...] "from a lot of things", Manson said; [...] "It's really an analogy for a story I read about Afghanistan and the opium wars over there ... it's from a few stories, one about a platoon of soldiers in Afghanistan and the other about the opium wars. I use that as a backdrop for a story about maintaining sanity in an out-of-control place." [...] " [...] remaining sane, when faced with insanity", she added. [...] "I Hate Love" [...] criticized [...] "the commercialized idea of love and what pain that puts us through" [...] along with [...] "knowing that <b>there</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>no</b> <b>more</b> torture in your life than really, truly loving somebody who doesn't love you back." [...] Manson also incorporated some self-confidence and knowledge of her personality achieved during acting classes, in which she accepted that [...] "was never going to be the cheerleader or the beautiful, conventional girl who fits in everywhere." ...|$|E
