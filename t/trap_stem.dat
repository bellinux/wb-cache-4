Here, we present a simple model system of a benzoic acid derivative on a bulk insulator surface. Combining high-resolution noncontact atomic force microscopy experiments and density functional theory, we characterize the structure and the thermodynamic stability {{of a set of}} temperature-dependent molecular phases formed by 2, 5 -dihydroxybenzoic acid molecules, self-assembled on the insulating calcite (10. 4) surface. We demonstrate that a striped phase forms before the thermodynamically favored dense phase, indicating a kinetically trapped state. Our theoretical analysis elucidates that this striped-to-dense phase transition is associated with a distinct change in the chemical interactions involved in the two phases. The striped phase is characterized by a balance between molecule-molecule and molecule-substrate interactions, reminiscent of the molecular bulk. In contrast, the dense phase is formed by upright standing molecules that strongly anchor to the surface with a comparatively little influence of the intermolecular interactions, i. e., in the latter case the substrate acts as a template for the molecular structure. The kinetic <b>trapping</b> <b>stems</b> from a relatively strong intermolecular interaction between molecules in the striped phase that need to be broken before the substrate-templated dense phase can be formed. Thus, our results provide molecular level insights into two qualitatively different bonding motifs of a simple organic molecule on a bulk insulator surface. This understanding is mandatory for obtaining predictive power in the rational design of molecular structures on insulating surfaces. Â© 2016 American Chemical Society...|$|R

Recent research has given {{a better understanding of}} key epidemiological factors which has resulted in improved disease management in the PNW. This work reviews the epidemiology of Sclerotinia stem rot and high-lights information that has led to the better management of the disease on potato. The primary source of inoculum of Sclerotinia sclerotiorum for potato in the Columbia Basin of the PNW are as-cospores produced within potato fields or carried by wind currents from neighboring fields planted to winter cereals or other crops. Ascospores are ejected from apothecia and disseminated throughout the Columbia Basin over an extended time period. Immature apothecia generally first emerge at or shortly after row closure in potato fields in the Columbia Basin. Ascospores of S. sclerotiorum are incapable of direct infection of intact green potato tissues, and flower blossoms are crucial for infection and development of the disease in potato.

In this study, we generated p 29 knockout mice (mp 29 (GT/GT)) using the mp 29 gene <b>trap</b> embryonic <b>stem</b> cells to study the role of mp 29 in DNA damage response in vivo. Interruption of mp 29 at both alleles resulted in embryonic lethality. Embryonic abnormality occurred as early as E 6. 5 in mp 29 (GT/GT) mice accompanied with decreased mRNA levels of α-tubulin and Chk 1. The reduction of α-tubulin and Chk 1 mRNAs is likely due to an impaired post-transcriptional event. An aberrant G 2 /M checkpoint was found in mp 29 gene trap embryos when exposed to aphidicolin and UV light. This embryonic lethality was rescued by crossing with mp 29 transgenic mice. Additionally, the knockdown of zfp 29 in zebrafish resulted in embryonic death at 72 hours of development postfertilization (hpf).

Methodology/Principal Findings. In this study, we used public gene-trap data to model gene-trap likelihood. Using the association of gene length and gene expression with gene-trap likelihood, we constructed spline-based regression models that characterize which genes are susceptible and which genes are resistant to gene-trapping techniques.

Scaffolds containing immobilized heparin to <b>trap</b> the <b>stem</b> cell chemo-attractant stromal cell-derived factor 1 alpha (SDF 1 alpha) were implanted subcutaneously into C 57 Bl 6 mice, and influx of cells was monitored using immunohistochemistry. Five weeks post-implantation, heparinized scaffolds were always populated by cells, but incorporating SDF 1 alpha considerably stimulated recruitment of cells. SDF 1 alpha could not exert this effect when the formation of a SDF 1 alpha gradient was abrogated. Scaffolds were mainly populated by CD 11 b+ and CD 11 c+ myeloid cells and fibroblasts. One week after implantation, scaffolds harbored only low numbers of cells. Apparently, not all CXCR 4 -expressing cells, like large numbers of granulocytes, migrate into the scaffold, but retransplantation of a 1 -week-old scaffold from a CD 45. 2 (+) into a CD 45. 1 (+) mouse yielded a scaffold harboring mainly CD 45. 2 (+) cells after 5 weeks.

40|$|One of {{the most}} {{powerful}} techniques for studying the function of a gene is to disrupt the expression of that gene using genetic engineering strategies such as targeted recombination or viral integration of gene trap cassettes. The tremendous utility of these tools was recognized this year with the awarding of the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine to Capecchi, Evans, and Smithies for their pioneering work in targeted recombination mutagenesis in mammals. Another noteworthy discovery made nearly a decade ago was the identification of a novel class of noncoding genes called microRNAs. MicroRNAs are among the largest known classes of regulatory elements with more than 1000 predicted to exist in the mouse genome. Over 50 % of known microRNAs are located within introns of coding genes. Given that currently about half of the genes in mouse have been knocked out, we investigated the possibility that intronic microRNAs may have been coincidentally deleted or disrupted in some of these mouse models. We searched published murine knockout studies and gene <b>trap</b> embryonic <b>stem</b> cell line databases for cases where a microRNA was located within or near the manipulated genomic loci, finding almost 200 cases where microRNA expression may have been disrupted along with another gene. Our results draw attention to the need for careful planning in future knockout studies to minimize the unintentional disruption of microRNAs. These data also raise the possibility that many knockout studies may need to be reexamined to determine if loss of a microRNA contributes to the phenotypic consequences attributed to loss of a protein-encoding gene...|$|R

The challenge is to develop systematic, genome-wide mutagenesis approaches to the study of gene function. The current mouse mutant resource has been an important source of human genetic disease models. However, despite an apparently large catalogue of mouse mutations, we have access to mutations at {{only a small fraction of}} the likely total number of mammalian genes—there is a phenotype gap that needs to be filled by the establishment of new mutagenesis programmes. Two routes, genotype- and phenotype-driven, can be used for the recovery of novel mouse mutations. For the former, gene <b>trap</b> embryonic <b>stem</b> cell libraries appear set to deliver a large number of mutations around the mouse genome. The advantage of genotype-driven approaches is the ease of identification of the mutated locus; the disadvantage that a priori assumptions have to be made concerning the function and likely phenotype of the mutated gene. In contrast, phenotype-driven mutagenesis emphasizes the recovery of novel phenotypes. One phenotype-driven approach that {{will play a}}n important role in expanding the mouse mutant resource employs the mutagen N-ethyl-N-nitrosourea (ENU). The phenotype-driven route makes no assumptions about the underlying genes involved, and ENU mutagenesis programmes can be expected to play a significant role in uncovering novel pathways and genes; the disadvantage is that the identification of the mutant gene is still not trivial. Together, the complementary routes of genotype- and phenotype-driven mutagenesis will provide a much enlarged catalogue of mouse mutations and phenotypes for future gene function studies...|$|R

One technique used for detection of A. planipennis is {{the establishment and}} peeling of girdled trap trees. In {{an effort to reduce}} the search effort and target detection survey efforts within ash trap trees, a predictive model was created using data from 2007 and validated using data from 2008. In 2007 and 2008, ash trap trees were established, harvested, peeled and inspected for A. planipennis larvae. Gaussian curves were fit to describe the relationship between stem diameter and relative proportion and frequency of larvae. The observed and predicted 2008 relative proportion and frequency of larvae did not differ in paired t-tests. Within the relative proportion and frequency Gaussian models, the curves peaked at approximately 10 cm iameter signifying the greatest proportion and frequency of A. planipennis larvae occurred at 10 cm stem diameter. This peak was then bracketed by 2 cm on each side creating a target stem section with a top diameter of 8 cm and a bottom diameter of 12 cm. A simple linear regression was fit to describe the relationship between the larvae count within the targeted 8 – 12 cm section of tree and the larvae per cm 3 of phloem per tree for 2007. The observed and predicted 2008 larvae per cm 3 did not differ in a paired t-test.

40|$|AbstractDivision of {{a female}} Drosophila stem cell {{produces}} a daughter stem cell and a cystoblast. The cystoblast produces a syncytial cluster of 16 cells by precisely four mitotic divisions and incomplete cytokinesis. Mutations in genes required for cystoblast differentiation, such as bag-of-marbles, block syncytial cluster formation and produce a distinctive “tumorous” or hyperplastic germ cell phenotype. In this paper, we compare the oogenic phenotype of benign gonial cell neoplasm mutations to that of mutations in bam. The data indicate that, like bam, bgcn is required for cystoblast development and that germ cells lacking bgcn become <b>trapped</b> in a <b>stem</b> cell-like state. One indication that germ cells lacking bgcn cannot form cystoblasts is that bgcn stem cells resist genetic ablation by Bam misexpression. Misexpression of Bam eliminates wild-type stem cells, apparently by inducing them to divide as cystoblasts. bgcn stem cells remain active when Bam is misexpressed, probably because they cannot adopt the cystoblast fate. Bgcn activity is not required for Bam protein expression but {{is essential for the}} localization of Bam protein to the fusome. Together, the results suggest that Bam and Bgcn cooperatively regulate cystoblast differentiation by controlling localization of Bam protein to the fusome...|$|R

Understanding and predicting landing behavior of A. planipennis may {{assist in the}} further development of trapping techniques and improvement of trapping protocols for widespread survey programs in North America. Three multiple regression models were developed using ash tree vigor and crown light exposure to predict the landing behavior of A. planipennis. These models were then used to predict the landing density of A. planipennis at separate sites and in separate years. Successful prediction of A. planipennis capture density at the test sites was limited. Even though the multiple regression models were not effective at predicting landing behavior of A. planipennis, tree characteristics were used to predict the likelihood of A. planipennis landing. Trees predicted as having high likelihood of landing had 3. 5 times as many A. planipennis adults/m 2 on <b>stem</b> <b>traps</b> than trees predicted as having low likelihood of landing. While the landing density of A. planipennis may not be efficiently predicted, the utility of these predictions {{may be in the}} form of identifying trees with a high likelihood of A. planipennis landing.

To capture prey, Allomerus decemarticulatus workers build gallery-shaped <b>traps</b> on the <b>stems</b> of their associated myrmecophyte, Hirtella physophora. We wondered whether the frequent presence of immobilized prey on the trap attracted flying cleptoparasites. Nine social wasp species nest in the H. physophora foliage; of the six species studied, only Angiopolybia pallens rob prey from Allomerus colonies. For those H. physophora not sheltering wasps, we noted cleptobiosis by stingless bees (Trigona), social wasps (A. pallens and five Agelaia species), assassin bugs (Reduviidae), and flies. A relationship between {{the size of the}} robbers and their rate of capture by ambushing Allomerus workers was established for social wasps; small wasps were easily captured, while the largest never were. Reduviids, which are slow to extract their rostrum from prey, were always captured, while Trigona and flies often escaped. The balance sheet for the ants was positive vis-à-vis the reduviids and four out of the six social wasp species. For the latter, wasps began by cutting up parts of the prey's abdomen and were captured (or abandoned the prey) before the entire abdomen was retrieved so that the total weight of the captured wasps exceeded that of the prey abdomens. For A. pallens, {{we show that}} the number of individuals captured during attempts at cleptobiosis increases with the size of the Allomerus' prey...|$|R

The human ortholog encodes a transmembrane protein containing five extracellular immunoglobulin-like domains that is structurally related to human NEPHRIN, a protein associated with congenital nephrotic syndrome. Northern analysis revealed wide expression in humans and mice, with highest expression in kidney. Based on similarity to NEPHRIN and abundant expression in kidney, this protein was designated NEPH 1 and embryonic stem cells containing the retroviral insertion in the Neph 1 locus were used to generate mutant mice. Analysis of kidney RNA from Neph 1 −/− mice showed that the retroviral insertion disrupted expression of Neph 1 transcripts. Neph 1 −/− pups were represented at the expected normal Mendelian ratios at 1 to 3 days of age but at only 10 % of the expected frequency at 10 to 12 days after birth, suggesting an early postnatal lethality. The Neph 1 −/− animals that survived beyond {{the first week of}} life were sickly and small but without edema, and all died between 3 and 8 weeks of age. Proteinuria ranging from 300 to 2, 000 mg/dl was present in all Neph 1 −/− mice.

40|$|Colorectal {{carcinoma}} (CRC) is {{a common}} cause of cancer-related death worldwide. Indeed, treatment failures are triggered by cancer stem cells (CSCs) {{that give rise to}} tumor repopulation upon initial remission. Thus, the role of the heat shock protein TRAP 1 in stemness was investigated in CRC cell lines and human specimens, based on its involvement in colorectal carcinogenesis, through regulation of apoptosis, protein homeostasis and bioenergetics. Strikingly, co-expression between <b>TRAP</b> 1 and <b>stem</b> cell markers was observed in stem cells located at the bottom of intestinal crypts and in CSCs sorted from CRC cell lines. Noteworthy, TRAP 1 knockdown reduced the expression of stem cell markers and impaired colony formation, being the CSC phenotype and the anchorage-independent growth conserved in TRAP 1 -rich cancer cells. Consistently, the gene expression profiling of HCT 116 cells showed that TRAP 1 silencing results in the loss of the stem-like signature with acquisition of a more-differentiated phenotype and the downregulation of genes encoding for activating ligands and target proteins of Wnt/β-catenin pathway. Mechanistically, TRAP 1 maintenance of stemness is mediated by the regulation of Wnt/β-catenin signaling, through the modulation of the expression of frizzled receptor ligands and the control of β-catenin ubiquitination/phosphorylation. Remarkably, TRAP 1 is associated with higher expression of β-catenin and several Wnt/β-catenin target genes in human CRCs, thus supporting the relevance of TRAP 1 regulation of β-catenin in human pathology. This study is the first demonstration that TRAP 1 regulates stemness and Wnt/β-catenin pathway in CRC and provides novel landmarks in cancer biology and therapeutics...|$|R
40|$|Optical {{trapping}} {{of particles}} {{has become a}} powerful non-mechanical and nondestructive technique for precise particle positioning. The manipulation of particles in the evanescent field of a channel waveguide potentially allows for sorting and trapping of several particles and cells simultaneously. In the evanescent field above an optical channel waveguide, particles experience three optical forces; i) a transverse gradient force, which acts {{in the direction of}} the intensity gradient, ii) a scattering force, which acts {{in the direction of the}} wave propagation and is proportional to the surface intensity and, iii) an absorption force, which is dependent upon the complex refractive index of the particle. A particle in the evanescent field will be propelled and trapped with a dependence on the intensity gradient (a property dependent upon the physical characteristic of the waveguide). A channel waveguide producing such an evanescent field can be photolithographically defined on a glass substrate and thus has the potential to be integrated into a single chip device. This thesis describes the studies carried out, both theoretically and experimentally, to establish optimum waveguide fabrication conditions and the experimental requirements to ultimately allow for the separation of polymer particles and mammalian cells according to their size and refractive index. Theoretical aspects of the interaction of particles and cells on surfaces were evaluated and their Brownian motion was investigated. Optical channel waveguides of different characteristics have been fabricated using caesium ion-exchange process on soda-lime substrates. The propulsion of polymer particles has been achieved and characterised against different optical parameters, waveguide conditions and particle’s characteristics on different surfaces.

40|$|Quick process pickles {{differ from}} {{fermented}} pickles because the pickling process uses acetic acid from vinegar rather than lactic acid from fermentation. Quick process pickles {{are ideal for}} those who want to make pickles, start to finish, in a few days. However, the flavor of fresh pack or quick process pickles is better if they are left to stand in sealed jars for several weeks. Safety The correct acid concentration, in the form of vinegar, is important because acid prevents the growth of Clostridium botulinum, a deadly microorganism, in quick process pickles. If acid concentration is not sufficient, there is a danger of botulism poisoning. Therefore, use only tested recipes, and do not change the proportion of food, water, and vinegar. Selection Select firm cucumbers. Always use a variety recommended for pickling. Refer to seed catalogs for information. Catalogs often distinguish varieties best for pickling by labeling them as such. Cucumbers labeled as “table use ” or for “slicing ” will NOT result in a quality product. If you buy cucumbers, select only unwaxed ones, as the brine used in the pickling process cannot penetrate through the wax. For highest quality, plan to pickle the cucumbers within 24 hours after they are picked. If the produce cannot be used immediately, refrigerate it, or temporarily store it in a cool, well-ventilated place. This is particularly important for cucumbers because they deteriorate rapidly, especially at room temperature. Preparation Sort the vegetables and select the size best suited for your recipe: 1 inch in length cucumbers for gherkins, and 4 -inch cucumbers for dills. Do not use vegetables showing evidence of mold. Proper processing kills microorganisms that cause spoilage but does not destroy the off flavor from the mold. Wash vegetables well, especially around the <b>stems.</b> Soil <b>trapped</b> around the <b>stem</b> breeds bacteria that softens pickles. Because the blossom end of the vegetables contains enzymes that can cause softening, it should also be removed with a 1 / 16 -inch slice.

30|$|Without thinning, oak and {{red maple}} {{seedlings}} {{are caught in}} a fire trap (Grady and Hoffmann 2012). In our study, 80 % to 90 % of seedlings remained less than 30 cm tall after one or three fires. Although fire behavior was not assessed as an objective in this study, the fire temperatures we obtained were within the ranges reported by others for dormant season burns in Eastern deciduous forests (Franklin et al. 1997, Iverson et al. 2004, Phillips and Waldrop 2008), but may have been insufficient to cause mortality of shade-casting overstory trees. Without thinning, available light is too low to support rapid rates of height growth for either oaks or red maple, and frequent fire {{in the short term}} sets back shoot development. Burns that reduce post-fire seedling emergence of red maple have been documented (Glasgow and Matlack 2007), and Brose (2010) noted that seedling-origin dominant stems were only found in controls, not in any of the burn treatments. With thinning, oak seedlings that were burned also appeared to be caught in a fire <b>trap,</b> with fewer <b>stems</b> tallied in the largest size classes. There was no clear pattern for red maple seedlings under thinning and fire, as distribution among height classes was somewhat even. In these systems, juvenile sprouting must be considered part of the recruitment strategy. Without thinning, red maple sprouts were not trapped in the smaller size classes following one fire, a trend found elsewhere (Arthur et al. 1998, Albrecht and McCarthy 2006). With three fires, red maple sprouts were maintained as smaller stems. Under thinning, oak and maple sprouts responded favorably to one fire, with over 60 % of the sprouts in the largest size class for oak and over 90 % for maple; with three fires, oak sprouts did not recruit into larger sizes. The key to developing large oak advance reproduction is to have sufficient light in the understory and time between fires to permit positive net root growth. Then, when the oak seedling sprouts are competitive, they need further release from overstory competition and a fire-free period to allow for recruitment into the overstory. Reproduction needs to reach a threshold size before it can escape from fire. Longer fire-free periods (antecedent periods as described by Arthur et al. 2015) may allow seedlings and sprouts enough time to grow into a fire-resistant size (Jacqmain et al. 1999, Fan et al. 2012, Grady and Hoffman 2012).|$|R
40|$|The {{discovery}} of novel genes involved in hematopoietic development and lymphoid function {{is necessary for}} the understanding of these systems. To this end, we utilized transmembrane protein-specific gene <b>trapping</b> in embryonic <b>stem</b> (ES) cells, a method of forward genetics, to identify a novel, complex locus from which several splice variants arise. The trapped locus identified in the KST 30 ES cell clone encodes several genes including outer membrane protein 25 (OMP 25) and activin receptor interacting protein (ARIP 2) and two novel genes, AK 74 and AK 88. AK 74 is highly conserved between human and mouse with 85 % identity at the amino acid level. The human homolog was cloned from CD 34 + cord blood hematopoietic stem cell progenitors (HSCPs) implying that it may have a role in the hematopoietic system. We generated mice from the gene trapped ES cells, called KST 30 mice, to analyze the expression pattern of transcripts from the trapped locus in the hematopoietic system. Utilizing the gene trap LacZ reporter and RT-PCR, we found that AK 88 and AK 74 are expressed in hematopoietic stem cells and thymocytes and that AK 88 and ARIP 2 are dramatically up-regulated in activated Band T lymphocytes. In addition, we found restricted expression of the gene trap in most non-lymphoid tissues. Interestingly, the expression pattern of the gene trap coincides with the expression of activin signaling components in many cell types including thymocytes, activated B cells, hematopoietic stem cells and the ductal cells of the pancreas. AK 74, AK 88 and ARIP 2 share two exons that encode a 44 amino acid region. ARIP 2 negatively regulates activin signaling through endocytosis of Activin type II receptors. The N-terminal PDZ domain associates with ActRII and mediates endocytosis via association with RalBP 1. The region of ARIP 2 that associates with RalBP 1 encompasses the 44 amino acid region also found in AK 74 and AK 88, suggesting that these proteins may also associate with RalBP 1, perhaps sequestering it from ARIP 2. This possibility combined with the similarities between gene trap expression and expression of the components of activin signaling indicates a role of the trapped genes in activin signaling. AK 74 and AK 88 have a signal sequence and transmembrane domain that are predicted to direct them to mitochondria. To confirm this prediction, we examined the subcellular localization of AK 74 and found that it localizes to a punctate, perinuclear structure identified as mitochondria using a mitochondria specific dye. AK 74 was not seen in the cytoplasm, nucleus or at the plasma membrane of cells. To determine the function of these novel genes, AK 74 was retrovirally over-expressed in a double positive thymoma cell line and examined the global expression profile using Affymetrix gene chip. AK 74 changed the expression levels of 36 genes greater than 3 -fold compared to vector alone. Of these genes, several are involved in cytoskeletal rearrangement, apoptosis or are regulated by calcium signaling. Using yeast two-hybrid, several candidate binding partners for AK 74 were identified, one of which is the receptor for activated protein kinase C (RACK 1). RACK 1 was also identified as a potential binding partner for AK 88. RACK 1 is a WD 40 domain-containing scaffolding protein that has been implicated in many pathways but most prominently in the protein kinase C signaling pathway. Association with RACK 1 by either AK 74 or AK 88 suggests that they may be involved in RACK 1 function. Both RACK 1 and PKC are involved with Ca 2 + signaling through different mechanisms. This, combined with global gene expression changes in AK 74 over-expressing cells suggests a role for AK 74, AK 88 or ARIP 2 in Ca 2 + signaling. When we examined the expression of the trapped genes in mice homozygous for the gene-trapped allele (KST 30 tr/tr) we found that insertion of the gene trap caused a severe decrease in AK 88 and ARIP 2 but not AK 74 transcripts. Analysis of KST 30 tr/tr mice showed no abnormalities in conventional lymphoid populations and precursors, however, intraepithelial lymphocyte (IEL) populations were altered by the loss of AK 88 and/or ARIP 2. There was an approximate 2 -fold decrease CD 8 αα+ T cells in the small intestine while CD 8 αβ+ T cells were largely unaltered. Using gene trap technology, we have identified two novel, mitochondria-localized proteins. The cumulative findings described in this thesis, including the homology between AK 74, AK 88 and ARIP 2, their expression pattern and the phenotype of KST 30 tr/tr mice, suggest possible roles of AK 74 and AK 88 in diverse pathways...|$|R
40|$|IntroductionHeart {{failure is}} a major {{cardiovascular}} health problem. Coronary artery disease {{is the leading cause}} of congestive heart failure (CHF) [1]. Cardiac transplantation remains the most effective long-term treatment option, however is limited primarily by donor availability, rejection and infections. Mechanical circulatory support has its own indications and limitations [2]. Therefore, there is a need to develop more effective therapeutic strategies. Recently, regenerative medicine has received considerable scientific attention in the cardiovascular arena. We report here our experience demonstrating the beneficial effects of cardiac stem cell therapy on left ventricular functions in a patient with Hodgkin’s lymphoma (HL) who developed CHF due to ischemic heart disease during the course of lymphoma treatment. Case reportA 58 -year-old male with relapsed HL was referred to our bone marrow transplantation unit in October 2009. He was given 8 courses of combination chemotherapy with doxorubicin, bleomycin, vincristine, and dacarbazine (ABVD) between June 2008 and February 2009 and achieved complete remission. However, his disease relapsed 3 months after completing the last cycle of ABVD and he was decided to be treated with DHAP (cisplatin, cytarabine, dexamethasone) followed autologous stem cell transplantation (SCT). After the completion of first course of DHAP regimen, he developed acute myocardial infarction (AMI) and coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) was performed. After his cardiac function stabilized, 3 additional courses of DHAP were given and he was referred to our centre for consideration of autologous SCT. Computed tomography scans obtained after chemotherapy confirmed complete remission. Stem cells were collected from peripheral blood after mobilization with 10 µg/kg/day granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) subcutaneously. Collection was started on the fifth day of G-CSF and performed for 3 consecutive days. Flow cytometric analysis of CD 34 was used to identify hematopoietic stem cells. During the last evaluation before stem cell transplantation, conventional echocardiogram (ECHO) revealed left ventricular systolic dysfunction with an ejection fraction of ALEF: 44 %, MODEF: 45 %, MUGA scan showed a decreased left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF: 43 %) (Figure 1). In view of these findings, the patient was found ineligible for SCT and he was offered to give his peripheral blood stem cells for the treatment of heart failure. After receiving the patient’s signed informed consent form, a total number of 3. 49 x 106 /kg CD 34 + cells were infused via antecubital vein. Echocardiographic studies performed 2 months after stem cell therapy revealed a similar ejection fraction rate while a significant improvement in left ventricular ejection fraction (ALEF: 55 %, MODEF: 57 %) was noticed in ECHO performed 7 months after stem cell therapy (Figure 2). EF values at various time periods are shown on Table 1. Myocardial perfusion scintigraphy was also performed and showed infarction containing viable tissue in inferior wall (Figure 3). Myocardial positron emission tomography revealed that glucose metabolism was conserved in inferior wall. HL was in complete remission in the 2 months follow up after SCT but SCT for HL was not contemplated because renal failure due to chemotherapy developed later. Discussion Here, we reported a patient with HL who was ineligible for SCT because of low LVEF due to AMI. LVEF was low despite CABG. Collected stem cells were used as a stem cell therapy for heart failure since he was ineligible for SCT directed to treat HL. Although intravenous infusion of stem/progenitor cells are not favoured any more and intracoronary infusion or intramyocardial injections are preferred in latest reports [3] our data supports this route can still be effective. The objective of stem cell therapy in CHF due to ischemic heart disease is to repopulate post-infarction scar tissue with contractile cells that can engraft in sufficient numbers to differentiate to the cardiac myocytes and restore functionality in these akinetic areas. Hematopoietic stem cells consist can differentiate to skeletal and myocardial cells when cultured under appropriate conditions [4]. Strauer et al [5] reported that intracoronary bone marrow stem cell therapy improves ventricular performance, quality of life and survival in patients with chronic heart failure. Hamano et al [6] showed in 5 patients that autologous bone marrow cells can be injected safely during a by-pass operation into areas of ischemic myocardium. Brehm et al [7] have treated 23 patients with acute cardiac infarction using autologous mononuclear bone marrow cells. Ozbaran et al [8] transplanted peripheral blood stem cells into areas of injury with open-heart surgery in six patients with ischemic cardiomyopathy. There are also meta-analysis on ongoing clinical trials performed. Abdel-Latif et al [9] described a statistically significant improvement in ejection fraction, reduction in infarct size and left ventricular end-systolic volume in 18 patients treated with either unseparated bone marrow cells, bone marrow mesenchymal and mobilized peripheral blood cells. Martin-Rendon et al ­­ focused on 13 randomized studies encompassing 811 participants on bone marrow therapy for post acute infarction. Improvement in LVEF, decrease in left ventricular and systolic and end diastolic volumes and infarct size were observed. The reason for choice of intravenous route was being the standard way of giving hematopoietic stem cells by hematologists. We tried to decide the availibility of this route for indications other than hematological diseases. Although <b>trapping</b> of <b>stem</b> cells in the pulmonary vascular bed is a drawback of intravenous route and the question of whether the patient would have been more benefited by intracoronary or intramyocardial route remains unanswered, we think intravenous route may still have some role according to our own experience from this patient. ConclusionStudies in the era of cardiac stem cell therapy are heterogenous. It is not yet possible to comment on the most appropriate stem cell type and route of administration. When we assess the results from literature and the improvement in our own patient we think stem cell therapy can be an option for bridging to heart transplantation or an adjuvant therapy for CHF.
