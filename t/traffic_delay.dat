25|$|Like many cities, traffic {{congestion}} {{is a significant}} problem in and around Edinburgh, with 160,000 vehicles entering the city every day which is forecast to rise to 180,000 by 2016. This is especially problematic in the rush hour periods from 7.30am to 9.30am and 4pm to 6pm. Increasing levels of {{traffic congestion}} in Edinburgh are generally attributed to the city's strong population growth {{as well as an}} expanding economy. Areas in the future which are expected to suffer acutely from traffic congestion in Edinburgh include the western outskirts of the city, the waterfront, and the residential areas of the South East where there is a large amount of housing development. Notorious traffic hotspots in Edinburgh include the Straiton and Dreghorn junctions on the Edinburgh City Bypass. The Newbridge Roundabout on the A8 western approach to the city and the Gogar Roundabout close to Edinburgh Park are other bottlenecks in the west of the city which suffer from congestion. The office and business developments at Edinburgh Park themselves generate a large amount of traffic {{in that part of the}} city, with the new Royal Bank of Scotland headquarters opening at Gogarburn ensuring that upwards of 20,000 people now work in this area. In the city centre itself, narrow, cobbled and winding streets in the Old Town as well as increasing restrictions on vehicles entering the city and strict parking regulations mean that traffic hotspots are common in the city centre itself. Queen Street, Charlotte Square and the western end of Princes Street are areas of significant <b>traffic</b> <b>delay.</b>|$|E

5000|$|According to {{transportation}} engineers, traffic lights can have {{both positive and}} negative effects on traffic safety and traffic flow. The separation of conflicting streams of traffic in time can reduce the chances of right-angle collisions.

They can increase the traffic capacity at intersections, but can also result in excessive <b>traffic</b> <b>delay.</b> Hans Monderman, the innovative Dutch traffic engineer, and pioneer of shared space schemes, was sceptical of their role, and is quoted as having said of them: [...] "We only want traffic lights where they are useful and I haven't found anywhere where they are useful yet." ...|$|E

50|$|The United Nations has an Office of the High Representative for the Least Developed Countries, Landlocked Developing Countries and Small Island Developing States (UN-OHRLLS). It mainly {{holds the}} view that high {{transport}} costs due to distance and terrain result in the erosion of competitive edge for exports from landlocked countries. In addition, it recognizes the constraints on landlocked countries to be mainly physical, including lack of {{direct access to the}} sea, isolation from world markets and high transit costs due to physical distance. It also attributes geographic remoteness {{as one of the most}} significant reasons why developing landlocked nations cannot alleviate themselves, while European landlocked cases are mostly developed because of short distances to the sea through well-developed countries. One other commonly cited factor is the administrative burdens associated with border crossings as there is a heavy load of bureaucratic procedures, paperwork, custom charges, and most importantly, <b>traffic</b> <b>delay</b> due to border wait times, which affect delivery contracts. Delays and inefficiency compound geographically, where a 2 to 3 week wait due to border customs between Uganda and Kenya makes it impossible to book ships ahead of time in Mombasa, furthering delivery contract delays.

40|$|Transportation is an {{important}} sector to support the development of countries in terms of highway design, road systems and traffic management. As users of transport infrastructure, human has close relationship {{to the field of}} transportation. Their driving behavior affects vehicle movements and may cause conflicts. In order to investigate the conflicts such as <b>traffic</b> <b>delay,</b> there are two different calculation methods using SUMO software and IHCM 1997 manually. The objective of this research is to compare the calculation methods of <b>traffic</b> <b>delay</b> using IHCM 1997 and SUMO which more appropriately with the actual condition. The research location is in Idröttsparken roundabout, Norrköping, Sweden which has four arms. The data collection is conducted during three days in the morning and afternoon. Types of data collection in this research were traffic flow and its turning, travel time and queue length. The queue length data is converted into <b>traffic</b> <b>delay</b> data for observation data. In SUMO, the <b>traffic</b> <b>delay</b> value is the mean halting duration. In IHCM 1997, the calculation of <b>traffic</b> <b>delay</b> needs several data i. e. roundabout geometric, capacity, and degree of saturation. To analyze data, the statistical method is used i. e. normality test, parametric and non-parametric test and also linear regression method. The result showed the <b>traffic</b> <b>delay</b> in observation data is higher than delay in SUMO result and IHCM 1997 calculation. The statistical results showed that the <b>traffic</b> <b>delay</b> of SUMO, and IHCM 1997 have no similarities to the observation. Furthermore, from the linear regression result, only SUMO result has the highest value for determination coefficient (R 2) compared to IHCM 1997 as shown in the West and South arms for SUMO result in the morning measurement. It means SUMO more representatives the observation compared to IHCM 1997. It is occurred because SUMO is developed in Europe and also the location for this research is in Sweden, Europe which has very different traffic condition from Indonesia.

40|$|AbstractThe Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) is {{a method}} which {{aggregates}} the environmental impacts associated within {{the life cycle of}} a pavement. Incorporation of LCA has been mostly focused on the emissions produced in the construction phase and in its constituents, such as material extraction and manufacturing, hauling of materials, etc. Less emphasis has been given to emissions caused by traffic delays during maintenance operations due to lack of well-defined methodology and unfamiliarity about the magnitude of these emissions. In this study, an approach is proposed to include <b>traffic</b> <b>delay</b> emissions by combining Users Cost approach of Life Cycle Cost Analysis (LCCA) with Motor Vehicle Emissions Simulator (MOVES 2014) developed by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (US EPA). The LCA was performed for four different pavement designs and their Global Warming Potential (GWP) were included in the assessment. The GWP of the four designs with and without considering <b>traffic</b> <b>delay</b> emissions (in carbon dioxide equivalents: CO 2 e) were 53, 51, 50, and 22 versus 6. 1, 4. 5, 4. 3, and 13 thousand tons per mile, respectively.

40|$|Intersection <b>traffic</b> <b>delay</b> {{research}} has traditionally placed {{greater emphasis on}} the study of through and left-turning vehicles than right-turning ones, which often renders existing methods or models inapplicable to intersections with heavy pedestrian and non-motorized traffic. In the meantime, there is also a need for understanding the relations between different types of delay and how they each contribute to the total delay of the entire intersection. In order to address these issues, this paper first examines models that focus on through and left-turn traffic delays, taking into account the presence of heavy mixed traffic flows that are prevalent in developing countries, then establishes a model for calculating right-turn <b>traffic</b> <b>delay</b> and, last, proposes an approach to analyzing how much each of the three types of <b>traffic</b> <b>delay</b> contributes to the total delay of the intersection, based on the application of shift-share analysis (SSA), which has been applied extensively in the field of economics...|$|E
