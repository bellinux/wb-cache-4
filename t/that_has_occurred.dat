5|$|The most {{important}} breeding populations in Europe, in Russia and Sweden are stable, and the breeding range in Norway {{has expanded to}} the south, but populations have more than halved in Finland, Poland, Latvia and The Netherlands. Although the small populations in these countries are of limited overall significance, the decline {{is a continuation of}} trend towards range contraction <b>that</b> <b>has</b> <b>occurred</b> over the last two centuries. The drop in numbers in Europe has been attributed to drainage, increased fertiliser use, the loss of formerly mown or grazed breeding sites and over-hunting.|$|E
5|$|On July10, 2008, {{a tanker}} truck {{full of water}} crashed into a tree along a portion of NY149 between Bay Road (CR7) and Ridge Road (NY9L) that {{features}} a sharp curve. After the first accident occurred at 3:10 a.m., a second tractor-trailer, who had stopped because of the tanker, rolled in reverse, jackknifing across the road and hitting a car. The road was shut down for the accident, where {{the driver of the}} tanker was taken to Glens Falls Hospital. The drivers of the car and the tractor-trailer that jackknifed were not hurt. The route was reopened by 11:40 a.m. This accident was one of many tractor-trailer accidents <b>that</b> <b>has</b> <b>occurred</b> on this stretch of NY149.|$|E

5|$|Hibbard {{wrote that}} the {{condition}} of the mental foramen and masseteric ridges excluded the specimen from Onychomys, Peromyscus, Reithrodontomys, and Eligmodontia and that in these features and in its depth and size, the fossil more closely resembled Oryzomys; therefore, he placed it in that genus with a query. Oryzomys is a living genus <b>that</b> <b>has</b> <b>occurred</b> in the United States since at least 300,000 years ago. In 1966, Philip Hershkovitz wrote that Hibbard had reconsidered his opinion after re-examining ? O.pliocaenicus in 1952; he no longer thought that it was an Oryzomys and instead believed it may be a Bensonomys. The latter genus occurs in the late Miocene and early Pliocene of North America and has been variously interpreted as a close relative of the South American Calomys or merely as an evolutionarily convergent member of the North American subfamily Neotominae. Jon Baskin mentioned the animal in 1978 and 1986, asserting that it cannot be identified to genus level, but may be Bensonomys. Although some continue to list it under Oryzomys, it is now usually excluded from the genus. In 2008, Everett Lindsay listed ? O.pliocaenicus as a questionable species of Jacobsomys, a Pliocene North American genus which he said may be ancestral to Oryzomys.|$|E

25|$|Virtually all roads {{require some}} form of {{maintenance}} before {{they come to the}} end of their service life. Pro-active agencies use pavement management techniques to continually monitor road conditions and schedule preventive maintenance treatments as needed to prolong the lifespan of their roads. Technically advanced agencies monitor the road network surface condition with sophisticated equipment such as laser/inertial Profilometers. These measurements include road curvature, cross slope, asperity, roughness, rutting and texture. This data is fed into a pavement management system, which recommends the best maintenance or construction treatment to correct the damage <b>that</b> <b>has</b> <b>occurred.</b>|$|E

The transition from hunting and gathering to agriculture {{is not necessarily a}} one way process. It has been argued that hunting and gathering represents an adaptive strategy, which may still be exploited, if necessary, when environmental change causes extreme food stress for agriculturalists. In fact, it is sometimes difficult to draw a clear line between agricultural and hunter-gatherer societies, especially since the widespread adoption of agriculture and resulting cultural diffusion <b>that</b> <b>has</b> <b>occurred</b> in the last 10,000 years.|$|E
