5|$|A Czech woman went to Heydrich's aid and flagged down a {{delivery}} van. He was first {{placed in the}} driver's cab, but complained the van's movement was causing him pain. He was placed in <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>van,</b> on his stomach, and taken {{to the emergency room}} at Bulovka Hospital. He had suffered severe injuries to his left side, with major damage to his diaphragm, spleen, and one of his lungs. He also had a fractured rib. A doctor, Slanina, packed the chest wound, while another doctor, Walter Diek, tried unsuccessfully to remove the splinters. He immediately decided to operate. This was carried out by Diek, Slanina, and Hohlbaum. Heydrich was given several blood transfusions. A splenectomy was performed. The chest wound, left lung, and diaphragm were all debrided and the wounds closed.|$|E

25|$|Once {{outside the}} hospital, Alder argued {{with the police}} officers, who had {{initially}} {{told him to go}} home, and he was arrested to prevent a breach of the peace. A/PS Ellerington drove to the hospital to collect Alder for transport to the police station and detention. The vehicle used was a Mercedes-Benz Sprinter with a caged section in the rear. Although handcuffed, a witness would subsequently state that he recalled Alder climbed into <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>van</b> unassisted.|$|E

25|$|On this occasion, Norris hid in <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>van</b> {{in order}} to dupe Hall into {{thinking}} Bittaker was alone. Inside the van, Bittaker offered Hall a soft drink from the cooler located {{in the rear of}} the van. When she retrieved the soft drink, Norris pounced and, after a strenuous fight, subdued Hall by twisting her arm behind her back, causing her to scream in pain. Norris then gagged Hall with adhesive tape and bound her wrists and ankles.|$|E
500|$|In {{the early}} hours of 17 April 1943 the corpse of Michael was dressed as Martin, {{although}} there was one last-minute hitch: the feet had frozen. Purchase, Montagu and Cholmondeley could not put the boots on, so an electric fire was located and the feet defrosted enough to put the boots on properly. The pocket litter was placed on the body, and the briefcase attached. The body was placed in the canister, which was filled with [...] of dry ice and sealed up. When the dry ice sublimated, it filled the canister with carbon dioxide and drove out any oxygen, thus preserving the body without refrigeration. The canister was placed in the 1937 Fordson van of an MI5 driver St. John [...] "Jock" [...] Horsfall, who had been a racing champion before the war. Cholmondeley and Montagu travelled in <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>van,</b> which drove through the night to Greenock, west Scotland, where the canister was taken on board the submarine [...] Seraphs commander, Lt. Bill Jewell, and crew had previous special operations experience. Jewell told his men that the canister contained a top secret meteorological device to be deployed near Spain.|$|E
500|$|When Lisa {{develops}} stomach aches, she visits Dr. Hibbert, who {{suggests he}} could prescribe 'harsh Antacids' but says herbal tea could also work. Lisa wants the tea but Homer, scoffs at the tea and demands the antacids. While leaving the office Lisa {{has had enough}} and snaps at her father for belittling everything she believes in. When Lisa sees how she upset him, she says that they are just too different and will eventually drift apart. To make things up to her, Homer takes her to a local New Age store which introduces Homer and Lisa to water-filled sensory deprivation tanks, where they experience their own spiritual journey. On her journey, Lisa sees herself from Homer's perspective, reprimanding him for snoring during a ballet recital. Lisa realizes that despite his boorish personality, Homer loves Lisa enough {{to take her to}} events and places that he does not personally like just so she can be happy. Meanwhile, a pair of repo men start to clean out the store despite the lease not being up for months, taking the tank that Homer is in. Homer's [...] "journey" [...] becomes a real one, as his tank falls out of <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>van.</b> Mistaken by the Flanders' as a coffin, they bury him, only for the tank to fall through the soil and into a pipe where it is washed up onto the beach. Chief Wiggum finds it and returns it to the store. Lisa decides to go and do something they both enjoy. But they end up at a demolition derby together, even though Homer is the only fan.|$|E

As Ledford continued screaming, Bittaker began asking her as he struck her: [...] "What's the matter? Don't you like to scream?" ...|$|E
2500|$|A Four Square van visited {{houses in}} {{nationalist}} West Belfast {{twice a week}} to collect and deliver laundry. One [...] "employee" [...] (a young man) drove the van while another (a young woman) collected and delivered the laundry. Both were from Northern Ireland. Four Square initially gathered customers by offering [...] "discount vouchers", which were numbered and colour-coded by street. Clothes collected for washing were first forensically checked for traces of explosives, as well as blood or firearms residue. They were also compared to previous laundry loads from the same house—the sudden presence of different-sized clothes could indicate {{that the house was}} harbouring an IRA member. Surveillance operatives and equipment were hidden in <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>van</b> or in a compartment in the roof. Further intelligence was gathered by staff observing and [...] "chatting" [...] to locals whilst collecting their laundry.|$|E
2500|$|Burgess was a Conservative (though, as he {{clarified}} in {{an interview}} with The Paris Review, his political views could be considered [...] "a kind of anarchism" [...] since his ideal of a [...] "Catholic Jacobite imperial monarch" [...] wasn't practicable), a (lapsed) Catholic and Monarchist, harbouring a distaste for all republics. He believed that socialism for the most part was [...] "ridiculous" [...] but did [...] "concede that socialized medicine is a priority in any civilized country today." [...] To avoid the 90% tax the family would have incurred because of their high income, they left Britain and toured Europe in a Bedford Dormobile motor-home. During their travels through France and across the Alps, Burgess wrote in <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>van</b> as Liana drove. In this period, he wrote novels and produced film scripts for Lew Grade and Franco Zeffirelli. His first place of residence after leaving England was Lija, Malta (1968–70). The negative reaction from a lecture that Burgess delivered to an audience of Catholic priests in Malta precipitated a move by the couple to Italy. The Burgesses maintained a flat in Rome, a country house in Bracciano, and a property in Montalbuccio. On hearing rumours of a mafia plot to kidnap Paolo-Andrea while the family was staying in Rome, Burgess decided to move to Monaco in 1975. Burgess was also motivated to move to the tax haven of Monaco as the country did not levy income tax and widows were exempt from death duties, a form of taxation on their husband's estates.|$|E
