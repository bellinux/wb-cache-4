25|$|Based on this, {{one might}} <b>think</b> <b>that,</b> <b>if</b> <b>the</b> wavefunction for each {{particle}} (in more precise terms, the quantum field for each particle type) were simultaneously mirror-reversed, then the {{new set of}} wavefunctions would perfectly satisfy {{the laws of physics}} (apart from the weak interaction). It turns out that this is not quite true: In order for the equations to be satisfied, the wavefunctions of certain types of particles have to be multiplied by −1, in addition to being mirror-reversed. Such particle types are said to have negative or odd parity (P=−1, or alternatively P=–), while the other particles are said to have positive or even parity (P=+1, or alternatively P=+).|$|E
500|$|Provisionally {{known as}} the Thunderbolt, the Shelby {{prototype}} was more polished than the Miles version, and used a Ford 4-speed manual transmission. The Ford V8 was only 3.5 inches longer than the Alpine's 4-cylinder engine it replaced, so the primary concern was the engine's width. Like Miles, Shelby found that the Ford V8 would only just fit into the Alpine engine bay: [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>the</b> figure of speech about the shoehorn ever applied to anything, it surely did to the tight squeak in getting that 260 Ford mill into the Sunbeam engine compartment. There was a place for everything and a space for everything, but positively not an inch to spare." ...|$|E
2500|$|John Baird, the Minister of Foreign Affairs of Canada, {{welcomed the}} {{decision}} and praised {{the conduct of the}} referendum. The Premier of Quebec, Philippe Couillard, said that there were limited comparisons between Scotland and Quebec, where the sovereignty movement lost referendums in 1980 and 1995, and suggested a devolved model similar to federalism as a possible future model for the UK: [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>the</b> Scots had what we have, Quebecers within Canada, they probably would be quite happy". Stéphane Bédard, leader of the Parti Québécois, described himself as [...] "disappointed" [...] by the result.|$|E

2500|$|As an example, at {{the surface}} plasmon {{resonance}} for a silver nanoparticle, the scattering cross-section is about 10x the cross-section of the nanoparticle. [...] The goal of the nano-particles is to trap light {{on the surface of}} the SC. [...] The absorption of light is not important for the nanoparticle, rather, it is important for the SC. [...] One would <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>the</b> nanoparticle is increased in size, then the scattering cross-section becomes larger. [...] This is true, however, when compared with the size of the nanoparticle, the ratio (...) is reduced. [...] Particles with a large scattering cross section tend to have a broader plasmon resonance range.|$|E

50|$|Russell (Joel Weiss) {{is obsessed}} with farting, and loves to fart any time he can. His girlfriend, Heather (Shannandoah Sorin) despises farts and becomes angry with Russell because all he does is watch {{television}} and fart. She tells him that the only time she can feel relaxed is when Russell {{is out of the}} house, as she is away from his gas. She <b>thinks</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>the</b> television turns into fart jokes, which he also loves, then Russell won't even leave the house. Then one night, the television does become all about farts. This puts Heather to the ultimate test to see if she can get past his problem and love him. In the end, she has become so fed up with farting that she has a nightmare about farting. She wakes up and Russell farts. Heather realizes that {{there is no point in}} hating it anymore and decides to love him. The film concludes with both of them farting gleefully.|$|R

Now I've kept an eye on that henyard, and I've noticed that very often Farmer Brown's boy doesn't close the henyard gate at night. I suppose he <b>thinks</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>the</b> {{henhouse}} door is locked, the gate doesn't matter. Any one who is careless about one thing, is likely to be careless about another. Sometime he may forget to close that hole. I told you that we would try for one of those hens to-morrow morning, but the more I think about it, the more I think it will be wiser to visit that henhouse a few nights before we run the risk of trying to catch a hen in broad daylight. In fact, I am pretty sure I can make Farmer Brown's boy forget to close that gate." ...|$|R

60|$|I {{put down}} the paper, and my cheeks were flushed with enthusiasm. I <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>the</b> Duke had been there at that moment I could have kissed his hand.

"I do not know, my dear," [...] said Mr. Harding; [...] "but I do <b>think,</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>the</b> {{two young}} people are fond of each other, {{and if there is}} {{anything}} for them to live upon, it cannot be right to keep them apart.

"You have at {{all events}} taken your share in using good {{practical}} precautions for the town, {{and that is}} the best mode of asking for protection," [...] said Lydgate, with a strong distaste for the broken metaphor and bad logic of the banker's religion, somewhat increased by the apparent deafness of his sympathy. But his mind had taken up its long-prepared movement towards getting help, and was not yet arrested. He added, [...] "The town has done well in the way of cleansing, and finding appliances; and I <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>the</b> cholera should come, even our enemies will admit that the arrangements in the Hospital are a public good." ...|$|E
60|$|So Edith argued {{it in her}} own bosom, adding other wondrous {{mistakes}} to {{that first}} mistake she had made.

60|$|Nothing is {{more common}} than for pupils to say, when they fail of reciting their lesson, that they could say it at their seats, but that they cannot now say it, before the class.

But it should be kindly, though distinctly explained to them, that, in the business of life, they must have their knowledge so much at command, that they can use it, at all times, and in all circumstances, or it will do them little good.|$|E
60|$|JOB ARTHUR. I don't {{profess to}} be a red-rag Socialist. I don't pretend to <b>think</b> <b>that</b> <b>if</b> <b>the</b> Government had the pits {{it would be}} any better for us. No. What I mean is, that the pits are there and every man on this place depends on them, one way or another. They're the cow that gives the milk. And what I mean is, how every man shall have a proper share of the milk, which is food and living. It's like killing the goose that laid the golden egg. I {{want to keep the}} cow healthy and strong.
