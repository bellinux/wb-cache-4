25|$|Groups {{of human}} beings, left free to each {{regulate}} themselves, tend to produce spontaneous order, {{rather than the}} meaningless chaos often feared. This has been observed in society at least since Chuang Tzu in ancient China. A classic <b>traffic</b> <b>roundabout</b> is a good example, with cars {{moving in and out}} with such effective organization that some modern cities have begun replacing stoplights at problem intersections with traffic circles , and getting better results. Open-source software and Wiki projects form an even more compelling illustration.|$|E

2500|$|Numerous other {{buildings}} designed by Decimus Burton {{remain in the}} town. Prominent are the Pharos and Lower Lighthouses, opened in 1840 and still in operation. Ships sailing down the Wyre channel line up the two lights, one above the other, to guide them. The Pharos is the only functioning lighthouse in the United Kingdom built {{in the middle of}} the street. It now forms a <b>traffic</b> <b>roundabout.</b> The North Euston Hotel, opened in 1841, is still the largest hotel in Fleetwood. Queen's Terrace was completed in 1844 and is regarded as an outstanding example of classical architecture. Now mostly used for offices and private flats, at various times it has been used as a school, hospital, railway offices and wartime consulates for European nations.|$|E
2500|$|Two {{weeks later}} Macmillan gave his {{response}} to the proposals. He stated that he had decided against adopting the suggested preservation strategy, and explained that [...] "every possible way" [...] of preserving the arch had been investigated by the BTC, {{but the lack of}} available land, the operational requirements of the station and the removal costs entailed made the project infeasible. He revealed that the only place the arch could be put where it would not look [...] "incongruous" [...] was the <b>traffic</b> <b>roundabout</b> on the Euston Road, a possibility which had been considered unsuitable by the LCC. He refused to allow any further delay or to allow the Victorian Society time to raise funds, for that would delay the reconstruction of the station and involve extra expenditure of £100,000.|$|E

2500|$|The Beatles woke {{up early}} on 5 July in {{readiness}} for their flight to Delhi in India. After their requests for room service had gone unanswered, Evans {{went down to}} reception and found that all security protection inside the hotel had disappeared. The morning newspapers carried front-page stories condemning the Beatles for their failure to attend the engagement at Malacañang Palace. The tour party faced further intimidation initiated by Marcos loyalists. The Inland Revenue presented a tax bill on the band's concert earnings, which were still held by Ramos; this was despite a stipulation in NEMS' contract with Cavalcade that any such tax would be paid by the local promoter. All assistance from the hotel staff was withdrawn, as was any police escort through the city traffic, leaving Epstein to call ahead and plead with the pilot of their KLM flight to delay his takeoff. On {{the way to the}} airport, their Filipino drivers appeared to forget the route; in another example of what Aspinall termed [...] "obstacles [...] in our way", a soldier sent their cars repeatedly around the same <b>traffic</b> <b>roundabout.</b>|$|E

The analysis is suitable for inclusion in traffic assignment models which explicitly represent traffic conflicts at intersections, or in stand-alone analytically based computer programs which analyse a single roundabout. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to inform traffic {{engineers}} about the power and flexibility that VISSIM offers in analyzing <b>roundabouts.</b> Typically, <b>traffic</b> engineers use “static ” analysis software (such as aaSIDRA) to analyze the expected <b>traffic</b> operations at <b>roundabouts.</b> There are certain projects, however, where traffic simulation should be considered to assess the <b>traffic</b> operations of <b>roundabout</b> alternatives. The “static ” software packages can only analyze individual intersections as independent entities and thus ignore the system impacts of <b>roundabouts.</b> <b>Traffic</b> simulation is increasingly being used to assess traffic operations along many different types of roadway networks. From highways to arterial streets, traffic simulation enables the engineer as well as the public to visualize <b>traffic</b> operations. <b>Roundabouts,</b> however, have unique operational characteristics that some existing simulation packages do not currently model very well. VISSIM has considerable flexibility and can simulate many of these characteristics. HDR recently used VISSIM to analyze traffic operations for two very different roundabout projects.
