25|$|Economist Thomas Sowell (2001) {{argues that}} {{immigrants}} during Riis's time were typically {{willing to live}} in cramped, unpleasant circumstances as a deliberate short-term strategy that allowed them <b>to</b> <b>save</b> <b>more</b> than half their earnings to help family members come to America, with every intention of relocating to more comfortable lodgings eventually. Many tenement renters physically resisted the well-intentioned relocation efforts of reformers like Riis, states Sowell, because other lodgings were too costly {{to allow for the}} high rate of savings possible in the tenements. Moreover, according to Sowell, Riis's own personal experiences were the rule rather than the exception during his era: like most immigrants and low-income persons, he lived in the tenements only temporarily before gradually earning more income and relocating to different lodgings.|$|E

25|$|The young bishop Luka (Voino-Yasenetsky), {{a founder}} of the Tashkent {{university}} and its first professor of medicine, chief surgeon at the university and a brilliant sermonizer. He staid loyal to the Patriarch and he was first imprisoned in Tashkent in 1923, due to influence of the Renovationists who felt they could not compete with him. He was officially accused of treasonous ties to foreign agents in the Caucasus and Central Asia, and he was exiled to the distant northern-Siberian town of Eniseisk for three years. After he returned, he was arrested again in 1927 and exiled to Arkhangelsk without trial for another three years. He was loyal to Sergii. He was arrested again in 1937 and suffered his worst imprisonment in the subsequent years when he was tortured for two years (including beatings, interrogations that lasted for weeks, and food deprivation) in fruitless NKVD attempts to have him sign confessions. When this failed, he was deported to northern Siberia. In 1941 after the war broke out, his unique expertise in treating infected wounds caused the state to bring him to Krasnoyarsk and make him chief sturgeon at the main military hospital. He was honoured at a ceremony in December 1945 with a medal for service he had given to war medicine. During the service he criticized the regime for locking him for so many years and preventing him from exercising his talents <b>to</b> <b>save</b> <b>more.</b> He became archbishop of Tambov after the war. He was given the Stalin Prize in 1946 for his new and enlarged addition of his book on infected wounds; he donated the prize money to war orphans. His case was also significant because of his survival.|$|E

2500|$|In {{order to}} keep the supply of {{electricity}} consistent and to deal with varying electrical loads it is necessary to decrease the difference between generation and demand. If this is done by changing loads it is referred to as demand side management (DSM). [...] For decades, utilities have sold off-peak power to large consumers at lower rates, to encourage these users to shift their loads to off-peak hours, {{in the same way that}} telephone companies do with individual customers. [...] Usually, these time-dependent prices are negotiated ahead of time. [...] In an attempt <b>to</b> <b>save</b> <b>more</b> money, some utilities are experimenting with selling electricity at minute-by-minute spot prices, which allow those users with monitoring equipment to detect demand peaks as they happen, and shift demand to save both the user and the utility money. Demand side management can be manual or automatic and is not limited to large industrial customers. In residential and small business applications, for example, appliance control modules can reduce energy usage of water heaters, air conditioning units, refrigerators, and other devices during these periods by turning them off for some portion of the peak demand time or by reducing the power that they draw. Energy demand management includes more than reducing overall energy use or shifting loads to off-peak hours. A particularly effective method of energy demand management involves encouraging electric consumers to install more energy efficient equipment. For example, many utilities give rebates for the purchase of insulation, weatherstripping, and appliances and light bulbs that are energy efficient. Some utilities subsidize the purchase of geothermal heat pumps by their customers, to reduce electricity demand during the summer months by making air conditioning up to 70% more efficient, as well as to reduce the winter electricity demand compared to conventional air-sourced heat pumps or resistive heating. Companies with factories and large buildings can also install such products, but they can also buy energy efficient industrial equipment, like boilers, or use more efficient processes to produce products. Companies may get incentives like rebates or low interest loans from utilities or the government for the installation of energy efficient industrial equipment. Facilities may shift their demand by enlisting a third party to provide Energy Storage as a Service (ESaaS).|$|E
2500|$|When Schneersohn came to America (he was {{the first}} major Chasidic leader to move {{permanently}} to the United States) two of his chassidim came to him, and said not to start up all the activities in which Lubavitch had engaged in Europe, because [...] "America is different." [...] To avoid disappointment, they advised him not even to try. Schneersohn wrote, [...] "Out of my eyes came boiling tears", and undeterred, the next day he started the first Lubavitcher Yeshiva in America, declaring that [...] "America is no different." [...] From 1940-1945, the Rebbe created a lot of turmoil within the US Jewish community since he refused to work with Rabbi Kalmanowitz and Rabbi Kotler of the VAAD in trying to help rescue more Jews out of Hitler's Europe. Instead, he focused heavily on trying to bring about the coming of the Messia. Also, instead of putting a most of his efforts into rescuing other Jews, he placed inordinate amount of time and energy in saving his books. Historian and head of the Simon Wiesenthal Center in Israel and Orthodox Jew Efraim Zuroff asks, [...] "How can one justify expending even a small amount of resources and energies to try and save the rebbe's library {{at a time when the}} rescue of lives should have taken precedence?" [...] One wonders why no one talked about using the funds and political contacts necessary for retrieving the books <b>to</b> <b>save</b> <b>more</b> Jews, but the Lubavitchers never discussed this matter. As Zuroff writes, Lubavitchers [...] "do not consider such a set of priorities controversial or in any way problematic", for the preservation of knowledge and torah learning is one of their highest priorities. In 1949, Schneersohn became a U.S. citizen, with his son-in-law Menachem Mendel assisting to coordinate the event. A special dispensation was arranged wherein the federal judge came to [...] "770" [...] to officiate at Rabbi Yoseph Yitzchak's citizenship proceedings, rather than the Rebbe travel to a courthouse for the proceedings. Uniquely, the event was recorded on color motion film. In 1950, Schneersohn died in his home in Brooklyn and many members, even the next Rebbe Menachem Mendel Schneerson, declared him the Messiah. This caused a lot of problems for the Chabad community just like it would when Menachem Mendel Schneerson died in 1994, and many in the community declared him the Messiah. In 1951, Menachem Mendel Schneerson took over the leadership of Chabad and became the next Rebbe of Chabad. When this happened, many stopped declaring Rebbe Schneersohn the Messiah and focused on building out the community under the new Rebbe Schneerson (note: the confusion on names results from the fact that Rebbe Schneerson was the second cousin and son-in-law of Rebbe Schneersohn).|$|E
