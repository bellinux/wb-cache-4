50|$|In June 1915, a <b>timed</b> <b>relay</b> {{race from}} Chicago to Seattle {{was held on}} the Trail. The 2445 mi route was won with a best time of 97 hours. Although no deaths were {{recorded}} during the race, accidents did happen. One was in Eau Claire, Wisconsin, {{when one of the}} competitors, George Murphy, was 'speeding recklessly' at 26 mi/h km/h in his Mitchell 6, en route to Menomonie from Chippewa Falls. He skidded when coming downhill around a corner, crashing into a tree. He survived, finishing his relay segment to Menomonie in a backup car.|$|E

Each player on the team had one skill to complete before the next player could start. The goal was to complete the relay in the fastest time. The team with the fastest time in each heat scored one point, and the team with the fastest overall time scored one bonus point.|$|E

We recommend a new coordination system for <b>time</b> overcurrent <b>relays</b> too. The purpose of the coordination process is to find a time element function that allows it to operate using a constant back–up time delay, for any fault current. The results obtained from <b>time</b> overcurrent adaptive <b>relays</b> are collated, and the results from analysis of negative sequence <b>relays</b> and conventional <b>time</b> overcurrent <b>relays</b> are also presented...|$|R
