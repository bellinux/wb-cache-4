2500|$|During the 1970s, {{a number}} of issues arose which were to have {{significant}} influence on the course of the Society. The first was the tax structure in the UK: for a time, capital gains were taxed at up to 40 per cent (nil on gilts); earned income was taxed in the <b>top</b> <b>bracket</b> at 83 per cent, and investment income in the <b>top</b> <b>bracket</b> at 98 per cent. Lloyd's income counted as earned income, even for Names who did not work at Lloyd's, and this heavily influenced the direction of underwriting: in short, it was desirable for syndicates to make a (small) underwriting loss but a (larger) investment gain. The investment gain was typically achieved by [...] "bond washing" [...] or [...] "gilt stripping": selling the gilt or other bond cum dividend and buying it back ex dividend, thus forfeiting the interest income in exchange for a tax-free capital gain. Syndicate funds were also moved offshore (which later created problems through fraud and self-dealing).|$|E

40|$|We {{consider}} {{how much of}} the top end of the income distribution can be attributed to four sectors [...] top executives of non-financial firms (Main Street); financial service sector employees from investment banks, hedge funds, private equity funds, and mutual funds (Wall Street); corporate lawyers; and professional athletes and celebrities. Non-financial public company CEOs and top executives do not represent more than 6. 5 % of any of the <b>top</b> AGI <b>brackets</b> (the <b>top</b> 0. 1 %, 0. 01 %, 0. 001 %, and 0. 0001 %).

While the representation of top executives in the <b>top</b> AGI <b>brackets</b> has increased from 1994 to 2004, the representation of Wall Street has likely increased even more. While the groups we study represent {{a substantial portion of the}} top income groups, they miss a large number of high-earning individuals. We conclude by considering how our results inform different explanations for the increased skewness at the top end of the distribution. We argue the evidence is most consistent with theories of superstars, skill biased technological change, greater scale and their interaction. ...|$|R
