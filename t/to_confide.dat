For example, the larger age gap someone had, the smaller chances that they were confided by others with lower ages to [...] "discuss important matters".|$|R

5|$|As {{parliament}} {{is usually}} in recess {{during the summer}} months, Fingleton's political journalism did not often interfere with his cricket radio commentary for the ABC or his cricket writing, except during tours of England in the Australian winter. Fingleton mainly freelanced for overseas newspapers as he regarded Australian editors as being difficult to work with, and because the pay was lower. In 1946–47, England toured Australia for the first full Test series since the war. Fingleton criticised Bradman for not walking after hitting a disputed catch to Jack Ikin. Fingleton and most in the press box thought that the catch was clean but the umpire ruled in favour of Bradman. At the time Bradman had been making a comeback from ill health and had been struggling, and {{it was thought that}} he would retire if he could not discover his old form. After the dispute catch however, Bradman began timing the ball and went on to score 187. Fingleton openly criticised the decision to give Bradman not out in his writing. Later in the series, he decried Bradman's tactics of having his pacemen bowl frequent bouncers at the English batsmen, pointing out that it was hypocritical for the Australian captain to vociferously condemn Jardine's tactics years earlier. As Fingleton {{was one of the few}} who were forthright enough to question the actions of national hero Bradman, many sources within the Australian cricket community chose <b>to</b> <b>confide</b> in him, most notably all-rounder Keith Miller, whose cavalier attitude brought him into conflict with Bradman's ruthless approach to victory. The following season, during the Indian team's tour of Australia, Fingleton began his association with The Hindu.|$|E

25|$|In this book, Draco is, for {{the first}} time since being {{introduced}} in the series, portrayed as having considerable initiative, ingenuity, and perseverance. However, unlike Harry, who always relies on his friends' support and help, Draco mostly works alone in the Room of Requirement, refusing <b>to</b> <b>confide</b> in or involve his own circle of friends, whom he treats more as underlings. This, and the realisation of what he is ultimately expected to do, nearly drives him to a nervous breakdown. When Harry walks in on Malfoy crying in Moaning Myrtle's bathroom, Draco attempts to cast the Cruciatus Curse. Harry is faster to the draw with an obscure Sectumsempra spell that he learned from the mysterious Half-Blood Prince's book. The spell cuts deep gashes into Malfoy's face and chest, resulting in severe blood loss.

25|$|One {{option is}} to trade off an intact sexual {{function}} {{for the possibility of}} a prolonged life expectancy by not having curative treatment. The choice involves a trade-off so it is of central importance for the person and the physician to have access to information on established treatment benefits and side effects. A Swedish study found that the willingness {{to do this kind of}} trade-off varied considerably among men. While six out of ten were willing to consider a trade-off between life expectancy and intact sexual function, given the present knowledge of treatment benefits for clinically localized prostate cancer, four out of ten stated that they would under all circumstances choose treatment irrespective of the risk for waning sexual function. Access to valid empirical information is crucial for such decision making. Key factors here are an individual’s feeling towards the illness, their emotional values and religious beliefs. A substantial proportion of people and physicians, experience stress in judging the trade-off between different treatment options and treatment side-effects which adds to the stress of cancer diagnosed, a situation made worse in that eight out of ten people with prostate cancer have no one <b>to</b> <b>confide</b> in except their spouse and one out of five live in total emotional isolation.|$|E
