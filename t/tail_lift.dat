5000|$|The {{effect of}} angular {{velocity}} is mainly {{to decrease the}} nose lift and increase the <b>tail</b> <b>lift,</b> both of which act in a sense to oppose the rotation. [...] is therefore always negative. There is a contribution from the wing, but since missiles tend to have small static margins (typically less than a calibre), this is usually small. Also the fin contribution is {{greater than that of}} the nose, so there is a net force , but this is usually insignificant compared with [...] and is usually ignored.|$|E
5000|$|In {{some parts}} of rural Sweden, {{especially}} the sparsely populated northern inland, mail is delivered by bus. Formerly this service was handled by the postal service themselves in their own buses and livery. As Postens Diligenstrafik (lit. the Post's stagecoach traffic) between the years 1923 - 1991. In 1991 this {{became a part of}} the Swebus company. Nowadays it is handled by the local councils own public transportation buses by appointment of the postal service. Due to deregulations since the early 1990s some lines are run as public service obligations by private contractors. In addition to that there is an association of local bus companies called Bussgods which works as a courier for bulkier goods between bus stops and/or terminals. Unlike the British postbuses these vehicles are built on full-size coaches chassis with a box body and a <b>tail</b> <b>lift</b> in the rear end to accommodate heavier goods and even pallets sent along with the mail. This unusual truck/bus combination is nicknamed [...] "Skvader".|$|E
50|$|In the UK, the Ford Explorer was {{initially}} available {{as just one}} model, with the 4.0-litre engine and with a high specification - the only dealer options being leather interior. Second and third-generation Explorers for the UK and other RHD markets utilised a center console-mounted shifter and hand parking brake instead of the steering column-mounted shifter and parking brake pedal used in the North American models. In 1998, a facelifted Explorer was available with minor cosmetic interior changes and a revised rear <b>tail</b> <b>lift</b> which centered the rear number plate. In 1999 the model range was revamped slightly, the base model becoming the XLT and a special edition North Face version marketed with a tie in to North Face outdoor clothing. The North Face version was available in a dark green or a silver, with body-colored bumpers, heated leather seats and a CD multichanger as standard. In 2000, the North Face was also available in black. With {{the introduction of the}} all-new platform in 2002, Ford withdrew the Explorer from the UK market.|$|E

50|$|On 25 August 1927, {{while the}} Los Angeles was {{tethered}} at the Lakehurst high mast, {{a gust of}} wind caught her <b>tail</b> and <b>lifted</b> it into colder, denser air that was just above the airship. This caused the <b>tail</b> to <b>lift</b> higher. The crew on board tried to compensate by climbing up the keel toward the rising tail, but could not stop the ship from reaching an angle of 85 degrees, before it descended. The ship suffered only slight damage and was able to fly the next day.|$|R

50|$|The 9700 is also {{available}} as a bruck, with a large integrated cargo compartment at the rear end of the bus, sold only in Norway, Sweden and northern parts of Finland. The cargo compartment usually has a cargo door {{on the passenger side}} and a hydraulic cantilever <b>tail</b> <b>lift.</b> The size of the cargo compartment compared to the passenger section may vary by the customer's needs, and some are even fitted with a refrigerated section. In the old days this type of bus was offered by many coachbuilders in the Nordic countries, built on front- or mid-engined chassises, but for {{the last decade or so}} Volvo has had very little competition, except for a few double-deckers on Scania chassis, bodied by either Helmark Carosseri or Van Hool. However the brucks are not very common anymore, after the mid-engined B12M chassis was taken out of production in 2009. A rear-engine chassis makes worsened weight distribution and raised floor height at the rear, which results in less cargo capacity. Only a handful have been built on B12B and B11R since then. Also this type of route is not as common as it used to be, as it is considered cheaper to just buy a normal bus or minibus and have a separate cargo route. There are also fewer bus companies into cargo transport than there used to be a few years ago.|$|E
40|$|Variation with tail {{spread of}} the lift {{generated}} by a bird tail was measured on mounted, frozen European starlings (Sturnus vulgaris) in a wind tunnel at a typical air speed and body and tail angle of attack {{in order to test}} predictions of existing aerodynamic theories modelling <b>tail</b> <b>lift.</b> Measured lift at all but the lowest tail spread angles was significantly lower than the predictions of slender wing, leading edge vortex and lifting line models of lift production. Instead, the <b>tail</b> <b>lift</b> coefficient based on tail area was independent of tail spread, tail aspect ratio and maximum tail span. Theoretical models do not predict bird <b>tail</b> <b>lift</b> reliably and, when applied to tail morphology, may underestimate the aerodynamic optimum tail feather length. Flow visualization experiments reveal that an isolated tail generates leading edge vortices as expected for a low-aspect ratio delta wing, but that in the intact bird body-tail interactions are critical in determining tail aerodynamics: lifting vortices shed from the body interact with the tail and degrade <b>tail</b> <b>lift</b> compared with that of an isolated tail...|$|E
40|$|Objective: To {{comparatively}} {{evaluate the}} three most widely used ambulance stretcher loading systems; easi-loader, ramp/winch and <b>tail</b> <b>lift</b> to identify a preferred system based on safety and usability evidence. Methods: Three data types were collected in the field, the laboratory and from a national questionnaire. Field data were collected using the qualitative methods of observation (link analysis and hierarchical task analysis) and interview (critical incident technique) over 12 months during 2004 – 5. Laboratory data were collected for detailed postural analysis. A national ranking questionnaire was used to prioritise the resulting design issues. Results: The field study data were analysed, triangulated and summarised in a taxonomy to identify the design and operational issues. A list of 14 criteria was used in a national ranking exercise with 134 ambulance staff and manufacturers. Patient and operator safety was ranked as the highest priority, followed by manual handling. The postural analysis found that the easi-loader system presented the highest postural risk. Conclusions: The <b>tail</b> <b>lift</b> {{was found to be}} the preferred and safest loading system from both the field and laboratory research and is the recommended option from the evaluated loading systems.

50|$|Modern {{ambulances}} are now often custom built, {{and as well}} as {{the specialist}} medical equipment now built into the ambulances, industry wide improvements in vehicle design have had an impact, including improvements in audible and visual warning equipment to help protect crews in vulnerable situations (such as at a Road Traffic Collision), and general improvements such as ABS, which are particularly valuable for ambulances, due to the speeds reached and the weight carried. There have also been improvements to help safeguard the health and welfare of ambulance crews, such as the addition of patient <b>tail</b> <b>lifts,</b> ramps and winches, {{to cut down on the}} amount of manual handling a crew must perform.|$|R
50|$|Sonic the Hedgehog 4: Episode II is a 2D side-scrolling {{platformer}} {{reminiscent of}} the original Sonic games for the Sega Mega Drive/Genesis. It plays very similarly to the previous episode, but with several enhancements. Sonic is now accompanied by Tails, either controlled by the computer or a second player via local or online co-operative play. Unlike the earlier 16-bit titles, Tails cannot be played in single-player mode, and likewise Sonic can't be played on his own. There are also various combination moves that Sonic and Tails can perform together, such as <b>Tails</b> <b>lifting</b> Sonic up to places he {{would be unable to}} reach otherwise, or the two rolling into a ball to perform a fast and powerful spin attack.|$|R
