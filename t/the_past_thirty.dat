Our main conclusion is that it is unlikely that a single explanatory theory {{will ever be able to}} account for all of the health sector developments in any one country, let alone across many countries with diverse cultures, histories, institutions, and interest groups. Consequently, a real understanding of health sector change will require a recognition that different theoretical approaches will be more (or less) appropriate in some circumstances than in others...|$|R
