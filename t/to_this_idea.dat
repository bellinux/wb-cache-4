Pullman hoped the comfortable, beautiful environment of his town would encourage cleanliness, industriousness and sobriety in the work force. Attractive housing with adequate living space did create good work habits in the towns.|$|E
5|$|De Montfort's {{coalition}} {{began to}} quickly fragment, Henry regained his {{freedom of movement}} and renewed chaos spread across England. Henry appealed to Louis of France for arbitration in the dispute, as had been {{laid out in the}} Treaty of Kingston; de Montfort was initially hostile <b>to</b> <b>this</b> <b>idea,</b> but, as war became more likely again, he decided to agree to French arbitration as well. Henry went to Paris in person, accompanied by de Montfort's representatives. Initially de Montfort's legal arguments held sway, but in January 1264, Louis announced the Mise of Amiens, condemning the rebels, upholding the King's rights and annulling the Provisions of Oxford. Louis had strong views of his own on the rights of kings over those of barons, but was also influenced by his wife, Margaret, who was Eleanor's sister, and by the Pope. Leaving Eleanor in Paris to assemble mercenary reinforcements, Henry returned to England in February 1264, where violence was brewing in response to the unpopular French decision.|$|E

5|$|MS is {{more common}} in regions with {{northern}} European populations and the geographic variation may simply reflect the global distribution of these high-risk populations. Decreased sunlight exposure resulting in decreased vitamin D production has also been put forward as an explanation. A relationship between season of birth and MS lends support <b>to</b> <b>this</b> <b>idea,</b> with fewer people born in the northern hemisphere in November as compared to May being affected later in life. Environmental factors may play a role during childhood, with several studies finding that people who move to a different region of the world before the age of 15 acquire the new region's risk to MS. If migration takes place after age 15, however, the person retains the risk of his home country. There is some evidence that the effect of moving may still apply to people older than 15.|$|E
5|$|The book {{opens with}} a Kentucky farmer named Arthur Shelby facing {{the loss of his}} farm because of debts. Even though he and his wife Emily Shelby believe that they have a benevolent {{relationship}} with their slaves, Shelby decides to raise the needed funds by selling two of them—Uncle Tom, a middle-aged man with a wife and children, and Harry, the son of Emily Shelby's maid Eliza—to a slave trader. Emily Shelby is averse <b>to</b> <b>this</b> <b>idea</b> because she had promised her maid that her child would never be sold; Emily's son, George Shelby, hates to see Tom go because he sees the man as his friend and mentor.|$|E
5|$|The {{production}} of Dawn of Sorrow was announced on January 6, 2005 {{as the first}} Castlevania game to be released on the Nintendo DS. Longtime Castlevania producer Koji Igarashi {{was in charge of}} the production. The choice to use the Nintendo DS in favor of the Sony PlayStation Portable was due to Aria of Sorrows success on Nintendo's Game Boy Advance, and Igarashi's observations during the 2005 E3 Media and Business Summit of both consoles. Igarashi felt that the storyline with Soma Cruz and the Tactical Soul system were a waste to only use in one game, contributing to his desire to make a sequel. The original design team from Aria of Sorrow, as well as numerous new additions from Konami Tokyo, was involved in the {{production of}} Dawn of Sorrow. Igarashi intended to include a white collar Japanese worker in the game. This worker would be a manager in a Japanese firm and have a family as well. However, the development team's opposition <b>to</b> <b>this</b> <b>idea</b> forced him to drop this prospect.|$|E

5|$|It {{has been}} {{proposed}} that white dwarfs with surface temperatures of less than 10,000 kelvins could harbor a habitable zone {{at a distance of}} c. 0.005 to 0.02 AU that would last upwards of 3 billion years. The goal is to search for transits of hypothetical Earth-like planets that could have migrated inward and/or formed there. As a white dwarf has a size similar to that of a planet, these kinds of transits would produce strong eclipses. Newer research casts some doubts on this idea, given that the close orbits of those hypothetical planets around their parent stars would subject them to strong tidal forces that could render them unhabitable by triggering a greenhouse effect. Another suggested constraint <b>to</b> <b>this</b> <b>idea</b> is the origin of those planets. Leaving aside in-situ formation on an accretion disk surrounding the white dwarf, there are two ways a planet could end in a close orbit around stars of this kind: by surviving being engulfed by the star during its red giant phase, and then spiraling towards its core, or inward migration after the white dwarf has formed. The former case is implausible for low-mass bodies, as they are unlikely to survive being absorbed by their stars. In the latter case, the planets would have to expel so much orbital energy as heat, through tidal interactions with the white dwarf, that they would likely end as uninhabitable embers.|$|E

The span of possible options even included constitutional amendments; however, Roosevelt soured <b>to</b> <b>this</b> <b>idea,</b> citing the requirement of three-fourths of state legislatures needed to ratify, and that an opposition wealthy enough could too easily defeat an amendment.

25|$|Some {{aspects of}} brane physics {{have been applied}} to {{cosmology}}. For example, brane gas cosmology attempts to explain why there are three dimensions of space using topological and thermodynamic considerations. According <b>to</b> <b>this</b> <b>idea</b> it would be because three is {{the largest number of}} spatial dimensions where strings can generically intersect. If initially there are lots of windings of strings around compact dimensions, space could only expand to macroscopic sizes once these windings are eliminated, which requires oppositely wound strings to find each other and annihilate. But strings can only find each other to annihilate at a meaningful rate in three dimensions, so it follows that only three dimensions of space are allowed to grow large given this kind of initial configuration.|$|E
