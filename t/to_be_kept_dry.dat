2500|$|Some materials, notably {{high-strength}} steels, aluminium, and titanium alloys, {{are susceptible}} to hydrogen embrittlement. If the electrodes used for welding contain traces of moisture, the water decomposes {{in the heat of}} the arc and the liberated hydrogen enters the lattice of the material, causing its brittleness. Stick electrodes for such materials, with special low-hydrogen coating, are delivered in sealed moisture-proof packaging. New electrodes can be used straight from the can, but when moisture absorption may be suspected, they have to be dried by baking (usually at [...] ) in a drying oven. Flux used has <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>kept</b> <b>dry</b> as well.|$|E

30|$|Subsequent {{studies on}} dermal wound healing have {{taken into account}} the proliferating rates of {{cellular}} entities involved in wound healing. Comparing the effects of moist and dry wound conditions affecting the populations of both kinds of cells shows that the inflammatory phase cells (neutrophils and macrophages) fail to multiply rapidly in a moist wound environment.

5000|$|Hoyas {{are known}} as the “Wax Flowers” due to their [...] and almost unreal appearance. They need {{relatively}} warm and humid conditions, but depending on the specific variety of Hoya, they can endure heavy rainfall for some months during the wet seasons just as they may also <b>be</b> exposed <b>to</b> long dry periods. They are commonly used indoors. They need indirect light, but the amount or required light depends on the variety. They need small amounts of water and the soil <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>kept</b> slightly <b>dry</b> since a very wet soil can end up killing this kind of plant. They can be grown in pots that are not too big or in hanging baskets. They grow better if kept at a minimum temperature of 15 degree Celsius (59 Fahrenheit).|$|R

5000|$|A thangka, {{variously}} spelt as tangka, thanka or tanka ( [...] ; Nepal Bhasa: पौभा), is a Tibetan Buddhist {{painting on}} cotton, or silk appliqué, usually depicting a Buddhist deity, scene, or mandala. Thangkas <b>are</b> traditionally <b>kept</b> unframed and rolled up when not on display, {{mounted on a}} textile backing somewhat {{in the style of}} Chinese scroll paintings, with a further silk cover on the front. So treated, thangkas can last a long time, but because of their delicate nature, they have <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>kept</b> in <b>dry</b> places where moisture will not affect the quality of the silk. Most thankas are relatively small, comparable in size to a Western half-length portrait, but some are extremely large, several metres in each dimension; these <b>were</b> designed <b>to</b> <b>be</b> displayed, typically for very brief periods on a monastery wall, as part of religious festivals. Most thankas were intended for personal meditation or instruction of monastic students. They often have elaborate compositions including many very small figures. A central deity is often surrounded by other identified figures in a symmetrical composition. Narrative scenes are less common, but do appear.|$|R
