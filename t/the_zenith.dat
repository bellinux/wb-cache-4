5|$|Resonance of Fate {{takes place}} on Earth in the distant future. The levels of {{pollution}} in the atmosphere trigger massive environmental changes, making the world hostile to human life. On the brink of extinction, humanity creates Basel, a giant air purification module controlled by <b>the</b> <b>Zenith</b> System. As conditions worsened in the land surrounding Basel, the remnants of humanity gathered around it and built a great city {{at the base of}} Zenith's tower. While Basel and <b>the</b> <b>Zenith</b> System control the surrounding environment to make it habitable for humans, it also controls the human population: each person has their social status determined at birth, and their exact lifespan is controlled through quartz crystals programmed by Zenith. Basel evolves for countless years into a class-driven society, the populace forgets everything about Basel's past: those {{at the top of the}} tower are the city's leaders, dubbed Cardinals, and indoctrinate the people into a religion deifying <b>the</b> <b>Zenith</b> System.|$|E
5|$|The Front Mission {{series has}} spawned a number of action figures and model kits. In 1997, {{with the release of}} Front Mission 2, Kotobukiya {{released}} three resin kits depicting certain wanzers (mecha) from the game, such as <b>the</b> <b>Zenith</b> V. In 1999, Kotobukiya's ARTFX team produced a line of six-inch action figures depicting wanzers seen in Front Mission 3 such as <b>the</b> <b>Zenith</b> RV. Toy distributor Palisades released these figures In North America in 2000, and they were later reissued in different colors.|$|E

5|$|By {{the time}} Vashyron and his comrades learn the full tale from Juris, Rowen {{is in the}} midst of a crisis of faith due to his control over <b>the</b> <b>Zenith</b> System through his ring. During the party's {{confrontation}} with Sullivan where he threatens to destroy Leanne's quartz, Rowen shoots Sullivan to try and prove the existence of a higher power through Leanne's survival. The three then confront Rowen directly and fatally wound him, but Rowen's control of <b>the</b> <b>Zenith</b> System preserves his life. Vashyron calls Zephyr and Leanne off, seeing further fighting is pointless. During the game's credits, Rowen uses his power to resurrect the Cardinals, then leaves the control ring on Frieda's grave, and Sullivan is seen reuniting with Rebecca. In a post-credit scene, Leanne, Zephyr and Vashyron explore the now-clean world beyond Basel, and Leanne's quartz is revealed to have been safely embedded in her hand.|$|E
5|$|Observatories were {{constructed}} {{to the north}} and south of the mountain, plus a bothy to accommodate equipment and the scientists. Most of the workforce was however housed in rough canvas tents. Maskelyne's astronomical measurements were the first to be conducted. It was necessary for him to determine <b>the</b> <b>zenith</b> distances with respect to the plumb line for a set of stars at the precise time that each passed due south. Weather conditions were frequently unfavourable due to mist and rain. However, from the south observatory, he was able to take 76 measurements on 34 stars in one direction, and then 93 observations on 39 stars in the other. From the north side, he then conducted a set of 68 observations on 32 stars and a set of 100 on 37 stars. By conducting sets of measurements with the plane of <b>the</b> <b>zenith</b> sector first facing east and then west, he successfully avoided any systematic errors arising from collimating the sector.|$|E

5|$|The {{most famous}} {{project of the}} Mycenaean era was the network of roads in the Peloponnese. This appears to have {{facilitated}} the speedy deployment of troops—for example, {{the remnants of a}} Mycenaean road, along with what {{appears to have been a}} Mycenaean defensive wall on the Isthmus of Corinth. The Mycenaean era saw <b>the</b> <b>zenith</b> of infrastructure engineering in Greece, and this appears not to have been limited to the Argive plain.|$|E
5|$|The {{telescope}} {{was able to}} map a ± 15-degree strip around <b>the</b> <b>zenith</b> at 72 and 160MHz, with a resolution at 160MHz of 1 degree.

50|$|The {{next season}} <b>the</b> <b>Zeniths</b> were again <b>the</b> {{class of the}} league but this time they only won the {{division}} over the Knights by one and half games and they lost a hard fought finals rematch with the Knights in seven games. For this season, <b>the</b> <b>Zeniths</b> were coached by co-owner and nightclub proprietor Art Stock who bought {{a stake in the}} team after his Jersey Shore Bullets folded the previous season. Mauro Panaggio moved to the front office as General Manager, but resumed his duties as head coach for the 1980-81 season until the demise of the team in 1983.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> Rochester <b>Zeniths</b> were {{organized}} {{in the fall of}} 1977 to play professional basketball in the newly formed All-American Basketball Alliance. They were owned by Dick Hill who owned Hill TV, a Rochester electronics store that sold Zenith brand televisions, hence <b>the</b> nickname <b>Zeniths</b> (for <b>the</b> first year they were known as the Rochester Hills). The team began play in January 1978 {{along with the rest of}} the All-American Alliance, but the league folded within a month. <b>The</b> <b>Zeniths</b> played 11 games and finished with a 10-1 record. Attendance at home games at the War Memorial was by far the best in the league.|$|R
5|$|Because Uranus orbits the Sun {{almost on}} its side, and its moons orbit in the planet's {{equatorial}} plane, they (including Oberon) {{are subject to}} an extreme seasonal cycle. Both northern and southern poles spend 42 years in a complete darkness, and another 42 years in continuous sunlight, with the sun rising close to <b>the</b> <b>zenith</b> {{over one of the}} poles at each solstice. The Voyager 2 flyby coincided with the southern hemisphere's 1986 summer solstice, when nearly the entire northern hemisphere was in darkness. Once every 42 years, when Uranus has an equinox and its equatorial plane intersects the Earth, mutual occultations of Uranus's moons become possible. One such event, which lasted for about six minutes, was observed on May 4, 2007, when Oberon occulted Umbriel.|$|E
5|$|Churchill's role in {{defeating}} the Monmouth Rebellion in 1685 helped secure James on the throne, yet {{just three years}} later he abandoned his Catholic patron for the Protestant Dutchman, William of Orange. Honoured for his services at William's coronation with the earldom of Marlborough, he served with further distinction {{in the early years}} of the Nine Years' War, but persistent charges of Jacobitism brought about his fall from office and temporary imprisonment in the Tower. It was not until the accession of Queen Anne in 1702 that Marlborough reached <b>the</b> <b>zenith</b> of his powers and secured his fame and fortune.|$|E
5|$|In 1933, Truman {{was named}} Missouri's {{director}} for the Federal Re-Employment program (part of the Civil Works Administration) {{at the request of}} Postmaster General James Farley. This was payback to Pendergast for delivering the Kansas City vote to Franklin D. Roosevelt in the 1932 presidential election. The appointment confirmed Pendergast's control over federal patronage jobs in Missouri and marked <b>the</b> <b>zenith</b> of his power. It also created a relationship between Truman and Roosevelt aide Harry Hopkins and assured Truman's avid support for the New Deal.|$|E

30|$|Mechanisms {{have been}} {{proposed}} to explain the increased optical emission intensities in <b>the</b> magnetic <b>zenith.</b> Gurevich et al. ([2001]) showed that the HF pump wave can self-focus on bunches of striations and be ducted to higher altitude in <b>the</b> magnetic <b>zenith.</b> Kosch et al. ([2007 b]) showed that the pump beam forms a large-scale density depletion generating a reflective concave HF mirror which focuses the pump wave energy into a small region when pumping in <b>the</b> magnetic <b>zenith.</b> However, our understanding remains incomplete.|$|R

5|$|Kumbakonam was {{eventually}} ceded to the British East India Company in 1799 by the Thanjavur Maratha ruler Serfoji II (1777 -1832) and reached <b>the</b> <b>zenith</b> of its prosperity {{in the late}} 19th and early 20th century when it emerged as an important center of Brahminism, Hindu religion and European education in the Madras Presidency. The opening of the Suez Canal in 1869 fostered trade contacts with the United Kingdom. In 1877, railway lines were completed linking Kumbakonam with the ports of Madras, Tuticorin and Nagapattinam. The Tanjore district court was established in Kumbakonam in 1806 and functioned from 1806 to 1863.|$|E
5|$|The Byzantine naval {{predominance}} {{lasted until}} the early 9th century, when a succession of disasters {{at the hands of}} the resurgent Muslim fleets spelled its end and inaugurated an era that would represent <b>the</b> <b>zenith</b> of Muslim ascendancy. Already in 790, the Byzantines suffered a major defeat in the Gulf of Antalya, and raids against Cyprus and Crete recommenced during the reign of Harun al-Rashid (786–809). Around the Mediterranean, new powers were rising, foremost amongst them the Carolingian Empire, while in 803, the Pax Nicephori recognized the de facto independence of Byzantine Venice, which was further entrenched by the repulsion of a Byzantine attack in 809. At the same time, in Ifriqiya, the new Aghlabid dynasty was established, which immediately engaged in raids throughout the central Mediterranean.|$|E
5|$|The Cold War {{continues}} to influence world affairs. The post-Cold War world {{is considered to}} be unipolar, with the United States the sole remaining superpower. The Cold War defined the political role of the United States after World WarII—by 1989 the United States had military alliances with 50 countries, with 526,000 troops stationed abroad, with 326,000 in Europe (two-thirds of which in west Germany) and 130,000 in Asia (mainly Japan and South Korea). The Cold War also marked <b>the</b> <b>zenith</b> of peacetime military–industrial complexes, especially in the United States, and large-scale military funding of science. These complexes, though their origins may be found as early as the 19th century, snowballed considerably during the Cold War.|$|E

5|$|The {{telescope}} moved for {{the first}} time on 3 February 1957: by an inch. It was first moved azimuthally under power on 12 June 1957; the bowl was tilted under power {{for the first}} time on 20 June 1957. By the end of July the dish surface was completed, and first light was on 2 August 1957; the telescope did a drift scan across the Milky Way at 160MHz, with the bowl at <b>the</b> <b>zenith.</b> The telescope was first controlled from the control room on 9 October 1957, by a purpose-built analogue computer.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>zenith</b> of B-52 {{attacks in}} Vietnam was Operation Linebacker II (sometimes {{referred}} to as the Christmas Bombing), conducted from 18 to 29 December 1972, which consisted of waves of B-52s (mostly D models, but some Gs without jamming equipment and with a smaller bomb load). Over 12 days, B-52s flew 729 sorties and dropped 15,237tons of bombs on Hanoi, Haiphong, and other targets. Originally 42 B-52s were committed to the war; however, numbers were frequently twice this figure. During Operation Linebacker II, fifteen B-52s were shot down, five were heavily damaged (one crashed in Laos), and five suffered medium damage. A total of 25 crew men were killed in these losses. North Vietnam claimed 34 B-52s were shot down.|$|E
5|$|The Červená hora {{image was}} {{especially}} valuable. It recorded the fireball's trajectory over approximately 110°, starting 51° above the southern horizon, passing <b>the</b> <b>zenith</b> just 1° westward and disappearing only 19° above the northern horizon (thus crossing about 60% of the sky). Its camera was also {{equipped with a}} rotating shutter that interrupted the exposure 12.5 times per second and divided the captured track of the fireball, allowing the determination of its speed. Over the last 4°, the fireball's angular velocity was lower than {{the resolution of the}} instrument. The Svratouch image recorded the trajectory only for about 15°, beginning at 30° above the northwest horizon, and the pictured fireball was quite weak. Despite this, the data were sufficient for the calculations.|$|E
50|$|Atmospheric {{refraction}} causes {{light to}} follow an approximately circularpath that is slightly {{longer than the}} geometric path, and the air mass musttake into account the longer path (Young 1994).Additionally, refraction causes a celestial body to appear higher above thehorizon than it actually is; at the horizon, the difference between thetrue <b>zenith</b> angle and <b>the</b> apparent <b>zenith</b> angle is approximately 34 minutesof arc. Most air mass formulas are based on <b>the</b> apparent <b>zenith</b> angle, butsome are based on <b>the</b> true <b>zenith</b> angle, so {{it is important to}} ensure thatthe correct value is used, especially near the horizon.|$|R
