25|$|Despite the Worcester v.

The harsh treatment the Cherokee received at the hands of white settlers caused some to enroll to emigrate west. As some Cherokees were slaveholders, they took enslaved African-Americans with them west of the Mississippi. Intermarried European-Americans and missionaries also walked the Trail of Tears.|$|E
25|$|Spock {{advocated}} {{ideas about}} parenting that were, at the time, considered {{out of the}} mainstream. Over time, his books helped to bring about major change. Previously, experts had told parents that babies needed to learn to sleep on a regular schedule, and that picking them up and holding them whenever <b>they</b> <b>cried</b> would only teach them to cry more and not to {{sleep through the night}} (a notion that borrows from behaviorism). They were told to feed their children on a regular schedule, and that they should not pick them up, kiss them, or hug them, because that would not prepare them to be strong and independent individuals in a harsh world. In contrast Spock encouraged parents to see their children as individuals, and not to apply a one-size-fits all philosophy to them.|$|E

Joseph told them to circumcise {{themselves}} first. <b>They</b> <b>cried</b> out to Pharaoh, as [...] reports, and Pharaoh told {{them to go to}} Joseph. The people complained that Joseph asked them to circumcise themselves, and they complained that it was not fitting for a Hebrew to wield power over Egyptians. Calling them fools, Pharaoh recalled that during the years of plenty, a herald had continually proclaimed that a famine was coming, and asked why they had not saved grain in reserve. The people replied that all the grain that they had left had rotted. Pharaoh asked them whether any flour was left from the day before. The people replied that even the bread in their baskets had gone moldy. Pharaoh answered that if grain rotted at Joseph's decree, perhaps he might decree that the Egyptians die! So Pharaoh directed them to go to Joseph and obey him, even if he told them to cut off something of their flesh.|$|E

[...] "Don Frederic de Toledo is coming upon us", <b>they</b> <b>cried.</b> The Spanish cavalry of Philip of Noircarmes, without delay, charged against the French army, followed by infantry, while the rear was protected by the cavalry of Don Bernardino de Mendoza. The attack caused panic among the French Huguenots, and then, the Spanish infantry shattered the French army. The Spanish victory was complete, and the army of Genlis was entirely routed. About 2,000 French soldiers were killed or wounded, and 700 captured, including 70 nobles and officers (in the following days, more than 4,000 were captured).

2500|$|Some of the {{contemporary}} critics of Haussmann softened their views over time. [...] Jules Simon was an ardent republican who had refused {{to take an oath}} to Napoelon III, and had been a fierce critic of Haussmann in the parliament. [...] But in 1882, he wrote of Haussmann in the Gaulois: [...] "He tried to make Paris a magnificent city, and he succeeded completely. [...] When he took Paris in hand and managed our affairs, rue Saint-Honore and rue Saint-Antoine were still the largest streets in the city. [...] We had no other promenades than the Grands Boulevards and the Tuileries; the Champs-Élysées was most of the time a sewer; [...] the Bois-de-Boulogne {{was at the end of}} the world. [...] We were lacking water, markets, light, in those far-off times, which are only thirty years past. [...] He demolished neighbourhoods- one could say, entire cities. [...] <b>They</b> <b>cried</b> that he would create a plague; [...] he let us cry and, on the contrary, through his intelligent piercing of streets, he gave us air, health and life. [...] Here he created a street; [...] there he created an avenue or a boulevard; [...] here a Place, a Square; a Promenade. Out of emptiness he made the Champs-Élysées, the Bois de Boulogne, de the Bois de Vincennes. He introduced, into his beautiful capital, trees and flowers, and populated it with statues." ...|$|E
