5|$|Ramirez {{attended}} George Washington High School from 1987 to 1991, leaving {{at the age}} of 19 without graduating. During {{his time}} on the team, GWHS was seeing a large {{increase in the number of}} immigrants. This was apparent, as GWHS's baseball team was composed entirely of Dominicans. As a youth, Ramirez preferred to not be <b>the</b> <b>center</b> <b>of</b> <b>attention</b> and was often very modest.|$|E
5|$|Pomeranians are {{typically}} friendly, playful and lively; {{but they can}} be aggressive with other dogs to try to prove themselves. Pomeranians are alert and aware of changes in their environment, and barking at new stimuli can develop into a habit of barking excessively in any situation. They are somewhat defensive of their territory and thus may bark when they hear outside noises. Pomeranians are intelligent, respond well to training, and can be very successful in getting what they want from their owners. They are extroverted and enjoy being <b>the</b> <b>center</b> <b>of</b> <b>attention,</b> {{but they can be}}come dominant if not well trained and socialized. The use of toys can be an effective tool in training Pomeranians to spend time alone.|$|E
5|$|Mamie Till Bradley and Emmett lived {{together}} in a busy neighborhood in Chicago's South Side, near distant relatives. She began working as a civilian clerk for the U.S. Air Force for a better salary. She recalled that Emmett was industrious enough to help with chores at home, although he sometimes got distracted. His mother remembered {{that he did not}} know his own limitations at times. Following the couple's separation, Bradley visited Mamie and began threatening her. At eleven years old, Emmett, with a butcher knife in hand, told Bradley he would kill him if the man did not leave. Usually, however, Emmett was happy. He and his cousins and friends pulled pranks on each other (Emmett once took advantage of an extended car ride when his friend fell asleep and placed the friend's underwear on his head), and they also spent their free time in pickup baseball games. He was a natty dresser and was often <b>the</b> <b>center</b> <b>of</b> <b>attention</b> among his peers.|$|E

50|$|In 2001-02, the make-up and {{direction}} of the Chicago Bulls changed significantly: by the season’s end, a pair of 18-year-old phenoms and an All-Star caliber player were in the line-up while Elton Brand, once thought to be the franchise’s cornerstone for rebuilding efforts, was not. The result was a renewed sense of optimism and hope surrounding the team’s future with Tyson Chandler, Eddy Curry and Jalen Rose as <b>the</b> <b>centers</b> <b>of</b> <b>attention.</b>|$|R

25|$|Toot Braunstein (voiced by Tara Strong): An {{overweight}} alcoholic retro-style {{sex symbol}} from black-and-white 1920s cartoons, reminiscent of Betty Boop. Toot demands to be <b>the</b> <b>center</b> <b>of</b> <b>attention,</b> cuts herself with razor blades, eats excessively when depressed and often instigates {{conflict in the}} house.|$|E

25|$|Brooks asked Glazier {{to go to}} Hollywood to work {{on further}} films, but with his {{marriage}} breaking up he demurred, preferring to remain in New York {{to be close to}} his daughter. He continued a savvy business career - for example he invested in the doctor who discovered Viagra - and maintained generous friendships with many, in which he disliked being <b>the</b> <b>center</b> <b>of</b> <b>attention.</b>|$|E

25|$|The Rigveda is {{far more}} archaic than any other Indo-Aryan text. For this reason, it was in <b>the</b> <b>center</b> <b>of</b> <b>attention</b> of western {{scholarship}} from the times of Max Müller and Rudolf Roth onwards. The Rigveda records {{an early stage of}} Vedic religion. There are strong linguistic and cultural similarities with the early Iranian Avesta, deriving from the Proto-Indo-Iranian times, often associated with the early Andronovo culture (or rather, the Sintashta culture within the early Andronovo horizon) of c. 2000 BC.|$|E
25|$|After {{seven years}} of brutal war, both sides in this {{conflict}} were suffering from weariness of the war. Although tentative peace initiatives had been put forward, neither side was yet willing to make meaningful concessions. The capture of Bergen op Zoom would be a signal defeat for the Dutch and would {{open the door for}} an invasion of the Dutch Netherlands. The siege was <b>the</b> <b>center</b> <b>of</b> <b>attention</b> in Europe and news of it followed eagerly in numerous reports with the Pragmatic allies confident that the fortress would withstand the French and the French determined it should fall.|$|E
25|$|The Curtain Rises, {{which ran}} from October to December 1933, was Arthur's first Broadway play {{in which she}} was <b>the</b> <b>center</b> <b>of</b> <b>attention.</b> With an {{improved}} résumé, she returned to Hollywood in late 1933, and turned down several contract offers until she was asked to meet with an executive from Columbia Pictures. Arthur agreed to star in a film, Whirlpool (1934), and during production she was offered a long-term contract that promised financial stability for both her and her parents. Even though hesitant to give up her stage career, Arthur signed the five-year contract on February 14, 1934.|$|E

25|$|Former Maccabi Tel Aviv Manager Avram Grant was {{appointed}} in 2000 {{as manager of}} Maccabi Haifa. Under Grant's guidance, the team regained its dominating offensive style. Grant, along with a much improved squad, led the club with an almost unstoppable team, winning the championship. At <b>the</b> <b>center</b> <b>of</b> <b>attention</b> were a series of virtuoso performances by Yossi Benayoun, including what some consider to be several of the finest goals in Israeli league history. A spontaneous burst of celebrating fans onto the pitch caused a tragic disaster. A young fan, Amir Rand, was crushed against the guarding rails and left comatose.|$|E
25|$|The {{dominant}} silverback generally {{determines the}} movements of the group, leading it to appropriate feeding sites throughout the year. He also mediates conflicts within the group and protects it from external threats. When the group is attacked by humans, leopards, or other gorillas, the silverback will protect them even at the cost of his own life. He is <b>the</b> <b>center</b> <b>of</b> <b>attention</b> during rest sessions, and young gorillas frequently stay close to him and include him in their games. If a mother dies or leaves the group, the silverback is usually the one who looks after her abandoned offspring, even allowing them to sleep in his nest. Experienced silverbacks are capable of removing poachers' snares from the hands or feet of their group members.|$|E
25|$|During {{the month}} of July 1882, Ponce was <b>the</b> <b>center</b> <b>of</b> <b>attention</b> in Puerto Rico, as an {{important}} Exhibition Trade Fair was being celebrated. The main exhibit pavilion, dedicated to agricultural and industrial exhibits, was commissioned to Maximo Meana, Lieutenant Colonel of the Spanish Militia, and later, Mayor of the city. The Moorish influence is manifested immediately for its basic rectangular plan with towers at its front corners: the active facade ornamentation, its long and narrow windows with fans at its top, its bright colorful paint application, among others, typifies a strong Moorish influence. In 1885, the building was dedicated as Ponce's official firehouse. In 1920, it was used briefly as the Mayor's office {{as a result of}} the earthquake that affected the city during that year.|$|E
50|$|On September 1, 2014 Trabzonspor {{has landed}} the former Greek {{international}} Avraam Papadopoulos from Olympiakos.

25|$|This was {{the second}} time trial stage, with long {{straight}} stretches, some beautiful sections of unbending road and some slight inclines (with one located about 600 m to the finish line). It was clear that time-trial specialists would be <b>the</b> <b>center</b> <b>of</b> <b>attention.</b> After an impressive performance during the Pyrenees crossing and the capture of the yellow jersey due to Michael Rasmussen's dismissal, Alberto Contador expressed his concerns about being beaten in the final time trial of the competition. Before the riders located above the 20th place started, Belgian Leif Hoste set a time of 1h 05' 32", making him the 1st ranked rider of the stage {{for a long period of}} time. Nonetheless, with the start of the favourites for the stage, he gradually went down through the standings, finishing in 9th position. David Millar, who was expected to be a contender for victory, experienced mechanical trouble, needing to change bikes twice within the first kilometer.|$|E
25|$|LeRon Ellis made local {{headlines}} at {{the start}} of his sophomore year when he became the first African American inducted into the University of Kentucky's Kappa Alpha fraternity. Ellis was also <b>the</b> <b>center</b> <b>of</b> <b>attention</b> on the court as many of Kentucky's high-profile basketball players were unable to play in the 1988-89 season. Offensive and defensive stars Ed Davender, Robert Lock and Winston Bennett graduated from school; the Wildcats' MVP Rex Chapman left school early to enter the 1988 NBA Draft; sophomore standout Eric Manuel was suspended for the entire season from playing basketball and potential franchise recruit Shawn Kemp was transferred out of the university {{before the start of the}} season. Kentucky's basketball program was essentially put into the hands of the unexperienced sophomore LeRon Ellis and freshman Chris Mills. The two underclassmen struggled to fill the talent vacuum on the court and even prior to the season many had predicted rough times ahead for the Wildcats' 198889 season.|$|E
25|$|On her sixth voyage, {{the most}} {{important}} stop of Suomen Joutsen was New York City, where the ship arrived on 3 March 1937. Prior to this, the ship had visited Portugal, Senegal {{and a number of}} ports in the Caribbean after leaving Helsinki on 2 November 1936. However, the ship's first and only visit to the United States under the Finnish flag was an important milestone and a major media event. When the ship was sailing up the Hudson River, an American film crew came on board to capture her arrival, and Suomen Joutsen remained <b>the</b> <b>center</b> <b>of</b> <b>attention</b> for the six days she was moored at the western end of the 35th Street. When the ship left New York, a member of the crew was accidentally left on the shore. However, he managed to talk a local tugboat captain to take him back to the school ship and, for solving the problem on his own initiative, was left without punishment. After stopping at Oslo, Suomen Joutsen arrived in Helsinki on the May Day of 1936. Among the first people to leave the ship was a man carrying a living crocodile under his arm, captured for the Helsinki Zoo.|$|E
25|$|In February 1985, Moskva became <b>the</b> <b>center</b> <b>of</b> {{international}} <b>attention</b> when {{a herd of}} beluga whales {{was trapped}} by ice near the Chukchi Peninsula in the Soviet Far East. The icebreaker broke a channel through the ice pack and managed to lead about 2,000 whales to the open sea.|$|R
5000|$|In May 2013, the {{district}} was <b>the</b> <b>center</b> <b>of</b> worldwide <b>attention,</b> due to riots that spread to several {{other parts of}} Stockholm.

50|$|Silver {{was found}} in Argenta in 1866, a small camp was built and a little town established. Argenta became in a {{shipping}} point for Austin, Nevada, and its residents had the hope that Austin would help make Argenta <b>the</b> railroad <b>center</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Lander County.Unhappily, <b>the</b> <b>center</b> <b>of</b> <b>attentions</b> in Austin was Battle Mountain, Nevada, which was closer {{to the city and}} nearer Galena. People of Argenta understood that the future of the town was bedeviled. In December 1870, they moved everything and themselves to Battle Mountain, and Argenta became a ghost town. There was no activity in Argenta until 1930 when barite was discovered in Argenta Mountain. From 1930 and 1969 over $3 million in barite was produced. The mine was active until 2015, when it was closed by its owner Baker Hughes.|$|R
25|$|Starting {{around the}} second {{third of the}} 6th century BC, Attic artists became {{interested}} in mythological scenes and other representations of figures. Animal friezes became less important. Only a few painters took care with them, and they were generally moved from <b>the</b> <b>center</b> <b>of</b> <b>attention</b> to less important areas of vases. This new style is especially represented by the François vase, signed by both the potter Ergotimos and the painter Kleitias (570–560 BC). This krater {{is considered to be}} the most famous Greek painted vase. It is the first known volute krater made of clay. Mythological events are depicted in several friezes, with animal friezes being shown in secondary locations. Several iconographic and technical details appear on this vase for the first time. Many are unique, such as the representation of a lowered mast of a sailing ship; others became part of the standard repertoire, such as people sitting with one leg behind the other, instead of with the traditional parallel positioning of the legs. Four other, smaller vases were signed by Ergotimos and Kleitias, and additional vases and fragments are attributed to them. They provide evidence for other innovations by Kleitias, like the first depiction of the birth of Athena or of the Dance on Crete.|$|E
500|$|Eva is <b>the</b> <b>center</b> <b>of</b> <b>attention</b> [...] but {{the lyric}} {{does not allow}} a {{transfer}} of meaning outside of the context of her story. Part of the song's popularity lies {{in the way it}} finds an image—the suitcase in the hall—to express the nomadic nature of modern civilization, the feeling of urban rootlessness that many people experience. The theme of constant moving strikes a resonant note.|$|E
500|$|Members of {{the breed}} enjoy being <b>the</b> <b>center</b> <b>of</b> <b>attention,</b> {{and can be}} quite vocal at times. It is a one family dog, and will often bond with one {{particular}} individual. For many years the breed was [...] "pack bred", where {{they were allowed to}} live in a group. Since these times, breeders have been working to breed even tempered dogs that are suitable for both hunting and family life.|$|E
50|$|During the 2015 European migrant crisis Hennala {{was turned}} into an {{immigrant}} reception center.

50|$|After {{working as}} a {{character}} actress/comedian in supporting roles or in guest shots on television series and specials, The Facts Of Life gave Rae not only her best-known role but it finally made her a television star.
