25|$|Recently, {{the enzyme}} {{responsible}} for the backbone cyclization of cyclotides has been isolated from the medicinal plant Clitoria ternatea. This enzyme was named butelase 1 in accordance to the local name of the plant (Bunga Telang Ligase). Butelase 1 {{has been shown to}} cyclize the linear precursor of kalata B1 with >95% yield at a remarkable rate of 5.42×105 M1 s1. The ligase also cyclizes various bioactive peptides of animal origin, such as human antimicrobial peptide histatin, conotoxin from cone snail and insect antimicrobial peptide <b>thanatin.</b>|$|E
40|$|<b>Thanatin</b> is an {{antimicrobial}} peptide with {{a strong}} and wide-ranging antimicrobial spectrum, including certain species of fungi and Gram-negative and -positive bacteria. To evaluate the application of <b>thanatin</b> to the generation of disease-resistant plants, we introduced a synthetic <b>thanatin</b> gene into rice. Several transformants that expressed the introduced gene showed significant level of antimicrobial activity. The substances showing antimicrobial activity were partially purified from these transformants and their properties were determined. The molecule with characteristics {{similar to those of}} native <b>thanatin</b> on the elution pattern in HPLC analysis had an identical molecular mass to that of native molecule. It {{should also be noted that}} the transformant acquired a sufficient level of resistance to the rice blast fungus, Magnaporthe oryzae, presumably due to the repressive activity of <b>thanatin</b> to its initial stage of infection. This result demonstrates that <b>thanatin</b> has antifungal activity for M. oryzae and that the introduction of the <b>thanatin</b> gene into rice is effective in generating a plant resistant to rice blast disease...|$|E
30|$|Among {{different}} Amps, a recombinant <b>thanatin</b> {{has been}} synthetized and evaluated in this study. <b>Thanatin</b> was originated from the {{spined soldier bug}} (Podisus maculiventris). It is the first inducible insect peptide with {{a broad range of}} activity against bacteria and fungi at physiological concentrations. <b>Thanatin</b> contains two amino acids including two cysteine residues that form a disulfide bridge (Mandard et al. 1998). So far, several studies have been performed on this peptide. For example, the transgenic rice encoded <b>thanatin</b> was resistant to blast disease in field evaluations (Imamura et al. 2010). Another study showed that the transgenic Arabidopsis encoded <b>thanatin</b> was resistant to the fungal and bacterial pathogens (Wu et al. 2013).|$|E
30|$|Cultivation of {{transfected}} HEK 293 {{cells and}} expression of recombinant <b>thanatin</b> were successfully accomplished. A 2.34  kDa band {{corresponding to the}} size of <b>thanatin</b> and industrial <b>thanatin</b> was observed on the SDS-PAGE, confirming that the peptide was properly expressed in the host cells and secreted into medium (Fig.  1) as documented by Fehlbaum et al. (1996) and Koch et al. (2012). The pcDNA 3.1 + vector without <b>thanatin</b> encoding sequence was transfected into HEK 293 cell as a negative control and the total secretion protein of this cell was run alongside the transfected sample carrying <b>thanatin</b> coding sequence. As observed there was no band with such a size in the control sample.|$|E
30|$|The results {{obtained}} from <b>thanatin</b> antifungal activity test showed that, similar to plant extracts and chemical mixture, by increasing of <b>thanatin</b> concentration, {{the rate of}} fungal inhibition will also be increased (Fig.  6). Interestingly, the applied concentrations of <b>thanatin</b> are not comparable with other three treatments. The highest and lowest inhibition rates were observed in the fungi B. cinerea and G. candidum, respectively (Fig.  3 D).|$|E
30|$|In this study, HEK 293 {{transfected}} in our pervious study (Tanhaeian et al. 2018) {{was used}} for the synthesis and release of recombinant <b>thanatin</b> into medium. In order to demonstrate the effectiveness of recombinant <b>thanatin</b> against fungal plant pathogens, it is necessary to compare the efficacy of this recombinant peptide with other materials having antifungal activity. For this reason, we have compared the efficacy of two plant extracts and a chemical mixture along with recombinant <b>thanatin</b> against five fungal plant pathogens. The results indicated that, all treatments have shown antifungal activity against tested fungi. Amongst all treatments, <b>thanatin</b> showed a good antifungal activity even by its application at µg level under in vitro and in vivo condition.|$|E
30|$|The {{predicted}} {{secondary structure}} of <b>thanatin</b> was: ccccceeeeeecccccccccc.|$|E
40|$|Aflatoxin-producing fungi can {{contaminate}} {{plants and}} plant-derived products with carcinogenic secondary metabolites that present {{a risk to}} human and animal health. In this study, we investigated the effect of antimicrobial peptides on the major aflatoxigenic fungi Aspergillus flavus and A. parasiticus. In vitro assays with different chemically-synthesized peptides demonstrated that the broad-spectrum peptide <b>thanatin</b> from the spined soldier bug (Podisus maculiventris) had the greatest potential to eliminate aflatoxigenic fungi. The minimal inhibitory concentrations of <b>thanatin</b> against A. flavus and A. parasiticus were 3. 13 and 12. 5 µM, respectively. A <b>thanatin</b> cDNA was subsequently cloned in a plant expression vector {{under the control of}} the ubiquitin- 1 promoter allowing the recombinant peptide to be directed to the apoplast in transgenic maize plants. Successful integration of the <b>thanatin</b> expression cassette was confirmed by PCR and expression was demonstrated by semi-quantitative RT-PCR in transgenic maize kernels. Infection assays with maize kernels from T 1 transgenic plants showed up to three-fold greater resistance against Aspergillus spp. infections compared to non-transgenic kernels. We demonstrated for the first time that heterologous expression of the antimicrobial peptide <b>thanatin</b> inhibits the growth of Aspergillus spp. in transgenic maize plants offering a solution to protect crops from aflatoxin-producing fungi and the resulting aflatoxin contamination in the field and under storage conditions...|$|E
30|$|In {{the present}} study, the hybrid peptide was {{designed}} by using melittin’s C-terminal 15 -amino acid mutant (with weak hemolytic activity) (Li et al. 2003) as the N-terminus and <b>thanatin</b> as the C-terminus. Based on the secondary structure prediction by using the GRO method, the secondary structure of the hybrid peptide’s C-terminus was not changed compared with <b>thanatin.</b> However, the N-terminus showed an increased helicity compared with the mutant fragments of melittin. From the secondary structure prediction by using the HNN method, the secondary structure of the hybrid peptide’s C-terminus was not changed compared with <b>thanatin.</b> The N-terminal helicity was not reduced compared with the mutant fragments of melittin. The melittin fragment and <b>thanatin</b> contained less than 30 amino acid residues, thereby contributing to the uncertainty over the tertiary structure prediction. Hence, the spatial structure of the three peptides cannot be compared. From the tertiary structure of the hybrid peptide model generated by the Phyre 2 and SWISS-MODEL, the N-terminal melittin fragment had an α-helix structure, whereas the C-terminal <b>thanatin</b> was composed of three independent structures, including random peptide fragments, β-lamella, and random peptide fragments. Considering the presence of independent α-helix and β-lamellar structures, the hybrid peptide retained the ability to inhibit S. aureus. The MIC of the hybrid peptide on S. aureus and B. subtilis was nearly consistent {{with that of the}} melittin fragment and <b>thanatin,</b> and its MIC on E. coli JM 109 and S. typhi was also increased (Fehlbaum et al. 1996; Li et al. 2003; Taguchi et al. 2000). These results suggested that the melittin fragment and <b>thanatin</b> almost did not interact with each another on the spatial structure of the hybrid peptide, and each peptide fragment retained its original antimicrobial properties. The retention of the melittin fragment’s activity might contribute to the anti-cancer activity of the hybrid peptide. In this study, a hybrid antimicrobial peptide {{was designed by}} the combination of α-helix and β-lamellar antimicrobial peptides. Both types of peptide did not interact with each other either in terms of spatial structure or biological activities, thereby providing ideas for the design of artificial antimicrobial peptides.|$|E
30|$|Another {{suggestion}} is to utilize from {{the potential of}} antimicrobial peptides (Datta et al. 2015). In this regard, <b>thanatin</b> {{is one of the}} most appropriate antimicrobial peptides that we would like to offer as a promising compounds to control fungal plant diseases. The valuable features of <b>thanatin,</b> such as being non-allergic for human (Wu et al. 2011) made this peptide encoding sequence as a good candidate to be insert in plants for making transgenic resistance crops against fungal pathogens (Wu et al. 2010, 2013; Imamura et al. 2010, 2016). However, due to the limitations and disadvantages of transgenic plants (Lu 2008; Prakash et al. 2011), synthetizing of <b>thanatin</b> in the form of recombinant and secretion in HEK 293 can be more efficient and manageable in the wide scale. It should also be mentioned that, the cost of production for this antimicrobial peptide is not comparable to chemical fungicides. Regarding to the great antifungal and antibacterial (Mamarabadi et al. unpublished data) activity of <b>thanatin</b> and its compatibility with human health and environmental safety compared to unpleasant effects of chemical fungicides, we could imagine a clear perspective for this peptide with the intention of its application in sustainable agriculture.|$|E
30|$|The unique {{antimicrobial}} {{mechanism of}} antimicrobials {{make them a}} promising substitute for antibiotics for fighting drug-resistant bacteria. Both melittin and <b>thanatin</b> have antimicrobial bioactivity. However, <b>thanatin</b> does not inhibit the growth of Staphylococcus aureus. Melittin can inhibit S. aureus and has strong hemolytic activity. In the present study, the mutant fragments of melittin and <b>thanatin</b> were combined by flexible peptides to form a novel hybrid peptide, which was synthesized based on the secondary and tertiary structure prediction. The hybrid peptide inhibited S. aureus with a hemolytic concentration of above 45  μmol/L and inhibition rate in SMMC- 7721 cells of 19.14 %. The hybrid antimicrobial peptide, which was designed by the combination of α-helix and β-lamellar antimicrobial peptides, showed that both types of peptides did not interact with each either on spatial structure or biological activities, thereby providing a novel idea {{for the design of}} artificial antimicrobial peptides.|$|E
30|$|The 15 {{modified}} {{amino acid}} C-terminus of melittin and the complete {{amino acid sequence}} of <b>thanatin</b> were ligated using the flexible peptide linker alanine–glycine–proline. Thus, the designed hybrid peptide sequence was GLPLLISWIKRKRQQAGPGSKKPVPIIYCNRRTGKCQRM. By utilizing online tools, the secondary and tertiary structure, molecular weight, and isoelectric point of the original peptides and the designed hybrid <b>thanatin</b> and melittin peptide were predicted. Secondary structure prediction was based on GOR ([URL][*]=[*]npsa_gor 4.html) and the HNN method ([URL] and the advanced structure was predicted based onPhyre 2 ([URL] and SWISS-MODEL ([URL] programs.|$|E
40|$|Background. Infections with extended-spectrum β-lactamase–producing Escherichia coli (ESBL-EC) have {{developed}} resistance to current therapies. Therefore, {{the underlying mechanisms}} of in vivo and in vitro activity of C-terminal–amidated <b>thanatin</b> (A-thanatin) against clinical isolates of ESBL-EC were studied {{in an attempt to}} resolve this problem...|$|E
30|$|Tomato {{seedlings}} {{were used}} as host plants in order to investigate the potential efficacy of <b>thanatin</b> {{compared to the other}} material including plant extracts and chemical mixture. The plant pathogenic fungus Alternaria tenuissima causing early blight in tomato was selected as a test fungus.|$|E
40|$|<b>Thanatin,</b> a 21 -residue peptide, is an {{inducible}} insect peptide with a {{broad range}} of activity against bacteria and fungi. It has a C-terminal disulfide loop, like the frog skin secretion antimicrobial peptides of the brevinin family. In this study, we tried to find the effect of a number of amino acids between the disulfide bond. <b>Thanatin</b> showed stronger antibacterial activity to Gram negative bacteria than other mutants, except Th 1; whereas, the mutant peptides with deletion had higher activity to Gram positive bacteria than <b>thanatin.</b> An {{increase in the number of}} amino acid(s) using the alanine residue decreased the antibacterial activity in all of the bacteria. Th 1 with deletion of threonine at position 15 (Thr 15) showed similar antibacterial activity against Gram-negative bacteria, but had higher activity against the Gram positive bacteria. In order to study the structure-function relationship, we measured liposome disruption by the peptides and CD spectra of the peptides. Th 1 also showed the highest liposome leaking activity and α-helical propensity in the sodium dodecyl sulfate solution, compared with other peptides. Liposome disruption activity was closely correlated with the anti-Gram positive bacterial activity. All of the peptides showed no hemolytic activity. Th 1 was considered to be useful as an antimicrobial peptide with broad spectrum without toxicity...|$|E
30|$|<b>Thanatin,</b> with {{a primary}} {{structure}} of GSKKPVPIIYCNRRTGKCQRM, {{is a type}} of antimicrobial peptide consisting of 21 amino acid residues. It is found in the insect Podisus maculiventris. Despite its broad-spectrum antimicrobial properties, it does not inhibit S. aureus (Fehlbaum et al. 1996; Mandard et al. 1998).|$|E
30|$|The {{most common}} method for {{controlling}} plant diseases is {{the application of}} chemical pesticides and sometimes use of resistant cultivars. Due {{to the effects of}} chemical pesticides on human and environmental health, mutation in pathogens and resistance to various toxins besides the challenges with resistant cultivar production, the constant use of these methods are not recommended any longer. Thus, use of biological control agents along with the natural ingredient extracted from plants and application of peptide with antimicrobial activity, have been the focus of many researchers. In the present study, the antifungal activity of two plant extracts named Turmeric and Persian lilac in comparison with a chemical mixture and recombinant <b>thanatin</b> were evaluated against five following fungal plant pathogens; Geotrichum candidum, Botrytis cinerea, Rhizoctonia solani, Alternaria tenuissima and Gibberella fujikuroi. The results showed that, all treatments have antifungal activity against tested fungi. Both plant extracts were shown an acceptable antifungal activity against tested fungi but their inhibition effects was not comparable with chemical mixture. Turmeric showed a higher rate of mycelial inhibition than Persian lilac. Amongst all treatment, <b>thanatin</b> showed a great antifungal activity by its application at µg level under both in vitro and in vivo condition. Considering to the compatibility of <b>thanatin</b> with human health and environmental safety we could imagine a clear perspective for the application of this recombinant peptide in sustainable agriculture.|$|E
30|$|<b>Thanatin</b> {{gene cloning}} {{processes}} was performed {{according to the}} same protocol which we used in our recent publication (Tanhaeian et al. 2018). Briefly, the plasmid vector harboring synthetic <b>thanatin</b> encoding sequence (shown in a Additional file 1) and pcDNA™ 3.1 (+) vector (Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA) were digested using BamHI restriction enzyme (Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA). Digested products were purified by gel extraction kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA), and treated by XbaI restriction enzyme (Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA) for 5  h; retrieved from the gel and used for ligation by fast ligation kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA). 10  μl of ligation product was then transformed into DH 5 α competent cells (Invitrogen, USA). The transformed colonies containing the recombinant plasmid (pcDNA™ 3.1 (+)-thanatin) were cultured and subjected for plasmid extraction using a plasmid extraction kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA). Transformation process was confirmed by restriction mapping and sequencing.|$|E
30|$|To {{expand the}} {{antimicrobial}} spectrum of <b>thanatin</b> {{and avoid the}} toxic effects of melittin, a hybrid antimicrobial peptide was designed according to a previous study (Blondelle and Houghten 1991). Hemolysis was slightly affected by the removal of C-terminal amino acids of melittin, according to the previous study (Jahnsen et al. 2015). Four alkaline amino acids (KRKR) are located at the C-terminal amino acids of melittin. The hybrid antimicrobial peptide that includes the full-length of <b>thanatin</b> and the C-terminal of melittin may reveal a stronger and safer antibacterial effect (Leonardo et al. 2012). The hybrid antimicrobial peptide GLPLLISWIKRKRQQ-AGP-GSKKPVPIIYCNRRTGKCQRM was designed using melittin’s C-terminal 15 -amino acid mutant GLPL*LISWIKRKRQQ (L*wild type was A) as the N-terminus and <b>thanatin</b> as the C-terminus and by ligating with AGP to create a hybrid peptide that could inhibit S. aureus without hemolytic activity. The fusion expression of the hybrid peptide {{was carried out in}} Escherichia coli by using genetic engineering techniques, and the acid hydrolysis site AP was added to the N-terminus of the hybrid peptide. After the engineered bacteria were fermented, separated, acid-hydrolyzed, and purified, another proline residue was found on the N-terminus of the resulting peptide, that is, PGLPLLISWIKRKRQQGSKKPVPIIYCNRRTGKCQRM. In vitro antimicrobial experiments showed that this hybrid peptide inhibited the growth of S. aureus. However, pure hybrid peptide was not obtained due to problems associated with acid hydrolysis. Therefore, the author designed an artificial hybrid peptide (GLPLLISWIKRKRQQGSKKPVPIIYCNRRTGKCQRM) to further explore its antimicrobial, hemolytic, and anti-cancer activities.|$|E
30|$|We used a {{chemical}} mixture including Mancozeb (Dithane M- 45 ®) 64 % W/W as a non-systemic fungicide with protective action on contact and Metalaxyl (Ridomil®) 8 % W/W with systemic function and inert ingredient 28 % W/W, {{in order to}} compare its antifungal activity versus two plant extracts and <b>thanatin.</b> The fungicides were purchase from Al-Mahmood Company (Manama, Bahrain).|$|E
30|$|The broth micro-dilution method (Irkin and Korukluoglu 2007; Plodpai et al. 2013) {{with some}} {{modifications}} {{was used to}} determine minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimum fungicidal concentration (MFC) of different plant extracts, <b>thanatin</b> and chemical mixture. Accordingly, a serial dilution was prepared from the stock solution of different treatments. Sterile distilled water was used as a solvent to dilute the stock solutions. PDB (Potato Dextrose Broth, Merck, Germany) was prepared, autoclaved and used as a basic medium for MIC/MFC evaluation. Then, the fungal disks were prepared using a cork borer from the marginal part of 7  days old fungal colonies and placed into the sterile empty test tubes containing 5  mL of PDB. One millilitre of different plant extracts, <b>thanatin</b> and chemical mixture at different concentrations were taken and added into the test tubes and mixed. The tubes were incubated at 25  °C for 5  days. Positive control tubes containing only broth media and fungal disk as well as negative control tubes containing broth media accompanied by 1  mL sterile distilled water was prepared and incubated at the same conditions. The MIC was defined as the lowest concentration of treatments that inhibited the visible growth of the fungi. In order to determine the MFC, the fungal disks were removed from the test tubes and sub-cultured on Petri dishes containing PDA medium and incubated at 25  °C for 5  days to determine if the inhibition was reversible. The MFC was the lowest concentration that did not permit growth on the plates.|$|E
40|$|In this work, {{the role}} of the {{disulfide}} bridges in the maintenance of the secondary structure of the antimicrobial peptides androctonin, poly-phemusin-I, and <b>thanatin</b> is analyzed {{on the basis of their}} structural characteristics and of three of their respective mutants, andry 4, poly 4, and thany 2, in which all the cysteine residues have been replaced with tyrosine residues. The absence of the disulfide bridges in andry 4, poly 4, and thany 2 seems to be compensated by an overall enforcement of the original hydrogen bonds and by extra attractive interactions between the aromatic rings of the tyrosine residues. In spite of the mutations, the original β-hairpin structures are maintained in the three mutants, but the best conformational similarities are found for the androctonin/andry 4 pair...|$|E
40|$|Immune {{challenge}} to the insect Podisus maculiventris induces synthesis of a 21 -residue peptide with sequence homology to frog skin antimicrobial peptides of the brevinin family. The insect and frog peptides have in common a C-terminally located disulfide bridge delineating a cationic loop. The peptide is bactericidal and fungicidal, exhibiting the largest antimicrobial spectrum observed so far for an insect defense peptide. An all-D-enantiomer is nearly inactive against Gram-negative bacteria and some Gram-positive strains but is fully active against fungi and other Gram-positive bacteria, suggesting {{that more than one}} mechanism accounts for the antimicrobial activity of this peptide. Studies with truncated synthetic isoforms underline the role of the C-terminal loop and flanking residues for the activity of this molecule for which we propose the name <b>thanatin...</b>|$|E
30|$|The {{antifungal}} {{activities of}} different treatments {{were determined by}} a whole plant method in the greenhouse, as previously described by Bajpai and Kang 2010; Nashva and Abo-ElyouSr 2012). Briefly, the 7  week old tomato plants possessing an average of 3 – 5 leaves were kept in the green house with 14  h photoperiod and 60 % humidity. The average temperature during day and night were 27  °C and 19  °C, respectively. The initial concentration of the test solutions were 1.6  µg/mL for <b>thanatin,</b> 100  mg/mL for both plant extracts and 2  mg/mL for chemical mixture. To prepare the test solutions, the stock solutions was diluted in 5  mL dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) followed by dilution with the water containing Tween- 20 (250  µg/mL). 30  mL from each solutions with different concentrations which were 1.6 and 0.8  µg/mL for <b>thanatin,</b> 25 and 50  mg/mL for both plant extracts and 1.5 and 2  mg/mL for chemical mixture, were individually sprayed as foliar application on tomato plants and repeated 15  days later. Two days after the second spraying, tomato plants were inoculated with 20  mL of A. tenuissima spore suspension containing 5 [*]×[*] 106 spore/mL. After inoculation, plants were kept in a climate chamber at a daily temperature of 28  °C and 85 % relative humidity. Disease development was recorded 15  days after inoculation. The severity of early blight was recorded for each treatment and scored from 0 to 9 according to the following rating system (0 [*]=[*]healthy plant, 1 [*]=[*] 1 – 5 %, 3 [*]=[*] 6 – 10 %, 5 [*]=[*] 11 – 25 %, 7 [*]=[*] 26 – 50 % and 9 [*]≥[*] 51 % of the leaf area infected) suggested by Latha et al.

40|$|The aim of {{the thesis}} was to {{generate}} Aspergillus-specific monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) and corresponding scFv-antibody fragments, while the recombinant scFv antibodies should be fused to antifungal peptides (AFPs). Maize plants transformed with AFP-scFv fusion constructs should posses an increased resistance against aflatoxigenic fungi in Zea mays. Mice were immunized with cell wall fragments of A. flavus and A. parasiticus to generate hybridoma cell lines secreting Aspergillus-specific mAbs, which were characterized by ELISA, immunoblot and immunofluorescence microscopy. Highest reactivity against A. flavus und A. parasiticus was obtained by mAbAP 3, mAbAF 1 and mAbAP 10, while these mAbs were not reactive to other tested fungi except Aspergillus spp. The antibody-encoding cDNA sequences of the three mAbs were identified and functional recombinant scFvs were produced in N. tabacum. The antigen of mAbAP 10, the cysteine-rich secreted protein (CSP; XP 002374495. 1) was isolated by immunoaffinity chromatography {{and the effect of}} CSP-specific siRNA was analyzed against A. flavus and A. parasiticus. Full inhibition of fungal germination was observed for both pathogens at 0. 5 - 1 nM CSP-specific siRNA. Therefore CSP {{could be used as a}} target to generate Aspergillus and aflatoxin-resistant crop plants. For the first time, a strong reduction of fungal germination could be demonstrated for A. flavus (MIC 4 µM) und A. parasiticus (MIC 12. 5 µM) using <b>thanatin.</b> Since the functionality of transient-produced thanatin- and chitinase-scFv fusion proteins could be confirmed, these fusion constructs and appropriate control constructs were used for stable transformation in maize. After transformation the integration of all constructs into the genome of maize could be confirmed by PCR. To analyze the resistance of transgenic maize, obtained seeds were tested in kernel screening assay against A. flavus. Compared to inoculated wild type seeds an exclusive expression of Aspergillus-specific scFvAP 3 did not lead to an increased resistance against A. flavus. However, a three-fold higher resistance against A. flavus could be detected for transgenic seeds expressing both chitinase and <b>thanatin</b> as well as the chitinase- and thanatin-scFv fusion constructs...|$|E

30|$|In {{the present}} study, the {{antifungal}} activity of two plant extracts named turmeric and Persian lilac {{along with a}} chemical mixture and recombinant <b>thanatin</b> were evaluated against following fungal plant pathogens; G. candidum, B. cinerea, R. solani, A. tenuissima and G. fujikuroi. The obtained result confirmed the antifungal activity of all treatments against tested fungi. Between two plant extracts, turmeric showed {{a higher rate of}} mycelial inhibition against tested fungi than Persian lilac. Although, the antifungal activity of plant extracts was satisfactory, the evaluated MIC and MFC values for them were much higher than that of chemical mixture which means two plant extracts were basically not comparable with chemical mixture (Table  2). However, in terms of maintaining health and environmental aspects, they are much more preferable than chemical fungicides. As a result, the aqueous extracts of turmeric and Persian lilac can be considered as good alternatives to control fungal plant disease as previously documented by Damalas 2011 in case of turmeric.|$|E
40|$|<b>Thanatin</b> and s-thanatin were insect {{antimicrobial}} peptides {{which have}} shown potent antimicrobial activities {{on a variety}} of microbes.

The NCCLS broth microdilution method showed that both peptides were sensitive to the presence of cations. The divalent cations showed more antagonized effect on the activity against Gram-negative bacteria than the monovalent cations, since the two peptides lost the ability to inhibit bacterial growth at a very low concentration. In addition, the activities of both peptides tested were not significantly affected by pH. Comparing to studies of other antibacterial peptide activities, our data support a hypothesis that positive ions affect the sensitivity to cation peptides...|$|E
