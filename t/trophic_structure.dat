25|$|A common metric used to {{quantify}} food web <b>trophic</b> <b>structure</b> is food chain length. Food chain length {{is another way}} of describing food webs as a measure of the number of species encountered as energy or nutrients move from the plants to top predators. There are different ways of calculating food chain length depending on what parameters of the food web dynamic are being considered: connectance, energy, or interaction. In its simplest form, the length of a chain is the number of links between a trophic consumer and the base of the web. The mean chain length of an entire web is the arithmetic average of the lengths of all chains in a food web.|$|E

To encompass the main tropic levels, we assayed carbon and nitrogen stable isotopes in various organic matter sources, intermediate consumers (invertebrates and fish), and 19 species of predatory fish (total of 1229 samples). At each level, wide range of variations for δ 13 C and δ 15 N suggested multiple sources for the OM, and complex trophic relationships among the different organisms. Despite this complexity, four <b>trophic</b> <b>structures</b> were identified. 1) The predominant reef benthic food web (R-BFW) based on the OM produced by algal turf supplies most of intermediate consumers and all anguilliform fish studied. 2) The sedimentary benthic food web (S-BFW), and 3) the lagoon pelagic food web (L-PFW), respectively based on sedimentary OM (SOM) and particulate OM (POM) involve {{a wide range of}} organisms and represent complementary food webs for most anguilliform fish. 4) Finally, the detrital benthic food web (D-BFB) where the OM issued from seagrass is indirectly utilised by reef consumers plays a secondary role.

The dragonfly population could be thought of as subsidized by the absence of fish predation.
