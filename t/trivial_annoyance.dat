60|$|The sun was hot, so {{he sought}} {{the shelter of}} a nearby tree, where he {{tethered}} his horse, and sat down upon the ground to smoke. Inwardly he swore at Gernois for the trick he had played upon him. A mean little revenge, thought Tarzan, and then suddenly {{it occurred to him}} that the man would not be such a fool as to antagonize him through a <b>trivial</b> <b>annoyance</b> of so petty a description. There must be something deeper than this behind it. With the thought he arose and removed his rifle from its boot. He looked to its loads and saw that the magazine was full. Then he inspected his revolver. After this preliminary precaution he scanned the surrounding heights and the mouths of the several gorges--he was determined that he should not be caught napping.|$|E

I have seen a brawny fellow, with no lack of {{ordinary}} courage, fairly quail before this slender stripling, when {{in one of his}} furious fits. But these paroxysms seldom occurred, and in them my big-hearted shipmate vented the bile which more calm-tempered individuals get rid of by a continual pettishness at <b>trivial</b> <b>annoyances.</b>|$|R

His work appeared in (among others) Swamp Fever and Cosmic Capers, and Big Muddy published one issue of Frolich's own <b>Trivial</b> <b>Annoyances</b> in 1972. He has worked as an illustrator (he did the cover and interior illustrations for Left of Africa by Hal Clement, The Magic Talisman by John Blaine, Comics Revue magazine, the 2001 release of Forgotten Tales of Love and Murder by Edgar Rice Burroughs, and the 2016 Tullus comic book.

6000|$|When the Rectory was ready, and {{the family}} returned, it was high summer, and there were {{constant}} meetings between the households. No doubt there were the usual amount of <b>trivial</b> disappointments and <b>annoyances,</b> but the whole season {{seems to me to}} have been bathed in sunlight. The Reform Bill agitations and the London mobs of which Clarence wrote to us were like waves surging beyond an isle of peace. Clarence had some unpleasant walks from the office. Once or twice the shutters had to be put up at Frith and Castleford's to prevent the windows from being broken; and once Clarence actually saw our nation's hero, 'the Duke,' riding quietly and slowly through a yelling, furious mob, who seemed withheld from falling on him by the perfect impassiveness of the eagle face and spare figure. [...] Moreover a pretty little boy, on his pony, suddenly pushed forward and rode by the Duke's side, as if proud and resolute to share his peril.|$|R
