5|$|Five former Rams players also {{jumped to}} the Browns in 1946: center Mike Scarry, tackle Chet Adams and backs Gaylon Smith, Tommy Colella and Don Greenwood. Their move {{gave rise to a}} legal battle with the Rams, who left Cleveland for Los Angeles shortly after winning the 1945 NFL {{championship}} rather than compete with the Browns.
