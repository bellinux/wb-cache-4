The EC-121s would then relay the collected information via a radio link at 2200 to 2300 MHz to Nakhon Phanom. At Task Force Alpha, {{the last of the}} <b>three</b> <b>components</b> in the system, the intelligence data (from a variety of sources, not just the sensors) would be entered, collated, retrieved, and stored by two IBM 360/40 (later two 360/65) computers. Technicians at the center controlled the system from a variety of video displays that were also linked to the computers.|$|E
5|$|Ranger's 9-foot {{prototype}} of the product, with plenty of right angles and shiny black Micarta skin, was bulky, imposing, and visually unattractive. Arnold Wolf was called in as the industrial design consultant to this project in early 1957. Wolf, who would later become {{president and chief executive}} of JBL, was initially asked to produce a shell version for dealers' shops. Due to transportation and installation constraints, it was decided that the speaker would be split into <b>three</b> <b>components</b> – the left and right channel enclosures, and the curved radiator panel – that could be easily re-assembled with a screwdriver. To support the weight and prevent deforming, the design called for six feet, of which four are height-adjustable. Instead of producing detailed drawings, Wolf worked with scale models. First, he created a 1:4 model in plastic, after which he made others. He ended with a 1:12 scale model that would show how it could be disassembled and reassembled. During the design phase, the relationship between Wolf and Ranger became very tense, and the project nearly collapsed. The parties came together over the month of June, and agreed on the definitive production specification for the Paragon. This would be a 2-way design.|$|E

40|$|Air-water flows, solids-water {{flows and}} <b>three</b> <b>component</b> air-solids-water flows in a {{vertical}} pipe {{have been investigated}} in a <b>Three</b> <b>Component</b> Flow Facility. Visual observations of the patterns show that the <b>three</b> <b>component</b> flow exhibits strong unsteady vertical motions which do not occur in the two phase flows studied. Quantitative results of the fluctuating component of the cross-sectionally averaged volume fraction measurements are presented, and related {{to the nature of}} the flows. The ratio of the steady component to the r. m. s of the fluctuating component of the volume fraction measurement (Signal To Noise Ratio) is found to be a good flow structure indicator. Remarkably, the solids-water flows and the bubbly air-water flows exhibit almost identical signal to noise ratios for the same volume fraction. However, the corresponding values for the <b>three</b> <b>component</b> flows reflect greater fluctuations corresponding to the vertical structures...|$|R
5|$|Until {{the end of}} the 19th century, weather {{prediction}} was entirely subjective and based on empirical rules, with only limited understanding of the physical mechanisms behind weather processes. In 1901 Cleveland Abbe, founder of the United States Weather Bureau, proposed that the atmosphere is governed by the same principles of thermodynamics and hydrodynamics that were studied in the previous century. In 1904, Vilhelm Bjerknes derived a two-step procedure for model-based weather forecasting. First, a diagnostic step is used to process data to generate initial conditions, which are then advanced in time by a prognostic step that solves the initial value problem. He also identified seven variables that defined the state of the atmosphere at a given point: pressure, temperature, density, humidity, and the <b>three</b> <b>components</b> of the flow velocity vector. Bjerknes pointed out that equations based on mass continuity, conservation of momentum, the first and second laws of thermodynamics, and the ideal gas law could be used to estimate the state of the atmosphere in the future through numerical methods. With the exception of the second law of thermodynamics, these equations form the basis of the primitive equations used in present-day weather models.|$|E
