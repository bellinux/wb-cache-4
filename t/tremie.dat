500|$|In early 1917, Tompkins {{submitted}} {{a plan to}} attempt a pumping out of the constructed cofferdam, which it noted as dangerous to the crew. This plan was denied {{because there was no}} artificial seal in place. The commission did not want Tompkins to proceed until the commission consulted an advisory engineer. In April 1917, William Burr was made the advisory engineer and made many changes to the original Strauss designs, most importantly the requirement that piers project into the concrete cylinders was stricken.

The Bridgeport bridge commission terminated the contract on August 20, 1917 and notified Tompkins that it would complete the project. The commission had Tompkin's crew forcibly ejected from the site on September 3, 1917 and took possession of its equipment until October 19, 1917. While the contract allowed the equipment to be taken, it also stipulated that delays that were the fault of the city would result in an equal extension to the time lost and Tompkins would sue the City of Bridgeport.

50|$|To start {{placement}}, the <b>tremie</b> pipe {{is first}} lowered into position. Air and water {{must be kept}} out of the <b>tremie</b> during placement by keeping the pipe full of concrete at all times. This is facilitated if the hopper capacity is at least equal to the volume of the pipe. When initially charging the <b>tremie</b> a wad of empty cement bags or a foam rubber pug known as a pig may be stuffed into the pipe to keep the flow under control while the first concrete forces the plug down the pipe and displaces the water. The pig will float out and rise to the surface. The discharge opening must be kept well immersed in the placed concrete, allowing flow from within the placement. 1.5 m of embedment should be maintained as a minimum if pssible. This can be measured by finding the level of the concrete surface below th top of the pipe with a weighted tape and subtracting from the known length of the <b>tremie.</b> It is critically important to concrete quality that the <b>tremie</b> discharge remains well embedded in the concrete. As the pour progresses if flow slows or stops, the discharge opening is raised so that the head in the pipe can maintain flow. Continuous flow is desirable if possible.|$|E
50|$|Concrete for <b>tremie</b> {{placement}} {{should have}} a very high slump of about 150 mm to 200 mm.|$|E
5000|$|The {{lower end}} of the pipe is kept {{immersed}} in fresh concrete so that concrete rising from the bottom displaces the water, thus limiting washing out of the cement content of the fresh concrete to the exposed upper surface. The upper end of the <b>tremie</b> pipe is kept above the water level during the pour and is provided with a conical hopper for batch loading, or concrete may be pumped into the top of the <b>tremie</b> pipe. Concrete must be poured at a rate which avoids setting in the <b>tremie.</b> Admixtures may be used to control setting time, slump and workability. Vibration and jerking of the pipe may be applied to encourage slumping and levelling of the upper surface of the pour, and the <b>tremie</b> may need to be raised occasionally during the pour so that the bottom end is not too deeply embedded, but the pipe must not be moved sufficiently to break clear of the mound and expose the bottom opening to the water, as this would allow washout of cement.|$|E

50|$|If it is {{necessary}} to move the <b>tremie</b> laterally, it is better to lift it out vertically, plug it and start a new pour at the new position than to drag it sideways through freshly placed concrete. If the area of the pour is too large to manage from a single point, it is better to use several tremies in parallel than to shift a single <b>tremie</b> around. A spacing between tremies of between 3.5 and 5m, and a distance of about 2.5m from the formwork has been recommended. The risk of segregation and uneven setting can be minimised by providing a continuous flow of concrete through all the tremies to maintain a moderately even surface.|$|E

5000|$|Preparation for {{construction}} commenced in 2007 with the clearance of all structures on site and reconfiguration of a pedestrian bridge towards The Mailbox. Bachy Soletanche Limited (BSL), led by Project Manager Chris Wallbank, then {{set to work}} creating a perimeter retaining wall around the site to prevent ground movement whilst the foundations were being constructed. A large diameter auger piling technique was used to install 226, 900 mm diameter piles at 1050 mm spacings and to depths of 24 m. BSL skipped three piles - after installing the first pile - to avoid concrete flowing into the next borehole and therefore damaging the original pile. Due {{to the presence of}} groundwater when the piles were bored, a <b>Tremie</b> pipe was used which displaced water to the surface as the bore hole was filled with concrete. At the southwest corner of the site, where the automated car stacking system was to be installed, BSL removed the large diameter auger piles and replaced them with 24Nr, 273 mm diameter minipiles bored to a depth of 24 m. Along the western boundary of the site, a further 54 minipiles were installed to a depth of 12 m to provide further support Washington Wharf, an adjacent apartment building. BSL then constructed 30 king post piles to provide the foundation for a temporary ramp which was required for future building works. Each king post pile was formed in a 900 mm diameter pile, with a 400 mm square steel column concreted into the toe of the pile. These piles ran in two parallel rows down the centre of the site from Commercial Street.With all the initial piling works complete, excavation commenced on site by local firm O'Donnell, who had to test various ramp gradients at one of their sites before starting work at the Cube. The optimum gradient for lorries transporting earth from a hill start was recreated at the site, with the surface of the temporary ramp up to Commercial Street being maintained in a coarse condition to give sufficient grip for vehicles entering and leaving the site. A total of [...] of earth and sandstone was removed from the site. Once this had been completed, BSL returned to construct 12 temporary anchors to hold back the retaining piles {{on the east side of}} the site. BSL completed the piling project at the end of 2007.|$|E
40|$|In {{bread wheat}} (Triticum aestivum L), waxy genes are present at three loci (Wx-A 1, Wx-B 1 and Wx-D 1) and are {{responsible}} for amylose synthesis in the grain. Near isogenic lines (NILs) of the agronomic cultivar <b>Tremie</b> with either one, two or three waxy null alleles were used to study the genome response to these null alleles through proteomic analysis of starch granule associated proteins of mature grain. Among the 352 spots that were revealed, 86 varied significantly between NILs. The main differences were observed for the granule bound starch synthase (GBSS), product of the waxy genes.

40|$|Monogenically-inherited {{resistance}} to Soil-borne cereal mosaic virus (SBCMV) in hexaploid bread wheat cultivars 'Tremie' and 'Claire' was mapped on chromosome 5 D.

The diagnostic value of Xgwm 469 - 5 D was assessed using a collection of SBCMV resistant and susceptible cultivars. Importantly, all susceptible genotypes carried a null allele of Xgwm 469 - 5 D, whereas resistant genotypes presumably related to either Claire and <b>Tremie</b> or Cadenza revealed a 152 or 154 bp allele of Xgwm 469 - 5 D, respectively.

40|$|Due to the {{widespread}} use of drilled shafts in state and federal highway bridges, strict regulation of the design and construction has been imposed by the respective agencies. However, documented cases of anomalies and/or poorly performing shafts continue to arise. To this end, this thesis investigates several aspects of drilled shaft construction that may affect the quality of the finished product. These areas include bentonite slurry properties and performance as well as reinforcement cage and concrete flow interactions. Recent research indicates <b>tremie</b> poured concrete does not flow as predicted. Instead of even rising, a differential between the height of concrete inside and outside the reinforcement cage has been observed. Compounding this problem is the fact that bentonite slurry used to support boreholes may settle suspended sand at the toe of the shaft or on the surface of rising concrete during long wait periods, affording the possibility of soil inclusions in the shaft. This thesis examines two methods of inquiry to quantify the behavior of concrete in a <b>tremie</b> pour drilled shaft and sand suspension behavior of bentonite slurry. Conclusions and recommendations are made to improve pertinent construction regulations to ensure quality of drilled shafts...|$|E
40|$|Starch is {{composed}} of two types of glucose polymers: amylose and amylopectin. The Waxy (Wx) locus controls amylose synthesis in the wheat kernel. Hexaploid wheat has three Wx loci located on chromosomes 7 A (Wx-A 1), 4 A (Wx-B 1), and 7 D (Wx-D 1). Eight near isogenic lines (NILs) of Triticum aestivum cv. <b>Tremie</b> with one, two or three Wx null alleles were used. The albumin-globulin fraction, and amphiphilic proteins were separated using 2 -dimensional electrophoresis (2 DE) allowing {{the changes in the}} waxy kernel to be identified. Albumin-globulin fraction showed overexpression of sucrose synthases in the waxy NILs compared to the normal form of <b>Tremie</b> and a decrease in many proteins related to stress and defence metabolism such as serpins. A subunit of ADP-glucose pyrophosphorylase (AGPase), which is known {{to play a major role}} in starch synthesis, was also shown to be down regulated in the waxy NILs. Amphiphilic proteins confirmed the observations made on the albumin-globulin fraction with a decrease in a stress-related protein. These different regulations linked to observations made on wheat kernel (thousand kernel weight (TKW), protein amount per grain, size and distribution of the starch granules) led to formulation of the hypothesis that waxy endosperm does not reach maturity of the wild-type endosperm...|$|E

30|$|One of the {{challenges}} to the {{ground source heat pump}} market is the cost burden of implementing the ground heat exchange. For the case of closed-loop vertical borehole designs, the thermal barrier presented by a loop can be significant. The high-density polyethylene (HDPE) pipe loop contacts the bore wall via a thermal grout. For example, a 7 â€“ 8 Â Â°C temperature difference between the water circulating in the loop and the bore wall reduces the heat pump operating performance. In general, the loop legs are not constrained within the bore cross section, and during installation, the legs can twist and contact one another over {{a substantial portion of the}} bore length, thereby degrading performance. Typically, the loop is sealed to the bore wall with a bentonite grout mixture, of which the hydraulic and thermal properties are very important to insure optimal performance of the installation. The use of a thermally enhanced grout, while advantageous to heat transfer between the loop and the bore wall, presents its own challenges. For example, the addition of sand to enhance conduction also increases thermal shunting between the legs of the loop and presents challenges in uniform mixing and deployment through a <b>tremie</b> pipe.|$|E
40|$|In South Africa, {{concrete}} in large-diameter {{bored piles}} is generally placed by discharging a high-flow concrete mix {{directly from the}} truck mixer and allowing the concrete to fall freely {{to the base of}} the pile hole. While certain site practices have been used by piling contractors for years, many engineers are not convinced of their acceptability. In order to assess the effects of free-fall concrete placement, a series of tests were undertaken in which the properties of concrete placed in this manner were compared with the properties of conventionally placed concrete. The tests included an assessment of the effect of water and spoil in the pile hole at the time of casting, as well as poor placement techniques. The results of this investigation indicate that casting of concrete in 50 mm and 400 mm of water in the bottom of the pile hole significantly reduced the compressive strength by approximately 50 % and 80 %, respectively. Furthermore, the effect of spoil at the bottom of the pile hole was dependent on the amount of water present. Finally, a separate investigation, at a bridge site, indicated the free-fall placement technique to be at least as effective as the <b>tremie</b> technique...|$|E
