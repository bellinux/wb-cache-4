5|$|Some {{of the men}} who {{purchased}} {{sex with}} Falle were police officers, and she knew girls who used drugs with their drug counselors. Falle was brainwashed to believe that her only worth lay in prostitution, which she later said was why it took her so long to exit prostitution. While engaging in prostitution, Falle was frequently threatened by other women in the sex industry, she was verbally abused by her clients, she was stalked, and she was threatened with guns on multiple occasions, including by her pimp. She was also drugged several times, and was once sexually assaulted by an escort driver after having been drugged by him. At one point, she was kidnapped. She had to resort to pulling a knife on people at <b>times</b> <b>when</b> <b>she</b> was threatened with violence. Because of various instances of violence during her time in prostitution, Falle was injured in a variety of ways. Her pimp broke several of her bones and burned her body.|$|E
5|$|In {{the temple}} with Nourabad, Leila expresses fear at being left alone, but Nourabad exhorts {{her to be}} brave and to fulfil her vows to Brahma on pain of her own death. She tells him of the courage she once {{displayed}} when, as a child, she had hidden a fugitive from his enemies and refused to give him up even when threatened with death (""). The fugitive had rewarded her with a necklace that he asked her always to wear. She had kept this promise, as she would her vows. On the priest's departure, Leila quietly muses on the former <b>times</b> <b>when</b> <b>she</b> and Nadir would meet together secretly (""). Nadir then enters; in her fear of Nourabad's threats Leila begs him to leave, but he remains and the two declare their love in a passionate duet (""). He goes, promising to return next night, but as he leaves he is captured by the fishermen and {{brought back to the}} temple. Zurga, as the fishermen's leader, at first resists the fishermen's calls for Nadir's execution and advocates mercy. However, after Nourabad removes Leila's veil, Zurga recognises her as his former love; consumed by jealousy and rage, he orders that both Nadir and Leila be put to death. A violent storm erupts, as the fishermen unite in singing a hymn to Brahma ("Brahma divin Brahma!").|$|E

500|$|The {{title of}} the episode is one of Fey's {{favorite}} words, which she used multiple <b>times</b> <b>when</b> <b>she</b> appeared as an anchor on the Saturday Night Live sketch Weekend Update. Fey explains that she likes the word because [...] "it's {{one of the least}} graphic ways to describe the female genitals". This episode marks the final appearance of Edie Falco, who was hired for a three-episode arc. Falco made her debut in the episode [...] "Somebody to Love" [...] as Celeste Cunningham, a Congresswoman and romantic interest of Jack's. She appeared in [...] "Secrets and Lies", where James Carville helps the fledgling relationship. The pair breaks up in Episode 210, when they realize their careers prevent them from staying together. Falco said that she was [...] "thrilled for the opportunity to work with such great comic actors", and expressed her enjoyment of watching the series.

500|$|According to Carey, writing [...] "Can't Take That Away (Mariah's Theme)" [...] {{helped her}} get through rough {{emotional}} moments with her label's management, and even <b>times</b> <b>when</b> <b>she</b> felt overwhelmed by others. During {{the early stages}} of the album, Carey said she felt pressured to complete the Rainbow album as quickly as possible, due to the fact that it was the last album under her contract with Columbia. During troubled times for the singer, as well as her divorce from record executive Tommy Mottola, she claimed writing and singing the song helped her get through troubled times and hoped her listeners would get the same message out of it. Carey thought it would become an anthem for fans and listeners who were going through difficult times in their life and could relate to the song. Additionally, during the taping of the Mariah Carey Homecoming Special, Carey told audience members that after the Columbine High School massacre in 1999, she felt the song would help family members and friends of the victims during the tragedy, and hoped it would give them strength to get by the tragic event. For that reason, Carey included the song on the album, and campaigned for its radio release in mid-2000.|$|E

And she feels they are pitying her because of her injury [...] and [...] really hates that." [...] Natasha wants Andrew and Summer to feel guilty about betraying her and she wants Andrew for herself. Andrew believes Natasha is pregnant and instead of being with Summer, he decides to stick by Natasha and their baby.

Novakovic insisted that Natasha is making the plan up as she goes along. She has not thought it out or how the whole situation might end. Her main goal is to keep Andrew and Summer apart because they betrayed and hurt her. Natasha and Andrew attend a pre-natal class together and they get on quite well. During an interview with Digital Spy, Novakovic explained that Natasha is reminded of why she fell for Andrew in the first place, especially when she sees his gentle side. Because Natasha is getting along well Andrew, there are <b>times</b> <b>when</b> <b>she</b> feels guilty for what she is doing.

500|$|Like her {{previous}} releases, Carey co-wrote and co-produced the album's material, working with several hip hop and R producers such as Jay-Z, Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis, Usher, Snoop Dogg, Missy Elliott, Jermaine Dupri, and Brian Michael Cox. For the album's debut single release, Carey collaborated with Jay-Z and DJ Clue. During {{the spring of}} 1999, Carey began working with Clue on several hooks and melodies for the lead single. After a few hours, they decided to include a hip hop star on the track, which eventually led to Jay-Z. Carey's longtime friend and back-up vocalist Trey Lorenz, who was featured on her remake of the Jackson 5 song [...] "I'll Be There," [...] added [...] "some soft male [...] vocals." [...] Carey worked with Lewis and Jam on the ballad [...] "Thank God I Found You." [...] She had already been {{in the studio with}} the duo several <b>times</b> <b>when</b> <b>she</b> contacted them to meet her at the studio, where she told them that she had come up with the title, hook, and melody. Usually, when Carey was writing the songs for Rainbow, James [...] "Big Jim" [...] Wright would play the organ or piano and assist Carey to find the [...] "right melody." [...] However, since Wright was not present, Lewis played the organ while Carey directed him with her lower registers, providing the chord progression. They composed the song and recorded Carey's vocals. Knowing she wanted to introduce a male vocalist on the track, Lewis brought R singer Joe and pop group 98 Degrees into the studio. After a few hours, the group and Joe had recorded all their vocals and the song was complete.

500|$|IGN {{contributor}} Robert Canning, wrote, [...] "Even in {{an episode}} like 'The 'C' Word,' {{where some of}} the ideas fall a bit short, there were still plenty of laugh-out-loud moments to talk about. [...] In the end, the great writing outweighed the slightly bothersome contrivances to make this yet another laugh-filled episode of 30 Rock." [...] He said that the pairing of Jack and Tracy [...] "gave us another opportunity to enjoy the pairing of the polar opposite personalities". Canning reported that the Liz plot had [...] "its funny moments", but opined that it was hard to [...] "get past the fact this wasn't exactly the Liz we knew", in regards to her being a [...] "domineering boss that cares little about her employees." [...] Canning gave the episode a 7.8 out of 10 rating. Julia Ward of AOL's TV Squad wrote that putting Alec Baldwin and Rip Torn together [...] "was a genius move." [...] She was complimentary towards Tina Fey, citing that it was [...] "another great week" [...] in her [...] "continuing portrayal of what being a hard-working gal is actually like." [...] Ward enjoyed Tracy's speech, noting that it was [...] "priceless", and was glad to see him having [...] "ample screen time... which was a nice change of pace." [...] TV Guides Matt Mitovich wrote he enjoyed all of the episode's storyline pairings, but much enjoyed Jack and Tracy. Further in his recap, Mitovich reported that Liz's plot could have been better had the comedy show How I Met Your Mother [...] "not gone there with the C-word" [...] in an episode. Though, he said that Liz's story [...] "had a fitting message – that she is held to a different standard, yet shouldn't be, as a female head writer.
