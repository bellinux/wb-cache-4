For {{factors that are}} variable, the table notes {{if it has a}} direct relationship or an inverse relationship. For example, as the amount of over-provisioning increases, the write amplification decreases (inverse relationship). If the factor is a toggle (enabled or disabled) function then it has either a positive or negative relationship.|$|E

Colorless, pale yellow and green crystals have the highest purity and are found closest to the resistor. The color changes to blue and black at greater distance from the resistor, and these darker crystals are less pure. Nitrogen and aluminium are common impurities, and <b>they</b> <b>affect</b> <b>the</b> electrical conductivity of SiC.|$|E

5|$|The {{fourth season}} of the American {{television}} medical drama Grey's Anatomy, commenced airing in the United States on September 27, 2007 and concluded on May 22, 2008. The season continues {{the story of a}} group of surgeons and their mentors in the fictional Seattle Grace Hospital, describing their professional lives and the way <b>they</b> <b>affect</b> <b>the</b> personal background of each character. Season four had twelve series regulars with ten of them returning from the previous season, out of which eight are part of the original cast from the first season. The season aired in the Thursday night timeslot at 9:00 EST. In addition to the regular seventeen episodes, a clip-show narrated by the editors of People recapped previous events of the show and made the transition from Grey's Anatomy to Private Practice, a spin-off focusing of Dr. Addison Montgomery and aired on September 19, 2007, before the season premiere. The season was officially released on DVD as a five-disc boxset under the title of Grey's Anatomy: Season Four – Expanded on September 9, 2008 by Buena Vista Home Entertainment.|$|E

Chabad Rebbes insisted their adherents acquire proficiency in the sect's lore, and not relegate most responsibility to the leaders.

25|$|In {{defiance}} of the common complaint that anti-cure advocates' ability to articulate complex opinions in writing—which some critics see as being impossible for autistic people—autistic adults such as Amanda Baggs use their own writing and videos to demonstrate {{that it is possible}} for severely disabled autistics to be autism rights advocates. She says that when the critics assume that intelligent and articulate autistic people do not have difficulties like self-injurious behavior and difficulty with self-care, <b>they</b> <b>affect</b> <b>the</b> opinions of policy makers and {{make it more difficult for}} intelligent and articulate autistic people to get services.

25|$|Six autosomal-dominant point {{mutations}} {{in the sequence}} {{have been found to}} cause various types of hearing loss, particularly sensorineural hearing loss linked to the DFNA 20/26 locus. It seems that <b>they</b> <b>affect</b> <b>the</b> stereocilia of the ciliated cells present in the inner ear’s Organ of Corti. β-actin is the most abundant protein found in human tissue, but it is not very abundant in ciliated cells, which explains the location of the pathology. On the other hand, it appears that the majority of these mutations affect the areas involved in linking with other proteins, particularly actomyosin. Some experiments have suggested that the pathological mechanism for this type of hearing loss relates to the F-actin in the mutations being more sensitive to cofilin than normal.|$|E
25|$|Certain {{paints and}} roofing {{materials}} may cause contamination. In particular, a Melbourne Water publication advises that lead-based paints never be used.

Zinc {{can also be a}} source of contamination in some paints, as well as galvanized iron or zincalume roofs, particularly when new, should not collect water for potable use. Roofs painted with acrylic paints may have detergents and other chemicals dissolve in the runoff. Runoff from fibrous cement roofs should be discarded for an entire winter, due to leaching of lime. Chemically treated timbers and lead flashing should not be used in roof catchments. Likewise, rainwater should not be collected from parts of the roof incorporating flues from wood burners without a high degree of filtration. Overflows or discharge pipes from roof-mounted appliances such as air-conditioners or hot-water systems should not have their discharge feed into a rainwater tank.|$|E

500|$|Despite their {{beneficial}} {{importance to}} humans, meat ants are sometimes considered pests, due to these ants disturbing {{the soil in}} urban areas and entering human houses occasionally to feed on food. The nests may cause annoyance if they are built around gravel paths, tennis courts and other cleared spaces. Although meat ants enter houses occasionally, they have adapted well to urbanisation and [...] populations can flourish in urban areas. During {{the early days of}} the city of Canberra, newly constructed suburbs provided new nest sites for meat ants. Unpaved streets, gravel paths and driveways are among the many new sites meat ants could nest in, making them a commonly encountered ant that may pose as a considerable pest to many. The abundance of food supplies from parks, plantations and home gardens also attracted meat ants to urban areas. They pose a serious problem for citrus growers in eastern Australia, because <b>they</b> <b>affect</b> <b>the</b> biological control of Hemiptera insects, specifically those who produce honeydew. Meat ants cannot sting, but they can induce irritating bites and secrete a defensive fluid from the end of their abdomen. Meat ants have been reported causing mortality amongst poultry.|$|E
500|$|The most {{prominent}} {{change in the}} battle mechanics is the introduction of double battles, in which the opposing parties each use two Pokémon at the same time. Consequently, certain Pokémon moves can affect multiple combatants at once. Multi battles were added alongside double battles. [...] They are identical to double battle, {{but there are two}} trainers to a side, each controlling one of the two Pokémon sent out. [...] Also new to the games are innate abilities and natures; the former is shared by every Pokémon of a certain species, while the latter may vary among a particular species. Abilities grant their holders certain powers in battle, such as immunity against certain types of moves or strengthening a certain type of move. Natures, like innate abilities, affect the strength of Pokémon in battle; however, <b>they</b> <b>affect</b> <b>the</b> stats of the Pokémon rather than directly affecting the strength of the moves. Another stat introduced in Pokémon Ruby and Sapphire is Condition, an important factor in Pokémon Contests, mini-games in which participants perform moves before a judge. Both Pokémon and their moves have a Condition, which is increased by using Pokéblocks (candies made from berries). Ruby and Sapphire were the first games to have different weather conditions (sunny, rain, hail, and sandstorm), and these affected battle in unique ways. [...] Secret bases were added as a one off feature where players could open up a hole in the world and customize the place with various items picked up in game. [...] Players who linked up with others who set up secret bases were able to battle an NPC version of that trainer within their secret base.|$|E
