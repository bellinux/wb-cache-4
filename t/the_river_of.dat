5|$|Ginko {{faces the}} Tokoyami {{itself in the}} {{writings}} warehouse, while Tama and Koro try to remove the Tokoyami by bloodletting. The newly healed Tanyu accompanies Tama and Koro to the warehouse, where they find a collapsed Ginko. Tanyu begins to remove the writings from Ginko's body and reattach them to the parchments. After Tanyu removes the writings, Ginko awakens and continues on with Koro. The pair finds the rainbow-like Mushi. After this, they part ways, and Koro {{goes back to his}} hometown to build bridges. Ginko faces a Tokoyami-possessed Nui and carries her to <b>the</b> <b>River</b> <b>of</b> Light (or Koumyaku), a stream of glittering Mushi called Kouki—the origin of Mushi life.|$|E
5|$|I-75 {{continues}} northward through Cheboygan County, {{passing the}} community of Indian River and spanning <b>the</b> <b>river</b> <b>of</b> the same name. North of town, the freeway traverses the area between Burt and Mullett lakes before intersecting {{the southern end of}} M-27; that highway provides access to Topinabee and Cheboygan. I-75 continues northward through tree farms and other agricultural properties in rural Cheboygan County. Cheboygan is accessible by way of interchanges for C-64 and C-66, a pair of county-designated highways in this area. North of C-66, I-75 turns northwesterly. The freeway meets the northern end of US31 and picks up the Lake Michigan Circle Tour (LMCT) designation before entering Emmet County {{on the south side of}} Mackinaw City. I-75 then parallels the county line on the west side of the village, meeting the northern end of US23. After that interchange, the Lake Huron Circle Tour (LHCT) merges in from the south. There is one more interchange along the freeway before I-75 ascends the approaches to the Mackinac Bridge.|$|E

5|$|In Stjørdal, {{controversy}} arose {{over the}} route. <b>The</b> <b>river</b> <b>of</b> Stjørdalselva creates a barrier {{just north of}} Hell, which made it cheaper to build the line on the south shore of the river to Hegra. However, the major population center was located at Stjørdalshalsen, {{on the north shore}} of the river. Locally, there were many protests against the line bypassing such a large town, but the cost of the bridge made Parliament choose the southern alternative. This gave residents in the town a considerably longer route to the train, since they had to cross the river to get access to the railway. This decreased the railway's ability to compete with the steam ships and thus the overall profitability of the line. With the arrival of the railway, transport to Trondheim became much easier than to Stjørdalshalsen and Levanger, helping Trondheim grow as a regional center.|$|E

5|$|The first {{philosophical}} cosmologists reacted against, {{or sometimes}} built upon, popular mythical conceptions that had {{existed in the}} Greek world for some time. Some of these popular conceptions can be gleaned from the poetry of Homer and Hesiod. In Homer, the Earth {{was viewed as a}} flat disk afloat on <b>the</b> <b>river</b> <b>of</b> Oceanus and overlooked by a hemispherical sky with sun, moon, and stars. The Sun (Helios) traversed the heavens as a charioteer and sailed around the Earth in a golden bowl at night. Sun, earth, heaven, rivers, and winds could be addressed in prayers and called to witness oaths. Natural fissures were popularly regarded as entrances to the subterranean house of Hades and his predecessors, home of the dead.* K. Algra, The Beginnings of Cosmology, 45 Influences from other cultures always afforded new themes.|$|E
5|$|The modern name of {{the river}} is {{comparatively}} recent, probably dating from around the sixteenth century. It {{is derived from the}} village and hundred of Rotherfield, located where the river rises. Rotherfield means 'open land of the cattle', based on the Old English Hrydera-feld. Prior to being called the Rother, it was known as the Limen throughout its length. This is a Celtic word meaning 'river'. In several Anglo-Saxon charters, it is suffixed with -ea, appearing as Limenea, where the suffix also means 'river', but in Old English. During the thirteenth century, it was known as <b>the</b> <b>River</b> <b>of</b> Newenden.|$|E
5|$|This {{beautiful}} species, {{which is}} sufficiently characterised to {{distinguish it from}} every other individual of the class, is copiously produced in Dutch Guiana, about 300 paces from the sea, and nearly {{as far from the}} left bank of <b>the</b> <b>river</b> <b>of</b> Surinam. It was communicated to me by the elder Vaillant, who discovered it in 1755 on some raised ground which was never overflowed by the highest tides, and is formed of a very fine white sand, covered with a thin stratum of earth. The prodigious quantity of individuals of this species which grow at the same time, the very different periods of their expansion, the brilliancy and the varied shades of their colours, present a prospect truly picturesque. The fungus was later placed in a new genus, Dictyophora, in 1809 by Nicaise Auguste Desvaux; it was then known for many years as Dictyophora indusiata. Christian Gottfried Daniel Nees von Esenbeck placed the species in Hymenophallus in 1817, as H.indusiatus. Both genera were eventually returned to synonyms of Phallus and the species is now known again by its original name.|$|E

5|$|Unusually for a river, the Saw Mill's waters have {{consistently}} had a slightly alkaline pH, suggesting {{it has not}} been as affected by acid rain as other Hudson tributaries. In 1951, a state Department of Health survey reported pH between 7.25 and 9.1. Four decades later, another study found pH readings rising steadily from 7.59 in Chappaqua to 8.24 in Yonkers. Similarly, a 2007 Manhattan College study done for the New York State Water Resources Institute found a median low of 7.36 in Chappaqua and a median high of 7.81 near Torre Road in Yonkers, with a drop to 7.67 at the tunnel, for a total median for <b>the</b> <b>river</b> <b>of</b> 7.59. The lowest recorded pH in the year-long study was 7.1 at Chappaqua with the highest reading, 8.17, at Torre Road. All results were between 6.5 and 8.5, the range required by state regulations.|$|E

5|$|The {{convention}} for naming Plutonian moons {{is to use}} names {{associated with}} the god Pluto in classical mythology. To decide on names for P4 and P5, Mark Showalter and the SETI Institute, {{on behalf of the}} discovery team, conducted a non-binding internet poll in 2013, in which the general public was invited to vote for their favorite names. The public could choose from a selection of Greek mythological names related to the god Pluto, or could propose their own names. After the initial announcement, William Shatner, the actor who plays Captain James T. Kirk in the Star Trek franchise, proposed the names Vulcan and Romulus, ostensibly referring to the fire god Vulcan (a nephew of Pluto), and to Romulus the founder of Rome, but also alluding to the fictional planets of Vulcan and Romulus in the Star Trek universe. The 'Romulus' suggestion was discounted, as there is already an asteroid moon of that name, but Vulcan won the poll after Shatner tweeted about it, with Cerberus (the dog that guards Pluto's underworld) coming second and Styx (the goddess of <b>the</b> <b>river</b> <b>of</b> the same name in the underworld) coming third. The winning names were submitted to the International Astronomical Union.|$|E

5|$|When Ptolemy {{wrote his}} Geography around 150 AD, the Arun {{was called the}} Trisantonis, with later {{accounts}} using the same name. Trisantonis {{is thought to be}} a Brythonic word for 'the trespasser', indicating the river's tendency to flood land near to the river. Trisanto translates directly as 'one who goes across'. There is also a theory that the Arun may have been known as the Trisantonis in its lower reaches close to the sea, but known as the Arnus (from the Brythonic 'Arno' meaning run, go, or flow) in its upper reaches. It is possible that the town of Arundel may mean Arno-dell, or dell of the flowing river. By the Middle Ages the river was known as <b>the</b> <b>river</b> <b>of</b> Arundel, the Arundel river, or the high stream of Arundel. An alternative name, the Tarrant (derived from Trisantona), is, however, attested in 725 and 1270, and is reflected in the road name Tarrant Street, one of the main roads running through the town roughly parallel to the river. The first use of the modern name was recorded in 1577, but the alternative names of Arundel river or great river continued to be used for many years.|$|E

Two years later, in 1564, Laudonnière landed at the Indian town of Seloy, the site of present-day St. Augustine, Florida, and named the river la Rivière des Dauphins (<b>the</b> <b>River</b> <b>of</b> Dolphins) after its plentiful dolphins; moving north, he established a settlement at Fort Caroline {{on the south side of}} the St. Johns, six miles from its mouth. Philip II of Spain, who regarded the possession of Florida as necessary for the safety of Spanish commerce, hearing that Ribault, who had returned to France, was organizing another expedition for the relief of his colony of Huguenots across the Atlantic, determined to assert his claim to the possession of Florida on the ground of prior discovery, and root out the French at all costs.

40|$|To compare {{water quality}} in <b>rivers</b> <b>of</b> {{developed}} and developing countries, a study based on physicochemical parameters and dissolved metals levels was conducted. Water samples were collected from selected sites in Dhaka, Bangladesh; Hokkaido and Osaka, Japan; Erdenet, Mongolia and West Java, Indonesia. Analysis of least significant differences revealed that most water quality parameters were within comparable low levels in both {{developed and developing}} countries. The dissolved metals concentrations {{were found to be}} similar and below those of water standards except for manganese and cadmium at every sampling point, and lead in Erdenet, Mongolia. Some metals showed high enrichment factors in <b>the</b> <b>rivers</b> <b>of</b> Osaka, Japan and Erdenet, Mongolia, indicating accumulation possibility of metals in the river-bed sediments. High concentrations of dissolved organic carbon, Escherichia coli and dissolved metals suggested greater water pollution in some <b>rivers</b> <b>of</b> developing countries than in <b>the</b> <b>rivers</b> <b>of</b> Japan. Principal component analysis showed strong correlations between “dissolved organic carbon and chemical oxygen demand” and “conductivity and total dissolved solids” at each sampling point, and E. coli, nitrate (NOmath image), nitrite (NOmath image), and pH levels were found to be higher in <b>the</b> <b>rivers</b> <b>of</b> Dhaka and Erdenet. In addition, there were high levels of Al and Zn in West Java, Pb in Erdenet, and Mn, Fe, and Cr in <b>the</b> <b>rivers</b> <b>of</b> Dhaka and Japan. Based on pressures and impacts, it is evident that dissolved metal, organic, and fecal pollution in <b>the</b> <b>rivers</b> <b>of</b> developing countries are in somewhat dreadful condition in comparison with <b>the</b> <b>rivers</b> <b>of</b> developed country...|$|R
