40|$|A new hotel {{investment}} {{performance metric}} is introduced. Starting with this issue, we will apply our new {{economic value added}} (EVA) indicator as a barometer of hotel investment performance. Complete details of how to use this benchmark and why it is superior to evaluating cap rates relative to 10 -year Treasury rates {{can be found in}} the recent publication from the Center for Hospitality Research and Center for Real Estate and Finance entitled “Using Economic Value Added (EVA) as a Barometer of Hotel Investment Performance,” by Matthew J. Clayton and Crocker H. Liu. Essentially, the hotel EVA spread tells us whether the current hotel yield (cap rate) exceeds the total borrowing cost (weighted average cost of capital; also includes the cost of equity financing) for doing a <b>typical</b> <b>deal.</b> Intuitively, if an investor finances a hotel project using 7 -percent financing, the current yield on the project should exceed the 7 -percent borrowing cost. Exhibit 1 (next page) shows that the EVA spread for hotels was positive until the first quarter of 2008. Subsequent to this period, the EVA spread has been either negative or near zero except for the second quarter of 2012 when it was positive. A negative EVA spread indicates that any return for hotel investors must come at the back end of the project. The expectation is that they will make their money when they sell the hotel due to price appreciation rather than making their money immediately...|$|E
40|$|The {{venture capital}} (VC) {{contract}} prescribing various deal {{terms and conditions}} is considered vitally important to the VC investment process and should provide incentives for the entrepreneur whilst managing the venture capitalists (VCs) financial risk. This aspect of venture capital has not been extensively studied in South Africa especially amongst public sector funding agencies which have become an important source for early-stage VC funding. The objective {{of this study was}} to determine whether public sector VC investment terms in South Africa have been effective in supporting entrepreneurs and managing risk. The effectiveness of government‟s VC intervention was gauged through assessing various perceptions of entrepreneurs and public sector VCs on <b>typical</b> <b>deal</b> terms and conditions put in place between them. The perception study focused on 14 terms or provisions in relation to its frequency of use, importance to stakeholders, effectiveness in managing risk, rationale for inclusion and acceptance by entrepreneurs. The research found that VCs and entrepreneurs alike generally agree on the typical terms that should be included in the VC contract. Most of the terms which entrepreneurs considered to be important for the enterprise were also frequently used in VC contracts suggesting that the terms were generally effective in supporting entrepreneurs. Nevertheless, the research points towards a greater need for VCs to use incentivising terms such as the clawback provision in their contracts since the terms most frequently used were perceived to be effective in managing investment risk.

30|$|Until {{the early}} 1980 s {{industry}} bargaining remained dominant in France, though reforms {{to make its}} role more important failed (Saglio 1995). The socialist’s government’s reforms of 1982 – 83 shifted the locus of bargaining to the enterprise, making it obligatory for employers to negotiate working hours changes and instituting direct employee representation in the enterprise. Successive governments have since promoted the enterprise level as a conduit for public policy interventions, further enhancing {{the autonomy of the}} enterprise from the wider industrial relations system, together with a relocation of employee representation from the trade union to non-union, firm-specific institutions in all but the largest firms (Jobert and Saglio 2005). In 1995 three of the six French union confederations reached an agreement with employers authorizing a mandated non-union representative to sign an enterprise agreement on working time. According to Howell and Kolins Givan (2011 : 243) this was a post hoc legitimization of a practice that had evolved since the 1980 s. “A set of legal exemptions first introduced in the 1980 s steadily eroded the primacy of the industry level, capped by a 2004 law on social dialogue which reinforced the autonomy of firm-level negotiators in almost every domain save wages.”(Culpepper 2006 : 37). Saglio (1995 : 210) claims that unions and employers’ associations have often allowed poor enforcement of industry agreements from which “exceptions are now often permitted as a means of reducing unemployment”. This development was sanctioned by the legal reform of 2004 which privileged standards negotiated at company level over those specified in sector agreements on a range of issues except the statutory minimum wage and job classification. Under certain conditions trade unions, if gaining a majority in works council elections, can invalidate the results (Keune 2011). Prepared by another central agreement, signed by three of the six main confederations, the 2008 legal reform makes it possible to negotiate agreements in smaller firms where there is no trade union presence. What has evolved is a disconnected dual system. In large industrial firms and in the public sector, where French trade unions still maintain a presence, the <b>typical</b> <b>deal</b> was to exchange working time flexibility and increased productivity for job security; in small firms and low-skill service sectors, without union representation, working arrangements and employment conditions appear to have deteriorated and external flexibility increased, without a trade-off (Lallemand 2006; Palier and Thelen 2010).|$|E

In this paper we present {{a new approach to}} the interactive visual exploration and analysis of data that contains attributes which are of set type. A set-typed attribute of a data item – like one cell in a table – has a list of n ≥ 0 elements as a value. We present the set’o’gram as a visualization approach to represent data of set type and to enable interactive visual analysis. We also demonstrate how this approach is capable to help in dealing with datasets that have truly many dimensions (more than a dozen or more), especially in the context of categorical data.
