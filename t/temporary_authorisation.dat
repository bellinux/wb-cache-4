Assigned to Kosovo by ITU with the {{agreement}} of the Administration of the Republic of Serbia after the reached agreement in the EU led dialog between Pristina and Belgrade. [...] Its dialing code was initially expected to become effective on January 1, 2015 but it was postponed to the finalization of the agreement in late August 2015. With {{the agreement of}} the Administration of the Republic of Serbia, the Director of TSB has assigned the international codes to Kosovo. Kosovo is represented in ITU as Kosovo* which the designation is without prejudice to positions on status, and {{is in line with}} UNSCR 1244 and the ICJ Opinion on the Kosovo declaration of independence.

40|$|A {{marketing}} {{authorisation for}} a veterinary vaccine is granted after the quality, {{safety and efficacy}} of the product have been assessed in accordance with legal standards. The assessment includes complete characterisation and identification of seed material and ingredients, laboratory and host animal safety and efficacy studies, stability studies, and post-licensing monitoring of field performance. This assessment {{may not be possible}} during {{the emergence of a new}} animal disease, but several mechanisms exist to allow for the availability of products in an emergency animal health situation, e. g. autogenous biologics, conditional licences, experimental and emergency use authorisations, the importation of products in use elsewhere in the world and pre-approved vaccine banks. Using the emergence of bluetongue in northern Europe as an example, the regulatory issues regarding the <b>temporary</b> <b>authorisation</b> of animal vaccination are described. Several conditions must be fulfilled before a <b>temporary</b> <b>authorisation</b> can be granted, e. g. inactivated vaccines should be used in order to exclude reversion to virulence and reassortment between vaccine viruses and/or field strains of the bluetongue virus; decision-making must be supported by scientific evidence and risk analysis; there must be a complete census of the susceptible animals that were vaccinated; vaccination protocols must be adhered to and there must be a scheme allowing for registration, delivery and follow-up of vaccination, and monitoring, analysis and, possibly, adjustment of field use of the vaccination. This <b>temporary</b> <b>authorisation</b> must be replaced by a full authorisation as quickly as possible. Peer reviewe...|$|E
40|$|SummaryObjectiveTo {{describe}} omalizumab (Xolair®) {{effectiveness in}} the first patients treated on compassionate grounds before its commercialisation in France. MethodsIn a historic-prospective study, data were obtained by questionnaire from the physicians whose patients had received a nominative <b>temporary</b> use <b>authorisation</b> (ATU) for omalizumab from July 2003 to January 2006. Anonymised patient data regarding demographics, asthma-related treatments and events in the year previous {{to the start of}} omalizumab treatment as well as the details of omalizumab treatment itself were obtained at inclusion. Follow-up data at more than 3 months following inclusion were also obtained and regarded asthma-related treatment (including omalizumab), events and undesirable effects suspected to be linked to omalizumab treatment. ResultsData were obtained for 147 of the 154 patients treated via ATU. 31. 3 % received inappropriate monthly doses of omalizumab. Of the 28 patients (19 %) who discontinued for unsatisfactory therapeutic effect, 7 were treated for less than the 16 weeks recommended to evaluate efficacy and 9 who were treated {{for a longer period of}} time were underdosed. During the treatment period and compared to the previous year, patients with follow-up data at 5 months or more had experienced 62 % fewer exacerbations requiring oral corticosteroids, 65 % fewer emergency department visits and 29 % fewer hospitalisations per year. The nature of adverse effects reported was similar to that reported in omalizumab clinical trials. ConclusionResults strongly suggest that omalizumab {{in the first}} patients treated in real-life setting provided a similar benefit to that observed in clinical trials. Underdosing of patients may limit this therapeutic effect...|$|R

New direct antiviral agents (DAAs) have revolutionised the management of HCV infection, with eradication rates higher than 90 %. However, their high cost has precluded their widespread use, leading to restrictive conditions of prescription in many countries.

The {{recognition}} of the so called belief marriages in Northern Ireland: a revolutionary High Court decision (9 June 2017) ABSTRACT: In {{a context in which}} most other countries in the British Islands have allready recognised the validity of the so called belief marriages, very recently the Northern Ireland High Court has delivered its decision in the case In Re Laura Smyth, concerning the autorisation of humanist celebrants to perform a legally valid and binding humanist wedding ceremony in Northern Ireland, as it had been requested by the applicant in this case. In this extremely important decision, Mr Justice Colton declares that the initial denial by the General Register Office of the applicant’s request was in breach of section 6 of the Human Rights Act 1998 as contrary to the applicant’s rights under Article 9 and Article 14 ECHR, and consequently makes a declaration against the General Register Office in order to grant the application for the requested <b>temporary</b> <b>authorisation</b> to humanist celebrants. This paper summarizes and conducts a preliminary analysis of this decision’s content...|$|E
