40|$|The {{electoral process}} in the United States {{is going through a}} major {{transition}} as money increasingly pours into non-candidate independent groups (“IGs”). Before 2000, IGs could engage in significant electoral advocacy without having to disclose the IG’s donors or its expenditures. Congress sought to address the lack of disclosure by requiring section 527 political organizations to disclose their contributions and expenditures. IGs quickly sought an alternative organizational form for engaging in political advocacy. The alternative organizational form of choice has been the tax-exempt section 501 (c) (4) social welfare organization. In a 2007 article, I explored whether such tax-exempt entities would be the next loophole used by IGs to avoid disclosure of contributions and expenditures. I concluded then that <b>taxable</b> <b>entities</b> would not be an attractive vehicle because there would be significant tax implications if an entity forwent tax-exempt status, and because taxable corporations were prohibited from expressly advocating the election or defeat of a candidate. The Supreme Court, however, overturned the ban on independent corporate spending in Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission. <b>Taxable</b> <b>entities</b> are now a far more attractive vehicle for campaign activity than they were in 2007. Social welfare organizations and other tax-exempt entities are now subject to increased scrutiny. In the campaign finance arena, regulation in one area often entices entities to conduct activities in another. As Congress and the Service consider further regulation of social welfare groups, they must also consider whether further regulation of tax-exempt organizations will encourage IGs to reorganize as taxable organizations. Since <b>taxable</b> <b>entities</b> are subject to less regulation, they will be attractive vehicles as long as the tax consequences to the IGs do not outweigh the economic and regulatory benefits of forgoing tax-exempt status. The key question is a tax question, not an election law question: Can <b>taxable</b> <b>entities</b> engage in campaign activity without incurring significant tax liability...|$|R

In keeping with our general theme that the scope of our tax concepts should be broadened and made more consistent in order to achieve equity, we recommend that the family be treated as a tax unit and taxed on a rate schedule applicable to family units. Individuals who are not members of a family unit would continue to be treated as separate tax units and would be taxed on a schedule applicable to individuals.|$|E

40|$|In {{the current}} tax system, a {{corporation}} {{is treated as}} a separate <b>taxable</b> <b>entity.</b> This tax system is {{sometimes referred to as}} an entity tax or a double tax system. Since a corporation is a separate and distinct entity from its owners, the shareholders, the default rule is that transfers between them are treated as realization events.

Congress has enacted several nonrecognition corporate provisions when forcing the recognition of income could prevent changes to the form of ownership from taking place even if the changes would provide a more efficient and economically beneficial structure.

40|$|Under the Internal Revenue Code of 1954, the {{corporation}} is aseparate <b>taxable</b> <b>entity,</b> so that corporate income is taxed to thecorporation and dividends paid by {{the corporation}} are taxable to theshareholders. The framework for the taxation of corporate distributionsis provided by Sections 301 (a), 301 (c), and 316 of the Code. By virtue of these provisions, a corporate distribution is a 2 ̆ 2 dividend 2 ̆ 2 that must be included in gross income under § 301 (c) (1) and§ 61 (a) (7) if, {{and to the extent}} that, it comes out of 2 ̆ 2 earnings andprofits 2 ̆ 2 of the corporation accumulated after February 28, 1913 or outof earnings and profits of the taxable year.

40|$|Corporate {{groups are}} {{notoriously}} difficult to tax. At {{the moment it}} is not clear whether corporate groups should be approached as single <b>taxable</b> <b>entities,</b> or whether a separate tax existence should be attributed to corporate group members. The current ambiguity generates a substantial deadweight loss. This study determines what may be the best approach to tax corporate groups, once the perspectives of government and corporate groups are taken into account. The study adopts an interdisciplinary approach, whereby elements, such as market imperfections, the economic, legal and functional nature of corporate groups and the rules of related regulatory fields, are brought into the investigation. The study is based on the US federal corporate income tax system, although, for certain issues, the UK tax system is analyzed. The study adopts a closed economy perspective. The study shows that the design and operation of the corporate income tax system is subject to several constraints and distortions, and argues that to simply look at how far a certain policy is from optimality may be insufficient to determine whether an incremental improvement occurs. The study proposes a new approach to corporate income tax policy whereby the pursuit of incremental improvements requires the minimization of transaction costs and other sources of deadweight loss and the taking into account of the collateral effects of the corporate income tax system, including its interaction with market imperfections, the behavioural and operational nature of business entities, the frictions imposed by other regulatory fields and corporate governance. Following this policy approach, the study concludes that treating corporate groups as single <b>taxable</b> <b>entities</b> is the best approach to tax corporate groups and recommends a revision of certain technical aspects of the current US and UK legislation for taxation of corporate groups...|$|R

There is also significant attention paid to the numerous 2 ̆ 2 anti-abuse 2 ̆ 2 rules that have been adopted by Congress and the IRS over the past several decades, including the disguised sale rules, the treatment of 2 ̆ 2 mixing-bowl 2 ̆ 2 transactions, the complex rules to prevent basis abuse, and the overriding 2 ̆ 2 partnership anti-abuse regulations 2 ̆ 2 adopted by the IRS. In addition, this book explores one of the fundamental questions that always arises in partnership taxation: Is a partnership to be treated as a separate <b>taxable</b> <b>entity</b> or an aggregate of its partners? The tension between entity and aggregate treatment of a partnership {{is one of}} the recurring issues in determining the tax consequences of partnership transactions.

40|$|Foreign {{corporations}} conduct U. S. {{business activities}} either through U. S. subsidiaries or U. S. branches. A U.

S. branch of a foreign corporation is not treated as a separate taxable entity; instead, the Code and regulations employ a set of special rules that allocate and apportion to the U. S. branch {{a portion of the}} foreign corporation 2 ̆ 7 s income {{in order to determine the}} net income subject to U. S. tax. The rules used for taxing U. S. branch activities are problematic in a number of respects. They fail in some cases to accurately reflect the income produced by U. S. branch activities. In addition, these rules may differ substantially from methods employed by other countries to assign income to U. S. activities, thereby raising the risk that a portion of a foreign corporation 2 ̆ 7 s income will be taxed by two counties. The rules for U. S. branches also appear to add to the complexity of the tax law. The end result of a separate entity method for U. S. subsidiaries and different rules for U. S. branches is unwarranted variation in tax treatment based on the form of business used by a foreign corporation. This article considers the use of the separate entity method for taxing U.

At the time of socialism the economy in some European countries was in a deep crisis. The states reacted to recession resulting from the ineffective economy by taking loans from abroad. In order to overcome such debts the states started to impose the higher tax rates on the population which enables the economies slowly to grow. As a result, the governments were gradually able to reduce the tax rates, which had a favourable impact on population as well as on enterprises. The ex- socialistic European countries progressively try to catch up the advanced countries and their standart of living and taxation is an indispensable tool how to achieve this purpose.

40|$|AbstractThe {{government}} had implemented Goods and Services Tax (GST) starting from 1 st April 2015 with 80 % to 90 % compliance from a taxable {{person on the}} first day of its execution with little commotion from end customers. The understanding and awareness of people and taxable person about GST can be seen from the success of the advertisements and programs held by the Royal Malaysian Custom Departments (RMCD) and other government agencies throughout 2014 onwards. GST is known as a multi-stages tax affected to each stage of products or services circulation. In other words, there will be 6 % tax imposed on all goods and services with some exception on certain items. Therefore, RMCD shall look after GST governance to ensure that <b>taxable</b> <b>entities</b> are continuously complying with all the regulations enforced under GST Act 2014, GST Rules 2014 and GST Order 2014. The efficiency and effectiveness of tax collection are very important for government to support the socioeconomic development of the country. GST governance as a process in guiding an entity with regards to their tax responsibilities will lead the entity to be more concerned about their contributions to the nation building. This study discusses the GST governance from overseas practices such as governance and risk management, processing and reporting, resources and capabilities and assurance that can be adapted into Malaysian context for best practice actions.

40|$|The {{right to}} tax is {{traditionally}} based on connection to jurisdiction. Taxation is divided into international and domestic systems. An international tax system subjects its residents to tax on their income {{from all around the}} world while a domestic tax system subjects its residents to tax only on income arising out of a source within the borders of such a State. Under the international tax system, a State's {{right to tax}} firstly depends on whether the taxpayer deriving the said taxable income is a resident of that country or not. With respect to an entity or enterprise, its place of effective management or its headquarters within a State is used to establish residence of such an entity in the State hence making the <b>entity</b> <b>taxable.</b> Where the enterprise does not have a place of effective management or headquarters in a State, hence rendering such enterprise a non-resident, treaty rules have established that the permanent establishment concept be used to tax business profits. The permanent establishment becomes the minimum criteria for establishing that such an enterprise has an economic presence within the borders of the source State. In the presence of an enterprise having cross-border transactions, it is possible for the enterprise to be subject to taxable under both the domestic tax system of the State within which it is a resident as well as under the international tax system of the source State within which it has a permanent establishment, thus arising the question of double taxation. To help solve such a situation, legal instruments, arising in the form of tax treaties were created to combat double taxation of income arising out of cross-border transactions. Integral in solving this situation is the concept of permanent establishment. The permanent establishment is a source rule; thus a basic requirement to be met before business profits of a non-resident that are attributable to its permanent establishment in the source State are taxed in that State. However, technology developments and the rise of electronic commerce are rising problems on the application of the permanent establishment concept in relation to taxing income from international sources of such businesses. 3 The broad meaning of the permanent establishment concept, particularly its requirements, make it difficult and ambiguous during its application to enterprises that conduct their businesses electronically or via the internet...|$|R
