5|$|One {{of the few}} {{groups that}} were never thought to be piscivores are the anurognathids; these were instead thought to be nocturnal, aerial insectivores, a view still {{maintained}} <b>today.</b> <b>With</b> highly flexible joints on the wing finger, a broad, triangular wing shape, large eyes and short tail, these pterosaurs were analogous to some of today's insectivorous bats, being capable of high manoeuvrability at relatively low speeds.|$|E

5|$|Ramprasad is {{credited}} with creating a new compositional form that combined the Bengali folk style of Baul music with classical melodies and kirtan.

His songs are sung <b>today,</b> <b>with</b> a popular collection—Ramprasadi Sangit ("Songs of Ramprasad")—sold at Shakta temples and pithas in Bengal.|$|E

However, an agnatic but illegitimate male line still exists <b>today,</b> <b>with</b> the current Duke of Beaufort.|$|E

5|$|Additional laws {{focused on}} {{protecting}} the area's rustic and undeveloped character.

The area was officially named the Boundary Waters Canoe Area in 1958. The Wilderness Act of 1964 organized it as {{a unit of the}} National Wilderness Preservation System. The 1978 Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness Act established the Boundary Waters regulations much as they are <b>today,</b> <b>with</b> limitations on motorboats and snowmobiles, a permit-based quota system for recreational access, and restrictions on logging and mining within the area.|$|E

5|$|The Rhondda Valley {{is located}} in the upland, or Blaenau, area of Glamorgan. The {{landscape}} of the Rhondda was formed by glacial action during the last ice age, as slow moving glaciers gouged out the deep valleys that exist <b>today.</b> <b>With</b> the retreat of the ice sheet, around 8000BC, the valleys were further modified by stream and river action. This left the two river valleys of the Rhondda with narrow, steep sided slopes which would dictate the layout of settlements from early to modern times.|$|E
