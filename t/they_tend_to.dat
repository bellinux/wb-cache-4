5|$|Charismatics {{trace their}} {{historical}} origins to the charismatic {{movement of the}} 1960s and 1970s. They are distinguished from Pentecostals because <b>they</b> <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> allow for differing viewpoints on whether Spirit baptism is subsequent to conversion and whether tongues is always a sign of receiving the baptism.|$|E
5|$|Mars has {{the largest}} dust storms in the Solar System. These can vary from a storm over a small area, to {{gigantic}} storms that cover the entire planet. <b>They</b> <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> occur when Mars is closest to the Sun, and {{have been shown to}} increase the global temperature.|$|E

25|$|However, early MEMS {{resonators}} did {{not have}} sufficiently stable frequencies {{to be used for}} timing references or clock generation. The metallic resonator elements <b>tended</b> <b>to</b> shift frequency with time (they aged) and with use (they fatigued). Under temperature variation <b>they</b> <b>tended</b> <b>to</b> have large and not entirely predicable frequency shifts (they had large temperature sensitivity) and when they were temperature cycled <b>they</b> <b>tended</b> <b>to</b> return to different frequencies (they were hysteretic).|$|R
5|$|Scotties, {{while being}} {{described}} as very loving, {{have also been}} described as stubborn.

5|$|Securely {{attached}} adults tend to {{have positive}} views of themselves, their partners and their relationships. They feel comfortable with intimacy and independence, balancing the two. Anxious-preoccupied adults seek high levels of intimacy, approval and responsiveness from partners, becoming overly dependent. <b>They</b> <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> be less trusting, have less positive views about themselves and their partners, and may exhibit high levels of emotional expressiveness, worry and impulsiveness in their relationships. Dismissive-avoidant adults desire {{a high level of}} independence, often appearing to avoid attachment altogether. They view themselves as self-sufficient, invulnerable to attachment feelings and not needing close relationships. <b>They</b> <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> suppress their feelings, dealing with rejection by distancing themselves from partners of whom they often have a poor opinion. Fearful-avoidant adults have mixed feelings about close relationships, both desiring and feeling uncomfortable with emotional closeness. <b>They</b> <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> mistrust their partners and view themselves as unworthy. Like dismissive-avoidant adults, fearful-avoidant adults tend to seek less intimacy, suppressing their feelings.|$|E
5|$|Tropical {{cyclones}} are {{not common}} over Arizona, but on average, {{a tropical storm}} or a tropical depression enters the state approximately every five years. However, indirect flash floods caused by the remnants of tropical cyclones are more common, as <b>they</b> <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> occur about every two years.|$|E

5|$|A {{stationary}} front is a non-moving (or stalled) boundary between two air masses, {{neither of which}} {{is strong enough to}} replace the other. <b>They</b> <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> remain essentially in the same area for extended periods of time, usually moving in waves. There is normally a broad temperature gradient behind the boundary with more widely spaced isotherm packing.|$|E
5|$|Bee-eaters may be infested {{by several}} blood-feeding flies {{of the genus}} Carnus, and the biting fly Ornithophila metallica. Other parasites include chewing lice of the genera Meromenopon, Brueeliaa and Meropoecus, {{some of which are}} {{specialist}} parasites of bee-eaters, and the stickfast flea Echidnophaga gallinacea. The hole-nesting lifestyle of bee-eaters means that <b>they</b> <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> carry a higher burden of external parasites than non-hole-nesting bird species. Bee-eaters may also be infected by protozoan blood parasites of the genus Haemoproteus including H. meropis.|$|E

50|$|Due {{to their}} {{geographic}} concentration, {{it is noted that}} <b>they</b> <b>tended</b> <b>to</b> be isolated {{and had an}} insular culture. As a result, <b>they</b> also <b>tended</b> <b>to</b> be very late in their adoption of the English language and of western culture in general. The insular culture and resultant intermarriage can result in a high degree of consanguinity amongst Vathimas.|$|R

5|$|Despite being bred for racing, Whippets can be couch potatoes. When {{not running}} around, {{they are usually}} asleep or cuddled in their owner's lap. They are not prone to {{fighting}} but {{have been known to}} chase small pets, due to their sighthound nature. They also have a tendency to get up on furniture. Whippets are touch sensitive, meaning that <b>they</b> <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> jump or overreact when touched unexpectedly.|$|E
5|$|Dopamine {{agonists}} produce significant, although usually mild, {{side effects}} including drowsiness, hallucinations, insomnia, nausea, and constipation. Sometimes side effects appear {{even at a}} minimal clinically effective dose, leading the physician {{to search for a}} different drug. Agonists have been related to impulse control disorders (such as compulsive sexual activity, eating, gambling and shopping) even more strongly than levodopa. <b>They</b> <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> be more expensive than levodopa.|$|E
5|$|Fork-marked lemurs are {{sensitive}} to light intensity, and emerge at twilight, calling numerous times and answering their neighbors' calls before going off to forage. Just before dawn, they also communicate again {{on their way to}} their sleep site. Cold temperatures can also cause individuals to retire to their sleeping site as early as two hours before dawn. Their eye shine creates a unique pattern among lemurs because <b>they</b> <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> bob their heads up and down and from side to side.|$|E

5|$|I don't {{see much}} {{difference}} between a communist regime and a fascist regime. In fact, I {{think one of the}} greatest intellectual confusions that many have had over these decades is the whole right and left thing -- fascists are on the right, communists are on the left. Nonsense! They come together and overlap, and we're seeing this in Russia today where the allies are the nationalistic chauvinists and the communists. They are natural allies because they are authoritarians by nature. And more than authoritarians, <b>they</b> <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> be totalitarians, which means that <b>they</b> <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> destroy all of the elements of the civil society. To me that's much more important than whether you're philosophically right or left. You know, are you willing to create and live in a civil society, in an open society, or not? That to me is the basic issue.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} soft sediments tend {{to accumulate}} on seamounts, which are typically populated by polychaetes (annelid marine worms) oligochaetes (microdrile worms), and gastropod mollusks (sea slugs). Xenophyophores {{have also been}} found. <b>They</b> <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> gather small particulates and thus form beds, which alters sediment deposition and creates a habitat for smaller animals. Many seamounts also have hydrothermal vent communities, for example Suiyo and Loihi seamounts. This is helped by geochemical exchange between the seamounts and the ocean water.|$|E
5|$|Individual sharks choose sites {{giving them}} the best ambush success. They prefer {{junctions}} of sandy and rocky substrates near reefs (used by many fishes for shelter) usually orienting themselves either toward or parallel to nearby vertical structures. <b>They</b> <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> face upslope, which may facilitate burying via falling sediment, bring more fish swimming downstream from the reef, or ease targeting by silhouetting prey against the sunlight.|$|E

5|$|Juveniles {{begin to}} court {{at a very}} early age, but may not bond for another two or three years. Aerial acrobatics, demonstrations of intelligence, and ability to provide food are key {{behaviors}} of courting. Once paired, <b>they</b> <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> nest together for life, usually in the same location. Instances of non-monogamy have been observed in common ravens, by males visiting a female's nest when her mate is away.|$|E
5|$|Most {{cases of}} SAH {{are due to}} trauma. In 85 percent of cases of {{spontaneous}} SAH, the cause is rupture of a cerebral aneurysm—a weakness in the wall {{of one of the}} arteries in the brain that becomes enlarged. <b>They</b> <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> be located in the circle of Willis and its branches. While most cases of SAH are due to bleeding from small aneurysms, larger aneurysms (which are less common) are more likely to rupture. Aspirin also appears to increase the risk.|$|E
5|$|New Guinea {{crocodiles}} have {{a mostly}} aquatic lifestyle and are largely nocturnal. They {{spend much of}} the day underwater, often with their nostrils and eyes above the surface. Powerful side-to-side movements of their tails propel them through the water and they use both tail and legs to steer. When on land, they favour shady, dense areas of undergrowth. <b>They</b> <b>tend</b> <b>to</b> bask in a group during the day, dispersing at night to feed.|$|E
