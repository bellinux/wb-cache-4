5|$|Fish are {{captured}} by cornering them in shallow water, usually against the bank or under logs. They take advantage when {{bodies of water}} begin <b>to</b> <b>dry</b> <b>up</b> in the summer or early fall and gorge themselves on the resulting high concentrations of fish and tadpoles. They were surprisingly unsuccessful at seizing either live or dead fish under water.|$|E
5|$|The {{widespread}} {{adoption of}} railways during railway mania caused coaching services <b>to</b> <b>dry</b> <b>up.</b> Along {{with many other}} turnpike routes, the New Direct Road fell into disrepair during the 19th century owing {{to a lack of}} funds and available staff. By the turn of the 20th century, it had become little more than a rough track in places, making it difficult to drive on.|$|E
5|$|While {{the game}} neared completion, the funding began <b>to</b> <b>dry</b> <b>up.</b> Having {{spent more than}} $20million of their own money, Broussard and Miller asked Take-Two for $6million to {{complete}} the game. According to Broussard and Miller, Take-Two initially agreed, but then only offered $2.5million. Take-Two maintained that they offered $2.5million up front and another $2.5million on completion. Broussard rejected the counteroffer, and on May 6, 2009, suspended all development.|$|E

5|$|By {{the sixth}} or seventh day, all the skin lesions have become pustules. Between seven and ten days the pustules matured and reached their maximum size. The pustules were sharply raised, {{typically}} round, tense, and {{firm to the}} touch. The pustules were deeply embedded in the dermis, giving them {{the feel of a}} small bead in the skin. Fluid slowly leaked from the pustules, {{and by the end of}} the second week the pustules deflated, and started <b>to</b> <b>dry</b> <b>up,</b> forming crusts (or scabs). By day 16–20 scabs had formed over all the lesions, which have started to flake off, leaving depigmented scars.|$|E
5|$|Lake Manly and {{its sister}} lakes started <b>to</b> <b>dry</b> <b>up</b> about 10,000 {{years ago as}} the alpine glaciers that fed the rivers that filled the lakes {{disappeared}} and the region became increasingly arid. Fish that had migrated into the lake system from the Colorado River started to die off; the only survivors are the minnow-sized Death Valley pupfish and related species that adapted to living in springs. Ancient weak shorelines called strandlines from Lake Manly can easily be seen on a former island in the lake called Shoreline Butte.|$|E
5|$|After {{retiring}} from boxing, a decision forced on {{him by his}} ailing knee, Dyer focused on his theatre appearances. His voice though, was not as it once was, and he strained to reach the higher notes of his range and bookings began <b>to</b> <b>dry</b> <b>up.</b> Dyer then refocussed on boxing, but this time as a manager. In the 1920s he moved to London, where he set himself up as a physical culture expert and ran a small stable of fighters. The three fighters training under him were Bristolians George Rose and Reggie Hobbs and most notably Bert Kirby from Birmingham. Kirby {{went on to become}} the British flyweight champion when he took the title from Jackie Brown in 1930. Dyer also ran a gym for gentleman on the Strand, which was used by fighters such as Bantamweight champion Teddy Baldock and American Packey McFarland who Dyer faced when the two men were boxing instructors in the US Army. The gym was later demolished to make way for a new hotel and Dyer was forced to find a new location.|$|E

50|$|According to {{geological}} studies, the Bandung paleo-lake sedimentation formation {{was last}} formed 20,000 years ago, and started <b>to</b> <b>dried</b> <b>up</b> during that period. The {{cause of the}} lake being <b>dried</b> <b>up</b> is a subject of study. It is suggested that either tectonic or volcanic activities in the area, or gradual erosion, has caused the natural dam to collapse, leaked the basin and drained the lake's water into Citarum river.|$|R
5|$|In {{addition}} to the main quest of defeating the Gym Leaders, there are side quests in which the player can aid NPCs by fulfilling tasks (usually obtaining items); other side quests involve catching legendary Pokémon. The most prominent subplot involves Team Aqua and Team Magma, crime syndicates who want to use Pokémon to alter the climate of Hoenn. In Ruby, the villains, Team Magma, {{want to use the}} legendary Pokémon Groudon <b>to</b> <b>dry</b> <b>up</b> the oceans of Hoenn and increase the region's landmass; in Sapphire, the Team Aqua are the villains and they try to use Groudon's counterpart, Kyogre, to increase the region's water levels. The player's father also introduces the player to Wally, a sickly young boy whom the player helps capture a Pokémon to be his companion as he moves away from the big city. Wally eventually overcomes his illness and becomes a successful Pokémon trainer, ultimately becoming the final challenger the player must face before the Elite Four.|$|E
5|$|Loxton {{also played}} Australian rules football, and in 1942, {{he made his}} debut in the Victorian Football League (VFL)—the highest tier of {{competition}} at the time—playing for St Kilda. One of his teammates was Keith Miller, a future Invincibles colleague. Loxton played as both a forward and a defender, and the pair sometimes played together in attack. The recruit from Prahran played in only six matches in his first year, kicking 15 goals. Debuting in round six, he started his career brightly, kicking five and four goals {{in his first two}} matches against Melbourne and Collingwood respectively, helping his team to two victories. However, the goals and victories began <b>to</b> <b>dry</b> <b>up</b> and Loxton managed only six goals and one win in the remaining four matches. St Kilda came second to last and did not make the finals.|$|E
5|$|While {{pursuing}} the thief, Spyro discovers a world once inhabited by the dragons, but long abandoned and forgotten. This world {{is under the}} iron-fisted reign of the Sorceress and her Rhynoc army. Spyro meets with Shiela the Kangaroo, Sergeant Byrd the Penguin, Bentley the Yeti, and Agent 9 the Monkey who help him on his quest. Shiela tells Spyro how when the dragons left the realm, the world's magic began <b>to</b> <b>dry</b> <b>up.</b> Spyro travels through each world in the forgotten realm, acquiring aid from the local inhabitants and rescuing the dragon eggs. It is revealed that the Sorceress is seeking not the baby dragons themselves, but merely their wings to concoct a spell that can grant her immortality. Once Bianca learns about this, she turns against the Sorceress and decides to help Spyro defeat her. Spyro fights and defeats the Sorceress, but she survives the battle and waits for him. After he defeats her again and retrieves the last dragon egg, Spyro returns all of the baby dragons to the Dragon Realms.|$|E

Because of water abstraction, the site is vulnerable <b>to</b> <b>drying</b> <b>up</b> in the summer time, particularly if climate change will further intensify the droughts.|$|R
5|$|With {{the return}} of the Test players for the 1950–51 season, Davidson had to perform {{strongly}} when given opportunities in order to hold his position. He started his season productively by taking 7/49 in the first innings of the opening match against Queensland, including the wickets of Test players Ken Archer, Colin McCool and Don Tallon, but he expressed disappointment at his erratic line and length, frequently bowling full tosses and long hops. New South Wales won by an innings, and Davidson took four wickets in the return match, but results began <b>to</b> <b>dry</b> <b>up</b> thereafter. He had the opportunity to show his skills against Test opposition as New South Wales played England ahead of the Tests, but he went wicketless, and was dropped in December after the next match against Western Australia. Davidson ended the season with 14 wickets at 22.71 and 42 runs at 10.50 from four matches.|$|E

25|$|In 2003 Pataki made a {{controversial}} budget proposal {{in which he}} proposed several tax cuts, despite the state's rising deficits due <b>to</b> <b>drying</b> <b>up</b> tax revenue from the once boom to now bust dotcom sector, and resulting tech layoffs. He also made cuts in {{education and health care}} funding, which some alleged would close emergency rooms and turn non-profit hospitals into for-profits. Pataki argued that new taxes would drive businesses out-of-state, reduce jobs and further compound the state deficit.|$|R

25|$|In 1923, {{farmers and}} ranchers formed an {{irrigation}} cooperative headed by Wilfred and Mark Watterson, owners of the Inyo County Bank. By exploiting personal bitterness {{of some of the}} farmers, Los Angeles managed to acquire some of the key water rights of the cooperative. After these water rights were secured, inflows to Owens Lake were heavily diverted, which caused the lake <b>to</b> <b>dry</b> <b>up</b> by 1924.|$|E

External aid picked up again after the departure of Aristide in 2004 under a transition government and the second government of René Préval. The external assistance is particularly focused at towns in the interior of the country and on rural areas, while the staggering problem of supplying the metropolitan area of the capital with sufficient clean water and a sewer system remains unresolved.|$|E
50|$|The {{community}} is under threat from food insecurity mainly attributed to climate change. Since 2000, {{the area has}} suffered many consequences of severe drought, but that of 2015-6 (El Nino-induced) was the worst. The drought caused a loss of livestock for many households. Some rural livelihoods have been undermined like small scale gardening, fishing due <b>to</b> <b>drying</b> <b>up</b> of rivers and important water sources like Gute in Mudyiwa Village. Victims of the droughts received relief aid from intergovernmental organisations like Care and Plan International.|$|R

25|$|Yasna 19.15 {{recalls that}} Ahura Mazda's recital of the Ahuna Vairya {{invocation}} puts Angra Mainyu in a stupor. In Yasna 9.8, Angra Mainyu creates Aži Dahaka, but the serpent recoils {{at the sight}} of Mithra's mace (Yasht 10.97, 10.134). In Yasht 13, the Fravashis defuse Angra Mainyu's plans <b>to</b> <b>dry</b> <b>up</b> the earth, and in Yasht 8.44 Angra Mainyu battles but cannot defeat Tishtrya and so prevent the rains. In Vendidad 19, Angra Mainyu urges Zoroaster to turn from the good religion by promising him sovereignty of the world. On being rejected, Angra Mainyu assails the prophet with legions of demons, but Zoroaster deflects them all. In Yasht 19.96, a verse that reflects a Gathic injunction, Angra Mainyu will be vanquished and Ahura Mazda will ultimately prevail.|$|E
25|$|Much of the {{destruction}} of the rainforest has occurred through slash and burn farming, which allows for little to no fallow time and creates soil erosion. It also depletes what little nutrition there is in the soil, which is then also polluted by the use of fertilizers and pesticides. As of {{the first decade of the}} 21st century, it is estimated about two thirds of the Lacandon outside the main biosphere reserve has been converted into pasture or cropland. Once this land has been cleared and used, it is very difficult to revert it to rainforest, even after it has been abandoned. Grass for pasture is particularly problematic because after it takes hold, does not allow natural vegetation to compete with it. In addition, the soil becomes compacted by the trampling of livestock. This degradation causes streams <b>to</b> <b>dry</b> <b>up</b> as evaporation rates rise from the lack of shade.|$|E

He has been one of many rebel cricketers who have returned due to the improving situation in Zimbabwe. He has had a superb comeback to the Zimbabwe cricket team, rising to 3rd in the ICC Cricket ODI Bowling Rankings, taking 45 wickets in just 27 matches, while bowling very economically. He played in all ODIs for Zimbabwe in 2009, against the South Africa cricket team, the Bangladesh cricket team, the Sri Lanka cricket team and the Kenya cricket team. Price was unsold at the original IPL 2011 player auction in January and Mumbai Indians bought him at his reserve price of $50,000, in place of the injured Moises Henriques. He became only the second Zimbabwean to play in the IPL.|$|E
