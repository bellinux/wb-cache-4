5|$|Following the 1896 tour, the English {{authorities}} realised action {{had to be}} taken. Jim Phillips, an Australian-born umpire who journeyed {{each year}} between his native country and England, travelled to Australia with an English touring team in 1897–98. During two of the matches he umpired, Phillips no-balled Ernie Jones for throwing. Upon returning to England for the 1898 season, Phillips also called C. B. Fry, a prominent amateur cricketer and all-round sportsman, for throwing. <b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>second</b> of three occasions in 1898 that Fry was no-balled. Other umpires, following Phillips' lead, no-balled Fry and Frank Hopkins. Two further bowlers, albeit not famous cricketers, were called for throwing in 1899.|$|E
5|$|Imperial Airlines Flight 201/8 was a Lockheed Constellation L-049 four-engine propliner, {{registration}} N2737A (c/n 1976), chartered by the United States Army {{to transport}} new recruits to Columbia, South Carolina, for training. On November 8, 1961, at 21:24 Eastern Time Zone (EST), the aircraft crashed as it attempted {{to land at}} Byrd Field, near Richmond, Virginia. While there were no apparent impact-related injuries, all seventy-four passengers and three crew members {{died as a result}} of carbon monoxide asphyxiation in the ensuing fire and smoke. Two crew members—the captain and flight engineer—survived after escaping the burning wreckage. <b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>second</b> deadliest accident in American history for a single civilian aircraft.|$|E
5|$|In a December 23, 2008 {{game against}} the Phoenix Coyotes, Paul {{suffered}} a fractured forearm after being struck by a shot from Phoenix's Olli Jokinen in the last regulation minute of the game.

He was injured again later in the season when he broke his foot while blocking a shot during a March 17, 2009 {{game against the}} Minnesota Wild, putting him out of play {{for the rest of the}} season. He scored 36 points in just 45 games that year.|$|E

5|$|In early April 1970, {{the diamond}} was rated {{one of the}} thirty great stones {{of the world and}} placed on display at Parke-Bernet Galleries in New York City. On 16 April 1970, the diamond was sold at auction for $500,000 (allowing for inflation, this would now be $) to Edward J. Hand, a then 48-year-old {{trucking}} firm executive from Greenwich, Connecticut. <b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>second</b> highest auction price ever for a diamond at that time, the first being circa $1.1 million for the Taylor-Burton Diamond several years earlier. Six years later, the diamond was placed on display in November 1976 at a charity benefit as a means to attract donors to that benefit.|$|E

5|$|On 13 October 1990, {{meteoroid}} EN131090, with {{an estimated}} mass of 44kg, entered the Earth's atmosphere above Czechoslovakia and Poland and, after a few seconds, returned to space. Observations of such events are quite rare; <b>this</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>second</b> recorded using scientific astronomical instruments (after the 1972Great Daylight Fireball) and the first recorded from two distant positions, which enabled the calculation of several of its orbital characteristics. The encounter with Earth significantly changed its orbit and, to a smaller extent, some of its physical properties (mass and structure of its outer layer).|$|E

5|$|Quinziato, {{the weakest}} climber {{of the three}} leading riders, {{attacked}} at {{the summit of the}} Denderoordberg, the penultimate climb of the day, quickly dropping Lampaert. Leukemans attempted to hold Quinziato's wheel, but was dropped on the flat. Quinziato soon had half a minute's lead and entered the base of the Muur alone. He had more difficulty on the climb, however: as Leukemans and Lampaert reached the cobbles, they quickly began to catch him. Quinziato eventually crossed the line with just a few seconds to spare. <b>This</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>second</b> professional victory of his career, nine years after his first, which had come in the 2006 Eneco Tour. Wellens finished in a large group 42 seconds back and sealed his overall victory in the race.|$|E
