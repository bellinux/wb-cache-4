5|$|General {{relativity}} {{includes a}} dynamical spacetime, {{so it is}} difficult to see how to identify the conserved energy and momentum. Noether's theorem allows these quantities to be determined from a Lagrangian with translation invariance, but general covariance makes translation invariance into something of a gauge symmetry. <b>The</b> <b>energy</b> <b>and</b> momentum derived within general relativity by Noether's presecriptions do not make a real tensor for this reason.|$|E

This proposal included cutting the Department of Education by 83percent and the United States Department of Homeland Security by 43percent, as well as folding the Department of Energy into the Department of Defense and eliminating the Department of Housing and Urban Development. Seven independent agencies would be eliminated and food stamps would be cut by 30percent. Under Paul's proposal, defense spending would be reduced by 6.5percent and international aid would be eliminated. He later proposed a five-year budget plan intended to balance the budget.|$|E

5|$|The {{life cycle}} {{assessment}} model seeks to identify the main types of environmental impact throughout {{the life cycle of}} a product. LCA was developed according to ISO 14040.

The reasons to use LCA arose from the need to have a precise process accounting and to highlight potential improvements {{that could be used in}} order to increase the environmental, energy and economic efficiency and overall effectiveness of the processes. In addition, the purpose was to quantify the environmental advantages deriving from the use of recycled raw material.|$|E
5|$|The main {{advantage}} of composite bows over self bows (made {{from a single}} piece of wood) is their combination of smaller size with high power. They are therefore more convenient than self bows when the archer is mobile, as from horseback, or from a chariot. Almost all composite bows are also recurve bows as the shape curves away from the archer; this design gives higher draw-weight {{in the early stages of}} the archer's draw, storing somewhat more total energy for a given final draw-weight. It would be possible to make a wooden bow that has the same shape, length and draw-weight as a traditional composite bow, but it could not store <b>the</b> <b>energy,</b> <b>and</b> would break before full draw.|$|E
5|$|The {{sense of}} {{community}} that arose from working and living together contributed directly to <b>the</b> <b>energy</b> <b>and</b> growth of the first union of women workers, the Lowell Female Labor Reform Association. Started by twelve operatives in January 1845, its membership grew to 500 within six months, and continued to expand rapidly. The Association was run completely by the women themselves: they elected their own officers and held their own meetings; they helped organize the city’s female workers, and set up branches in other mill towns. They organized fairs, parties, and social gatherings. Unlike many middle-class women activists, the operatives found considerable support from working-class men who welcomed them into their reform organizations and advocated for their treatment as equals.|$|E

Bruno and his father argue over Bruno's reluctance to play his electronic music publicly. Miss Berg, the school's Dance teacher, warns Lisa {{that she is not}} working hard enough. Michael, a graduating senior, wins a prestigious scholarship and tells Doris that the William Morris Agency wants to send him out for auditions for television pilots.|$|E
5|$|UND {{has three}} major {{libraries}} which, together, form the largest system of research libraries {{in the state}} of North Dakota. The Chester Fritz Library is the largest library in the state.

5|$|Wright met Darwin in {{the early}} 1760s, {{probably}} through their common connection of John Whitehurst, first consulting Darwin about ill health in 1767 when {{he stayed in the}} Darwin household for a week. <b>The</b> <b>energy</b> <b>and</b> vivacity of both Erasmus and Mary (Polly) Darwin impressed Wright. In the 1980s Eric Evans (National Gallery) suggested that Darwin is the figure in the left foreground who holds a watch. As this composed timekeeper is not consistent with Darwin's flamboyant character, {{it is more likely that}} this is Dr William Small. The attention to timekeeping fits with Dr Small's role as the social secretary for the Lunar circle. Small returned from Virginia in 1764 and established his practice in Birmingham in 1765, consistent with this being a meeting in 1767. The profile and wig of this figure are consistent with a contemporary portrait of Small by Tilly Kettle.|$|E
5|$|Catabolism is {{the set of}} {{metabolic}} {{processes that}} break down large molecules. These include breaking down and oxidizing food molecules. The purpose of the catabolic reactions is to provide <b>the</b> <b>energy</b> <b>and</b> components needed by anabolic reactions which build molecules. The exact nature of these catabolic reactions differ from organism to organism, and organisms can be classified based on their sources of energy and carbon (their primary nutritional groups), {{as shown in the}} table below. Organic molecules are used as a source of energy by organotrophs, while lithotrophs use inorganic substrates, and phototrophs capture sunlight as chemical energy. However, all these different forms of metabolism depend on redox reactions that involve the transfer of electrons from reduced donor molecules such as organic molecules, water, ammonia, hydrogen sulfide or ferrous ions to acceptor molecules such as oxygen, nitrate or sulfate. In animals, these reactions involve complex organic molecules that are broken down to simpler molecules, such as carbon dioxide and water. In photosynthetic organisms, such as plants and cyanobacteria, these electron-transfer reactions do not release energy but are used as a way of storing energy absorbed from sunlight.|$|E
