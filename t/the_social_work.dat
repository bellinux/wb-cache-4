STOLETÍ PARISH <b>SOCIAL</b> WORKS IN <b>THE</b> CZECHOSLOVAK CHURCH FROM 1920 - 1955 Autor: Františka Tichá In this work, I pursued <b>the</b> parish <b>social</b> <b>works</b> in <b>the</b> Czechoslovak church {{from its}} rise to 1950 's. I {{partially}} captured an {{origin of the}} roots of <b>the</b> Christian church's <b>social</b> <b>works</b> in chapter two.

Chapter five analyzes <b>the</b> <b>social</b> <b>works</b> in three selected parishes. In chapter six, I explained how the Czechoslovak church's teachings were implemented in parishes. Chapter seven discusses the downfall of <b>the</b> <b>social</b> <b>works</b> within <b>the</b> Czechoslovak church after February 1948. In conclusion, I have arrived at an opinion that <b>the</b> <b>social</b> <b>works</b> unions laid out an admirable effort in this field.

25|$|The 1950s would {{usher in}} even greater {{affiliation}} of group {{work with the}} profession of social work (Alissi, 1980; Andrews, 2001).

25|$|The 1960s and the 1970s saw the {{expansion}} of the social welfare state; the Vietnam War; the emergence of the war on poverty; the Woman's Rights Movement; the Black Power Movement; and the Lesbian and Gay Rights Movement (Balgopal & Vassil, 1983; Somers, 1976). The above social, intellectual and cultural factors influenced <b>the</b> <b>social</b> <b>work</b> profession including social group work (Balgopal & Vassil, 1983; Somers, 1976). With such a wide range of social and therapeutic needs there seemed to be an even greater appreciation of group work (Balgopal & Vassil, 1983; Hartford, 1964; Somers, 1976). Having expanded into differing practice settings, the purposes and goals of group work had been more broadly described at this juncture than in previous decades.|$|E
25|$|After resigning {{from the}} Housing Authority, Wong started to fade out from Hong Kong {{politics}} and {{retired from the}} Executive Council in 2002. Besides, she succeeded Antony Leung as Chairperson of the Education Commission from 2001 to 2007. In January 2001, Wong was employed as a non-executive director to the Cheung Kong Holdings by Li Ka-shing|and her employment aroused public concern. Some public opinions feared she had only {{stepped down from the}} Housing Authority for only seven months and it was inappropriate for her to be employed to a real property corporation. A few legislators also worried that Wong would no longer represent the interest of social workers by having a closer relationship with the business sector. Yet, she responded that she would only received 5,000 HKD annually as director's emoluments from the directorship and she promised to bring the voice of <b>the</b> <b>social</b> <b>work</b> sector into the corporation.|$|E
25|$|The {{period of}} time between the 1930s and the 1950s was one of growth and {{expansion}} for social group work (Alissi, 1980; Wilson, 1976). The economic despair of and varied psychosocial needs resultant of the Great Depression {{paved the way for}} greater affiliation between <b>the</b> <b>social</b> <b>work</b> profession and the field of group work (Alissi, 1980; Konopka, 1983; Wilson, 1976). The psychological needs of returning war veterans who served in World War II resulted in the more frequent application of social group work in psychiatric treatment (Konopka, 1983). During this {{period of time}} not only would the field of social group work debut at the National Conference for Social Work but additional advances would be made. Academic courses and research institutions were established; a professional organization was formed, The American Association of Social Work with Groups (AAGW); and a journal, The Group, was established. The first textbooks would appear as well, written by Harleigh Trecker (1948) and Gertrude Wilson and Gladys Ryland (1949).|$|E

25|$|By 1975 it {{was being}} used by <b>the</b> <b>Social</b> <b>Work</b> Department of Strathclyde Regional Council as an {{occupational}} day centre. In 1982 a decision was taken to sell it on the open market. This proved controversial—the residents of Pollokshields protested due to its connection to the heritage {{of the town and}} the historical significance to the area. Further protests ensued so a charitable trust was formed to ensure that the building would continue to be publicly owned. The Trust acquired the building for £1 in 1986. Only in 1991 was the title transferred with the condition that the derelict lodge house be restored within five years. Historic Scotland supported the heritage campaign as well as other organisations such as the Heritage Lottery Fund, Glasgow City Council, the Glasgow Development Agency and the local community and so the lodge house and the ground floor of the Hall were completely refurbished and reopened around 1997. The lower ground floor has since attracted further funding and what was once little more than cellar space has been converted to a contemporary conference room, which can be directly accessed from the outside.|$|E
25|$|Family therapy as a {{distinct}} professional practice within Western cultures can be argued to have had its origins in <b>the</b> <b>social</b> <b>work</b> movements of the 19th century in the United Kingdom and the United States. As a branch of psychotherapy, its roots can be traced somewhat later to the early 20th century {{with the emergence of}} the child guidance movement and marriage counseling. The formal development of family therapy dates from the 1940s and early 1950s with the founding in 1942 of the American Association of Marriage Counselors (the precursor of the AAMFT), and through the work of various independent clinicians and groups - in the United Kingdom (John Bowlby at the Tavistock Clinic), the United States (Donald deAvila Jackson, John Elderkin Bell, Nathan Ackerman, Christian Midelfort, Theodore Lidz, Lyman Wynne, Murray Bowen, Carl Whitaker, Virginia Satir, Ivan Boszormenyi-Nagy), and in Hungary, D.L.P. Liebermann - who began seeing family members together for observation or therapy sessions. There was initially a strong influence from psychoanalysis (most of the early founders of the field had psychoanalytic backgrounds) and social psychiatry, and later from learning theory and behavior therapy - and significantly, these clinicians began to articulate various theories about the nature and functioning of the family as an entity that was more than a mere aggregation of individuals.|$|E
