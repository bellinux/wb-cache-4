50|$|A Sport {{model was}} offered {{beginning}} in 1999 with eight-way power adjustable seats, heated front seats, 17-inch wheels, driver's seat memory, audible theft-deterrent system, three-channel garage door opener, high-intensity discharge headlamps, and a rear spoiler. The Catera received a facelift in 2000 with revised nose, <b>tail,</b> <b>wheels,</b> interior trim, mirrors, optional HID headlamps, stiffer suspension settings, and side airbags.|$|R
50|$|As {{originally}} built, {{the mill}} {{would have had}} a wooden windshaft and four common sails. The windshaft is of cast iron, probably replacing a former wooden one. It is 18 ft long and carries the head and <b>tail</b> <b>wheels.</b> The mill has two spring sails and two spring patents. The sails have a span of 58 ft.|$|R
25|$|The Stone Nut {{is a small}} {{gear driven}} by the Great Spur Wheel, Head Wheel, or <b>Tail</b> <b>Wheel.</b> It drives the Runner Stone either from above (Overdrift) or below (Underdrift).|$|E
25|$|The {{aircraft}} {{features a}} cantilever wing, a T-tail, a two-seat side-by-side enclosed cockpit under a bubble canopy, fixed tricycle or {{conventional landing gear}} with a steerable <b>tail</b> <b>wheel</b> and a single engine in tractor configuration.|$|E
25|$|The Bo 207 is a wood construction, single-engined, {{cantilever}} low-wing cabin monoplane with {{a conventional}} landing gear with a <b>tail</b> <b>wheel.</b> The aircraft {{is powered by a}} Lycoming O-360 four-cylinder, direct-drive, horizontally opposed, air-cooled, piston engine.|$|E
40|$|The tests {{reported}} in this report conclude the investigation of landing-gear drag that {{has been carried out}} in the NACA 20 -foot wind tunnel. They supplement earlier tests ({{reported in}} Technical Report No. 485) made with full-scale dummy wheels, wheel fairings, and landing gears intended for airplanes of 3, 000 pounds gross weight and include tests of <b>tail</b> <b>wheels</b> and <b>tail</b> skids...|$|R
5000|$|Cold weather {{operations}} {{version for}} the RCAF. Fitted with sliding perspex canopies, cockpit heating, brakes, <b>tail</b> <b>wheels</b> and metal struts. Wheels were moved forwards by 9.75" [...] {{to compensate for}} the installation of brakes by changing the angle of the undercarriage legs. Powered by a 145 hp (108 kW) de Havilland Gipsy Major piston engine. 1,523 built (including Menasco Moths and PT-24).|$|R
50|$|During the {{production}} of the Series II the tail skids were replaced with <b>tail</b> <b>wheels</b> and later on, swiveling wheels. Skis were also available, although open cockpit flying in the winter could be a challenge. Rudder pedals were introduced which allowed side slipping of the aircraft as well as crosswind landings. The rudders could be coupled to the ailerons or de-coupled and controlled by the pedals in flight through a mixer gear.|$|R
25|$|The {{fuselage}} is {{made from}} welded 4130 steel tube and the aircraft has conventional landing gear with <b>tail</b> <b>wheel</b> steering connected to the rudder pedals. The main landing gear utilises sprung-tubes for suspension and absorbing landing loads.|$|E
25|$|Developed {{from the}} Spectrum Beaver RX650, the SS-11 Skywatch {{features}} a strut-braced high-wing, a two-seats-in-tandem enclosed cockpit accessed through upwards opening doors supported by folding struts, fixed {{tricycle landing gear}} with wheel pants, a small auxiliary <b>tail</b> <b>wheel</b> and a single engine in pusher configuration.|$|E
25|$|The C.180 had a fixed <b>tail</b> <b>wheel</b> undercarriage. Each {{main wheel}} was {{mounted on a}} {{half-axle}} hinged from the lower fuselage and located by a hinged trailing strut, with a vertical, shock absorbing leg to the outer wing centre section below the engine, providing a wide track.|$|E
40|$|For {{determination}} of the elastic constants of airplane tires which are required for the numerical calculations of the shimmy properties of nose and <b>tail</b> <b>wheels,</b> deformation measurements were carried out on four different tires. For this purpose, the tires were loaded in each case with a normal load {{and then with a}} lateral force, a tangential force, and a moment. Moreover, the weight and the mass moment of inertia about a vertical axis were determined for the various tires...|$|R
50|$|The {{aircraft}} {{is built}} from fibreglass and features a fixed, fuselage-mounted, single-cylinder, two-stroke Gas Gas motorcycle engine, driving a retractable two-bladed fixed-pitch tractor propeller. The engine can be started and run before extending and engaging the propeller. The wing features flaperons and, unlike most other aircraft in this category, lacks wing-mounted air brakes, the brake being fuselage mounted. The landing gear consists of fixed nose, centre and <b>tail</b> <b>wheels</b> along with auxiliary wheels 5.5 m {{out on the}} wing from the fuselage. The aircraft is finished in white polyurethane paint.|$|R
50|$|Preserved {{parts from}} a Hornet {{can be found}} in the UK and Canada. The UK-based project has a forward {{fuselage}} reconstruction for a Hornet F.1. This includes many original parts, with the new-build items being made to original drawings. The same collection has a sizeable piece of wing, main and <b>tail</b> <b>wheels</b> and two canopies. Two rear fuselage sections (VX250 and VW957) are also in store, as well as the belly door, a main undercarriage leg and one rear engine/undercarriage fairing. In the province of Alberta, Canada a fragmented wing section from TT193 is in store.|$|R
25|$|The Auster Model N {{normally}} {{known by}} the specification number as the A.2/45 was a strut-braced high-wing monoplane with a single DH Gipsy Queen engine, the enclosed cabin had room for a pilot and observer seated in tandem. It had a conventional landing gear with a <b>tail</b> <b>wheel.</b>|$|E
25|$|The Hawk line of {{ultralight}} aircraft was introduced at Sun 'n Fun, Lakeland, Florida, in March, 1982. The Hawk {{was the first}} fully enclosed ultralight, the first with fully strut-braced wings, three-axis controls, a steerable nose or <b>tail</b> <b>wheel</b> and wing flaps. The original 1982 CGS Hawk Classic remains in production in 2015.|$|E
25|$|The Windshaft {{carries the}} Sails {{and also the}} Brake Wheel (Smock and Tower mills, and in some Post mills) or the Head Wheel and <b>Tail</b> <b>Wheel</b> in a Post Mill. Windshafts can be wholly made of wood, or wood with a cast iron Poll End (where the Sails are mounted) or entirely of cast iron.|$|E
50|$|An {{alternative}} theory {{states that}} the name in French was rouet de rats (or a spinning wheel of rats, the knotted <b>tails</b> being <b>wheel</b> spokes), with the term transforming over time into roi de rats.|$|R
2500|$|To begin flight testing, a {{temporary}} non-retractable undercarriage with long braced V-legs {{was attached to}} the fuselage, and fixed <b>tail</b> <b>wheels</b> attached to the lower pair of fins. In this form, the aircraft was trucked to Edwards AFB in November 1953 for ground testing and taxiing trials. During one of these tests, {{at a time when the}} aft section of the large spinner had not yet been fitted, Lockheed Chief Test Pilot Herman [...] "Fish" [...] Salmon managed to taxi the aircraft past the liftoff speed, and the aircraft made a brief hop on 22 December 1953. The official first flight took place on 16 June 1954.|$|R
50|$|At {{the rear}} of the short {{fuselage}} was a low aspect ratio tailplane, externally braced to the fuselage underside and fitted with elevators. It carried swept, oval tail fins taken from the SNCASE SE-100 twin engine fighter at its tips, which were externally braced to the tailplane underside. The fins were fitted with rudders and, more unusually, wheels; the SE.100 had fin mounted <b>tail</b> <b>wheels</b> but the SE.700 had tricycle gear so these became the main wheels, tidily faired {{into the bottom of the}} fins. Its nosewheel retracted backwards, placing the wheel partly in the fuselage and its leg within a small ventral fairing.|$|R
25|$|The OH-1 Light Observation Helicopter is a tandem-seat, {{twin-engine}} scout helicopter. It has {{a narrow}} fuselage fitted with small stub wings and a non-retractable <b>tail</b> <b>wheel</b> undercarriage. The OH-1 is suited to armed scout, light escort, and observation duties. It {{is equipped with}} an automatic pilot system with flight holding functionality, while the cockpit features a multi-display system to lower workloads on its two-man crew.|$|E
25|$|The {{final design}} looked much like Noorduyn's earlier Fokker designs, a high-wing braced {{monoplane}} with an all-welded steel tubing fuselage. Attached wood stringers carried a fabric skin. Its wing was all fabric covered wood, except for steel tubing flaps and ailerons. The divided landing gear were fitted to fuselage stubs; legs were secured with two bolts each {{to allow the}} alternate arrangement of floats or skis. The <b>tail</b> <b>wheel</b> strut could be fitted with a wheel or tail skid.|$|E
25|$|The {{original}} XA {{model is}} constructed from bolted together anodized aluminum tubing, with a fiberglass hull. The wire-braced wing {{is supported by}} a king post and is of aluminum structure, covered with pre-sewn Dacron covers. The wing features 2/3 span ailerons and no flaps. The <b>tail</b> <b>wheel</b> is retractable via a cable control, while the main landing gear is removed by the pilot in flight and stowed in the cockpit for landing on water after a land take-off.|$|E
5000|$|To begin flight testing, a {{temporary}} non-retractable undercarriage with long braced V-legs {{was attached to}} the fuselage, and fixed <b>tail</b> <b>wheels</b> attached to the lower pair of fins.

50|$|Developed by IPE with {{different}} {{vertical and horizontal}} <b>tail,</b> and retractable <b>wheel.</b> At least one built.|$|R
50|$|Flown for {{the first}} time on 26 October 1931, the DH.82 Tiger Moth was derived from the DH.60 Moth. The DH 82 was powered by a 120 hp Gipsy II engine, but the 1939 DH.82a {{received}} the 145 hp Gipsy Major. More than 1,000 Tiger Moths were delivered before the Second World War, and subsequently 4,005 were built in the UK and shipped all over the world. 1,747 were built in Canada (the majority being the DH.82c model with enclosed cockpits, brakes, <b>tail</b> <b>wheels,</b> etc.). The follow-up DH.83 Fox Moth was designed in England in 1932 as a light, economic transport and was built using as many Tiger Moth components as possible.|$|R
25|$|The {{company had}} been formed at Staten Island, New York in 1906 by Charles and Adolph Wittemann as Wittemann Aeronautical Engineers. The first {{aircraft}} built was a Wright pusher biplane in 1907, unusual for the time it had a swivelling <b>tail</b> <b>wheel.</b> A series of Wright pusher triplanes were built between 1908 and 1914 {{for a number of}} notable aviators. In 1911 they built a number of Hall-Scott pusher biplanes for Thomas Baldwin, known as the Baldwin Red Devil for the red-doped covering. Between 1913 and 1914 they built several Curtis-type biplanes.|$|E
25|$|A {{final version}} of the aircraft, {{designated}} B6N3 Model 13, was planned for land-based use as, by this point in the war, all of Japan's large carriers had been sunk and those few smaller ones remaining lacked catapults for launching heavier carrier-borne aircraft like the B6N. Changes included installation of a Kasei Model 25c engine, a more streamlined engine cowling and crew canopy, strengthening of the main landing gear, a retractable <b>tail</b> <b>wheel</b> and removal of the tail hook. Two B6N3 prototypes were completed but Japan surrendered before this variant could be put into production.|$|E
25|$|Although Gull {{variants}} were {{powered by}} five different engines, those were all inverted inline air-cooled types driving two-bladed propellers, making for a neatly faired installation. The rear fuselage was of square cross section with a rounded top. The glazed cabin joined smoothly into a raised dorsal fairing, {{and placed the}} pilot in front and two passenger seats, slightly staggered behind. Entry into the early models was via the sliding canopy. The main undercarriage was fixed and spatted, each wheel mounted on three struts in the early models; {{there was a small}} steerable <b>tail</b> <b>wheel.</b>|$|E
50|$|During mid-February 1943 the Department of Public Works {{received}} a requisition from the US Army {{for construction of}} a gun firing range, or bore sight range, platform at Charters Towers airfield to test the accuracy of aircraft fixed armament. The work order was lodged with the superintending engineer, Department of Interior, Townsville. The concrete gun firing platform was designed with an adjustable metal plate set {{in front of the}} concrete block to take the nose wheel of aircraft with tricycle undercarriages, such as the B-25. A steel gantry frame with a sling was positioned on the platform to lift the tail of fighter aircraft with <b>tail</b> <b>wheels</b> such as the P-40. The bore sight range extended about 360 metres to an earth mound, or butt, in front of which a target was set.|$|R
50|$|In 1930 an {{improved}} version, the Desoutter II was produced. It had a de Havilland Gipsy III engine, redesigned ailerons and <b>tail</b> surfaces and <b>wheel</b> brakes.|$|R
5000|$|The {{production}} Sirius fuselage is predominately {{made from}} fibreglass, with wooden bulkheads. The 13.4 m span tapered wing has a wooden spar and Styrofoam wing ribs reinforced with fibreglass and features air brakes {{on the top}} surface for glidepath control. The wing's leading edge is fabricated from hot-wire cut foam, laminated with fibreglass. The wing and rudder are fabric covered. The fixed landing gear is a centre-line bicycle gear, with auxiliary wing tip and <b>tail</b> <b>wheels.</b> The main wheel has a drum brake. The [...] König SC 430 engine, or alternatively the [...] JPX D-320 engine, is mounted behind the cockpit and beneath the tail boom in pusher configuration and features a propeller guard plate just behind the main wheel. The propeller is a fixed pitch two-bladed design with small diameter. The cockpit width is 53 cm and the best glide ratio is 23:1.|$|R
