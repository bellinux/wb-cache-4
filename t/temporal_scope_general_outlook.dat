40|$|<b>Temporal</b> <b>scope</b> adds a time {{dimension}} to facts in Knowledge Bases (KBs). These time scopes specify the time periods when a given fact was valid in real life. With-out <b>temporal</b> <b>scope,</b> many facts are under-specified, reducing {{the usefulness of}} the data for upper level applications such as Question Answering. Existing methods for <b>temporal</b> <b>scope</b> inference and extrac-tion still suffer from low accuracy. In this paper, we present a new method that lever-ages temporal profiles augmented with context — Contextual Temporal Profiles (CTPs) of entities. Through change pat-terns in an entity’s CTP, we model the en-tity’s state change brought about by real world events that happen to the entity (e. g, hired, fired, divorced, etc.). This leads to a new formulation of the <b>temporal</b> <b>scoping</b> problem as a state change detection prob-lem. Our experiments show that this for-mulation of the problem, and the resulting solution are highly effective for inferring <b>temporal</b> <b>scope</b> of facts...|$|R

40|$|The paper {{decomposes}} {{a geographical}} concentration index {{to examine the}} <b>temporal</b> <b>scope</b> of a spillover, which is {{the period of time}} over which one firm’s activity directly affects the location of other firms’ activities. Natural advantages are fixed over reasonably long time periods, but if spillovers have a limited <b>temporal</b> <b>scope</b> then this can be used to identify these agglomeration economies. To operationalize the index decomposition the paper proposes an empirical methodology that is based on frequency estimator approach, which is applied across time periods. The approach is tested by numerical simulation and by application to a dataset on the location of new economic activity across British regions in the form of investment by foreign-owned plants. Overall, the results support the approach and indicate that the <b>temporal</b> <b>scope</b> of a spillover is on average about five years...|$|R

2500|$|Leslie J.

However, Dever's {{definition of the}} <b>temporal</b> <b>scope</b> of the field in What Did the Biblical Writers Know, and When Did They Know It?

40|$|Abstract. Documents and {{queries are}} rich in {{temporal}} features, both at the meta-level and at the content-level. We exploit this information to define <b>temporal</b> <b>scope</b> similarities between documents and queries in metric spaces. Our experiments show that the proposed metrics can be very effective for modeling the relevance for different search tasks, and provide insights into an inherent asymmetry in temporal query semantics. Moreover, we propose a simple ranking model that com-bines the <b>temporal</b> <b>scope</b> similarity with traditional keyword similarities. We experimentally show {{that it is not}} worse than traditional keyword-based rankings for non-temporal queries, and that it improves the overall effectiveness for time-based queries. ...|$|R

40|$|The Ellison and Glaeser (1997) {{index of}} {{geographical}} concentration distinguishes between natural advantages and spillovers {{as sources of}} industrial agglomeration, but a well-known „observational equivalence ‟ means that {{little is known about}} the relative importance of these. This paper uses the differences in the <b>temporal</b> <b>scope</b> of these processes to decompose the index, and proposes a method of measurement based on frequency estimator approach of Maurel and Sédillot (1999). The approach stands-up well to simulation, and when applied to a dataset on the location of foreign investment. It suggests that the sources contribute about equally to geographic concentration over a 3 -year time horizon, and that spillovers decay and last about 3 to 5 years on average. As a corollary it is shown that the unadjusted index of geographic concentration reveals comparatively little about the presence of spillovers.

40|$|Most {{previous}} work in information extraction from text {{has focused on}} named-entity recognition, entity linking, and relation extraction.

The system employs language models consisting of patterns automat-ically bootstrapped from Wikipedia sentences that contain the main entity of a page and slot-fillers extracted from the corresponding infoboxes. This proposed system achieves state-of-the-art results on 6 out of 7 relations on the benchmark Text Analysis Conference 2013 dataset for temporal slot filling (TSF), and out-performs the next best system in the TAC 2013 evaluation by more than 10 points. ...|$|R
