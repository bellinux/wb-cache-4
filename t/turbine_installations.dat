A {{mathematical}} model is proposed for predicting static water resistance of offshore wind <b>turbine</b> <b>installation</b> vessel and {{to calculate the}} resistance of {{a certain type of}} offshore wind <b>turbine</b> <b>installation</b> vessel. In order to verify the efficiency of this {{mathematical model}}, the comparison between results calculated by it and actual model test has been made. The conclusion indicates that the estimation method is reliable, and it can provide reference for resistance calculation of similar type vessels. Currently in China, there are no references for the effective prediction and calculation of the resistance for offshore wind <b>turbine</b> <b>installation</b> vessel.

5000|$|Small wind {{turbines}} added {{a total of}} 17.3 MW of generating capacity throughout the United States in 2008, according to the American Wind Energy Association (AWEA).

AWEA's [...] "2009 Small Wind Global Market Study", published in late 2009 May, credited the increase in part to greater manufacturing volumes, as the industry was able to attract enough private investment to finance manufacturing plant expansions. It also credited rising electricity prices and greater public awareness of wind technologies {{for an increase in}} residential sale. But a poll of small wind manufacturers found that the growth in 2008 might be only a glimmer of things to come, as the companies projected a 30-fold growth in the U.S. small wind market within as little as five years, despite the global recession. The U.S. small wind industry also benefits from the global market, as it controls about half of the global market share.
