50|$|A {{number of}} birds {{are found in}} the {{mountains}} including Egyptian and lappet-faced vultures (<b>Torgos</b> <b>tracheliotus).</b> Mammals include mountain gazelles (Gazella gazella) and the Arabian tahr (Arabitragus jayakari), which is endemic to the Al Hajar. Other endemic species include a number of geckos and lizards: Asaccus montanus, Asaccus platyrhynchus and a sub-species of Wadi Kharrar rock gecko (Pristurus gasperetti gallagheri) are found only in Oman while Musandam leaf-toed gecko (Asaccus caudivolvulus), Gallagher's leaf-toed gecko (Asaccus gallagheri), Oman rock gecko (Pristurus celirrimus), Jayakar lizard (Lacerta jayakari) and Omman's lizard (Lacerta cyanura) are found only in the Al Hajar mountains. The endangered Arabian leopard (Panthera pardus nimr) is still found in the Musandam Peninsula, according to records of the Oman Ministry of Environment.|$|E
5000|$|The park {{is renowned}} for its {{abundance}} of birds with some 300 different species in total. Pallid harrier (Circus macrourus) and lesser kestrel (Falco naumanni) are occasionally recorded {{and there are a}} few isolated records for lappet-faced vulture (<b>Torgos</b> <b>tracheliotus).</b> Fox kestrel (Falco alopex) is not uncommon, while the African swallow-tailed kite (Chelictinia riocourii) is a not uncommon dry season visitor. The booted eagle (Hieraaetus pennatus) has also been recorded here. BirdLife notes that [...] "the Pendjari is notable for large conspicuous species such as African openbill stork (Anastomus lamelligerus), Abdim's stork (Ciconia abdimii), saddle-billed stork (Ephippiorhynchus senegalensis), and seasonally, flocks of up to 60 European white storks (Ciconia ciconia). The African fish eagle (Haliaeetus vocifer) and Pel's fishing-owl (Scotopelia peli) can also be found." ...|$|E
40|$|This Action Plan {{provides}} a framework within which the conservation status of globally Vulnerable Lappet-faced Vulture <b>Torgos</b> <b>tracheliotus</b> may be improved. It sets out conservation strategies aimed at stabilising and/or increasing the Lappet-faced Vulture populations across their range. The major outputs are: the distribution, population size and trends of the species determined {{and the impact of}} human activities at key sites minimised. The population and status in many range countries is poorly known, and further information is both sought and welcomed. Representatives of stakeholder groups, that included governmental and non-governmental organisations from the species' range states, developed the plan. The various stakeholders were assigned roles and responsibilities in the implementation of the 5 -year plan. There are various opportunities and on-going projects that will enhance the implementation of the plan within the range states. However, there are also risks that may hamper implementation, and should therefore be borne in mind. Under the umbrella of the African Species Working Group, a group of conservationists met and then worked to compile this action plan. This group with assistance from the African Species Working Group Coordinator, will work to coordinate the implementation of this plan, hand-in-hand with the existing Vulture Study Group. The process of developing this plan was participatory and interactive, to provide an on-the-job training opportunity for African Conservationists to develop their skills in species conservation approaches. The skills and experience gained will enable them to train others so that the process can continue to build the capacity in Africa. Ultimately, many conservationists will be able to produce Species Action Plans at national or international levels for their priority species. The involvement of government representatives will, in addition to stimulating the production of the relevant priority national plans, facilitate the process of incorporating the new species conservation approaches into overall national biodiversity conservation frameworks and strategies. ...|$|E

This portfolio {{was published}} by the Field Museum of Natural History in 1930 in an edition consisting of a slipcased set of 32 separate 10 ” × 12 ” lithographed plates on 10 -point (approximately) natural-white stock. Each image was backed with a brief description. The images were presented within warm gray borders of approximately 1 ”. Some plates were vertical, others horizontal, depending on the image; the descriptions on the back reflected {{the orientation of the}} front image. The portfolio also included a 4 -page folio leaflet containing a 3 -page essay by Wilfred Osgood and a “List of Subjects. ” The electronic edition presented here was prepared from a copy of the original published portfolio held by the Special Collections Department of the University of Nebraska-Lincoln Libraries. This copy was received as a gift from Mrs. C. Harold Claytor. Scanning was done by the Center for Digital Research in the Humanities. Images were scanned at 300 dpi and saved as RGB files in JPEG format. Color corrections were made using Adobe Photoshop and the layouts were done in Adobe InDesign by Paul Royster of the Office of Scholarly Communication. The electronic edition is presented as 12 ” × 12 ” pages to allow for both vertical and horizontal images. The reverse-side descriptions, originally printed in medium gray, are shown here in black. All images are shown at their original size. Some slight damage to edges of the borders of a few plates have been electronically restored. The portfolio was published without copyright notice, making it public domain according to the law in force at that time...|$|E
