Cuoco also said she only understood her performance on the show after watching the final cuts of the episodes with the special effects and animations; she explained: [...] "But when you are working, you are waiting and waiting, and then things are invisible, and things are being thrown, and nothing's in your hand, and I'm like so confused and always asking everyone, 'What's happening?'". She also voiced her contempt for the outfits given to her for the character's magical transformations. She said she cried when she first saw her superhero costume for the season eight episode [...] "Battle of the Hexes", which originally included a cape.

She first started writing songs for In the Zone during the Dream Within a Dream Tour. Spears commented about writing while touring, [...] "The {{only thing that}} was scary {{to me is that}} I didn't know if they were good. [...] You can’t trust anybody. You have to go with your feelings." [...] Spears commented that she was an autobiographical songwriter, although not to the point she felt self-exploited. Following the end of the tour, Spears invited her friend and backing vocalist Annet Artani to her home in Los Angeles. They started writing songs at the piano, and shortly after, they traveled to Lake Como in Lombardy, Italy. Among the tracks they worked on was [...] "Everytime", which Artani confirmed to be written as a response to Justin Timberlake's [...] "Cry Me a River", as well as [...] "Shine", written by Spears about her sister Jamie Lynn, which was left unfinished. Earnest recording of the album began in May 2003. Spears commented that although she did not know initially what direction she wanted to go with the album, she took <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> <b>with</b> different producers and to find those who she had chemistry with. The first song recorded for In the Zone was [...] "Touch of My Hand", and Spears said it [...] "really did provide a balance {{for the rest of the}} record. We just went from there." [...] Following the recording sessions for [...] "Everytime", Spears complimented Sigsworth, saying, [...] "I just basically told him exactly how I wanted the song to sound. And he was so amazing because there's a lot of producers you tell them things and they don't get it. And you're like oh, that's not the right way. He got it just right. He was amazing." ...|$|E

6000|$|Thus, for instance: {{if you are}} a young lady, {{and employ}} a certain number of sempstresses for a given time, in making a given number of simple and {{serviceable}} dresses, suppose, seven; of which you can wear one yourself for half the winter, and give six away to poor girls who have none, you are spending your money unselfishly. But if you employ the same number of sempstresses for the same number of days, in making four, or five, or six beautiful flounces for your own ball-dress--flounces which will clothe no one but yourself, and which you will yourself be unable to wear at more than one ball--you are employing your money selfishly. You have maintained, indeed, in each case, the same number of people; but in the one case you have directed their labour to the service of the community; in the other case you have consumed it wholly upon yourself. I don't say you are never to do so; I don't say you ought not sometimes to think of yourselves only, and to make yourselves as pretty as you can; only do not confuse coquettishness with benevolence, nor cheat yourselves into thinking that all the finery you can wear is so much put into the hungry mouths of those beneath you: it is not so; it is what you yourselves, whether you will or no, must sometimes instinctively feel it to be--it is what those who stand shivering in the streets, forming a line to watch you as you step out of your carriages, know it to be; those fine dresses do not mean that so much has been put into their mouths, but that so much has been taken out of their mouths. The real politico-economical signification of every one of those beautiful toilettes, is just this; that you have had a certain number of people put for a certain number of days wholly under your authority, by the sternest of slave-masters--hunger and cold; and you have said to them, [...] "I will feed you, indeed, and clothe you, and give you fuel for so many days; but during those days you shall work for me only: your little brothers need clothes, but you shall make none for them: your sick friend needs clothes, but you shall make none for her: you yourself will soon need another, and a warmer dress; but you shall make none for yourself. You shall make nothing but lace and roses for me; for this fortnight to come, you shall work at the patterns and petals, and then I will crush and consume them away in an hour." [...] You will perhaps answer--"It may not be particularly benevolent to do this, and we won't call it so; but at any rate we do no wrong in taking their labour when we pay them their wages: if we pay for their work {{we have a right to}} it." [...] No;--a thousand times no. The labour which you have paid for, does indeed become, by the act of purchase, your own labour: you have bought the hands and the time of those workers; they are, by right and justice, your own hands, your own time. But, have you a right to spend your own <b>time,</b> <b>to</b> <b>work</b> <b>with</b> your own hands, only for your own advantage?--much more, when, by purchase, you have invested your own person with the strength of others; and added to your own life, a part of the life of others?
