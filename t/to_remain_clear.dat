2500|$|Scarponi {{finished}} 15th {{overall in}} the Vuelta a España, taking a best stage placing of second on the fifteenth stage at Peyragudes; he {{had been part of}} a 28-man breakaway, but was the last rider <b>to</b> <b>remain</b> <b>clear</b> of the field, after Alexandre Geniez had finished three minutes ahead as the stage winner. Thereafter, Scarponi won the delayed Gran Premio della Costa Etruschi, his first success since his belated 2011 Giro d'Italia victory; he had attacked from the lead group with [...] to go and led home a rare 1–2–3 success for his team, as Diego Ulissi and Filippo Pozzato completed the podium. Scarponi was selected for the UCI Road World Championships in Florence, Italy, where he finished sixteenth – and second-best Italian behind Vincenzo Nibali – in the road race.

Halfway around the circuit, the peloton had the lead quartet in their sights with only Vanlandschoot making an effort <b>to</b> <b>remain</b> <b>clear</b> {{and tried to make}} a solo attempt to stay off the front until the finish. Vanlandschoot's bid was ultimately unsuccessful, as [...] and [...] moved some of their riders forward in the hopes of setting up a sprint finish for their respective sprinters.

Keukeleire finished within the peloton to maintain his overall lead, and was hoping to maintain the lead until Saturday's penultimate stage time trial.|$|E

5000|$|The Barren Fork River {{is named}} for the [...] "Barrens" [...] area of Middle Tennessee. This area {{comprises}} much of Coffee County, western Warren County, and southeastern Cannon County. The area was first named this by the early settlers, who were surprised to find a largely unforested area {{in the midst of}} what was generally a dense hardwood forest surrounding it. Several theories have been suggested as to its origin. The area is somewhat swampy, however; it is too moist for many types of hardwood trees that cannot survive long periods of [...] "wet feet". It is suggested that it was cleared by Native Americans, in part using fire, so that the resulting open area would improve grazing conditions for elk, deer, and buffalo and thus improve hunting, and that they, like their white successors, also used the area for agriculture. Since {{only a limited number of}} native hardwood trees could grow in the area, it was relatively easy for the area <b>to</b> <b>remain</b> <b>cleared</b> once it had initially had much of its woody vegetation removed.|$|R

6000|$|So earnest {{a desire}} to please was {{touching}} in {{a man who could}} so easily have knocked one down. He looked after the fire and had an opinion on the draught of the stove without my asking him, and I could see that he thought many of my arrangements not half knowing. I remember telling him that if I were only rich I'd offer him a salary to come and teach me how to live. Sometimes he gave a random sigh of which the essence might have been: [...] "Give me even such a bare old-barrack as this, and I'd do something with it!" [...] When I wanted to use him he came alone; which was an illustration of the superior courage of women. His wife could bear her solitary second floor, and she was in general more discreet; showing by various small reserves that she was alive to the propriety of keeping our relations markedly professional--not letting them slide into sociability. She wished it <b>to</b> <b>remain</b> <b>clear</b> that she and the Major were employed, not cultivated, and if she approved of me as a superior, who could be kept in his place, she never thought me quite good enough for an equal.|$|E

Oregon settlers complained that Modoc warriors roamed the countryside raiding the homesteads; they petitioned Meacham to return the Modoc to the Klamath Reservation. In part, the Modoc raided for food; the US did not adequately supply them. Captain Jack and his band did better in their old territory with hunting.|$|R
40|$|As Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) {{make their}} way to {{mainstream}} aviation operations within the National Airspace System (NAS), research efforts are underway to develop a safe and effective environment for their integration into the NAS. Detect and Avoid (DAA) systems are required to account for the lack of "eyes in the sky" due to having no human on-board the aircraft. The current NAS relies on pilot's vigilance and judgement <b>to</b> <b>remain</b> Well <b>Clear</b> (CFR 14 91. 113) of other aircraft. RTCA SC- 228 has defined DAA Well Clear (DAAWC) to provide a quantified Well Clear volume to allow systems to be designed and measured against. Extended research efforts have been conducted to understand and quantify system requirements needed to support a UAS pilot's ability <b>to</b> <b>remain</b> well <b>clear</b> of other aircraft. The efforts have included developing and testing sensor, algorithm, alerting, and display requirements. More recently, sensor uncertainty and uncertainty mitigation strategies have been evaluated. This paper discusses results and lessons learned from an End-to-End Verification and Validation (E 2 -V 2) simulation study of a DAA system representative of RTCA SC- 228 's proposed Phase I DAA Minimum Operational Performance Standards (MOPS). NASA Langley Research Center (LaRC) was called upon to develop a system that evaluates a specific set of encounters, in a variety of geometries, with end-to-end DAA functionality including the use of sensor and tracker models, a sensor uncertainty mitigation model, DAA algorithmic guidance in both vertical and horizontal maneuvering, and a pilot model which maneuvers the ownship aircraft <b>to</b> <b>remain</b> well <b>clear</b> from intruder aircraft, having received collective input from the previous modules of the system. LaRC developed a functioning batch simulation and added a sensor/tracker model from the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) William J. Hughes Technical Center, an in-house developed sensor uncertainty mitigation strategy, and implemented a pilot model similar to one from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology's Lincoln Laboratory (MIT/LL). The resulting simulation provides the following key parameters, among others, {{to evaluate the effectiveness of}} the MOPS DAA system: severity of loss of well clear (SLoWC), alert scoring, and number of increasing alerts (alert jitter). The technique, results, and lessons learned from a detailed examination of DAA system performance over specific test vectors and encounter cases during the simulation experiment will be presented in this paper...|$|R

50|$|A stand {{guidance}} {{system is a}} system which gives information to a pilot attempting to park an aircraft at an airport stand, usually via visual methods, leading to the term Visual Docking Guidance System (VDGS) and also A-VDGS (the A standing for advanced) This allows them <b>to</b> <b>remain</b> <b>clear</b> of obstructions and ensures that jetways can reach the aircraft.|$|E

50|$|In the United States, most {{controlled}} airspace below 10000 ft MSL requires a pilot flying under VFR to remain 500 ft below a cloud ceiling {{and to maintain}} 3 smi km visibility. However, outside of airport control zones and major terminal areas, {{controlled airspace}} typically begins at 1200 ft above ground level; below that is uncontrolled (class G) airspace, where (at that altitude) a pilot is required only <b>to</b> <b>remain</b> <b>clear</b> of clouds and to maintain 1 smi km visibility.|$|E
40|$|The FAA-sponsored Sense and Avoid Workshop for Unmanned Aircraft Systems (UAS) {{defines the}} concept of sense and avoid for remote pilots as "the {{capability}} of a UAS <b>to</b> <b>remain</b> well <b>clear</b> from and avoid collisions with other airborne traffic. " Hence, a rigorous definition of well clear is fundamental to any separation assurance concept for the integration of UAS into civil airspace. This paper presents a family of well-clear boundary models based on the TCAS II Resolution Advisory logic. For these models, algorithms that predict well-clear violations along aircraft current trajectories are provided. These algorithms are analogous to conflict detection algorithms but instead of predicting loss of separation, they predict whether well-clear violations will occur during a given lookahead time interval. Analytical techniques are used to study the properties and relationships satisfied by the models...|$|R

50|$|Under CARs, HFRS {{falls under}} Class D operations, {{which is that}} it {{involves}} a jettisonable human external load suspended beneath the landing gear of the helicopter.

Given the benefits of extending a rescuer below the aircraft, thus allowing the aircraft <b>to</b> <b>remain</b> <b>clear</b> of obstacles while a rescue/insertion/extraction is performed, it is evident that this is an essential life saving tool. This system is commonly referred to as longline rescue and involves a rescuer being attached to the bottom of a longline and being slung to a rescue site.
