40|$|Pigeons kept in two cages with screens which {{deflect the}} wind {{clockwise}} (CW) or counter-clockwise (CCW) show corresponding deflections in their initial orientation. In {{order to determine}} the nature of this phenomenon, experimental birds were treated as follows: The anterior commissure of the forebrain (AC), which mediates the interhemispheric transfer of olfactory input was sectioned; After surgery, each experimental bird was kept alternately in a CW cage with its right nostril plugged, and in a CCW cage with its left nostril plugged; the two treatments were alternated every 3 days for 69 days before test releases began. In 23 out of 28 cases <b>the</b> <b>experimentals</b> showed CW deflections when released with the right nostril plugged and CCW deflections when released with the left nostril plugged. The controls were intact, and their nostrils were free in each phase of the experiment. They were subdivided into two groups: one group was kept in the CW cage when <b>the</b> <b>experimentals</b> were in <b>the</b> same cage, the other group in the CCW cage when <b>the</b> <b>experimentals</b> stayed there. In the remaining time each group was kept in a fenced loft. The behaviour of controls demonstrated that <b>the</b> time <b>the</b> <b>experimentals</b> had spent in each kind of deflector cage had been long enough to produce the corresponding deflections in initial orientation. Control experiments were then performed on pigeons with the AC sectioned (2 series) and on intact birds (1 series), both maintained in lofts which did not deflect the wind, and released with one nostril plugged. They did not show deflections similar to those of <b>the</b> <b>experimentals.</b> (ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} the effects of participation in a Computer-Assisted instructional program (CAI) on fourth grade student attitudes and achievement in reading and mathematics. This study, based on Campbell and Stanley's quasiexperimental design 10, utilized Diascriptive Reading software for the CAI mathematics group and Milliken Math Sequences software for the CAI mathematics group and was completed by 242 students. The time span between pretests and posttests was seven months. Iowa Tests of Basic Skills, Level 10, Form 7 / 8 was used for achievement testing and Estes Attitude Scale was used for attitude testing. Analysis of covariance was used to determine significance at the. 05 level. The findings for this study were: 1. Reading Comprehension posttest scores were significantly higher for the control group than for <b>the</b> reading <b>experimental</b> group; 2. Reading Comprehension posttest scores were not significantly higher for boys than for girls within <b>the</b> reading <b>experimental</b> group; 3. Total math posttest scores were significantly higher for <b>the</b> mathematics <b>experimental</b> group than for the control group; 4. Concepts and Computation math subsets posttest scores were significantly higher for <b>the</b> mathematics <b>experimental</b> group than for the control group.
