Sucia Island.}} Instead of destroying the Geneforge, the pair agreed to spirit away the technology and experiment in private. Several of the intelligent serviles who lived on Sucia were brought along; a number of Shapers also followed Barzahl. Zakary remained in Drypeak to provide a front for the experimentation and rogue serviles which lay beyond the tunnel. Barzahl moved further into the valleys to build settlements and run experiments. Repeated use of the canisters can render the user cold, detached and possibly mad. When Zakary saw this happening to Barzahl the pair argued, Zakary regretted his part in the deceit. This occurred a year before the arrival of Shanti and <b>the</b> <b>apprentice,</b> Zakary had lost contact with Barzahl since the argument.

Serviles, the Shapers' slaves created from life essence, show abnormal intelligence and self-awareness. While still reeling from the revelation of what lies beyond Drypeak, the Shaper apprentice discovers that Shanti has disappeared during one of her escapes from her armed escorts, her necklace lay broken on the grass outside the tunnel.

40|$|Over {{the last}} 30 years or so, {{there has been}} growing {{international}} interest in the "infon-nal sector" {{of the economy in}} developing countries, and there is now the recognition that to operate successfully as artisans in the informal sector, "apprentices" require a range of knowledge and skills. The general aim of the present, qualitative study, was to investigate how apprentices in informal sector enterprises in two trades (the Motor Vehicle trade and the Tie-dye trade) in The Gambia learn at the workplace and how such learning was facilitated. Twenty enterprises were selected for the study, ten in each trade. A variety of data collection methods were employed, namely, (a) individual, semistructured interviews of the entrepreneurs (who owned these enterprises), and of <b>the</b> <b>apprentices,</b> (b) observations of <b>the</b> tradespersons and <b>apprentices</b> at <b>the</b> workplace, (c) accounts of "critical events", and (d) documentary studies. The study has shown that (a) the tradespersons did not demonstrate to <b>the</b> <b>apprentices</b> <b>the</b> procedures for the tasks that they were undertaking, (b) <b>the</b> <b>apprentices</b> were not allowed to practise on the tasks that the tradespersons were contracted to und(rtake; (c) <b>the</b> <b>apprentices</b> practised their skills privately in their leisure time. (d) the tradespersons did not explain to <b>the</b> <b>apprentices</b> <b>the</b> theories underpinning the technical procedures; and for <b>the</b> <b>apprentices,</b> <b>the</b> term "theory" referred to the technical procedures, as such, rather than to the scientific and technological concepts and principles underpinning the procedures, (e) although <b>the</b> <b>apprentices</b> were often outwardly passive they did observe closely the tradespersons at work and made associative links with their own previous knowledge and experience. What has also emerged from the study is that apprentices' learning at the workplace in the informal sector is: (a) a multi-dimensional process, largely self-motivated and conditioned by the rigid hierarchical structure of the workplace. (b) (i) productivity-driven, (ii) atheoretical, (iii) unplanned, (iv) unstructured, (v) facilitated through role modelling. The study compared the concepts of learning which emerged from the study with the traditional concepts of learning and teaching in Vocational Training Institutions. This study has also shown that the tradespersons failed to assess formally competent performance at the workplace. There was no end-of-apprenticeship assessment for <b>the</b> <b>apprentices</b> in <b>the</b> Tie-dye trade; and in the Motor Vehicle trade, the assessment was adhoc. Importantly too, from the entrepreneurs' perspective, the workplace was about production and not about <b>apprentice</b> learning. <b>The</b> tradespersons were expected to concentrate on their jobs and not on training, {{in sharp contrast to the}} apprentices' expectation that the tradespersons should concentrate on skills training...|$|R
