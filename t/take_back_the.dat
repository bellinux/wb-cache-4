Black Lives Matter was a featured part of the <b>Take</b> <b>Back</b> <b>the</b> Night event in Toronto.|$|E
5|$|In the 1830s, the District's {{southern}} {{territory of}} Alexandria went into economic decline {{partly due to}} neglect by Congress. The city of Alexandria was a major market in the American slave trade, and pro-slavery residents feared that abolitionists in Congress would end slavery in the District, further depressing the economy. Alexandria's citizens petitioned Virginia to <b>take</b> <b>back</b> <b>the</b> land it had donated to form the District, through {{a process known as}} retrocession.|$|E
5|$|One notorious tengu {{from the}} 12th century was himself {{the ghost of}} an emperor.

When he later raised the Hōgen Rebellion to <b>take</b> <b>back</b> <b>the</b> country from Emperor Go-Shirakawa, he was {{defeated}} and exiled to Sanuki Province in Shikoku. According to legend he died in torment, having sworn to haunt the nation of Japan as a great demon, and thus became a fearsome tengu with long nails and eyes like a kite's.|$|E

5|$|The {{breakaway}} {{was eventually}} caught {{at the bottom}} of the final climb. Valverde, who had crashed earlier in the day, was the first to attack. As soon as he was caught, his teammate Nairo Quintana put in his own attack. These attacks dropped Chris Froome from the front group. Dumoulin was the next to attack, seeking to <b>take</b> <b>back</b> <b>the</b> race lead from Chaves. Chaves and Quintana initially followed him, but were soon dropped. Valverde was also unable to follow the pace, but Froome had kept a steady pace and by this point was leading the chase of Dumoulin.|$|E

Jake {{shatters}} the enchanted mirror in the tower, preventing the Queen from completing the spell that will restore her youth. With {{the last of his}} strength, Angelika's father destroys the rest of the mirror by jumping out of the window with it; and Will, attempting to save the Queen, tries to <b>take</b> <b>back</b> <b>the</b> mirror and falls with him, and both men are killed.|$|E
5|$|A counterattack to <b>take</b> <b>back</b> <b>the</b> {{airfield}} and Point 107 was organised for {{the following}} day at Hargest's headquarters. He was exhausted and {{had to take a}} quick nap before a conference to work out detailed plans for the counter-attack, much to the disgust of some of the other participants. Afterwards, he became pessimistic of the chances of success and unsuccessfully sought to have the attack called off. The attack did fail but Hargest, still well behind the frontlines, mistakenly believed it to be going well until he found that his brigade had returned to their starting positions. His pessimism began to affect Puttick, who asked Freyberg to allow the 5th Infantry Brigade to withdraw, which it duly did. This began an eventual retreat and evacuation from Crete on 31 May, with Hargest flying out for Egypt by seaplane, his brigade following by sea.|$|E

George manages to covertly <b>take</b> <b>back</b> <b>the</b> manuscript, which he examines with Anna Maria. George figures out that the fortified city on it must be Istanbul.|$|E
5|$|Andrea Dworkin is {{most often}} remembered {{for her role as}} a speaker, writer, and activist in the feminist anti-pornography movement. In February 1976, Dworkin took a leading role in {{organizing}} public pickets of Snuff in New York City and, during the fall, joined Adrienne Rich, Grace Paley, Gloria Steinem, Shere Hite, Lois Gould, Barbara Deming, Karla Jay, Letty Cottin Pogrebin, Robin Morgan, and Susan Brownmiller in attempts to form a radical feminist antipornography group. Members of this group would go on to found Women Against Pornography in 1979, but by then Dworkin had begun to distance herself from the group over differences in approach. Dworkin spoke at the first <b>Take</b> <b>Back</b> <b>the</b> Night march in November 1978, and joined 3,000 women in a march through the red-light district of San Francisco.|$|E

5|$|Bob {{attempts}} to rehire his children the next day, {{explaining that he}} now realizes {{that he is a}} better parent than his distant, alcoholic father, only to discover that they have found other work. A customer of the farm delivery service later walks into the restaurant looking for Tina, leaving behind a box of blueberries. Bob and his wife Linda (John Roberts) discover marijuana hidden in the box and set off to find the children, with Mickey leading them to the farm's location. As they arrive and <b>take</b> <b>back</b> <b>the</b> children, a SWAT team– led by the aforementioned customer, who is actually an undercover DEA agent– shows up and arrests the hippies. The scene cuts to Wagstaff School, where Louise has narrated the episode's events to her class for her report on how she spent her summer vacation.|$|E
5|$|Farleigh Hungerford Castle was {{captured}} by a Royalist unit in 1643, following a successful campaign by the King's forces across the south-west. The castle was taken without a fight by Colonel John Hungerford, a half-brother of Edward, who installed a garrison that then supported itself by pillaging the surrounding countryside. Several Parliamentary raids against Farleigh Hungerford were undertaken during 1644, but they failed to <b>take</b> <b>back</b> <b>the</b> castle. By 1645, however, the Royalist cause was close to military collapse; Parliamentary forces began to mop up the remaining Royalist garrisons in the south-west, and on 15 September they reached the castle. Colonel Hungerford immediately surrendered on good terms, and Sir Edward Hungerford peacefully reinstalled himself in the undamaged castle. As {{a result of this}} process, the castle escaped being slighted, or deliberately destroyed, by Parliament, unlike many other castles in the region, such as Nunney.|$|E
5|$|Henry's chief minister, Hubert de Burgh {{fell from}} power in 1232. His old rival, Peter des Roches, {{returned}} to England from the crusades in August 1231 and allied himself with Hubert's {{growing number of}} political opponents. He put the case to Henry that the Justiciar had squandered royal money and lands, and was responsible {{for a series of}} riots against foreign clerics. Hubert took sanctuary in Merton College Chapel, but Henry had him arrested and imprisoned in the Tower of London. Des Roches took over the King's government, backed by the Poitevin baronial faction in England, who saw this as a chance to <b>take</b> <b>back</b> <b>the</b> lands which they had lost to Hubert's followers in the previous decades.|$|E

5|$|The SAS team tracks down Al-Asad in Azerbaijan, and {{discover}} {{that he was}} working with Imran Zakhaev, the leader of the Ultranationalist party. The mission then flashes back to 1996, where Captain Price, who was a Lieutenant at the time, is sent alongside his commanding officer, Captain MacMillan, on a failed assassination attempt on Imran Zakhaev. After killing Al-Asad, the SAS team, with support from U.S. Force Recon and Russian loyalists, attempt to capture Zakhaev's son and learn his whereabouts. They ambush him, but he commits suicide. In response, Zakhaev seizes control of a nuclear launch facility. A joint operation is launched to <b>take</b> <b>back</b> <b>the</b> site, but Zakhaev launches intercontinental ballistic missiles at the U.S. eastern seaboard. The joint teams are able to breach the facility and remotely destroy the missiles before fleeing the area.|$|E
5|$|The stage 20 {{individual}} {{time trial}} {{was to be}} the Tour's final competitive stage, since its final stage is traditionally mostly ceremonial and only competitive at the sprint finish. Voeckler's position was likely secure, being a minute and 13 seconds behind Evans and a minute and 21 seconds ahead of Damiano Cunego, both time gaps unlikely to be recouped due to Voeckler's and Cunego's limited time trial skills. However, Rolland's position as best young rider remained in play due to his minute and 33 seconds advantage over Taaramäe, and Taaramäe's time trial abilities well superior to Rolland's. Rolland rode one of the best time trials of his career to finish 21st. Taaramäe finished tenth, and took back 47 seconds, but it was insufficient to <b>take</b> <b>back</b> <b>the</b> white jersey. Eight of the nine Team Europcar riders completed the Tour, with the lone exception being Kern who had crashed out of stage 5. Voeckler finished fourth overall and Rolland tenth as the best young rider.|$|E
5|$|After being {{recalled}} to Constantinople in 1092, John {{was appointed}} to the post of megas doux, i.e. commander-in-chief of the Byzantine navy. Although he is the first known megas doux and hence usually credited as the first to hold the post, there is evidence of its existence already in late 1085, although its holder is not named. As megas doux, John was tasked with countering the naval threat posed by the Turkish emir Tzachas of Smyrna. Tzachas, formerly a Byzantine vassal, had built a fleet of his own and had seized several Aegean islands, raided others, and even had himself proclaimed basileus (emperor). After participating in a synod that condemned Leo of Chalcedon, John set forth to <b>take</b> <b>back</b> <b>the</b> island of Mytilene. His troops marched along the Anatolian coast to the point opposite the island, whence they crossed over. The fleet, which under Constantine Dalassenos had already recovered Chios, was to meet him there. The combined Byzantine force laid siege to Mytilene for three months, when Tzachas offered to cede the island in exchange for safe passage back to Smyrna. John agreed, but as the Turks set sail, Dalassenos, who with his ships had just arrived, attacked them. Tzachas managed to escape, but most of his fleet was captured or sunk. After this victory, John Doukas reinforced the defences of Mytilene and then led his fleet to recover the islands Tzachas had conquered, before returning to Constantinople.|$|E
