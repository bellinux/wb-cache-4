5|$|At 13:29 {{the first}} Ju 87s took off. By 13:45 all were in {{formation}} and beginning the 85-mile trip. Major Helmut Bode led III./StG 77 to Poling. He {{knew nothing of}} the technicalities of his target. Behind him was Hauptmann Alfons Orthofer's II./StG 77 bound for Ford. After them, Hauptmann Herbert Meisel's III Gruppe was heading on {{the left of the}} formation for Thorney Island. Hauptmann Walter Seigel's I./StG 3 headed for Gosport on the extreme left. Each Ju 87 was loaded with 550-lb bombs under the main fuselage and four 11-lb bombs and two under each wing. The Bf 109s would not take off for some time. The long trip and low speed of the Ju 87s meant there was plenty of <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>catch</b> up without burning fuel keeping close contact with the Stukas.|$|E
5|$|In most jumping spiders, {{the main}} eyes focus {{accurately}} on an object {{up to about}} 75cm away. However, P. schultzi does not react at all to objectives when the light is under 100lux. Between 100 and 500lux, it detects and approaches the objective from distances up to 6cm, from 500lux to 1500lux, its response distance increases gradually {{to a maximum of}} about 10cm, and stronger light causes no increase in the response distance. For comparison, Trite auricoma swivels towards a movement up to 75cm away and approaches targets from about 20cm. Perhaps P. schultzi gains little from being alerted to objectives at distances because this spider moves so slowly that it is very unlikely to reach a more distant target in <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>catch</b> it.|$|E
5|$|Picking {{up where}} Subspecies II leaves off, Bloodlust: Subspecies III (1994) finds Michelle {{deep in the}} catacombs with Radu's mother, who brings her son {{back from the dead}} with Michelle's blood and the enchanted dagger that killed him; Radu, his mother, and Michelle return to Castle Vladislas. Michelle {{promises}} to obey Radu if he teaches her everything that he knows. Radu takes Michelle out hunting so she can enhance her powers, while Mel contacts a former operative of the CIA for help. While trying to rescue Michelle, Radu's mother quickly kills Mel's CIA friend, and knocks Mel unconscious. In an effort to get Michelle to stay with him forever, Radu kills his mother when she attacks Michelle. Becky arrives to save Michelle, but before everyone leaves, Michelle takes a gun from Becky, which contains silver bullets, and shoots Radu. The rising sun slows Michelle, so she is placed inside a body bag that was brought along; the delay allows Radu <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>catch</b> up to the group. Wanting the Bloodstone, which was taken by Michelle, Radu attempts to barter the group's lives in exchange for it. Becky throws it over the roof's edge, and when Radu attempts to follow it he is engulfed in the rays of the Sun. Radu's body bursts into flames and falls from the castle wall. Becky and the group make it to their car and drive off. Radu's burning corpse is left smoldering and impaled on tree branches, with his burning blood dropping to the ground; the flames go out and the blood morphs into new subspecies.|$|E

25|$|The Mauryas firstly {{looked at}} forests as resources. For them, the most {{important}} forest product was the elephant. Military might in those times depended not only upon horses and men but also battle-elephants; these {{played a role in}} the defeat of Seleucus, one of Alexander's former generals. The Mauryas sought to preserve supplies of elephants since it was cheaper and took less <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>catch,</b> tame and train wild elephants than to raise them. Kautilya's Arthashastra contains not only maxims on ancient statecraft, but also unambiguously specifies the responsibilities of officials such as the Protector of the Elephant Forests.|$|E
25|$|On lap 36, Schumacher {{took the}} lead on aggregate, though he was still behind on the track. He pulled away rapidly, but he needed to pit again whereas Hill did not. On lap 40 Schumacher made his second stop, rejoining 15 seconds behind Hill on aggregate. Renowned for his ability in the wet and on fresher tyres, Schumacher closed in on Hill {{at a rate of}} over a second a lap, but ran out of <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>catch</b> him. Hill won by 3.3s to reduce his deficit in the Drivers' Championship to 1 point, as well as giving Williams a 5-point lead in the Constructors' Championship going into the last race, ahead of Schumacher, Alesi, Mansell, Irvine and Frentzen.|$|E
25|$|After a vain protest to Codrington, Ibrahim {{decided to}} act. On 1 October, he {{despatched}} a naval squadron {{to reinforce the}} Patras garrison. It was intercepted by Codrington's squadron {{at the entrance to}} the gulf, and forced to return to Navarino, shadowed by Codrington. Ibrahim tried again on the night of 3/4 October, this time leading the squadron in person. Using the darkness, he succeeded in slipping past the British picket ship unobserved, but was prevented from entering the gulf by a strong headwind. His squadron was obliged to anchor in the lee of Cape Papas and wait out the storm. This gave Codrington <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>catch</b> up, and the British squadron, after a whole day of fighting the wind, arrived off Papas on the evening of 4 October. Codrington fired a series of warning broadsides, and Ibrahim reluctantly decided to turn back.|$|E

25|$|In the 1840s, {{when the}} {{railways}} reached {{the coasts of}} Picardy, Normandy and Brittany, the market changed suddenly. The railway saw to the rapid transit aspect of the trade. The chasse-marée vehicle was redundant {{on the main road}} routes but was still used more locally. The important thing then was for the fisherman to make his landing in <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>catch</b> the early morning train which took the product to the morning markets in inland towns. In order to make a living, he had to see that with or without wind, he was ashore in time. He would therefore choose his fishing ground and the time of leaving it with a view to how the tide would carry him to the fish quay for 4 a.m. or thereabouts. Nonetheless, now that he was working to city time rather than the tide, the railway fish quay had to be accessible at all states of the tide. Over the years, the canneries took ever more of his catch so that missing the train did not represent a total loss.|$|E
25|$|On January 2, 1972, Gacy {{picked up}} 16-year-old Timothy Jack McCoy from Chicago's Greyhound bus terminal. Gacy took McCoy—who was {{traveling}} from Michigan to Omaha—on a sightseeing tour of Chicago, and then {{drove him to}} his home with the promise that he could spend the night and be driven back to the station in <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>catch</b> his bus. According to Gacy's later account of the murder, he awoke the following morning to find McCoy standing in his bedroom doorway with a kitchen knife in his hand. Gacy leapt from his bed and McCoy raised both arms {{in a gesture of}} surrender, tilting the knife upwards and accidentally cutting Gacy's forearm (Gacy had a scar on his arm to support this account). He then twisted the knife from McCoy's wrist, banged his head against his bedroom wall, kicked him against his wardrobe and walked towards him. McCoy then kicked him in the stomach and Gacy grabbed the youth, wrestled him to the floor, then stabbed him repeatedly in the chest as he straddled him with his body. Gacy claimed he then went to his kitchen and saw an opened carton of eggs and a slab of unsliced bacon on his kitchen table. McCoy had also set the table for two; he had walked into Gacy's room to wake him while absentmindedly carrying the kitchen knife in his hand. Gacy subsequently buried McCoy in his crawl space and later covered the youth's grave with a layer of concrete.|$|E
25|$|Injuries {{quickly became}} a challenge, as the team lost more players to {{injuries}} in their first preseason game than they did during the entire 22-game (preseason through playoffs) 1979 season. The secondary, particularly the safety position, was hit especially hard. Mark Cotney was lost for {{the season with a}} knee injury, Curtis Jordan suffered a broken collarbone, and Cedric Brown missed some time with a bruised shoulder. Cotney was expected to have lost his starting role to Colzie, but was valued as a backup. Jordan was lost to the team when, upon being activated from injured reserve later in the season, he was claimed off of procedural waivers by the Washington Redskins. An injury to Dave Reavis during the same game required arthroscopic surgery that left him sidelined into the regular season, and left the team with only two offensive tackles. As the team had opened training camp with a small roster, McKay had to trade draft picks to the Philadelphia Eagles and Los Angeles Rams to augment the roster with safeties Zac Henderson and Jeff Delaney, and tackle Rick Dozier. Ray Snell was also sidelined, for the second consecutive year, with severe headaches which were attributed to high blood pressure. Rick Berns, the 1979 third-round draft pick who was a capable runner but ineffective as a blocker and passer and who {{had never been able to}} recover from McKay's , was released late in camp. An unexpected shakeup of the receiving corps took place when ex-Steeler Theo Bell and ex-49er James Owens, both among the NFL's leading returners, were brought in with an eye toward improving the special teams. This resulted in the displacement of former FSU star Mike Shumann and original Buccaneer Isaac Hagins, who were promptly released with the hope that they would still have <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>catch</b> on with another team. Owens, an Olympic sprinter, came to the team in a late trade, as did Dallas Cowboys starting cornerback Aaron Mitchell, a tough tackler brought in to fill Cotney's role in run support. Adjustments were made to the team's defensive philosophy, with the secondary moving to a more aggressive style of play intended to cut down on opponents' success in the short passing game. The secondary also benefited from an improved pass rush, with Hugh Green's presence preventing blockers from concentrating their efforts on Lee Roy Selmon. James Wilder emerged as a reliable receiver, leading the team in catches during the preseason. McKay reported being happy with the team's preseason performance, saying that they were playing with the intensity and enthusiasm that had been missing the previous year.|$|E

500|$|The {{frontier}} settlers' {{response to}} the raids was generally with impotence. [...] The local militia were supported by some Continental Army regiments stationed in the area, but these forces generally could not muster in <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>catch</b> the raiders before they disappeared. [...] New York Governor George Clinton and militia commander Abraham Ten Broeck considered operations against the principal bases in the Iroquois territory used by the raiders, Onaquaga and Unadilla, early in the campaign, {{but it was not}} until an attack by Brant on the settlement of German Flatts (present-day Herkimer) on September 17 that an expedition was organized.|$|E

5000|$|The actual {{process of}} {{creating}} a silkscreen includes many steps. Since Clay's work was generally of actual places and things (with the occasional exception of some imaginative additions such as a Cinderellaesque figure running <b>to</b> <b>catch</b> the last train in his print titled [...] "Metropolitan Curfew"), his first step was taking photographic images of the subject at different <b>times</b> <b>to</b> <b>catch</b> it with different shadows, lighting and character. From the selected photographic image and the artists feeling to inspire the final print, a line drawing was created. From the line drawing, Clay had to decide what color went where and cut out individual stencils for each area and color choice. Each stencil was then applied to a silkscreen and one by one, ink forced through the screen onto the paper, eventually creating the finished piece. This individual silkscreen process was used for every color on every print.|$|R

500|$|... "Love for Sale" [...] is a {{song from}} Cole Porter's Broadway musical The New Yorkers.

Porter himself was actually pleased {{that it could not}} be sung over the air. In the original musical the song was first sung by Kathryn Crawford and later by Elizabeth Welch. The song took <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>catch</b> on as a jazz standard, possibly because it was 72 measures long. When Sidney Bechet recorded it in 1947, the song was not yet a regular jazz number.|$|E
500|$|Oliver Sava of The A.V.

[...] Sava applauded the fact that the episode delves into [...] "the demented relationship that develops between Ice King and his new wife", noting that while [...] "the writers could have easily depicted Ice King in a more unsympathetic light, ... the tragedy of the episode is that Ice King genuinely cares about his new wife." [...] He was also complimentary towards the song, describing it as a [...] "suitably bizarre Adventure Time version of 'A Whole New World'".|$|E

En route the South Pole party discovered the Beardmore Glacier (named after Shackleton's patron) [...] {{and became the}} first persons to see and travel on the South Polar Plateau. Their return journey to McMurdo Sound was a race against starvation, on half-rations for much of the way. At one point, Shackleton gave his one biscuit allotted for the day to the ailing Frank Wild, who wrote in his diary: [...] "All the money that was ever minted would not have bought that biscuit and the remembrance of that sacrifice will never leave me".
