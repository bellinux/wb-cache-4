Other methanol to gasoline processes do not incorporate durene reduction into the <b>core</b> <b>process,</b> and they require the implementation of an additional refining step.|$|R
40|$|This study {{investigates the}} impact of {{different}} organizational models {{for the management of}} non <b>core</b> <b>processes</b> in the facility management (FM) industry and seeks to suggest which is the best in terms of strategic and operative advantages and disadvantages. A literature analysis of the empirical evidence as to business process outsourcing and, in particular, as to the practices of the FM business sector has been carried out. The analysis has allowed us to identify a total of 11 organizational models that are a consequence of five different strategic approaches. A comprehensive classification framework of the strategies and organizational models on the basis of two dimensions is proposed: the organizational role of a non <b>core</b> <b>processes</b> manager (called a 'facility manager') and the typology of non core process/service providers. The framework enables the identification and the explanation of the main advantages and disadvantages of each strategy and to highlight how a company should coherently choose an organizational model on the basis of (a) the specialization/complexity of the non <b>core</b> <b>processes,</b> (b) the focus on <b>core</b> <b>processes,</b> (c) its inclination towards know how outsourcing, and (d) the desired level of autonomy in the management of non core processe...|$|R

40|$|Limited {{research}} studies examining the <b>core</b> <b>processes</b> involved in facilitating change within Dramatherapy exist. Many papers rely on individual accounts of clinical work and, taken in isolation, potential contributions {{of these studies}} remain unrecognised. This research took a grounded theory approach to synthesise individual accounts of Dramatherapy in the literature {{in order to develop}} a theory of the <b>core</b> <b>processes</b> at work. A systematic review using an electronic and hand search of key journals identified published articles that contained ‘thick’ descriptions of Dramatherapy sessions. Grounded theory methodology was implemented to generate a theory of the <b>core</b> <b>processes</b> using a systematically applied set of methods linking analysis with data collection. Thirteen eligible papers were identified. The theory constructed from the data proposed a meta-processes model of change. These meta-processes included working in the ‘here and now’, ‘establishing safety’, ‘working alongside’ ‘offering control and choice’ and being ‘actively involved’. The implications of the findings are discussed as are areas for development and future research...|$|R

30|$|Business process {{management}} {{is the art}} and science of overseeing how work is performed to ensure consistent outcomes and {{to take advantage of}} improvement opportunities (Dumas et al. 2013). From a lifecycle perspective, BPM involves the identification, definition, modeling, implementation, execution, monitoring, controlling, and improvement of processes (Dumas et al. 2013). Processes, as BPM’s unit of analysis, are structured sets of activities designed to create specific outputs (Davenport 1993). They split into core, support, and management processes (Armistead et al. 1999). <b>Core</b> <b>processes</b> create value for customers, support <b>processes</b> ensure that <b>core</b> <b>processes</b> continue to function, and management processes help plan, monitor, and control other processes (Harmon 2010).|$|R
