500|$|Dynamic assembly. This {{approach}} directly {{controls the}} kinetics of DNA self-assembly, specifying {{all of the}} intermediate steps in the reaction mechanism {{in addition to the}} final product. [...] This is done using starting materials which adopt a hairpin structure; these then assemble into the final conformation in a cascade reaction, in a specific order (see Strand displacement cascades below). [...] This approach has the advantage of proceeding isothermally, at a constant temperature. [...] This is in contrast to the thermodynamic approaches, which require a <b>thermal</b> <b>annealing</b> step where a temperature change is required to trigger the assembly and favor proper formation of the desired structure.|$|E
500|$|Cascades of strand {{displacement}} reactions can be {{used for}} either computational or structural purposes. [...] An individual strand displacement reaction involves revealing a new sequence in response to the presence of some initiator strand. [...] Many such reactions can be linked into a cascade where the newly revealed output sequence of one reaction can initiate another strand displacement reaction elsewhere. [...] This in turn allows for the construction of chemical reaction networks with many components, exhibiting complex computational and information processing abilities. [...] These cascades are made energetically favorable through the formation of new base pairs, and the entropy gain from disassembly reactions. Strand displacement cascades allow isothermal operation of the assembly or computational process, in contrast to traditional nucleic acid assembly's requirement for a <b>thermal</b> <b>annealing</b> step, where the temperature is raised and then slowly lowered to ensure proper formation of the desired structure. They can also support catalytic function of the initiator species, where less than one equivalent of the initiator can cause the reaction to go to completion.|$|E

These studies have been correlated to the traditional C-V, I-V, and transient current and charge techniques (TCT/TChT) after neutron radiation and subsequent <b>thermal</b> <b>anneals.</b> It {{has been found that}} the increases of the space charge density, N-eff, in irradiated detectors after <b>thermal</b> <b>anneals</b> (N-eff reverse anneal) correspond to the increases of deep levels in the silicon bandgap. In particular, increases of the double vacancy center (V-V and V-V [...] -) and/or C-i-O-i level have good correlations with the N-eff reverse anneal. It has also been observed that the leakage current of highly irradiated (Phi(n) > 10 (13) n/cm(2)) detectors increases after <b>thermal</b> <b>anneals,</b> which is different from the leakage current annealing behavior of slightly irradiated (Phi(n) < 10 (13) n/cm(2)) detectors.

In this paper, we investigated SiGeB epitaxy on different substrates including SiGe, Si:B, SiGeB and also dielectric films including ALD / CVD SiN, thermal/CVD SiO 2. For SiGeB epitaxy on crystallized film substrates, results show that Germanium would prevent Boron inter-diffusion between the substrate and the following deposited SiGeB. Growth Rate (GR) of the epitaxy e-SiGe film is also investigated. A combination of the SiGeB film concentration and GR study shows that Boron concentration and strain introduced by lattice mismatch between the substrate and the epitaxial film are two competitive factors to the GR. The film grows faster when Boron concentration is higher while larger strain would degrade the GR. Selectivity study shows that CVD SiN film have the best selectivity.

The above hypothesis based on miscibility does not fully explain the efficiency of the devices as solely pure amorphous phases of either donor or acceptor materials never exist within bulk heterojunction devices.
