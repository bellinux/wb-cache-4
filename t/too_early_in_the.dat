5|$|Immediately {{following}} the cyclone's onslaught, concerns arose amongst relief agencies and NGOs that {{the storm was}} either <b>too</b> <b>early</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> season or not damaging enough to dedicate {{a significant portion of}} disaster funds. Consequently, disagreements between prospective donors about the extent of emergency response resulted in delayed intervention. Post-storm assessments of the response to Bonita highlighted the need for increased coordination between agencies.|$|E

In the book, the spider-walk is somewhat more muted, consisting of Regan following Sharon around near the floor and flicking a snake-like tongue at her ankles.|$|E
25|$|Energy {{investment}} by workers {{required to produce}} reproductives is considerable. Newly emerged males and queens are no more functional than pupae; both depend heavily on solid prey brought in by workers, thus competing with larvae for food resources. As a result, worker quantity must remain high {{in order to maintain}} reproductive output. Workers must maintain food stores and defend the nest, and colonies whose work force diminishes <b>too</b> <b>early</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> colony’s life cycle will suffer a greater overall total loss in reproductives.|$|E
25|$|In {{response}} to the 2DS using one physical display divided to emulate two, Kyle Orland of Ars Technica believed that Nintendo had missed an opportunity to produce a full-screen gaming tablet using the 2DS's form factor; which would have enabled future games and apps to use the entire screen area (which he estimated to be around the 5-inch range used by phablets), still allow backwards compatibility with games designed for the folding 3DS and DS, and enhance the ability to port existing smartphone games to the platform. However, Orland also noted that introducing such a product could fragment Nintendo's portable gaming ecosystem for existing 3DS users—and that it was <b>too</b> <b>early</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 3DS's life for Nintendo to introduce a successor.|$|E

He defended himself, lost, appealed, and lost again. He was fined. In about 1929 Michaux reacted to new segregation laws in Virginia by intentionally inviting white congregants from Maryland to his Newport News church for prayer. Michaux was arrested, and again defended himself. He quoted Scripture and claimed that the Bible did not support racial segregation and that segregation must end at the church door.

25|$|Green, swing {{promoting}} {{and humid}} conditions {{sums up the}} construction of English pitches but everything depends on weather e.g. in summer it may behave like Indian pitches <b>too.</b> <b>Early</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> season, most batsmen {{have to be on}} their guard as English pitches prove to be most fickle, like the country's weather. Later in the summer, the pitches tend to get harder and lose their green. This makes the task easier for batsmen and only genuine fast bowlers like those bowling in range of (135–150km/h) and spinners can contain. Spinners prove less effective {{in the first half of}} the season and tend to play their part only in the second half. The humid conditions and little dust makes the grounds ideal place to practice reverse swing with a 50-over old ball. Of all grounds, The Oval is the most dangerous as the ball reverse swings most there. Another reason for this is traditionally it hosts the last international test match of a touring side in a summer.|$|E
25|$|Throughout production, CBS {{executives}} {{objected to}} the violent nature of the episode. They asked Guggenheim to make it less violent, but Guggenheim refused when possible. The executives also {{expressed concern about the}} overall plot of the episode. They felt that it would be <b>too</b> <b>early</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> series to show Charlie's emotional reaction to the violence. The executives expressed concern about Charlie's emotional state during a scene set in the Eppes family garage where Charlie recalled the violence. Heuton and Falacci agreed to remove the scene as they felt that the scene did not suit the plot. Citing the convention that the protagonist in a crime drama does not lose his or her gun, the network executives also felt that the loss of Don's gun was inappropriate for the series. Heuton and Falacci insisted on keeping it in the script, and series regular Rob Morrow also liked the idea of Don losing his gun. Heuton and Falacci assured the executives that Don would have an emotional reward {{at the end of the}} episode.|$|E
500|$|Actress Roxann Dawson was {{initially}} doubtful about the script, {{believing that the}} concept was occurring <b>too</b> <b>early</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> series for her to understand the character well enough to play two separate people. She said that she physically shook when reading the script for the first time, and found the episode an acting challenge that broadened her abilities and deepened her connection with the character. Dawson said: [...] "I was able to delineate these two sides that up until then were just metaphors." [...] She reasoned that the episode provided an opportunity [...] "to personify two aspects of this character".|$|E

40|$|Revenue {{management}} {{is the process}} of actively managing inventory or capacity to maximize revenues. The active management typically occurs through managerial levers such as price, promotion, or availability. We present a novel real options approach to revenue management that is specifically suited to the car rental business. We illustrate the concept with actual car rental data. The model produces minimally acceptable prices and inventory release quantities (number of cars available for rent at a given price) as a function of remaining time and available inventory. The pricing and inventory release recommendations of the developed model confirm earlier empirical analysis that suggested current practices discount <b>too</b> deeply <b>early</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> booking cycle...|$|R

While HuffPost's Daniel Wood felt that the Sévérine was killed <b>too</b> <b>early</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> film, he associated her death with {{the removal of the}} [...] "harmless chauvinism" [...] starting from Casino Royale, and better connected with Bond's emotionally deficient character. Wood acknowledged that the representation of female characters as [...] "commodities" [...] was negative, but argued it suited Bond's characterization. James Peaty of Den of Geek! interpreted the moment as purposefully [...] "brutal and shocking" [...] in order show the audience [...] "how out of sorts Bond has become and that perhaps the greatest threat he faces this time out is his own inertia and ineptitude" [...] and shift the film's focus to M (Judi Dench).|$|E

500|$|According to a news piece {{published}} by the Los Angeles Times on 21 October, by Never Let Me Gos fifth week of release it had been labeled an [...] "undeniable disappointment" [...] commercially. The publication noted that when its release widened to over 200 theatres the previous weekend its per-theatre average was so low that its distributor decided to cut its screens in the succeeding weeks. Based on answers from film experts and executives for Fox Searchlight, there were five factors to why the film commercially disappointed: its timing, airing <b>too</b> <b>early</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> year when lighter summer fare is still popular; a novel that is particularly difficult to adapt; mixed reviews from critics; its depressing tone; and its lack of appeal to male viewers. In the following weeks Never Let Me Go began to gross under US$100,000 per weekend, going on to earn US$2.5 million in the US by {{the second week of}} December.|$|E
500|$|Cancellara's pedigree, 2011 successes, {{and status}} as {{defending}} champion {{made him a}} major favorite for the second monument race, the Tour of Flanders. Cancellara put in a seemingly decisive move {{from the head of}} the main field on the Leberg, the fourteenth cobbled climb on the day's parcours. He quickly opened up a time gap of over a minute, and the race seemed to be decided. He cracked on the Muur van Geraardsbergen, however, and was swept up by an elite leading group of favorites and contenders. He put in a second acceleration on the last climb, the Bosberg, and was followed by Sylvain Chavanel and Nick Nuyens. Having perhaps spent himself <b>too</b> <b>early</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> race by attacking solo and not working with other riders to gain a large time gap, Cancellara could only manage third of the three. After the race, Cancellara blasted Nuyens and the other riders in the race, saying they only rode to keep him from winning. He referred to himself as a [...] "gladiator" [...] and said that the manner in which Nuyens won, staying in Cancellara's slipstream and then outsprinting him with the line in view, had no value in his eyes.|$|E

500|$|In July 2008, Microsoft head of Xbox {{business}} Don Mattrick told MTV that Bungie {{was working}} on a new Halo game for Microsoft, independent of the franchise spinoffs Halo Wars and Chronicles. An announcement of the new Halo project was expected at the Electronic Entertainment Expo (E3) 2008 trade fair, with Bungie unveiling a countdown on their web site, but the announcement was shelved by Microsoft. Microsoft stated that it wanted the game to have its own event. On September 25, 2008, a year after the release of Halo 3, Bungie debuted a teaser for the new project on their web site. A full trailer was released during the Tokyo Game Show on October 9, 2008, officially unveiling the game's name as Halo 3: Recon and a release date of Autumn 2009. [...] In an unusual approach for Bungie, the trailer used pre-rendered graphics instead of the game engine or existing assets. Staten explained that it was <b>too</b> <b>early</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> game's development to spend a large amount of time on the trailer, and it would not have allowed Bungie to add touches for fans to discuss.|$|E

5|$|Skilful use of {{headwind}} {{and thermal}} updrafts along various {{sections of the}} hill is used to generate additional lift, creating pressure under the oversized skis and enabling athletes to effectively ride on a 'cushion of air'. A reasonable amount of headwind is favourable to a long jump as it {{has the effect of}} keeping the athlete aloft and delaying their descent back onto the hill, whereas a tailwind or no wind at all is highly unfavourable and tends to shorten a jump by pushing the athlete downwards towards <b>the</b> hill <b>too</b> <b>early.</b> <b>In</b> particular, <b>the</b> presence of a tailwind forms one of the most challenging aspects of clearing the knoll and achieving a competitive distance. A crosswind is just as challenging, as it can create dangerous instability <b>in</b> <b>the</b> air.
