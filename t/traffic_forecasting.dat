The findings {{is to be used}} to tweak <b>traffic</b> <b>forecast</b> provided by traditional four step process using relevant socioeconomic and road network data. METHODS: Comprehensive statistical analysis is used to identify key explanatory variables using historical observations on <b>traffic</b> <b>forecast,</b> actual <b>traffic</b> counts and surrounding environments. Based on statistical results, a multiple regression model is developed to predict the effects of socioeconomic and road network attributes on traffic growth patterns. The validation of the proposed model is also performed using a different set of historical data. RESULTS: The statistical analysis results indicate that several socioeconomic characteristics and road network structure cleary affect the tendency of over- and under-estimation of road traffics. Among them, land use is a key factor which is revealed by a factor that <b>traffic</b> <b>forecast</b> for urban road tends to be under-estimated while rural road traffic prediction is generally over-estimated. The model application suggests that tweaking the <b>traffic</b> <b>forecast</b> using the proposed model can reduce the discrepancies between the predicted and actual traffic counts from 30. 4 % to 21. 9 %.

50|$|Transportation {{forecasting}} is {{the attempt}} of estimating {{the number of}} vehicles or people that will use a specific transportation facility in the future.

This traffic data is combined with other known data, such as population, employment, trip rates, travel costs, etc., to develop a traffic demand model for the current situation. Feeding it with predicted data for population, employment, etc. results in estimates of future traffic, typically estimated for each segment of the transportation infrastructure in question, e.g., for each roadway segment or railway station.|$|E

40|$|Recent {{empirical}} {{studies have found}} widespread inaccuracies in <b>traffic</b> <b>forecasts</b> {{despite the fact that}} travel demand forecasting models have been significantly improved over the past few decades. We suspect that an intrinsic selection bias may exist in the competitive project appraisal process, in addition to the many other factors that contribute to inaccurate <b>traffic</b> <b>forecasts.</b> In this paper, we examine the potential for selection bias in the governmental process of Build-Operate-Transfer (BOT) transportation project appraisals. Although the simultaneous consideration of multiple criteria is typically used in practice, traffic flow estimate is usually a key criterion in these appraisals. For the purposes of this paper, we focus on the selection bias associated with the highest flow estimate criterion. We develop two approaches to quantify the level and chance of inaccuracy caused by selection bias: the expected value approach and the probability approach. The expected value approach addresses the question “to what extent is inaccuracy caused by selection bias?”. The probability approach addresses the question “what is the chance of inaccuracy due to selection bias?”. The results of this analysis confirm the existence of selection bias when a government uses the highest <b>traffic</b> <b>forecast</b> estimate as the priority criterion for BOT project selection. In addition, we offer some insights into the relationship between the extent/chance of inaccuracy and other related factors. We do not argue that selection bias is the only reason for inaccurate <b>traffic</b> <b>forecasts</b> in BOT projects; however, it does appear that it could be an intrinsic factor worthy of further attention and investigation. postprin...|$|R
