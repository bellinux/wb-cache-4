5|$|Nixon: Hello, Neil and Buzz. I'm {{talking to}} you by {{telephone}} from the Oval Room at the White House. And <b>this</b> <b>certainly</b> {{has to be the}} most historic telephone call ever made. I just can't tell you how proud we all are of what you've done. For every American, this has to be the proudest day of our lives. And for people all over the world, I am sure they too join with Americans in recognizing what an immense feat this is. Because of what you have done, the heavens have become a part of man's world. And as you talk to us from the Sea of Tranquility, it inspires us to redouble our efforts to bring peace and tranquility to Earth. For one priceless moment in the whole history of man, all the people on this Earth are truly one: one in their pride in what you have done, and one in our prayers that you will return safely to Earth.|$|E

25|$|In 1947, the United States Justice Department {{filed an}} {{antitrust}} suit against Technicolor for monopolization of color cinematography (even though rival {{processes such as}} Cinecolor and Trucolor were in general use). In 1950, a federal court ordered Technicolor to allot a number of its three-strip cameras for use by independent studios and filmmakers. Although <b>this</b> <b>certainly</b> affected Technicolor, its real undoing was the invention of Eastmancolor that same year.|$|E

25|$|Cho {{made another}} miraculous comeback, {{this time in}} 1992 against his biggest rival Kobayashi Koichi in the Honinbo. Kobayashi had {{challenged}} for the Honinbo in 1990 and 1991, but Cho was too stubborn to give it up. Cho had come back in both finals, being down 3 games to 1, but pulled back 3 wins to defend the Honinbo. In 1991, he was down 2 to 0 in 1990, then won 4 {{games in a row}} to defend once more. In 1992, it was even more unbelievable. Cho was losing 3 games to 0, but was so relentless, that he came back and won 4 straight games once more to take the Honinbo away from Kobayashi's grip. <b>This</b> <b>certainly</b> showed that Cho could come back from any deficit and win again.|$|E
25|$|The Middle Ages saw {{a rise in}} {{popularity}} of games played annually at Shrovetide throughout Europe, particularly in England. The games played in England at this time may have arrived with the Roman occupation {{but there is little}} evidence to indicate <b>this.</b> <b>Certainly</b> the Romans played ball games, in particular Harpastum. There is also one reference to ball games being played in southern Britain prior to the Norman Conquest. In the ninth century Nennius's Historia Britonum tells that a group of boys were playing at ball (pilae ludus). The origin of this account is either Southern England or Wales. References to a ball game played in northern France known as La Soule or Choule, in which the ball was propelled by hands, feet, and sticks, date from the 12th century.|$|E
25|$|In 1379 Bishop Buckingham {{confirmed}} {{an important}} ordinance of Thomas Marshall, setting apart certain {{funds for the}} education of one of the canons at Oxford. The prior alludes to the poverty of his house, which was so great that {{were it not for the}} help of friends they would not be able to live decently and honestly, and religion would be diminished. Hitherto there had not been enough canons nor enough money to set apart one for special study; but the prior now wished to do so (partly out of the profits of a chantry established by his own family), 'seeing the advantage of learning and the necessity of preaching, the priory being a populous place where a great number of people come together.' All <b>this</b> <b>certainly</b> points to a satisfactory state of the priory under Thomas Marshall, and accords well with what we know of his character from other sources.|$|E

500|$|This {{was first}} {{illustrated}} in the skirmishes between British and German navies around South America in 1914. While two German cruisers menaced British shipping, the Admiralty insisted that no battlecruisers could be spared from the main fleet {{and sent to the}} other side of the world to deal with them. Instead the British dispatched a pre-dreadnought of 1896 vintage, [...] Intended to stiffen the British cruisers in the area, in fact her slow speed meant that she was left behind at the disastrous Battle of Coronel. Canopus redeemed herself at the Battle of the Falkland Islands, but only when grounded to act as a harbour-defence vessel; she fired at extreme range (13,500 yards) on the German cruiser SMS Gneisenau, and while the only hit was from an inert practice shell which had been left loaded from the previous night (the 'live' shells of the salvo broke up on contact with water; one inert shell ricocheted into one of Gneisenaus funnels), <b>this</b> <b>certainly</b> deterred Gneisenau from a potentially damaging raid on a British squadron which was still taking on coal. The subsequent battle was decided by the two s which had been dispatched after Coronel. This appears to have been the only meaningful engagement of an enemy ship by a British pre-dreadnought.|$|E

Many compared the production to that of [...] "Friday". Mike Hale of The New York Times criticized Black's vocals for being [...] "as heavily processed" [...] as they were previously, but said that the tuning had [...] "been done much more artfully", meaning Black sounded [...] "more like a human being." [...] A reviewer for The Huffington Post said, [...] "if you were hoping for [...] "Friday" [...] part two, <b>this</b> <b>certainly</b> isn't it. Gone is the weird nasal, overly auto-tuned voice that made 'Friday' sound like she was saying 'fried egg.'" [...] Black herself was called [...] "sweet but very self empowered" [...] by Stransky, and Adrian Chen of Gawker called the track [...] "a 'look-at-me-now' love letter" [...] to all [...] haters". Jason Lipshutz of Billboard saw the song in a similar light; for him, Black [...] "does offer a bit of vitriol to those who wrote her off as a one-hit Internet wonder." ...|$|E
500|$|From December 1588 he was {{employed}} repeatedly by the Privy Council to examine witnesses, and in 1590 {{was charged with}} interrogating Sir Thomas Fitzherbert. Although his career had begun promisingly, Fuller soon found himself {{at odds with the}} authorities due to his religion, and the religion of those he chose to represent. A favoured barrister of Puritans prosecuted based on their faith, Fuller represented John Udall at Croydon assizes, when Udall was charged with having written A Discovery of the Discipline, an allegedly seditious book. The judge instructed the jury to find Udall guilty, and [...] "leave the felony to us"; Fuller protested so vociferously at this that he was forced out of the court. In 1591, following the collapse of their case in front of the Court of High Commission, Thomas Cartwright and other Puritan ministers were tried by the Star Chamber; Fuller provided legal representation. The case was made more complicated when several of the ministers, on 16 July 1591, [...] "proclaimed Elizabeth deposed, and William Hacket the new messiah and king of Europe"; <b>this</b> <b>certainly</b> was sedition, and saw the ministers confined to Fleet Prison, along with Fuller for offering to represent them. Cartwright and several other ministers were never convicted, however, which is attributed to [...] "the highly professional resistance of the puritan lawyers [...] perhaps owed much to Nicholas Fuller". Fuller was confined until 15 August.|$|E

500|$|Roy won {{a number}} of trophies during his career with Rovers, {{including}} nine league titles, eight FA Cups, three League Cups, three European Cups, one UEFA Cup, and four Cup Winners' Cups, and he also made several appearances for England. He married club secretary Penny Laine {{at the end of}} the 1975â€“76 season, with whom he had three children: Roy Jr. (later known as Rocky), Melinda, and Diana. Penny left Roy in the early 1980s, in a high-profile storyline that was covered on national television news. The following year Roy was shot in his office by a mystery gunman, in an incident clearly mirroring the shooting of J. R. Ewing in the hit television series Dallas the previous year. Roy lay in a coma for several weeks. The culprit was eventually revealed to be Elton Blake, an actor who had been cast as Roy in a television series about the Rovers, but who blamed him for his dismissal. In early 1983 Roy swapped Melchester Rovers for ambitious London side Walford Rovers after a fallout with the Melchester directors, but his stint away was short-lived and he was back at his spiritual home by the end of the year. In July 1986 eight members of the Rovers team were killed during a club tour of the fictional middle-eastern country of Basran, when terrorists accidentally crashed a bomb-laden car into the team bus. Roy escaped with a dislocated shoulder. [...] Author Mick Collins has commented that [...] "Even as youngsters, we knew that <b>this</b> <b>certainly</b> bordered on bad taste, and probably overstepped the mark." ...|$|E

[...] This is substantiated in Julyan's letter to Joseph Howe in 1871. [...] Catherine made sure she was buried on the very lot for which she {{had been trying to}} get a deed. <b>This</b> <b>certainly</b> was one way they could not remove her. One way or another she was staying.|$|E
2500|$|Sonnet 4 {{is one of}} the {{procreation}} sonnets, {{which are}} sonnets 1â€“17. This sonnet, as well, is focused on the theme of beauty and procreation. The characters of Sonnet 4 are the speaker and his good friend (known as the young man). In the book A Companion to Shakespeare's Sonnet, edited by Michael Schoenfeldt, Shakespeare critic Schoenfeldt describes the differences in the way the speaker and the young man are portrayed in procreation sonnets, saying [...] "The desiring male subject (the speaker) has a clear, forceful voice... But the desired male object (the young man) in the sonnets has no voice". <b>This</b> <b>certainly</b> holds true in Sonnet 4 as the speaker addresses the young man the entire time with the young man's voice never being heard.|$|E

2500|$|As in education, the UMNO government's unspoken {{agenda in}} the field of {{economic}} development aimed to shift economic power away from the Chinese and towards the Malays. The two Malayan Plans and the First Malaysian Plan (1966â€“1970) directed resources heavily into developments which would benefit the rural Malay community, such as village schools, rural roads, clinics, and irrigation projects. Several agencies were set up to enable Malay smallholders to upgrade their production and to increase their incomes. The Federal Land Development Authority (FELDA) helped many Malays to buy farms or to upgrade ones they already owned. The state also provided a range of incentives and low-interest loans to help Malays start businesses, and government tendering systematically favoured Malay companies, leading many Chinese-owned businesses to [...] "Malayanise" [...] their management. All <b>this</b> <b>certainly</b> tended to reduce to gap between Chinese and Malay standards of living, although some argued that this would have happened anyway as Malaysia's trade and general prosperity increased.|$|E
2500|$|The rule {{also does}} not apply to charges placed upon party-coloured (divided) or {{patterned}} fields; a field party or patterned of a colour and metal may have a charge of either colour, metal, or party or patterned, placed on it (and there is a small body of precedent that a field party of two colours or two metals may have a charge or charges of either colour, metal, or party or patterned on it; examples of <b>this</b> <b>certainly</b> exist). [...] Likewise, a party-coloured (of colour and metal) charge may be placed on either a colour or metal background. [...] Neither does the rule apply to the tongue, horns, claws, hoofs of beasts (for instance, a lion Or on an azure field could be langued [...] gules) when of a different tincture {{than the rest of the}} animal, or other parts of charges that are [...] "attached" [...] to them; for instance, a ship sable on an Or field may have argent sails as the sails are considered to be attached on the ship rather than charged on the field.|$|E
2500|$|The late (Sunni) theologian Mawdudi (founder of Jamaat-E-Islami) {{wrote that}} the {{establishment}} of the caliphate as (essentially) a monarchy began with the caliphate of Muawiyah I. It wasn't the kind where Muawiyah was appointed by the Muslims. Mawdudi elaborated that Muawiyah wanted to be caliph and fought in order to attain the caliphate, not really depending upon the acceptance of the Muslim community. The people did not appoint Muawiyah as a caliph, he became one by force, and consequently the people {{had no choice but to}} give him their pledge of allegiance (bay'ah). Had the people not given Muawiyah their allegiance at that time, it wouldn't have meant so much as losing their rank or position, as much as it would have meant bloodshed and conflict. <b>This</b> <b>certainly</b> couldn't have been given preference over peace and order. Following Hasan ibn Ali's abdication of the caliphate, all the Muslims (including the Sahabah and Tabi'een) gave their pledge of allegiance to Muawiyah I, bringing an end to civil war. That year was called the Aam Al Jamaat (Year of Unification). As Mawdudi pointed out, Muawiyah's own speech during the initial days of his caliphate expressed his own awareness of this: ...|$|E

She's excited about music and about life in general.

2500|$|The {{labor force}} in the Arab Caliphate were {{employed}} from diverse ethnic and religious backgrounds, while {{both men and women}} were involved in diverse occupations and economic activities. Women were employed {{in a wide range of}} commercial activities and diverse occupations in the primary sector (as farmers for example), secondary sector (as construction workers, dyers, spinners, etc.) and tertiary sector (as investors, doctors, nurses, presidents of guilds, brokers, peddlers, lenders, scholars, etc.). Muslim women also held a monopoly over certain branches of the textile industry, the largest and most specialized and market-oriented industry at the time, in occupations such as spinning, dyeing, and embroidery. In comparison, female property rights and wage labour were relatively uncommon in Europe until the Industrial Revolution in the 18th and 19th centuries. Women's economic position was strengthened by the Qur'an, but local custom has weakened that position in its insistence that women must work within private sector of the world: the home or at least in some sphere related to home. Dr. Nadia YousaF, an Egyptian sociologist now teaching in the United States, states in a recent article on labor-force participation by women of Middle Eastern and Latin American Countries that the [...] "Middle East reports systematically the lowest female activity rates on record" [...] for labor. <b>This</b> <b>certainly</b> gives the impression that Middle Eastern women have little or no economical role, until one notes that the statistics are based on non-agricultural labor outside the home.|$|E
2500|$|The Muslim League issued similar {{attacks on}} the mutiny which argued that the unrest of the sailors was not best {{expressed}} on the streets, however serious the grievance may be. Legitimacy could only, probably, be conferred by a recognised political leadership {{as the head of}} any kind of movement. Spontaneous and unregulated upsurges, as the RIN strikers were viewed, could only disrupt and, at worst, destroy consensus at the political level. This may be Gandhi's (and the Congress's) conclusions from the Quit India Movement in 1942 when central control quickly dissolved under the impact of British repression, and localised actions, including widespread acts of sabotage, continued well into 1943. It may have been the conclusion that the rapid emergence of militant mass demonstrations in support of the sailors would erode central political authority if and when transfer of power occurred. The Muslim League had observed passive support for the [...] "Quit India" [...] campaign among its supporters and, devoid of communal clashes {{despite the fact that it}} was opposed by the then collaborationist Muslim League. It is possible that the League also realised the likelihood of a destabilised authority as and when power was transferred. <b>This</b> <b>certainly</b> is reflected on the opinion of the sailors who participated in the strike It has been concluded by later historians that the discomfiture of the mainstream political parties was because the public outpourings indicated their weakening hold over the masses at a time when they could show no success in reaching agreement with the British Indian government.|$|E
