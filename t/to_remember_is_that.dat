25|$|The {{reason why}} SCNT {{is used for}} cloning is because somatic cells can be easily {{acquired}} and cultured in the lab. This process can either add or delete specific genomes of farm animals. A key point <b>to</b> <b>remember</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> cloning is achieved when the oocyte maintains its normal functions and instead of using sperm and egg genomes to replicate, the oocyte is inserted into the donor’s somatic cell nucleus. The oocyte will react on the somatic cell nucleus, {{the same way it}} would on sperm cells.|$|E

His philosophy of architectural work may be summed up in his quote [...] "The first thing you've got <b>to</b> <b>remember</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> it's your client's money you're spending.

40|$|Abstract. This brief {{research}} {{commentary on}} Westland’s (2010) {{article in this}} issue of Electronic Commerce Research and Applications is intended to add two cautionary notes. He attempts to answer two questions: What is critical mass? And how one can manage a network’s growth to reach that mass? He proposes a model for social networks, and shows how the model might possibly be managed. What needs <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>remembered</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> models <b>are</b> always imperfect. And even when they do describe well the natural behavior of some system, they may not fit as well, once some external influence begins affecting that system. Hence Westland’s contribution should be regarded as a definite step forward, but not necessarily the definitive answer to either of the questions it attempts to solve...|$|R

2500|$|Bailey's {{second and}} final season as Gloucestershire captain was 1952. The team {{improved}} marginally to ninth in the County Championship and Wisden cited a [...] "lack of batting solidity" [...] {{as a reason}} why further success was not achieved. It added: [...] "A point <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>remembered</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> Gloucestershire almost invariably tried to play attractively. Sometimes they were beaten when risking all to win. To strike the balance between enterprise and match-winning cricket is not always easy." [...] Bailey himself was exonerated from criticism on lack of solidity: [...] "Bailey's defensive stubbornness was worth more than its numerical value." [...] His own batting record was down on his 1951 figures: in the season as a whole he scored 864 runs {{at an average of}} 23.35 runs per innings and with a highest score of 82, made as an opening batsman in the match against Essex at Southend-on-Sea.|$|R
60|$|The {{origin of}} these Arthurian romances, which {{reappear}} {{so often in}} English poetry, is forever shrouded in mystery. The point <b>to</b> <b>remember</b> <b>is,</b> <b>that</b> we owe them all to {{the genius of the}} native Celts; that it was Geoffrey of Monmouth who first wrote them in Latin prose, and so preserved a treasure which else had been lost; and that it was the French trouvères, or poets, who completed the various cycles of romances which were later collected in Malory's Morte d' Arthur.|$|E

In a vein of grim humor which recalls Swift's [...] "Modest Proposal," [...] Defoe advocated hanging all dissenting ministers, and sending all members of the free churches into exile; and so ferociously realistic was the satire that both Dissenters and Tories took the author literally. Defoe was tried, found guilty of seditious libel, and sentenced to be fined, to stand three days in the pillory, and to be imprisoned. Hardly had the sentence been pronounced when Defoe wrote his [...] "Hymn to the Pillory,"-- ...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT In most {{eucaryotes}} the tubulin genes comprise small multigene {{families with}} approximately {{equal numbers of}} genes for a- and ß-tubulin, the structural proteins of microtubules. The recent isolation of tubulin mutations in several species {{is proving to be}} a powerful tool for examining the structure and function of specific sets of microtubules. In Drosophila melanogaster, genetic analysis of a testis-specific ß-tubulin gene has shown that a single tubulin gene product may fulfill a number of different microtubule functions. In addition to tubulin mutations, mutations in other genes whose products are involved in the regulation or structure of specific microtubule arrays have also been isolated. The combination of analysis of both classes of mutations is beginning to allow a molecular description of the construction and function of three-dimensional cellular structures. In addition, such studies may also shed light on the evolutionary pressures that gave rise to and serve to maintain small families of genes encoding very similar proteins. Young biochemists of my generation were cautioned not to waste clean thinking on a dirty enzyme.

What we have <b>to</b> <b>remember</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> the new doctrine itself will never come, except to spirits predisposed to their own liberation.

At what epoch of the world's history this took place, again, we have no evidence whatever.
