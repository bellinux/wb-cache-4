I, therefore, rest the case in full confidence in your hands.|$|E
5|$|After {{the bishops}} refused <b>to</b> <b>pass</b> <b>judgment,</b> the barons {{attempted}} to do so, but Becket refused to hear the court and left the council without the king's permission. Soon afterward, Foliot, along with Hilary of Chichester, went to Becket and suggested a compromise, which Becket refused. Becket went into exile after this last attempt at a settlement, and arrived in Flanders on 2November 1164. Foliot was sent, along with Roger, the Archbishop of York, Hilary of Chichester, Bartholomew Iscanus, the Bishop of Exeter, Roger of Worcester, the Bishop of Worcester, William d'Aubigny, the Earl of Arundel, {{and a group of}} royal clerks, to Thierry the Count of Flanders, Louis VII the King of France, and Pope Alexander III. Their mission was to prevent the archbishop from being given refuge, but despite their efforts Louis of France agreed to grant Becket refuge. Foliot's delegation met with more success at the papal court; although they did not succeed in securing a decision in the king's favour, neither did the pope side with the archbishop.|$|E

It was my job to look at {{something}} that Emma Thompson had done and say, 'Eh, that's not good, I'll use this other one instead.'

500|$|Lady Catelyn Stark {{leads her}} entourage east through the Mountains of the Moon {{to get to}} the Vale, with Tyrion Lannister as her prisoner. However, they are soon {{attacked}} by barbarian tribesmen. During the fight, Tyrion saves Catelyn's life, attacking and killing a barbarian with a shield. The party arrives at the Eyrie, ruled by Lord Jon Arryn's widow, Lysa, who is also Catelyn's sister. However, when the two meet {{for the first time in}} five years, it becomes apparent that Lysa is mentally unstable and fears the Lannisters' power. Catelyn also meets her nephew, Robin Arryn, the heir to the Eyrie - an eight-year-old boy whom Lysa still breast-feeds. Tyrion is consigned to the Eyrie's version of a dungeon, the [...] "sky cells," [...] prison cells with an open wall and slanted floors that slope down to a precipice. Meanwhile, Lysa prepares <b>to</b> <b>pass</b> <b>judgment</b> on Tyrion as an accomplice in her husband's murder.|$|E
500|$|After the Democrats' 1951 electoral victory, Philadelphia's once-powerful Republican party {{organization}} {{lost the}} hold on city government {{that they had}} held since 1884. In 1953, they sought to regain their former control over the city's political scene. Both sides presented the election as {{a referendum on the}} administration of Mayor Joseph S. Clark Jr., a Democrat elected with the support of reform-minded Republicans and independents in 1951. In an op-ed in The Philadelphia Inquirer the Sunday before the election, Republican City Committee chairman William J. Hamilton called the election [...] "an opportunity <b>to</b> <b>pass</b> <b>judgment</b> upon the administration of Mayor Clark who promised so much and gave so little." [...] He called the Clark administration [...] "spendthrift and mismanaged", and promised [...] "honest and efficient management" [...] from the Republicans. In another op-ed the same day, Democratic City Committee chairman William J. Green Jr., characterized the Clark administration in more glowing terms and framed the election as a chance for Philadelphians to decide [...] "whether 'good government' shall be extended" [...] in the city after the reforms of 1951.|$|E
500|$|Many early reviews gave Carnivàle good marks {{but also}} said its unique {{characters}} and story might {{prevent it from}} becoming a huge mainstream audience success. Daily Variety TV editor Joseph Adalian predicted that [...] "it will get mostly positive reviews but some people will be {{put off by the}} general weirdness of the show." [...] Phil Gallo of Variety described Carnivàle as [...] "an absolute visual stunner with compelling freak show characters—but the series unfortunately takes a leisurely approach toward getting to a point," [...] and Eric Deggans of the St. Petersburg Times suggested that [...] "it's as if executives at the premium cable network want to see how far they can slow a narrative before viewers start tossing their remotes through the screen". James Poniewozik of Time called the first three episodes [...] "frustrating" [...] as well as [...] "spellbinding." [...] Amanda Murray of BBC said [...] "With so little revealed, it's almost impossible <b>to</b> <b>pass</b> <b>judgment</b> on the show—it's hard to tell if this is just good, or going to be great." ...|$|E

He also decreed that testimony of a Romanian knez {{who had received}} a royal charter of grant weighed {{the same as that}} of a nobleman. In the same year, Louis granted the Banate of Severin and the district of Fogaras to Vladislav Vlaicu of Wallachia, who had accepted his suzerainty. Tvrtko I of Bosnia also accepted Louis's suzerainty after Hungarian troops assisted him in regaining his throne in early 1367.|$|R
2500|$|Descartes {{submitted}} his manuscript to many philosophers, {{theologians and}} a logician before publishing the Meditations.

In the Preface to the Meditations, Descartes asks the reader [...] "not <b>to</b> <b>pass</b> <b>judgment</b> on the Meditations until they have been kind enough to read through all these objections and my replies to them.” [...] Thus, this dialogue could be seen {{as an integral part of}} Descartes' views expressed in the Meditations.|$|E

The report, which is not yet publicly available, will be presented by Žužul at the OSCE Permanent Council meeting in Vienna on 6 September. An OSCE spokesman said that [...] "the key point here is that it's not the OSCE's role <b>to</b> <b>pass</b> <b>judgment,</b> or point the finger. It's to listen to all sides, and to recommend and seek ways to avoid similar incidents and tensions in the future.

2500|$|In {{the twelfth}} century, Gratian equated {{the natural law}} with divine law. Albertus Magnus would address the subject a century later, and his pupil St. Thomas Aquinas in his Summa Theologica I-II qq. 90–106, {{restored}} Natural Law to its independent state, asserting natural law as the rational creature's participation in the eternal law. Yet, since human reason could not fully comprehend the Eternal law, {{it needed to be}} supplemented by revealed Divine law. (See also Biblical law in Christianity.) Meanwhile, Aquinas taught that all human or positive laws were to be judged by their conformity to the natural law. An unjust law is not a law, in the full sense of the word. It retains merely the 'appearance' of law insofar as it is duly constituted and enforced in the same way a just law is, but is itself a 'perversion of law.' At this point, the natural law was not only used <b>to</b> <b>pass</b> <b>judgment</b> on the moral worth of various laws, but also to determine what those [...] laws meant in the first place. This principle laid the seed for possible societal tension with reference to tyrants.|$|E
50|$|Kenneth Allan {{proposed}} {{the distinction between}} sociological theory and social theory. In Allan's usage, sociological theory consists of abstract and testable propositions about society. It often heavily relies on the scientific method, which aims for objectivity, and attempts <b>to</b> avoid <b>passing</b> value <b>judgments.</b> In contrast, social theory, according to Allan, focuses on commentary and critique of modern society rather than explanation. Social theory is often closer to Continental philosophy; thus, it is less concerned with objectivity and derivation of testable propositions, and more likely <b>to</b> <b>pass</b> normative <b>judgments.</b> Sociological theory is generally created only by sociologists, while social theory can frequently come from other disciplines.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: We {{present a}} {{mechanism}} to elicit {{the expression of a}} social norm in a type of trust game. Our mechanism is similar to a committee peer review process, in which experienced subjects <b>pass</b> <b>judgment</b> on the game’s outcome between a different pair of subjects. In general we find that subjects take decisions that are broadly consistent with reciprocity in all treatments. The mechanism increases trust significantly, but not reciprocity. One player type is more likely <b>to</b> <b>pass</b> a <b>judgment</b> consistent with indirect reciprocity than the other...|$|R
