40|$|The <b>turn-on</b> <b>delay</b> <b>time</b> jitter of four {{different}} unbiased gain-switched laser types {{is determined by}} measuring the temporal probability distribution of {{the leading edge of}} the emitted optical pulse. One single-mode 1. 5 -mu-m distributed feed-back laser and three multimode Fabry-Perot lasers emitting at 750 nm and 1. 3 -mu-m are investigated. The jitter is found to decrease for all lasers with increasing injection current. For multimode lasers it decreases from 8 ps excited slightly above threshold down to below 2 ps at three times the threshold current. The jitter of the distributed feedback (DFB) laser is a factor of 3 - 5 larger than the jitter of the three multimode lasers. A new model to predict the <b>turn-on</b> <b>delay</b> <b>time</b> jitter is presented and explains the experiments quantitatively...|$|E
40|$|Renewable {{energy sources}} {{normally}} require power converters to convert their energy into standardized regulated ac output. The motivation for this thesis is {{to design and}} control power converters for renewable energy systems to ensure very good power quality, efficiency and reliability. The renewable energy sources considered are low voltage dc sources such as photovoltaic (PV) modules. Two transformer-isolated power circuit topologies with input voltage of less than 50 V are designed and developed for low and medium power applications. Various design and control issues of these converters are identified and new solutions are proposed. For low power rating {{of a few hundred}} watts, a line-frequency transformer interfaced inverter is developed. In the grid connected operation, it is observed that this topology injects considerable lower order odd and even harmonics in the grid current. The reasons for this are identified. A new current control method using adaptive harmonic compensation technique and a proportional-resonant-integral (PRI) controller is proposed. The proposed current controller is designed to ensure that the grid current harmonics are within the limits set by the IEEE 1547 - 2003 standard. Phase-locked loops (PLLs) are used for grid synchronization of power converters in grid-tied operation and for closed-loop control reference generation. Analysis and design of synchronous reference frame PLL (SRF-PLL) and second-order generalized integrator (SOGI) based PLLs considering unit vector distortion under the possible non-ideal grid conditions of harmonics, unbalance, dc offsets and frequency deviations are proposed and validated. Both SRF-PLL and SOGI-PLL are low-complexity PLLs. The proposed designs achieve fastest settling time for these PLLs for a given worst-case input condition. The harmonic distortion and dc offsets in the resulting unit vectors are limited to be well within the limits set by the IEEE 1547 - 2003 standard. The proposed designs can be used to achieve very good performance using conventional low-complexity PLLs without the requirement of advanced PLLs which can be computationally intensive. A high-frequency (HF) transformer interfaced ac link inverter with a lossless snubber is developed medium power level in the order of few kilowatts. The HF transformer makes the topology compact and economical compared to an equally rated line frequency transformer. A new synchronized modulation method is proposed to suppress the possible over-voltages due to current commutation in the leakage inductance of the HF transformer. The effect of circuit non-ideality of <b>turn-on</b> <b>delay</b> <b>time</b> is analyzed. The proposed modulation mitigates the problem of spurious turn-on that can occur due to the <b>turn-on</b> <b>delay</b> <b>time.</b> The HF inverter, rectifier and snubber devices have soft switching with this modulation. A new reliable start-up method is proposed for this inverter topology without any additional start- up circuitry. This solves the problems of over-voltages and inrush currents during start-up. The overall research work reported in the thesis shows {{that it is possible to}} have compact, reliable and high performance power converters for renewable energy conversion systems. It is also shown that high control performance and power quality can be achieved using the proposed control techniques of low implementation complexity...|$|E

In addition to the external OFB level, the effect of other external cavity parameters such as temperature, injection current, dc-bias level, coupling coefficient, and gain compression factor on transient response characteristics of the laser are investigated. The temperature dependence (TD) of response characteristics is calculated according to TD of laser parameters instead of well-known Pankove relationship. Results show that, by increasing the laser injection current, the relaxation oscillationâ��s amplitude, frequency, and damping rate are increased, while the laser <b>turn-on</b> <b>time</b> <b>delay</b> is reduced.

The design repetition rate is 20 s. The switch is composed of ten Fast High Current Thyristors (FHCTs), which are modified symmetric 4. 5 kV GTO thyristors of WESTCODE. Recent studies aiming at improving the <b>turn-on</b> <b>delay,</b> switching speed and at decreasing the switch losses, have led to test an asymmetric not fully optimised GTO thyristor of WESTCODE and an optimised device of GEC PLESSEY Semiconductor (GPS), GB. The GPS FHCT, which gave the best results, is a non irradiated device of 64 mm diameter with a hold-off voltage of 4. 5 kV like the symmetric FHCT. Tests results of the GPS FHCT show a reduction in <b>turn-on</b> <b>delay</b> of 40 % and in switching losses of almost 50 % {{with respect to the}} symmetric FHCT of WESTCODE.

40|$|Optical {{communication}} {{systems have been}} widely preferred for network communications, especially for Datacoms Local Area Network links. The optical technology is an excellent candidate for on-board systems due to the potential weight saving and EMC immunity. According to the short length of the link and a cost saving, Vertical Cavity Surface Emitting Laser (VCSEL) and multimode fiber are the best solution for gigabit systems. In this context, we propose a modeling of 850 nm VCSEL based on the rate equations analysis to predict the optical interconnect performances (jitter, bit error rate). Our aim is to define the operation conditions of VCSEL under large signal modulation {{in order to maximize}} the Extinction Ratio (current IOFF below threshold) without affecting link performances. The VCSEL model is developed to provide large signal modulation response. Biasing below threshold causes stochastic <b>turn-on</b> <b>delay.</b> Fluctuations of this delay occur, due to the spontaneous emission. This leads to additional turn-on jitter. These stochastic effects are included in the model by adding the Langevin photon and electron noise sources. The VCSEL behavior under high-speed modulation is studied to observe the transient response and extract the resonance frequency, overshoot and <b>turn-on</b> <b>delay.</b> The associated jitter is evaluated with the standard deviation of the <b>turn-on</b> <b>delay</b> probability density function. Simulations of stochastic and deterministic jitters are realized under different conditions of modulation (OFF current levels).

40|$|Low {{cost and}} {{intrinsic}} performances of 850 nm Vertical Cavity Surface Emitting Lasers (VCSELs) compared to Light Emitting Diodes make them very attractive for high speed and short distances data communication links through optical fibers. Weight saving and Electromagnetic Interference withstanding requirements {{have led to}} the need of a reliable solution to improve existing avionics high speed buses (e. g. AFDX) up to 1 Gbps over 100 m. To predict and optimize the performance of the link, the physical behavior of the VCSEL must be well understood. First, a theoretical study is performed through the rate equations adapted to VCSEL in large signal modulation. Averaged <b>turn-on</b> <b>delays</b> and oscillation effects are analytically computed and analyzed for different values of the on - and off state currents. This will affect the eye pattern, timing jitter and Bit Error Rate (BER) of the signal that must remain within IEEE 802. 3 standard limits. In particular, the off-state current is minimized below the threshold to allow the highest possible Extinction Ratio. At this level, the spontaneous emission is dominating and leads to significant <b>turn-on</b> <b>delay,</b> <b>turn-on</b> jitter and bit pattern effects. Also, the transverse multimode behavior of VCSELs, caused by Spatial Hole Burning leads to some dispersion in the fiber and degradation of BER. VCSEL to Multimode Fiber coupling model is provided for prediction and optimization of modal dispersion.
