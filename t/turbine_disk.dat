50|$|Only the {{limitations}} of weight and materials (e.g., the strengths and melting points of materials in the turbine) reduce the efficiency at which a turbofan gas turbine converts this thermal energy into mechanical energy, for while the exhaust gases may still have available energy to be extracted, each additional stator and <b>turbine</b> <b>disk</b> retrieves progressively less mechanical energy per unit of weight, and increasing the compression ratio of the system by adding to the compressor stage to increase overall system efficiency increases temperatures at the turbine face. Nevertheless, high-bypass engines have a high propulsive efficiency because even slightly increasing the velocity {{of a very large}} volume and consequently mass of air produces a very large change in momentum and thrust: thrust is the engine's mass flow (the amount of air flowing through the engine) multiplied by the difference between the inlet and exhaust velocities in—a linear relationship—but the kinetic energy of the exhaust is the mass flow multiplied by one-half the square of the difference in velocities. A low disc loading (thrust per disc area) increases the aircraft's energy efficiency, and this reduces the fuel use.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Turbine cascade {{aerodynamic}} {{losses are}} heavily related to incidence. Conventional researches have {{been focused on}} a single blade row upon the convention that the whole turbine cascade has a universal incidence for all blades on the cascade and accordingly the overall aerodynamic loss of the cascade {{is the same as}} a single blade row. However, there are exceptional situations in engineering practice that each blade of a turbine cascade has a different incidence. When a <b>turbine</b> <b>disk</b> is inclined to its design position due to manufacturing errors and/or operating malfunctions, the incidence for a blade on the cascade varies along the circumference of the <b>turbine</b> <b>disk.</b> For such case, the conventional research conclusions are no longer adequate.

Low pressure turbine improvements will be important to increase the efficiency of the two most innovative propulsive architectures, the Geared Turbofan and the Open Rotor Engine. The low pressure turbine is released from the fan and can rotate at higher speed values, implying a reduction in fuel consumption. Due to a higher rotational speed, low pressure <b>turbine</b> <b>disks</b> design needs careful considerations due to their higher stress level and reduced burst limit. This paper presents a multi-objective hybrid optimization methodology designed to study high speed low pressure <b>turbine</b> <b>disks.</b> The presented study falls within the preliminary design phase, thus a code based on finite differences was used to perform an optimization study of high speed low pressure <b>turbine</b> <b>disks.</b> The objective functions of the constrained multi-objective optimization were the minimization of the disks weight and the maximization of the burst speed, and a hybrid approach was pursued to better investigate the design space and find the optimum. Then a surrogate-model-based hybrid optimization was conducted to reduce computational time while ensuring the analysis accuracy. A trade-off of most common approximation strategies was conducted. Distributed computing was used involving three national research centers, and parallel computing was adopted to spread the calculation tasks on local workstations. Numeric and Finite-Element-Methodology-based validations followed. This study provides an innovative approach to design such critical components by reducing disks weight by 15 % and computational time by 30 % if compared to traditional design methodologies.

Because such inclusions {{represent a}} significant threat in aviation, {{a detailed analysis}} is required for impured <b>turbine</b> <b>disks.</b> For this purpose, sensitive fluxgate magnetometers are used. After a premagnetisation, this sensor is able to detect small ferromagnetic particles by recording the variation of the magnetic flux density while the disk rotates below the sensor head.

A main reason for these distortions is that the particles are not oriented in axial direction (in {{the direction of the}} disks axis). Up to now, {{it was not possible to}} interpret the measured signatures. Thus, a simulation tool has been developed that provides a catalogue of different magnetic flux density distributions of typical orientations, positions and various distances to the fluxgate magnetometer position.

As part of impurities are not caused by concentrated particles but by elongated ones, so-called or dipole lines, the model has been expanded for these cases by using numerical integration techniques.
