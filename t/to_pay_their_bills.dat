Initially, however, they had lived in an old barracks within a bombed-out area of the city center. Abe sold pickles and {{charcoal}} on the street <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>their</b> <b>bills.</b> The couple joined a number of artistic study groups, such as Yoru no Kai (Group of the Night or The Night Society) and Nihon Bungaku Gakko (Japanese Literary School)'.|$|E
25|$|The {{series has}} also {{attracted}} some criticism from other pawnbrokers, who while conceding its entertainment value, {{claim that the}} series' focus on the extravagant vintage items brought into the Gold & Silver Pawn Shop are not typical of the average pawn shop, whose business is predicated on individuals on fixed income who bring in conventional objects in order <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>their</b> <b>bills,</b> such as electronics, tools and jewelry. Corey Grigson and Charles Brown, who own a shop called Pawn Stars, estimate that their average loan to a customer is between $50 and $100. They also point out appraisals are handled by the staff, who rely on experience, reference works and research, and not the outside experts who are frequently seen on the show aiding the Harrisons.|$|E

25|$|Toadie and Sonya {{decide to}} enlist Nell in {{childcare}} when she begins playing up, believing {{she does not}} get enough attention. During an open day for the new childcare centre, Toadie falls from an out-of-control bouncy castle and is left paralysed. Sonya struggles as Toadie refuses to accept how serious his injury is. She asks Amy to continue living with them to help with Nell while Toadie recovers. Angie briefly visits to help out, but soon leaves after clashing with Sonya. The neighbours organise a benefit for Toadie, which raises over $6000. Sonya is bitten by a Redback spider at the nursery, causing her to pass out. After receiving treatment, Sonya recovers at home. She and Toadie consider using the benefit fund <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>their</b> <b>bills,</b> but discover the money has been taken. Amy's ex-husband Liam Barnett (James Beck) later reveals he stole the money. Steph returns to Erinsborough and Sonya is uncomfortable having her around. However, after she learns Paul was gaslighting Steph, Sonya invites her {{to move in with}} her and Toadie. Steph's ex-girlfriend Belinda Bell (Nikki Shiels) believes Steph has feelings for Toadie, and she threatens Toadie. When Sonya learns that Belinda is the theatre nurse during Toadie's spinal surgery, she interrupts the operation, causing a complication that leaves Toadie infertile. Worried that Steph is a threat to her marriage, Sonya offers Belinda a job as Toadie's nurse. Belinda quits after one day and Sonya's insecurities are exposed. She and Toadie begin attending counselling.|$|E

He later ends up meeting his landlord, Eugene, who found his posting for a male prostitute service on the apartment's bulletin board. Eugene advises him to go to a fancy hotel and try his luck. At a band meeting, Murray introduces Nigel Seladu, whose investment offer {{has turned out to be}} legitimate and not a scam, and results in Murray earning more than enough money for the Conchords <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>their</b> <b>bills</b> and buy back their guitars. Jemaine is noticeably absent and Bret tells Murray that he is out trying to prostitute himself. Both Murray and Nigel tell Bret to go and stop him. On his way, Bret sings a song called [...] "You Don't Have to be A Prostitute", similar to The Police's [...] "Roxanne".|$|E

André Gill died on May Day, 1885, with only Cohl by his side. [...] Cohl never forgot Gill's desertion by his friends and the public. The Incoherent movement collapsed in 1888.|$|E

2500|$|In August 1943, a {{few months}} after Streisand's first birthday, her father died {{suddenly}} at age 34 from complications from an epileptic seizure, possibly the result of a head injury years earlier. The family fell into near-poverty, with her mother working as a low-paid bookkeeper. As an adult, Streisand remembered those early years as always feeling like an [...] "outcast," [...] explaining, [...] "Everybody else's father came home from work {{at the end of the}} day.

2500|$|Since 2009 the {{security}} situation in Yemen began to deteriorate, resulting in heavy fighting {{in different parts of}} the country and a change of government in 2011. The fighting has forced many people to flee their homes, such as tens of thousands of people who fled from Abyan to Lahej and who received emergency drinking water supplies from the international community. Urban water supply throughout the country was affected by the interruption of power supply, lack of diesel fuel, insufficient backup generators, and a decline in revenues due to reluctance of consumers <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>their</b> <b>bills.</b> In January 2012 the Minister of Water, Abdulsalam Razaz, said that the Ministry was owed over YR 33 billion (USD 153 million) [...] "by government bodies and people of power” and warned that it was [...] "on the verge of bankruptcy". In addition, strikes caused chaos in the Ministry and its branches.|$|E
2500|$|In May 2009, Dodd was {{the author}} and lead sponsor of the Credit Card Accountability, Responsibility, and Disclosure Act of 2009, which {{was signed into law}} by President Barack Obama on May 22, 2009. The law {{requires}} card companies give cardholders 45 days notice of any interest rate increases, prevents card companies from retroactively increasing interest rates on the existing balance of a cardholder in good standing for reasons unrelated to the cardholder's behavior with that card, and prohibits card companies from arbitrarily changing the terms of their contract with a cardholder, banning the so-called practice of [...] "any-time, any-reason repricing." [...] Also included in the bill were provisions requiring companies to give cardholders time <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>their</b> <b>bills</b> by requiring card companies to mail billing statements 25 calendar days before the due date and individuals under the age of 21 to either show income or have a co-signer in order to obtain a credit card. In a conference call with reporters after the bill was signed, Dodd stated his intention to continue work on capping credit card interest rates at thirty percent and to establish limits on fees that merchants pay when a customer uses a credit card for a purchase.|$|E

A new company trading as Avon Bodies Ltd took over the business moving to smaller premises at The Cape and managed to fit the existing stock of bodies onto Triumph Dolomite chassis. Lea-Francis was now back in business and the old ties were re-established with Avon supplying the Waymaker saloon bodies for their 2 Litre model.|$|R
2500|$|In {{each year}} since 1982, OASDI tax receipts, {{interest}} payments and other income have exceeded benefit payments and other expenditures, for example {{by more than}} $150 billion in 2004. As the [...] "baby boomers" [...] {{move out of the}} work force and into retirement, however, expenses will come to exceed tax receipts and then, after several more years, will exceed all OASDI trust income, including interest. At that point the system will begin drawing on its trust fund Treasury Notes, and will continue to pay benefits at the current levels until the Trust Fund is exhausted. In 2013, the OASDI retirement insurance fund collected $731.1 billion and spent $645.5 billion; the disability program (DI) collected $109.1 billion and spent $140.3 billion; Medicare (HI) collected $243.0 and spent $266.8 billion and Supplementary Medical Insurance, SMI, collected $293.9 billion and spent $307.4 billion. In 2013 all Social Security programs except the retirement trust fund (OASDI) spent more than they brought in and relied on significant withdrawals from their respective trust funds <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>their</b> <b>bills.</b> The retirement (OASDI) trust fund of $2,541 billion is expected to be emptied by 2033 by one estimate as new retirees become eligible to join. The disability (DI) trust fund's $153.9 billion will be exhausted by 2018; the Medicare (HI) trust fund of $244.2 billion will be exhausted by 2023 and the Supplemental Medical Insurance (SMI) trust fund will be exhausted by 2020 if the present rate of withdrawals continues—even sooner if they increase. The total [...] "Social Security" [...] expenditures in 2013 were $1,360 billion dollars, which was 8.4% of the $16,200 billion GNP (2013) and 37.0% of the federal expenditures of $3,684 billion (including a $971.0 billion deficit). All other parts of the Social Security program: medicare (HI), disability (DI) and Supplemental Medical (SMI) trust funds are already drawing down their trust funds and are projected to go into deficit in about 2020 if the present rate of withdrawals continue. As the trust funds are exhausted either benefits will have to be cut, fraud minimized or taxes increased. According to the Center for Economic and Policy Research, upward redistribution of income is responsible for about 43% of the projected Social Security shortfall over the next 75 years.|$|E

50|$|An {{ordinance}} {{passed on}} April 14, 1898, established a yearly rate schedule for residences with running water.

A residence with one tap was charged $5.00 and a private bathtub cost an additional $2.00. Saloon keepers paid $7.00 for one faucet, $3.00 for each additional faucet and $1.00 for each billiard table. Each cow a person owned cost $1.00.

60|$|At {{that time}} the French West India Company had a colonial {{establishment}} {{on the island of}} Tortuga, which was principally inhabited, as we have seen before, by buccaneers in all their various grades and stages, from beef-driers to pirates. The French authorities undertook to supply these erratic people with the goods and provisions which they needed, and built storehouses with everything necessary for carrying on the trade. There were plenty of purchasers, for the buccaneers were willing to buy everything which could be brought from Europe. They were fond of good wine, good groceries, good firearms, and ammunition, fine cutlasses, and very often good clothes, in which they could disport themselves when on shore. But they had peculiar customs and manners, and although they were willing to buy as much as the French traders had to sell, they could not be prevailed upon <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>their</b> <b>bills.</b> A pirate is not the sort of a man who generally cares to pay his bills. When he gets goods in any way, he wants them charged to him, and if that charge includes the features of robbery and murder, he will probably make no objection. But as for paying good money for what is received, that is quite another thing.|$|E

60|$|I {{have some}} {{acquaintance}} among the ghost-seers of western villages. The Connaught tales {{are very different}} from those of Leinster. These H----- spirits have a gloomy, matter-of-fact way with them. They come to announce a death, to fulfil some obligation, to revenge a wrong, <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>their</b> <b>bills</b> even--as did a fisherman's daughter the other day--and then hasten to their rest. All things they do decently and in order. It is demons, and not ghosts, that transform themselves into white cats or black dogs. The people who tell the tales are poor, serious-minded fishing people, who find in the doings of the ghosts the fascination of fear. In the western tales is a whimsical grace, a curious extravagance. The people who recount them live in the most wild and beautiful scenery, under a sky ever loaded and fantastic with flying clouds. They are farmers and labourers, who do a little fishing now and then. They do not fear the spirits too much to feel an artistic and humorous pleasure in their doings. The ghosts themselves share in their quaint hilarity. In one western town, on whose deserted wharf the grass grows, these spirits have so much vigour that, when a misbeliever ventured to sleep in a haunted house, I have been told they flung him through the window, and his bed after him. In the surrounding villages the creatures use the most strange disguises. A dead old gentleman robs the cabbages of his own garden {{in the shape of a}} large rabbit. A wicked sea-captain stayed for years inside the plaster of a cottage wall, in the shape of a snipe, making the most horrible noises. He was only dislodged when the wall was broken down; then out of the solid plaster the snipe rushed away whistling.|$|E
