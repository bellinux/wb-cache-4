5|$|In 1964, Houston Lighting and Power began {{construction}} on two 450 MW electric generating units in Bacliff {{as part of}} the company's Project Enterprise expansion. The units were of supercritical boiler design, which was <b>then</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> technology. The power plant, originally known as the Bacliff Plant, was renamed the P. H. Robinson plant, in honor of company president Perk H. Robinson.|$|E

5|$|During the Second World War {{the head}} of the NFB, John Grierson, {{promoted}} Newman to film producer, working on documentaries and propaganda films, including Fighting Norway, which he directed. In 1944 he was made executive producer of Canada Carries On, a long-running series of such films. In 1949 Grierson again assisted Newman's career, entering him into television, <b>then</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> industry, on a one-year attachment to NBC in New York City. His assignment there was to compile reports for the Canadian government on American television techniques, focusing on dramas, documentaries and outside broadcasts.|$|E

50|$|Invermere {{was built}} at Golden, British Columbia, in 1912 by riverboat captain Alexander Blakely Although {{built in the}} style of a steamboat, Invermere was powered by a {{gasoline}} or diesel engine, <b>then</b> <b>a</b> <b>newer</b> method of marine propulsion. In 1914, Invermere was licensed to carry 20 passengers.|$|R
5|$|He {{was born}} in Temple Fortune, which was <b>then</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> suburb on the {{north-western}} edge of London. His father {{died when he was}} two years old, after the family had moved to Southend-on-Sea, Essex. His mother then moved with him to Brighton, Sussex, where they lived with her parents above a shop. Merrifield's archaeological career began in 1930 when, although still at school, he was taken on as an assistant to the curator of Brighton Museum, H. S. Toms. While working there, in 1935, he gained an external degree in anthropology from the University of London.|$|E
5|$|It was in Brockville {{that the}} 21-year-old Jennings started his rise in broadcasting. In 1959, CFJR, a local radio station, hired {{him as a}} member of its news department; many of his stories, {{including}} his coverage of a local train wreck, were picked up by the CBC. By 1961, Jennings had joined the staff of CJOH-TV, <b>then</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> television station in Ottawa. When the station launched in March 1961, Jennings was initially an interviewer and co-producer for Vue, a late-night news program. His producers saw a youthful attractiveness in him that resembled that of Dick Clark, and Jennings soon found himself hosting Club Thirteen, a dance show similar to American Bandstand.|$|E
5|$|Work {{continued}} {{on the new}} expressway {{over the next several}} years, wrapping up in mid-1997. By <b>then,</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> Progressive Conservative government was in power, and committed $100 million towards the two projects. An opening ceremony was held on October5, 1997, with local, regional and provincial politicians in attendance. The new expressway opened to vehicular traffic ten days later on October15. The cost of the parkway, initially projected at $187 million, was under budget at $180 million.|$|E

5|$|Although the ZNDH was {{now able}} to mount a {{credible}} threat against the insurgents, by <b>then</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> menace was arriving {{from the other side}} of the Adriatic. On 30 June 1943, the first Allied reconnaissance flights were reported, followed by the first USAAF bombers, when 61 B-24 Liberators of IX Bomber Command overflew the NDH on a deep penetration raid on the Austrian city of Wiener Neustadt on 13 August. The ZNDH's 3rd Flak Group, defending Brod na Savi (Slavonski Brod), managed to shoot down a single bomber en route to its target. The best aircraft that the ZNDH could put up to defend its homeland at the end of 1943 were 20 Morane-Saulnier M.S.406s, 10 Fiat G.50s, six Fiat CR.42s, five Avia BH-33s and two Ikarus IK-2 fighters – aircraft that had been obsolete in 1940.|$|E
5|$|In the meantime, Christian Selmer was impeached on 27 February; {{his cabinet}} members {{followed}} one by one, the last being impeached on 1 April. On 11 March, Selmer resigned. Two acting Prime Ministers {{were drawn from}} his cabinet; Ole Bachke from 11 to 29 March and Niels Mathias Rye from 29 March to 3 April. <b>Then,</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> cabinet led by Selmer's former Minister of Finance Christian Homann Schweigaard was formed, but in reality it stood no chance of surviving as it faced the Liberal-dominated Parliament, whose means of pressuring the executive branch had been strengthened following the Impeachment trial. In June, as Schweigaard entered his last month as Prime Minister, the King summoned mathematics professor Ole Jacob Broch to form a compromise cabinet, but this failed owing to Conservative opposition, spearheaded by up-and-coming politician Emil Stang. Broch gave up on 22 June, and Johan Sverdrup became Prime Minister on 26 June. In light of this change in circumstances, the case against Hol had been annulled by Royal Resolution earlier on 6 June.|$|E
5|$|The first {{transportation}} routes along {{what is now}} US23 in {{the state}} were sections of two Indian trails. The route {{of what is now}} US23 follows portions of two separate trails. In the early 20th century, four different auto trail names were applied to roads now a part of the highway. These roads were included as part of two state highways in the initial state highway system in 1919. When the United States Numbered Highway System was first designated on November 11, 1926, the new US23 replaced the other designations along its route. Since creation, the road has been moved and realigned several times. Through the 1930s and 1940s, the lakeshore routing was created to replace a path that ran further inland through the northern portion of the state. Starting in the early 1950s, various sections in the southeastern and central areas of the LP were upgraded to freeways, bypassing several major cities in the area. These improvements were completed {{by the end of the}} 1960s. Since <b>then</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> crossing of the Saginaw River at Zilwaukee was built to replace a drawbridge that carried the I-75/US23 freeway over a shipping channel.|$|E

5|$|During the First World War {{hundreds}} of Somerset soldiers were killed, and war memorials were {{put up in}} most of the towns and villages; only a few villages escaped casualties. There were also casualties– though much fewer– during the Second World War, who were added to the memorials. The county was a base for troops preparing for the 1944 D-Day landings, and some Somerset hospitals still date partly from that time. The Royal Ordnance Factory ROF Bridgwater was constructed early in World War II for the Ministry of Supply. It was designed as an Explosive ROF, to produce RDX, which was <b>then</b> <b>a</b> <b>new</b> experimental high-explosive. It obtained water supplies from two sources via the Somerset Levels: the artificial Huntspill River which was dug during the construction of the factory and also from the King's Sedgemoor Drain, which was widened at the same time. The Taunton Stop Line was set up to resist a potential German invasion, and the remains of its pill boxes can still be seen, as well as others along the coast. A decoy town was constructed on Black Down, intended to represent the blazing lights of a town which had neglected to follow the black-out regulations. Sites in the county housed Prisoner of War camps including: Norton Fitzwarren, Barwick, Brockley, Goathurst and Wells. Various airfields were built or converted from civilian use including: RNAS Charlton Horethorne (HMS Heron II), RAF Weston-super-Mare, RNAS Yeovilton (HMS Heron), Yeovil/Westland Airport, RAF Weston Zoyland, RAF Merryfield, RAF Culmhead and RAF Charmy Down.|$|E

25|$|The town of Yellow Grass {{first started}} {{thinking}} about sanitation in the early 1900s when cesspools were designated for controlled removal of sewage.

Sewer lines were installed in 1958, that system has remained largely unchanged since <b>then.</b> <b>A</b> <b>new</b> water treatment plant was installed in 2011, providing the town with much better water quality as before.|$|E
