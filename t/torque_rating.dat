40|$|A {{practical}} pinch torque estimator {{based on}} the H∞ filter is proposed for low-cost anti-pinch window control systems. To obtain the acceptable angular velocity measurements, the angular velocity calculation algorithm was proposed with the measurement noise reduction logics in previous method. Apart from the previous works {{based on the}} angular velocity or torque estimates for detecting the pinched condition, the proposed pinch detection algorithm makes use of the <b>torque</b> <b>rate</b> information integrated with state flow chart. To do this, the <b>torque</b> <b>rate</b> is augmented to the system model and the <b>torque</b> <b>rate</b> estimator is derived by applying the steady-state H∞ filter recursion to the model. The motivation of this approach comes from {{the idea that the}} <b>torque</b> <b>rate</b> is less sensitive to the motor parameter uncertainties. Moreover, the statistics of modeling errors and angular velocity measurement noises are actually unknown. Hence, the proposed scheme minimizes the anti-pinch window control system's exposure to the false alarm. To detect the pinched condition, a systematic way to determine the threshold level of the <b>torque</b> <b>rate</b> estimates is also suggested via the deterministic estimation error analysis. Experimental results certify the pinch detection performance of the proposed algorithm and its robustness against the motor parameter uncertainties...|$|R

5000|$|When {{considering}} torque, {{the question}} of using dynamic or static torque for the application is key.

However, if a machine is running at 3,000rpm and the same full torque is required the result {{will not be the}} same because of the difference between static and dynamic torques.

METHODS: Twenty-six volunteers aged 75 to 83 years were studied using a Cybex® 6000 isokinetic dynamometer. The chosen angular velocity was 60 º/s, and concentric exercise was used for either flexion or extension. The studied parameters were: peak torque, angle of peak torque, and flexor-extensor <b>torque</b> <b>rate.</b> RESULTS: There were no differences between dominant (D) and nondominant (ND) knee peak torque values.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} the effect of load on lower extremity biomechanics during the pull-phase of the clean. Kinematic and kinetic data of the three joints of the lower extremity were collected while participants performed multiple sets of cleans at three percentages: 65, 75, and 85 % of 1 -Reptition maximum (RM). General linear models with repeated measures were used to assess the influence of load on angular velocities, net <b>torques,</b> powers, and <b>rates</b> of <b>torque</b> development at the ankle, knee, and hip joint. The results suggest that the biomechanical demands required from the lower extremities change with the lifted load and to an extent depend on the respective joint. Most notably, the hip and knee extended significantly faster than the ankle independent of load, while the hip and ankle generally produced significantly higher torques than the knee. <b>Torque,</b> <b>rate</b> of <b>torque</b> development, and power at the ankle and knee joint were maximal at 85 % and 75 % of 1 -RM, respectively, whereas <b>torque</b> and <b>rate</b> of <b>torque</b> development at the hip were maximal at loads above 75 % and 85 % of 1 -RM, respectively.
