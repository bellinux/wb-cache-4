40|$|Copal from Agathis tree {{has been}} one of {{important}} forest products, not only as export commodity but also as raw material for some induatries. In the last few years however production in this country began to decrease, due to inefficient tapping by the forest worker. Because of this reason a study on the tapping procedure is necessary. Thia report deals with a preliminary study on the present “quarre” type of tapping procedure commonly adopted by the forest worker. The locality chosen was Gede Barat Sub forest district at Sukabumi, West Java. Three factors were chosen for the tapping study, namely the effect on of resin productivity of the location of the wound with respect to west and east direction (factor A), time of <b>tapping</b> (<b>factor</b> B) and type of wound covering (factor C). The result of this study show that :Covering of tap wound does not cause incoveniences to the worker. Resin productivity is not significantly affected by the wound location.

The paper uses data from the Puerto Rico Fertility and Family Planning Assessment of 1982, which includes detailed retrospective calendar histories of women's employment and other life-course changes. An event history approach allows an examination of the effects of human capital, family status, socialization, and opportunity structure in the labor market on women's entry into male-dominated occupations and their subsequent shifts to other occupations. The findings indicate that women's entry into male-dominated occupations increased for first jobs during this period of economic development, and there was modest cross gender-type mobility among women who experienced job changes.

While we know an increasing amount about the issue-based activity of groups, we only have a limited understanding about how they selected these issues to work on. In this article, we examine the process of agenda setting within groups. In particular, we address challenges of conceptualization and measurement. Through a thorough review of the group literature, we identify five main factors that are hypothesized to drive issue prioritization. We operationalize items to <b>tap</b> these <b>factors</b> and then empirically assess this theoretical model relying on data from a survey of national interest groups in Australia. Our findings, from a confirmatory factor analysis, provide support for the multidimensional nature of agenda setting.

40|$|A {{cellular}} pre-mRNA undergoes various post-transcriptional processing events, including capping, splicing and polyadenylation {{prior to}} nuclear export. Splicing {{is particularly important}} for mRNA nuclear export as two distinct multiprotein complexes, known as human TREX (hTREX) and the exon-junction complex (EJC), are recruited to the mRNA in a splicing-dependent manner. In contrast, a number of Kaposi’s sarcoma–associated herpesvirus (KSHV) lytic mRNAs lack introns and are exported by the virus-encoded ORF 57 protein. Herein we show that ORF 57 binds to intronless viral mRNAs and functions to recruit the complete hTREX complex, but not the EJC, in order assemble an export component viral ribonucleoprotein particle (vRNP). The formation of this vRNP is mediated by a direct interaction between ORF 57 and the hTREX export adapter protein, Aly. Aly in turn interacts directly with the DEAD-box protein UAP 56, which functions as a bridge to recruit the remaining hTREX proteins to the complex. Moreover, we show that a point mutation in ORF 57 which disrupts the ORF 57 -Aly interaction leads to a failure in the ORF 57 -mediated recruitment of the entire hTREX complex to the intronless viral mRNA and inhibits the mRNAs subsequent nuclear export and virus replication. Furthermore, we have utilised a trans-dominant Aly mutant to prevent the assembly of the complete ORF 57 -hTREX complex; {{this results in a}} vRNP consisting of viral mRNA bound to ORF 57, Aly and the nuclear export <b>factor,</b> <b>TAP.</b> Strikingly, although both the export adapter Aly and the export <b>factor</b> <b>TAP</b> were present on the viral mRNP, a dramatic decrease in intronless viral mRNA expor...|$|R

40|$|A person’s {{willingness}} to communicate (WTC), believed {{to stem from}} a combination of proximal and distal variables comprising psychological, linguistic, educational and communicative dimensions of language, appears to be a significant predictor of success in language learning. The ability to communicate is both a means and end of language education, since, on the one hand, being able to express the intended meanings in the target language is generally perceived as the main purpose of any language course and, on the other, linguistic development proceeds in the course of language use. However, MacIntyre (2007, p. 564) observes that some learners, despite extensive study, may never become successful L 2 speakers. The inability or un{{willingness to}} sustain contacts with more competent language users may influence the way learners are evaluated in various social contexts. Establishing social networks as a result of frequent communication with target language users is believed to foster linguistic development. WTC, initially considered a stable personality trait and then a result of context-dependent influences, has recently been viewed as a dynamic phenomenon changing its intensity within one communicative event (MacIntyre and Legatto, 2011; MacIntyre et al., 2011).

Other failure modes are known but have received only limited study. These include (i) excessive force and creep; (ii) chemical interaction effects; and (iii) breakdown under voltage surge conditions. Additional research is needed in these areas. The proximate cause of ignition involved with many of the above mechanisms is arc tracking (arcing across a carbonized path). In turn, it is shown that PVC is especially susceptible to becoming charred, it requiring only approximately 160 ºC for the material to become semiconducting during short-term exposure (around 10 h), while longer-term exposure (around 1 month) may cause failures at temperatures as low as 110 ºC. Some limited data exist which suggest that standard UL and IEC temperature classifications are unduly optimistic, as applied to PVC. Mains-connected electrical appliances need to be designed to resist 6000 V surge voltages, even though this is not mandated in most of the current UL standards.

40|$|We {{recently}} {{described an}} RNA-binding protein, Y 14, that binds preferentially to spliced mRNAs and persists in the cytoplasm. Y 14 {{is part of}} a multi-protein complex that also contains the mRNA export <b>factor</b> <b>TAP.</b> This suggests that splicing imprints the mRNA with a unique set of proteins that communicate the history of the transcript to the cytoplasm. Here, using microinjection of pre-mRNAs into Xenopus oocyte nuclei followed by immunoprecipitation of RNase-fragmented mRNAs from the cytoplasm, we show that Y 14 is stably bound to sequences immediately upstream of exon–exon junctions. This feature appears to be unique to Y 14. Using monoclonal antibodies that we produced against Aly/REF, another component recently reported to be an mRNA export factor, we show that Aly/REF is associated with spliced mRNAs in the nucleus but is not detectable on mRNAs in the cytoplasm. Thus, we propose that the splicing- dependent binding of Y 14 provides a position-specific molecular memory that communicates to the cytoplasm the location of exon and intron boundaries.

We now demonstrate that TAp 63 α directly induces AP- 2 γ expression in embryonic epidermis, when commitment to stratification occurs. Furthermore, we show that, in the absence of AP- 2 γ, TAp 63 α fails to induce K 14 expression in vitro.
