5|$|Since common {{starlings}} eat {{insect pests}} such as wireworms, {{they are considered}} beneficial in northern Eurasia, {{and this was one}} of the reasons given for introducing the birds elsewhere. Around 25million nest boxes were erected for this species in the former Soviet Union, and common starlings were found to be effective in controlling the grass grub Costelytra zelandica in New Zealand. The original Australian introduction was facilitated by the provision of nest boxes to help this mainly insectivorous bird to breed successfully, and even in the US, where this is a pest species, the Department of Agriculture acknowledges <b>that</b> <b>vast</b> numbers of insects are consumed by common starlings.|$|E

25|$|Another {{case where}} {{forensic}} entomology was used successfully {{deals with a}} body being reported to be thrown down a well. When authorities searched for the well in southern Indiana, it was clear they found the correct one. Thousands of flies where flying over material blocking the well. The pungent smell {{and the fact that}} the flies could not access the body created this swarm. Given <b>that</b> <b>vast</b> number of wells in the area, the presence of the flies indicated the body’s presence allowing it to be found in a timely manner. The use of entomology is not only important in determining when a person has died, but also simply locating a corpse.|$|E

He recounted how on his first broadcast, sitting in the studio, apprehensive at the thought of being about to talk live to a potential audience of millions, his director had reminded him that although <b>that</b> <b>vast</b> audience might be statistically daunting, it was more likely to be two or three people and perhaps a dog sitting in their front room. He aimed at conversing with such an audience {{for the rest of his}} career.

25|$|Like other pharaohs of the Old Kingdom period, Neferefre {{benefited from}} a funerary cult {{established}} at his death. Some details of this cult as it occurred during the Fifth Dynasty have survived in the Abusir papyri. We learn that a ten days long yearly festival was held {{in honor of the}} deceased ruler during which, on at least one occasion, no less than 130 bulls were sacrified in the slaughter house of his mortuary temple. This large number testifies to the importance that royal funerary cults had in Ancient Egyptian society. The main benefactors of these sacrifices were the priests participating in the cult, who would consume the offerings after the required ceremonies. This also shows <b>that</b> <b>vast</b> agricultural resources were devoted to an activity judged unproductive by the Egyptologists Verner and Zemina something which, they propose, possibly contributed to the decline of the Old Kingdom.|$|E

Acknowledging the opposing view supporting citizenship for American-born Chinese, he said that [...] "Of course, the argument on the other side is that the very words of the constitution embrace such a case." [...] Commenting on the Wong Kim Ark case shortly after the issuance of the Court's ruling in 1898, San Francisco attorney Marshall B. Woodworth wrote that [...] "the error the dissent apparently falls into {{is that it does not}} recognize that the United States, as a sovereign power, has the right to adopt any rule of citizenship it may see fit, and that the rule of international law does not furnish [...] the sole and exclusive test of citizenship of the United States".|$|E
