50|$|Evidence {{supporting}} {{a role for}} miR-92 in hepatocellular cancer (HCC) was derived from in situ hybridisation experiments of tumours. Over expression of miR-92 was well pronounced across sex, age, virus type, clinical stage, and <b>tumour</b> <b>differentiation</b> stage, making miR-92 a potential robust biomarker for HCC. Transfection of human HCC cell lines with anti-miR-92a antagomir (complementary RNA strand that triggers depletion of target miRNA) reduced the proliferation rate of the cell line versus transfection with a control oligonucleotide. Following a similar principle to the proposed miR-92 uptake by leukaemia cells (see above), transfection with additional miR-92a increased the proliferation rate of 2 out of 3 of the already-proliferating cancerous cell lines.|$|E
5000|$|Mesothelin is a <b>tumour</b> <b>differentiation</b> antigen that is {{normally}} {{present on the}} mesothelial cells lining the pleura, peritoneum and pericardium. Since mesothelin is overexpressed in several cancers and is immunogenic, the protein could be exploited as tumor marker or as the antigenic target of a therapeutic cancer vaccine. A 2016 review indicates that some immunotherapeutic strategies have shown encouraging results in early-phase clinical trials. Elevations of serum mesothelin specific to ovarian and other cancer patients may be measured using ELISA assays. [...] Assays for blood-bourne mesothelin and MPF for tumor diagnosis, especially applied to asbestos-related mesothelioma have been developed. [...] Elevated serum mesothelin was found in most patients with mesothelioma (71%) and ovarian cancer (67%). [...] Blood MPF and mesothelin levels were correlated, with modest accuracy for malignant pleural mesothelioma and lung cancer (sensitivity 74% and 59%, specificity 90% and 86%, respectively for MPF and mesothelin assays). [...] Circulating mesothelin is reported in nearly all pancreatic cancers, [...] however the levels in healthy persons often exceed 80 ng/mL (using 40 kD molecular weight as the conversion factor) and to widely overlap the values in the pancreatic cancer patients. It was noted that the cutoff levels for normal could differ as much as 10-fold among publications, depending on the assay used (compare Sharon et al. [...] and Iwahori et al. with Hassan et al.) and thus that normal levels must be determined anew when new assays are introduced.|$|E

40|$|AIM: Survival after pancreaticoduodenectomy for periampullary tumours is limited. Over {{the last}} decade {{peri-operative}} management has improved and morbidity and mortality decreased. The aim {{of the study was}} to analyse recent survival data after pancreaticoduodenectomy and to determine factors that influence survival. METHODS: From October 1992 to September 1998, 204 patients with a ductal adenocarcinoma in the pancreatic head (108), distal bile duct (32), and ampulla (64) who underwent standard pancreaticoduodenectomy, were analysed with regard to histology and tumour status. Survival was calculated by using the Kaplan-Meier method. Risk factors were identified in a univariate and multivariate analysis. RESULTS: Median survival after resection for carcinoma of the pancreatic head, distal bile duct, and ampulla were 16, 25 and 24 months, respectively (P= 0. 008). In the univariate analysis vein resection, blood transfusion of more than four packed red cells, the presence of tumour positive resection margins, lymph-node metastases and poor <b>tumour</b> <b>differentiation</b> significantly decreased survival.

The {{aim of this}} study was to evaluate the survival of patients with HCCs measuring at least 10 cm and to identify the potential prognostic variables affecting the outcome. Methods: Retrospective analysis was performed on the prospectively updated HCC database. A total of 44 patients with tumours measuring 10 cm or more were 'curatively' treated with surgical resection with or without ablation. Patient demographics, clinical, surgical, pathology and survival data were collected and analysed. Results: Thirty-one patients received surgical resection alone. Thirteen other patients were treated with a combination of surgical resection and ablation. The median follow-up duration was 14. 5 months. The overall median survival at 1, 3 and 5 years were 66. 4 %, 38. 1 % and 27. 8 %, respectively. The median time to tumour recurrence was 10. 7 months and the 1, 3 and 5 -year disease-free survival were 49. 6 %, 23. 9 % and 19. 1 %, respectively.

MethodsThe study included 134 patients who underwent curative hepatectomy for hepatitis B virus (HBV) -related primary HCC. The clinical, laboratory and pathological data from these patients were retrospectively collected.

METHODS: We studied the prognostic value of immunohistochemical expression of PROX 1 {{in a series of}} 517 patients with colorectal cancer (CRC). RESULTS: The majority of the tumour samples expressed PROX 1 (91 %, 471 out of 517). High PROX 1 expression was associated with a poor grade of <b>tumour</b> <b>differentiation</b> (Po 0. 0001). In the subgroup of patients with colon cancer, high PROX 1 expression was associated with unfavourable colorectal cancer-specific survival (CCSS) as compared with low PROX 1 expression (CCSS 47 % vs 62 %; P 0. 045; RR 1. 47).

METHODS: Sixty seven cervical carcinomas were studied and were classified as adenocarcinomas, adenosquamous carcinomas or squamous cell carcinomas based on the assessment of haematoxylin and eosin staining and stains for mucin. Where features of glandular differentiation were identified, sections were also stained for evidence of intestinal type mucin. CGA immunostaining was done {{and the results were}} graded on a three point scale: 0, + (1 - 5 % of cells positive) and ++ (> 5 % of cells positive). These findings were then analysed with respect to lymph node status, <b>tumour</b> <b>differentiation</b> and clinical outcome. RESULTS: There were 32 adenocarcinomas, 18 adenosquamous carcinomas and 17 squamous cell carcinomas. Positive staining was seen in 14 (20. 9 %) cases, of which four were strongly positive.
