50|$|Commercial {{wind power}} in Indiana began in 2008 when the Benton County Wind Farm came online. New {{estimates}} of wind resources in 2006 raised the potential wind power capacity for Indiana from 30 MW at 50 m <b>turbine</b> <b>hub</b> height to 40,000 MW at 70 m, which could double at 100 m, {{the height of}} newer turbines. At the end of June, 2008, Indiana had installed 130 MW of wind turbines and had under construction another 400 MW. , Indiana had a total of 1035.95 MW of wind power nameplate capacity installed, with more under construction or in planning.|$|E
50|$|At night time, or {{when the}} {{atmosphere}} becomes stable, wind speed {{close to the ground}} usually subsides whereas at <b>turbine</b> <b>hub</b> altitude it does not decrease that much or may even increase. As a result, the wind speed is higher and a turbine will produce more power than expected from the 1/7 power law: doubling the altitude may increase wind speed by 20% to 60%. A stable atmosphere is caused by radiative cooling of the surface and is common in a temperate climate: it usually occurs when there is a (partly) clear sky at night. When the (high altitude) wind is strong (a 10-meter wind speed higher than approximately 6 to 7 m/s) the stable atmosphere is disrupted because of friction turbulence and the atmosphere will turn neutral. A daytime atmosphere is either neutral (no net radiation; usually with strong winds and heavy clouding) or unstable (rising air because of ground heating—by the sun). Here again the 1/7 power law applies or is at least a good approximation of the wind profile. Indiana had been rated as having a wind capacity of 30,000 MW, but by raising the expected turbine height from 50 m to 70 m, the wind capacity estimate was raised to 40,000 MW, and could be double that at 100 m.|$|E
50|$|Meteorological {{forecasts}} {{are given}} at specific nodes of a grid covering an area. Since wind farms are not situated on these nodes, {{it is then}} needed to extrapolate these forecasts at the desired location and at <b>turbine</b> <b>hub</b> height. Physical-based forecasting methods consist of several sub-models which altogether deliver the translation from the wind forecast at a certain grid point and model level, to power forecast at the site considered. Every sub-model contains the mathematical description of the physical processes relevant to the translation. Knowledge of all relevant processes is therefore crucial when developing a purely physical prediction method (such as the early versions of the Danish Prediktor). The core idea of physical approaches is to refine the NWPs by using physical considerations about the terrain such as the roughness, orography and obstacles, and by modeling the local wind profile possibly accounting for atmospheric stability. The two main alternatives to do so are: (i) to combine the modeling of the wind profile (with a logarithmic assumption {{in most of the}} cases) and the geostrophic drag law for obtaining surface winds; (ii) to use a CFD (Computational Fluid Dynamics) code that allows one to accurately compute the wind field that the farm will see, considering a full description of the terrain.|$|E
30|$|Wind turbine {{converts}} {{kinetic energy}} of the wind into AC electricity according to a particular power curve. Each hour, power output of the wind turbine is calculated in a four-step process. Firstly, it determines the average wind speed for the hour at the anemometer height by referring to the wind resource data. Secondly, it calculates the corresponding wind speed at the <b>turbine’s</b> <b>hub</b> height using either the logarithmic law or the power law. Thirdly, {{it refers to the}} turbine’s power curve to calculate its power output at that wind speed assuming standard air density. Fourthly, it multiplies output power by air density ratio.|$|R
40|$|The present {{paper is}} aimed {{to assess the}} {{potential}} of renewable energy resources, namely wind and solar, at Aqaba city located in the southern region of Jordan. Long-term measured data of wind speed and solar irradiation at the site are utilized in this study. Skew-Normal (SN) distribution is used to describe wind speeds and irradiance levels. The main feature of SN distribution over, the well known, Weibull distribution {{is the possibility of}} applying it to a data set having zero values. The goodness-of-fit of SN-model is demonstrated graphically, via Chi-Square (CS) distribution and through Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) statistical test. To show the effect of <b>turbine</b> <b>hub's</b> height, wind speed characteristics and wind power potential are estimated at different heights. The recorded solar irradiation levels are separated into three clusters and SN distribution is used to fit the data of each cluster. Solar insolation characteristics; mean and most occurrence insolations, and irradiance power potential are computed and presented in this paper.

40|$|Depending {{on their}} input, wind power {{forecasting}} models {{are classified as}} physical or statistical approaches {{or a combination of}} both. Physical models use physical considerations, as meteorological information (Numerical Weather Prediction) and technical characteristics of the wind <b>turbines</b> (<b>hub</b> height, power curve, thrust coefficient). Statistical models use explanatory variables and online measurements, usually employing recursive techniques, like recursive least squares or artificial neural networks (ANNs) which perform a non-linear mapping and provide a robust approach for wind prediction. In this paper a new hybrid method (mixing physical and statistical approaches) is proposed, based on the wavelet decomposition technique and on artificial neural networks, in order to predict power production of a wind farm in different time horizons: 1, 3, 6, 12 and 24 hours. In particular, two approaches are compared, both based on the time series of on-line measured wind power and on the Numerical Weather Predictions; in the first approach, the forecast is carried out only through the training of a neural network which, in the second approach is, instead, used in combination with the wavelet decomposition technique, improving the performance especially over the short time horizons. The error of the different forecast systems is investigated for various forecasting horizons and statistical distributions of the error are calculated and presented...|$|R
40|$|Wind farm layout {{optimization}} is {{an effective}} means to mitigate the wind power losses caused by the wake interventions between wind turbines. Most of the researches {{in the field are}} conducted on the basis of fixed wind <b>turbine</b> <b>hub</b> height, while it has been proved that different hub height turbines may contribute to the reduction of wake power losses and increase the wind farm energy production. To demonstrate this effect, the results of simple two-wind-turbine model are reported by fixing the first wind <b>turbine</b> <b>hub</b> height while varying the second one. Then the optimization results for a wind farm are reported under three different wind conditions, consisting of constant wind speed and wind direction, constant wind speed and variable wind directions, and variable wind speeds and variable wind directions. Unlike the previous researches using the grid based method to conduct the optimization studies, the wind farm layout optimization with differing hub heights is carried out using the unrestricted coordinate method in this paper for the first time. Different optimization methods are applied for the wind farm optimization study to investigate their effectiveness by comparison. It shows that the selection of the identical wind <b>turbine</b> <b>hub</b> height yields the least power production with the most intensive wake effect. The value of optimum wind <b>turbine</b> <b>hub</b> height is dependent on several factors including the surface roughness length, spacing between the two wind turbines and the blowing wind direction. The simultaneous optimization method is more effective for the complex wind conditions than for the simple constant wind condition...|$|E
40|$|Extensive {{power losses}} of wind farm have been {{witnessed}} {{due to the}} wake interactions between wind turbines. By applying analytical wake models which describe the wind speed deficits in the wake quantitatively, the power losses can be regained {{to a large extent}} through wind farm layout optimization, and this has been extensively reported in literature. Nevertheless, the effectiveness of the analytical wake models in predicting the wind farm power production have rarely been studied and compared for wind farm with both constant and variable wind <b>turbine</b> <b>hub</b> heights. In this study, the effectiveness of three different analytical wake models (PARK model, Larsen model and B-P model) is thoroughly compared over a wide range of wake properties. After the validation with the observation data from offshore wind farm, CFD simulations are used to verify the effectiveness of the analytical wake models for an onshore wind farm. The results show that when using the PARK model the surface roughness value (z 0) must be carefully tuned to achieve good performance in predicting the wind farm power production. For the other two analytical wake models, their effectiveness varies depending on the situation of wind farm (offshore or onshore) and the wind <b>turbine</b> <b>hub</b> heights (constant or variable). It was found that the results of B-P model agree well with the CFD simulations for offshore wind farm, but not for the onshore wind farm. The Larsen model is more accurate for the wind farm with variable wind <b>turbine</b> <b>hub</b> heights than those with constant wind <b>turbine</b> <b>hub</b> height...|$|E

40|$|Thesis (Master's) [...] University of Washington, 2013 Marine Hydrokinetic (MHK) {{turbines}} are {{a growing}} {{area of research}} in the renewable energy field because tidal currents are a highly predictable clean energy source. The presence of a free surface may influence the flow around the turbine and in the wake, critically affecting turbine performance and environmental effects through modification of the wake physical variables. The characteristic Froude number that control these processes is still a matter of controversy, with the channel depth, the <b>turbine's</b> <b>hub</b> depth, the blade tip depth and the turbine diameter as potential candidates for a length scale. We use a Reynolds Averaged Navier Stokes (RANS) simulation with a Blade Element Theory (BET) model of the turbine and with a Volume of Fluid model, which is used to track the free surface dynamics, to understand the physics of the wake-free surface interactions. Pressure and flow rate boundary conditions for a channel's inlet, outlet and air side have been tested in an effort to determine the optimum set of simulation conditions for MHK turbines in rivers or shallow estuaries. Stability and accuracy in terms of power extraction and kinetic and potential energy budgets are considered. The goal of this research is to determine, quantitatively in non-dimensional parameter space, the limit between negligible and significant free surface effects on MHK turbine analysis...|$|R
40|$|The {{onset of}} dynamic stall in {{horizontal}} axis wind turbines (HAWTs) {{is related to}} the rapid increase in the angle of attack caused by sudden changes in wind speed and direction. In order to relate the changes in wind speed and direction with the variations in the blade-section angle of attack, an analytical model is proposed to determine the regions of the blade affected by dynamic stall. The so-called threshold radius has been identified and defined as the percentage of the blade length from the horizontal axis wind <b>turbines</b> <b>hub</b> beyond which the probability of dynamic stall occurrence falls to zero. High quality wind data were acquired to determine the average wind conditions that serve as the model inputs. It is shown that the rate of change of wind speed, due to gusts or the average turbulence, can cause large regions of dynamic stall on the wind turbine blade. Other parameters, such as the yaw misalignment and the rate of change of yaw angle are shown to be the cause of asymmetrical distribution of threshold radius with azimuth and also serve to increase the affected regions. Finally it is shown that the type of airfoil used in the turbine blade also has a significant effect on the threshold radius due to the different limiting reduced frequencies.

40|$|The current {{designs of}} wind turbine hubs contain many faults.

The Modern Era Retrospective-Analysis for Research and Applications (MERRA) boundary layer flux data {{has been used to}} construct wind profile at 50 m, 80 m, 100 m, 120 m <b>turbine</b> <b>hub</b> heights. The wind power density (WPD) estimates at 50 m are qualitatively similar to those in the US wind atlas developed by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL), but quantitatively a class less in some regions, but are within the limits of uncertainty. The wind speeds at 80 m were quantitatively and qualitatively close to the NREL wind map. The possible reasons for overestimation by NREL have been discussed. For long tailed distributions like those of the WPD, the mean is an overestimation and median is suggested for summary representation of the wind resource. The impact of raising the wind <b>turbine</b> <b>hub</b> height on metrics of abundance, persistence, variability and intermittency is analyzed. There is a general increase in availability and abundance of wind resource but there is an increase in intermittency in terms of level crossing rate in low resource regions...|$|E

30|$|Wind {{power is}} {{impacted}} by wind speed, temperature, humidity, latitude, terrain topography, air pressure, {{and other factors}} [5]. Modeling the behavior of wind is a challenge due to its stochastic nature. The existing forecasting methods can be mainly classified as physical approaches, statistical approaches, {{as well as a}} combination of both [6]. The physical models use physical considerations, such as meteorological (numerical weather predictions), and topological (orography, roughness, obstacles) information and technical characteristics of the wind <b>turbines</b> (<b>hub</b> height, power curve, thrust coefficient) [7]. Statistical models find the relationships between a set of explanatory variables including NWP results and online measured generation data [7]. The basic statistical approach includes the time-series analysis and neural networks, such as Box-Jenkins ARMA (p, q) models, where p represents most recent wind speeds and q represents most recent forecasting errors [8]. Neural network (NN) models have been widely applied in a variety of business fields including accounting, management information systems, marketing, and production management. Many researchers focus on the improvement of NN, including recurrent NN, deep NN and so on [9 – 14]. Extreme Learning Machine(ELM) is based on a single-hidden layer feed-forward neutral network and only needs to calculate random weight between inputting layer and hidden layer. The performance of ELM is better than traditional NN in terms of numerical experiments. Furthermore, the combined models have been widely used to improve wind power forecasting accuracy. Wind power forecasting method based on empirical mode decomposition (EMD) and support vector machine (SVM) was proposed to cope with the nonlinearity and non-stationarity of wind speed data. The combined approach can improve the forecasting accuracy by 5 – 10  % compared to single statistics [15].|$|R
