5|$|At the time, <b>the</b> <b>system</b> <b>was</b> not {{believed}} to have been subtropical. However, there were several post-season findings that confirmed that <b>the</b> <b>system</b> <b>was</b> indeed a subtropical storm. The first was the cloud pattern, in which it had deep convection around the center and was better organized with a well-defined center of circulation. In addition, the system had a warm core more typical of tropical cyclones as opposed to the cold core of extratropical cyclones. The warm-core nature also meant that there were no warm or cold fronts attached to the system, as temperatures did not change ahead of and behind the system until the unrelated cold front passed the Azores. Satellite imagery suggested that <b>the</b> <b>system</b> <b>was</b> briefly a tropical storm as the warm core was found; however, the widespread wind field and the presence of an upper-level trough confirmed that it was merely subtropical.|$|E
