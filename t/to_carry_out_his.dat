5|$|After {{the victory}} at Romani, Murray moved his {{headquarters}} back from Ismailia on the canal to Cairo.

5|$|Boyce financed an {{expedition}} of the explorer Frederick Schwatka to Alaska in 1896. Schwatka discovered gold near Nome and Boyce reported this success in his newspapers, which {{led him to}} finance other Schwatka expeditions {{as well as those}} of other adventurers, including a failed expedition to the Yukon River in 1898. Boyce soon began <b>to</b> <b>carry</b> <b>out</b> <b>his</b> own expeditions. When the United States entered the Spanish–American War in 1898, Boyce set sail for Cuban waters aboard the ship Three Friends. The nature of the activities of Boyce and this ship are unknown.|$|E

5|$|In September 1785, the Barbaulds left Palgrave {{for a tour}} of France; Rochemont's {{mental health}} had been deteriorating and {{he was no longer}} able <b>to</b> <b>carry</b> <b>out</b> <b>his</b> {{teaching}} duties. In 1787, they moved to Hampstead, where Rochemont was asked to serve as the minister at what later became Rosslyn Hill Unitarian Chapel.

5|$|A German {{officer who}} escaped {{reported}} that the German prisoners were being humanely treated, but when Böhme {{became aware of the}} situation, he decided that retaliation was needed. He ordered III.Battalion of the 749th Infantry Regiment, part of the 717th Infantry Division, to burn down Gornji Milanovac and take hostages in order to expedite the recovery of the captured German troops. Due to a misunderstanding by the battalion commander, the unit did not burn down the town on 6October, and released the 170hostages it had arrested. Böhme was furious, and, on 15October, he sent the same battalion back to Gornji Milanovac <b>to</b> <b>carry</b> <b>out</b> <b>his</b> original orders. This was done on 16October.|$|E

5|$|Low, still captaining the Fancy, sailed north. He {{captured}} a whaling vessel 80miles (130km) out at sea, {{and in a}} foul mood following the encounter with the Greyhound {{and the loss of}} Harris, tortured the captain before shooting him through the head. He set the whaler's crew adrift with no provisions, intending them to starve to death. They were lucky, and reached Nantucket, Massachusetts, after a difficult journey. Remaining off the coast of North America, Low's crew took a fishing boat near Block Island. Low decapitated the ship's master, and sent the crew ashore. When he captured two more fishing boats near Rhode Island, his actions became so savage his crew refused <b>to</b> <b>carry</b> <b>out</b> <b>his</b> orders to torture the fishermen.|$|E

5|$|The Court of Chancery could grant three {{possible}} remedies– specific performance, injunctions and damages. The remedy of specific performance is, in contractual matters, an order {{by the court}} which requires the party in breach of contract to perform his obligations. The validity of the contract {{as a whole was}} not normally considered, only whether there was adequate consideration and if expecting the party that breached the contract <b>to</b> <b>carry</b> <b>out</b> <b>his</b> obligations was viable. Injunctions, on the other hand, are remedies which prevent a party from doing something (unlike specific performance, which requires them to do something). Until the Common Law Procedure Act 1854, the Court of Chancery was the only body qualified to grant injunctions and specific performance.|$|E
5|$|A halt {{was called}} for Christmas while {{supplies}} were brought up. Units had a rest day. Most dined on turkey, ham, roast potatoes and Christmas pudding, and Christmas services were held. General Blamey insisted that Christmas fare be available to all units, and extraordinary efforts were made <b>to</b> <b>carry</b> <b>out</b> <b>his</b> directive. In one instance, a Piper Cub of No. 4 Squadron RAAF dropped Christmas fare to a Papuan Company on a long range patrol. The advance resumed on 27 December, preceded by air strikes by 18 B-25 Mitchell and 12 Boston bombers. The 2/15th Infantry Battalion and tanks of A Squadron, 1st Tank Battalion took the lead on 31 December; they reached Sialum on 2 January 1944. This had a sheltered beach which served as a maintenance area. That day, the American landing at Saidor placed a large force across the Japanese escape route.|$|E

5|$|One of {{the more}} {{well-known}} stories about Sun Tzu, taken from Sima Qian, illustrates Sun Tzu's temperament as follows: Before hiring Sun Tzu, the King of Wu tested Sun Tzu's skills by commanding him to train a harem of 180 concubines into soldiers. Sun Tzu divided them into two companies, appointing the two concubines most favored by the king as the company commanders. When Sun Tzu first ordered the concubines to face right, they giggled. In response, Sun Tzu said that the general, in this case himself, was responsible for ensuring that soldiers understood the commands given to them. Then, he reiterated the command, and again the concubines giggled. Sun Tzu then ordered {{the execution of the}} king's two favored concubines, to the king's protests. He explained that if the general's soldiers understood their commands but did not obey, it was the fault of the officers. Sun Tzu also said that, once a general was appointed, it was his duty <b>to</b> <b>carry</b> <b>out</b> <b>his</b> mission, even if the king protested. After both concubines were killed, new officers were chosen to replace them. Afterwards, both companies, now well aware of the costs of further frivolity, performed their maneuvers flawlessly.|$|E
5|$|<b>To</b> <b>carry</b> <b>out</b> <b>his</b> plan, Kean {{organized}} a composite battalion-sized {{task force on}} September 16 under command of Major Robert L. Woolfolk, commanding officer of the 3rd Battalion, 35th Infantry, and ordered it to attack Battle Mountain and P'il-bong the next day, with the mission of restoring the 24th Infantry positions there. On September 17–18 the task force repeatedly attacked these heights, heavily supported by artillery fire from the 8th and 90th Field Artillery Battalions and by numerous air strikes, but North Korean automatic fire from the heights drove back the assaulting troops every time with heavy casualties. Within one day, A Company, 27th Infantry, alone suffered 57 casualties. The 24th Infantry bogged down behind Battle Mountain. Woolfolk's force abandoned its effort to drive the North Korean from the peaks after its failure on September 18, and the task group was dissolved the next day.|$|E
5|$|On 23–24 October, the High Seas Fleet {{undertook}} {{its last}} major offensive operation {{under the command}} of von Pohl, though it ended without contact with British forces. By January 1916 hepatic cancer had weakened von Pohl {{to the point where he}} was no longer able <b>to</b> <b>carry</b> <b>out</b> <b>his</b> duties, and he was replaced by Vice Admiral Reinhard Scheer in January. Scheer proposed a more aggressive policy designed to force a confrontation with the British Grand Fleet; he received approval from the Kaiser in February. Scheer's first operation was a sweep into the North Sea on 5–7 March, followed by two more on 21–22 March and 25–26 March. During Scheer's next operation, Thüringen supported a raid on the English coast on 24 April 1916 conducted by the German battlecruiser force. The battlecruisers left the Jade Estuary at 10:55 and the rest of the High Seas Fleet followed at 13:40. The battlecruiser Seydlitz struck a mine while en route to the target, and had to withdraw. The other battlecruisers bombarded the town of Lowestoft unopposed, but during the approach to Yarmouth, they encountered the British cruisers of the Harwich Force. A short gun duel ensued before the Harwich Force withdrew. Reports of British submarines in the area prompted the retreat of the IScouting Group. At this point, Scheer, who had been warned of the sortie of the Grand Fleet from its base in Scapa Flow, also withdrew to safer German waters.|$|E

Stanley even threatened to skin them alive many times. Some episodes end merely with Stanley chasing Tennessee and Chumley around the Zoo. A few times, they managed to succeed, including an episode in which the pair (along with Baldy) formed a musical group that gained so much popularity that they managed to star in Stanley's music show, while Stanley was reduced <b>to</b> <b>carrying</b> <b>out</b> <b>his</b> threat <b>to</b> eat his hat.|$|R
