They added decorations to the windows and made false arrow slots, added two towers to the south facade, added a flamboyant balustrade and dormer windows, and made changes to part of the chapel.|$|E
5|$|After {{the fall}} of Constantinople in 1453, the codex was brought to Florence by an émigré scholar. It belonged to Niccolo Ridolpho († 1550) Cardinal of Florence.

Catherine brought it to France {{as part of her}} dowry, and from <b>the</b> <b>Bourbon</b> royal library it came to rest in the Bibliothèque nationale de France, Paris.

At several stages, the beans are sorted according to quality. The farmers receive credits based on the amount and quality of the beans they provide.|$|E
5|$|The novel {{takes place}} during <b>the</b> <b>Bourbon</b> Restoration, which brought {{profound}} changes to French society; the struggle by individuals {{to secure a}} higher social status is a major theme in the book. The city of Paris also impresses itself on the characters– especially young Rastignac, {{who grew up in}} the provinces of southern France. Balzac analyzes, through Goriot and others, the nature of family and marriage, providing a pessimistic view of these institutions.|$|E
5|$|Widespread {{rumors of}} Napoleon's return from St. Helena and Napoleon as an {{inspiration}} for patriotism, individual and collective liberties, and political mobilization manifested themselves in seditious materials, displaying the tricolor and rosettes.

5|$|A {{member of}} the {{military}} elite of the First French Empire and a recipient of the Grand Aigle de la Légion d'Honneur, Comte de Nansouty was a {{member of the}} Military Household of the Emperor as First Squire of the Emperor, and also held the position of Colonel-General of Dragoons. During <b>the</b> <b>Bourbon</b> Restoration, Louis XVIII awarded him additional honours and commands, including one in the Military Household of the King of France. Nansouty died in February 1815 and is buried at the Père Lachaise Cemetery in Paris. His name is inscribed on the Arc de Triomphe and a street in the 14th arrondissement of Paris is named after him.|$|E
5|$|Anne was crowned on St George's Day, 23 April 1702. Afflicted with gout, she {{was carried}} to Westminster Abbey {{in an open}} sedan chair, with a low back to permit her train to flow out behind her. On 4 May, England became embroiled in the War of the Spanish Succession, in which England, Austria and the Dutch Republic fought against France and Spain. Charles II of Spain had died childless in 1700, and the {{succession}} was disputed by two claimants: the Habsburg Archduke Charles of Austria and <b>the</b> <b>Bourbon</b> Philip, Duke of Anjou.|$|E
5|$|Charles was {{the second}} son of King James VI of Scotland, but after his father {{inherited}} the English throne in 1603, he moved to England, where {{he spent much of}} the rest of his life. He became heir apparent to the English, Irish, and Scottish thrones on the death of his elder brother, Henry Frederick, Prince of Wales, in 1612. An unsuccessful and unpopular attempt to marry him to the Spanish Habsburg princess Maria Anna culminated in an eight-month visit to Spain in 1623 that demonstrated the futility of the marriage negotiations. Two years later, he married <b>the</b> <b>Bourbon</b> princess Henrietta Maria of France instead.|$|E
25|$|In 1707 the Austrians succeeded the Spanish in the Kingdom of Naples, {{followed}} by <b>the</b> <b>Bourbons.</b> After <b>the</b> proclamation in 1799 of the short-lived Parthenopean Republic and a vain resistance, {{the town was}} finally occupied for <b>the</b> <b>Bourbons</b> by Cardinal Fabrizio Ruffo’s Lazzari; Cardinal Ruffo was native of the province of Cosenza.|$|R

5|$|During the Consulate, Napoleon faced several royalist and Jacobin {{assassination}} plots, {{including the}} Conspiration des poignards (Dagger plot) in October 1800 and the Plot of the Rue Saint-Nicaise (also {{known as the}} Infernal Machine) two months later. In January 1804, his police uncovered an assassination plot against him that involved Moreau and which was ostensibly sponsored by <b>the</b> <b>Bourbon</b> family, the former rulers of France. On the advice of Talleyrand, Napoleon ordered the kidnapping of the Duke of Enghien, violating the sovereignty of Baden. The Duke was quickly executed after a secret military trial, {{even though he had}} not been involved in the plot. Enghien's execution infuriated royal courts throughout Europe, becoming one of the contributing political factors for the outbreak of the Napoleonic Wars.|$|E
5|$|During {{the second}} half of the 18th century, Lima was {{adversely}} affected by <b>the</b> <b>Bourbon</b> Reforms as it lost its monopoly on overseas trade and the important mining region of Upper Peru was transferred to the Viceroyalty of the Río de la Plata. This economic decline made the city's elite dependent on royal and ecclesiastical appointment and thus, reluctant to advocate independence. In the 1810s, the city became a Royalist stronghold during the South American wars of independence led by a strong viceroy, José Fernando de Abascal y Sousa.|$|E

This was the largest taste test among turkey breeds to date, {{and several of the}} heritage breeds were later added to the Slow Food USA Ark of Taste.|$|E

5|$|Louis XVIII ruled as king for {{slightly}} less than a decade. <b>The</b> <b>Bourbon</b> Restoration regime was a constitutional monarchy (unlike the ancien régime, which was absolutist). As a constitutional monarch, Louis XVIII's royal prerogative was reduced substantially by the Charter of 1814, France's new constitution. Louis had no children; therefore, upon his death, the crown passed to his brother, Charles, Count of Artois. Louis XVIII was the last French monarch to die while reigning, as his successor Charles X (1824–1830) abdicated and both Louis Philippe I (1830–1848) and Napoléon III (1852–1870) were deposed.|$|E

On May 15, the Redshirts fought the Battle of Calatafimi and within weeks Palermo was freed. FrancisII of the Two Sicilies tried to regain control of the Kingdom. On June 25, 1860 he restored the constitution of the Kingdom, adopted the Italian tricolour as the national flag, and promised special institutions for the Kingdom.|$|E

In the 17th century, the city prospered as the center of an extensive trade network despite damage from earthquakes and the threat of pirates. However, prosperity came to an end in the 18th century due to an economic downturn and <b>the</b> <b>Bourbon</b> Reforms.|$|E
