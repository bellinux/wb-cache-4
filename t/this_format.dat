5|$|For {{the second}} edition, {{published}} in 1539, Calvin dropped <b>this</b> <b>format</b> {{in favour of}} systematically presenting the main doctrines from the Bible.

The book was a model for his later commentaries: it included his own Latin translation from the Greek rather than the Latin Vulgate, an exegesis, and an exposition. In the dedicatory letter, Calvin praised the work of his predecessors Philipp Melanchthon, Heinrich Bullinger, and Martin Bucer, but he also took care to distinguish his own work from theirs and to criticise some of their shortcomings.|$|E
