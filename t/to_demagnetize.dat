For samples with slightly lower Gd content, a small volume fraction of ⋍ 10 % remains superconducting presumably due <b>to</b> <b>demagnetizing</b> effects.

40|$|The temperature-dependent {{fundamental}} ac susceptibility of a granular superconductor in {{the absence}} of dc fields has been analyzed by developing a phenomenological model for effective magnetic fields, taking into account the influence of the magnetic interaction between the intergranular and the intragranular magnetizations due <b>to</b> <b>demagnetizing</b> effects. For this purpose a policrystal Fe-based superconductor FeSe 0. 5 Te 0. 5 sample has been studied. By the frequency dependence of the peaks of the temperature-dependent imaginary part of the fundamental complex susceptibility, the dependence on temperature of the characteristic times both for intergranular and intragranular relaxations of magnetic flux are derived, and the corresponding relaxation processes due to combinations of the flux creep, the flux flow and the thermally activated flux flow regimes are identified {{on the basis of the}} effective magnetic fields both at the sample surface and at the grains' surfaces. Such characteristic times, through the Havriliak–Negami function, determine the temperature and the frequency dependences of the complex susceptibility. The comparison of the numerically obtained curves with the experimental ones confirms the relevance, for identifying the intergranular and intragranular contributions to the ac magnetic response and the corresponding flux dynamical regimes, of the interaction between the intergranular and intragranular magnetizations due <b>to</b> <b>demagnetizing</b> effects...|$|R
5000|$|Ferromagnetic {{materials}} {{can be divided}} into magnetically [...] "soft" [...] materials like annealed iron, which can be magnetized but do not tend to stay magnetized, and magnetically [...] "hard" [...] materials, which do. Permanent magnets are made from [...] "hard" [...] ferromagnetic materials such as alnico and ferrite that are subjected to special processing in a strong magnetic field during manufacture to align their internal microcrystalline structure, making them very hard <b>to</b> <b>demagnetize.</b> <b>To</b> <b>demagnetize</b> a saturated magnet, a certain magnetic field must be applied, and this threshold depends on coercivity of the respective material.

This design had the advantage {{that it could be}} used <b>to</b> <b>demagnetize</b> other metal parts of the tape path (not just the actual record/playback heads) however it required careful use (to avoid increasing the magnetization of the heads) and if used too close to actual cassette tapes could inadvertently act as a [...] "bulk eraser".|$|E
40|$|Recent {{consideration}} {{of the use of}} permanent magnets in space power converters at heat rejection temperatures exceeding 250 C and in miniature high temperature actuators is supporting a search for permanent magnets resistant <b>to</b> <b>demagnetizing</b> forces at high temperature. The present paper investigates the short-term demagnetization resistance to applied bucking fields and at temperatures up to 300 C of SmCo 5 type magnets, in the form of 1 -cm cubes, from several commercial sources. Quasistatic, 2 nd quadrant M-H data taken at selected temperatures are the source of derived plots which are then compared to similar data for previously tested Sm 2 Co 17 type magnets. The 1 - 5 magnet remanence tends to be about 1. 5 kG below that of the 2 - 17 magnets throughout the temperature range. However, the intrinsic coercivities and M-H curve 'knee-fields' seen in particular 1 - 5 magnets were considerably above those seen previously in the 2 - 17 magnets. This superior resistance <b>to</b> <b>demagnetizing</b> fields attainable in 1 - 5 magnets is also illustrated by safe operating area plots based on the knee-field, the magnetic induction swing and temperature. Comments are made on the possibility that a remanence versus knee-field tradeoff can make 1 - 5 material competitive with 2 - 17 in applications where a magnet has to withstand large bucking fields at high temperature...|$|R

It {{can be shown}} {{that in the case}} that the experiments are performed on cleaved samples, deviations in the observed spinwave frequencies from their theoretical values are partly due <b>to</b> <b>demagnetizing</b> fields. These can be tested by magnetooptic hysteresis measurements. In the case of thin films with decreasing film thickness volume spin waves disappear. At the same time surface waves become more pronounced and show anomalous polarization properties...|$|R
50|$|Magneto-resistive heads {{do not use}} iron so they do {{not build}} up {{residual}} magnetism. They never need <b>to</b> be <b>demagnetized,</b> and if a cassette demagnetizer is used on MR heads, they are easily damaged or destroyed.|$|R
5000|$|A ferrite {{is a type}} {{of ceramic}} {{compound}} composed of iron(III) oxide (Fe2O3) combined chemically with one or more additional metallic elements. [...] They are both electrically nonconductive and ferrimagnetic, meaning they can be magnetized or attracted to a magnet. Ferrites can be divided into two families based on their magnetic coercivity, their resistance to being demagnetized. Hard ferrites have high coercivity, hence they are difficult <b>to</b> <b>demagnetize.</b> They are used to make magnets, for devices such as refrigerator magnets, loudspeakers and small electric motors. Soft ferrites have low coercivity. They are used in the electronics industry to make ferrite cores for inductors and transformers, and in various microwave components. Ferrite compounds have extremely low cost, being made of iron oxide (i.e. rusted iron), and also have excellent corrosion resistance. They are very stable and difficult <b>to</b> <b>demagnetize,</b> and can be made with both high and low coercive forces. Yogoro Kato and Takeshi Takei of the Tokyo Institute of Technology synthesized the first ferrite compounds in 1930.|$|E
50|$|When an {{external}} magnetic field is applied to a ferromagnetic material such as iron, the atomic dipoles align themselves with it. Even when the field is removed, part of the alignment will be retained: the material has become magnetized. Once magnetized, the magnet will stay magnetized indefinitely. <b>To</b> <b>demagnetize</b> it requires heat or a magnetic field in the opposite direction. This is the effect that provides the element of memory in a hard disk drive.|$|E

It is found that for high LSMO content, when the applied magnetic field is perpendicular to the film plane, the attainable low field magnetoresistance (LFMR) response is drastically reduced due <b>to</b> <b>demagnetizing</b> field effects. These effects are suppressed when the concentration of CeO 2 is increased, thus an enhancement of the LFMR is observed. These results can be very important for developing magnetic sensors working in the low magnetic field regime when magnetic field needs to be applied perpendicular to the film plane...|$|R

40|$|Magnetic {{properties}} and domain structure were investigated for die-drawn and subsequently annealed Fe-Si-B amorphous wires. It {{was found that}} the die-drawn wire has bamboo domain {{similar to that of the}} Co based wire with negative magnetostriction and looses the re-entrant flux reversal characteristic. It was also found that the wire recovers the re-entrant characteristic after annealing. The tension-annealed wire has clear shell and core domain structure and exhibits the re entrant characteristic with enhanced remanence. The surface bamboo domain layer as thin as 5 mu m was connected to the core domain by magnetization that changes direction continuously between two domains without domain wall. From the temperature dependence of a threshold field for the discontinuous flux jump, it is inferred that the re entrant characteristic is caused by the depinning of the reverse domain existing near the wire end due <b>to</b> <b>demagnetizing</b> effect...|$|R
50|$|Magnetic {{hysteresis}} {{occurs when}} an {{external magnetic field}} is applied to a ferromagnet such as iron and the atomic dipoles align themselves with it.

50|$|A steel-hulled ship can be degaussed (more correctly, de-oerstedted or depermed) using {{a special}} {{degaussing}} station that contains many large coils and induces {{a magnetic field}} in the hull with alternating current <b>to</b> <b>demagnetize</b> the hull. This is a rather problematic solution, as magnetic compasses need recalibration and all metal objects must be kept {{in exactly the same}} place. Ships slowly regain their magnetic field as they travel through the Earth's magnetic field, so the process has to be repeated every six months.|$|E
5000|$|After {{the part}} has been {{magnetized}} {{it needs to}} be demagnetized. This requires special equipment that works the opposite way of the magnetizing equipment. The magnetization is normally done with a high current pulse that reaches a peak current very quickly and instantaneously turns off leaving the part magnetized. <b>To</b> <b>demagnetize</b> a part, the current or magnetic field needed has to be equal to or greater than the current or magnetic field used to magnetize the part. The current or magnetic field is then slowly reduced to zero, leaving the part demagnetized.|$|E
50|$|The {{mechanism}} is similar <b>to</b> the <b>demagnetizing</b> signal {{which is used}} to erase the tape except that the desired audio signal is retained on the tape during the recording process. The large AC bias acts as a demagnetizing signal which decays exponentially as the tape head moves along, while the audio signal is the residual field that remains imprinted on the magnetic media.|$|R
50|$|For {{ferromagnetic}} material the coercivity is {{the intensity of}} the applied magnetic field required to reduce the magnetization of that material to zero after the magnetization of the sample has been driven to saturation. Thus coercivity measures the resistance of a {{ferromagnetic material}} <b>to</b> becoming <b>demagnetized.</b> Coercivity is usually measured in oersted or ampere/meter units and is denoted HC. It can be measured using a B-H analyzer or magnetometer.|$|R
40|$|It is {{demonstrated}} that the magnetostatic demagnetizing factor {{is not the only}} sample-shape dependent contribution to the hysteresis loop. There are also exchange contributions, which lead to interesting effects, particularly in nanostructures. An example is the recently discovered bulging mode in two-phase nanomagnets. The bulging mode exhibits the angular symmetry of the coherent mode, but it is incoherent due to its radial variation and gives rise <b>to</b> negative <b>demagnetizing</b> factors...|$|R
5000|$|Magnetocrystalline {{anisotropy}} has a {{great influence}} on industrial uses of ferromagnetic materials. Materials with high magnetic anisotropy usually have high coercivity; that is they are hard <b>to</b> <b>demagnetize.</b> These are called [...] "hard" [...] ferromagnetic materials, and are used to make permanent magnets. For example, the high anisotropy of rare earth metals is mainly responsible for the strength of rare earth magnets. During manufacture of magnets, a powerful magnetic field aligns the microcrystalline grains of the metal so their [...] "easy" [...] axes of magnetization all point in the same direction, freezing a strong magnetic field into the material.|$|E
50|$|Halfwave DC demagnetizing (HWDC): {{this process}} is {{identical}} to full-wave DC demagnetization, except the waveform is half-wave. This method of demagnetization is new to the industry and only available from a single manufacturer. It was developed to be a cost-effective method <b>to</b> <b>demagnetize</b> without needing a full-wave DC bridge design power supply. This method is only found on single-phase AC/HWDC power supplies. HWDC demagnetization is just as effective as full-wave DC, without the extra cost and added complexity. Of course, other limitations apply due to inductive losses when using HWDC waveform on large-diameter parts. Also, HWDC effectiveness is limited past 410 mm (16 in) diameter using a 12-volt power supply.|$|E
5000|$|Commercial magnets {{are made}} of [...] "hard" [...] {{ferromagnetic}} or ferrimagnetic materials with very large magnetic anisotropy such as alnico and ferrites, which {{have a very strong}} tendency for the magnetization to be pointed along one axis of the crystal, the [...] "easy axis". During manufacture the materials are subjected to various metallurgical processes in a powerful magnetic field, which aligns the crystal grains so their [...] "easy" [...] axes of magnetization all point in the same direction. Thus the magnetization, and the resulting magnetic field, is [...] "built in" [...] to the crystal structure of the material, making it very difficult <b>to</b> <b>demagnetize.</b>|$|E
40|$|We {{investigated}} the magnetic properties of thin film samples with different number of layers stacked by the LB technique. The film samples showed a magnetically complex behavior in low temperature region, which is insufficiently {{explained by the}} idea of the homogenous dipole interaction field analogous <b>to</b> the <b>demagnetizing</b> field.

40|$|Analytic {{expressions}} for the demagnetizing energies {{are obtained}} {{in the form of}} partial series, for long elliptic cylinders and for squat ones where the ellipticity of the cross-section is unrestrained.

5000|$|During the Second World War, Bitter {{worked for}} the Naval Bureau of Ordnance. He often {{traveled}} to England to work finding out ways <b>to</b> <b>demagnetize</b> British ships {{to protect them from}} a new type of German mine. This new type of German mine used a compass needle to detonate itself. The mine, dropped from the air, would sink {{to the bottom of the}} river and sit there with its magnetic needle aligned to the Earth's magnetic field at that particular spot. When a British ship passed over it, the mass of the ship caused the magnetic needle inside the mine to move slightly. The movement was enough to detonate the mine and cause an underwater explosion powerful enough to send up huge geysers that would literally lift a ship out of the water and severely damage the ship's infrastructure. In his autobiography Magnets, The Education Of A Physicist, he referred to this unique work as [...] "Degaussing the fleet". (It is possible that he worked with Francis Crick, who was researching the same problem.) ...|$|E
50|$|From left {{to right}} in Figure 3, an {{external}} field is first applied in an upward direction in order to saturate the magnet. Then, the external field is reversed and starts <b>to</b> <b>demagnetize</b> the magnet. Since the coercivity of the hard phase is relatively high, the moments remain unchanged so as to minimize the anisotropy and exchange energy. The magnetic moments in the soft phase start rotating to align with the applied field. Because of the exchange coupling at the soft/hard interface, the magnetic moments at the soft phase boundary have to align with the adjacent moment in hard phase. At the regions close to the interface, because of exchange coupling, the chain of magnetic moments acts like a spring. If the external field is increased, more moments in soft phase rotate downward, and {{the width of the}} transition region becomes smaller as the exchange energy density increases. The magnetic moments in the hard phase do not rotate until the external field is high enough that the exchange energy density in the transition region is comparable to the anisotropy energy density in the hard phase. At this point, the rotation of magnetic moments in the soft phase starts to affect the hard phase. As the external field surpasses the hard material's coercivity, the hard magnet gets fully demagnetized.|$|E
5000|$|These motors are {{relatively}} costly, {{and are used}} where exact speed (assuming an exact-frequency AC source) as well as rotation with a very small amount of fast variations in speed (called 'flutter" [...] in audio recordings) is essential. Applications included tape recorder capstan drives (the motor shaft could be the capstan), and, {{before the advent of}} crystal control, motion picture cameras and recorders. Their distinguishing feature is their rotor, which is a smooth cylinder of a magnetic alloy that stays magnetized, but can be demagnetized fairly easily as well as re-magnetized with poles in a new location. Hysteresis refers to how the magnetic flux in the metal lags behind the external magnetizing force; for instance, <b>to</b> <b>demagnetize</b> such a material, one could apply a magnetizing field of opposite polarity to that which originally magnetized the material. These motors have a stator like those of capacitor-run squirrel-cage induction motors. On startup, when slip decreases sufficiently, the rotor becomes magnetized by the stator's field, and the poles stay in place. The motor then runs at synchronous speed as if the rotor were a permanent magnet. When stopped and restarted, the poles are likely to form at different locations. For a given design, torque at synchronous speed is only relatively modest, and the motor can run at below synchronous speed. In simple words, it is lagging magnetic field behind magnetic flux.|$|E
50|$|In a thin soft phase, it is {{hard for}} the {{external}} field to rotate the magnetic moments, similar to a hard magnet with high saturation magnetization. After applying a high external field <b>to</b> partially <b>demagnetize</b> the magnetic moments in the hard phase and after subsequently removing the external field, the rotated moments in the soft phase can be rotated back by exchange coupling with the hard phase (Figure 5). This phenomenon is shown in the hysteresis loop of an exchange spring magnet (Figure 6).|$|R
40|$|We study field-driven {{magnetic}} domain wall dynamics in garnet strips by large-scale three-dimensional micromagnetic simulations. The domain wall propagation velocity {{as a function}} of the applied field exhibits a low-field linear part terminated by a sudden velocity drop at a threshold field magnitude, related to the onset of excitations of internal degrees of freedom of the domain wall magnetization. By considering a wide range of strip thicknesses from 30 nm to 1. 89 μm, we find a non-monotonic thickness dependence of the threshold field for the onset of this instability, proceeding via nucleation and propagation of Bloch lines within the domain wall. We identify a critical strip thickness above which the velocity drop is due to nucleation of horizontal Bloch lines, while for thinner strips and depending on the boundary conditions employed, either generation of vertical Bloch lines, or close-to-uniform precession of the domain wall internal magnetization takes place. For strips of intermediate thicknesses, the vertical Bloch lines assume a deformed structure due <b>to</b> <b>demagnetizing</b> fields at the strip surfaces, breaking the symmetry between the top and bottom faces of the strip, and resulting in circulating Bloch line dynamics along the perimeter of the domain wall.
