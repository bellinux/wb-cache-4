5|$|Gordon Strachan made an unpromising {{start as}} manager of Celtic {{in the summer of}} 2005, losing his first match in charge – a Champions League {{qualifier}} – 0–5 to Slovakian side Artmedia Bratislava, the club's worst ever European result at that time. Celtic did produce a fight-back in the second leg at Parkhead, but their 4–0 win on <b>the</b> <b>night</b> <b>was</b> not enough to salvage the tie.|$|E
5|$|In the United Kingdom, {{the game}} was shown live on ITV's The Match, which aired a live Division One game most {{weeks of the season}} from 1988 to 1992. Elton Welsby {{presented}} coverage and his guest was the England coach Bobby Robson. The match commentator on <b>the</b> <b>night</b> <b>was</b> Brian Moore, alongside former Tottenham Hotspur manager David Pleat. On radio, the action was summarised by Peter Jones on BBC Radio 2.|$|E
5|$|The final dark {{match of}} <b>the</b> <b>night</b> <b>was</b> a {{qualifier}} for the King of the Ring tournament between Davey Boy Smith and Owen Hart (managed by Jim Cornette). The match {{went to a}} fifteen-minute time-limit draw. Unlike the other dark matches, this was taped for the June 5 episode of Raw.|$|E

5|$|The {{second to}} last match of <b>the</b> <b>night</b> <b>was</b> between Jake Roberts and Hercules. When Roberts {{attempted}} to slam his opponent's head {{on to the}} mat with a DDT, Hercules was able to escape the maneuver and {{take control of the}} match. As Hercules attempted to slam Roberts to the mat, Roberts reversed the move into a DDT, enabling him to pin Hercules for the win.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the third}} match, Larry Zybysko {{revealed}} that Raven's opponent for <b>the</b> <b>night</b> <b>was</b> Sean Waltman. The two then fought in a No Disqualification match with the stipulation that if Raven won he gained a future NWA World Heavyweight Championship match, {{but if he}} lost he would be fired from TNA. During the bout, the referee was knocked out with Zbyszko taking over his duties. Waltman won the contest after forcing Raven face-first off of a ladder through a table with his signature X-Factor maneuver. Zbyszko counted the pin despite Raven's foot on the bottom rope at 10 minutes. As {{a result of his}} loss, Raven was fired from TNA in the storyline.|$|E
5|$|The Francophone University Agency and Madagascar's National Center for Scientific Research collaborated {{to publish}} the {{entirety}} of Rabearivelo's works in three volumes. The first volume, comprising his journal {{and some of his}} correspondence with key figures in literary and colonial circles, was printed in October 2010. The second volume, a compilation of all his previously published works, was released in July 2012. The remaining 1,000 pages of materials produced by Rabearivelo have been published in digital format.

5|$|The {{first episode}} of Neighbours saw Daphne hired to strip at Des Clarke's (Paul Keane) bucks party. When <b>the</b> <b>night</b> <b>was</b> {{interrupted}} by a neighbour, Daphne left some belongings behind and returned the following morning to collect them. Des's fiancée assumed she {{had spent the night}} and called the wedding off. Realising that Des needed a lodger to help him pay the mortgage off, Daphne moved in. Des was instantly attracted to Daphne, but he tried to hide his feelings and became awkward around her. Josephine Monroe, author of Neighbours: The First 10 Years, wrote that the local men queued up to date Daphne, but it was Shane Ramsay (Peter O'Brien) who first caught her eye and they soon began a relationship.|$|E
5|$|The first {{main event}} match of <b>the</b> <b>night</b> <b>was</b> between the World Heavyweight Champion Jack Swagger and his challenger, Big Show. Big Show {{dominated}} the match, with Swagger getting very little offense. As a result, Swagger got frustrated and hit Big Show with the World Heavyweight Championship title belt, and was disqualified. After the match, Swagger attacked Big Show with a steel chair, but Big Show {{was able to}} stop him with a chokeslam. Big Show then performed his knockout punch on Swagger, before leaving the area.|$|E
5|$|The next {{match of}} <b>the</b> <b>night</b> <b>was</b> an {{intergender}} tag team match, with Kevin Thorn and Ariel against Mike Knox and Kelly Kelly. Before the match began, Kelly Kelly was shown wishing CM Punk, her on-screen crush, luck {{for the main}} event. The end of the match came when Knox abandoned Kelly Kelly in the ring and Ariel performed a legsweep, a variation of a takedown, on Kelly Kelly before covering her for the win. Following the match, Ariel and Thorn attempted to attack Kelly Kelly, before The Sandman interrupted and hit Thorn repeatedly with a kendo stick.|$|E

5|$|The return match saw Celta Vigo's Jesuli {{level the}} tie on {{aggregate}} after 24 minutes. Celtic rallied, and on 37 minutes John Hartson used his body strength to force {{his way into}} the Spanish penalty box and score with a powerful shot. Crucially, due to the away goals rule, Celta Viga now had to score twice to avoid losing the tie. Benni McCarthy scored early in the second half for Celta Vigo but, despite a glaring miss from Jesuli near the end, Celtic held on to win the tie on away goals. The 1–2 loss on <b>the</b> <b>night</b> <b>was</b> the first of two defeats for Celtic {{on the way to the}} final.|$|E
5|$|While G Company {{held its}} {{positions}} on Hill 179 on September 2 against North Korean attack, 2nd Battalion, 27th Infantry started an attack northwest toward it at 17:00 from the Chung-ni area. The battalion made slow progress against formidable North Korean forces. <b>The</b> <b>night</b> <b>was</b> extremely {{dark and the}} terrain along the Kuhe-ri ferry road was mountainous. After fighting throughout the night, the battalion reached a position south of the original defensive positions of G Company, 35th Infantry {{the next day at}} 15:00. A coordinated attack by US armor, artillery, air, and infantry got under way and by 18:00 the battalion had re-established the battle line. In this attack the 2nd Battalion, 27th Infantry, killed 275 North Koreans and recovered {{a large part of the}} equipment G Company had lost earlier.|$|E
5|$|Although accurate, shadow clocks {{relied on}} the sun, and so were useless at night and in cloudy weather. The Egyptians {{therefore}} developed a number of alternative timekeeping instruments, including water clocks, and a system for tracking star movements. The oldest description of a water clock is from the tomb inscription of the 16th-century Egyptian court official Amenemhet, identifying him as its inventor. There were several types of water clocks, some more elaborate than others. One type consisted of a bowl with small holes in its bottom, which was floated on water and allowed to fill at a near-constant rate; markings {{on the side of}} the bowl indicated elapsed time, as the surface of the water reached them. The oldest-known waterclock was found in the tomb of pharaoh Amenhotep I (1525–1504), suggesting that they were first used in ancient Egypt. Another Egyptian method of determining the time during <b>the</b> <b>night</b> <b>was</b> using plumb-lines called merkhets. In use since at least 600, two of these instruments were aligned with Polaris, the north pole star, to create a north–south meridian. The time was accurately measured by observing certain stars as they crossed the line created with the merkhets.|$|E

5|$|In the meantime, Verdugo {{aimed to}} block Niezijl's dike with Frate's and Bievres' companies, but as these troops lagged behind, {{he found himself}} alone on the dike when Norreys and his {{officers}} attempted to retreat back to their camp. Alone, Verdugo fought desperately against them. Twice the Spanish commander was taken prisoner, but in the end, as he killed or wounded many of his foes, Norreys preferred {{to let him go}} free rather than risk allowing the pursuing Spanish troops to capture himself or his remaining men. Once he had recovered, Verdugo massed some cavalry and completed the Anglo-Dutch defeat by destroying an English troop which, trying to save the flags, fled across a field towards the Niezijl canal. Most of the English flags and all of their artillery were lost. As <b>the</b> <b>night</b> <b>was</b> falling, Verdugo collected his troops and returned to Noordhorn, where they formed into squadron formation and, kneeling down, prayed to thank God for their victory.|$|E
5|$|One of Igarashi's {{prominent}} concerns during {{development was}} addressing the criticism expressed concerning Harmony of Dissonance. Igarashi {{noted that the}} music in Harmony of Dissonance had not been well received and Michiru Yamane, who had previously worked on the acclaimed music for Symphony of <b>the</b> <b>Night,</b> <b>was</b> hired in order to compose for Aria of Sorrow. The development team worked on the game's audio cycles, as well as delegating more cartridge space and processor cycles for the sound. Maintaining the visual quality of Harmony of Dissonance was a chief objective during development, as many reviewers had felt that Harmony of Dissonance had excelled in graphics {{at the cost of}} the audio. Furthermore, the staff tried to improve the series' gameplay system while retaining fan-favorite elements. Certain aspects that were missing in Harmony of Dissonance, such as hidden rooms, were incorporated into Aria of Sorrow. Igarashi added Soul trading via a link cable to assist players with collecting every soul in the game, which he believed would be cumbersome to accomplish alone.|$|E
5|$|The last {{match of}} <b>the</b> <b>night</b> <b>was</b> {{the main event}} between The Mega Powers (Hulk Hogan and Randy Savage), {{accompanied}} by Miss Elizabeth, and The Mega Bucks (Ted DiBiase and André the Giant), accompanied by André's manager Bobby Heenan and DiBiase's bodyguard Virgil. Jesse Ventura was the special guest referee. The Mega Powers took the early advantage over DiBiase. After Hogan attacked André the Giant, {{who was on the}} ring apron, The Mega Bucks were able to regain control. After a while, all four men began brawling, and André knocked The Mega Powers out of the ring. Subsequently, as part of the scripted ending to the match, Miss Elizabeth began arguing with Ventura, the referee, and ripped off her skirt to reveal her underwear. While the Mega Bucks were distracted, Savage climbed to the top rope and dropped the Macho Elbow on DiBiase, followed by Hogan hitting the leg drop on DiBiase. As Hogan pinned DiBiase, Ventura, a villainous character aligned with The Mega Bucks (despite being a long time on-air Savage fan and his former tag-team partner), began an obviously slow three-count. As a result, Savage slammed Ventura's arm down for the third time, indicating that Hogan and Savage had won the match.|$|E

5|$|The leading {{infantry}} brigade of 52nd (Lowland) Division, {{which had}} reached Beit Likia on 19 November by moving along a track {{north of the}} main road, was held up towards Kuryet el Enab by a very determined and formidable Ottoman rearguard armed with machine guns at Kustal and Beit Dukka. The Ottoman positions were strongly defended and the 52nd (Lowland) Division could not advance until a mist, rolled down just before dark on 21 November, giving the 75th Division the opportunity to rapidly deploy, climb the ridge, and defeat the Ottoman force with bayonets. That night, the troops ate their iron rations (carried by the men as emergency rations), and some found shelter from the miserable conditions in a large monastery and sanatorium. <b>The</b> <b>night</b> <b>was</b> cold with heavy rain, and those without shelter suffered severely. No supplies arrived till noon the following day owing to congestion on the narrow tracks.|$|E
5|$|The seventh {{match of}} <b>the</b> <b>night</b> <b>was</b> for the WWF Tag Team Championship. Reigning champions Demolition (Ax and Smash), {{accompanied}} by both Mr. Fuji and Jimmy Hart, were challenged by The Hart Foundation (Bret Hart and Jim Neidhart). As {{soon as the}} bell sounded, The Hart Foundation attacked both members of Demolition. Their control was brief, as Demolition then gained the advantage over Neidhart. As Bret Hart was tagged into the match, Demolition got the advantage over {{him when he was}} whipped shoulder first into the turnbuckle, breaking Mr. Fuji's cane that he had placed there when the referee wasn't looking. After a few minutes of Demolition working over Hart's shoulder, a frustrated Neidhart chased Jimmy Hart from ringside and returned to tag back into the match. When all four men began fighting inside the ring, Neidhart attacked Mr. Fuji, who was on the ring apron. At the end of the match, Bret Hart attempted a piledriver but Ax hit him a megaphone given by Jimmy Hart sneaking back to the ring. Smash then pinned Bret Hart for the win.|$|E
