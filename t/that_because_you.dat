5|$|My {{philosophy}} {{about race}} relations is that I'm {{the man and}} I'll set my own patterns in life. I don't rely on anyone else's opinions. I look at a man as a human being; I don't care about his color. Some people feel <b>that</b> <b>because</b> <b>you</b> are black {{you will never be}} treated fairly, and that you should voice your opinions, be militant about them. I don't feel this way. You can't convince a fool against his will...If a man doesn't like me because I'm black, that's fine. I'll just go elsewhere, but I'm not going to let him change my life.|$|E
500|$|Despite {{the show}} not yet being officially renewed {{for a fourth}} season, Fringe began casting in mid-March for a [...] "green FBI agent... to come aboard for the finale and {{possibly}} recur next year", as reported by E! Online. TVLine's Michael Ausiello announced later in the month that actress Emily Meade has been cast for the role, describing her character as [...] "a wide-eyed and eager rookie who’s ready to face all of the challenges in front of her", {{and that she would}} make her first appearance in the finale. In {{the months leading up to}} the finale, Wyman responded to reports the character would be recurring by calling her casting more of a [...] "safety net"; much like Seth Gabel's casting, he did not want to commit himself to her character yet, saying, [...] "We always protect ourselves by saying <b>that</b> <b>because</b> <b>you</b> never know". The actress was later revealed to be playing a grown up version of Olivia's niece, Ella.|$|E
2500|$|Although {{many believe}} it was created because of the Silver Jubilee, the band denies it, Paul Cook saying that [...] "It wasn't written {{specifically}} for the Queen's Jubilee. We weren't aware {{of it at the}} time. It wasn't a contrived effort to go out and shock everyone." [...] Johnny Rotten has explained the lyrics as follows: [...] "You don't write 'God Save The Queen' because you hate the English race. You write a song like <b>that</b> <b>because</b> <b>you</b> love them, and you're fed up with them being mistreated." [...] He intended to evoke sympathy for the English working class, and a general resentment towards the monarchy.|$|E

2500|$|On July 8, 2007, Ellison {{discussed}} {{the power of}} the executive branch in a speech before the organization Atheists for Human Rights. He stated that Dick Cheney said it was [...] "beneath his dignity in order for him to answer any questions from the citizens of the United States. That is the very definition of totalitarianism, authoritarianism and dictatorship." [...] He went on to say, [...] "It's almost like the Reichstag fire, kind of reminds me of that. After the Reichstag was burned, they blamed the Communists for it and it put the leader of that country, Hitler, in a position where he could basically have authority to do whatever he wanted. The fact is that I'm not saying September 11 was a U.S. plan or anything like <b>that</b> <b>because,</b> <b>you</b> know, that's how they put you in the nut-ball box — dismiss you." ...|$|E
2500|$|In September 2007, while {{speaking}} about issuing a draft, McCain said, [...] "One, it's the best military we've ever had, it just isn't big enough. Two, there's {{never been a}} draft that I've ever heard of since World War II that was fair. What we've done is we find rich people find a way out, and lower income people {{are the ones that}} serve. I might consider it, I don't think it's necessary, but I might consider it if you could design a draft where everybody equally would serve. But it just doesn't happen. And the other thing is <b>that,</b> <b>because</b> <b>you</b> know from here in Brauman, it takes intensive training with the equipment and the technical skills that now our people are required to engage in, that it makes it not conducive to a short term. Now they enlist for 4 years. We used to draft people almost for 2 years or even 18 months so it's much more difficult." ...|$|E
2500|$|..... {{everybody}} {{hated him}} because he was very dry, and I thought he was wonderful because he was very dry. And Barrow made me realize that all my romantic views of art were nonsense. I had always thought an angel came down and sat on your shoulder and whispered in your ear 'dah-dah-dah-DUM.' Never occurred to me that art was something worked out. And suddenly it was skies opening up. As soon as you find out what a leading tone is, you think, Oh my God. What a diatonic scale is – Oh my God! The logic of it. And, of course, what that meant to me was: Well, I can do <b>that.</b> <b>Because</b> <b>you</b> just don't know. You think it's a talent, you think you're born with this thing. What I've found out and what I believed is that everybody is talented. It's just that some people get it developed and some don't.|$|E

2500|$|The Daughters of Bilitis {{were used}} as {{political}} fodder in the 1959 mayoral race in San Francisco. Russell Wolden, challenging incumbent George Christopher, distributed information implying that Christopher was making the city safe for [...] "sex deviants". Wolden was responsible for materials that stated, [...] "You parents of daughters — do not sit back complacently feeling <b>that</b> <b>because</b> <b>you</b> have no boys in your family everything is all right...To enlighten you as {{to the existence of}} a Lesbian organization composed of homosexual women, make yourself acquainted with the name Daughters of Bilitis." [...] There were only two copies of the subscription list of The Ladder, a deliberate attempt to discourage its getting into the hands of anyone who might use it against the subscribers. DOB leaders moved the list from its headquarters and later found out that San Francisco police had searched the office after its removal. Even the FBI was curious enough to attend meetings to report in 1959, [...] "The purpose of the DOB is to educate the public to accept the Lesbian homosexual into society." ...|$|E
2500|$|Lee Norris portrays Marvin [...] "Mouth" [...] McFadden, one of Lucas's oldest friends (they {{were both}} {{members of a}} group of {{children}} who played together at the Rivercourt, an outdoor basketball court in Tree Hill). Schwahn spoke of seeing himself in Mouth. Norris said that, during the spring break in his junior year at school, when the pilot for One Tree Hill came up, he drove alone to the casting director and Mark Schwahn. [...] " [...] was easy for me to play because I was this big college basketball fan, and I even wore my college team t-shirt to the audition," [...] said Norris, adding that [...] "at the end of the day, I think Mouth always remains a good guy in his heart and it's absolutely good to play <b>that,</b> <b>because</b> <b>you</b> feel good when you have a character like that on TV. Even if he doesn't always do the right thing, you know it's coming from a good place." [...] Mouth is unlucky in love.|$|E
2500|$|In 2013, Clarkson {{released}} her first Christmas album, Wrapped in Red, which to her represented a beginning {{for a second}} phase for her career. In the midst of recording it, she also collaborated with recording artists Robbie Williams, Martina McBride and Trisha Yearwood in their respective albums Swings Both Ways (2013), Everlasting (2014) and [...] (2014). In an interview with Billboard magazine, she announced intentions to release a set of pop and country records, {{as well as a}} potential Broadway album, as a follow-up to Wrapped in Red. RCA Records chief executive Peter Edge also revealed in their 2014 mid-year assessment that they were in a process of finding new music and directions for some of their established acts — primarily with Clarkson. Early stages of development for a follow-up studio album began as early as June 2012, with Clarkson commissioning Rodney Jerkins in recording a potential track. She remarked: [...] "We're already working. I'm constantly like <b>that</b> <b>because</b> <b>you</b> never know when you're going to find a song and so we're always working on the next thing." [...] The follow-up album would complete the terms of her recording contract with RCA Records and 19 Recordings, which was signed following her win on the first season of the television competition American Idol in 2002.|$|E
