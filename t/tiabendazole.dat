50|$|Genes {{responsible}} {{for the maintenance of}} cell walls in yeast {{have been shown to be}} {{responsible for}} angiogenesis in vertebrates. <b>Tiabendazole</b> serves to block angiogenesis in both frog embryos and human cells. It has also been shown to serve as a vascular disrupting agent to reduce newly established blood vessels. <b>Tiabendazole</b> has been shown to effectively do this in certain cancer cells.|$|E
50|$|Additionally, <b>tiabendazole</b> {{was noted}} to exhibit {{moderate}} anti-inflammatory and analgesic activities, {{which led to}} the development of KB-1043.|$|E

50|$|Visceral toxocariasis {{in humans}} {{can be treated}} with {{antiparasitic}} drugs such as albendazole or mebendazole, <b>tiabendazole</b> or diethylcarbamazine usually in combination with anti-inflammatory medications. Steroids have been utilized with some positive results. Anti-helminthic therapy is reserved for severe infections (lungs, brain) because therapy may induce, due to massive larval killing, a strong inflammatory response. Treatment of ocular toxocariasis is more difficult and usually consists of measures to prevent progressive damage to the eye.|$|E
40|$|Background: Infection with Strongyloides stercoralis, an {{intestinal}} nematode {{of humans}} and some animals, is rare in dry climates such as Yazd. This article presents a patient with this infection who was mistakenly under treatment for ulcerative colitis, which recovered after proper diagnosis and anti-helminthic therapy. Case presentation: A 32 years-old man from Qeshm referred to Yazd Central Laboratory in August 2005, when many rhabditiform larvae of S. stercoralis were found in stool exam. Until then, he was under treatment with sulfasalazine and other drugs for ulcerative colitis. Treatment with <b>tiabendazole</b> was completely effective at relieving intestinal symptoms, without recurrence in 15 months of follow-up. All lab reports and documents are available. Conclusion: Careful attention is necessary because delayed diagnosis of S. stercoralis may lead to severe and fatal strongyloidiasis, and this parasite can manifest itself with symptoms similar to other intestinal diseases, such as ulcerative colitis...|$|E
40|$|Hookworm-related {{cutaneous}} {{larva migrans}} {{is caused by}} the migration of animal hookworm larvae in the human skin. The disease mainly occurs in resource-poor communities in the developing world, but it is also reported sporadically in high-income countries and in tourists who have visited the tropics. Diagnosis is made clinically {{in the presence of a}} linear serpiginous track moving forward in the skin, associated with itching and a history of exposure. Itching is typically very intense and can prevent patients from sleeping. Bacterial superinfection occurs as a result of scratching. Treatment is based on oral drugs (albendazole or ivermectin) or the topical application of <b>tiabendazole.</b> To control hookworm-related cutaneous larva migrans at the community level, regular treatment of dogs and cats with anthelmintic drugs is necessary, but this is seldom feasible in resource-poor settings. Animals should be banned from beaches and playgrounds. For protection at the individual level, unprotected skin should not come into contact with possibly contaminated soil...|$|E
40|$|O trabalho avaliou a interação entre temperaturas do solo (13 ºC, 15 ºC, 17 ºC e 19 ºC), profundidades de semeadura (2, 5; 5, 0 e 7, 5 cm) e tratamento de semente com fungicida (captan + <b>tiabendazole)</b> na emergência de plantas de milho. Utilizaram-se sementes do híbrido AS 1565 com 22 % de incidência de Fusarium verticillioides e solo de lavoura naturalmente infestado. O ensaio foi conduzido em câmaras climatizadas por 25 dias, com contagem diária da emergência. Houve diferença significativa entre sementes tratadas e não tratadas, sendo que quanto menor a temperatura do solo e maior a profundidade de semeadura, maior a resposta ao tratamento de sementes na emergência de plantas. A estabilidade de emergência ocorreu aos 23, 18, 12 e 12 dias após a semeadura respectivamente para 13 ºC, 15 ºC, 17 ºC e 19 ºC, mostrando redução na velocidade de emergência nas temperaturas baixas. In {{this study}} the {{interaction}} between soil temperatures (13 ºC, 15 ºC, 17 ºC and 19 ºC), depths of sowing (2. 5, 5. 0 and 7. 5 cm) and seed treatment with fungicide (captan + thiabendazol) {{in the emergence of}} plants maize was evaluate. Seed of hybrid corn AS 1565 with 22 % of the incidence of Fusarium verticillioides was used and soil naturally infested. The trays were kept in conditioned chambers for 25 days, measured daily the emergence. There was significance difference between treated and untreated seeds. According to lower soil temperature and higher the depth of seedling, was largest the response of the seed treatment in the plants emergence. The emergence of plants was measured daily to obtain the stability, which occurred at 23, 18, 12 and 12 days after seedling at temperatures of 13 ºC, 15 ºC, 17 ºC and 19 ºC respectively, showing reduction in the emergence speed at low temperatures...|$|E
40|$|Cut {{flowers of}} spray {{chrysanthemum}} (Dendranthema grandiflorum (Ramat.) S. Kitamura) cv. White Polaris were harvested and treated in pulsing solutions. The flowers were harvested in commercial greenhouses and {{transported to the}} laboratory where the whole stem and inflorescence were immersed in tap water at darkness, during 3 hours. The flowers were selected for uniformity in terms of development; the stems were trimmed to equal length (50 to 60 cm) and tagged to allow recording morphological changes associated with individual flowers. The flowers were held during 24 hours (pulsing treatment period) at 25 ± 2 °C and 60 to 90 % of air relative humidity under continuous cool white fluorescent light at 1. 5 KLx. At {{the end of the}} treatment, the flowers were transferred to distilled water, under daily 10 hours of continuous fluorescent light and at the same laboratory conditions already described. At the first experiment, it was tested the efficiency of 8 -hydroxyquinoline (8 -HQ) and thiabendazole (TBZ), as germicides, in three concentrations each one. Furthermore, two growth regulators were applied {{in order to keep the}} green color and the turgidity of leaves: gibberellic acid (GA 3), 6 -benzylaminopurine (6 -BA) and a mix of them. At the second experiment, in order to extend the vase-life by inhibition of ethylene production, it was tested the effect of silver nitrate (AgNO 3), anionic silver thiosulphate complex (STS) and cobalt chloride (CoCl 2) into pulsing solutions in three concentrations each one. The results of experiments showed that pulsing treatment with distilled water + 0. 52 mol/m³ citric acid + 58. 43 mol/m³ sucrose + 0. 69 mol/m³ 8 -HQ + 2. 9 or 4. 4 mol/m³ AgNO 3, combined with foliar treatment of 0. 058 mol/m³ GA 3, improved the foliar quality and extended the flower vase life. 0 objetivo do trabalho foi determinar o melhor tratamento pós-colheita para manutenção floral e aumento da longevidade de crisântemo de maço do tipo pompom (Dendranthema grandiflorum (Ramat.) S. Kitamura) cv. White Polaris. Estabeleceu-se como ponto de colheita o momento em que as hastes apresentavam três inflorescências apicais com as pétalas externas em ângulo de 45 ° em relação à horizontal. Durante o ensaio em laboratório, as hastes, colhidas em estufa de produção comercial, após totalmente imersas em água de torneira, à sombra, durante três horas, foram cortadas sob água na base do caule entre 50 e 60 cm. As hastes foram distribuídas nos diferentes tratamentos de pulsing durante 24 horas, com luz contínua de 1. 500 lux, 60 a 90 % de umidade relativa do ar e temperatura ambiente de 25 ± 2 °C. No primeiro experimento, testou-se a eficiência de 8 -hidroxiquinolina (8 -HQ) e <b>tiabendazole</b> (TBZ) como germicidas de manutenção da qualidade na solução de pulsing; testaram-se, também, dois reguladores de crescimento, a saber: ácido giberélico (GA 3), 6 -benzilaminopurina (6 -BA) ou a mistura dos dois, com o objetivo de preservar a cor e a turgidez da folhagem. Os melhores resultados foram com 8 -HQ (0, 69 mol/m³) e GA 3 (0, 058 mo 1 /m³). No segundo experimento, avaliaram-se os seguintes inibidores de etileno: tiossulfato de prata (STS), nitrato de prata (AgNO 3) e cloreto de cobalto (COC 1 (2)). A melhor resposta foi obtida com AgNO 3 (2, 9 e 4, 4 mo 1 /m³) ...|$|E
40|$|Transcriptomics was {{performed}} to gain insight into mechanisms of food additives butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT), curcumin (CC), propyl gallate (PG), and thiabendazole (TB), additives for which interactions in the liver can not be excluded. Additives were administered in diets for 28 days to Sprague-Dawley rats and cDNA microarray experiments were performed on hepatic RNA. BHT induced changes in the expression of 10 genes, including phase I (CYP 2 B 1 / 2; CYP 3 A 9; CYP 2 C 6) and phase II metabolism (GST μ 2). The CYP 2 B 1 / 2 and GST expression findings were confirmed by real time RT-PCR, western blotting, and increased GST activity towards DCNB. CC altered the expression of 12 genes. Three out of these were related to peroxisomes (phytanoyl-CoA dioxygenase, enoyl-CoA hydratase; CYP 4 A 3). Increased cyanide insensitive palmitoyl-CoA oxidation was observed, suggesting that CC is a weak peroxisome proliferator. TB changed the expression of 12 genes, including CYP 1 A 2. In line, CYP 1 A 2 protein expression was increased. The expression level of five genes, associated with p 53 was found to change upon TB treatment, including p 53 itself, GADD 45 α, DN- 7, protein kinase C β and serum albumin. These array experiments led to the novel finding that TB is capable of inducing p 53 at the protein level, {{at least at the}} highest dose levels employed above the current NOAEL. The expression of eight genes changed upon PG administration. This study shows the value of gene expression profiling in food toxicology in terms of generating novel hypotheses on the mechanisms of action of food additives in relation to pathology. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd.
