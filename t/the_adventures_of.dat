5|$|Although The Castafiore Emerald {{received}} {{critical acclaim}} for making its characters follow a lead of false trails, {{it was not}} a commercial success due to the experimental nature of its narrative. It was published as a book by Casterman shortly after its conclusion. Hergé continued <b>The</b> <b>Adventures</b> <b>of</b> Tintin with Flight 714 to Sydney, while the series itself became a defining part of the Franco-Belgian comics tradition.

5|$|At {{the request}} of Hergé's British publisher, Methuen, in 1971 he made a range of {{alterations}} to the Land of Black Gold, transferring the setting from the British Mandate for Palestine to the fictional state of Khemed. Many of the visual changes to this third version of the volume were carried out by Hergé's assistant, Bob de Moor. Hergé followed Land of Black Gold with Destination Moon, while <b>The</b> <b>Adventures</b> <b>of</b> Tintin itself became a defining part of the Franco-Belgian comics tradition. Critical approaches to the story have been mixed, with differing opinions expressed as to the competing merits of the volume's three versions. The story was adapted for the 1991 animated series <b>The</b> <b>Adventures</b> <b>of</b> Tintin by Ellipse and Nelvana.|$|E

5|$|By {{the late}} 1940s, {{after the end}} of the Second World War, Hergé was {{continuing}} to produce new instalments of <b>The</b> <b>Adventures</b> <b>of</b> Tintin for the Belgian magazine Tintin, of which he was the artistic director. After completing serialisation of Prisoners of the Sun in April 1949, he ordered his staff to re-serialise one of his old stories, Popol and Virginia, while he took a three-month break. At this point, Hergé was depressed and suffering from a range of physical ailments, including boils and eczema on his hands. Although fed up with <b>The</b> <b>Adventures</b> <b>of</b> Tintin, he felt great pressure on him to continue producing the series for Tintin magazine.|$|E

5|$|Developed in part {{through the}} {{suggestions}} of Hergé's friends Bernard Heuvelmans and Jacques Van Melkebeke, Explorers on the Moon was produced following Hergé's extensive research into the possibility of human space travel– a feat that {{had yet to be}} achieved– with the cartoonist seeking for the work to be as realistic as possible. Hergé continued <b>The</b> <b>Adventures</b> <b>of</b> Tintin with The Calculus Affair, while the series itself became a defining part of the Franco-Belgian comics tradition. Critics have praised the illustrative detail of the book, but have expressed mixed views of the story. The volume was adapted for both the 1957 Belvision animated series, Hergé's Adventures of Tintin, and for the 1991 animated series <b>The</b> <b>Adventures</b> <b>of</b> Tintin by Ellipse and Nelvana.|$|E

5|$|Following the {{publication}} of Tintin in the Congo, Hergé conducted research for a story set in the United States, desiring to reflect his concerns regarding the treatment of Native communities by the U.S. government. Bolstered by a publicity stunt, Tintin in America was a commercial success in Belgium and was soon republished in France. Hergé continued <b>The</b> <b>Adventures</b> <b>of</b> Tintin with Cigars of the Pharaoh, and the series became a defining part of the Franco-Belgian comics tradition. In 1945, Tintin in America was re-drawn and coloured in Hergé's ligne-claire style for republication by Casterman, with further alterations made {{at the request of}} his American publisher for a 1973 edition. The story was adapted for a 1991 episode of the Ellipse/Nelvana animated series <b>The</b> <b>Adventures</b> <b>of</b> Tintin. Critical reception of the work has been mixed, with commentators on <b>The</b> <b>Adventures</b> <b>of</b> Tintin arguing that although it represents an improvement on the preceding two instalments, it still reflects many of the problems that were visible in them.|$|E
