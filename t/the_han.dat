5|$|In 135 BC, Tang Meng led the {{earliest}} Han expedition against Dian, establishing the Jianwei commandery in southwestern China. The Dian tribes {{were involved in}} the trade of livestock, horses, fruit, and slaves, and was attractive to <b>the</b> <b>Han</b> because of their resources and metalworking expertise.

5|$|The Southward {{expansion}} of <b>the</b> <b>Han</b> dynasty were {{a series of}} Chinese military campaigns and expeditions {{in what is now}} modern Southern China and Northern Vietnam.

5|$|As Han troops {{returned}} from the Han–Nanyue War in 111 BC, <b>the</b> <b>Han</b> government debated annexing Dongyue. Dongyue, under King Zou Yushan, had agreed to assist <b>the</b> <b>Han</b> campaign against Nanyue, but the Dongyue army never reached Nanyue. Yushan blamed the delay on the weather. The proposal to annex Dongyue was suggested by General Yang Pu, but was dismissed by Emperor Wu. The naval force arrived home without having attacked Dongyue. Zou caught wind of Yang's request, and responded by revolting against <b>the</b> <b>Han.</b> Han forces were led by General Han Yue, General Yang Pu, commander Wang Wenshu, and two marquises of Yue ancestry. The army crushed the rebellion and captured Dongyue in {{the last months of}} 111 BC, placing the former Minyue territory under Han rule.|$|E

5|$|At the {{beginning}} of <b>the</b> <b>Han</b> dynasty, the Liu family associated its dynasty with the water phase as the previous Qin dynasty had done.

5|$|Dian was conquered {{during a}} {{military}} campaign launched by Han Wudi in 109 BCE, and the Yizhou commandery {{was established in}} the former kingdom. Archaeologists discovered the king of Dian's imperial seal inscribed by <b>the</b> <b>Han,</b> confirming Dian's surrender and status as a subject of <b>the</b> <b>Han.</b> The Dian led a series of unsuccessful rebellions against Han rule, beginning with two revolts in 86 BCE and 83 BCE. Chen Li, governor of the Zangge commandery, crushed a rebellion in 28–35 BCE. Under Wang Mang's reign as usurper of <b>the</b> <b>Han</b> throne between 9-23 CE, hostilities in southwestern China persisted. Wang sent military campaigns to quell the unrest. Seventy percent of the soldiers in one campaign died from illness. Another campaign, comprising 100,000 men and with double the supplies, was not fruitful. Rebellions continued in 42-45 and 176.|$|E

5|$|From one {{settlement}} in year 1, <b>the</b> <b>Han</b> Dynasty's {{involvement in the}} Minyue region grew into several counties. There were many Chinese counties in the area by the 4th century AD. The Minyue had been culturally assimilated by the time <b>the</b> <b>Han</b> Dynasty collapsed, and Chinese civilization was undergoing a transition to the Three Kingdoms period of Cao Wei, Shu Han, and Eastern Wu. Political upheaval in the north, such as Wang Mang's usurpation, had caused Han migrants to resettle in the south. <b>The</b> <b>Han</b> Dynasty's military expansion widened its commercial ties in addition acquiring large amounts of new territories. The empire's conquest of Minyue and Nanyue spoke of its vast size that it bordered the ancient kingdoms of Southeast Asia. Economic ties with <b>the</b> <b>Han</b> and subsequent dynasties affected the trajectory of maritime trade of Southeast Asia, where goods have been excavated made in styles resembling that of the ancient Han Chinese. Maritime trade and the Silk Road also linked China with Ancient Rome, India, and the Near East.|$|E
5|$|From roughly 115 to 60 BC, Han forces {{fought the}} Xiongnu {{over control of}} the oasis city-states in the Tarim Basin. Han was {{eventually}} victorious and established the Protectorate of the Western Regions in 60 BC, which dealt with the region's defense and foreign affairs. <b>The</b> <b>Han</b> also expanded southward. The naval conquest of Nanyue in 111 BC expanded <b>the</b> <b>Han</b> realm into what are now modern Guangdong, Guangxi, and northern Vietnam. Yunnan was brought into <b>the</b> <b>Han</b> realm with the conquest of the Dian Kingdom in 109 BC, followed by parts of the Korean Peninsula with the Wiman Joseon–Han War and colonial establishments of Xuantu Commandery and Lelang Commandery in 108 BC.

5|$|In 135 BC, {{war broke}} out when Minyue invaded Nanyue. Zhao Mo, the king of Nanyue, asked for and {{received}} the military assistance of <b>the</b> <b>Han.</b> In 180 BC, Zhao had offered to submit as a vassal and <b>the</b> <b>Han</b> agreed, a decision that was partly based on Zhao's ancestral roots in northern China. An army led by the generals Wang Hui and Han Anguo was ordered to invade Minyue. The campaign was cut short by palace infighting in the Minyue court. Panicked at news of an invasion, the younger brother of the Minyue king Zou Ying, Zou Yushan, conspired with the royal court to depose Ying. Yushan killed his brother with a spear, decapitated the corpse, and sent the head to Wang. <b>The</b> <b>Han</b> forces withdrew soon after.|$|E

5|$|Map-making in China preceded <b>the</b> <b>Han</b> dynasty. Since two 4th-century-BCE silk maps {{from the}} State of Qin (found in Gansu, {{displaying}} the region about the Jialing River) show the measured distance between timber-gathering sites, Mei-ling Hsu argues {{that these are}} to be considered the first known economic maps (as they predate the maps of the Roman geographer Strabo, c. 64 BCE– 24 CE). Maps from <b>the</b> <b>Han</b> period have also been uncovered by modern archaeologists, such as those found with 2nd-century-BCE silk texts at Mawangdui. In contrast to the Qin maps, <b>the</b> <b>Han</b> maps found at Mawangdui employ a more diverse use of map symbols, cover a larger terrain, and display information on local populations and even pinpoint locations of military camps. One of the maps discovered at Mawangdui shows positions of Han military garrisons which were to attack Nanyue in 181 BCE.|$|E

Once <b>the</b> <b>Han</b> had subjugated the Tarim Basin and {{established a}} Protectorate there, Han envoys in these states were given free food and lodging.
