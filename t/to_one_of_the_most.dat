5|$|After a two-and-a-half-season absence, Lippi {{returned}} to the club in 2001, following his replacement Carlo Ancelotti's dismissal, signing big name players such as Gianluigi Buffon, David Trezeguet, Pavel Nedvěd and Lilian Thuram, helping the team to two more scudetto titles during the 2001–02 and 2002–03 seasons. Juventus were also part of an all Italian Champions League final in 2003, but lost out to Milan on penalties after the game ended in a 0–0 draw. At {{the conclusion of the}} following season, Lippi was appointed as the Italy national team's head coach, bringing an end <b>to</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> fruitful managerial spells in Juventus' history.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Paine contributed <b>to</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> {{significant}} flooding {{events in}} Oklahoma history. The 16th tropical storm and 8th hurricane of the 1986 Pacific hurricane season, Paine formed on September 28 off the southeast coast of Mexico. It moved around a ridge, later {{turning to the}} north and brushing the Baja California Peninsula. By that time, Paine had attained peak winds of 100mph (155km/h), but it weakened slightly before hitting the Mexican state of Sonora. The remnant moisture combined with a cold front to produce heavy rainfall in the south-central United States.|$|E

It also attained hurricane strength at an unusual latitude, and contributed <b>to</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> active Novembers on record in terms of tropical cyclones. However, it stayed over open waters and did not have any effects on land. It was the 11th named storm of the season, and {{due to the lack of}} damage, its name was not retired.|$|E
5|$|This {{appeared}} {{to offer a}} solution <b>to</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>most</b> vexing problems of the era, designing an aircraft that was effective at subsonic and supersonic speeds. Subsonic lift is created by the airflow around the wing following streamlines, but supersonic lift is generated by shock waves at points of critical curvature. No single design could offer high performance for both regimes. The blown disk could attack this problem by being laid out for supersonic performance only, and then using jet thrust to modify subsonic airflow into a semblance of a normal wing. The resulting design would be tuned for high supersonic performance, have reasonable subsonic performance, and would also offer VTOL, all in a single design.|$|E
