5|$|Later, Homer {{goes back}} to <b>the</b> <b>farmhouse</b> to think. He sees old photographs, {{including}} one {{of himself as a}} child on Christmas morning, where he thinks his father was not even there when he finally got to meet Santa Claus. Homer then realizes that it was really his father in a Santa costume, proving that Grampa did actually care for him. Homer quickly reunites with Grampa, who by coincidence has also gone to <b>the</b> <b>farmhouse</b> to reflect. They both admit they are screw-ups – since they both caused separate fires in <b>the</b> <b>farmhouse</b> – and they finally reconcile.|$|E

5|$|The leftmost division, {{advanced}} on La Haye Sainte. <b>The</b> <b>farmhouse</b> was {{defended by}} the King's German Legion. While one French battalion engaged the defenders from the front, the following battalions fanned out {{to either side}} and, {{with the support of}} several squadrons of cuirassiers, succeeded in isolating <b>the</b> <b>farmhouse.</b> The King's German Legion resolutely defended <b>the</b> <b>farmhouse.</b> Each time the French tried to scale the walls the outnumbered Germans somehow held them off. The Prince of Orange saw that La Haye Sainte had been cut off and tried to reinforce it by sending forward the Hanoverian Lüneberg Battalion in line. Cuirassiers concealed in a fold in the ground caught and destroyed it in minutes and then rode on past La Haye Sainte, almost to the crest of the ridge, where they covered d'Erlon's left flank as his attack developed.|$|E

5|$|At the farm, the leprechaun lures J. D. {{into a trap}} by imitating a cat, biting and {{injuring}} his hand.

5|$|After the {{engagement}} at Le Cornet Malo, C Company and HQ Company of the 2nd Royal Norfolks had fallen {{back to their}} headquarters at Cornet Farm, just outside Le Paradis. The company commanders had been informed by radio that their units were isolated and would receive no assistance. They therefore dug in around <b>the</b> <b>farmhouse,</b> which lay on the Rue du Paradis, {{the boundary between the}} Royal Norfolk Regiment and the adjacent 1st Royal Scots. The Norfolks' last contact with Brigade Headquarters at L'Epinette was at 11:30 but despite no support and heavy opposition, the defenders held out against the 14th Company, 1st Battalion of the 2nd SS Infantry Regiment until 17:15, when they ran out of ammunition. During the battle the Germans attacked <b>the</b> <b>farmhouse</b> with mortars, tanks and artillery shelling, which destroyed the building and forced the defenders to relocate to a cowshed. SS-Standartenführer Hans Friedemann Götze, commander of the Totenkopf Division's third regiment, was killed in the fighting.|$|E
5|$|Applewood Farm is a {{farmstead}} in Ledyard, Connecticut, United States. Constructed in 1826 by Russel Gallup, <b>the</b> <b>farmhouse</b> {{was built}} with a colonial center chimney design with Federal style details {{that has been}} modernized to the early 20th century without significantly changing the floor plan. Named after the apple orchards planted by Russel Gallup, Applewood Farm developed significantly under the ownership of Everett Gallup, the last {{member of the family}} to own the property. The property was later owned by Arlene Meyer Cohen and a 40-acre parcel was sold off in November 1984. After the Betz family became the owners it was added to the National Register of Historic Places and operated as a bed and breakfast through the 1990s. In 1987, the property included five contributory structures, <b>the</b> <b>farmhouse,</b> corn crib, barn, silo and chicken coop. The property also has one non-contributing structure, a machinery shed from the 1960s.|$|E

5|$|Bamber {{arrived at}} <b>the</b> <b>farmhouse</b> {{one or two}} minutes after the police.

25|$|The {{advent of}} Romanticism {{began to show}} in <b>the</b> <b>farmhouses</b> around <b>the</b> mid-19th century, shortly after its debut in the estates. Like their neoclassical predecessors, they took as much {{inspiration}} from popular German forms as from the landowners' homes. <b>The</b> <b>farmhouses</b> built during this period are large, square, hipped-roof structures with ponderous cornices and large porches to match. While there are no houses in this style left in the district, some older barns and other farm buildings show it.|$|R

5|$|Filming began October 2000. From {{the onset}} of filming, {{difficulties}} with the studio slowed the film's development and caused a rift between the director and Universal Pictures, as executives were unhappy with the film's pacing, emphasis on small scale action sequences, and the general relationship between themselves and Liman, who was suspicious of direct studio involvement. A number of reshoots and rewrites late in development, plus scheduling problems, delayed the film from its original release target date of September 2001 to June 2002 and took it $8,000,000 over budget from the initial budget of $60 million; screenwriter Tony Gilroy faxed elements of screenplay rewrites almost throughout the entire duration of filming. A particular point of contention {{with regard to the}} original Gilroy script were the scenes set in <b>the</b> <b>farmhouse</b> near the film's conclusion. Liman and Matt Damon fought to keep the scenes in the film after they were excised in a third-act rewrite that was insisted upon by the studio. Liman and Damon argued that, though the scenes were low key, they were integral to the audience's understanding of the Bourne character and the film's central themes. <b>The</b> <b>farmhouse</b> sequence consequently went through many rewrites from its original incarnation before its inclusion in the final product.|$|E

40|$|In Italy only few {{researches}} have {{been devoted to}} the analysis of <b>the</b> <b>farmhouses</b> market. This stems from the difficulty of having information about the real price of selling. In an attempt to partially overcome such drawback, the offer prices of more than 600 farmhouses were collected from the website of the estate agents in the Veneto region in 2008. Using these data {{it was found that the}} factors affecting the value of <b>the</b> <b>farmhouses</b> are in many ways similar to those of the housing market of the region. The value of <b>the</b> <b>farmhouses</b> is higher in the cities and tends to decline gradually moving to the metropolitan municipalities and to the marginal rural areas. In the hills and mountains, however, the value tends to be higher than the urban houses. The value of the rural houses seems depend on the degree of economic development of the territory and its environmental and landscape features...|$|R

5|$|He was bailed {{from the}} police station on 13 September, after which he went on holiday to Saint-Tropez.

5|$|The Texas Chain Saw Massacre {{was mainly}} shot using an Eclair NPR 16mm camera with fine-grain, {{low-speed}} film that required {{four times more}} light than modern digital cameras. Most of the filming took place in <b>the</b> <b>farmhouse,</b> which was filled with furniture constructed from animal bones and a latex material used as upholstery to {{give the appearance of}} human skin. The house was not cooled, and there was little ventilation. The crew covered its walls with drops of animal blood obtained from a local slaughterhouse. Art director Robert A. Burns drove around the countryside and collected the remains of cattle and other animals in various stages of decomposition, with which he littered the floors of the house.|$|E

With Soviet troops closing in, the last 300 to 700 Sonderkommandos disposing of the incriminating evidence were executed by Trawnikis in late July 1944, long after the camp's official closure.
