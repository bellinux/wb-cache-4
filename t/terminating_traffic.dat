30|$|The model mainly {{focuses on}} road {{transport}} and calculates freight transport demand in four steps. Thus, originating traffic is identified and derived from structural data related to traffic areas (e.g., economic sectors, number of active driving employees of companies).

In a second step, the <b>terminating</b> <b>traffic</b> potentials are calculated based on the distribution of industries and recipient structure of these industries. These characteristics are used to weight originating trips to destination. Subsequently, origins and destinations are linked by their volume and potential as well as taking into account distances, for instance.

40|$|The Telecommunications Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) attempted, in late 1999, to {{introduce}} the calling party pays (CPP) regime for mobile cellular services, with a corresponding revenue-sharing arrangement between fixed and mobile operators. According to the revenue-sharing proposal, mobile operators in India were to be compensated for carrying traffic {{to and from the}} fixed networks. Under their original license conditions, fixed operators (usually one of the two state-owned incumbents) were not paying mobile operators for terminating calls on their networks. However, mobile operators had to compensate the state-owned incumbent for <b>terminating</b> <b>traffic.</b> This unfavourable environment for mobile operators has meant that mobile services {{have not been able to}} reach their full potential in India. There was great disappointment within the mobile industry when the TRAI's CPP order was overturned by the Supreme Court of India in early 2000, due to lack of jurisdiction. Since then, the enabling legislation has been amended. It is hoped that the new provisions of the TRAI Act will empower the regulator to establish a level playing field for mobile network operators.

40|$|The US FCC {{claims that}} 70 % of its net {{settlement}} payments to foreign operators is a subsidy, and has used {{this as a}} basis for its 1997 Benchmarking Order-determining price cap settlement rates that US operators should pay to foreign operators for terminating US traffic. The evidence shows this is not a subsidy, but monopoly profit. However, the margin of monopoly profit (price minus unit cost) is lower than the margin realised by US operators for <b>terminating</b> <b>traffic</b> from other countries. These margins, in turn, are lower than the mark-up of price over cost that is charged to consumers of US international services. Imbalances in traffic flows between countries are a normal part of international trade in any industry, and {{with the possible exception of}} US-Mexico relations, the 1990 s international telecom trends are explained by the success of the US economy, particularly in exporting services, and the direct actions of the FCC and US operators. As the FCC benchmarks are implemented, high-cost countries, including many poor developing countries, will be required to subsidise the monopoly profits of US operators, introducing a major constraint on the capabilities of these countries to develop national networks. The ITU has taken a more constructive approach to reform, based on consensus and a more detailed examination of termination costs in different countries. But this is unlikely to be supported by the US as its operator's benefit more under the umbrella of the FCC order. Ultimately the settlement rate system will have to give way to a uniform structure of termination rates in each country for traffic coming from any other country. This will benefit consumers and efficient network development at all levels. But the path to get there is likely to be a difficult one, with substantial resistance from the most powerful interests reaping monopoly profit from the existing system.

25|$|Following the {{termination}} of line 1 in 1967, two additional committees was set to investigate {{the future of the}} city's public transport department, but neither arrived at any new conclusions. In 1969 {{the decision was made to}} <b>terminate</b> <b>traffic</b> on line 3 in 1970, but due to delays in delivering the new buses and other difficulties, in the end only line 3A (the inner circle on circular line 3) was terminated, a year behind schedule on 24 April 1971. During the same year the decision was made to convert line 2 into bus traffic in 1972 and line 3B in 1973. Traffic on line 2 ended on 31 May 1972 and finally line 3B (the outer circle on line 3) was closed ahead of schedule on 1 October 1972. During the last day of operations all trams in traffic were full with passengers wishing to give their farewells – some even decorated the trams with flowers.

40|$|International Internet Telephony {{has been}} {{evolving}} since its introduction in 1996. In 1996, the typical player was someone like Delta Three, {{who used the}} Internet as a backbone network, used agreements with local ISPs to ?gray-market? <b>terminate</b> <b>traffic</b> in a country, such as Columbia or Israel, and then used a VocalTec type gateway to interconnect the local call with an E&M or R 2 type signaling.

Today, four years later, {{there is a clear}} segmentation of models. At one extreme is the extension of the Delta Three approach still being provided by delta Three as well as IBasis and ITXC. This is the ?be everywhere but be shallow? approach. This approach uses the Internet as a backbone and then deals with local players as did Delta Three at the beginning. The other approach is one which integrates IP services. It is an approach characterized by ?be selective but own the IP market? approach.

40|$|Pre-congestion {{notification}} (PCN) uses packet metering and marking {{to notify}} network boundaries {{when the current}} traffic load on some links of a PCN domain exceeds their configured admissible or supportable rates. This feedback is used for PCN-based admission control and flow termination within single PCN domains (edge-to-edge PCN). While admission control is rather well understood, flow termination is a new flow control function and useful especially in case of failures or flash crowds. Originally, only measured rate termination was proposed. It operates on ingress-egress aggregates between ingress and egress nodes of a PCN domain, <b>terminates</b> overload <b>traffic</b> in one shot, and requires single-path routing. We present marked flow termination as a new paradigm. It works for both ingress-egress aggregates and individual flows, <b>terminates</b> overload <b>traffic</b> gradually, and works well with multipath routing. The major contribution {{of this paper is}} the presentation of several marked flow termination methods, the study of their termination behavior, recommendations for their configuration, and the discussion of their benefits and shortcomings. A secondary contribution is the introduction of end-to-end PCN which moves the control from the boundaries of possibly several PCN domains to the end systems.

50|$|During {{the heyday}} of the telegraph, the Western Union Building was a premier nexus of {{worldwide}} communications, operating in parallel to the existing Bell Operating Companies of the day. Since Western Union moved its headquarters to New Jersey, the building has been converted into a colocation centre where over 1000 telecommunications companies interconnect Internet as well as conventional TDM traffic through numerous Meet Me Rooms and optical and electrical lines placed throughout the building. It is once again a premier nexus of worldwide communications.

40|$|Abstract In this article, {{we present}} a {{detailed}} perfor-mance evaluation of a hybrid optical switching (HOS) architecture called Overspill Routing in Optical Net-works (ORION). The ORION architecture combines (optical) wavelength and (electronic) packet switching, so as to obtain the individual advantages of both switch-ing paradigms. In particular, ORION exploits the pos-sible idle periods of established lightpaths to transmit packets destined to the next common node, or even directly to their common end-destination. Depending on whether all lightpaths are allowed to simultaneously carry and <b>terminate</b> overspill <b>traffic</b> or overspill is re-stricted to a sub-set of wavelengths, the architecture limits itself to constrained or un-constrainedORION. To evaluate both cases, we developed an extensive network simulator where the basic features of the ORION archi-tectureweremodeled, including suitable edge/corenode switches and load-varying sources to simulate overload-ing traffic conditions. Further, we have assessed vari-ous aspects of the ORION architecture including two basic routing/forwarding policies and various buffer-ing schemes. The complete network study shows that ORION can absorb temporal traffic overloads, as in-tended, provided sufficient buffering is present.
