5|$|On 10 August, the High Court {{dismissed}} {{the request for}} judicial review, thus giving the go-ahead {{for the government to}} demolish it. The judge ruled that the applicants had failed to establish <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>government</b> <b>had</b> acted perversely.|$|E

5|$|Manning's lawyers argued <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>government</b> <b>had</b> overstated {{the harm}} {{the release of}} the {{documents}} had caused, and had overcharged Manning to force her to give evidence against Assange.

5|$|After the storm, {{approximately}} 100,000people {{were facing}} starvation. Then-Haitian president Louis Borno reported <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>government</b> <b>had</b> inefficient resources for recovery and asked citizens {{to assist with}} repairing infrastructure and providing food and shelter to others. The Government of Haiti, in turn, appropriated $200,000 for relief. Eleven storages with relief supplies were established throughout the country. The approximately 10,000people left homeless were temporarily houses in larger, undamaged buildings. Within {{a few months after}} the storm, 299homes were rebuilt or repair, costing almost $37,000. The vehicular paths destroyed by the hurricane were eventually replaced by -wide paved gravel roads. In September, the American Red Cross donated $10,000 to the Haitian Red Cross.|$|E

5|$|By 1901 Adelaide's horse trams {{were seen}} by the public as a blot on the city's image. With a {{population}} of 162,000 the slow speed of the trams, and the lines subsequent low traffic capacity, made them inadequate for public transport needs. The unsealed roads the horses required became quagmires in winter and sources of dust in summer. The 10pounds of manure each horse left behind daily, was also not well regarded. Under these various pressures the government negotiated to purchase the horse tramway companies. A 28 March 1906 newspaper notice announced <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>government</b> <b>had</b> purchased all of the city tramways for £280,000. Bill No.913, passed 22 December 1906, created the Municipal Tramways Trust (MTT) with the authority to build new and purchase existing tramways.|$|E
5|$|Herring was {{promoted}} to the temporary rank of major general on 14August1941 {{when he took over}} command of the 6th Division. He returned to Australia with it in March 1942. Unaware <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>government</b> <b>had</b> already decided that General Sir Thomas Blamey should be appointed Commander in Chief, Herring, along with Major General George Alan Vasey and Brigadier Clive Steele, approached Army Minister Frank Forde with a proposal that all officers over the age of 50 be immediately retired and Major General Horace Robertson appointed Commander in Chief. The 'revolt of the generals' collapsed with the announcement that General Blamey was returning from the Middle East to become Commander in Chief, but seems to have done the participants no harm.|$|E
5|$|In November 1945, the Minister for the Army, Frank Forde, {{informed}} Blamey <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>government</b> <b>had</b> {{decided to}} re-establish the Military Board {{and he should}} therefore vacate his office. Sturdee became acting Commander in Chief on 1 December 1945. On 1 March 1946, the post of Commander in Chief was abolished and Sturdee became Chief of the General Staff again. There was much work to be done; the wartime Army had a strength of 383,000 in August 1945, of whom 177,000 were serving outside Australia.|$|E

5|$|In a {{parliamentary}} speech on 28 February 2008, Deputy Prime Minister Wong Kan Seng said <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>Government</b> <b>had</b> adjusted its policies {{in relation to}} various types of expression. For instance, in 2000 it had created Speakers' Corner as an outdoor venue for political speeches. Use of this venue was liberalized in 2004 to include performances and exhibitions. All public talks held indoors involving organizers and speakers who are Singapore citizens are also exempted from the licensing requirements of the Public Entertainments and Meetings Act. However, {{freedom of speech and}} expression, though characteristic and imperative in a self-professed democracy, is not unfettered. The Government thus continues to require licences for events where the speeches relate to race or religion, and does not permit outdoor demonstrations to be held.|$|E
5|$|On 26 August 2013, a local lawyer Ranjana Agnihotri filed a {{habeas corpus}} {{petition}} in the Allahabad High Court's Lucknow bench, on which judges Imtiyaz Murtaza and D K Upadhayaya passed the release order for Rambhadracharya, along with Singhal and Praveen Togadia. The petitioner's advocate H S Jain {{said that even}} though Rambhadracharya and other leaders were arrested under the section 151 of the 1973 Criminal Procedure Code, which permits an arrest to prevent commission of cognisable offences, the custody period cannot exceed 24 hours unless any other section of the code or any other law is applicable.

Both advised Lamo to go to the authorities. His friend informed the Army's Criminal Investigation Command (CID), and Lamo was contacted by CID agents shortly thereafter. He told them he believed Manning was endangering lives. He was largely ostracized by the hacker community afterwards. Nicks argues, on the other hand, that it was thanks to Lamo <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>government</b> <b>had</b> months to ameliorate any harm caused by the release of the diplomatic cables.|$|E

5|$|Tai Loong {{believed}} <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>government</b> <b>had</b> exceeded its {{statutory authority}} by confiscating the fins. It argued that before Judge Barry Ted Moskowitz, {{a federal district}} judge for the Southern District of California, who granted an injunction against NOAA prohibiting it from selling the fins itself. The company and the agency then agreed that, {{in return for the}} former putting up a $775,000 bond, that it would take possession of the shark fins, although they remained in cold storage pending the outcome of the case. Tai Loong presold the fins for an amount almost equal to the fine against it. NOAA then initiated a civil forfeiture action with the bond substituting for the fins.|$|E

5|$|The law was {{a second}} attempt by Senator Yee to enact {{restrictions}} for video game sales to minors. Yee's background as a child psychologist led him to assert there was a connection between video games and violence and believed <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>government</b> <b>had</b> strong interest in restricting video game sales to minors as was already done for pornographic works. In 2004, Yee had drafted {{a law that would}} have required mature-rated video games to be stocked separately from other titles. Though the bill ultimately passed as CA Law AB 1793, the bill's language was diluted at its passage, only requiring stores to display the ESRB ratings system and provide information to parents about it.|$|E

Two defense attorneys, Henry Balaban and Edward J. Hess (who was representing Kaplan at the trial), who had also defended clients in cases the government's case-in-chief had alleged to be fixed, denying paying bribes to Glasser or Kretske (although the government had not accused them of this). Glasser's testimony took three hours, as he was cross-examined individually about every single case <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>government</b> <b>had</b> alleged to have been fixed.|$|E
5|$|Another {{significant}} {{storm was}} Hurricane Hattie, a late-season Category5 hurricane that struck Belize. Hattie caused 319confirmed fatalities and about $60.3million in damage. Destruction was so severe in Belize <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>government</b> <b>had</b> to relocate inland {{to a new}} city, Belmopan. The remnants of Hattie {{may have contributed to}} the development of Tropical Storm Simone in the eastern Pacific Ocean. In early November, the depression that would later strengthen into Hurricane Jenny brought light rainfall to Puerto Rico. The final storm, Tropical Storm Inga, dissipated on November8, after causing no impact on land. On September11, three hurricanes existed simultaneously – Betsy, Carla, and Debbie – the most on a single day in the Atlantic basin since 1893 and until 1998. Collectively, the storms of the 1961Atlantic hurricane season caused about $391million in damage and at least 348fatalities.|$|E
5|$|At the time, the {{government}} was spending NOK 1.4 billion annually on purchasing passenger transport from NSB. By introducing PSO, Skogsholm stated that she hoped the costs would be reduced, and that quality and safety levels would remain, or even improve. The counties {{have been allowed to}} issue PSO contracts on bus transport since 1994; and Skogsholm saw the competition in rail transport as a continuation of this. Following the announcement of the competition, CEO of NSB, Einar Enger, said that he did not see competition as a threat, but instead that NSB would introduce means to rationalize costs. In November 2002, NSB laid off 100 employees, and reduced its administration by a third. The administration of all local and regional trains was reallocated to Oslo.
