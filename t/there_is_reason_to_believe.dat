5|$|Meanwhile, in Raleigh, North Carolina, a {{young couple}} are kidnapped by a man dressed as a police officer. Several days later, Scully and her partner Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) discuss the case in Mulder's office at FBI headquarters. Mulder relates that the case {{seems to be the}} work of a repeat offender, and <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>reason</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> the couple will be killed in a matter of days. He also tells Scully that Luther Lee Boggs (Brad Dourif), a serial killer he had helped to {{apprehend}} years before, has claimed to have had psychic revelations about the kidnapping and has offered to help police in exchange for his death sentence being commuted. Mulder is unusually skeptical about Boggs' claims.|$|E
5|$|The sculptors {{very likely}} also {{operated}} in Brescia because Bartolomeo {{was known to}} have resided there at least between 1501 and 1503, and such a long presence can be justified only by admitting the existence of significant local commissions. <b>There</b> <b>is</b> <b>reason</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> that the Sanmicheli organisation should have deeper roots in Brescia during the two years mentioned, ranging from the construction of dei Miracoli {{to that of the}} Loggia. With the Loggia, however, the mature talent of Cairano broke into the Brescian art scene, and his powerful sculptural sequence of the Caesars testifies to the decline of the Sanmicheli, whose ornate style was no longer of interest to the municipality and nobility.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{drawings}} {{described in this}} letter as showing drafts of the two new patterns, together with any royal response to the complaint which may have accompanied them, having been lost, (possibly in the 1834 Burning of Parliament), other evidence exists, at least on paper, of a Scottish variant whereby the Scottish cross appears uppermost. Whilst, {{in the absence of}} evidence to the contrary, this design is considered by most vexillologists to have been unofficial, <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>reason</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> that such flags were employed during the 17th century for use on Scottish vessels at sea. This flag's design is also described in the 1704 edition of The Present State of the Universe by John Beaumont, Junior, which contains as an appendix The Ensigns, Colours or Flags of the Ships at Sea: Belonging to The several Princes and States in the World.|$|E

5|$|The {{year and}} {{circumstances}} of Ragnall's death are uncertain, as surviving contemporary sources failed to mark his demise. According to clan tradition {{preserved in the}} Book of Clanranald, Ragnall may have died in 1207. However, no corroborating evidence supports this date, and <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>reason</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> that dates in this source are unreliable. In fact, this source misplaces Somairle's death by sixteen years, which may indicate that Ragnall himself died some sixteen years earlier (in 1191). If this date is correct then Ragnall's death {{may be related to}} his defeat suffered at the hands of his brother. However, the Chronicle of Mann, which records the 1192 conflict between Ragnall and Áengus, gives no hint of Ragnall's demise in its account. Another possibility is that Ragnall may have been slain sometime around 1209 and 1210, during yet more internal conflict amongst the meic Somairle.|$|E

25|$|An {{opposing}} theory, {{proposed by}} Nicholas Maclean Bristol, is that <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>reason</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> that they descend from Neill Maclean who appears on Exchequer Rolls {{at a time}} when Tarbert Castle was being rebuilt by Robert the Bruce. In 1252 Neil Macneil, fifth of Bara was described as a prince at a Council of the Lord of the Isles.

25|$|Traditional {{insurance}} {{works by}} transferring risk to those better able or {{more willing to}} bear risk, and also by the pooling of risk (Goldemberg et al., 1996, p.25). Since the risks of climate change are, to some extent, correlated, this reduces the effectiveness of pooling. However, <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>reason</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> that different regions will be affected differently by climate change. This suggests that pooling might be effective. Since developing countries appear to be potentially most at risk {{from the effects of}} climate change, developed countries could provide insurance against these risks.|$|E
25|$|The {{battle plan}} called for German forces to be {{launched}} from Cherbourg to Lyme Regis, Le Havre to Ventnor and Brighton, Boulogne to Eastbourne, Calais to Folkestone, and Dunkirk and Ostend to Ramsgate. Fallschirmjäger (paratroopers) would land near Brighton and Dover. Once the coast was secured, they would push north and take Gloucester and encircle London. <b>There</b> <b>is</b> <b>reason</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> that the Germans would not attempt to assault the city but besiege and bombard it. German forces would secure England up to the 52nd parallel (approximately {{as far north as}} Northampton), anticipating {{that the rest of the}} United Kingdom would then surrender.|$|E
25|$|Thus <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>reason</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> that ophiolites {{are indeed}} oceanic mantle and crust; however, certain {{problems}} arise when looking closer. Compositional differences regarding silica (SiO2) and titania (TiO2) contents, for example, place ophiolite basalts {{in the domain}} of subduction zones (~55% silica, <1% TiO2), whereas mid-ocean ridge basalts typically have ~50% silica and 1.5-2.5% TiO2. These chemical differences extend to a range of trace elements as well (that is, chemical elements occurring in amounts of 1000 ppm or less). In particular, trace elements associated with subduction zone (island arc) volcanics tend to be high in ophiolites, whereas trace elements that are high in ocean ridge basalts but low in subduction zone volcanics are also low in ophiolites.|$|E

25|$|<b>There</b> <b>is</b> <b>reason</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> that Eugène's father, Charles-François Delacroix, was {{infertile}} at {{the time}} of Eugène's conception and that his real father was Talleyrand, who was a friend of the family and successor of Charles Delacroix as Minister of Foreign Affairs, and whom the adult Eugène resembled in appearance and character. Throughout his career as a painter, he was protected by Talleyrand, who served successively the Restoration and king Louis-Philippe, and ultimately as ambassador of France in Great Britain, and later by Talleyrand's grandson, Charles Auguste Louis Joseph, duc de Morny, half-brother of Napoleon III and speaker of the French House of Commons. His presumed father, Charles Delacroix, died in 1805, and his mother in 1814, leaving 16-year-old Eugène an orphan.|$|E
25|$|In 1553, this Neill {{sold the}} island to James MacDonald of Islay. Neill died without issue, and the next in line to the chiefship was another Neil, who {{obtained}} the lands of Taynish. His descendant Hector Macneill of Taynish purchased Gigha in 1590. With {{the power of the}} Campbells growing and spreading out into the Inner Hebrides, the influence of the McNeills of Gigha decreased. At about this time the MacNeils on more remote island of Barra, far removed of Campbell power, began to grow in prominence {{and for a long time}} since have been regarded as Chief of the Clan and Name. Descending from this branch were the MacNeils of Colonsay who obtained Colonsay in 1700 and owned it until 1904 when it was sold by John Carstairs McNeill. According to Moncreiffe, <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>reason</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> that historically this branch were superior to the current chiefs of the Clan Macneil. There is even a school of thought that there is no relation at all between this branch of McNeills to that of Barra. However, according to a 1962 decree by the Lord Lyon, the chiefs of MacNeil of Barra are chiefs of the whole name of MacNeil by Scots law.|$|E
500|$|The {{dates of}} Wihtred's and Ine's laws are {{somewhat}} uncertain, but <b>there</b> <b>is</b> <b>reason</b> <b>to</b> <b>believe</b> that Wihtred's laws were issued on 6 September 695, while Ine's laws {{were written in}} 694 or shortly before. [...] Ine had recently agreed peaceful terms with Wihtred over compensation {{for the death of}} Mul, and there are indications that the two rulers collaborated to some degree in producing their laws. [...] In addition to the coincidence of timing, there is one clause that appears in almost identical form in both codes. Another sign of collaboration is that Wihtred's laws use gesith, a West Saxon term for noble, in place of the Kentish term eorlcund. [...] It is possible that Ine and Wihtred issued the law codes as an act of prestige, to re-establish authority after periods of disruption in both kingdoms.|$|E
