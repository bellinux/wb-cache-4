40|$|In this thesis, {{methods and}} {{computational}} techniques for predicting the static and steady state {{characteristics of a}} switched reluctance motor drive are developed and the predicted characteristics are compared with experimental results. Because of high local saturation and narrow airgap in the SR motor, accurate calculation of the static characteristics of the <b>torque,</b> flux <b>linkage,</b> inductances, and speed emf from its FE field solution is not straightforward. For {{the purpose of this}} study, a two-dimensional finite element model is developed to handle the nonlinear magnetic field inside the machine. Based on a thorough study of the potential sources of errors in the field solution and in the computational methods used in postprocessing, new guidelines are developed regarding the shape and uniformity of the mesh in the airgap and the preservation of these qualities of the mesh as the rotor is rotated. When the proposed guidelines on the mesh configuration and its rotation were used, significant improvement in the accuracy of the field distribution and in the accuracy of the predicted torque/angle characteristics as compared to the experimentally measured torque was observed. Furthermore, all three methods of torque calculation, namely global virtual work, local virtual work, and Maxwell-stress tensor methods are converging to the same results and the torque/angle characteristics are smooth. Improvement in the prediction of such static characteristics is also essential to a realistic prediction of the steady state behavior. In the study of steady state performance of the SRM drive, the converter is approximated by a controlled, square wave pulse generator. In the integration process, the coefficients of the governing differential equation, being dependent on the phase current and rotor angle, are updated using surface interpolation method on the static characteristics.

While much of the focus has been directed towards robot-based methods, mechanically passive methods capable of providing similar therapeutic benefits in a less expensive and safer package are also being explored. Such devices are more practical for wide-spread use, both in a clinical setting {{as well as for}} in-home therapy. This thesis developed a mechanically passive device for neuromuscular rehabilitation after stroke called WRIST (Wrist Resonator for Independent Stroke Training). WRIST incorporates a tone-canceling linkage designed to counteract intrinsic wrist stiffness to ease movement, as well as an appropriately designed mass and superimposed spring stiffness to create a resonant environment that the user can take advantage of to facilitate repetitive wrist flexion and extension.

40|$|ABSTRACT- This paper {{presents}} a direct flux and torque control (DTC) of three phase induction motor drive (IMD) using PI and fuzzy logic controllers (FLC) for speed regulator (SR) and low torque ripples. This control method {{is based on}} DTC operating principles. The DTC {{is one of the}} most excellent direct control strategies of stator flux and torque ripples of IMD. The key issue of the DTC is the strategy of selecting proper stator voltage vectors to force stator flux and developed torque within a prescribed band. Due to the nature of hysteresis control adopted in DTC, there is no difference in control action between a large torque error and a small one. This results in high torque ripple. It is better to divide the torque error into different intervals and give different control voltages for each of them. To deal with this issue a fuzzy logic controller has been introduced. The main drawback with the conventional DTC of IMD is high stator flux and torque ripples and the speed of IMD is reduced under transient and dynamic state of operating condition. This drawback is reduced by the proposed system, the speed is regulated by PI controller and torque is controlled by fuzzy logic controller. The amplitude of the reference stator flux is kept constant at rated value.

40|$|Current source {{inverter}} (CSI) fed drives {{are employed}} in high power applications. The conventional CSI drives suffer from drawbacks such as harmonic resonance, unstable operation at low speed ranges, and torque pulsation. CSI fed drives with Direct Torque Control (DTC) has drawn {{the attention of the}} motor drives designers because its implementation requires no position sensor. Crucial to the success of this scheme is the estimation of electromagnetic torque and stator flux linkages using the measured stator voltages and currents. The estimation is dependent only on one machine parameter, stator resistance. The variation of the stator resistance, deteriorates the performance of the drive by introducing errors in the estimated flux linkage’s magnitude and its position and hence in the electromagnetic torque. Resistance change also skews the torque linearity thus making the motor drive a less than ideal torque amplifier. Parameter compensation using stator current phasor error has been proposed in literature. To obtain the stator current phasor error, the stator current reference is required which is not usually available in direct torque control schemes. An analytical derivation of the stator current phasor reference is derived systematically from the reference electromagnetic <b>torque</b> and flux <b>linkages.</b> The error between the stator current phasor reference and its measured value {{is a measure of the}} stator resistance variation from its set value. For the first time, it is demonstrated in this paper that DTC motor drive system can become unstable when the set value of the stator resistance in the controller is higher than the stator resistance in the machine. Hence parameter adaptation is not only important for torque linearity but also for stability of the system is shown in this paper. </p...|$|R
40|$|Multi-phase motors {{have several}} {{advantages}} over the traditional three-phase motors. In this study, the additional {{degrees of freedom}} available in five-phase permanent magnet motors {{have been used for}} three purposes: 1) enhancing the torque producing capability of the motor, 2) improving the reliability of the system, and 3) better adjusting of the <b>torque</b> and flux <b>linkages</b> of the five-phase direct torque controlled system. 1) Due to the fact that space and time harmonics of the same orders will contribute positively to output torque, a five-phase permanent magnet motor with quasi-rectangular back-EMF waveform is supplied with combined fundamental and third harmonic of currents. For modeling and analysis of the motor a 0 3 3 1 1 q d q d frame of reference is defined where 1 1 q d rotates at the synchronous speed and 3 3 q d rotates at the three times synchronous speed. Based on the mathematical model in the 0 3 3 1 1 q d q d frame of reference, it is shown that this system while having a higher torque density with respect to a conventional permanent magnet synchronous machine, is also compatible with vector control algorithm. 2) A resilient current control of the five-phase permanent motor with both sinusoidal and trapezoidal back-EMF waveforms under asymmetrical fault condition is proposed. In this scheme, the stator MMF is kept unchanged during healthy and faulty condition. Therefore, the five-phase permanent magnet motor operates continuously and steadily without additional hardware and just by modifying the control algorithm in case of loss of up to two phases. The feature is of major importance in some specific applications where high reliability is required. 3) High torque and flux ripple are the major drawbacks of a three-phase direct torque controlled system. The number of space voltage vectors directly influences the performance of DTC system. A five-phase drive, while benefiting from other advantages of high order phase drives, has inherently 32 space voltage vectors which permits better flexibility in selecting the switching states and finer adjustment of flux and torque. A sensorless direct torque control of five-phase permanent magnet motor is implemented. Speed information is obtained based on the position of stator flux linkages and load angle. Experiments have been conducted on a 5 kW five-phase surface mount permanent magnet motor and a 3 kW five-phase interior permanent magnet motor by using TMS 320 C 32 DSP. The results obtained are consistent with theoretical studies and simulation analysis, which further demonstrate the feasibility and practical significance of the five-phase permanent magnet motor drives...|$|R
40|$|Some {{essential}} and important improvements {{of the direct}} torque controlled interior permanent magnet (IPM) synchronous machine drive are presented in this thesis. These studies, including analysis, modeling and experimental implementations confirm {{the possibility of a}} high performance direct torque controlled IPM synchronous motor drive without any continuous rotor position and speed sensor and without any current controller. The direct torque control technique, the comparison between DTC and FOC, and compensation methods for the problems/limitations associated with DTC have been investigated in this thesis. A number of important problems that affect the accuracy of the estimated machine flux linkage on which the DTC technique is built are thoroughly examined. Estimation of stator resistance variation, analysis and compensation of the non-linear effects of the inverter such as forward voltage drop and dead-time, speed sensorless control, and torque and flux ripple minimization for a direct torque controlled IPM motor drive are of major concern in this thesis. A Proportional-Integral stator resistance estimator based on stator current has been investigated for the compensation of any variation in stator resistance. It is shown that the estimator can track the variation of the stator resistance adequately. The scheme utilizes the error between the actual current and the reference current and requires no position signal. Modeling and experimental results will be shown. The non-linear effects of the inverter affect flux estimation greatly, especially at low speed. The effects such as forward voltage drop, dead-time and switching delay is analyzed, they degrade the system performance by introducing error between the estimated values and the actual values. The effects of the forward voltage drop and deadtime can be compensated by using a look-up table. The performance improvement of the drive has been shown in experiments. A speed estimation scheme based on stator flux linkage estimation is adopted and investigated experimentally. Furthermore, the possibility of fielding-weakening operation of the speed sensorless control is also investigated by modeling. The torque and flux ripples are significant problems of the DTC, and are mentioned widely. In order to solve this problem, the changes of <b>torque</b> and flux <b>linkage</b> over a sampling period are derived. Based on the analysis, a modified DTC is proposed to overcome these significant problems. Modeling and experimental results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed scheme. The field weakening control and speed sensorless control scheme is also combined with the proposed scheme. The experimental results show the new DTC scheme can achieve wider range operation and speed sensorless control successfully. The torque and flux ripples are reduced greatly under the new scheme in all experimental results. These abovementioned studies have clearly established that the DTC technique for the IPM machine is now much closer to being a viable and cost-effective candidate for a sensorless PM synchronous motor drive...|$|R
