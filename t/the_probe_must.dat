50|$|The {{electrical}} output from the photomultiplier tube {{is used as}} constant feedback to the piezoelectric transducer to adjust {{the height of the}} tip according to variations in surface topography. <b>The</b> <b>probe</b> <b>must</b> be scanned perpendicular to the sample surface in order to calibrate the instrument and determine the decay constant of the field intensity as a function of probe height. During this scan, a feedback point is set so that the piezoelectric transducer can maintain constant signal intensity during the lateral scan.|$|E
50|$|In the past, {{the bypass}} {{capacitor}} in the probe head was adjustable (to achieve this 10× attenuation). More modern probe designs use a laser-trimmed thick-film electronic circuit {{in the head}} that combines the 9 megohm resistor with a fixed-value bypass capacitor; they then place a small adjustable capacitor in parallel with the oscilloscope's input capacitance. Either way, <b>the</b> <b>probe</b> <b>must</b> be adjusted so that it provides uniform attenuation at all frequencies. This {{is referred to as}} compensating the probe. Compensation is usually accomplished by probing a 1 kHz square wave and adjusting the compensating capacitor until the oscilloscope displays the most square waveshape. Most oscilloscopes have a 1 kHz calibration source on their front panels since probe compensation must be done every time a 10:1 probe is attached to an oscilloscope input. Newer, faster probes have more complex compensation arrangements and may occasionally require further adjustments.|$|E
50|$|Conductive level sensors {{are ideal}} for the point level {{detection}} {{of a wide range}} of conductive liquids such as water, and is especially well suited for highly corrosive liquids such as caustic soda, hydrochloric acid, nitric acid, ferric chloride, and similar liquids. For those conductive liquids that are corrosive, the sensor’s electrodes need to be constructed from titanium, Hastelloy B or C, or 316 stainless steel and insulated with spacers, separators or holders of ceramic, polyethylene and Teflon-based materials. Depending on their design, multiple electrodes of differing lengths can be used with one holder. Since corrosive liquids become more aggressive as temperature and pressure increase, these extreme conditions need to be considered when specifying these sensors. Conductive level sensors use a low-voltage, current-limited power source applied across separate electrodes. The power supply is matched to the conductivity of the liquid, with higher voltage versions designed to operate in less conductive (higher resistance) mediums. The power source frequently incorporates some aspect of control, such as high-low or alternating pump control. A conductive liquid contacting both the longest probe (common) and a shorter probe (return) completes a conductive circuit. Conductive sensors are extremely safe because they use low voltages and currents. Since the current and voltage used is inherently small, for personal safety reasons, the technique is also capable of being made “Intrinsically Safe” to meet international standards for hazardous locations. Conductive probes have the additional benefit of being solid-state devices and are very simple to install and use. In some liquids and applications, maintenance can be an issue. <b>The</b> <b>probe</b> <b>must</b> continue to be conductive. If buildup insulates the probe from the medium, it will stop working properly. A simple inspection of the probe will require an ohmmeter connected across the suspect probe and the ground reference.|$|E

40|$|Detection of non-Maxwellian {{electron}} energy distribution functions (EEDFs) by Langmuir probes {{in the presence}} of radiofrequency (RF) fluctuations in plasma potential is possible if the probe is properly RF-compensated.

Additionally, in most cases, the patients are told to remove the protective glasses because of their large size. Furthermore, the normal Bell’s phenomenon causes the pigmented iris to be damaged by the peripheral laser beams. The thin skin of the eyelids fails to prevent the penetration of the laser beams to the eye; thus, a variety of clinical presentations can occur with laser epilation of eyebrows. Lin et al. and Carrim et al. reported patients with pigment dispersion and temporary increased intraocular pressure associated with alexandrite laser epilation of eyebrows [7, 8]. Elkin et al. described a 41 -year-old male who presented with bilateral iritis and iris atrophy without posterior synechiae 2 days after receiving alexandrite laser epilation of eyebrows [9].

40|$|ABSTRACT: We {{describe}} a microfluidic Western blot assay (μWestern) using a Tris tricine discontinuous buffer system suitable for analyses {{of a wide}} molecular mass range (6. 5 − 116 kDa). The Tris tricine μWestern is completed in an enclosed, straight glass microfluidic channel housing a photopatterned polyacrylamide gel that incorporates a photoactive benzophe-none methacrylamide monomer. Upon brief ultraviolet (UV) light exposure, the hydrogel toggles from molecular sieving for size-based separation to a covalent immobilization scaffold for in situ antibody probing. Electrophoresis controls all assay stages, affording purely electronic operation with no pumps or valves needed for fluid control. Electrophoretic introduction of antibody into and along the molecular sieving gel requires that <b>the</b> <b>probe</b> <b>must</b> traverse through (i) a discontinuous gel interface central to the transient isotachophoresis used to achieve high-performance separations and (ii) the full axial length of the separation gel.

40|$|In {{order to}} {{perceive}} stereoscopic depth, the visual system must define binocular disparities. Consider an oblique line seen through an aperture formed by flanking occluders. Because {{the line is}} perceived behind the aperture, the line must have disparity relative to the aperture. What is the assigned disparity of the line in this aperture problem? To answer this question five observers adjusted the horizontal disparity of a probe until it was perceived at the same depth as the disparate line behind the aperture. The results show that, when both the horizontal and the vertical disparities of the occluders are well-defined, <b>the</b> <b>probe</b> <b>must</b> have the same horizontal disparity as the horizontal separation between the line half-images.

40|$|Using a {{conventional}} {{transmission electron microscope}} that incorporates a field emission gun {{it is possible to}} focus an electron beam to form a small probe (< 1 nm full-width at half-maximum).

30|$|Other tumor {{characteristics}} {{will also}} affect quantifications of tracer uptakes. This is illustrated with the FaDu xenografts imaged here. Here, uptakes of the targeting tracer were low (consistent with low expression levels) but were also visibly intra- and inter-tumorally heterogeneous. The uptake heterogeneity was {{inconsistent with the}} fairly homogenous EGFR expressions shown by the ex vivo IHC but could {{be consistent with the}} prominent hypoxia levels detected (Fig.  4). Many experimental tumors grow rapidly and quickly become hypoxic. Vessels in hypoxic regions collapse due to increasing pressure in growing tumors. A probe’s targeting ability in vivo will thus be affected, since the number of functional vessels delivering the probe has decreased and the distance <b>the</b> <b>probe</b> <b>must</b> penetrate to target the cells has increased [32]. Penetrability is expected to decrease as the size of the probe increases, but these factors affect even the distribution of small (≤ 0.5  kDa) molecules. Although high uptakes of Affibody molecules have been obtained in tumors due to a favorable balance between their high affinity and smaller size compared to antibodies and fragments, [33] hypoxia and collapse of vessels due to increasing pressure would clearly contribute to a disparity between the total receptor levels and those measured by the in vivo imaging tracers.|$|E

5000|$|Positron {{emission}} tomography (PET) is a nuclear medicine imaging technique which produces a three-dimensional image or picture of functional {{processes in the}} body.
