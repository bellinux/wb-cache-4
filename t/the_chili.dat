5|$|Following a {{life-threatening}} drug addiction that developed after leaving <b>the</b> <b>Chili</b> Peppers in 1992, Frusciante made {{a full recovery}} after a month of drug rehabilitation during {{the early months of}} 1998. Shortly thereafter he was asked to rejoin the Red Hot Chili Peppers. After several months of writing and recording, <b>the</b> <b>Chili</b> Peppers' next album, Californication was released. The album went on to sell more than 15 million copies worldwide, becoming <b>the</b> <b>Chili</b> Peppers' most successful recording to date. Frusciante's return generated much response from critics, who recognized the album as a commercial revitalization from their previous record, One Hot Minute. A two-year-long, international tour followed, which included several festival appearances, including Woodstock 1999 and Rock in Rio.|$|E

5|$|At {{the age of}} eighteen, {{he joined}} the Red Hot Chili Peppers, first {{appearing}} on the band's 1989 album, Mother's Milk. The group's follow-up album, Blood Sugar Sex Magik (1991), was a breakthrough success. Frusciante became overwhelmed by the band's new popularity and quit in 1992. He became a recluse and entered {{a long period of}} drug addiction, during which he released his first solo recordings: Niandra Lades and Usually Just a T-Shirt (1994) and Smile from the Streets You Hold (1997). In 1998, he successfully completed drug rehabilitation and rejoined the Red Hot Chili Peppers. Their next album, Californication (1999) would eventually go on to sell 16 million copies. His album To Record Only Water for Ten Days was released in 2001. A fourth album with <b>the</b> <b>Chili</b> Peppers, By the Way was released in 2002. On a creative spree, Frusciante released six solo albums in 2004; each album explored different recording techniques and genres. 2006 saw the release of his fifth and final album with <b>the</b> <b>Chili</b> Peppers, Stadium Arcadium. In 2009, Frusciante released The Empyrean, which features Flea and Josh Klinghoffer, and announced he had again parted ways with <b>the</b> <b>Chili</b> Peppers.|$|E

5|$|Frusciante, Kiedis, and Flea {{each had}} their own {{separate}} rooms {{at each end of}} the house. When not recording with the band, Frusciante would spend his time painting, listening to music, reading and recording songs he'd written. Due to the seclusion, Kiedis ended up recording all his vocals in his room, as it was large enough to accommodate the recording equipment. For over thirty days, <b>the</b> <b>Chili</b> Peppers worked inside the house; Kiedis felt it was an accommodating and resourceful environment which allowed him to complete the rest of the lyrics. During production, the band agreed to let Flea's brother-in-law document the creative process on film. When the album's recording was complete, <b>the</b> <b>Chili</b> Peppers released the film, titled Funky Monks.|$|E
5|$|Blood Sugar Sex Magik is {{the fifth}} studio album by American rock band Red Hot Chili Peppers, {{released}} on September 24, 1991. Produced by Rick Rubin, it was the band's first record released on Warner Bros. Records. The musical styles of Blood Sugar Sex Magik differed notably from the techniques employed on <b>the</b> <b>Chili</b> Peppers' preceding album, Mother's Milk, and featured little use of heavy metal guitar riffs. The album's subject matter incorporated sexual innuendos and references to drugs and death as well as themes of lust and exuberance.|$|E
5|$|Blood Sugar Sex Magik {{was written}} {{at a more}} rapid pace than the band's {{previous}} album. Prior to <b>the</b> <b>Chili</b> Peppers relocation into the mansion, Frusciante and Kiedis collaborated at each other's homes, in order to arrange song structures and guitar riffs. They would then present ideas to Flea and Smith, and the band would, as a whole, decide what they would use for the bass, guitar, vocal and percussion ensembles.|$|E
50|$|The song is also {{notable for}} {{its lack of}} backing vocals, which are on almost all of <b>the</b> <b>Chili's</b> songs on this album.|$|R

5|$|Niandra LaDes and Usually Just a T-Shirt {{incorporated}} Frusciante's avant-garde {{style of}} song composition, with his stream-of-consciousness methodology. He recorded, mixed, produced and mastered the entire record by himself, and released it on Rick Rubin's label, American Recordings. Warner Bros., <b>the</b> <b>Chili</b> Peppers' label, originally held {{the rights to}} the album because of the leaving-artist clause in Frusciante's Chili Peppers contract. Because he was living as a recluse, however, the label gladly handed the rights over to Rubin, who released the album under his label.|$|E
5|$|After {{resuming}} production, Navarro {{questioned the}} methods of <b>the</b> <b>Chili</b> Peppers' recording procedures. He wondered why such {{a considerable amount of}} jamming was involved with the album's conception. Various qualms followed, and the process soon became uncomfortable for the band. Months went by, and only small amounts of material were written. Kiedis made a trip to Grand Rapids, Michigan in December, where his family realized he'd resumed an active addiction once again. He returned to Hollywood in late January 1995, when he finally finished recording his vocals. The rest of the recording was completed within the next month.|$|E
5|$|At {{this point}} in 1998, Kiedis and Flea {{decided it was time}} to fire their guitarist. Navarro was furious when confronted by Kiedis and Flea, but {{eventually}} accepted his termination. <b>The</b> <b>Chili</b> Peppers were fighting, and on the verge of breaking up. Flea was beginning to question the band's future and thought it may be necessary to break the band up. He made one last attempt to keep the band together, asking Frusciante to rejoin. Frusciante had recently completed a drug rehabilitation program after more than five years of heroin addiction, and gladly accepted the invitation.|$|E

5|$|During the Californication world tour, Frusciante {{continued}} to compose his own songs, {{many of which}} would be released in 2001 on his third solo album To Record Only Water for Ten Days. The album was stylistically unlike his previous records, less markedly stream-of-consciousness or avant-garde. However, the lyrics were still very cryptic and its sound was notably stripped down. The songwriting and production of To Record Only Water for Ten Days were more efficient and straightforward than on his previous recordings. The album strayed from the alternative rock he had just written with <b>the</b> <b>Chili</b> Peppers on Californication, focusing more on electronic and new wave elements. In addition to his guitar work, Frusciante experimented with a variety of synthesizers, a distinctive feature of the record.|$|E
5|$|NY386 {{begins at}} a {{three-way}} intersection with NY383 {{on the west}} side of the village of Scottsville. From this junction, NY383 heads south and east while NY386 takes the west exit, passing under the Rochester and Southern Railroad and turning to the northwest as it encircles the village. At North Road, which acts as a westward extension of NY253, NY386 passes the middle and high schools of the Wheatland–Chili Central School District and becomes Scottsville–Chili Road. The route continues onward, leaving Scottsville and entering an open, rural area of the town of Wheatland. NY386 remains on a northwesterly track to <b>the</b> <b>Chili</b> town line, where it curves to the north as it approaches and crosses over the New York State Thruway (I-90).|$|E
5|$|Now in {{the town}} of Riga, NY33A becomes Chili–Riga Center Road as it {{traverses}} a largely rural portion of southwestern Monroe County. In the small hamlet of Riga, the route intersects and briefly overlaps with NY36. East of Riga hamlet, NY33A heads generally northeastward, passing by Black Creek Park as it enters the town of Chili. Just west of the hamlet of West Chili, the route crosses over Black Creek and intersects Chili Avenue Extension. At this junction, NY33A becomes Chili Avenue, the name it retains into the city of Rochester. Locally, <b>the</b> <b>Chili</b> Avenue name is used more in common parlance than the NY33A designation.|$|E

On February 25, 2011, it was {{displaced}} by the Naga Viper pepper, which registered 1,382,118 SHU.|$|R
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Chili</b> Peppers {{collaborated with}} {{producer}} Rick Rubin for their second record with Frusciante, Blood Sugar Sex Magik. Rubin {{felt that it}} was important to record the album in an unorthodox setting, so he suggested an old Hollywood Hills mansion, and the band agreed. Frusciante, Kiedis and Flea isolated themselves there for the duration of the recording. Frusciante and Flea seldom went outside, and spent most of their time smoking marijuana. Around this time, Frusciante started a side collaboration with Flea and Jane's Addiction drummer Stephen Perkins called The Three Amoebas. They recorded roughly ten to fifteen hours of material, none of which has ever been released.|$|E
5|$|Now {{settled into}} Warner Bros. Records, <b>the</b> <b>Chili</b> Peppers {{began looking for}} a {{suitable}} producer. One person in particular, Rick Rubin, stood out, as he was more broadminded in contrast to individuals they had worked with in the past even though Rubin previously turned down the band's offer to produce their 1987 album The Uplift Mofo Party Plan due to the drug problems of Kiedis and guitarist Hillel Slovak who would die of a heroin overdose a year later. Eventually, the band decided Rubin {{would be the best}} choice as a producer, and therefore hired him to produce what would become Blood Sugar Sex Magik. Unlike the Peppers' previous producers, Rubin was someone that they felt confident to ask for guidance and input during times of difficulty. He would often help arrange drum beats, guitar melodies and lyrics.|$|E
5|$|Months went {{by without}} any {{scheduled}} concerts {{due to the}} album's poor sales. Following another relapse and a stint in rehab, Kiedis {{and the rest of}} the band prepared for a summer tour, their first in almost seven months. Before the tour could begin, Kiedis had an accident on his motorcycle and was rushed to the hospital after severely injuring his hand. Due to his drug addiction, it took seven doses of morphine before the pain was assuaged. Following discharge from the hospital, he was forced to wear a full-arm cast for several months, resulting in the cancellation of all remaining scheduled concerts. Halfway through Kiedis's recovery, the band was asked to play the Fuji Rock Festival in July 1997. By that time, Kiedis's cast had receded down to the elbow and he felt well enough to play. A large typhoon had been forecast to hit the festival several hours before the show. The concert took place anyway, and when <b>the</b> <b>Chili</b> Peppers got on stage to play, the audience was being soaked in torrential rains, and the band found it virtually impossible to play their instruments. After eight songs, the lighting and sound equipment was torn from the stage and the band was obliged to an impromptu finish.|$|E
50|$|In late 2007, <b>the</b> <b>Chili's</b> Care Center {{opened on}} the St. Jude campus.
