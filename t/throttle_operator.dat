2500|$|The 21st {{century has}} seen a new {{approach}} to jet packs where water is used as a high-density propulsion fluid. [...] This requires a very large mass of fluid that makes a self-contained jetpack infeasible. [...] Instead, this approach separates the engine, fuel and fluid supply from the pilot's flying apparatus, using a long flexible hose to feed the water to the jet nozzle pack attached to the pilot's body. [...] These inventions are known as [...] "hydro jet packs", and successful designs have used jetski technology as the powerplant operating in a body of water (an ocean, lake, or [...] pool) to provide the needed propulsion. Several hydro jet pack approaches have been successfully tested and put into production. Flow rate can be controlled by a <b>throttle</b> <b>operator</b> on the jetski, or by the pilot using a remote actuator.|$|E
25|$|In PWRs reactor {{power can}} be viewed as {{following}} steam (turbine) demand due to the reactivity feedback of the temperature change caused by increased or decreased steam flow. (See: Negative temperature coefficient.) Boron and control rods are used to maintain primary system temperature at the desired point. In order to decrease power, the <b>operator</b> <b>throttles</b> shut turbine inlet valves. This would result in less steam being drawn from the steam generators. This results in the primary loop increasing in temperature. The higher temperature causes the density of the primary reactor coolant water to decrease, allowing higher neutron speeds, thus less fission and decreased power output. This decrease of power will eventually result in primary system temperature returning to its previous steady-state value. The operator can control the steady state operating temperature by addition of boric acid and/or movement of control rods.|$|R
50|$|Originally {{constructed}} {{of wood and}} since 1967 {{constructed of}} steel, the barge-like vessel features the controllman's room to one side, with the diesel engine sitting aside the control room. As a powered cable ferry, the vessel is guided by a steel cable drawn across the river, secured on each shore by steel anchors. The cable is lowered into the river when the ferry is not operational and is stretched across the river during hours of operation. There is sufficient clearance for small boats to pass under the cable, but it is lowered when barges pass, though barge traffic on the Cape Fear river in this section ceased in the 1990s. The ferry {{is powered by a}} diesel engine and a propeller. Stopping is controlled by the <b>operator's</b> <b>throttle.</b> As the ferry cannot turn around, each end includes a ramp, and alignment of the ferry at each end is automatic.|$|R
40|$|Dropping tuples {{has been}} {{commonly}} used for load shedding. However, tuple dropping generally is inadequate to shed load for multiway windowed stream joins. The output rate can be unnecessarily and severely degraded because tuple dropping {{does not recognize}} time correlations likely to exist among the streams. This paper introduces GrubJoin: an adaptive multi-way windowed stream join that efficiently performs time correlation-aware CPU load shedding. GrubJoin maximizes the output rate by achieving nearoptimal window harvesting within an <b>operator</b> <b>throttling</b> framework, i. e., regulating the fractions of the join windows that are processed by the multi-way join. Window harvesting performs the join using only certain more useful segments of the join windows. Due mainly to the combinatorial explosion of possible multi-way join sequences involving various segments of individual join windows, GrubJoin faces a set of unique challenges, such as determining the optimal window harvesting configuration and learning the time correlations among the streams. To tackle these challenges, we formalize window harvesting as an optimization problem, develop greedy heuristics to determine near-optimal window harvesting configurations and use approximation techniques to capture the time correlations among the streams. Experimental results show that GrubJoin is vastly superior to tuple dropping when time correlations exist among the streams and is equally effective as tuple dropping {{in the absence of}} time correlations...|$|R
50|$|The pedal furthest to {{the right}} is the foot throttle. Unlike in automobiles, {{it can also be}} {{controlled}} from a hand-operated lever ("hand throttle"). This helps provide a constant speed in field work. It also helps provide continuous power for stationary tractors that are operating an implement by shaft or belt. The foot <b>throttle</b> gives the <b>operator</b> more automobile-like control over the speed of the tractor for road work. This is a feature of more recent tractors; older tractors often did not have it. In the UK, foot pedal use to control engine speed while travelling on the road is mandatory. Some tractors, especially those designed for row-crop work, have a 'de-accelerator' pedal, which operates in the reverse fashion to an automobile throttle, in that the pedal is pushed down to slow the engine. This allows fine control over the speed of the tractor when maneuvering at the end of crop rows in fields- the operating speed of the engine is set using the hand throttle, and to slow the tractor to turn, the operator simply has to press the pedal, and turn and release it once the turn is completed, rather than having to alter the setting of the hand throttle twice during the maneuver.|$|R
