40|$|Two {{distinct}} <b>types</b> <b>of</b> ports handle French deep-sea cargo: global {{ports of}} Northern Range and Marseilles serve {{a great number}} of overseas regions (forelands) and secondary ports mainly serve niche markets. In this paper we demonstrate that global ports serve also larger hinterlands, but their superiority over secondary ports depends on the <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>cargo</b> handled. The results of a spatial interaction model demonstrate that most <b>of</b> <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>cargo</b> flows are strongly distance-constrained. This evidence indicates that, despite a deep transformation on forelands, the secondary ports subsist because they partly depend on niche markets and local economies generating substantial amounts <b>of</b> non-containerised <b>cargo</b> flows. Some implications of this finding are suggested...|$|R

40|$|Abstractâ€”Non-line-of-sight (NLoS) {{maritime}} mobile {{radio channel}} in 5 GHz band is experimentally investigated {{in this paper}} through wideband channel soundings.

Different <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>cargo</b> ships anchored off the east coast of Singapore were examined as obstructions for the NLoS propagations. Besides power delay profile (PDP), stand-off distance is introduced in this work to analyze the NLoS propagations associated with three different <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>cargo</b> ships. The measured PDPs and stand-off distances are found to be comparable qualitatively with the simulated results using 3 -D ray tracing.
