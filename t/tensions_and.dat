5|$|Because of its {{multitude}} of diverse, sometimes competing ethno-linguistic groups, Nigeria prior to independence {{was faced with}} sectarian <b>tensions</b> <b>and</b> violence, particularly in the oil-producing Niger Delta region, where both state and civilian forces employ varying methods of coercion in attempts gain control over regional petroleum resources. Some of the ethnic groups like the Ogoni, have experienced severe environmental degradation due to petroleum extraction.|$|E
5|$|Jews were a {{significant}} {{minority in the}} Byzantine state throughout its history, and, according to Roman law, they constituted a legally recognised religious group. In the early Byzantine period they were generally tolerated, but then periods of <b>tensions</b> <b>and</b> persecutions ensued. In any case, after the Arab conquests, the majority of Jews found themselves outside the Empire; those left inside the Byzantine borders apparently lived in relative peace from the 10th century onwards.|$|E
40|$|Markets {{exist within}} {{a world of}} {{constant}} exchanges which {{form the basis for}} changes and the creation of new markets. Therefore, it is important to research these exchanges. One of the areas in which market creation can be observed is interorganisational collaborations, as firms increasingly collaborate to create markets. In market creation practice, however, interorganisational <b>tension</b> <b>and</b> conflict can form from divergent approaches and vested interests of the partners. Interorganisational tension represents the opposing intentions of interorganisational forces, and conflict is generated through disagreements. The aim of this research is to investigate interorganisational <b>tension</b> <b>and</b> conflict on market creation practice. Specifically, it attempts to: (i) expand interorganisational <b>tension</b> <b>and</b> conflict and provide insights to these concepts, as well as establishing a two-dimensional interorganisational <b>tension</b> (productive <b>and</b> unproductive) understanding, (ii) explore the interactions between interorganisational <b>tension</b> <b>and</b> conflict, (iii) develop a conceptual framework that explains the level of market creation depending on the effects of interorganisational <b>tension</b> <b>and</b> conflict, (iv) develop a typology of partnering firms based on interorganisational <b>tension</b> <b>and</b> conflict practice. To achieve this aim, and to respond to the research calls, this study follows a grounded theory approach which intends to expand the understanding of interorganisational <b>tension</b> <b>and</b> conflict. According to the findings, a major characteristic of interorganisational tension is its two dimensions: productive and unproductive. However, it is the intertwined nature of <b>tension</b> <b>and</b> conflict that influences market creation. Fundamental to these are the six interorganisational <b>tension</b> <b>and</b> three conflict types revealed by the findings of this study. The core theoretical contributions of the study are a dynamic framework that portrays the dynamic interactions between interorganisational <b>tension</b> <b>and</b> conflict on market creation practice, and a typology of market-creating partnering firms. Collectively, they explicate the development of market creation practice, and firms’ reactions to interorganisational <b>tension</b> <b>and</b> conflict...|$|R

40|$|We {{study the}} {{influence}} that image features may have on music <b>tension</b> <b>and</b> liveliness perception. 72 music excerpts from different genres and periods were selected, and 72 still shots were taken from different animation features little known to the subjects. 62 subjects rated the isolated images for <b>tension</b> <b>and</b> liveliness, 37 subjects rated the isolated music excerpts for <b>tension</b> <b>and</b> liveliness, and 153 subjects rated the music excerpts combined with the images for music <b>tension</b> <b>and</b> liveliness, and for music-image congruence. There is a significant variation of <b>tension</b> <b>and</b> liveliness of the music {{as a function of}} the <b>tension</b> <b>and</b> liveliness of the pairing image, showing a transfer of mood from image to music. The significance of ANOVA tests showed that 40 % of music excerpts were image-sensitive for liveliness and 32 % for tension. The transfer of mood was dependent on congruence: music excerpts with high congruence with the image had a higher correlation in <b>tension</b> <b>and</b> liveliness rating deviations with the image ratings. For low congruence, the liveliness correlation was not significant <b>and</b> the <b>tension</b> deviation was negatively correlated with the image tension. Feature transfer from image to music depends on the image-music congruence rated by each subject...|$|R

5|$|As a {{spin-off}} {{from the}} Rudolphine Tables {{and the related}} Ephemerides, Kepler published astrological calendars, which were very popular and helped offset the costs of producing his other work—especially when support from the Imperial treasury was withheld. In his calendars—six between 1617 and 1624—Kepler forecast planetary positions and weather {{as well as political}} events; the latter were often cannily accurate, thanks to his keen grasp of contemporary political and theological tensions. By 1624, however, the escalation of those <b>tensions</b> <b>and</b> the ambiguity of the prophecies meant political trouble for Kepler himself; his final calendar was publicly burned in Graz.|$|E
5|$|In November 2011, {{a lock of}} John Paul II's {{hair was}} brought to the cathedral after the Holy See granted the Diocese of Hong Kong a relic from the late pontiff. The diocese had earlier {{requested}} this, since they felt this would symbolically accomplish the Pope's longtime dream of visiting China. He had constantly stated his intent of visiting the country, but never did so due to the longstanding <b>tensions</b> <b>and</b> strained relations between China and the Holy See. Bishop John Tong Hon expressed his hope that the relic would be able to venerated by the Mainland Chinese faithful who visited Hong Kong, the only city on Chinese soil and the first city in Asia to house a relic of John Paul II.

40|$|<b>Tension</b> <b>and</b> {{suspense}} {{are powerful}} emotional experiences {{that occur in}} a wide variety of contexts (e. g., in music, film, literature, and everyday life). The omnipresence of <b>tension</b> <b>and</b> suspense suggests that they build on very basic cognitive and affective mechanisms. However, the psychological underpinnings of tension experiences remain largely unexplained, <b>and</b> <b>tension</b> <b>and</b> suspense are rarely discussed from a general, domain-independent perspective. In this paper, we argue that tension experiences in different contexts (e. g., musical tension or suspense in a movie) build on the same underlying psychological processes. We discuss key components of <b>tension</b> experiences <b>and</b> propose a domain-independent model of <b>tension</b> <b>and</b> suspense. According to this model, tension experiences originate from states of conflict, instability, dissonance, or uncertainty that trigger predictive processes directed at future events of emotional significance. We also discuss possible neural mechanisms underlying <b>tension</b> <b>and</b> suspense. The model provides a theoretical framework that can inform future empirical research on tension phenomena...|$|R

5|$|Indeed, {{this period}} in Greek history is {{remarkable}} {{for the social}} and political upheaval in many Greek cities, particularly the establishment of the first democracy in Athens. The island of Naxos, part of the Cyclades group in the Aegean Sea, was also in this period affected by political turmoil. Naxos had been ruled by the tyrant Lygdamis, a protege of the Athenian tyrant Peisistratos, until around 524 BC, when he was overthrown by the Spartans. After this, a native aristocracy seems to have flourished, and Naxos {{became one of the most}} prosperous and powerful of the Aegean islands. Despite its success, Naxos was not immune to class <b>tensions</b> <b>and</b> internal strife, and shortly before 500 BC, the population seized power, expelling the aristocrats and establishing a democracy.|$|E

In 1598 Sigismund attempted to resolve the matter militarily, but the expedition to the country of his origin was defeated at the Battle of Linköping; Sigismund was taken prisoner and had to agree to the harsh conditions imposed. After his return to Poland, in 1599 the Riksdag of the Estates deposed him in Sweden, and Charles led the Swedish forces into Estonia. Sigismund in 1600 proclaimed the incorporation of Estonia into the Commonwealth, which was tantamount to a declaration of war on Sweden, at the height of Rzeczpospolita's involvement in Moldavia region.|$|E
40|$|Abstract.

5|$|The Rock Springs massacre, {{also known}} as the Rock Springs Riot, {{occurred}} on September 2, 1885, in the present-day United States city of Rock Springs in Sweetwater County, Wyoming. The riot, between Chinese immigrant miners and white immigrant miners, was the result of racial <b>tensions</b> <b>and</b> an ongoing labor dispute over the Union Pacific Coal Department's policy of paying Chinese miners lower wages than white miners. This policy caused the Chinese to be hired over the white miners, which further angered the white miners and contributed to the riot. When the rioting ended, at least 28 Chinese miners were dead and 15 were injured. Rioters burned 78 Chinese homes resulting in approximately US$150,000 in property damage ($ in present-day terms).|$|E

5|$|As with {{previous}} Fire Emblem games, Path of Radiance {{takes place in}} a continuity and setting separate {{from the rest of the}} series. The game's setting is the continent of Tellius, inhabited by two species: the humanoid Beorc, and the shape-shifting Laguz. According to legend, the goddess who made the world created Beorc in her image, and created the Laguz to fill the gap between herself and beasts. The two races have struggled to coexist, leading to racial <b>tensions</b> <b>and</b> conflict on both sides. By the events of Path of Radiance, Tellius is divided into seven nations which remain at peace. A key item in Tellius is Lehran's Medallion, the world's incarnation of the recurring Fire Emblem.

After Nicholas II was deposed in early 1917, {{many members of}} the Romanov dynasty, including Nicholas and his immediate family, were held under house arrest. The new government retired Kulikovsky from the army with the rank of lieutenant-colonel. Dowager Empress Marie, Grand Duke Alexander, Grand Duchess Olga, and Kulikovsky managed to escape to the Crimea where they lived for a time before they too were placed under house arrest at one of the imperial estates. As a commoner, Kulikovsky was permitted more freedom of movement than the Romanovs, and was occasionally able to leave the estate in a pony-cart, which allowed him to run errands, obtain food, and seek news of the outside. On 12 August 1917, Olga and Kulikovsky's first child and son, Tikhon, was born in the Crimea. He was named after one of the Grand Duchess's favorite saints, Tikhon of Zadonsk. Although the grandson of an emperor and the nephew of another, Tikhon received no titles because his father was a commoner.|$|E
