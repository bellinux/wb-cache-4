40|$|In {{continuous}} casting process, liquid steel {{flows through the}} tundish, {{which is supposed to}} operate as a continuous refining finisher. To provide a functionality of such a device, a pack of <b>tundish</b> <b>metallurgy</b> techniques must be applied, whose efficiency is conditioned especially with optimal symmetrical and dynamical melt flow. Flow optimizing can be achieved through the shaping of inside tundish configuration, using flow control devices such as turbulence inhibitors, impact pads, baffles, weirs, dams, etc. The theme of the present paper is the precise employment of a turbulence inhibitor, commercially known as TURBOSTOP(TM), together with a pair of baffles & a flat impact pad in slab custer to improve steel cleanliness and a fluid flow phenomenon in a two strands tundish...|$|E
