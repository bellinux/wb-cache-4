2500|$|Porsche also {{developed}} the car's aerodynamics, which {{were designed to}} increase stability, as was the automatic ride-height adjustment that became available on the road car (961 race cars had fixed suspensions). Its [...] "zero lift" [...] aerodynamics were {{a big part of}} keeping it drivable. The 959 also featured Porsche-Steuer Kupplung (PSK) which was at the time the most advanced all-wheel-drive system in a production car. Capable of dynamically changing the torque distribution between the rear and front wheels in both normal and slip conditions, the PSK system gave the 959 the adaptability it needed both as a race car and as a [...] "super" [...] street car. Under hard acceleration, PSK could send as much as 80% of available power to the rear wheels, helping {{make the most of the}} rear-traction bias that occurs at such times. It could also vary the power bias depending on road surface and grip changes, helping maintain traction at all times. The dashboard featured gauges displaying the amount of rear differential slip as well as transmitted power to the front axle.

50|$|Direct TPMS, {{or direct}} <b>tire</b> <b>{{pressure}}</b> <b>monitoring</b> <b>systems</b> (direct sensor TPMS) {{refers to the}} use of a pressure sensor directly mounted on the wheels or tires of a vehicle.

50|$|A {{much more}} active {{approach}} to <b>monitoring</b> <b>tire</b> <b>pressures</b> involves retrofitting a <b>tire</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>monitor</b> to your vehicle. Vehicles manufactured after model year 2007 {{are required to}} have <b>tire</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>monitoring</b> <b>systems</b> built-in, although many older vehicles might not have it. Tire rack, for example, offers aftermarket <b>tire</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>monitors</b> from various companies, including one that notifies {{the driver of the}} <b>tire</b> <b>pressure</b> in each wheel, as well as exactly which tire the system is displaying the pressure of. A much less expensive way to <b>monitor</b> <b>tire</b> <b>pressures</b> is to install valve stem caps that alert the driver to low <b>tire</b> <b>pressure.</b> These work by first setting the pressure on the cap matching the pressure you desire your tires to be at. Once installed on the tire's valve stem, the tip of these caps will change color (from green, to yellow, to red) when the tire becomes under-inflated. The benefit of this system is its low initial cost, but its disadvantages include questionable accuracy (even more so if the caps aren't tightened down enough) and {{that the only way to}} monitor them is from outside of the vehicle, looking directly at the cap. It's always a good idea to have a quality, reliable tire gauge on hand regardless of what system is installed in your vehicle, and to either check <b>tire</b> <b>pressures</b> yourself of by having someone else do it, as most <b>tire</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>monitor</b> <b>systems</b> will not alert the driver until the <b>tire</b> <b>pressure</b> falls below a certain amount, usually 20% below the recommended pressure.|$|R
