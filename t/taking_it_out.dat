5|$|At the department, with April {{absent from}} work, Ron asks Andy {{to fill in}} as an {{assistant}} because the anti-government oriented Ron believes Andy will be ineffective. The two bond {{over the course of}} the day, and Andy begins to tell Ron about his problems with April, for whom he still harbors romantic feelings. Although initially not wishing to get involved, Ron reluctantly tells Andy she is at the hospital and he should visit her. Meanwhile, Ann remains pleasant throughout her nursing shift despite April's constant abuse. The second her shift ends, however, Ann immediately loses her temper and curses at April. Ann apologizes for kissing Andy, but insists it was a mistake and that April should stop <b>taking</b> <b>it</b> <b>out</b> on Andy. Later, Andy visits April, who pretends to be asleep but smiles, revealing she is happy he came.|$|E

Flying a Sopwith Camel single-seat fighter he was diligent in trench strafing and ground support missions. He also scored nine aerial victories between 9 July and 9 November 1918, just {{before the end of}} hostilities. His most notable wins were on 25 September, when one Fokker D.VII he downed spun into a second, <b>taking</b> <b>it</b> <b>out</b> also; and his triple win on 14 October.

[...] Writing in The Guardians sister paper, The Observer, Maurice Richardson thought that [...] "our Casanovaesque cad-clubman secret agent is mellowing a bit now"; Richardson liked the format, saying that [...] "the short form suits him quite well" [...] although the downside is that [...] "if it checks the wilder fantasies it cuts short the love-affairs". Writing in The Spectator, Cyril Ray (under the pseudonym Christopher Pym) wrote that [...] "each episode of the Bond novels meant the adventure was less probable and more preposterous than the last, and now our hero seems to have lost, as well as any claims to plausibility, the know-how, the know-who, know-what and sheer zing that used to carry the unlikely plots along.

500|$|Due to Santaolalla's {{stance on}} {{composing}} music—he lacks knowledge {{in reading and}} writing sheet music, preferring to simply record—he began working on The Last of Us early in development. To give Santaolalla a point to base his music, Druckmann simply {{told him about the}} story and themes, as opposed to giving specific instructions on composing; Santaolalla appreciated this freedom, feeling it assisted in the composing. To compose, Santaolalla felt the need to [...] "go into some more dark place, more textural and not necessarily melodic". To challenge himself, Santaolalla used a variety of unique instruments he was unfamiliar with, giving a sense of danger and innocence. For The Last of Us, he used a detuned guitar, producing deep noise. To produce unique tunes, Santaolalla recorded in various rooms, including a bathroom and kitchen. The team wanted the game's AI to affect the music. They also tried to make the music evoke a reaction from the player, as their familiarization with the sounds would trigger a previous emotion that they felt. Music manager Jonathan Mayer felt that the game's action music was atypical of action music in other games, stating that it's [...] "relatively low-key", and that <b>taking</b> <b>it</b> <b>out</b> of context changes the immediate reaction to it. The game's theme, [...] "The Last of Us", was the first piece of music that the team received, and they were very impressed.|$|E

[...] On May 23 and 24, Washington and Rochambeau held a conference at Wethersfield, Connecticut where they discussed what steps to take next. [...] They agreed that, pursuant to his orders, Rochambeau would move his army from Newport to the Continental Army camp at White Plains, New York. [...] They also decided to send dispatches to de Grasse outlining two possible courses of action. [...] Washington favored the idea of attacking New York, while Rochambeau favored action in Virginia, where the British were less well established. [...] Washington's letter to de Grasse outlined these two options; Rochambeau, in a private note, informed de Grasse of his preference. [...] Lastly, Rochambeau convinced de Barras to hold his fleet in readiness to assist in either operation, rather than <b>taking</b> <b>it</b> <b>out</b> on expeditions to the north as he had been ordered. [...] The Concorde sailed from Newport on June 20, carrying dispatches from Washington, Rochambeau, and de Barras, as well as the pilots de Grasse had requested. [...] The French army left Newport in June, and joined Washington's army at Dobb's Ferry, New York on July 7. [...] From there, Washington and Rochambeau embarked on an inspection tour of the British defenses around New York while they awaited word from de Grasse.|$|E

2500|$|The case {{also gives}} the {{harpsichord}} its external appearance and protects the instrument. [...] A large harpsichord is, in a sense, {{a piece of}} furniture, as it stands alone on legs and may be styled {{in the manner of}} other furniture of its place and period. [...] Early Italian instruments, on the other hand, were so light in construction that they were treated rather like a violin: kept for storage in a protective outer case, and played after <b>taking</b> <b>it</b> <b>out</b> of its case and placing it on a table. [...] Such tables were often quite high – until the late 18th century people usually played standing up. [...] Eventually, harpsichords came to be built with just a single case, though an intermediate stage also existed: [...] the false inner–outer, which for purely aesthetic reasons was built to look as if the outer case contained an inner one, in the old style. [...] Even after harpsichords became self-encased objects, they often were supported by separate stands, and some modern harpsichords have separate legs for improved portability.|$|E

5000|$|There {{is also a}} schwa secundum (usually, the indogermanicum is unsaid), {{which is}} some kind of reduced state of an {{originally}} short vowel. The reconstruction or reconstructions (two different schwas are commonly deployed) of 6 is only a stopgap. Its supposed reflexes are various and unpredictable, and the occurrence of the vowels has no morphological anchor, unlike the whole rest of the ablaut (vowel alternation) system. In terms of linguistic reconstruction, therefore, it has no explanatory value, being a case of putting the rabbit into the hat for the purpose of <b>taking</b> <b>it</b> back <b>out</b> again. In more technical terms, a schwa secundum in a reconstruction is actually a case of removing an attested mystery into the protolanguage and replacing one mystery by another. Most cases of schwa secundum are not really problems at all, being ordinary cases of levelling, or the phenomena have other and better explanations. For example, the occurrence of -u- in Greek for expected -o-, as in núx [...] "night" [...] and phúllon [...] "leaf" [...] (cf. Latin nox, folium) seems to be regular when the expected o is between a labial and a resonant consonant (núx reflects *nokʷt-s).|$|R

2500|$|The {{first major}} {{independent}} British designer {{in the late}} 1950s and 1960s, Brookes revolutionized the approach to British garden design. Influenced by painters such as Piet Mondrian and Ben Nicholsen, Brookes brought Abstract and Modernist principles to garden design. He pushed the then-revolutionary concept that a garden’s design should hinge first and foremost {{on the needs of}} its occupants, <b>taking</b> <b>it</b> <b>out</b> of the realm of the grand garden traditions which were labor-intensive, expensive, and high maintenance. [...] Early in his career, influenced by modern architecture and art, he developed a methodology called “the Grid.” [...] The Grid methodology projects the vertical lines and dimensions of the architecture of a site onto the horizontal plane of the garden. [...] This methodology, coupled with his conviction that cultural context should dictate the planting, materials, and other aspects of a garden’s structure, comprises an approach to garden design that he has conveyed to hundreds of thousands of readers and taught to thousands of students during his career. [...] He is the author of over two dozen books, including Room Outside and John Brookes, Master Class, that have been translated into several languages and has taught and lectured in venues around the globe, including Iran, Argentina, Japan, Russia, and the US.|$|E
