2500|$|The {{events of}} October 1917 led to Gippius {{severing}} all ties {{with most of}} those who admired her poetry, including Blok, Bryusov and Bely. The history of this schism and the reconstruction of the ideological collisions that made such a catastrophe possible became the subject matter of her memoirs The Living Faces (Живые лица, 1925). While Blok (the man whom she famously refused her hand in 1918) saw the Revolution as a 'purifying storm', Gippius was appalled by the 'suffocating dourness' of the whole thing, seeing it as one huge monstrosity [...] "leaving one with just one wish: to go blind and deaf."

[...] During the time from 1936–1940, Hamilton was successful in getting licensing rights for foreign countries to build Pratt & Whitney engines and Hamilton Standard variable-pitch propellers. [...] According to Wilson, it was a fight for survival as an American company. [...] He also mentioned <b>there</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>kind</b> of naivete {{when it came to}} dealing with countries like Germany, Japan and Russia. [...] For example, a deal was set up with BMW (Bavarian Motor Works) to license them to build a number of Pratt & Whitney engines, which was approved by the United States Congress. [...] This was granted because neither the US businessmen nor governmental officials expected any war in Europe. [...] As Wilson stated, “thanks to Mr. Thomas F. Hamilton moving around through these different ministries, could appraise this situation more clearly than most people. [...] And he came back from one trip and in a meeting of the executive committee of our company he said, ‘Don't discount this fellow Hitler.’ ‘To you, he's got a Charlie Chaplin mustache, but whatever he may look on the outside, either he or somebody behind him has a strategic insight and a political foresight that is not available {{anywhere else in the world}} that I know of’ ”. [...] It has also been suggested that Hamilton also tried to convince the United States Congress of the seriousness of doing business with countries like Germany, Japan and Russia. However, at the time business interests came first and Hamilton was asked to continue in his position until the fall of France in 1940, after which Hamilton and his staff had to make an unorthodox exit out of Europe through Spain.|$|E
