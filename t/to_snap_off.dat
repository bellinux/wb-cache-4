5|$|The guide-wheel, which {{protrudes}} {{just ahead of}} the front wheels, is {{the most important part of}} the bus when travelling on the O-Bahn. It is connected directly to the steering mechanism, and steers the bus by running along the raised edge of the track. While it is not strictly necessary for drivers to hold the steering wheel when travelling on the O-Bahn because of the guide-wheel, safety procedures require the driver to be alert to their circumstances at all times. A rumble strip before stations is a reminder that they need to resume control. The guide-wheel is the most delicate part of the system and is designed <b>to</b> <b>snap</b> <b>off</b> upon sharp impact; before the O-Bahn was in place, a number of buses were fitted with guide-wheels for their ordinary routes to test their durability. Drivers were forced to be more cautious on their normal trips after numerous guide-wheel-to-kerb impacts.|$|E

2500|$|The {{location}} of the accident {{and the fact that}} it took place two months and one day after the September 11 attacks on the World Trade Center in Manhattan initially spawned fears of another terrorist attack. [...] Terrorism was officially ruled out as the cause by the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), which instead attributed the disaster to the first officer's overuse of rudder controls in response to wake turbulence, or jet wash, from a Japan Airlines Boeing 747-400 that took off minutes before it. According to the NTSB, this aggressive use of the rudder controls by the co-pilot caused the vertical stabilizer <b>to</b> <b>snap</b> <b>off</b> the plane. The plane's two engines also separated from the aircraft before it hit the ground.|$|E
50|$|The central directable fascia vents {{could be}} heated and angled, {{so that they}} could be pointed {{directly}} at the windscreen in front of the driver, to keep it clear in extreme misting conditions. There was also an additional mid-level vent. The C15 also had height-adjustable halogen headlights, and multi-speed/intermittent front wipers, which was better than most commercial vehicles of the time. Early models had a single wide rear door, but this was awkward for loading in a tight space and prone to sagging or <b>to</b> <b>snapping</b> <b>off</b> in a high wind, so, after a year or two, only conventional two-door versions were sold with fold-back hinges.|$|R

2500|$|Another weight-saving concept the {{designers}} {{came up with}} was detachable wingtips. The wings were designed to fold at a point about [...] out along the span, reducing the space taken up on the carrier. Normally the hinge system {{would have to be}} built very strong in order to transmit loads from the outer portions of the wing to the main spar in the inner section, which adds considerable weight. Instead of building the entire wing to be able to withstand high-g loads, only the inner portion of the wing was able to do this. The outer portions were more lightly constructed, and designed <b>to</b> <b>snap</b> <b>off</b> at the hinge line if the g-force exceeded 7.5g. In this case the aircraft would still be flyable and could be repaired after returning to the carrier. This saved [...] of weight.|$|E
6000|$|... 'I {{can always}} get away if I choose,' thought he, 'it is {{better not to}} be in a hurry;' so he {{remained}} quite still while the skin was drawn over his head, which made him very hot and uncomfortable, and resisted the temptation <b>to</b> <b>snap</b> <b>off</b> the fingers or noses that were so close to his mouth.|$|E
6000|$|So saying, he leapt on to {{the deck}} of the schooner, and Turnbull's voice was at once heard {{shouting}} the order, [...] "Haul aft the weather sheets of the jibs;" [...] and in a minute the two vessels were gliding away from each other on opposite tacks. Then the Arrow was brought round and followed the Thames, which {{was the name of the}} merchantman. The brigantine was now three quarters of a mile away. Suddenly she was seen to change her course. As she wore round she presented her broadside to the two vessels, and her five guns puffed out together. The reply, both from the merchantman and the Arrow, followed almost simultaneously, and a cheer rang out from both ships as the pirate's bowsprit was seen <b>to</b> <b>snap</b> <b>off.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{growing season}} lasts {{approximately}} 135 days, from early in May {{until late in}} September, but agriculture {{is limited to the}} raising of few vegetables. With the exception of some stunted willows, {{the vast majority of the}} chain is devoid of native trees. On some of the islands, such as Adak and Amaknak, there are a few coniferous trees growing, remnants of the Russian period. While tall trees grow in many cold climates, Aleutian conifers — some estimated to be two hundred years old — rarely reach a height of even 10 ft, and many of them are still less than 5 ft tall. This is because the islands, much like the Falklands and other islands of similar latitudes, experience such strong winds that taller trees are vulnerable <b>to</b> <b>snapping</b> <b>off.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The T"2"/"New" [...] FTA {{also saw}} a number of small, {{internal}} changes in the materials used and methods of assembly. This was largely to make the camera more easily serviced. For example, where some brass screws were used originally, these were replaced with stronger steel screws that were less inclined <b>to</b> strip or <b>snap</b> <b>off</b> when being removed.|$|R
6000|$|He looked {{along the}} airy path he must traverse, {{and then down}} to the deck. His eyes were wide and staring, and he was {{trembling}} violently.

At any moment he was liable <b>to</b> be <b>snapped</b> <b>off</b> the gaff, but he was helpless with fright. Wolf Larsen, walking up and down with Smoke and in conversation, took no more notice of him, though he cried sharply, once, to the man at the wheel: ...|$|R
60|$|It {{became evident}} {{by and by}} that Harry had run in closer than was advisable, for there was a crash and the sloop {{suddenly}} stopped. Almost immediately afterward she lay over with her boom and most of her deck on one side in the water, while the tide, twisting her bows around, threatened to pour into her over the depressed coaming. As she had come up nearly head to wind, her mainsail thrashed furiously, jerking the boom {{up out of the}} sea every now and then and letting it splash in again, while the flapping jib seemed likely <b>to</b> <b>snap</b> <b>off</b> the head of her rattling mast. Loose ropes appeared to be flying everywhere and Frank clung stupidly to the coaming, uncertain what to do. They were aground unfortunately close to the schooner, and, he feared, within sight of the men on board her. Harry's voice, however, roused him to make an effort.|$|E

5000|$|A hot chisel {{is used to}} cut {{metal that}} has been heated in a forge to soften the metal. One type of hot chisel is the hotcut hardy, which is used in an anvil hardy hole with the cutting edge facing up. The hot {{workpiece}} to be cut is placed over the chisel and struck with a hammer. The hammer drives the workpiece into the chisel, which allows it <b>to</b> be <b>snapped</b> <b>off</b> {{with a pair of}} tongs.

60|$|But this felicitous {{state of}} things did not last. The tropics were reached, where calms prevailed with {{roasting}} heat. The Southern Atlantic was gained, and gales were met with.

50|$|On September 22, 1909, (several {{newspapers}} {{report the}} date as Tuesday, September 21, 1909) Fung {{was the first}} Chinese man known to fly in America (and first aviator of any nationality to fly in California and the West Coast of the United States). He had constructed his own biplane, improving on the Wrights' blueprints. Fung flew in a wide circle, despite the harsh winds; after twenty minutes, however, the bolt holding the propeller <b>to</b> the shaft <b>snapped</b> <b>off,</b> and he was brought to a stop, suffering only minor bruising.

With 10 seconds left and the clock running, Kanell tried to hurry the offense to the line to spike ball, but time ran out before he was able <b>to</b> get the <b>snap</b> <b>off</b> and the Seminoles had to settle for a moral victory.|$|R

5|$|During {{a couple}} of the Svea flights, Andrée tested and tried out the drag-rope {{steering}} technique which he had developed and wanted to use on his projected North Pole expedition. Drag ropes, which hang from the balloon basket and drag part of their length on the ground, are designed to counteract the tendency of lighter-than-air craft to travel at the same speed as the wind, a situation that makes steering by sails impossible. The friction of the ropes was intended to slow the balloon {{to the point where the}} sails would have an effect (beyond that of making the balloon rotate on its axis). Andrée reported, and presumably believed, that with drag rope/sails steering he had succeeded in deviating about ten degrees either way from the wind direction. This notion is rejected by modern balloonists; the Swedish Ballooning Association maintains that Andrée's belief that he had deviated from the wind was mistaken, being misled by inexpertise and a surfeit of enthusiasm in an environment of variable winds and poor visibility. Use of drag ropes (prone <b>to</b> <b>snapping,</b> falling <b>off,</b> or becoming entangled with each other or the ground, in addition to being ineffective) is not considered by any modern expert to be a useful steering technique.|$|R

50|$|The {{reproduction}} figures {{themselves had}} quality control issues, {{it was not}} uncommon for these figures to have , and the vinyl used for the hands was of a harder nature than the original, causing fingers <b>to</b> <b>snap</b> <b>off</b> on occasion. Since this was never intended to be sold as a toy for young children (as were the original 1960s figures), it is quite likely that many damaged figures were never removed from the packaging. The figure was a little shorter overall than the original 1960s figure, and all the limbs, torso & pelvis were just very slightly different from the original dolls. This reproduction figure became the basis for the Hasbro G.I. Joe: Timeless Collection series, which had a less pink and shiny skin tone, and a revised knee pivot that prevented the calf from forward over-extension. The trademarking is in the same location as the vintage figure.|$|E
