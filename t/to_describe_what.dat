5|$|Macedonism (Македонизъм) is the {{political}} ideology or simply views that the Slavs of Macedonia are an ethnic group separate from Bulgarians, with their own separate language, history and culture. It is also used <b>to</b> <b>describe</b> <b>what</b> Bulgarians view as the falsification of their history whether by Macedonian or foreign scholars who subscribe to the Macedonist point of view. It carries strong negative connotations.|$|E
5|$|Walter Pitts and Warren McCulloch {{analyzed}} {{networks of}} idealized artificial neurons and showed {{how they might}} perform simple logical functions. They were the first <b>to</b> <b>describe</b> <b>what</b> later researchers would call a neural network. One of the students inspired by Pitts and McCulloch was a young Marvin Minsky, then a 24-year-old graduate student. In 1951 (with Dean Edmonds) he built the first neural net machine, the SNARC.|$|E
5|$|Neither {{had much}} money, so they {{determined}} to fund themselves by collecting and selling fine specimens {{of birds and}} insects. Both made extensive travels — {{in different parts of}} the Amazon basin — creating large natural history collections, especially of insects. Wallace sailed back to England in 1852 after four years; on the voyage, his ship caught fire, and his collection was destroyed; undeterred, he set out again, leading eventually (1869) to a comparable book, The Malay Archipelago. By the time he came home in November 1859, Bates had collected over 14,000 species, of which 8,000 were new to science. His observations of the coloration of butterflies led him <b>to</b> <b>describe</b> <b>what</b> is now called Batesian mimicry, where an edible species protects itself by appearing like a distasteful species. Bates's account of his stay, including observations of nature and the people around him, occupies his book.|$|E

5|$|The Roman {{military}} occupation {{of a significant}} part of what is now northern Scotland lasted only about 40 years; although their influence on the southern section of the country, occupied by Brythonic tribes such as the Votadini and Damnonii, would still have been considerable between the first and fifth centuries. The Welsh term Hen Ogledd ("Old North") is used by scholars <b>to</b> <b>describe</b> <b>what</b> is now the North of England and the South of Scotland during its habitation by Brittonic-speaking people around AD 500 to 800. According to writings from the 9th and 10th centuries, the Gaelic kingdom of Dál Riata was founded in the 6th century in western Scotland. The 'traditional' view is that settlers from Ireland founded the kingdom, bringing Gaelic language and culture with them. However, some archaeologists have argued against this view, saying there is no archaeological or placename evidence for a migration or a takeover by a small group of elites.|$|E
5|$|The {{early part}} of the 20th century saw a number of {{implants}} made of a variety of materials. One of the earliest successful implants was the Greenfield implant system of 1913 (also known as the Greenfield crib or basket). Greenfield's implant, an iridioplatinum implant attached to a gold crown, showed evidence of osseointegration and lasted for a number of years. The first use of titanium as an implantable material was by Bothe, Beaton and Davenport in 1940, who observed how close the bone grew to titanium screws, and the difficulty they had in extracting them. Bothe et al. were the first researchers <b>to</b> <b>describe</b> <b>what</b> would later be called osseointegration (a name that would be marketed later on by Per-Ingvar Brånemark). In 1951, Gottlieb Leventhal implanted titanium rods in rabbits. Leventhal's positive results led him to believe that titanium represented the ideal metal for surgery.|$|E
5|$|Compared with {{planets and}} other astronomical bodies, {{the objects of}} {{everyday}} life (people, cars, houses, even mountains) have little mass. Where such objects are concerned, the laws governing the behavior of test particles are sufficient <b>to</b> <b>describe</b> <b>what</b> happens. Notably, in order to deflect a test particle from its geodesic path, an external force must be applied. A chair someone is sitting on applies an external upwards force preventing the person from falling freely towards {{the center of the}} Earth and thus following a geodesic, which they would otherwise be doing without matter in between them and the center of the Earth. In this way, general relativity explains the daily experience of gravity {{on the surface of the}} Earth not as the downwards pull of a gravitational force, but as the upwards push of external forces. These forces deflect all bodies resting on the Earth's surface from the geodesics they would otherwise follow. For matter objects whose own gravitational influence cannot be neglected, the laws of motion are somewhat more complicated than for test particles, although it remains true that spacetime tells matter how to move.|$|E
40|$|Using {{the active}} {{replication}} strategy to replicate objects introduces some problems when the objects invoke methods of other objects.

25|$|Historically, {{the word}} ninja {{was not in}} common use, {{and a variety of}} {{regional}} colloquialisms evolved <b>to</b> <b>describe</b> <b>what</b> would later be dubbed ninja.

25|$|Organizing their {{original}} paper, Damas and Milner clearly separated {{two very different}} tasks. One is <b>to</b> <b>describe</b> <b>what</b> types an expression can have and another to present an algorithm actually computing a type.

50|$|Presentism is also {{a factor}} in the {{problematic}} question of history and moral judgments. Among historians, the orthodox view may be that reading modern notions of morality into the past is to commit the error of presentism. To avoid this, historians restrict themselves <b>to</b> <b>describing</b> <b>what</b> happened and attempt to refrain from using language that passes judgment. For example, when writing history about slavery in an era when the practice was widely accepted, letting that fact influence judgment about a group or individual would be presentist and thus should be avoided.|$|R

25|$|One of the {{difficulties}} in understanding sexual harassment, is that it involves a range of behaviors.

Moreover, behavior and motives vary between individual cases.|$|E

25|$|Cosmos {{utilizes}} a light, conversational tone {{to render}} complex scientific topics readable for a lay audience. On many topics, the book encompasses a more concise, refined presentation of previous ideas about which Sagan had written. One critic characterized {{the book as}} containing religious rhetoric in its descriptions of science and the universe. Peter Lawler, a political science professor, believes Sagan's religious rhetoric was very intentional. He believes Sagan uses images of God <b>to</b> <b>describe</b> <b>what</b> contact with extraterrestrial life may bring. Sagan also uses religious images as loose metaphors to help explain large, difficult concepts.|$|E

5000|$|In {{contrast}} <b>to</b> <b>describing</b> <b>what</b> constitutions are, a prescriptive approach addresses what {{a constitution}} should be. As presented by Canadian philosopher Wil Waluchow, constitutionalism embodies [...] "the idea... that government {{can and should}} be legally limited in its powers, and that its authority depends on its observing these limitations. This idea brings with it a host of vexing questions of interest not only to legal scholars, but to anyone keen to explore the legal and philosophical foundations of the state." [...] One example of this prescriptive approach was the project of the National Municipal League to develop a model state constitution.|$|R
