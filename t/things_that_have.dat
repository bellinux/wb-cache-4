But I am wrong to talk of these things. Your letters are so dear and kind – but so empty and bare – I feel myself through them that I have less to say to you than any other person. Rain – fine weather – <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>have</b> happened – that is all I ever have to tell you about – so utterly cut off is my real self, my innermost life, from yours...I have tried again and again {{to talk to you about}} more serious things, when I felt the need to do so – but we never meet each other – we have developed separately...and that is why I feel true companionship is an impossibility for us – because our thoughts will never meet...I love you too so very much, my darling husband, and that is why it is so sad to feel that our life is nevertheless so incomplete...But you are never intentionally to blame for this – I never think that, never...|$|E

25|$|Similarly, most forums allow {{users to}} define a {{signature}} (sometimes called a sig), which is a block of text, possibly with BBCode, which appears {{at the bottom of}} all of the user's posts. There is a character limit on signatures, though it may be so high that it is rarely hit. Often the forum's moderators impose manual rules on signatures to prevent them from being obnoxious (for example, being extremely long or having flashing images), and issue warnings or bans to users who break these rules. Like avatars, signatures may improve the recognizability of a poster. They may also allow the user to attach information to all of their posts, such as proclaiming support for a cause, noting facts about themselves, or quoting humorous <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>have</b> previously been said on the forum.|$|E

But we do prove it a posteriori, i.e., from the <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>have</b> been created, following an argument from the effects to the cause: namely, from things which are moved and cannot be the adequate source of their motion, to a first unmoved mover; from {{the production of the}} things in this world by causes subordinated to one another, to a first uncaused cause; from corruptible things which equally might be or not be, to an absolutely necessary being; from things which more or less are, live, and understand, according to degrees of being, living and understanding, to that which is maximally understanding, maximally living and maximally a being; finally, from the order of all things, to a separated intellect which has ordered and organized things, and directs them to their end.|$|E
25|$|Otherwise, Ford's {{works are}} {{characterized}} by an aversion to doing <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>have</b> been done before. This is perhaps most notable in his two Star Trek novels, The Final Reflection (1984) and How Much for Just the Planet? (1987). The Final Reflection {{is the story of}} a small group of Klingons who prevent a war between the Klingon Empire and the Federation while the regular series characters are relegated to cameo appearances. (This novel introduced the fictional language Klingonaase.) In the comedic How Much for Just the Planet?, the Enterprise crew compete with a Klingon crew for control of a planet, whose colonists are not happy with this and defend their peace in inventive ways, which soon make everything a farce, including a Vaudevillian pie fight. The book includes song lyrics that satirize many 20th century stage musicals. Both novels present the Klingons in a more positive light, not just as the token evil menace of the week.|$|E

Both times as he crossed home plate, he looked up and pointed to the sky. [...] "That was for him", Youkilis said.

During the Los Angeles protests, a plane flew overhead trailing a large sign that read [...] "Honk if you think Scientology is a cult." [...] 150 protesters demonstrated in Clearwater, Florida, and a local organizer for Anonymous told The Tampa Tribune, [...] "We feel {{that we have an}} obligation to educate the public about the <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>have</b> gone on and hopefully make the Church of Scientology understand that they have to change." ...|$|E

[...] After discussing the crash with Dylan, biographer Robert Shelton concluded that he [...] "was saying there must be another way of life for the pop star, in which he is in control, not they. He had to find ways of working to his own advantage with the recording industry. He had {{to come to terms with}} his one-time friend, longtime manager, part-time neighbor, and sometime landlord, Albert Grossman." ...|$|E

NewNowNext.com approved of the plotline for increasing the presence of LGBT people of color on daytime television, with Ross von Metze of Edge Media Network commenting that the show was [...] "taking risks where other TV shows have failed".|$|E
500|$|Waugh's {{dissipated}} lifestyle {{continued into}} his final Oxford year, 1924. A letter written that {{year to a}} Lancing friend, Dudley Carew, hints at severe emotional pressures: [...] "I have been living very intensely these last three weeks. For the last fortnight I have been nearly insane.... I may perhaps one day in a later time tell {{you some of the}} <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>have</b> happened". He did just enough work to pass his final examinations in the summer of 1924 with a third-class. However, as he had begun at Hertford in the second term of the 1921–22 academic year, Waugh had completed only eight terms' residence when he sat his finals, rather than the nine required under the university's statutes. His poor results led to the loss of his scholarship, which made it impossible for him to return to Oxford for that final term, so he left without his degree.|$|E

500|$|In a 1992 {{interview}} about Shiloh, Naylor said: [...] "Like a patchwork quilt, a novel {{is made up}} of <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>have</b> happened to me and things I have heard or read about, all mixed up with imaginings." [...] Naylor's characters are frequently based on herself and her two sons. She penned the novel following an excursion with her husband, Rex, to visit their friends, Frank and Trudy Madden, in West Virginia. Naylor and Rex were strolling along a river when they discovered a dog in the grass following them. Dejected and frightened, the dog was [...] "the saddest, most mistreated-looking beagle I'd ever seen", Naylor later said. Because the dog frequently shuddered and slunk forward on her belly, Naylor suspected she had been abused. On a whim, Naylor whistled and the dog rushed forward, lapping Naylor's face. Tailing them until they reached the Maddens' house, the beagle remained under a tree, her paws cushioning her head during the drizzly afternoon. Naylor cried during her and her husband's trip home that night.|$|E
500|$|Leonardo DiCaprio was {{the first}} actor to be cast in the film. Nolan {{had been trying to}} work with the actor for years and met him several times, but was unable to {{convince}} him to appear in any of his films until Inception. DiCaprio finally agreed because he was [...] "intrigued by this concept—this dream-heist notion and how this character's going to unlock his dreamworld and ultimately affect his real life." [...] He read the script and found it to be [...] "very well written, comprehensive but you really had to have Chris in person, to try to articulate some of the <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>have</b> been swirling around his head for the last eight years." [...] DiCaprio and Nolan spent months talking about the screenplay. Nolan took a long time re-writing the script in order [...] "to make sure that the emotional journey of his character was the driving force of the movie." [...] On February 11, 2009, it was announced that Warner Bros. purchased Inception, a spec script written by Nolan.|$|E
500|$|Gaga further {{elaborated}} on {{the inspiration}} behind the song as walking towards the light force {{in her life}} and peering towards the devil in the back, while clutching onto {{the source of the}} light. [...] "I sing about what a holy fool I am, and that although moments in my life are so cruel and relationships can be so cruel I’m still in love with Judas. I still go back again to those evil things," [...] she said. During her interview with Google, Gaga added to the song's meaning as honoring one's inner darkness in order to bring themselves into the light. One has to learn to forgive themselves in order to move on with their life. With Popjustice she clarified that {{she has a lot of}} <b>things</b> <b>that</b> <b>have</b> haunted her from her past, including her choices, men, drug abuse, being afraid to go back to New York, confronting old romances. Hence [...] "Judas" [...] represented something that was not good for her, something she could not escape. Gaga said: [...] "I keep going back and forth between the darkness and the light in order to understand who I am." ...|$|E
