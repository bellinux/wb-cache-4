5|$|After {{two seasons}} in Kansas City, the {{franchise}} moved to Denver and was renamed the Colorado Rockies it {{played at the}} McNichols Sports Arena. The team won its first game as <b>the</b> <b>Rockies,</b> 4–2, against the Toronto Maple Leafs. <b>The</b> <b>Rockies</b> were in position {{to qualify for the}} playoffs 60 games into the 1976–77 season, but a streak of 18 games without a win caused them to fall from contention. <b>The</b> <b>Rockies</b> ended the campaign last in the division with a 20–46–14 record and 54 points, and improved to 59 points the next season. Despite having the sixth-worst record in the League, <b>the</b> <b>Rockies</b> beat-out the Vancouver Canucks for second in the Division by two points and gained a playoff berth. The Philadelphia Flyers eliminated <b>the</b> <b>Rockies</b> from the playoffs in the preliminary rounds.|$|E
5|$|Affeldt {{spent the}} entire 2007 season in the bullpen, where he {{was used as a}} lefty specialist. Affeldt had a 2.15 ERA through his first fiftysix games of the year. He did not give up a home run until Pete Laforest hit one off of him in an 119 loss to the San Diego Padres on August 16. He {{struggled}} {{at the end of the}} year, with a 7.30 ERA in his final nineteen games. He still finished the year 43, with a 3.51 ERA in seventy-five games, and <b>the</b> <b>Rockies</b> made the playoffs as the NL Wild Card. He made his postseason debut on October 4 in the Division Series against the Philadelphia Phillies and gave up one run (on a home run by Ryan Howard) in one inning in a 105 win by Colorado. <b>The</b> <b>Rockies</b> swept the series to advance to the Championship Series against the Arizona Diamondbacks. In the first game, Affeldt entered with two outs and the bases loaded with <b>the</b> <b>Rockies</b> leading 51. He retired Stephen Drew to help <b>the</b> <b>Rockies</b> win 5–1. <b>The</b> <b>Rockies</b> swept the Diamondbacks to meet the Boston Red Sox in the World Series. Affeldt pitched in all four games of the World Series without giving up a run, but <b>the</b> <b>Rockies</b> were swept by the Red Sox. Affeldt became a free agent after the season.|$|E
5|$|Colorado's win {{clinched}} the team's second post-season berth in franchise history, {{and the first}} for their first baseman Todd Helton. <b>The</b> <b>Rockies</b> swept the Phillies in the 2007 National League Division Series and the Diamondbacks in the 2007 National League Championship Series (NLCS) to win the franchise's first National League pennant. This streak, in combination with <b>the</b> <b>Rockies</b> performance {{at the end of}} the season, meant <b>the</b> <b>Rockies</b> had won 21 of their last 22 games. The last National League team to win 20 of 21 games at any point in the season were the 1936 New York Giants. <b>The</b> <b>Rockies</b> also opened the playoffs with seven straight wins, the 1976 Cincinnati Reds were the only other team in major league history to do so. <b>The</b> <b>Rockies</b> moved on to the 2007 World Series with their NLCS win, where they were swept by the Boston Red Sox.|$|E

5|$|The {{game was}} {{necessary}} after both teams finished {{the season with}} identical win–loss records of 89–73. <b>The</b> <b>Rockies</b> won a coin flip late in the season, which awarded them home field for the game.

However, <b>the</b> <b>Rockies</b> were, in turn, swept in the 2007 World Series by the Boston Red Sox, ending their season.

The Rockies' Garrett Atkins appeared to homer in the bottom of the seventh, extending <b>the</b> <b>Rockies</b> lead, but umpires ruled that the ball hit padding on the outfield wall, which was still in play, and awarded Atkins a double. Jamey Carroll pinch ran for Atkins, but no runs scored in the inning. <b>The</b> <b>Rockies</b> brought in closer Brian Fuentes {{in the top of the}} 8th, but the Padres re-tied the game when Geoff Blum singled to lead off the inning, advanced to second base on a wild pitch, and scored on a double by Brian Giles.
