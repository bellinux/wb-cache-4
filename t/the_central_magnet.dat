Particles in this area that move up or down see increasing magnetic density and tend to move back towards the equator area again. This gives the system some level of natural stability.

Measurements of two components of the field were made at approximately 1900 points in the fringe field down-stream from the bubble chamber at each of two magnet currents (nominal currents were 18, 000 and 16, 000 amps). An additional 800 measurements were made {{to determine the effects}} on the field of iron phototube shields used with a dE/dx counter installed in the downstream magnet slot as part of experiment 2 B. Measurements were also made at about 180 points in the fringe field upstream from the bubble chamber in the region traversed by incident beams of particles. In addition about 200 measurements were made in the visible volume of the chamber to check the calibration of the field, the accuracy of existing field maps, and the variation of <b>the</b> <b>central</b> field with <b>magnet</b> current. This report describes the equipment used in the acquisition of the data and provides estimates of the precision with which the measurements of field and of position could be made. The reduction of the raw data to a form useful for obtaining fits to the fringe field is discussed. Simple plots of the fringe field in regions traversed by beam and secondary particles are provided and a polynomial approximation for the fringe field is discussed. This may be used as an approximation in estimating the effects of the fringe field on secondary particles from interactions in the chamber. Plots are also provided which allow an estimation of the bending of incident particles prior to entering the chamber.

Each of the sixteen SST- 1 TF magnets has been tested fully and successfully in a dedicated test stand in nineteen campaigns during June 10, 2010 and was concluded on Jan 24, 2011. These campaigns ensured that all the sixteen TF magnets could be charged to their nominal currents of 10000 A in either two-phase or supercritical cooling conditions with leak-tight inter-double pancake resistances being in the range of 150 pico ohms to 1200 pico ohms. The supercritical helium cooled thermal shields welded in the inner bore of the TF magnets have also performed as per the design specifications. Subsequently, the assemblies of the SST- 1 TF magnets and the Poloidal Field (PF) magnets in SST- 1 machine shell have begun. The SST- 1 TF magnets are being assembled in pairs (known as octants) together with a SST- 1 vacuum vessel module, sector of 80 K bubble type thermal shields and a pair of outer-inter-coil-structures.
