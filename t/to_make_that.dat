5|$|After Chamberlin's death, his {{collection}} of some 250,000 spider specimens was donated to the American Museum of Natural History in New York, bolstering the museum's status as the world's largest arachnid repository. Similarly, {{his collection}} of millipedes was deposited in the National Museum of Natural History in Washington, D.C., helping <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>that</b> museum the world's largest single collection of millipede type specimens—the individual specimens used to describe species.|$|E
5|$|The first {{herbarium}} {{collection of}} B.epica {{was not made}} until October 1973, when Ernest Charles Nelson visited Toolinna Cove to collect specimens for a taxonomic revision of Adenanthos. Nelson was stimulated <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>that</b> revision from {{an interest in the}} problem of disjunct plant distributions in southern Australia, and therefore collected specimens of a range of plant species. On 22 October, he collected a specimen of B.epica in old flower, but incorrectly identified it as B.media, and later lodged it in the herbarium at Canberra under that name.|$|E
5|$|Val Guest, who had {{directed}} The Quatermass Xperiment, returned for Quatermass 2. Guest once again sought {{to create a}} film that felt as real as possible, using many cinema vérité techniques such as hand-held cameras. He was assisted in this respect by the moody, overcast cinematography of director of photography Gerald Gibbs, who also made extensive use of day for night photography for the film's climactic scenes. Guest planned each day’s shooting carefully, creating meticulous storyboards detailing all the shots he wanted <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>that</b> day.|$|E

5|$|Woodward’s own {{judgment}} {{of the war and}} of Bush doesn’t really matter. In the course of four books he has given readers the conversations and documents we need to reach our {{own judgment}}s. He has also, however unevenly and imperfectly, supplied enough synthesis and analysis <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>that</b> judgment genuinely informed. Sure, these books can be a slog. But they stand as the fullest story yet of the Bush presidency and of the war that is likely to be its most important legacy.|$|E
5|$|In 1973, {{the naval}} museum curator Robert F. Sumrall (following Kerr) {{suggested}} a {{mechanism by which}} dazzle camouflage may have sown the kind of confusion that Wilkinson had intended for it. Coincidence rangefinders used for naval artillery had an optical mechanism, operated by a human to compute the range. The operator adjusted the mechanism until the two half-images of the target lined up in a complete picture. Dazzle, Sumrall argued, was intended <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>that</b> hard, as clashing patterns looked abnormal even when the two halves were aligned, something that became more important when submarine periscopes included such rangefinders. Patterns sometimes also included a false bow wave to {{make it difficult for}} an enemy to estimate the ship's speed.|$|E
5|$|In {{the history}} of popular music, there are a {{relative}} handful of performers who have redefined {{the content of the}} music at critical points in history—people whose music left the landscape, and definition of popular music, altered completely. The Kingston Trio were one such group, transforming folk music into a hot commodity and creating a demand—where none had existed before—for young men (sometimes with women) strumming acoustic guitars and banjos and singing folk songs and folk-like novelty songs in harmony. On a purely commercial level, from 1957 until 1963, the Kingston Trio were the most vital and popular folk group in the world, and folk music was sufficiently popular as <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>that</b> a significant statement. Equally important, the original trio—Dave Guard, Nick Reynolds, and Bob Shane—in tandem with other, similar early acts such as the Limeliters, spearheaded a boom in the popularity of folk music that suddenly made the latter important to millions of listeners who previously had ignored it.|$|E

5|$|Officials in Indonesia {{received}} {{information regarding}} the tsunami {{in the form of}} bulletins from the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center and the Japan Meteorological Agency, but wanted to avoid panic, and did not attempt to disseminate the advisories to the public. Virtually no time was available <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>that</b> sort of effort (had the intention been to communicate the danger with the public) because some community leaders were sent text messages with pertinent information only minutes prior to the arrival of the first waves. The tsunami affected the coast of Java comprising mostly fishing villages and beach resorts that were unscathed following the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami, and was also only several hundred kilometers distant from the region that saw heavy destruction just several months prior during the 2006 Yogyakarta earthquake.|$|E
5|$|Several years later, {{according}} to a narration collected by historian Ibn Ishaq, Muhammad was involved with a well-known story about setting the Black Stone {{in place in the}} wall of the Kaaba in 605 CE. The Black Stone, a sacred object, was removed during renovations to the Kaaba. The Meccan leaders could not agree which clan should return the Black Stone to its place. They decided to ask the next man who comes through the gate <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>that</b> decision; that man was the 35-year-old Muhammad. This event happened five years before the first revelation by Gabriel to him. He asked for a cloth and laid the Black Stone in its center. The clan leaders held the corners of the cloth and together carried the Black Stone to the right spot, then Muhammad laid the stone, satisfying the honour of all.|$|E
5|$|Other {{scientists}} {{working for}} Davros, now {{aware of his}} plans, free the Doctor and give him enough time to rig the Dalek incubation room with explosives which would end {{the threat of the}} Daleks. As he is about to touch the two exposed wire ends to set them off, the Doctor questions if he has the right <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>that</b> decision and forgoes setting the explosions off. Just then, he learns that Davros has agreed to stop and allow the Kaled leaders to vote on the continuation of the project. As the leaders gather for this vote, the Doctor is able to recover the Time Ring and destroy the recordings he made, while learning that the Thals and Mutos have prepared the means to destroy the bunker. As the vote is called, Davros reveals this was all a decoy, giving the Daleks he sent to the Thal time to return to the bunker and exterminate the remaining Kaleds. Harry and Sarah escape the chaos, while the Doctor returns to set off the incubator room's explosives, but a Dalek inadvertently completes the circuit and sets it off itself. The Doctor escapes in time before the Thal and Mutos' bomb caves in the bunker, trapping Davros and the Daleks. Inside, Davros realises the Daleks have gained a will of their own, and attempts to stop the production line, but a Dalek incapacitates him.|$|E
