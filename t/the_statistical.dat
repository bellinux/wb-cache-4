40|$|Cracks {{are one of}} {{the hidden}} dangers in {{concrete}} dams. The study on safety monitoring models of concrete dam cracks has always been difficult. Using <b>the</b> parametric <b>statistical</b> model of safety monitoring of cracks in concrete dams, with the help of <b>the</b> semi-parametric <b>statistical</b> theory, and considering the abnormal behaviors of these cracks, <b>the</b> semi-parametric <b>statistical</b> model of safety monitoring of concrete dam cracks is established to overcome the limitation of the parametric model in expressing the objective model. Previous projects show that <b>the</b> semi-parametric <b>statistical</b> model has a stronger fitting effect and has a better explanation for cracks in concrete dams than <b>the</b> parametric <b>statistical</b> model. However, when used for forecast, the forecast capability of <b>the</b> semi-parametric <b>statistical</b> model is equivalent to that of <b>the</b> parametric <b>statistical</b> model. <b>The</b> modeling of <b>the</b> semi-parametric <b>statistical</b> model is simple, has a reasonable principle, and has a strong practicality, with a good application prospect in the actual project...|$|R
