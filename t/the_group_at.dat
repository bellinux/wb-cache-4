5|$|The West Coast Pop Art Experimental Band (WCPAEB) was an American {{psychedelic}} {{rock band}} formed in Los Angeles, California in 1965. The group created music that possessed an eerie, {{and at times}} sinister, atmosphere, and contained material that was bluntly political, childlike, and bizarre. Representing different musical backgrounds among band members, <b>the</b> <b>group,</b> <b>at</b> times, resembled a traditional Byrds-esque folk rock ensemble, but the WCPAEB also, within the same body of work, recorded avant-garde music marked by multi-layered vocal harmonies.|$|E

5|$|After {{a dispute}} with Eazy-E, Dre left <b>the</b> <b>group</b> <b>at</b> the peak of its {{popularity}} in 1991 under the advice of friend, and N.W.A lyricist, The D.O.C. and his bodyguard at the time, Suge Knight. Knight, a notorious strongman and intimidator, was able to have Eazy-E release Young from his contract and, using Dr.Dre as his flagship artist, founded Death Row Records. In 1992 Young released his first single, the title track to the film Deep Cover, a collaboration with rapper Snoop Dogg, whom he met through Warren G. Dr.Dre's debut solo album was The Chronic, released under Death Row Records with Suge Knight as executive producer. Young ushered in a new style of rap, {{both in terms of}} musical style and lyrical content, including introducing a number of artists to the industry including Snoop Dogg, Kurupt, Daz Dillinger, RBX, The Lady of Rage, Nate Dogg and Jewell.|$|E
5|$|After rehearsing with Strummer {{for less}} than a month, the Clash made their debut on 4 July 1976, {{supporting}} the Sex Pistols at the Black Swan in Sheffield. The band apparently wanted to make it on-stage before their rivals in the Damned—another London SS spinoff—made their own scheduled debut two days later. The Clash would not play {{in front of an audience}} again for another five weeks. Levene was becoming disaffected with his position in <b>the</b> <b>group.</b> <b>At</b> the Black Swan, he approached the Sex Pistols' lead singer, John Lydon (then going by Johnny Rotten), and suggested they form a band together if the Pistols broke up.|$|E

5|$|At 3:30p.m., the Kaštela TG {{turned around}} {{once more to}} attack Cape Lovište, but were engaged by nearby coastal {{artillery}} located on Korčula. Blitvenica was damaged in the shooting and the entire naval force moved north-west towards Šćedro Island. Iž sustained heavy damage and ran aground in Torac Bay off Hvar, and was abandoned. Olib sank between Pelješac and Hvar. Her crew was rescued by the remaining vessels in <b>the</b> <b>group.</b> <b>At</b> 7:00p.m., the fleet sailed south from Šćedro towards {{the western part of}} Korčula, seeking shelter as the Sirocco wind strengthened. As the ships approached Korčula, they were fired upon by coastal artillery at Črna Luka and Cape Privala, forcing them to turn west towards Vis. The Vis TG did not engage Croatian positions on 16 November.|$|E

In Omaha, Nebraska, the King was {{the guest of honor}} at a reception held in the home of Judge James M. Woolworth. Most of the attendees were friends of the judge's daughter, who had met the King on a vacation in Hawaii. Although Kalākaua had claimed exhaustion from his world trip, he nevertheless danced the whole night with the women guests. Claus and Mrs. Spreckels joined <b>the</b> <b>group</b> <b>at</b> Ogden, Utah.|$|E
5|$|At {{the same}} time, Werber was {{attempting}} to leverage the Trio's popularity as a club act into a recording contract. Both Dot Records and Liberty Records expressed some interest, but each proposed to record the Trio on 45 rpm (revolutions per minute) singles only, whereas Werber and the Trio members both felt that 33⅓ rpm albums had more potential for the group's music. Through Jimmy Saphier, agent for Bob Hope who had seen and liked <b>the</b> <b>group</b> <b>at</b> The Purple Onion, Werber contacted Capitol Records, which dispatched prominent producer Voyle Gilmore to San Francisco to evaluate the Trio's commercial potential. On Gilmore's strong recommendation, Capitol signed the Kingston Trio to an exclusive seven-year deal.|$|E

5|$|Early in the Society's history, {{when its}} focus was still {{primarily}} literary, membership was considered {{by a committee}} {{for three days and}} then voted upon. By 1908, that model had been abandoned in favor of an open system in which any student who paid an annual fee could be part of <b>the</b> <b>group.</b> <b>At</b> that time, Philaletheis was governed by a six-member board consisting of a president and vice-president (both seniors), secretary, treasurer, and props manager (juniors), and an assistant props manager (a sophomore). In 1951, the board was vastly expanded to include managers of scenery, lights, sound, makeup, publicity, {{and a number of other}} fields.|$|E
5|$|Early {{stripline}} directly coupled resonator filters were end-coupled, but {{the length}} was reduced and the compactness successively increased {{with the introduction}} of parallel-coupled line filters, interdigital filters, and comb-line filters. Much of this work was published by <b>the</b> <b>group</b> <b>at</b> Stanford led by George Matthaei, and also including Leo Young mentioned above, in a landmark book which still today serves as a reference for circuit designers. The hairpin filter was first described in 1972. By the 1970s, most of the filter topologies in common use today had been described. More recent research has concentrated on new or variant mathematical classes of the filters, such as pseudo-elliptic, while still using the same basic topologies, or with alternative implementation technologies such as suspended stripline and finline.|$|E
5|$|Epstein made {{numerous}} {{trips to}} London to visit record {{companies in the}} hope of securing a record contract, but many rejected him, including Columbia, Pye, Philips, Oriole, and most notoriously Decca. On 13 December 1961, at Epstein's invitation, Mike Smith of Decca travelled from London to Liverpool to watch <b>the</b> <b>group</b> <b>at</b> The Cavern Club, which led to an audition in London on 1 January 1962 (see The Beatles' Decca audition). Decca informed Epstein one month later that the audition tapes had been rejected. The Beatles later found out that Epstein had paid Decca producer Tony Meehan (ex-drummer of the Shadows) to produce the studio recordings. While Epstein was negotiating with Decca, he also approached Ron White, an EMI marketing executive, who contacted EMI producers Norrie Paramor, Walter Ridley, and Norman Newell, but they all declined to record the group. White could not contact EMI's fourth staff producer George Martin, as he was on holiday.|$|E

5|$|Field {{attended}} Macquarie University {{to receive}} training {{in early childhood}} education, and founded The Wiggles with fellow students Murray Cook, Greg Page and former bandmate Jeff Fatt in 1991. He worked as a preschool teacher {{for two years before}} the success of The Wiggles led him to focus on children's music full-time. Despite Field's strong dislike of touring, The Wiggles {{became one of the most}} successful and active groups in Australia. Field, who wore blue while performing with the group, was responsible for the production aspects of their stage and television shows, CDs, and DVDs. His issues with chronic pain and depression, which almost forced him out of <b>the</b> <b>group</b> <b>at</b> the height of their success, are well-documented.|$|E
5|$|From 1986 to 1992, Deal was {{a member}} of the Pixies, and from 1989 onwards, the Breeders.

The other members of <b>the</b> <b>group</b> <b>at</b> that time were Kim's twin sister Kelley Deal, Josephine Wiggs and Jim Macpherson. By late 1994, after two years of straight touring and recording, and culminating in the Lollapalooza tour, the band members were exhausted; they decided to take some time off from the Breeders, but this hiatus ended up being longer than expected. Kelley was arrested on drug charges in late 1994 and spent time in and out of rehabilitation, while Wiggs became involved in musical projects in New York, including collaborations with members of Luscious Jackson.|$|E

The commando took additional casualties in several skirmishes, including at La Rosière, on the way to Point 72. They did not arrive there until 22:30, too late to launch an attack, so they dug in for the night. The town and port were captured in the battle of Port-en-Bessin on 7–8 June 1944.|$|E
5|$|In {{the spring}} of 1845, Palmer {{traveled}} to Oregon without his family, as captain of a wagon train of 23 wagons. Stephen Meek served as the train's paid guide.

The remaining parts of the wagon train {{reached the end of the}} overland Oregon Trail at the Columbia River, and unwilling to wait for transport down the dangerous Cascade Rapids, Palmer's party joined Sam Barlow's party in a quest for passage through the Cascade Range around the south side of Mount Hood. Palmer climbed to the 9,000-foot level of Mount Hood on October 7, 1845—with little food and the scant protection of moccasins—to scout a route off the mountains. This was Mount Hood's first recorded climb; the Palmer Glacier on the mountain is named for him.|$|E
