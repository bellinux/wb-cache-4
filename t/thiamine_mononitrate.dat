40|$|ABSTRACT. The {{effects of}} a thiamine-deficient diet on plasma and tissue vitamin {{concentrations}} and on whole-body glucose metabolism were assessed. Male Sprague-Dawley rats (175 to 200 g body weight) fed a thiamine-deficient (TD) or nutritionally complete purified diet were used for plasma <b>thiamine</b> <b>mononitrate</b> and monophosphate and for red blood cell and tissue thiamine pyrophosphate (TPP) determinations weekly for up to 5 weeks. Additional rats were used for assessment of basal glucose kinetics by using a primed constant infusion of [3 -H]glucose. Plasma <b>thiamine</b> <b>mononitrate</b> levels decreased 60 % at 1 week and were undetectable after 5 weeks on the diet. Plasma thiamine monophosphate decreased 80 % after 1 week on the TD diet, and levels were undetectable after 4 weeks on the diet.

40|$|Background: The {{provision}} of {{high doses of}} thiamine may prevent thiamine deficiency in the post-partum period of displaced persons. Methodology/Principal Findings: The study aimed to evaluate a supplementation regimen of <b>thiamine</b> <b>mononitrate</b> (100 mg daily) at the antenatal clinics in Maela refugee camp. Women were enrolled during antenatal care and followed after delivery. Samples were collected at 12 weeks post partum. Thiamine diphosphate (TDP) in whole blood and thiamine in breast-milk of 636 lactating women were measured. Thiamine in breast-milk consisted of thiamine monophosphate (TMP) in addition to thiamine, with a mean TMP to total thiamine ratio of 63 %. Mean whole blood TDP (130 nmol/L) and total thiamine in breast-milk (755 nmol/L) were within the upper range reported for well-nourished women. The prevalence of women with low whole blood TDP (, 65 nmol/L) was 5 % and with deficient breast-milk total thiamine (, 300 nmol/L) was 4 %. Whole blood TDP predicted both breast-milk thiamine and TMP (R 2 = 0. 36 and 0. 10, p, 0. 001). A ratio of TMP to total thiamine $ 63 % {{was associated with a}} 7. 5 and 4 -fold higher risk of low whole blood TDP and deficient total breast-milk thiamine, respectively.

40|$|Abstract. A comparative study of <b>thiamine</b> <b>mononitrate</b> and thiamine {{hydrochloride}} potentiometric  titrations  with  a  strong  base  in  {{water was}} performed. The analysis of resulting curves allowed associating particular reactions to each observed pH break point. The correspond-ing pKa values were calculated by using the program SUPERQUAD and they were subsequently used to simulate titration curves. The pKa values obtained in the conditions of the present work are:  pKa 1   =  4. 80 ±  0. 05,  pKa 2   ≥  10. 40   ±  0. 04,  pKa 3   ≤  8. 10   ±  0. 04.  The system behavior mainly depends  on  parameters  such  as  the  time  for  measuring  pH, NaOH concentration and particularly on the stability of one of the two ampholytes.

40|$|Master of ScienceDepartment of Grain Science and IndustryGreg AldrichWater soluble B-vitamins play an {{integral}} role in normal metabolic function in cats. For example, thiamine deficiency results in anorexia, neurological impairment, and, in severe cases, {{death in a}} few weeks’ time. However, little research has addressed how these vitamins are affected during cat food canning. Thiamine is the most susceptible to degradation during this process, with less known about how it affects the other B-vitamins. Therefore, our objectives were {{to determine the effects}} of modifying processing parameters on thiamine and other water-soluble B-vitamins in a model canned cat food. In a series of five experiments, various processing parameters were adjusted: including cook (retort) time, batter moisture and temperature, pH, protein source, and the addition of sulfites. Pressure (172368. 93 Pa) and temperature (121 ̊C) within the retort remained the same for all treatments. As retort time increased, thiamine concentration decreased (P ≤ 0. 05). No loss of B-vitamin concentration was noted for thiamine, riboflavin, cobalamin, and pantothenic acid as batter moisture increased. Likewise, as batter temperature increased, concentration of riboflavin, niacin, pyridoxine, folic acid, and pantothenic acid remained constant (P ˃ 0. 10). When different types of thiamine were included for supplementation, <b>thiamine</b> <b>mononitrate</b> tended to have a greater retention of the vitamin than thiamine hydrochloride (P = 0. 12). The protein sources selected for the experiment included chicken as a control, beef liver, chicken liver, pork liver, salmon, tuna, and whitefish. The salmon, tuna, and whitefish were grouped together for analysis. Beef liver, chicken liver, and pork liver were grouped together for analysis. The vitamin retention of each group was compared. When compared to chicken or liver, thiamine retention was greatest in diets containing fish (P≤ 0. 05). In addition, riboflavin, niacin, and cobalamin retentions were greatest (P≤ 0. 05) in diets containing liver. The addition of sulfites came from dehydrated potatoes added to thediets in exchange for rice. Thiamine tended to decrease in those diets with sulfite containing dehydrated potatoes (P= 0. 07) compared to diets containing rice. Pyridoxine and pantothenic acid retention decreased in diets containing dehydrated potatoes (P≤ 0. 05) compared to diets containing rice. The largest negative impact on thiamine retention was time in the retort; cobalamin, folic acid, and riboflavin were also negatively affected. Including sulfite-containing potatoes in the diet tended to decrease thiamine, pyridoxine, and pantothenic acid. It was expected that diets containing chicken would retain more thiamine than those formulated with fish and liver. However, diets containing fish retained more thiamine, pyridoxine, and pantothenic acid. Therefore, it appears that processing and diet composition can affect the B-vitamin content of canned cat foods and must be accounted for when producing commercial products...|$|E
