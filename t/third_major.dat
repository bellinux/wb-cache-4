50|$|An {{augmented}} tuning is a tuning {{system for}} musical instruments that {{is associated with}} augmented triads, that is a root note, a <b>major</b> <b>third,</b> and an augmented fifth. The augmented fifth is constructed by stacking the <b>major</b> <b>third</b> with another <b>major</b> <b>third.</b> Consequently, all of the intervals are <b>major</b> <b>thirds.</b>|$|R
5|$|The <b>third</b> <b>major</b> action Hichens was {{involved}} in during this period was the action during the night of 21/22 April 1942, off Ostend, when they engaged six E boats, forcing the superior force to scatter and run for port after severely damaging one boat and causing slight damage to the others. After this action the E boats were moved to a safer harbour to operate from. Hichens was awarded a Distinguished Service Order (DSO) following this engagement.|$|E
5|$|Why Should The Fire Die? is the <b>third</b> <b>major</b> album {{release and}} fifth album overall by {{progressive}} acoustic trio Nickel Creek.

Why Should the Fire Die? is the first Nickel Creek album to feature string bassist Mark Schatz.|$|E
5|$|A {{few years}} later, the current {{fortress}} was built {{close to the}} desert edge by the Zengid–Ayyubid lord Shirkuh. The latter's descendants held al-Rahba as a hereditary fief granted by Saladin until 1264. One of them, Shirkuh II, oversaw a <b>third</b> <b>major</b> reconstruction in 1207. Through the early Mamluk era (late 13th–14th centuries), the fortress was continuously restored and strengthened {{as a result of}} frequent sieges by the Ilkhanid Mongols of Iraq. Al-Rahba was the most important Mamluk fortress along the Euphrates, an administrative center and the terminal stop on the sultanate's postal route. It fell into disuse during Ottoman rule (1517–1918) and from then until the early 20th century, the fortress primarily served as a shelter for local shepherds and their flocks. Excavations were carried out at the site between 1976 and 1981.|$|E

50|$|For instance, a {{harpsichord}} tuner {{it might}} think of quarter-comma meantone tuning as having three generators—the octave, the just <b>major</b> <b>third</b> (5:4) and the quarter-comma tempered fifth—but because four consecutive tempered fifths produces a just <b>major</b> <b>third,</b> the <b>major</b> <b>third</b> is redundant, reducing it to a rank-two temperament.|$|R
5000|$|In meantone temperaments, {{the major}} tone and minor tone are {{replaced}} by a [...] "mean tone" [...] which {{is somewhere in between}} the two. Two of these tones make a ditone or <b>major</b> <b>third.</b> This <b>major</b> <b>third</b> is exactly the just (5:4) <b>major</b> <b>third</b> in quarter-comma meantone. This {{is the source of the}} name: the note exactly halfway between the bounding tones of the <b>major</b> <b>third</b> is called the [...] "mean tone".|$|R
5|$|A <b>third</b> <b>major</b> {{criticism}} of the Act {{is that it was}} poorly administered. The Act purposefully brought together competing interests (labor and business, big business and small business, etc.) in a coalition to support passage of the legislation, but these competing interests soon fought one another over the Act's implementation. As a consequence, NRA collapsed due to failure of leadership and confusion about its goals. By the end of 1934, NRA leaders had practically abandoned the progressive interventionist policy which motivated the Act's passage, and were supporting free-market philosophies—contributing to the collapse of almost all industry codes.|$|E
5|$|At the US Open, Djokovic beat Federer {{to reach}} his <b>third</b> <b>Major</b> final, {{although}} Nadal won once again to complete his Career Grand Slam. In November, Robin Söderling (who has reached the French Open final) briefly passed Murray to reach fourth place in the ATP rankings, threatening to break the Big Four's run of filling the end-of-year rankings. However, all of the Big Four reached the 2010 ATP World Tour Finals semifinals with Federer defeating Nadal in 3 sets in the final, leading to them achieving their third successive season in the top 4 positions. Again Djokovic and Murray were third and fourth respectively, both reaching one Grand Slam tournament final apiece.|$|E
5|$|Caracciola {{returned}} to racing in 1952, {{when he was}} recalled to the Mercedes-Benz factory team to drive the new Mercedes-Benz W194 in sports car races. The first major race with the car was the Mille Miglia, alongside Karl Kling and his old teammate Hermann Lang. Kling {{finished second in the}} race, Caracciola fourth. It later emerged that Caracciola had been given a car with an inferior engine to his teammates, perhaps {{because of a lack of}} time to prepare for the race. Caracciola's career ended with his <b>third</b> <b>major</b> crash; during a support race for the 1952 Swiss Grand Prix, the brakes on his 300SL locked and he skidded into a tree, fracturing his left leg.|$|E

5000|$|A major chord (...) {{differs from}} a minor chord {{in having a}} <b>major</b> <b>third</b> above the root instead of a minor third.It can also be {{described}} as a <b>major</b> <b>third</b> with a minor third on top, in contrast to a minor chord, which has a minor <b>third</b> with a <b>major</b> <b>third</b> on top. They both contain fifths, because a <b>major</b> <b>third</b> (4 semitones) plus a minor third (3 semitones) equals a fifth (7 semitones).|$|R
5|$|Fallout 3 is {{an action}} {{role-playing}} open world video game developed by Bethesda Game Studios {{and published by}} Bethesda Softworks. The <b>third</b> <b>major</b> installment in the Fallout series, {{it is the first}} game to be created by Bethesda since it bought the franchise from Interplay Entertainment. The game marks a major shift in the series by using 3D graphics and real-time combat, replacing the 2D isometric graphics and turn-based combat of previous installments. It was released worldwide in October 2008 for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 3, and Xbox 360.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Frances was {{the sixth}} named storm, the fourth {{hurricane}}, and the <b>third</b> <b>major</b> hurricane, of the 2004 Atlantic hurricane season. The system crossed the open Atlantic in mid and late August, {{moving to the}} north of the Lesser Antilles while strengthening. Its outer bands struck Puerto Rico and the British Virgin Islands while passing north of the Caribbean Sea. The storm's maximum sustained wind peaked at , achieving Category 4 on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale. As the system's forward motion slowed, the eye passed over San Salvador Island and very close to Cat Island in the Bahamas. Frances was the first hurricane to impact the entire Bahamian archipelago since 1928, and almost completely destroyed the agricultural economy there.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Kate was the second-longest lived {{tropical}} cyclone in the 2003 Atlantic hurricane season. The eleventh tropical storm, fifth hurricane, and <b>third</b> <b>major</b> hurricane of the season, Kate developed from a tropical wave {{in the central}} tropical Atlantic on September 25. Its unusual track included four major changes in direction. The storm moved northwestward until a weakness in the subtropical ridge forced it eastward. Kate strengthened to a hurricane, turned sharply westward while moving around a mid-level low, and intensified to a 125mph (205km/h) major hurricane on October 4. Kate turned sharply northward around the periphery of an anticyclone, weakened, and became extratropical after passing {{to the east of}} Newfoundland. The extratropical storm persisted for three days until losing its identity near Scandinavia.|$|E
5000|$|A common triad chord can be {{regarded}} as consisting of a [...] "stack" [...] of two thirds. There are four permutations: A <b>major</b> <b>third</b> stacked on a <b>major</b> <b>third</b> creates an augmented triad. A minor third on top of a <b>major</b> <b>third</b> manifests a <b>major</b> triad. A <b>major</b> <b>third</b> on top of a minor third produces a minor triad. Finally, a minor third stacked on a minor third constitutes a diminished triad.|$|R
5000|$|The {{other uses}} of major and minor, in general, refer to musical {{structures}} containing <b>major</b> <b>thirds</b> or minor <b>thirds.</b> A <b>major</b> scale is one whose third degree is a <b>major</b> <b>third</b> above the tonic, while a minor scale has a minor <b>third</b> degree. A <b>major</b> chord or major triad, similarly, contains a <b>major</b> <b>third</b> above the root, whereas a minor chord or minor triad contains a minor third above the root. In Western music, a minor chord, in comparison, [...] "sounds darker than a major chord".|$|R
5000|$|... minor triads {{contain a}} minor <b>third</b> with a <b>major</b> <b>third</b> stacked above it, e.g., {{in the minor}} triad A-C-E (A minor), A-C is a minor third and C-E is a <b>major</b> <b>third.</b>|$|R
5|$|Hurricane Mitch was {{the second}} deadliest Atlantic {{hurricane}} on record and the deadliest recorded hurricane in the satellite era. The storm was the thirteenth tropical storm, ninth hurricane, and <b>third</b> <b>major</b> hurricane of the 1998 hurricane season. Along with Hurricane Georges, Mitch was the most notable hurricane in the season. At the time, Hurricane Mitch was the strongest Atlantic hurricane observed {{in the month of}} October, though it has since been surpassed by Hurricane Wilma of the 2005 season. The hurricane matched the fourth most intense Atlantic hurricane on record (it has since dropped to seventh).|$|E
5|$|In 1981, a <b>third</b> <b>major</b> {{competitor}} {{joined the}} race for superheavy elements—the Gesellschaft für Schwerionenforschung (English: Society for Heavy Ion Research) in Darmstadt, Hesse, West Germany. They claimed to have synthesized the element 107; their report came out {{five years after the}} first report from Dubna did but provided a greater level of precision, making a more solid claim on discovery. The German team joined with the Soviet team in that it suggested the name nielsbohrium for the new element, believing Bohr did deserve an element named after him, and hoping to ease the tension on the element 105 controversy. The Soviet team did not hurry to suggest a new name for element 105, stating it was more important to first determine the discoverers of the element.|$|E
5|$|In June 2016, Ivan Lendl {{agreed to}} return to his former role as Murray's coach. Murray started his grass season at the 2016 Aegon Championships as the 1st seed and the {{defending}} champion. Murray defeated Nicolas Mahut in straight sets despite facing a set point in the first set and three set points in the second set. He then defeated his countryman Aljaž Bedene in straight sets. He then had three set wins over Kyle Edmund, another countryman, and No. 5 seed Marin Čilić. In the final he was down a set and a break to 3rd seed Milos Raonic. Murray still managed to come back and win a record 5th Queen's Club Championships and it was also his 2nd title in 2016. Murray then played at the <b>third</b> <b>major</b> of the year at the 2016 Wimbledon Championships as the 2nd seed. Murray had straight set wins over Liam Broady, Lu Yen-hsun, John Millman, and Nick Kyrgios in the first four rounds. Murray then defeated 12th seed Jo-Wilfried Tsonga in five sets in the quarterfinal and 10th seed Tomáš Berdych in straight sets to reach his third straight major final. In the final on 10 July, Murray defeated Raonic in straight sets to win his second Wimbledon title and <b>third</b> <b>Major</b> title overall. His Wimbledon crown was his 3rd title of the season and 38th career Tour title.|$|E

5|$|Once {{the regular}} season began, Ruth was a star pitcher who was also {{dangerous}} at the plate. The team performed well, yet received almost no attention from the Baltimore press. A <b>third</b> <b>major</b> league, the Federal League, had begun play, and the local franchise, the Baltimore Terrapins, restored that city to the major leagues {{for the first time}} since 1902. Few fans visited Oriole Park, where Ruth and his teammates labored in relative obscurity. Ruth may have been offered a bonus and a larger salary to jump to the Terrapins; when rumors to that effect swept Baltimore, giving Ruth the most publicity he had experienced to date, a Terrapins official denied it, stating it was their policy not to sign players under contract to Dunn.|$|E
5|$|The 1906 Florida Keys {{hurricane}} was {{a powerful}} and deadly hurricane that caused major impacts in Cuba and southern Florida. The fifth hurricane and <b>third</b> <b>major</b> hurricane of the season, the storm formed from a system near Barbados on October 4.
