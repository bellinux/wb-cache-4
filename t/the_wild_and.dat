5|$|Back in Dawson Creek in November, the Rage split {{a three-game}} {{series against the}} Monsters, 1-1-1, and won both games against the Chicago Hitmen. Following another 6-game road trip to Alaska, the Rage {{continued}} into December winning approximately one-in-three games, with an 11-22-2 record near the mid-season break, when they traded their 20-year-old captain, Blaine Bokenfohr, to the Merritt Centennials in exchange for future considerations. Scott Fellnermayr became the new captain of the Rage, and would remain the captain {{for the remainder of}} the season and the next. In January, the Rage split two-game series against <b>the</b> <b>Wild</b> <b>and</b> split another in Chicago. The team put together a six-game winning streak in January–February, winning games against the Brown Bears and the Avalanche before splitting a two-game series with the Monsters. On their next road trip, they lost their two games against <b>the</b> <b>Wild</b> <b>and</b> won the next three against the Monsters. The season ended in early March with Rage in fifth place with a 24-31-3 record, in the six-team West division.|$|E
5|$|In October 2010, {{the wild}} condor {{population}} {{in its name}} state of California reached 100 individuals, plus 73 wild condors in Arizona.

By June 2014, the condor population had reached 439: 225 in <b>the</b> <b>wild</b> <b>and</b> 214 in captivity. Official statistics from the December 2016 USFWS recorded an overall population of 446, of which 276 are wild and 170 are captive.

5|$|Incubation lasts 72–80days in <b>the</b> <b>wild</b> <b>and</b> for {{a similar}} period in {{artificial}} conditions. In August and September, the young turtle breaks out from its egg, using a special projection of its jaw called the egg tooth. Not all offspring leave the nest immediately, though. Hatchlings north of a line from Nebraska to northern Illinois to New Jersey typically arrange themselves symmetrically in the nest and overwinter to emerge the following spring.|$|E

5|$|Outside {{their native}} range, escaped birds {{frequently}} establish themselves {{in areas with}} a suitable climate and can then colonize new areas nearby. Escaped cage-birds established in <b>the</b> <b>wild</b> <b>and</b> such populations have been recorded in the West Indies (Puerto Rico since 1971), Hawaii (since 1883), Australia, Japan and southern United States mainly in Florida and California. In Oahu, Hawaii, they compete for habitats with the tricolored munia and tend to be rare where this competitor is present.|$|E
5|$|The African river {{martin has}} a {{restricted}} distribution; {{it appears to}} be locally numerous, although its true status has not been fully investigated.

5|$|The Maya had few {{domestic}} animals; {{dogs were}} domesticated by 3000 BC, and the Muscovy duck by the Late Postclassic.

All {{of these were}} used as food animals; dogs were additionally used for hunting. It is possible that deer were also penned and fattened.|$|E
5|$|The {{majority}} of lions kept in zoos are hybrids of different subspecies. Approximately 77% of the captive lions registered by the International Species Information System are of unknown origin. Nonetheless, they might carry genes that are extinct in <b>the</b> <b>wild,</b> <b>and</b> might be therefore important to maintain overall genetic variability of the lion. It {{is thought that}} those lions, imported to Europe before {{the middle of the}} 19th century, were mainly either Barbary lions from North Africa or lions from the Cape.|$|E
5|$|This {{spectacular}} moth {{is considered}} one of the most impressive and beautiful Lepidoptera, rivalling almost any of the butterflies in brilliance of colouring and form.

5|$|Bottlenose {{dolphins}} {{have been}} known to hybridize with other dolphin species. Hybrids with Risso's dolphin occur both in <b>the</b> <b>wild</b> <b>and</b> in captivity. The best known is the wolphin, a false killer whale-bottlenose dolphin hybrid. The wolphin is fertile, and two currently live at the Sea Life Park in Hawaii. The first was born in 1985 to a female bottlenose. Wolphins also exist in the wild. In captivity, a bottlenose dolphin and a rough-toothed dolphin hybridized. A common dolphin-bottlenose dolphin hybrid born in captivity lives at SeaWorld California. Other hybrids live in captivity around the world and in the wild, such as a bottlenose dolphin-Atlantic spotted dolphin hybrid.|$|E
5|$|By the 1950s, {{there were}} only 200 parrots in <b>the</b> <b>wild,</b> <b>and</b> in 1975 the {{population}} reached an absolute low of 13 individuals.

But on September 18, 1989, Hurricane Hugo struck the northeast coast of Puerto Rico inflicting heavy casualties on the remaining birds. In {{the aftermath of the}} hurricane the population was estimated at 23 individuals. In 2004, the wild population was 30–35 individuals, and the long-term trend appears to be stable albeit with some fluctuations. The current range of the species is , 0.2% of what it once was.|$|E

5|$|Fighting beetles {{are used}} for {{entertainment}} and gambling. This sport exploits the territorial behavior and mating competition of certain species of large beetles. In the Chiang Mai district of northern Thailand, male Xylotrupes rhinoceros beetles are caught in <b>the</b> <b>wild</b> <b>and</b> trained for fighting. Females are held inside a log to stimulate the fighting males with their pheromones. These fights may be competitive and involve gambling both money and property. In South Korea the Dytiscidae species Cybister tripunctatus is used in a roulette-like game.|$|E
5|$|Former {{changes in}} sea levels have left {{continental}} shelves, shallow {{areas in the}} sea close to land. These nutrient-rich waters teem with life, which provide humans with substantial supplies of food—mainly fish, but also shellfish, mammals, and seaweed—which are both harvested in <b>the</b> <b>wild</b> <b>and</b> farmed. The most diverse areas surround great tropical coral reefs. Whaling in the deep sea was once common but whales' dwindling numbers prompted international conservation efforts and finally a moratorium on most commercial hunting. Oceanography has established that not all life is restricted to the sunlit surface waters: even under enormous depths and pressures, nutrients streaming from hydrothermal vents support their own unique ecosystem. Life may have started there and aquatic microbial mats are generally credited with the oxygenation of Earth's atmosphere; both plants and animals first evolved in the sea.|$|E
5|$|Horses {{have been}} present in the American West since the 1500s, when they arrived with Spanish explorers. Many escaped, were {{released}} by the Spanish or stolen by Native Americans. Their descendents crossed with horses who escaped from or were released by other European settlers, including draft breeds brought by farmers and wagoneers and lighter riding horses brought by the United States Cavalry. Horses of French descent also moved {{across the border from}} Canada to contribute to the herds. The mixture of these breeds created the Mustang present in the western portion of the US today. By the early 1970s, it was assumed that due to crossbreeding, the original Spanish stock had been eliminated from feral herds. In 1971, <b>the</b> <b>Wild</b> <b>and</b> Free-Roaming Horse and Burro Act was passed, giving the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) the authority to manage the feral horse populations in the American West.|$|E
