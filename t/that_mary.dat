5|$|At {{the end of}} {{the next}} month, Mary wants to visit Madras and the Pauls. At first Rao asks her to stay, but her {{reluctance}} makes him change his mind and he plans to lie later <b>that</b> <b>Mary</b> died after an illness. Gopalam and Ammi misunderstand, thinking <b>that</b> <b>Mary</b> is pregnant; they host a party, and Mary is confused. The night before she is due to leave, Rao pretends his leg is broken in an attempt to delay her departure. David arrives in the morning and tells Raju <b>that</b> <b>Mary,</b> a Christian, is posing as a Hindu for the job. Raju retrieves a necklace, stolen by David from Mary's house in Madras, which Mahalakshmi was wearing when she disappeared.|$|E
5|$|Imlay was in {{love with}} Percy Shelley and distraught <b>that</b> <b>Mary</b> and he had fallen in love.|$|E
5|$|It is {{possible}} <b>that</b> <b>Mary</b> Charleston {{was a part}} of the cast due to the Edwin August having been noted as working with her in Powers' productions.|$|E
60|$|The {{strength}} <b>that</b> <b>Mary's</b> indignation {{had given}} her, deserted her suddenly. Her fingers tightened {{on the back}} of the chair by her side for support.|$|R
6000|$|... "It's {{a shabby}} old dress," [...] said Katharine, {{and the only}} sign <b>that</b> <b>Mary's</b> words had reached her was that she spoke with a little jerk.|$|R
60|$|Mrs. Raimon {{remained}} {{with her and}} was so unobtrusively ready to do good <b>that</b> <b>Mary's</b> heart softened toward her--though {{she did not like}} her florid beauty and her display of jewels.|$|R
5|$|Despite his {{commitments}} to his job, raising a family, school, {{and his political}} volunteerism, Gygax continued to play wargames. It reached the point <b>that</b> <b>Mary</b> Jo, pregnant with their second child, believed he {{was having an affair}} and confronted him in a friend's basement only to discover him and his friends sitting around a map-covered table.|$|E
5|$|Esther later discovers <b>that</b> <b>Mary</b> {{has died}} in a {{motorcycle}} accident, and a grieving Sunni is transferred to Esther's private school under her grandmother's care. Ultimately deciding that being true to herself {{is more important than}} fitting in, Esther discards her pretenses and renews her friendship with Sunni.|$|E
5|$|Raju {{begins to}} suspect <b>that</b> <b>Mary</b> is the missing Mahalakshmi. When Ammi {{tells him that}} Mahalakshmi had a mole on her right foot, he plans to sneak into her room at night but the plan backfires when they awaken her. After dreaming that Rao rescues her from David, she begins {{to fall in love}} with him.|$|E
6000|$|And Harry {{was really}} glad <b>that</b> <b>Mary's</b> laugh was {{perfectly}} 'fancy free,' as she answered, 'I'm sure I hope not, but I won't promise, because {{that might be}} unreasonable, you know.' ...|$|R
2500|$|The Protestant Reformer Heinrich Bullinger {{believed}} in the assumption of Mary. His 1539 polemical treatise against idolatry expressed his belief <b>that</b> <b>Mary's</b> sacrosanctum corpus ("sacrosanct body") had been assumed into heaven by angels: ...|$|R
25|$|William of Ware and Blessed John Duns Scotus {{pointed out}} <b>that</b> <b>Mary’s</b> Immaculate Conception enhances Jesus’ redemptive work. One {{of the chief}} proponents of the {{doctrine}} was the Hungarian Franciscan Pelbartus Ladislaus of Temesvár.|$|R
5|$|Throughout Mary's childhood, Henry {{negotiated}} potential future marriages for her. When she {{was only}} two years old, she was promised to Francis, the infant son of King Francis I of France, but the contract was repudiated after three years. In 1522, {{at the age of}} six, she was instead contracted to marry her 22-year-old first cousin, Holy Roman Emperor Charles V. However, the engagement was broken off within a few years by Charles with Henry's agreement. Cardinal Wolsey, Henry's chief adviser, then resumed marriage negotiations with the French, and Henry suggested <b>that</b> <b>Mary</b> marry the Dauphin's father, King Francis I himself, who was eager for an alliance with England. A marriage treaty was signed which provided <b>that</b> <b>Mary</b> marry either Francis I or his second son Henry, Duke of Orleans, but Wolsey secured an alliance with France without the marriage.|$|E
5|$|After the rescue, onlookers applaud Hancock for his {{handling}} of the bank robbery. The superhero becomes popular again, as Ray had predicted. He goes out to dinner with Ray and Mary, with whom he reveals his apparent immortality and his amnesia stemming from an incident some 80 years prior and Ray reveals <b>that</b> <b>Mary</b> isn't Aaron's mother, who died after giving birth. After Hancock tucks a drunken Ray in bed, Hancock approaches and kisses Mary. At first, she responds passionately, but then turns angry, throwing Hancock through a wall and into the street. Hancock departs, confused at having apparently found another like himself. The next morning, Hancock arrives back at the house to demand answers from Mary. She warns him to stay away from her and her family but agrees to meet Hancock at his home to answer his questions. When she arrives, Hancock discovers <b>that</b> <b>Mary</b> also has superpowers and is apparently immortal. He threatens to expose her unless she explains their origins so she tells him that they are the last two members of a race that have lived for 3,000 years with their powers. Mary claims that they are brother and sister, which Hancock dismisses, given the nature of the previous night's kiss. Hancock realizes <b>that</b> <b>Mary</b> is not being entirely truthful and he departs to tell Ray about her. Their interaction results in a battle between Hancock and Mary that takes them to downtown Los Angeles, causing significant damage to the area. Ray, downtown in a business meeting, sees and recognizes Mary using superhero powers similar to those of Hancock. Ray departs his meeting and arrives home {{just in time to see}} Mary land in the backyard, followed closely by Hancock. She then reveals that, although he doesn't remember it, Hancock is her husband. The three then quietly go their separate ways.|$|E
5|$|Between 1818 and 1820, she absorbed a {{considerable}} amount of drama, reading many of William Shakespeare's plays, some with Percy. Percy believed <b>that</b> <b>Mary</b> had a talent for dramatic writing, and convinced her to study the great English, French, Latin, and Italian plays as well as dramatic theory. He even sought her advice on his play The Cenci, and she transcribed the manuscript of his drama Prometheus Unbound. The Shelleys also attended operas, ballets, and plays. Percy also encouraged Mary to translate Vittorio Alfieri's play Mirra (1785), a tragedy about father-daughter incest which influenced her own novel Mathilda.|$|E
6000|$|The {{knowledge}} <b>that</b> <b>Mary's</b> {{heart would}} bleed with sorrow {{if she knew}} of his condition nerved him to make another desperate trial. [...] "I'll try again to-morrow," [...] he said through his set teeth.|$|R
50|$|In May 1881, {{not long}} after Mary Seacole's death, Curtis wrote {{to the editor of}} The Times, asking <b>that</b> <b>Mary's</b> sister in Jamaica be remembered as she had fallen into near poverty after being too generous with her money.|$|R
50|$|The {{group is}} transported {{back to the}} End of Nothing, {{including}} the triad of aliens, thus providing proof <b>that</b> <b>Mary’s</b> heaven is not the real heaven. The Cardinals in the Vatican accept this evidence and the Search Program is restored.|$|R
5|$|In desperation, Mary {{decides to}} tell the truth to Gopalam and Ammi. To save their jobs, Rao makes up a far-fetched story <b>that</b> <b>Mary</b> is possessed by the soul of a Christian woman named after the mother of Jesus. Gopalam lies that he will marry Sita off to Rao. Raju, like Gopalam, is unaware of Rao's deception. In love with Sita, he wants to keep Rao away from her and turns to Mary for help in {{teaching}} music (which ends in disaster). At the end of their first month at the school, Rao and Mary receive their salaries and Mary repays her debt.|$|E
5|$|Later, Means and Black {{listen to}} McKenna reading {{a passage from}} the Bible. Afterwards, McKenna reveals that she knows {{a great deal about}} the Polaroid Man who kidnapped Black weeks earlier. Means {{receives}} a vision herself during the conversation, and becomes convinced that McKenna is a prophet of some sort. Black thinks the girl is acting out, but Means reveals that she is reciting passages from the non-canonical Gnostic Gospels, which supposed <b>that</b> <b>Mary</b> Magdalene was the only disciple to fully understand the teachings of Jesus Christ. Means believes the girls are not seeing visions of Saint Mary, but of Mary Magdalene.|$|E
5|$|Ned was so {{supportive}} {{of her career}} plans <b>that</b> <b>Mary</b> reconsidered marriage, although she knew both their parents would disapprove. With her studies completed, Mary and Ned became formally engaged at Easter in 1921, and they were married on 6 April 1922 at Toorak Presbyterian Church. They had three daughters: Mary Cecile (Molly) in 1924, Judith Ann (Judy) in 1926, and Margaret Lyle in 1933. Molly would later become a doctor like her mother.|$|E
5000|$|It emerges <b>that</b> <b>Mary's</b> mother, Diane, {{had been}} a {{promising}} mathematician, dedicated to the Navier-Stokes problem (one of the unsolved Millennium Prize Problems) before taking her own life when Mary was six months old. Mary has lived with Frank ever since.|$|R
60|$|In his own ears {{the words}} he spoke rang hollow, awkward, even impertinent. He could say nothing which did not seem hideously supercilious; and yet he wanted to abase himself! He knew <b>that</b> <b>Mary's</b> humiliation must be very, very bitter.|$|R
60|$|Well was it <b>that</b> <b>Mary's</b> {{heart was}} stout {{as well as}} tender; and instead of mentally {{magnifying}} the task, and diminishing her own capabilities, she simply felt that she had received a command, and merely asked that Ethel should be informed.|$|R
5|$|On 17 April 1555, Elizabeth was {{recalled}} {{to court}} to attend {{the final stages of}} Mary's apparent pregnancy. If Mary and her child died, Elizabeth would become queen. If, on the other hand, Mary gave birth to a healthy child, Elizabeth's chances of becoming queen would recede sharply. When it became clear <b>that</b> <b>Mary</b> was not pregnant, no one believed any longer that she could have a child. Elizabeth's succession seemed assured.|$|E
5|$|Production {{began in}} early 1954. The film was {{simultaneously}} shot in Tamil as Missiamma, with an altered cast. Missamma {{tells the story}} of two unemployed people of different religions and mentalities: M. T. Rao and Mary. They pose as a married couple to obtain jobs in a high school founded by Gopalam, the zamindar of Appapuram. As Rao and Mary fall in love, Gopalam's nephew A. K. Raju (an amateur detective) learns <b>that</b> <b>Mary</b> is Gopalam's missing elder daughter Mahalakshmi; she is unaware of her true identity.|$|E
5|$|A {{year after}} her divorce, Susan takes an {{interest}} in Mike Delfino (James Denton), a plumber who has recently moved in across the street. Susan begins dating Mike, despite competition from Edie Britt (Nicollette Sheridan). Meanwhile, Susan begins investigating Mary Alice's suicide after {{she and her friends}} discover a blackmail note addressed to her. Later, Susan discovers <b>that</b> <b>Mary</b> Alice's husband, Paul (Mark Moses), had their son, Zach (Cody Kasch), committed to a youth mental institution after he broke into the Van de Kamp house and decorated it for Christmas, Julie begins corresponding with Zach without Susan's knowledge and hides him in her room when he escapes from the institution. When Susan finds Zach in her home, she and Mike return him to Paul; however, Julie and Zach continue dating. Paul fabricates unconvincing lies to thwart Susan's efforts to discover his family's secrets too.|$|E
25|$|Dennett {{uses this}} example {{to show us}} <b>that</b> <b>Mary's</b> all-encompassing {{physical}} knowledge makes her own internal states as transparent as those of a robot or computer, and it is almost straightforward for her {{to figure out exactly}} how it feels to see red.|$|R
60|$|Then {{a silence}} fell on them. Harold {{knew that his}} plans could not be carried out with a woman for companion--and he had sense enough to know <b>that</b> <b>Mary's</b> words were born of a {{momentary}} enthusiasm. When he spoke it was with characteristic blunt honesty.|$|R
50|$|It soon {{becomes clear}} <b>that</b> <b>Mary's</b> {{not the only}} thing Don's {{forgotten}} about. It looks like both Don and Larry are in such a muddle they, and, their school, are going to lose the track meet. Once again, it's up to the girls to sort out the mess, and spur them on to victory.|$|R
5|$|Childe {{was born}} on 14 April 1892 in Sydney, New South Wales. He was the only {{surviving}} child of the Reverend Stephen Henry (1844–1923) and Harriet Eliza Childe (1853–1910), a middle-class couple of English descent. Stephen Childe was a second-generation Anglican priest, ordained into the Church of England in 1867 after gaining a BA from the University of Cambridge. Becoming a teacher, in 1871 he married Mary Ellen Latchford, together having five children. They moved to Australia in 1878. It was here <b>that</b> <b>Mary</b> died, and in 1886 Stephen married Harriet, an Englishwoman from a wealthy background who had moved to Australia as a child. Gordon Childe was raised alongside five half-siblings at his father's palatial country house, the Chalet Fontenelle, in the township of Wentworth Falls in the Blue Mountains west of Sydney. Reverend Childe worked as the minister for St. Thomas' Parish, but proved unpopular, arguing with his congregation and taking unscheduled holidays.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{overwhelming}} grief {{caused by the}} death of her two children, Mary Shelley continued to study and read as she had throughout her life. Between 1818 and 1820, she exposed herself to quite a bit of drama. She read many of William Shakespeare's plays, some with Percy Shelley. Percy believed <b>that</b> <b>Mary</b> had a talent for drama and convinced her to study the great English, French, Latin, and Italian plays as well as drama theory. He even sought her advice regarding his play The Cenci. Less glamorously, Mary transcribed the manuscript of Percy's drama Prometheus Unbound. The Shelleys also attended operas, ballets, and plays.|$|E
5|$|In 1869, John and Agnes Macdonald had a daughter, Mary. It {{soon became}} {{apparent}} <b>that</b> <b>Mary</b> had ongoing developmental issues. She {{was never able}} to walk, nor did she ever fully develop mentally. Hewitt Bernard, Deputy Minister of Justice and Macdonald's former secretary, also lived in the Macdonald house in Ottawa, together with Bernard's widowed mother. In May 1870, John Macdonald fell ill with gallstones; coupled with his frequent drinking, he may have developed a severe case of acute pancreatitis. In July, he moved to Prince Edward Island to convalesce, most likely conducting discussions aimed at drawing the island into Confederation at a time when some there supported joining the United States. The island joined Confederation in 1873.|$|E
50|$|Sometime in late 1900 or 1901, Mary and Jacob moved once again, to McMinnville, Tennessee. It was there, in 1905, <b>that</b> <b>Mary’s</b> beloved husband Jacob died. In {{keeping with}} his wishes, Mary had his body brought to Stones River National Cemetery, the former {{battlefield}} {{on which he}} had been wounded years before, for burial.|$|R
60|$|A low, {{whispering}} murmur that swelled {{like a wave}} {{ran through}} the hall. And by it Shefford divined, as clearly as if the fact had been blazoned on the walls, <b>that</b> <b>Mary's</b> face had been unknown to these villagers. But the name Sago Lily had not been unknown; Shefford heard it whispered on all sides.|$|R
5000|$|Mary {{is a new}} {{student at}} the all girls' {{boarding}} school, and dorms with Paulie and Victoria. In {{an effort to get}} the shy Mary to break out of her shell, Paulie and Tori involve her in their activities, such as running in the mornings. When they hear <b>that</b> <b>Mary's</b> mother has died, Paulie nicknames her [...] "Mary Brave." ...|$|R
