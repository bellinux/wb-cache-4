30|$|<b>Trichothecenes</b> are {{a series}} of mycotoxins {{produced}} by several fungi, with genera including Fusarium, Mycothecium, Trichoderma, Trichothecium, Stachybotrys and Cephalosporium [9, 10].

40|$|<b>Trichothecenes</b> are mycotoxins {{commonly}} found in cereals. The toxins are mainly produced by Fusarium fungi, which infect cereals in the field. <b>Trichothecenes</b> {{have been associated with}} outbreaks of diseases both in humans and in farm animals. <b>Trichothecenes</b> are closely related toxins based on a C- 15 skeleton with an epoxide ring. The microbiological transformation of <b>trichothecenes</b> to the less toxic de-epoxide in the gut has been studied in this thesis. It was found that the micro-organisms in faeces from pigs in the Uppsala area had the ability to transform the <b>trichothecenes</b> nivalenol (NIV) and deoxynivalenol (DON) to their corresponding de-epoxy metabolites. The pig intestinal micro-organisms did not acquire the de-epoxidation ability during a seven week long exposure to low levels of DON in the feed, but the ability was transferred between animals by spreading faeces from pigs with an intestinal de-epoxidation ability in the pens of pigs lacking this ability. The faecal micro-organisms in humans were not able to transform <b>trichothecenes</b> to their de-epoxy metabolite. The de-epoxides of NIV and DON were shown to be 51 and 24 times less cytotoxic than the corresponding toxin with an intact epoxide ring, verifying that the de-epoxidation is a detoxification of <b>trichothecenes.</b> The absorption, metabolism and excretion of 3 -acetylDON in pigs with a known intestinal de-epoxidation ability were also studied. The toxin was rapidly deacetylated and absorbed into the blood. DON was detected in plasma from 20 minutes after feeding. A maximum plasma concentration of 51. 9 ± 6. 8 ng/ml was reached three hours after feeding. The toxin was rapidly excreted and the DON concentration in plasma declined rapidly after reaching the peak concentration. No accumulation occurred in plasma during the three days exposure period. No de-epoxy DON was present in plasma or urine, indicating that the de-epoxidation of <b>trichothecenes</b> occurs in the distal parts of the gastrointestinal tract where the absorption is low. DON and conjugated DON were the only metabolites detected in plasma and urine, while de-epoxy DON and DON were detected in faeces. Studies where the <b>trichothecenes</b> DON, NIV and T- 2 - toxin were given to farm animals via their feed have been reviewed. It was concluded that pigs are more sensitive to <b>trichothecenes</b> in feed than other farm animals. Guideline limits of 0. 3 mg DON and 0. 2 mg T- 2 /HT- 2 toxins/kg feed are proposed to ensure that no negative effects will occur in pigs. Similarly, guideline values of 0. 5 mg T 2 /HT- 2 toxins and 2. 5 mg DON/kg feed are proposed in chicken feed. Ruminants are more resistant to <b>trichothecenes</b> and no guideline value is proposed for feed for ruminants...|$|R
40|$|<b>Trichothecenes</b> are mycotoxins {{produced}} by several fungal genera, mainly Fusarium species, that can contaminate {{a wide range}} of cereals used for human and animal consumption. They are associated with various adverse health effects in animals and humans such as feed refusal, vomiting and immunotoxic effects. A method based on capillary gas chromatography with mass spectrometric detection was developed and validated in-house for the determination of nine <b>trichothecenes</b> in duplicate diets of young children. The <b>trichothecenes</b> were extracted from the sample matrix by water/ethanol (90 / 10). The extracts were cleaned by means of ChemElut(R) and Mycosep(R) columns. The cleaned extracts were evaporated to dryness and derivatized to trimethylsilyl ethers at room temperature. The residues were dissolved in iso-octane and washed with water. The final extracts were analysed for <b>trichothecenes</b> by GC-MS. The response was linear in the range tested (1 - 10 mg kg(- 1)). Recoveries for the <b>trichothecenes</b> were between 70 and 111 %, with the exception of nivalenol, which had a low recovery (34 %). The limit of quantification for all <b>trichothecenes</b> was below 0. 4 mg kg(- 1). Seventy-four food samples from young children collected by 74 respondents in a duplicate diet study were analysed for <b>trichothecenes</b> with the developed method. The mean levels of deoxynivalenol, nivalenol, HT- 2 toxin and T- 2 toxin were 5. 8, 0. 3, 0. 3 and 0. 1 mug kg(- 1), respectively. Based on the individual results, dietary intake calculations were made. For deoxynivalenol, the tolerable daily intake of 1 mug kg(- 1) body weight was exceeded by nine respondents. For the combined intake of T- 2 and HT- 2 toxin, the temporary tolerable daily intake of 0. 06 mg kg(- 1) body weight was exceeded by nine respondents...|$|R
50|$|This {{group of}} {{structurally}} related mycotoxins {{has a strong}} impact {{on the health of}} animals and humans. Trichothecenes are powerful inhibitors of protein synthesis. They do this by reacting with components of the ribosomes: the structure within the cell where proteins are made. The specific site of action of T-2 toxin, which is a reaction with a critical site on the ribosomal RNA (rRNA), is known. Protein synthesis is an essential function in all tissues, but tissues where cells are actively and rapidly growing and dividing are very susceptible to the toxins.Trichothecenes are different from most other potential weapons toxins because they can act through the skin. Compared with some of the other mycotoxins such as aflatoxin, the trichothecenes do not appear to require metabolic activation to exert their biological activity. After direct dermal application or oral ingestion, the <b>trichothecene</b> mycotoxins can cause rapid irritation to the skin or intestinal mucosa. In cell-free systems or single cells in culture, these mycotoxins cause a rapid inhibition of protein synthesis and polyribosomal disaggregation. Thus, we can postulate that the <b>trichothecene</b> mycotoxins have molecular capability of direct reaction with cellular components. Despite this direct effect, it is possible to measure the toxicokinetics and the metabolism of the <b>trichothecene</b> mycotoxins.|$|E
50|$|When {{compared}} to other <b>trichothecene</b> mycotoxins which can form in grains and forages, vomitoxin is relatively mild. Reduced feed intake, with its accompanying decrease in performance, is the only symptom of vomitoxin toxicity livestock producers will likely encounter. This response to vomitoxin appears to occur through the central nervous system.|$|E
50|$|Satratoxin-H, a <b>trichothecene</b> mycotoxin, is a {{naturally}} occurring toxin {{produced by the}} ascomycetes Stachybotrys chartarum and Podostroma cornu-damae which is toxic to humans and animals.

50|$|Because it is a <b>trichothecene,</b> it has {{significant}} toxicity. If swallowed by humans, the initial symptoms are general discomfort, dry eyes, and drowsiness.

40|$|Stationary liquid {{cultures}} of Fusarium tricinctum NRRL 3299 (synonym: F. sporotrichioides) produce T- 2 toxin, neosolaniol, diacetoxyscirpenol, and HT- 2 toxin when cultured on peptone-enriched Czapek Dox medium. At 15 and 27 °C, maximum T- 2 toxin yield (265 and 50 μg/ml) was found after 10 to 14 and 7 days, respectively. The T- 2 toxin {{in the culture}} medium was metabolized rapidly at 27 °C and slowly at 15 °C. Addition of 0. 025 % (wt/vol) sorbic acid to the medium resulted in an increased production of <b>trichothecenes</b> at 15 °C (400 μg of T- 2 per ml after 14 days). <b>Trichothecenes</b> in the culture liquid were determined by the brine shrimp bioassay and physicochemical analysis. The brine shrimp assay was improved by using modern bioassay equipment, including tissue culture trays and multipipettes, and by a standardized approach with positive and negative controls. The physicochemical analysis was based on adsorption of the <b>trichothecenes</b> onto Amberlite XAD- 2 columns, derivatization with trifluoroacetic anhydride followed by capillary gas chromatography, and identification by mass spectrometry (as many as 17 <b>trichothecenes</b> were detected in the culture medium). The brine shrimp assay offers an interesting monitoring system for the quantitation of T- 2 toxin and should be useful for studies on production of this toxin in culture. Specific information on less toxic <b>trichothecenes,</b> however, requires a more time-consuming chemical analysis...|$|R

This study is also the first to report the function of tri 3 in Trichoderma, and the results confirmed the previous hypothesis on the tri 3 function in the biosynthesis of <b>trichothecenes.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{poisoning}} {{symptoms are}} similar to those observed previously with animals that had consumed <b>trichothecene</b> mycotoxins. Japanese researchers detected the presence of the macrocyclic trichothecenes satratoxin H, satratoxin H 12′,13′-diacetate, satratoxin H 12′-acetate, and satratoxin H 13′-acetate. When grown in liquid culture the fungus additionally produces roridin E, verrucarin J, and satratoxin H. With the exception of verrucarin J, a 0.5 milligram dose of all of these compounds, when injected into the abdomen of mice, will result in their death the following day.|$|E
50|$|The use of <b>trichothecene</b> mycotoxins as {{biological}} weapons has been suspected {{in the case}} of the controversial Soviet air attacks on several Southeast Asian countries in the 1970s and 1980s, referred to as the yellow rain attacks. Although whether or not intentional biological warfare actually took place remains unclear, soil analyses of the affected areas indicate the presence of above-normal levels of tricothecenes, as well as types of tricothecenes that are not usually produced by naturally occurring microorganisms in the area.|$|E

5000|$|Trichothecenes: The trichothecenes {{constitute}} {{a family of}} more than sixty sesquiterpenoid metabolites produced {{by a number of}} fungal genera, including Fusarium, Myrothecium, Phomopsis, Stachybotrys, Trichoderma, Trichothecium, and others. The term <b>trichothecene</b> is derived from trichothecin, which was the one of the first members of the family identified. All trichothecenes contain a common 12,13-epoxytrichothene skeleton and an olefinic bond with various side chain substitutions.
