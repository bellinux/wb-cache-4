25|$|Vanderbilt {{eventually}} had to {{sell his}} ferry service to Law after a franchise battle. After the battle, Vanderbilt lost interest in the <b>transit</b> <b>operations</b> on Staten Island and he handed {{the operations of the}} ferry and railroad over to his brother, Jacob H. Vanderbilt, who was the president of the company until 1883. In March 1864, Vanderbilt bought Law's ferries, bringing both the railroad and the ferries under the same company. In 1865, the railway took over the operation of the New York & Richmond Ferry Company and would later assume direct responsibility for operating the ferry service to Manhattan too. Under the leadership of Jacob Vanderbilt, the Staten Island Rail Road took over the Perth Amboy Ferry and the Staten Island Ferry, and train service was increased.|$|E
25|$|Tompkins County became {{involved}} in supporting suburban routes and in developing rural transit service. The County formed TOMTRAN to extend fixed-route bus service to Dryden, Caroline and Newark Valley in 1982, Groton (1983), Newfield and Ulysses (1985), and Lansing and Danby (1991). In 1999, TCAT initiated bus service to Enfield, the last unserved town in the County. In 1992, the City, Cornell and County built a $5 million transit facility to base <b>transit</b> <b>operations</b> and fleet maintenance including GADABOUT. In 1996, the New York State Legislature adopted a state law that authorized TCAT to be created as a joint partnership, governmental entity, and on April 1, 1998, the City of Ithaca, Cornell University and Tompkins County established TCAT as a joint venture (public entity) to operate public transit service in Tompkins County, service began in 1999, establishing a unified route and fare system. TCAT re-organized itself as a 501(c)(3) nonprofit corporation, TCAT. Inc. in 2005 with representatives of City of Ithaca, Cornell University, and Tompkins County serving on its Board of Directors.|$|E
25|$|The Staten Island Railway {{opened in}} stages in 1860. It was {{necessary}} to have a direct connection between the new railroad trains and the infrequent ferries to and from Manhattan, but {{this turned out to}} be difficult during the beginning of operation. The ferries serving Vanderbilt's Landing were owned by George Law, who operated the rival New York and Staten Island Steam Ferry. Afterwards, Vanderbilt tried to operate a ferry service between Manhattan and Staten Island that would compete with the ferry service owned by Law. Vanderbilt started construction on his plan for a central dock on the island, but he abandoned the scheme after a storm destroyed the timber work. Only the large stone foundation remained; this was still visible in 1900 at low tide. A long franchise battle ensued, resulting in Vanderbilt selling his ferry service to Law in 1862. Vanderbilt subsequently lost interest in the <b>transit</b> <b>operations</b> on Staten Island and he handed the operations of the ferry and railroad over to his brother, Jacob Vanderbilt, who was the president of the company until 1883. In March 1864, Vanderbilt bought Law's ferries, bringing both the railroad and the ferries under the same company. The railway assumed the Staten Island and New York Ferry Company's operations in 1865.|$|E
40|$|In any context, {{operation}} and management of transportation systems are key issues which may affect both life quality and economic development. In large urban agglomerations, an efficient public transportation system may help abate the negative externalities of private car use such as congestion, air and noise pollution, accident and fuel consumption, without excessively penalizing user travel times or zone accessibility. Thus, this study is conducted to appraise the Malaysian rural rail <b>transit</b> <b>operation</b> and management system, which are considered important as there are many issues and solution in integration of the services {{that need to be}} tackled more conscientiously. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to describe some of the most important issues on integration of services and rail transit system in Malaysian and how to solve or reduce these problems and conflicts. In this paper, it consists of the historical development of rail transit construction in Malaysia. This paper also attempts to identify the important issues related to rail transit services and integration in Malaysian rural rail {{operation and}} management system. Comparison is also conducted with other countries such as UK, France, Germany, The Netherlands, Switzerland and Japan. Finally, a critical analysis is presented in this paper by looking at the possible application for future Malaysian rail <b>transit</b> <b>operation</b> system and management, especially focusing on enhancing the quality of Malaysian rural rail transit. In conclusion, this paper is expected to successfully review and appraise the existing Malaysian rural rail <b>transit</b> <b>operation</b> and management system pertaining to issues & solution in integration. It is also hoped that reformation or transformation of present service delivery quality of the rail <b>transit</b> <b>operation</b> and management will enable Malaysia to succeed in transforming Malaysian transportation system to greater height...|$|R

25|$|On April 3, 1883, the Staten Island Rapid Transit Railroad Company {{gained control}} of the Staten Island Railway and its boats. The Baltimore & Ohio Railroad (B) {{obtained}} control of the Staten Island Railway Ferry Company's operations the next year. A controlling interest in the Railway Ferry Company was obtained by the B in 1885 through purchases of stock. On November 21, 1885, Robert Garrett, President of the B, leased the Railway Ferry Company to the B for 99 years. The B could now provide service to a ferry terminal that was closer to Manhattan public transit. Rather than having passengers transfer to the Central Railroad of New Jersey (CNJ)'s ferries from the Jersey City Terminal to the Liberty Street Ferry Terminal in Manhattan, which was not close to any elevated rail stations in the area, the B could now operate to the Whitehall Street terminal, {{where there was a}} direct transfer to an elevated station. Garrett resigned from his position at the B in 1887, and his successors did not show as much interest in Staten Island <b>transit</b> <b>operations.</b> Wiman lost {{a lot of money in}} the Panic of 1893, and two years later, much of his property was auctioned to pay off debts.|$|E
25|$|The fare hikes did not {{effectively}} increase {{revenue for}} the Board of Transportation to offset increasing operation costs, while system ridership plateaued due to the American car culture and increasing migration to the suburbs. After two years of financial surplus, the BOT experienced a $1.2 million deficit in 1950, and a $24.8 million deficit in 1952. The BOT was also criticized due {{to the influence of}} politics on the organization, the direct control over the board by the mayor, {{and the use of the}} city's operating budget to subsidize <b>transit</b> <b>operations.</b> In March 1953, the New York State Legislature created the New York City Transit Authority (NYCTA), a public authority without direct control from a political office, with members appointed by both the Governor and Mayor. Governor Dewey signed the bill approving the creation of the TA into law on March 20, 1953. On June 15, 1953, operation of the New York City Transit System was turned over to the Transit Authority, with the Board of Estimate leasing the system to the TA for a period of ten years. The Board of Transportation, meanwhile, was dissolved. The new Transit Authority was modeled after the existing Port Authority of New York and New Jersey and Triborough Bridge and Tunnel Authority, the latter of which is also now part of the MTA.|$|E
