The model was tested with transition free and with <b>transition</b> <b>fixed</b> at 5 percent chord {{for both the}} upper and the lower surfaces. The data obtained were analyzed {{for the effects of}} Reynolds number, <b>transition</b> <b>fixing</b> and Mach number. The role of the boundary layer on the displacement effect, the interaction with the shock wave and the trailing edge separation are examined. The results are summarized as follows: (1) the airfoil performance depends strongly on Reynolds number and transition fixing; (2) with <b>transition</b> <b>fixed,</b> the aerodynamic quantities such as lift, pitching moment and drag show a monotonic variation with Reynolds number; (3) with transition free, the aerodynamic quantities vary less regularly with Reynolds number and a slight parametric dependency is shown. The weak dependency is due to the compensatory effect of the forward shift of the transition position and the thinning of the turbulent boundary layer as Reynolds number increases; (4) the shock Mach number and the shock position are weakly dependent on Reynolds number; and (5) the long extent of the laminar boundary layer at transonic speeds reduces the drag appreciably at low Reynolds numbers.

40|$|Recently it {{has been}} shown that the thermal {{holographic}} fluctuations can give rise to an almost scale invariant spectrum of metric perturbations since in this scenario the energy is proportional to the area of the boundary rather than the volume. Here we calculate the non-Gaussianity of the spectrum of cosmological fluctuations in holographic phase, which can imprint on the radiation dominated universe by an abrupt transition. We find that if the matter is phantom-like, the non-Gaussianity f_NL^equil can reach O(1) or even be larger than O(1). Especially in the limit ω→ - 5 / 3, the non-Gaussianity is very large and negative.
