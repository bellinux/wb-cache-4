5|$|The Keynesian Revolution was {{associated}} with the rise of modern liberalism in the West during the post-war period. Keynesian ideas became so popular that some scholars point to Keynes as representing <b>the</b> <b>ideals</b> of modern liberalism, as Adam Smith represented <b>the</b> <b>ideals</b> of classical liberalism. After the war, Winston Churchill attempted to check the rise of Keynesian policy-making in the United Kingdom and used rhetoric critical of the mixed economy in his 1945 election campaign. Despite his popularity as a war hero, Churchill suffered a landslide defeat to Clement Attlee whose government's economic policy continued to be influenced by Keynes's ideas.|$|E

5|$|Burne-Jones's {{paintings}} were one strand in the evolving tapestry of Aestheticism from the 1860s through the 1880s, which considered that art should be valued {{as an object}} of beauty engendering a sensual response, rather than for the story or moral implicit in the subject matter. In many ways this was antithetical to <b>the</b> <b>ideals</b> of Ruskin and the early Pre-Raphaelites.|$|E

5|$|In the 19th century, Philippine ports {{opened to}} world trade and shifts started {{occurring}} within Filipino society.

50|$|It is {{possible}} to create a single structure that contains both <b>the</b> <b>ideal</b> (production steps), and the real one (components, assemblies), called technological structure: to the nodes of <b>the</b> <b>ideal</b> structure, known as idealnodes, there are links to the nodes of the real structure, called real nodes, used in the production step mapped by <b>the</b> <b>ideal</b> node. If <b>the</b> considered <b>ideal</b> node is a leaf of <b>the</b> <b>ideal</b> structure, it {{is linked to the}} entire real subgraph that expresses the composition of the real node used in its production step; otherwise it binds only the single real node used, while his components are linked to <b>the</b> <b>ideal</b> nodes of <b>the</b> subgraph which describes the production steps.

5|$|About 40 {{years after}} {{nationalisation}} British Rail was privatised {{and the old}} name was revived by Great Western Trains, the train operating company providing passenger services on the old GWR routes to South Wales and the South West, which subsequently became First Great Western {{as part of the}} FirstGroup but in September 2015 changed its name to Great Western Railway in order to 'reinstate <b>the</b> <b>ideals</b> of our founder'. The operating infrastructure, however, was transferred to Railtrack and has since passed to Network Rail. These companies have continued to preserve appropriate parts of its stations and bridges so historic GWR structures can still be recognised around the network.|$|E

5|$|According to {{the book}} by Nationalmuseum, the {{controversy}} concerned Carl Larsson's personal prestige and <b>the</b> <b>ideals</b> that he stood for, but his contemporaries would turn more and more indifferent to these ideals. The events embittered his last years and he declared in his autobiography that the controversy broke him down and that he admitted it with anger. It is clear {{that he began to}} identify himself with the work and it is possible that he also identified himself with the sacrificed king, as he primarily saw conspiracies and bad intentions behind the opposition. This identification was made apparent in his self-portrait, in 1916, where he presented himself as king Domalde, and which he donated to Sundborn parish where he lived.|$|E
5|$|After {{the death}} of Periyar in 1973, {{conferences}} were held throughout Tamil Nadu for a week in January 1974. The same year Periyar's wife, Maniyammai, {{the new head of}} the Dravidar Kazhagam, set fire to the effigies of 'Rama', 'Sita' and 'Lakshmana' at Periyar Thidal, Madras. This was in retaliation to the Ramaleela celebrations where effigies of 'Ravana', 'Kumbakarna' and 'Indrajit' were burnt in New Delhi. For this act she was imprisoned. During the 1974 May Day meetings held at different places in Tamil Nadu, a resolution urging the Government to preserve 80 percent of jobs for Tamils was passed. Soon after this, a camp was held at Periyar Mansion in Tiruchirapalli to train young men and women to spread <b>the</b> <b>ideals</b> of the Dravidar Kazhagam in rural areas.|$|E
5|$|Another blow to Soviet {{communism}} in the First World {{came with the}} establishment of eurocommunism. Eurocommunists espoused and supported <b>the</b> <b>ideals</b> of Soviet communism {{while at the same time}} supporting rights of the individual. The largest obstacle was that it was the largest communist parties, those with highest electoral turnout, which became eurocommunists. Originating with the Prague Spring, this new thinking made the First World more skeptical of Soviet {{communism in}} general. The Italian Communist Party notably declared that should war break out in Europe, they would rally to the defense of Italy and resist any Soviet incursion on their nation's soil.|$|E
40|$|We {{employed}} the Born-Hill-Milstein elastic-stability theory {{with the aid}} of molecular statics and density functional theory simulations to investigate the effect of transverse loading on <b>the</b> <b>ideal</b> tensile strength of six face-centered-cubic materials. <b>The</b> <b>ideal</b> strengths of <b>the</b> materials were found to be largely dependent on the transverse loadings.
