A secondary objective wasto deduce the impact attenuation correction has on thedetected counts originating from bone covered by themetal implant. Methods A phantom was constructed to allow assessment of counts obtained from a point source (PS) imaged in thevicinity of a hip resurfacing implant. Three implant cup sizes (4, 8 and 10) were assessed and images acquired with a PS positioned adjacent to the implant pin and under the cup.

40|$|Aim: The aim of {{this study}} is to {{evaluate}} the effect of soft tissue composition on dose distribution and spread-out Bragg peak (SOBP) characteristics in proton therapy. Subjects and Methods: Proton beams with nominal energies of 70, 120 and 210 MeV were considered. The soft <b>tissues</b> and <b>tissue</b> <b>equivalent</b> <b>materials</b> implemented in this study are: 9 -component soft tissue, 4 -component soft tissue, adipose tissue, muscle (skeletal), lung tissue, breast tissue, A- 150 <b>tissue</b> <b>equivalent</b> plastic, perspex and water. Each material was separately defined inside a 20 cm × 20 cm × 40 cm phantom. A multilayer phantom was evaluated as well. The effect of tissue composition on the relative dose in SOBP region (relative to the dose in SOBP region in water), range of SOBP, length of SOBP, and uniformity index of SOBP was evaluated. Results: Various soft <b>tissues</b> and <b>tissue</b> <b>equivalent</b> <b>materials</b> have shown different dose level in SOBPs, ranges of SOBPs, lengths of SOBPs and uniformity indices. Conclusions: Based on the obtained results, various soft <b>tissues</b> and <b>tissue</b> <b>equivalent</b> <b>materials</b> have quite different SOBP characteristics. Since in clinical practice with proton therapy, only the range of SOBP is corrected for various tissues, omission of the above effects may result in major discrepancies in proton beam radiotherapy.

40|$|AbstractAs {{a part of}} the Alteino Long Term Cosmic Ray {{measurements}} on board the International Space Station (ALTCRISS) project, the shielding effect of polyethylene (PE) were evaluated in the Russian segment of the ISS, using active and passive dosimeter systems covered with or without PE shielding. For the passive dosimeter system, PADLES (Passive Dosimeter for Life-Science and Experiments in Space) was used in the project, which consists of a Thermo-Luminescent Dosimeters (TLD) and CR- 39 Plastic Nuclear Track Detectors (PNTDs) attached to a radiator. Not only CR- 39 PNTD itself but also a <b>tissue</b> <b>equivalent</b> <b>material,</b> NAN-JAERI, were employed as the radiator in order to investigate whether CR- 39 PNTD {{can be used as a}} surrogate of <b>tissue</b> <b>equivalent</b> <b>material</b> in space dosimetry or not. The agreements between the doses measured by PADLES with CR- 39 PNTD and NAN-JAERI radiators were quite satisfactorily, indicating the tissue-equivalent dose can be measured by conventional PADLES even though CR- 39 PNTD is not perfect tissue-equivalent material. It was found that the shielding effect of PE varies with location inside the spacecraft: it became less significant with an increase of the mean thickness of the wall. This tendency was also verified by Monte Carlo simulation using the PHITS code.

40|$|The {{goal of this}} {{research}} was to investigate the feasibility of using a weighted dual-energy subtraction method in dedicated breast CT using quasi-monochromatic x-ray beams, to better distinguish soft tissues in the breast. This research used computer simulations and measurements, includes development of protocols and phantoms, and yields quantitative results and physical components. Quasi-monochromatic beams were created using different specially processed, hermetically sealed ultra-thick K-edge filters yielding a maximum mean energy difference of 7 keV; also, different kVp potentials on the x-ray tube were used with higher atomic number filters, yielding a maximum mean energy difference of 11 keV. A cylindrical phantom containing muscle <b>tissue</b> <b>equivalent</b> <b>material,</b> glandular <b>tissue</b> <b>equivalent</b> <b>material,</b> polyethylene, and acrylic was filled with methanol (adipose tissue equivalent) was developed and scanned to investigate dual-energy contrast enhancement of the different materials. The CT scans were acquired using a dual-modality SPECT-CT system for dedicated breast imaging. The weighted dual-energy subtraction method is adapted from dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry, where a high and low energy CT scan is acquired using two different ultra-thick k-edge filters (or tube potentials) and the data is reconstructed. Region of interest values are obtained from each image, which is then multiplied by a weighted value (k), and the higher energy image is subtracted from the lower energy image to achieve contrast enhancement. The k-values were calculated from the ratio of measured attenuation coefficients for the material to be subtracted. In a projection-noise normalized acquisition scenario, it was found that weighted dual-energy subtraction with quasi-monochromatic beams might not be feasible under the current circumstances due to the especially high noise (poor contrast to noise ratios) and poor contrast. While this was not an optimized scenario, the approach does have promise, indicating that more investigation is needed. Thesi...|$|E

40|$|Microcalcification {{is one of}} the {{earliest}} and main indicators of breast cancer. Because dual-energy digital mammography could suppress the contrast between the adipose and glandular tissues of the breast, it is considered a promising technique that will improve the detection of microcalcification. In dual-energy digital mammography, the imaged object is a human breast, while in calibration measurements only the phantoms of breast <b>tissue</b> <b>equivalent</b> <b>materials</b> are available. Consequently, the differences between phantoms and breast tissues will lead to calibration phantom errors. Based on the dual-energy imaging model, formulae of calibration phantom errors are derived in this paper. Then, this type of error is quantitatively analyzed using publicly available data and compared with other types of error. The results demonstrate that the calibration phantom error is large and dominant in dual-energy mammography, seriously decreasing calculation precision. Further investigations on the physical meaning of calibration phantom error reveal that the imaged objects with the same glandular ratio have identical calibration phantom error.

40|$|Background: Many cancer {{patients}} who require {{external beam radiotherapy}} such as breast {{cancer patients}}, present with irregular surface topographies and tissue inhomogenieties in the treatment field. Such irregularities give rise to unacceptable dose non-uniformity. Standard fields cannot be applied without compensation for missing tissue. 1 -D and 2 -D missing tissue compensators can be used but they have limitations. 3 -D compensators are the most effective but they are normally fabricated using very expensive automated systems. Objectives: To study the variation of linear attenuation coefficients of different materials in megavoltage photon beams, select a <b>tissue</b> <b>equivalent</b> compensating <b>material</b> and commission a local 3 -D manual missing tissue compensator cutter. Methods and materials: Linear attenuation coefficients were measured for tin, River sand mix, Lincolnshire bolus and dental modelling wax for different energy megavoltage photon beams. Measurements were done in a water phantom using a cylindrical ionisation chamber at varying depths. The CT numbers and densities of the materials were also measured. Negative plaster of paris moulds of the breast and head and neck areas were made using a RANDOTM Alderson anthropomorphic phantom from typically simulated fields. 3 -D missing tissue compensators were then fabricated on the manual cutter and were tested for their effectiveness during treatment delivery. Results: Linear attenuation coefficients were dependent on photon beam energy, the thickness and density of the attenuator, but independent of the depth of measurement for compensator thickness of more than 2 cm. Lincolnshire bolus and dental modelling wax with CT numbers of – 78 ± 9 and - 88 ± 18 and densities of 1. 4 ± 0. 0 g/cm 3 and 0. 9 ± 0. 0 g/cm 3 respectively {{can be regarded as}} <b>tissue</b> <b>equivalent</b> <b>materials.</b> The fabricated 3 -D missing tissue compensators were effective in correcting for dose non-uniformities compared to fields with no beam-modifying devices or wedges (1 -D compensators).

However, the calculated results depend on the models used in the codes, and it is therefore necessary to verify their validity by comparison with measured data. The goal of this paper is to compare absorbed doses obtained in the MATROSHKA-R experiment performed at the International Space Station (ISS) with simulations performed with the three-dimensional Monte Carlo Particle and Heavy-Ion Transport code System (PHITS).

Using a simplified geometrical model of the ISS, the influence of variations in altitude and wall mass thickness of the ISS on the calculated absorbed dose was estimated.

The anthropomorphic phantom, which is sliced into four segments in the cranio-caudal direction, is composed of <b>tissue</b> <b>equivalent</b> <b>materials</b> and contains a titanium implant in a vertebral body in the cervical region. GafChromic® films were laid between the different segments to measure the 2 D delivered dose. Three different four-field plans have then been applied: a Single-Field-Uniform-Dose (SFUD) plan, both with and without artifact correction implemented, and an Intensity-Modulated-Proton-Therapy (IMPT) plan with the artifacts corrected. For corrections, the artifacts were manually outlined and the Hounsfield Units manually set to an average value for soft tissue. Results show a surprisingly good agreement between prescribed and delivered dose distributions when artifacts have been corrected, with > 97 % and 98 % of points fulfilling the gamma criterion of 3 %/ 3 mm for both SFUD and the IMPT plans, respectively. In contrast, without artifact corrections, up to 18 % of measured points fail the gamma criterion of 3 %/ 3 mm for the SFUD plan.

The shell is printed and subsequently filled with silicone rubber to make the bolus. Before clinical implementation we performed a planning study with 11 patients to evaluate the difference in tumour coverage between the designed 3 D-print bolus and the clinically delivered plan with manually created bolus. For the first 15 clinical patients a second CT scan with the 3 D-print bolus was performed to verify the geometrical accuracy.

This thesis investigates several aspects of an emission-transmission SPECT system using the Monte Carlo method and experimental techniques. The system {{was based on a}} rotating gamma camera fitted with a parallel hole collimator. The simulation of a transmission study was performed using a simple non-uniform mathematical phantom with two different external sources, a collimated line source and a flood source. The results showed that the attenuation maps were highly dependent on the geometry and photon energy of the source. The collimated line source produced improved image quality with lower statistical noise than the flood source. The results showed that, when high atomic number elements are present in the tissue composition, the attenuation coefficients at different energies are related through a second order polynomial transformation. If the object under study is formed of soft <b>tissue</b> <b>equivalent</b> <b>materials,</b> a linear transformation holds. The attenuation maps generated in the transmission study were used to correct for non-uniform attenuation compensation of an emission phantom.

The purpose of this project is to understand the uncertainties in proton therapy treatment planning for the IROC-H proton phantom QA program due to variations in CT technique and proton energy. It was hypothesized that variations in CT technique and proton energy will alter the delivered dose distributions of typical proton treatments by reducing the percent of passing pixels by 10 % using a gamma analysis criteria of ± 3 %/ 5 mm as measured using a heterogeneous proton QA phantom. A CT phantom used by IROC-H during therapy site visits was scanned using three CT techniques (80, 120, 140 kV) with a CT scanner used for proton therapy simulations and irradiated with a passively scattered beam at three energies (140, 200, 250 MeV) to measure, respectively, HU and Relative Linear Stopping Power (RLSP) {{in order to create}} HU to RLSP calibration curves for comparison with reference curves as defined by this study. The phantom has proton <b>equivalent</b> <b>materials</b> {{with a wide variety of}} HU and RLSPs to allow for the creation of a calibration curve for common <b>tissue</b> <b>equivalent</b> <b>materials.</b> Treatment plans were created for an anthropomorphic proton lung phantom using the various CT technique/ beam energy calibration curves to determine the differences in the dose distributions by performing a gamma analysis. The 3 D gamma analysis resulted in a pass rate of 100 % for all plans and the 2 D gamma analysis resulted in a pass rate above 99 %. This result implied the varying treatment plans did not substantially affect the outcome of the dose comparison and therefore rejects the stated hypothesis and further work is needed to investigate the uncertainty present in this QA process...|$|R
30|$|For this planar {{dosimetry}} method {{based on}} the conjugate view method, anterior and posterior planar images were acquired at 2, 24, 48 and 168  h post-injection (p.i.). A SPECT/CT was acquired 24  h p.i. for calibration purposes. The gamma cameras were a Picker IRIX (Marconi, Phillips, Holland) and a Millennium VG Hawkeye (General Electric Medical Systems, Milwaukee, WI, USA) equipped with medium energy parallel-hole collimators. Planar whole-body scans were performed with a scanning time of 10  min and a 20  % energy window over the 208 -keV photon peak. Measurement over the 113 -keV photon peak was omitted due to the high scattering fraction in the data. No further scatter correction {{was included in the}} protocol. The SPECT image acquisition used the same energy setting and was performed with 30 -s frame duration for 120 projections. The CT images were acquired using 140 -kV tube voltage, 2.5  mAs, and a rotation speed of 2.6  rpm. SPECT reconstructions were performed using the ordered subset expectation maximum (OSEM) algorithm with two iterations, 10 subsets and post-filtering. No scattering window was used. The effective attenuation coefficient and the sensitivity for the gamma cameras were determined by scintigraphy of a planar 177 Lu source placed at different depths in a phantom of <b>tissue</b> <b>equivalent</b> <b>material.</b> A region of interest was drawn around the source in the planar images and the counts recorded after which a monoexponential curve was fitted to the number of counts versus depth data.|$|E
40|$|International audienceRecent {{developments}} of new therapy techniques using small photon beams, such as stereotactic radiotherapy, require new detectors to precisely determine the delivered dose. The dosimeter {{has to be}} {{as close as possible}} to tissue equivalence and exhibit a small detection volume compared to the size of the irradiation field, because of the lack of lateral electronic equilibrium in small beam. Characteristics of single crystal diamond (<b>tissue</b> <b>equivalent</b> <b>material</b> Z = 6, high density) make it an ideal candidate to fulfill most of small beam dosimetry requirements. A commercially Element Six electronic grade synthetic diamond was selected to develop a single crystal diamond dosimeter (SCDDo) with a small detection volume (0. 4 mm 3). The Monte-Carlo code PENELOPE (parallelized version) was used to optimize both geometry and packaging materials of the diamond detector in order to respect the tissue-equivalent requirement. SCDDo dose profile and output factor (OF) measurements, were performed for small photon beams with a micro multileaf collimator m 3 (BrainLab) attached to a Varian Clinac 2100 C linear accelerator. These measurements were compared to different detectors, both active and passive: silicon diode (PTW 60017), EBT 2 radiochromic films, PinPoint ionization chamber (PTW 31014). SCDDo presents an excellent spatial resolution for dose profile measurements, due its small detection volume. OFs obtained with SCDDo are very satisfactory from 0. 6 × 0. 6 cm 2 to 10 × 10 cm 2 field sizes, compared to PinPoint ionization chamber which underestimates OF values in small beam...|$|E
40|$|The {{ultrasonic}} treatment of varicose veins uses high-intensity focused ultrasound, {{in which a}} blood vessel is contracted by converting acoustic energy into thermal energy. In this study, we propose a phantom of varicose veins {{that can be applied}} for the efficient evaluation of {{ultrasonic treatment}} in varicose veins. The proposed phantom consisted of glycerol base <b>tissue</b> <b>equivalent</b> <b>material,</b> vessel mimic tube, and blood mimic substances. The vessel mimic tube was placed inner glycerol phantom and it was filled with blood mimic substances. Blood-mimicked substances are prepared by adjusting the concentration of the glycerol solution to be similar to the acoustic properties of the blood, and vessel-mimicking materials are selected by measuring acoustic properties and thermal shrinkage of various materials in a heat-shrinkable tube. The blood vessels surrounding the tissue are replaced with the phantom similar to glycerol-based organization, and venous blood flow is implemented using a DC motor. The heating characteristics according to the ultrasonic wave using the manufactured varicose veins phantom were evaluated. As the sound wave irradiation time and power increased, the contractility of the vessel mimicking materials and the temperature of the surrounding tissues were increased. When the blood-mimicking material was circulated, the highest temperature in the focused region and the contractility of vessel mimicking materials were reduced under the same conditions as used for sonication. The manufactured phantom may contribute to the treatment of varicose veins and can be used to predict the ultrasonic therapeutic efficiency of varicose veins...|$|E
40|$|Although {{wide bore}} {{computed}} tomography (CT) scanners provide increased space for patients, the scan {{field of view}} (sFOV) remains considerably smaller than the bore size. Consequently, patient anatomy which spans beyond the sFOV is truncated and the information is lost. As a solution, some manufacturers provide the capacity to reconstruct CT images from a partial dataset at an extended field of view (eFOV). To assess spatial distortion within this eFOV three phantoms were considered a 30 x 30 x 20 cm 3 slab of solid water, the Gammex electron density CT phantom and a female anthropomorphic phantom. For each phantom, scans were taken centrally within the sFOV as a reference image and with the phantom edge extended at 1 cm intervals from 0 to 5 cm beyond the sFOV into the eFOV. To assess CT number accuracy various <b>tissue</b> <b>equivalent</b> <b>materials</b> were scanned in the eFOV and resulting CT numbers were compared to inserts scanned within the sFOV. For all phantom geometries, objects within the eFOV were geometrically overestimated with elongation of phantom shapes into the eFOV. The percentage increase in size ranged from 0. 22 to 15. 94 % over all phantoms considered. The difference between eFOV and sFOV CT numbers was dependent upon insert density. The eFOV underestimated CT numbers {{in the range of}} − 127 to − 230 HU for soft tissue densities and − 278 to − 640 for bone densities. This trend reversed for low tissue densities with the CT numbers in the eFOV being overestimated by 100 - 130 HU for lung equivalent inserts. Initial correlation between eFOV and sFOV CT numbers was seen and a correction function was successfully applied to better estimate the CT number representative of that seen within the sFOV...|$|R
40|$|For {{accurate}} dose calculations, it {{is necessary}} to provide a correct relationship between the CT numbers and electron density in radiotherapy treatment planning systems (TPSs). The {{purpose of this study was}} to investigate the energy dependence of measured CT numbers on substituted materials used for CT number calibration of radiotherapy TPSs and the resulting errors in the treatment planning calculation doses. In this study, we designed a cylindrical water phantom with different <b>materials</b> used as <b>tissue</b> <b>equivalent</b> <b>materials</b> for the simulation of tissues and obtaining the related CT numbers. For evaluating the effect of CT number variations of substituted materials due to energy changing of scanner (kVp) on the dose calculation of TPS, the slices of the scanned phantom at three kVp's were imported into the desired TPSs (MIRS and CorePLAN). Dose calculations were performed on two TPSs. The mean absolute percentage differences between the CT numbers of CT scanner and two treatment planning systems for all the samples were 3. 22 %± 2. 57 % for CorePLAN and 2. 88 %± 2. 11 % for MIRS. It was also found that the maximum absolute percentage difference between all of the calculated doses from each photon beam of linac (6 and 15 MV) at three kVp's was less than 1. 2 %. The present study revealed that, for the materials with effective low atomic number, the mean CT number increased with increasing energy, which was opposite for the materials with an effective high atomic number. We concluded that the tissue substitute materials had a different behavior in the energy ranges from 80 to 130 kVp. So, {{it is necessary}} to consider the energy dependence of the substitute materials used for the measurement or calibration of CT number for radiotherapy treatment planning systems...|$|R
40|$|The {{distribution}} of 75 Se in <b>tissue</b> <b>equivalent</b> <b>materials</b> was investigated employing Gamma ray Emission Tomography with a rectilinear scanner utilizing NaI(Tl) and BGO detectors. The reconstructed images, using Filtered Back Projection and Iterative techniques {{were presented in}} 2 D colour and 3 D representations. Using a lead collimator of aperture 1. 5 x 20 mm and 70 length, the {{distribution of}} selenium with variation of volume and concentration was examined and clearly seen. Several corrections such as background, scattering, attenuation compensation and X-ray characteristic suppression, were performed {{to improve the quality}} of the images which was evaluated in terms of the fidelity factor. The possibility of quantifying an image was considered with regard to spatial resolution and least detectable concentration. The spatial resolution was measured using two small vials containing the same concentration of selenium, the value obtained was the same as the width of the collimator aperture. The value of the least detectable concentration of selenium however, was difficult to find, due to the many ambiguous factors involved. The binding site of selenium which is based on quadrupole interaction with the surrounding electric field, was investigated employing Perturbed Angular Correlation (PAC) experiments using NaI(Tl) and BaF 2 detectors. Using NaI(Tl) detectors, it was difficult to observe the perturbation, due to the poor time resolution. The BaF 2 detector according to the literatures has a shorter light emission decay time constant (0. 6 ns), suggested that a better time resolution than that found with the NaI(Tl) detectors could be obtained. A Perturbed Angular Correlation experiment employing BaF 2 detectors and a fast-slow coincidence system was set up. The time differential PAC of selenium in solution showed an unperturbed angular correlation pattern. The main problem is the very short half life of the intermediate state of 75 Se (0. 3 ns), making it difficult to observe the perturbation effect. The time resolution of the system (5. 4 ns) will need to be improved by an order of magnitude or more for the investigations to continue...|$|R
