5|$|At this juncture, the Roman empire was convulsed by {{its first}} major civil war since the Battle of Actium exactly a century earlier: the Year of the Four Emperors (69-70 AD). The {{governor}} of Germania Inferior, ordered {{to raise more}} troops, outraged the Batavi by attempting to conscript more Batavi than the maximum stipulated in their treaty. <b>The</b> <b>brutality</b> and corruption of the Roman recruiting-centurions (including incidents of sexual assault on Batavi young men) brought already deep discontent in the Batavi homeland to the boil.|$|E

5|$|Emmett Louis Till (July 25, 1941– August 28, 1955) was a 14-year-old African-American who was lynched in Mississippi in 1955, after a {{white woman}} said she was {{offended}} by him in her family's grocery store. <b>The</b> <b>brutality</b> of his murder {{and the fact that}} his killers were acquitted drew attention to the long history of violent persecution of African Americans in the United States. Till posthumously became an icon of the Civil Rights Movement.|$|E
5|$|In The Disasters of War, Goya {{does not}} excuse any purpose to the random slaughter—the plates are devoid of the {{consolation}} of divine order or the dispensation of human justice. This {{in part a}} result of the absence of melodrama or consciously artful presentation that would distance the viewer from <b>the</b> <b>brutality</b> of the subjects, as found in Baroque martyrdom. In addition, Goya refuses to offer the stability of traditional narrative. Instead, his composition tends to highlight the most disturbing aspects of each work.|$|E
5|$|Reform was {{demanded by}} such voices as U.S. President Theodore Roosevelt, who decried <b>the</b> <b>brutality</b> and foul {{play of the}} game, and called a meeting of school presidents to discuss the issue. As a result, before the next season began, new rules {{were put in place}} to {{discourage}} such play. The forward pass was also introduced to open up the game and reduce the role of dangerous mass formations. Despite the planned changes, a number of universities banned the sport for the coming year, including Columbia, NYU, and Northwestern.|$|E

5|$|After several months, Noriega was {{transferred}} to the province of Chiriquí, where Torrijos and Díaz Herrera were posted. That year's presidential election was contested by Arnulfo Arias, a native of that province. The sitting President, Rodolfo Chiari, ordered Torrijos to harass Arias's party members, to weaken his election bid. Torrijos passed this task on to Noriega, whose men arrested a number of people. Several prisoners said that they had been tortured; others stated they had been raped in prison. <b>The</b> <b>brutality</b> of Noriega's activities led to him being suspended for ten days, an item of information that was picked up by the U.S. intelligence services.|$|E
5|$|Before {{the end of}} the year, Gaveston had {{returned}} to England, and civil war appeared imminent. In May 1312, Gaveston was taken captive by the Earl of Pembroke, but Warwick and Lancaster had him abducted and executed after a mock trial. This affront to Pembroke’s honour drove him irrevocably into the camp of the king, and thereby split the opposition. <b>The</b> <b>brutality</b> of the act initially drove Lancaster and his adherents away from the centre of power, but the Battle of Bannockburn, in June 1314, returned the initiative. Edward was humiliated by his disastrous defeat, while Lancaster and Warwick had not taken part in the campaign, claiming that it was carried out without the consent of the baronage, and as such in defiance of the Ordinances.|$|E
5|$|Hunting {{dolphins}} (at {{the time}} still often incorrectly {{referred to as}} fish or porpoises), primarily using harpoons and firearms, was considered a form of recreational hunting along {{the shores of the}} Gulf of Mexico in Texas in the late 19th and early 20th century. Pleasure dolphin hunting cruises could be booked in Corpus Christi in the 1920s, with a promise to tourists that if no successful dolphin kill was made, the excursion would be free of charge. <b>The</b> <b>brutality</b> of the practice started to spark animal welfare concerns and there is no reference of this practice still occurring in Texas after the Second World War.|$|E
5000|$|Journalist Robert Fisk quoted Bernstein in the 9 July 2002 {{edition of}} The Independent of London as saying: “Any US journalist, columnist, editor, college professor, student-activist, public {{official}} or clergy member who dares to speak critically of Israel or accurately report <b>the</b> <b>brutalities</b> of its illegal occupation will be vilified as an anti-Semite." ...|$|R
25|$|The Japanese {{occupation}} in Cambodia lasted from 1941 to 1945 and, in general, the Cambodian population escaped <b>the</b> <b>brutalities</b> inflicted on civilians by the Japanese occupiers {{in other countries}} of Southeast Asia.

5|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the Jacobite defeat, on 13 February 1692, in an incident known as the Massacre of Glencoe, 38 members of the Clan MacDonald of Glencoe were killed by members of the Earl of Argyll's Regiment of Foot, who had accepted their hospitality, {{on the grounds that they}} had not been prompt in pledging allegiance to the new monarchs. Another forty women and children died of exposure after their homes were burned. <b>The</b> <b>brutality</b> of the incident was embarrassing for the new government and after a subsequent inquiry Dalrymple, who had ordered the massacre, was forced to resign. The massacre helped create greater sympathy for the Stuart cause and may have contributed to later support for Jacobite risings.|$|E
5|$|Similarly he is irreligious, {{his work}} making him {{aware of the}} {{fragility}} of life and consciousness's reliance on the functioning brain. His morality is nuanced, weighing both sides of an issue. When leaving the confrontation with Baxter, he questions his use of his medical knowledge, {{even though it was}} in self-defense, and with genuine Hippocratic feeling. While shopping for his fish supper, he cites scientific research that shows greater consciousness in fish, and wonders whether he should stop eating them. As a sign of his rationalism, he appreciates <b>the</b> <b>brutality</b> of Saddam Hussein's rule as described by the Iraqi professor whom Perowne treated, at the same time taking seriously his children's concerns about the war.|$|E
5|$|The Tennessee Coal, Iron and Railroad Company {{was one of}} {{the largest}} users of prison laborers, mostly Blacks convicted of petty crimes, as a method for paying fines. This {{practice}} was common for obtaining coal mining labor in Alabama {{at the close of the}} Reconstruction era. The number of convicts employed increased after U.S. Steel acquired TCI in 1907, as did <b>the</b> <b>brutality</b> of the conditions in which they labored. In 1908, the first full year of U. S. Steel's ownership of TCI, almost 60 prison workers died from workplace-related accidents. That same year, the new owners of the company discovered a 400% annual turnover in the workforce.|$|E

Frustrated by his lack of progress and <b>the</b> <b>brutality</b> of the training, Wesley insists he is ready, but Sloan disagrees. Wesley refocuses on his training and starts to excel. Sloan then shows him the Loom of Fate, which has served for 1,000 years in giving coded names of Fraternity targets through errors in the fabric. The Loom identifies those who will create evil and chaos in the future, with Sloan responsible for interpreting the code.|$|E
5|$|Anderson {{arrived at}} the guerrilla camp and {{described}} the day's events, <b>the</b> <b>brutality</b> of which unsettled Todd. By mid-afternoon, the 39th Missouri Volunteer Infantry had arrived in Centralia. From the town, they saw {{a group of about}} 120 guerrillas and pursued them. The guerrillas heard that the cavalry was approaching, and Anderson sent a party to set an ambush. They drew the Union troops {{to the top of a}} hill; a group of guerrillas led by Anderson had been stationed at the bottom and other guerrillas hid nearby. Anderson then led a charge up the hill. Although five guerrillas were killed by the first volley of Union fire, the Union soldiers were quickly overwhelmed by the well-armed guerrillas, and those who fled were pursued. One Union officer reached Centralia and gave word of the ambush, allowing a few Union soldiers who had remained there to escape. However, most were hunted down and killed; Anderson's men mutilated the bodies of the dead soldiers and tortured some survivors.|$|E
5|$|Raden Trunajaya (also spelled Trunojoyo) was a {{descendant}} of the rulers of Madura, who was forced {{to live in the}} Mataram court after Madura's defeat and annexation by Mataram in 1624. After his father was executed by AmangkuratI in 1656, he left the court, moved to Kajoran, and married the daughter of Raden Kajoran, the head of the ruling family there. The Kajoran family was an ancient family of clerics and was related by marriage to the royal family. Raden Kajoran was alarmed at <b>the</b> <b>brutality</b> of AmangkuratI's rule, including executions of noblemen at court. In 1670 Kajoran introduced his son-in-law Trunajaya to the crown prince, who had recently been banished by the king due to a scandal, and the two forged a friendship that included a mutual dislike of Amangkurat. In 1671 Trunajaya returned to Madura, where he used the crown prince's support to defeat the local governor and become the master of Madura.|$|E
