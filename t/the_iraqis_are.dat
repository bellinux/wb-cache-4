The vast majority will go to Baghdad, where they will help Iraqi forces to clear and secure neighborhoods, and serve as advisers embedded in Iraqi Army units. With Iraqis in the lead, our forces will help secure the city by chasing down the terrorists, insurgents, and the roaming death squads. And in Anbar Province, where al Qaeda terrorists have gathered and local forces have begun showing a willingness to fight them, we're sending an additional 4,000 United States Marines, with orders to find the terrorists and clear them out.

30|$|The {{needs of}} non-Muslim and/or non-Syrian {{refugees}} from Iraq {{are comparable to}} those of Syrian refugees. While they may not be running to escape from the ‛despotism of the Assad regime’, the narrative with which Erdoğan has been very keen to qualify the Syrian refugees, they are seeking refuge in Turkey due to the extensive repercussions of civil war in Syria. As they do not come from Syria, however, Turkish authorities do not extend temporary protection to them. Hence, the geographical limitation clause applies to their cases, making them face even more perilous circumstances than the Syrians. Devoid of refugee protection, similar to other asylum seekers in Turkey, such as Iranians and Afghans, <b>the</b> <b>Iraqis</b> <b>are</b> also forced to use Turkey for transit.

40|$|Organisé par l'Université de LundInternational audienceBlocks of flats under construction, {{pressure}} on the infrastructure and crowded public spaces is today to be found all over Damascus. However, specific areas have undergone more intense developments during the last years, mainly linked to internal and international migration movements. Since the fall of Saddam Hussein regime, the conflict in Iraq is still ongoing {{and hundreds of thousands}} of Iraqis have been constrained to leave their country to move in great number towards Syria. The vast majority comes from the main cities in Iraq, and especially from Baghdad, and they settled in the suburbs of the Syrian capital. Neither Syria, nor the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees have opened camps to accommodate the refugees, who are today one of the most important group of urban refugees throughout the world. This presentation strives to analyse the role of migrants in the recent urban development of Damascus underprivileged suburbs, with a focus on the modes of settlement of Iraqi refugees who massively fled their country following the fall of Saddam Hussein regime in 2003. This study is based on two fieldwork experiences (2006 - 2009) in Damascus. With an in-depth look into the changes of areas of high concentration of Iraqi refugees, this presentation sets out to explore how the everyday life is changing. By looking into the public spaces and how areas previously seen as little villages are now expanding and have become an integrated part of the city the article points to the important linkages between migration and urban development in contemporary Damascus. Iraqis are having a more permanent effect on the Syrian society and the situation is not likely to change in the near future while <b>the</b> <b>Iraqis</b> <b>are</b> being more and more established in the city...|$|E
