5|$|The Sasanians {{would not}} only assume Parthia's legacy as Rome's Persian nemesis, but <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>also</b> attempt to restore the {{boundaries}} of the Achaemenid Empire by briefly conquering the Levant, Anatolia, and Egypt from the Eastern Roman Empire during the reign of Khosrau II (r.590–628AD). However, they would lose these territories to Heraclius—the last Roman emperor before the Arab conquests.

5|$|A {{number of}} factors made escape {{attempts}} daunting for the internees. They would have to navigate through Japanese-occupied territory, find food, and as few internees spoke Cantonese, <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>also</b> {{have to deal with}} the language barrier if they succeeded in escaping. Despite these difficulties, there were three major escape attempts, of which two in March 1942 were successful. One group of eight internees escaped on a small boat to neighbouring Macau. Another group, consisting of two internees, escaped through the New Territories and into mainland China. The third group, four policemen, in April 1942 managed to escape the camp grounds but were caught within a few miles of camp. They were subsequently imprisoned and released back to camp after a few weeks.|$|E

Wes Brown, Scholes and Ryan Giggs were all doubts for the final, after they had picked up knocks in the week before the final. <b>They</b> <b>would</b> <b>also</b> be without striker Diego Forlán, who had injured his ankle against Juventus, however, defender Mikaël Silvestre was declared fit to start.|$|E

5|$|From its inception, users {{would use}} the {{newsgroup}} to discuss {{the quality of the}} episode, as well as to talk about continuity errors and trivia. <b>They</b> <b>would</b> <b>also</b> discuss cultural references, usually related to pop culture. Another common topic is freeze frame gags, which are jokes that can only be seen when the viewer tapes the episode and freezes the image. All of these many discussions were compiled and submitted to The Simpsons Archive, which contains at least 330 episode guides as well as other guides. The newsgroup also provides The Simpsons Archive with information on the characters and the setting, as well as a compilation of articles about the show and interview with its cast and crew.|$|E
5|$|Hoping {{to attract}} a {{proposed}} ZAP electric vehicle manufacturing plant {{to the city of}} Franklin, Kentucky, Beshear issued an executive order permitting low-speed vehicles on many Kentucky roads in August 2008. The state also offered the company $48 million in tax incentives, contingent upon its delivering a promised 4,000 jobs. Construction of the proposed plant stalled, however, when GE Capital, a primary investor, pulled out of the project. ZAP officials maintained their intention to build the plant, but said <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>also</b> consider other states' proposals if they could not replace the $125 million commitment from GE.|$|E

Stuart scored seven goals and had eight assists and was named the best cover-point {{in the league in}} 1903.|$|E

5|$|In {{her next}} letter Hańska made {{arrangements}} for a trusted courier to collect letters from Balzac, and thereby {{allow for a}} direct correspondence.

Contradicting her vow of eternal anonymity, she suggested a meeting. Balzac agreed immediately, and began to make preparations for the journey.

50|$|Logic {{dictates}} that these native soldiers and mercenaries would have {{passed on to}} very close {{friends and family members}} these newly learned skills to augment already existing and effective native ones. <b>They</b> <b>would</b> have <b>also</b> shared tactics and techniques with each other when placed in the same military group and fighting on the same side in foreign regions such as Formosa, Mindanao, the Moluccas and the Marianas.|$|R
50|$|The species would dig for its food, {{and would}} have accidentally {{ingested}} {{a large amount of}} gritty dirt and soil particulate.

Eventually <b>they</b> <b>would</b> <b>also</b> be supported by elements of the North Korean 105th Armored Division.

50|$|Auroras {{occur on}} Mars, {{but they do}} not occur at the poles as on Earth, because Mars has no planetwide {{magnetic}} field.
