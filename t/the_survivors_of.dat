40|$|In {{this article}} {{the results of}} {{research}} undertaken to explore the experience of therapy by respectively <b>the</b> <b>survivor</b> <b>of</b> armed robbery and <b>the</b> therapist <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>survivor</b> <b>of</b> armed robbery in the case where therapy is prematurely terminated by <b>the</b> <b>survivor</b> <b>of</b> armed robbery are discussed. A high percentage <b>of</b> therapy for <b>the</b> <b>survivor</b> <b>of</b> armed robbery is being terminated prematurely by <b>the</b> <b>survivor.</b> This might be the reason for failing to use all possible opportunities to recover within reasonable time. The research questions that arouse are: “How do <b>survivors</b> <b>of</b> armed robbery experience therapy after being exposed to armed robbery?” and “How do therapists experience therapy for <b>the</b> <b>survivor</b> <b>of</b> armed robbery?” A qualitative, exploratory, descriptive and contextual research design was utilised. Phenomenological, semi-structured {{interviews were conducted with}} <b>survivors</b> <b>of</b> armed robbery and therapists <b>of</b> <b>survivors</b> <b>of</b> armed robbery to explore and describe their experiences...|$|R

5|$|As White had {{expected}} the survivors to {{fight their way}} out of Ngok Tavak, he made the decision to leave the dead allied soldiers behind; the decision caused distress amongst <b>the</b> <b>survivors</b> <b>of</b> the battle, but White believed evacuating the deceased soldiers through enemy lines would have been suicidal. After the Marines and Mobile Strike Force personnel had destroyed their unneeded equipment, they were directed to form an order-of-march out of Ngok Tavak, {{in order to protect the}} wounded and those with little infantry experience. Just before they left the garrison, Cameron blew up the first CH-46 helicopter that was still intact on the landing zone, using the M-72 anti-tank weapon. The order-of-march was led by a group of Nung soldiers, who were followed by White and <b>the</b> <b>survivors</b> <b>of</b> the Marine artillery detachment, and behind them was another group of Nung soldiers covering the tail of the column. Together they evaded VC formations surrounding the hill feature of Ngok Tavak and marched eastward towards Khâm Đức.|$|E

5|$|The {{demographic}} decline due to {{the plague}} had economic consequences: the prices of food dropped and land values declined by 30 to 40% {{in most parts of}} Europe between 1350 and 1400. Landholders faced a great loss, but for ordinary men and women it was a windfall. <b>The</b> <b>survivors</b> <b>of</b> the plague found not only that the prices of food were cheaper but also that lands were more abundant, and many of them inherited property from their dead relatives.|$|E

Bréville was now in British control again {{for the third time}} since the landings on 6 June.

5|$|By 13 January most of <b>the</b> <b>survivors</b> <b>of</b> {{the fleet}} had limped back to France {{in a state}} of disrepair. One ship of the line that {{remained}} at sea, the 74-gun Droits de l'Homme, was commanded by Commodore Jean-Baptiste Raymond de Lacrosse and carried over 1,300men, 700–800 of them soldiers, including General Jean Humbert. Detached from {{the main body of the}} fleet during the retreat from Bantry Bay, Lacrosse made his way to the mouth of the Shannon alone. Recognising that the weather was still too violent for a landing to be made, Lacrosse acknowledged the failure of the operation and ordered the ship to return to France, capturing the British privateer Cumberland en route.|$|E
5|$|By 30 November, the 6th Brigade was {{surrounded}} and the Afrika Korps, including the Italian Ariete Division, began attacking after midday with tanks and infantry.

5|$|In {{isolated}} {{areas with}} small populations, tropical cyclones may cause enough casualties {{to contribute to}} the founder's effect as survivors repopulate their place. For example, around 1775, a typhoon hit Pingelap Atoll, and in combination with a subsequent famine, reduced the island's population to a low level. Several generations after the disaster, as many as 10% of Pingelapese have a genetic form of color-blindness called achromatopsia. This is due to one of <b>the</b> <b>survivors</b> <b>of</b> the depopulation brought on by the typhoon having a mutated gene, which the population bottleneck caused to be at a higher-than-usual level in succeeding generations.|$|E

After Nora is decapitated by malfunctioning elevator doors, the group leaves to track down Isabella, who has gone into labor at the police station, while the policeman on duty rushes Isabella {{to the hospital in}} her van. Along the way they discover they have all cheated death twice; {{had it not been for}} <b>the</b> <b>survivors</b> <b>of</b> Flight 180 they would all be dead, which explains why the survivors are dying in reverse. Since Thomas saved Kimberly from being hit by the truck, she is last on Death's list.|$|E

This discussion highlights the value of restorative justice in this regard as well as the way to apply it to respect the specific needs <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>survivor</b> <b>of</b> sexual abuse.
