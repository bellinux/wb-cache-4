40|$|In Drosophila melanogaster, Slit {{acts as a}} repulsive cue for {{the growth}} cones of the commissural axons which express a {{receptor}} for Slit, Roundabout (Robo), thus preventing the commissural axons from crossing the midline multiple times. Experiments using explant culture have shown that vertebrate Slit homologues also act repulsively for growth cone navigation and neural migration, and promote branching and elongation of sensory axons. Here, we demonstrate that overexpression of Slit 2 in vivo in transgenic zebrafish embryos severely affected {{the behavior of the}} commissural reticulospinal neurons (Mauthner neurons), promoted branching of the peripheral axons of the <b>trigeminal</b> sensory <b>ganglion</b> neurons, and induced defasciculation of the medial longitudinal fascicles. In addition, Slit 2 overexpression caused defasciculation and deflection of the central axons of the <b>trigeminal</b> sensory <b>ganglion</b> neurons from the hindbrain entry point. The central projection was restored by either functional repression or mutation of Robo 2, supporting its role as a receptor mediating the Slit signaling in vertebrate neurons. Furthermore, we demonstrated that Islet- 2, a LIM/homeodomain-type transcription factor, is essential for Slit 2 to induce axonal branching of the <b>trigeminal</b> sensory <b>ganglion</b> neurons, suggesting that factors functioning downstream of Islet- 2 are essential for mediating the Slit signaling for promotion of axonal branching.

25|$|When the {{internal}} carotid artery enters the canal in the petrous portion of the temporal bone, it first ascends a short distance, then curves anteriorly and medially.

Frequently this bony plate is more or less deficient, and then the ganglion is separated from the artery by fibrous membrane. The artery is separated from the bony wall of the carotid canal by a prolongation of dura mater, and is surrounded by a number of small veins and by filaments of the carotid plexus, derived from the ascending branch of the superior cervical ganglion of the sympathetic trunk.|$|E

Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) have been reported to suppress reactivation of HSV- 1 in <b>trigeminal</b> <b>ganglions.</b> However, whether this drug can affect reactivation of HSV- 1 in vestibular ganglions is unclear. Due to the difficulties of constructing in vivo animal models, in this study, we developed a vestibular ganglion culture system, in which vestibular neurons were latently or lytically infected with HSV- 1. Indomethacin and celecoxib were selected to measure their effects on HSV- 1. Trichostatin A was used to reactivate HSV- 1 in latently infected neurons.

Although it appeared that indomethacin and celecoxib showed limited but concentration-dependent inhibition effects on viral production under our condition, indomethacin decreased reactivation rate of HSV- 1 by about 20 %.

The present study aimed to determine the differential expression of microRNAs (miRNAs) and disclose the underlying role of miR- 125 a- 3 p in orofacial inflammatory pain induced by complete Freund’s adjuvant (CFA). Thirty-two differentially expressed miRNAs were first screened using a microarray chip in ipsilateral <b>trigeminal</b> <b>ganglions</b> (TGs) following CFA injection into the orofacial skin innervated by trigeminal nerve, and a portion of them, including miR- 23 a*,- 24 - 2 *,- 26 a,- 92 a,- 125 a- 3 p,- 183 and- 299 were subsequently selected and validated by qPCR. The target genes were predicted based on the miRWalk website and were further analyzed by gene ontology (GO). Further studies revealed miR- 125 a- 3 p expression was down-regulated, whereas both the expression of p 38 MAPK (mitogen-activated protein kinase) alpha and CGRP (calcitonin gene-related peptide) were up-regulated in ipsilateral TGs at different time points after CFA injection compared with control. Furthermore, mechanistic study revealed that miR- 125 a- 3 p negatively regulates p 38 alpha gene expression and is positively correlated with the head withdrawal threshold reflecting pain.

Bicyclic terpenoids like camphor and 1, 8 -cineol produce robust acute desensitization of TRPV 3. Menthol and dihydrocarveol induced tachyphylaxis of TRPV 3 responses. Pore-loop mutations resulted in the loss of camphor sensitivity of TRPV 3. Menthol was found to activate TRPV 3 and TRPA 1.
