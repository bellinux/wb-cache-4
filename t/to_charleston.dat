5|$|After the battle, Steuart {{was sent}} as a {{prisoner}} of war <b>to</b> <b>Charleston,</b> South Carolina, and was later imprisoned at Hilton Head, where he and other officers were placed under the fire of Confederate artillery. The fighting at Spotsylvania was to prove the end of his brigade. Johnson's division, 6,800 strong {{at the start of the}} battle, was now so severely reduced in size that barely one brigade could be formed. On May 14 the brigades of Walker, Jones, and Steuart were consolidated into one small brigade under the command of Colonel Terry of the 4th Virginia Infantry.|$|E

Due to inclement weather conditions in West Palm Beach, which had been newly incorporated as a town just days earlier, businesses suspended their normal operations and people boarded up buildings, even as the strongest winds arrived.

In Charleston, his father was among the founders of the first Reform congregation in the United States, with shorter services conducted in English rather than Hebrew. Philip was ultimately expelled from that community, as he did not keep the Sabbath, and the extent of Judah's religious education is uncertain. The boy's intelligence was noted by others in Charleston, one of whom offered to finance his education.|$|E

5|$|The Bahamas did {{not come}} under {{external}} threat during Rogers' second term, but the reappointed governor had difficulties. Still seeking to bolster the island's defences, Rogers sought imposition of a local tax. The assembly, which had been instituted in Rogers' absence, objected, and Rogers responded by dissolving it. The governmental battle exhausted Rogers, who again went <b>to</b> <b>Charleston</b> in early 1731 {{in an attempt to}} recover his health.
