5000|$|Within {{the last}} decades our time scale has {{expanded}} from unimaginably small (nanoseconds) to unimaginably large (deep time). In comparison, our working concept of time as {past : present : future} looks almost quaint. How do we map [...] "tradition" [...] into this multiplicity of time scales? Folkloristics has already acknowledged this {{in the study of}} traditions which are either done in an annual cycle of circular time (ex. Christmas, May Day), or in a life cycle of linear time (ex. baptisms, weddings, funerals). This needs to be expanded to other traditions of oral lore. For folk narrative is NOT a linear chain of isolated tellings, going from one single performance on our <b>time-space</b> <b>grid</b> to the next single performance. Instead it fits better into a non-linear system, where one performer varies the story from one telling to the next, and his understudy starts to tell the story, also varying each performance in response to multiple factors. As we explore different concepts of time, we must also explore different ways of mapping tradition into the human experience.|$|E
40|$|An elastic ideal 2 D {{propagation}} medium, i. e., a membrane, can be simulated by models discretizing {{the wave}} equation on the <b>time-space</b> <b>grid</b> (finite difference methods), or locally discretizing {{the solution of}} the wave equation (waveguide meshes). The two approaches provide equivalent computational structures, and introduce numerical dispersion that induces a misalignment of the modes from their theoretical positions. Prior literature shows that dispersion can be arbitrarily reduced by oversizing and oversampling the mesh, or by adpting offline warping techniques. In this paper we propose to reduce numerical dispersion by embedding warping elements, i. e., properly tuned allpass filters, in the structure. The resulting model exhibits a significant reduction in dispersion, and requires less computational resources than a regular mesh structure having comparable accuracy.

40|$|This article {{proposes a}} {{numerical}} scheme for computing {{the evolution of}} vehicular traffic on a road network over a finite time horizon. The traffic dynamics on each link is modeled by the Hamilton-Jacobi (HJ) partial differential equation (PDE), which is an equivalent form of the Lighthill-Whitham-Richards PDE. The main contribution {{of this article is}} the construction of a single convex optimization program which computes the traffic flow at a junction over a finite time horizon and decouples the PDEs on connecting links. Compared to discretization schemes which require the computation of all traffic states on a <b>time-space</b> <b>grid,</b> the proposed convex optimization approach computes the boundary flows at the junction using only the initial condition on links and the boundary conditions of the network. The computed boundary flows at the junction specify the boundary condition for the HJ PDE on connecting links, which then can be separately solved using an existing semi-explicit scheme for single link HJ PDE. As demonstrated in a numerical example of ramp metering control, the proposed convex optimization approach also provides a natural framework for optimal traffic control applications...|$|E
40|$|A stable multistep {{scheme for}} solving {{backward}} stochastic differential equations. (English summary) SIAM J. Numer. Anal. 48 (2010), no. 4, 1369 – 1394. 1095 - 7170 In this paper a stable multistep scheme on <b>time-space</b> <b>grids</b> for backward stochastic differential equations {{of the type}} { −dyt = f(t, yt, zt) dt − ztdWt, t ∈ [0, T), yT = ξ is suggested. Here W is a standard Brownian motion and f(t, y, z) is an adapted stochastic process {{with respect to the}} filtration. In the scheme the integrands, which are conditional expectations, are approximated using Lagrange interpolating polynomials in time and Gauss-Hermite quadrature rules in space. Polynomial interpolations approximate the function values at nongrid space points. The data used in the scheme at each time-space point can be local. If f = f(t, yt), convergence of high order is proved and the exact order depends on the number of the used time levels. Extensive numerical tests and comparisons are shown to be consistent with the theoretical ones. In one of the examples, option pricing for the Black-Scholes model with dividends is investigated and compared with a numerical method suggested in [W. D. Zhao, L. Chen and S. G. Peng, SIAM J. Sci. Comput. 28 (2006), no. 4, 1563 – 1581; MR 2255470]. The paper extends previous results for numerical solution of backward SDEs for which one-step schemes in time direction were used...|$|R
40|$|The {{operation}} of the transmission line models requires an input signal in the frequency domain describing {{the nature of the}} transient disturbance (for example, a valve closure) and an exact solution of the linearized mass and momentum equations for unsteady pipe flow. The use of the transmission line models does not require a strict adherence to a <b>time–space</b> discretization <b>grid</b> governed by the Courant condition, but it does require that the input signal be discretized in the frequency domain. This paper investigates the errors induced by the discretization of the input signal and provides guidelines for the appropriate selection of discretization size for the linear transmission line models. The accuracy of the model is quantified through comparison with a finely discretisated method of characteristics (MOC) model. The results show that the transmission line models are sensitive to the time–frequency discretization size and unlike the MOC, the appropriate size of the discretization changes depending on the transient event being modelled as well as the energy losses in the system.

40|$|In {{this paper}} I will apply bergsonian model of pure {{perception}} modified as transitional step of immersion in some projects of virtual art (Dervish by Markos Novak and Placeholder by Brenda Laurel and Rachel Strickland), extrapolated from an analogy {{observed in the}} processes of exclusion in bergsonian theory of perception and lacanian theory of subjectivation. For Bergson, my body as an image/screen is carved out, and, in turn, is carving from, the aggregate of other images. Object appears to my body {{in the process of}} conversion from present to represented object by exclusion of its greater part, as perception. For Lacan, process of subjectivation includes a phase of aphanisis, „the division of the subject – when the subject appears somewhere as meaning, he is manifested elsewhere as ‘fading’, as disappearance“. Subject appears as a kind of agency capable of isolating and playing with the function of the image/screen as a form of his or her represenation. When entering the VR, our body, delimited as a screen, as a centre of indetermination capable of eventual actions, will be delimited again in another aggregate of images, specified by what I shall call different discursive density: new discursive-specific <b>time-space</b> <b>grid,</b> after which our screen will form gradually. At first, access of perception (of the user) to the memory (of the VR system) and consequent forming of affection which distinguishes between virtual and real actions establishing boundaries of the body, seems to be absent. This generates transitory disorientation for the user descended to defective position of the cyber-produced borderline state, until another screen with adequate discursive density is delimited, allowing for its visibility in the VR system – reflecting the actions of that system with increasing ability to delay its own...|$|E
