5|$|A tidal {{disruption}} {{event of}} this sort is when a star interacts with a supermassive black hole shredding the star, {{and in some cases}} creating a relativistic jet which produces bright emission of gamma ray radiation. The event GRB 110328A (also denoted Swift J1644+57) was initially argued to be produced by <b>the</b> <b>disruption</b> <b>of</b> a main sequence star by a black hole of several million times the mass of the Sun, although it has subsequently been argued that <b>the</b> <b>disruption</b> <b>of</b> a white dwarf by a black hole of mass about 10 thousand times the Sun may be more likely.|$|E

However, it may have formed more recently, perhaps as ejecta from a large impact on Ida. It is extremely unlikely that it was captured by Ida. Dactyl may have suffered a major impact around 100 million years ago, which reduced its size.|$|E

5|$|Because of {{the remote}} {{location}} of the Itcha Range, future eruptions are not a major hazard. Future volcanism is most likely {{in the form of}} basaltic cinder cones, but eruptions of felsic magma can not be ruled out. The most immediate hazard relating to future eruptions is of local concern only and includes the possibility of forest fires by lava flows and <b>the</b> <b>disruption</b> <b>of</b> local air traffic if an eruption column is produced. Volcanic ash reduces visibility and can cause jet engine failure, as well as damage to other aircraft systems.|$|E
5|$|Bypassing Vigo on {{his flight}} southwards, Villeneuve {{put into the}} Southern Spanish fleet base of Cadiz on 20 August. By abandoning his efforts to reach the English Channel, Villeneuve was in effect abandoning the entire {{invasion}} strategy and, when news of Villeneuve's retreat reached him, Napoleon decided to formally abandon the campaign, marching the army at Boulogne south to the Austrian border. Without instructions from his superior, and with no idea where the main French fleet was, Allemand spent much of August off the Spanish coast before deciding {{to turn to the}} third aspect of his orders, <b>the</b> <b>disruption</b> <b>of</b> British trade.|$|E
5|$|Industrialisation, {{urbanisation}} and <b>the</b> <b>Disruption</b> <b>of</b> 1843 all {{undermined the}} tradition of parish schools. From 1830 the state began to fund buildings with grants; then from 1846 it was funding schools by direct sponsorship; and in 1872 Scotland moved to a system like that in England of state-sponsored largely free schools, run by local school boards. The historic University of Glasgow became a leader in British higher education by providing {{the educational needs of}} youth from the urban and commercial classes, as opposed to the upper class. The University of St Andrews pioneered the admission of women to Scottish universities. From 1892 Scottish universities could admit and graduate women and the numbers of women at Scottish universities steadily increased until the early 20th century.|$|E

5|$|The Fourth Crusade {{resulted}} in <b>the</b> <b>disruption</b> <b>of</b> Byzantine manufacturing and the commercial {{dominance of the}} Western Europeans in the eastern Mediterranean, events that amounted to an economic catastrophe for the Empire. The Palaiologoi tried to revive the economy, but the late Byzantine state would not gain full control of either the foreign or domestic economic forces. Gradually, it also lost its influence on the modalities of trade and the price mechanisms, and its control over the outflow of precious metals and, according to some scholars, even over the minting of coins.|$|E
5|$|The Sun's {{magnetic}} field leads to many effects that are collectively called solar activity. Solar flares and coronal-mass ejections tend to occur at sunspot groups. Slowly changing high-speed streams of solar wind are emitted from coronal holes at the photospheric surface. Both coronal-mass ejections and high-speed streams of solar wind carry plasma and interplanetary {{magnetic field}} outward into the Solar System. The effects of solar activity on Earth include auroras at moderate to high latitudes and <b>the</b> <b>disruption</b> <b>of</b> radio communications and electric power. Solar activity {{is thought to}} have played a large role in the formation and evolution of the Solar System.|$|E
5|$|The {{campaign}} in the Adriatic has been credited with having {{a significant effect on}} the wider war through <b>the</b> <b>disruption</b> <b>of</b> French forces in the Balkans. It has been suggested that Napoleon intended to invade the Ottoman Empire following the War of the Fifth Coalition, but was dissuaded in part due to the difficulty of supplying a force in the region without control of the Adriatic, his attention eventually turning to Russia. The campaign also had effects on the morale and effectiveness of the French fleet, which lost some of its best commanders and frigates in the campaign, and on the Austrian advance on Italy in 1813, when French defence lines were repeatedly out-flanked by British attacks from the sea.|$|E

40|$|We {{present a}} {{qualitative}} picture of prompt emission from tidal <b>disruptions</b> <b>of</b> white dwarfs (WD) by intermediate mass black holes (IMBH). The smaller {{size of an}} IMBH compared to a supermassive black hole and a smaller tidal radius <b>of</b> a WD <b>disruption</b> lead to a very fast event with high peak luminosity. Magnetic field is generated in situ following <b>the</b> tidal <b>disruption,</b> which leads to effective accretion. Since large-scale magnetic field is also produced, geometrically thick super-Eddington inflow leads to a relativistic jet. The dense jet possesses a photosphere, which emits quasi-thermal radiation in soft X-rays. The source can be classified as a long low-luminosity gamma-ray burst (ll-GRB). Tidal compression of a WD causes nuclear ignition, which is observable as an accompanying supernova. We suggest that GRB 060218 and SN 2006 aj is such a pair of ll-GRB and supernova. We argue that in a flux-limited sample <b>the</b> <b>disruptions</b> <b>of</b> WDs by IMBHs are more frequent then <b>the</b> <b>disruptions</b> <b>of</b> other stars by IMBHs. ...|$|R

5|$|The {{expansion}} of the aviation industry was accompanied by <b>the</b> <b>disruption</b> <b>of</b> road transport; many roads are frequently blocked by militia checkpoints which demand payment (between $3 and $300, depending on goods carried) {{in order to allow}} the cars to continue their journey. A BBC report claimed there were seven such checkpoints in the 50km between an airstrip and the capital, Mogadishu. Most of the money is used to buy khat, a drug used by the militiamen.|$|E
