5000|$|Numerous {{plans have}} been {{advanced}} {{over the years to}} reorganize downtown Chicago rapid transit service, originally with the intention of replacing the elevated Loop lines with subways. That idea has been largely abandoned as the city seems keen on keeping an elevated/subway mix. But there have been continued calls to improve transit within the city's greatly enlarged central core. At present the [...] "L" [...] does not provide direct service between the Metra commuter rail terminals in the West Loop and Michigan Avenue, the principal shopping district, nor does it offer convenient access to popular downtown destinations such as Navy Pier, Soldier Field, and McCormick Place. Plans for the Central Area Circulator, a $700 million downtown light rail system meant to remedy this, were shelved in 1995 for lack of funding. An underground line running along the lakeshore would connect some of the city's major tourist destinations, but this plan has not been widely discussed. Recognizing the cost and difficulty of implementing an all-rail solution, the Chicago Central Area Plan advocated a mix of rail and bus improvements, the centerpiece of which was the West Loop Transportation Center, a multi-level subway to be constructed under Clinton Street from Congress Parkway to Lake Street. The top level would be a pedestrian mezzanine, buses would operate in the second level, rapid transit trains in the third level, and commuter/high-speed intercity trains in the bottom level. The rapid <b>transit</b> <b>level</b> would connect to the existing Blue Line subway at its north and south ends, making possible the [...] "Blue Line loop", envisioned as an underground counterpart to the Loop elevated. Alternatively, this level might be occupied by the Clinton Street Subway. Among other advantages, the West Loop Transportation Center would provide a direct link between the [...] "L" [...] and the city's two busiest commuter rail terminals, Ogilvie Transportation Center and Union Station. The plan also proposed transitways along Carroll Avenue (a former rail right-of-way north of the main branch of the Chicago River) and under Monroe Street in the Loop, which earlier transit schemes had proposed as rail routes. The Carroll Avenue route would provide faster bus service between the commuter stations and the rapidly redeveloping Near North Side, with possible rail service later. These new busways would tie into the bus level of the West Loop Transportation Center.|$|E

40|$|Observations of {{the various}} {{limitations}} of freeway capacity expansion {{have led to a}} provocative planning and policy question: What if we completely stop building additional freeway capacity? From a theoretical perspective, as a freeway transportation network matures there exists a saturation point beyond which any additional freeway capacity would only be counterproductive and would worsen existing urban transportation problems. Traditional benefit/cost analysis of individual capacity-expansion projects often ignores long-term induced demand and land use changes and does not represent a systems approach to this important theoretical issue. From a practical perspective, a “No-More-Freeway ” policy can relieve transportation funds for other potentially more effective uses, such as improving urban arterial street systems, improving <b>transit</b> <b>level</b> of service and coverage, implementing demand management and pricing strategies, and facilitating more efficient land use patterns (e. g., highdensity infill and transit-oriented developments).

40|$|We present new {{observations}} of four closely spaced near-ultraviolet (NUV) transits {{of the hot}} Jupiter-like exoplanet WASP- 12 b using Hubble Space Telescope (HST) /Cosmic Origins Spectrograph (COS), significantly increasing the phase resolution of the observed NUV light curve relative to previous observations, while minimizing the temporal variation of the system. We observe significant excess NUV absorption during the transit, with mean normalized in-transit fluxes of F[subscript: norm] ≃ 0. 97, i. e., ≃ 2 – 5 σ deeper than the optical <b>transit</b> <b>level</b> of ≃ 0. 986 for a uniform stellar disk (the exact confidence level depending on the normalization method used). We further observe an asymmetric transit shape, such that the post-conjunction fluxes are overall ≃ 2 – 3 σ higher than pre-conjunction values, and characterized by rapid variations in count rate between the pre-conjunction and out-of-transit levels. We do not find evidence for an early ingress to the NUV transit as suggested by earlier HST observations. However, we show that the NUV count rate observed prior to the optical transit is highly variable, but overall ≃ 2. 2 – 3. 0 σ below the post-transit values and comparable in depth to the optical transit, possibly forming a variable region of NUV absorption from at least phase ϕ ≃ 0. 83, limited by the data coverage.

40|$|This Master?s thesis {{presents}} an empirical {{analysis for the}} accessibility characteristics of the transit transfer based on the geospatial and topological features of the transit system. Transit transfer activities have been widely investigated {{around the world in}} recent decades. Considering transfers actually duplicate the number of passengers within the complete travelling pattern, we are interested in finding what kind of characteristics will {{have a significant impact on}} the accessibility of transit transfers over variously located bus stops. In this way, based on the transit faring records and the layout of transit networking infrastructures, an empirical study has been implemented in a macroscopic scope. The findings reveal the inner relationship between the distributions of transit transfer and the geospatial and topological features of the transit system, which indicates some potential improvements of the <b>transit</b> <b>level</b> of service in terms of the transfer activities. The major contributions of this empirical study are 1) proposed and defined a list of influencing accessibility characteristics towards the transit transfer in both geospatial and topological measures; 2) summarized and described how the proposed characteristics will influence the actual transit transfer accessibility; 3) implemented a linear regression based analysis framework towards the proposed characteristics while using a stepwise AIC to eliminate the irrelevant ones; 4) proposed an approximation algorithm for the detection of transfer activities while no swiping card record is available when the passengers alight the buses...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{considers}} various policy {{measures to}} reduce traffic externalities in cities, including externality-reducing investments, tolls, emission standards, low emission zones, and bypass capacity to guide traffic {{around the city}} center. Using a simple model that distinguishes local and through traffic, we study the optimal use of these instruments by an urban government that cares {{for the welfare of}} its inhabitants, and we compare the results with those preferred by a federal authority that takes into account the welfare of all road users. Our results include the following. First, compared to the federal social optimum, we show that the city government will over-invest in externality-reducing infrastructure whenever this infrastructure increases the generalized cost of transit traffic. Second, comparing emission standards and road tolls, we find that cities with a lot of commuters will favor tolls, even though from the federal perspective standards are better. Third, when implementing low emission zones, the urban government will set both the fee for non-compliance and the standard at a higher level than the federal government. Moreover, at sufficiently high <b>transit</b> <b>levels</b> the urban government will prefer imposing a toll instead of implementing a low emission zone. Fourth, if the city can toll the urban infrastructure, it will only invest in bypass capacity when it is allowed to earn extra toll revenues on the bypass that exceed investment costs. Although the paper focuses on non-congestion externalities, most insights also hold in the presence of congestion. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|The New Urbanism {{movement}} {{calls for}} redesigning American neighborhoods {{so that they}} are less oriented toward automobile travel and more conducive to walking, bicycling and transit riding, especially for non-work trips. New Urbanism calls for a return to compact neighborhoods with grid-like street patterns, mixed land uses and pedestrian amenities. This paper investigates the effects of New Urbanism design principles on both non-work and commuting travel by comparing modal splits between two distinctly different neighborhoods in the San Francisco Bay Area. The neo-traditional neighborhood, Rockridge, and the nearby conventional suburban community, Lafayette, were chosen as case sites because they have similar income profiles, freeway and <b>transit</b> service <b>levels,</b> and geographical locations. Rockridge residents averaged around a 10 percentage point higher share of non-work trips by non-automobile modes than did residents of Lafayette, controlling for relevant factors like income and <b>transit</b> service <b>levels.</b> The greatest differences were for shop trips under one mile. Rockridge residents also averaged substantially higher rates of non-work walk trips per day, matched by lower rates of daily auto travel, suggesting that walking substitutes for motorized travel, at the margin. Modal splits were more similar for work trips, confirming the proposition that neighborhood design practices exert their greatest influence on local shopping trips and other non-work purposes. For work trips, compact, mixed-use, and pedestrian-oriented development appears to have the strongest effect on access trips to rail stations, in particular inducing higher shares of access trips by foot and bicycle. ...|$|R
40|$|In {{planning}} {{communities with}} balanced transportation options {{that were once}} defined by the personal vehicle a comprehensive understanding multi-modal relationships in transportation is required. Public transportation provides a mechanism to move many people through the same space effectively increasing distance and access of a resident. The journey of a public transportation user begins the moment they leave the door on route to the transit stop and only concludes after they disembark the transit vehicle and traveled to their destination. Understanding {{the influence of the}} environment between that door and that stop is the objective of this research. This research is approached through quantitative analysis of the built environment and public transit ridership in the Region of Waterloo, Ontario, Canada. This is achieved through a bus stop level of analysis and linking the built environment within a standard 400 meter radius circular buffer to that stop. The response variable is provided in two forms, average boarding and alighting by stop through a one hour peak time or all day travel. A literature review informed the selection of intervening and predictor variables. Intervening variables were selected to inform characteristics known to influence public transit use. These variables were Population density, Employment density, <b>Transit</b> <b>level</b> of service and Transfer location. Predictor variables were selected to measure different characteristics of the pedestrian environment. These variables included: Land use Entropy, Sidewalk length, Intersection density, Traffic speed, Traffic signal density and a Ratio of sidewalk length to road length. Linear regression was used initially to correlate the relationship between public transit ridership and these variables. It was found that several of these variables showed no, or little statistical significance or impact. The best model was the variable combination Population density, Employment density, <b>Transit</b> <b>level</b> of service, Transfer location, Entropy and Ratio; with the response variable measuring All day average boarding and alighting correlated to an adjusted R² of 0. 436. It is found that the predictor variables have little impact on the adjusted R²; however, they are statistically significant in their relationship to ridership. Spatial regression is then used to further examine this relationship. This is conducted using the built environment variables identified as most influential using linear regression. Here it is found that the intervening variables correlate higher with ridership when a spatial lag model is used. The predictor variables however fail to achieve significance. It is concluded that the pedestrian environment has a low impact on overall public transportation ridership patterns. The pedestrian environment is however significant in informing analysis of the built environment around public transit stops. This research informs academics quantifying the built environment for both public transit and pedestrian use. The conclusions suggest that sparse pedestrian infrastructure will not define ridership but an increase in the pedestrian environment supports a public transit system. Several variables examined here can inform planners and academics in their methods for conducting similar research supporting multi-modal travel...|$|E
40|$|BRT (Bus Rapid Transit) {{system is}} a newly {{developed}} urban transit mode. It was introduced into China market and achieved speedy development in the last decade. Until now, more than 20 cities have already established their own BRT system and put into operation. However, public transport operators in China cities do not give enough attention {{to the quality of}} service provided by the BRT system. As a consequence, lack of attraction {{is one of the major}} barriers for BRT system widely development. In this situation, this study established a framework for BRT service quality analysis and applied it in Hefei BRT Route 1. This framework integrates both objective and subjective scenario. In subjective scenario, a customer satisfaction survey is conducted for BRT passengers. In the survey, customers’ satisfaction levels towards different aspects of BRT service and their travel characteristics are collected. With the results of data analysis, objective measurement is followed. Objective measurement focuses on service performance measurement. Such measurement is based on criteria for public <b>transit</b> <b>level</b> of service. Combining the results of the customer satisfaction survey and site observation, a comprehensive assessment of a transit system’s quality of service can be conducted. By analyzing the BRT system’ service quality, improvement recommendations to current BRT system in terms of BRT running way, BRT station, BRT vehicle and BRT operation system are proposed. Additionally, for better BRT service evaluation, special criteria for level of BRT service are required in future research. published_or_final_versionTransport Policy and PlanningMasterMaster of Arts in Transport Policy and Plannin...|$|E
40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages 74 - 49). This research aims {{to evaluate}} the relationship between weekday light rail ridership and station access features present within one half-mile of each station. All 53 stations associated with the San Diego Trolley network were examined. Ninety independent variables were collected spanning the following categories: <b>transit</b> <b>level</b> of service, densities and socio-economic status, land use, mobility factors, and personal safety. Station-level ridership data (i. e. boarding and alighting counts) served as the dependent variable. A Pearson's r correlation test was run to determine which independent variables exhibited at least a low to moderate association with trolley ridership. Based on these results two multivariate regression models were created to estimate ridership. Model 1 includes all stations that {{are a part of}} the San Diego Trolley network. Model 2 excludes the San Ysidro Transit Center located adjacent to the United States-Mexico Border as ridership is heavily influenced by patrons originating from Mexico while the station's buffer only accounts for land area on the domestic side. Although not all hypothesized relationships were validated, both models displayed positive relationships between ridership and variables from each category. Recommendations for further study include a more robust collection of transit service level variables and parking data. A supplemental measure of ridership known as stop usage is also introduced. This measure calculates a percentage of use from the total vehicle load to express how each station is being utilized in comparison to others along the same light rail route. The measure is then compared to trends in connecting ridership and select demographic data...|$|E
40|$|Understanding {{the factors}} {{influencing}} transit ridership {{is central to}} decisions on transportation system investments and the pricing and deployment of transit services. Yet most previous analyses of transit ridership have examined one or just a few systems, have not included many of the control variables thought to influence transit use, and have not addressed the simultaneous relationship between transit supply and demand. This study addresses the shortcomings in the previous research by (1) conducting a cross-sectional analysis of transit use in 265 urbanized areas, (2) testing an array of variables measuring transit system characteristics, auto system characteristics, geography, metropolitan economy, and population characteristics, and (3) constructing two-stage least squares regression models to account for simultaneity between supply and demand. We find {{that most of the}} variation in transit ridership can be explained by (1) the size (population and area) of the metropolitan area, (2) the vitality of the regional economy (median housing costs), and (3) the share of the population with low levels of private vehicle access (carless households). We find further that transit patronage is to a lesser extent, explained by <b>transit</b> service <b>levels</b> and fares. The observed influence of fares on ridership is consistent with the literature. Likewise, the relative influence of <b>transit</b> service <b>levels</b> on ridership is greater than the influence of transit fares. Finally, our separation of transit service supply into two variables – an instrumental control variable and a residual policy variable – allows for more nuanced assessments of the ridership effects of changes in transit service...|$|R
