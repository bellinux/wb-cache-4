5|$|Besides {{being the}} capital city, Kota Kinabalu {{is also the}} main {{industrial}} and commercial centre for Sabah. <b>The</b> <b>economy</b> <b>is</b> dominated by the primary sector of industry. Historically, the secondary sector dominated the economy, but due to rapid urbanisation and economic development, this sector of <b>the</b> <b>economy</b> <b>is</b> slowly diminishing. More recently, a move towards a more tertiary-based industry has become more apparent, especially {{with regards to the}} boom in the tourism industry. Many state-level, national-level and international commercial banks, as well as some insurance companies have their headquarters or branches here. The overseas Chinese population also contributes to the development of KK since their immigration in the late 19th century. Their original role involved 'coolie' (slavery work) and today many Chinese work as shopowners.|$|E
5|$|For example, if {{one assumes}} that the economy's {{available}} quantities of factors of production do not change over time and that technological progress does not occur, if <b>the</b> <b>economy</b> <b>is</b> operating on the PPF, production of guns {{would need to be}} sacrificed to produce more butter. If production is efficient, the economy can choose between combinations (points) on the PPF: B if guns are of interest, C if more butter is needed, D if an equal mix of butter and guns is required.|$|E

5|$|Malawi {{is among}} the world's least {{developed}} countries. Around 85% of the population live in rural areas. <b>The</b> <b>economy</b> <b>is</b> based on agriculture, and {{more than one-third of}} GDP and 90% of export revenues come from this. In the past, the economy has been dependent on substantial economic aid from the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund (IMF), and other countries.

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>economy</b> <b>is</b> mainly {{based on}} {{agriculture}} and this, along with tourism, {{has contributed to}} the rural and seaside character of the Riding. These aspects are also reflected in the places of interest to visitors and major landmarks, which include historic buildings, nature reserves and the Yorkshire Wolds Way long-distance footpath. The open and maritime aspects and lack of major urban developments have also led to the county being allocated relatively high targets for the generation of energy from renewable sources.|$|E
5|$|A PPF (production {{possibility}} frontier) typically {{takes the}} form of the curve illustrated above. An economy that is operating on the PPF is said to be efficient, meaning that {{it would be impossible to}} produce more of one good without decreasing production of the other good. In contrast, if <b>the</b> <b>economy</b> <b>is</b> operating below the curve, it is said to be operating inefficiently because it could reallocate resources in order to produce more of both goods or some resources such as labor or capital are sitting idle and could be fully employed to produce more of both goods.|$|E
5|$|As a seaside resort, <b>the</b> <b>economy</b> <b>is</b> mainly based around tourism; {{there are}} several hotels and guest houses near the seafront, to {{accommodate}} the influx of visitors during the summer. The High Street {{has a variety of}} shops and services, and there are a small number of factories. The elderly population has led to many health and social care jobs at local care homes.

5|$|Eastern South Dakota {{is home to}} most of the state's population, and the area's {{fertile soil}} is used to grow a variety of crops. West of the Missouri, {{ranching}} is the predominant agricultural activity, and <b>the</b> <b>economy</b> <b>is</b> more dependent on tourism and defense spending. Most of the Native American reservations are in West River. The Black Hills, a group of low pine-covered mountains sacred to the Sioux, are in the southwest part of the state. Mount Rushmore, a major tourist destination, is there. South Dakota has a temperate continental climate, with four distinct seasons and precipitation ranging from moderate in the east to semi-arid in the west. The state's ecology features species typical of a North American grassland biome.|$|E
5|$|England {{is highly}} industrialised, {{but since the}} 1970s {{there has been a}} decline in {{traditional}} heavy and manufacturing industries, and an increasing emphasis on a more service industry oriented economy. Tourism has become a significant industry, attracting millions of visitors to England each year. The export part of <b>the</b> <b>economy</b> <b>is</b> dominated by pharmaceuticals, cars (although many English marques are now foreign-owned, such as Land Rover, Lotus, Jaguar and Bentley), crude oil and petroleum from the English parts of North Sea oil along with Wytch Farm, aircraft engines and alcoholic beverages.|$|E
5|$|In {{the context}} of a PPF, {{opportunity}} cost {{is directly related to the}} shape of the curve (see below). If the shape of the PPF curve is a straight-line, the opportunity cost is constant as production of different goods is changing. But, opportunity cost usually will vary depending on the start and end points. In the diagram on the right, producing 10 more packets of butter, at a low level of butter production, costs the loss of 5 guns (shown as a movement from A to B). At point C, <b>the</b> <b>economy</b> <b>is</b> already close to its maximum potential butter output. To produce 10 more packets of butter, 50 guns must be sacrificed (as with a movement from C to D). The ratio of gains to losses is determined by the marginal rate of transformation.|$|E

5|$|Malawi {{is among}} the world's least-developed countries. <b>The</b> <b>economy</b> <b>is</b> heavily based in agriculture, with a largely rural population. The Malawian {{government}} depends heavily on outside aid to meet development needs, although this need (and the aid offered) has decreased since 2000. The Malawian government faces challenges in building and expanding the economy, improving education, healthcare, environmental protection, and becoming financially independent amidst widespread overpopulation and unemployment. Since 2005, Malawi has developed several programs that focus on these issues, and the country's outlook appears to be improving, with {{a rise in the}} economy, education and healthcare seen in 2007 and 2008.|$|E
5|$|Rwanda is {{a country}} of few natural resources, and <b>the</b> <b>economy</b> <b>is</b> based mostly on {{subsistence}} agriculture by local farmers using simple tools. An estimated 90% of the working population farms, and agriculture constituted an estimated 32.5% of GDP in 2014. Farming techniques are basic, with small plots of land and steep slopes. Since the mid-1980s, farm sizes and food production have been decreasing, {{due in part to}} the resettlement of displaced people. Despite Rwanda's fertile ecosystem, food production often does not keep pace with population growth, and food imports are required.|$|E

5|$|Rwanda's economy {{suffered}} heavily {{during the}} 1994 genocide, with widespread loss of life, {{failure to maintain}} infrastructure, looting, and neglect of important cash crops. This caused a large drop in GDP and destroyed the country's ability to attract private and external investment. The economy has since strengthened, with per-capita GDP (PPP) estimated at $2,090 in 2017, compared with $416 in 1994. Major export markets include China, Germany, and the United States. <b>The</b> <b>economy</b> <b>is</b> managed by the central National Bank of Rwanda and the currency is the Rwandan franc; in August 2015, the exchange rate was 755 francs to the United States dollar. Rwanda joined the East African Community in 2007, and has ratified a plan for monetary union amongst the five member nations, which could eventually lead to a common East African shilling.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>economy</b> <b>is</b> heavily reliant upon {{remittances}} {{from overseas}} Filipinos, which surpass {{foreign direct investment}} {{as a source of}} foreign currency. Remittances peaked in 2010 at 10.4% of the national GDP, and were 8.6% in 2012 and in 2014, Philippines total worth of foreign exchange remittances was US$28 billion. Regional development is uneven, with Luzon â€“ Metro Manila in particular â€“ gaining most of the new economic growth {{at the expense of the}} other regions, although the government has taken steps to distribute economic growth by promoting investment in other areas of the country. Despite constraints, service industries such as tourism and business process outsourcing have been identified as areas with some of the best opportunities for growth for the country.|$|E
