5|$|Henry Herbert Southey, {{physician}} to the recently deceased George IV, had travelled in the Duke's train, as had Dr Hunter, professor of anatomy at the University of Edinburgh. The {{two of them}} rushed to Huskisson's side, joined shortly afterwards by Joseph Brandreth, a Liverpool surgeon who had been travelling behind Phoenix. The doctors suggested returning Huskisson to Liverpool for treatment, but George Stephenson insisted <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>better</b> to take him on to Manchester.|$|E
5|$|By 1959 the United States was {{concerned}} that the militarization of the Kola Peninsula would become the prime source of a Soviet attack on North America. A new discussion about location arose, with Alta and Kautokeino as the main alternatives. Banak was estimated to cost NOK4.9 million, NOK2.8 million less than Alta, had better instrument landing and weather conditions and allowed a longer runway. The main advantage of Alta was <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>better</b> suited for civilian traffic. The government and Parliament approved construction of Banak in 1959 on condition that it receive NATO funding.|$|E
5|$|In 1980-81 {{representatives from}} the Eastern Bloc nations met at the Kremlin to discuss the Polish situation. Brezhnev {{eventually}} concluded on 10 December 1981 <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>better</b> to leave the domestic matters of Poland alone, reassuring the Polish delegates that the USSR would intervene only if asked to. This effectively {{marked the end of}} the Brezhnev Doctrine. With domestic matters escalating out of control in Poland, Wojciech Jaruzelski imposed a state of war, the Polish version of martial law, on 12 December 1981.|$|E
30|$|This term “post-normal” has {{undergone}} some metamorphoses––some people, {{in particular in}} the blogosphere, claim <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> a concept, which would legitimize scientists to act as stealth advocates; <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> choice of scientists to engage in normal or post-normal science; <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> science by popular vote; also that post-normal science <b>would</b> <b>be</b> abnormal science. <b>It</b> should be stressed that the term is meant––at least here––as {{a description of a}} science, which is taken place in a specific socio-political context, not as a recipe of how to do science.|$|R

5|$|After {{the initial}} concerts, the group flew to New York's Record Plant Studios at Lambert's suggestion, for studio recordings. The group {{were joined by}} guests Al Kooper on Hammond organ, Ken Ascher on piano and Leslie West on guitar. Townshend used a 1957 Gretsch guitar, {{given to him by}} Joe Walsh, during the session and it went on to become his main guitar for studio recording. Lambert's {{participation}} in the recording was minimal, and he proved to be unable to mix the final recordings. He had started taking hard drugs, while Townshend was drinking brandy regularly. After returning to Britain, engineer Glyn Johns made safety copies of the Record Plant material but decided <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>better</b> to re-record it from scratch at Olympic Sound Studios in Barnes.|$|E
5|$|Gates McFadden {{returned}} {{to the role of}} Doctor Beverly Crusher in the third season, the character had been written out for season two and replaced with Diana Muldaur playing Doctor Katherine Pulaski. Roddenberry had ensured that Crusher was not written out permanently to allow for her return in the future. Keith DeCandido blamed her departure on Maurice Hurley. After he left the series, McFadden returned. Fans started a letter-writing campaign to reinstate McFadden throughout the second season. Both Roddenberry and Berman decided <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>better</b> to bring back McFadden than to look for a third doctor in three years as they agreed that the Pulaski character was not working.|$|E
5|$|In April 1963, Galaxy Publishing {{brought out}} {{the first issue of}} Worlds of Tomorrow, another science-fiction {{magazine}}, also edited by Pohl. The magazine published some well-received material and was profitable, but Guinn, the publisher and owner, decided in 1967 <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>better</b> to have Galaxy resume a monthly schedule; both Worlds of Tomorrow and Galaxy were bimonthly at that time, while If was monthly. With the August 1967 issue Worlds of Tomorrow was merged with If, though it was another year before Galaxy actually switched to a monthly schedule. By this time, If had become monthly again, starting with the July 1964 issue (though the schedule had an initial hiccup, omitting September 1964).|$|E

5|$|In Grenland, the {{metropolitan}} area surrounding Skien, {{there was a lot}} of opposition to the airline, and several local businesspeople claimed <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>better</b> if Norsk Air was awarded the contract, or Skien Airport was closed and locals instead used the nearby Sandefjord Airport, Torp. Norsk Air stated that it would not be possible for them to make money on the Skien–Oslo route; despite that, it operated from Skien to Bergen Airport, Flesland and Stavanger Airport, Sola. In 1993, Norsk Air announced that it would no longer fly from Skien, and would focus all their operations at Sandefjord. Teddy Air subsequently took over the Stavanger route, while the Bergen route was granted to Air Stord, despite Teddy Air having applied for the concession. In 1994, the company had a revenue of NOK7.5 million, and a NOK1 million profit.|$|E
5|$|Margret Reed {{had managed}} to save enough food for a Christmas pot of soup, {{to the delight of}} her children, but by January they were facing {{starvation}} and considered eating the oxhides that served as their roof. Margret Reed, Virginia, Milt Elliott, and the servant girl Eliza Williams attempted to walk out, reasoning <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>better</b> to try to bring food back than sit and watch the children starve. They were gone for four days in the snow before they had to turn back. Their cabin was now uninhabitable; the oxhide-roof served as their food supply, and the family moved in with the Breens. The servants went to live with other families. One day, the Graveses came by to collect on the debt owed by the Reeds and took the oxhides, all that the family had to eat.|$|E
5|$|Six {{divisions}} of MiG-9s, each with two regiments of 31 aircraft, {{were transferred to}} China in November–December 1950 for air defense and training duties. The 17th Guards Fighter Aviation Division (GIAD) defended Shenyang, the 20th Fighter Aviation Division (IAD) guarded Tangshan, and the 65th IAD protected Guangzhou. The 144th IAD defended Shanghai, the 309th guarded Gongzhuling and the 328th IAD protected Peking. These units later handed their aircraft over to the 6th, 7th, 12th, 14th, 16th, and 17th Fighter Divisions of the People's Liberation Army Air Force when their training was complete. The Chinese considered sending their MiG-9s to Korea in 1951 under Soviet pressure, but reconsidered when the PLAAF commanders reported that they believed <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>better</b> to retrain MiG-9 pilots on MiG-15s.|$|E

5|$|U.S. swimmer Michael Phelps {{set a new}} Olympic {{record of}} 50.58 to defend his title in the event, edging out Serbia's Milorad Čavić (50.59) by one {{hundredth}} of a second (0.01). He also earned his seventh Olympic gold at a single Games, tying Mark Spitz's 1972 record for the most gold medals. Australia's Andrew Lauterstein earned a bronze in 51.12, finishing in a close race against world record holder Ian Crocker by the slimmest margin. Phelps' triumph occurred after Čavić had remarked <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>better</b> for the sport if Phelps was defeated. Phelps' margin of triumph was so close that the Serbian team filed a protest, but after officials reviewed the video, the International Swimming Federation (FINA) announced that Phelps did touch the wall first and his victory would be upheld.|$|E
5|$|Bramblestar's Storm, {{the seventh}} volume in the Super Edition arc, {{features}} Bramblestar, {{the leader of}} ThunderClan. The book takes place after the Clans' victory over the Dark Forest cats. This book was released on 26 August 2014. All Clans are struggling due to the lake flooding; however, ThunderClan and ShadowClan appear to be suffering most. Deaths of Clanmates leads to tension and grief between those in ThunderClan as they simultaneously also try to survive outside of their usual territory, having been displaced by the flooding. On a border patrol, Bramblestar encounters some housecats that are taken into the Clan until they can return home. Bramblestar becomes close {{to one of the}} housecats, Jessy, which upsets Bramblestar's deputy (and former mate) Squirrelflight causing many quarrels between them. Ultimately, two of the housecats, Minty and Jessy, decide to leave, leaving only Frankie (later named Stormpaw) with ThunderClan. Jessy leaves because she feels <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>better</b> if Bramblestar and herself do not become mates because Bramblestar’s heart belongs with Squirrelflight. In the short manga chapter included at the book's end, it is revealed that Squirrelflight is pregnant with Bramblestar's kits.|$|E
5|$|In early 1938, both Jefferey and Cooper {{were sent}} back to Britain {{as part of the}} crew rotation. While docked in Hankou, Judy took a liking to another Pointer on board a French gunboat Francis Garnier. The two ship's {{companies}} held an impromptu wedding ceremony for the two dogs. The French Pointer, Paul, remained on the Gnat for three days before returning to his ship. Judy fell pregnant, and gave birth to thirteen puppies. Ten of them survived and were eventually given away to a variety of sources including the Francis Garnier and the American gunboat USS Guam. Judy was involved in an incident in October that year that resulted in the ending of her trips ashore in Hankou. Whilst being walked by two sailors from the Gnat, they were confronted by Japanese soldiers who pointed a loaded rifle at Judy. One of the soldiers was thrown into the Yangtze River by Leading Seaman Jack Law in response. During the following days, several Japanese officers came on board the Gnat and it was decided <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>better</b> for Judy to stay on the ship.|$|E

5|$|On 18 August 1939, in {{preparation}} for Fall Weiss (Case White)—the German invasion of Poland—Manstein was appointed Chief of Staff to Gerd von Rundstedt's Army Group South. Here he worked along with Rundstedt's Chief of Operations, Colonel Günther Blumentritt, to develop the operational plan. Rundstedt accepted Manstein's plan calling for the concentration {{of the majority of}} the army group's armoured units into Walther von Reichenau's 10th Army, with the objective of a decisive breakthrough which would lead to the encirclement of Polish forces west of the River Vistula. In Manstein's plan, two other armies comprising Army Group South, Wilhelm List's 14th Army and Johannes Blaskowitz's 8th Army, would provide flank support for Reichenau's armoured thrust towards Warsaw, the Polish capital. Privately, Manstein was lukewarm about the Polish campaign, thinking <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>better</b> to keep Poland as a buffer between Germany and the Soviet Union. He also worried about an Allied attack from the west once the Polish campaign was underway, which would draw Germany into a two-front war.|$|E
5|$|Reassigning {{the name}} Ficus maxima {{did not leave}} F. aurea as the oldest name for this species, as German naturalist Johann Heinrich Friedrich Link had {{described}} Ficus ciliolosa in 1822. Berg concluded that the species Link described was actually F. aurea, and since Link's description predated Nuttall's by 24 years, priority should {{have been given to}} the name F. ciliolosa. Since the former name was widely used and the name F. ciliolosa had not been, Berg proposed that the name F. aurea be conserved. In response to this, the nomenclatural committee ruled that rather than conserving F. aurea, <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>better</b> to reject F. ciliolosa. Conserving F. aurea would mean that precedence would be given to that name over all others. By simply rejecting F. ciliolosa, the committee left open the possibility that the name F. aurea could be supplanted by another older name, if one were to be discovered.|$|E
5|$|Six {{days after}} the attack on Centaur, a request {{was made by the}} Australian Department of Defence that the {{identification}} markings and lights be removed from Australian hospital ship Manunda, weapons be installed, and that she begin to sail blacked out and under escort. The conversion was performed, although efforts by the Department of the Navy, the Admiralty, and authorities in New Zealand and the United States of America caused the completed conversion to be undone. The cost of the roundabout work came to £12,500, and kept Manunda out of service for three months. On 9 June 1943, communications between the Combined Chiefs of Staff on the subject of hospital ships contained a section referring to the Manunda incident {{as a response to the}} attack on Centaur, with the conclusion that the attack was the work of an irresponsible Japanese commander, and <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>better</b> to wait until further attacks had been made before considering the removal of hospital ship markings.|$|E

5|$|Development of the PlayStation Vita port began {{shortly before}} the start of the game's service in 2014. The team formed a {{partnership}} with Sony to develop the title, but production ran into difficulties as the team attempted to create an experience of the same quality as the mobile version, along with adjusting the controls from touch-based to the button and joystick controls of the Vita. There was also some resistance from staff surrounding the usage of the Mana franchise and Oyamada's determination to bring Rise of Mana to consoles in the face of suggestions <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>better</b> to make a completely new game. When the project was proposed to Sony, the Unity technology built into the Vita was fairly new and did not make full use of the platform's processing power. In addition, the staff were unused to the version of Unity for the Vita. The team needed cooperation from both Sony and Unity Technologies to optimize the engine so the game could run on the new platform. By the time of the Vita version's announcement, only the preliminary development work had been completed, but development was proceeding according to plan. Technical troubles related to the game's performance persisted beyond this point, resulting in the release being delayed into the following year.|$|E
5|$|On 25 August 1980 the Soviet Politburo {{established}} a commission chaired by Mikhail Suslov {{to examine the}} political crisis in Poland that was beginning to gain speed. The importance of the commission was demonstrated by its composition: Dmitriy Ustinov (Minister of Defence), Andrei Gromyko (Minister of Foreign Affairs), Yuri Andropov (KGB Chairman) and Konstantin Chernenko, the Head of the General Department of the Central Committee and Brezhnev's closest associate. After just three days, the commission proposed {{the possibility of a}} Soviet military intervention, among other concrete measures. Troops and tank divisions were moved to the Soviet–Polish border. Later, however, the Soviet leadership {{came to the conclusion that}} they should not intervene in Poland. Stanisław Kania, the First Secretary of the PUWP, mooted the Soviet proposal for introducing martial law in Poland. Erich Honecker, the First Secretary of the East German Socialist Unity Party, supported the decision of the Soviet leadership, and sent a letter to Brezhnev and called for a meeting of the Eastern Bloc leaders to discuss the situation in Poland. When the leaders met at the Kremlin later that year, Brezhnev had concluded <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>better</b> to leave the domestic matters of Poland alone for the time being, reassuring the Polish delegation, headed by Kania, that the USSR would intervene only if asked to.|$|E
5|$|Ron Wolf, who {{had been}} the Oakland Raiders’ Director of Player Personnel since 1963 and was {{credited}} with much of their success, was hired as Vice President of Operations. Los Angeles Rams general manager Don Klosterman and former Kansas City Chiefs head coach Hank Stram were early candidates for the job; but Klosterman withdrew, and Stram was interested in a combined coach/general manager position. Wolf was directly responsible for the drafting of 20 of the Raiders’ 22 starters, and his effectiveness at scouting talent was believed to be a major reason for the Raiders’ being one of the few teams not to belong to a scouting combine. The Buccaneers quickly developed a Raiders flavor, choosing to hire a scouting staff rather than rely on the computerized scouting reports that almost all other teams were using, and hiring Raiders business manager Ken LaRue to serve in the same capacity. One of Wolf’s responsibilities was to assist in the hiring of a head coach. Wolf persuaded Culverhouse <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>better</b> for any prospect to gain a year of experience and knowledge in his present job, rather than be named at expansion time, when there was little or no advantage to having a coach in place.|$|E
