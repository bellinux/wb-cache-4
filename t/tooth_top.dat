40|$|Abstract. Conformal mapping {{with complex}} {{function}} based on plane elasticity mechanics is an analytical method for resolving stress and displacement {{at any point}} of a half-plane domain. Using complex function conformal mapping method {{in this article we}} investigated the relationship between load on tooth surface and maximum stress at tooth root for calculating the maximum compressive stress {{on the opposite side of}} working flank and maximum tensile stress on working flank side when loads are applied to <b>tooth</b> <b>top</b> and root of working flank side, respectively. The maximum tensile and compressive stress at the tooth root are the main forces that cause fatigue cracking of the tooth root, which may extend along the elastomer compound-cord interface resulting in shear cracking of the belt tooth. The results of our calculation reveal the mechanisms whereby tooth shear cracking causes fatigue failure of synchronic belt, which are consistent with the experimental research results of Lizuka...|$|E

In {{order to}} reduce the surface {{roughness}} and improve the manufacturing precision of the outer rotor surface of the cycloidal pump, the method that outer rotor tooth surface on the abrasive flow machining (AFM) is adopted. First of all, a power-law model to describe the form of abrasive flow was created, simulation analysis on AFM for the external rotor tooth surface, and the distribution of shear stress that the boundary layer abrasive subjected near the various parts of the outer rotor tooth surface can be draw. Then, choose abrasives with different particle size for processing.

40|$|This report {{contains}} {{results of}} experiments identifying thermo-physical properties of a gearbox oil mist. The {{main part of}} the report studies a dependency of a gear wheel windage power loss on the radial and axial gap between the wheel and its enclosure. This parametric study relies primarily on the results coming from numerical simulations (CFD analysis). For the default enclosure configuration the evaluated power dissipation is compared with the values obtained using theoretical relationships. The theory is based on one-dimensional turbulent velocity profiles over smooth and rough surfaces. A summary of the theoretical analysis and the derivations are also included in the report. influence of a tooth shape on the windage power loss is also studied using the numerical simulations. A change of a <b>tooth</b> <b>top</b> surface angle is technologically easily realizable adjustment, and can {{have a positive effect on}} the power loss reduction. In the report there are performed simulations for varying angles of this surface and the expected improvements in aerodynamic properties are confirmed. last part of the report contains the formulation of boundary conditions for numerical evaluation of gear wheel heat balance. This information is documented more in detail in related research reports. ...|$|E

50|$|The embouchure {{for single}} reed woodwinds like the {{clarinet}} and saxophone is formed by resting the reed upon the bottom lip, which {{rests on the}} teeth and {{is supported by the}} chin muscles and the buccinator muscles {{on the sides of the}} mouth.

In both saxophone and clarinet playing, the corners of the mouth are brought inwards (similar to a drawstring bag) in order to create a seal. With the less common double-lip embouchure, the top lip is placed under (around) the <b>top</b> <b>teeth.</b> In both instances, the position of the tongue in the mouth plays a vital role in focusing and accelerating the air stream blown by the player.
