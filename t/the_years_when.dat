5|$|A {{few days}} after Guest's arrival a young man arrived to {{practise}} in Bulawayo as an advocate, Robert Hudson. So began a friendship that was to endure {{for the rest of}} Hudson's life and through many vicissitudes– in the legal profession, on active service in the First World War, and during <b>the</b> <b>years</b> <b>when</b> they were both members of the Cabinet. Hudson, who for some years was Minister of Justice, became Chief Justice of Southern Rhodesia.|$|E
5|$|Between 1893 and 1897, <b>the</b> <b>years</b> <b>when</b> Bauer and Nold {{were also}} in the Western Penitentiary for their part in the {{assassination}} attempt, the three men surreptitiously produced 60 issues of a hand-written anarchist newsletter by transferring their work from cell to cell. They managed to send the completed newsletters, which they called Prison Blossoms, to friends outside the prison. Participating in Prison Blossoms, initially written in German and later in English, helped Berkman improve his English. He developed a friendship with the prison chaplain, John Lynn Milligan, who was a strong advocate {{on behalf of the}} prison library. Milligan encouraged Berkman to read books from the library, a process that furthered his knowledge of English.|$|E

5|$|In the Tyranni Triginta, {{the author}} 'Trebellius Pollio' {{sets out to}} chronicle 'the 30 usurpers who arose in <b>the</b> <b>years</b> <b>when</b> the Empire was ruled by Gallienus and Valerian'. The number 30 is evidently {{modelled}} on the notorious 'Thirty Tyrants' who ruled Athens {{after the end of}} the Peloponnesian War. The chapter contains 32 mini-biographies. They include two women, six youths, and seven men who never claimed the imperial power; one usurper of the reign of Maximinus Thrax, one of the time of Decius, and two of the time of Aurelian; and a number who are entirely fictitious: Postumus the Younger, Saturninus, Trebellianus, Celsus, Titus, Censorinus, and Victorinus Junior.|$|E
5|$|Jazz {{standards}} are musical compositions that are widely known, performed and recorded by jazz artists {{as part of}} the genre's musical repertoire. This list includes compositions written in the 1930s that are considered standards by at least one major fake book publication or reference work. Some of the tunes listed were already well known standards by the 1940s, while others were popularized later. Where appropriate, <b>the</b> <b>years</b> <b>when</b> the most influential recordings of a song were made are indicated in the list.|$|E

5|$|There is {{a strong}} {{tradition}} of home baking in Israel arising from <b>the</b> <b>years</b> <b>when</b> {{there were very few}} bakeries to meet demand. Many professional bakers came to Israel from Central Europe and founded local pastry shops and bakeries, often called konditoria, thus shaping local tastes and preferences. There is now a local style with a wide selection of cakes and pastries that includes influences from other cuisines and combines traditional European ingredients with Mediterranean and Middle Eastern ingredients, such as halva, phyllo dough, dates, and rose water.|$|E
5|$|Throughout {{the chaos}} that {{characterized}} <b>the</b> <b>years</b> <b>when</b> Emperor Dom PedroII was a minor, Inhaúma remained loyal to the government. He helped quell a military mutiny in 1831 and was involved in suppressing {{some of the other}} rebellions that erupted during that troubled period. He saw action in the Sabinada between 1837 and 1838, followed by the Ragamuffin War from 1840 until 1844. In 1849, after spending two years in Great Britain, Inhaúma was given command of the fleet that was instrumental in subduing the Praieira revolt, the last rebellion in imperial Brazil.|$|E

5|$|Alcibiades was {{a leading}} {{supporter}} of the Sicilian Expedition, and scholars have argued that, had that expedition been under Alcibiades's command instead of that of Nicias, the expedition might not have met its eventual disastrous fate. In <b>the</b> <b>years</b> <b>when</b> he served Sparta, Alcibiades {{played a significant role}} in Athens's undoing; the capture of Decelea and the revolts of several critical Athenian subjects occurred either at his suggestion or under his supervision. Once restored to his native city, however, he played a crucial role in a string of Athenian victories that eventually brought Sparta to seek a peace with Athens. He favored unconventional tactics, frequently winning cities over by treachery or negotiation rather than by siege. Alcibiades's military and political talents frequently proved valuable to whichever state currently held his allegiance, but his propensity for making powerful enemies ensured that he never remained in one place for long; and by the end of the war which he had helped to rekindle in the early 410s, his days of political relevance were a bygone memory.|$|E
5|$|During <b>the</b> <b>years</b> <b>when</b> the Gilbert and Sullivan operas {{were being}} written, Richard D'Oyly Carte also {{produced}} operas and plays by other writing teams, {{as well as}} other works to fill the Savoy Theatre in between new operas. Many of these were companion pieces to the Gilbert and Sullivan operas, as the Victorian audiences preferred long evenings in the theatre. Some, however, were new full-length pieces either for the Savoy or for Carte's touring companies, which toured the Gilbert and Sullivan operas, and these new works, extensively. Carte and Lenoir also continued to run his management agency. As an example of their level of activity, an 1881 souvenir programme commemorating the 250th performance of Patience in London and its 100th performance in New York states that, in addition to these two productions of Patience, Carte was simultaneously producing many other projects. These included two companies touring with Patience, two touring with other Gilbert and Sullivan operas, one touring with the operetta Olivette (co-produced with Charles Wyndham), one with Claude Duval in America, a production of Youth running at a New York theatre, a lecture tour by Archibald Forbes (a war correspondent) and productions of Patience, Pirates, Claude Duval and Billee Taylor in association with J. C. Williamson in Australia, among other things.|$|E

5|$|In <b>the</b> <b>years</b> <b>when</b> the Deccan Traps {{hypothesis}} {{was linked to}} a slower extinction, Luis Alvarez (who died in 1988) replied that paleontologists were being misled by sparse data. While his assertion was not initially well-received, later intensive field studies of fossil beds lent weight to his claim. Eventually, most paleontologists began to accept {{the idea that the}} mass extinctions {{at the end of the}} Cretaceous were largely or at least partly due to a massive Earth impact. Even Walter Alvarez has acknowledged that there were other major changes on Earth even before the impact, however, such as a drop in sea level and massive volcanic eruptions that produced the Indian Deccan Traps, and these may have contributed to the extinctions. The duration of the K-T extinction event was less than 10 ky, and the time span is too short to be explained by Deccan volcanism. Geophysical models and high-precision radiometric dating suggest that the Chicxulub impact could have triggered some of the largest Deccan eruptions, and potentially, could have triggered eruptions at active volcanoes anywhere on Earth.|$|E

5|$|The {{popularity}} of The Simpsons {{has made it}} a billion-dollar merchandising industry. The title family and supporting characters appear on everything from T-shirts to posters. The Simpsons {{has been used as}} a theme for special editions of well-known board games, including Clue, Scrabble, Monopoly, Operation, and The Game of Life, as well as the trivia games What Would Homer Do? and Simpsons Jeopardy!. Several card games such as trump cards and The Simpsons Trading Card Game have also been released. Many official or unofficial Simpsons books such as episode guides have been published. Many episodes of the show have been released on DVD and VHS over <b>the</b> <b>years.</b> <b>When</b> the first season DVD was released in 2001, it quickly became the best-selling television DVD in history, although it was later overtaken by the first season of Chappelle's Show. In particular, seasons one through seventeen have been released on DVD in the U.S. (Region 1), Europe (Region 2) and Australia/New Zealand/Latin America (Region 4). However, on April 19, 2015, Al Jean announced that the Season 17 DVD would be the last one ever produced, leaving the collection from Season 1 to 17, Season 20 (released out of schedule in 2009), with Seasons 18, 19, and 21 onwards unreleased. Jean also stated that the deleted scenes and commentary would try to be released to the Simpsons World app, and that they were pushing for Simpsons World to be expanded outside of the U.S. Two years later, however, on July 22, 2017, it was announced that Season 18 will be released on December 5, 2017 on DVD.|$|E
