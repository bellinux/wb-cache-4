5|$|As {{mentioned}} above {{in the section}} on balance, one effect of turning <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>wheel</b> is a roll moment caused by gyroscopic precession. The magnitude of this moment {{is proportional to the}} moment of inertia of <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>wheel,</b> its spin rate (forward motion), the rate that the rider turns <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>wheel</b> by applying a torque to the handlebars, and the cosine of the angle between the steering axis and the vertical.|$|E
5|$|Although {{longitudinally}} stable when stationary, bikes {{often have}} a high enough center of mass and a short enough wheelbase to lift a wheel off the ground under sufficient acceleration or deceleration. When braking, depending on {{the location of the}} combined center of mass of the bike and rider with respect to the point where <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>wheel</b> contacts the ground, bikes can either skid <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>wheel</b> or flip the bike and rider over <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>wheel.</b> A similar situation is possible while accelerating, but with respect to the rear wheel.|$|E
5|$|In {{the case}} of a front suspension, {{especially}} telescoping fork tubes, the increase in downward force on <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>wheel</b> during braking may cause the suspension to compress and the front end to lower. This is known as brake diving. A riding technique that takes advantage of how braking increases the downward force on <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>wheel</b> is known as trail braking.|$|E
50|$|Automobiles {{usually have}} parking brakes {{on the rear}} wheels. If the rear axle is jacked off the ground with only the parking brake set, the vehicle may roll on <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>wheels</b> and fall. Chocking <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>wheels</b> {{prevents}} this mishap.|$|R
50|$|In {{the case}} of tractor and truck pulling, the force to the pull the load is applied above the ground, and so it also acts to lift <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>wheels</b> and thus reduces the forward {{acceleration}} necessary to lift <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>wheels.</b>|$|R
50|$|Front-wheel drive (FWD) vehicles' engines drive <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>wheels.</b> Using <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>wheels</b> for {{delivery}} of power {{as well as}} steering allows the driving force {{to act in the}} same direction as the wheel is pointing. This layout is commonly used in modern passenger cars.|$|R
5|$|A {{factor that}} {{influences}} how easy or difficult a bike {{will be to}} ride is trail, the distance that <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>wheel</b> ground contact point trails behind the steering axis ground contact point. The steering axis is the axis about which the entire steering mechanism (fork, handlebars, front wheel, etc.) pivots. In traditional bike designs, with a steering axis tilted back from the vertical, positive trail tends to steer <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>wheel</b> into {{the direction of a}} lean, independent of forward speed. This can be simulated by pushing a stationary bike to one side. <b>The</b> <b>front</b> <b>wheel</b> will usually also steer to that side. In a lean, gravity provides this force. The dynamics of a moving bike are more complicated, however, and other factors can contribute to or detract from this effect.|$|E
5|$|Another {{factor that}} can also {{contribute}} to the self-stability of traditional bike designs is the distribution of mass in the steering mechanism, which includes <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>wheel,</b> the fork, and the handlebar. If the center of mass for the steering mechanism is in front of the steering axis, then the pull of gravity will also cause <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>wheel</b> to steer {{in the direction of a}} lean. This can be seen by leaning a stationary bike to one side. <b>The</b> <b>front</b> <b>wheel</b> will usually also steer to that side independent of any interaction with the ground. Additional parameters, such as the fore-to-aft position of the center of mass and the elevation of the center of mass {{also contribute to the}} dynamic behavior of a bike.|$|E
5|$|Slippery {{surfaces}} or bumpy surfaces. Under {{front wheel}} braking, the lower {{coefficient of friction}} may cause <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>wheel</b> to skid which often results {{in a loss of}} balance.|$|E
50|$|In some vehicles, manual locking hubs {{are used}} to engage <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>wheels.</b> This {{requires}} getting in/out of the vehicle to engage or disengage <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>wheels.</b> This {{may have to be}} done repeatedly if road conditions are irregular (shift from snow, then dry pavement, then snow again, repeatedly).|$|R
5000|$|Controlling {{understeer}} - During an understeer, <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>wheels</b> lose traction during cornering due {{to excessive}} throttle and this causes the speed difference between <b>the</b> left and <b>front</b> <b>wheels</b> to decrease. When the vehicle steers outwards from the intended trajectory, VSA intervenes by reducing engine power and if necessary, also braking <b>the</b> inner <b>front</b> <b>wheel</b> ...|$|R

5|$|The net {{aerodynamic}} drag forces {{may be considered}} to act at a single point, called the center of pressure. At high speeds, this will create a net moment about the rear driving wheel and result in a net transfer of load from <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>wheel</b> to the rear wheel. Also, depending on {{the shape of the}} bike and the shape of any fairing that might be installed, aerodynamic lift may be present that either increases or further reduces the load on <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>wheel.</b>|$|E
5|$|A {{measurement}} {{similar to}} trail, called either mechanical trail, normal trail, or true trail, is the perpendicular {{distance from the}} steering axis to the centroid of <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>wheel</b> contact patch.|$|E
5|$|The farther forward (closer {{to front}} wheel) {{the center of}} mass of the {{combined}} bike and rider, the less <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>wheel</b> has to move laterally {{in order to maintain}} balance. Conversely, the farther back (closer to the rear wheel) the center of mass is located, the more front wheel lateral movement or bike forward motion is required to regain balance. This can be noticeable on long-wheelbase recumbents, choppers, and wheelie bikes. It can also be a challenge for touring bikes that carry a heavy load of gear over or even behind the rear wheel. Mass over the rear wheel can be more easily controlled if it is lower than mass over <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>wheel.</b>|$|E
5000|$|The {{automatic}} transmission used on AWD equipped vehicles would normally send 90% {{of the engines}} torque to <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>wheels</b> and 10% to the rear wheels, using a computer-controlled, continuously variable, multi-plate transfer clutch. When <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>wheels</b> began to experience a loss of grip, the transmission automatically sent available torque to the rear wheels, up to 50:50 split between <b>the</b> <b>front</b> and rear <b>wheels</b> until grip was reestablished at <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>wheels,</b> without notifying <b>the</b> driver or occupants that torque was being redirected. When accelerating or driving uphill, the vehicles weight shifts rearward, reducing <b>front</b> <b>wheel</b> traction, causing <b>the</b> transmission to automatically send torque to the rear wheels to compensate. When braking or driving downhill, the vehicle's weight shifts towards <b>the</b> <b>front,</b> reducing rear <b>wheel</b> traction. The transmission again compensates by sending torque to <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>wheels</b> for better steering control and braking performance. If the automatic is placed in Reverse or [...] "1st" [...] gear, the transmission divides the torque 50:50 to both <b>front</b> and rear <b>wheels.</b> A limited slip rear differential was optional on the 1991 USA Sport Sedan (Legacy Turbo). However it was unavailable on the 92-94 USA Turbo.|$|R

50|$|Also, a drift is {{not likely}} to occur if the camber of the rear wheels is set too negative. On the other hand, if the camber of <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>wheels</b> is set too positive, they will break {{traction}} in the same moment the rear ones do, so the car will slide uncontrollably rather than pivoting around <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>wheels.</b>|$|R
5|$|The {{rear wheel}} is {{prevented}} from precessing as <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>wheel</b> does by friction of the tires on the ground, and so continues to lean {{as though it}} were not spinning at all. Hence gyroscopic forces do not provide any resistance to tipping.|$|E
5|$|The {{steering}} ratio is the ratio between the theoretical turning radius based on ideal tire {{behavior and the}} actual turning radius. Values less than one, where <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>wheel</b> side slip {{is greater than the}} rear wheel side slip, are described as under-steering; equal to one as neutral steering; and greater than one as over-steering. Values less than zero, in which <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>wheel</b> must be turned opposite the direction of the curve due to much greater rear wheel side slip than front wheel have been described as counter-steering. Riders tend to prefer neutral or slight over-steering. Car drivers tend to prefer under-steering.|$|E
5|$|Bicycles {{have been}} constructed, for {{investigation}} and demonstration purposes, with the steering reversed so that turning the handlebars {{to the left}} causes <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>wheel</b> {{to turn to the}} right, and vica versa. It is possible to ride such a bicycle, but it has been found that riders experienced with normal bicycles find it very difficult to learn, if they can manage it at all.|$|E
50|$|The Phantom VIII is {{the first}} Rolls-Royce to be fitted with four-wheel steering. The system turns the rear wheels in the {{opposite}} direction to <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>wheels</b> at speeds lower than 60 km/h to improve maneuverability. At speeds above this threshold the rear wheels turn {{in the same direction as}} <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>wheels</b> to increase high-speed stability.|$|R
5000|$|In 1965, noted American auto customizer Gene Winfield created The Reactor, a Citroën DS chassis, with a {{turbocharged}} [...] flat-six engine {{from the}} Corvair driving <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>wheels.</b> Since <b>the</b> DS {{already had the}} engine behind <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>wheels,</b> <b>the</b> longer engine meant only one row of seats. This was draped in a streamlined, low slung, aluminum body.|$|R

5|$|Downhill it is {{much easier}} to topple over <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>wheel</b> because the incline moves the line of mg closer to f. To try to reduce this {{tendency}} the rider can stand back on the pedals to try to keep m as far back as possible.|$|E
5|$|The {{role of the}} {{gyroscopic}} effect in most bike designs is to help steer <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>wheel</b> into {{the direction of a}} lean. This phenomenon is called precession and the rate at which an object precesses is inversely proportional to its rate of spin. The slower a front wheel spins, the faster it will precess when the bike leans, and vice versa.|$|E
5|$|Another {{contribution}} of gyroscopic effects is a roll moment generated by <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>wheel</b> during countersteering. For example, steering left causes {{a moment to}} the right. The moment is small compared to the moment generated by the out-tracking front wheel, but begins {{as soon as the}} rider applies torque to the handlebars and so can be helpful in motorcycle racing. For more detail, see the section countersteering, below, and the countersteering article.|$|E

5|$|Bikes may {{experience}} {{a variety of}} longitudinal forces and motions. On most bikes, when <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>wheel</b> is turned to {{one side or the}} other, the entire rear frame pitches forward slightly, depending on the steering axis angle and the amount of trail. On bikes with suspensions, either front, rear, or both, trim is used to describe the geometric configuration of the bike, especially in response to forces of braking, accelerating, turning, drive train, and aerodynamic drag.|$|E
5|$|For {{a sample}} {{motorcycle}} moving at 22m/s (50mph) {{that has a}} front wheel with a moment of inertia of 0.6kg·m2, turning <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>wheel</b> one degree in half a second generates a roll moment of 3.5N·m. In comparison, the lateral force on the front tire as it tracks {{out from under the}} motorcycle reaches a maximum of 50N. This, acting on the 0.6m (2ft) height of the center of mass, generates a roll moment of 30N·m.|$|E
5|$|The {{combination}} of these two opposite torques creates a resulting yaw torque on <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>wheel,</b> and its direction {{is a function of}} the side-slip angle of the tire, the angle between the actual path of the tire and the direction it is pointing, and the camber angle of the tire (the angle that the tire leans from the vertical). The result of this torque is often the suppression of the inversion speed predicted by rigid wheel models described above in the section on steady-state turning.|$|E

50|$|Camera dollies {{have several}} {{steering}} mechanisms {{available to the}} dolly grip. The typical mode is rear-wheel steering, where <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>wheels</b> remain fixed, while the wheels closest to the operating handle are used to turn. A second mode, round steering, causes <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>wheels</b> to turn {{in the opposite direction}} from the rear wheels. This mode allows the dolly to move in smooth circles and is frequently used when the dolly is on curved track. A third mode, called crab steering, is when <b>the</b> <b>front</b> <b>wheels</b> steer in <b>the</b> same direction as the rear wheels. This allows the dolly to move in a direction diagonal to <b>the</b> <b>front</b> end of <b>the</b> dolly.|$|R
