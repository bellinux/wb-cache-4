40|$|Disparities in verbal ability, a major {{predictor}} of later life outcomes, have generated widespread debate, but {{few studies have}} been able to isolate neighborhood-level causes in a developmentally and ecologically appropriate way. This study presents longitudinal evidence from a large-scale study of > 2, 000 children ages 6 – 12 living in Chicago, along with their caretakers, who were followed wherever they moved in the U. S. for up to 7 years. African-American children are exposed in such disproportionate numbers to concentrated disadvantage that white and Latino children cannot be reliably compared, calling into question <b>traditional</b> <b>research</b> <b>strategies</b> assuming common points of overlap in ecological risk. We therefore focus on trajectories of verbal ability among African-American children, extending recently developed counterfactual methods for time-varying causes and outcomes to adjust {{for a wide range of}} predictors of selection into and out of neighborhoods. The results indicate that living in a severely disadvantaged neighborhood reduces the later verbal ability of black children on average by ≈ 4 points, a magnitude that rivals missing a year or more of schooling...|$|R

We applied the NM to samples of Dutch cancer patients (N = 485) and Dutch healthy adults (N = 1742) who completed the 36 -item Short Form Health Survey (SF- 36).

40|$|The “logical {{problem of}} {{language}} acquisition ” {{refers to the}} fact that the evidence available to the child appears to underdetermine the knowledge of language that is ultimately attained (e. g., Wexler and Culicover (1980)). There are two <b>traditional</b> <b>research</b> <b>strategies</b> that try to address this problem. One explores the idea that the environment may in fact be richer than it appears at first (e. g., Tomasello (2003)), and the other pursues the idea that it is the child’s innate language-specific structures that are richer than commonly thought (e. g., Pinker (1995)). In both of these research traditions, the focus has mostly been on child acquisition of a first language, but there is evidence that the logical problem of language acquisition arises in the case of adult second language acquisition as well (e. g., Schwartz and Sprouse (2000), White (2003)). This case is messier in some ways, in that adults bring a wider range of prior experience to the task than do children, and the adult’s environment may be more varied as well. When the adult’s environment consists of instructional (classroom) settings, there may be additional factors that complicate the acquisition picture. One such factor arises from the simple fact that in the typical classroom setting, the learner is placed in an environment where s/he is surrounded by people who don’t know the language in question (or at best, have incomplete knowledge of it). There are thus some inherent difficulties i...|$|R

40|$|We {{present a}} field study {{concerning}} the introduction {{in a group}} of teenagers living with their families in a multicultural dwelling cooperative sited in Padua, Italy, of the competence in information technology required to build a web site of their cooperative. The research group proposed the construction of the website, assisted the teenagers in the acquisition of the necessary skills, and was involved in the complex social processes which accompanied the acquisition of the competence and the design of the website by the teenagers. The research group expected to find emergent patterns of the different specific cultural, religious, and ethnic "identities" which the teenagers were supposed to possess. On the contrary, we found that in everyday life the teenagers presented themselves, at first sight, just as teenagers instead than as persons possessing a single and fixed "identity". Instead of preexisting and fixed "identities" mobile "identification processes" emerged in the different specific situations of everyday life (Baumann, 1996, 1999; Mantovani, 2000, 2004). Everyday practices such as discourse, cooperation during the learning activities, and narratives of the teenagers about themselves were video recorded and analyzed using a methodology of etnographically oriented discourse analysis (Duranti, 1994, 1997); the key concepts used were those of the situational "positioning" of the actors, of the "system of activity" (Goodwin, 1994) in which the actors were involved, and of the overall "history of the project". The corpus of video records analyzed amounts to 30 hours for 20 sessions and collected during a period of 12 months. A pragmatic perspective has been proved necessary both theoretically and methodologically to study intercultural processes. To study the interactions taking place among people coming from different backgrounds requires that no previous, fixed, stereotyped categories: new meanings are created moment-by-moment by social actors through their practical intercourse. Current cross-cultural research considers "cultures" as homogeneous, stable and coherent entities capable of controlling the actions and the minds of the person who "belong" to them. In this way the "agency" which actors constantly exhibit in their everyday life is ignored: actors are supposed to act constantly according to their "culture" (Triandis, 1989; Markus and Kitayama, 1991). "Culture" itself undergoes a process of "reification" in cross cultural research: it ceases to be a narrative, controversial construction and it is transformed in a "badge" used to distinguish the members of mutually exclusive social groups (Amselle, 1990, 2001. On the contrary, a pragmatic approach allows to focus on the performative aspects of the interaction, in which actors re-define themselves through their practices adapting themselves smoothly to different situations. In order to understand what happens in intercultural contexts the <b>traditional</b> <b>research</b> <b>strategy</b> that uses general concepts to illuminate specific situations is no longer valid, just because the "general", "universal" concepts are put at risk in the intercultural contexts (Chakrabarty, 2000). The only viable methodological route available in situations in which "the other" has to be recognized as (at least partially) "other" is that of relying on the multiple, changing, often dissonant narratives offered by the actors involved...|$|R
