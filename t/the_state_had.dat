5|$|A trade {{treaty was}} signed between the Commonwealth and Prussia, {{unfavorable}} to the Commonwealth. The Partition {{cut off the}} Commonwealth's access to the Baltic Sea, and <b>the</b> <b>state</b> <b>had</b> {{no choice but to}} accept the high tariffs imposed by Prussia.|$|E
5|$|In 1950, the Finnish {{government}} was criticised for ignoring other options and buying only Vanajas, which {{were said to}} be overpriced. <b>The</b> <b>state</b> <b>had</b> ordered 650 vehicles, spread over several years, and this tied the state's hands in equipment buying for a long period.|$|E

5|$|In December 1863, Bramlette {{addressed}} the General Assembly, declaring that <b>the</b> <b>state</b> <b>had</b> fulfilled its quota of soldiers for the Union army.

5|$|Urban {{populations and}} the {{military}} preferred to consume their grain {{in the form of}} bread. Mills and commercial ovens were usually combined in a bakery complex.

5|$|A 1947 {{newspaper}} article {{estimated that the}} new park would have 50,000visitors that year, and detailed the work <b>the</b> <b>state</b> <b>had</b> done since acquiring the land. The Falls Trail through the glens was rebuilt, all the stone steps were replaced, and signs were added. Out of concern for greater safety, footbridges with handrails replaced those made from hewn logs, overhanging rock ledges were removed in places, and the trail was rerouted near some falls. In {{the southern end of}} the new park, the state built the Evergreen Trail past Adams Falls, as well as a new parking area for 200cars and a concession stand, both along Pennsylvania Route 118 (PA 118).|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} {{children}} were killed, injured or orphaned by the violence. Organisations such as Citizens' Initiative reported that the violence resulted in the disturbance of children's studies {{and that there was}} a lack of counselling. Students at Gujarat University were unable to take examinations, which were cancelled due to the chances of disruption. While other schools in <b>the</b> <b>state</b> <b>had</b> to postpone or cancel exams, it was reported that some schools held examinations under police protection. It was also reported that many students were forced to leave their studies due to lack of funds or to earn a livelihood because they had lost income-earning members of their families.|$|E
50|$|From the 1950s, {{the major}} concern for <b>the</b> <b>state</b> <b>has</b> been {{economic}} development. Most of <b>the</b> <b>state’s</b> development <b>has</b> been concentrated in its capital of Guadalajara, resulting is economic inequality in <b>the</b> <b>state.</b>|$|R

5|$|Analyzing the results, The Burlington Free Press {{pointed to}} Shumlin's {{relatively}} soft numbers in opinion polls – {{he was in}} the mid-40s in the last four polls of the race – as evidence that voters were dissatisfied with the progress <b>the</b> <b>state</b> <b>had</b> made in instituting single-payer health care, with rising property taxes, and with the unsuccessful roll-out of Vermont Health Connect, the state's federal health care exchange. Shumlin's internal polls showed a close race and he touted an endorsement from U.S. Senator Patrick Leahy to try to put him over 50%. By comparison, Milne lagged in fundraising and spending, with $100,000 available compared to Shumlin's $1.1 million, which meant that he could not afford to pay for polling.|$|E
5|$|As of 2004, <b>the</b> <b>state</b> <b>had</b> 3.5 million {{foreign-born}} residents (15.6 {{percent of}} the state population), of which an estimated 1.2 million are illegal.

This was the fifth highest percentage of any state in the country. In 2015, the population of illegal immigrants living in Texas was around 800,000.|$|E
5|$|Conner {{alleged that}} Patton {{arranged}} regulatory favors for {{the nursing home}} while the affair was ongoing. Two months after Conner said she ended the affair, Birchtree Healthcare was cited by state regulators for numerous violations of health and safety rules. By July 2002, <b>the</b> <b>state</b> <b>had</b> pulled all Medicare and Medicaid payments from the facility, which soon went bankrupt. Conner further alleged that the state investigation of Birchtree was retaliation by Patton for her ending of the affair.|$|E

5|$|Desha's major {{accomplishment}} {{as governor}} {{was in the}} area of internal improvements. In 1825, he convinced the legislature to fund the creation of the Louisville and Portland Canal on the Falls of the Ohio. The canal opened in 1830, and proved very profitable, so much so that Desha lamented the fact that <b>the</b> <b>state</b> <b>had</b> split the cost of the project – and consequently, its profits – with the federal government and private investors. He also urged state investment in a turnpike joining Maysville to Louisville via Lexington. He advocated using excess money earmarked for education to construct hard-surfaced roads in the state, but the General Assembly was less responsive to this suggestion.|$|E
5|$|He inaugurated {{his career}} as a {{legislator}} under Prince Ghica. On December 22, 1855, legislation he drafted with Petre Mavrogheni regarding the abolition of slavery was passed by the Boyar Divan. This involved the freeing of privately owned Roma slaves, as those owned by <b>the</b> <b>state</b> <b>had</b> been set free by Prince Sturdza in January 1844. Kogălniceanu claimed to have personally inspired the measure. Ghica was prompted to complete the process of liberation by the fate of Dincă, an educated Roma cook who had murdered his French wife and then killed himself after being made aware {{that he was not going}} to be set free by his Cantacuzino masters.|$|E
5|$|In 1980, the Catawba {{sued the}} state of South Carolina and 76 public and private land-owning entities, as named representatives of a {{defendant}} class estimated at 27,000 persons. The tribe contended that the Treaty of Nation Ford was void because of the federal Nonintercourse Act and because <b>the</b> <b>state</b> <b>had</b> not {{lived up to its}} obligations (by delaying the purchase for 2.5 years, by spending only $2,000 on the new reservation, and buying land for the new reservation from within the old reservation). The tribe sought both possession of the lands and 140 years of trespass damages. The Catawba were represented by the Native American Rights Fund (NARF).|$|E

5|$|In January 1976, California's {{study of}} the {{economic}} impact of its law repealing prohibitions of use went into effect. The law reduced the penalty for personal possession of an ounce or less of marijuana from a felony to a citable misdemeanor with a maximum fine of $100. Possession of more than an ounce was made a misdemeanor, making the maximum fine $500 and/or six months in jail. After the law went into effect, the state's annual spending towards marijuana laws went down 74%. Prior to the law, <b>the</b> <b>state</b> <b>had</b> been spending from $35 million to $100 million.|$|E
5|$|It was legislated in 1966 to run {{parallel}} to the New Jersey Turnpike from exit 13 until North Avenue, where it would turn northwest and intersect U.S. Route 1/9 near the airport. The routing was eventually shifted to begin from a new interchange along the New Jersey Turnpike. A total of $50 million in funding was allocated for {{the road and the}} Port Authority of New York and New Jersey was responsible for designing the road. <b>The</b> <b>state</b> <b>had</b> wanted the port authority to pay for construction; however it was ruled that they could not build the road. Construction on Route 81 took place between 1979 and 1982.|$|E
5|$|Joseph Brooks ran for {{governor}} representing the Brindle Tails. Brooks was a very vocal supporter of civil rights for former slaves, but also a supporter of re-enfranchisement for ex-Confederates, which was the sentiment nationally of Liberal Republicans. When the Democrats met, they agreed not only to not run a candidate, but even to support Joseph Brooks, {{as long as the}} election was fair and legal, since elections in <b>the</b> <b>state</b> <b>had</b> been wrought with fraud for five years. The issue of re-enfranchisement of Confederates was central to the election.|$|E
