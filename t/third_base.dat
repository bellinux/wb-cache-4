5|$|In 1997, the Orioles signed {{free agent}} shortstop Mike Bordick from the Oakland Athletics and moved Ripken back to <b>third</b> <b>base</b> permanently.

40|$|In the {{evolution}} of highly conserved genes, a few "synonymous" substitutions at <b>third</b> <b>bases</b> that would not alter the protein sequence are forbidden or very rare, presumably {{as a result of}} functional requirements of the gene or the messenger RNA. Another 10 % or 20 % of codons are significantly less variable by synonymous substitution than are the majority of codons. The changes that occur at the majority of <b>third</b> <b>bases</b> are subject to codon usage restrictions. These usage restrictions control sequence similarities between very distant genes. For example, 70 % of <b>third</b> <b>bases</b> are identical in calmodulin genes of man and trypanosome. Third-base similarities of distant genes for conserved proteins are mathematically predicted, {{on the basis of the}} G+C composition of <b>third</b> <b>bases.</b> These observations indicate the need for reexamination of methods used to calculate synonymous substitutions...|$|R
