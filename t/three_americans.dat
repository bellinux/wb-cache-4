5|$|In {{the early}} hours of 21 June a force of about 50 Japanese troops slipped out of the Pocket and {{attempted}} to attack Australian positions on Labuan. Different groups of Japanese troops attacked a prisoner of war enclosure, dock facilities and No. 1 Strip, but all were defeated by Australian and American logistics personnel and engineers. A total of 32 Japanese personnel were killed around Victoria, and another 11 were killed at the airfield. <b>Three</b> <b>Americans</b> and two Australians were killed in these engagements.|$|E
5|$|In women's hockey, Canadians Jayna Hefford and Hayley Wickenheiser {{hold the}} record for total medals (five), having won four gold and one silver. Their team mate Caroline Ouellette also won four gold medals. Four other athletes have won four medals: two Canadians - Becky Kellar and Jennifer Botterill with three gold and a silver - and <b>three</b> <b>Americans</b> - Angela Ruggiero, Jenny Potter (each with one gold, two silver and one bronze) and Julie Chu (three silver and one bronze).|$|E
5|$|The most {{significant}} impact from Typhoon Hester was felt in South Vietnam, where winds {{in excess of}} 155km/h (100mph) caused extensive damage to several United States Army bases. The hardest hit base was in Chu Lai where <b>three</b> <b>Americans</b> were killed. At least 75percent of the structures in the base sustained damage and 123aircraft were damaged or destroyed. Newspaper reports indicated that 100Vietnamese lost their lives due to the storm, including 33following a plane crash near Quy Nhơn. In {{the wake of the}} storm, the South Vietnamese government provided the hardest hit areas with relief funds and supplies.|$|E

5|$|The final {{attack on}} 28 February also {{began with a}} mortar attack, but the {{communist}} assault wave was broken up by mortar fire, {{and was forced to}} withdraw to the east. <b>Three</b> <b>Americans</b> were wounded. A clearing patrol later revealed that the Viet Cong had inserted a mortar team {{to the edge of the}} rubber trees by night in a Lambretta and a cart and had then manhandled the tubes into position. 3 RAR's defence of FSB Andersen was the first occasion in the history of their operations in Vietnam that an Australian fire support base had been subjected to a ground assault while during all three attacks the cavalry and artillery in support had played a key role in the defence. Throughout the later part of the operation the patrolling rifle companies had systematically searched the AO and although contact was infrequent the patrols had been effective in denying the subsequent use of the area to launch rocket attacks against the bases in Long Binh and Bien Hoa.|$|E
5|$|Late on {{the evening}} of 17/18 February the Viet Cong and North Vietnamese Army {{launched}} an assault on FSB Andersen. The first attack was preceded by a heavy rocket and mortar barrage {{in the early hours of}} the morning, followed by two waves of infantry each of company size. The attack focused on the south-west of the perimeter manned by 3 RAR's echelon and mortar platoon, as well as an American medium artillery battery. The perimeter wire was subsequently breached, but the attack was repulsed by mortar counter-battery fire, Claymore mines and the heavy weight of machine-gun fire from armoured personnel carriers and the American gunners. The communist barrage had had a devastating effect, falling among the American and New Zealand gun positions, the mortar lines and the battalion echelon, as well as scoring a direct hit on an Australian engineer standing patrol. A second attack shortly after, this time from the north, was repelled by small-arms fire from the forward Australian pits. Total Viet Cong casualties were unknown, although four bodies were found on the wire at dawn, while numerous bloodstains and bandages were found during a later sweep of the perimeter and a suspected mortar base-plate location. Seven Australians and one American were killed, while 22 Australians and <b>three</b> <b>Americans</b> were wounded.|$|E
5|$|On Mono Island, {{the main}} landing {{along the south}} coast had been {{achieved}} with relative ease, with few casualties although they had to fend off some attacks that night. However, Logan Force which had landed as planned at Soanotalu, {{on the opposite side}} of the island to 29th and 36th Battalions, experienced some difficulty. Initially unopposed, a defensive perimeter had been established and the American technicians got to work. Over the next three days, some contact had been made with Japanese soldiers, which had evaded the New Zealanders to the south, looking to escape the island by seizing a barge. During the evening of 1 November, a party of 80 Japanese, began attacking Logan Force. A small group of six soldiers from 34th Battalion plus <b>three</b> <b>Americans</b> held a blockhouse throughout the night and by dawn, over 50 Japanese had been killed for the loss of five men. By early November, Japanese resistance had largely been overcome although patrols still made contact with small parties of Japanese and on 12 November, Mono Island was considered to be secure. By this stage, the battalion had reassembled on Mono Island. There were still isolated Japanese that needed to be captured or killed and patrols were ongoing well into January 1944. By this stage, the battalion was commanded by Lieutenant Colonel J. Reidy, taking over from Eyre who was now too old for active service and had returned to New Zealand.|$|E

25|$|Corny Johnson and Dave Albritton {{provided}} {{one of the}} Trials' top highlights in {{the high}} jump, tying for first place at the world record height of 6ftin (2.07m). Both jumpers cleared the record height on their second attempts; Johnson broke the record first, with Albritton following shortly after. Behind the top two the level was surprisingly weak, with only Thurber clearing 6ft6in (1.98m). Walter Marty, who held the previous world record of 6ftin (2.06m), was eliminated, as was indoor world record holder Ed Burke. At the Olympics the <b>three</b> <b>Americans</b> swept the medals; Johnson, who had placed fourth at the 1932 Games, won from Albritton and Thurber.|$|E

25|$|Regardless, MACSOG began {{a series}} of {{operations}} that would continue to grow in size and scope over the next eight years. The Laotian operations were originally run by a Command and Control (C) headquarters located at Da Nang. The teams, usually <b>three</b> <b>Americans</b> and three to 12 indigenous mercenaries, were launched from Forward Operating Bases (FOBs) located in the border areas (originally at Kham Duc, Kontum, and Khe Sanh). After in-depth planning and training, a team was helilifted over the border by aircraft provided by the U.S. Marine Corps (who operated in the I Corps area) or by dedicated Republic of Vietnam Air Force H-34 Kingbee helicopters of the 219th Squadron, which would remain affiliated with MACSOG for its entire history.|$|E
25|$|Although Operation Candor was {{a welcome}} relief for correspondents, it did not halt the media's dubiousness {{concerning}} {{the efficacy of the}} Saigon government or further American involvement with it. Reporters had also become quite aware that all sides (the South Vietnamese and American governments, the U.S. mission, MACV, the Buddhists, and the communists) were trying to manipulate them. It did not help matters that JUSPAO was also MACV's propaganda arm, a fact that was well known to news correspondents. The American public was also dissatisfied with the course of events in Vietnam. A January 1965 Gallup poll indicated that two out of <b>three</b> <b>Americans</b> agreed that the country would never form a stable government and that four out of five Americans felt that the communists were winning. Few, however, wanted a unilateral U.S. withdrawal and 50 percent believed that the U.S. was obliged to defend independent nations from communist aggression.|$|E

25|$|The 100-meter dash was Cartwright's only Trials event; she won from 16-year-old Betty Robinson, the {{eventual}} Olympic champion. Future star Stella Walsh was narrowly eliminated in the semi-finals. The 800 meters was {{run as a}} time trial with several heats; both Boeckmann in heat one and Wilson in heat three broke the previous national record. Women's middle distance races were a rarity in the United States, and the <b>three</b> <b>Americans</b> selected were not expected to make any impact in Amsterdam; MacDonald's sixth place in the Olympic final (2:22.6e) was a surprise. The high jump title was decided in a jump-off; Wiley, {{who went on to}} win bronze in Amsterdam, defeated newcomer Shiley by clearing 4ftin (1.52m) a second time. Reichardt, the discus champion, had not competed since 1926 but made a comeback for the Olympics; the American record in this event was relatively easy to break, as in previous years American meets had used a heavier imperial discus.|$|E
25|$|One of the {{earliest}} psychology societies was La Société de Psychologie Physiologique in France, which lasted 1885–1893. The first meeting of the International Congress of Psychology took place in Paris, in August 1889, amidst the World's Fair celebrating the centennial of the French Revolution. William James was one of <b>three</b> <b>Americans</b> among the four hundred attendees. The American Psychological Association was founded soon after, in 1892. The International Congress continued to be held, at different locations in Europe, with wider international participation. The Sixth Congress, Geneva 1909, included presentations in Russian, Chinese, and Japanese, as well as Esperanto. After a hiatus for World War I, the Seventh Congress met in Oxford, with substantially greater participation from the war-victorious Anglo-Americans. In 1929, the Congress took place at Yale University in New Haven, Connecticut, attended by hundreds {{of members of the}} American Psychological Association Tokyo Imperial University led the way in bringing the new psychology to the East, and from Japan these ideas diffused into China.|$|E
