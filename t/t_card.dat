50|$|<b>Test</b> <b>Card</b> W is {{an updated}} 16:9 (1.78:1) {{widescreen}} version of <b>Test</b> <b>Card</b> F. It {{first appeared in}} November 1999 alongside <b>Test</b> <b>Card</b> J, with which it bears some similarities.|$|R
50|$|In {{the digital}} age <b>Test</b> <b>Card</b> F and its {{variants}} are very infrequently broadcast, as downtime in schedules has largely become {{a thing of the}} past. Several variations of TCF have been screened, among them <b>Test</b> <b>Card</b> J (digitally enhanced), <b>Test</b> <b>Card</b> W (widescreen) and its high definition variant, which is sometimes erroneously referred to as <b>Test</b> <b>Card</b> X.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Test</b> <b>Card</b> J is {{an updated}} version of <b>Test</b> <b>Card</b> F, and first {{appeared}} in November 1999. It includes the following changes relative to its predecessor: ...|$|R
25|$|The BBC's <b>Test</b> <b>Card</b> F image {{includes}} {{a picture of}} a game. In the updated version, <b>Test</b> <b>Card</b> J, the game's X indicates the exact center of the screen.|$|R
50|$|Since {{the late}} 1990s, Bubbles has only very rarely {{appeared}} on television as <b>Test</b> <b>Card</b> F has been discontinued, and <b>Test</b> <b>Cards</b> J and W are very seldom shown {{due to the}} advent of digital television and 24-hour programming.|$|R
50|$|Nick UK {{showed a}} parody of <b>Test</b> <b>Card</b> F during {{off-time}} circa 1997, using <b>Test</b> <b>Card</b> N. It features a big Nick splat logo in the center, and pictures of stars (like Tommy from Rugrats, or Stimpy from Ren & Stimpy) on other areas.|$|R
50|$|An {{updated version}} of <b>Test</b> <b>Card</b> F has {{appeared}} on Sky HD, with television presenter Myleene Klass {{playing the role of}} Carole Hersee. Unlike the original static <b>Test</b> <b>Card</b> F, Klass steps out of the frame and gives viewers a ten-minute guide to high-definition television.|$|R

50|$|A 1080 line {{variant of}} <b>Test</b> <b>Card</b> W (sometimes {{referred}} to unofficially as <b>Test</b> <b>Card</b> X) was {{used on the}} now-defunct BBC HD channel. It could be viewed every two hours {{as part of the}} BBC HD preview slot. When viewed, it was enhanced with 5.1 surround sound tests. A BLITS tone is played alongside, which plays test tones at different frequencies from each of the different surround sound speakers, with markers (such as L, R, C, LFE, Ls, Rs) appearing inside some of the grey boxes of the testcard. BBC HD closed in March 2013; therefore <b>Test</b> <b>Card</b> X is no longer broadcast.|$|R

50|$|However, during {{more recent}} years in which the <b>Test</b> <b>Card</b> is only played during {{engineering}} tests on the BBC, it is more common to hear a steady tone of various pitches accompanied by a female talking clock. <b>Test</b> <b>Card</b> music had ceased to be frequently heard in the 1980s (though it continued to be played over Pages from Ceefax until the termination of that service on 23 October 2012).|$|R
50|$|The BBC {{occasionally}} uses {{a modified}} version, <b>Test</b> <b>Card</b> G, which it first used in 1971, {{and although it}} was also used {{for a period of}} time by the IBA it eventually abandoned the <b>Test</b> <b>Card</b> G and developed its own test card called the ETP-1 which was brought into use on ITV from 1979 onwards. Many broadcasters using a 625 line PAL system use some form of the Philips Pattern.|$|R

50|$|During {{the last}} {{appearance}} of Otis the Aardvark on CBBC, Otis appeared in <b>Test</b> <b>Card</b> F frame, finishing the Noughts and Crosses puzzle on the blackboard.|$|R
50|$|Bubbles' {{original}} {{body colour}} was blue and white, but the BBC engineers decided that green was also needed within {{the scene as}} the other two television primary colours, red and blue, were already shown. A green wrap was made to cover his body and {{this can be seen}} in <b>Test</b> <b>Card</b> J and <b>Test</b> <b>Card</b> W, along with more of his body shown in the photograph — revealing {{the fact that he is}} actually holding a piece of chalk, which was not previously visible.|$|R
5000|$|From 1983 <b>Test</b> <b>Card</b> F was {{gradually}} seen less due to Ceefax pages being shown more; {{by the late}} 1980s <b>Test</b> <b>Card</b> F was only seen {{early in the morning}} as all the remaining gaps in the day's programming were filled with programmes. 1992 was the last year that <b>Test</b> <b>Card</b> F was seen daily with music; 1995 was the last year it was seen with music, although it was seen until 1999 with just tone output; CEEFAX was broadcast either with tone or music. However, since the closure of CEEFAX, the shutdown of analogue television transmissions, and the imposition budgetary constraints, a new revision of the testcard can be seen daily on BBC TWO and BBC TWO HD {{at the end of the}} [...] "This is BBC TWO" [...] transmission. Each morning, as the segment concludes, the testcard is broadcast for approximately one minute.|$|R
50|$|Langford's {{career had}} a notable {{relationship}} with the BBC. Some of his compositions and arrangements were used as <b>Test</b> <b>Card</b> music in the 1960s and '70s, with such titles as Hebridean Hoedown, The Lark in the Clear Air and Royal Daffodil being remembered by <b>Test</b> <b>Card</b> aficionados. He also wrote and arranged music for Friday Night is Music Night, as well as numerous other BBC programmes. A CD of his original compositions for orchestra performed by the BBC Concert Orchestra conducted by Rumon Gamba was released in 2003.|$|R
50|$|Sun {{television}} columnist Ally Ross uses {{a parody}} of <b>Test</b> <b>Card</b> F, replacing Carole Hersee with himself, the blackboard text always referencing an event from that week's popular TV programmes.|$|R
5000|$|On the Cracking Contraptions episode [...] "The Tellyscope", {{the test}} card appears, {{but it is}} nicknamed <b>Test</b> <b>Card</b> [...] "W&G", and Bubbles and Carole are {{replaced}} by Shaun and Wallace.|$|R
5000|$|The {{image has}} been re-aligned within <b>Test</b> <b>Card</b> J {{such that the}} cross on the noughts and crosses board is at the exact centre of the screen, as was {{originally}} intended.|$|R
50|$|Up {{until the}} UK's digital switchover, the testcard made an annual {{appearance}} during the annual RBS (rebroadcast standby) Test Transmissions and, until 2013, during the BBC HD preview loop, which used <b>Test</b> <b>Card</b> W.|$|R
5000|$|Hersee {{published}} a monograph in 1967 entitled [...] "A Survey of the Development of Television <b>Test</b> <b>Cards</b> Used in the BBC", but left the BBC in 1979 {{to work for}} a private engineering company.|$|R
50|$|A {{parody of}} <b>Test</b> <b>Card</b> F appears {{numerous}} {{times in the}} music video of Moving to New York by the band The Wombats. Carole Hersee is replaced by images of the band in various poses.|$|R
50|$|Along {{with his}} <b>Test</b> <b>Card</b> F co-star Carole Hersee, Bubbles has {{appeared}} {{for an estimated}} total of 70,000 hours on television, equivalent to nearly eight whole years, {{which is more than}} any living person other than Carole (who still owns Bubbles).|$|R
50|$|Originally, <b>Test</b> <b>Card</b> F was a {{photographic}} slide {{made up of}} two transparencies in perfect registration—one containing the colour information and the other the monochrome background. The card was converted to electronic form in 1984 when electronic storage became possible.|$|R
25|$|Throughout {{the course}} of Life on Mars, Sam's {{uncertainty}} is reinforced by frequent paranormal phenomena, such as hearing voices and seeing images from 2006 on radios, telephones, and televisions. The voices discuss his medical condition, leading him to partially {{believe that he is}} in a coma. Other elements suggest to him that he is insane, such as his frequent and unexpected encounters with the <b>Test</b> <b>Card</b> Girl from <b>Test</b> <b>Card</b> F, who speaks directly to him. Annie Cartwright partially persuades Sam that he is truly in 1973, arguing that his mind would be unable to fabricate the amount of detail and tangibility in the world where he finds himself, evidence that he is in fact in 1973.|$|R
50|$|In the 1970s ITV satirical series, End of Part One, {{there is}} an {{audition}} for a new test card 'girl'. This features various adults (including a bearded man) sitting behind a giant test-card cutout and attempting the same pose as <b>Test</b> <b>Card</b> F.|$|R
