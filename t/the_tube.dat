5|$|Another very {{important}} mode is the G mode (G from graphite). This mode corresponds to planar vibrations of carbon atoms and {{is present in}} most graphite-like materials. G band in SWCNT is shifted to lower frequencies relative to graphite (1580cm−1) and is split into several peaks. The splitting pattern and intensity depend on <b>the</b> <b>tube</b> structure and excitation energy; they can be used, though with much lower accuracy compared to RBM mode, to estimate <b>the</b> <b>tube</b> diameter and whether <b>the</b> <b>tube</b> is metallic or semiconducting.|$|E

5|$|The {{rarefaction}} {{is reflected}} off the sloping end {{wall of the}} clarinet mouthpiece. The opening between the reed and the mouthpiece makes very little difference to {{the reflection of the}} rarefaction wave. This is because the opening is very small compared to the size of <b>the</b> <b>tube,</b> so almost the entire wave is reflected back down <b>the</b> <b>tube</b> even if the reed is completely open at the time the wave hits (image 3).|$|E

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>tubes,</b> shown below, {{which are}} reddish brown from corrosion, are carbon steel <b>tubes</b> and run <b>the</b> {{height of the}} radiant section. <b>The</b> <b>tubes</b> are a {{distance}} away from the insulation so radiation can be reflected {{to the back of}} <b>the</b> <b>tubes</b> to maintain a uniform tube wall temperature. <b>Tube</b> guides at <b>the</b> top, middle and bottom hold <b>the</b> <b>tubes</b> in place.|$|R
5000|$|Two {{species of}} filter-feeding {{crustaceans}} from different families may make {{their homes in}} <b>the</b> Chaetopterus <b>tube,</b> Polyonyx gibbesi (family Porcellanidae) and Pinnixa chaetopterana (family Pinnotheridae) a third species, Tumidotheres maculatus is known to sometimes inhabit <b>the</b> <b>tubes.</b> Polyonyx and Pinnixa are almost always present in <b>the</b> <b>tubes,</b> generally {{as a pair of}} crabs, and both species may inhabit <b>the</b> <b>tubes</b> at <b>the</b> same time. However, breeding pairs of either species do not share <b>the</b> <b>tubes</b> with adults of the other species.

5|$|When the rarefication wave {{reaches the}} other (open) end of <b>the</b> <b>tube,</b> air rushes in {{to fill the}} slight vacuum. A {{little more than a}} 'neutral' amount of air enters <b>the</b> <b>tube</b> and causes a {{compression}} wave to travel back up <b>the</b> <b>tube</b> (image 4). Once the compression wave reaches the mouthpiece end of the 'tube', it is reflected again back down the pipe. However at this time, either because the compression wave 'bumped' the reed or because of the natural vibration cycle of the reed, the gap opens and another 'puff' of air is sent down the pipe.|$|E

5|$|After the trachea {{has been}} intubated, a balloon cuff is {{typically}} inflated {{just above the}} far end of <b>the</b> <b>tube</b> to help secure it in place, to prevent leakage of respiratory gases, and to protect the tracheobronchial tree from receiving undesirable material such as stomach acid. <b>The</b> <b>tube</b> is then secured to the face or neck and connected to a T-piece, anesthesia breathing circuit, bag valve mask device, or a mechanical ventilator. Once {{there is no longer a}} need for ventilatory assistance and/or protection of the airway, the tracheal tube is removed; this is referred to as extubation of the trachea (or decannulation, in the case of a surgical airway such as a cricothyrotomy or a tracheotomy).|$|E
5|$|Although starfish do {{not have}} many {{well-defined}} sense organs, they are sensitive to touch, light, temperature, orientation {{and the status of}} the water around them. <b>The</b> <b>tube</b> feet, spines and pedicellariae are sensitive to touch. <b>The</b> <b>tube</b> feet, especially those at the tips of the rays, are also sensitive to chemicals, enabling the starfish to detect odour sources such as food. There are eyespots at the ends of the arms, each one made of 80–200 simple ocelli. These are composed of pigmented epithelial cells that respond to light and are covered by a thick, transparent cuticle that both protects the ocelli and acts to focus light. Many starfish also possess individual photoreceptor cells in other parts of their bodies and respond to light even when their eyespots are covered. Whether they advance or retreat depends on the species.|$|E
5|$|An old style mercury {{barometer}} {{consists of a}} vertical glass tube about 1cm in diameter partially filled with mercury, and with a vacuum (called Torricelli's vacuum) in the unfilled volume (see diagram to the right). Notice that the mercury level {{at the center of}} <b>the</b> <b>tube</b> is higher than at the edges, making the upper surface of the mercury dome-shaped. The center of mass of the entire column of mercury would be slightly lower if the top surface of the mercury were flat over the entire cross-section of <b>the</b> <b>tube.</b> But the dome-shaped top gives slightly less surface area to the entire mass of mercury. Again the two effects combine to minimize the total potential energy. Such a surface shape is known as a convex meniscus.|$|E

5|$|Apart {{from their}} {{function}} in locomotion, <b>the</b> <b>tube</b> feet act as accessory gills. The water vascular system serves to transport oxygen from, {{and carbon dioxide}} to, <b>the</b> <b>tube</b> feet and also nutrients from the gut to the muscles involved in locomotion. Fluid movement is bidirectional and initiated by cilia. Gas exchange also takes place through other gills known as papulae, which are thin-walled bulges on the aboral surface of the disc and arms. Oxygen is transferred from these to the coelomic fluid, which acts as the transport medium for gasses. Oxygen dissolved in the water is distributed through the body mainly by the fluid in the main body cavity; the circulatory system may also play a minor role.|$|E

50|$|In service, it {{was found}} that <b>the</b> <b>tubes</b> did not affect the {{steaming}} capacity of the boiler to any significant extent.

50|$|This {{process is}} used because the {{high-temperature}} superconductors are too brittle for normal wire forming processes. <b>The</b> <b>tubes</b> are metal, often silver. Often <b>the</b> <b>tubes</b> are heated to react {{the mix of}} powders. Once reacted <b>the</b> <b>tubes</b> are sometimes flattened to form a tape-like conductor.

40|$|Abstract. Aluminum or CFRP (Carbon Fiber Reinforced Plastics) tube {{subjected}} to axial loading sustains load, and absorbs energy during axial collapse. <b>The</b> aluminum <b>tube</b> absorbs energy by stable plastic deformation, while <b>the</b> CFRP <b>tube</b> with higher specific strength and stiffness {{than those of}} <b>the</b> aluminum <b>tube</b> absorbs energy by unstable brittle failure. To achieve a synergy effect by combining the two members, aluminum/CFRP compound tubes were manufactured, which are composed of aluminum tubes wrapped with CFRP outside aluminum tubes with different fiber orientation angle of CFRP and number of plies. The axial quasi-static collapse tests were performed for <b>the</b> <b>tubes.</b> <b>The</b> collapse characteristics of <b>the</b> <b>tubes</b> were {{compared with those of}} respective aluminum tube and CFRP circular tube. Test results showed that the collapse of <b>the</b> aluminum/CFRP <b>tubes</b> complemented unstable brittle failure of <b>the</b> CFRP <b>tube</b> due to <b>the</b> ductile characteristics of <b>the</b> inner aluminum <b>tube.</b> <b>The</b> collapse modes and the absorbed energy were influenced by the fiber orientation angle of CFRP and the number of plies. The absorbed energy per unit mass, which is in the light-weigh aspect, was higher in <b>the</b> aluminum/CFRP compound <b>tube</b> than in <b>the</b> aluminum <b>tube</b> or <b>the</b> CFRP <b>tube</b> alone...|$|R

50|$|Evaporation {{of liquid}} film in film {{evaporators}} {{is very important}} in order to cool the flowing liquid and the surface on which the liquid flows. It can also increase the concentration of the components in the liquid. The climbing/falling film plate evaporator is specifically designed to produce a thin film during both the climbing and falling phases. For the climbing film evaporators, the feed is introduced at the bottom of <b>the</b> <b>tubes.</b> Evaporation causes <b>the</b> vapor to expand thus causing a thin film of liquid to rise along <b>the</b> <b>tubes.</b> <b>The</b> vapor shear will push the thin film to climb up the wall of <b>the</b> <b>tubes.</b> <b>The</b> feed for the falling film evaporator on the other hand is introduced at the top of <b>the</b> <b>tubes.</b> <b>The</b> liquid flows down <b>the</b> <b>tubes</b> and it will get evaporated as it descends. The flow of the liquid down <b>the</b> <b>tubes</b> is driven by the vapor shear stress and the gravitational forces. The effect of the vapor shear and the gravity will lead to a higher flow rates and shorter residence time. The flow of the thin liquid film in the falling film evaporator is possible in two ways: cocurrent and countercurrent. It is cocurrent if the vapor is drawn from the top to the bottom of <b>the</b> <b>tubes</b> and vice versa for the countercurrent flow. The cocurrent flow will increase the flow rates resulting in a shorter residence time. The type of flow can be described in figure 2.|$|R
