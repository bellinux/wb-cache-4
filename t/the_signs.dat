40|$|<b>The</b> <b>sign</b> {{problem in}} quantum Monte Carlo {{calculations}} is analyzed using the meron-cluster solution.

5|$|Because of the {{importance}} of tourism to the Croatian economy, areas frequented by tourists (or near major tourist routes) have been given priority for demining. Other safety-related areas receiving demining priority are settlements, commercial and industrial facilities and all documented minefields. Agricultural land, infrastructure and forests are grouped in three priority categories depending on their economic significance. National parks in Croatia were also demined as top-priority areas, along with areas significant for fire protection. Theft of minefield signs is a significant problem, and is particularly pronounced in areas with concerns among the local population that <b>the</b> <b>signs</b> harm tourism. <b>The</b> <b>signs</b> are regularly replaced, sometimes with concrete or masonry structures to display them instead of metal poles. Since the 1990s, only one tourist has been injured by a land mine in Croatia.|$|E
