5|$|First {{the hopeful}} note: There are faint signs the <b>tinkering</b> <b>with</b> Temperatures format {{could make the}} series funny later on, {{but only if the}} writing improves. The show now leaves most of the mugging to Lynde and no longer insists that each regular is wacky. It's all feeble stuff but the cast is vastly {{improved}} and the new approach portends to better things ahead.|$|E
5|$|Having {{decided on}} a {{location}} and date, there still remained the matter {{of what would be}} tested. John Challens, whose weapons electronics group at Aldermaston had to produce the bomb assembly, wanted to know the configuration of Green Granite. Cook ruled that it would use a Red Beard Tom, and would fit inside a Blue Danube casing for air dropping. The design was frozen in April 1956. There were two versions of Orange Herald, large and small. They had similar cores, but the large version contained more explosive. Both designs were frozen in July. The Green Bamboo design was also nominally frozen, but <b>tinkering</b> <b>with</b> it continued. On 3 September, John Corner suggested that Green Granite could be made smaller by moving the Tom and Dick closer together. This design became known as Short Granite.|$|E
5|$|Steins;Gate {{is set in}} {{the summer}} of 2010, {{approximately}} one year after the events that took place in Chaos;Head, in Akihabara. Physical locales of Akihabara like the Radio Kaikan building can be spotted in the game. According to Chiyomaru Shikura, who headed the planning of Steins;Gate, Akihabara was chosen because it is an easy place for acquiring hardware parts, which makes it the ideal place for people interested in inventing and <b>tinkering</b> <b>with</b> things. The notion of time and time traveling are the main themes of the game. The concept of cause and effect is featured prominently in the game as the protagonist travels back in time numerous times to perform different actions in an attempt to alter {{what has happened in the}} future.|$|E

50|$|Numerous reports—all of them unreliable—began {{to reach}} Le Verrier from other amateurs {{who claimed to}} have seen unexplained transits. Some of these reports {{referred}} to observations made many years earlier, and many could not be properly dated. Nevertheless, Le Verrier continued to <b>tinker</b> <b>with</b> Vulcan’s orbital parameters as each new reported sighting reached him. He frequently announced dates of future Vulcan transits, and when these failed to materialize, he <b>tinkered</b> <b>with</b> the parameters some more.|$|R

5|$|To more {{effectively}} minimize recurrence {{and severity of}} epistaxis, other options {{may be used in}} conjunction with therapies listed above. Intravenously administered anti-VEGF substances such as bevacizumab (brand name Avastin), pazopinab and thalidomide or its derivatives interfere with the production of new blood vessels that are weak and therefore prone to bleeding. Due to the past experiences with prescribing thalidomide to pregnant women to alleviate symptoms of nausea and the terrible birth defects that followed, thalidomide is a last resort therapy. Additionally, thalidomide can cause neuropathy. Though this can be mitigated by <b>tinkering</b> <b>with</b> dosages and prescribing its derivatives such as lenolidomide and pomalidomide, many doctors prefer alternative VEGF inhibitors. Bevacizumab has been shown to significantly reduce the severity of epistaxis without side effects.|$|E

On 3 September, Corner suggested that Green Granite could be made smaller by moving the Tom and Dick closer together. This design became known as Short Granite. By January 1957, with the tests just months away, a tentative schedule had emerged. Short Granite would be fired first. Green Bamboo would follow if Short Granite was unsuccessful, but be omitted as unnecessary otherwise. Orange Herald (small) would be fired next. Because Short Granite was too large to fit into a missile or guided bomb, this would occur whether or not Short Granite was a success. Finally, Green Granite would be tested. In December 1956, Cook had proposed another design, known as Green Granite II. This was smaller than Green Granite I, and could fit into a Yellow Sun casing that could be used by the Blue Steel guided missile then under development; but it could not be made ready to reach Christmas Island before 26 June 1957, and extending Operation Grapple would cost another ₤1.5 million.|$|E

The brothers then bought the plane from its owner with the very little money they had and rebuilt it in the shed at their family farmhouse. This was their first experience <b>tinkering</b> <b>with</b> an aircraft as a self-taught restoration project, followed by {{the making of a}} Glasair 1 they saw introduced at the 1980 EAA Convention and Fly-In (now called AirVenture) in Oshkosh, Wisconsin. David Gustafson of Aircraft Spruce reported that the only way the Klapmeier brothers' parents would lend them the money to buy a Glasair was if they wrote up a business plan explaining why constructing a homebuilt would further their professional lives.|$|E
25|$|Temporarily {{buoyed by}} an inheritance, Nancarrow {{traveled}} to New York City in 1947 {{and bought a}} custom-built manual punching machine to enable him to punch the piano rolls. The machine was an adaptation of one used in the commercial production of rolls, and using {{it was very hard}} work and very slow. He also adapted the player pianos, increasing their dynamic range by <b>tinkering</b> <b>with</b> their mechanism and covering the hammers with leather (in one player piano) and metal (in the other) so as to produce a more percussive sound. On this trip to New York, he met Cowell and heard a performance of John Cage's Sonatas and Interludes for prepared piano (also influenced by Cowell's aesthetics), which would later lead to Nancarrow's modestly experimenting with prepared piano in his Study No. 30.|$|E
25|$|Of late, {{he came in}} for {{criticism}} for his <b>tinkering</b> <b>with</b> the batting lineup and unorthodox cricket coaching methods. Several senior Indian players whom Chappell coached have come out to criticize his methods, including Virender Sehwag, Harbhajan Singh, and Zaheer Khan His comments also did not go down well with the Indian public. However, his coaching and methods were not very effective as India crashed out of the World Cup in the first round, {{the first time since}} 1992. Embattled coach Greg Chappell resigned after reports that none of the senior players, including Tendulkar, were happy with him and his coaching methods. His rift with arguably India's most successful captain, Sourav Ganguly and poor performance of team in 2007 world cup, made Chappell, a dark figure in the history of Indian Cricket.|$|E

He was described by The New York Times as [...] "a hyperintellectual singer and songwriter who liked to <b>tinker</b> <b>with</b> pop the way a born mathematician <b>tinkers</b> <b>with</b> numbers", having [...] "a shimmery-sweet pop sensibility, in the tradition of Brian Wilson and Alex Chilton." ...|$|R
25|$|Subrahmanyam long {{argued for}} {{revamping}} India's national security decision-making apparatus, {{and was also}} vociferous in his criticism of several governments' efforts at <b>tinkering</b> <b>with</b> the system. He was particularly critical of successive Indian governments' lackadaisical approach to long-term strategic planning, and their similar attitudes {{to the creation of}} specialised positions and resources. One noted target of such criticism was his civil service batch mate Brajesh Mishra, who served as both National Security Adviser—when that post was created—and Principal Secretary to Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee from 1998 to 2004. Subrahmanyam repeatedly called for bifurcating both key posts, in commentary sometimes so strong that it even appeared to precipitate a public spat between the two. This bifurcation of posts was finally done by Prime Minister Manmohan Singh, in consultation with Subrahmanyam, upon assuming office in 2004. The establishment of a National Defence University by the government is also something he long demanded. Despite several recommendations, including those from a government committee Subrahmanyam himself chaired, this is yet to be set up.|$|E

500|$|The {{first five}} hundred years of Omni-Tek's control of Rubi-Ka were marked with an {{exemplary}} worker treatment record. However, as time passed, their policies degraded. Their scientists' <b>tinkering</b> <b>with</b> the mutating effects of Notum on the colonists in a quest for efficiency lead to large numbers of failed experiments. Survivors of these experiments became the game's four playable races, or Breeds, each designed by Omni-Tek to specialize in a type of work. Together with the original [...] "Solitus" [...] race, the genetically engineered Herculean [...] "Atrox," [...] the intelligent [...] "Nanomages," [...] and the nimble [...] "Opifexes," [...] they continued their labor {{in the midst of}} an increasingly hostile and totalitarian culture. This caused a significant number of workers to rebel, and begin to trade stolen Notum to a rival corporation. These rebel groups, collectively calling themselves the Clans, fought a series of wars with Omni-Tek over the next several centuries.|$|E
500|$|Mullally {{revealed}} that the show's writing team was [...] "notorious for <b>tinkering</b> <b>with</b> the script's laugh lines", even during the actual taping of the episodes. She hoped they would resist that urge for the live episode. Messing, however, was sure that the writers would interfere during the broadcasts; [...] "I have a gut feeling that, like, 10 minutes before we go they'll be like, 'Oh, no, no, you know what? Change this line to this. Now we're locked – go.'" [...] Prior to the live episode, the cast had shot the second, third and fourth episodes of the season. Shortly before this episode, Mullally injured her foot {{and was unable to}} walk without crutches. The writers therefore had to put Mullally's character, Karen, in a cast and a motorized scooter, ostensibly because the character was recovering from an operation to correct a webbed toe.|$|E

Christgau, the poll's creator, ranked it first in his own list for The Barnes & Noble Review, writing in an accompanying essay that Vampire Weekend had made an art pop record that [...] "simulates predigital warmth by <b>tinkering</b> <b>with</b> a dizzying panoply of studio stratagems and divides the most emotional songs of the band’s career into distinct parts impossible to enumerate due to how often the arrangements change up gorgeous drum tracks, but I dare you to dance to them".

500|$|The {{decoding}} of the extraterrestrial message, {{with its}} architectural {{drawings of the}} machine, was created by Ken Ralston and Sony Pictures Imageworks. This is the sixth film collaboration between director Zemeckis and VFX supervisor Ralston.

On designing the Machine, Zemeckis explained that [...] "The Machine in Sagan's novel was somewhat vague, which is fine for a book. In a movie, though, if you're going to build a giant physical structure of alien design, you have to make it believable." [...] He continued that [...] "it had to be huge, so that the audience would feel like it was bigger than man should be <b>tinkering</b> <b>with.</b> It had to look absolutely real."

500|$|Bilson and DeMeo then {{submitted}} their seven-page film {{treatment to}} Disney, but the studio put their script through an endless series of revisions. Over five years, Disney fired and rehired Bilson and DeMeo three times. DeMeo explained that [...] "Disney {{felt that they}} needed {{a different approach to}} the script, which meant bringing in someone else. But those scripts were thrown out and we were always brought back on". They found the studio's constant <b>tinkering</b> <b>with</b> the screenplay to be a frustrating process as [...] "executives would like previously excised dialogue three months later. Scenes that had been thrown out two years ago were put back in. What was the point"? DeMeo said. One of Bilson and De Meo's significant revisions to the script over the years was to make Cliff and Jenny's romance more believable and avoid cliché aspects that would stereotype Jenny as a damsel in distress. The numerous project delays forced Dear to drop out as director. Joe Johnston, a fan of the comic book, immediately offered his services as director when he found out Disney owned the film rights. Johnston was quickly hired and pre-production started in early 1990. After Bilson and De Meo's third major rewrite, Disney finally greenlighted The Rocketeer.|$|E
500|$|The show {{features}} classic Western motifs such as train robberies and gunfighter showdowns, {{in combination}} with atypical elements. Much of the series {{is devoted to the}} science fiction plot surrounding the Orb, and it is this mix of the Western genre with fantasy that has helped Brisco maintain its cult status. In almost every episode, the characters discover or are confronted by fantastic technology. In the pilot episode, Brisco and Professor Wickwire modify a rocket to run on train tracks. In the episode [...] "Brisco For the Defense", Brisco uses a slide projector to show a trial jury fingerprint evidence. Professor Wickwire returns many times in the series to assist with technology, including <b>tinkering</b> <b>with</b> motorcycles and rescuing the heroes with a helium-filled zeppelin. Campbell told Starlog magazine, [...] "It's kind of Jules Verne meets The Wild Wild West." [...] The presence of futuristic technology in a Victorian era Western places the series in the steampunk genre; {{it is one of the}} few such shows to have aired on prime-time television. At least one-third of the show's episodes contain steampunk or Weird West elements. Though [...] "technology-out-of-time" [...] frequently intrudes into the plots of Brisco, the fantastic machines or methods rarely appear again. Some of these out-of-time technologies were archaic imaginations of those prevalent in the 20th century, and two film researchers, Cynthia Miller and A. Bowdoin Van Riper, suggest that followers of the show may be puzzled that such inventions, so useful in their own lives, are not exploited further.|$|E
