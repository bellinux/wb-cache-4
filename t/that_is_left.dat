5|$|All <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>left</b> of Missouri Row is a four-sided {{concrete}} fireplace {{surrounded by}} pieces of foundation, a few sets of stairs, metal plumbing, and a retaining wall. East of that, surrounding {{what is now}} the Monte Ne boat launch, are remnants of limestone structures. Some of these are foundations from the broad wooden staircase built in front of Hotel Monte Ne; some are structural components for the twin stone bridges that crossed the lagoon and some are simply low retaining walls. The amphitheater and the retaining wall built for the Pyramid are underwater. Occasionally, when water levels drop in summer, they can be seen.|$|E

5|$|Blackleg is a {{fungal disease}} of canola {{that results in}} major yield loss in {{affected}} crops. It overwinters on infected stubble (leftover crop residue) <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>left</b> on farm fields, and can continue to produce spores, infecting future crops, until the stubble is buried or broken down completely. The observation that C.olla grows and fruits on canola stubble has led to research on the potential of this fungus to degrade canola stubble, and {{reduce the incidence of}} stubble-borne diseases like blackleg and blackspot. In a study of its lignin-degrading abilities, C.olla was shown to colonize canola, wheat, and barley residue, but appeared to have a preference for the woody taproots of canola as compared to the cereal residue.|$|E
5|$|Matangi {{is often}} {{associated}} with pollution, especially left-over or partially eaten food (Ucchishta or Ucçhishṭa, उच्छिष्ट) considered impure in Hinduism. She is often offered such polluted left-over food and is in one legend described to be born from it. Matangi is herself described as the leftover or residue, symbolizing the Divine Self <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>left</b> over after all things perish. As the patron of left-over food offerings, she embodies inauspiciousness and the forbidden transgression of social norms.|$|E
5|$|A {{total of}} 28 games {{distributed}} on 11 different game cards were released for the Magnavox Odyssey. 13 games were {{included with the}} console—a set of 12 in America and {{a different set of}} 10 in other countries—with 6 others available for purchase either individually for US$5.49 or in a pack for US$24.99; the additional games primarily used the same game cards with different screen overlays and instructions. Another game, Percepts, was available for free to players that sent in a survey card.

5|$|Samus {{returns to}} the {{research}} center, where she finds a body of James Pierce and a mummified remains of Ridley. She also discovers the survivor, and defeats a Queen Metroid. Samus pursues the survivor, who reveals herself {{to be the real}} Madeline. Madeline explains that the woman Samus met earlier was MB, an android created to establish a relationship with the Metroids. Betrayed by scientists and Madeline, MB telepathically commanded the Space Pirate special forces to attack those on board. Samus and Madeline are confronted by MB; as a group of Federation troopers rushes into the room, MB summons the Bottle Ship's most dangerous creatures to attack everyone. Madeline stops MB, who is then destroyed by Federation troopers. The colonel compliments Samus's efforts but orders a trooper to escort Samus back to her ship; a trooper complies and reveals himself as Anthony, the only surviving member of the 07th Platoon. Samus, Madeline and Anthony leave for the Galactic Federation headquarters in Samus's gunship. Days after the incident, Samus {{returns to the}} Bottle Ship, now marked for destruction by the Galactic Federation, to retrieve something <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>left</b> there. After battling Phantoon, a monster Samus had also fought on Zebes, she arrives at the control center and recovers Adam's platoon helmet. The Bottle Ship's self-destruct sequence is remotely activated, which an armorless Samus escapes with Adam's helmet.|$|E

25|$|St. Lachtain's Church, Freshford {{was built}} in 1731, {{incorporating}} a portal from 1100 as its main entrance, all <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>left</b> of the original church is the beautiful Hiberno-Romanesque (Irish-Roman) architectural porch and doorway. The remainder of the present church was built for Protestant worship in 1731. In St. Lachtains time Freshford was a diocese. In 1225 a bishops palace was built at Aghore (Achadh Ur), now Uppercourt. It {{was used as a}} summer residence for over 300 years.|$|E
25|$|Lowell was at {{one time}} a sizable mining town located just to the {{southeast}} of Old Bisbee.

These days Lowell is considered by most of the local residents {{to be more of a}} place name than an operating community.|$|E
25|$|A {{huge part}} of the {{economic}} life of Glasgow was once located in Springburn, where the Saracen Foundry, engineering works of firms like Charles Tennant and locomotive workshops employed many Glaswegians. Indeed, Glasgow dominated this type of manufacturing, with 25% of all the world's locomotives being built in the area at one stage. It was home to {{the headquarters of the}} North British Locomotive Company. Today part of the St. Rollox railway works continues in use as a railway maintenance facility, all <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>left</b> of the industry in Springburn.|$|E

25|$|There are {{typically}} a First and a Second Mortgage. The Second Mortgage {{is put in}} place to protect any equity <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>left</b> that is not captured in the first mortgage. The homeowners pay down the first mortgage, and after a stated period of time (which varies from affiliate to affiliate) of living in the same home, the Second Mortgage is forgiven (however, it is not always forgiven). However, The Right of First Refusal stays in force until the mortgage is paid in full.|$|E
25|$|With a {{total area}} of , New Delhi forms {{a small part}} of the Delhi {{metropolitan}} area. Since the city is located on the Indo-Gangetic Plain, there is little difference in elevation across the city. New Delhi and surrounding areas were once a part of the Aravali Range; all <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>left</b> of those mountains is the Delhi Ridge, which is also called the Lungs of Delhi. While New Delhi lies on the floodplains of the Yamuna River, it is essentially a landlocked city. East of the river is the urban area of Shahdara. New Delhi falls under the seismic zone-IV, making it vulnerable to earthquakes.|$|E
25|$|The {{displaced}} dispatchable generation {{could be}} coal, natural gas, biofuels, nuclear, geothermal or conventional hydro. Rather than starting and stopping nuclear or geothermal it is effective {{to use them}} as constant base load power, when that power is not needed it can displace heating fuels or be converted to storage for later use. Biofuels and hydro can be saved for later when intermittents are not generating power. Alternatives to burning coal and natural gas with the production of greenhouse gases may eventually make them a stranded asset <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>left</b> in the ground. Highly integrated grids favor flexibility and performance over cost, resulting in more plant capacity and lower capacity factors.|$|E
