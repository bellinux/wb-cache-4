5|$|The {{election}} of the Liberal candidate in Yukon was contested by the losing Tory candidate. After a trial before the Yukon Territorial Court, that court voided the election, holding that enough ineligible people had been permitted to vote to affect the outcome, though the court noted {{that it was not}} <b>the</b> <b>fault</b> <b>of</b> the Liberal candidate that these irregularities had occurred. The Tory, Erik Nielsen, won the new election in December 1957.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{collision}} Prime Minister Menzies ordered a Royal Commission {{to investigate the}} event. The Commissioner concluded that {{the collision}} was primarily <b>the</b> <b>fault</b> <b>of</b> Voyagers bridge crew not maintaining an effective lookout, but also placed blame on Melbournes Captain John Robertson (who resigned shortly after) and two other officers for failing to alert Voyager or take effective measures to avoid collision. The handing of the Royal Commission was seen as poor, and after a combination of public pressure and claims that Stevens had a drinking problem, a second Royal Commission was announced: the only time two Commissions have been held for the same incident. The second Royal Commission found that Stevens was likely medically unfit for command, {{that some of the}} first Commission's conclusions were therefore incorrect, and the Melbourne officers were not at fault. The two commissions caused great anguish in the hierarchy of the RAN, which was not accustomed to such tight scrutiny, and led to the eventual dismantling of the Naval Board's isolation from the civilian world.|$|E

She initially refused to answer questions, and when she did, protested her innocence, first in French, then, raising her voice in anger, in English. Giving evidence by video link from prison, Manning apologised for his actions and {{said that it was}} not <b>the</b> <b>fault</b> <b>of</b> the various agencies that Climbié died. Broadcasters applied for access to this video, but Laming refused the application. Climbié's parents gave evidence and were present at most of the hearings, becoming distressed when hearing of Climbié's plight and seeing pictures of her injuries. They blamed Haringey council and its chief executive for Climbié's death.|$|E

30|$|<b>The</b> <b>fault</b> system <b>of</b> Liaodong Bay {{developed}} extensively {{under the}} control <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Tanlu <b>Fault.</b> <b>The</b> <b>fault</b> system can be grouped into strike-slip <b>faults</b> <b>of</b> grade I, trunk <b>faults</b> <b>of</b> grade II and branch <b>faults</b> (induced <b>faults)</b> <b>of</b> grade III respectively based on its developmental scale. <b>The</b> <b>faults</b> <b>of</b> grade I and II were deep, early and large while <b>the</b> <b>faults</b> <b>of</b> grade III were shallow, late and small. The formation, evolution and distribution features {{played a significant role}} in controlling the migration of oil and gas in both horizontal and vertical directions. The fluid transfer in <b>the</b> <b>fault</b> system occurred in <b>the</b> process <b>of</b> <b>faulting.</b> <b>The</b> strike-slip and trunk faults moved actively forming predominant pathways for oil and gas migration. <b>The</b> branch <b>faults,</b> with weak activity, generally controlled the development of traps and were beneficial for the accumulation and preservation of oil and gas. <b>The</b> <b>faults</b> <b>of</b> grade I and II formed the major migration pathways for oil and gas, but their fault activity rates appeared to vary along their strikes. The zones with a relatively low fault activity rate might be favorable for oil and gas accumulation. When the activities of strike-slip, trunk, and branch faults came to a halt, <b>the</b> <b>fault</b> seal behavior had a vitally important effect on the accumulation of oil and gas. The controlling role <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fault</b> over fluid distribution was further analyzed by calculating <b>the</b> <b>fault</b> activity quantitatively.|$|R
5|$|She was {{commissioned}} into the 1st Cruiser Squadron of the Home Fleet on 20 March 1909 {{and participated in}} fleet manoeuvres in April and June 1909, the Spithead Review on 12 June 1909, and the Fleet Review off Southend on 2 July. She was refitted between 17 August and 17 January 1910 {{in an attempt to}} cure the electrical problems with her turrets, but they were still unsatisfactory. Another attempt was made to bring her turrets to working order during a refit in the spring of 1911, but this too was unsuccessful and the decision was made the following year to convert her turrets to hydraulic power. This was delayed until after her deployment to join the Mediterranean Fleet at the end of 1912. On 17 March 1913, she collided with the submarine , but the collision was ruled <b>the</b> <b>fault</b> <b>of</b> the submarine. She returned to the UK in December 1913 in preparation for a major refit that would finally give her turrets hydraulic power and make her battle-worthy.|$|E
5|$|The 2009 season {{seemed to}} mark a rebound in Zito's {{pitching}} performance. Though starting the season 0–2 with an ERA of 10, Zito ended {{the season with}} an ERA of 4.03. His ERA would have been 3.74 {{had it not been}} for his first two starts. Though going only 10–13 in the season, Zito's record was much more <b>the</b> <b>fault</b> <b>of</b> his spotty run support (the second-lowest in the major leagues) than his performance on the mound. On June 21, Zito pitched a no-hitter through six innings against Texas before giving up a home run to Andruw Jones in the seventh inning. He won the game, his fourth win of the season. On July 7, Zito pitched what could be considered his best game of the season. He pitched 8⅓ innings against the Florida Marlins, allowing one run on four hits, striking out six, and walking one. He won the game, his fifth win of the season.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the more}} {{well-known}} stories about Sun Tzu, taken from Sima Qian, illustrates Sun Tzu's temperament as follows: Before hiring Sun Tzu, the King of Wu tested Sun Tzu's skills by commanding him to train a harem of 180 concubines into soldiers. Sun Tzu divided them into two companies, appointing the two concubines most favored by the king as the company commanders. When Sun Tzu first ordered the concubines to face right, they giggled. In response, Sun Tzu said that the general, in this case himself, was responsible for ensuring that soldiers understood the commands given to them. Then, he reiterated the command, and again the concubines giggled. Sun Tzu then ordered {{the execution of the}} king's two favored concubines, to the king's protests. He explained that if the general's soldiers understood their commands but did not obey, it was <b>the</b> <b>fault</b> <b>of</b> the officers. Sun Tzu also said that, once a general was appointed, it was his duty to carry out his mission, even if the king protested. After both concubines were killed, new officers were chosen to replace them. Afterwards, both companies, now well aware of the costs of further frivolity, performed their maneuvers flawlessly.|$|E

40|$|When using Built-In Self Test (BIST) {{for testing}} VLSI circuits, {{a major concern}} is the {{generation}} of proper test patterns that detect <b>the</b> <b>faults</b> <b>of</b> interest. Usually a linear feedback shift register (LFSR) is used to generate test patterns. We first analyze the probability that an arbitrary pseudo-random test sequence of short length detects all <b>faults.</b> <b>The</b> term short is relative to the probability <b>of</b> detecting <b>the</b> <b>fault</b> with <b>the</b> fewest test patterns. We then show how to guide the search for an initial state (seed) for a LFSR with a given primitive feedback polynomial so that all <b>the</b> <b>faults</b> <b>of</b> interest are detected by a minimum length test sequence. Our algorithm is based on finding the location of test patterns in the sequence generated by this LFSR. This is accomplished using the theory of discrete logarithms. We then select the shortest subsequence that includes test patterns for all <b>the</b> <b>faults</b> <b>of</b> interest, hence resulting in 100 % fault coverage...|$|R

30|$|<b>The</b> <b>fault</b> plane <b>of</b> <b>the</b> largest {{aftershock}} derived in {{the present}} study is located at the northern end of the aftershock area within 24 hours after the main shock. If <b>the</b> <b>fault</b> plane <b>of</b> <b>the</b> largest aftershock is a part <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>fault</b> plane <b>of</b> <b>the</b> main shock, the Pacific plate must have moved northwestward during the main shock and southeastward during the largest aftershock.
