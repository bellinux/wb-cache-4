5|$|Radau {{returns to}} food, {{describing}} sago and the breadfruit tree. The breadfruit <b>tastes</b> <b>like</b> Yorkshire pudding or mashed potato; with meat {{it is the}} best of vegetables; with sugar, milk, butter or molasses, it is a delicious pudding with a special flavour; Radau hopes that perhaps it will one day be found in European markets. As for the sago palm, one tree yields 1,800 cakes, enough to feed a man for a year.|$|E

If a human looks at one hungrily, it will happily immolate itself — either by jumping into a frying pan, after which they <b>taste</b> <b>like</b> chicken, or into a broiling pan, after which they <b>taste</b> <b>like</b> steak. When roasted they <b>taste</b> <b>like</b> pork, and when baked they <b>taste</b> <b>like</b> catfish. (Raw, they <b>taste</b> <b>like</b> oysters on the half-shell.) ...|$|R
25|$|The {{following}} karmas provide different {{abilities of}} tastes to the bodies: tikta rasa nama-karma gives a bitter <b>taste</b> (<b>like</b> {{that of the}} nimba fruit), kasaya rasa nama-karma gives an astringent <b>taste</b> (<b>like</b> that of bibhitaka), amla rasa nama-karma gives a sour <b>taste</b> (<b>like</b> that of tamarind) and madhura rasa nama-karma gives a sweet <b>taste</b> (<b>like</b> that of sugar). The salt taste is produced {{by a combination of}} the sweet taste with another. Bitter and biting tastes are considered unpleasant, the others pleasant.|$|R

25|$|There is an {{area where}} Nanban is used {{exclusively}} to refer to a certain style, and that is cooking and the names of dishes. Nanban dishes are not American or European, but an odd variety not using soy sauce or miso but rather curry powder and vinegar as their flavoring, a characteristic derived from Indo-Portuguese Goan cuisine. Some of these dishes resemble Southeast Asian cuisines but are so heavily changed to fit Japanese <b>tastes</b> <b>like</b> ramen that they should be considered separate.|$|E
25|$|In Mandatory Palestine, {{demand for}} kosher canned meats {{increased}} as Spam became more popular during World War II. Canned meat was briefly mentioned during wartime from 1939–43, but the true boom in kosher canned meat came in 1945. This is when kosher canned meat became the key item in Europe's Jewish war victim relief packages. Then in 1946, the Chicago Kosher Sausage Manufacturing Company registered a patent for a kosher canned meat product called Breef. Made of beef, Breef {{has a similar}} texture to Spam but <b>tastes</b> <b>like</b> corned beef.|$|E

25|$|The {{chocolate}} {{industry is}} a steadily growing, $50billion-a-year worldwide business centered on the sale and consumption of chocolate. It is prevalent {{throughout most of the}} world. Europe accounts for 45% of the world's chocolate revenue and the US$20billion. Big Chocolate is the grouping of major international chocolate companies in Europe and the U.S. The U.S. companies, such as Mars and Hershey's alone, generate $13billion a year in chocolate sales and account for two-thirds of U.S. production. Despite the expanding reach of the chocolate industry internationally, cocoa farmers and labourers in the Ivory Coast are unaware of the uses of the beans. The high cost of chocolate in the Ivory Coast also means that it is inaccessible to the majority of the population, who are unaware of what it <b>tastes</b> <b>like.</b>|$|E
500|$|Esch and Lefkow {{have stated}} that they started with just {{mayonnaise}} and bacon and worked with chefs {{to determine how to}} have mayonnaise that <b>tastes</b> <b>like</b> bacon without having bacon as an ingredient. Lefkow stated that developing and refining the taste of Baconnaise resulted in him having [...] "nothing but bacon and mayonnaise for breakfast for the next six months." [...] Lefkow refined the taste of Baconnaise by comparing real bacon to the developing product.|$|E
500|$|In 2003 an {{ice cream}} parlour, [...] "Udder Delight", opened in Rehoboth Beach, Delaware, specialising in [...] "outlandish" [...] ice cream flavours. Among other flavours, such as their award-winning {{peanut butter and jelly}} ice cream, they have created a bacon ice cream which <b>tastes</b> <b>like</b> butter pecan. The owner, Chip Hearn, had {{included}} the flavour along with 17 others in an invitation-only focus group, where the tasters were allowed to suggest changes and give opinions on the flavour.|$|E

Pieces of pumice have floated 1200 miles (1900 km) from the Andes volcanoes. Bates observes a large landslip on which masses of giant forest trees rock to and fro. He notes there are discomforts but [...] "scarcely any danger from wild animals". He becomes desperate for intellectual society, running out of reading matter, even the advertisements in the Athenaeum journal. He describes the food and fruits at Ega, and the curious seasons, with two wet and two dry seasons each year, the river thus rising and falling twice. The people regularly eat turtles.|$|E
2500|$|Most of the {{controversy}} surrounding Splenda, a sucralose sweetener, is focused not on safety but on its marketing. It has been marketed with the slogan, [...] "Splenda is made from sugar, so it <b>tastes</b> <b>like</b> sugar." [...] Sucralose is prepared from either of two sugars, sucrose or raffinose. With either base sugar, processing replaces three oxygen-hydrogen groups in the sugar molecule with three chlorine atoms.|$|E

2500|$|Modern artists {{began to}} {{reestablish}} Posada's styles {{as a national}} artistic objective to push the limits of upper-class <b>tastes,</b> <b>like</b> that of Diego Rivera's mural painting Dream of a Sunday Afternoon in the Alameda Central with the image La Catrina. The image of the skeleton and the Day of the Dead ritual {{that used to be}} held underground became commercialized and domesticated. The skeletal images became that of folklore, encapsulating Posada's message of [...] "la muerte igualidad" [...] (equality in death) in time.|$|E

2500|$|The [...] "Truth About Splenda" [...] website {{was created}} in 2005 by The Sugar Association, an {{organization}} representing sugar beet and sugar cane farmers in the United States, to provide its view of sucralose. In December 2004, five separate false-advertising claims were filed by the Sugar Association against Splenda manufacturers Merisant and McNeil Nutritionals for claims made about Splenda related to the slogan, [...] "Made from sugar, so it <b>tastes</b> <b>like</b> sugar". French courts ordered the slogan to no longer be used in France, while in the U.S. the case came to an undisclosed settlement during the trial.|$|E

God forbade eating meat without ritual slaughter (in [...] ) but permitted it for fish. Similarly, Rabbi Abba and Rabbi Jonathan in the name of Rabbi Levi taught that God permitted more things than God forbade. For example, God counterbalanced the prohibition of pork (in [...] and [...] ) by permitting mullet (which some say <b>tastes</b> <b>like</b> pork).|$|E
2500|$|From the cooker, the mash {{heads to}} the {{fermenter}} where it is cooled to 60–70°F and yeast is added again. The yeast is fed by the sugars in the mash, producing heat, carbon dioxide and alcohol. Called [...] "distiller's beer" [...] or [...] "wash", the resulting liquid (after filtering to remove solids) looks, smells and <b>tastes</b> <b>like</b> (and essentially is) a form of beer. The wash is pumped into a column still where it is heated to over 200°F, causing the alcohol to turn to a vapor. As the vapor cools and falls it turns to a liquid called [...] "low wine", which measures 125 proof or 62.5% alcohol. A second distillation in a pot still heats and condenses the liquid into [...] "high wine", which reaches 135 proof (67.5% alcohol).|$|E

5000|$|Another suggestion, made by Joe Staton of the Museum of Comparative Zoology, is that meat flavors {{are fixed}} {{based on the}} [...] "evolutionary origin" [...] of the animal. Specifically, he noted that {{tetrapods}} largely <b>taste</b> <b>like</b> chicken, whereas other animals usually do not. Accordingly, birds (the most numerous form of meat by type) would (in most cases) naturally <b>taste</b> more <b>like</b> chicken than mammals. Furthermore, because dinosaurs are ancestral to birds, their meat would hypothetically have also <b>tasted</b> <b>like</b> chicken. However, the meat of other fowl often <b>tastes</b> nothing <b>like</b> chicken; for example, pheasant meat {{is described as a}} [...] "unique" [...] flavor and ostrich meat is considered very similar to beef.|$|R
