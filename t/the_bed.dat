5|$|Above is the Great Chamber, an {{impressive}} {{room with a}} barrel ceiling with geometrical plaster decoration featuring John Lyte's arms and those of his wife, Edith Horsey. This ceiling is a rare survival. The wall above <b>the</b> <b>bed</b> displays the royal coat of arms and Tudor roses, signifying Lyte's loyalty to King Henry VIII (whose government Lyte represented in Somerset). The panelling is 17th century, as are the great four poster bed and the tapestries on the walls.

50|$|When {{positioned}} on sloped terrain, <b>the</b> <b>beds</b> {{need to be}} put {{at an angle to}} the hillside (rather than having them parallel to it).

50|$|<b>The</b> Ndolanya <b>Beds,</b> {{which are}} located above <b>the</b> Laetolil <b>Beds</b> and {{underlie}} <b>the</b> Ogol lavas, are clearly divisible into {{upper and lower}} units separated by a widespread deposit of calcrete up to one meter thick.

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} was the study of the {{relationship}} between the air ammonia concentration and <b>the</b> <b>bedding</b> hygiene in dairy cow barns with different housing systems. The study was conducted in 16 dairy farms (8 with tied stalls and 8 with loose housing) inTransylvania, in the cold season. In each farm, the airborne ammonia concentration was measured in the morning and the hygiene of <b>the</b> <b>bedding</b> was assessed. Air temperature, relative humidity and air flow velocity in the barns were determined simultaneously. The data were analyzed using theSPSSstatistical software. The airborne ammonia concentration and <b>the</b> <b>bedding</b> hygiene score had significantly (P > 0. 05) higher values in the barns with tie stalls. The ammonia concentration correlated positively with <b>the</b> <b>bedding</b> hygiene score in all the investigated farms. Keeping <b>the</b> <b>bedding</b> clean and dry in the dairy cows’ barns is an important factor in reducing the airborne ammonia concentration...|$|R
40|$|In {{northwest}} Leicestershire and South Derbyshire {{there are}} eight inliers of Carboniferous Limestone. The five Eastern Inliers consist mainly of thick to massive bedded dolomite of C.;S.;to age and has been namedthe Cloud Hill Dolomite Formation. The Formation has been divided into three ffiemberss (l) <b>the</b> I'lassive <b>Bedded</b> Dolomite Member; (2) the Red Bed Member.;(5) the Biohem Member. The three Western Inliers and <b>the</b> topmost <b>beds</b> in <b>the</b> southernmost of the Eastern Inliers consist of thin to thick bedded limestone and dolomitic limestone with interbedded shale and are D 2 agej <b>the</b> <b>beds</b> have been named the Ticknall Limestone Formation and divided into two members: (l) the Limestone and Shale Member; (2) <b>the</b> Thick <b>Bedded</b> Limestone and Dolomite Member. <b>The</b> <b>beds</b> in <b>the</b> Eastern Inliers have been strongly dolomitized and are mostly medium to coarsely crystalline dolomite with fossil remains completely destroyed in most cases. <b>The</b> <b>beds</b> in <b>the</b> Western Inliers 5 apart from patchy dolomitization of <b>the</b> topmost <b>beds,</b> are largely biomicrite and biomicrudite with interbedded quartz-rich shale. Fossil remains are abundant and well preserved. Dolomitization of <b>the</b> <b>beds</b> in. <b>the</b> Eastern Inliers {{is thought to have}} resulted from the invasion of magnesian brines originating from buried sub- Vise'an evaporites; the patchy dolomitization in the Western Inliers probably resulted from Mg∼rich groundwater penetrating <b>the</b> <b>beds</b> from <b>the</b> overlying Trias sic I-Iarl. <b>The</b> Massive <b>Bedded</b> Dolomite Member and the Red Bed Member appear to have been deposited mainly in intertidal conditions, while the Bioherm Member and Ticknall Formation are likely to have been deposited in subtidal conditions. A review of Kent's criteria for distinguishing between gulf and block facies suggests the need for a change in the southwest Widmerpool Gulf boundary. <b>The</b> <b>beds</b> in <b>the</b> eight inliers are highly disturbed structurally, with near vertical strata in the four northernmost Eastern Inliers intersected by normal, reverse, and strike-slip faults, the strike of <b>the</b> <b>beds</b> between <b>the</b> Eastern Inliers offset by sinistral faults, a small anticline through the Western Inliers, and both sets of inliers bounded by post-Carboniferous faulting. The uplift of <b>the</b> <b>beds</b> in <b>the</b> Eastern Inliers is thought {{to be the result of}} late Carboniferous to early post-Carboniferous diapirism involving concealed pre-Visean evaporites...|$|R

5|$|In 1917, Texas filed a {{trespass}} to try title suit {{to reclaim}} the lake bed for the state. In Welder v.

However, under the Texas Water Rights Adjudication Act of 1967, Green Lake was classified as a public body of water.
