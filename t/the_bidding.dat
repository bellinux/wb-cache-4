The NPB team then had four days to either accept or reject the non-negotiable bid amount.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the relationship between}} <b>the</b> price <b>bid</b> for a takeover target, the probability of <b>the</b> <b>bid</b> succeeding and <b>the</b> target 2 ̆ 7 s price {{over the course of}} <b>the</b> <b>bid.</b> We test and reject Samuelson and Rosenthal 2 ̆ 7 s (1986) expected value hypothesis. We find that over <b>the</b> <b>bid,</b> <b>the</b> price of the target of a successful bid typically rises towards <b>the</b> <b>bid</b> price, but is not observed to converge with <b>the</b> <b>bid</b> price. This lack of observed convergenece appears to be due to an early cessation of trading in many of <b>the</b> <b>bids</b> that succeed. In <b>the</b> case of <b>bids</b> that fail, <b>the</b> target 2 ̆ 7 s share price is typically observed to rise above <b>the</b> <b>bid</b> price early in <b>the</b> <b>bid.</b> We consider several explanations for this, and suggest that the expectation of a subsequent <b>bid</b> is <b>the</b> most plausible explanation. This is supported by our empirical evidence. We also find that in the cases where <b>the</b> <b>bids</b> fail, early cessation of trading did not occur in the majority of cases...|$|R

5|$|The {{original}} idea for constructing {{a replacement for}} Mission Avenue dates from 1950. By 1961, there were plans to make SR76 a freeway from Oceanside to Fallbrook Road, and an expressway from there to US395. The following year, the new Highway 76 Association formed a committee to promote the upgrade of the road into Pauma Valley. In 1963, more specific plans were proposed by the Highway Development Association initiative, including making the portions from Foussat Road and the Mission San Luis Rey de Francia and from Vista Way to Mission Road an expressway, and making {{the part of the}} highway in Oceanside wider. In 1964, the state allocated funds for the widening of SR76 to four lanes in Oceanside, and in October1965, the first portion of the widening from Carey Road to Frontier Drive entered <b>the</b> <b>bidding</b> phase. The next part of the widening entered <b>the</b> <b>bidding</b> phase in December 1968, and extended from Frontier Drive to near the Mission.|$|E
5|$|ATV Music {{acquired}} {{the rights to}} the Lennon–McCartney song catalogue, Northern Songs, in 1969. The catalog featured almost every song written by Lennon–McCartney. Northern Songs was co-owned by Lennon, McCartney, Brian Epstein and Dick James, who owned a controlling interest. In 1969, James offered to sell his shares to ATV. Lennon and McCartney then attempted to gain a controlling interest in the company. Their bid to gain control, part of a long and acrimonious fight, failed. The financial clout of Grade, their adversary in <b>the</b> <b>bidding</b> war, ensured that the songs written by the two Beatles passed into the control of ATV.|$|E
5|$|After winning <b>the</b> <b>bidding,</b> TETCO {{raised the}} money to pay the {{government}} through a combination of bonds and share issues. A further government enquiry was required before the sale was allowed to go through, which was complicated by the reluctance of the state of Pennsylvania to allow the pipelines to be used to pump gas east through its territory. The government of Pennsylvania was influenced by the coal industry, who feared they would lose sales, but it eventually relented and the sale of the pipelines to TETCO was finally completed on November 1. The value of the company soared, and the original investors saw the value of their holdings increase 63-fold.|$|E

5|$|Belushi {{had become}} a star in 1978 {{as a result of}} both the Blues Brothers' musical success and his role in National Lampoon's Animal House.

Of the competition venues that the bid proposed for use during the Games, six required new construction, with the remainder already built in Vancouver and Whistler. The Vancouver Organizing Committee for the Olympic Games (VANOC), which is responsible for the construction and maintenance of facilities for the Games, pledged that all new construction of permanent facilities, whether on public or private land, would be funded by the government.|$|E
5000|$|Once {{a player}} or team reaches 100 points they must win <b>the</b> <b>bid</b> to receive points. The other players {{will go up}} or down but they will stay at the same score. They are locked in at that score unless they win <b>the</b> <b>bid.</b> Once they win <b>the</b> <b>bid</b> they will either win the game or go down {{depending}} on if they make <b>the</b> <b>bid</b> or not. This encourages the remaining players to bid against a player who is approaching 120, so that he will rarely {{be able to win}} <b>the</b> <b>bid</b> cheaply.|$|R

5|$|Nine cities {{submitting}} bids to {{host the}} 2012 Summer Olympics and 2012 Summer Paralympics were recognised by the International Olympic Committee (IOC).

Paris was seen by some as the front-runner for much of the campaign, but skillful lobbying by London's supporters and an inspirational final presentation by Sebastian Coe led to the success of its bid.|$|E
