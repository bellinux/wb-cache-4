Locke looks on from the shadows with his arms crossed. Hurley reveals to Jack {{that one of the}} survivors is not listed on the flight manifest, which means that someone was already on the island when the plane crashed. Claire's contractions begin to stop. Claire and Charlie are then met by Ethan, who looks at them ominously.|$|E
5|$|Just before {{graduating from}} Millikin University in 1999, {{someone from the}} college {{recommended}} that West attend the GMA Music in the Rockies event for aspiring musicians. Although West was not interested at first, he attended after learning <b>that</b> <b>other</b> <b>people</b> signed him up and paid his entrance fee. He met a representative from Word Publishing at the event who took interest in him and kept in contact until he graduated. West landed in the finals of a songwriting competition and was offered a songwriting deal in July 1999, five weeks after graduating. After penning songs for well-known musicians like Billy Ray Cyrus and Rachael Lampa, he began touring the United States as an independent artist in 2000 and 2001.|$|E
5|$|Later, Tom is {{dropped off}} in a field somewhere. There, he discovers <b>that</b> <b>other</b> <b>people</b> were held captive on the {{spaceship}} as well. A Mech kills everyone, except for Tom, presumably to tell others about what he witnessed. He begins a pilgrimage back to Boston. On his way, he finds a girl, Teresa (Laine MacNeil) being mugged. Tom helps her. Teresa’s mother was murdered and Tom and Teresa bury her. They leave together on Teresa’s motorcycle. Later, they hear Mech fire and people. Teresa decides to leave {{and go to the}} mountains. Tom stays to find other survivors. There, he finds a Skitter. While attempting to kill it, Tom is shot by his son, Ben.|$|E

25|$|Officer 'E' {{decided to}} {{approach}} the Missing Persons Bureau directly. In September 2003, the Bureau approached the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (DFAT) for help in searching for Solon. DFAT informed the Bureau that Solon had traveled to the Philippines. Eventually Solon's former husband, Robert Young, was informed where Solon was. Throughout early 2004, Young persisted in questioning the Bureau, until it eventually decided to contact DIMIA. The Bureau was put through to officer 'A' in Canberra (who had already been told twice of Solon's unlawful deportation). Officer 'A' then contacted the Brisbane office, and learned <b>that</b> <b>other</b> <b>people</b> there knew about the error made. However again no action was taken, and the Minister for Immigration at the time, Philip Ruddock, was not informed.|$|E

25|$|When {{the police}} interrogated Serafín separately, {{he confessed to}} aiding in Kilroy's murder and <b>that</b> <b>other</b> <b>people</b> were killed {{over the course of}} several months at Santa Elena. Serafín then {{identified}} Constanzo and Aldrete as the heads of the group. He said that Constanzo had ordered the slayings as part of a sacrificial ritual. Constanzo believed that by sacrificing his victims, those doing the sacrifice were ensured strength, abundance, and immunity from law enforcement and injury. Specifically, he said that Kilroy was chosen at random because Constanzo had ordered his men to find a white, Anglo male (Spanish: gringo) to sacrifice. He said that Kilroy was killed by Constanzo with a machete blow and that his body was buried at the ranch. Serafín agreed to take the police to the exact spot where Kilroy was buried, which was marked by a wire piece coming out of the dirt. He stated that the wire was attached to Kilroy's spinal cord so they would be able pull out the bones and wear them as necklaces after the body decomposed.|$|E
25|$|Attachment theory also postulates {{that all}} humans possess an innate {{attachment}} behavioural system that motivates them to seek proximity to a caregiver (also called an attachment figure) {{during times of}} threat or need. Caregiving behaviour is therefore complimentary to attachment behaviour. Furthermore, attachment theory argues that {{the effectiveness of the}} caregiving behaviour enacted determines the quality of the attachment bond between the caregiver and care-recipient, as well as shapes the care-recipient’s general expectations of social support. In this model, a history of receiving effective care from intimate others (whether parents in childhood or romantic partners in adulthood) promotes a sense of attachment security – an interpersonal orientation characterized by the expectation <b>that</b> <b>other</b> <b>people</b> may be relied on for support, and subsequent comfort with intimacy and emotional closeness. In contrast, a history of interactions with cold or rejecting caregivers promotes attachment avoidance – an interpersonal orientation marked by discomfort with intimacy, a reluctance to rely on others for support, and the tendency to suppress emotional distress. Care that is inconsistent or intrusive is believed to foster attachment anxiety, which is characterized by excessive preoccupation with intimate relationships and inability to effectively regulate one’s own emotional distress.|$|E
25|$|Over time, {{alternative}} {{theories of}} Child Development {{have been put}} forward, and empirical findings {{have done a lot}} to undermine Piaget's theories. For example, Esther Thelen and colleagues found that babies would not make the A-not-B error if they had small weights added to their arms during {{the first phase of the}} experiment that were then removed before the second phase of the experiment. This minor change should not impact babies' understanding of object permanence, so the difference that this makes to babies' performance on the A-not-B task cannot be explained by Piagetian theory. Thelen and colleagues also found that various other factors also influenced performance on the A-not-B task (including strength of memory trace, salience of targets, waiting time and stance), and proposed that this could be better explained using a dynamic systems theory approach than using Piagetian theory. Alison Gopnik and Betty Repacholi found that babies as young as 18 months old can understand <b>that</b> <b>other</b> <b>people</b> have desires, and that these desires could be very different from their own desires. This strongly contradicts Piaget's view that children are very egocentric at this age. In reaction to these challenges, it has been argued that their criticisms depend on a fundamental misreading of Piaget's theory (Lourenço & Machado, 1996).|$|E
50|$|One {{recollection}} of his comments, amongst <b>other</b> things, was <b>that</b> {{he stated that}} the Jewish people had suffered, but <b>that</b> <b>other</b> <b>peoples</b> had also endured great tragedies. ("The Jews weren't the only people to have suffered.") However, as the affair went along, due notably to Michaud's open defence of Quebecker nationalism, he was increasingly portrayed by some as an anti-semite and denier of the Shoah, which he has always categorically said he was not.|$|R

25|$|Lemieux's {{career was}} plagued by health {{problems}} that limited him to 915 of a possible 1,428 regular season games, between {{the opening of the}} 1984-85 campaign and the final game of 2005–2006. Lemieux's NHL debut was on October 11, 1984, and his final game took place on December 16, 2005. His numerous ailments included spinal disc herniation, Hodgkin's lymphoma, chronic tendinitis of a hip-flexor muscle, and chronic back pain so severe <b>that</b> <b>other</b> <b>people</b> had to tie his skates. He retired on two separate occasions due to these health issues, first in 1997 after battling lymphoma before returning in 2000, and then a second and final time in 2006 after being diagnosed with an atrial fibrillation. Lemieux also missed the entire 1994–95 season due to Hodgkin's lymphoma. Despite his lengthy absences from the game, his play remained at a high level upon his return to the ice; he won the Hart Trophy and scoring title in 1995–96 after sitting out the entire previous season, and he was a finalist for the Hart when he made his comeback in 2000. In 1999, he bought the then-bankrupt Penguins and their top minor-league affiliate, the American Hockey League's (AHL) Wilkes-Barre/Scranton Penguins, and is currently the team's principal owner and chairman.|$|E
