5|$|Beetles have {{a variety}} of ways to communicate, {{including}} the use of pheromones. The mountain pine beetle emits a pheromone to attract other beetles <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>tree.</b> The mass of beetles are able to overcome the chemical defenses of the tree. After the tree's defenses have been exhausted, the beetles emit an anti-aggregation pheromone. The species can stridulate to communicate.|$|E

5|$|As Sayid and John Locke (Terry O'Quinn) {{discuss the}} attack on Sayid, Locke {{suggests}} that Sawyer is the culprit, since he is doing well for himself on the island, hoarding other people's possessions, and also seems to dislike Sayid. Meanwhile, Shannon begins to have trouble breathing due to her lack of medication and panic resulting from this problem. Jack tries beating answers out of Sawyer by punching him, but stops when he sees others' disapproval. Then with Jack's approval, Sayid ties Sawyer <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>tree</b> and tortures him for answers, revealing that he has tortured people before.|$|E
5|$|Boone {{runs through}} the jungle, and locates Shannon tied <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>tree.</b> Boone frees her and they run away from the {{pursuing}} monster. The monster takes Shannon, and a distraught Boone later finds her mutilated body by a creek, watching her die. That night Boone returns to the camp and tries to kill Locke, screaming that he had killed his sister, but Locke reveals that Shannon is alive. The paste caused Boone to have a vision that, according to Locke, is crucial to his experience on the island. Boone says seeing Shannon dead made him feel relieved. Locke says to come with him, and the two disappear into the jungle.|$|E

5|$|To {{the north}} of the Bath Road is Prospect Park, a large urban park {{surrounding}} the Mansion House. Development to the south of Southcote is restricted by the Holy Brook and the Great Western Main Line, and although the land is used for recreation, proposals are occasionally put forward to build housing on the floodplains. The land south of the railway line is subject <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>Tree</b> Preservation Order (TPO). This land is defined by Reading Borough Council as Southcote Meadows, and stretches from the Burghfield Road (near to the western boundary of Southcote) to Milkmaid's Bridge at the foot of Southcote Lock. Other parts of Southcote are subject to similar restrictions, including areas adjacent to (but north of) the railway embankment, trees lining the Kennet and Avon Canal west of Southcote Lock, and various individual sites.|$|E
5|$|West {{attacks and}} kills a {{fisherman}} in a wood, then encounters and frightens {{a little girl}} (Julie Drazen) there, but she escapes unharmed. Nelson tracks West by following his radiation trail with a geiger counter, but only finds his detached ear stuck <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>tree</b> branch. Perry arrives by plane, and is picked up by Nelson; shortly thereafter, they visit the crime scene where the fisherman's body was found. Sheriff Neil Blake (Michael Alldredge) suspects that Nelson knows something, but Nelson tells the sheriff nothing because Perry had earlier informed him that any information about West was classified. Later that night, Nelson returns home to his pregnant wife Judy (Ann Sweeny), who tells him that her elderly mother Helen (Dorothy Love) and Helen's boyfriend Harold (Edwin Max) are coming over for dinner. On their way, however, Helen and Harold are attacked by West in their car, and he kills them both.|$|E
5|$|By {{the age of}} eight, Alex {{had begun}} playing both {{basketball}} and football. He would shoot hoops with a soccer ball and a milk crate nailed <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>tree.</b> The sport was becoming increasingly popular in Nigeria due {{to the success of}} National Basketball Association (NBA) center Hakeem Olajuwon and Owumi often followed the NBA. When he was 12, his family moved to England, where they lived for three years. They then settled in Boston after his father joined the Harvard School of Public Health. In sixth grade, he enrolled at the local Tobin K-8 School. He attended Jeremiah E. Burke High School in Dorchester, Boston, where he played basketball and football. Owumi later estimated that he lost, at most, nine high school basketball games. At Burke in 2003, he won The Boston Globe Scholar Athlete Award, given to the top male and female student-athletes in Boston. Owumi was also a part of the Amateur Athletic Union (AAU) basketball team, Boston Amateur Athletic Club.|$|E

5|$|In the soil, {{the roots}} {{encounter}} the hyphae of fungi. Many {{of these are}} known as mycorrhiza and form a mutualistic relationship with the tree roots. Some are specific to a single tree species, which will not flourish {{in the absence of}} its mycorrhizal associate. Others are generalists and associate with many species. The tree acquires minerals such as phosphorus from the fungus while it obtains the carbohydrate products of photosynthesis from the tree. The hyphae of the fungus can link different trees and a network is formed, transferring nutrients from one place to another. The fungus promotes growth of the roots and helps protect the trees against predators and pathogens. It can also limit damage done <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>tree</b> by pollution as the fungus accumulate heavy metals within its tissues. Fossil evidence shows that roots have been associated with mycorrhizal fungi since the early Paleozoic, four hundred million years ago, when the first vascular plants colonised dry land.|$|E
5|$|Quests are {{directly}} linked to Lightning's growth: as she completes quests, her stats are boosted, with the main story quests yielding the biggest boosts. Many side quests can only be obtained at certain times, since the real-time build of the world means NPCs are in constant movement, and only appear in certain places at a given time. Lightning can also accept quests from the Canvas of Prayers, a post board found in all the main locations. Upon completing NPC quests, Lightning is rewarded with a portion of Eradia, spiritual energy retrieved when a person's burden is lifted. Every day at 6 AM game-time, Lightning is drawn back into the Ark, a location where the in-game clock does not progress. Once there, Lightning gives her gathered Eradia <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>tree</b> called Yggdrasil: if she has gathered enough, the in-game clock is extended by a day. She can also restock on supplies and collect new equipment. Another feature in the game was Outerworld Services, a feature where players could take photos and share them, along with their personal stats and battle scores, on Facebook and Twitter. The Facebook features were disabled in April 2015. All Outerworld services were terminated in April the following year.|$|E

The 19th Infantry also was part of the Eighth United States Army advance into North Korea. On the night of 5 November 1950, Red Cloud was manning a forward {{observation}} post when he spotted an imminent surprise attack by Chinese forces. Red Cloud single-handedly held off the Chinese forces despite being shot eight times, at one point ordering his men to tie him <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>tree</b> because he was too weak to stand by himself. His company found him the next morning, surrounded by dead Chinese troops. He was credited with alerting his company to the ambush and saving them from being overrun. For these actions, he was posthumously awarded the Medal of Honor.|$|E

5|$|While some {{cockatoos}} are generalists {{taking a}} wide range of foods, others are specialists. The glossy black cockatoo specialises in the cones of trees of the genus Allocasuarina, preferring a single species, A. verticillata. It holds the cones in its foot and shreds them with its powerful bill before removing the seeds with its tongue. Some species take large numbers of insects, particularly when breeding; in fact the bulk of the yellow-tailed black cockatoo's diet is made up of insects. The large bill is used in order to extract grubs and larvae from rotting wood. The amount of time cockatoos have to spend foraging varies with the season. During times of plenty they may need to feed for only a few hours in the day, in the morning and evening, then {{spend the rest of the}} day roosting or preening in trees, but during the winter most of the day may be spent foraging. The birds have increased nutritional requirements during the breeding season, so they spend more time foraging for food during this time. Cockatoos have large crops, which allow them to store and digest food for some time after retiring <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>tree.</b> During hard times, the cockatoos also display versatility in their diet, travelling widely in order to find food, feeding on more green plant material and in some species using their large bills to dig up corms.|$|E
5|$|After {{four minutes}} of deliberation, the jury's foreman {{announced}} a guilty verdict and {{a sentence of}} death. The trial lasted about one hour. Court officers approached Washington to escort him away, but were pushed aside by a surge of spectators, who seized Washington and dragged him outside. Washington initially fought back, biting one man, but was soon beaten. A chain was placed {{around his neck and}} he was dragged toward city hall by a growing mob; on the way downtown, he was stripped, stabbed, and repeatedly beaten with blunt objects. By the time he arrived at city hall, a group had prepared wood for a bonfire next <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>tree</b> in front of the building. Washington, semiconscious and covered in blood, was doused with oil, hung from the tree by a chain, and then lowered to the ground. Members of the crowd cut off his fingers, toes, and genitals. The fire was lit and Washington was repeatedly raised and lowered into the flames until he burned to death. German scholar Manfred Berg posits that the executioners attempted to keep him alive to increase his suffering. Washington attempted to climb the chain, but was unable to, owing to his lack of fingers. The fire was extinguished after two hours, allowing bystanders to collect souvenirs from the site of the lynching, including Washington's bones and links of the chain. One attendee kept part of Washington's genitalia; a group of children snapped the teeth out of Washington's head to sell as souvenirs. By the time that the fire was extinguished, parts of Washington's arms and legs had been burned off and his torso and head were charred. His body was removed from the tree and dragged behind a horse throughout the town. Washington's remains were transported to Robinson, where they were publicly displayed until a constable obtained the body late in the day and buried it.|$|E
5|$|Diver Rodney Joyce from Scarborough, Ontario, aged 18, {{drowned in}} a slow {{whirlpool}} effect in the pond below the waterfall on Victoria Day weekend in 1988. Joyce had been swimming for ten minutes, when he went closer to the falls to retrieve a frisbee. His brother Gregory, aged 20, rushed to help him, but was pulled under several times. Resuscitation efforts by security staff failed. In an inquest, Wonderland's director of engineering denied {{the existence of an}} undertow. A nearby life ring had been tied <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>tree</b> using three knots and was only equipped with 6 metres (20feet) of rope, not enough to reach the middle of the pool. One high diver, who had worked at the park for seven years, claims to have told his supervisor of the undertow during the previous season. That diver was concerned about landing someone, as he claimed unauthorized swimmers were a frequent occurrence at that time. The area was listed as barricaded in an early report, but later reports contradicted that. The witness claimed that there were 30 to 40 bathers at one time. The park's director of safety and security said he was never informed of the undertow, and only saw bathers in the pool on one occasion. Not only was there no statement about pool dangers on record, but the supervisor for the previous three years denied that anyone in their department had expressed concern. Security and extra signs were posted after the incident. Spokespeople pointed out that Joyce shouldn't have been throwing frisbees in the area and suggested that the witness shouldn't have continued to work for the park in the previous season if they had an unaddressed concern.|$|E
