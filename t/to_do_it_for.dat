5|$|At the Simpson residence, Marge disapproves of {{the plan}}, but decides <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> <b>for</b> Apu's sake. While {{the plan is}} under way Homer decides {{to stay in the}} Springfield Retirement Castle with his father, posing as {{resident}} Cornelius Talmidge. Homer enjoys his stay at the home immensely, until the real Cornelius returns, at which point he flees. He returns home and gets into bed with Marge. Mrs. Nahasapeemapetilon enters to say goodbye, but is shocked to see Marge in bed with another man, and Apu on the floor. Tired of the whole charade, Marge forces Apu to tell his mother the truth, who declares that the arranged marriage will proceed as planned.|$|E
5|$|Marge is irritated when Homer's snoring (so loud, it can {{be heard}} {{throughout}} most of the city) keeps her up at night. She sees Dr. Hibbert about the problem, and asks about a surgery, but he says it is expensive and tells them to get out when Homer asks him <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> <b>for</b> free. Developing a sleep problem, she sleeps for a night with Patty and Selma, and hears on the news that her old boyfriend, Artie Ziff, is one of America's five richest people. She drunkenly dictates an e-mail to Artie to congratulate him on his appearance, but Patty and Selma doctor it to use sexual terms in an attempt to split up Marge and Homer, much to Marge's horror (for using the word sex on the Internet). Artie, who over the years seems to have developed a rather frightening obsession with Marge (his house is decorated with a large number of 'Marge' sculptures/paintings), flies in his helicopter to the Simpson house to see Marge.|$|E
5|$|The series begins while set in 1978, as Frank {{gets into}} trouble with the law. Mr. Jarvis (John Stone), {{a man from the}} {{department}} of child services, explains that Frank's father Les (Mario Kery), is a criminal and his mother, Helena (Lee Sanderson) is an alcoholic. As he grows up he aspires to emulate Les' criminal dealings. Pippa and Tom take Frank in as their first foster child. Upon moving to Summer Bay, Frank tries to get a job in Alf Stewart's (Ray Meagher) shop where he meets Roo. Frank is attracted to Roo and tells Alf that he had been helping Roo with her school work. Alf gives him the job alongside helping Roo with her studies. Frank is not good with school work so he pays his foster brother, Steven <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> <b>for</b> him. They begin dating, but Alf becomes angry with Frank for convincing Roo to skip school. The pair nearly sleep together, but Roo asks him to wait.|$|E

25|$|Lewis {{was unique}} {{in the way she}} {{approached}} sculpting abroad. She insisted on enlarging her clay and wax models in marble herself, rather than hire native Italian sculptors <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> <b>for</b> her, which was the common practice. Male sculptors were largely skeptical of the talent of female sculptors, and often accused them of not doing their own work. Harriet Hosmer, a fellow sculptor and expatriate, also did this. Lewis also was known to make sculptures before receiving commissions for them, or sent unsolicited works to Boston patrons requesting that they raise funds for materials and shipping.|$|E

25|$|Of the two {{brothers}} Grant was the more volatile, but both {{had a sense of}} physical danger about them, and both displayed stereotypical masculinity, thuggish behaviour and a tendency to resolve problems through violence. Grant was originally depicted as the more spontaneous of the Mitchell double-act, suffering from a lack of self-control, often incapable of restraining himself and requiring his elder brother <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> <b>for</b> him. Despite the brothers' closeness, rivalry between them was sometimes evident. It was later revealed that Grant's terrible temper was due to post-traumatic stress disorder, caused by nightmares and scarring memories of his combat in the Falklands War.|$|E

25|$|Roly {{has several}} brushes with death over the years. He is {{injured in a}} car {{accident}} caused by a drunk Pete Beale (Peter Dean) and is nearly burnt alive (along with Sharon) when Grant torches The Vic in an insurance scam. However, in October 1993, Roly's luck finally runs out when Sharon asks Grant to take Roly for a walk, but he pays Mandy Salter (Nicola Stapleton) £10 <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> <b>for</b> him. A few hours later, Mandy returns to explain the circumstances of Roly's death to Grant and Sharon. According to Mandy, Roly slipped his lead to chase a cat and was run over by a lorry. Sharon is devastated. 14.8 million viewers tuned in to see Roly's last appearance on-screen.|$|E

500|$|Cresswell {{admitted}} {{he had not}} made the impact {{he had hoped to}} in the York first team, but ahead of 1998–99 said [...] "I've had some stick from a small number of fans, but hopefully I can prove them wrong. I will prove them wrong. This a big season for me. I want <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> <b>for</b> York City. I want <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> <b>for</b> myself." [...] After a positive start to the season, Cresswell attracted attention from other clubs, with a number of scouts attending matches to watch him play. Manager Alan Little claimed some clubs were making illegal approaches for the player, and that this was having a detrimental effect on his performances. Preston North End manager David Moyes claimed his club had a bid of more than £500,000 for Cresswell rejected, while York chairman Douglas Craig rejected this, saying a formal offer had not been received from any club. He was York's top scorer in 1998–99 with 19 goals from 42 appearances.|$|E
500|$|At the Springfield General Hospital, Dr. Hibbert wires Homer's broken jaw shut, {{saying that}} he {{will not be able to}} speak or eat solid food for a while. Unable to talk, Homer starts to listen to his family, which pleases them, {{especially}} Marge. She decides that, since Homer is so well-behaved, they can risk going to the Springfield annual formal event at the Country Club. The next day, the jaw wires come off. Homer and Marge appear on a chat show called [...] "Afternoon Yak" [...] to discuss how Homer became a changed man. During the show, Marge, with the support of the hosts, pleads with Homer to stop his [...] "reckless ways" [...] and stay well behaved. Despite the temptation of the upcoming demolition derby, Homer decides not <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> <b>for</b> Marge's sake.|$|E
500|$|Speaking about {{delving into}} her character's history Walton commented to {{entertainment}} website Digital Spy, [...] "It {{took a little}} while and until now, we've known little about her. Nobody in the village knows who she is or where she's come from. She's just planted herself in the village knowing hardly anybody. She's quite a mysterious character. I'm absolutely loving the opportunity to explore her backstory." [...] Speaking about her reaction to the plot she continued, [...] "I was like, 'Oh my gosh!' I was so shocked but absolutely chuffed to bits {{because this is what}} all actors want – something massive like this to sink my teeth into. I feel so privileged that they've trusted me with this story. I know they've wanted <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> <b>for</b> a while and they've finally chosen me!" ...|$|E

500|$|The band {{wanted to}} avoid repeating the {{protracted}} recording process of their previous album In Rainbows (2007). Singer Thom Yorke said the band had felt that [...] "if we are gonna carry on, we need <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> <b>for</b> {{a new set of}} reasons." [...] Cover artist Stanley Donwood said: [...] "In Rainbows was very much a definitive statement, and that isn't where the band are at the moment. Where they are now is more transitory ... this album shows where Radiohead are at the moment the record was released. The music is a continuing thing. And we wanted to make the album representative of that." [...] Multi-instrumentalist Jonny Greenwood told Rolling Stone that the band had not wanted to [...] "pick up guitars and write chord sequences. We didn't want to sit {{in front of a computer}} either. We wanted a third thing, which involved playing and programming." ...|$|E
500|$|In 2002, Hertwig {{published}} her memoirs {{under the}} title Ich muß doch meinen Vater lieben, oder? ("I do have to love my father, don't I?"). Hertwig described the subsequent life of her mother who unconditionally glorified her fiancé until confronted with {{his role in the}} Holocaust. Kalder committed suicide in 1983 shortly after giving an interview in Jon Blair's documentary Schindler. Hertwig's experiences in dealing with her father's crimes are detailed in Inheritance, a 2006 documentary directed by James Moll. Appearing in the documentary is Helen Jonas-Rosenzweig, one of Göth's former housemaids. The documentary details the meeting of the two women at the Płaszów memorial site in Poland. Hertwig had requested the meeting, but Jonas-Rosenzweig was hesitant because her memories of Göth and the concentration camp were so traumatic. She eventually agreed after Hertwig wrote to her, [...] "We have <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> <b>for</b> the murdered people." [...] Jonas felt touched by this sentiment and agreed to meet her.|$|E
500|$|When {{asked in}} 2012 about {{his brother and}} an Oasis reunion Gallagher said [...] "I last texted Liam at Christmas after the City match. I don't think it's gonna happen. It would be great for {{everyone}} else except me. It'd be mega for the millions and millions and everybody else it would be brilliant but I wouldn't be very happy about it. I guess you don't know what you're gonna feel like in 20-odd years but right now, I mean I was in Oasis for nearly 20 years. I've been doing this what I'm doing now for one year and I'd {{like to see what}} it's like <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> <b>for</b> longer. I don't think anyone is pushing for a reunion either. Nobody ever brings it up in any seriousness – I mean Liam does publicly but he says a lot of things publicly. I wouldn't take anything he says seriously". After their performance of Wonderwall at the London Olympics Closing Ceremony (which Gallagher had originally turned down), he referred to Liam's band Beady Eye as 'Stratford's finest Oasis tribute band'.|$|E

500|$|IGN staff rated [...] "The Moth" [...] as the 36th best {{episode in}} all of Lost, explaining, [...] "The moth of the episode's title appears both as a metaphorical and {{physical}} symbol of the struggle to find strength within yourself, as Locke explains to Charlie, and {{to take charge of}} your own life without relying on anyone else <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> <b>for</b> you." [...] In a review focusing solely on [...] "The Moth", Chris Carabott of IGN gave the episode a 9/10, writing that the episode [...] "does a great job of utilizing screen time for most the major characters on the show", and that [...] "Locke's analogy of 'The Moth' in comparison to Charlie's situation perfectly encapsulates what many of the characters are going through on the island." [...] In a ranking of all of Losts episodes, Todd VanDerWerff of the Los Angeles Times placed [...] "The Moth" [...] at number 102, complimenting Monaghan and O'Quinn's acting, but criticizing the storyline for containing [...] "nonsensical drug abuse storytelling." [...] "The Moth", along with [...] "Pilot" [...] and [...] "House of the Rising Sun", won a PRISM Award for Charlie's drug storyline.|$|E

Grahame-Smith signed on with the {{intention}} of doing [...] "a story that is worthy of us actually doing this for real, something that is not just about cashing in, is not just about forcing a remake or a reboot down someone's throat." [...] He was also adamant that Keaton would return and that Warner Bros. would not recast the role. Burton and Keaton have not officially signed on but will return if the script is good enough. Grahame-Smith met with Keaton in February 2012, [...] "We talked {{for a couple of hours}} and talked about big picture stuff. It's a priority for Warner Bros. It's a priority for Tim.
