5|$|There {{was also}} a growing public {{awareness}} in the U.S. of military activities in Laos. During October 1969, Senator Stuart Symington (D-MO) chaired hearings of the Subcommittee of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee on Security Agreements and Commitments Abroad. The testimony of subpoenaed witnesses revealed the history of U.S. involvement in the covert commitment to Laos. Due to the closed nature of the sessions and its heavily censored transcript, however, {{the nature and extent}} of <b>that</b> <b>commitment</b> was still very little understood by the American public.|$|E
5|$|In the 17th century, oaths {{were taken}} very seriously. As King, James was Head of the Church of Scotland or Kirk, sworn by his Coronation Oath to {{preserve}} its position and privileges. The Test Act required government officials and MPs to swear an Oath of Allegiance to the Protestant religion and the monarch, regardless of personal religion. James thus received their support despite his own Catholicism but promised not to diminish {{the primacy of the}} Church of Scotland. Removing these restrictions was seen as contrary to <b>that</b> <b>commitment.</b> Many MPs were also members of the Episcopalian minority imposed on the Kirk in 1661; Argyll's defeat showed the weakening of Presbyterian influence but voting for these measures would undo that. James' credibility was seriously damaged, since he appeared willing to ignore his previous commitments, his Coronation Oath and his most loyal supporters.|$|E

30|$|The {{extent to}} which an agent trusts another {{naturally}} depends on the outcomes of their interactions. Previous computational approaches have treated the outcomes in a domain-specific way. Specifically, these approaches focus on the mathematical aspect and assume that a positive or negative experience can be identified without showing how to ground the experiences in real-world interactions, such as emails and chats. We propose Güven, an approach that relates trust to the domain-independent notion of commitments. We consider commitments since commitment outcomes {{can be associated with}} experiences and a large body of works exist on <b>commitments</b> <b>that</b> include <b>commitment</b> representation and semantics. Also, recent research shows <b>that</b> <b>commitments</b> can be extracted from interactions, such as emails and chats. Thus, we posit Güven can provide an useful basis to infer trust between agents from their interactions.|$|R
25|$|The {{earliest}} probation came as {{the result}} of an investigation into the recruiting practices of several assistant coaches and team boosters. Sean Stopperich, an offensive lineman from Muse, Pennsylvania who was part of the 1983 recruiting class and who had initially given an oral commitment to the University of Pittsburgh, told investigators that he and his family had received several thousand dollars from SMU boosters and assistant coaches to renege on <b>that</b> <b>commitment</b> and sign with the Mustangs. Stopperich, who dealt with nagging injuries carrying over from his high school playing days into his time in Dallas, would leave SMU in 1985 and return home to Pittsburgh. He initially tried to return to Pitt, but when they would not offer him a scholarship he, instead, enrolled at Temple University , where he pursued an ill-fated comeback. Stopperich suffered injuries in a car accident in 1986 that permanently put an end to his football playing days.|$|E
25|$|During Dr. Chandler's 14-year tenure, the College's {{full-time}} faculty grew to over 100 {{and the student}} body grew from 300 to over 1200 students, despite the Depression. Affordable and accessible education was also a hallmark of Chandler's tenure. In 1930, William & Mary expanded its territorial range by establishing a branch in Norfolk, Virginia. This extension would eventually become the independent state-supported institution known as Old Dominion University. Other branches around the state were to follow. Partially as a result, when in competition for state higher education funding, the College has enjoyed an especially supportive relationship with the Virginia General Assembly, which partially funds the various local programs for K-12 public school education throughout the state. The School of Education has continued and expanded <b>that</b> <b>commitment</b> by conducting in-service training and summer programs which enable continuing education of teachers and other instructional personnel. As a result, many of Virginia's public school teachers who utilize these services later achieve masters and doctoral degrees, with some advancing to positions of leadership in school divisions or with the State Department of Education.|$|E
25|$|In 2000, he {{announced}} that the company would achieve a 25% improvement in fuel efficiency in the company's light truck fleet, including SUVs, by mid-decade. <b>That</b> <b>commitment</b> proved to be impractical, given consumer preference for heavy towing capacity and large, powerful engines in their trucks; the company announced in 2003 that competitive market conditions and technological and cost challenges would prevent it from achieving the goal. Ford terminated its ongoing electric vehicle program as impractical and unaffordable from a profitable business standpoint. Some environmentalists questioned Bill Ford and the Company's commitment to environmental concerns, and others pointed to Ford Motor Company's continued marketing of the fuel-thirsty SUVs as evidence of an other-than-green corporate agenda. Ford's position {{is that for the}} company to remain profitable and competitive (and remain in business), it must supply what customers demand. During 2006, there was an unexpectedly large swing in consumer demand away from pickups and SUVs to smaller cars and crossover vehicles, due to rapid increases in gasoline prices, and Ford Motor Company was largely unprepared for such a sudden shift in demand.|$|E

25|$|The three {{battalion}} assault {{force was}} due to move out on 26 November. However, Vang Pao refused to launch the attack until 6 December. Despite reconnaissance showing no enemy around the landing zone, Vang Pao insisted that his ancestor had appeared in a dream to warn him that the enemy awaited him, although intelligence reports insisted the landing zone was clear. After landing on 6 December, the attack force formed four columns to advance on Phou Pha Thi. They found themselves with only half the U.S. air sorties planned upon, and <b>that</b> <b>commitment</b> for five days only; the brand new Operation Commando Hunt truck killing campaign on the Ho Chi Minh Trail was absorbing the rest. The push soon reached the hamlet of Houei Ma, six kilometers southwest of the Lima Site 85 objective. At this point, 10,000 refugees from the communists flooded the village, clogging the Hmong offensive. A few of the refugees were randomly picked for questioning by CIA agents accompanying the guerrillas. They verified that during the previous week, when the original assault was supposed to land, just as the ancestral dream had predicted, a large transient contingent of Vietnamese soldiers returning from the Luang Prabang front had been near the landing zone.|$|E

500|$|Bob Weinstein {{approached}} Craven {{early in}} the planning stages, because he felt Craven's previous work in the genre that combined horror and comedy would make him the perfect person to bring Williamson's script to screen. [...] Craven was already busy developing a remake of The Haunting and was considering distancing himself from the horror genre. He was growing weary of what he felt was an inherent misogyny and violence in it. Weinstein approached other directors, including Robert Rodriguez, Danny Boyle, George A. Romero, and Sam Raimi. Williamson said that they [...] "didn't get it"; he was concerned that having read the script, many of the directors believed the film to be purely a comedy. [...] Craven was approached again but continued to pass in spite of repeated requests. When production of The Haunting collapsed, Craven was freed from <b>that</b> <b>commitment</b> and found himself {{in need of a}} project. Meanwhile, Drew Barrymore had signed on to the film at her own request. When he heard an established actress wanted to be involved, Craven reasoned that Scary Movie might be different from other films of the genre he had previously undertaken, and he contacted Weinstein to accept the job.|$|E

2500|$|Noted theorist Max Weber {{suggested}} that classic feudalism in pre-modern-state Europe {{was an example}} of warlordism, as the state regime was unable to [...] "exercise a monopoly on the use of force within its territory" [...] and the monarch relied on the commitment of loyal knights and other nobility to mobilize their private armies in support of the crown for specific military campaigns. As noted French philosopher Alexis de Tocqueville and political scientists such as E.J. Hobsbawm and Theda Skocpol observed in their analyses of the Ancien Régime, the French Revolution and democratization in Europe, <b>that</b> <b>commitment</b> was contingent upon a bargaining process in which the king or queen had to guarantee additional territory, revenue, status or other privileges, meaning that these early European states were weak and the relationship between the crown and knights constituted the form of interdependent warlordism known as Cooperative Warlord Politics.|$|E
2500|$|Edmonds later {{argued in}} the Official History that Robertson {{had lost his}} {{position}} because of his bluntness and inability {{to get on with}} politicians. Woodward rejects this argument, arguing that although the government's failure to agree on clear war aims, other than defeating Germany, made his job much harder, ministers largely supported Robertson's commitment to the Western Front throughout 1916 and 1917, rather than Lloyd George's many schemes, until the manpower situation meant that a winding-down of <b>that</b> <b>commitment</b> was becoming inevitable (although in fact the war would take a different turn in 1918). Robertson himself noted in 1932 that Lloyd George's object (the [...] "firework strategy" [...] as he called it at the time) had been [...] "to avoid fighting Germans" [...] and that his survival as CIGS had often depended on Lloyd George's inability to persuade either the French or his ministerial colleagues to adopt his plans rather than Robertson's.|$|E
2500|$|The leap {{of faith}} is his {{conception}} of how an individual would believe in God or how a person would act in love. Faith is not a decision based on evidence that, say, certain beliefs about God are true or a certain person is worthy of love. No such evidence could ever be enough to completely justify the kind of total commitment involved in true religious faith or romantic love. Faith involves making <b>that</b> <b>commitment</b> anyway. Kierkegaard thought that to have faith {{is at the same}} time to have doubt. So, for example, for one to truly have faith in God, one would also have to doubt one's beliefs about God; the doubt is the rational part of a person's thought involved in weighing evidence, without which the faith would have no real substance. Someone who does not realize that Christian doctrine is inherently doubtful and that there can be no objective certainty about its truth does not have faith but is merely credulous. For example, it takes no faith to believe that a pencil or a table exists, when one is looking at it and touching it. In the same way, to believe or have faith in God is to know that one has no perceptual or any other access to God, and yet still has faith in God. Kierkegaard writes, [...] "doubt is conquered by faith, just as it is faith which has brought doubt into the world".|$|E

2500|$|American Reform, especially, turned {{action for}} social and {{progressive}} causes into {{an important part of}} religious commitment. From {{the second half of the}} 20th Century, it employed the old rabbinic notion of Tikkun Olam, [...] "repairing the world", as a slogan under which constituents were encouraged to partake in various initiatives for the betterment of society. The Religious Action Center of Reform Judaism became an important lobby in service of progressive causes such as the rights of women, minorities, LGBT and the like. Tikkun Olam has become the central venue for active participation for many affiliates, even leading critics to negatively describe Reform as little more than a means employed by Jewish liberals to claim <b>that</b> <b>commitment</b> to their political convictions was also a religious activity and demonstrates fealty to Judaism. Dana Evan Kaplan stated that [...] "Tikkun Olam has incorporated only leftist, socialist-like elements. In truth, it is political, basically a mirror of the most radically leftist components of the Democratic Party platform, causing many to say that Reform Judaism is simply 'the Democratic Party with Jewish holidays'." [...] Rabbi Jakob Josef Petuchowski complained that under the influence of secular Jews who constitute most of its congregants since the 1950s, when lack of religious affiliation was particularly frowned upon, [...] "Reform Judaism is today in the forefront of secularism in America... Very often indistinguishable from the ACLU... The fact of the matter is that it has, somewhere along the line, lost its religious moorings." [...] In Israel, the Religious Action Center is very active in the judicial field, often resorting to litigation both in cases concerning civil rights in general and the official status of Reform within the state, in particular.|$|E
