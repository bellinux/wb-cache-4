25|$|As that Beatles song played, I {{became a}} killer. Joe Colucci {{was going to}} die. I {{was going to kill}} him because he was {{plotting}} <b>to</b> <b>kill</b> <b>me.</b> I felt the rage inside me.... Everything went in slow motion. I could almost feel the bullet leaving the gun and entering his skull. It was strange. I didn't hear the first shot. I didn't see any blood. His head didn't seem to move.... I felt like I was a million miles away, like this was all a dream.|$|E
500|$|When someone punches you so {{much and}} so hard, {{it feels as if}} your face is broken.

500|$|None of the {{defendants}} testified. Outside of court, LaRouche denied all the charges, calling them [...] "an all-out frame-up by a state and federal task force," [...] {{and said that the}} federal government was trying to kill him. [...] "The purpose of this frame-up is not to send me to prison. It's to kill me," [...] LaRouche said. [...] "In prison it's fairly easy <b>to</b> <b>kill</b> <b>me</b> ... If this sentence goes through, I'm dead." ...|$|E
500|$|I {{would say}} it was a directorial {{collaborative}} effort. We went to the rainforest and that was interesting. Part of the reason was [...] I love Puerto Rico one of my favorite places ever and I did one of my favorite videos, 'Honey', in Puerto Rico at the El Conquistador hotel. I was involved every step of the way... I like a lot of the shots in the video... There was a moment where I had to do an additional water sequence with no director, just myself and a camera man with an underwater camera.

6000|$|... "I {{have thought}} of that, too," [...] she replied, with an almost unearthly calm. [...] "But there are {{difficulties}} either way. At any rate, I am glad he did not succeed this time.

6000|$|... "Wait! To see you--and <b>to</b> hear--of him--almost <b>killed</b> <b>me</b> with joy," [...] she panted. Her little hands, once {{so strong}} and brown, but now thin and white, {{fastened}} tight in {{the fringe of}} his buckskin hunting-coat.|$|R

Benz was offered the small role of the vampire Darla in the pilot episode of Buffy the Vampire Slayer. Her performance was so well-received that her character appeared in a few more episodes. In an interview with TheTVAddict.com, Benz said of her casting: [...] "I was supposed to die in the pilot, but about halfway through the pilot Joss Whedon was like, 'We're giving you a name and we're not going to kill you.'

[...] In 2005, Pitchfork ranked the album the 84th best of 2000-2004. Herren was overwhelmed with the positive reception the album received, exclaiming that [...] "Most of it was so positive, but I'd also get a really strong reaction from people- some that want <b>to</b> <b>kill</b> <b>me,</b> 'cause they're under the impression that I'm trying to kill hip hop or something, and I'm like 'uh see ya, whatever man.'" ...|$|E

They threatened <b>to</b> <b>kill</b> <b>me</b> and kidnap my children. Some even attacked me physically, a room where I was to speak in Munich was bombed just before I was to be there, and several times I was sued. Nobody ever claimed I had said anything false or made mistakes. They just claimed all this would damage their reputations." [...] Rosmus was profiled on 60 Minutes, and her story was the subject of the 1990 West German drama film, The Nasty Girl. Rosmus was presented with the Conscience-in-Media Award in a special ceremony at the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum.|$|E

6000|$|... "I am {{named the}} Lily now: once I had another name. Nada, {{daughter}} of Mopo, I was once; but name and all else are dead, and I go <b>to</b> join them. <b>Kill</b> <b>me</b> {{and make an}} end. I will shut my eyes, that I may not see the great axe flash." ...|$|R
60|$|Shrewd guide! I had {{forgotten}} that I held a rod.

2500|$|Although {{referenced}} by Merriam-Webster dictionaries {{as having}} {{first appeared in}} 1744, the American term Scotch-Irish is undoubtedly older.

2500|$|Of the controversy, Steinbeck wrote, [...] "The vilification of me {{out here}} from the large landowners and bankers is pretty bad.
