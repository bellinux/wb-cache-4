Results showed that while family burdens correlated significantly with <b>the</b> mental <b>health</b> <b>of</b> caregivers, <b>the</b> physiological perspective was found to be negatively and significantly associated with <b>the</b> mental <b>health</b> <b>of</b> caregivers. Findings were explained in terms of a shift in the perceptions of responsibility concerning the causes of mental illness from a family and collective orientation to an individualistic one.
