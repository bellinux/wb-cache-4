5|$|Donna {{comes to}} Charlie's to see {{musician}} Ty Harper, who is her main focus in life. Ty introduces Donna to Rachel Kinski (Caitlin Stasey) and <b>they</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> her to leave. Ringo Brown decides to help Donna make friends. Donna helps to clear {{an area of}} the bush and when a fire breaks out, she is suspected of starting it because of her strange behaviour. Daniel Fitzgerald (Brett Tucker), a school counsellor, talks with Donna, who then decides to transfer to Erinsborough High. There she eventually becomes friends with Rachel and Bridget Parker (Eloise Mignon), and starts dating Ringo. Donna's father, Matt, bans her from seeing Ringo and she steals his car. Donna accidentally hits Nicola West (Imogen Bailey) and her dog, Bronte. However, Donna is initially unaware that she hit Nicola and she and Ringo ask Lucas Fitzgerald to fix the car. When she realises that she also hit Nicola, Donna tells Matt what happened. He tries to frame Lucas to save her, but he is caught and then goes on the run. Elle Robinson takes Donna in and becomes her legal guardian.|$|E
25|$|Fergus {{is upset}} when he can't find any baby {{pictures}} {{of him in the}} family album. He storms off to the attic and goes through the mirror. Mandy finds a picture of him as a baby, and puts it on the mirror for him to see. When Fergus comes back through the mirror it transforms him into the baby version of himself in the photograph. The children do {{not know what to do}} and send him back through where he is found by Violette. Constance tells the other that her mother found him and <b>they</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> him back. They realise they must find a more recent picture of Fergus. They decide to use the picture which had been taken that morning. They return through the mirror and Fergus is restored to his teenage self, unaware of what had happened.|$|E
2500|$|The Hangover Part III is a 2013 American comedy film {{produced}} by Legendary Pictures and distributed by Warner Bros. Pictures. It {{is the third}} and final installment in The Hangover trilogy. The film stars Bradley Cooper, Ed Helms, Zach Galifianakis, Justin Bartha, and Ken Jeong. The supporting cast includes Jeffrey Tambor, Heather Graham, Mike Epps, Melissa McCarthy and John Goodman with Todd Phillips directing a screenplay written by himself and Craig Mazin. The film follows the [...] "Wolfpack" [...] (Phil, Stu, Doug, and Alan) as <b>they</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> Alan the help he needs after facing a personal crisis. However, things go awry when an incident from the original film comes back to haunt them.|$|E

2500|$|Sandspur- A small trash-eating faerie with {{a fondness}} for sand and a {{constant}} hunger, Sandspur is caught by Laurie and Nick and kept as a pet. Despite his first attempts to escape, he accepts Nick and Laurie and follows them around even after <b>they</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> rid of him. Although Taloa calls him a [...] "hob" [...] in The Nixie's Song and Laurie calls him a hobgoblin in A Giant Problem, he is later identified by Laurie as a spriggan in The Wyrm King when his hunger makes him swell up. He is therefore the only creature in the books (other than the Wyrm King and the humanoid insects from The Nixie's Song) whose species is not mentioned in Arthur Spiderwick's Field Guide. Despite this under Goblins in the Field Guide there is a Goblin with a bottle on its back just like Sandspur. In {{the end of the}} book, he apparently is also able to use glamour to make himself look like a cat.|$|E
2500|$|Climate plays a {{major role}} in the moose-wolf {{relationship}} as well. Since El Niño hit in 1998, the climate has warmed up, which has significantly affected the moose population across North America. [...] The warmer climate in recent years has produced more Moose winter ticks, which consume the blood of animals, making them more susceptible to anemia, and induce the moose to scratch off their hair, exposing them to hypothermia in cold weather. [...] A moose can have tens of thousands of ticks feeding on its blood at one time, each sucking up to one milliliter of blood. The biting ticks cause a lot of discomfort for the moose, so <b>they</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> the ticks off their bodies by biting off their hair, and rubbing up against trees. This preoccupies moose, and keeps them from browsing for food, which can lead to malnutrition. Compounded with blood loss, moose weakened by ticks are easier for wolves to kill. [...] Ticks are more prominent in years where spring arrives earlier than usual, because when they fall on ground not covered in snow, then they can reproduce. Otherwise, they die out. [...] Then, if the summer is hot, ticks are able to reproduce at a higher rate. Hot summers also lead to moose resting in the shade, or in the water to keep cool, making them easier prey for wolves. Also, hot summers lead to tougher foraging for moose which makes them less prepared and more vulnerable to the winter. Not only has the recent warming of Isle Royale hurt the moose, but completely opposite problems harm them also. Harsh winters pose significant problems to moose, because moose have problems finding food when there is too much snow on the ground. [...] The less snow there is, the more freely moose can move around the island. When there is a significant amount of snow, moose stay in conifer swamps, making them easier prey for wolves, because they are more confined, and immobilized due to the snow. [...] Deep or heavy snow decreases the speed and agility of moose that is necessary to evade wolf attacks, and calves born during a winter with particularly deep snow are more vulnerable to being weaker prey for wolves later on in their lives because of foraging problems that occur when the snow is deep.|$|E

6000|$|It may be {{urged that}} {{religious}} services have not entertainment for their object. But the people, when {{not engaged in}} business or labor, have it for their object. If the clergy do not choose to adapt their ministrations to the characters of those to whom they wish to minister, that is their own affair; but let them accept the consequences. [...] "The masses" [...] move {{along the line of}} least reluctance. They do not really enjoy Sunday at all; <b>they</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> through the day in the manner that is least wearisome to the spirit. Possibly their taste is not what it ought to be. If this minister were a physician of bodies instead of souls, and patients who had not called him in should refuse to take the medicine which he thought his best and they his nastiest, he should either offer them another, a little less disagreeable if a little less efficacious, or let them alone. In no case is he justified in asking the civil authority to hold their noses while he plies the spoon.|$|E

60|$|With a shout he sprang {{forward and}} struck {{to the ground}} {{a man who was}} dodging behind Dias with uplifted knife, while Bertie leapt on to the back of another, the shock {{throwing}} the man down face forward. Bertie was on his feet in a moment, and brought the stick he carried with all his force down on the man's head as he tried to rise. Then, springing forward again, he struck another man a heavy blow on the wrist. The knife dropped from the man's hand, and as he dashed with a fierce oath upon Bertie the stick descended again, this time on his head, and felled him to the ground. In the meantime one of the assailants had turned fiercely on Harry and aimed a blow at him with his knife; but with the ease of a practised boxer Harry stepped back, and before the man could again raise the knife he leaped in and struck him a tremendous blow on the point of his chin. The fifth man took to his heels immediately. The other four lay where they had fallen, evidently fearing they would be stabbed should <b>they</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> on to their feet.|$|E
6000|$|Peter Rabbit looked thoughtful. [...] "You can't do it," [...] said he. [...] "You simply can't do it.

And night or day old Granny Fox or Reddy Fox might come {{snooping}} around, and if they did, they would be sure to catch you. I tell you what, you stay right here! The dear Old Briar-patch is the safest place in the world. Why, just think, here you can come out in broad daylight and laugh at Granny and Reddy Fox and at old Roughleg the Hawk, because the good old brambles will keep them out, if <b>they</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> you. You can make just as good tunnels under the snow here as you had there, {{and there are lots}} and lots of seeds on the ground to eat. You know I don't care for them myself. I'm lonesome sometimes, living here all alone. You stay here, and we'll have the Old Briar-patch to ourselves." ...|$|E
60|$|I {{never saw}} people {{standing}} in a train, except that once which I have already noted, when in a very crowded car in Wales, two women, decent elderly persons, got in and were suffered to remain on foot by {{the young men who}} had comfortable places; no one dreamed, apparently, of offering to give up his seat. But, on the other hand, a superior civilization is shown in what I may call the manual forbearance of the trolley and railway folk, who are so apt to nudge and punch you at home here, when they wish your attention. The like happened to me only once in England, and that was at Liverpool, where the tram conductor, who laid hands on me instead of speaking, had perhaps been corrupted by the unseen American influences of a port at which we arrive so abundantly and indiscriminately. I did not resent the touch, though it is what every one is expected to do, if aggrieved, and every one else does it in England. Within his rights, every one is safe; though there may be some who have no rights. If there were, I did not see them, and I suppose that, as an alien, I might have refused to stand up and uncover when the band began playing God Save the King, as it did {{at the end of every}} musical occasion; I might have urged that, being no subject of the King, I did not feel bound to join in the general prayer. But that would have been churlish, and, where every one had been so civil to me, I did not see why I should not be civil to the King, in a small matter. In the aggregate indeed, it is not a small matter, and I suppose that the stranger always finds the patriotism of a country molestive. Patriotism is, at any rate, very disagreeable, with the sole exception of our own, which we are constantly wishing to share with other people, especially with English people. We spare them none of it, even in their own country, and yet many of us object to theirs; I feel that I am myself being rather offensive about it, now, at this distance from them. Upon the whole, not caring very actively for us, one way or the other, they take it amiably; <b>they</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> our point of view, and, as if it were a thorn, self-sacrificially press their bosoms against it, in the present or recent entente cordiale. None of their idiosyncrasies is more notable than their patience, their kindness with our divergence from them; but I am not sure that, having borne with us when we are by, they do not take it out of us when we are away.|$|E
