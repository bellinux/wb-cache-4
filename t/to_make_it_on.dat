5|$|In 1955, Shepard ran for an at-large {{seat on the}} Philadelphia City Council. By {{the rules}} of the limited voting system for the at-large seats, each {{political}} party could nominate five candidates and voters could only vote for five, with the result being that the majority party could only take five of the seven seats, leaving two for the minority party. Shepard won one of the five Democratic slots and was easily elected. On the council, he served as head of the public works committee. In 1956, charter amendments aimed at weakening civil service protections were proposed. Shepard initially opposed the change, but later voted in favor after party leaders promised him more black Democrats would get political appointments. The amendments found the required two-thirds vote in Council <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>on</b> to the ballot for popular approval but failed in a vote that April.|$|E
5|$|Sawyer {{found himself}} {{at odds with}} the Democratic {{organization}} on some occasions, most prominently on amendments to the city charter. In 1956, charter amendments aimed at weakening civil service protections were proposed. Sawyer had campaigned against the idea and refused to go along with them. Even without his support, the amendments found the required two-thirds vote in Council <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>on</b> to the ballot for popular approval. The Pennsylvania Supreme Court struck down some of the amendments, and the rest failed in a referendum that April. Such disagreements led the Democratic City Committee to withhold their endorsement of Sawyer for a second term in 1959, and he retired from elected office to return to his law practice. In 1965, while serving as president of the southeastern Pennsylvania chapter of the Americans for Democratic Action, Sawyer led a group of Democrats who endorsed Republican Arlen Specter for district attorney of Philadelphia.|$|E

Originally the couple had agreed upon a much smaller settlement; a $100,000 lump payment, $1,000 a month spousal support, and $500 a month child support. Priscilla was keen <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>on</b> her own and prove that her marriage to Elvis was not about money. However, soon afterwards, her new lawyers had persuaded her to up her demands, pointing out that a star of Elvis' stature could easily afford more for his former wife and child.|$|E

On the next drive by Texas Tech, Graham Harrell's pass was intercepted by Uche Anyanwu. The next Nevada drive stalled on a three-and-out. Nevada was forced to punt to Eric Morris who took it 86 yards for a touchdown, giving the Red Raiders the lead, 7–3. Texas Tech and Nevada failed to score on their next drives with Nevada missing a field goal with a few minutes remaining in the first quarter.|$|E

25|$|Benoit and Dean Malenko won the ECW World Tag Team Championship from Sabu and The Tazmaniac in February 1995, Benoit's first American title.

The team lost the championship to The Public Enemy that April at ECW Three Way Dance. Benoit spent some time in ECW feuding with The Steiner Brothers and rekindling the feud with 2 Cold Scorpio. He was forced to leave ECW after his work visa expired; Heyman was supposed to renew it, but he failed <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>on</b> time, so Benoit left as a matter of job security and the ability to enter the United States.

500|$|NBC were {{positive}} about the project, {{but there was still}} some concern that the homosexual subject matter would cause alarm. Ellen DeGeneres' sitcom Ellen that aired on ABC was canceled the year before Will & Grace premiered because ratings had plummeted after the show became [...] "too gay". Despite the criticism ABC received for DeGeneres' coming out episode, [...] "The Puppy Episode", [...] "there's no question that show made it easier for Will & Grace <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>on</b> the air," [...] said Kohan. He added, [...] "Will & Grace had a better shot at succeeding where Ellen failed, however, because Will has known about his homosexuality for twenty years. He's not exploring that awkward territory {{for the first time as}} Ellen did. The process of self-discovery and the pain most gay men go through is fascinating, but the average American is put off by it." [...] Kohan also commented that rather than concentrating on Will's sexuality, Will & Grace is using it as a device: [...] "It's like that When Harry Met Sally... line when Billy Crystal says, 'A man and woman can never be friends, because sex always gets in the way.' What we want to explore is what happens between a man and a woman when sex doesn't get in the way." ...|$|E

2500|$|Vocaloid {{was sold}} as a product for {{professional}} musicians, and although there were many producers using the software within Japan by 2011, a report was released detailing the true reflections of the Vocaloid craze. It was conducted independently by fans of the Vocaloid software and detailed the popularity of certain Vocaloids over others. [...] Most Vocaloid related videos struggled to get over 5,000 views and the most popular producers gaining the most interest over lesser popular producers. In order of the most video uploads were Hatsune Miku (first), Kagamine Rin (second), Gumi (third), Megurine Luka (fourth), Kagamine Len (fifth) and Kaito (sixth) had the most videos uploaded related to them, while all other Vocaloids had less than 1,000 uploads related to them. This was not true for all the calculations they ran to determine the popularity, including average and mean views and mylists. In the end, only Gumi and the Kagamine software packages managed {{to stay on the}} top six lists of all their calculations, with popular Vocaloid Hatsune Miku failing <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>on</b> the mean average top six list calculations for the study period.

2500|$|On 15 August, Rupprecht {{wrote that}} General Erich Ludendorff {{had visited the}} army group and said that with the French {{preparing}} an attack at Verdun, an offensive on the eastern front could only go ahead if Army Group Crown Prince Rupprecht defended the Ypres Salient without reinforcement.

In 1931, Gough wrote that II Corps had gained valuable ground, which gave a view of German lines, removing the last German positions overlooking Ypres. The British were counter-attacked five times during the afternoon and the last attack pushed the 18th Division out of Glencorse Wood. In 1942, the writers of Der Weltkrieg, the German official history described the miserable living conditions of the troops in early August, the rise in the number of sickness cases and casualties caused by the British artillery. The British attempted to make piecemeal advances covered by massed artillery-fire and on 10 August managed to advance up to [...] at the junction between Gruppe Wytschaete and Gruppe Ypern. Prior and Wilson wrote in 1996, that several fine days preceded the attack but the deluge on 8 August flooded the ground again. The British artillery had failed to subdue the German guns in the unusually rainy weather and the British had been severely bombarded before the attack. The German infantry could do little to resist the attack, having spent too long in the front line and had become demoralised. The British made good progress but German counter-attacks and machine-gun fire from Inverness Copse forced back the British until the [...] "mere" [...] advance of the 25th Division, was all that remained. The attack was a costly failure and did not even reach the second objective of 31 July; the only good feature of the attack had been <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>on</b> the Gheluvelt Plateau.|$|E
