2500|$|Another {{well-known}} client that Robinson took on was the Order of the Iron Hall, nominally a fraternal benefit society {{founded in}} Indiana in 1881. [...] The organization {{was essentially a}} fraudulent investment vehicle that {{was a combination of}} a tontine (where increased benefits accrue to survivors as investors die) and a Ponzi scheme (where deposits of later investors are used to pay off earlier ones). [...] Tontines were illegal under Massachusetts insurance regulations, and the Iron Hall was in 1887 threatened with an injunction <b>to</b> <b>stop</b> <b>doing</b> business in the state. [...] It hired Robinson to appear before the legislature, {{and he was able to}} secure legislative alteration to the statute governing fraternal societies that would permit continued operation. [...] Iron Hall went into receivership in 1892, and the state insurance commissioner criticized Robinson for his defense of the organization in his reports, which he charged exacerbated the financial losses incurred by Iron Hall and similar organizations. (The Iron Hall was one of the more high-profile of a large number of similar investment schemes, in which the operators of the organization also frequently siphoned funds away in the guise of salaries and expenses.) ...|$|E
2500|$|During the 2012 {{presidential primary}} campaign, {{when asked what}} the federal government’s role should be in {{responding}} to natural disasters, Romney suggested that responsibility for handling disasters should be taken from FEMA, the federal agency dedicated to disaster relief, and given to the states, or outsourced to the private sector: [...] "Every time you have an occasion to take something {{from the federal government}} and send it back to the states, that's the right direction. And if you can go even further, and send it back to the private sector, that's even better. Instead of thinking in the federal budget, what we should cut -- we should ask ourselves the opposite question. What should we keep? We should take all of what we're doing at the federal level and say, what are the things we're doing that we don't have to do? And those things we've got <b>to</b> <b>stop</b> <b>doing,</b> because we're borrowing $1.6 trillion more this year than we're taking in." [...] Asked whether by that he specifically meant disaster relief, he replied, “we cannot afford to do those things without jeopardizing the future for our kids. It is simply immoral, in my view, for us to continue to rack up larger and larger debts and pass them on to our kids, knowing full well that we'll all be dead and gone before it's paid off.
