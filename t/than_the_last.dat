5|$|Similar to its {{predecessor}} Banjo-Kazooie, Banjo-Tooie features three-dimensional worlds containing items to be collected. Among the items are golden jigsaw pieces, called Jiggies, {{that are used}} to complete jigsaw puzzles that unlock the levels. Instead of exploring the hub world in search of incomplete puzzle boards as in Banjo-Kazooie, a singular board is used within a temple where Master Jiggywiggy resides. Whenever the player has obtained the number of Jiggies required, a timed puzzle-completion challenge can be played, after which Jiggywiggy grants access to each world. Each puzzle challenge requires more Jiggies <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>last.</b>|$|E
5|$|According to Kohlberg, someone {{progressing}} to {{a higher}} stage of moral reasoning cannot skip stages. For example, an individual cannot jump from being concerned mostly with peer judgments (stage three) to being a proponent of social contracts (stage five). On encountering a moral dilemma and finding their current level of moral reasoning unsatisfactory, however, an individual will look to the next level. Realizing {{the limitations of the}} current stage of thinking is the driving force behind moral development, as each progressive stage is more adequate <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>last.</b> The process is therefore considered to be constructive, as it is initiated by the conscious construction of the individual, and is not in any meaningful sense a component of the individual's innate dispositions, or a result of past inductions.|$|E

The earnings placed the film as the 16th highest-grossing opening day ever (22nd with ticket-price inflation). It went on to be number one film {{at the box office}} with a total of $85million. Among summer kick-offs, it ranked fifth behind Spider-Man, X2, Spider-Man 3, and Iron Man and it was in the top ten of comic book adaptations. The opening was lower <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> film in the franchise, X-Men: The Last Stand, as well as X2, but higher than X-Men, the first film in the series.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{conclusion}} of the Civil War, Gwyn resumed the life he had left behind in 1861. He returned home to his wife Margaret and daughters Elizabeth and Matilda, now five years older <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> time he saw them. He applied for his military pension on October 6, 1866. Though Gwyn served in positions with a difficulty as high as major general, because he was only brevet, the payment he received would be reduced to the level of his highest non-brevet rank; which would be colonel, the position he effectively gave up on October 14, 1864.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, the Enterprise {{is fired}} upon by a cloaked attacker, with each {{subsequent}} attack stronger <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>last,</b> straining the ship's shields. Chief Engineer Lt. Logan (Vyto Ruginis) {{goes to the}} bridge to demand that the Enterprise flee the planet and attempts to take command, as he outranks La Forge, but La Forge refuses, pointing out that Logan lacks the authority to remove him, and orders {{him to return to}} Engineering. As the attacks continue, La Forge recalls Logan to the bridge and orders a saucer separation, leaving Logan in charge of the saucer, and taking command of the star-drive section from the battle bridge himself to return to Minos.|$|E

5|$|The {{battleship}} race soon accelerated once more, {{placing a}} great {{burden on the}} finances of the governments which engaged in it. The first dreadnoughts were not much more expensive <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> pre-dreadnoughts, but the cost per ship continued to grow thereafter. Modern battleships were the crucial element of naval power {{in spite of their}} price. Each battleship was a signal of national power and prestige, {{in a manner similar to}} the nuclear weapons of today. Germany, France, Russia, Italy, Japan and Austria all began dreadnought programmes, and second-rank powers including the Ottoman Empire, Argentina, Brazil, and Chile commissioned dreadnoughts to be built in British and American yards.|$|E
5|$|The {{first episode}} premiered at a {{screening}} on September 19, 2016, with the season then airing for 22 episodes on ABC, from September 20, 2016 until May 16, 2017. The premiere debuted to 3.58 million viewers, down from previous season premieres but {{average for the}} series. Critical response to the season was positive, with many feeling that each pod was better <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> and in particular praising the visual effects and tone of Ghost Rider, the writing and acting for LMD, and the character development and political commentary explored during Agents of Hydra. The season saw series low viewership, but was still considered to have solved ABC's problem during its timeslot, and the show was renewed for a fifth season on May 11, 2017.|$|E
5|$|The temple {{stands on}} a terrace raised higher than the city. It is made of three {{rectangular}} galleries rising to a central tower, each level higher <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>last.</b> Mannikka interprets these galleries as being dedicated to the king, Brahma, the moon, and Vishnu. Each gallery has a gopura {{at each of the}} points, and the two inner galleries each have towers at their corners, forming a quincunx with the central tower. Because the temple faces west, the features are all set back towards the east, leaving more space to be filled in each enclosure and gallery on the west side; for the same reason the west-facing steps are shallower than those on the other sides.|$|E

5|$|Square {{expected}} {{the game to}} sell at least two million copies worldwide owing to the reduced PlayStation 2's fanbase, making it smaller <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> three released titles. However, within four days of its release in Japan, the game had sold over 1.4 million copies in pre-orders, which set a record for the fastest-selling console RPG. These figures exceeded the performances of Final Fantasy VII and IX in a comparable period, and Final Fantasy X became the first PlayStation 2 game to reach two million and four million sold copies. In October 2007, the game was listed as the 8th best-selling game for the PlayStation 2. Final Fantasy X sold over 2.26 million copies in Japan alone in 2001, and sold 6.6million copies worldwide by January 2004. By July 2006, it had sold 2.3 million copies and earned $95 million in the United States. Next Generation ranked it as the 11th highest-selling game launched for the PlayStation 2, Xbox or GameCube between January 2000 and July 2006 in that country.|$|E
