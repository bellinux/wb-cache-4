40|$|Board {{composition}} and role in corporate governance {{have been under}} close scrutiny both in the academic and "civil " worlds.

On the one hand, it presents findings on how social connections can affect corporate governance. On the other hand, it outlines the main results of information aggregation and conformity effects in committees. The object of this dissertation is to study how these play a part on boards and more specifically how they affect a CEO’s election. Indeed, people commonly think that CEOs get appointed not only because of their talent or ability but also because of their social connections. The second chapter explores this intuition from a theoretical perspective, using a static Bayesian game. Directors want to elect the best candidate but <b>they</b> also <b>wan...</b>|$|R
