His novels {{captured}} <b>the</b> <b>ebb</b> <b>and</b> <b>flow</b> of society, and he demonstrated the far-reaching impact of major historical changes. A slew of authors in France attempted to replicate Scott's success, but their works were isolated from one another and divorced from their surroundings.|$|E
5|$|As {{military}} governor, Johnson {{sought to}} eliminate rebel {{influence in the}} state. He demanded loyalty oaths from public officials, and shut down all newspapers owned by Confederate sympathizers. Much of eastern Tennessee remained in Confederate hands, and <b>the</b> <b>ebb</b> <b>and</b> <b>flow</b> of war during 1862 sometimes brought Confederate control again close to Nashville. However, the Confederates allowed his wife and family {{to pass through the}} lines to join him. Johnson undertook the defense of Nashville as best he could, though the city was continually harassed by cavalry raids led by General Nathan Bedford Forrest. Relief from Union regulars did not come until William S. Rosecrans defeated the Confederates at Murfreesboro in early 1863. Much of eastern Tennessee was captured later that year.|$|E

25|$|The {{dynamics}} of New Brunswick politics {{are different from}} those of other Canadian provinces. The lack of a dominant urban centre in the province means that the government has to be responsive to issues affecting all areas of the province. In addition, the presence of a large Francophone minority dictates that consensus politics is necessary, even when there is a majority government present. In this manner, <b>the</b> <b>ebb</b> <b>and</b> <b>flow</b> of New Brunswick provincial politics parallels the federal stage.|$|E

25|$|Various {{proposals}} for a fixed link across the Northumberland Strait {{can be traced}} {{as far back as}} the 1870s when the province's railway system was developed. Subsequent proposals arose during federal elections in the late 1950s and early 1960s. <b>The</b> <b>ebb</b> <b>and</b> <b>flow</b> of public support for a fixed link was indirectly tied to the varying levels of federal investment in ferry and steamship connections to the province over the years, finally culminating in a proposal in the mid-1980s which resulted in the current bridge being constructed.|$|E

25|$|Slightly paralleled by A. L. Rowse, {{author of}} Shakespeare's Sonnets: The Problems Solved, lines 3-4 are {{interpreted}} as {{alluding to the}} youth's beauty as a contrast with his friends. As the youth's beauty wanes, so his friends wither, as he grows older; contrasting Sethna's view of the youth's beauty accentuating Shakespeare's lack of beauty. Rowse also suggests that this idea may also imply a further consistency; Shakespeare's concern with <b>the</b> <b>ebb</b> <b>and</b> <b>flow</b> of things; their waxing and waning. Perhaps the influence of constant Ovidian thought.|$|E
25|$|This led to {{long periods}} of {{evolution}} in near complete isolation. The isolation of the island was not absolute, given {{the rise and fall}} of sea level caused by <b>the</b> <b>ebb</b> <b>and</b> <b>flow</b> of ice ages. Land bridges or islands formed between Tasmania and its neighbour, mainland Australia. Thus new species came to Tasmania while Gondwanan species were able to penetrate the Pacific Islands region. Plants have limited seed dispersal mobility away from the parent plant and consequently rely upon a variety of dispersal vectors to transport their propagules, including both abiotic and biotic vectors. Seeds can be dispersed away from the parent plant individually or collectively, as well as dispersed in both space and time. Birds and bats swallow seeds, then regurgitate them or pass them in their faeces. Such seed dispersal has been a major mechanism of seed dispersal across ocean barriers. Other seeds may stick to the feet or feathers of birds, particularly migratory or aquatic birds, and in this way may travel long distances. Seeds of grasses, spores of algae, and the eggs of molluscs and other invertebrates commonly establish in remote areas after long journeys of such types.|$|E

[...] Adam Marsh's (c.1200–1259) treatise On <b>the</b> <b>Ebb</b> <b>and</b> <b>Flow</b> of the Sea, which was formerly attributed to Grosseteste, maintained al-Bitruji's opinion that the celestial spheres and the seas are moved by a peripheral mover whose motion weakens with distance.|$|E

500|$|Cardinal Bellarmine {{had written}} in 1615 that the Copernican system could not be defended without [...] "a true {{physical}} demonstration that the sun does not circle the earth but the earth circles the sun". Galileo considered his theory of the tides to provide the required physical proof of {{the motion of the}} earth. This theory was so important to him that he originally intended to entitle his Dialogue on the Two Chief World Systems the Dialogue on <b>the</b> <b>Ebb</b> <b>and</b> <b>Flow</b> of the Sea.

"Timewave zero" [...] is a numerological {{formula that}} purports to {{calculate}} <b>the</b> <b>ebb</b> <b>and</b> <b>flow</b> of [...] "novelty", defined as increase {{over time in}} the universe's interconnectedness, or organized complexity. Terence McKenna claimed that the universe has a teleological attractor {{at the end of}} time that increases interconnectedness. He believed this which would eventually reach a singularity of infinite complexity in 2012, at which point anything and everything imaginable would occur simultaneously. He conceived this idea over several years in the early to mid-1970s whilst using psilocybin mushrooms and DMT. The scientific community considers novelty theory to be pseudoscience.|$|E
500|$|A disjunct {{northern}} {{population of}} T. oreades grows together with T.mongaensis {{in the southern}} Monga Valley in southern New South Wales, with some hybrids reported. Crisp and Weston concluded that the two species {{for the most part}} did not hybridise there. However, a genetic study using microsatellites found there was extensive hybridisation, with much of the presumed pure T. oreades showing a close relation to T.mongaensis.

[...] "Tides" [...] opens solely with Croft and Sim's vocals, and features fading musical elements, including lock-step percussion, minor strings, an isolated guitar line, and a wavy bassline.

500|$|There {{are other}} early writers whose works can {{shed light on}} Ælle's time, though they do not mention either him or his kingdom. [...] Gildas's {{description}} {{of the state of}} Britain in his time is useful for understanding <b>the</b> <b>ebb</b> <b>and</b> <b>flow</b> of the Anglo-Saxon incursions. Procopius, a Byzantine historian, writing not long after Gildas, adds to the meagre sources on population movement by including a chapter on England in one of his works. [...] He records that the peoples of Britain—he names the English, the British, and the Frisians—were so numerous that they were migrating to the kingdom of the Franks in great numbers every year. Although this is probably a reference to Britons emigrating to Armorica to escape the Anglo-Saxons. They subsequently gave their name to the area they settled as Brittany, or la petite Bretagne (literally little Britain).|$|E
500|$|Also {{impressed}} with the song's musical moods, Ian Inglis writes: [...] "The switches between periods of pulsating rhythm and interludes of musical calm echo <b>the</b> <b>ebb</b> <b>and</b> <b>flow</b> of seduction itself. Like a painter who uses contrasting colors to create tension and movement, Harrison is... using {{the tools of the}} songwriter to create a dynamic and passionate depiction of lust and desire." [...] Madinger and Easter describe the track as [...] "an absolutely apocalyptic production" [...] and [...] "the best example of Spector running rampant with the 'Wall of Sound'". Writing in his book Phil Spector: Out of His Head, Richard Williams views [...] "Let It Down" [...] as [...] "the record's most thrilling track", adding that it [...] "picks the listener up and, in the best Spector tradition, never lets him down, building an electrifying tension between the subdued, reverential verses and the roaring chorus". In September 2014, the song appeared as Harrison's selection on the solo Beatles EP , exclusive to iTunes.|$|E
