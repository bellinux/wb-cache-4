5|$|Diamond writes <b>that</b> <b>jury</b> {{consultants}} then {{compare the}} three data sets {{to determine which}} background characteristics correlate to favorable attitudes and verdicts, and which attitudes correlate to favorable verdicts. Attorneys can then use that information to select favorable jurors, based either on prospective jurors' characteristics or whatever an attorney can learn about jurors' attitudes. This has prompted the most frequent criticism of SJS: that consultants stack juries with inexorably biased or dumb jurors; in turn, practitioners insist this is impossible and that bias can only be removed from a jury pool.|$|E
5|$|The {{trial of}} Clay Shaw {{takes place in}} 1969. Garrison {{presents}} the court with further evidence of multiple killers and dismissing the single bullet theory, and proposes a Dealey Plaza shots scenario involving three assassins who fired six total shots and framing Oswald for the murders of Kennedy and officer J. D. Tippit but the jury acquits Shaw after less than one hour of deliberation. The film reflects that members of <b>that</b> <b>jury</b> stated publicly that they believed there was a conspiracy behind the assassination, but not enough evidence to link Shaw to that conspiracy. Shaw {{died of lung cancer}} in 1974, but in 1979 Richard Helms testified that Clay Shaw had been a part-time contact of the Domestic Contacts Division of the CIA. The end credits claim that records related to the assassination will be released to the public in 2029.|$|E
5|$|On 23 April, a heavy storm {{swept the}} Eastern Atlantic, {{striking}} Warren's squadron and their prizes. Marengo was seriously damaged, losing all three masts and {{taking on a}} large quantity of water {{that had to be}} pumped overboard by the understrength crew working in shifts. Five men were drowned. Ramilles also suffered in the high winds, losing almost all her masts and rolling for some hours, completely out of control. It was only when the storm had abated <b>that</b> <b>jury</b> masts could be raised and the scattered ships could rejoin the squadron for its journey back to Britain, arriving at Spithead. Willaumez eventually returned to the North Atlantic in the early summer, passing through the Caribbean before being dispersed in a hurricane, his ships scattered across the Western Atlantic. Most eventually reached France, but the campaign had been another disaster for the French Navy, with {{less than half of the}} ships sent out returning to Brest. The loss of Marengo and Belle Poule formed a footnote to the campaign, but the defeat of Linois was widely celebrated in Britain, where both ships were commissioned into the Royal Navy under their French names. Linois was praised for his defence of his ship in the face of overwhelming British force, and historian William James, writing in 1827, considered that had Linois faced London alone he might have had the advantage. Four decades later the battle was among the actions recognised by a clasp attached to the Naval General Service Medal, awarded upon application to all British participants from London and Amazon still living in 1847.|$|E

50|$|James Wilson, {{founding}} father {{and one of}} the leading legal theorists of the day, was one of the only sources from the era <b>that</b> addressed <b>jury</b> nullification. He defended the jury's right to render a general verdict (to determine the law as well as the fact). However, in rendering that verdict, he asserted <b>that</b> <b>juries</b> must “determine those questions, as judges must determine them, according to law.” He noted that the law was “governed by precedents, and customs, and authorities, and maxims,” that are “alike obligatory upon jurors as upon judges, in deciding questions of law.” In essence, Wilson was arguing <b>that</b> <b>juries</b> must not disregard the law because laws are the result of due process by legal representatives of the people.|$|R

500|$|However, several critics {{gave the}} episode a mixed review. Myles McNutt from The A.V.

It may not have satisfyingly explored Jim’s character, but it ended with a clear statement of his role as a father, reintroducing Jenna Fischer into the cast and putting a button on that particular story development." [...] Dan Forcella from TVFanatic gave the episode a 3.5 out of 5 stars and wrote, [...] "there were definitely some ups and some downs in 'Jury Duty'." [...] However, he did praise the action of several characters, most notably Kevin and Dwight. Joseph Kratzer from WhatCulture gave the episode 3 out of 5 stars and wrote, [...] "I truly appreciate the talented writing of Aaron Shure who crafted a genuinely well-structured episode.

[...] The heirs brought suit against the government in 2006, and a federal judge ordered the government to file a forfeiture action regarding the coins. [...] The government brought such a suit in 2009; it was tried in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania beginning on July 7, 2011. [...] On July 21, 2011, a jury decided that the coins had been properly seized by the Federal government. [...] Judge Legrome D. Davis confirmed <b>that</b> <b>jury</b> verdict on August 29, 2012.

That ruling was vacated by the full court on July 28, 2015, and the case set for further argument. On August 1, 2016, the full Third Circuit ruled in favor of the government, upholding the jury verdict.

5000|$|Chief Justice Jay's {{instructions}} to the jury have attracted much interest surrounding their implications for jury nullification.

500|$|Ginsburg {{volunteered to}} write the brief for Reed v. Reed, , wherein the Supreme Court {{extended}} the protections of the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to women for the first time. She argued and won Frontiero v. Richardson, , which challenged a statute {{making it more difficult}} for a female service member to claim an increased housing allowance for her husband than for a male service member seeking the same allowance for his wife. Ginsburg argued the statute treated women as inferior, and the Supreme Court ruled 8–1 in her favor. The Court again ruled in Ginsburg's favor in Weinberger v. Wiesenfeld, , where Ginsburg represented a widower denied survivor benefits under Social Security, which permitted widows but not widowers to collect special benefits while caring for minor children. She argued it discriminated against female workers denying them the same protection as their male counterparts. Ginsburg filed an amicus brief and sat with counsel at oral argument for the case Craig v. Boren, , in which she challenged an Oklahoma statute which set different minimum drinking ages for men and women. For the first time, the Court imposed what is known as [...] "intermediate scrutiny" [...] on laws discriminating based on gender, a heightened standard of Constitutional review. Her last case as a lawyer before the Court was 1978's Duren v. Missouri, , which challenged the validity of voluntary jury duty for women as she deemed women's participation in government service as vital and <b>that</b> <b>jury</b> duty should not be optional. At the end of Ginsburg's oral presentation, then-Associate Justice William Rehnquist asked Ginsburg, [...] "You won't settle for putting Susan B. Anthony on the new dollar, then?"

2500|$|Attorney {{and author}} Mark Lane {{said that he}} interviewed several jurors after the trial.

Author and playwright James Kirkwood, who was a personal friend of Clay Shaw, said that he spoke to several jury members who denied ever speaking to Lane. Kirkwood also cast doubt on Lane's claim that the jury believed there was a conspiracy.

2500|$|The {{reference}} {{to an independent}} and impartial tribunal has also been taken as granting a measure of judicial independence to lower-court judges specializing in criminal law, judicial independence previously being a right held only by superior courts under the Constitution Act, 1867. [...] In the case Valente v. The Queen (1985), judicial independence under section 11 was held to be limited. [...] Although it would include financial security, security of tenure and some administrative independence, the Court found the standards enjoyed by higher-level judges was too high for the many tribunals covered by section 11(d). [...] In the Provincial Judges Reference (1997) expectations for judicial independence were heightened, with reference made to the preamble of the Constitution Act, 1867, which was said to imply judicial independence was an unwritten constitutional value applying to all judges in Canada. [...] The requirement of an independent and impartial tribunal applies also to juries. [...] Constitutional scholar Peter Hogg has written <b>that</b> <b>jury</b> selection under the Criminal Code would undoubtedly create an independent tribunal. [...] However, he points to R. v. Bain (1992) in which the impartiality of the jury was questioned, since the Crown had more say in selection.|$|E
