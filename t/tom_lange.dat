2500|$|Detective Ron Phillips {{testified that}} when he called Simpson in Chicago to tell him of his ex-wife's murder, Simpson sounded shocked and upset, but did not ask about how she died. Detective <b>Tom</b> <b>Lange</b> testified that Brown was {{probably}} killed first because the soles of her bare feet were clean, implying that she was struck {{down to the ground}} before any blood flowed. This was a key point that suggested Simpson might have set out to kill Brown, whereas Goldman appeared to have inadvertently stumbled upon the scene, prompting Simpson to kill him as well. In cross-examining Detective Lange, Cochran proposed two hypotheses for what happened at the murder scene. First, he suggested that one, or more, drug dealers encountered Brown while looking for her friend and house guest, Faye Resnick, an admitted cocaine abuser. In the second hypothesis, Cochran suggested that [...] "an assassin, or assassins," [...] followed Goldman to the South Bundy house to kill him.|$|E
2500|$|More {{than nine}} {{helicopters}} eventually joined the chase; {{the high degree}} of media participation caused camera signals to appear on incorrect television channels. The chase was so long that one helicopter ran out of fuel, forcing its station to ask another for a camera feed. Radio station KNX also provided live coverage of the low-speed pursuit. USC sports announcer Pete Arbogast and station producer Oran Sampson contacted former USC coach John McKay to go on the air and encourage Simpson to end the pursuit. McKay agreed and asked Simpson to pull over and turn himself in instead of committing suicide; [...] "My God, we love you, Juice. Just pull over and I'll come out and stand by you all the rest of my life", he promised. LAPD detective <b>Tom</b> <b>Lange,</b> who had previously interviewed Simpson about the murders on June 13, realized that he had Simpson's cellular phone number and called him repeatedly. A colleague hooked a tape recorder up to Lange's phone and captured a conversation between Lange and Simpson in which Lange repeatedly pleaded with Simpson to [...] "throw the gun out [...] the window" [...] {{for the sake of his}} mother and children. Simpson apologized for not turning himself in earlier that day and responded that he was [...] "the only one who deserved to get hurt" [...] and was [...] "just gonna go with Nicole." [...] Cowlings' voice is overheard in the recording (after the Bronco had arrived at Simpson's home surrounded by police) pleading with Simpson to surrender and end the chase peacefully. During the pursuit and without having a chance to hear the taped phone conversation, Simpson's friend Al Michaels interpreted his actions as an admission of guilt.|$|E

50|$|Los Angeles Police Department detectives <b>Tom</b> <b>Lange</b> and Robert Souza led {{the murder}} {{investigation}} and searched Nash's home {{a few days}} after the crime. There they found more than $1 million worth of cocaine, as well as some items stolen from the Wonderland house.|$|E
50|$|Fuhrman and his superior, Ronald Phillips, {{were the}} first detectives to arrive; Fuhrman's partner, Brad Roberts, arrived later. Fuhrman was {{familiar}} with O.J. Simpson and Nicole Brown because of the 1985 domestic violence call. Fuhrman left Brown's condominium with Ronald Phillips and lead detectives <b>Tom</b> <b>Lange</b> and Philip Vannatter, {{and they went to}} Simpson's Rockingham residence.|$|E
50|$|Holmes was {{questioned}} regarding the murders in July 1981, {{but he was}} released {{due to lack of}} evidence. He refused to cooperate with the investigation and, after spending nearly five months on the run with Dawn Schiller, Holmes was arrested in Florida on December 4, 1981, by former LAPD homicide detectives <b>Tom</b> <b>Lange</b> and Frank Tomlinson, and extradited to Los Angeles. In March 1982, Holmes was charged with personally committing all four murders. After a three-week publicized trial, Holmes was acquitted on June 26, 1982, of all charges except contempt of court. The Holmes Murder Trial was a landmark in American jurisprudence, as it was the first murder trial in America where videotape was introduced as evidence.|$|E

J. Simpson detectives <b>Tom</b> <b>Lange</b> and Philip Vannatter, as well as Judge Lance Ito, who presided over the Simpson criminal trial. LAPD’s then Chief Willie L. Williams and his predecessor, Chief Darryl F. Gates (who worked with him as a young detective), eulogized him, Williams reinstating the detective to active duty as of May 2, 1995 “That he make his final journey as a detective of the Los Angeles Police Department." ...|$|E

In 2014, Bauer guest starred in an episode of NBC's Parks and Recreation. In October 2014 Bauer started a recurring role on the Starz comedy Survivor's Remorse.

The show is written by Mike O'Malley, who is also an executive producer along with NBA star LeBron James, and stars Jessie T. Usher.

5000|$|Throughout the 18-month {{process from}} {{conception}} to completion, Edelman conducted 72 interviews for the documentary, [...] "including key {{players from the}} prosecution (Marcia Clark, Gil Garcetti and Bill Hodgman), Simpson's defense team (F. Lee Bailey, Carl E. Douglas and Barry Scheck), childhood friends of Simpson, jurors from the criminal trial, former LAPD detectives {{involved in the case}} (Mark Fuhrman and <b>Tom</b> <b>Lange)</b> and African-American civil rights activists", and people who could speak on behalf of Ron Goldman and Nicole Brown Simpson. Edelman also reached out to Simpson through a letter, which was never answered; he had also hoped to include Simpson's first wife, Marguerite, who could not be contacted, and former L.A. County district attorney Christopher Darden, who declined participation. Despite envisioning the project as a five-hour documentary, the final film was screened to ESPN Films executives at 7.5 hours in length, to which Schell said they would figure out the programming end, as they were [...] "going to give Ezra the time he needs to tell this story". The initial plan was to break the film into three parts - [...] "everything leading up to the murder and then the trial and then everything after the trial" [...] - before a five-part format was settled on.|$|E
50|$|Fuhrman {{asserts that}} {{the police and the}} {{prosecution}} made other errors that reduced the chances of a guilty verdict. For example, Fuhrman and his partner, Brad Roberts, found a bloody fingerprint on the north walkway gate of Nicole Brown Simpson's house. According to Fuhrman, at least some of it belonged to the suspect, as there was enough blood at the scene to suggest the suspect was bleeding. This was potentially critical evidence; Simpson claimed that he'd cut himself {{on the night of the}} murders but hadn't been to his ex-wife's house in a week. Had the fingerprint been tied to Simpson in any fashion it would have been a crippling, and possibly fatal, blow to his defense. It also could have contradicted the defense's allegations that Fuhrman planted the glove, since Fuhrman did not know or have reason to know that it was Simpson's blood. However, the fingerprint was destroyed at some point and was only mentioned superficially at trial. In fact, Fuhrman later discovered that Vannatter and Vannatter's partner, <b>Tom</b> <b>Lange,</b> didn't even know the fingerprint was there because they never read Fuhrman's notes. Roberts could have offered testimony to corroborate that the fingerprint was there but was never called to testify- something that rankled Fuhrman almost as much as the fact that Vannatter and Lange never read his notes. Fuhrman also claimed that Roberts could have corroborated many of his other observations, but Marcia Clark didn't call him (to avoid embarrassing Vannatter on the stand).|$|E
