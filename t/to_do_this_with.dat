25|$|Note: This {{method is}} {{also called the}} chaos game, and {{is an example of}} an {{iterated}} function system. You can start from any point outside or inside the triangle, and it would eventually form the Sierpinski Gasket with a few leftover points (if the starting point lies on the outline of the triangle, there are no leftover points). It is interesting <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>this</b> <b>with</b> pencil and paper. A brief outline is formed after placing approximately one hundred points, and detail begins to appear after a few hundred.|$|E
25|$|In March 2015, Devon Nicholson {{described}} an incident from 2006 that Bill DeMott {{was involved with}} while he was head trainer for the WWE's DSW developmental territory. Nicholson {{described an}} incident where Drew Hankinson was completely naked in the ring {{for a long period}} of time and gave naked stink faces to Ryder and Melissa Coates while DeMott held jelly donuts over their faces. The wrestlers agreed <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>this</b> (<b>with</b> the other talent encouraging them) to get out of regular training for that day. DeMott refuted the notion that it was his idea, stating that the other trainees came up with because they wanted to skip the session.|$|E
25|$|Observe {{that the}} more {{fuel-efficient}} engines can use far less fuel; their mass is almost negligible (relative to {{the mass of the}} payload and the engine itself) for some of the engines. However, note also that these require a large total amount of energy. For Earth launch, engines require a thrust to weight ratio of more than one. <b>To</b> <b>do</b> <b>this</b> <b>with</b> the ion or more theoretical electrical drives, the engine would have to be supplied with one to several gigawatts of power, equivalent to a major metropolitan generating station. From the table {{it can be seen that}} this is clearly impractical with current power sources.|$|E

25|$|Having {{surrendered}} a first innings {{deficit of}} 416, England {{now had to}} bat for two days to save the game. They were able <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>this</b> <b>with</b> considerable assistance from the weather, which ensured that half the remaining available match time was wiped out. By the time the game was determined a draw late on day 5, England had reached 251/6 – a marked improvement on the first innings. Alastair Cook had scored 118, recording England’s first and solitary century on the tour. Sri Lanka, in contrast, had scored 4. England suffered a scare when 3 wickets fell in four balls, including a first ball run out for Ravi Bopara, but they managed to avoid a defeat – which many felt they shouldn’t have. This was {{in contrast to the}} first match in Kandy, when they did deserve to escape with a draw, but didn’t.|$|E
25|$|Even {{with the}} {{addition}} of $800 million of state funds promised in 1978, {{less than half of the}} $600 million authorized in the 1967 bond issue for major construction had been spent. The MTA made improvements to tunnels, tracks, switches and signals. It had <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>this</b> <b>with</b> a smaller amount of funding than available in the past due to the fiscal crisis, and keep the subway operating 24 hours a day. However, it had a major public relations problem. As people didn't see any improvements, they assumed that crime was out of control, and for a while it was, but this assumption was maintained even during periods of reduced crime. In an attempt to alleviate the crime situation and extend the service life of rolling stock, half-length trains began running during off-peak hours. Infrastructure was in such poor condition that even the 63rd Street and Archer Avenue subway projects were threatened by 1980. The 63rd Street Line was flooded with water, while the Archer Avenue Line could barely be built past Parsons Boulevard.|$|E

[...] The video's ending was originally intended to depict archival footage of American actresses Halle Berry and Vanessa A. Williams, to promote beauty for African-American women. However, Beyoncé sent a note to Matsoukas suggesting that footage from her childhood should be interpolated {{at the end of the}} song in order to connect it to the second music video from the album, [...] "Ghost".|$|E

It originally aired on the Fox network in the United States on April 29, 2012. In the episode, the Simpson family goes on cruise after being convinced by a bored Bart. He enjoys himself on the vacation until Rowan Priddis, {{the director of the}} cruise, performs a song called [...] "Enjoy It While You Can" [...] that makes him realize the cruise is soon to be over and he has to return to his boring life.

500|$|The {{secondary}} plot line, {{about the}} auditions for New Directions soloist at Nationals, was roundly criticized.

Houston Chronicle Bobby Hankinson also hit {{on the lack of}} preparation for the upcoming competition and stated that it seemed [...] "like a very bad idea" [...] to be going without a setlist already decided on, much less with songs unwritten. He said the four audition numbers were [...] "awkwardly paced", though he thought they were [...] "fantastic"; Reiter said they [...] "stood out like glinting gems in a somewhat muddy episode". Canning and VanDerWerff also criticized the block of four songs {{in the middle of the}} episode which, as VanDerWerff put it, [...] "stops the show cold". James Poniewozik of Time was unhappy for another reason altogether: [...] "Having four people stand up and sing solos into a microphone may be music; but it ain't a musical." ...|$|E

500|$|After Bradfield {{sent her}} a demo of the album track [...] "I Don't Need Anyone", Minogue was {{dissatisfied}} with the lyrical content and re-wrote the track herself.

She found this method of writing [...] "intriguing" [...] and {{wanted to do it}} again, so she decided <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>this</b> <b>with</b> [...] "Some Kind of Bliss", writing it alongside Bradfield and Sean Moore. Minogue commented about this method, saying [...] "He took one half of one set [...] and took another half from another set of lyrics and merged them together, which I found interesting because it was something I wouldn't have done because, in my mind they're two separate things." [...] She later commented that she felt it worked together. Lyrically, the song is about her being happy and said [...] "To me the song is about being able, not necessarily shut your eyes and feel that someone is there but they way where you are close to someone [...] the ability to feel like they're with you even if they are a million miles away." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Welcome Party" [...] {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} from critics. The A.V. Club reviewer Myles McNutt wrote {{that while the}} series had two goals to perform {{by the end of}} the episode—to turn Nellie into a relatable character and break Andy and Jessica up—he felt that both plots failed in execution. He wrote that because the audience knew nothing about Jessica and that he had [...] "already given up on" [...] Nellie as a character, the episode ultimately became an unfunny' experience". He ultimately gave the episode a C. Cindy White of IGN compared the writer's attempt to humanize Nellie to the previous seasons, specifically [...] "The Dundies" [...] when the writers humanized Michael and wrote that she hoped the writers would continue <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>this</b> <b>with</b> Nellie. She also went on to praise the interaction between Jim and Pam, saying [...] "Their ability ... to communicate volumes with a few words or merely a glance demonstrates why their chemistry has been so difficult to replicate with other couples." [...] Despite her mainly positive review, she criticized the Andy and Erin subplot because she neither cared about Jessica or Andy and Erin's relationship and called the whole subplot [...] "a waste of time". She ultimately gave the episode a 7.5/10, calling it [...] "Good". Writing for New York, Lucy Teitler unfavorably compared the Andy-Erin plotline to Jim and Pam's from the early seasons of the series, writing that the romance was not able to [...] "take off, because Erin has no real agency" [...] and that the scene where Andy returned to the bachelorette party felt too superficial to reach its potential of becoming a [...] "classic" [...] Office scene.|$|E

2500|$|By 1987, Archbishop Lefebvre was 81. At that point, if Lefebvre had died, the SSPX {{would have}} become {{dependent}} upon non-SSPX bishops to ordain future priests– and Lefebvre did not regard them as properly reliable and orthodox. In June 1987, Lefebvre announced his intention to consecrate a successor to the episcopacy. He implied that he intended <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>this</b> <b>with</b> or without {{the approval of the}} Holy See. Under canons 1013 and 1382 of the Catholic Code of Canon Law, the consecration of a bishop requires papal approval. Consecration of bishops without papal approval had been condemned by Pope Pius XII in his encyclical Ad Apostolorum principis, which described the sacramental activity of bishops who had been consecrated without such approval as [...] "gravely illicit, that is, criminal and sacrilegious". The Roman authorities were unhappy with Lefebvre's plan, but they began discussions with him and the SSPX which led to the signing on 5 May 1988, of a skeleton agreement between Lefebvre and Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger, the prefect of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith and the future Pope Benedict XVI.|$|E
