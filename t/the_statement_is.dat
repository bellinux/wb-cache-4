5|$|A {{statement}} is considered falsifiable {{if there is}} an observation or a test that could be made that would demonstrate that <b>the</b> <b>statement</b> <b>is</b> false. Statements that are not falsifiable cannot be examined by scientific investigation since they permit no tests that evaluate their accuracy. Creationists such as Henry M. Morris have claimed that any observation can be fitted into the evolutionary framework, so it is impossible to demonstrate that evolution is wrong and therefore evolution is non-scientific.|$|E

25|$|The {{two sides}} are equal, so <b>the</b> <b>statement</b> <b>is</b> true for n = 0. Thus {{it has been shown}} that P(0) holds.|$|E
25|$|If a {{statement}} includes a term such that <b>the</b> <b>statement</b> <b>is</b> false if the term has no instances, then <b>the</b> <b>statement</b> <b>is</b> {{said to have}} existential import with respect to that term. It is ambiguous {{whether or not a}} universal statement of the form All A is B is to be considered as true, false, or even meaningless if there are no As. If it is considered as false in such cases, then the statement All A is B has existential import with respect to A.|$|E

25|$|Forfeiture by wrongdoing: {{the party}} against whom <b>the</b> <b>statement</b> <b>is</b> now offered (1) {{intentionally}} made the declarant unavailable; (2) {{with intent to}} prevent declarant's testimony; (3) by wrongdoing.|$|E

50|$|The appellants, NEHAWU and its branch secretary, {{denied that}} <b>the</b> <b>statements</b> <b>were</b> defamatory; in addition, they claimed {{qualified}} privilege. The court a quo, however, found that <b>the</b> <b>statements</b> <b>were</b> indeed defamatory, that qualified privilege did not cover their distribution to non-NEHAWU members, {{and that the}} appellants were liable for their failure {{to take steps to}} prevent such distribution. They appealed this decision.|$|R
5000|$|Proposed due process: A Statement, {{after being}} exposed as a Tentative Statement and revised, if necessary, by the BRAP, would be {{submitted}} to Council for consideration. Council could refer back to the BRAP. Council could pronounce, within twelve months of receipt, that <b>the</b> <b>Statement</b> <b>was</b> required (mandatory), or recommended (voluntary), or that <b>the</b> <b>Statement</b> <b>be</b> approved for publication without comment.|$|R
25|$|Axiom Five (the axiom of induction): If a {{statement}} {{is true of}} 0, and if the truth of that statement for a number implies its truth for the successor of that number, then <b>the</b> <b>statement</b> <b>is</b> true for every natural number.|$|E
25|$|A weasel word is an {{informal}} term for {{words and phrases}} aimed at creating an impression that a specific and/or meaningful statement has been made, when in fact only a vague or ambiguous claim has been communicated, enabling the specific meaning to be denied if <b>the</b> <b>statement</b> <b>is</b> challenged. A more formal term is equivocation.|$|E
25|$|In {{the first}} word geldi, the unmarked suffix -di {{indicates}} past tense. In the second word gelmiş, the suffix -miş also indicates past tense but indirectly. It may be translated into English with the added words obviously, apparently or as far as I understand. The direct past tense marker -di is unmarked (or neutral) {{in the sense that}} whether or not evidence exists supporting <b>the</b> <b>statement</b> <b>is</b> not specified.|$|E
5000|$|Republicans {{claimed that}} <b>the</b> <b>statement</b> <b>was</b> {{indicative}} of Obama's support for big government. The Obama campaign said <b>the</b> <b>statement</b> <b>was</b> {{taken out of}} context, while Romney replied that 'the context is worse than the quote'.

25|$|The {{method of}} {{infinite}} descent {{was one of}} Pierre de Fermat's favorites. This method of proof can assume several slightly different forms. For example, it might begin by showing that if a statement is true for a natural number n {{it must also be}} true for some smaller natural number m (m < n). Using mathematical induction (implicitly) with the inductive hypothesis being that <b>the</b> <b>statement</b> <b>is</b> false for all natural numbers {{less than or equal to}} m, one may conclude that the statement cannot be true for any natural number n.|$|E
25|$|The Court of Appeal {{recognized}} that the approach adopted towards fair criticism has a practical implication on the evidential burden. If fair criticism goes towards liability, the burden {{would be on the}} party alleging the contempt to prove beyond reasonable doubt that <b>the</b> <b>statement</b> <b>is</b> not fair criticism and poses a real risk of undermining public confidence in the administration of justice. Conversely, if fair criticism is a defence to an allegation of contempt, the burden would be on the alleged contemnor to show on a balance of probabilities that the statement amounts to fair criticism.|$|E
25|$|In 1900, Hilbert posed {{a famous}} list of 23 {{problems}} for the next century. The first two of these were to resolve the continuum hypothesis and prove the consistency of elementary arithmetic, respectively; the tenth was to produce a method that could decide whether a multivariate polynomial equation over the integers has a solution. Subsequent work to resolve these problems shaped the direction of mathematical logic, as did the effort to resolve Hilbert's Entscheidungsproblem, posed in 1928. This problem asked for a procedure that would decide, given a formalized mathematical statement, whether <b>the</b> <b>statement</b> <b>is</b> true or false.|$|E
5000|$|Another {{important}} aspect of defamation {{is the difference between}} fact and opinion. Statements made as [...] "facts" [...] are frequently actionable defamation. Statements of opinion or pure opinion are not actionable. Some jurisdictions decline to recognize any legal distinction between fact and opinion. To win damages in a libel case, the plaintiff must first show that <b>the</b> <b>statements</b> <b>were</b> [...] "statements of fact or mixed statements of opinion and fact" [...] and second that these <b>statements</b> <b>were</b> false. Conversely, a typical defense to defamation <b>is</b> that <b>the</b> <b>statements</b> <b>are</b> opinion, relying on opinion privilege. One of the major tests to distinguish whether a <b>statement</b> <b>is</b> fact or opinion <b>is</b> whether <b>the</b> <b>statement</b> can <b>be</b> proved true or false in a court of law. If <b>the</b> <b>statement</b> can <b>be</b> proved true or false, then, on that basis, the case will be heard by a jury to determine whether it is true or false. If <b>the</b> <b>statement</b> cannot <b>be</b> proved true or false, the court may dismiss the libel case without it ever going to a jury to find facts in the case.|$|R
