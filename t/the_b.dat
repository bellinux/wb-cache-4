5|$|A B cell {{identifies}} pathogens when antibodies on {{its surface}} bind to a specific foreign antigen. This antigen/antibody complex is taken up by <b>the</b> <b>B</b> cell and processed by proteolysis into peptides. <b>The</b> <b>B</b> cell then displays these antigenic peptides {{on its surface}} MHC class II molecules. This combination of MHC and antigen attracts a matching helper T cell, which releases lymphokines and activates <b>the</b> <b>B</b> cell. As the activated B cell then begins to divide, its offspring (plasma cells) secrete millions of copies of the antibody that recognizes this antigen. These antibodies circulate in blood plasma and lymph, bind to pathogens expressing the antigen and mark them for destruction by complement activation or for uptake and destruction by phagocytes. Antibodies can also neutralize challenges directly, by binding to bacterial toxins or by interfering with the receptors that viruses and bacteria use to infect cells.|$|E

The construction of <b>the</b> <b>B</b> Station brought the site's generating capacity up to 509 megawatts (MW), making it the third largest generating site in the UK at the time, providing a fifth of London's electricity needs (with the remainder supplied by 28 smaller stations).

5|$|Antibodies are {{secreted}} by B {{cells of}} the adaptive immune system, mostly by differentiated B cells called plasma cells. Antibodies can occur in two physical forms, a soluble form that is secreted from the cell to be free in the blood plasma, and a membrane-bound form that {{is attached to the}} surface of a B cell and {{is referred to as the}} B-cell receptor (BCR). The BCR is found only on the surface of B cells and facilitates the activation of these cells and their subsequent differentiation into either antibody factories called plasma cells or memory B cells that will survive in the body and remember that same antigen so <b>the</b> <b>B</b> cells can respond faster upon future exposure. In most cases, interaction of <b>the</b> <b>B</b> cell with a T helper cell is necessary to produce full activation of <b>the</b> <b>B</b> cell and, therefore, antibody generation following antigen binding. Soluble antibodies are released into the blood and tissue fluids, as well as many secretions to continue to survey for invading microorganisms.|$|E

5|$|Clarinets {{have the}} largest pitch range of common woodwinds. The {{intricate}} key organization that makes this possible can make the playability of some passages awkward. The bottom of the clarinet's written range {{is defined by the}} keywork on each instrument, standard keywork schemes allowing a low E on the common B clarinet. The lowest concert pitch depends on the transposition of the instrument in question. The nominal highest note of <b>the</b> <b>B</b> clarinet is a semitone higher than the highest note of the oboe. Since the clarinet has a wider range of notes, the lowest note of <b>the</b> <b>B</b> clarinet is significantly deeper (a minor or major sixth) than the lowest note of the oboe.|$|E
