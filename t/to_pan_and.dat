25|$|The {{spring at}} Banias {{initially}} originated {{in a large}} cave carved out of a sheer cliff face which was gradually lined {{with a series of}} shrines. The temenos (sacred precinct) included in its final phase a temple placed {{at the mouth of the}} cave, courtyards for rituals, and niches for statues. It was constructed on an elevated, 80m long natural terrace along the cliff which towered over the north of the city. A four-line inscription at the base of one of the niches relates <b>to</b> <b>Pan</b> <b>and</b> Echo, the mountain nymph, and was dated to 87 BCE.|$|E

2500|$|Parian marble, {{which is}} white and {{translucent}} (semi-transparent), with a coarse grain and a very beautiful texture, was the chief source of wealth for the island. The celebrated marble quarries lie on the northern {{side of the mountain}} anciently known as Marathi (afterwards Capresso), a little below a former convent of St Mina. The marble, which was exported from the 6th century BC onwards, was used by Praxiteles and other great Greek sculptors. It was obtained by means of subterranean quarries driven horizontally or at a descending angle into the rock. The marble thus quarried by lamplight was given the name of Lychnites, Lychneus (from lychnos, a lamp), or Lygdos. Several of these tunnels are still to be seen. At the entrance to {{one of them is a}} bas-relief dedicated <b>to</b> <b>Pan</b> <b>and</b> the nymphs. Several attempts to work the marble have been made in modern times, but it has not been exported in any great quantities. [...] The major part of the remaining white marble is now state-owned and, like its Pentelic counterpart, is only used for archaeological restorations.|$|E

How wild the climate of this pine region is, you may judge from the pieces in the note below[22] out of Colonel Leake's diary in {59} crossing the Mænalian range in spring.

60|$|Pan espied {{the girl}} Louise {{before she had}} become aware of his presence. She {{appeared}} to be more decently clad, a circumstance that greatly added to her charm, in his opinion. Curiously he studied her. Women represented more to Pan than to most men he had had opportunity to meet or observe. He never forgot that they belonged to the same sex as his mother. So it was natural he had compassion for this unsexed dance-hall, gambling-lure girl. She was pretty in a wild sort of way, dissolute, abandoned, yet not in any sense weak. A terrible havoc showed in her face for anyone with eyes to see beneath the surface. Pan noted a strange restlessness in her that at first he imagined was the seeking instinct of women of her class. But it was only {{that she could not}} sit or stand still. Her hawklike eyes did not miss anyone there, and finally they located him. She came around the tables up <b>to</b> <b>Pan,</b> <b>and</b> took hold of his arm.|$|E
60|$|The {{whole world}} is {{certainly}} heading for a great simplicity, not deliberately, but rather inevitably. It is not a mere fashion of false innocence, {{like that of the}} French aristocrats before the Revolution, who built an altar <b>to</b> <b>Pan,</b> <b>and</b> who taxed the peasantry for the enormous expenditure which is needed in order to live the simple life of peasants. The simplicity towards which the world is driving is the necessary outcome of all our systems and speculations and of our deep and continuous contemplation of things. For the universe is like everything in it; {{we have to look at}} it repeatedly and habitually before we see it. It is only when we have seen it for the hundredth time that we see it for the first time. The more consistently things are contemplated, the more they tend to unify themselves and therefore to simplify themselves. The simplification of anything is always sensational. Thus monotheism is the most sensational of things: it is as if we gazed long at a design full of disconnected objects, and, suddenly, with a stunning thrill, they came together into a huge and staring face.|$|E
6000|$|... ...Your letter greatly {{moves and}} regales me. Fully do I enter into your joy of sequestration, and your bliss of removal from this scene of heated turmoil and dusty despair--which, however, re-awaits you! Never mind; sink {{up to your}} neck into the brimming basin of nature and peace, and teach yourself--by which I mean let your {{grandmother}} teach you--that with each revolving year you will need and make more piously these precious sacrifices <b>to</b> <b>Pan</b> <b>and</b> the Muses. History eternally repeats itself, and I remember well how in the old London years (of my old London--this isn't that one) I used to clutch at these chances of obscure flight and at the possession, less frustrated, of my soul, my senses and my hours. So keep it up; I miss you, little as I see you even when here (for I feel you more than I see you;) but I surrender you at whatever cost to the beneficent powers. Therefore I rejoice in the getting on of your work--how splendidly copious your flow; and am much interested in what you tell me of your readings and your literary emotions. These latter indeed--or some of them, as you express them, I don't think I fully share. At least when you ask me if I don't feel Dostoieffsky's [...] "mad jumble, that flings things down in a heap," [...] nearer truth and beauty than the picking and composing that you instance in Stevenson, I reply with emphasis that I feel nothing of the sort, and that the older I grow and the more I go the more sacred to me do picking and composing become--though I naturally don't limit myself to Stevenson's kind of the same. Don't let any one persuade you--there are plenty of ignorant and fatuous duffers {{to try to do}} it--that strenuous selection and comparison are not the very essence of art, and that Form is [not] substance to that degree that there is absolutely no substance without it. Form alone takes, and holds and preserves, substance--saves it from the welter of helpless verbiage that we swim in as in a sea of tasteless tepid pudding, and that makes one ashamed of an art capable of such degradations. Tolstoi and D. are fluid puddings, though not tasteless, because the amount of their own minds and souls in solution in the broth gives it savour and flavour, thanks to the strong, rank quality of their genius and their experience. But {{there are all sorts of}} things to be said of them, and in particular that we see how great a vice is their lack of composition, their defiance of economy and architecture, directly they are emulated and imitated; then, as subjects of emulation, models, they quite give themselves away. There is nothing so deplorable as a work of art with a leak in its interest; and there is no such leak of interest as through commonness of form. Its opposite, the found (because the sought-for) form is the absolute citadel and tabernacle of interest. But what a lecture I am reading you--though a very imperfect one--which you have drawn upon yourself (as moreover it was quite right you should.) But no matter--I shall go for you again--as soon as I find you in a lone corner....|$|E

60|$|Now Chiron {{delineated}} σχηματα ολυμπου the Asterisms, as {{the ancient}} Author of Gigantomachia, cited by [72] Clemens Alexandrinus informs us: for Chiron was a practical Astronomer, {{as may be}} there understood also of his daughter Hippo: and Musæus, the son of Eumolpus and master of Orpheus, {{and one of the}} Argonauts, [73] made a Sphere, and is reputed the first among the Greeks who made one: and the Sphere it self shews that it was delineated in the time of the Argonautic expedition; for that expedition is delineated in the Asterisms, together with several other ancienter Histories of the Greeks, and without any thing later. There's the golden RAM, the ensign of the Vessel in which Phryxus fled to Colchis; the BULL with brazen hoofs tamed by Jason; and the TWINS, CASTOR and POLLUX, two of the Argonauts, with the SWAN of Leda their mother. There's the Ship ARGO, and HYDRUS the watchful Dragon; with Medea's CUP, and a RAVEN upon its Carcass, the Symbol of Death. There's CHIRON the master of Jason, with his ALTAR and SACRIFICE. There's the Argonaut HERCULES with his DART and VULTURE falling down; and the DRAGON, CRAB and LION, whom he slew; and the HARP of the Argonaut Orpheus. All these relate to the Argonauts. There's ORION the son of Neptune, or as some say, the grandson of Minos, with his DOGS, and HARE, and RIVER, and SCORPION. There's the story of Perseus in the Constellations of PERSEUS, ANDROMEDA, CEPHEUS, CASSIOPEA and CETUS: That of Callisto, and her son Arcas, in URSA MAJOR and ARCTOPHYLAX: That of Icareus and his daughter Erigone in BOOTES, PLAUSTRUM and VIRGO. URSA MINOR relates to one of the Nurses of Jupiter, AURIGA to Erechthonius, OPHIUCHUS to Phorbas, SAGITTARIUS to Crolus the son of the Nurse of the Muses, CAPRICORN <b>to</b> <b>Pan,</b> <b>and</b> AQUARIUS to Ganimede. There's Ariadne's CROWN, Bellerophon's HORSE, Neptune's DOLPHIN, Ganimede's EAGLE, Jupiter's GOAT with her KIDS, Bacchus's ASSES, and the FISHES of Venus and Cupid, and their Parent the SOUTH FISH. These with DELTOTON, are the old Constellations mentioned by Aratus: and they all relate to the Argonauts and their Contemporaries, and to Persons one or two Generations older: and nothing later than that Expedition was delineated there Originally. ANTINOUS and COMA BERENICES are novel. The Sphere seems therefore to have been formed by Chiron and Musæus, {{for the use of the}} Argonauts: for the Ship Argo was the first long ship built by the Greeks. Hitherto they had used round vessels of burden, and kept within sight of the shore; and now, upon an Embassy to several Princes upon the coasts of the Euxine and Mediterranean Seas, [74] by the dictates of the Oracle, and consent of the Princes of Greece, the Flower of Greece were to sail with Expedition through the deep, in a long Ship with Sails, and guide their Ship by the Stars. The People of the Island Corcyra [75] attributed the invention of the Sphere to Nausicaa, the daughter of Alcinous, King of the Pheaces in that Island: and it's most probable that she had it from the Argonauts, who [76] in their return home sailed to that Island, and made some stay there with her father. So then in the time of the Argonautic Expedition, the Cardinal points of the Equinoxes and Solstices were in the middles of the Constellations of Aries, Cancer, Chelæ, and Capricorn.|$|E
