5|$|There's a Riot Goin' On is {{the fifth}} studio album by American band Sly and the Family Stone. It was {{released}} on November 20, 1971, by Epic Records. The album was recorded during 1970 and 1971 at Record Plant Studios in Sausalito, California, with sessions dominated by band frontman Sly Stone {{during a period of}} drug use and intra-group tension. There's a Riot Goin' On embraced a darker and more challenging sound than <b>the</b> <b>optimistic</b> psychedelic soul style of the group's previous records, making use of hard funk rhythms, primitive drum machines, excessive overdubbing, and unconventional mixing techniques. The album's planned title was Africa Talks to You, but it was retitled in response to Marvin Gaye's album What's Going On (1971), released five months before.|$|E
5|$|Despite <b>the</b> <b>optimistic</b> Australian {{assessments}} of Viet Cong capability, {{rather than having}} left Phuoc Tuy the communists were more likely reinforcing and consolidating in preparation for future operations, avoiding battle with the Australians {{in order to preserve}} their strength. Regardless, D445 Battalion had suffered heavy casualties and posed a diminished threat, while the headquarters of the Viet Cong 5th Division was located near the northern border, west of the May Tao mountains, with its fighting formations widely dispersed. The Viet Cong 275th Regiment was reported to have moved north to War Zone D for retraining and refitting, and the Viet Cong 274th Regiment had moved from its scattered locations in the north-west Hat Dich to replace it in the north-east of the province, and was now operating in unfamiliar terrain. Meanwhile, casualties, illness and poor local recruitment meant they were now largely reliant on reinforcements from North Vietnam. Unsure of the next move, the Viet Cong 5th Division adopted a cautious posture, with only the 1st Battalion, 275th Regiment remaining in the May Tao mountains while the 274th Regiment dispersed east of Route 2 {{for the remainder of the}} month.|$|E
5|$|Due to poor intelligence, the British {{were told}} to expect only limited {{resistance}} from German reserve forces. A serious challenge to their operation was not expected and many men believed that their work {{would lead to the}} ending of the war. Some—anticipating a period of occupation in Germany—packed leisure equipment in their kit or in the sea tail. <b>The</b> <b>optimistic</b> mood prior to the operation would have tragic consequences however. Frederick Browning's intelligence officer—Major Brian Urquhart—obtained information from the 21st Army Group in Belgium and Dutch resistance that German armour was present around Arnhem. This was backed up with aerial reconnaissance that he ordered to be flown. Browning however was dismissive and ordered his chief medical officer to have Urquhart sent on sick leave. In fact, SHAEF was aware that there were almost certainly two Panzer divisions at Arnhem but with the operation looming chose to ignore them. Such information would have been gleaned from Ultra intercepts that the First Allied Airborne Army was not privy to and therefore could not act upon themselves.|$|E

5|$|The NRRF {{arrived in}} Archangel on 5 June 1919 aboard the SS Porto and SS Stephen and almost {{immediately}} moved up the Dvina River to a camp at Osinova. There they began training for an offensive up the rail and river systems of the Dvina. This offensive was designed to push the Bolshevik forces of the Red Army back while the Allies withdrew without interference. A secondary aim was to leave the White Russian forces in a better military position, in <b>the</b> <b>optimistic</b> hope they could subsequently hold their own. Meanwhile, {{with the arrival of}} the NRRF, the survivors of the earlier NREF were subsequently evacuated. Activity during this period also included small-scale patrol and ambush operations around Troitska to the south in an attempt to keep the Bolsheviks off balance, as well as to provide the White Russian forces with the motivation to fight. Both sides had a small air arm, and the British established a makeshift airfield at Bakaritsa, near Archangel. Later in the campaign Sopwiths from France were used from a strip at Obozerskaya. The allies soon established air-superiority, shooting down a number of Bolshevik aircraft. At least one Australian—Ira Jones—is known to have served with the British Royal Air Force in North Russia.|$|E
25|$|Studies {{have shown}} {{that it is very}} {{difficult}} to eliminate <b>the</b> <b>optimistic</b> bias; however, some people believe that trying to reduce <b>the</b> <b>optimistic</b> bias will encourage people to adapt to health-protective behaviors. Some researchers suggest that <b>the</b> <b>optimistic</b> bias cannot be reduced, and that by trying to reduce <b>the</b> <b>optimistic</b> bias the end result was generally even more optimistically biased. In a study of four different tests to reduce <b>the</b> <b>optimistic</b> bias, researchers found that regardless of the attempts to reduce the bias, through lists of risk factors, participants perceiving themselves as inferior to others, participants asked to think of high-risk individuals, and giving attributes of why they were at risk, all increased the bias rather than decreased it. Although studies have tried to reduce <b>the</b> <b>optimistic</b> bias through reducing distance, overall, <b>the</b> <b>optimistic</b> bias still remains.|$|E
25|$|A {{meta-analysis}} {{reviewing the}} relationship between <b>the</b> <b>optimistic</b> bias and perceived control found {{that a number of}} moderators contribute to this relationship. In previous research, participants from the United States generally had higher levels of optimistic bias relating to perceived control than those of other nationalities. Students also showed larger levels of <b>the</b> <b>optimistic</b> bias than non-students. The format of the study also demonstrated differences in {{the relationship between}} perceived control and <b>the</b> <b>optimistic</b> bias: direct methods of measurement suggested greater perceived control and greater optimistic bias as compared to indirect measures of the bias. <b>The</b> <b>optimistic</b> bias is strongest in situations where an individual needs to rely heavily on direct action and responsibility of situations.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} ill-posed bilevel programs, i. e., {{problems}} admitting multiple lower-level solutions for some upper-level parameters. Many publications have {{been devoted to}} <b>the</b> standard <b>optimistic</b> case of this problem, where the difficulty is essentially moved from the objective function to the feasible set. This new problem is simpler {{but there is no}} guaranty to obtain local optimal solutions for <b>the</b> original <b>optimistic</b> problem by this process. Considering the intrinsic non-convexity of bilevel programs, computing local optimal solutions is the best one can hope to get in most cases. To achieve this goal, we start by establishing an equivalence between <b>the</b> original <b>optimistic</b> problem an a certain set-valued optimization problem. Next, we develop optimality conditions for the latter problem and show that they generalize all the results currently known in <b>the</b> literature on <b>optimistic</b> bilevel optimization. Our approach is then extended to multiobjective bilevel optimization, and completely new results are derived for problems with vector-valued upper- and lower-level objective functions. Numerical implementations of the results of this paper are provided on some examples, in order to demonstrate how <b>the</b> original <b>optimistic</b> problem can be solved in practice, by means of a special set-valued optimization problem...|$|R
25|$|Although {{research}} {{has suggested that}} {{it is very difficult to}} eliminate the bias, some factors may help in closing the gap of <b>the</b> <b>optimistic</b> bias between an individual and their target risk group. First, by placing the comparison group closer to the individual, <b>the</b> <b>optimistic</b> bias can be reduced: studies found that when individuals were asked to make comparisons between themselves and close friends, there was almost no difference in the likelihood of an event occurring. Additionally, actually experiencing an event leads to a decrease in <b>the</b> <b>optimistic</b> bias. While this only applies to events with prior experience, knowing the previously unknown will result in less optimism of it not occurring.|$|E
25|$|In health, <b>the</b> <b>optimistic</b> bias {{tends to}} prevent {{individuals}} from taking on preventative measures for good health. Therefore, researchers {{need to be}} aware of <b>the</b> <b>optimistic</b> bias and the ways it can prevent people from taking precautionary measures in life choices. For example, people who underestimate their comparative risk of heart disease know less about heart disease, and even after reading an article with more information, are still less concerned about risk of heart disease. Because <b>the</b> <b>optimistic</b> bias can be a strong force in decision-making, it is important to look at how risk perception is determined and how this will result in preventative behaviors. Risk perceptions are particularly important for individual behaviors, such as exercise, diet, and even sunscreen use.|$|E

25|$|The {{opposite}} of optimism bias is pessimism bias (or pessimistic bias), because {{the principles of}} <b>the</b> <b>optimistic</b> bias continue to be in effect in situations where individuals regard themselves as worse off than others.

25|$|The {{estimates}} of likelihood associated with <b>the</b> <b>optimistic</b> bias {{are based on}} how closely an event matches a person's overall idea of the specific event. Some researchers suggest that the representativeness heuristic is a reason for <b>the</b> <b>optimistic</b> bias: individuals tend to think in stereotypical categories rather than about their actual targets when making comparisons. For example, when drivers are asked {{to think about a}} car accident, {{they are more likely to}} associate a bad driver, rather than just the average driver. Individuals compare themselves with the negative elements that come to mind, rather than an overall accurate comparison between them and another driver. Additionally, when individuals were asked to compare themselves towards friends, they chose more vulnerable friends based on the events they were looking at. Individuals generally chose a specific friend based on whether they resemble a given example, rather than just an average friend. People find examples that relate directly to what they are asked, resulting in representativeness heuristics.|$|E
