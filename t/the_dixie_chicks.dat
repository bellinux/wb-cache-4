5000|$|<b>The</b> {{country group}} <b>Dixie</b> <b>Chicks</b> covered [...] "Landslide" [...] on their 2002 album Home {{and it was}} {{released}} September 2, 2002 as the album's second single.

It became <b>the</b> <b>Dixie</b> Chicks' only number 1 single (to date) on the adult contemporary chart. Lead singer Natalie Maines said she was attracted, in part, to the song because she was then the same age that Nicks was when she initially performed it.

5000|$|The {{song was}} written in 1995 {{by two of the}} founders of <b>the</b> {{original}} <b>Dixie</b> <b>Chicks</b> band, <b>the</b> Erwin sisters, who were not strangers to writing music and performing (they are now known as Martie Maguire and Emily Robison). Robison wrote most of the song, and Maguire supplied the bridge. It is a very autobiographical song, about the breakup of Robison's and Maguire's parents and their subsequent divorce. In one interview, when asked about it, Robison said that their parents generally [...] "sweep it under the rug", saying, [...] "They know it's about them, but whispers we never talk about it. laughs They don't want to bring it up because they're still weird around each other.

At the first concert on the tour, the group received a positive reception. Held in Greenville, South Carolina, on May 1, it was attended by a sell-out crowd of 15,000 (tickets {{for most of the}} shows had gone on sale before the controversy erupted). The women arrived prepared to face opposition—and Maines invited those who had come to boo to do so—but the crowd erupted mostly in cheers. The degree of hatred directed toward the Chicks included a specific death threat against Maines in Dallas that led to a police escort to the show of July 6 and from the show directly to the airport.|$|E
25|$|Female {{artists such}} as Reba McEntire, Patty Loveless, Faith Hill, Martina McBride, Deana Carter, LeAnn Rimes, Mindy McCready, Lorrie Morgan, Shania Twain, and Mary Chapin Carpenter all {{released}} platinum-selling albums in the 1990s. <b>The</b> <b>Dixie</b> <b>Chicks</b> {{became one of the}} most popular country bands in the 1990s and early 2000s. Their 1998 debut album Wide Open Spaces went on to become certified 12x platinum while their 1999 album Fly went on to become 10x platinum. After their third album, Home, was released in 2003, the band made political news in part because of lead singer Natalie Maines's comments disparaging then-President George W. Bush while the band was overseas (Maines stated that she and her bandmates were ashamed to be from the same state as Bush, who had just commenced the Iraq War a few days prior). The comments caused a rift between the band and the country music scene, and the band's fourth (and most recent) album, 2006's Taking the Long Way, took a more rock-oriented direction; the album was commercially successful overall but largely ignored among country audiences. After Taking the Long Way, the band broke up for a decade (with two of its members continuing as the Court Yard Hounds) before embarking on a reunion tour in 2016.|$|E
