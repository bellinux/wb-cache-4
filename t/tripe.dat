Harira soup in Marrakesh typically includes lamb with a blend of chickpeas, lentils, vermicelli, and tomato paste, seasoned with coriander, spices and parsley. Kefta (mince meat), liver in crépinette, merguez and <b>tripe</b> stew are commonly sold at the stalls of Jemaa el-Fnaa.|$|E

A fiberglass egg was used so that actor John Hurt could shine his light on it and see movement inside, which was provided by Ridley Scott fluttering his hands inside the egg while wearing rubber gloves.

5|$|The cuisine of Rwanda {{is based}} on local staple foods {{produced}} by subsistence agriculture such as bananas, plantains (known as ibitoke), pulses, sweet potatoes, beans, and cassava (manioc). Many Rwandans do not eat meat {{more than a few}} times a month. For those who live near lakes and have access to fish, tilapia is popular. The potato, thought to have been introduced to Rwanda by German and Belgian colonialists, is very popular. Ubugari (or umutsima) is a paste made from cassava or maize and water to form a porridge-like consistency that is eaten throughout the African Great Lakes. Isombe is made from mashed cassava leaves and served with dried fish. Lunch is usually a buffet known as mélange, consisting of the above staples and sometimes meat. Brochettes are the most popular food when eating out in the evening, usually made from goat but sometimes <b>tripe,</b> beef, or fish. In rural areas, many bars have a brochette seller responsible for tending and slaughtering the goats, skewering and barbecuing the meat, and serving it with grilled bananas. Milk, particularly in a fermented yoghurt form called ikivuguto, is a common drink throughout the country. Other drinks include a traditional beer called urwagwa, made from sorghum or bananas, which features in traditional rituals and ceremonies. The major drinks manufacturer in Rwanda is Bralirwa, which was established in the 1950s and is now listed on the Rwandan Stock Exchange. Bralirwa manufactures soft drink products from The Coca-Cola Company, under license, including Coca-Cola, Fanta, and Sprite, and a range of beers including Primus, Mützig, Amstel, and Turbo King. In 2009 a new brewery, Brasseries des Mille Collines (BMC) opened, manufacturing Skol beer and a local version known as Skol Gatanu; BMC is now owned by Belgian company Unibra. East African Breweries also operate in the country, importing Guinness, Tusker, and Bell, as well as whisky and spirits.|$|E
25|$|The broth for {{the dish}} {{can be either}} a mixture of two broths, made from beef <b>tripe</b> and brisket, respectively, or gomtang, a thin soup with a rich flavor made by {{simmering}} beef bones for a long time. If choosing the first type, the beef <b>tripe</b> and brisket have to be boiled separately because beef <b>tripe</b> has strong flavor that can affect the brisket broth and the meat. To make the beef <b>tripe</b> broth, cleaned beef <b>tripe,</b> onions, scallions, garlic, and ginger are placed {{in a large pot}} with a large amount of water and boiled until thoroughly cooked. Likewise, the brisket broth is prepared using the same method, using the same secondary ingredients to remove any bad odors that might persist. After that, both broths are chilled, and any fat floating on the surface is skimmed off. The cooked brisket is cut into bite-sized pieces, while the yang and gopchang are cut into long, diagonal strips. The boiled beef <b>tripe</b> and brisket are marinated with seasonings and kneaded for a long time.|$|E

40|$|Para se entender o papel de cada planta na ecologia de <b>tripes,</b> dois principais critérios precisam ser quantificados: a regularidade {{temporal}} em que os indivíduos são encontrados em uma planta e sua abundância em uma determinada planta relativamente a outras. A escolha de plantas representativas pode fornecer informações que permitam definir padrões temporais de ocorrência e avaliar a importância de fatores ambientais na comunidade destes insetos. Neste contexto, plantas que apresentem floração seqüencial podem prover elementos a respeito da importância de cada hospedeiro em abrigar populações de <b>tripes</b> ao longo do ano. Este estudo teve o objetivo de testar a hipótese de que malpighiáceas com floração seqüencial são responsáveis pela manutenção de <b>tripes</b> no decorrer do ano, assumindo a premissa que <b>tripes</b> migram de planta em planta de acordo com a fenologia de floração. O estudo foi realizado em uma área de Cerrado sentido restrito em Uberlândia, Minas Gerais, Brasil. As plantas estudadas foram Banisteriopsis malifolia, B. campestris, B. laevifolia, Byrsonima intermedia e Peixotoa tomentosa. As coletas foram realizadas de março de 2008 a fevereiro de 2009. Foram encontradas 19 espécies de <b>tripes</b> distribuídas em oito gêneros e três famílias Phlaeothripidae, Thripidae e Heterothripidae, perfazendo 3788 (5. 61 ± 6. 49, X ± 1 SD) indivíduos nas 675 flores analisadas. Testes de fenologia mostraram que todas as cinco malpighiáceas apresentaram floração seqüencial, o que permitiu aos <b>tripes</b> migrarem entre as plantas e encontrarem alimento e abrigo o ano todo. A planta com maior abundância de <b>tripes</b> foi P. tomentosa, seguida por B. laevifolia, no entanto, a diversidade foi maior em B. malifolia. As únicas espécies de <b>tripes</b> presentes em todas as plantas e passíveis de migrar dependendo da fenologia de floração foram Frankliniella condei, Scutothrips nudus, Frankliniella sp. 1. e Heterothrips peixotoa. A riqueza e diversidade encontradas nas malpighiáceas são umas das maiores já registradas para a ocorrência de <b>tripes</b> em plantas relacionadas taxonomicamente e isso se deve ao aspecto conservativo das flores que fornecem tanto alimento quanto proteção contra predadores. Este estudo mostra que malpighiáceas com floração seqüencial têm um importante papel na manutenção da diversidade de <b>tripes,</b> atuando como um recurso natural que auxilia na sobrevivência e diversificação destes insetos no cerrado brasileiro. To {{understand the}} role of each plant species in the ecology of thrips, two principal criteria need to be quantified: the regularity with which individuals are found on a plant species over time, and their abundance on that particular plant species relative to other ones. The choice of representative plants may supply subsidies to define temporary patterns and to evaluate the importance of environmental factors on the community of these insects. In this context sequential flowering plants can provide insightful information {{about the importance of}} each host in supporting thrips populations along the year. This study aimed to test the hypothesis that Malpighiaceae sequential flowering is responsible for the maintenance of thrips throughout the year, assuming the premise that thrips migrate from different plants according to the flowering phenology. Fieldwork was carried out from March 2007 to February 2009 at a strictu sensu Cerrado area in Uberlândia, Minas Gerais State, Brazil. The plants studied comprised Banisteriopsis malifolia, B. campestris, B. laevifolia, Byrsonima intermedia, and Peixotoa tomentosa. We found a total of 19 species of thrips in eight genera distributed in the three families Phlaeothripidae, Thripidae and Heterothripidae. Phenological analysis showed that the five Malpighiaceae species studied presented sequential flowering, enabling thrips to migrate from plants and to find food and shelter along the year. The plant which presented more thrips was P. tomentosa, followed by B. laevifolia whereas the diversity was higher in B. malifolia. The only thrips species present in all plants and likely to migrate from hosts according flowering phenology were Frankliniella condei, Scutothrips nudus, Frankliniella sp. 1 and Heterothrips peixotoa. The richness and diversity recorded are the highest ever sampled for thrips occurrence in a group of related taxonomic plants, because the conservative aspect of Malpighiaceae flowers provide food resources and protection against predators. This study showed that sequential flowering Malpighiaceae {{plays an important role in}} the maintenance of thrips diversity, being an important natural resource to help in the survivorship and diversification of these insects in Brazilian Savanna...|$|R

The better cuts of meat went to aristocracy and the merchant class; poorer Parisians ate mutton and pork, sausages, andouilles, brains, <b>tripe,</b> salted pork, other inexpensive cuts.
