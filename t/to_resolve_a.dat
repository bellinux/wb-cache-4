5|$|Bigfin reef squids and {{the common}} octopus (Octopus vulgaris) were studied <b>to</b> <b>resolve</b> <b>a</b> century-long debate over whether {{cephalopods}} can hear. Unlike fishes, cephalopods do not possess air-filled swim bladders, which might amplify sound waves travelling in water. The results were published in 2009. It showed that bigfin reef squids and octopuses utilise their statocysts for detecting vibrations, an organ primarily used for maintaining spatial orientation. The common octopus can hear sounds between 400Hz and 1000Hz. Bigfin reef squids have a slightly better hearing range of 400Hz to 1500Hz. Both hear best at a frequency of 600Hz. Relatively, their hearing is comparable to prawns and some other invertebrates but is less sensitive than that of most fishes.|$|E
5|$|During {{the second}} half of Crusader reign in Nablus, Muslim forces {{launched}} incursions to regain control of the city. In 1137, Arab and Turkish troops stationed in Damascus raided Nablus, killing many Christians and burning down the city's churches. However, they were unsuccessful in retaking the city. Queen Melisende of Jerusalem resided in Nablus from 1150 to 1161, after she was granted control over the city in order <b>to</b> <b>resolve</b> <b>a</b> dispute with her son Baldwin III. Crusaders began building Christian institutions in Nablus, including a church dedicated to the Passion and Resurrection of Jesus, and in 1170 they erected a hospice for pilgrims.|$|E

5|$|The Supreme Court {{noted that}} the Fifth Circuit agreed with Abramski's claim that falsifying the answer to Question 11.a is not {{considered}} material, if the true-buyer can legally buy and possess the gun. The Supreme Court granted certiorari <b>to</b> <b>resolve</b> <b>a</b> split between the circuit courts, even though Abramski's defense had changed, and he now claimed {{that the answer to}} Question 11.a is never material. Various parties filed amicus briefs supporting either side. Parties supporting Abramski included the National Rifle Association Civil Rights Defense Fund, and West Virginia and 25 other states, while others, like the Brady Center to Prevent Gun Violence, Hawaii and 8 other states (plus the District of Columbia), filed amicus briefs supporting Abramski's conviction.|$|E
5|$|His injury {{problems}} {{started as}} early as 1980, when he was 15 years old and saw Glentoran's physio Bobby McGregor <b>to</b> <b>resolve</b> <b>a</b> groin strain; Whiteside said that the highly physical massage he was subjected to damaged his pelvis and robbed him of his natural pace. His lack of pace was later seen as the one weakness in his game. Six weeks into his apprenticeship, in July 1981, and an innocuous looking challenge by a Preston North End player in an 'A' team game saw Whiteside requiring an operation on his right knee. Had the injury occurred {{a couple of years}} later he would have been able to have pioneering keyhole surgery, which could potentially have saved his career. After a seven-month lay-off and a further operation to remove cartilage, he returned to fitness in January 1982. He had to adapt his playing style to compensate for his damaged knee and pelvis, and developed well under youth team coach Eric Harrison.|$|E

5|$|In 1445, Casimir, the Grand Duke of Lithuania, {{was asked}} to assume the Polish throne vacated upon {{the death of his}} brother Władysław. Casimir was a tough {{negotiator}} and did not accept the Polish nobility's conditions for his election. He finally arrived in Poland and was crowned in 1447 on his own terms. His assumption of the Crown of Poland freed Casimir from the control that the Lithuanian oligarchy had imposed on him; in the Vilnius Privilege of 1447, he declared the Lithuanian nobility to have equal rights with Polish szlachta. In time, Casimir was able to wrest power from Cardinal Oleśnicki and his group. He replaced their influence with a power base built on the younger middle nobility. Casimir was able <b>to</b> <b>resolve</b> <b>a</b> conflict with the pope and the local Church hierarchy over the right to fill vacant bishop positions in his favor.|$|E
5|$|The Tennant Canal was a {{development}} of the Glan-y-wern Canal, which was built across Crymlyn Bog to transport coal from a colliery on its northern edge to a creek on the River Neath called Red Jacket Pill. It closed after 20 years, but was enlarged and extended by George Tennant in 1818, to provide a navigable link from the River Neath to the River Tawe at Swansea docks. In order to increase trade, he built an extension to Aberdulais basin, where it linked to the Neath Canal. The extension was built without an act of Parliament {{and there was a}} long delay while Tennant attempted <b>to</b> <b>resolve</b> <b>a</b> dispute with a landowner over the routing of the canal. Once opened, much of the Neath traffic used the Tennant Canal, as Swansea provided better facilities for transferring cargo to ships.|$|E
5|$|The game {{opens in}} 3 AF, as the Pulse town Serah lives in is {{attacked}} by monsters. A stranger named Noel appears {{to help fight}} the monsters and {{claims to be a}} time traveler from 700 AF. He arrived in her time via Valhalla, where he claims to have met Lightning as she guarded the throne of the weakened Etro. As part of Lightning's transfer to Valhalla, she was erased from the fall of Cocoon onwards (making everyone except Serah forget her being with them on Gran Pulse), and paradoxes have erupted throughout time, warping the timeline. Serah joins Noel in a journey to resolve these paradoxes by removing items and monsters, which are out of their original time and correct the timeline; she in hopes of finding her sister and he in hopes of changing the bleak future he comes from. While journeying to 5 AF <b>to</b> <b>resolve</b> <b>a</b> paradox on Cocoon, they meet and help Alyssa, an Academy member and survivor of the Purge, a massacre by the Sanctum at the beginning of Final Fantasy XIII.|$|E

5|$|Under {{the medieval}} common law, {{there was only}} one way <b>to</b> <b>resolve</b> <b>a</b> dispute seeking the {{repayment}} of money or other contract matters; a writ of debt, which only the Court of Common Pleas could hear. This was archaic, did not work against the executors of a will and involved precise pleading; a minor flaw in the documents put to the court could see the case thrown out. By the middle of the 16th century lawyers had attempted to devise an alternative using the action of assumpsit, which was technically a type of trespass due to deceit. The argument was based on the idea that there was an inherent promise in a contract to pay the money, and that by failing to pay the defendant had deceived the plaintiff. By 1558 the lawyers had succeeded, with the Court of King's Bench agreeing to hear cases under this piece of legal fiction. The judges of the Common Pleas, however, a more traditional group, rejected this argument and only accepted cases where an actual promise had been made in addition to the contract.|$|E
5|$|While Rowan {{was still}} a justice of the Court of Appeals, the General Assembly chose him and John J. Crittenden as commissioners <b>to</b> <b>resolve</b> <b>a</b> border dispute with Tennessee. The dispute had arisen from an {{erroneous}} survey of the border line conducted by Dr. Thomas Walker years earlier. Walker's line deviated northward from the intended line (36 degrees, 30 minutes north latitude) by some twelve miles {{by the time it}} reached the Tennessee River. The Tennessee commissioners, Felix Grundy and William L. Brown, proposed that, because it had been accepted for so long, the Walker line be observed as far west as the Tennessee River, with Kentucky being compensated with a more southerly line between the Tennessee and Mississippi Rivers. Crittenden was inclined to accept this proposal with some minor adjustments, but Rowan insisted that Tennessee honor the statutory border of 36 degrees, 30 minutes north. The Tennessee commissioners refused to submit to arbitration in the matter, and Rowan and Crittenden delivered separate reports to the Kentucky legislature. The legislature adopted Crittenden's report; Rowan then resigned as commissioner and was replaced by Robert Trimble. Thereafter, the commissioners quickly agreed to a slightly modified version of the Tennessee proposal.|$|E
5|$|Both Philip I of France and Emperor HenryIV were in {{conflict}} with Urban and declined {{to participate in the}} official crusade. However, members of the high aristocracy from France, western Germany, the Low countries, and Italy were drawn to the venture, commanding their own military contingents in loose, fluid arrangements based on bonds of lordship, family, ethnicity, and language. Foremost amongst these was the elder statesman, Raymond IV, Count of Toulouse. He was rivalled by the relatively poor but martial Bohemond of Taranto and his nephew Tancred from the Norman community of southern Italy. They were joined by Godfrey of Bouillon and his brother Baldwin I of Jerusalem in leading a loose conglomerate from Lorraine, Lotharingia, and Germany. These five princes were pivotal to the campaign that was also joined by a Northern French army led by Robert Curthose, Stephen, Count of Blois, and Robert II, Count of Flanders. The armies, which may have contained as many as 100,000 people, including non-combatants, travelled eastward by land to Byzantium where they were cautiously welcomed by the Emperor. Alexios persuaded many of the princes to pledge allegiance to him and that their first objective should be Nicaea, which Kilij Arslan I had declared the capital of the Sultanate of Rum. Having already destroyed the earlier People's Crusade, the over-confident Sultan left the city <b>to</b> <b>resolve</b> <b>a</b> territorial dispute, enabling its capture in 1097 after a Crusader siege and a Byzantine naval assault. This marked a high point in Latin and Greek co-operation and also the start of Crusader attempts to take advantage of political and religious disunity in the Muslim world: Crusader envoys were sent to Egypt seeking an alliance.|$|E
