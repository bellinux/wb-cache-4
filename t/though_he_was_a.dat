He ran his first 200m {{in over a}} year in Oslo that June and his time of 19.86 seconds was a world-leading one. Two further 200m wins came in Paris and Stockholm the {{following}} month, as did a 100m in Monaco, <b>though</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> tenth of a second slower than compatriot Asafa Powell before the world championships.|$|E

5|$|Merwin {{succeeded in}} making Startling popular and successful, and the {{bimonthly}} schedule was resumed in 1947. At the start of 1952 Startling switched to a monthly schedule; this was unusual in that Startling was notionally junior to Thrilling Wonder, its sister magazine, which remained bimonthly. Merwin left shortly before this switch, in order {{to spend more time}} on his own writing. He was replaced by Samuel Mines, who had worked with Standard's Western magazines, <b>though</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> science fiction aficionado.|$|E
5|$|In 1004-5 al-Maʿarri {{learned that}} his father had died and, in reaction, wrote an elegy where he praised his father. Years later he would travel to Baghdad where he became well {{received}} in the literary salons of the time, <b>though</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> controversial figure. After the eighteen months in Baghdad, al-Maʿarri returned home for unknown reasons. He may have returned because his mother was ill, or he may have run out of money in Baghdad, as he refused to sell his works. He returned to his native town of Maʿarra in about 1010 and {{learned that his}} mother had died before his arrival.|$|E

He was the sixth son of Takekuni Matsui, an impoverished samurai and former {{retainer}} to the daimyō of Owari during the Tokugawa shogunate. After completing elementary school, his parents insisted that he continue his education, but Matsui worried about his father's debts {{and did not want}} to burden him financially. <b>Though</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> short, thin, and sickly young man, Matsui opted for a career in the Army, because in Japan at that time military schools charged the lowest tuition fees.|$|E

5|$|At the 2006 Royal Rumble, Helms {{participated in}} an Open Invitational match for the Cruiserweight Championship and won, even <b>though</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> Raw superstar and the {{championship}} was defended solely on SmackDown!. As a result, {{he returned to the}} SmackDown! brand in February 2006 to start a feud with Nunzio, Kid Kash and the other cruiserweights. During this time, Helms defeated Nunzio in a one-on-one match. The next week, he was supposed to defend against Kid Kash, but Kash was away on a family emergency, so Scotty 2 Hotty took his place. Helms defeated him and declared that he was better than all the other cruiserweights. As a result, all the cruiserweights at the show invaded the ring and attacked Helms. It was later announced by SmackDown! General Manager Theodore Long that at the No Way Out pay-per-view event, Helms would face all the cruiserweights in a match for the title. Helms was able to retain the championship. Later, Long mandated that Helms had to defend his title against a cruiserweight each week on SmackDown! to prove that he truly was better than all the cruiserweights. Helm's first defense under this new rule was against Psicosis of The Mexicools; Helms retained by cheating.|$|E

25|$|Frank Church was {{considered}} a progressive (remarkable considering that he represented {{one of the most}} conservative states in the nation), <b>though</b> <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> strong opponent of gun control.
