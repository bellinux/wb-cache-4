5|$|Critics {{praised the}} film's hard-line look at racism and Fuller's use of melodrama and metaphors {{to present his}} argument, and its {{somewhat}} disheartening ending that leaves <b>the</b> <b>impression</b> <b>that</b> while racism is learned, it cannot be cured. Reviewers consistently questioned the film's lack of wide release in the United States when it was completed and applauded its belated release by Criterion.|$|E
5|$|In 2004, {{a second}} Order in Council, the British Indian Ocean Territory (Constitution) Order 2004, was produced, again {{reinstating}} the off-limits {{nature of the}} Chagos Islands. Bancoult brought a second case, arguing that this Order was again ultra vires and unreasonable, and that the British government had violated legitimate expectation by passing the second Order after giving <b>the</b> <b>impression</b> <b>that</b> the Chagossians were free to return home.|$|E

5|$|Many {{fish have}} eyespots near their tails, {{a form of}} automimicry, to {{distract}} attacks away from the vulnerable head and eye. For example, Chaetodon capistratus has both a (disruptive) eyestripe to conceal the eye, and a large eyespot near its tail, giving <b>the</b> <b>impression</b> <b>that</b> the head is {{at the tail end}} of the body.|$|E
5|$|Shackleton {{had given}} Mackintosh <b>the</b> <b>impression</b> <b>that</b> he would if {{possible}} attempt his crossing during the coming 1914–15 Antarctic season.

Mackintosh was not informed of this change of plan; this misunderstanding led to the underprepared and near-chaotic depot-laying journeys of January–March 1915.|$|E

5|$|The diversionary attacks went well, with Soviet forces acting under <b>the</b> <b>impression</b> <b>that</b> the Poles had targets {{other than}} Vilnius.

She said he was short with her and seemed to hang up in irritation, something he had never done before; he was by all accounts an even-tempered man. June Bamber's sister, Pamela Boutflour, telephoned around 10 pm. She spoke to Sheila, who she said was quiet, then to June, who seemed normal.|$|E

5|$|A {{practical}} {{method was}} {{considered for the}} scene in which Violet Beauregarde turns blue and swells up into a giant 10-foot blueberry. A suit with an air hose was considered at one point for {{the beginnings of the}} swelling scene, before {{the decision was made to}} do the entire transformation in CGI. The visual effects house Cinesite was recruited for this assignment. In some shots of AnnaSophia Robb's head, a facial prosthetic was worn to give <b>the</b> <b>impression</b> <b>that</b> her cheeks had swelled up as well. Because this decision was made late in the film's production, any traces of Violet's blueberry scene were omitted from trailers or promotional material.|$|E
5|$|Ambassador Bishop clearly {{explained}} his rationale {{to the security}} detail, which was to avoid any impression that they were intervening in the violence in Mogadishu. He feared that the embassy would be targeted by organized attacks if any group involved in the clashes got <b>the</b> <b>impression</b> <b>that</b> the US was intervening in the conflict. To this effect, he requested the Voice of America and BBC broadcast announcements that the forces were present only to evacuate the embassy and would not interfere in the conflict. The Marines who had been doused in fuel during the refueling {{were able to take}} a shower and wash their clothes.|$|E

5|$|By 1:30 pm, around 1,000 monks had congregated {{inside to}} hold a meeting while outside a large crowd of pro-Buddhist {{students}} had formed a human barrier around it. The meeting soon ended and all but a hundred monks slowly left the compound. Nearly one thousand monks, accompanied by laypeople, returned to the cremation site. The police lingered nearby. At around 6:00 pm, thirty nuns and six monks were arrested for holding a prayer meeting on the street outside Xá Lợi. The police encircled the pagoda, blocking public passage and giving observers <b>the</b> <b>impression</b> <b>that</b> an armed siege was imminent by donning riot gear.|$|E
5|$|Dalmazzo urged Roatta {{to expand}} Italian links with Serb {{nationalist}} groups into {{an alliance with}} them. At this time, the Italians were looking for allies to restore order, fight the Partisans, and support their political claims to NDH territory, and were under <b>the</b> <b>impression</b> <b>that</b> the various Serb nationalist groups were far better organised than they actually were. For example, Roatta was under <b>the</b> <b>impression</b> <b>that</b> Jevđević represented the Herzegovinian Chetniks, {{and that they were}} aligned with Dangić. In early March, Jevđević and Trifunović-Birčanin suddenly told the Italians that they were effectively in control of a Chetnik movement, and were ready to collaborate with the Italians on the latter's terms. Jevđević sent a message to Dalmazzo explaining that the Herzegovinian Chetniks wanted to avenge Todorović and were concentrating around Nevesinje ready to demonstrate their loyalty to the Italians. Despite their statements, Jevđević and Trifunović-Birčanin faced significant difficulties; the Serb nationalist groups had yet to demonstrate their military value to the Italians, and not all of the armed groups even acknowledged their leadership.|$|E
5|$|During {{their field}} trip, the bus from Springfield Elementary {{arrives at the}} Fort Springfield civil war site and skids into a cannon, {{knocking}} one of its wheels off. The cannon then points at the tower leg of a lookout, giving <b>the</b> <b>impression</b> <b>that</b> it will fire at the lookout and destroy it, which is {{a reference to the}} opening sequence of the television sitcom F Troop. The lookout was also modeled after the lookout in the show. The scene in which Üter is left behind {{at the end of the}} field trip is based on a scene from the 1965 film Von Ryan's Express.|$|E

5|$|Early grunge concerts were sparsely {{attended}} (many by {{fewer than}} a dozen people) but Sub Pop photographer Charles Peterson's pictures helped create <b>the</b> <b>impression</b> <b>that</b> such concerts were major events. Mudhoney, which was formed by former members of Green River, served as the flagship band of Sub Pop during their entire time with the label and spearheaded the Seattle grunge movement. Other record labels in the Pacific Northwest that helped promote grunge included C/Z Records, Estrus Records, EMpTy Records and PopLlama Records.|$|E
5|$|Freda {{felt that}} I Vampiri {{did not succeed}} financially in Italy due to the country's {{audience}} reluctance to an Italian interpretation of the horror genre. For Freda's next film, Caltiki – The Immortal Monster, he used an English pseudonym of Robert Hampton to give <b>the</b> <b>impression</b> <b>that</b> the film was not Italian. Freda attempted a gothic horror film again five years later with his film The Horrible Dr. Hichcock. Other crew members {{would go on to}} direct horror films following I Vampiri, such as screenwriter Piero Regnoli who directed The Playgirls and the Vampire (1960) and Bava who became the cinematographer on Freda's Caltiki as well as directing Black Sunday (1960).|$|E

Ulm was protected by the heavily fortified Michelsberg heights, giving Mack <b>the</b> <b>impression</b> <b>that</b> the city was virtually impregnable from outside attack.|$|E
