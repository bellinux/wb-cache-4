5|$|In 1879, two Arco cattlemen named Arthur Ferris and J.W. Powell {{became the}} first known people to explore the lava fields. They were {{investigating}} its possible use for grazing and watering cattle but found <b>the</b> <b>area</b> <b>to</b> be unsuitable and left.|$|E

5|$|Trade between tribes {{became more}} {{widespread}} during the Mariposa phase, and the diet continued to improve.

5|$|A part {{of western}} Slavonia, {{encompassing}} an area extending approximately , was {{designated as the}} UNPA of Western Slavonia or Sector West by the peace plan. Unlike other UNPAs, the RSK controlled {{only a part of}} the area—approximately a third of the UNPA located in the south—centred on the town of Okučani. The RSK-held area included a section of the Zagreb–Belgrade motorway. The UNPROFOR deployed to Sector West thought the HV would attack <b>the</b> <b>area</b> <b>to</b> control the motorway. In response, the UNPROFOR developed Operation Backstop aimed at defending against the HV attack, assuming that its main axis would be aligned with the motorway.|$|E

5|$|After {{completing}} {{sea trials}} in early 1941, Tirpitz briefly {{served as the}} centrepiece of the Baltic Fleet, which was intended to prevent a possible break-out attempt by the Soviet Baltic Fleet. In early 1942, the ship sailed to Norway {{to act as a}} deterrent against an Allied invasion. While stationed in Norway, Tirpitz was also intended to be used to intercept Allied convoys to the Soviet Union, and two such missions were attempted in 1942. This was the only feasible role for her, since the St Nazaire Raid had made operations against the Atlantic convoy lanes too risky. Tirpitz acted as a fleet in being, forcing the British Royal Navy to retain significant naval forces in <b>the</b> <b>area</b> <b>to</b> contain the battleship.|$|E
5|$|After the war area {{economic}} diversification {{brought on by}} the war effort helped in the transition to a peacetime economy. NASA's Johnson Space Center was established in 1963 helping to spur explosive growth in the mid-20th century, especially the 1970s and 1980s. The remainder of the communities on the southwestern shore urbanized and development connected <b>the</b> <b>area</b> <b>to</b> Houston.

5|$|Another {{major concern}} of the Shelby {{administration}} was free navigation on the Mississippi River, which was vital to the state's economic interests. For political reasons the Spanish had closed the port at New Orleans to the Americans. This {{would have been the}} natural market for the tobacco, flour and hemp grown by Kentucky farmers; overland routes were too expensive to be profitable. This made it difficult for land speculators to entice immigration to <b>the</b> <b>area</b> <b>to</b> turn a profit on their investments. Many Kentuckians felt the federal government was not acting decisively or quickly enough to remedy this situation.|$|E
5|$|Anticipating {{that people}} would come to <b>the</b> <b>area</b> <b>to</b> indulge in the newly fashionable pastime of sea-bathing, an {{activity}} with perceived health benefits, Tregonwell built a series of villas on his land between 1816 and 1822, which he hoped to let out. The common belief that pine-scented air was good for lung conditions, and in particular tuberculosis, prompted Tregonwell and Tapps to plant hundreds of pine trees. These early attempts to promote the town as a health resort meant {{that by the time}} Tregonwell had died in 1832, Bournemouth had grown into a small community with a scattering of houses, villas and cottages. The town would ultimately grow up around the scattered pines and tree-lined walk to the beach, later to become known as the Invalids' Walk.|$|E
5|$|As one of {{the major}} herbivores of {{southern}} and eastern Africa, the blue wildebeest {{plays an important role in}} the ecosystem and is a main prey item for large predators such as the lion.

5|$|As {{promised by}} Massasoit, {{numerous}} Native Americans arrived at Plymouth {{throughout the middle}} of 1621 with pledges of peace. On July 2, a party of Pilgrims led by Edward Winslow (who later became the chief diplomat of the colony) set out to continue negotiations with the chief. The delegation also included Squanto, who acted as a translator. After traveling for several days, they arrived at Massasoit's capital, the village of Sowams near Narragansett Bay. After meals and an exchange of gifts, Massasoit agreed to an exclusive trading pact with the English; thus, the French were no longer welcome, though they were also frequent traders in the area. Squanto remained behind and traveled throughout <b>the</b> <b>area</b> <b>to</b> establish trading relations with several tribes.|$|E
5|$|As the Canadians began {{preparations}} for an assault, the Germans {{were in the}} process of executing an assault plan of their own. The XIII (Royal Württemberg) Corps spent six weeks planning and carefully preparing their attack on the Mount Sorrel, Tor Top (Hill 62) and Hill 61 peaks. Their objective was to take control of the observation positions east of Ypres and keep as many British units as possible pinned down in <b>the</b> <b>area,</b> <b>to</b> avoid them transferring to the Somme front and assisting with the observed build-up in that area. The Germans constructed practice trenches resembling the Canadian positions near Tor Top to rehearse the assault, well behind their own lines.|$|E

5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the war, a discontinuous front line ran through southern Finland from west to east, dividing the country into White Finland and Red Finland. The Red Guards controlled <b>the</b> <b>area</b> <b>to</b> the south, including nearly all the major towns and industrial centres, and the largest estates and farms with high numbers of crofters and tenant farmers. The White Army controlled <b>the</b> <b>area</b> <b>to</b> the north, which was predominantly agrarian with small or medium-sized farms and tenant farmers, and where crofters were few, or held a better social position than in the south. Enclaves of the opposing forces existed {{on both sides of the}} front line: within the White area lay the industrial towns of Varkaus, Kuopio, Oulu, Raahe, Kemi and Tornio; within the Red area lay Porvoo, Kirkkonummi and Uusikaupunki. The elimination of these strongholds was a priority for both armies in February 1918.|$|E
