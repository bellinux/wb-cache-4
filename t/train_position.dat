In January 2013, the MBTA announced plans to add full vehicle location tracking on the Green Line for countdown signs and smartphone applications, including using AVI data in the tunnels and GPS receivers on the surface lines. The first real-time data—location data on the surface lines—became available in October 2014. Full tracking is expected by early 2015.|$|E

40|$|This work {{describes}} {{neural network}} training techniques for enhancing {{the performance of}} a one-dimensional beam for determining load positions. The system was a distributive system which relied on the detection of changes in the surface properties that can be seen across the surface. The demonstrated distributive system was 400 mm in length. The applied load positions within the range 60 – 300 mm could be determined with an average percentage error of 0. 2 % of the beam length which corresponded to a position error of 0. 8 mm using a network trained with 10 <b>training</b> <b>positions.</b> It was found that the errors were higher for the load applied near the edges of the beam, leading to an average percentage error of 3. 6 % for the whole length of the beam. The normalization of the network output can be employed to reduce the average percentage error by approximately 1 % for a given number of <b>training</b> <b>positions.</b> The performance was improved by introducing more <b>training</b> <b>positions</b> in the less sensitive area. The described training technique not only reduced the prediction error but also enlarged the areas where the prediction errors were satisfactorily small. Using the described technique, the overall prediction error could be decreased by 0. 13 – 0. 24 % of the beam length for 30 – 10 <b>training</b> <b>positions.</b> The area where the prediction errors were within 2 mm was increased by 14. 5 – 7. 3 % of the beam length for a network trained with 4 <b>training</b> <b>positions</b> in the middle portion using 10 – 30 <b>training</b> <b>positions...</b>|$|R

40|$|The thesis {{addresses}} {{the topic of}} employment of persons with disabilities on sheltered and <b>training</b> <b>positions.</b> Its intention is {{to draw attention to}} the importance of employment in the life of these people, the importance of raising public awareness and the necessity to establish a responsive attitude of the public as well as employers in this sphere. The thesis provides a theoretical background for the issues of employment of the disabled. It intentionally explains the term of vocational rehabilitation in a broader context of active employment policy and as an element of complex rehabilitation. The thesis characterises the sphere of social entrepreneurship as one of the options where the creation of sheltered and <b>training</b> <b>positions</b> may form a central programme of an enterprise. It presents operational programmes which currently enable the creation of <b>training</b> <b>positions.</b> The thesis includes characteristics of a selected entity where <b>training</b> and sheltered <b>positions</b> are implemented on a sociotherapeutic farm. The practical section of the thesis describes the possible ways of utilising the sociotherapeutic farm in the employment of individuals with disabilities. The research section assesses the benefits of working on the farm for specific disabled individuals employed as animal attendants. Powered by TCPDF [...] ...|$|R

50|$|When {{the resort}} first opened in 1971, both beams {{operated}} {{in the same}} direction (clockwise—the direction the modern day resort line runs) based visual clearances and off a standard block light system. Entrance to the Contemporary was only allowed upon receipt of radio clearance due to the inability of pilots to see other trains in the station. For safety reasons, this practice was discontinued by 1973. The Express Line began operating counter clockwise and a flashing white strobe light was added to the rear cab (non-operating end) as an indication of <b>train</b> <b>position</b> for approaching trains. A Moving Blocklight System (MBS), also known as the MAPO system (for Mary Poppins, profits from the film provided funding for the project, U.S. Pat. 3,973,746), was installed by the mid-1970s.|$|E

40|$|Abstract- The {{concept of}} {{electronic}} track map {{has been introduced}} and researched in many satellite-based railway <b>train</b> <b>positioning</b> and location-based railway systems.

30|$|<b>Train</b> <b>position</b> {{has been}} {{identified}} as a key factor influencing crossing decision [14]. One observational study demonstrated a significant effect of <b>train</b> <b>position,</b> such that the odds of transgression (versus safe crossing) were higher if crossing in front of an approaching train compared to behind an ongoing train [1]. Such behaviour could be explained by the lack of visibility of the approaching train or by a perception bias (i.e. a misjudgement of train speed or perception that the train is “far away”). Indeed, respondents in a survey conducted by Clancy, Dickinson [15] indicated that they had previously transgressed as they believed that they “had sufficient time to get across before the train reached the crossing” (p. 23). In relation to this, Clark, Perrone [16] have demonstrated that the estimation of the speed of large moving objects such as and specifically trains is likely to be erroneous. In their experimental simulation study, the same authors confirmed that consistent with Leibowitz’ theory (1985), a visible approaching train is perceived to be moving slower that an approaching car and therefore could be a contributing factor towards pedestrians’ low perception of risk.|$|E
