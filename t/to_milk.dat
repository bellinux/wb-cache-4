5|$|However, it {{has often}} been the case that league players have joined Andover after {{retiring}} from professional football. One of the most notable of these in modern times is Matt Crossley, who ended his career with the Lions after playing more than 100 matches for Wycombe Wanderers. After leaving Andover in 2001, Crossley later became assistant manager at Woking where he gained notoriety in December 2006 after he headbutted an opposing player who had tried to break up a fight. Maurice Evans is another former professional who, after briefly taking over as Andover's player-manager in 1967, went on to lead Reading to the Fourth Division championship, and Oxford United <b>to</b> <b>Milk</b> Cup victory.|$|E
5|$|Keeping {{his promise}} <b>to</b> <b>Milk,</b> newly elected Mayor George Moscone {{appointed}} {{him to the}} Board of Permit Appeals in 1976, making him the first openly gay city commissioner in the United States. Milk, however, considered seeking {{a position in the}} California State Assembly. The district was weighted heavily in his favor, as much of it was based in neighborhoods surrounding Castro Street, where Milk's sympathizers voted. In the previous race for supervisor, Milk received more votes than the currently seated assemblyman. However, Moscone had made a deal with the assembly speaker that another candidate should run—Art Agnos. Furthermore, by order of the mayor, neither appointed nor elected officials were allowed to run a campaign while performing their duties.|$|E

40|$|The study {{about the}} effects of {{biotechnology}} on women's body within reproductive practices, has intrigued researchers from all disciplines. This research aims at investigating the motivations of women <b>to</b> donate their <b>milk</b> <b>to</b> a human <b>milk</b> bank and the relationship between the use of technology, such a breast pumps, with processes of embodiment. The scarcity of studies about the experiences of women <b>to</b> donate their <b>milk</b> <b>to</b> a <b>milk</b> bank has lead me to investigate the historical process through which milk banks have supplanted wet nursing activities and how nowadays, women use the service of milk banks. This research embraces the feminist approach by analysing women's narratives through the perspective of Grosz's theory on embodiment and subjectivity. The methodology applied to investigate women's subjectivity consist of 10 interviews <b>to</b> women <b>milk</b> donors about their experiences in using breast pumps and regarding the motivations <b>to</b> donate the <b>milk</b> <b>to</b> the <b>milk</b> bank. The analyses of women's narratives highlight that (1) women with <b>milk</b> surplus decide <b>to</b> donate their <b>milk</b> because they attribute a specific value <b>to</b> the <b>milk.</b> The value of the milk takes into consideration women's effort to have a healthy and balanced life. To describe themselves and their body (2) while using breast pumps, women recur to metaphors such as 'I feel like a machine' which embodied dominant ideas on the reproductive body. This study wants to contribute to theories on embodiment within maternal reproductive practices and infants feeding practices...|$|R

Stewie realizes how pathetic he is and accepts his weaning. He comes to Brian and informs {{that he is now}} off breast milk, but Lois has other plans. Lois allows Stewie to be breastfed again, thus delighting him.|$|E

5|$|The {{best known}} Welsh cheese is Caerphilly, named in 1831 but made long before that. Originally {{a method for}} storing excess milk until it could be brought to market, it was a moist cheese that would not last very long. Production of the cheese was halted due <b>to</b> <b>milk</b> {{rationing}} after World War II, although it was still made in England. There, the cheese was produced very quickly and sold early in its maturation process, creating a dryer cheese. In the 1970s, production of Caerphilly returned to Wales and over the following few decades {{a variety of new}} cheeses have also been produced in Wales.|$|E

5|$|Production {{is still}} {{specialized}} in horticultural goods, {{but most of}} the masseiras were substituted by greenhouses and a significant share of the production is exported to other Western European markets. Póvoa de Varzim is part of the ancient Vinho Verde winemaking region, and there is commercial wine production, however local masseira wines are not commercially produced. The inland valley region is committed <b>to</b> <b>milk</b> production and the Agros corporation headquarters of Lactogal, the largest dairy products and milk producer company in the Iberian Peninsula, is located in Espaço Agros and has several departments such as exhibition park and laboratories. In agriculture, the masseira farm fields were developed. This technique increases agricultural yields by using large, rectangular depressions dug into sand dunes, with the spoil piled up into banks surrounding the depression. Grapes are cultivated on the banks to the south, east and west, and trees and reeds on the northern slope act as a windbreak against the prevailing northern wind. Garden crops are grown in the central depression.|$|E
5|$|When Milk's friends {{looked in}} his closet for a suit for his casket, they learned how much he had been {{affected}} by the recent decrease in his income as a supervisor. All of his clothes were coming apart; all of his socks had holes. He was cremated and his ashes were split, most of them scattered in San Francisco Bay by his closest friends. Some of them were encapsulated and buried beneath {{the sidewalk in front of}} 575 Castro Street, where Castro Camera had been located. There is a memorial <b>to</b> <b>Milk</b> also at Neptune Society Columbarium, ground floor, San Francisco, California. Harry Britt, one of four people Milk listed on his tape as an acceptable replacement should he be assassinated, was chosen to fill that position by the city's acting mayor, Dianne Feinstein.|$|E
5|$|Since {{the end of}} World War II, {{the major}} port city of San Francisco had been home to a sizable number of gay men {{expelled}} from the military who had decided to stay rather than return to their hometowns and face ostracism. By 1969 the Kinsey Institute believed San Francisco had more gay people per capita than any other American city; when the National Institute of Mental Health asked the Institute to survey homosexuals, the Institute chose San Francisco as its focus. Milk and McKinley were among the thousands of gay men attracted to San Francisco. McKinley was a stage manager for Tom O'Horgan, a director who started his career in experimental theater, but soon graduated to much larger Broadway productions. They arrived in 1969 with the Broadway touring company of Hair. McKinley was offered {{a job in the}} New York City production of Jesus Christ Superstar, and their tempestuous relationship came to an end. The city appealed <b>to</b> <b>Milk</b> so much that he decided to stay, working at an investment firm. In 1970, increasingly frustrated with the political climate after the U.S. invasion of Cambodia, Milk let his hair grow long. When told to cut it, he refused and was fired.|$|E
