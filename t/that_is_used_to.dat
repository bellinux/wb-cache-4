5|$|In 1871, the German surgeon Friedrich Trendelenburg (1844–1924) {{published}} a paper describing {{the first successful}} elective human tracheotomy to be performed {{for the purpose of}} administration of general anesthesia. In 1888, Sir Morell Mackenzie (1837–1892) {{published a}} book discussing the indications for tracheotomy. In the early 20th century, tracheotomy became a life-saving treatment for patients afflicted with paralytic poliomyelitis who required mechanical ventilation. In 1909, Philadelphia laryngologist Chevalier Jackson (1865–1958) described a technique for tracheotomy <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> this day.|$|E

5|$|The {{distribution}} of the electrons in solid materials can be visualized by angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES). This technique employs the photoelectric effect to measure the reciprocal space—a mathematical representation of periodic structures <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> infer the original structure. ARPES {{can be used to}} determine the direction, speed and scattering of electrons within the material.|$|E
5|$|A {{different}} call is {{emitted by}} a male frog or unreceptive female when mounted by another male. This is a distinct chirruping sound and {{is accompanied by a}} vibration of the body. Tree frogs and some non-aquatic species have a rain call that they make on the basis of humidity cues prior to a shower. Many species also have a territorial call <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> drive away other males. All of these calls are emitted with the mouth of the frog closed. A distress call, emitted by some frogs when they are in danger, is produced with the mouth open resulting in a higher-pitched call. It is typically used when the frog has been grabbed by a predator and may serve to distract or disorientate the attacker so that it releases the frog.|$|E

5|$|A {{food web}} is the archetypal {{ecological}} network. Plants capture solar energy {{and use it}} to synthesize simple sugars during photosynthesis. As plants grow, they accumulate nutrients and are eaten by grazing herbivores, and the energy is transferred through a chain of organisms by consumption. The simplified linear feeding pathways that move from a basal trophic species to a top consumer is called the food chain. The larger interlocking pattern of food chains in an ecological community creates a complex food web. Food webs are a type of concept map or a heuristic device <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> illustrate and study pathways of energy and material flows.|$|E
5|$|According to the ethnobiologists Smith-Hall, Larsen and Pouliotof, a {{medicinal}} plant is a plant <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> attempt to maintain health, {{to be administered}} for a specific condition, or both, whether in modern medicine or in traditional medicine. The Food and Agriculture Organization estimated in 2002 that over 50,000 {{medicinal plant}}s are used across the world. The Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew more conservatively estimated in 2016 that 17,810 plant species have a medicinal use, out of some 30,000 plants for which a use of any kind is documented.|$|E

The film {{is set in}} the mid-22nd century, when humans are colonizing Pandora, a lush habitable moon of a gas giant in the Alpha Centauri star system, in order to mine the mineral unobtanium, a room-temperature superconductor. The expansion of the mining colony threatens the continued existence of a local tribe of Na'vi– a humanoid species indigenous to Pandora. The film's title refers to a genetically engineered Na'vi body with the mind of a remotely located human <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> interact with the natives of Pandora.|$|E
5|$|Candidates {{may use the}} Internet {{to publish}} {{election}} advertising, including posting content on electronic media applications (such as digital banners, instant messaging software, mobile applications, RSS feed readers and widgets), social networking services and other websites, and sending e-mails. SMS and MMS messages can also be sent. Candidates must notify the returning officer of each platform on the Internet <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> publish election advertising within 12 hours {{after the start of}} the campaign period (that is, the time when the place of nomination closes on nomination day) and thereafter each time before a platform is used for such publication. Candidate and their election agents must use their best efforts to ensure that all Internet election advertising is published in accordance with the law; in other words, the returning officer must be satisfied that all reasonable steps in the circumstances were taken. Contravening any regulations relating to election advertising on the Internet is a criminal offence punishable by a fine of up to $1,000, jail of up to 12 months, or both.|$|E
5|$|Croc's {{maneuvering}} {{abilities are}} somewhat {{comparable to that}} of Mario's in Super Mario 64, with his primary methods of movement consisting of the abilities to run, jump, climb, and swim using either the analog stick or the D-pad, as well as touting the abilities to perform a sidestep and a 180-degree quick turn as other methods of maneuver. Croc's main method of attack consists of a full-circle tail swipe <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> defeat enemies and bosses, as well as a hit drop move {{that can be used to}} break open crates containing collectibles. Croc's in-game health is represented by the crystals that the player collects throughout the game; when Croc is hurt by an enemy, all of his crystals are lost and scattered around him in several directions (similar to a mechanic commonly used in Sonic the Hedgehog). If Croc is hurt while he has no crystals, the player loses a life and is sent back to the beginning of the segment of the level they are currently in.|$|E

Using the new 100inch Mt. Wilson telescope, Edwin Hubble was able to resolve the outer parts of some spiral nebulae as collections of individual stars and identified some Cepheid variables, thus allowing him to estimate the distance to the nebulae: they were far too distant {{to be part of the}} Milky Way. In 1936 Hubble produced a classification of galactic morphology <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> this day.|$|E
5|$|Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories is a {{combination}} between a role-playing video game and collectible card game. The main role-playing aspect is an experience point system <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> increase the character's maximum health or Card Points, or {{to learn a new}} skill. The cards are utilized in the progression of the story as well as in combat. The game features a field map and battle screen. The field map is an isometric area where the player can traverse between rooms. Enemies inhabit the field map and track the player to engage in combat, which can be initiated through contact between the player and an enemy. Once combat has been engaged, the game switches to the battle screen which utilizes a card-based battle system.|$|E

It may be mobbed by birds while there is still light, and by bats, other nightjar species or Eurasian woodcocks during the night. Owls and other predators such as red foxes will be mobbed by {{both male and female}} European nightjars. Like other aerial birds, such as swifts and swallows, nightjars make a quick plunge into water to wash. They have a unique serrated comb-like structure on the middle claw <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> preen and perhaps remove parasites.|$|E

5|$|Otters are {{the only}} marine animals {{that are capable of}} lifting and turning over rocks, which they often do with their front paws when searching for prey. The sea otter may pluck snails and other organisms from kelp and dig deep into {{underwater}} mud for clams. It is the only marine mammal that catches fish with its forepaws rather than with its teeth. Under each foreleg, sea otters have a loose pouch of skin that extends across the chest which they use to store collected food to bring to the surface. This pouch also holds a rock <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> break open shellfish and clams, an example of tool use. The sea otters eat while floating on their backs, using their forepaws to tear food apart and bring to their mouths. Marine otters mainly feed on crustaceans and fish.|$|E
5|$|The Hertzsprung-Russell diagram (HR diagram) is {{a plot of}} {{luminosity}} {{versus a}} color index {{for a set of}} stars. IK Pegasi A is currently a main sequence star—a term <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> describe a nearly linear grouping of core hydrogen-fusing stars based on their position on the HR diagram. However, IK Pegasi A lies in a narrow, nearly vertical band of the HR diagram that is known as the instability strip. Stars in this band oscillate in a coherent manner, resulting in periodic pulsations in the star's luminosity.|$|E
5|$|The {{measurement}} of stellar parallax of nearby stars provides a fundamental baseline in the cosmic distance ladder <b>that</b> <b>is</b> <b>used</b> <b>to</b> measure {{the scale of}} the Universe. Parallax measurements of nearby stars provide an absolute baseline for the properties of more distant stars, as their properties can be compared. Measurements of the radial velocity and proper motion of stars allows astronomers to plot the movement of these systems through the Milky Way galaxy. Astrometric results are the basis used to calculate the distribution of speculated dark matter in the galaxy.|$|E
