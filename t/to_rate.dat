Once done, participants were asked for various demographic data, including their birthday.|$|E

30|$|A well-functioning {{monetary}} transmission {{mechanism is}} critical for monetary policy. As the Dominican Republic recently adopted an inflation targeting regime, {{it is even more}} relevant to guarantee that changes in the monetary policy rates are quickly and fully reflected in retail <b>rates,</b> <b>to</b> eventually influence aggregate demand and inflation. This paper estimates the interest rate pass-through of the monetary policy <b>rate</b> <b>to</b> retail <b>rates</b> and explores asymmetries in the adjustment. We find evidence of complete pass-through <b>to</b> retail <b>rates,</b> confirming the effectiveness of the monetary policy transmission mechanism. However, our results also suggest a faster pass-through <b>to</b> lending <b>rates</b> than <b>to</b> deposit <b>rates</b> and asymmetric adjustments of short-term rates, as deposit <b>rates</b> respond faster <b>to</b> policy <b>rate</b> cuts and lending <b>rates</b> respond faster <b>to</b> policy <b>rate</b> hikes. Measures <b>to</b> enhance competition in the financial system could help to achieve a symmetric adjustment of retail rates.|$|R
5|$|Nickell, Pederson, and Rossow {{looked for}} effects with {{significant}} years. They asked 83 undergraduate students <b>to</b> <b>rate,</b> {{on a scale}} from 1 to 7, how much they liked the years between 1976 and 2001, the months of the year, the seasons, times of day, and even types of pet in an attempt to disguise the aim of the study. Analysis of the data showed that participants liked the year of their birth much more than the average of the four years after they were born. The researchers also found that the year of high school graduation was also liked better than average. Of the months of the year, the most liked month was the one in which the participants were born.|$|E

The season produced 24 tropical and subtropical cyclones, of which only 8 reached storm intensity, 4 became hurricanes, and only 1 reached major hurricane status. Although more active than the 1972 season, 1973 brought few storms of note. Nearly half of the season's storms affected land, one of which resulted in severe damage.|$|E

30|$|We find {{evidence}} of complete pass-through <b>to</b> retail <b>rates,</b> confirming {{the effectiveness of the}} monetary policy transmission mechanism. Similarly, our results indicate that government domestic bond yields increase when monetary policy becomes more contractionary. However, we also {{find evidence}} of a faster pass-through <b>to</b> lending <b>rates</b> than <b>to</b> deposit <b>rates.</b> Moreover, short-term deposit <b>rates</b> respond faster <b>to</b> policy <b>rate</b> cuts with respect to hikes, while short-term lending <b>rates</b> respond faster <b>to</b> policy <b>rate</b> hikes with respect to cuts. The theoretical literature associates asymmetries in the speed of adjustment to collusive market behaviors. Thus, measures to boost competition in the financial system could help to achieve a symmetric adjustment of retail rates.|$|R
5|$|Archibald Campbell MacLaren (1 December 1871– 17 November 1944) was an English cricketer who captained the England cricket team {{at various}} times between 1898 and 1909. A {{right-handed}} batsman, he played 35 Test matches for England, as captain in 22 of those games, and led the team to defeat in four Ashes series against Australia. An amateur, MacLaren played first-class cricket for Lancashire, captaining that county {{for most of his}} career. As a batsman, MacLaren was one of the leading cricketers of his time and had a reputation as a fast-scoring stylist. In 1895, he scored 424 runs in an innings against Somerset which was the highest individual score in first-class cricket until 1923 and remained a record in English cricket until 1994. Opinions were divided over his captaincy. He was a deep thinker on the game and critics believed him to be tactically advanced, but his pessimism, clashes with the selectors and inability to get the best out of his players led most commentators <b>to</b> <b>rate</b> him a poor leader.|$|E
5|$|Falk, Heine, Takemura, Zhang and Hsu {{investigated}} {{the validity of}} implicit self-esteem measures to assess cultural differences. They subjected Canadian and Japanese participants {{to a series of}} tests, one of which was rating the numbers to 40 by how much participants liked them. Because the researchers saw little to no correlation between the various implicit self-esteem measures, they did not draw any conclusions about cultural differences. Stieger and Krizan explored cross-cultural differences in number preferences, specifically the day on which Christmas is celebrated as a contributor to number preference. They asked participants from six countries <b>to</b> <b>rate</b> numbers between 1 and 36. They found that in countries where gifts are exchanged on 24 December participants disproportionately preferred the number 24, whereas in countries that do this on 25 December participants preferred 25. They concluded that cultural influences need {{to be taken into account}} if these preferences are used to reflect individual differences.|$|E
5|$|Lindwall {{resumed his}} {{first-class}} cricket career steadily against Queensland and South Australia. Lindwall gave his first indications of cricketing potential on a 38 degree {{day in the}} second innings of a match against Victoria. A day after suffering a mild malaria attack, Lindwall gave a spell of four overs which netted him three wickets, bowling at speeds not seen in Australia since Larwood. An innings of 134 not out in just 180 minutes against Queensland at the SCG underlined by cutting and driving exhibited his batting skill, and with a haul of 9/77 against South Australia further underlining his allround credential. Lindwall gained further attention when he turned out for New South Wales against the feted Australian Services team of Lindsay Hassett that had played in the 1945 Victory Tests in England. Lindwall's hostile bowling delivered three wickets in each innings, finishing with match figures of 6/95, leading Hassett <b>to</b> <b>rate</b> him as the best fast-bowling prospect in a decade. With 33 wickets for the season, Lindwall as selected for an Australian team tour of New Zealand under Bill Brown. He played in a Test against New Zealand, which was not awarded Test status until 1948. In a match in which Australia fielded seven Test debutants, Lindwall opened the bowling with state teammate Ernie Toshack. Lindwall had limited opportunities on a sticky wicket which favoured the slower bowling of O’Reilly and Toshack, who took eight and seven wickets respectively. He took 1/13 and 1/16 as Australia won by an innings and 103 runs. Lindwall made a duck in Australia's only innings.|$|E
