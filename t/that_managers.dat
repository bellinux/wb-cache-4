This imperfect mobility can produce competitive advantages for firms that acquire immobile resources.

25|$|Corporate finance is {{the area}} of finance dealing with the sources of funding and the capital {{structure}} of corporations, the actions <b>that</b> <b>managers</b> take to increase {{the value of the}} firm to the shareholders, and the tools and analysis used to allocate financial resources. The primary goal of corporate finance is to maximize or increase shareholder value. Although it is in principle different from managerial finance which studies the financial management of all firms, rather than corporations alone, the main concepts in the study of corporate finance are applicable to the financial problems of all kinds of firms.|$|E
25|$|Beginning in {{the late}} colonial period, Massachusetts {{leveraged}} its strong seafaring tradition, advanced shipbuilding industry, {{and access to the}} oceans to make the U.S. the pre-eminent whaling nation in the world by the 1830s. Whale oil was in demand chiefly for lamps. By the 1750s whaling in Nantucket had become a highly lucrative deep-sea industry, with voyages extending for years at a time and with vessels traveling as far as South Pacific waters. The British Navy captured most of the whalers during the revolution, {{but at the same time}} many whalers refitted out as privateers against the British. Whaling recovered after the war as New Bedford became the center. Whalers took greater economic risks to turn major profits: expanding their hunting grounds and securing foreign and domestic workforces for the Pacific. Investment decisions and financing arrangements were set up so <b>that</b> <b>managers</b> of whaling ventures shared their risks by selling some equity claims but retained a substantial portion due to moral hazard considerations. As a result, they had little incentive to consider the correlation between their own returns and those of others in planning their voyages. This stifled diversity in whaling voyages and increased industry-wide risk. After 1860 kerosene replaced whale oil—concurrent with the devastation of the whaling fleet by Confederate commerce raiders—and the entrepreneurs shifted to manufacturing.|$|E

500|$|Getzein's {{record for}} {{complete}} games {{is based in}} part on the customs of the 1880s. [...] In 1915, Baseball Magazine reported <b>that</b> <b>managers</b> were not allowed to freely pull the starting pitcher from a game in the bygone era. [...] It cited an incident involving Getzein to illustrate the old practice:"The Nationals got onto Getzein in the fourth inning and batted him all over the field. In the fifth inning they kept up the slugging until Getzein said he was ill, and Manager Hanlon wanted the Nationals to allow Getzein to retire, claiming that he was too sick to play. Baker, captaining the home club, said he would call a doctor and have him examine Getzein, and if the latter was really sick he would probably allow the change to be made. Dr. Bond, who happened to be present, was called on, and he examined the pitcher, while the crowd guyed Getzein terribly. The doctor announced that he did not consider Getzein sick, only discouraged at the pounding he had received, and that {{he would be able to}} finish the game." ...|$|E

40|$|Previous {{studies have}} shown <b>that</b> reticent <b>managers,</b> who are {{identified}} {{through a series of}} random-response questions, answer questions about corruption, firm performance and how honest they are differently from other managers. If reticent managers’ answers are different because they are lying, estimates of these behaviors will be inaccurate. But it is also possible <b>that</b> reticent <b>managers</b> answer questions differently because they and their firms are different. This paper presents evidence consistent with the idea <b>that</b> reticent <b>managers</b> lie. First, it shows <b>that</b> reticent <b>managers</b> in Nigeria report that their firms pay higher wages than other firms. This is consistent with previous studies that have found that they also report better performance. Second, it shows that workers at firms with reticent managers report lower, or similar, wages to workers at other firms. The different responses of the managers and the workers suggest <b>that</b> reticent <b>managers</b> are lying. <b>That</b> is, reticent <b>managers</b> in Nigeria report paying higher wages but they are not doing so. ...|$|R

2500|$|The {{idea was}} <b>that</b> <b>managers</b> used these {{perspective}} headings to prompt {{the selection of}} a small number of measures that informed on that aspect of the organisation's strategic performance. [...] The perspective headings show that Kaplan and Norton were thinking about the needs of non-divisional commercial organisations in their initial design. [...] These categories were not so relevant to public sector or non-profit organisations, or units within complex organizations (which might have high degrees of internal specialization), and much of the early literature on balanced scorecard focused on suggestions of alternative 'perspectives' that might have more relevance to these groups(e.g. Butler et al.

2500|$|Corporate finance {{deals with}} the sources funding and the capital {{structure}} of corporations, the actions <b>that</b> <b>managers</b> take to increase {{the value of the}} firm to the shareholders, and the tools and analysis used to allocate financial resources. [...] Although it is in principle different from managerial finance which studies the financial management of all firms, rather than corporations alone, the main concepts in the study of corporate finance are applicable to the financial problems of all kinds of firms. [...] Corporate finance generally involves balancing risk and profitability, while attempting to maximize an entity's assets, net incoming cash flow and the value of its stock, and generically entails three primary areas of capital resource allocation. In the first, [...] "capital budgeting", management must choose which [...] "projects" [...] (if any) to undertake. The discipline of capital budgeting may employ standard business valuation techniques or even extend to real options valuation; see Financial modeling. [...] The second, [...] "sources of capital" [...] relates to how these investments are to be funded: investment capital can be provided through different sources, such as by shareholders, in the form of equity (privately or via an initial public offering), creditors, often in the form of bonds, and the firm's operations (cash flow). Short-term funding or working capital is mostly provided by banks extending a line of credit. The balance between these elements forms the company's capital structure. [...] The third, [...] "the dividend policy", requires management to determine whether any unappropriated profit (excess cash) is to be retained for future investment / operational requirements, or instead to be distributed to shareholders, and if so, in what form. [...] Short term financial management is often termed [...] "working capital management", and relates to cash-, inventory- and debtors management.|$|E
