5|$|By 1980, Gulf {{exhibited}} many of {{the characteristics}} of a giant corporation <b>that</b> <b>had</b> <b>lost</b> its way. It had a huge but poorly performing asset portfolio, associated with a depressed share price. The stock market value of Gulf started to drop below the break-up value of its assets. Such a situation was bound to attract the interest of corporate raiders, although a corporation in the top 100 of the Fortune 500 was in the early 1980s thought immune to takeover risk.|$|E
5|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the retreat from Winchester, Matilda rebuilt her court at Devizes Castle, a former property of the Bishop of Salisbury that had been confiscated by Stephen. She established her household knights on the surrounding estates, supported by Flemish mercenaries, ruling through the network of local sheriffs and other officials. Many of those <b>that</b> <b>had</b> <b>lost</b> lands in the regions held by the King travelled west to take up patronage from Matilda. Backed by the pragmatic Robert of Gloucester, Matilda was content to engage in a drawn-out struggle, and the war soon entered a stalemate.|$|E
5|$|In {{the wake}} of the hurricane, the road {{networks}} of the affected countries remained severely disrupted for extended periods of time, hampering relief efforts in badly flooded regions. Government and emergency officials opened shelters and distributed food for the thousands <b>that</b> <b>had</b> <b>lost</b> their homes or sources of income. Throughout Central America and Mexico, 116people lost their lives and 16 others went missing. The disaster left swaths of private property, infrastructure, and farmland in complete ruins, leading to damage costs of more than $170million (1993USD).|$|E

40|$|According to {{incomplete}} statistics, {{the number}} of families <b>that</b> <b>have</b> <b>lost</b> their only child had reached {{more than one million}} in China currently, following an annual increase by 76, 000. The problem of elder care of these families <b>that</b> <b>have</b> <b>lost</b> their only child has become a hot issue in China. Legislation and relevant policies about families <b>that</b> <b>have</b> <b>lost</b> their only child are not suffi-cient, which have caused the lack of basis on establishing a reasonable elder care system of those families.

5|$|The men's tournament {{held at the}} 1920 Summer Olympics was {{organized}} by a committee that included future IIHF president Paul Loicq. The tournament used the Bergvall System, in which three rounds were played. The first round was an elimination tournament that determined the gold medal winner. The second round consisted of the teams that were defeated by the gold medal winner; the winner of that round was awarded the silver medal. The final round was played between teams <b>that</b> <b>had</b> <b>lost</b> to the gold or silver medal winners; the winner of that round received the bronze medal.|$|E
5|$|For example, {{near the}} mouth of the Yangtze, the baiji was a princess <b>that</b> <b>had</b> <b>lost</b> her parents and had lived with her step-father, whom she had longed to get away from. The step-father wanted to trade her since she would have been sold for a great sum of money, but as they were {{crossing}} the river to get to the trader, a storm rolled in, and they were drenched. The step-father, enraged, tried to take her, but she plunged herself into the river. Before being drowned in the river, she was transformed into a dolphin, and swam away from her abusive step-father, who also fell in and was transformed into a porpoise.|$|E
5|$|Possibly {{the most}} famous of all his {{international}} caps came in a match in Glasgow against Scotland in October 1930, in which a depleted Welsh side, unable to call up many of their star players as Football League clubs refused to release them for international duty, became known as 'Keenor and the 10 unknowns'. Ted Robbin's side, playing on a Saturday when the English leagues had a full programme, {{had no choice but to}} play 10 players from either the lower divisions, Welsh League sides or from the non-leagues. The Welsh featured just seven players from Football League sides, with only Keenor and Cardiff teammates Len Evans and Walter Robbins playing in the top two divisions, 3 players from Welsh league sides Cardiff Corinthians, Llanelli and Colwyn Bay and one player from non-league side Oswestry Town. The side featured nine debutants in the line-up, Keenor and Cardiff teammate Len Evans being the only two with previous experience at international level. Wales had previously been forced into a similar situation eight months earlier, in February 1930, when Keenor had played in a severely weakened side <b>that</b> <b>had</b> <b>lost</b> 7–0 to Ireland, Joe Bambrick scoring six times in the game, describing the match as the worst game he had ever played.|$|E

Some companies implemented policies of retaining all of the hourly workers who had previously worked at destroyed facilities with plans to utilize them in the rebuilding. In all, the expenditures for industrial reconstruction were estimated to have been approximately $100 million ($ in today's terms).|$|E

25|$|Most organisms with {{colour vision}} {{are able to}} detect {{ultraviolet}} light. This high energy light can be damaging to receptor cells. With a few exceptions (snakes, placental mammals), most organisms avoid these effects by having absorbent oil droplets around their cone cells.

25|$|In July 1934, the Air Ministry issued Specification B.3/34, {{seeking a}} heavy night bomber/troop {{transport}} {{to replace the}} Handley Page Heyford biplane bomber.

25|$|The {{two largest}} {{powers in the}} Sixth Seimas had vastly {{different}} views on how the land reform should take place. Sąjūdis (and Homeland Union that emerged from it) focused on returning the agricultural land to those <b>that</b> <b>had</b> <b>lost</b> it in the waves of Soviet collectivization and implemented it as a policy when in power before 1992. LDDP, on the other hand, prioritized maintaining the existing levels of production, which meant ensuring that the land stays {{in the hands of}} those who would work it most efficiently. Once in power, LDDP introduced changes to the Law on Land Reform, slowing down the process of restitution and limiting its scope.|$|E
25|$|In 2003, {{highly touted}} but {{unproven}} redshirt sophomore Matt Leinart took over for Palmer at quarterback. Although his first pass {{went for a}} touchdown in a win over Auburn, the Trojans suffered an early season triple-overtime loss to conference rival California in Berkeley. Nevertheless, Carroll guided the team to wins in their remaining games and they completed the regular season 11–1. Before the postseason, both the coaches' poll and the AP Poll ranked USC number 1, but the BCS—which also gave consideration to computer rankings—ranked Oklahoma first, another one-loss team but one <b>that</b> <b>had</b> <b>lost</b> its own Big 12 Conference title game 35–7, with USC ranked third.|$|E
25|$|Since the 2000–01 season, the SM-liiga {{has been}} closed, meaning that relegations and {{promotions}} take place {{only by the}} judgment {{of the board of the}} SM-liiga. The only such promotion took place instantly in 2000. Without the threat of relegation, the weaker clubs were supposed to be able to recuperate and improve. This had, however, a side effect: clubs with a losing record <b>that</b> <b>had</b> <b>lost</b> their hopes of reaching the playoffs often disposed of high-salary star players, letting down their supporters. To counteract this, the playoffs were expanded to the best 10 clubs each season from among the 13 total in the league.|$|E

25|$|In the {{introduction}} of a paper published in 2001, Dr. Juan Carlos Gomora and colleagues at the University of Virginia in Charlottesville pointed out that past studies were often done in isolated neurons <b>that</b> <b>had</b> <b>lost</b> most of their T-type channels. Using cloned α1G, α1H, and α1I T-type calcium channels, Gomora's team found that ethosuximide blocked the channels with an IC50 of 12 ± 2mmol/L and that of N-desmethylmethsuximide (the active metabolite of mesuximide) is 1.95 ± 0.19mmol/L for α1G, 1.82 ± 0.16mmol/L for α1I, and 3.0 ± 0.3mmol/L for α1H. It was suggested that the blockade of open channels is facilitated by ethosuximide's physically plugging the channels when current flows inward.|$|E
25|$|Once the war ended, {{every effort}} was made to inform the {{children}} how many of their family members had been lost in the air raids. Parents began to {{make their way to the}} country towns and retrieve the children. Those families <b>that</b> <b>had</b> <b>lost</b> one parent or the family home took longer, sometimes weeks, before they could locate the waiting child. For children who had lost both parents and all siblings, it could take months before a cousin or an uncle could be found who was willing to take in the child. Orphans, like displaced veterans, became an issue of social welfare and a visible symbol of defeat in the post-war period.|$|E
