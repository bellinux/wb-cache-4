5|$|Antankarana culture shares many common {{points with}} that of their Sakalava neighbors. Their rituals are similar and honor {{many of the same}} ancestors, and members of both groups adhere to many of the same fady, making it {{difficult}} at times to distinguish the two groups from one another. Relations between the two are amicable. In a custom unique to the Antankarana, called the tsangatsaine, two trees growing before the house of a noble family are tied together to symbolize the unity of <b>the</b> <b>community.</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> merger of past with present and the dead with the living. The Antankarana, like many other coastal groups, practice tromba (spirit possession) as a means to commune with ancestors. The royal ancestral spirits that possess tromba mediums are almost always of Sakalava ancestry. It is widely believed that the spirits of the dead often inhabit crocodiles, and it is often fady among the Antankarana to kill these animals. The Antankarana also believe in tsiny, a kind of nature spirit.|$|E
5|$|In 1980 {{the fourth}} bell {{of the ring}} of six was recast, again by the Whitechapel Foundry. By the 1990s the {{internal}} design of the church was beginning to be considered impractical {{for the needs of}} <b>the</b> <b>community,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> interior was remodelled to a design by Robert Potter, with the works carried out in 1999. The west gallery was restored to house the 1852 organ, together with a kitchen and toilet facility, and the north transept was converted into a vestry with a room above it. Underfloor heating was built below a new marble floor and the chancel step replaced by an ovoid raised marble dais. Meanwhile, Scott's pews were removed altogether and replaced by wooden chairs.|$|E
5|$|In addition, {{there are}} several private and Haredi schools in Arad, such as the Shuvu movement's grades 1–8 school, and the Gerrer Haredi school.

25|$|The fourth state reform, {{which took}} place in 1993 under Prime Minister Jean-Luc Dehaene, {{consolidated}} the previous state reforms and turned Belgium into a fully-fledged federal state. The first article of the Belgian Constitution was amended to read as follows, “Belgium is a Federal State which consists of <b>Communities</b> <b>and</b> Regions”. During <b>the</b> fourth state reform, <b>the</b> responsibilities of <b>the</b> <b>Communities</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Regions were expanded again, their resources were increased and they were given more fiscal responsibilities. Other major changes included the direct election of <b>the</b> parliaments of <b>the</b> <b>Communities</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Regions, the splitting up of the Province of Brabant into Flemish Brabant and Walloon Brabant, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> reformation of the Federal Parliament's bicameral system <b>and</b> <b>the</b> relations between <b>the</b> Federal Parliament <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Federal Government. The first direct elections for <b>the</b> parliaments of <b>the</b> <b>Communities</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Regions took place on May 21, 1995.|$|R

5|$|Marquette's {{founding}} settlers {{arrived in}} the area on May 18, 1849, to establish <b>the</b> <b>community,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> original thoroughfares were platted by 1855, including Washington and Front streets. The widest street in the city at , Baraga Avenue {{was intended to be}} the Marquette's main street when the downtown area was originally laid out, but businesses centered their locations along Washington Street instead. The community was incorporated as a village in 1859, and it was later reincorporated as a city on February 21, 1871. The original city hall was built in 1895 on Washington Street, and in 1910, the city started paving its streets, replacing wooden planks with asphalt.|$|E
5|$|On 27 July 2007, the Minister for Local Government {{announced}} a Section 740 inquiry into Port Macquarie-Hastings Council and the Glasshouse project, with particular regard to aspects of financial and project management, the project's {{impact on the}} Council to provide services and amenities to <b>the</b> <b>community,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> openness and transparency of decisions made by the Council. He appointed Frank Willan, a former administrator of Glen Innes Severn Council in 2004, as Commissioner. The mayor expressed disappointment, asserted the methodology of the earlier Section 430 investigation was faulty, and believed the Council's management and decision-making processes would be vindicated.|$|E

5|$|The events {{continued}} to impact upon <b>the</b> <b>community</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> individuals involved. At a federal by-election for the normally safe National Party seat of Lyne in which Port Macquarie is located, the former mayor, {{who was the}} endorsed National candidate, failed to win against Rob Oakeshott, an independent politician, and a former state member of parliament who had been openly critical of the Council throughout the drama. During the period under administration, voluntary redundancies were offered to 27 staff {{in order to improve}} the Council's financial position.|$|E
5|$|After the State of Israel was established, Silverman {{recognized}} the diverse needs {{to build the}} nation and she and Archibald channeled funds into planting orchards, building the Sharon Hotel, and supplementing the Synagogue Centre Building Fund. The Sharon Hotel, built in Herzliya, on the Sharon Plain, {{was part of an}} effort to build infrastructure and develop tourism sites to stimulate further growth. Silverman founded and served the board of the company which created the hotel. In the Jezreel Valley, she chaired a water development company and established a mixed-fruit orchard of around 70 acres of trees. She also was involved in several projects in Rhode Island. In 1955 she founded and served as president of the Friends of Butler Hospital in an attempt to reopen the health center, which had been shut down. They were successful in proving its benefit to <b>the</b> <b>community</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> hospital reopened. In 1957, Silverman served as chair of the fundraising for the Rhode Island Association of Mental Health. By the early-1960s, 33 synagogues throughout Israel had been built through the synagogue fund. During the two years she lived in Israel, she helped erect around 80 additional synagogues and by the time of Silverman's death, the number was over 100 synagogues in Israel and elsewhere.|$|E
5|$|At {{the time}} of its opening, it was the largest mall complex {{developed}} by CBL. In the first year, it was projected that the mall would employee 2,500 employees—instantly making it the largest employer in the city; this was expected to expand to 3,500 with the completion of the second phase. It was hoped it would generate $80 million in sales. In addition to helping to retain local shoppers who might otherwise travel the 2½ hours southeast to Houston for mall shopping, CBL and city officials expected the mall would draw shoppers from around the Brazos Valley. Before its opening, the city did not have a highly developed retail community. With the planned additions, then College Station city manager North Bardell said it was expected to generate $1 million in annual sales tax revenue, nearly equal to what the city collected in the previous fiscal year from all other sales. It would bring in another $120,000 in property taxes, a half-million in taxes for College Station Independent School District, and $1 million in electric bills. The increase in jobs was seen as good for <b>the</b> <b>community,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> city hoped it would attract new civic groups to the area. Taking a year longer than originally planned, the expansion was completed in 1985.|$|E

5|$|In June 2015, Valve {{announced}} that the entirety of Dota 2 would be ported over to their Source 2 game engine in an update called Dota 2 Reborn, making Dota 2 the first game to use the engine. Reborn was first {{released to the public}} as a beta update that same month, and officially replaced the original client in September 2015. Reborn included a new user interface framework design, ability for custom game modes created by <b>the</b> <b>community,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> full replacement of the original Source engine with Source 2. Largely attributed to technical difficulties players experienced with the update, the global player base experienced a sharp drop of approximately sixteen percent the month following the release of Reborn. However, after various updates and patches, over a million concurrent players were playing again by the beginning of 2016, with that being the largest amount of users in nearly a year. The move to Source 2 also allowed the use of the Vulkan graphics API, which was released as an optional feature in May 2016, making Dota 2 one of the first games to offer it.|$|E
5|$|It was {{originally}} built in 1913 {{on the site}} of a local college's recreation ground and was significantly redeveloped twice. The first reconstruction came in the 1930s from which the Art Deco East and West Stands date. There was a second development; the first phase was completed in 1989 which added executive boxes to the Clock End, and afterwards in 1993 a new North Bank Stand was constructed, both following the recommendations of the Taylor Report which replaced the terraces to make the stadium an all-seater with four stands. However, further attempts to expand the stadium were blocked by <b>the</b> <b>community,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> resulting reduction in capacity and matchday revenue eventually led to Arsenal opting to build a new stadium, to become known as the Emirates Stadium in nearby Islington. After the club moved to their new stadium upon the conclusion of the 2005–2006 season, Highbury was redeveloped as a residential development known as Highbury Square, with the Clock End and North Bank stands being demolished; parts of the East and West Stands remained and were incorporated into the new development due to their listed status.|$|E
