40|$|SUMMARY: The {{individual}} {{animals in}} a large batch of European <b>tree-frogs</b> imported into England from Italy {{were found to be}} suffering from what proved to be, with two exceptions, a uniformly fatal attack of typical red-leg. Bacterium alkaligenes was isolated in profusion in pure culture from the heart blood and lymph fluid of all the frogs examined. The strain was highly susceptible to streptomycin, and the only animals to recover were two that were treated with lo 00 units of the antibiotic, in divided doses over 9 days. Red-leg in frogs has in the past always proved to have been due to a bacteraemic infection by Protezls hydrophilw Bergey et al. (see Kulp & Borden, 1942) or to very similar bacilli. This report concerns red-leg due to an entirely unrelated bacterium. Red-leg in <b>tree-frogs.</b> In July 1949, during a search for fresh Pr. hydrophilus strains, I examined a batch of over fifty European adult <b>tree-frogs</b> (Hyla arborea (Linn.)) which had arrived at the London Zoological Society's Gardens from North Italy, packed in a very crowded container.

40|$|Global {{decline of}} {{population}} size and species in amphibians {{during the last}} few decades has been discussed among environmentalists and biologists for possible causes [lJ. Although various factors such as chemical or physical agents affecting environmental integrity have been considered as possible casuses for the decline, no decisive evidence has ever appeared [2 J. Adult anuran amphibians usually do not drink water orally, but intake it mainly through a part of their ventral skin. We have previously shown that Japanese <b>tree-frogs</b> show sexual dimorphism in water absorption in the ventral skin. We examined the influence of an insecticide, methoxychlor, which has been known as an endodrine disruptor in modifying sexual integrity of animals, on the cutaneous water absorption of Japanese <b>tree-frogs.</b> After being kept for one month in water containing methoxychlor, male <b>tree-frogs</b> showed apparent depression of the cutaneous water absorption rate at concentration of 10 - 6 M or higher, but the agent had no effects on the females up to 10 - 5 M. When frogs were brought into a dehydrated environment after being kept in water containing methoxychlor for one month, all animals, males and females, showed a marked depression of the water absorption rate even at a low concentration of 10 - 9 M. These results suggest one possible reason for the severe decline in the amphibian population during 1960 s when the agent had been widely used [3 J, may be due to disability of the water absorption caused by the endocrine disruptors...|$|R

But as you look among them, you see forms utterly new and strange, whose kinship you cannot fancy, but which remind {{you that you are}} nearing Italy, and Greece, and Africa. And in the hedges are great bay-trees; and inside them, {{orchards}} of standard fig and white mulberry, with its long yearling shoots of glorious green--soon to be stripped bare for the silkworms; and here and there long lines of cypresses, black against the bright green plain and bright blue sky. No; you are not in Britain. Certainly not; for there is a drake (not a duck) quacking with feeble treble in that cypress, six feet over your head; and in Britain drakes do not live in trees. You look for the climbing palmipede, and see nothing: nor will you see; for the quacker is a tiny green <b>tree-frog,</b> who holds on by the suckers at the ends of his toes (with which he can climb a pane of glass, like a fly), and has learnt the squirrel's art of going invisible, without 'the receipt of fern-seed,' by simply keeping always on the further side of the branch.|$|E
6000|$|One of {{the most}} curious and {{interesting}} reptiles which I met with in Borneo was a large <b>tree-frog,</b> which was brought me {{by one of the}} Chinese workmen. He assured me that he had seen it come down in a slanting direction from a high tree, as if it flew. On examining it, I found the toes very long and fully webbed to their very extremity, so that when expanded they offered a surface much larger than the body. The forelegs were also bordered by a membrane, and the body was capable of considerable inflation. The back and limbs were of a very deep shining green colour, the undersurface and the inner toes yellow, while the webs were black, rayed with yellow. The body was about four inches long, while the webs of each hind foot, when fully expanded, covered a surface of four square inches, and the webs of all the feet together about twelve square inches. As the extremities of the toes have dilated discs for adhesion, showing the creature to be a true tree frog, {{it is difficult to imagine}} that this immense membrane of the toes can be for the purpose of swimming only, and the account of the Chinaman, that it flew down from the tree, becomes more credible. This is, I believe, the first instance known of a [...] "flying frog," [...] and it is very interesting to Darwinians as showing that the variability of the toes which have been already modified for purposes of swimming and adhesive climbing, have been taken advantage of to enable an allied species to pass through the air like the flying lizard. It would appear to be a new species of the genus Rhacophorus, which consists of several frogs of a much smaller size than this, and having the webs of the toes less developed.|$|E

6000|$|A bad hunter I proved after larger game. Bird and beast despised my snares, {{which took}} me so many waking hours {{at night to}} invent, so many {{daylight}} hours to make. Once, seeing a troop of monkeys {{high up in the}} tall trees, I followed and watched them for a long time, thinking how royally I should feast if by some strange unheard-of accident one were to fall disabled to the ground and be at my mercy. But nothing impossible happened, and I had no meat. What meat did I ever have except an occasional fledgling, killed in its cradle, or a lizard, or small <b>tree-frog</b> detected, in spite of its green colour, among the foliage? I would roast the little green minstrel on the coals. Why not? Why should he live to tinkle on his mandolin and clash his airy cymbals with no appreciative ear to listen? Once I had a different and strange kind of meat; but the starved stomach is not squeamish. I found a serpent coiled up in my way in a small glade, and arming myself with a long stick, I roused him from his siesta and slew him without mercy. Rima was not there to pluck the rage from my heart and save his evil life. No coral snake this, with slim, tapering body, ringed like a wasp with brilliant colour; but thick and blunt, with lurid scales, blotched with black; also a broad, flat, murderous head, with stony, ice-like, whity-blue eyes, cold enough to freeze a victim's blood in its veins and make it sit still, like some wide-eyed creature carved in stone, waiting for the sharp, inevitable stroke--so swift at last, so long in coming. [...] "O abominable flat head, with icy-cold, humanlike, fiend-like eyes, I shall cut you off and throw you away!" [...] And away I flung it, far enough in all conscience: yet I walked home troubled with a fancy that somewhere, somewhere down on the black, wet soil where it had fallen, through all that dense, thorny tangle and millions of screening leaves, the white, lidless, living eyes were following me still, and would always be following me in all my goings and comings and windings about in the forest. And what wonder? For were we not alone together in this dreadful solitude, I and the serpent, eaters of the dust, singled out and cursed above all cattle? HE would not have bitten me, and I--faithless cannibal!--had murdered him. That cursed fancy would live on, worming itself into every crevice of my mind; the severed head would grow and grow in the night-time to something monstrous at last, the hellish white lidless eyes increasing to the size of two full moons. [...] "Murderer! murderer!"

40|$|International audienceInvestigating the {{mechanisms}} underlying female mate choice {{is important for}} sexual-selection theory, but also for population-genetic studies, because distinctive breeding strategies affect differently the dynamics of gene diversity within populations.

Chorus attendance explained approximately 50 % {{of the variance in}} male mating success, but did not correlate with offspring fitness. By contrast, offspring body mass and growth rate correlated with male attractiveness, measured as the number of matings obtained per night of calling. Genetic similarity between mating partners did not depart from random, and did not affect offspring fitness. We conclude that females are able to choose good partners under natural settings and obtain benefits from the good genes, rather than compatible genes, their offspring inherit. This heritability of fitness is likely to reduce effective population sizes below values previously estimated...|$|R

30|$|The {{threat of}} {{wildfire}} to amphibian populations is probably {{greater in the}} Southwest than {{other regions of the}} West. The Southwest is also the region with the highest proportion of imperiled species (Bradford 2005). Persistent drought, large wildfires, and widespread alteration of water bodies (including the presence of non-native amphibians and fishes), combined with an already challenging landscape, magnify the threats to these species (Clarkson and Rorabaugh 1989, DeBano et al. 1998, Sredl and Wallace 2000, Olden and Poff 2005). Comparison of pre- and post-fire data after two large wildfires in southern California revealed that the western toad was detected in fewer plots (using drift fence arrays) in chaparral habitats after they burned, but the capture rate did not change across the study area and toads remained the most common amphibian (Rochester et al. 2010). The distribution and capture rate of the Pacific treefrog (Pseudacris regilla Baird and Girard) in terrestrial plots was not affected by the wildfires in either chaparral or coastal sage scrub habitats. Captures of <b>tree-frogs</b> in stream-side habitats, which may be more relevant to population dynamics, were insufficient to evaluate effects of the wildfires (Rochester et al. 2010).|$|R
60|$|Anura or Batrachia.—With many {{frogs and}} toads the colours evidently serve as a protection, such as the bright green tints of <b>tree-frogs</b> and the obscure mottled shades of many {{terrestrial}} species. The most conspicuously coloured toad which I ever saw, namely the Phryniscus nigricans[40] had the whole upper {{surface of the body}} as black as ink, with the soles of the feet and parts of the abdomen spotted with the brightest vermilion. It crawled about the bare sandy or open grassy plains of La Plata under a scorching sun, and could not fail to catch the eye of every passing creature. These colours may be beneficial by making this toad known to all birds of prey as a nauseous mouthful; for it is familiar to every one that these animals emit a poisonous secretion, which causes the mouth of a dog to froth, as if attacked by hydrophobia. I was the more struck with the conspicuous colours of this toad, as close by I found a lizard (Proctotretus multimaculatus) which, when frightened, flattened its body, closed its eyes, and then from its mottled tints could hardly be distinguishable from the surrounding sand.|$|R
60|$|But {{leaving aside}} these complex {{questions}} and confining {{ourselves to the}} simpler sounds, we can, at least, see some reasons for the association of certain kinds of sounds with certain states of mind. A scream, for instance, uttered by a young animal, or {{by one of the}} members of a community, as a call for assistance, will naturally be loud, prolonged, and high, so as to penetrate to a distance. For Helmholtz has shown[7] that, owing to the shape of the internal cavity of the human ear and its consequent power of resonance, high notes produce a particularly strong impression. When male animals utter sounds in order to please the females, they would naturally employ those which are sweet to the ears of the species; and it appears that the same sounds are often pleasing to widely different animals, owing to the similarity of their nervous systems, as we ourselves perceive in the singing of birds and even in the chirping of certain <b>tree-frogs</b> giving us pleasure. On the other hand, sounds produced in order to strike terror into an enemy, would naturally be harsh or displeasing.|$|R

In the meanwhile, I believe I shall live on here [...] "between the sandhills and the sea," [...] as I think Mr. Swinburne hath it. I was pretty nearly slain; my spirit lay down and kicked for three days; I was up at an Angora goat-ranche in the Santa Lucia Mountains, nursed by an old frontiersman, a mighty hunter of bears, and I scarcely slept, or ate, or thought for four days. Two nights I lay out under a tree in a sort of stupor, doing nothing but fetch water for myself and horse, light a fire and make coffee, and all night awake hearing the goat-bells ringing and the <b>tree-frogs</b> singing when each new noise was enough to set me mad.

500|$|The English {{zoologist}} Edward Bagnall Poulton studied animal coloration, especially camouflage. In his 1890 book The Colours of Animals, he classified {{different types}} such as [...] "special protective resemblance" [...] (where an animal looks like another object), or [...] "general aggressive resemblance" [...] (where a predator blends {{in with the}} background, enabling it to approach prey). His experiments showed that swallowtailed moth pupae were camouflaged to match the backgrounds on which they were reared as larvae. Poulton's [...] "general protective resemblance" [...] {{was at that time}} considered to be the main method of camouflage, as when Frank Evers Beddard wrote in 1892 that [...] "tree-frequenting animals are often green in colour. Among vertebrates numerous species of parrots, iguanas, <b>tree-frogs,</b> and the green tree-snake are examples". Beddard did however briefly mention other methods, including the [...] "alluring coloration" [...] of the flower mantis and the possibility of a different mechanism in the orange tip butterfly. He wrote that [...] "the scattered green spots upon the under surface of the wings might have been intended for a rough sketch of the small flowerets of the plant , so close is their mutual resemblance." [...] He also explained the coloration of sea fish such as the mackerel: [...] "Among pelagic fish it is common to find the upper surface dark-coloured and the lower surface white, so that the animal is inconspicuous when seen either from above or below." ...|$|R
6000|$|A {{remarkable}} {{illustration of}} the wide extension of warning colours, and their very definite purpose in nature, is afforded by what may now be termed [...] "Mr. Belt's frog." [...] Frogs {{in all parts of}} the world are, usually, protectively coloured with greens or browns; and the little <b>tree-frogs</b> are either green like the leaves they rest upon, or curiously mottled to imitate bark or dead leaves. But there are a certain number of very gaily coloured frogs, and these do not conceal themselves as frogs usually do. Such was the small toad found by Darwin at Bahia Blanca, which was intense black and bright vermilion, and crawled about in the sunshine over dry sand-hills and arid plains. And in Nicaragua, Mr. Belt found a little frog gorgeously dressed in a livery of red and blue, which did not attempt concealment and was very abundant, a combination of characters which convinced him that it was uneatable. He, therefore, took a few specimens home with him and gave them to his fowls and ducks, but none would touch them. At last, by throwing down pieces of meat, for which there was a great competition among the poultry, he managed to entice a young duck into snatching up one of the little frogs. Instead of swallowing it, however, the duck instantly threw it out of its mouth, and went about jerking its head as if trying to get rid of some unpleasant taste.[114] ...|$|R
