5|$|Randall {{worked with}} Republicans {{to shift the}} source of federal funds from taxes to tariffs. He {{believed}} the <b>taxation</b> of alcohol spread the burdens of <b>taxation</b> unfairly, especially as concerned his constituents, who included several distillers. He also believed the income tax, first enacted during the Civil War, was being administered unfairly, with large refunds often accruing to powerful business interests. On this point, Randall was successful, and the House accepted an amendment that required all cases for refunds over $500 to be tried before a federal district court. He also worked toward the elimination of <b>taxation</b> on tea, coffee, cigars, and matches, all of which Randall believed fell disproportionately on the poor. Relief from <b>taxation</b> made these items cheaper for the average American, while increasing reliance on tariffs helped the industrial owners and workers in Randall's district, as it made foreign products more expensive.|$|E

30|$|One very {{important}} difficulty which arises when studying these issues is that usually {{the existence of}} a majority winner (i.e., Condorcet winner) is not guaranteed. Voting games over redistributive tax schedules lack in general {{the existence of a}} static equilibrium (see Marhuenda and Ortuño-Ortin [1], Hindriks [2], De Donder and Hindriks [3]). The seminal papers of Romer [4, 5] and Roberts [6] consider only flat rate taxes in order {{to make use of the}} median voter theorem, after imposing some natural additional restrictions. However, the overrestrictive assumption of linear tax schemes does not provide the framework to investigate important issues like the high prevalence of marginal-rate progressive <b>taxations</b> in democracies. Therefore, many authors study the basic problem of voting on income <b>taxations</b> in terms of larger classes of tax functions.|$|R
5|$|In March 2008, Kirchner {{introduced}} a new sliding-scale <b>taxation</b> system for agricultural exports, so that rates fluctuated with international prices. This would effectively raise levies on soybean exports from 35% to 44% {{at the time of}} the announcement. This new <b>taxation</b> scheme, proposed by Minister Martín Lousteau, led to a nationwide lockout by farming associations, with the aim of forcing the government to back down on new tax system. They were joined on 25 March by thousands of pot-banging demonstrators massed around the Buenos Aires Obelisk and the presidential palace. These demonstrations were followed by others at locations across the country that included road blockades and food shortages.|$|E
5|$|In medieval England {{there was}} no clear {{separation}} between the king's household and the treasury. The main sources of royal income were the royal estates, feudal rights (such as feudal aids or feudal reliefs, which derived from the king's position as a feudal overlord), <b>taxation,</b> and fees and other profits from the judicial courts. In 1130, the records of revenues paid into the treasury show that about 40% came from royal estates, 16% from feudal rights, 14% from taxes, and 12% from the judicial courts. By 1194 revenue from the land came to about 37% of the total, about 25% came from feudal rights, <b>taxation</b> raised about 15%, and income from judicial sources about 11%.|$|E

5|$|Palmyra's economy {{before and}} at the {{beginning}} of the Roman period was based on agriculture, pastoralism, trade, and serving as a rest station for the caravans which sporadically crossed the desert. By the end of the first century BC, the city had a mixed economy based on agriculture, pastoralism, <b>taxation,</b> and, most importantly, the caravan trade. <b>Taxation</b> was an important source of revenue for the Palmyrene government. Caravaneers paid taxes in the building known as the Tariff Court, where a tax law dating to AD 137 was exhibited. The law regulated the tariffs paid by the merchants for goods sold at the internal market or exported from the city.|$|E
5|$|Strong, royalty-based {{nation states}} rose {{throughout}} Europe in the Late Middle Ages, particularly in England, France, and the Christian kingdoms of the Iberian Peninsula: Aragon, Castile, and Portugal. The long conflicts {{of the period}} strengthened royal control over their kingdoms and were extremely hard on the peasantry. Kings profited from warfare that extended royal legislation and increased the lands they directly controlled. Paying for the wars required that methods of <b>taxation</b> become more effective and efficient, {{and the rate of}} <b>taxation</b> often increased.
