500|$|In August 2008, The Straits Times {{said that}} Thumboo's [...] "most {{powerful}} legacy" [...] was [...] "spearheading {{the creation of}} a Singapore literature in English", although Thumboo himself downplayed his pioneering role by commenting: [...] "There were not that many people writing in 1965, so you had <b>the</b> <b>feeling</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> had to create something. But you don't stand there and say, 'Look, I am a pioneer'. There is a need to do something, to help go about creating something, and you do it." [...] He compiled and edited some of the first anthologies of English poetry from Singapore and Malaysia, including The Flowering Tree (1970), Seven Poets (1973) and The Second Tongue (1979). He was also the general editor of two multilingual anthologies sponsored by the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) Committee of Culture and Information entitled The Poetry of Singapore (1985) and The Fiction of Singapore (1990). In addition to the collections of poetry already mentioned, he has published two volumes of poetry for children called Child's Delight (1972), and another collection called Friend: Poems (2003). Still Travelling, an anthology consisting of almost 50 poems, was published in 2008.|$|E
500|$|Peter Travers of Rolling Stone {{said the}} film was [...] "the wildest and wittiest Indy of them all". Richard Corliss of Time and David Ansen of Newsweek praised it, as did Vincent Canby of The New York Times. [...] "Though {{it seems to have}} the manner of some magically reconstituted B-movie of an earlier era, The Last Crusade is an endearing original," [...] Canby wrote, deeming the revelation Indiana had a father who was not proud of him to be a [...] "comic surprise". Canby {{believed}} that while the film did not match the previous two in its pacing, it still had [...] "hilariously off-the-wall sequences" [...] such as the circus train chase. He also said that Spielberg was maturing by focusing on the father–son relationship, a call echoed by McBride in Variety. Roger Ebert praised the scene depicting Indiana as a Boy Scout with the Cross of Coronado; he compared it to the [...] "style of illustration that appeared in the boys' adventure magazines of the 1940s", saying that Spielberg [...] "must have been paging through his old issues of Boys' Life magazine... <b>the</b> <b>feeling</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> can stumble over astounding adventures just by going on a hike with your Scout troop. Spielberg lights the scene in the strong, basic colors of old pulp magazines." [...] The Hollywood Reporter felt Connery and Ford deserved Academy Award nominations.|$|E
500|$|Metalholic said 'I’m back…” [...] I can’t {{think of}} a more {{appropriate}} way to flow into the second track “Tragic Magic.” [...] Ronnie Radke is most definitely back {{and he is not}} afraid to tell you so.' This fairly slow tempo song obviously takes a few jabs at Radke’s former band Escape the Fate, but overall is a solid melodic song, [...] The third track “The Drug in Me is You” was the second single and the band’s first video and might I add a very entertaining video. “The Drug in Me is You,” is a nicely constructed musical performance that is just flat out catchy. [...] To me the song is about something most people can relate to, the battle you have with yourself, with your morality, with your demons. [...] We all know that we can be our own worst enemy and the only person that you truly have to blame in many instances is yourself. [...] “Trying to consume, the drug in me is you and I’m so high on misery can’t you see,” evokes <b>the</b> <b>feeling</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> are your own drug, the creator of your misery and if you need to point fingers at someone try looking in the mirror first. [...] “If we are born to die and we all die to live, then what’s the point of living life if life just contradicts?” [...] Questions we all ask when we pick ourselves up off the floor and do the only thing we can do, try again. [...] Life is what you make of it, if you have lost yourself, it is up to you to find your way again. [...] I got all profound there for a second, it happens.|$|E

2500|$|The song [...] "If You Could Read My Mind" [...] {{was written}} in {{reflection}} upon his disintegrating marriage.

2500|$|Dubbed [...] "The Giant Bloody War Game", initial inspirations were {{films such}} as Mel Gibson's Braveheart and {{literature}} such as Glen Cook's The Black Company.

2500|$|Similarly, {{programmer}} Jason Regier explains {{they wanted}} to set the game in [...] "a dark, amoral world where opposing sides are equally brutal and their unity is torn by power struggles within the ranks.

[...] Zartman further states [...] "we wanted to capture <b>the</b> <b>feeling</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> get watching large groups of people clashing on the open field.

2500|$|The film {{received}} a mixed response upon its original release, but {{has earned a}} better reception in later years, becoming a favorite with fans of Henson and fantasy. It currently holds a 72% rating on Rotten Tomatoes. Vincent Canby of The New York Times negatively reviewed the film, describing it as a [...] "watered down J. R. R. Tolkien ... without charm as well as interest." [...] Kevin Thomas gave it a more positive assessment in the Los Angeles Times: [...] "Unlike many screen fantasies, The Dark Crystal casts its spell from its very first frames and proceeds so briskly that it's over before you realize it. You're left with <b>the</b> <b>feeling</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> have just awakened from a dream." ...|$|E

5000|$|Stone {{has also}} {{appeared}} in ads for Coles Supermarkets, Hy-Vee, Bi-Lo, and Great Grains cereal. In 2011, Stone described to GQ Australia his relationship with big supermarkets: [...] "I never even thought about working for a supermarket. But there’s <b>that</b> <b>feeling</b> <b>you</b> get when you {{walk down the street}} and someone comes up and says, ‘You know what? We never used to cook fish in our house.

2500|$|SputnikMusic {{rated the}} album 4 out of 5, commenting, “Ulver {{have taken a}} decidedly more subtle {{approach}} to songwriting and the mood they’re attempting to create, but what a mood it is. <b>The</b> <b>feeling</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> get while listening to this album could best be summed up by the word “serenity”. Granted, it is a somber form of serenity, but the word still fits perfectly.” Adding, “If there are any problems that some may have with this new album {{it is going to}} be the same thing that is going to make others love this album, and that is its subtlety. Whereas on Blood Inside and Perdition City the albums commanded your attention due to their frequent shift from soft to loud sections and their regular use of discordant sounds, Shadows of the Sun will easily fade away from your attention if you don’t give it the awareness it deserves.” ...|$|E
2500|$|Having {{decided to}} marry, Darwin visited his cousin Emma on 29 July 1838 {{and told her}} of his ideas on transmutation. On 11 November he {{returned}} and proposed to Emma. Again he discussed his ideas, and about ten days later she wrote, [...] "When I am with you I think all melancholy thoughts keep {{out of my head}} but since you are gone some sad ones have forced themselves in, of fear that our opinions on the most important subject should differ widely. My reason tells me that honest & conscientious doubts cannot be a sin, but I feel it would be a painful void between us. I thank you from my heart for your openness with me & I should dread <b>the</b> <b>feeling</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> were concealing your opinions from the fear of giving me pain. It is perhaps foolish of me to say this much but my own dear Charley we now do belong to each other & I cannot help being open with you. Will you do me a favour? yes I am sure you will, it is to read our Saviours farewell discourse to his disciples which begins {{at the end of the}} 13th Chap of John. It is so full of love to them & devotion & every beautiful feeling. It is the part of the New Testament I love best. This is a whim of mine it would give me great pleasure, though I can hardly tell why I don't wish you to give me your opinion about it." ...|$|E

It is so full of love to them & devotion & every beautiful feeling." [...] In the Farewell Discourse from the Gospel of St. John, Jesus instructs his disciples to [...] "love one another", a central part of Christian doctrine which emphasises the need for belief. For Emma the importance of faith had been reinforced by the death of her sister Fanny in 1832, and her need to meet Fanny again in the afterlife. She clearly felt that Darwin would be able to overcome doubt and believe. John 15 also says [...] "If a man abide not in me...they are burned". Darwin's warm reply reassured her, and she replied that [...] "To see you in earnest on the subject will be my greatest comfort & that I am sure you are. I believe I agree with every word you say, & it pleased me that you shd have felt inclined to enter a little more on the subject." [...] However, this tension would remain.|$|E

60|$|Indeed. {{in other}} respects, {{you can hardly}} regard any creatures of the deep with <b>the</b> same <b>feelings</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> do those of the shore.

The accursed shark alone can in any generic respect be said to bear comparative analogy to him.|$|R
5000|$|For {{the second}} series, David Renshaw of The Guardian {{said it was}} [...] "a welcome return from the gang", and commented [...] "Despite its larger-than-life characters, People Just Do Nothing’s success lies in its believability ... <b>You</b> get <b>the</b> <b>feeling</b> <b>that</b> if <b>you</b> drove out to Brentford you might {{actually}} run in to them."

60|$|Now conceit is <b>the</b> <b>feeling</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> {{know more}} than any one else. Perhaps you do. Then again, perhaps you don't.

He trotted along behind old Granny Fox and planned smart things to say to her when she found that there wasn't a chance to catch Quacker the Duck.
