50|$|US-built Jeep {{vehicles}} were imported into The Netherlands by S.A. Ateliers de La Dyle under {{an agreement with}} Willys Overland. Once Willys was purchased by Kaiser, the Willys agreement was transferred to NEKAF. In March 1954 assembly of the Jeep CJ-3B started and {{was followed by the}} FC-150, FC-170, the pickup <b>truck,</b> <b>station</b> <b>wagon,</b> CJ-5 and DJ-3A. On 21 January 1955 NEKAF signed a contract with the Royal Netherlands Army to supply 4,000 M38A1 jeeps with the first delivery to the army on 28 May of the same year. The {{vehicles were}} knock down kits imported from the US with some local content as with the 1949 Kaiser assembly. NEKAF delivered an additional 1,624 vehicles to the army through 1959 until production was taken over by Kemper & Van Twist Diesel who delivered another 2,237 jeep vehicles through 1963 although these were still commonly known as NEKAFs.|$|E

2500|$|Vehicles: Cars or {{trucks are}} used as a {{temporary}} or sometimes long-term living refuge, for example by those recently evicted from a home. Some people live in recreational vehicles (RVs), school buses, vans, sport utility vehicles, covered pick-up <b>trucks,</b> <b>station</b> <b>wagons,</b> sedans, or hatchbacks. The vehicular homeless, according to homeless advocates and researchers, make up the fastest-growing segment of the homeless population. [...] Many cities now have safe parking programs in which lawful sites are permitted at churches or {{in out of the}} way places. For example, because it is illegal to park on the streets in Santa Barbara, the New Beginnings Counseling Center worked with the city to make parking lots available to accommodate homeless people.|$|R
5000|$|Powell Manufacturing Company [...] (PMC) was {{a company}} based in {{southern}} California, widely known for its line of motor scooters that peaked in popularity in the late 1940s. From September 1954 to March 1957, Powell manufactured [...] "Sport Wagon" [...] pickup <b>trucks</b> and <b>station</b> <b>wagons.</b> In the 1960s and 1970s, they manufactured the [...] "Powell Challenger" [...] trail bikes.|$|R
50|$|Production was resumed in 1937, and {{continued}} through 1941. Despite {{a wide range}} of Bantam body styles, ranging from light <b>trucks</b> to woodie <b>station</b> <b>wagons,</b> only about 6,000 Bantams of all types were produced.|$|R
50|$|The company {{originally}} began {{operations in}} 1926, and manufactured thousand of radios, then {{moving on to}} build approximately 1,200 pickup <b>trucks,</b> 300 <b>station</b> <b>wagons,</b> and three motor homes, {{and tens of thousands}} of scooters and trail bikes. The manufacturing address was listed as 2914 North Alameda Street in Compton, California, which was two miles south of the General Motors South Gate Assembly factory, and they had a showroom listed at 12700 S. Western Avenue.|$|R
5000|$|Small size Passenger vehicles, {{commonly}} called [...] "5 number" [...] vehicles {{in reference to}} their license-plate prefix. This class is defined as limited to vehicles less than 4.7 m long, 1.7 m wide, 2 m high and with engine displacement at or under [...] Vans, <b>trucks</b> and <b>station</b> <b>wagons</b> (considered commercial vehicles in Japan) in the compact size class receive a [...] "4 number" [...] license prefix. Before 1989, the annual tax rate of normal-size class was more than doubled of this class so that most Japanese cars were built within small-size class requirement. Now the annual tax rate only varies with engine displacement however useful small-size class cars are still popular in Japanese market, and Japanese manufacturers make regular improvements to compact sized products to maximize interior accommodation while remaining within the exterior boundaries.|$|R
50|$|Engineering has {{recommended}} use of tire pressures below maximum allowable inflation levels for all UN46 tires. As described previously, the reduced tire pressures increase understeer and reduce maximum cornering capacity (both 'stabilising' influences). This practice {{has been used}} routinely in heavy duty pick-up <b>truck</b> and car <b>station</b> <b>wagon</b> applications to assure adequate understeer under all loading conditions. Nissan (Pathfinder), Toyota, Chevrolet, and Dodge also reduce tire pressures for selected applications. While we cannot be sure of their reasons, similarities in vehicle loading suggest that maintaining a minimal level of understeer under rear-loaded conditions may be the compelling factor.|$|R
5000|$|General Motors {{introduced}} the front-wheel drive GM4200 platform in 1983 with the introductions of two subcompacts, the Opel Corsa A and the Vauxhall Nova. The platform {{was also used}} by Holden, Chevrolet's Latin American branch, and Buick of China. The platform is still in use today by Chevrolet's Latin American branch for their entry-level models. This platform became very popular in Mexico in 1994, when the model renamed Chevy Swing (4 door) and Chevy Joy (2 door) was imported from Spain. In 1996, the models were built in Mexico and several variantes were offered: a 4-door sedan (called Monza), a 2- and a 4-door hatchback, a pickup <b>truck,</b> and a <b>station</b> <b>wagon</b> (imported from Chile). The popular Chevy went on with cosmetic changes (the C2, introduced in 2004), that included changes to the front end and dashboard, and another redesign in 2009. It was retired after the 2011 model year.|$|R
2500|$|Willys-Overland [...] {{built its}} California factory in Maywood, California, in 1929 {{at the current}} {{location}} of 6201 Randolph Street. Over 900 people were employed at the new $1.5 million assembly plant. Willys-Overland became the second automobile manufacturer to build a major plant in the city. After the United States entered World War II, automobile production for civilians was phased out and in November 1941, automobile assembly at Maywood was stopped. A great many automobile plants were retooled to manufacture war machinery and for three years during the war, the Lockheed Aircraft Corporation rented the plant building from Willys-Overland for that purpose. Equipment was installed for the manufacture of sub-assemblies for Hudson Bombers [...] until the war ended. Willys-Overland began to manufacture the first Jeeps (CJ-2As) for civilians in 1945. As the demand for Jeeps increased, the reconditioning of the plant back to automobile assembly began early in 1947 and by November, Willys was building [...] "West Coast" [...] CJ-2As. By the end of November, 108 Jeeps had been assembled. Jeep <b>Trucks</b> and <b>Station</b> <b>Wagons</b> were incorporated into the West Coast Division's [...] "final assemblies" [...] production lines in 1948. The Maywood plant produced the entire CJ-3A model production duration and about 5% of all CJ-3As were assembled in California. In 1952, Willys-Overland introduced a new post-war model car, the Aero, and they were assembled in both Maywood and Toledo. The entire plant was shut down in 1954.|$|R
