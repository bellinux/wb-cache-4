5|$|In 1909, Richard Richter {{developed}} the first intrauterine device made from silkworm gut, which was further developed and marketed in Germany by Ernst Gräfenberg {{in the late}} 1920s. In 1951, a chemist, named Carl Djerassi from Mexico City made the hormones in progesterone pills using Mexican yams. Djerassi had chemically created <b>the</b> <b>pill</b> but was not equipped to distribute them to patients. Meanwhile, Gregory Pincus and John Rock {{with help from the}} Planned Parenthood Federation of America {{developed the}} first birth control pills in the 1950s, such as mestranol/noretynodrel, which became publicly available in the 1960s through the Food and Drug Administration under the name Enovid. Medical abortion became an alternative to surgical abortion with the availability of prostaglandin analogs in the 1970s and mifepristone in the 1980s.|$|E
5|$|Miss Foster accelerates her plans, {{knowing that}} the Doctor will attempt to stop her. Throughout London, the Adipose begin to spawn and soon number several thousand. The Doctor and Donna prevent total {{emergency}} parthenogenesis occurring, which would have killed those who had taken <b>the</b> <b>pill,</b> and {{the remainder of the}} young Adipose make their way to Adipose Industries. The Adiposian First Family arrive in a spaceship and begin collecting their young. The Doctor tries to warn Miss Foster about her safety, but she disregards him and is killed when the Adipose drop her from their transport beam to her death, to cover their unsanctioned colonization efforts. The Doctor refrains from killing the young Adipose because they are children, to which Donna remarks that his previous companion Martha Jones made him more human.|$|E
5|$|The Glan-y-wern Canal {{was built}} to connect Richard Jenkins' {{colliery}} at Glan-y-wern with the River Neath at Trowman's Hole, an inlet across the mud flats from the main channel of the river Neath, which was later known as Red Jacket Pill. Jenkins obtained a lease to build it from Lord Vernon on 14 August 1788, but died on the same day. Edward Elton took over management of the colliery, and the canal was constructed by 1790, {{although there was no}} actual connection to the river. At Red Jacket, cargos were transhipped from the small boats used on the canal to larger vessels in <b>the</b> <b>pill,</b> which was tidal. The canal remained in use for about 20 years. Elton became bankrupt and died in 1810 after which Lord Vernon, who had leased the land on which the canal {{was built to}} Elton, placed a distraint on the wharves at Red Jacket and on the barges and it became disused.|$|E

5|$|Thyroid hormones {{to treat}} goiters: In 239 BC, Master Lu's Spring and Autumn Annals stated that where water is too light, people suffer {{widespread}} baldness and goiter. It {{was not until}} the 1860 that French physician Gaspard Adolphe Chatin (1813–1901) linked goiter with the lack of iodine in soil and water; iodine was discovered in the thyroid gland in 1896 by German chemist Eugen Baumann, while thyroid extract was used to treat patients in 1890. The Tang Dynasty (618–907) physician Zhen Quan (d. 643 AD), in his Old and New Tried and Tested Prescriptions, stated that the thyroid glands taken from gelded rams were used to treat patients with goiter; the thyroid hormones could be swallowed in pill form (the body of <b>the</b> <b>pill</b> made from crushed jujube pulp) or as a solid thyroid gland with the fat taken off. The Pharmacopoeia of the Heavenly Husbandman asserted that iodine-rich sargassum was used to treat goiter by the 1st century BC (Ge Hong, 284–364, also suggested using a tincture derived from sargassum seaweed in about 340 AD), a treatment later recorded in the West by Italian practrica Roger of Palermo in his Practica Chirurgiae of 1180 AD.|$|E

Kirsty returns with Kane who attacks him and he has to admit they were never together. After Trey Palmer (Luke Bracey) makes advances on Kirsty and Miles supports her, they reconcile. Trey tries to attack Kirsty, but Miles pushes him over, Miles is then under investigation for assault, later Trey drops the charges. Whilst out fishing Miles falls overboard and is nearly eaten by a shark, he discovers Lou De Bono's (David Roberts) body in the process. He promises to look after Nicole after Roman is sent to prison. Miles then decides he wants to try for a baby with Kirsty, she agrees but he is angry when he sees her taking <b>the</b> <b>pill.</b> She says he thought he would leave her, he reassures her this is not the case. Kirsty starts university studying teaching. He resents her for spending time at university with her new friends, he suspects she is having affair. Upon confrontation she admits she is actually pregnant. She is unhappy about it, but agrees to keep the baby. He breaks his promise of keeping the pregnancy a secret, Kirsty starts to feel more at ease about the baby. Kirsty has a series of fits causing her to miscarry.

40|$|A pilled fabric image {{consists}} of sub-images of different frequency components, and the fabric texture and <b>the</b> <b>pilling</b> information are in different frequency bands. Interference from fabric background texture affects {{the accuracy of}} computer-aided pilling ratings. A new approach for pilling evaluation based on the multi-scale two-dimensional dualtree complex wavelet transform (CWT) is {{presented in this paper}} to extract <b>the</b> <b>pilling</b> information from <b>pilled</b> fabric images. <b>The</b> CWT method can effectively decompose <b>the</b> <b>pilled</b> fabric image with six orientations at different scales and reconstruct fabric background texture and pilling sub-images. This study used an energy analysis method to search for an optimum image decomposition scale and dynamically discriminate pilling image from noise, fabric texture, fabric surface unevenness, and illuminative variation in <b>the</b> <b>pilled</b> fabric image. For pilling objective rating, six parameters were extracted from <b>the</b> <b>pilling</b> image to describe pill properties. A Levenberg-Marquardt backpropagation neural rule was used as a classifier to classify <b>the</b> <b>pilling</b> grade. <b>The</b> proposed method was evaluated using knitted, woven, and nonwoven pilled fabric images photographed with a digital camera. <br /...|$|R
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>Pill</b> was {{approved}} by the FDA in the early 1960s; its use spread rapidly in the late part of that decade, generating an enormous social impact. Time magazine placed <b>the</b> <b>pill</b> on its cover in April, 1967. In the first place, it was more effective than most previous reversible methods of birth control, giving women unprecedented control over their fertility. Its use was separate from intercourse, requiring no special preparations at the time of sexual activity that might interfere with spontaneity or sensation, and the choice to take <b>the</b> <b>Pill</b> was a private one. This combination of factors served to make <b>the</b> <b>Pill</b> immensely popular within a few years of its introduction.|$|E
25|$|However, {{when the}} Ministry of Health and Welfare {{approved}} Viagra's use in Japan after {{only six months}} of the application's submission, while still claiming that <b>the</b> <b>Pill</b> required more data before approval, women's groups cried foul. <b>The</b> <b>Pill</b> was subsequently approved for use in June 1999. However, <b>the</b> <b>Pill</b> has not become popular in Japan. According to estimates, only 1.3 percent of 28 million Japanese females of childbearing age use <b>the</b> <b>Pill,</b> compared with 15.6 percent in the United States. <b>The</b> <b>Pill</b> prescription guidelines the government has endorsed require Pill users to visit a doctor every three months for pelvic examinations and undergo tests for sexually transmitted diseases and uterine cancer. In the United States and Europe, in contrast, an annual or bi-annual clinic visit is standard for Pill users. However, beginning as far back as 2007, many Japanese OBGYNs have required only a yearly visit for pill users, with multiple checks a year recommended only for those who are older or at increased risk of side effects. As of 2004, condoms accounted for 80% of birth control use in Japan, and this may explain Japan's comparatively low rates of AIDS.|$|E

25|$|Because <b>the</b> <b>Pill</b> was so effective, {{and soon}} so widespread, it also {{heightened}} {{the debate about}} the moral and health consequences of pre-marital sex and promiscuity. Never before had sexual activity been so divorced from reproduction. For a couple using <b>the</b> <b>Pill,</b> intercourse became purely an expression of love, or a means of physical pleasure, or both; but it was no longer a means of reproduction. While this was true of previous contraceptives, their relatively high failure rates and their less widespread use failed to emphasize this distinction as clearly as did <b>the</b> <b>Pill.</b> The spread of oral contraceptive use thus led many religious figures and institutions to debate the proper role of sexuality and its relationship to procreation. The Roman Catholic Church in particular, after studying the phenomenon of oral contraceptives, re-emphasized the stated teaching on birth control in the 1968 papal encyclical Humanae vitae. The encyclical reiterated the established Catholic teaching that artificial contraception distorts the nature and purpose of sex. On the other side Anglican and other Protestant churches, such as the Evangelical Church in Germany (EKD) accepted the combined oral contraceptive pill.|$|E

40|$|<b>The</b> poison <b>pill</b> is <b>the</b> {{ultimate}} {{defense against}} a hostile takeover. From management 2 ̆ 7 s perspective, {{it is almost}} {{too good to be}} true. Originally, <b>the</b> poison <b>pill</b> was seen as a way to guard against the worst of hostile takeover tactics. It has been successful; <b>the</b> poison <b>pill</b> has virtually eliminated these tactics from the repertoires of hostile bidders. However, <b>the</b> poison <b>pill</b> is extremely potent, capable of preventing all hostile takeovers, regardless of their underlying merit. Thus, <b>the</b> poison <b>pill</b> eventually became <b>the</b> means to employ a just say no defense of resisting hostile takeovers, regardless of the interests of shareholders. The consequences of <b>the</b> poison <b>pill</b> to corporate governance have been tremendous. By severely restricting the market for corporate control, <b>the</b> poison <b>pill</b> has rendered management significantly less accountable to shareholders. This Article argues that the courts should view <b>the</b> poison <b>pill</b> defense with far greater skepticism than they have thus far. At the time <b>the</b> poison <b>pill</b> was first considered, corporate law did not authorize corporations to employ poison pills. Even now, Delaware corporate law, fairly interpreted, does not authorize the use of <b>the</b> poison <b>pill</b> against typical contemporary hostile offers. In short, <b>the</b> poison <b>pill</b> was originally, and remains to this day, an illegitimate defense mechanism. Ultimately, the goal of this Article is to demonstrate that <b>the</b> poison <b>pill</b> is an illegitimate defense tactic that allows management to entrench itself at the expense of shareholders. While it is probably too late to expect the courts to strike down <b>the</b> poison <b>pill,</b> either on ultra vires grounds or otherwise, it is never too late for the courts to re-examine their deferential treatment of poison pills. If courts were to apply fairly the standards of review that they themselves have developed, the mischief currently caused by <b>the</b> poison <b>pill</b> would be greatly diminished...|$|R
