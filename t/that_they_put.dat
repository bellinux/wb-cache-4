5|$|Peribsen's {{choice of}} patron, and his rule during the shadowy {{period of the}} mid Second dynasty, led Egyptologists and historians to search for {{possible}} explanations for both his name and the troubled times he lived in.

5|$|From August 1953, Montalban ceased {{working for}} London Life, {{publishing}} {{her work in}} the magazine Prediction, one of the country's best-selling esoteric-themed publications. Starting with a series on the uses of the tarot, in May 1960 she was employed to produce a regular astrological column for Prediction. Supplementing such esoteric endeavours, she penned a series of romantic short stories for publication in magazines. Throughout the 1950s she released a series of booklets under different pseudonyms that were devoted to astrology; in one case, she published the same booklet under two separate titles and names, as Madeline Montalban's Your Stars and Love and Madeline Alvarez's Love and the Stars. She never wrote any books, instead preferring the shorter booklets and articles as mediums through which to propagate her views, and was critical of those books that taught the reader how to perform their own horoscopes, believing <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>put</b> professional astrologers out of business.|$|E

5|$|The bokuseki style {{developed}} from Song Dynasty calligraphy. It was brought from China to Japan, together with Zen Buddhism, starting with Eisai in 1191. Late-12th century works imported from China were highly regarded in Japan; subsequently Japanese priests began producing their own bokuseki in the 13th and 14th centuries. Later bokuseki {{became part of}} the zen practice and served as meditation help. They were often mounted on hanging scrolls, and displayed in temples and tea rooms. The master of the Japanese tea ceremony Sen no Rikyū considered them crucial to the tea ceremony in the sense <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>put</b> the participants in the right frame-of-mind. Bokuseki gained in importance through the chanoyu in the Muromachi and Momoyama periods. Daitō Kokushi and Musō Soseki, both from the Rinzai school of Zen Buddhism, were the most famous bokuseki masters of the time.|$|E
5|$|Seeing all this, Captain Pierre-Jean Daniel André, {{the head}} of the Marash detachment, {{requested}} additional reinforcements but, due to the indecisiveness of his superior, Lt. Colonel Jean Flye-Sainte-Marie, he was ordered to go to Adana to apprise the division commander, Brigadier General Julien Dufieux, of the situation. Dufieux agreed to send extra men under the command of General Quérette to Marash but by 17 January, when the reinforcements arrived, the French had already lost the initiative: supply convoys in Bel Punar and El-Oghlu had come under attack and a relief column led by battalion commander Major Corneloup had been ambushed. On 21 January, General Quérette summoned the Muslim notables of Marash to his headquarters located at a barracks in the north of the city and presented them with evidence pointing to their complicity in the attacks and demanded <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>put</b> an end to the hostilities. As the leaders departed, Turkish police chief Arslan Toğuz drew out his pistol and fired five rounds into the air, signaling the beginning of the uprising.|$|E
5|$|The pre-show {{match was}} a fatal-four-way {{elimination}} tag team {{match for the}} WWE Tag Team Championship between defending champions The Usos (Jimmy Uso and Jey Uso), RybAxel (Ryback and Curtis Axel), Los Matadores (Diego and Fernando), accompanied by El Torito, and The Real Americans (Jack Swagger and Cesaro), accompanied by Zeb Colter. The match was changed to an elimination style match shortly before it got underway. Five minutes into the match, Swagger forced Fernando to submit to his signature Patriot Lock to eliminate Los Matadores, followed by Cesaro hitting a European uppercut after throwing Ryback in the air then delivering his signature Neutralizer to pin Ryback and eliminate RybAxel at the eleven-minute mark. Later, after Jey Uso threw Cesaro into Swagger, Jimmy Uso tagged in and the Usos landed a double superkick and then a double top rope diving splash on Cesaro to win the match and retain the titles. Swagger blamed Cesaro for the loss and put Cesaro in the Patriot Lock. Colter demanded <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>put</b> their differences aside, but Cesaro put Swagger in the giant swing and then walked off.|$|E

25|$|What {{eventually}} led to Hamilton being defeated for re-election in 1984, was a 1980 reapportionment battle against the Black Caucus, who wanted the reapportionment figured to their advantage. Hamilton felt so strongly they were wrong, that she ended up testifying before the United States District Court for the District of Columbia in 1982. The Black Caucus were so angered by what they {{believed to be a}} betrayal by Hamilton, <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>put</b> Mable Thomas against her in the primary. Hamilton lost to Thomas in the run-off election and never held elected office again.|$|E
25|$|A further major {{component}} of the armed resistance consisted of individuals and groups motivated by anti-communist convictions and persuaded that only an armed engagement could contain increasing terror and prevent an irrevocable communist takeover. Some of the resistance groups were led by ex-army officers and acted in a more coordinated and planned way. It appears <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>put</b> their hope in stirring up a more general armed insurrection, which never came to life. A smaller category of insurgents were Romanian refugees recruited in Europe by the Office of Policy Coordination (OPC), trained in France, Italy and Greece and then dropped in the Carpathians. It seems, however, that most of them, {{not being able to}} create local contacts imperative for survival, were soon captured.|$|E

25|$|Already largely {{present in}} Celtic times, (the Iron age in western Europe started around 800 to 700 BC), the site's {{production}} tremendously increased with the Romans intent on grabbing resources in conquered territories. They ordered {{the construction of}} very large workshops, while private production did not significantly slow down. The means and techniques <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>put</b> to use produced what is called in French « scories à laitier » literally « milk slag » of the same quality than those of modern blast furnaces. Production during the 300 years of Roman occupation is estimated at 80 % of total production of the site, all periods included. This means that in 300 after JC, the ferrier already occupied {{more or less the}} same surface as now. A Gallo-Roman village was most probably built on the hill side.|$|E
500|$|Conversely, Greg Quill of the Toronto Star wrote: [...] "Something's missing here. [...] This is, {{for all its}} lumbering weight, not {{a record}} that {{challenges}} and provokes as Pink Floyd should. A Momentary Lapse of Reason, sorry to say, is mundane, predictable." [...] Village Voice critic Robert Christgau opined: [...] "In short, you'd hardly know the group's conceptmaster was gone – except <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>put</b> out noticeably fewer ideas."

Later, Nelson's attorney renegotiated a settlement with the IRS in which he paid US$6,000,000, although Nelson did not comply with the agreement. Nelson released [...] as a double album, with all profits destined for the IRS. Many of his assets were auctioned and purchased by friends, who donated or rented his possessions {{to him for a}} nominal fee. He sued Price Waterhouse, contending <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>put</b> his money in illegal tax shelters. The lawsuit was settled for an undisclosed amount and Nelson cleared his debts by 1993.|$|E

500|$|From {{the moment}} Wade's arrived in Britain in July Gallows started writing new {{material}} {{to follow up}} to their 2009 album Grey Britain. The ep itself was both written and recorded {{in a short period}} of time. A majority of the music featured on the extended play was written by the band before Wade had joined and <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>put</b> the finishing touches on the record with him. Lee Barratt summarises the ep as a [...] "good release of anger" [...] and that all the band felt [...] "particularly venomous when Wade joined". Just a few months later in November the band made the announcement that the new extended play would be released in early December. After the band's infamous split from Warner Bros the band decided to work on an independent record label for the release, Thirty Days of Night whom they considered as [...] "Gallows family".|$|E
500|$|Although Joseph Jackson {{initially}} {{demanded that}} his daughter's new album be recorded in Los Angeles {{so that he}} could {{keep an eye out for}} her, Jam and Lewis refused. They required the entire production of the album to be done at their own studio in Minneapolis, Minnesota, [...] "far from the glitter and distractions of Hollywood and the interference of manager-fathers." [...] Jam stated, [...] "We required <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>put</b> her in our hands. We had to do it on our turf, with no bodyguards, no star trips and none of Joe Jackson's people hanging around making suggestions." [...] Control was recorded at Flyte Tyme Studios, the site for Flyte Tyme Records, founded by Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis in Minneapolis. [...] "There's a little radiator I used to sit on when we did the Control album," [...] Jackson recalled in 1993. John McClain served as the executive producer.|$|E
500|$|The band {{traveled}} to 47 {{of the lower}} 48 states in a unique 1955 Greyhound Scenicruiser, identified as #472. [...] Each member had his own private space on the bus, a factor they credited {{to the success of}} their intense touring period. Band legend is that they would have {{traveled to}} all of the lower 48 {{had it not been for}} a cancelled concert in Maine that was never rebooked. Quist has stated <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>put</b> about two million miles on the vehicle. [...] The bus was sold in an estate sale following the Montana Band plane crash, and later obtained by a collector in Great Falls, Montana who refurbished it and states that, , it still ran. [...] The same could not be said of the bus during the band's touring years, when breakdowns and maintenance issues were frequent, possibly because of the Montana altitude, irregular driving habits of band personnel, or simply the mileage the bus accumulated.|$|E

500|$|All of {{the music}} was written by Cute Is What We Aim For, while all of the lyrics were written by Hacikyan. Typically, when Hacikyan wrote lyrics he had a melody in mind, which the band fit the music around. Hacikyan {{described}} the album as being about [...] "the everyday ins-and-outs of social cliques. It’s about the pressure <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>put</b> on you, {{to live up to}} something that you’re not, to be somebody that someone else wants you to be." [...] The Academy Is... vocalist William Beckett provides guest vocals on [...] "There's a Class for This," [...] while All Time Low performed group vocals on [...] "Teasing to Please (Left Side, Strong Side)" [...] and [...] "Sweet Talk 101." [...] Hacikyan described Beckett as [...] "definitely an idol of mine." [...] Beckett was unable to come to the studio to record his part as he was on tour at the time. Instead, his part was recorded at the back of a tour bus and sent to the band.|$|E
500|$|Russ Breimeier of Christianity Today {{commented that}} [...] "I've heard lead singer Mac Powell {{and the others}} say <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>put</b> more blood and sweat into their tenth studio album than any {{previous}} effort. It's not just hyperbole, it's a Revelation, and it ranks with their best albums so far", but noted that the album is [...] "briskly paced with 13 songs in just 43 minutes; only the radio single [...] "Call My Name" [...] runs over 4 minutes. That's a good thing in that the album easily holds your attention from one lean song to another, but it deprives Third Day the opportunity to delve into longer instrumental jams or deeper lyrics about the conversations we share with God during the darker times in life". Graeme Crawford of Cross Rhythms gave the album {{nine out of ten}} stars and opined that [...] "the newly slimmed down band deliver a quality record that all Third Day fans will enjoy" [...] and that it [...] "should be investigated by anyone with even a passing interest in rock music".|$|E
500|$|Four of {{the songs}} on Almost There ("Call to Worship", [...] "Cannot Say Enough", [...] "I Can Only Imagine", and [...] "In You") had {{previously}} appeared on the band's independent records. All of the other songs on the album were new songs which had not been recorded before. All {{of the songs}} of the album were written by Millard or the band except [...] "I Worship You", which was written by Kipley and Reggie Hamm. The band included the song after Kipley brought it to them; although the band wanted to write their own material, they liked the song so much <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>put</b> it as the first song on the album. [...] "Bless Me Indeed (Jabez's Song)" [...] was written {{at the request of}} the label, who wanted to capitalize off of the success of the popular Bruce Wilkinson book The Prayer of Jabez. The band did not want to record the song, but eventually acquiesced. MercyMe pushed the label to include [...] "House of God", an upbeat rock song, since they felt that they had been pushed a little too far towards the adult contemporary genre.|$|E
