5|$|Several {{chemical}} tests {{can be used}} to help verify an identification of L.rugosiceps. A drop of ammonium hydroxide solution <b>turns</b> <b>the</b> cap cuticle a reddish color or is unreactive, and yellow or unreactive on the flesh. A drop of dilute potassium hydroxide (KOH) <b>turns</b> <b>the</b> cap surface red, and the flesh yellowish to orangish. Application of iron (II) sulphate solution produces a gray color on the cap surface, and greenish-gray to olive coloration on the flesh.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} table {{shows the}} physical {{statistics for the}} track for the various sports. It contains the competition length (start to finish, excluding braking length), the number of <b>turns,</b> <b>the</b> vertical drop and the average grade.|$|E
5|$|As {{mentioned}} above {{in the section}} on balance, one effect of turning the front wheel is a roll moment caused by gyroscopic precession. The magnitude of this moment {{is proportional to the}} moment of inertia of the front wheel, its spin rate (forward motion), the rate that the rider <b>turns</b> <b>the</b> front wheel by applying a torque to the handlebars, and the cosine of the angle between the steering axis and the vertical.|$|E

5|$|Bond contrives to {{meet and}} have {{a round of golf}} with Goldfinger; Goldfinger {{attempts}} to win the golf match by cheating, but Bond <b>turns</b> <b>the</b> tables on him, beating him in the process. He is subsequently invited back to Goldfinger's mansion near Reculver where he narrowly escapes being caught on camera looking over the house. Goldfinger introduces Bond to his factotum, a Korean named Oddjob.|$|E
5|$|Following a Health {{convention}} held in Springfield, {{the children}} of Springfield (including Bart) are deemed to be overweight. To help them stay in shape, their parents enroll them in pee-wee football. The coach, Ned Flanders, helps keep the team undefeated, but Homer heckles him relentlessly. Ned finally snaps and <b>turns</b> <b>the</b> job over to Homer.|$|E
5|$|Having {{just nine}} <b>turns,</b> <b>the</b> fewest on the Formula One calendar, the circuit offers very few {{low-speed}} sections and gave teams {{an opportunity to}} push their power units to their potential. As in the previous year's event, and {{for the third straight}} event overall, the yellow-banded soft compound tyre were the prime dry selection while the red-banded supersoft compound were the option dry selection. Pirelli also supplied two wet weather compounds: the green-banded intermediate compound and the blue-banded full wet compound.|$|E

5|$|Several {{chemical}} tests {{can be employed}} {{in the field to}} aid in the identification of S.pungens. With an application of a drop of KOH, the flesh will turn vinaceous (the color of red wine), the tubes red, the cap cuticle black, and the stipe cuticle pale vinaceous. With ammonium hydroxide (NH4OH), the flesh becomes very pale vinaceous, and the tubes turn bright red. Iron(II) sulfate (FeSO4) <b>turns</b> <b>the</b> flesh gray, the tubes dark gray to black, and the stipe cuticle light gray.|$|E
5|$|Several {{chemical}} tests {{can be used}} to help identify the mushroom. A drop of ammonium hydroxide solution <b>turns</b> <b>the</b> cap cuticle a greenish to bluish colour. Application of iron(II) sulphate solution causes the flesh to stain a dull bluish-green, while the pores turn golden brown with a drop of dilute potassium hydroxide.|$|E
5|$|Several {{chemical}} tests {{have been documented}} that can help confirm the identify of this species. On the cap flesh, application of formaldehyde <b>turns</b> <b>the</b> tissue pinkish, iron salts result in a colour change to greyish-green, aniline causes a lavender to reddish-brown colour, and phenol a purplish pink to reddish brown. On the cap cuticle, nitric acid causes an orange-salmon colour, sulphuric acid creates orange-red, ammonia usually makes brown, and a potassium hydroxide solution usually makes orange.|$|E
5000|$|I {{have asked}} dozens of bicycle riders how they <b>turn</b> to <b>the</b> left. I have never found {{a single person}} who stated all the facts {{correctly}} when first asked. They almost invariably said that to <b>turn</b> to <b>the</b> left, they <b>turned</b> <b>the</b> handlebar {{to the left and}} as a result made a <b>turn</b> to <b>the</b> left. But on further questioning them, some would agree that they first <b>turned</b> <b>the</b> handlebar a little to the right, and then as the machine inclined to <b>the</b> left, they <b>turned</b> <b>the</b> handlebar to the left and as a result made the circle, inclining inward.|$|R

5|$|Some {{chemical}} tests {{can be used}} to help identify the mushroom. A drop of dilute potassium hydroxide placed on the cap cuticle will stain dark red to blackish, and orange-yellow on the flesh, while ferrous sulphate solution <b>turns</b> <b>the</b> cuticle yellow and then greenish-yellow. Melzer's reagent will turn the flesh dark blue, after the natural bluing reaction to injury has faded.|$|E
5|$|The film often {{features}} shadows, mirrors, windows, and, less so, water. The shadows {{are present}} {{from the very}} first scene where the blinds make bars on Marion and Sam as they peer out of the window. The stuffed birds' shadows loom over Marion as she eats, and Norman's mother is seen in only shadows until the very end. More subtly, backlighting <b>turns</b> <b>the</b> rakes in the hardware store into talons above Lila's head.|$|E
5|$|Back on the highway, an {{ambulance}} crew try to resuscitate Black, {{who has been}} outside his car through the night after his vision of Lee. After he comes to, he realizes this alternate reality was Lee showing him a life without the Millennium Group. However, he is left unsure whether his role within the Group is protecting his family from evil, or exposing them to it. Black seeks out Lee in a refugee camp; meanwhile, Law and his crewmen are also tracking her, conspiring to kill her to avenge their fellow crew. Lee <b>turns</b> <b>the</b> men against each other with her visions, before Black arrives to rescue her. As Black questions her as to the Group's influence, she resumes speaking in her unknown tongue, leaving Black without the answer he seeks.|$|E

5000|$|ON/OFF Control: Typically {{used for}} heating loads or speed control of motors, this control method {{involves}} <b>turning</b> <b>the</b> switch on for n integral cycles and <b>turning</b> <b>the</b> switch off for m integral cycles. Because <b>turning</b> <b>the</b> switches {{on and off}} causes undesirable harmonics to be created, <b>the</b> switches are <b>turned</b> on and off during zero-voltage and zero-current conditions (zero-crossing), effectively reducing the distortion.|$|R
50|$|<b>Turning</b> <b>the</b> {{mode switch}} does not <b>turn</b> on <b>the</b> lasers. A {{recessed}} button {{on top of}} the device is tapped once to briefly <b>turn</b> on <b>the</b> lasers or tapped twice to <b>turn</b> <b>the</b> lasers on until deactivated, either by pressing a third time or by <b>turning</b> <b>the</b> mode switch to off. Additionally, an extra pressure switch can be plugged into the rear of the device and then placed virtually anywhere, limited only by the length of the pressure switch's cord; typically one to two feet. This pressure switch operates {{the same way as the}} recessed button.|$|R
5|$|Briam tells Kamala {{to stay in}} her quarters, but Captain Picard {{allows her}} to travel {{throughout}} the ship, with the unaffected Lt. Commander Data (Brent Spiner) as her escort. This results in a fight nearly breaking out in Ten Forward, when Kamala begins to interact with several miners. The Ferengi seek to bribe Briam to turn Kamala over to them, but he rejects their offer. As he leaves, they attack him, causing him to fall, hit his head, and lose consciousness. The Enterprise <b>turns</b> <b>the</b> Ferengi over to the nearest starbase to stand trial, but Briam is unable {{to participate in the}} ceremony. Kamala helps Picard to take on Briam's role, and the two become close. He seeks to resist her abilities and tells her to be herself, and she explains that the woman he wants her to be is who she actually is.|$|E
5|$|Continuing eastward, {{the drive}} descends down the {{mountain}} toward Copper Harbor. The roadway twists and turns as it alternately climbs and descends several smaller hills along the ridgeline. Along the drive, several viewpoints provide the opportunity to pull off and take in the surroundings. A few of them lie directly adjacent to {{the face of the}} bluff where the mountain quickly rises from the surrounding land. Near the eastern end, there are two sharp hairpin <b>turns,</b> <b>the</b> first of which has a scenic overlook and parking area. This spot overlooks Copper Harbor and the nearby Copper Country Trail National Scenic Byway portion of US Highway 41 (US41) just to the east. From here, the road makes its steep descent down from the ridge, through the second turn and ends at M-26 on the western edge of town.|$|E
5|$|Jonathan and Dio grow up {{and become}} friendlier, but Jonathan {{suspects}} ulterior motives when Dio acts very caring for George, who has been sick for an extended time. Learning that Dario had the same symptoms before he died, Jonathan suspects that Dio poisoned both of them; Dio plans to stop Jonathan from exposing this by killing him with the stone mask. When he tests the mask on a beggar beforehand, it instead <b>turns</b> <b>the</b> beggar into a vampire, who dies due to exposure to sunlight. While investigating the poison, Jonathan befriends the street thug Robert E. O. Speedwagon and learns that Dio acquired it from Wang Chan, a black market merchant. Jonathan confronts Dio, who uses George's blood and the mask to become a vampire. The Joestar estate burns to the ground during the ensuing battle, but Jonathan and Dio survive.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{provides}} {{an outline of}} the changes in linguistics that gave rise to historical pragmatics in the 1990 s and that have shaped its development over the twenty years of its existence. These changes have affected virtually all aspects of linguistic analyses: the nature of the data, the research questions, the methods and tools that are being used for the analysis, as well as the nature of the generalizations and findings that result from these investigations. We deal with the changes in terms of shifts in thought styles and discuss seven different turns: <b>the</b> pragmatic <b>turn,</b> <b>the</b> socio-cultural <b>turn,</b> <b>the</b> dispersive <b>turn,</b> <b>the</b> empirical <b>turn,</b> <b>the</b> digital <b>turn,</b> <b>the</b> discursive <b>turn</b> and <b>the</b> diachronic <b>turn.</b> We also deal with some long-standing, recent or emerging interfaces where historical pragmatics interacts with other disciplines and we discuss some future challenges, such as the multimodality and fluidity of communication and the problem of combining big data with pragmatic micro analyses...|$|R
5|$|Lucasfilm's Industrial Light & Magic (ILM) {{created the}} visual effects sequences. The script called for Willow to restore Fin Raziel (Patricia Hayes) from a goat to her human form. Willow recites {{what he thinks}} is the {{appropriate}} spell, but <b>turns</b> <b>the</b> goat into an ostrich, a peacock, a tortoise, and finally a tiger, before returning her to normal. ILM supervisor Dennis Muren considered using stop motion animation for the scene. He also explained that another traditional and practical way in the late-1980s to execute this sequence would have been through the use of an optical dissolve with cutaways at various stages.|$|E
5|$|Mansfield posed nude for the February 1955 {{issue of}} Playboy, which helped launch her career and {{increased}} the magazine's circulation; Playboy had begun publishing from publishereditor Hugh Hefner's kitchen the year before. In 1964, the magazine repeated the pictorial. Photos from that pictorial was reprinted {{in a number of}} Playboy issues, including: December 1965 ("The Playboy Portfolio of Sex Stars"), January 1979 ("25 Beautiful Years"), January 1984 ("30 Memorable Years"), January 1989 ("Women Of The Fifties"), January 1994 ("Remember Jayne"), November 1996 ("Playboy Gallery"), August 1999 ("Playboy's Sex Stars of the Century"; Special edition), and January 2000 ("Centerfolds Of The Century").

5|$|Poolside: The segment {{opens with}} Donovan on a pier, holding a newspaper. He {{returns to his}} house, strips by the pool and begins reading. Intrigued by {{an ad in the}} back of the paper, Donovan writes a letter in response. After a number of days pass (marked by the cliché device of {{fluttering}} calendar pages), he receives a reply in the form of a package. Inside is a tablet, which he throws into the pool. The water starts to churn and the dark-haired Danny Di Cioccio emerges to Donovan's delight. The two couple by the pool, with each performing oral sex on the other and Donovan penetrating Di Cioccio in a variety of positions. Di Cioccio <b>turns</b> <b>the</b> tables and tops Donovan until Donovan's climax. The scene closes with the two engaged in horseplay in the pool and then walking off together down a boardwalk.|$|E
50|$|Set {{the control}} lever to Addition/Multiplication and reset the display registers. Each <b>turn</b> of <b>the</b> {{execution}} lever adds the number from the sliders to the accumulator.
