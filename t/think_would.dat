Following his death, members of the gay community criticised Chatwin for lacking the courage to reveal the true nature of his illness, which some people <b>think</b> <b>would</b> have raised public awareness of AIDS, as he was one of the first high-profile individuals in Great Britain known to have contracted HIV.|$|E

25|$|The {{original}} Sakura Wars was {{an ambitious}} project {{that many of}} its core staff did not <b>think</b> <b>would</b> be a commercial success. Upon release, it was a critical and commercial success. Riding {{on the success of}} Sakura Wars, Sega greenlit a sequel. The game was co-developed by Red Company and Sega CS2 R, who had produced the original game. Oji Hiroi returned as producer, Shinichi Ito as director, Satoru Akahori as writer, Hidenori Matsubara and Kōsuke Fujishima as the character designers, and Kohei Tanaka as composer. Teruyu Terada, who would later work on the PlayStation 2 remake of Sakura Wars, acted as battle designer.|$|E

[...] During an interview in May 2013, Bird reiterated his interest in making a sequel. [...] "I have been thinking about it. People think that I have not been, but I have. Because I love those characters and love that world," [...] said Bird. [...] "I am stroking my chin and scratching my head.

Crudup plays Osterman in flashbacks as a human and is {{replaced}} for his post-accident scenes with a motion-capture CG version of himself. During filming, Crudup acted opposite his co-stars, wearing a white suit covered in blue LEDs, so he would give off an otherworldly glow in real life, just as the computer-generated Manhattan does in the movie. His body was modeled on that of fitness model and actor Greg Plitt. The crew then 3D-digitized Crudup's head and [...] "frankensteined it onto Greg Plitt's body." [...] Snyder chose not to electronically alter Crudup's voice for Manhattan, explaining the character [...] "would try and put everyone as much at ease as he could, instead of having a robotic voice that I <b>think</b> <b>would</b> feel off-putting." ...|$|E
500|$|During the battle, the British had {{captured}} General John Sullivan. [...] Admiral Howe {{convinced him to}} deliver a message to Congress in Philadelphia, and released him on parole. [...] Washington also gave his permission, and on September 2 Sullivan told the Congress that the Howes wanted to negotiate, and had been given much broader powers to treat than those they actually held. [...] This created a diplomatic problem for Congress, which {{did not want to}} be seen as aggressive, which is how some representatives felt a direct rejection of the appeal would appear. [...] Consequently, Congress agreed to send a committee to meet with the Howes in a move they did not <b>think</b> <b>would</b> bear any fruit. [...] On September 11, the Howe brothers met with John Adams, Benjamin Franklin, and Edward Rutledge in the Staten Island Peace Conference. [...] It had exactly the outcome the Americans expected.|$|E

500|$|Explaining how Ben Stiller {{came to be}} cast in {{the role}} of Greg, Roach states: [...] "I saw Meet the Parents as an anxiety dream, and in my view nobody plays that kind of {{material}} better than Ben." [...] Additionally, Roach was impressed with Stiller's creative and ad lib abilities stating that [...] "he has lots of great ideas and he's very skilled at loose improvisation." [...] Stiller's character Gaylord [...] "Greg" [...] Focker is a nurse who loves his girlfriend and tries desperately to impress her parents by any means which includes telling harmless little lies which are then covered up with bigger lies and elaborate cover-up schemes. The film's script was initially written with Jim Carrey {{in the role of}} Greg and contained much more physical comedy, something that Stiller did not <b>think</b> <b>would</b> be successful with himself playing the role. This resulted in deletion of some scenes but also in introduction of at least one unscripted scene that was completely improvised by Stiller. Roach cast Stiller only after it became clear that Carrey would not be taking on the role.|$|E
500|$|The film's ending {{was changed}} shortly before its {{theatrical}} release. Originally, Burrows's character would escape the shark infested water and live. However, the test audience, {{who saw the}} film {{less than a month}} before its release, disapproved of the ending because she was behind the shark experiments and was seen as the film's villain. As a result, the production team did a one-day reshoot in the Universal Studios tank and did some computer generated work on the sharks to change it. In 2009, Harlin explained that Deep Blue Sea was the hardest film he had ever made because most of the shooting days involved the team standing in water or being under water for long periods. According to him, [...] "Just the practicality of putting a wet suit on in the morning, being in the water all day. Your script, all your paperwork has to be made of plastic paper. And things that you wouldn't <b>think</b> <b>would</b> ever float, they float. [...] Or then things that you hope would float actually sink and you can't find them anywhere." ...|$|E
500|$|At the 2014 Hero Complex Film Festival, Sigourney Weaver {{hinted that}} she'd be {{interested}} in returning {{to the role of}} Ripley, stating that Resurrection's ending [...] "feels incomplete to me. I wish it didn't, but it does. We left it hanging. And there's a way to finish this story that i <b>think</b> <b>would</b> be satisfying to me and the many fans." [...] She also stated regarding the hybrid character that [...] "Had we done a fifth one, I don't doubt that her humanity would have prevailed. I do feel like there is more story to tell. I feel a longing from fans for the story to be finished. I could imagine a situation where we finish telling the story." [...] She was quoted: [...] "I don't think Alien belongs on Earth popping out of a haystack, which is where I was afraid it was going to go. I feel it should take place in {{the far reaches of the}} universe where no one in their right mind would go. There are very few filmmakers that I can think of that I would want to entrust this to." ...|$|E

500|$|As {{indicated}} by the title, air, skies and wings are important themes: Yukito is searching for the [...] "girl in the sky", and Misuzu believes that her other self is flying in the sky above her. Other characters show a similar relationship to the sky, such as Minagi {{who is a member}} of the astronomy club,Translated quote: [...] "...There's still club activities...the astronomy club." [...] and Michiru who has a fondness for bubbles that float in the air. Kano wants wings to fly, and Kanna already has them. Misuzu names a crow she finds —Japanese for [...] "sky". Another major theme is the maternal bond, as the four heroines' stories, as well as Yukito's, revolve around their mothers, either biological or adoptive. Main scenario writer Jun Maeda commented that he prefers to include mothers in games if given the choice between only including a mother or a father, as is what happened with Air, though he backs this up by noting that in bishōjo games, women are the main focus anyway. Complicated relationships involving family members and friends play a key part throughout the story. One of the sub-themes in the story is magic.Translated quote: [...] "If you could use sorcery, what do you <b>think</b> <b>would</b> happen?" [...] Uraha, Yukito's mother,Translated quote: [...] "I had inherited the ability to control puppets without touching them from my mother." [...] and Yukito himselfTranslated quote: A power that can move a puppet without touching it. To me, it's a power that's nothing out of the ordinary. But if I had to explain it to this girl using terminology she knew.....it's a kind of magic." [...] have the ability to use magic, though Yukito is the least skilled among them. Kano was told by her sister that when she grows up and takes off her yellow ribbon, she will gain the power to do magic. However, the problems of parents leaving their offspring and poverty are displayed realistically.|$|E
2500|$|Gibson {{made the}} unusual {{transition}} from action to classical drama, playing William Shakespeare's Danish prince in Franco Zeffirelli's Hamlet. Gibson was cast alongside experienced Shakespearean actors Ian Holm, Alan Bates, and Paul Scofield. He compared working with Scofield to being [...] "thrown {{into the ring}} with Mike Tyson". Scofield said of Gibson [...] "Not the sort of actor you'd <b>think</b> <b>would</b> make an ideal Hamlet, but he had enormous integrity and intelligence." ...|$|E
2500|$|The issue {{resulted}} in an awkward confrontation when U.S. Defense Secretary Robert McNamara and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, General Maxwell Taylor, traveled to Vietnam for a fact-finding mission about {{the progress of the}} war. [...] One of the purposes of the mission was to achieve, in the words of President Kennedy, [...] "a visible reduction in influence of Nhus, who are symbol to disaffected of all that they dislike in GVN.

2500|$|If a {{government}} loses a [...] "non-confidence" [...] motion traditionally the Prime Minister {{will ask the}} Governor General to call an election.
