40|$|Out-group <b>trust</b> is {{a crucial}} driver of {{international}} business performance. However, employees from different countries vary in their levels of out-group <b>trust.</b> The {{aim of this study}} is therefore to capture national forces driving out-group <b>trust.</b> Based on Kramer's theorizing on the multiple bases of <b>trust,</b> we argue that, at the societal level, dispositional, categorization-based and rule-based <b>trust</b> influence employees' out-group <b>trust.</b> In particular, we argue for dispositional and rule-based societal <b>trust</b> to increase, and for categorization-based societal <b>trust</b> to decrease employees' out-group <b>trust</b> through different types of socialization. Using data on 25, 622 employees from 42 countries, we find partial support for the coexistence of these bases of societal <b>trust.</b> Disentangling trust-forming and trust-impeding models, we find support for dispositional and rule-based societal <b>trust</b> as drivers of employees' out-group <b>trust,</b> and for categorization-based societal <b>trust</b> as impeding employees' out-group <b>trust.</b> In a combined model, however, rule-based <b>trust</b> is not significantly related to employees' out-group <b>trust.</b> Considering the coexistence of <b>trust</b> and distrust, employees' out-group <b>trust</b> develops through socialization effects conveying general <b>trust</b> in others (i. e., high dispositional <b>trust)</b> and the equality of social groups (i. e., low categorization-based <b>trust).</b> Department of Applied Social Science...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT Integrating the typologies of <b>trust</b> {{dimensions}} and <b>trust</b> ideal-types {{with the new}} typologies of <b>trust</b> forms and <b>trust</b> bases, I propose a geocentric framework of <b>trust</b> {{in general and of}} organizational <b>trust</b> in particular. The typology of <b>trust</b> forms is built on the dimension of spatial strength to address the content of <b>trust</b> building from weak <b>trust</b> to strong <b>trust</b> and on the dimension of temporal stage to address the process of <b>trust</b> building from initial <b>trust</b> to mature <b>trust.</b> The typology of <b>trust</b> bases is built on the dimension of <b>trust</b> sources to address the bases of <b>trust</b> building from depersonalized sources to personalized sources and on the dimension of <b>trust</b> domains to address the bases of <b>trust</b> building from dyad domains to network domains. Together with its three pillars (trust-building mechanisms, leadership and trust-as-choice), the central theme of <b>trust</b> building connects all four <b>trust</b> typologies toward a geocentric framework that integrates and transcends the cultural values of the East and the West. This framework bears a special implication for theorizing about transaction cost and transaction value as a duality for interorganizational alliance...|$|R

40|$|Three {{experiments}} investigating how {{a possible}} causal relationship works between vertical <b>trust</b> (i. e., <b>trust</b> in authorities) and horizontal <b>trust</b> (i. e., <b>trust</b> in others) are reported. In Experiment 1, 40 undergraduate students read {{and responded to}} several scenarios describing fictitious events in a foreign society. Based on their effects on <b>trust,</b> the scenarios were hypothesized to be grouped into the following four categories; positive effects on vertical <b>trust,</b> negative effects on vertical <b>trust,</b> positive effects on horizontal <b>trust,</b> and negative effects on horizontal <b>trust.</b> In different participant groups, subsequent to each scenario, participants’ levels of vertical or horizontal <b>trust</b> were assessed. As hypothesized, different scenarios had reliable effects on the two forms of <b>trust.</b> In Experiment 2, 64 undergraduates read the most effective scenarios from Experiment 1 and responded to how participants’ levels of vertical and horizontal <b>trust</b> were affected by the scenarios. Results supported the hypothesized causal relationship from vertical to horizontal <b>trust</b> when <b>trust</b> levels were decreased, but not when <b>trust</b> levels were increased. Results of Experiment 3, where another 48 undergraduates participated, verified that {{the strength of the}} causal effect of vertical <b>trust</b> on horizontal <b>trust</b> depends on whether <b>trust</b> is increased or decreased. In conclusion, the results from the three experiments indicate that increased vertical <b>trust</b> has positive effects on horizontal <b>trust,</b> decreased vertical <b>trust</b> has smaller negative effects on horizontal <b>trust,</b> and horizontal <b>trust</b> has no effects on vertical <b>trust...</b>|$|R
