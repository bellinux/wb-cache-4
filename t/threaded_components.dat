50|$|Anodizing is {{also used}} to prevent galling of <b>threaded</b> <b>components</b> and to make {{dielectric}} films for electrolytic capacitors. Anodic films are most commonly applied to protect aluminium alloys, although processes also exist for titanium, zinc, magnesium, niobium, zirconium, hafnium, and tantalum. Iron or carbon steel metal exfoliates when oxidized under neutral or alkaline microelectrolytic conditions; i.e., the iron oxide (actually ferric hydroxide or hydrated iron oxide, also known as rust) forms by anoxic anodic pits and large cathodic surface, these pits concentrate anions such as sulfate and chloride accelerating the underlying metal to corrosion. Carbon flakes or nodules in iron or steel with high carbon content (high-carbon steel, cast iron) may cause an electrolytic potential and interfere with coating or plating. Ferrous metals are commonly anodized electrolytically in nitric acid or by treatment with red fuming nitric acid to form hard black ferric oxide. This oxide remains conformal even when plated on wire and the wire is bent.|$|E

Hexavalent chromium is a carcinogenic material so its use is limited or prohibited by environmental regulations in several countries, such as the United States and the European Union.

H 1 -NMR (proton nuclear magnetic resonance) studies of ?-methacryloxypropyltrimethoxysilane (MPS) hydrolysis provide the optimal conditions for silane application onto substrates. Analysis of silane layers over zinc coatings was performed by means of Fourier Transform Infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopy. In addition, single lap shear tests were used to compare the strength of anaerobic adhesive joints on Zn-coated specimens with different surface treatments. NMR shows that maximum hydrolysis of MPS takes place at 150 min. Adhesive joints prepared using MPS coatings after this hydrolysis time give maximum shear strength. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersio...|$|E

40|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} trends in development of machine engineering is to improve load capacity of mechanisms, assemblies and parts without increasing their overall dimensions and weight. This is also relevant to the most promising items so far, i. e. orbital roller drives (ORD), which are the rotational-to-progressive motion converters widely used in vehicles. The previously published article suggested increasing a load capacity (by about 15 %) through reducing a thread turn section angle of the threaded ORD components and change of the radius of roller thread turn section outline. Due to such ORD modification, a number {{of the most}} critical ORD parameters are to be changed thereby demanding further research. Further, the article published suggests a method considering the abovementioned changes to calculate the dimensions of ORD main components and their tolerance ranges. Though this method being not complete as the increment of ORD center-to-center spacing in relation to its rated value, required for assembly, is unknown; and to determine the ORD center-to-center spacing increment, outer diameters of the roller and screw threads are to be known. Hence, these two methods are interconnected. This article presents the numerical calculation method, mathematical support and method to determine the increment of ORD center-to-center spacing and initial contact point of the mating roller and screw thread turns. Due to considerable scope of calculations, the method was turned into the software. Similar calculation methods and techniques were developed to a particular case, where the thread turn section angle of the <b>threaded</b> <b>components</b> was of 90 °, and the roller thread turn section outline was a circular arc centered to the roller axis. Hence the developed numerical calculation method, mathematical support and technique refer to the general case which is to determine the ORD center-to-center spacing increment and initial contact point of the mating roller and screw thread turns. Taking this into account, the calculations for a particular case were performed as test calculations during the software development. The results obtained matched the calculation results for a particular case published in several papers. Using a developed calculation technique, the calculation method to determine dimensions of ORD main components and their tolerance ranges may be completed for a general case considering the arbitrary turn section angle of threaded ORD components and radius of roller thread turn section outline. </p...|$|E
40|$|SPERT I: The {{characteristics}} of the boiling process and its relatin to moderator expulsion in Spert I were investigated {{in a series of}} capsule type experiments. A fuel-bearing oapsule, instrumented to provide pressure, volume, and temperature data during transient power excursions, was placed in a high flux region of the Spert I P core. Five step-induced transients initiated from boiling indicate that the kinetic behavior of the stainless steel clad P- 18 / 19 core is dependent on initial temperature {{in a manner similar to}} that of previously tested aluminum clad spert cores. Reactivity oscillator techniques were used in the P- 18 / 19 core to determine the phase and magnitude of the reactivity-to-power transfer function from 0. 01 to 18. 4 cps at low power and at temperatures below boiling. Criticality data on relatively simple lattices, both rod-free and containing a single poison rod, were obtained from a series of clean critical experiments performed on a number of light water-moderated and - reflected slab configurations of Spert III fuel elements. Changes in water height during the critical water height experiment were measured to plus or minus 0. 0013 inches by means of a simple remoteindicating system designed and built for this purpose. SPERT III: The operational loading was determined to be 44 fuel assemblies and 8 control rods. Experiments revealed that this loading provides about. 50 excess at 2500 psi ard 650 deg C and a total rod worth above ambient critical of about. 50. Measurements were made of the pressure and temperature coefficients of reactivity and the temperature defect. Apparatus for non-nuclear engineering tests was installed and the tests were initiated to obtain data on core hydraulics, system energy balance, and general plant equipment. A primary coolant sampling station has been added. Experimental apparatus for void experiments was designed and fabrication started. DATA REDUCTION AND INTERPRETATION: A review of previous investigations of boiling and its relation to shutdown effects was made in pursuance of a photographic investigation of shutdown mechanisms. A photographic technique was developed for conducting tests in a fuel-bearing, water-filled test cell in Spert I. A machine program using computed reactivity as input data was used to obtain power solutions tc the kinetics equations. Comparison of the computed and experimental power burst shapes showed the reactivity data and power data to be consistent and in this way has essentially verified the independent program for reactivity calculations.

40|$|This study aims at {{analyzing}} the phenomena which characterize threaded connections. This type of joint {{has been known}} for thousands years (one of the first applications is attributable to Archimedes) allows transforming a torque into an axial force, typically used to lock two or more components thanks to the friction forces that arise between the connected bodies. One of the main strengths of this type of coupling is the possibility to assemble and disassemble the assembled parts; in addition, it can be applicable to almost any type of material. However, the joint system is characterized by a low efficiency: only a modest amount of the tightening torque is actually converted into axial force. In addition, the obtained axial force is typically affected by a large scatter. This behavior is due to the combined effect of two different friction effects that arise between the under-head of the screw (or nut) and the surface of the elements to be locked in the first case, and between the screw threads and female screw in the second one. The relationship between tightening torque and preload axial force is very sensitive to the effect of the various friction coefficients that rule the tribological behavior of the joint:, these coefficients have a significant variability due to the processes used to manufacture the components, and to the different tightening parameters, such as the presence of lubrication or the tightening speed. Threaded connections do have a wide array of applications, both in the field of civil engineering and in mechanics. For instance, in the automotive compartment, due to a steadily growing strive towards weight reduction and increased automation of assembly procedures, an accurate knowledge of the performance of threaded connections has recently become critical in order to achieve the safety of the junction at an adequate production cost. In order to control a threaded connection, it is necessary to focus on the three main factors that characterize its behavior: the coefficients of friction at tightening, the self-relaxation phenomenon (decrease of axial preload in the first few seconds after tightening, due to sinking of the load bearing area in the clamped parts), self-loosening (loss of axial preload, typically due to the action of external shearing forces). In the following, literature review will be presented first, then it will be shown an experimental investigation on the effect of solid lubrication on the friction coefficients, carried out for repeated tightenings and different surface treatments. Moreover, the effect of the number of engaged threads on the performance of an anaerobic threadlocking adhesive will be examined. The need for these analyses arose from the study of an in-field failure occurred in a pinion shaft of a transmission for earth moving machines, which, as it will be shown in the following, probably failed due to a combination of the aforementioned typical issues of <b>threaded</b> <b>components.</b> The research has the aim of increasing the knowledge about the effect of lubrication on the different phenomena that contribute to determining the performance of a bolted connection...|$|E
