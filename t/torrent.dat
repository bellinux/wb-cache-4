50|$|Through his {{connections}} with agency Seleciones Illustrada, <b>Torrents</b> began working for American company Warren Publishing in 1972. For them, he drew 42 stories until 1979. The {{majority of his}} work appeared in Vampirella, with 8 stories done for Creepy and one story done for Eerie. <b>Torrents</b> drew primarily stand-alone stories except for a three part series titled Fleur and a single story where he drew Vampirella herself. <b>Torrents</b> also worked for Warren competitor Skywald {{for a period of}} time in the early 1970s. After leaving Warren, <b>Torrents</b> retired from the comic book industry.|$|R
5|$|Reaching the cascade, {{or rather}} cataract, the roaring {{of which had}} a long time {{announced}} its vicinity, my soul was hurried by the falls into a new train of reflections. The impetuous dashing of the rebounding <b>torrent</b> from the dark cavities which mocked the exploring eye, produced an equal activity in my mind: my thoughts darted from earth to heaven, and I asked myself why I was chained to life and its misery? Still the tumultuous emotions this sublime object excited, were pleasurable; and, viewing it, my soul rose, with renewed dignity, above its cares – grasping at immortality – it seemed as impossible to stop the current of my thoughts, as of the always varying, still the same, <b>torrent</b> before me – I stretched out my hand to eternity, bounding over the dark speck of life to come.|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} the train reached Eccles, the day's drizzle had been {{replaced}} by a storm. The doctors carried Huskisson, still on his door, off the train into a <b>torrent</b> of hail and thunder and walked the few hundred yards to the vicarage, frequently losing their footing as they climbed the deep cutting. Meanwhile, Stephenson and Wilton restarted the train and went on to Manchester to fetch medical assistance.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{the ban on}} {{broadcasting}} {{the series}} in Victoria, Victorians were still able to access episodes via illegal online distribution. The first episode was made available on <b>torrent</b> sites within 20minutes of it concluding in New South Wales. The Nine Network reportedly obtained the IP address of {{the first person to}} upload the show, and network lawyers were considering legal action. The Australian Federation Against Copyright Theft (AFACT) was investigating the matter, and was expected to make a list of recommendations to Victoria Police. Fears of inside leaks were aroused when advance screener versions of the first eight episodes were posted online.|$|E

5|$|The first metagenomic studies {{conducted}} using high-throughput sequencing used massively parallel 454 pyrosequencing. Three other technologies commonly applied to environmental sampling are the Ion <b>Torrent</b> Personal Genome Machine, the Illumina MiSeq or HiSeq and the Applied Biosystems SOLiD system. These techniques for sequencing DNA generate shorter fragments than Sanger sequencing; Ion <b>Torrent</b> PGM System and 454 pyrosequencing typically produces ~400bp reads, Illumina MiSeq produces 400-700bp reads (depending on whether paired end options are used), and SOLiD produce 25-75bp reads. Historically, these read lengths were significantly {{shorter than the}} typical Sanger sequencing read length of ~750bp, however the Illumina technology is quickly coming close to this benchmark. However, this limitation is compensated for by the much larger number of sequence reads. In 2009, pyrosequenced metagenomes generate 200–500megabases, and Illumina platforms generate around 20–50gigabases, but these outputs have increased by orders of magnitude in recent years. An additional advantage to high throughput sequencing is that this technique does not require cloning the DNA before sequencing, removing {{one of the main}} biases and bottlenecks in environmental sampling.|$|E

Yonekura was aware that the Australians had reached Kaiapit but his main concern {{was not to be}} caught in the open by Allied aircraft. Spotting Australian positions in the pre-dawn light, the Japanese column opened fire. A <b>torrent</b> of fire descended on the Australians, who replied sporadically, attempting to conserve their ammunition. Although he was running low on ammunition, King launched an immediate counter-attack on the Japanese, which took them by surprise.|$|E
40|$|Private BitTorrent {{community}} {{is becoming increasingly}} popular, and generates {{a huge amount of}} Internet traffic. In this paper, we present a thorough measurement study on a famous private BitTorrent community, CHDBits. We find that the content of <b>torrents</b> published in this community are highly available, although many <b>torrents</b> may have been released for a very long time, and we also obtain that users in most <b>torrents</b> could download at a high rate. By studying user profiles, we show that many users have participated in multiple <b>torrents,</b> thereby generating a great amount of upload and download traffic. The user profiles also reveal that almost all users maintain a high share ratio, and are willing to contribute to content distribution by spending more time in seeding than in leeching (downloading). Our study suggests that the bandwidths of a user {{have a significant impact on}} their behavior. Low bandwidth users are more likely to participate in the <b>torrents</b> with a smaller content size or a higher popularity; compared with low bandwidth users, high bandwidth users tend to participate in more <b>torrents,</b> but spend much less time in seeding.

5|$|A {{coincidental}} upswing in {{the fortunes}} of several studios was publicly explained by Code proponents such as the Motion Picture Herald as proof positive that the code was working. Another fortunate coincidence for Code supporters was the <b>torrent</b> of famous criminals such as John Dillinger, Baby Face Nelson, and Bonnie and Clyde that were killed by police shortly after the PCA took power. Corpses of the outlaws were shown in newsreels around the country, alongside clips of Al Capone and Machine Gun Kelly in Alcatraz. Among the unarguably positive aspects of the Code being enforced was the money it saved studios in having to edit, cut, and alter films to get approval from the various state boards and censors. The money saved was in the millions annually. A spate of more wholesome family films featuring performers such as Shirley Temple took off.|$|E
5|$|A lack {{of field}} {{observations}} limit our knowledge, but intraspecific conflicts {{are known to}} sometimes result in injury or death. The screamers (Anhimidae), some jacanas (Jacana, Hydrophasianus), the spur-winged goose (Plectropterus), the <b>torrent</b> duck (Merganetta) and nine species of lapwing (Vanellus) use a sharp spur on the wing as a weapon. The steamer ducks (Tachyeres), geese and swans (Anserinae), the solitaire (Pezophaps), sheathbills (Chionis), some guans (Crax) and stone curlews (Burhinus) use a bony knob on the alular metacarpal to punch and hammer opponents. The jacanas Actophilornis and Irediparra have an expanded, blade-like radius. The extinct Xenicibis was unique in having an elongate forelimb and massive hand which likely functioned in combat or defence as a jointed club or flail. Swans, for instance, may strike with the bony spurs and bite when defending eggs or young.|$|E
5|$|Alejo Carpentier {{grew up in}} Havana, Cuba and {{was born}} on December 26, 1904 in Lausanne, Switzerland. He {{subsequently}} moved to France in 1933 (at the age of 29) and returned to Cuba six years later, in 1939. Once in Cuba, Carpentier joined {{a group of young}} writers whose goal was to establish a literature faithful to the New World, by recovering origins, history, and tradition. In 1943, he travelled to Haiti, where he was made aware of Dominique Hyppolyte's play, Le <b>Torrent,</b> about the Haitian Revolution, which features a character named Ti Noel. As The Kingdom of This World coincides with Carpentier's return to Cuba, it is very much influenced by the author's re-encounter with himself and his origins.|$|E

5|$|Amid a <b>torrent</b> of Japanese fire, the Australians broke {{contact and}} made for the landing craft, {{bringing}} the wounded out with them. The embarkation took only five minutes, but as the vessels attempted to depart two of them, overloaded with about 60 men on board, ran aground and stuck fast. In an effort to lighten the load, several men volunteered to leave the craft, which enabled one of the vessels to float free. The other, however, remained stuck. Coming under attack from the Japanese, some of whom waded out and attacked {{the men in the}} vessel with grenades, the casualties mounted, with a number of men, including Downs, being either killed or lost overboard and subsequently listed as missing, presumed killed.|$|E
5|$|The {{failure of}} Unternehmen Wacht am Rhein {{marked the end}} of Model's special {{relationship}} with Hitler, who on 21 January 1945 issued an order that all the divisions of Army Group B would thenceforth be personally responsible to him to limit Model's operational freedom of decision. Any suggestion of its withdrawal back to the river Rhine to obtain a better fighting position - given the Third Reich's weakening strength against the Allied <b>torrent</b> of men and material - was forbidden, and it was ordered to conduct its actions from now on upon the strategic basis of not yielding an inch of ground and an abandonment of tactical manoeuvre.|$|E
5|$|The second assault proved no more successful. The red-coated English and the blue-coated Dutch {{advanced}} {{side by side}} {{in perfect}} order for a second attempt. Requiring from them another concerted effort their general officers personally led the men from the front into a second <b>torrent</b> of musket-shot and grenades. Again the Allies left many dead and wounded at the enemy palisade including Marshal Count von Limburg Styrum who had led the second assault. With broken ranks, and in confusion, the attacking troops fell once more back down the hill. With the Allies repulsed for a second time the exultant Bavarian grenadiers, with bayonets fixed, poured over their breastworks to pursue the attackers and drive them to defeat. But English guardsmen, aided by Lumley's dismounted cavalrymen, prevented a total rout, compelling the Bavarians back behind their defences.|$|E
