5|$|Playtex-branded tampons were {{introduced}} in the 1960s and became the primary competition to incumbent Tampax. Playtex invented the plastic tampon applicator in 1973. It {{was one of the}} tampon manufacturers that were sued for aggressively advertising over-absorbent tampons, which led <b>to</b> <b>toxic</b> shock syndrome.|$|E
5|$|Superfund {{sites are}} {{designated}} as {{being among the}} nation's worst areas with respect <b>to</b> <b>toxic</b> and hazardous waste. The Environmental Protection Agency is the federal agency that determines if a particular site is hazardous, prepares {{a course of action}} to reduce the hazard, and finds the parties responsible for the pollution. If a site is listed with the Superfund program, federal dollars are available for cleanup.|$|E
5|$|Enzymes of {{the smooth}} ER {{can also help}} detoxify drugs and poisons. Detoxification usually {{involves}} {{the addition of a}} hydroxyl group to a drug, making the drug more soluble and thus easier to purge from the body. One extensively studied detoxification reaction is carried out by the cytochrome P450 family of enzymes, which catalyze water-insoluble drugs or metabolites that would otherwise accumulate <b>to</b> <b>toxic</b> levels in cell membrane.|$|E
50|$|Naled is {{considered}} highly <b>toxic</b> <b>to</b> bees, {{as well as}} being moderately <b>to</b> highly <b>toxic</b> <b>to</b> birds and <b>toxic</b> <b>to</b> most aquatic life. The mule deer is among those most resistant to its effects.|$|R

5|$|German doctors {{performed}} {{a wide variety}} of experiments on prisoners at Auschwitz. SS doctors tested the efficacy of X-rays as a sterilization device by administering large doses to female prisoners. Prof Dr Carl Clauberg injected chemicals into women's uteruses in an effort to glue them shut. Bayer, then a subsidiary of IG Farben, bought prisoners to use as research subjects for testing new drugs. Prisoners were also deliberately infected with spotted fever for vaccination research and exposed <b>to</b> <b>toxic</b> substances to study the effects.|$|E
5|$|In 1962, marine {{biologist}} and ecologist Rachel Carson's book Silent Spring helped {{to mobilize the}} environmental movement by alerting the public <b>to</b> <b>toxic</b> pesticides, such as DDT, bioaccumulating in the environment. Carson used ecological science to link the release of environmental toxins to human and ecosystem health. Since then, ecologists have worked to bridge {{their understanding of the}} degradation of the planet's ecosystems with environmental politics, law, restoration, and natural resources management.|$|E
5|$|In {{the form}} of {{chloride}} ions, chlorine is necessary to all known species of life. Other types of chlorine compounds are rare in living organisms, and artificially produced chlorinated organics range from inert <b>to</b> <b>toxic.</b> In the upper atmosphere, chlorine-containing organic molecules such as chlorofluorocarbons have been implicated in ozone depletion. Small quantities of elemental chlorine are generated by oxidation of chloride to hypochlorite in neutrophils {{as part of the}} immune response against bacteria.|$|E
5000|$|It rapidly {{breaks down}} in {{alkaline}} solution. [...] Propoxur is highly <b>toxic</b> <b>to</b> many bird species, but its toxicity varies by the species. It is moderately <b>to</b> slightly <b>toxic</b> <b>to</b> {{fish and other}} aquatic species. Propoxur is highly <b>toxic</b> <b>to</b> honeybees.|$|R
50|$|The {{chemical}} tastes {{similar to}} how it smells with a pleasant fruity odor reminiscent of bergamot mint oil. It is found in Mentha citrata and is mildly <b>toxic</b> <b>to</b> humans, <b>toxic</b> <b>to</b> fish, and extremely <b>toxic</b> <b>to</b> daphnia. Linalyl acetate is also combustible.|$|R
50|$|Tetraethyl dithiopyrophosphate is also <b>toxic</b> <b>to</b> wildlife, {{including}} {{fish and}} aquatic invertebrates. It is also assumed by the Environmental Protection Agency <b>to</b> be <b>toxic</b> <b>to</b> birds.|$|R
5|$|With David Arquette, Johansson {{appeared}} in the horror comedy Eight Legged Freaks (2002), which {{tells the story of}} a collection of spiders that are exposed <b>to</b> <b>toxic</b> waste, causing them to grow to gigantic proportions and begin killing and harvesting. After graduating from PCS that year, she applied to New York University's Tisch School of the Arts, but decided to focus on her film career when she was rejected.|$|E
5|$|Generally, {{ships are}} removed from the fleet by going through {{a process known as}} ship {{breaking}} or scrapping. Ship-owners and buyers negotiate scrap prices based on factors such as the ship's empty weight (called light ton displacement or LDT) and prices in the scrap metal market. In 1998, almost 700ships were scrapped in places like Alang, India and Chittagong, Bangladesh. This is often done by 'beaching' the ship on open sand, then cutting it apart by hand with gas torches, a dangerous operation that results in injuries and fatalities, as well as exposure <b>to</b> <b>toxic</b> materials such as asbestos, lead, and various chemicals. Half a million deadweight tons worth of bulk carriers were scrapped in 2004, accounting for 4.7% of the year's scrapping. That year, bulkers fetched particularly high scrap prices, between $340 and $350 per LDT.|$|E
5|$|Prized as an {{ingredient}} in various foods, B.edulis is an edible mushroom held in high regard in many cuisines, and is commonly prepared and eaten in soups, pasta, or risotto. The mushroom {{is low in}} fat and digestible carbohydrates, and high in protein, vitamins, minerals and dietary fibre. Although it is sold commercially, {{it is very difficult}} to cultivate. Available fresh in autumn in Central, Southern and Northern Europe, it is most often dried, packaged and distributed worldwide. It keeps its flavour after drying, and it is then reconstituted and used in cooking. B.edulis is one of the few fungi sold pickled. The fungus also produces a variety of organic compounds with a diverse spectrum of biological activity, including the steroid derivative ergosterol, a sugar binding protein, antiviral compounds, antioxidants, and phytochelatins, which give the organism resistance <b>to</b> <b>toxic</b> heavy metals.|$|E

5|$|The {{body plan}} {{of an adult}} frog is {{generally}} characterized by a stout body, protruding eyes, cleft tongue, limbs folded underneath, {{and the absence of}} a tail. Besides living in fresh water and on dry land, the adults of some species are adapted for living underground or in trees. The skins of frog are glandular, with secretions ranging from distasteful <b>to</b> <b>toxic.</b> Warty species of frog tend to be called toads but the distinction between frogs and toads is based on informal naming conventions concentrating on the warts rather than taxonomy or evolutionary history. Frogs' skins vary in colour from well-camouflaged dappled brown, grey and green to vivid patterns of bright red or yellow and black to advertise toxicity and warn off predators.|$|E
5|$|Mayerson, with Sgt. Charles E. Hartz {{as their}} {{principal}} client, filed the first US Agent Orange class-action lawsuit, in Pennsylvania in 1980, for the injuries military personnel in Vietnam suffered through exposure <b>to</b> <b>toxic</b> dioxins in the defoliant. Attorney Mayerson co-wrote the brief that certified the Agent Orange Product Liability {{action as a}} class action, the largest ever filed as of its filing. Hartz's deposition {{was one of the}} first ever taken in America, and the first for an Agent Orange trial, for the purpose of preserving testimony at trial, as it was understood that Hartz would not live to see the trial because of a brain tumor that began to develop while he was a member of Tiger Force, Special Forces, and LRRPs in Vietnam. The firm also located and supplied critical research to the Veterans' lead expert, Dr. Codario, including about 100 articles from toxicology journals dating back more than a decade, as well as data about where herbicides had been sprayed, what the effects of dioxin had been on animals and humans, and every accident in factories where herbicides were produced or dioxin was a contaminant of some chemical reaction.|$|E
