5|$|Discarding one's {{corrective}} lenses, as Bates recommended, or wearing lenses {{weaker than}} one's prescribed correction, as some Bates method advocates suggest, poses a potential safety hazard in certain situations, especially {{when one is}} operating a motor vehicle.

5|$|Skirmishes with Edward over {{clerical}} privileges, royal power, Peckham's use of excommunication, and ecclesiastical taxation continued, but in October 1286, Edward {{issued a}} writ entitled Circumspecte Agatis which specified {{what types of}} cases the ecclesiastical courts could hear.

5|$|In August, 1874, Ezra Abbot sent to Scrivener a letter: {{the rough}} draught of which covered forty odd pages, devoted to <b>the</b> <b>correction</b> of {{apparent}} errors and {{a statement of}} overlooked facts in {{the first edition of}} the Plain Introduction. The letter came too late to be used in preparing the body of the second edition of Scrivener's work. Abbot's studies largely argumented the number of suggestions, particularly in those portions of the book devoted to describing the extant manuscripts. They were accumulated in great part to the older and well-known authorities - such as Griesbach, Matthaei, Scholz (particularly his work Biblisch-kritische Reise, Leipzig 1823), Bianchini, Montfaucon, Silvestre, Bandini, Laubecius, and Zaeagni. Part of suggestions were a result of Abbott's studies of recent edited Catalogues of the ancient Greek Manuscripts held in the British Museum, Bodleian Library, Oxford Catalogues, Kitchin's Catalogue of the manuscripts in the Library of Christ Church College (Oxrofd, 1867). Abbott added numerous references to facsimile editions.|$|E

It turns out that <b>the</b> <b>corrections</b> generically make <b>the</b> spectrum redder. To be consistent with the experimental data, there must be a upper bound on the reheating temperature.

5|$|On one occasion, the two {{scientists}} {{had gone on}} a fossil-collecting expedition to Cope's marl pits in New Jersey, where William Parker Foulke had discovered the holotype specimen of Hadrosaurus foulkii, described by the paleontologist Joseph Leidy (under whom Cope had studied comparative anatomy); {{this was one of}} the first American dinosaur finds, and the pits were still rich with fossils. Though the two parted amicably, Marsh secretly bribed the pit operators to divert future fossil finds to him, instead of Cope. The two began attacking each other in papers and publications, and their personal relations deteriorated. Marsh humiliated Cope by pointing out that his reconstruction of the plesiosaur Elasmosaurus was flawed, with the head placed where the tail should have been (or so he claimed, 20 years later; it was Leidy who published <b>the</b> <b>correction</b> shortly afterwards). Cope, in turn, began collecting in what Marsh considered his private bone-hunting turf in Kansas and Wyoming, further damaging their relationship.|$|E
5|$|One of Fletcher's {{priorities}} {{that was}} not resolved during the session was <b>the</b> <b>correction</b> of unintended tax increases on businesses that resulted from the tax reform plan passed in 2005. Fletcher called a special legislative session for mid-June so that the legislature could amend the plan and also authorize tax breaks designed to lure a proposed FutureGen power plant to Henderson. Republican Senate President David L. Williams asked Fletcher to include tax breaks for other businesses as well, but Fletcher insisted on a sparse legislative agenda. The session convened for five days and passed the tax breaks and amended tax reform plan unanimously in both houses. Fletcher applauded the legislature's efficiency.|$|E
5|$|The state's {{roads were}} in poor {{condition}} when Combs became governor. The Automotive Safety Foundation found {{that two-thirds of}} Kentucky's federal roads were below standards for existing traffic demands. It further found that {{twenty percent of the}} state's major city streets were inadequate, that another fifty-five percent would soon be inadequate due to increasing traffic, and that half of the state's secondary roads were unfit for modern industrial traffic. To address these problems, Combs issued $100million in bonds to increase funding for highways, appointing Earle Clements as state highway commissioner to oversee <b>the</b> <b>correction</b> of the road issues. One of the new roads, the Mountain Parkway, which connected Combs' native Eastern Kentucky to Central Kentucky, was later renamed the Bert T. Combs Mountain Parkway in Combs' honor. Because of generous funding in Combs' budget, Kentucky finished its portions of the Interstate Highway System much sooner than surrounding states such as Virginia and Tennessee.|$|E

Any number of mistakes could be corrected this way, but the process was entirely manual, as the machine had no memory of the typed characters.|$|E
40|$|We compute <b>the</b> <b>{{corrections}}</b> to finite-size scaling for the N-vector {{model on}} the square lattice in the large-N limit. We find that corrections behave as log L/L(2). For tree-level improved Hamiltonians corrections behave as 1 /L(2). In general l-loop improvement is expected to reduce this behavior to 1 /(L(2) log(l) L). We show that the finite-size scaling limit and the perturbative limit do not commute in the calculation of <b>the</b> <b>corrections</b> to finite-size scaling.
