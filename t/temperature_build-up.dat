40|$|In a Mediterranean climate, {{given the}} absence of snow, flat roofs are typical of both vernacular and modern architecture. Thermal mass, cross {{ventilation}} and night time cooling are standard passive design aids that inhibit indoor <b>temperature</b> <b>build-up</b> on hot summer days. Such flat roofs provide a golden opportunity for free-orientation of PV (photovoltaic) panels, unlike pitched roofs. There is established scientific evidence that their presence on flat roofs also helps curtail surface temperatures of the heavy mass structure, by means of (i) solar shading and (ii) convective cooling at given angles. Both factors in turn lower the convective heat transfer coefficient (CHTC) of the roof structure, thus inhibiting early seasonal <b>temperature</b> <b>build-up.</b> This contributes to lower cooling loads, thus reducing both the carbon footprint of the building as well as lowering energy costs for the owners. Such a holistic contribution is deemed to uphold the social, environmental and economic challenges of today. This study purports to do just that. Through CFD (computational fluid dynamics) this study investigates the effect of flow fields over a typical flat roof building mass in a free field {{for a range of}} wind velocities. Results indicate that for a higher wind speed, the convective cooling is more significant than at lower wind speeds. This will in turn influence the elemental U-value of the roof structure, thus reducing cooling loads indoors. peer-reviewe...|$|E

40|$|In this study, {{the effect}} of <b>temperature</b> on the <b>build-up</b> of {{exponentially}} growing polyelectrolyte multilayer films was investigated. It aims at understanding the multilayer growth mechanism as crucially important for the fabrication of tailor-made multilayer films. Model poly(L-lysine) /hyaluronic acid (PLL/HA) multilayers were assembled in the temperature range of 25 – 85 1 C by layer-by-layer deposition using a dipping method. The film growth switches from the exponential to the linear regime at the transition point {{as a result of}} limited polymer diffusion into the film. With the increase of the <b>build-up</b> <b>temperature</b> the film growth rate is enhanced in both regimes; the position of the transition point shifts to a higher number of deposition steps confirming the diffusion-mediated growth mechanism. Not only the faster polymer diffusion into the film but also more porous/permeable film structure are responsible for faster film growth at higher preparation temperature. The latter mechanism is assumed from analysis of the film growth rate upon switching of the preparation temperature during the film growth. Interestingly, the as-prepared films are equilibrated and remain intact (no swelling or shrinking) during temperature variation in the range of 25 – 45 1 C. The average activation energy for complexation between PLL and HA in the multilayers calculated from the Arrhenius plot {{has been found to be}} about 0. 3 kJ mol 1 for monomers of PLL.

40|$|Simulating the {{transient}} temperature field in {{additive layer manufacturing}} (ALM) processes has presented a challenge to many researchers in the field. The {{transient temperature}} history is vital for determining the thermal stress distribution and residual stress states in ALM-processed parts that utilise a moving laser heat source. The modelling of the problem involving multiple layers is equally of great importance because the thermal interactions of successive layers affect the temperature gradients, which govern the heat transfer and thermal stress development mechanisms. This paper uses an innovative simulation technique known as element birth and death, in modelling the three-dimensional temperature field in multiple layers in a powder bed. The {{results indicate that the}} heated regions undergo rapid thermal cycles that could be associated with commensurate thermal stress cycles.

40|$|Video rate or {{real-time}} imaging in the terahertz (THz) frequency range has become {{possible in the}} last few years with the advent of compact and high power THz sources, such as quantum cascade (QC) lasers, and the THz-sensitive vanadium oxide based microbolometer focal plane arrays. A new higher power QCL had been acquired and was characterized using FTIR spectroscopic techniques as part of this thesis. Spectral analysis revealed the center radiation frequency to be about 3. 78 THz, which was close to the manufacturers specification. Relative power analysis showed significantly higher magnitude, of at least two orders, than the previous low power QCL. Significant <b>temperature</b> <b>build-up</b> of the cryostat, where the laser was mounted, was noticed in terms of a temperature rise of about 16 Kelvins, but was not detrimental to the laser performance. Active real-time THz imaging was conducted with the laser and a 160 x 120 element microbolometer focal plane array camera, FLIR A 20 M. The off-axis parabolic (OAP) reflective mirrors were re-configured for the imaging experiment to ensure sufficient THz energy would be focused onto the object. This optical setup could be easily re-configured for either transmission mode, as well as reflective mode imaging experiments. A synchronization circuitry was designed to synchronously modulate the QCL pulses with the focal plane array for differential imaging. This operation would eliminate unwanted signals from the infrared background, obviating the need for dedicated spectral filters that would have significantly attenuated the THz signal as well. Preliminary experiments showed better contrast in the acquired images. Post-processing algorithms such as addition of digital gain, enhanced edges, and integration of multiple images could potentially enhance the quality of the THz images, and extend the research towards reflective and stand-off THz imaging.

40|$|Combustion Science & Engineering, Inc. (CSE) {{performed}} {{an analysis of}} the selfinitiated thermal decomposition phenomenon of paint-loaded filters that has occurred on several occasions as reported by the Iowa Waste Reduction Center. By conducting a series of self-heating tests on samples of filters loaded with paint, CSE has shown that in selected circumstances the exothermic decomposition of the paint-loaded filters could lead to thermal runaway and eventually ignition of the filters. These circumstances are related to the temperature, size, and composition of materials surrounding the filters. The exothermic decomposition of the paint releases energy. If the energy generated within the pile is greater than the energy lost from the pile, the internal temperature will increase. The non-linear nature of the chemical reactions promotes an exponential rise in the temperature, eventually reaching the ignition temperature of the paint and/or filters. At a certain critical pile size the configuration does not allow effective dissipation of the energy produced by the reaction for a given temperature. CSE’s test data were used to determine the Frank-Kamenetskii parameter for self-heating and the results indicate that the packing density is the single most critical factor. Furthermore, filters loaded with paint with a higher VOC content are more prone to selfheat than filters with a lower VOC content. To correct the self-heating problem, the geometry of the storage of the filters must be changed to allow for less <b>temperature</b> <b>build-up</b> and better heat dissipation. This can be effectively accomplished by reducing the volume of the storage containers and by reducing the packing density (number of filters per volume unit). In addition, filters should never be mixed with ordinary trash, as trash surrounding the filters will cause the same insulating effect as tightly packed filters. ...|$|E

A computational model of solution drop evaporation is developed {{to study the}} evolution of solute gradients inside the drop and predict the size and shell thickness of precipitating nanoparticles. The model considers evaporation as a two-stage process involving droplet shrinkage and shell growth. It was corroborated that droplet evaporation rate controls the solute distribution within a droplet and the resulting particle structure (solid or shell type). At higher gas <b>temperatures,</b> rapid <b>build-up</b> of solute near drop surface from high evaporation rates results in early attainment of critical supersaturation solubility and a steeper solute gradient, which favours formation of larger, shell-type particles. At lower gas temperatures, formation of smaller, solid nanoparticles is indicated. The computed size and shell thickness are in good agreement with experimentally prepared lipid nanoparticles. This study indicates that solid or shell structure of precipitated nanoparticles is strongly affected by evaporation rate, while initial solute concentration in the precursor solution and atomized droplet size affect shell thickness. For the gas temperatures considered, evaporative cooling leads to droplet temperature below the melting point of the lipid solute. Thus, we conclude that control over nanoparticle size and structure, of thermolabile precursor materials suitable for drug delivery, {{can be achieved by}} controlling evaporation rates, through selection of aerosol processing conditions...|$|R

Best Practice: This best practice describes various steps and precautions for minimizing/eliminating recycled rubber combustion and flammability. All automotive rubber products such as hose, mats, and belts must meet FMVSS 302 standards. Other specifications that rubbery material must meet are UL 94, ASTM D 470, C 542 and C 864. The release of volatiles upon burning rubber is of concern. ASTM D 4205 - 93 describes test methods for determining flammability and combustion properties of rubbery materials. A copy is attached. Implementation: Process and store materials at ambient <b>temperatures.</b> Avoid <b>build-up</b> of static electricity which may cause combustion. All processing and storage areas should be strictly “non-smoking. ” Recycled rubber handlers need to have information on volatility of the material from MSDSs. A copy of a MSDS, as an example, is attached in the Material Storage Best Practice. It is best to avoid static build-up during shredding, grinding, and sorting steps. This is achieved by properly grounding processing equipment. Appendix I lists comparative Btu valves of TCF (tire-chip fuel) and TDF (tire-derived fuel) to give an idea regarding the extent of heat generated during the burning of these materials.

This paper gives an assessment of meteorological conditions, radiative fluxes, and snow accumulation {{for the first two}} years of operation, 2009 - 2010, analyzed in terms of meteorological regimes. Three major meteorological regimes - cold katabatic, warm synoptic and transitional synoptic - are identified using cluster analysis based on five parameters derived from the AWS measurements (wind speed, specific humidity, near-surface temperature inversion, surface pressure, and incoming longwave flux indicative of cloud forcing). For its location, the relatively mild climate at Utsteinen can be explained by the high frequency of synoptic events (observed 41 - 48 % of the time), and a lack of drainage of cold air from the plateau due to mountain sheltering. During the cold katabatic regime a strong surface cooling leads to a strong near-surface <b>temperature</b> inversion <b>build-up.</b> A large difference in accumulation is recorded by the AWS for the two years: 235 mm water equivalent (w. e.) in 2009 and 27 mm w. e. in 2010. Several large accumulation events during the warm synoptic regime occurring mainly in winter were responsible for the majority of 2009 accumulation. Mostly small accumulation events occurred during 2010, frequently followed by snow removal. This interannual variability in snow accumulation at the site is related to the intensity of the local synoptic events as recorded by meteorological regime characteristics. status: publishe...|$|R
50|$|The bullet must tightly fit {{the bore}} {{to seal the}} high {{pressure}} of the burning gunpowder. This tight fit results in a large frictional force. The friction of the bullet in the bore does have a slight impact on the final velocity, but that is generally {{not much of a}} concern. Of greater concern is the heat that is generated due to the friction. At velocities of about 300 m/s, lead begins to melt, and deposit in the bore. This lead build-up constricts the bore, increasing the pressure and decreasing the accuracy of subsequent rounds, and is difficult to scrub out without damaging the bore. Rounds, used at velocities up to 460 m/s, can use wax lubricants on the bullet to reduce lead build-up. At velocities over 460 m/s, nearly all bullets are jacketed in copper, or a similar alloy that is soft enough not to wear on the barrel, but melts at a high enough <b>temperature</b> to reduce <b>build-up</b> in the bore. Copper build-up does begin to occur in rounds that exceed 760 m/s, and a common solution is to impregnate the surface of the bullet with molybdenum disulfide lubricant. This reduces copper build-up in the bore, and results in better long-term accuracy. Large caliber projectiles also employ copper driving bands for rifled barrels for spin-stabilized projectiles; however, fin-stabilized projectiles fired from both rifle and smoothbore barrels, such as the APFSDS anti-armor projectiles, employ nylon obturation rings that are sufficient to seal high pressure propellant gasses and also minimize in-bore friction, providing a small boost to muzzle velocity.|$|R

The aim of this work is to give a first evaluation of a new asymmetric vent openings design by means of computational fluid dynamics (CFD). The roof pitch combinations and the position of the vent openings offered by this design, present a wide range of adaptations for different local situations, thus allowing an expected optimal air exchange control. The roof has two pitches oriented face by face {{in the middle of the}} span, while the vent openings are oriented on the sides of the greenhouse. The vent windows are opened inward the glasshouse. Two vent configurations are considered (0 °; 30 ° and 10 °; 20 °), taking into account the combination effect of the leeward and windward openings; in fact the longitudinal axis of the greenhouses is normal to the imposed wind direction thus exposing differently the roof opening combination set-ups. The boundary conditions used for the simulation are representative of winter conditions in the Northern Italy. Two wind speeds (2 and 4 m s- 1) and two outside temperatures (- 2 and 7 °C) were used considering a set point inside temperature of 16 °C. The asymmetric design of the roof and the consequent positioning of the roof vents opened inward, seems to offer a sufficient range of combinations in order to obtain the best performance of air circulation for any outside climatic conditions.

40|$|The oxygen isotope signal in benthic foraminifera from deep-sea cores {{is mainly}} {{determined}} by deep-ocean temperature and land ice volume. Separating {{the temperature and}} ice volume signals is a key step in understanding the evolution of Cenozoic climate. Except {{for the last few}} million years, fluctuations in land ice volume were determined mainly {{by the size of the}} Antarctic ice sheet. Here a simplified Antarctic ice-sheet model and composite deep-sea oxygen isotope records are used to derive a deep-sea temperature history for the Cenozoic. The ice-sheet model is forced with the oxygen-isotope record, which is instantaneously corrected for the calculated ice volume. Therefore, the resulting deep-sea temperature and Antarctic ice volume curves are mutually consistent. The temperature record of Lear et al. [Science 287 (2000) 269], derived from the Mg/Ca ratio in benthic calcite, is also used to force the ice-sheet model. The resulting ice-volume does not agree well with the ice-volume history inferred by Lear et al. from a comparison of Mg/Ca and δ 18 O records. The most important points emerging from this study are: The Cenozoic δ 18 O record from benthic forams is a truly mixed signal (ice volume and deep-sea temperature contribute equally to the variance). For the period of 45 to 30 Ma ago, δ 18 O temperatures are significantly lower than Mg/Ca <b>temperatures.</b> Rapid nonlinear <b>build-up</b> of a continental-scale ice sheet on the Antarctic continent can easily occur for a linear cooling rate.

40|$|Abstract. The monthly flux of diatom taxa at four {{sites in}} two fjords of British Columbia, Canada, was {{determined}} over a 3 -year period by particle interceptor traps. Saanich Inlet {{is a small}} basin with little horizontal density gradient while Jervis Inlet experiences seasonal runoff and strong vertical stratification. The basic pattern of seasonal succession is the same in both fjords, but the timing and volume of production differ. Production is spread over a longer {{part of the year}} in Saanich Inlet, resulting in a more diverse assemblage, while in Jervis Inlet there is a single production maximum in May, dominated by Skeletonema cosuuum. Most taxa occur simultaneously at all sites, but many show a preference for one fjord, or one area within a fjord. Several species of Chactoceros recur consistently in inner Saanich Inlet each fall, suggesting re-seeding by benthic spores. In contrast, Rhizosolenia setigera is more common in the outer reaches of both fjords, and is probably introduced from outside. In Saanich Inlet interannual variability is relatively low, except for the fall season, which may differ from year to year in both volume and taxonomic composition. Jervis Inlet is both spatially and temporally more variable: spring production may differ from year to year by an order of magnitude. In this fjord the degree of stratification, controlled by freshwater influx, appears to determine the timing and composition of the phytoplankton assemblage. Large volumes of runoff may suppress the spring bloom, and prolonged stratification through the summer produces an unusual assemblage which may be light limited. El Nino of 1986 - 1987 had an opposite effect in the two fjords. In Saanich Inlet the unusual degree of sunshine during fall resulted in the largest bloom of the entire interval. Unusually warm air <b>temperatures</b> prevented the <b>build-up</b> of winter snow around Jervis Inlet. As a result, the normal late-spring stabilization of the water column from snowmelt did not occur, and the spring bloom was eliminated...|$|R
40|$|Due {{in large}} part to in {{prevalence}} of solar energy, increasing demand of energy production (from all sources), and the uncertain future of petroleum energy feedstocks, solar energy harvesting and other photochemical systems will {{play a major role in}} the developing energy market. This dissertation focuses on a novel photochemical reaction process: high temperature photocatalysis (i. e., photocatalysis conducted above ambient temperatures, T > 100 °C). The overarching hypothesis of this process is that photo-generated charge carriers are able to constructively participate in thermo-catalytic chemical reactions, thereby increasing catalytic rates at one temperature, or maintaining catalytic rates at lower temperatures. The photocatalytic oxidation of carbon deposits in an operational hydrocarbon reformer is one envisioned application of high <b>temperature</b> photocatalysis. Carbon <b>build-up</b> during hydrocarbon reforming results in catalyst deactivation, in the worst cases, this was shown to happen in a period of minutes with a liquid hydrocarbon. In the presence of steam, oxygen, and above-ambient temperatures, carbonaceous deposits were photocatalytically oxidized over very long periods (t ≥ 24 hours). This initial experiment exemplified the necessity of a fundamental assessment of high temperature photocatalytic activity. Fundamental understanding of the mechanisms that affect photocatalytic activity as a function of temperatures was achieved using an ethylene photocatalytic oxidation probe reaction. Maximum ethylene photocatalytic oxidation rates were observed between 100 °C and 200 °C; the maximum photocatalytic rates were approximately a factor of 2 larger than photocatalytic rates at ambient temperatures. The loss of photocatalytic activity at temperatures above 200 °C is due to a non-radiative multi-phonon recombination mechanism. Further, it was shown that the fundamental rate of recombination (as a function of temperature) can be effectively modeled as a temperature-dependent quantum efficiency term, and is directly driven by bulk photocatalyst crystal parameters: maximum phonon energy and the number of phonons allowed per unit cell. This analysis extends to multiple photocatalysts and can explain experimental observations of photocatalytic oxidation rates with varied reactant concentrations. Lastly, this dissertation applies this knowledge to a thermo-catalytic reaction (CO-oxidation) using a Au/TiO 2 catalyst. The combined photo/thermo-catalytic reaction showed a 10 - 25 % increase in CO conversion during a temperature programmed reaction experiment...|$|R
40|$|The severe fouling {{common in}} food {{processing}} puts high demands on equipment cleaning. Adsorption of the protein betalactoglobulin to solid surfaces and its subsequent removal were followed using in situ ellipsometry. Most experiments {{were done in}} a stirred cuvette. Additionally, a flow cell was designed, which was employed in some work. The characteristics of the surface were shown to influence protein adsorption and removal. While differences between chromium oxide and stainless steel were small, methylated silica showed significantly different adsorption, desorption during rinsing and cleanability. Near the betalactoglobulin denaturation <b>temperature,</b> rapid multilayer <b>build-up</b> was observed, {{and the importance of}} the bare surface properties appeared to decrease. On metal oxides, a lag phase preceded the build-up, while on methylated silica an initial phase of slower adsorption was seen. Prolonged adsorption times gave less desorption during rinsing from metal oxides. For methylated silica, increasing the betalactoglobulin residence time on the surface led to lower removal by the anionic surfactant SDS. Increasing the NaOH concentration gave enhanced cleaning rates and better cleanability of the stainless steel. Combining SDS with NaOH resulted in improved cleaning compared to if using the individual components. Adsorption and removal at high temperature resulted in lower cleanability compared to at room temperature, due to heat-induced alterations in the protein. No correlation was found between the bulk composition or the surface finish of the stainless steel and the fouling tendency or the cleanability. Differences in NaOH-induced protein removal were striking between surfaces subjected to different pretreatments. Passivated surfaces were less cleanable than surfaces pretreated with strong alkali or plasma-cleaned. After repeated fouling and cleaning without renewed pretreatment, differences decreased. While the cleanability of alkali-precleaned surfaces decreased when reused, changes for passivated surfaces were smaller. The initial betalactoglobulin adsorption in turbulent flow was found to be kinetically controlled. At the laminar flow rate, results indicated effects of both mass transport limitations and adsorption kinetics. No significant influence on rinsing or cleaning was evident, and effects on the amounts adsorbed were small.

In particular, I will focus the investigations on the effects due to the presence of a strong electron-hole Coulomb correlation. The Coulomb interaction leads to the formation of hydrogen-like bound states called excitons. The dynamics of these states is investigated in bare and cavity embedded quantum wells, and in quantum wires. I have investigated the dynamics of the relaxation of excitons in quantum wells due to the interaction with acoustic phonons and I have reproduced the temporal evolution of the photoluminescence emission. I have explained why the decay times observed in non resonant photoluminescence experiments are much slower than the radiative recombination time of a single exciton. Furthermore, deviation from the thermal equilibrium gives a characteristic dependence of these decay times on the <b>temperature.</b> The <b>build-up</b> of the photoluminescence is related to the relaxation by phonon emission of the excited electron-hole pairs. Initially, the pairs created at high energy are not bound, and the formation of bound excitons occurs during the relaxation. I have described the exciton formation due to the emission of acoustic and optical phonons, and I have calculated the characteristic times for this process in GaAs quantum wells. The formation can be geminate or bimolecular. In the geminate formation, the exciton is directly created by the photon of the external pump by simultaneous emission of an optical phonon, while in the bimolecular formation the exciton is created from thermalized electron-hole pairs. In the first case the formation occurs only during the laser pump, while in the second case the formation depends on the total density of carriers available in the crystal. The effects of the phonon assisted formation on the overall dynamics of free carriers, excitons and of the photoluminescence are discussed. Excitons confined in a quantum well coupled with the photons modes of a semiconductor microcavity gives mixed exciton-photon states called microcavity polaritons. The dynamics of the population of polaritons, which present an energy dispersion with an upper and lower branch, shows peculiar characteristics. In particular, a bottleneck region above the minimum of the lower polariton dispersion exists. In this region the population of polaritons is accumulated, and strong deviations from the thermal equilibrium are thus produced. Moreover, for the lower polariton states, a suppression of the scattering by acoustic phonons produces a strong inhibition of the thermal broadening. Finally, the dynamics of the photoluminescence spectra in semiconductor quantum wires is investigated. The time resolved photoluminescence experiments, the radiative recombination modifies adiabatically the total density, and the hypothesis quasi-thermal equilibrium can be applied. The optical spectra probes a system which ranges from a regime of ionized electron hole plasma to a gas of weakly interacting bound excitons. In order to describe such a complex system, I have used a Green's functions technique, and I have modeled the Coulomb interaction using a contact potential. This approach allows to observe in the absorption spectra a gain region close to the excitonic resonance. Moreover, the effects of the electron-hole correlations, calculated in a numerical self consistent way, explain the absence of the shift of the photoluminescence emission due to Coulomb induced band gap renormalization...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{calculation}} {{is to determine the}} probability of Multi-Canister Overpacks (MCOs) over-pressurizing during staging at the Canister Storage Building (CSB). Pressurization of an MCO during staging is dependent upon changes to the MCO gas <b>temperature</b> and the <b>build-up</b> of reaction products during the staging period. These effects are predominantly limited by the amount of water that remains in the MCO following cold vacuum drying that is available for reaction during staging conditions. Because of the potential for increased pressure within an MCO, provisions for a filtered pressure relief valve and rupture disk have been incorporated into the MCO design. This calculation provides an estimate of the frequency that an MCO will contain enough water to pressurize beyond the limits of these design features. The results of this calculation will be used in support of further safety analyses and operational planning efforts. Under the bounding steady state CSB condition assumed for this analysis, an MCO must contain less than 1. 6 kg (3. 7 lbm) of water available for reaction to preclude actuation of the pressure relief valve at 100 psid. To preclude actuation of the MCO rupture disk at 150 psid, an MCO must contain less than 2. 5 kg (5. 5 lbm) of water available for reaction. These limits are {{based on the assumption that}} hydrogen generated by uranium-water reactions is the sole source of gas produced within the MCO and that hydrates in fuel particulate are the primary source of water available for reactions during staging conditions. The results of this analysis conclude that the probability of the hydrate water content of an MCO exceeding 1. 6 kg is 0. 08 and the probability that it will exceed 2. 5 kg is 0. 01. This implies that approximately 32 of 400 staged MCOs may experience pressurization to the point where the pressure relief valve actuates. In the event that an MCO pressure relief valve fails to open, the probability is 1 in 100 that the MCO would experience pressurization to the point where the rupture disk would actuate. Sensitivity analysis shows that the water content of fuel particulate is the most influential factor to these calculations. The results of continued study and analysis of the fuel particulate water content should be considered for future refinement of this analysis...|$|R
40|$|This PhD {{project has}} {{expanded}} the {{knowledge in the}} area of profluorescent nitroxides with regard to the synthesis and characterisations of novel profluorescent nitroxide probes as well as physical characterisation of the probe molecules in various polymer/physical environments. The synthesis of the first example of an azaphenalene-based fused aromatic nitroxide TMAO, [1, 1, 3, 3 -tetramethyl- 2, 3 -dihydro- 2 -azaphenalen- 2 -yloxyl, was described. This novel nitroxide possesses some of the structural rigidity of the isoindoline class of nitroxides, as well as some properties akin to TEMPO nitroxides. Additionally, the integral aromatic ring imparts fluorescence that is switched on by radical scavenging reactions of the nitroxide, which makes it a sensitive probe for polymer degradation. In addition to the parent TMAO, 5 other azaphenalene derivatives were successfully synthesised. This new class of nitroxide was expected to have interesting redox properties when the structure was investigated by high-level ab initio molecular orbitals theory. This was expected to have implications with biological relevance as the calculated redox potentials for the azaphenalene ring class would make them potent antioxidant compounds. The redox potentials of 25 cyclic nitroxides from four different structural classes (pyrroline, piperidine, isoindoline and azaphenalene) were determined by cyclic voltammetry in acetonitrile. It was shown that potentials related to the one electron processes of the nitroxide were influenced by the type of ring system, ring substituents or groups surrounding the moiety. Favourable comparisons were found between theoretical and experimental potentials for pyrroline, piperidine and isoindoline ring classes. Substitution of these ring classes, were correctly calculated to have a small yet predictable effect on the potentials. The redox potentials of the azaphenalene ring class were underestimated by the calculations in all cases by at least a factor of two. This is believed to be due to another process influencing the redox potentials of the azaphenalene ring class which is not taken into account by the theoretical model. It was also possible to demonstrate the use of both azaphenalene and isoindoline nitroxides as additives for monitoring radical mediated damage that occurs in polypropylene as well as in more commercially relevant polyester resins. Polymer sample doped with nitroxide were exposed to both thermo-and photo-oxidative conditions with all nitroxides showing a protective effect. It was found that isoindoline nitroxides were able to indicate radical formation in polypropylene aged at elevated <b>temperatures</b> via fluorescence <b>build-up.</b> The azaphenalene nitroxide TMAO showed no such build-up of fluorescence. This was believed to be due to the more labile bond between the nitroxide and macromolecule and the protection may occur through a classical Denisov cycle, as is expected for commercially available HAS units. Finally, A new profluorescent dinitroxide, BTMIOA (9, 10 -bis(1, 1, 3, 3 - tetramethylisoindolin- 2 -yloxyl- 5 -yl) anthracene), was synthesised and shown to be a powerful probe for detecting changes during the initial stages of thermo-oxidative degradation of polypropylene. This probe, which contains a 9, 10 -diphenylanthracene core linked to two nitroxides, possesses strongly suppressed fluorescence due to quenching by the two nitroxide groups. This molecule also showed the greatest protective effect on thermo-oxidativly aged polypropylene. Most importantly, BTMIOA was found to be a valuable tool for imaging and mapping free-radical generation in polypropylene using fluorescence microscopy...|$|R
