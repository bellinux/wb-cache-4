5|$|The {{trial of}} those charged with {{involvement}} in the coup occurred {{more than two years}} later in mid-1963. Diệm scheduled the hearing {{in the middle of the}} Buddhist crisis, a move that was interpreted as an attempt <b>to</b> <b>deter</b> <b>the</b> populace from further dissent. Nineteen officers and 34 civilians were accused of complicity in the coup and called before the Special Military Court.|$|E
5|$|Fort Defiance {{was also}} being {{constructed}} at this time, located farther southwest, past Fort Box, near present-day Red Hook. In {{addition to these}} new forts, a mounted battery was established on Governors Island, cannons were placed at Fort George facing Bowling Green, and more cannons placed at the Whitehall Dock, which sat on the East River. Hulks were sunk at strategic locations <b>to</b> <b>deter</b> <b>the</b> British from entering the East River and other waterways.|$|E
5|$|Life in a workhouse was {{intended}} to be harsh, <b>to</b> <b>deter</b> <b>the</b> able-bodied poor and to ensure that only the truly destitute would apply. But in areas such as the provision of free medical care and education for children, neither of which was available to the poor in England living outside workhouses until the early 20th century, workhouse inmates were advantaged over the general population, a dilemma that the Poor Law authorities never managed to reconcile.|$|E

5|$|Upon his ascension, Playford {{headed a}} {{minority}} government; the LCL only held 15 of the 39 {{seats in the}} lower house. The balance of power was held by 13 mostly conservative independents. Many had gained from discontent over Butler's relatively liberal social stances, so Playford sought to assuage them by having his LCL colleagues refrain from upsetting social conservatives. He also used the threat of an early election <b>to</b> <b>deter</b> <b>the</b> independents from stalling his initiatives—with their lack of party infrastructure and funding, {{they would be the}} most vulnerable to election campaigns.|$|E
5|$|CANBAT 1 was {{expected}} to deploy one mechanised company each to the JORDBAT and the NEPBAT AORs to position themselves defensively. The forces would attempt <b>to</b> <b>deter</b> <b>the</b> HV from advancing, demonstrate its resolve to defend Sector West, engage the HV with antitank weapons and mortars, protect the Jordanian and Nepalese withdrawal and withdraw {{under the protection of}} CANBAT 1. The two companies required eight hours notice of the HV advance to reach their designated positions in time. Presumably, the ARSK would retrieve its heavy weapons from the UNPROFOR storage by force and resist the HV.|$|E
5|$|The nearby {{kingdom of}} Karasahr grew {{wary of the}} Chinese troops {{stationed}} at Gaochang, now under Tang domination. It refused to send tribute to the Tang court and formed an alliance with the Western Turks. A Tang campaign led by commander Guoxiao Ke captured the kingdom in 644 and installed a Tang loyalist as ruler. Military assistance by the Western Turks failed <b>to</b> <b>deter</b> <b>the</b> Tang forces. With {{the support of the}} Western Turks, the puppet ruler was later deposed, and another military campaign, led by the Tang general Ashina She'er, a member of the Turkic Ashina royal family, arrived in 648 to re-establish Tang control.|$|E

5|$|General Marshall was Truman's {{principal}} adviser {{on foreign policy}} matters, influencing such decisions as the U.S. choice against offering direct military aid to Chiang Kai-shek and his Nationalist Chinese forces in the Chinese Civil War against their communist opponents. Marshall's opinion was contrary to the counsel of almost all of Truman's other advisers—Marshall thought propping up Chiang's forces would drain U.S. resources that were needed in Europe <b>to</b> <b>deter</b> <b>the</b> Soviets. When the communists {{took control of the}} mainland, establishing the People's Republic of China and driving the Nationalists to Taiwan, Truman would have been willing to maintain some relationship between the U.S. and the new government but Mao was unwilling. On June 27, 1950, after the outbreak of fighting in Korea, Truman ordered the U.S. Navy's Seventh Fleet into the Taiwan Strait to prevent further conflict between the communist government on the China mainland and the Republic of China (ROC) on Taiwan.|$|E
5|$|One of the frigates, Santa Dorotea, {{had lost}} a topmast {{sometime}} earlier and as result was slower {{than the rest of}} the squadron. Falling behind the others, Gerraro soon found that his ship was in danger of being isolated by Lion, as Dixon steered for the rapidly opening gap between the Spanish ships. Recognising the danger, O'Neil ordered the front three frigates to turn around and sail to the defence of Santa Dorotea, passing close by Lion and opening a heavy fire at 11:15. Lion replied, and the Spanish frigates did not immediately turn back for a second pass, continuing ahead as Dixon closed with the straggling Santa Dorotea. In an effort <b>to</b> <b>deter</b> <b>the</b> ship of the line, Gerraro opened fire on Lion with his stern chasers, cannon situated in the frigate's stern, which caused considerable damage to Dixon's rigging. As Lion began to close the distance, O'Neil's ships returned, but the frigates passed Lion at extreme distance, their broadsides having no effect and again coming under fire themselves.|$|E
5|$|The Viet Minh {{engaged in}} counter-propaganda campaigns {{in an attempt}} <b>to</b> <b>deter</b> <b>the</b> exodus from the north. They moved through the neighbourhoods of Hanoi and Haiphong on a daily basis, passing out their pamphlets. Evacuees {{reported}} being ridiculed by the Viet Minh, who claimed {{that they would be}} sadistically tortured before being killed by the French and American authorities in Haiphong. The communists depicted the personnel of Task Force 90 as cannibals who would eat their babies, predicting disaster in the jungles, beaches and mountains of South Vietnam. They further said that the Americans would throw them overboard to drown in the ocean. The Viet Minh boasted to the emigrants that it was a high and futile risk, asserting that the 1956 reunification elections would result in a decisive communist victory. The communist efforts were helped by the fact that many French or State of Vietnam offices in the north evacuated their personnel and sold or otherwise left behind their printing facilities, many of which fell into Viet Minh hands.|$|E
40|$|French {{public opinion}} {{has long been}} disenchanted with its {{judicial}} system. Throughout history, popular images of Justice have usually been negative ones. In many cases, judges are shown to be partial, incapable of establishing truth or subject to the most powerful institutions. This poor image of Justice has significant consequences on the opinion of business people and on corporate judicial strategies: from prioritising out of court settlements, <b>to</b> <b>deterring</b> <b>the</b> opposing party from asserting its rights, and by the {{taking advantage of the}} slowness, costs and hazards of going to the public cou...|$|R

5|$|The mob lit garbage on {{fire and}} stuffed it through the broken windows as the police grabbed a fire hose. Because it had no water pressure, the hose was {{ineffective}} in dispersing the crowd, and seemed only to encourage them. When demonstrators broke through the windows—which had been covered by plywood by the bar owners <b>to</b> <b>deter</b> <b>the</b> police from raiding the bar—the police inside unholstered their pistols. The doors flew open and officers pointed their weapons at the angry crowd, threatening to shoot. The Village Voice writer Howard Smith, in the bar with the police, took a wrench from the bar and stuffed it in his pants, unsure if {{he might have to}} use it against the mob or the police. He watched someone squirt lighter fluid into the bar; as it was lit and the police took aim, sirens were heard and fire trucks arrived. The onslaught had lasted 45minutes.|$|E

The raid was a brilliant tactical success but it failed <b>to</b> <b>deter</b> <b>the</b> marshal from assisting Suchet. Finally, a logistical crisis forced MacDonald to withdraw to northern Catalonia.|$|E
