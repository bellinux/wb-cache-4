50|$|The International Corresponding Club, as the IEA {{was first}} called, {{was started in}} 1954 by John Pemberton of Great Britain and Harold N Willard of the United States with the advice and help of Robert Cruickshank. They had found, as <b>traveling</b> Research <b>Fellows</b> each in the other's country, that they were {{handicapped}} by not being sufficiently well informed about the research and teaching {{in the field of}} social and preventive medicine in the various medical schools and research institutes. Initially it was to try and remedy this defect, that the Club was established on a small and informal basis. At first it was just a corresponding club whose object was ‘to facilitate the communication between physicians working for the most part in university departments of preventive and social medicine, or in research institutes devoted to these aspects of medicine, throughout the world’. This was to be achieved by the publication of a Bulletin twice a year and by members endeavouring to ‘ensure a friendly and hospitable welcome for visitors’ from other countries. The first issue of the Bulletin appeared in January 1955 and contained contributions from 26 correspondents from nine countries.|$|R

(2) We show that a Teichmüller geodesic segment whose endpoints are in the thick part has the <b>fellow</b> <b>traveling</b> property and that this fails when the endpoints are not necessarily in the thick part. (3) We prove a thin-triangle property for Teichmüller geodesics.

50|$|The {{fellowship}} itself grants recipients {{money to}} spend one year traveling in pursuit of their projects. Recipients are forbidden from reentering the United States and their home country for one year. Projects are not academically oriented, as the fellowship is intended to encourage exploration and new experiences rather than formal research. Currently the award is $30,000 per fellow or $40,000 for a <b>fellow</b> <b>traveling</b> with a spouse or dependent. The stipend also provides student loan repayment {{for the duration of}} the fellowship. Unlike many fellowships, the Watson Foundation requires no tangible output, emphasizing that the grant is an investment in a person rather than a project. During their travels the Fellows remain unaffiliated with a college or university, instead planning and administering their projects themselves. They are barred from working on a paying job, and are discouraged from joining organized volunteer projects for substantial periods of time.|$|R

In each of these bastions were kept two small cannon, with a good supply of small-arms. These bastions were always well guarded when any danger was suspected from the Indians.

25|$|During their incarceration, {{multiple}} prominent Quaker leaders {{attempted to}} intervene {{on behalf of}} Evans and Cheevers, including George Fox, but this was unsuccessful except in one case. Prior to his visit, <b>fellow</b> <b>traveling</b> Quaker missionary Daniel Baker had an angel appear to him and tell him of their situation. He went to visit them and to offer himself up as a prisoner {{in exchange for the}} freedom of Evans and Cheevers, but his offer was denied. Instead, he took efforts to deliver letters and works the women had written to England. He was only able to obtain their works after they threw them out a window to him; they were initially intercepted, but he was able to make copies for the prison and keep the originals. Baker continued in his travels, but returned to England to publish their writings on behalf of Evans and Cheevers in 1662. Evans and Cheevers appreciated this, and referred to Baker in terms such as “Our dear Brother.” Historians are unsure {{about the extent to which}} Baker edited or altered Evans and Cheever’s original manuscripts, but most agree that Baker’s influence was minimal and largely inconsequential.|$|R
