40|$|Abstract: The working {{condition}} of shaft determines whether the ship can continuously acquire propulsive force from diesel engine. It {{is hard to}} operate the contact measurement of shaft power and torque neither is it accurate, so the non-contact measurement that is easier and more flexible to use should be the direction to go. A novel contact-less shaft condition monitoring system based on photo-electronic technology is proposed in this paper. Two coding wheels and optoelectronic position sensors are settled to detect the <b>torsion</b> angle <b>of</b> a length of shaft, and the <b>torsion</b> angle <b>of</b> shaft can be quantified by logic circuits in {{field programmable gate array}} (FPGA) according to counter frequency and central angle <b>of</b> <b>vane.</b> And then the power and torque on shaft can be worked out in computer. To avoid the drift of optoelectronic device, a logic algorithm was studied to eliminate the bias of trigger point for position detector. The experimental result shows that this method is adequate for measuring the <b>torsion</b> angle <b>of</b> shaft, and gets rid of the redundant optical fiber which might induce danger in online monitoring of rotating shaft system. The design of this monitoring system gives an idea for monitoring and diagnosis of not only the shaft of marine propulsion system but also large rotating machines...|$|R

40|$|A {{new method}} for {{reducing}} large-scale mixing noise from dual-stream jets is presented. The principle is {{reduction of the}} convective Mach number of turbulent eddies that produce intense downward sound radiation. In a jet representing the coaxial exhaust of a turbofan engine, this is achieved by tilting downward, by a few degrees, the bypass (secondary) plume relative to the core (primary) plume. The misalignment of the two flows creates a thick low-speed secondary core {{on the underside of}} the high-speed primary flow. The secondary core reduces the convective Mach number of primary eddies, thus hindering their ability to generate sound that travels to the downward acoustic far field. Tilting of the bypass stream is possible by means of fixed or variable vanes installed near the exit of the bypass duct. Subscale aeroacoustic experiments simulated the exhaust flow of a turbofan engine with bypass ratio 6. 0. Deflection of the bypass stream resulted in suppression of the peak overall sound pressure level by 4. 5 dB and the effective perceived noise level by 2. 8 dB. For the nozzle configuration used, the thrust loss is estimated at around 0. 5 % with the vanes activated and 0. 15 % with the vanes deactivated.
