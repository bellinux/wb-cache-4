5|$|Born into {{a wealthy}} family, whose forebears had been {{involved}} in ensuring Argentina's independence from Spain, she was not expected to work outside the home. Yet Ferrari not only chose to have a career, she insisted on participating in the male-dominated medical profession. She first earned a teaching diploma and became a school teacher, then graduated in medicine in 1911. After completing her residency, she applied to teach at the university level, but instead was offered a teaching post at the School of Midwifery. Outraged, she fought for 13 years against <b>the</b> <b>prejudices</b> which prevented her advancing in her career. In 1927, Ferrari won her fight and was granted a professorship as an alternate. Finally in 1939, she was awarded a full professorship.|$|E

William Maclay suspected that several congressmen were involved in government securities, saw Congress in an unholy league with New York speculators. Congressman James Jackson also spoke against New York, with allegations of speculators attempting to swindle those who had not yet heard about Hamilton's report.|$|E

The Court denounced any efforts to draw this distinction, whether based on the historical record or on historical grounds, as arbitrary and likely to be suffused with <b>the</b> <b>prejudices</b> of an unelected branch of government as to which governmental functions are proper and traditional and which ones are not.|$|E

25|$|The {{most recent}} critics, {{starting}} from the difficult reconstruction of the entire catalogue of the Gentileschi, tried to give a less reductive reading of the career of Artemisia, placing it more accurately {{in the context of}} the different artistic environments in which the painter actively participated. A reading such as this restores Artemisia as an artist who fought with determination—using the weapon of personality and of the artistic qualities—against <b>the</b> <b>prejudices</b> expressed against women painters; being able to introduce herself productively in the circle of the most respected painters of her time, embracing a series of pictorial genres that probably were more ample and varied than her paintings suggest.|$|E
25|$|However, the {{formation}} of modern nations in Europe accompanied changes in <b>the</b> <b>prejudices</b> against Jews. What had previously been religious persecution now became a new phenomenon, Racial antisemitism and acquired a new name: antisemitism. Antisemites saw Jews as an alien religious, national and racial group and actively tried to prevent Jews from acquiring equal rights and citizenship. The Catholic press was {{at the forefront of}} these efforts and was quietly encouraged by the Vatican, which saw its own decline in status as linked to the equality granted to Jews. By the late 19th century, the more extreme nationalist movements in Europe often promoted physical violence against Jews who they regarded as interlopers and exploiters threatening the well-being of their nations.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to these two loose groupings, a number of prominent Irish poets {{of the second half}} of the 20th century could be described as outsiders, although these poets could also be considered leaders of a mainstream tradition in the Republic which was critically eclipsed by the Ulster-centric focus of American and British-based Irish Studies academics and <b>the</b> <b>prejudices</b> of others who are gender study specialists. These include Thomas Kinsella (born 1928), whose early work was influenced by Auden. Kinsella's later work exhibits the influence of Pound in its looser metrical structure and use of imagery but is deeply personal in manner and matter. He is Professor of English at Temple University, Philadelphia. Kinsella also edited the poetry of Austin Clarke, who, in his later work at least, could also be included with the outsiders in Irish poetry.|$|E

While in Britain, he toured parts of the country by train, keeping with his desire to inspire railway development in his own country while constantly fighting against <b>the</b> <b>prejudices</b> of conservative leaders. He visited the industrial area in Barrow, North West England, and toured Lake Windermere on a steamer operated by the Furness Railway Company. He also witnessed the 1896 Royal Naval Fleet Review at Spithead. It was during his visit to Britain in 1896 that Queen Victoria made him a Knight Grand Cross of the Royal Victorian Order.|$|E

At least five of their major projects were subjects of documentary films by Albert and David Maysles. Although, Jeanne-Claude and Christo worked as creative equals {{on all of}} their art projects, only Christo’s name appeared on the finished products. This was a conscious decision by both Jeanne-Claude and Christo because of <b>the</b> <b>prejudices</b> against female artists in the art world. Jeanne-Claude said, “‘The decision to use only the name Christo was made deliberately {{when we were young}} because it was difficult for one artist to be established and we wanted to put all the chances on our side.’” Therefore, Jeanne-Claude took on the role as Christo’s manager in order to advance their success. The pair did not reveal Jeanne-Claude as the second half in the creative process until 1994.|$|E
25|$|In some states, {{the legal}} {{acceptability}} of {{common law marriage}} is very limited. Some couples, whether {{because there are no}} local formalities relevant to them or because they have strongly held prejudices against compliance with the local forms, decide to create a marriage either by a simple public exchange of vows (per verbis inter praesentes), or by habit and repute. Because the need for conformity between states requires respect for the legal systems, it is now very difficult to identify states with no local system for the celebration and registration of marriages, and even more difficult for the courts of one state to justify a decision to support <b>the</b> <b>prejudices</b> of two of its citizens against the laws of the second state. However, other states permit informal marriages to acquire legal status and, where this happens, there is no reason in principle why international recognition should not follow.|$|E

25|$|In {{the course}} of the trial, Socrates imitates, parodies, and corrects the Orators, his accusers, and asks the jury to judge him by the truth of his statements, not by his oratorical skill (cf. Lysias XIX 1,2,3; Isaeus X 1; Isocrates XV 79; Aeschines II 24). Socrates says he will not use sophistic {{language}} — carefully arranged ornate words and phrases — but will speak using the common idiom of the Greek language. He affirms that he will speak in the manner he is heard using in the agora and at the money tables. Despite his claim of ignorance, Socrates speaks masterfully, correcting the Orators and showing them what they should have done — speak the truth persuasively and with wisdom. Although offered the opportunity to appease <b>the</b> <b>prejudices</b> of the jury, with a minimal concession to the charges of corruption and impiety, Socrates does not yield his integrity to avoid the penalty of death. Accordingly, the jury condemns Socrates to death.|$|E
25|$|It is only by {{maintaining}} such a continual vigilance that the sociologists can spot {{themselves in the}} act of importing their own biases into their work. Reflexivity is, therefore, a kind of additional stage in the scientific epistemology. It is not enough for the scientist to go through the usual stages (research, hypothesis, falsification, experiment, repetition, peer review, etc.); Bourdieu recommends also that the scientist purge their work of <b>the</b> <b>prejudices</b> likely to derive from their social position. In a good illustration of the process, Bourdieu chastises academics (including himself) for judging their students' work against a rigidly scholastic linguistic register, favouring students whose writing appears 'polished', marking down those guilty of 'vulgarity'. Without a reflexive analysis of the snobbery being deployed under the cover of those subjective terms, the academic will unconsciously reproduce a degree of class prejudice, promoting the student with high linguistic capital and holding back the student who lacks it — not because of the objective quality of the work but simply because of the register in which it is written. Reflexivity should enable the academic to be conscious of their prejudices, e.g. for apparently sophisticated writing, and impel them to take steps to correct for this bias.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{tests the}} {{predictions}} {{about the relationship between}} racial prejudice and racial wage gaps from Becker's (1957) seminal work on employer discrimination - something which has not previously been done in the large economics discrimination literature. Using rich data on racial <b>prejudice</b> from <b>the</b> General Social Survey, we find strong support for all of the key predictions from Becker about <b>the</b> relationship between <b>prejudice</b> and racial wage gaps. In particular, we show that, relative to white wages, black wages: (a) vary negatively with a measure of <b>the</b> <b>prejudice</b> of <b>the</b> "marginal" white in a state; (b) vary negatively with <b>the</b> <b>prejudice</b> in <b>the</b> lower tail of <b>the</b> <b>prejudice</b> distribution, but are unaffected by <b>the</b> <b>prejudice</b> of <b>the</b> most <b>prejudiced</b> persons in a state; and (c) vary negatively with the fraction of a state that is black. We show that these results are robust to a variety of extensions, including directly controlling for racial skill quality differences and instrumental variables estimates. We present some initial evidence to show that racial wage gaps are larger the more racially integrated is a state’s workforce, also as Becker's model predicts. The paper also briefly discusses familiar criticisms and extensions of the standard Becker model, including an argument of our own which, like some recent work, shows that the model's main predictions can be shown theoretically to survive the effects of long run competition. ...|$|R
