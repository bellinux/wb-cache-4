25|$|The CBO {{estimated}} in January 2009 that <b>the</b> <b>Bush</b> <b>tax</b> cuts would add approximately $3.0 trillion to the debt over the 2010-2019 decade if fully extended at all income levels, including interest.|$|E
25|$|The CBO {{estimated}} in June 2012 that <b>the</b> <b>Bush</b> <b>tax</b> cuts of 2001 (EGTRRA) and 2003 (JGTRRA) added approximately $1.5 trillion total to the debt over the 2002-2011 decade, excluding interest.|$|E
25|$|In {{terms of}} the budget legacy passed to his {{successor}} President Obama, CBO forecast in January 2009 that the deficit that year would be $1.2 trillion, assuming the continuation of Bush policies. From a policy perspective, the long-term deficit legacy depended significantly on whether <b>the</b> <b>Bush</b> <b>tax</b> cuts were allowed to expire in 2010 as initially legislated. President Obama extended <b>the</b> <b>Bush</b> <b>tax</b> cuts entirely {{through the end of}} 2012 as part of the 2010 Tax Relief Act, then extended them for the bottom 99% of income earners indefinitely thereafter as part of the fiscal cliff resolution, roughly 80% of the dollar value of the cuts.|$|E

50|$|However, a {{more recent}} CBO {{analysis}} indicates that with changes to 2013 tax law (e.g., the expiration of <b>the</b> 2001-2003 <b>Bush</b> <b>tax</b> cuts for top earners and the increased payroll taxes passed {{as part of the}} Affordable Care Act), the effective federal tax rates for the highest earning household will increase to levels not seen since 1979.|$|R
25|$|One {{incident}} {{illustrates the}} nature and tensions of the debate. The U.S. added $1.0 trillion to the national debt in fiscal year (FY) 2008, which ended in September 2008. The Congressional Budget Office projected two weeks prior to Obama's first inauguration that the deficit in FY 2009 would be $1.2 trillion and that the debt increase over the following decade would be $3.1 trillion assuming the expiration of <b>the</b> <b>Bush</b> <b>tax</b> cuts as scheduled in 2010, or around $6.0 trillion if <b>the</b> <b>Bush</b> <b>tax</b> cuts were extended at all income levels. Adjusting other assumptions in the CBO baseline could have raised that debt level even higher.|$|E
25|$|The CBO {{estimated}} in January 2009 that extending <b>the</b> <b>Bush</b> <b>tax</b> cuts at all income levels over the 2011-2019 period {{would increase the}} annual deficit {{by an average of}} 1.7% GDP, reaching 2.0% GDP in 2018 and 2019.|$|E
25|$|Shortly after Obama's 2012 re-election, Congressional Republicans and Obama again faced {{off over}} the final fate of <b>the</b> <b>Bush</b> <b>tax</b> cuts. Republicans sought to make all tax cuts permanent, while Obama sought to extend the tax cuts only for those making under $250,000. Obama and Congressional Republicans came to an {{agreement}} on the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, which made permanent the tax cuts for individuals making less than $400,000 a year (or less than $450,000 for couples). For earnings greater than that amount, the income tax increased from 35% to 39.6%, which was the top rate before the passage of <b>the</b> <b>Bush</b> <b>tax</b> cuts. The deal also permanently indexed {{the alternative minimum tax}} for inflation, limited deductions for individuals making more than $250,000 ($300,000 for couples), permanently set the estate tax exemption at $5.12 million (indexed to inflation), and increased the top estate tax rate from 35% to 40%. Though many Republicans did not like the deal, the bill passed the Republican House in large part {{due to the fact that}} the failure to pass any bill would have resulted in the total expiration of <b>the</b> <b>Bush</b> <b>tax</b> cuts.|$|E
50|$|Skelton {{voted against}} <b>the</b> 2001 <b>Bush</b> <b>Tax</b> cuts. In 1981, {{he voted against}} Reagan's tax cuts.He was {{supportive}} of labor.

2500|$|Changes in {{revenues}} primarily represent {{a return to}} the long-run average. Tax revenues historically have averaged around 18% GDP. The subprime mortgage crisis resulted in significant declines {{in revenues}}, with revenue falling to a record low 15% GDP. [...] President Obama's budget preserves <b>the</b> <b>Bush</b> income <b>tax</b> cuts for couples earning below $250,000, while eliminating some tax exemptions and deductions (tax expenditures).|$|R
50|$|Various {{sources have}} {{estimated}} {{the impact on}} taxpayers from the tax increases that would have occurred if <b>the</b> <b>Bush</b> income <b>tax</b> cuts and the Obama payroll tax cut {{had been allowed to}} expire with the fiscal cliff. The table below shows the dollar and percentage increase in income taxes for the 2013 tax year, if the fiscal cliff had taken effect.|$|R
25|$|The {{national}} debt increased from $10.0 trillion in September 2008 to $19.6 trillion in September 2016. As described above, roughly $3 trillion of this increase was anticipated in the January 2009 CBO baseline forecast, or $6-8 trillion adjusting for {{the extension of}} <b>the</b> <b>Bush</b> <b>tax</b> cuts and other baseline overrides typically legislated. Obama ultimately extended <b>the</b> <b>Bush</b> <b>tax</b> cuts for approximately 98% of taxpayers {{as part of the}} American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012, allowing taxes to rise on the top 1â€“2% of income earners. The debt held by the public (which excludes intra-governmental liabilities like the Social Security Trust Fund) rose from around 36% GDP in 2009 to 76% GDP in 2016, the highest level except for the post World War 2 era.|$|E
25|$|President Obama pledged {{before he}} was elected not to raise taxes except on those couples earning over $250,000 (200,000 for individuals). With <b>the</b> <b>Bush</b> <b>tax</b> cuts {{extension}} scheduled to expire in January 2013, President Obama had significant leverage with the Republican Congress, as his veto of further extensions {{would have resulted in}} a sizable income tax increase across the income spectrum, a significant expansion of government, but contrary to his pledge. His compromise, the American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 (ATRA), passed by a wide majority in the Senate, with both Democrats and Republicans supporting it, while a majority of Republicans in the House opposed it. It extended <b>the</b> <b>Bush</b> <b>tax</b> cuts for roughly the bottom 99% of income earners (those earning below $400,000, or $450,000 for married couples).|$|E

25|$|A {{candidate}} debate held in Duluth {{featured a}} crowd that jeered Oberstar, with Oberstar {{calling for a}} more civil atmosphere at the next debate. The second debate centered on economic issues. Cravaack argued that <b>the</b> 2003 <b>Bush</b> <b>tax</b> cuts should be continued on all tax brackets to stimulate employment, and Oberstar said he would end the {{tax cut for the}} top two percent of earners, because the lowered tax had caused part of the deficit.|$|R
25|$|In Congress, Kennedy {{supported}} <b>the</b> <b>Bush</b> <b>tax</b> cuts, {{he voted}} for the Medicare Prescription Drug Plan, and the Deficit Reduction Act of 2005. Kennedy's reputation as a reformer was further enhanced by his sponsorship of the line item veto, a lifetime ban on all members of Congress becoming lobbyists, full deductibility of medical expenses, no parole for sex offenders, and Medicare Plan Enrollment Fraud Protection.|$|E
25|$|As {{the economy}} {{improved}} and job creation continued during {{his second term}} (2013â€“2017), <b>the</b> <b>Bush</b> <b>tax</b> cuts were allowed to expire for the highest income taxpayers and a spending sequester (cap) was implemented, to further reduce the deficit back to typical historical levels.

50|$|The table below {{shows the}} {{estimated}} impact on taxpayers from the tax increases that occurred with the expiration of the Obama payroll tax cut and partial expiration of <b>the</b> <b>Bush</b> income <b>tax</b> cuts. <b>The</b> estimated impact is given as an average for the different income levels. The baseline that is used is if the payroll tax cut had been extended, new health care tax not implemented, and <b>Bush</b> income <b>tax</b> cuts fully extended. Average federal taxes include individual income taxes, corporate income taxes, payroll taxes, and estate taxes {{as a percentage of}} average cash income.|$|R
50|$|Cornyn {{voted to}} {{permanently}} repeal {{the estate tax}} and for raising the estate tax exemption to $5 million.

However, he stands opposed to extending the 2011 payroll tax holiday.|$|R
50|$|The American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 {{resulted}} in the expiration of <b>the</b> lower <b>Bush</b> income <b>tax</b> rates for individual taxpayers earning over $400,000 and couples earning over $450,000. This was expected to bring in an additional $600 billion over ten years.|$|R
25|$|Capital gains, dividends, and {{estate tax}} rates were also {{increased}} {{relative to the}} 2003â€“2012 levels; these also mainly affect high-income and wealthy households. It was estimated to increase revenues by $600 billion over a decade, roughly one-fifth of the amount if the tax cuts {{had been allowed to}} expire at all income levels. Stated another way, it extended roughly 80% of <b>the</b> <b>Bush</b> <b>tax</b> cuts indefinitely. Separately enacted as part of Obamacare, individual mandates and tobacco taxes impacted the middle class slightly, although they were mainly designed to adjust behavior rather than gather revenue.|$|E
25|$|Economists, {{including}} the Treasury Secretary {{at the time}} Paul O'Neill and 450 economists, including ten Nobel prize laureates, who contacted Bush in 2003, opposed the 2003 tax cuts {{on the grounds that}} they would fail as a growth stimulus, increase inequality and worsen the budget outlook considerably (see Economists' statement opposing <b>the</b> <b>Bush</b> <b>tax</b> cuts). Some argued the effects of the tax cuts have been as promised as revenues actually increased (although income tax revenues fell), the recession of 2001 ended relatively quickly, and economic growth was positive.|$|E
25|$|Further, income {{inequality}} {{can be measured}} both before-tax and after-tax, so <b>the</b> <b>Bush</b> <b>tax</b> cuts primarily impacted the latter measurements. President Bush did not take deliberate steps to address pre-tax inequality, which involves policies such as raising the minimum wage, strengthening collective bargaining power (unions), limiting executive pay, and protectionism. CBO reported that the top 1% paid an average total federal tax rate of 32.5% in 2000, 30.1% in 2004, and 28.2% in 2008. The top 1% paid an average federal income tax rate of 24.5% in 2000 and 20.4% in 2008.|$|E

He supports lowered middle-class taxes, but increasing taxes for persons making more than $1 million per year. In 2010 he supported extending <b>the</b> expiring <b>Bush</b> <b>tax</b> cuts [...] "at least until the economy is clearly recovering." ...|$|R
25|$|Democrats reacted {{positively}} to John Kerry's acceptance speech. With Democrats strongly opposed to <b>the</b> <b>Bush</b> administration, John Kerry {{spent most of}} his speech appealing to independent voters and to swing voters. He promised to train 40,000 new active duty troops, to implement all the recommendations of the 9/11 Commission, to cut the national deficit in half within four years, to cut middle class <b>taxes</b> while repealing <b>the</b> <b>Bush</b> administration's <b>tax</b> cuts for those making more than US$200,000 per year, to stop privatization of Social Security, and to expand stem cell research.|$|R
25|$|Among other positions, Edwards was {{generally}} pro-choice and supported {{affirmative action and}} the death penalty.
