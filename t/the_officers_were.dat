5|$|In 1927 the {{gendarmerie}} {{was reporting}} a strength of 160 officers, 2,522 gendarmes and 551 rural policemen. Even {{at this late}} date only about 40 of <b>the</b> <b>officers</b> <b>were</b> Haitian, the majority being United States Marines and sailors.|$|E
5|$|Alarmed by {{the actions}} of the Temeraires crew, Campbell met with Vice-Admiral Sir Andrew Mitchell the {{following}} day and informed him of the mutineers' demands. Mitchell reported the news to the Admiralty while Campbell returned to Temeraire and summoned the crew on deck once more. He urged them to return to duty, and then dismissed them. Meanwhile, discipline had begun to break down among the mutineers. Several of the crew became drunk, and some of <b>the</b> <b>officers</b> <b>were</b> struck by rowdy seamen. When one of the marines who supported the mutiny was placed in irons for drunken behaviour and insolence, a crowd formed on deck and tried to free him. The officers resisted these attempts and as sailors began to push and threaten them, Campbell gave the order for the marines to arrest those he identified as the ringleaders. The marines hesitated, but then obeyed the order, driving the unruly seamen back and arresting a number of them, who were immediately placed in irons. Campbell ordered the remaining crew to abandon any mutinous actions, and deprived of its leaders, the mutiny collapsed, though <b>the</b> <b>officers</b> <b>were</b> on their guard for several days afterwards and the marines were ordered to carry out continuous patrols.|$|E
5|$|In a {{postscript}} to the day's {{action the}} British frigate Castor, captured {{early in the}} campaign by Nielly, was attacked and retaken by the smaller HMS Carysfort under Captain Francis Laforey at the frigate action of 29 May 1794. Some of the crew were released by their rescuers but most, including <b>the</b> <b>officers,</b> <b>were</b> not aboard, having been taken onto Nielly's flagship Sans Pareil.|$|E
50|$|In 2004 {{it emerged}} that a prison officer at Forest Bank {{had been caught}} trying to sell heroin to inmates. <b>The</b> <b>officer</b> <b>was</b> caught with 147 wraps of the drug hidden in his shoes when he started his shift. <b>The</b> <b>officer</b> <b>was</b> jailed for <b>the</b> offence.|$|R

5|$|In {{contrast}} with other international media reports, Peruvian health officials downplayed the incident. Jorge López Tejada, the Regional Health Director for Puno, Peru, denied any serious medical situation existed. However, a health brigade arrived with personnel and medication {{to the site}} on 18 September, reporting that the odors rising from the crater were causing medical issues. Earlier, Tejada had stated that <b>the</b> <b>officers</b> <b>were</b> dizzy, nauseous and some were vomiting.|$|E
5|$|In {{response}} Macrinus dispatched his Praetorian prefect Ulpius Julianus to {{the region}} with a contingent of troops he considered strong enough to crush the rebellion. However, this force soon joined the faction of Elagabalus when, during the battle, they turned on their own commanders. <b>The</b> <b>officers</b> <b>were</b> killed and Julianus' head {{was sent back to}} the emperor.|$|E
5|$|Father Francis Gleeson (28 May 1884 – 26 June 1959) was an Irish Roman Catholic {{priest who}} served as a British Army {{chaplain}} during Ireland's involvement in the First World War. Educated at seminaries near Dublin, Gleeson was ordained in 1910 and worked at a home for the blind before volunteering for service upon the outbreak of war. Commissioned into the Army Chaplains' Department and attached to the 2nd Battalion, Royal Munster Fusiliers he served with them at the First Battle of Ypres. During this battle Gleeson is said to have taken command of the battalion after all <b>the</b> <b>officers</b> <b>were</b> incapacitated by the enemy. He was highly regarded by his men for tending to the wounded under fire, visiting the frontline trenches, and bringing gifts.|$|E

50|$|On June 29, 2002, 20-year-old Joseph Finley Jr., who was Cherokee and Seminole, {{was shot}} {{fourteen}} times by a Cleveland police <b>officer.</b> <b>The</b> <b>officer</b> <b>was</b> off-duty at <b>the</b> {{time of the}} shooting and an excessive force lawsuit <b>was</b> filed.

5|$|Four of <b>the</b> <b>officers</b> <b>were</b> of {{the line}} and {{responsible}} for the handling of the vessel and operation of guns during battle, while the engineering officers were considered a class unto themselves. In Monitors turret, Greene and Stodder supervised loading and firing of the two 11-inch Dahlgrens. Each gun was crewed by eight men. Thus, during battle, at least 18 men were present in the turret. In Worden's report of 27 January 1862 to Welles, he stated he believed 17 men and 2 officers would be the maximum number in the turret that allowed the crew to work without getting in each other's way.|$|E
5|$|In a 5–4 opinion, the Court {{held that}} forced {{extraction}} {{and analysis of}} a blood sample is not compelled testimony; therefore, it does not violate the Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination. The Court also held that intrusions into the human body ordinarily require a search warrant. However, the Court ruled that the involuntary, warrantless blood sample taken {{in this case was}} justified under the Fourth Amendment's exigent circumstances exception because evidence of blood alcohol would be destroyed by the body's natural metabolic processes if <b>the</b> <b>officers</b> <b>were</b> to wait for a warrant. In 2013, the Supreme Court clarified in Missouri v. McNeely that the natural metabolism of alcohol in the bloodstream is not a per se exigency that would always justify warrantless blood tests of individuals suspected of driving under the influence of alcohol.|$|E
5|$|Lashed together, Temeraire and Fougueux {{exchanged}} fire, Temeraire initially {{clearing the}} French ship's upper deck with small arms fire. The French rallied, but the greater {{height of the}} three-decked Temeraire compared to the two-decked Fougueux thwarted their attempts to board. Instead Harvey dispatched his own boarding party, led by First-Lieutenant Thomas Fortescue Kennedy, which entered Fougueux via her main deck ports and chains. The French tried to defend the decks port by port, but were steadily overwhelmed. Fougueuxs captain, Louis Alexis Baudoin, had suffered a fatal wound earlier in the fighting, leaving Commander François Bazin in charge. When he learned that nearly all of <b>the</b> <b>officers</b> <b>were</b> dead or wounded and {{that most of the}} guns were out of action, Bazin surrendered the ship to the boarders.|$|E

5|$|Napoleon's {{lightning}} campaign {{exposed the}} Austrian indecisive command structure and poor supply apparatus. Mack completely misread the French dispositions and scattered his forces; as the French defeated each unit separately, the surviving Austrians withdrew toward the Ulm fortifications. Napoleon arrived to take personal command {{of close to}} 80,000men. At Ulm on 16 October Karl Mack surrendered his encircled army of 20,000infantry and 3,273cavalry. <b>The</b> <b>officers</b> <b>were</b> released {{on the condition that}} they not serve against France until formally exchanged for French officers captured by the Austrians, an agreement to which they held.|$|E
5|$|Shortly after Mercer {{had arrived}} in the trenches, a massive German {{artillery}} bombardment began, heavy calibre shells destroying trenches and caving in dugouts, killing many Canadian soldiers. Mercer was trapped in a dugout and then stunned by a huge shell burst which wounded most of his staff and the officers of the battalion he was inspecting. The more badly wounded among <b>the</b> <b>officers</b> <b>were</b> transported to an underground field hospital but Mercer was left behind with wounded aide Captain Lynam Gooderham, and so was not present when the hospital was buried by the explosion of four mines which preceded a large-scale German attack. In the confused situation, Mercer and Gooderham attempted to escape the advancing enemy but inadvertently ran into crossfire, where Mercer's leg was broken by a bullet.|$|E
5|$|The College {{is almost}} entirely self-financed, {{and is not a}} {{recipient}} of any regular public funding. Its officers do have official salaries, which {{are paid for by the}} Crown. The salaries of <b>the</b> <b>officers</b> <b>were</b> raised during the reign of King James I, but were reduced under William IV. These salaries per annum reflected the living costs of the day; however today the amount is seen only as nominal payment. In addition to their official duties, the heralds have for many centuries undertaken private practice in heraldry and genealogy, for which professional fees are charged.|$|E

5|$|The NWMP was {{commanded}} by {{a relatively small}} team of commissioned officers, having an establishment of 25 officers in its early years, of whom around a quarter were medical and veterinary officers, rising to 50 after 1885, a ratio of approximately one officer to every twenty enlisted men. <b>The</b> <b>officers</b> <b>were</b> usually from middle- or upper-class backgrounds, and were typically Canadian-born; deliberate {{attempts were made to}} reflect the different religious and ethnic groups that made up white Canadian society. They depended on political patronage from the government of the day in Ottawa for their appointment and career progression, and were typically {{selected on the basis of}} their military experience, service in the police ranks or previous study at the Royal Military College in Ontario.|$|E
5|$|The next {{attack was}} on {{officers}} from the 9th Parachute Battalion on 28June. <b>The</b> <b>officers</b> <b>were</b> dining at a restaurant when two men of the Irgun approached and fired machine guns through the windows. One officer was killed outright while several others were wounded. The officers returned fire and the car the gunmen were escaping in crashed; later examination revealed {{at least one of}} them had been wounded. On 19July two police officers on patrol in Haifa were shot in the back and killed. The following day the 3rd Parachute Brigade cordoned the area and imposed a night time curfew, which was not lifted until 30July.|$|E
5|$|The {{officer corps}} formed {{part of the}} social elite in Canada, and {{considered}} themselves to be much closer to the prestigious, regular military than to their equivalents in the local police forces. Commissioned officers were expected to join and participate in an officers' mess, which the police based on the corresponding military tradition. Many were members of the Freemasons, a popular movement among Protestant Canadians. <b>The</b> <b>officers</b> <b>were</b> made Justices of Peace, giving them powers to try civilian cases, and they also had authority to summarily try members of the force itself, potentially imprisoning constables for up a year for even minor offences.|$|E

5|$|The ship's crew {{compartments}} {{were arranged}} such that <b>the</b> <b>officers</b> <b>were</b> accommodated in the forecastle. This arrangement {{was found to}} be unsatisfactory, and not repeated in later classes. Von der Tann was designed to be fitted with a lattice mast, but the ship received standard masts instead. In 1914, spotting posts were attached to the masts in order to observe the fall of artillery fire. In 1915, seaplane trials were conducted on Von der Tann, and a crane was attached on the aft deck to lift the seaplane aboard the ship. Von der Tann had originally been equipped with anti-torpedo nets, but these were removed towards the end of 1916.|$|E
5|$|After {{decades of}} upheavals and rebellions mounted by Arab tribes in the Middle East, the Ottomans {{attempted}} to reassert centralized {{control over the}} Arab vilayets. In 1657, they sent an expeditionary force led mostly by Arab sipahi officers from central Syria to reassert Ottoman authority in Nablus and its hinterland, {{as part of a}} broader attempt to established centralized rule throughout the empire at that time. In return for their services, <b>the</b> <b>officers</b> <b>were</b> granted agricultural lands around the villages of Jabal Nablus. The Ottomans, fearing that the new Arab land holders would establish independent bases of power, dispersed the land plots to separate and distant locations within Jabal Nablus to avoid creating contiguous territory controlled by individual clans. Contrary to its centralization purpose, the 1657 campaign allowed the Arab sipahi officers to establish their own increasingly autonomous foothold in Nablus. The officers raised their families there and intermarried with the local notables of the area, namely the ulama and merchant families. Without abandoning their nominal military service, they acquired diverse properties to consolidate their presence and income such as soap and pottery factories, bathhouses, agricultural lands, grain mills and, olive and sesame oil presses.|$|E
5|$|During {{the evening}} of 1 May 1991, four Croatian policemen entered Borovo Selo in an {{unauthorised}} attempt to replace a Yugoslav flag in the village with a Croatian one. The attempt resulted in an armed clash. Two of the policemen were wounded and taken prisoner, {{and the other two}} fled after sustaining minor injuries (one a wounded foot and the other a grazing wound to the head). According to the Croatian Ministry of the Interior, the police had been patrolling the Dalj–Borovo Selo road {{at the time of the}} incident. Even though <b>the</b> <b>officers</b> <b>were</b> assigned to the Osijek police administration, the Vinkovci police administrationwhich was assigned authority over the Vukovar municipalityasked the Vukovar police station to contact Šoškoćanin about the incident. Vukovar police contacted him at 4:30a.m., but Šoškoćanin reportedly said he knew nothing. At 9:00a.m., Vinkovci police chief Josip Džaja telephoned Šoškoćanin and received the same answer. When Reihl-Kir contacted Šoškoćanin half an hour later, the latter confirmed the incident and said the police had shot at members of the local population, wounding one. Reihl-Kir failed to secure the release of the two captured officers.|$|E
