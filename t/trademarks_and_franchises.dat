Plamondon Companies is run by Jim Plamondon and Peter Plamondon Jr., the two sons of Peter Plamondon Sr., head of the restaurant division at Marriott when the Roy Rogers brand was created. Roy Rogers was relaunched as Roy Rogers Franchise Company, LLC in 2002 when Plamondon Companies bought the <b>trademark</b> <b>and</b> <b>franchise</b> system from Imasco, the former owner of Hardee's. In 1997, CKE Restaurants acquired Hardee's from Imasco, but Imasco {{held on to the}} Roy Rogers <b>trademark</b> <b>and</b> <b>franchise</b> system. Plamondon negotiated with Imasco for three years before a private purchase agreement was reached in 2002. The first new Roy Rogers restaurant after many years of decline was opened in Frederick, Maryland by Plamondon in 2000.|$|R

5000|$|The Fillmore <b>trademark</b> <b>and</b> <b>franchise</b> {{has defined}} music {{promotion}} in the United States {{for the last}} 50 years. From 2003-13 auxiliary writers of the times surrounding the 1960s, and Graham family lawsuits, tell the narrative of the Fillmore phenomena and how the black community there was disenfranchised. The best way to set the historic record straight concerning Charles Sullivan and Bill Graham is to review what Graham left in his own words. Historically the first time Graham mentioned Charles Sullivan, in print, is this article from 1988, [...] "The Historic Fillmore's New Tradition by Keith Moerer" ...|$|R

5000|$|Rax was {{originally}} known as JAX Roast Beef, founded by Jack Roschman in 1967, in Springfield, Ohio. [...] In 1969, Roschman sold the chain to General Foods, who then {{changed the name}} of the restaurants to RIX Roast Beef. General Foods ran the chain until 1978, when most of the restaurants closed down. The remaining 10 units were franchised units owned by the Restaurant Administration Corporation (RAC), headed by J. Patrick Ross, a franchisee of multiple restaurant chains including Wendy's, Ponderosa Steak House, and Long John Silver's. RAC purchased the remainder of RIX from General Foods, and returned the JAX name to the restaurants. RAC eventually decided to focus on the roast beef business, <b>and</b> began <b>franchising</b> the chain. The JAX restaurants were renamed Rax to be more suitable for <b>trademarking</b> <b>and</b> <b>franchising,</b> with the first Rax branded franchise restaurant opening in Columbus, Ohio. RAC was renamed Rax Systems Inc., then again to Rax Restaurants Inc. in 1982. [...] By then, Rax had grown to over 221 restaurants in 25 states.|$|R

40|$|The {{market for}} the {{licensing}} of intellectual property and other intangibles is growing rapidly in the United States. At {{the same time there}} is increasing interest in the value of these intangible assets and their impact on economic growth, productivity, and competitiveness. Despite this interest there are large gaps in the available data to track and evaluate the impact of intangibles and intellectual property on the economy. This paper describes the measurement challenges and presents both aggregate and industrial sector preliminary estimates of receipts of royalties and license fees. These estimates can be used to better assess the macroeconomic impact of intangibles and to trace the flows and impacts across industries. This paper uses previously unpublished estimates of BEA International Services trade data for royalty and licensing fees by industry sector to improve the current output measures for domestic producers of intellectual property by estimating the share of royalty income earned by different types of intangible assets for 2002. These assets are patents and trade secrets, copyrights, <b>trademarks,</b> <b>and</b> <b>franchised</b> business formats. The estimates show that U. S. receipts for the use of these intellectual property assets totaled approximately $ 92 billion dollars in 2002; this compares with rental and leasing receipts for automobiles, machinery, computers, and other equipment of $ 95. 1 billion dollars in 2002...|$|R
40|$|One of {{the most}} complex, yet least-analyzed, {{organizational}} relationships is that between a religious denomination and its member congregations. This study maintains that denominational-congregational relationships in US Christian churches can be informed by the franchise model of organizations. It is argued {{that it is possible}} to envision a continuum of church organizational structures, ranging from a branch office, through various forms of franchise arrangements (including company owned, business format, <b>and</b> <b>trademark</b> <b>franchises)</b> to freestanding entrepreneurial units. By studying those situations where the franchise model explains denominational behavior, and contrasting them with those situations where the franchise model is not a good fit, we can learn more about denominational structures.

40|$|Both <b>trademarks</b> <b>and</b> {{geographical}} indications are legal devices which regulate communication to markets about a product. Trademarks indicate the commercial origin {{of a good}} or service while {{geographical indications}} signal the geographic origin. Both tools also legally grant exclusive rights to certain uses of a word or symbol. Tension arises when the tools overlap on the same subject matter. The thesis asks: is coexistence between the devices in the TRIPS Agreement possible? Are the concepts of <b>trademarks</b> <b>and</b> geographical indications related? If so, how? If not, how? Does the marketing literature of business recognize both registered <b>trademarks</b> <b>and</b> geographical indications as aspects of the same branding exercise? The thesis finds that as <b>trademarks</b> <b>and</b> geographical indications are unique devices that are not interchangeable {{and it is possible}} for legislation to simultaneously protect both, <b>trademarks</b> <b>and</b> geographical indications are therefore not in conflict and can instead be viewed as harmonious tools...|$|R
