5|$|Recent {{years have}} seen a {{professional}} rapprochement between the two groups. DOs have been admitted to full active membership in the American Medical Association since 1969. <b>The</b> <b>AMA</b> has invited {{a representative of the}} American Osteopathic Association to sit as a voting member in <b>the</b> <b>AMA</b> legislative body, the house of delegates.|$|E
5|$|In 1969, the American Medical Association (AMA) {{approved}} a measure allowing qualified osteopathic physicians as full and active {{members of the}} Association. The measure also allowed osteopathic physicians to participate in AMA-approved intern and residency programs. However, the American Osteopathic Association rejected this measure, claiming it {{was an attempt to}} eliminate the distinctiveness of osteopathic medicine. In 1970, AMA President Dwight L. Wilbur, M.D. sponsored a measure in the AMA's House of Delegates permitting <b>the</b> <b>AMA</b> Board of Trustees' plan for the merger of D.O. and M.D. professions. Today, a majority of osteopathic physicians are trained alongside MDs, in residency programs governed by the ACGME, an independent board of <b>the</b> <b>AMA.</b>|$|E
50|$|The first hosts for {{the first}} {{telecast}} of <b>the</b> <b>AMAs</b> were Helen Reddy, Roger Miller, and Smokey Robinson. Helen Reddy not only hosted the show but also became the first female artist to win an AMA for Favorite Pop/Rock Female artist. For the first decade or so, <b>the</b> <b>AMAs</b> had multiple hosts, each representing a genre of music. For instance, Glen Campbell would host the country portion (Campbell, in fact, has co-hosted <b>the</b> <b>AMAs</b> more times than any other host or co-host), while other artists would co-host to represent his/her genre. In recent years, however, there has been one single host.|$|R

5|$|Kenneth Leroy Roberts (born December 31, 1951 in Modesto, California) is an American former {{professional}} motorcycle racer {{and racing}} team owner. In 1978, {{he became the}} first American to win a Grand Prix motorcycle racing world championship. He was also a two-time winner of <b>the</b> <b>A.M.A.</b> Grand National Championship. Roberts is one of only four riders in American Motorcyclist Association (AMA) racing history to win <b>the</b> <b>AMA</b> Grand Slam, representing Grand National wins at a mile, half-mile, short-track, TT Steeplechase and road race events.|$|E
5|$|On December 23, the Senate voted 60–39 to end {{debate on}} the bill: a cloture vote to end the filibuster. The bill then passed, also 60–39, on December 24, 2009, with all Democrats and two independents voting for it, and all Republicans against (except Jim Bunning, who did not vote). The bill was {{endorsed}} by <b>the</b> <b>AMA</b> and AARP.|$|E
5|$|In the United States, laws {{regulating}} physician licenses {{are governed}} by the states. Between 1901 and 1989, osteopathic physicians lobbied state legislatures to pass laws giving those with a D.O. degree the same legal privilege to practice medicine as those with an M.D. degree. In many states, the debate was long and protracted. Both the AOA and <b>the</b> <b>AMA</b> were heavily involved in influencing the legislative process. The first state to pass such a law was California in 1901, the last was Nebraska in 1989.|$|E

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Ama</b> are Japanese skin divers, {{predominantly}} women, who traditionally {{dive for}} shellfish and seaweed {{wearing only a}} loincloth and {{who have been in}} action for at least 2,000 years. Starting in the twentieth century, they have increasingly been regarded as a tourist attraction. They operate off reefs near the shore, and some perform for sightseers instead of diving to collect a harvest. They have been romanticized as mermaids.|$|E
5|$|In 1971, Roberts won <b>the</b> <b>AMA</b> Rookie of the Year Award. In {{his first}} {{professional}} race {{as an expert}} class rider in 1972, Roberts rode to victory at the Grand National short-track race in the Houston Astrodome. Roberts {{made a name for}} himself that year by battling the dominant Harley-Davidson factory dirt track team aboard an underpowered Yamaha XS 650 motorcycle, making up for his lack of horsepower with sheer determination. He finished the season ranked fourth in the country. In 1973, in just his second season as an expert, Roberts won the national championship, amassing a record 2,014 points in the 25-race series.|$|E
5|$|The American Medical Association (AMA) {{opposed the}} act because the tax was imposed on {{physicians}} prescribing cannabis, retail pharmacists selling cannabis, and medical cannabis cultivation and manufacturing; instead of enacting the Marihuana Tax Act <b>the</b> <b>AMA</b> proposed cannabis {{be added to}} the Harrison Narcotics Tax Act. This approach was unappealing to some legislators who feared that adding a new substance to the Harrison Act would subject that act to new legal scrutiny. Since the federal government had no authority under the 10th Amendment to regulate medicines, that power being reserved by individual states in 1937, a tax was the only viable way to legislate marijuana.|$|E

50|$|The American Music Awards (AMAs) is {{an annual}} American music awards show, created by Dick Clark in 1973 for ABC when the network's {{contract}} to air the Grammy Awards expired. Unlike the Grammys, which are awarded {{on the basis}} of votes by members of the Recording Academy, <b>the</b> <b>AMAs</b> are determined by a poll of the public and fans, who can vote through <b>the</b> <b>AMAs</b> website. <b>The</b> award statuette is manufactured by New York firm Society Awards.|$|R
50|$|In 2002, {{the sisters}} were {{inducted}} into <b>the</b> <b>AMA's</b> Motorcycle Hall of Fame {{and into the}} Sturgis Motorcycle Museum & Hall of Fame during 2003.|$|R
5|$|After his Grand Prix racing career {{ended in}} 1983, Roberts briefly {{considered}} an auto racing career {{before deciding to}} field a Grand Prix team. In 1984, he entered a team into the 250cc world championship with riders Wayne Rainey and Alan Carter using Yamaha bikes. In 1986 he moved up to the 500cc world championship with riders Randy Mamola and Mike Baldwin. After returning to the United States to compete in <b>the</b> <b>AMA</b> Superbike championship, Wayne Rainey re-joined the team in 1988, finishing in third place in his inaugural 500cc season then, improving to second place behind Eddie Lawson in 1989. In 1990, Roberts secured the financial support of the Marlboro cigarette company, and his team became the official Yamaha factory racing team. Rainey and John Kocinski won the 500cc and 250cc world championships in 1990, making Roberts the most successful team manager in Grand Prix racing at the time. Rainey {{went on to win}} three consecutive 500cc world championships for Roberts' team. After Rainey was left paralyzed in a crash at the 1993 Italian Grand Prix, the Roberts team continued racing with Luca Cadalora as their main rider, but struggled during a period dominated by Honda and their rider, Mick Doohan.|$|E
5|$|Realizing that Roberts {{needed more}} help if his racing career {{was going to}} progress, Aksland {{introduced}} Roberts to airline pilot and amateur motorcycle racer Jim Doyle, who would become Roberts' personal manager. In 1971, Doyle and Roberts approached Triumph's American distributor {{to ask about the}} possibility of a sponsored ride, but were told that Roberts was too small for one of their bikes. They then turned to the American Yamaha importer's team, who agreed to make Roberts a factory sponsored rider at the age of 19. Yamaha asked the head of their American racing program, former 250cc world champion Kel Carruthers to help guide Roberts' racing career. It marked the beginning of a long and productive relationship between the two men. Carruthers ended his riding career after the 1973 season to concentrate full-time on managing Roberts' and Yamaha's efforts in <b>the</b> <b>A.M.A.</b> Grand National Championship, a series which encompassed events in four distinctive dirt track disciplines plus road racing.|$|E
25|$|Profession and Monopoly, a book {{published}} in 1975, also condemned <b>the</b> <b>AMA</b> for limiting {{the supply of}} physicians and inflating the cost of medical care in the U.S. The book asserted that physician supply is kept low by <b>the</b> <b>AMA</b> to ensure high pay for practicing physicians. It states that in the United States the number, curriculum, and size of medical schools are restricted by state licensing boards controlled by representatives of state medical societies associated with <b>the</b> <b>AMA.</b> The book is also critical of the ethical rules adopted by <b>the</b> <b>AMA</b> which restrict advertisement {{and other types of}} competition between professionals. It points out that advertising and bargaining can result in expulsion from <b>the</b> <b>AMA</b> and legal revocation of licenses. Restrictions against advertising that is not false or deceptive were dropped from <b>the</b> <b>AMA</b> Code of Medical Ethics in 1980 (AMA Ethical Policy E-5.02). The book also states that before 1912 <b>the</b> <b>AMA</b> included uniform fees for specific medical procedures in its official code of ethics. The AMA's influence on hospital regulation was also criticized in the book.|$|E

50|$|<b>The</b> 2009 <b>AMA</b> Supercross season (for {{sponsorship}} reasons, <b>the</b> Monster Energy <b>AMA</b> Supercross Championship) was <b>the</b> thirty-sixth <b>AMA</b> Supercross Championship season.

25|$|The belief by <b>the</b> <b>AMA</b> {{and other}} {{industry}} groups predicting an oversupply {{of doctors and}} negative issues as a result, <b>the</b> <b>AMA</b> limiting at least somewhat {{the number of new}} doctors, has picked up criticism for having created a problem in the other direction. More recently, <b>the</b> <b>AMA</b> changed its position and acknowledged a doctor shortage in multiple areas instead, predicting U.S. trends could worsen.|$|E
25|$|Claims that <b>the</b> <b>AMA</b> generates $70 {{million in}} revenue through its {{stewardship}} of Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) codes {{appear to be a}} mischaracterization. The estimate is based on a distortion of the transparent financial information <b>the</b> <b>AMA</b> voluntarily offers in its Annual Report. <b>The</b> <b>AMA</b> has publicly reported this figure represents income from its complete line of books and products, which include more than 100 items, not just CPT.|$|E
25|$|In 1849, <b>the</b> <b>AMA</b> {{established}} a board to analyze quack remedies and nostrums and to enlighten {{the public about}} their nature and their dangers. Relationships were developed with pharmaceutical companies {{in an effort to}} curb the patent medicine crisis and consolidate the patient base around the medical doctor. By the turn of the 20th century, <b>the</b> <b>AMA</b> had created a Committee on National Legislation to represent <b>the</b> <b>AMA</b> in Washington and re-organized as the national organization of state and local associations. Intense political pressure by <b>the</b> <b>AMA</b> resulted in unlimited and unrestricted licensing only for medical physicians that were trained in AMA-endorsed colleges. By 1901, state medical boards were created in almost every state, requiring licentiates to provide a diploma from an AMA-approved medical college. By 1910, <b>the</b> <b>AMA</b> was a powerful force; this was the beginning of organized medicine.|$|E

25|$|As such, <b>the</b> <b>AMA</b> {{created an}} {{advisory}} committee to assess the nature of disparities within different racial and ethnic groups.

In 2005, <b>the</b> <b>AMA</b> president Edward Hill gave a keynote address to the Gay and Lesbian Medical Association at its annual conference. Since that time, <b>the</b> <b>AMA</b> has worked closely with GLMA to develop AMA policy towards better health care access for LGBT patients and better working environments for LGBT physicians and medical students.|$|E
