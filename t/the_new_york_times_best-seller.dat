25|$|In 1995, Stern {{signed an}} advance deal with ReganBooks worth around $3 million {{to write his}} second book, Miss America.

Following its release on November 7, 1995, Miss America sold 33,000 copies at Barnes & Noble stores which set a new one-day record for the chain, and 120,000 in its first week.

According to Publishers Weekly, 1.39 million copies were sold in 1995 alone which ranked it the year's third best-selling book. As with Private Parts, Stern's book signings attracted thousands. His November 30, 1995 appearance on The Tonight Show with Jay Leno caused controversy after he appeared on the show with two bikini-clad women who kissed each other and received spanks from Stern. Leno, who urged that both acts would be edited out from the final broadcast, walked off the stage after the segment without thanking Stern.|$|E

The book's title incorporated the Fox News slogan, [...] "Fair and Balanced", and included a cover photo of Fox News commentator Bill O'Reilly; in August that year Fox News sued, claiming infringement of its registered trademark phrase. A federal judge found the lawsuit [...] "wholly without merit." [...] The incident with Fox focused media attention on Franken's book and, according to him, greatly increased its sales. The publicity resulting from the lawsuit propelled Franken's yet-to-be-released book to number 1 on Amazon.com.|$|E
500|$|Jonathan Strange & Mr Norrell is an {{alternative}} history set in 19th-century England during the Napoleonic Wars. It {{is based on the}} premise that magic once existed in England and has returned with two men: Gilbert Norrell and Jonathan Strange. Centering on the relationship between these two men, the novel investigates the nature of [...] "Englishness" [...] and the boundary between reason and madness. It has been described as a fantasy novel, {{an alternative}} history, and an historical novel and draws on various Romantic literary traditions, such as the comedy of manners, the Gothic tale, and the Byronic hero. Clarke's style has frequently been described as a pastiche, particularly of 19th-century British writers such as Charles Dickens, Jane Austen, and George Meredith. The supernatural is contrasted with and highlighted by mundane details and Clarke's tone combines arch wit with antiquarian quaintness. The text is supplemented with almost 200 footnotes, outlining the backstory and an entire fictional corpus of magical scholarship. The novel was well received by critics and reached number three on <b>the</b> <b>New</b> <b>York</b> <b>Times</b> <b>best-seller</b> list, remaining on the list for eleven weeks.|$|E
500|$|A play {{based on}} The Disenchanted opened on Broadway in 1958. Also that year, Scott's Hollywood {{mistress}} Sheilah Graham published a memoir, Beloved Infidel, about his last years. Beloved Infidel became a bestseller {{and later a}} film starring Gregory Peck as Scott and Deborah Kerr as Graham. The book and movie painted him in a more sympathetic light than the earlier works. In 1970, however, the history of Scott and Zelda's marriage saw its most profound revision in a book by Nancy Milford, then {{a graduate student at}} Columbia University. [...] Zelda: A Biography, the first book-length treatment of Zelda's life, became a finalist for the Pulitzer Prize and the National Book Award, and figured for weeks on <b>The</b> <b>New</b> <b>York</b> <b>Times</b> <b>best-seller</b> list. The book recast Zelda as an artist in her own right whose talents were belittled by a controlling husband. Thus in the 1970s Zelda became an icon of the feminist movement—a woman whose unappreciated potential had been suppressed by patriarchal society. When Tennessee Williams dramatized the Fitzgeralds' lives in the 1980s in Clothes for a Summer Hotel, he drew heavily on Milford's account. A caricature of Scott and Zelda emerged: as epitomes of the Jazz Age's glorification of youth, as representatives of the Lost Generation, and as a parable about the pitfalls of too much success.|$|E
