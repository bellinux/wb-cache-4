5|$|On February 5, 2013, Colorado {{representative}} Jared Polis introduced Ending Federal Marijuana Prohibition Act of 2013 (H.R. 499; 113th Congress), a {{bill that}} would decriminalize marijuana on the federal level, instead <b>treating</b> <b>it</b> as a substance to be regulated in a similar manner to alcohol. The act has not been approved by Congress.|$|E
5|$|Shale oil {{extraction}} is usually performed above ground (ex situ processing) by mining the oil shale and then <b>treating</b> <b>it</b> in processing facilities. Other modern technologies perform the processing underground (on-site or in situ processing) by applying heat and extracting the oil via oil wells.|$|E
5|$|For many years, the {{classification}} of Herrerasaurus was unclear because it was known from very fragmentary remains. It was hypothesized to be a basal theropod, a basal sauropodomorph, a basal saurischian, or not a dinosaur at all but another type of archosaur. However, {{with the discovery of}} an almost complete skeleton and skull in 1988, Herrerasaurus has been classified as either an early theropod or an early saurischian in at least five recent reviews of theropod evolution, with many researchers <b>treating</b> <b>it</b> at least tentatively as the most primitive member of Theropoda.|$|E
50|$|Most South African {{writers and}} cases treat this as one branch of privilege. Zeffertt et al., in Chapter 17 of their book, <b>treat</b> <b>it</b> as two {{separate}} branches. This article <b>treats</b> <b>it</b> as one branch with different rules for different situations.|$|R
50|$|There are {{controversial}} {{political implications}} {{about the nature}} of Rusyn as a language or dialect. Some Slovak and Hungarian linguists <b>treat</b> <b>it</b> as a distinct language (with its own ISO 639-3 code), whereas most scholars of Slavic languages <b>treat</b> <b>it</b> as a Southwestern dialect of Ukrainian.|$|R
50|$|Some authors <b>treat</b> <b>it</b> as {{a synonym}} of Juniperus taxifolia from the Bonin Islands, while others <b>treat</b> <b>it</b> as {{a variety of}} it, Juniperus taxifolia var. lutchuensis. It is {{probably}} best considered a separate species as it has a distinct DNA profile clearly different from J. taxifolia.|$|R
5|$|In {{the summer}} of 2009, the Parliamentary {{authorities}} undertook a three-week conservation project to repair and restore the statue. It consisted of removing accumulated dirt and an old coating of black wax, repatinating the bronze surface to return it to its original colour and <b>treating</b> <b>it</b> with a clear wax as protection from pollution and the elements. The bas reliefs on the pedestal were also cleaned and treated, as was the pedestal itself.|$|E
5|$|Protactinium(V) {{chloride}} {{is prepared}} by reacting protactinium oxide with carbon tetrachloride at temperature of 200–300°C. The by-products (such as PaOCl3) are removed by fractional sublimation. Reduction of protactinium(V) chloride with hydrogen at about 800°C yields protactinium(IV) chloride – a yellow-green solid which sublimes in vacuum at 400°C; {{it can also}} be obtained directly from protactinium dioxide by <b>treating</b> <b>it</b> with carbon tetrachloride at 400°C.|$|E
5|$|Antibiotics are {{not usually}} used for gastroenteritis, {{although}} they are sometimes recommended if symptoms are particularly severe or if a susceptible bacterial cause is isolated or suspected. If antibiotics are to be employed, a macrolide (such as azithromycin) is preferred over a fluoroquinolone due to higher rates {{of resistance to the}} latter. Pseudomembranous colitis, usually caused by antibiotic use, is managed by discontinuing the causative agent and <b>treating</b> <b>it</b> with either metronidazole or vancomycin. Bacteria and protozoans that are amenable to treatment include Shigella Salmonella typhi, and Giardia species. In those with Giardia species or Entamoeba histolytica, tinidazole treatment is recommended and superior to metronidazole. The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends the use of antibiotics in young children who have both bloody diarrhea and fever.|$|E
50|$|This {{species is}} of {{doubtful}} status. Aurivillius <b>treated</b> <b>it</b> as a west African race of Belenois thysa in 1898, but <b>treated</b> <b>it</b> as distinct in 1910. Larsen regarded it to possibly {{be a natural}} hybrid and suggested that <b>it</b> should be <b>treated</b> as a nomen dubium in 2005.|$|R

5|$|Despite their {{technical}} complexity, neither {{device was}} revolutionary {{by the standards}} of the time. However, the total vision of their design was. Evans was attempting a radical shift in thinking about the manufacturing process, <b>treating</b> <b>it</b> as a continuous integrated whole rather than a series of isolated processes. Thus, manufacturing could be a fully automated production line. The missing link was materials handling, and Evans's mill designs sought to feed materials continuously through a system without the need for any human intervention. This was the first fully automated industrial process, and the idea of continuous production was proved to be a critical ingredient of the industrial revolution, and would ultimately lay the foundation for modern mass production.|$|E
5|$|Impurities {{are mostly}} arsenic, antimony, bismuth, zinc, copper, silver, and gold. The melt is {{treated in a}} reverberatory furnace with air, steam, and sulfur, which oxidizes the {{impurities}} except for silver, gold, and bismuth. Oxidized contaminants float {{to the top of}} the melt and are skimmed off. Metallic silver and gold are removed and recovered economically by means of the Parkes process, in which zinc is added to lead. The zinc dissolves silver and gold, both of which, being immiscible in lead, can be separated and retrieved. De-silvered lead is freed of bismuth by the Betterton–Kroll process, <b>treating</b> <b>it</b> with metallic calcium and magnesium. The resulting bismuth dross can be skimmed off.|$|E
5|$|Smelting, {{which is}} an {{essential}} part of the primary production, is often skipped during secondary production. It is only performed when metallic lead had undergone significant oxidation. The process is similar to that of primary production in either a blast furnace or a rotary furnace, with the essential difference being the greater variability of yields. The Isasmelt process is a more recent method that may act as an extension to primary production; battery paste from spent lead–acid batteries has sulfur removed by <b>treating</b> <b>it</b> with alkali, and is then treated in a coal-fueled furnace in the presence of oxygen, which yields impure lead, with antimony the most common impurity. Refining of secondary lead is similar to that of primary lead; some refining processes may be skipped depending on the material recycled and its potential contamination, with bismuth and silver most commonly being accepted as impurities.|$|E

Another way to <b>treat</b> <b>it</b> may be to replace the internal body fluid and receive respiratory support. Quinidine {{is an example of a}} Na channel blocker which may be helpful in curing heart block.|$|R

5|$|The {{integration}} process repeatedly brought Indian and Pakistani leaders into conflict. During negotiations, Jinnah, representing the Muslim League, strongly supported {{the right of}} the princely states to remain independent, joining neither India nor Pakistan, an attitude which was diametrically opposed to the stance taken by Nehru and the Congress and which was reflected in Pakistan's support of Hyderabad's bid to stay independent. Post-partition, the Government of Pakistan accused India of hypocrisy on the ground that there was little difference between the accession of the ruler of Junagadh to Pakistan—which India refused to recognise—and the accession of the Maharajah of Kashmir to India, and for several years refused to recognise the legality of India's incorporation of Junagadh, <b>treating</b> <b>it</b> as de jure Pakistani territory.|$|E
25|$|These two {{approaches}} {{differ in their}} view of narcissism, with the former <b>treating</b> <b>it</b> as a disorder, thus as discrete, and the latter <b>treating</b> <b>it</b> as a personality trait, thus as a continuum. These two strands of research tend loosely to stand in a divergent relation to one another, although they converge in places.|$|E
