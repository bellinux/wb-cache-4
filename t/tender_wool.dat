40|$|Australia {{produces}} 98 % of the world’s fine wool. Fine wool attracts price premiums at auction. Fine wool can be {{much more}} susceptible to breakage {{as a result of}} low staple strength or ‘tender ’ wool. <b>Tender</b> <b>wool</b> receives discounts that can range from 3 % to up to 30 %. This can greatly impact on farm wool income. To evaluate the management strategies for overcoming poor staple strength, producers need to determine whether staple strength is a problem in their wool clip, and the cost to their business in forgone income as a result of strength discounts. This study explored whether wool of poor staple strength is a problem in South West Victoria. Based on a Case Study and on industry data it was found that wool with poor staple strength can comprise almost a third of wool sold. The severity of price discounts for <b>tender</b> <b>wool</b> changes from year to year. In years of high wool prices, and high discounts and premiums, staple strength was a key contributor to profit. In these years, profit from wool of sound strength almost doubled the profit from <b>tender</b> <b>wool.</b> In years where the wool price and discounts were low, the difference in operating profit was very marginal, with staple strength having little effect on final profits. Managing to avoid or reduce <b>tender</b> <b>wool</b> in reproducing ewes cost $ 3. 29 per ewe to improve staple strength by 5 N/ktex. There were increases in income of $ 8. 98 per ewe in 2001 - 02 and $ 7. 09 in 2002 - 03 but management costs outweighed the income benefits in years of lower wool prices...|$|E
40|$|Noil is {{the waste}} fiber {{produced}} during combing of staple fibers, particularly wool and cotton, and {{is made up}} of short fiber, fiber entanglements, and foreign material. In worsted combing, noil levels are typically in the range 4 – 8 % for good ‘combing ’ wools, but may be as high as ~ 15 % for short or <b>tender</b> <b>wool.</b> Noil is an important economic consideration in combing because it represents lost pro-duction and for this reason has been studied over a long time [1 – 6]. A small reduction in noil, given the throughput of modern plants, represents {{a significant increase in the}} return to the comber. For example, a reduction of 0. 5 % in the noil for a wool combing plant with the capacity of 15 Mkg/year represents an increase in return of about 515, 000 AUD per year at April 2008 Eastern Market indicator prices (928 AUD/kg) [7]. The value of noil can be set a...|$|E
40|$|A {{study was}} {{conducted}} {{to examine the relationship between}} fibre shedding and staple strength in Merino weaners genetically different in staple strength and fed different levels of nutrition. Fibre shedding at the point of break along the staple was estimated using 3 different techniques: (i) a subjective scoring system of wool follicle activity, based on their morphology in transverse skin sections; (ii) the number of fibres with club-ends after differential staining to identify remnants of the shed-follicle bulb; and (iii) changes in the number of fibres in the cross-section along individual staples. Irrespective of the technique used, the estimated proportion of shed fibres did not differ significantly between the sheep bred for sound and <b>tender</b> <b>wool,</b> but increased significantly (P < 0 · 05) in response to adverse nutritional conditions. Across all treatments, there was a significant (r 2 = 0 · 63; P < 0 · 001) correlation between the proportion of shutdown follicles and the percentage decrease in the number of fibres in the staple cross-section, although the average difference between the techniques was 11 · 5...|$|E
50|$|At least 40 staples must be {{measured}} {{to in order}} to conform to the Australian Standard. Wools under 30 newtons per kilotex are considered <b>tender.</b> Currently <b>wools</b> over 40 newtons per kilotex are preferred and attract a premium. Seasonal conditions or the health of the sheep may influence the soundness (strength) of the wool.|$|R
40|$|Pasture {{production}}, ewe {{and lamb}} growth, ewe wool production and diet quality were studied on lucerne-subterranean clover pastures at Wagga Wagga, New South Wales. Lucerne was sown at rates of 0. 75 to 3. 0 kg/ha, and the pastures were rotationally grazed with Border Leicester x Merino ewes at 9. 6 or 12. 7 sheep/ha, the ewes lambing in August- September. Lucerne density declined by 45 % over the 3 years on all treatments. The clover cultivar sown, Woogenellup, had low persistence, particularly at 12. 7 sheep/ha. The density of lucerne {{had little effect}} on annual wool and lamb production, although the ewes grew faster on the denser lucerne in summer and the sparser lucerne in winter. At 12 - 7 sheep/ha, there was an extra 19 % total lamb weight by the end of November and an extra 22 % of finer wool (1 ¦m) annually, but the fleeces had a higher proportion of wool tenderness. The major limitations of the lucerne-subterranean clover pastures to sheep production were the low quality of the diet in early summer, and low pasture production in late winter. In early summer the lucerne was rapidly consumed, leaving only moderate quality clover and grass residues, which limited lamb growth, while in winter pregnancy toxaemia occurred, fleeces were <b>tender</b> and <b>wool</b> growth was low, particularly during a drought in 1976...|$|R
25|$|As {{the economy}} {{recovered}} {{during the second}} half of the 1930s, a number of substantial improvements were made to the RNA's exhibition facilities. In 1936, Gailey called <b>tenders</b> for a <b>Wool</b> Hall, additions to the pig and horse pavilions, new Stock & Station Agents' offices and dining hall and a new yearling sale ring. New concrete roads and additional seating accommodation were provided. The old Industrial Pavilion was demolished in 1938 and its replacement, designed by Richard Gailey Jnr and covering an area of 3.5 acres, was completed along Gregory Terrace in June 1939 at a cost of £40,000. A new electricity hall at the corner of Gregory Terrace and Costin Street was also completed for the 1939 show – reputedly the first show pavilion in Australia dedicated entirely to electricity exhibits. (The Hall of Science, as it was later known, was demolished in 1986 to make way for a new Exhibition Building).|$|R
40|$|This {{project was}} part of a larger CSIRO {{experiment}} which was examining the factors involved in the development of <b>tender</b> <b>wool.</b> In order to understand the effect of nutritional variations on wool quality, changes in cellular activity and morphology within the wool follicle were examined. Six sheep with a history of producing low staple strength wool (3 ̆c 25 N/ktex) and six sheep with a history of producing high staple strength wool (3 ̆e 30 N/ktex) were selected. The experiment ran for 18 weeks, for the first 10 weeks the sheep were fed a restricted ration to achieve a weight loss of approximately 175 g/day. From weeks 11 to 18, the sheep were fed an iso-energetic ration containing low or high protein. The sheep were weighed weekly and colchicine treated skin biopsies were collected at 0, 2, 10, 11, 12 and 18 weeks, embedded in paraffin and serial sectioned. The work carried out for this Honours project involved assessing wool follicles from these sheep to determine the stage of the growth cycle, the mitotic rate and the area of the follicle bulb. Although group differences were not evident between the different diets and staple strengths, this study demonstrated a high correlation between the number of mitotically active cells in the follicular bulb, the area of the follicular bulb, live-weight of the sheep, clean wool weight and fibre diameter (r = 84. 5...|$|E
