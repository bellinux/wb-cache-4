5|$|Following Jones' rejection, Garrard vetoed a {{bill that}} would have allowed the {{legislature}} to select the state's presidential and vice-presidential electors; despite the fact that the law ran contrary to the state constitution, Garrard's veto further strained his relations with <b>the</b> <b>Senate.</b> After <b>the</b> <b>Senate</b> rejected nominee William Trigg, the state's newspapers openly talked of an executive-legislative feud and claimed <b>the</b> <b>Senate</b> had its own favorite candidate for the position and would not accept anyone else. When <b>the</b> <b>Senate</b> rejected Willis Green in January 1804, Garrard declared that he would make no more nominations for the position. Accusations of bad faith were exchanged between the governor and <b>the</b> <b>Senate,</b> after which Garrard nominated John Adair, the popular Speaker of the House. <b>The</b> <b>Senate</b> finally confirmed this choice.|$|E
5|$|In 2003, Dar {{returned}} to Pakistan after several months’ of stay outside Pakistan.

During his tenure as Member of <b>the</b> <b>Senate,</b> he served as Parliamentary Leader of PML-N in <b>the</b> <b>Senate.</b> He was re-elected to <b>the</b> <b>Senate</b> in the 2006 senate election, this time for six years.|$|E
5|$|Senate {{committees}} can {{be affected}} by the party composition of <b>the</b> <b>Senate.</b> The Clerk of <b>the</b> <b>Senate,</b> Harry Evans, argued that a government majority of seats in <b>the</b> <b>Senate</b> resulted in limitations on what the committees inquired into, and how readily governments responded to their queries and requests for information. Statistics published by centrist political party the Australian Democrats have been used to support the contention that committee operations have been inhibited by government control of <b>the</b> <b>Senate,</b> particularly in respect of selection of topics for committee inquiry. However Senator Minchin, the leader of the government in <b>the</b> <b>Senate</b> in the mid-2000s, pointed out that their political rivals had previously cut off debate on more bills in <b>the</b> <b>Senate</b> than had his government.|$|E

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Senate</b> {{freshman}} class of 1910 brought new hope to the reformers. Fourteen of the thirty newly elected senators {{had been elected}} through party primaries, which amounted to popular choice in their states. More {{than half of the}} states had some form of primary selection for <b>the</b> <b>Senate.</b> <b>The</b> <b>Senate</b> finally joined the House to submit the Seventeenth Amendment to the states for ratification, nearly ninety years after it first was presented to <b>the</b> <b>Senate</b> in 1826.|$|E
5|$|Thus amended, <b>the</b> <b>Senate</b> bill (S. 2973) {{was passed}} {{unanimously}} by <b>the</b> <b>Senate</b> on July 20, after only {{ten minutes of}} debate.|$|E
5|$|A typical {{session of}} <b>the</b> <b>Senate</b> {{begins with a}} call to order by the President of <b>the</b> <b>Senate.</b> After the call to order, the {{previous}} day's journal is approved, petitions are heard, and orders involving committee and leadership appointments or changes to the rules are presented. First, readings of legislation take place. Senators are then given leeway to introduce any visitors, often people observing its deliberations from the gallery above <b>the</b> <b>Senate</b> chamber. Then the Senators consider legislation. They begin with unfinished business from the previous session, then consider legislation and special orders with accompanying reports from committees. At {{the discretion of the}} presiding officer, <b>the</b> <b>Senate</b> may adjourn at any time, unless a majority of members present object to adjournment.|$|E

5|$|A typical year in {{the life}} of a Senate {{legislation}} committee will see it conduct eight days of hearings around budget estimates, in three sessions: February (additional estimates), May/June (the main budget estimates) and October/November (supplementary budget estimates). In addition, it will typically conduct several inquiries into pieces of legislation being considered by the parliament. A references committee will conduct inquiries into policy issues referred to it by <b>the</b> <b>Senate.</b> Each of these inquiries will usually result in a report tabled in <b>the</b> <b>Senate</b> (there may be exceptions if an election intervenes during the committee's deliberations). A consolidated list of the reports prepared by all Senate committees since 1970 is published by the Department of <b>the</b> <b>Senate.</b>|$|E
5|$|After his censure, McCarthy {{continued}} senatorial duties {{for another}} {{two and a half}} years, but his career as a major public figure had been unmistakably ruined. His colleagues in <b>the</b> <b>Senate</b> avoided him; his speeches on <b>the</b> <b>Senate</b> floor were delivered to a near-empty chamber or were received with conspicuous displays of inattention.|$|E
5|$|After his inauguration, Obama {{announced}} {{to a joint}} session of Congress in February 2009 his intent to work with Congress to construct a plan for healthcare reform. By July, a series of bills were approved by committees within the House of Representatives. On <b>the</b> <b>Senate</b> side, from June to September, <b>the</b> <b>Senate</b> Finance Committee held a series of 31 meetings to develop a healthcare reform bill. This group—in particular, Democrats Max Baucus, Jeff Bingaman and Kent Conrad, along with Republicans Mike Enzi, Chuck Grassley and Olympia Snowe—met for more than 60 hours, and the principles that they discussed, in conjunction with the other committees, became the foundation of <b>the</b> <b>Senate</b> healthcare reform bill.|$|E

5|$|Although {{he made no}} pretence {{regarding}} the significance of <b>the</b> <b>Senate</b> under his absolute rule, those senators he deemed unworthy were expelled from <b>the</b> <b>Senate,</b> and {{in the distribution of}} public offices he rarely favoured family members; a policy that stood in contrast to the nepotism practiced by Vespasian and Titus. Above all, however, Domitian valued loyalty and malleability in those he assigned to strategic posts, qualities he found more often in men of the equestrian order than in members of <b>the</b> <b>Senate</b> or his own family, whom he regarded with suspicion, and promptly removed from office if they disagreed with imperial policy.|$|E
5|$|Although {{his second}} term began {{simultaneously}} with Washington's, John Adams was sworn into office for that term on December 2, 1793 in <b>the</b> <b>Senate</b> Chamber of Congress Hall.

5|$|As {{presiding}} {{officer of}} <b>the</b> <b>Senate,</b> Johnson was {{called on to}} cast a tie-breaking vote fourteen times, more than all of his predecessors save John Adams and John Calhoun.

5|$|Back at Rome, Tiberius instituted the Sodales Augustales, a priesthood of {{the cult}} of Augustus which Germanicus became a member of. When news arrived of his raid, Tiberius commemorated his {{services}} in <b>the</b> <b>Senate</b> with elaborate, but insincere praise: the proceedings gave him joy that the mutiny had been suppressed, but anxiety at the glory and popularity afforded to Germanicus. <b>The</b> <b>Senate,</b> in absence of Germanicus, voted {{that he should be}} given a triumph. Ovid's Fasti dates <b>the</b> <b>Senate</b> vote of Germanicus' triumph to 1 January AD 15.|$|E
5|$|Beginning {{around the}} year 350 BC, the {{senators}} and the plebeian tribunes began to grow closer. <b>The</b> <b>Senate</b> began giving tribunes more power, and the tribunes began to feel indebted to <b>the</b> <b>Senate.</b> As the tribunes and the senators grew closer, plebeian senators began to routinely secure the office of tribune for {{members of their own}} families. Also, this period saw the enacting of the plebiscitum Ovinium, which transferred the power to appoint new senators from the consuls to the censors. This law also required the censors to appoint any newly elected magistrate to <b>the</b> <b>Senate,</b> which probably resulted in {{a significant increase in the}} number of plebeian senators.|$|E
5|$|Beginning in {{the summer}} of 54 BC, a wave of {{political}} corruption and violence swept Rome. This chaos reached a climax in January of 52 BC, when Clodius was murdered in a gang war by Milo. On 1 January 49 BC, an agent of Caesar presented an ultimatum to <b>the</b> <b>senate.</b> The ultimatum was rejected, and <b>the</b> <b>senate</b> then passed a resolution which declared that if Caesar did not lay down his arms by July of that year, he would be considered an enemy of the Republic. Meanwhile, the senators adopted Pompey as their new champion against Caesar. On 7 January of 49 BC, <b>the</b> <b>senate</b> passed a senatus consultum ultimum, which vested Pompey with dictatorial powers. Pompey's army, however, was composed largely of untested conscripts. On 10 January, Caesar crossed the Rubicon with his veteran army (in violation of Roman laws) and marched towards Rome. Caesar's rapid advance forced Pompey, the consuls and <b>the</b> <b>senate</b> to abandon Rome for Greece. Caesar entered the city unopposed.|$|E

5|$|Brown {{resigned}} from the Advisory Council on October 25, 1894 to run for <b>the</b> <b>Senate.</b> He was elected in November 1894 and served continuously through 1904.
