40|$|A new {{approach}} {{for improving the}} accuracy of altimetry-derived sea level anomalies (SLAs) near the coast is presented. Estimation of SLAs is optimized using optimal waveform retracking through a fuzzy multiple retracking system and the most appropriate detiding method. With the retracking system, fuzzy-retracked SLAs become available within 5 km of the coast; meanwhile it becomes more important to use pointwise tide modelling rather than state-of-the-art global tidal models, as the latter leave residual ocean <b>tide</b> <b>signals</b> in retracked SLAs. These improvements are demonstrated for Jason- 2 waveforms {{in the area of}} the Great Barrier Reef, Australia. Comparing the retrieved SLAs with in situ tide gauge data from Townsville and Bundaberg stations showed that the SLAs from this study generally outperform those from conventional methods, demonstrating that adequate waveform retracking and detiding are equally important in bringing altimetry SLAs closer to the coast...|$|E
40|$|Internal {{waves at}} tidal frequencies, i. e., the {{internal}} tides, are a prominent source of {{variability in the}} ocean associated with significant vertical isopycnal displacements and currents. Because the isopycnal displacements are caused by ageostrophic dynamics, they contribute uncertainty to geostrophic transport inferred from vertical profiles in the ocean. Here it is demonstrated that a newly developed model of the main semidiurnal (M 2) internal tide derived from satellite altimetry {{may be used to}} partially remove the tide from vertical profile data, as measured by the reduction of steric height variance inferred from the profiles. It is further demonstrated that the internal tide model can account for a component of the near-surface velocity as measured by drogued drifters.

40|$|In situ {{measurements}} of internal tides are typically characterized by high temporal variability, with strong dependence on stratification, mesoscale eddies, and background currents commonly observed. Thus, {{it is surprising}} to find phase-locked internal tides detectable by satellite altimetry. An important {{question is how much}} tidal variability is missed by altimetry. We address this question in several ways. We subset the altimetry by season and find only very small changes [...] an important exception being internal tides in the South China Sea where we observe strong seasonal dependence. A wavenumber-domain analysis confirms that throughout most of the global ocean there is little temporal variability in altimetric internal-tide signals, at least in the first baroclinic mode, which is the mode that dominates surface elevation. The analysis shows higher order modes to be significantly more variable. The results of this study have important practical implications for the anticipated SWOT wide-swath altimeter mission, for which removal of internal <b>tide</b> <b>signals</b> is critical for observing non-tidal submesoscale phenomena...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Unmodeled sub-daily ocean S 2 <b>tide</b> <b>signals</b> that alias into lower {{frequencies}} {{have been}} detected {{in the analysis of}} gravity recovery and climate experiment (GRACE) space gravity fields of GRGS. The most significant global S 2 ali-ased signal occurs off the northwest coast of Australia in a shallow continental shelf zone, a region with high tidal ampli-tudes at a period of 161 days. The GRACE S 2 aliased equiva-lent water height grids are convolved with Green’s functions to produce GRACE aliased tidal loading (GATL) vertical displacements. The analysis of hourly global positioning sys-tem (GPS) vertical coordinate estimates at permanent sites in the region confirms the presence of spectral power at the S 2 frequency when the same ocean tide model (FES 2004) was used. Thus, deficiencies in the FES 2004 ocean tide model are detected both directly and indirectly by the two inde-pendent space geodetic techniques. Through simulation, the admittance (ratio of amplitude of spurious long-wavelength output signal in the GRACE time-series to amplitude of un-modeled periodic signals) of the GRACE unmodeled S 2 tidal signals, aliased to a 161 -day period, is found to have a global average close to 100 %, although with substantial spatial var-iation.

The present work extends {{the investigation of the}} average thermal fields in the northern hemisphere of Venus, by including the VIRTIS-H data. We show results in the pressure range of 100 - 4. mbar, which corresponds to the altitude range of 65 - 80. km. With these new retrievals, we are able to compare the thermal structure of the Venus' mesosphere in both hemispheres. The major thermal features reported in previous investigations, i. e. the cold collar at about 65 - 70 °S latitude, 100. mbar pressure level, and the asymmetry between the evening and morning sides, are confirmed here. By comparing the temperatures retrieved by the VIRTIS spectrometer in the North and South we find that similarities exist between the two hemispheres. Solar thermal tides are clearly visible in the average temperature fields. To interpret the thermal <b>tide</b> <b>signals</b> (otherwise impossible without day site observations), we apply model simulations using the Venus global circulation model Venus GCM (Lebonnois, S., Hourdin, F., Forget, F., Eymet, V., Fournier, R.

Spectrum analysis revealed permanent signals of tide measurements during all seasons, which represented semidiurnal and diurnal barotropic tides. The other signal periods of 8. 13, 6. 10 - 6. 32, 4. 16 and 1. 02 - 1. 05 h were not detected in all seasons, which were related to shallow water compound and overtides of principle solar and lunar constituents and to seiches generated in the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aqaba. Spatial and temporal distributions of temperature, salinity and density showed significant differences between months in the coastal and offshore region and no significant differences among the coastal sites, between the surface and bottom waters and between coastal and offshore waters. Therefore, the temporal and spatial variation of water properties in the northernmost Gulf of Aqaba behave similarly compared to other parts. The coastal current below 12 m depth was weak (3 - 6 cms- 1) and fluctuated from east-northeastward to west-southwestward (parallel to the shoreline), which {{may be related to}} the effect of bottom topography and/or current density due to differential cooling between eastern and western parts in the study area, and wind-induced upwelling and downwelling in the eastern and western side, respectively.

40|$|In a {{pioneering}} study, Wahr & Bergen developed the widely adopted, pseudo-normal mode framework for predicting {{the impact of}} anelastic effects on the Earth's body tides. Lau et al. have recently derived an extended normal mode treatment of the problem (as well as a minor variant of the theory known as the direct solution method) that makes full use of theoretical developments in free oscillation seismology spanning the last quarter century and that avoids a series of assumptions and approximations adopted in the traditional theory for predicting anelastic effects. There are two noteworthy differences between these two theories: (1) the traditional theory only considers perturbations to the eigenmodes of an elastic Earth, whereas the new theory augments this set of modes to include the relaxation modes that arise in anelastic behaviour; and (2) the traditional theory approximates the complex perturbation to the tidal Love number as a scaled version of the complex perturbation to the elastic moduli, whereas the new theory computes the full complex perturbation to each eigenmode. In this study, we highlight the above differences using a series of synthetic calculations, and demonstrate that the traditional theory can introduce significant error in predictions of the complex perturbation to the Love numbers due to anelasticity and the related predictions of tidal lag angles. For the simplified Earth models we adopt, the computed lag angles differ by ∼ 20 per cent. The assumptions in the traditional theory {{have important implications for}} previous studies that use model predictions to correct observables for body <b>tide</b> <b>signals</b> or that analyse observations of body tide deformation to infer mantle anelastic structure. Finally, we also highlight the fundamental difference between apparent attenuation (i. e. attenuation inferred from observations or predicted using the above theories) and intrinsic attenuation (i. e. the material property investigated through experiments), where both are often expressed in terms of lag angles or Q^- 1. In particular, we demonstrate the potentially significant (factor of two or more) bias introduced in estimates of Q^- 1 and its frequency dependence in studies that have treated Q^- 1 determined from tidal phase lags or measured experimentally as being equal. The observed or theoretically predicted lag angle (or apparent Q^- 1) differs from the intrinsic, material property due to inertia, self-gravity and effects associated with the energy budget. By accounting for these differences we derive, for a special case, an expression that accurately maps apparent attenuation predicted using the extended normal mode formalism of Lau et al. into intrinsic attenuation. The theory allows for more generalized mappings which may be used to robustly connect observations and predictions of tidal lag angles to results from laboratory experiments of mantle materials.

For the barotropic component the dispersion of the results as a function of the length and period of analysis is only significant over the areas of ocean mesoscale activity (noise impact) and of large barotropic tidal signal (separating the different components of the tidal signal proves difficult). The baroclinic tidal signal appears to be surprisingly stable over many areas located around strong topographic gradients like submarine ridges. A methodology has been developed to draw a map of these areas.

40|$|The {{seasonal}} {{cycle of}} the main lunar tidal constituent M 2 is studied globally by an analysis of a high-resolution ocean circulation and tide model (STORMTIDE) simulation, of 19 years of satellite altimeter data, and of multiyear tide-gauge records. The barotropic seasonal tidal variability is dominant in coastal and polar regions with relative changes of the tidal amplitude of 5 – 10 %. A comparison with the observations shows that the ocean circulation and tide model captures the seasonal pattern of the M 2 tide reasonably well. There are two main processes leading to the seasonal variability in the barotropic tide: First, seasonal changes in stratification on the continental shelf affect the vertical profile of eddy viscosity and, in turn, the vertical current profile. Second, the frictional effect between sea-ice and the surface ocean layer leads to seasonally varying tidal transport. We estimate from the model simulation that the M 2 tidal energy dissipation at the sea surface varies seasonally in the Arctic (ocean regions north of 60 °N) between 2 and 34 GW, whereas in the Southern Ocean, it varies between 0. 5 and 2 GW. The M 2 internal tide is mainly affected by stratification, and the induced modified phase speed of the internal waves leads to amplitude differences in the surface <b>tide</b> <b>signal</b> of 0. 005 – 0. 0150 m. The seasonal signals of the M 2 surface tide are large compared to the accuracy demands of satellite altimetry and gravity observations and emphasize the importance to consider seasonal tidal variability in the correction processes of satellite data...|$|R
30|$|Tidal {{records show}} that the tsunami arrived at 07 : 11 (UTC), with a maximum height (half amplitude) of 182  cm (Japan Meteorological Agency 2013). The {{dominant}} period of the tsunami {{between the first and}} seventh waves was around 20  min. The maximum amplitude of Z, observed in the second peak, was 1.6  nT. The predominant period of both waveforms was consistently about 20  min. The arrival times of the magnetic signal were recorded at 06 : 50 showing that the initial magnetic signal preceded the initial <b>tide</b> gauge <b>signal</b> by about 20  min. The first peak of the magnetic signal preceded that of the tsunami wave by about 14  min, and the third through seventh magnetic peaks preceded those of the tsunami waves by about 5  min. For our purposes, the locations of the tidal and magnetic stations can be considered the same. Thus, the magnetic variations were detected 5 – 20  min ahead of the tsunami.|$|R
40|$|Observations of mean flow, tidal {{characteristics}} and variability, from the slope west of Vestfjorden, Norway (approximately 68. 5 °N) — obtained during the NEAT GIN 1989 experiment — are described. Current meter measurements confirm {{the presence of}} a slope current with mean values in the range 0. 2 – 0. 4 m s- 1 and directed towards the NE, approximately parallel to the isobaths, in broad agreement with drifting buoy results (e. g. Booth and Meldrum, 1987, Poulain et al., 1996). Peak mean velocities of 0. 7 m s- 1 were observed during the period when current meters were deployed. Tidal analysis of the current meter records shows that the M 2 component is always largest varying in amplitude from about 0. 05 m s- 1 {{at the top of the}} slope in about 200 m of water to about 0. 03 m s- 1 in the deeper waters on the slope. Examination of the coherence of scales in the current measurements suggests that most of the energy occurs in a slab like flow down to about 300 m. Over the deeper parts of the slope the bulk of the energy (some 80 %) was contained in sub-tidal motions with periods of order 2 days or greater, while in shallower water at the top of the slope (and in deep water below the slab layer) the 80 percentile occurred at 0. 5 days (i. e. tidal frequencies). This suggests that the bulk of the energy from baroclinic instability and eddy-like motions is contained in a ‘belt’ of activity confined to the upper stratified part of the water column and extending along the shelf edge. In this region, motions were observed to be coherent over scales of about 10 km which is comparable with the internal Rossby radius and stratification and eddy effects. Calculations of heat flux, on the other hand, suggest that coherence in the temperature fields may be on a smaller scale and of order 5 km or less. Thermistor chain measurements failed to identify a coherent internal <b>tide</b> <b>signal</b> in this region...|$|R
40|$|Ph. D. University of Hawaii at Manoa 2014. Includes bibliographical references. This study uses a {{modeling}} {{approach to}} examine the interactions between the principal semidiurnal (M 2) internal tides and the atmospherically-forced eddying ocean circulation in the Philippine Sea, a region of energetic internal tides and dynamic mesoscale circulation. Remotely generated internal tides are {{found to have a}} significant effect on local generation at the two generation sites bounding the region, the Luzon Strait and the Mariana Island Arc, by altering the amplitude and phase of bottom pressure. Internal tide generation at the Luzon Strait is found to vary due to background circulation changes over the generation site and the changing influence of remotely generated internal tides from the Mariana Arc. The varying effect of remotely generated waves results from both changing generation energy levels at the Mariana Arc and variability in the propagation of the internal tides across the Philippine Sea. The interactions with the subtidal ocean circulation result in significant spatial and temporal variability in internal tide propagation and dissipation, and hence the energy available for mixing. Close to the generation site, mixing is dominated by high-mode internal tide dissipation, while in far-field the influence of the mesoscale energy on internal tide dissipation is significant. The results provide insight into the mechanisms of variability of the baroclinic tides and highlight the importance of considering both the remotely generated internal tides and the subtidal dynamics to estimate internal tide energetics. The strong and highly variable internal tides are found to have a significant impact on state estimates and predictions of the subtidal circulation in the region. Using 4 -D Variational Data Assimilation, we find that including the tides in our model provides significantly improved subtidal predictions across the Philippine Sea. This result is two-fold; firstly, high error bars must be applied to the observations if the model does not include the tides to account for the unresolved internal <b>tide</b> <b>signal,</b> and secondly, the tidal dynamics influence the subtidal circulation. Predictions from a model that does not resolve the tides are particularly poor in the Kuroshio and South China Sea regions where tidal dynamics influence water mass properties. Overall, this study makes an important contribution towards understanding the dynamic connection between internal tides and the eddying ocean circulation and the implications for predictability in regions that contain significant energy at both dynamic scales...|$|R
40|$|Zero drift {{and solid}} Earth tide {{corrections}} to static relative gravimetric data cannot be ignored. In this paper, a new {{principal component analysis}} (PCA) algorithm is presented to extract the zero drift and the solid Earth <b>tide,</b> as <b>signals,</b> from static relative gravimetric data assuming that the components contained in the relative gravimetric data are uncorrelated. Static relative gravity observations from Aug. 15 to Aug. 23, 2014 are used as statistical variables to separate the signal and noise with PCA to obtain desired signals. The results of the linear drift extracted by PCA {{are consistent with those}} calculated by the least squares linear fitting, and the differences only reach to 10 − 2  μGal/day order of magnitude. Furthermore, PCA is used to estimate the solid Earth tide from the relative gravimetric data corrected by the zero drift. The statistical results are consistent with the results derived from the solid Earth tide correction provided by the internal software of the CG- 5 gravimeter (SCINTREX Limited Ontario Canada). The statistical results {{of the differences between the}} two methods are both less than 8  μGal, and the RMSs for 9 days are all less than 5  μGal...|$|R
40|$|The Indonesian Mixing program (INDOMIX) was {{designed}} to quantify the very strong mixing that transforms Pacific waters into isohaline Indonesian Waters in the Indonesian archipelago. The turbulent dissipation rates and associated mixing were estimated and analyzed using a multidisciplinary approach that combines physical and geochemical in-situ observations: (1) direct measurements of the dissipation using a microstructure profiler, (2) use of density-based fine-scale methods applied to CTD and XCTD data, and (3) study of the vertical distribution of natural radionuclides (radium isotopes and actinium- 227). Data were collected at five contrasting stations within the Indonesian archipelago, found above energetic straits or in relatively quiescent large basins. Strong instabilities, inversions of the density profiles and a very strong water mass transformation were observed. A wide range of dissipation values were obtained (between [10 (- 10), 10 (- 4) ] W kg(- 1)) with spots of higher dissipation in the ocean interior correlated with a strong internal <b>tide</b> <b>signal.</b> Both the fine-scale and micro-scale methods allow us to identify very strong energy dissipation levels above the straits, ranging between [10 (- 7), 10 (- 4) ] W kg(- 1), in contrast to lower values at stations further away from the generation sites. The dissipation for the station located {{in the center of}} the Halmahera Sea ([10 (- 9), 10 (- 8) ] W kg(- 1)) is stronger than for the Banda station ([10 (- 11), 10 (- 16) ] W kg(- 1)), which is even further away from the generation sites. The three approaches agree relatively well and provide vertical eddy diffusivities values ranging between 5 x 10 (- 4) and 5 x 10 (- 1) m(2) s(- 1), except in the Banda Sea where values are similar to the ones found in the open ocean (10 (- 6) m(2) s). CTD and XCTD profilers (deployed between stations) give estimates of dissipation all along the transit. It is found that enhanced mixing occurs preferentially above rough topography, such as in the Ombai Strait, the Halmahera Sea's northern entrance, the Buru strait and Sumba strait. Finestructure parameters are very sensitive to depth and dissipation, which differs between stations. We recommend more systematic microstructure measurement in order to tune these parameters. Surface mixing, at the base of the mixed layer is found to be very strong with values between [10 - 4, 10 (- 3) m(2) s(- 1) ]. These results confirm the modeling studies that suggest the occurrence of intensified subsurface mixing which cools the sea surface temperatures and thus strongly affects the mean and variability of the tropical climate. We conclude, therefore, that climate models need to take into account this intensified ocean mixing to properly represent the mean state of the atmosphere and its climate variability...|$|R
60|$|The {{ship from}} sea makes the lights, and judges {{of the state}} of the <b>tide</b> by the <b>signals.</b> She rounds the Mole-Head at the {{distance}} of fifty or sixty yards, and sails along a passage too narrow to admit another vessel, at the same moment, into the harbour. Here she finds from eighteen to twenty, or even twenty-four feet of water, according to circumstances. She is hauled up to the gates of a dock, which are opened at high water only. As the water falls, one gate is shut, and the entrance to the dock becomes a lock: vessels can enter, therefore, as long as there remains sufficient water in the outer harbour for a ship to float. If caught outside, however, she must lie in the mud until the ensuing tide.|$|R
40|$|The {{frequency}} spectrum of Northern Hemisphere atmospheric CO 2 concentration shows strong periodicities at 6. 2, 1. 0 and 0. 5 years. The 6. 2 year cyclicity has {{been attributed to}} non-linear interactions between the annual cycle and the atmospheric pole <b>tide.</b> The yearly <b>signal</b> is linked to terrestrial photosynthesis; phase analysis shows that annual CO 2 minima occur at a lag of approximately 85 days from insolation maxima. Variations in the nominal yearly period occur during times of anomalous anthropogenic CO 2 production. Periodicity at 6 months represents a deviation of the yearly signal from an annual sinusoid. If the yearly signal is largely sinusoidal, a plausible source of the 6 month periodicity could be cyclic phytoplankton productivity driven by natural insolation modes. Together, the three largest spectral peaks account for over 99 % of the variation in detrended CO 2 data...|$|R
