40|$|The {{future of}} Digital Video Broadcasting (DVB) is moving towards {{solutions}} for efficient delivery of interactive IP multimedia services over DVB networks to handheld terminals. One {{of the most}} promising technologies is DVB-Handheld (DVB-H), at present under standardisation. Services deployed via this type of DVB technologies should enjoy reliability comparable to TV services and high quality standards. However, the market at present does not provide effective and economical solutions for the deployment of such services over multi-domain IP networks, due to their high level of unreliability. This paper focuses on service and network management for effective deployment of DVB-H services. Experimental results are presented concerning QoS sensitivity to network performance of DVB-H services delivered over a multi-domain IP network. Moreover, a solution for efficient and cost effective service management via QoS monitoring and control and network SLA design is proposed, giving DVB-H operators the possibility of managing service QoS without being tied to <b>third</b> <b>party</b> <b>operator...</b>|$|E
40|$|Abstract— 4 G is {{expected}} to get deployed by many telecom companies in this year. Technologies employed by 4 G being tested and {{going to hit the}} commercial market soon. When fully implemented, 4 G {{is expected}} to offer high speed transmission and provide seamless handoffs across multiple high speed heterogeneous networks. These heterogeneous networks on converged platform provide access to varied services over an IPv 6 core. Convergence & high speed would provide opportunity to end user to use compounded services from varied network providers; this will lead to big challenge for accounting, Charging and billing. This paper in continuation of our previous papers [7][21] discusses a Convergent Framework Architecture (CFA) which provides a unified bill to the user for all his compounded usage across varied network operators. The CFA introduces a trusted <b>third</b> <b>party</b> <b>operator</b> called the Convergent Network Operator (CNO) to achieve a transparent charging, accounting and unified billing provisions. The functionality of the CFA is demonstrated with a prototype. We were able to realize unified bill to end user for the usage of different type of service from varied network providers. This concept and business model will bring better Quality of service (QoS) not only at competitive price but also provide independence and choice to users to opt for specif ic services from Quality network operators.

40|$|Background: In {{a larger}} picture, {{companies}} are hiring <b>third</b> <b>party</b> logistics <b>operators</b> {{who have the}} task to manage {{all or part of}} logistics operations such as storage, transport and packaging. The case company strives to constantly improve {{in order to get a}} better understanding of the requirements in connection with procurement. More and more demands are placed on the corporates responsibility along with the procurement. Corporate social responsibility describes a company’s responsibility judging by three dimensions: Ecologic, economic and social. Purpose: The purpose is to decide from a corporate social responsibility perspective which demands are meaningful while purchasing logistic services from a <b>third</b> <b>party</b> logistics <b>operator.</b> Method: This study is a case study at a <b>third</b> <b>party</b> logistics <b>operator.</b> The study is built upon an abductive research approach and the results are collected through semi- structured interviews with the company along with the three potential customers. This theoretical referencing is built from scientific article, books and websites. Conclusion: The amount of requirements put on a <b>third</b> <b>party</b> logistics <b>operator</b> from an economical responsibility perspective is twice as much with ecological responsibility perspective. The least demands is required by social responsibility. The operator’s price and quality on the service, correctly maintained goods, withholding of vehicles, ability to communicate electronically and localizing are the requirements that are made from the economical responsibilities perspective. Fuel usage and environmental class vehicles and that the operator has an environmental goal are required by ecological responsibilities perspective. The social responsibilities perspective requires long-term collaboration and fair working conditions.

40|$|Improving the {{performance}} and reducing {{the costs associated with}} export logistics chains is critical to the competitiveness of export coal mines. The fundamental practices {{associated with the use of}} export logistics chains made up of mine, trucking, rail and port operations are being challenged by the advent of <b>third</b> <b>party</b> <b>operators</b> on rail systems and the use of the Internet. Whilst individual mines can improve their processes to drive down their mining costs, they face major challenges in their endeavour to improve {{the performance}} of export logistics chains and reduce the significant logistics costs of moving coal from the mine to export ships, via the shared infrastructure of rail systems and ports. There is an increasing realisation that global competition is not only between mines but between coal export regions that are defined by their rail system and ports infrastructure. The development and use of a joint industry planning platform for the export logistics chains of the Western Australian Grain Industry has demonstrated that an industry facing significant restructuring and increased competitiveness can achieve major throughput and cost reduction gains when stakeholders in export logistics chains share key planning information using the Internet and state of the art planning tools. Joint industry planning platforms for export logistics chains are being considered or are at initial stages of development for a number of Australasian coal export logistics chains.

40|$|The main {{objective}} of this master’s thesis project was to investigate and find {{solutions to the problem}} of how to combine the SyncML synchronisation specification with object security and thus protection of personal information, such as contacts and calendar entries in mobile devices. SyncML is a new synchronisation specification agreed upon by major device developers (Ericsson, Palm, Motorola, etc.) and the major synchronisation server developers (Starfish, Puma, fusionOne, etc.). It is independent of transport (HTTP, WSP, or OBEX) platform, operating system, and application and simplifies synchronisation of personal information between dissimilar SyncML supportive devices. SyncML compliant devices are fully capable of synchronising information with a <b>third</b> <b>party</b> operated Internet based server and a desktop computer. This allows us to access, up-date and maintain information independent of Intranets or geographical position. However, synchronising and storing confidential personal information on an <b>third</b> <b>party</b> operated Internet based server entails weaknesses in our personal information security. Even if transport and storage security are used, how secure is the server where this information is stored since this server has the highest probability of being attacked. Can we really trust that an employee or other person with valid appropriated administrators access to the storage facility with the appropriate knowledge, working together with the <b>third</b> <b>party</b> server <b>operator,</b> won’t try to access our stored information? To prevent this, the personal information’s confidentiality must be guaranteed before the information leaves the device. When synchronising and exchanging personal information, the information is often marked according to a specific format. The three de-facto standard PIM formats are: (1) vCard (contact information), (2) vCalendar, and (3) iCalendar (calendar and scheduling information). These formats divide the personal information into properties. Each property is assigned to contain a small piece of the personal information entry (e. g. a telephone number, an e-mail address, the time when the calendar event begins, etc.). Furthermore to preserve the interoperability between different devices given by SyncML, authorised recipients must automatically be able to reverse the encryption process and decrypt the encrypted property value. Therefore general cryptographic formats are used (e. g. CMS, PGP and the newly developed XML Encryption). They add information needed by the recipients (e. g. algorithm used, padding method used on the plain text, etc.), encrypt the plaintext into cipher text, and decrypt the cipher text into plain text given the correct key...|$|R

The phrase, ‘African solutions to African challenges’ should thus be understood as a division of labour and responsibilities, rather than an excuse for non-African <b>third</b> <b>parties</b> to ignore Africa’s problems or African <b>third</b> <b>parties</b> acting on their own. Indeed, whilst African <b>third</b> <b>parties</b> should take the lead in mediation processes in African civil wars, non-African <b>third</b> <b>parties</b> should support these processes by lending additional strength. Through supplementing each other’s comparative advantages, African and non-African <b>third</b> <b>parties</b> can more effectively resolve civil wars in Africa...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we focus on}} the role of <b>third</b> <b>party</b> {{referrals}} in the venture capital funding process. Taking network theory as our theoretical perspective we explore if and how <b>third</b> <b>parties</b> {{play a role in the}} funding process. Hereby we focus on both the network ties between new venture teams and <b>third</b> <b>parties</b> and the network ties between VC’s and <b>third</b> <b>parties.</b> To do so we collected in depth information on 25 venture capital investment decisions and studied how <b>third</b> <b>parties</b> played a role in three investment stages being (1) deal flow, (2) the initial meeting and (3) during due diligence. Our data shows some interesting findings. (1) When a <b>third</b> <b>party</b> is involved in connecting the new venture to the VC fund, strong ties between both the venture team and the <b>third</b> <b>party</b> and between <b>third</b> <b>party</b> and VC seem to be favorable. (2) At the initial meeting between new venture and the VC, <b>third</b> <b>parties</b> don’t seem to play a role at all. And (3), during due diligence the role of <b>third</b> <b>parties</b> becomes important again as information source for VC’s, however the effectiveness of particular network ties seems to be dependent on the type of information provided by the <b>third</b> <b>party...</b>|$|R
