5|$|After {{the end of}} the war, Morales {{returned}} to her birthplace of Santiago. While few knew of her actions during the war, <b>the</b> <b>men</b> <b>she</b> served alongside remembered her well. When she appeared at the unveiling of the monument to the common Chilean roto at the Plaza Yungay, she received some of the most enthusiastic applause. After years of illness, she died in anonymity in the common room of a Santiago hospital on 25 August 1890, aged only 25. For her, widespread recognition came only after her death.|$|E
5|$|As {{they move}} around {{the city in the}} van, they pick up {{different}} men from the streets to join them. These scenes are interspersed with the scenes of Madonna singing in front of the neon screen. The video progresses like this until the intermediate verse whence Madonna is shown standing in a cage opposite to a number of men. As the bridge builds up, Madonna starts fighting with <b>the</b> <b>men.</b> <b>She</b> starts bending backwards and tying herself in knot like positions, while doing backflips and somersaults which defeats the men. The chorus starts again and Madonna and her dancers are shown skating in circles around a roller rink. The video ends with the close-up of Madonna in the purple leotard and fades into her silhouette.|$|E

The leader, Bill, announces himself as Professor Watson and says he will give a lecture on {{locating}} gold deposits in the town hall. All the miners are lured to the building, save the girl, and Bill's accomplices proceed to rob <b>the</b> <b>men.</b> <b>She</b> realizes that this meeting is unusual and goes to the town hall and witnesses the robbery, but has no way of reporting or stopping the three armed men. Struck with an idea, she returns home for her father's bear traps and sets them on the steps of town hall. The robbers back out of the town hall and step into the traps, where they are captured.|$|E

5|$|Miss Rosa meets new {{prison inmate}} Piper and offers her some advice. She reveals {{that she is}} {{suffering}} from cancer and undergoing chemotherapy. Miss Rosa is told that she needs an operation to improve her chances of survival. However the DOC refuse to fund the operation and she is told {{that she needs to}} keep having chemotherapy. The outcome of which means she is likely to die. She then reminisces about her past as bank robber in which all <b>the</b> <b>men</b> <b>she</b> kissed during heists ended up dead. She details her life to a fellow cancer patient Yusef and they bond. He decides to help her regain the adrenaline rush felt from robbery and they steal a nurse's purse. Miss Rosa is delighted to learn that Yusef has gone into remission but is sad to say goodbye.

The prosecution pointed out that Floyd had had gone to an area considered unsafe for white women, ignored warnings of black residents of staying too long there, and not been attentive to her surroundings or <b>the</b> <b>men</b> <b>she</b> passed. A relative of the Hairstons has said that their family tradition always said that Floyd had been {{having an affair with}} one of the defendants, but this was not explored at trial.|$|E
50|$|It is {{mentioned}} {{toward the end}} of the story that Mr. Evans was <b>the</b> third <b>man</b> who had threatened to cross Mrs. Merrowdene and separate her from <b>the</b> <b>man</b> <b>she</b> loved; this means that Mr. Merrowdene is <b>the</b> <b>man</b> <b>she</b> loved when she was 18 and that <b>the</b> three <b>men</b> were: her stepfather, Mr. Anthony (whom she presumably did not want to marry), and Mr. Evans.|$|R

25|$|It {{has further}} been {{suggested}} that John Milton's Mask Presented at Ludlow Castle (1634) is a sequel to Tempe Restored, a masque in which Circe had figured two years earlier, and that the situation presented there is {{a reversal of the}} Greek myth. At the start of the masque, the character Comus is described as the son of Circe by Bacchus, god of wine, and the equal of his mother in enchantment. He too changes travelers into beastly forms that 'roll with pleasure in a sensual sty'. Having waylaid the heroine and immobilized her on an enchanted chair, he stands over her, wand in hand, and presses on her a magical cup (representing sexual pleasure and intemperance), which she repeatedly refuses, arguing for the virtuousness of temperance and chastity. The picture presented is a mirror image of the Classical story. In place of the witch who easily seduces <b>the</b> <b>men</b> <b>she</b> meets, a male enchanter is resisted by female virtue.|$|E
25|$|Charlie's {{research}} often {{interferes with}} his relationships: as with Amita {{on their first}} date, for all they could talk about is mathematics; Fleinhardt {{says that it is}} a common interest and they should not struggle to avoid the subject. Charlie and Amita had several false starts. Charlie has also spent some time with his ex-girlfriend, Susan Berry (Sonya Walger), an attractive neuroscientist from London. He had lived with Susan for two years, and Larry described this as his very own Berry's phase. However, she later reveals that she is currently involved with someone else and has to return to England. Charlie attempts to start a relationship with Amita once more, though her job offer at Harvard University strains this possibility and makes him distraught for some time. Eventually, she decides to take the alternative offer at CalSci with the hope to begin a romantic relationship with him, though his fear of possible failure causes him to question whether he wants this second chance; Don cautions him about such an attitude. Amita notices his ambivalence and isn't certain if she wants to back out of the relationship, but he then pushes it forward. Pressures from their colleagues over the inappropriateness of the relationship nearly cost them, but {{by the middle of the}} third season their romantic involvement stabilizes and they have grown considerably closer. He feels rejected when Amita does not want him to meet her father, due to his expectations about <b>the</b> <b>men</b> <b>she</b> dates. Initially, he wonders if it is based on him being Jewish, but the problem is that he is not Indian-born. Alan explains that Mr. Ramanujan would like him after meeting him. Charlie and Amita state that they love each other, and have even decided to move in together, though, the actual living arrangement has not been determined. When Amita's parents finally meet him, they are rude, but warm to him later. Alan says that Charlie will have to marry her.|$|E

The United States Coast Guard closed off the river in the area, and a {{firefighting}} tug boat was used to douse the resulting fire from the river. A helicopter was used to search the river for anyone {{who may have been}} thrown into it by the blast. Refinery workers were brought in to assist with search and rescue operations, as emergency services personnel were unfamiliar with the plant's layout. Red Cross worker Joyce Baker {{was among the first to}} arrive at the scene.

2500|$|In {{the late}} 1950s, Burr {{was rumored to}} be romantically {{involved}} with Natalie Wood. Wood's agent sent her on public dates so she could be noticed by directors and producers, and so <b>the</b> <b>men</b> <b>she</b> dated could present themselves in public as heterosexuals. The dates also helped to disguise Wood's relationship with Robert Wagner, whom she later married. Burr felt enough attraction to Wood to resent Warner Bros.' decision to promote her attachment to Tab Hunter rather than him. Robert Benevides later said, [...] "He was a little bitter about it. He was really in love with her, I guess." ...|$|E

She and Eccles managed to travel from Libya to Crete in 1944 when the island was still considered dangerous. After her friend left for Athens she stayed on in Crete working for the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA), was awarded the bronze medal of the Greek Red Cross for her courage, and became a local heroine. Through UNRRA she met her husband who received many honours for acts of wartime bravery.|$|E

Over time when her husband physically abused her over some imagined wrong-doing, she {{would go out and}} do it. She started drinking and describes one drinking session in her autobiography where she was unconscious of what took place. She found herself in a village where Joshi, one of <b>the</b> <b>men</b> <b>she</b> had been drinking with brought her as his third wife. She stayed virtually imprisoned there for three years, till she was able to smuggle a letter out to her husband. He arrived with the police, and took her to the magistrate's office in the neighbouring town, [...] [...] [...] [...] where she had to testify. The magistrate sent Bandarkar to get a signature on a paper and then proceeded to rape Wadkar. Since she did not speak out about the incident, no action was taken.|$|E
2500|$|According to Rabbinic interpretation, Huldah {{said to the}} {{messengers}} of King Josiah, [...] "Tell the {{man that}} sent you to me," [...] etc. (...) , indicating by her unceremonious language that for her Josiah was like any other man. The king addressed her, and not Jeremiah, because he thought {{that women are more}} easily stirred to pity than men, and that therefore the prophetess would be more likely than Jeremiah to intercede with God in his behalf (Meg. 14a, b; comp. Seder 'Olam R. xxi.). Huldah was a relative of Jeremiah, both being descendants of Rahab by her marriage with Joshua (Sifre, Num. 78; Meg. 14a, b). While Jeremiah admonished and preached repentance to <b>the</b> <b>men,</b> <b>she</b> did the same to the women (Pesiá¸³. R. 26 [...] ). Huldah was not only a prophetess, but taught publicly in the school (Targ. to [...] ), according to some teaching especially the oral doctrine. It is doubtful whether [...] "the Gate of Huldah" [...] in the Second Temple (Mid. i. 3) has any connection with the prophetess Huldah; it may have meant [...] "Cat's Gate"; some scholars, however, associate the gate with Huldah's schoolhouse (Rashi to Kings l.c.).E.

She is generally rude and aggressive to the people around her (including Garterbelt, Brief, Stocking, <b>the</b> <b>men</b> <b>she</b> sleeps with, and most prominently Chuck), and is fond of living the celebrity lifestyle of being an Anarchy sister because it brings her closer to the men and fame she craves.
