50|$|The {{depiction}} of God the Father in art long remained unacceptable; he was typically only shown with {{the features of}} Jesus, which had become fairly standardized by the 6th century, in scenes such as the Garden of Eden. The rationale for this was {{the doctrine of the}} pre-existing Christ or Logos, which holds that Christ has existed from the beginning of time. Very simply put, {{as a member of the}} Holy Trinity of three persons in one God, representations of God could be achieved by depicting Jesus as Logos, except in the few cases where both Jesus and God the Father needed <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>shown</b> <b>separately,</b> as in scenes of the Baptism of Jesus. Alternatively God the Father was represented only by the Hand of God, which probably reached Christian art from Hellenistic Judaism, as it is prominent in the wall paintings of the 3rd century Dura-Europos synagogue in Syria. Depictions of God the Father, essentially as the Old Testament Ancient of Days, only became common in the West from about 1200 onwards, and remain controversial in Eastern Orthodoxy, still being prohibited by the Russian Orthodox Church for example (where images of the Ancient of Days, also banned, are held to represent Christ). Free-standing monumental sculpture is also avoided by the Orthodox churches, and reliefs are much rarer, especially large ones. On the other hand, icons have a slightly different theological position in Orthodoxy and play a more significant part in religious life than in Roman Catholicism, let alone the Protestant churches.|$|E
40|$|Long-baseline {{interferometry}} at infrared wavelengths {{allows the}} innermost regions around young stars <b>to</b> <b>be</b> observed. These observations directly probe {{the location of}} the dust and gas in the disks. The characteristic sizes of these regions found are larger than previously thought. These results have motivated in part a new class of models of the inner disk structure, but the precise understanding of the origin of these low visibilities is still in debate. Mid-infrared observations probe disk emission over a larger range of scales revealing mineralogy gradients in the disk. Recent spectrally resolved observations allow the dust and gas <b>to</b> <b>be</b> studied <b>separately</b> <b>showing</b> that the Brackett gamma emission can find its origin either in a wind or in a magnetosphere and that there is probably no correlation between {{the location of the}} Brackett gamma emission and accretion. In a certain number of cases, the very high spatial resolution reveals very close companions and can determine their masses. Overall, these results provide essential information on the structure and the physical properties of close regions surrounding young stars especially where planet formation <b>is</b> suspected <b>to</b> occur.

40|$|A {{big problem}} in {{analysis}} of movement data (trajectories of moving agents) is how to visualize clusters of trajectories so as to have an overview of all clusters {{and to be able}} to compare different clusters. Clusters of trajectories are not disjoint in space but intersect and overlap. Hence, they need <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>shown</b> <b>separately</b> in multiple small displays. Such displays can be legible only if the clusters are presented in a schematized form. We suggest a method for building schematic representations of clusters of trajectories. The method transforms trajectories into aggregate flows between areas. The areas are automatically defined on the basis of the spatial distribution of the characteristic points from the trajectories. We use numeric measures of the abstraction quality and techniques for controlling the quality. ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background The benefit-risk ratio {{has been}} {{proposed}} to measure the tradeoff between benefits and risks of two therapies for a single binary measure of efficacy and a single adverse event. The ratio is calculated from the difference in risk and difference in benefit between therapies. Small sample sizes or expected differences in benefit or risk can lead to no solution or problematic solutions for confidence intervals. Methods Alternatively, using the joint distribution of benefit and risk, confidence regions for the differences in risk and benefit can be constructed in the benefit-risk plane. The information in the joint distribution can be summarized by choosing regions {{of interest in this}} plane. Using Bayesian methodology provides a very flexible framework for summarizing information in the joint distribution. Results Data from a National Institute of Child Health & Human Development trial of hydrocortisone illustrate the construction of confidence regions and regions of interest in the benefit-risk plane, where benefit is survival without supplemental oxygen at 36 weeks postmenstrual age, and risk is gastrointestinal perforation. For the subgroup of infants exposed to chorioamnionitis the confidence interval based on the benefit-risk ratio is wide (Benefit-risk ratio: 1. 52; 90 % confidence interval: 0. 23 to 5. 25). Choosing regions of appreciable risk and acceptable risk in the benefit-risk plane confirms the uncertainty seen in the wide confidence interval for the benefit-risk ratio – there is a greater than 50 % chance of falling into the region of acceptable risk – while visually allowing the uncertainty in risk and benefit <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>shown</b> <b>separately.</b> Applying Bayesian methodology, an incremental net health benefit analysis shows there is a 72 % chance of having a positive incremental net benefit if hydrocortisone is used in place of placebo if one is willing to incur at most one gastrointestinal perforation for each additional infant that survives without supplemental oxygen. Conclusion If the benefit-risk ratio is presented, the joint distribution of benefit and risk also should be shown. These regions avoid the ambiguity associated with collapsing benefit and risk to a single dimension. Bayesian methods allow even greater flexibility in simultaneously quantifying benefit and risk. </p...|$|E

40|$|The Household Satellite Account aims to make visible the {{non-market}} production of households, {{which is only}} partially covered in the National Accounts. All economic analyses depend on systematic data compiled in a given, structured format. However, no such data have been available for household production, so far. The purpose of the satellite account <b>is</b> <b>to</b> fill this gap. The Household Satellite Account measures and describes {{the value of the}} goods and services produced by households for their own final consumption. The main part of household production is outside the scope of GDP. Satellite Account is conceptually consistent with the core national accounts, and it enables to produce extended national accounts that include both core accounts and household production. Such extended national accounts give a somewhat different picture of economic development than the core national accounts. They are of particular interest in the analysis of long-term economic development or in the comparison of levels of production in different economies. The Finnish Household Satellite Account has been compiled in compliance with Eurostat and SNA 93 guidelines. Some effort has also <b>been</b> made <b>to</b> further develop the Eurostat method. Accounts have been compiled for ten different types of households and for different principal functions of household production, i. e. providing housing, meals and snacks, clothing, care, and volunteer work. Also shopping and travel related <b>to</b> unpaid work <b>are</b> <b>shown</b> <b>separately.</b> The Finnish Household Satellite Account describes household production in 2001. Production not included in the national accounts is valued by using the input method. The data sources used in compiling the account were Statistics Finland's Time Use Survey in 1999 - 2000, the 2001 - 2002 Household Budget Survey, wage and salary statistics as well as National Accounts figures for 2001. The total output value of household production in 2001 was 81. 6 billion euros. Gross value added in household production was 62. 8 billion euros, of which 13 per cent was included in the national accounts. The GDP is increased by 40 per cent and household consumption by almost 60 per cent when production excluded from the national accounts are included in the figures. Among the various principal functions of household production, the highest gross value added figure was recorded for housing. Its share was 43 per cent of all household production. Meals and snacks accounted 27 per cent of household production. The volume of output varied in different types of households. Output was highest in families with small children and lowest in young single-person households. Output increased markedly with the age of the household's reference person, both among people living alone and couples. Household structure and the age of household members had a greater impact on output than gross household income. Extended national accounts time series will provide a valuable tool for monitoring changes in economic development. In the future the aim <b>is</b> <b>to</b> compile household satellite accounts on a regular basis at a five-year interval or more often using data from the national accounts, the Household Budget Survey and the Time Use Survey...|$|R
