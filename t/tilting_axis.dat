[...] A schematic of a MEMS-based WSS is shown in Figure 2 (to be uploaded). The incoming light is broken into a spectrum by a diffraction grating (shown at RHS of Figure) and each wavelength channel then focuses on a separate MEMS mirror. By tilting the mirror in one dimension, the channel can be directed back {{into any of the}} fibers in the array. A second <b>tilting</b> <b>axis</b> allows transient crosstalk to be minimised, otherwise switching (eg) from port 1 to port 3 will always involve passing the beam across port 2. The second axis provides a means to attenuate the signal without increasing the coupling into neighbouring fibers. This technology has the advantage of a single steering surface, not necessarily requiring polarization diversity optics. It works well {{in the presence of a}} continuous signal, allowing the mirror tracking circuits to dither the mirror and maximise coupling.|$|E

This is not accomplished by the thin foils prepared by the conventional method of specimen preparation, and only cylindrical or conical-shaped specimens with the symmetry axis parallel to the <b>tilting</b> <b>axis</b> would meet this requirement.

30|$|The {{first step}} is to ensure that the <b>tilt</b> <b>axis</b> is along the Z-plane of the volume. Since Trainable Weka Segmentation {{processes}} each slice individually, the classification will be more accurate if the software can “see” artefacts (e.g. missing wedge streaking) and meaningful data in the same image so that it can identify differences between the two. It will likewise be easier for the human operator to identify regions if both artefacts and when data are visible in the same plane. The software supplied with FEI microscopes, Inspect 3 D, produces reconstructions with the <b>tilt</b> <b>axis</b> in the X-Y plane, so they need to be rotated before further use. Unless dual-tilt axis tomography or a sophisticated reconstruction algorithm which incorporates prior knowledge of the sample is used, the reconstruction procedure also operates on a “slice-by-slice” basis, where no image “slice” along the <b>tilt</b> <b>axis</b> incorporates information from any other “slices”. Because of this, no information is lost when processing the final reconstruction in the same manner.|$|R

Previous methods for auto-calibration of cameras based on pure rotations fail to work in these two degenerate cases.

For (2) it is shown that the anisotropic corrections to superexchange are different from what has previously been assumed. For the correct spin Hamiltonian a classical Néel state in which the Cu spins are lying in the plane is unstable in a single Cu-O layer, but when a bilayer is considered there is a critical value of the interlayer exchange coupling which stabilizes this state.

The good junction quality and low microwave losses in sapphire gave high frequency response well into the THz region. High quality YBa 2 Cu 3 O 7 -x epitaxial films were deposited on tilted (vicinal) sapphire substrates with CeO 2 buffer layers by pulsed laser deposition. YBaCuO films have smaller tilt angles, from 1. 0 o up to 10. 3 o, compared to inclination angles of the substrates from 1. 5 o to 13. 6 o. X-ray diffraction shows only a single orientation of the films in the a-b plane, {{as well as an}} absence of a-axis particles and outgrowths. Critical temperatures as high as Tc= 88. 5  89. 0 K and &# 61508;Tc&# 61603; 1. 5 K were obtained in all films. The grain boundary in a common high-Tc superconducting junction is usually much less straight than in the bi-crystal substrate. The meandering of the artificial grain boundary in a tilted bi-crystal film is three times less than in an in-plane (un-tilted) bi-crystal.

Suppressing the critical current with a magnetic field can separate Josephson radiation and thermal radiation.

40|$|Distributed Wireless Smart Camera (DWSC) {{network is}} a special type of Wireless Sensor Network (WSN) that {{processes}} captured images in a distributed manner. While image processing on DWSCs sees a great potential for growth, with its applications possessing a vast practical application domain such as security surveillance and health care, it suffers from tremendous constraints. In addition to the limitations of conventional WSNs, image processing on DWSCs requires more computational power, bandwidth and energy that presents significant challenges for large scale deployments. This dissertation has developed a number of algorithms that are highly scalable, portable, energy efficient and performance efficient, with considerations of practical constraints imposed by the hardware {{and the nature of}} WSN. More specifically, these algorithms tackle the problems of multi-object tracking and localisation in distributed wireless smart camera net- works and optimal camera configuration determination. Addressing the first problem of multi-object tracking and localisation requires solving a large array of sub-problems. The sub-problems that are discussed in this dissertation are calibration of internal parameters, multi-camera calibration for localisation and object handover for tracking. These topics have been covered extensively in computer vision literatures, however new algorithms must be invented to accommodate the various constraints introduced and required by the DWSC platform. A technique has been developed for the automatic calibration of low-cost cameras which are assumed to be restricted in their freedom of movement to either pan or tilt movements. Camera internal parameters, including focal length, principal point, lens distortion parameter and the angle and axis of rotation, can be recovered from a minimum set of two images of the camera, provided that the axis of rotation between the two images goes through the camera's optical centre and is parallel to either the vertical (panning) or horizontal (<b>tilting)</b> <b>axis</b> of the image. For object localisation, a novel approach has been developed for the calibration of a network of non-overlapping DWSCs in terms of their ground plane homographies, which can then be used for localising objects. In the proposed approach, a robot travels through the camera network while updating its position in a global coordinate frame, which it broadcasts to the cameras. The cameras use this, along with the image plane location of the robot, to compute a mapping from their image planes to the global coordinate frame. This is combined with an occupancy map generated by the robot during the mapping process to localised objects moving within the network. In addition, {{to deal with the problem}} of object handover between DWSCs of non-overlapping fields of view, a highly-scalable, distributed protocol has been designed. Cameras that follow the proposed protocol transmit object descriptions to a selected set of neighbours that are determined using a predictive forwarding strategy. The received descriptions are then matched at the subsequent camera on the object's path using a probability maximisation process with locally generated descriptions. The second problem of camera placement emerges naturally when these pervasive devices are put into real use. The locations, orientations, lens types etc. of the cameras must be chosen in a way that the utility of the network is maximised (e. g. maximum coverage) while user requirements are met. To deal with this, a statistical formulation of the problem of determining optimal camera configurations has been introduced and a Trans-Dimensional Simulated Annealing (TDSA) algorithm has been proposed to effectively solve the problem...|$|E

40|$|An {{automatic}} {{procedure for}} electron tomography is presented. This procedure is adapted for specimens {{that can be}} fashioned into a needle-shaped sample and has been evaluated on inorganic samples. It consists of self-adapting denoising, automatic and accurate alignment including detection and correction of <b>tilt</b> <b>axis,</b> and 3 D reconstruction. We propose the exploitation of {{a large amount of}} information of an electron tomography acquisition to achieve robust and automatic mixed Poisson–Gaussian noise parameter estimation and denoising using undecimated wavelet transforms. The alignment is made by mixing three techniques, namely (i) cross-correlations between neighboring projections, (ii) common line algorithm to get a precise shift correction {{in the direction of the}} <b>tilt</b> <b>axis</b> and (iii) intermediate reconstructions to precisely determine the <b>tilt</b> <b>axis</b> and shift correction in the direction perpendicular to that axis. Mixing alignment techniques turns out to be very efficient and fast. Significant improvements are highlighted in both simulations and real data reconstructions of porous silicon in high angle annular dark field mode and agglomerated silver nanoparticles in incoherent bright field mode. 3 D reconstructions obtained with minimal user-intervention present fewer artefacts and less noise, which permits easier and more reliable segmentation and quantitative analysis. After careful sample preparation and data acquisition, the denoising procedure, alignment and reconstruction can be achieved within an hour for a 3 D volume of about a hundred million voxels, which is a step toward a more routine use of electron tomograph...|$|R

A crack perpendicular to the boundary plane was introduced between the two boundaries. The grain boundaries were equilibrated using molecular statics simulation and the entire configuration was deformed at constant strain rate using isobaric-isothermal (NPT) ensemble at 0 K. The stress strain behaviour of the configurations, variation of dislocation line density with strain and the screening effect of the grain boundaries were studied. The strain field around the crack tip and the dislocations emitted from it interact with the grain boundaries. The configuration with E 3 grain boundaries showed higher tensile strength while that with Ell showed lower tensile strength. This was attributed to {{the orientation of the}} dislocations in the { 1 (1) over bar 0 } boundary plane with 180 degrees tilt angle and the complete coherency with {(1) over bar(1) over bar 2 } boundary plane with 70. 53 degrees tilt angle.
