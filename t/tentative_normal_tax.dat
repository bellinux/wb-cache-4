40|$|Over 32 years ago, I {{published}} an article on accelerated depreciation in which I concluded that some amount of acceleration was consistent with <b>normal</b> <b>tax</b> principles {{and should not be}} classified as a tax expenditure. Over the intervening years, from time to time, I have exchanged comments with authors who have questioned that conclusion. It is time to revisit that topic and renew the consideration of how tax depreciation may properly operate. This Essay’s analysis of depreciation provides one example of how the tax expenditure budgets are flawed. The treatment of some accelerated depreciation as a tax expenditure is based on a view that any acceleration conflicts with <b>normal</b> <b>tax</b> principles. I will show in this Essay that when the structure of depreciation is examined, it becomes clear that {{there is more than one}} way to determine what allowance for depreciation should be made. Furthermore, allowing acceleration does not contravene any established tax principles. It is not the thesis of this Essay that acceleration is the only proper method of tax depreciation. To the contrary, it is my view that many forms of depreciation are proper and comply with <b>normal</b> <b>tax</b> principles, and that accelerated depreciation is merely one of the appropriate methods that can be authorized...|$|R

40|$|MCom (South African and International Tax), North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2015 Infrastructure {{is one of}} the top {{priorities}} of the South African Government. Substantial amounts will be invested by the Government in infrastructure between 2014 and 2016 as good infrastructure plays a pivotal role in the growth of the South African economy. Government does not have sufficient resources to meet its infrastructure goals and is therefore dependent on the private construction sector to provide assistance. Discrepancies were noted between the judgment laid down in CSARS v South African Custodial Services (Pty) Ltd (SACS) and the interpretations from the relevant sections contained within the Income Tax Act governing the <b>normal</b> <b>tax</b> treatment of construction contractors. The aim of this study was to determine whether reliance could be placed on the judgement laid down in CSARS v South African Custodial Services (Pty) Ltd in order to determine the nature and deductibility of expenditure incurred by construction contractors in future. It is crucial that tax legislation should be correctly interpreted and applied in determining the taxable income of taxpayers as it is evident that tax consequences influence the behaviour of South African taxpayers. A literature study of prior case law, sections of the Income Tax Act governing the <b>normal</b> <b>tax</b> treatment of construction contractors as well as other relevant literature was performed in order to determine the correct application of sections governing the <b>normal</b> <b>tax</b> position of construction contractors. The negative tax consequences suffered by SACS as a main contractor due to judgement laid down in CSARS v South African Custodial Services (Pty) Ltd could influence the willingness of the private construction sector to provide assistance to Government in future. Based on the literature study performed it was found that the court's application of Section 22 (2 A) of the Income Tax Act was correct. It was further found that the Court erroneously applied Section 11 (a), and as a result incorrectly determined the <b>normal</b> <b>tax</b> position of SACS. In response to this it is recommended that no reliance should be placed on the judgement laid down in CSARS v South African Custodial Services (Pty) Ltd in respect of determining the nature and deductibility of fees paid to subcontractors by construction contractors, as this could result in negative tax planning consequences.

40|$|An {{evaluation}} of published values for 'normal' concentrations of vanadium levels in human blood, serum and urine have been determined {{in order to}} identify the reasons for existing large variations of these values. the published data were scrutinized according to criteria on sampling and analysis developed for the TRACY (EUREKA, ENVIRON) project which aims at establishing reference values for persons without occupational exposure to metals. Of the sampling factors, living in environmentally polluted areas, contamination-free sampling and sample handling were found to be highly important. Although no reference values for vanadium are established, it appears that values, around 1 nmol 1 - 1 for blood and serum and around 10 nmol 1 - 1 or slightly lower for urine may be considered <b>tentative</b> <b>normal</b> values.

40|$|In {{the context}} of rapid globalisation, skilled South African {{employees}} and professionals are often attracted overseas to take up new work opportunities in foreign countries. This may cause these individuals no longer to be “ordinarily resident” in South Africa. At the same time, changes in modes of travel, information and communication channels could result in companies and trusts no longer being considered to be tax resident in South Africa, if the place of effective management for these entities is moved to a foreign country and a double taxation agreement between South Africa and that foreign country deems these entities to be exclusively resident in the foreign country. The objective of this thesis was to analyse the tax implications that could arise when a resident natural person, trust or company ceases to be a resident or when a Controlled Foreign Company (CFC) ceases to be a CFC. A {{detailed analysis of the}} “exit charge” in section 9 H of the Income Tax Act was undertaken to understand its <b>normal</b> <b>tax</b> implications when a natural person, trust or company ceases to be a resident or a CFC ceases to be a CFC. This included an analysis of how a natural person, trust or company ceases to be resident or how a CFC ceases to be a CFC. It was found that certain <b>normal</b> <b>tax</b> principles consistently apply to when a natural person, trust or company ceases to be resident or a CFC ceases to be a CFC. At the same time, certain unique <b>normal</b> <b>tax</b> implications arise for trusts and CFCs since they are impacted by the special tax rules that apply to these entities. Furthermore {{in the case of a}} trust, a judicial precedent has established that the “exit charge” remains and is taxable in the trust. For CFCs, there is uncertainty as to whether the “exit charge” could arise when a shareholder ceases to be resident, which results in residents no longer holding more than 50 % of the total participation or voting rights in that foreign company...|$|R
