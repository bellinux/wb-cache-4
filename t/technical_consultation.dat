The study involved a mixed-method (multivariate predictive and multiple case comparison) evaluation of six organizationally similar but spatially different URCs. Data analysis revealed relationships between workspace planning, consultations and innovation process outcomes. Multivariate analyses showed that configurational accessibility, visibility and walking distances significantly affect the frequencies and locations of unprogrammed face-to-face consultations. Cross-case comparisons revealed that URCs featuring overall high configurational accessibility, shorter walking distances and intact territories exhibit higher face-to-face consultation rates, consultation network connectivity, and subjective/objective innovation process outcomes. Implications for research policy, practice and research are discussed. ...|$|R

40|$|Many industrialised economies {{have seen}} a {{relative}} {{increase in the number}} of small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) compared with large companies since the 1980 s.

The paper outlines the background and overall activities of the PTR centers, and then focuses on how PTR centers have assisted SMEs in the vicinity of Japan's five large car makers. It is found that in 1986 the PTR center near Toyota's main assembly facilities performed the largest number of test inspections.
