40|$|This {{present study}} {{examined}} the session-by-session content of group therapy for eating-disordered clients. The main objective {{of this study was}} to identify how therapist-client gender match affects group therapy process, regarding the disclosure of important issues relevant to eating-disordered clients. It was hypothesized that the group therapy process for eating-disordered clients would be qualitatively different if therapy was facilitated by a female as opposed to a male therapist. The evaluation of the research question required using an alternating treatments single-subject research design, in which the presentation of treatment conditions was counterbalanced across two therapy groups. The treatments consisted of three therapist conditions (i. e., male therapist only, female therapist-only, or both therapists) that were systematically presented during the study. All group-therapy sessions were videotaped and coded for verbal content. The results suggested that when a female therapist alone was leading group therapy sessions, eating-disordered clients were more inclined to discuss general emotional issues and specific issues involving negative affect. Furthermore, during the male therapist-only conditions, there was a tendency for female group members to <b>talk</b> <b>more</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> physical symptoms of eating disorders (i. e., food-related behaviors, body image issues).

40|$|Objective: This study {{examined}} whether {{the experience of}} creating and sharing memories of their babies is associated with mothers’ mental health after stillbirth, taking account of factors previously shown to be important. Background: Mothers of stillborn babies are usually offered the opportunity {{to spend time with}} and create memories of their babies. However, evidence on whether this leads to better mental health outcomes is equivocal. One possible explanation is that the impact of making memories is mediated by the extent to which women subsequently share these memories. Methods: Cross-sectional questionnaire study. Mothers (N = 162) of stillborn babies completed online questionnaires of how memories were made and shared, satisfaction with memory-making and sharing, professional and social support, and symptoms of depression, anxiety and PTSD. Results: The majority of mothers made and shared memories. The number of different memory-making activities was not associated with mental health outcomes. However, the degree to which mothers shared their memories was associated with fewer PTSD symptoms. Regression analyses showed that good mental health was most strongly associated with time since stillbirth, perceived professional support, sharing of memories and less wish to <b>talk</b> <b>more</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> baby. Conclusion: This study confirms research showing that time since stillbirth and perceived professional support is associated with better mental health following stillbirth {{and for the first time}} shows the importance of opportunities to share memories of the baby. Variation in sharing opportunities may contribute to inconsistencies in the association between making memories and mental health following stillbirth...|$|E
40|$|Background: {{studies of}} IV {{magnesium}} sulphate {{as a treatment}} for acute asthma have had mixed results with some data suggesting a benefit for acute severe asthma, but not for mild to moderate asthma. Design: single-blind controlled clinical trial. Setting: Emergency Departments (ED) of two hospitals (ElShaab and Omdurman Teaching Hospitals). Patients: patients aged 18 to 60 years presenting with acute severe asthma and PEFR < 50 % predicted on arrival to the ED. Intervention: All patients received nebulized salbutamol at regular intervals, and IV hydrocortisone. Two grams of IV magnesium sulphate were randomly administered to 25 patients (out of 50) using computer randomization program or nothing 30 minute after ED arrival. The primary efficacy end point was PEFR at 240 minute. Results: Fifty patients were included and mean PEFR at ED arrival was 33. 7 % predicted. At 240 min, patients receiving magnesium had a mean PEFR of 65. 1 % predicted compared to V 48. 2 % predicted in those who did not received magnesium (CI 7. 97 and 25. 89) with P. < 0. 005. In conclusion this study indicated that when 2 g MgSO 4 is given as an adjunct to standardized asthma therapy to patients presented with severe acute asthma, there is significant improvement in clinical scenario and pulmonary function. Thus these would support routine use of MGSO 4 in patients with severe acute asthma. So the study recommended for further larger multicenter studies, should support or <b>talk</b> <b>more</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> effect of MgSO 4 on moderate to severe Sudanese asthmatic patients...|$|E

This {{is not only a}} problem of scarce resources for new investments but the public sector is also struggling with maintaining assets and services at current levels. Therefore, public managers try to look at alternative solutions which may provide answers to present problems. Public-Private Partnerships seem to offer a good solution to budget deficits and inefficient operations. The framework introduces private sector resources and/or expertise as a partner in order to help, provide, and deliver public sector assets and services. It bonds private and public sector for the period of 20 - 30 years. Some say it is an excellent idea as it enables investments which otherwise would be never procured and it does not strain the budget. Others oppose it and say someday the bill will have to be paid off, and it {{will turn out to be}} much more expensive than a traditional procurement. Moreover, they say, it is a waste of taxpayers’ money as PPPs don’t bring efficiencies and are done in favor of private partner.

But, the reality of their design does not really express any new voice. Typical floor -plan is multiplied in vertical, served three or four units, connected by weird mirror-surrounded elevators and emergency stairs. Small and narrow corridors cannot really offer any proper space for social interaction. Let's <b>talk</b> <b>more</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> inside of an apartment housing complex. First of all, {{even though there is}} trash in front of the apartment building, nobody picks it up until the cleaning woman does something. This is the irony of high-rise apartment housing. No one wants to behave as if they own the place. After parking their cars in the lot, people try to go to their private space as soon as possible, before they meet someone. That's why the elevator hallway or inside of the elevator is the most uncomfortable space in the apartment building. There is no longer any kind of classic alley as in old villages which was a buffer area between public and private space. Without a buffer, combination of public and private space, there are just two extremely different areas, public and private spaces in apartment complexes. The thesis proposes a high-rise residential building by means of rethinking circulation and infrastructure. This new type of a high-rise residential building enables residents to have a buffer zone between public and private space with a specific elements such as a elevator, a stair, or more than that. This buffer zone in high-rise building helps to activate a semi-public space as a real neighbor. by Bumjin Kim. Thesis: M.

40|$|Presented here in {{this thesis}} is the project work {{performed}} for the Master of Science degree in Space Engineering from Luleå University of technology, Sweden. This project work was conducted at the Arecibo Observatory in Arecibo, Puerto Rico, where I, during 6 months, designed and built a Potassium (K) -vapor Faraday filter to make daytime lidar observations of the mesopause region (80 - 105 km altitude) in the atmosphere a reality. The K Doppler-resonance lidar at the Arecibo Observatory is used to probe the temperature structure of the mesopause region. The climatology of this region is of vital importance {{in the understanding of}} earth’s climate system. The effects of global change are expected to be reflected strongly in the mesopause region, where tropospheric global warming will cause substantial cooling. This thesis will <b>talk</b> <b>more</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> background for making lidar observations of the mesopause region and the need for extending this observation to, not just nighttime, but also to daytime by making a filter that blocks broadband background skylight and only lets the ultra-narrow band signal pass. The thesis will present and explain the physical effects applied in the filter, such as anomalous dispersion and absorption at resonance frequency, the Zeeman effect and Faraday rotation. The filter characteristics will be given and the function of the filter will be explained. A computer program to determine the filter parameters (magnetic field strength, operating temperature and K-vapor cell length) is explained briefly and attached as an appendix, and the design and integration of the filter will be shown. The design and construction is based on a magnetic field strength of 1. 3 kG, a temperature of 114 degrees C and a K-vapor cell length of 40 mm, which will give a full width half maximum (FWHM) of 5 pm for the filter. This is wide enough for a 99 % transmission (for already polarized incident light and without reflection in the optical surfaces in the filter) of the three frequencies used in the observations.

40|$|This thesis {{introduces}} {{a new perspective}} on development in Lebanon, that of lay people in rural communities. Lay views have been missing from development literature and practice around the world. Development projects which emphasise economic development and infrastructure are often described by development professionals in terms of their achievements and tangible benefits. However, concerned researchers are dissatisfied with the outcomes of many development projects and their effects on people and their environments. The perspectives of the recipients of development projects is the topic of this research. In Lebanon, funds for development projects during and after the recent war (1975 - 90) have stressed economic development and infrastructure. The governmental and non-governmental agencies carrying out these programs are driven by donor accountability and the need to apply for further funding. As a result, they have tended to overlook longer term social needs. A significant omission in official development reports are the views of project beneficiaries. It is this omission that this thesis seeks to remedy. The study provides an ethnographic account of people 2 ̆ 7 s viewpoints on development in two typical rural villages in Lebanon. They are situated in Akkar which has received much development assistance over the past two decades. The ethnographic approach, similar to that used in anthropology, was used for its ability to uncover in-depth information using multi-methods of data collection. The thesis presents {{a detailed description of the}} layout and social organisation of the two villages. In many respects, these do not differ significantly from descriptions in the earlier literature which dates from the 19 th century, although outside contacts, for employment, education and political activity are now more frequent. Villagers were asked about their views of development, what they valued about their village and their experience of development projects. Their views were found to reflect their gender and position in the village hierarchy. The male leaders, who see themselves as initiators of development projects and use them to further their political ambitions, hold similar views to development professionals and use the same vocabulary. Other, less powerful men and the women hold different views, use different vocabulary and tend to <b>talk</b> <b>more</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> Hi-effects of projects. The religious leaders espouse an Islamic viewpoint which is similar in some ways to that of the women but their activities mirror those of the other male leaders. No development project which has been undertaken in either village could be considered to have been successful. A detailed investigation of a water project in one of the villages shows why this is so. Lack of success has to do with factors internal to the village, as well as the project approach favoured by development agencies. The findings indicate that there are gaps in development practice at both a state and development agency levels. Complex village social relationships, particularly internal and external power relationships, affect development projects and outcomes. These favour involvement of key male figures in development initiatives rather than all the community. Such issues point to the need for training in gender awareness and participatory approaches for the professionals as well as the need for equitable resource distribution at a countiy level. Although the research was liniited to two villages in Akkar, the implications for practice and further research are nationwide...|$|E
40|$|Moving Into The Teen Years (MITTY) {{is one of}} six {{relationship}} and sexuality education programs delivered by Interrelate Family Centres. It involves a series of four 90 -minute class-based sessions (with a take-home workbook to encourage parental engagement). It is designed to enhance Year 6 students’ self-esteem, communication and decision-making skills, to provide in-depth information about boys’ and girls’ bodies, the changes they can expect during puberty, reproduction and sexuality education. The MITTY program involves a variety of creative activities and teaching methods, is facilitated by specially trained Educators and has a clearly articulated structure, content and objectives, which have been correlated against the NSW Board of Studies’PD/H/PE syllabus. This evaluation report is based on data collected from 56 MITTY groups using surveys developed by the authors, in collaboration with Interrelate team members. Both students and teachers reported high levels of satisfaction with the MITTY program. Most students rated the MITTY program as enjoyable particularly male and older students), interesting (particularly older students), good to have discussed in a group (particularly older students) and fun (particularly older students), although half also found it somewhat embarrassing (particularly female students). Very few students found it boring but one-third did find some bits hard to understand. Similarly, almost all teachers rated the MITTY program as enjoyable, interesting, engaging for their students, good value and good to have discussed in a group. One-third of teachers did find the program somewhat embarrassing but very few considered it too long or hard to understand. Teachers, in particular, were very appreciative of the Interrelate Educators’ delivery style and of having an external professional to introduce the topics covered in the MITTY program. Students’ and teachers’ written comments reinforced these positive satisfaction ratings, {{with only a few}} suggestions for improvement. Both students and teachers also reported having found the MITTY program a very useful learning experience. Students reported moderate-high levels of learning across all topic areas, particularly in relation to keeping themselves safe, making good choices, how their bodies would change during puberty and how babies develop. The mixed-gender approach appears valuable (although there were a few requests for single-gender groups), with boys reporting having learned more about girls’ bodies and vice versa. Similar levels of learning were reported across all student age-groups but female students reported learning more than males in relation to 2 ̆ 2 Making good choices 2 ̆ 2 ’, 2 ̆ 2 How babies are made 2 ̆ 2 and 2 ̆ 2 How to keep yourself safe 2 ̆ 2. Teachers reported a refreshed understanding of the topics covered, increased confidence, capacity and comfort to discuss the topics covered with their students and having learned more about their students, particularly in terms of the open and mature ways in which they engaged with the program. Again, students’ and teachers’ written comments reinforced their perceived learnings from the MITTY program. While most teachers expected to <b>talk</b> <b>more</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> topics with their classes, students felt most likely to discuss them furtherwith their family or friends (particularly the female students). Although based on a post-only survey (for pragmatic reasons), the consistency of and concordance between participants’ ratings and written comments enhance our confidence in the validity of the findings presented in this report. This confidence is further strengthened by the very high response rates achieved from both students and teachers and the similar findings from our evaluations of Interrelate’s Minding Me and Where Did I Come From? / Preparing for Puberty programs (Newell et al., 2011 a; Newell et al., 2011 b). Therefore, Interrelate can confidently promote the existing MITTY program as an acceptable, curriculum-relevant and effective way of introducing senior primary students to the topics covered (ie: self-esteem, communication and decision-making skills, boys’ and girls’ bodies, puberty, reproduction and sexuality). However, Interrelate might like to consider whether the MITTY program could usefully be further refined, based on the very few concerns or suggestions raised by students and/or teachers (although some comments may conflict with some requirements of the NSW Board of Studies). With the current evaluation necessarily limited to the immediate post-program period, Interrelate could also consider conducting some additional follow up evaluations {{in order to determine the}} extent and nature of any longer-term impacts of the MITTY program. Hence, Interrelate is well-positioned to contribute to addressing the reported demand (from Australian parents and youth) for more comprehensive {{relationship and}} sexual health education, which is seen to include topics such as personal safety, sexual coercion, puberty, sexually-transmitted diseases, relationship decision-making, safe sex and contraception, reproduction and the correct names for male and female genitals (Carmody and Willis, 2006; Macbeth et al., 2009). The timing of Interrelate’s Minding Me (Year 5) and MITTY (Year 6) programs is another strength, given most Australian parents’ belief that this sexual education should start in primary school (Macbeth et al., 2009) and evidence that it has more impact when delivered before young people become sexually active (Mueller et al., 2008). The teacher involvement is also valuable, given parent- and teacher-perceived room for improvement in training teachers in the delivery of sexuality education (Macbeth et al., 2009; Milton, 2003) ...|$|E

Although some teachers found the program a little embarrassing, very few thought it was too long or hard to understand. Students’ and teachers’ written comments reinforced these positive satisfaction ratings, with only a few suggestions for improvement. Both students and teachers also reported having found the Minding Me program a very useful learning experience. Students reported moderate-high levels of learning across all topic areas, particularly in relation to keeping themselves safe, how their bodies would change during puberty and the feelings they may experience as they do so. Similar levels of learning were reported across all student age-groups but male students reported learning more about “Nocturnal emissions (wet dreams) ”, while female students reported having learnt more in relation to most other topics and being more likely to discuss the issues further. Teachers reported a refreshed understanding of the topics covered, increased confidence, capacity and comfort to discuss the topics covered with their students and having learned more about their students, particularly in terms of the open and mature ways in which they engaged with the program. Again, students’ and teachers’ written comments reinforced their perceived learnings from the Minding Me program. While most teachers expected to <b>talk</b> <b>more</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> topics with their classes, students felt most likely to discuss them further with their family or friends. Although based on a post-only survey (for pragmatic reasons), the consistency of and concordance between participants’ ratings and written comments enhance our confidence in the validity of the findings presented in this report. This confidence is further strengthened by the very high response rates achieved from both students and teachers and the similar findings from our evaluations of Interrelate’s MITTY and Where Did I Come From? / Preparing for Puberty programs (Newell et al., 2011 a; Newell et al., 2011 b). Therefore, Interrelate can confidently promote the existing Minding Me program as an acceptable, curriculum-relevant and effective way of introducing senior primary students to the topics covered (ie: the physical, emotional, social, intellectual and relationship changes they may experience during puberty, personal safety issues and constructive approaches to conflict resolution). However, Interrelate might like to consider whether the Minding Me program could usefully be further refined, based on the very few concerns or suggestions raised by students and/or teachers (although some comments may conflict with requirements of the NSW Board of Studies). While the greater learnings reported by female students may simply represent more widely-occurring gender differences, it may be another area Interrelate could consider in any review. With the current evaluation necessarily limited to the immediate post-program period, Interrelate could also consider conducting some additional follow up evaluations {{in order to determine the}} extent and nature of any longer-term impacts of the Minding Me program. Hence, Interrelate is well-positioned to contribute to addressing the reported demand (from Australian parents and youth) for more comprehensive {{relationship and}} sexual health education, which is seen to include topics such as relationship decision-making, personal safety, puberty and the correct names for male and female genitals (Carmody and Willis, 2006; Macbeth et al., 2009). The timing of Interrelate’s Minding Me (Year 5) and MITTY (Year 6) programs is another strength, given most Australian parents’ belief that this sexual education should start in primary school (Macbeth et al., 2009) and evidence that it has more impact when delivered before young people become sexually active (Mueller et al., 2008). The teacher involvement is also valuable, given parent- and teacher-perceived room for improvement in training teachers in the delivery of sexuality education (Macbeth et al., 2009; Milton, 2003) ...|$|E

30|$|Learners’ mere {{compliance}} with language at surface levels such as attending form was changed as they {{spent more time}} with the task. Through the entire task performances except for the beginning phase, learners used more discursive devices and conversation management techniques such as cohesive devices and clarification request to repair their negotiation. Moreover, learners’ procedural talk was reduced and they <b>talked</b> <b>more</b> <b>about</b> <b>the</b> content at later stages of task performance. At the beginning stages, learners had more intermental processing since they referred to the teacher or other assistance to communicate what they mean whereas at the later stages of task performance participants engaged in more intramental processing which means they did the things they couldn’t do without assistance at the beginning of task performance with more ease and confidence individually at later stages of task performances.|$|R
