2500|$|Commercial {{creosote}} {{will contain}} substances from six groups. The two groups {{occur in the}} greatest amounts and are {{the products of the}} distillation process—the [...] "tar acids", which distill below 205°C and consist mainly of phenols, cresols, and xylenols, including carbolic acid—and aromatic hydrocarbons, which divide into naphthalenes, which distill approximately between 205° and 255°C, and constituents of an anthracene nature, which distill above 255°C. The quantity of each varies based on the quality of tar and temperatures used, but generally, the <b>tar</b> <b>acids</b> won't exceed 5%, the naphthalenes will make up 15 to 50%, and the anthracenes will make up 45% to 70%.

40|$|The Grillo {{process is}} {{designed}} to produce sulphur dioxide from solid and liquid sulphur, spent sulphuric acids and other high-calorific-value waste materials of the chemical industry. The raw materials used are converted in a rotary kiln with a moving coke bed at approximately 1000 °C under a weak reducing atmosphere; the hydrocarbon compounds are cracked and sulphur is converted into SO 2. To supply additional energy, the rotary kiln is fitted with an oil burner. After passing through post-combustion chambers, the product gases from the decomposition process are cooled down in a waste heat recovery boiler and fed to an absorption-desorption reactor. In there, high-purity sulphur dioxide is obtained and stored in liquid form in pressure tanks for sale. In the Grillo process both, solid and liquid sulphur, can be used separately but also simultaneously. The use of sulphur and its combustion with air represents {{the state of the}} technology. The combustion of liquid sulphur with pure oxygen combined with the decomposition process, however, has only been practiced in the Grillo process so far. This study investigates the reactions taking place in the rotary kiln, in particular the vaporisation and combustion of liquid sulphur and the separation of spent acids using thermodynamic and reaction kinetic methods. The thermodynamic-based calculation of the chemical changes and energy conversions in the Grillo process (rotary kiln – post combustion chamber – waste heat recovery boiler) is used to assess the effects of the decomposition in the rotary kiln on the entire process. The field tests on the system using a variation of the type and quantity of substances represent an important basis for the process analysis. The temperatures and gas compositions were measured continuously at the outlet of the rotary kiln, in the post-combustion chamber as well as the waste heat recovery boiler. One of the priorities of the investigation, is the combustion of liquid sulphur with oxygen, an area which has barely been investigated up to now. During the vaporisation of liquid sulphur, gaseous sulphur molecules from S 8 to S 1 are created, which make up different amounts in the gaseous phase, depending on temperature and pressure. This influences, e. g., the sulphur combustion by the oxygen supply in the rotary kiln. In addition to an oxygen supply, sustaining the sulphur flame also requires a certain droplet spectrum. A further object of investigation is the separation of spent sulphuric acids, <b>tar</b> <b>acids</b> and high-heat-value waste materials in the rotary kiln. The spent acids also contain hydrocarbons and heavy metal compounds, which may be present in a solute form or as independent phases, which react differently in the rotary kiln, where special effects, such as microexplosion, may occur. The soot formation frequently occurring in the gasification of hydrocarbon compounds also takes place in the rotary kiln and thus feed the coke bed, which serves as both a heat reservoir and a carbon supply in the Grillo process. This study shall describe the kinetics of vaporisation and combustion of liquid droplets on simplistic conditions. First of all, the size of the liquid droplets that enter the hot gas compartment of the rotary kiln is calculated, considering the entry conditions. The time related sequence of the substance and heat transmission processes during the heating, vaporisation, separation and combustion of sulphuric and spent acid droplets is described on the basis of simple single droplet models. In this way the maximum diameters of the droplets which can be converted in the rotary kiln are determined. Following from calculations and actual measurements, large spent acid droplets are evidently fragmented {{as a result of the}} microexplosions and can thus fully react in the rotary kiln. One of the practical objectives of this study is the control and monitoring of the overall process, going beyond the empirical field tests. This objective is served by the thermodynamic-based process calculations carried out in combination with field tests in which the chemical changes and energy conversions in the individual reactors were recorded. The quantities and compositions of the reaction products formed in both the rotary kiln and the post-combustion chambers have also been determined. While doing so, it was possible to demonstrate that the delayed conversion of substances such as <b>tar</b> <b>acids</b> can impair the energy balance in the rotary kiln and thus the entire process. All in all, the calculations in comparison with measurements have considerably improved the basis for the practice-oriented analysis and optimisation of the process in the reactor coupling comprising rotary kiln, post-combustion chamber and waste heat recovery boiler...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Staphylococcus aureus or MRSA (Methicillin Resistant S. aureus), is an {{acquired}} pathogen {{and the primary}} cause of nosocomial infections worldwide. In S. aureus, teichoic acid is an essential component of the cell wall, and its biosynthesis is not yet well characterized. Studies in Bacillus subtilis have discovered two different pathways of teichoic acid biosynthesis, in two strains W 23 and 168 respectively, namely teichoic <b>acid</b> ribitol (<b>tar)</b> and teichoic <b>acid</b> glycerol (tag). The genes involved in these two pathways are also characterized, tarA, tarB, tarD, tarI, tarJ, tarK, tarL for the tar pathway, and tagA, tagB, tagD, tagE, tagF for the tag pathway. With the genome sequences of several MRSA strains: Mu 50, MW 2, N 315, MRSA 252, COL as well as methicillin susceptible strain MSSA 476 available, a comparative genomic analysis was performed to characterize teichoic acid biosynthesis in these S. aureus strains. Results We identified all S. aureus tar and tag gene orthologs in the selected S. aureus strains which would contribute to teichoic acids sythesis. Based on our identification of genes orthologous to tarI, tarJ, tarL, which are specific to tar pathway in B. subtilis W 23, we also concluded that tar is the major teichoic acid biogenesis pathway in S. aureus. Further analyses indicated that the S. aureus tar genes, different from the divergon organization in B. subtilis, are organized into several clusters in cis. Most interesting, compared with genes in B. subtilis tar pathway, the S. aureus tar specific genes (tarI,J,L) are duplicated in all six S. aureus genomes. Conclusion In the S. aureus strains we analyzed, <b>tar</b> (teichoic <b>acid</b> ribitol) is the main teichoic acid biogenesis pathway. The tar genes are organized into several genomic groups in cis and the genes specific to tar (relative to tag) : tarI, tarJ, tarL are duplicated.

Results: Histology confirmed that IPC induction by 5 min of retinal ischemia results in a complete protection against the neurodegenerative effects of a 60 min ischemic period applied 24 or 48 h later. The microarray analysis revealed differential expression of 104 known genes at one or more time points between 1 h and 7 days after IPC. The group of altered genes contained a significant overrepresentation of genes involved in aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase activity (Iars, Lars, Cars, Yars, Gars, <b>Tars),</b> amino <b>acid</b> transport (Slc 3 a 2, Slc 6 a 6, Slc 7 a 1, Slc 38 a 2), regulation of transcription (including Egr 1, Egr 4, Nr 4 a 1, Nr 4 a 3, c-fos), and cell death (including Anxa 1, Trib 3). qPCR assays on cDNA of individual animals confirmed the microarray results. Conclusions: Endogenous neuroprotection, provoked by ischemic preconditioning is associated with changes in transcript levels of several functionally-related groups of genes. During the time window of effective protection, transcrip...|$|R
40|$|AbstractTat stimulates HIV- 1 gene {{expression}} during transcription initiation and elongation. Tat functions primarily through specific interactions with TAR RNA and several putative cellular cofactors {{to increase the}} processivity of RNA polymerase II complexes during HIV- 1 transcription elongation. Although HIV- 1 transactivation by Tat in most cell types requires intact TAR sequences, previous reports demonstrate that Tat transactivates HIV- 1 long terminal repeat (LTR) -directed {{gene expression}} in several central nervous system-derived astrocytic/glial cell lines {{in the absence of}} TAR. Within this study, transient expression assays performed in the astrocytic/glial cell line, U 87 -MG, confirm that κB elements within the HIV- 1 LTR mediate TAR-independent transactivation by Tat and demonstrate additionally that distinct amino acid residues within the cysteine-rich activation domain of Tat are required for TAR-independent versus TAR-dependent transactivation. Established U 87 -MG cell lines expressing a transdominant negative mutant of IκBα, IκBαΔN, fail to support TAR-independent transactivation by Tat, suggesting that binding of NF-κB to κB enhancer elements within the HIV- 1 LTR is necessary for Tat-mediated transactivation in the absence of <b>TAR.</b> Ribonucleic <b>acid</b> protection analyses of promoter-proximal and -distal transcripts derived from TAR-deleted and TAR-containing HIV- 1 LTR reporter constructs in U 87 -MG cells indicate that the predominant effect of Tat during TAR-independent transactivation occurs at the level of transcription initiation, whereas a prominent elongation effect of Tat is observed in the presence of TAR. These data suggest an alternative regulatory pathway for Tat transactivation in specific cells derived from the central nervous system that is independent of TAR and that requires direct or indirect interaction of Tat with NF-κB-binding sites in the HIV- 1 LTR...|$|R

The company later expanded into the production of coal <b>tar,</b> and carbolic <b>acid</b> (phenol). The site soon became the world's leading producer of phenol. In 1919 the US chemical company Monsanto entered into a partnership with Graesser's chemical works to produce vanillin, salicylic acid, aspirin, and later rubber processing chemicals. The site was later operated by Flexsys, a subsidiary of Solutia, but production ceased in 2010.With {{the closure of the}} nearby Air Products site at Acrefair, manufacturing in the village has almost disappeared. The village still has a supermarket, which has changed hands from Kwik Save to Somerfield to the Co-Op. A large Tesco store was opened in March 2012 on the former site of the village football team, Cefn Druids. After buying this land, Tesco agreed to contribute to the construction of the new football ground located half a mile (1 km) away near the neighbouring village of Rhosymedre.|$|R

Therefore, some treatments were required. Distillation residue of 2 nd generation bioethanol based palm oil empty fruit bunch was hydrothermal liquefied to increase its added value. Process hydrothermal liquefaction was carried out under variation of temperature and reaction time, in an autoclave under inert atmosphere. The product consisted of tar dissolved in water, char and gas. The solid conversion, the tar yields and chemical compounds yields increased by the increasing the reaction temperature. The reaction time did not give significant effect to the conversion and the tar yields (wt %). However, reaction time gave a significant effect to typical chemical compounds in the tar. The typical chemical compounds identified in the <b>tar</b> were acetic <b>acid,</b> phenol, phenol,- 2 -methoxy and 2 -pyrrolidinone.

40|$|Effective syngas cleanup {{is one of}} the {{remaining}} major technical challenges yet to be resolved and one that will provide the most benefit to the suite of bio-thermochemical process technologies. Beyond <b>tars</b> and <b>acid</b> gases, which are themselves a significant detriment to reforming catalysts and associated equipment, semi-volatile metals can also damage cleanup systems, catalysts, and contaminate the fungible products. Metals are a difficult challenge to deal with whether using hot-gas filtration or low-temperature processing. Even though most of the metal tends to condense before the barrier filter of hot-gas cleanup systems, some small percentage of the metal (large enough to damage syngas-reforming catalysts, the candle filters themselves, and gas turbine blades) does pass through these barrier filters along with the clean syngas. Low-temperature processing requires expensive measures to remove metals from the process stream. Significant costs are required to remove these metals and if they are not removed before contacting the catalyst, they will significantly reduce the life of the catalyst. One approach to solving the metals problem is to use high-temperature sorbents to capture all of the semi-volatile metals upstream of the barrier filter, which would prevent even small amounts of metal from passing through the filter with the clean syngas. High Temperature sorbents have already been developed that {{have been shown to be}} effective at capturing semi-volatile metals from vitiated combustion effluent, i. e., high-temperature flue gas. The objective on this project was to evaluate these same sorbents for their ability to scavenge metals from inert, reducing, and real syngas environments. Subsequently, it was the objective of this project to develop designer sorbents and an injection technology that would optimize the effectiveness of these sorbents at capturing metals from syngas, protecting the barrier filters from damage, and protecting the catalysts and other downstream equipment from damage. Finally, the high-temperature sorbent technology would be expanded to look at the role that these sorbents play in relation to <b>tars</b> and <b>acid</b> gases, which are the other significant pollutants within syngas. In addition to the technology development work described above, all of the information obtained in this work was to be incorporated into a syngas speciation model, which would allow direct prediction of transformations that occur in syngas as it passes from the gasifier and the sorbent-injection section and through the barrier filters. Unfortunately, Congressional budget cuts prevented most of this work from being accomplished. Hopefully, additional funds will be provided to this work in the future, which will allow its completion. However, at the halting point of this project, the following has been accomplished. A major initial objective of the project was accomplished, which was to determine whether or not high-temperature sorbents found to work within vitiated air might also work in an inert environment. Kaolinite, one of the sorbents previously investigated as a high-temperature sorbent for incinerators, was found to effectively capture potassium. In addition, while previous work on short-time (i. e., 1 to 2 seconds) dispersed-phase reactions found that sorbent utilization was limited to two metal oxide species captured for every one aluminosilicate crystal structure, the present investigation found that many times higher insoluble metal/sorbent capture ratios were obtained. This result not only suggests that small additions of sorbent might be highly effective, but the fact that the products were insoluble (in part due to the temperature of sorbent injection, i. e., < 1500 F) may be an indication that the products are unlikely to react with, corrode, or otherwise damage the candle-filter elements. There has been little work on the capture of potassium metal vapor by high-temperature sorbents, prior to this work. The fact that potassium can be effectively captured by kaolinite clay powder is a significant finding of this work, which applies both to combustion and gasification. The effect of different temperatures and pressures on the effectiveness of sorbent at capturing metal and protecting the filters needs to be evaluated. The impact of tars on sorbents and sorbents on tars also needs to be considered, and {{is one of the}} major questions about this technology. There is much left to be done in this area, which if performed will greatly benefit the advancement of this technology and the world through its application...|$|R
40|$|AbstractIntroductionGrowing {{evidence}} suggests that oxidative stress (OS) {{may be associated with}} the pathophysiology underlying schizophrenia (SZ). Some studies indicate that nutritional supplements offer protection from OS, but there is no data about the effect of a hypocaloric diet on OS in this population. Therefore, we aimed to study the effect of a hypocaloric dietary intervention on OS in subjects with SZ. MethodsA cross-sectional study of 96 participants in outpatient treatment for SZ comprised patients separated into two groups: one group of subjects followed a hypocaloric diet (HD) program (n= 42), while the other group followed a regular diet (RD) with no nutritional restrictions (n= 54). The serum total radical-trapping antioxidant parameter (TRAP), total antioxidant reactivity (<b>TAR)</b> and thiobarbituric <b>acid</b> reactive species (TBARS) levels were assessed. ResultsTRAP levels were lower and TBARS levels were higher in the HD group than in the RD group (p= 0. 022 and p= 0. 023, respectively). There were no differences in TAR levels between the groups. Additionally, there was a positive correlation between TRAP and TBARS levels after adjusting for BMI and clozapine dose (partial correlation= 0. 42, p< 0. 001). There were no correlations among the length of illness or diet and the levels of TRAP, TBARS, and TAR. ConclusionsSubjects with SZ on a hypocaloric diet displayed different OS parameters than those not following a HD. Serum TRAP levels were lower and TBARS levels were higher among SZ subjects with HD compared to SZ subjects without HD. Lower TRAP levels may reflect decreased oxidative stress, whereas higher TBARS levels most likely reflect a biochemical reaction to the decreased TRAP levels. Additionally, TAR levels were similar between groups, suggesting a similar quality of antioxidant defenses, despite quantitative differences between the two dietary protocols in SZ patients under outpatient care...|$|R
40|$|Conversion of syngas to mixed (C 1 -C 5) {{and higher}} (C 2 +) {{alcohols}} over alkali-doped MoS 2 (ADM) catalysts, promoted with cobalt (Co) and rhodium (Rh), has exhibited {{great potential for}} commercial higher alcohols synthesis (HAS) reaction. Carbon-based supports with attractive physico-chemical and mechanical properties have immense potential to be explored for the HAS catalyst development. Due to their characteristic properties such as high surface area, thermal stability, and chemical inertness, this Ph. D study sought to explore three main carbon-based supports namely; multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs), ordered mesoporous carbon (OMC) and carbon nanohorns (CNHs) for HAS catalyst formulation. The overall research objective was to explore options to develop novel carbon-supported ADM catalyst systems to effectively convert syngas to higher alcohols. The {{novelty of the work}} is in two folds: 1) to investigate the influence of binders incorporation, pelletization, and particle size on the HAS reactions using carbon (MWCNT, OMC and CNH) -supported KCoRhMoS 2 catalyst systems; and 2) to explore OMCs and CNHs as new support systems for the HAS reactions. The influence of binders (bentonite clay, coal <b>tar,</b> and humic <b>acid)</b> addition, catalyst pelletization as well as the comparison of MWCNT and large-pore OMC-supported KCoRhMo catalyst systems were investigated in phases 1 and 2, respectively. Extensive studies in phases 3, 4 and 5 are enumerated as: 3) the comparative study of chemical pre-treatments (acid and base) of OMC-supported KCoRhMoS 2 catalysts; 4) the optimization of binder (BC) loadings on OMC-supported KCoRhMoS 2 catalysts and their catalytic performance study; and 5) the synthesis, characterization and application of novel K-promoted CoRhMo catalysts supported over CNH and its by-products (OCPf & OCP) for the HAS reactions. Finally, the impacts of process parameters (temperature, pressure, and gas-hourly-space-velocity) were evaluated using the optimum KCoRhMo/CNH catalyst. The power law model was then used to fix the experimental data in the kinetic study to ascertain the activation energies (Ea) of ethanol and propanol. Low values of Ea (54. 4 and 92. 2 kJ/mol, respectively) were obtained compared to those reported by other researchers. Long-term deactivation study of the sulfided KCoRhMo/CNH catalyst corroborated its durability over 500 h of continuous HAS reaction in a fixed bed reactor...|$|R
