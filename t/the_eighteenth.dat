5|$|At {{the start}} of <b>the</b> <b>Eighteenth</b> Dynasty, only kings were buried within the valley in large tombs. When a non-royal person was buried, {{it was in a}} small rock cut chamber, close to the tomb of their master. Amenhotep III's tomb was {{constructed}} in the Western Valley, and while his son Akhenaten moved his tomb's construction to Amarna, it is thought that the unfinished WV25 may have originally been intended for him. With the return to religious orthodoxy at the end of <b>the</b> <b>Eighteenth</b> Dynasty, Tutankhamun, Ay, and Horemheb returned to the royal necropolis.|$|E
