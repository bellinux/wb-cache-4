These peoples were drawn from an amalgamation of Ojibwa, Odawa, and Potowatami clans, which formed the Three Fires Confederacy, also called the Council of Three Fires, in A.D. 796. These clans came together through common links in both language and culture, developing a self-sufficient society where <b>tasks</b> <b>and</b> <b>responsibilities</b> were equally shared among all members.|$|E

2500|$|The first Borisov {{government}} also initiated administrative reform by cutting {{the number of}} ministries and agencies. Two ministries were subsumed by others already in November 2009. Next was the streamlining of government agencies. In 2010, a full list of these agencies was compiled – 122 in all. After a month's work, 30 were slated for closure. Here the reform team incurred the wrath of labor unions and ex-government officials, who {{at the same time}} argued that streamlining was necessary but these were the wrong [...] "victims." [...] The government moved ahead and within one year of the start of reforms the government payroll was reduced by 13,000 (out of 110,000 initially). Still, the number of government entities and bureaucrats remained higher than a decade earlier, which was the desired goal. The next step was to create a common salary and promotion structure for the whole administration, starting in 2011. Prior to that, a patchwork of nearly 90 separate laws regulated the pay of public officials {{in different parts of the}} government. As a result, some administrations were paid three times more than others, for comparable <b>tasks</b> <b>and</b> <b>responsibilities.</b> Some administrations had double the paid annual leave of others. Some had a bonus system in place; others paid out only fixed salaries. Putting all this into one law required significant work by Parliament - over 200 pieces of legislation had to be amended.|$|E

40|$|This Working Paper {{presents}} the results of the empirical research which I have conducted into the norms of good administration that are operated by the European Ombudsman in the field of tenders. The aim of the research was to discover whether the European Ombudsman is actively involved in creating norms of good administration in individual decisions, and in the end to make an inventory of the norms of good administration that have been operated by the Ombudsman to decide complaints about maladministration in this policy field. This empirical research is based upon a normative vision on the European Ombudsman as a developer of norms of good administration. The European Ombudsman has his own <b>task</b> <b>and</b> <b>responsibility</b> in respect of the review of administrative behaviour which is different from the <b>task</b> <b>and</b> <b>responsibility</b> of the Court. Administrative bodies do not only have to act lawfully, but also properly, i. e. in accordance with the principle of good administration. In my view the European Ombudsman has his own responsibility in autonomously developing the standard of good administration (and developing "Ombudsnorms") and to review administrative behaviour for compliance with that ethical standard...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to discuss and analyse whether {{recommendations}} on corporate governance have led to more transparency and well-defined corporate identities for listed small and medium-sized companies through their external communication on corporate governance. The paper focuses on the <b>task</b> <b>and</b> <b>responsibility</b> of the board and discusses the effect of external communication on management, transparency and corporate identity. The paper also analyses results from two empirical studies on communication on corporate governance from 60 Danish listed companies. It can be concluded that communication through corporate governance has led to more transparency in how companies are managed. There is room for improvement, however, before external communication leads to well-defined company identities.
