5000|$|As it was Memorial Day weekend, NASCARs pre-race {{would pay}} tribute to American war veterans. After the {{invocation}} was delivered by Duck Dynastys Willie Robertson, Grand Marshal Sergeant Aaron Causey, {{with his wife and}} United Service Organizations Alan Reyes delivered the command to start engines. Denny Hamlin started on pole but was quickly passed for the lead by Matt Kenseth. Kasey Kahne took the lead on lap 24 and continued to lead through a round of green flag pit stops and until the first caution came out for debris on lap 68. Kahne continued to lead through pit stops and on the restart on lap 74 until Kyle Busch passed him on lap 75. Kahne retook the lead on lap 78 and quickly pulled away. Kahne continued to lead until the second caution on lap 112 for debris after Casey Mears hit the wall. Busch was first off of pit road and led on the restart on lap 119. The third caution came out on lap 122 when a cable that suspended a FOX Sports television camera over the frontstretch of the track snapping and falling on the track. Several cars ran over the cable, but only two sustained major damage: Kyle Busch, whose car had caused it <b>to</b> <b>snap</b> <b>in</b> the first <b>place,</b> and Marcos Ambrose. The red flag then came out on lap 126 as track officials cleaned up the cables. After a delay of 10 minutes and 40 seconds, NASCAR brought the cars down pit road and gave each team 15 minutes to look over their cars and do repairs if needed. Ten spectators were injured {{as a result of the}} cable failure. Busch continued to lead on the restart on lap 131 and led until green flag pit stops. When he made a pit stop on lap 177, Brad Keselowski and Danica Patrick each led one lap before the lead cycled back to Kenseth with Busch in 2nd on lap 179. Kenseth led until lap 222, when he made another green flag pit stop. Kenseth cycled out with a lead of over six seconds and had lapped all but 15 cars when the caution came out for debris on lap 241. Kenseth continued to lead on the restart (after pit stops). Kyle Buschs car started to slow and on lap 257, both his and Dale Earnhardt, Jr.s cars lost their engines. Earnhardts car dropped oil on the track in turn three and Greg Biffle slipped in it, then hit the wall, along with Dave Blaney and Travis Kvapil. Another red flag waved as crews worked to clean up oil around the track. After everyone but Kenseth made pit stops, Kenseth led on the restart on lap 266 ...|$|R

Wrought iron rivets made from iron bar typically contained stringer filaments running the length of the rivet, but filaments at right angles to the tension, particularly beneath the head, caused weakness.|$|R

40|$|AbstractIn this study, we {{demonstrate}} specific {{interaction of}} the GluR 2 Î±-amino- 3 -hydroxy- 5 -methyl- 4 -isoxazolepropionate (AMPA) receptor subunit C-terminal peptide with an ATPase N-ethylmaleimideâ€“sensitive fusion protein (NSF) and Î±- and Î²-soluble NSF attachment proteins (SNAPs), as well as dendritic colocalization of these proteins. The assembly of the GluR 2 â€“NSFâ€“SNAP complex is ATP hydrolysis reversible and resembles the binding of NSF and SNAP with the SNAP receptor (SNARE) membrane fusion apparatus. We provide evidence that the molar ratio of NSF <b>to</b> <b>SNAP</b> <b>in</b> the GluR 2 â€“NSFâ€“SNAP complex {{is similar to that}} of the t-SNARE syntaxinâ€“NSFâ€“SNAP complex.

40|$|Nitric oxide (NO) -mediated, endothelium-dependent {{vasodilator}} {{function in}} rat aortic smooth muscle {{was investigated in}} an in vitro model of endogenous vascular superoxide anion stress, generated by pretreatment with the Cu/Zn superoxide dismutase (SOD, EC 1. 15. 1. 1) inhibitor, diethyldithiocarbamate (DETCA). Contraction to noradrenaline (NA, 1 [*]nMâ€“ 1 [*]Î¼M) in endothelium-intact vessels was augmented after a 30 [*]min pretreatment with DETCA (10 [*]mM) followed by 30 [*]min washout. This effect was abolished by NG-nitro-L-arginine methyl ester (L-NAME, 0. 3 [*]mM) and removal of the endothelium and partially reversed by exogenous Cu/Zn SOD (200 [*]u[*]mlâˆ’ 1). Endothelium- and basal NO-dependent vasorelaxation to the phosphodiesterase (PDE) type V inhibitor ONO- 1505 (4 -[2 -(2 -hydroxyethoxy) ethylamino]- 2 -(1 H-imidazol- 1 -yl) - 6 -methoxyquinazoline methanesulphonate) (0. 1 â€“ 10 [*]Î¼M) was inhibited after DETCA (10 [*]mM) pretreatment. In addition, the ability of L-NAME (0. 3 [*]mM) to enhance established contractile tone was effectively absent. In contrast, DETCA pretreatment did not significantly affect vasorelaxation to acetylcholine (ACh, 1 [*]nMâ€“ 3 [*]Î¼M) or S-nitroso-N-acetyl penicillamine (SNAP, 0. 03 â€“ 30 [*]Î¼M). However, L-NAME (0. 3 [*]mM) unmasked an inhibitory effect of DETCA pretreatment on vasorelaxation <b>to</b> <b>SNAP</b> <b>in</b> endothelium-intact vessels while markedly potentiating vasorelaxation <b>to</b> <b>SNAP</b> <b>in</b> control tissue. L-NAME (0. 3 [*]mM) - and exogenous catalase (200 [*]u[*]mlâˆ’ 1) -sensitive vasorelaxation to exogenous Cu/Zn SOD (200 [*]u[*]mlâˆ’ 1) was greater after DETCA (10 [*]mM) pretreatment in endothelium-intact aortic rings. This difference was abolished by catalase (200 [*]u[*]mlâˆ’ 1). In conclusion, tissue Cu/Zn SOD inhibition elicited a selective lesion in basal endothelial function in rat isolated aortic smooth muscle, consistent with the inactivation of basal NO by superoxide anion. The resulting leftward shift in nitrovasodilator reactivity, due {{to the loss of}} the tonic depression by basal NO, is likely to mask the inhibitory effect of superoxide anion on agonist-stimulated endothelial function and nitrovasodilator-derived NO, thereby accounting for the differential pattern of endothelial dysfunction after DETCA pretreatment...|$|R

At the same instant the leopard skin was thrown back, and the right arm of a tall athletic Kafir was bared. The hand grasped a light assagai, or darting spear. Both men were taken by surprise, and for one instant they glared at each other. The instance between them was so short that death to each seemed imminent, for the white man's weapon was a deadly one, and the cast of the lithe savage would doubtless have been swift and sure.|$|R
