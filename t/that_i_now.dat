500|$|On November 17, the Swedish Academy {{announced}} that Dylan would not travel to Stockholm for the Nobel Prize Ceremony due to [...] "pre-existing commitments". At the Nobel Banquet in Stockholm on December 10, 2016, Dylan's banquet speech {{was given by}} Azita Raji, U.S. Ambassador to Sweden. The speech stated: [...] "From an early age, I've been familiar with and reading and absorbing the works {{of those who were}} deemed worthy of such a distinction: Kipling, Shaw, Thomas Mann, Pearl Buck, Albert Camus, Hemingway. These giants of literature whose works are taught in the schoolroom, housed in libraries around the world and spoken of in reverent tones have always made a deep impression. <b>That</b> <b>I</b> <b>now</b> join the names on such a list is truly beyond words." [...] Patti Smith accepted Dylan's Nobel with a [...] "transcendent performance" [...] of his song [...] "A Hard Rain's A-Gonna Fall" [...] to orchestral accompaniment.|$|E
500|$|The {{cultural}} references {{featured in}} the episode have attracted both criticism and praise. The parody of Next Media Animation has been commended by several reviewers. [...] Hayden Childs of The A.V. Club commented that the episode [...] "features a couple of quite funny sight gags, like the fresco on Moe's ceiling and the delightful Taiwanese dramatization of certain events", but further wrote that the [...] "rest of the jokes and references clang away without being too funny or too insulting, and that {{is probably the best}} that any viewers can ask of The Simpsons in its advanced age." [...] Television Blend's Steve West commented that the episode was the worst of the Animation Domination lineup that week and further elaborated that the cultural references [...] "are always a year behind, and the smart writers who used classic American culture to bring wit to the series have been replaced by those who want to mimic South Park and Family Guy. They fail miserably, and it's gotten so bad <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>now</b> no longer care about the relationship between Marge and Homer." ...|$|E
2500|$|Confessional {{responses}} {{the couple}} received thereafter reached the hundreds. In a podcast with mrbrown, Woo explained the typical reader response was [...] "How is it <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>now</b> have a house, I {{now have a}} car, a job, why I am still unhappy?" [...] The couple [...] "felt a responsibility to do something", which inspired them to write the film, the original working title of which was The 5Cs.|$|E

60|$|I {{thanked him}} for his courtesy, and in some {{confusion}} turned to Reverie with the remark <b>that</b> <b>I</b> thought <b>I</b> <b>now</b> recollected to have heard Christian's name, but understood he had indeed arrived, at last, at the Celestial City {{for which he had}} set out.|$|R
2500|$|One man, in particular, was {{impressed}} by the young man. Thomas Howard, 3rd Duke of Norfolk, reported to Cromwell in August 1536 that his son was in good health and, [...] "sparing no horseflesh to run after the deer and hounds. I trust you will not be discontent <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>now</b> cause him to forbear his book. Be sure you shall have in him a wise quick piece." ...|$|E
2500|$|I {{am asking}} you to go because of my desire {{to have the best}} {{possible}} on-the-spot appraisal of the military and paramilitary effort to defeat the Viet Cong[...] [...] [...] The events in South Vietnam since May have now raised serious questions both about the present prospects for success against the Viet Cong and still more about the future effectiveness of this effort unless there can be important political improvement in the country. It is in this context <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>now</b> need your appraisal of the situation. If the prognosis in your judgment is not hopeful, I would like your views on what action must be taken by the South Vietnamese Government and what steps our Government should take to lead the Vietnamese to that action.|$|E
2500|$|In 2010 France banned face {{coverings}} {{including women}} wearing the niqab. The French Collective against Islamophobia reported [...] "an explosion" [...] {{in the number}} of physical attacks on women wearing the niqab. Kenza Drider, a protester against the law, said: [...] "I'm insulted about three to four times a day. Most say, 'Go home'; some say, 'We'll kill you.' One said: 'We'll do to you what we did to the Jews.'... I feel <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>now</b> know what Jewish women went through before the Nazi roundups in France. When they went out in the street they were identified, singled out, they were vilified. Now that's happening to us." [...] After the Charlie Hebdo shooting in January 2015, there were reports of attacks on mosques and Muslim citizens throughout the country.|$|E

2500|$|Following his Australian {{citizenship}} ceremony, Coetzee {{said that}} [...] "I did {{not so much}} leave South Africa, a country with which I retain strong emotional ties, but come to Australia. I came because {{from the time of}} my first visit in 1991, I was attracted by the free and generous spirit of the people, by the beauty of the land itself and– when I first saw Adelaide– by the grace of the city <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>now</b> have the honour of calling my home." [...] When he initially moved to Australia, he had cited the South African government's lax attitude to crime in that country as a reason for the move, leading to a spat with Thabo Mbeki, who, speaking of Coetzee's novel Disgrace stated that [...] "South Africa is not only a place of rape". In 1999, the African National Congress submission to an investigation into racism in the media by the South African Human Rights Commission named Disgrace as a novel exploiting racist stereotypes. However, when Coetzee won his Nobel Prize, Mbeki congratulated him [...] "on behalf of the South African nation and indeed the continent of Africa".|$|E
