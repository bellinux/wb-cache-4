5|$|Beginning {{with the}} 2012 tournament, the {{qualifying}} round will be eliminated, and the 16 <b>teams</b> <b>will</b> {{be divided into}} two groups of eight, with each team playing seven games in the preliminary round.|$|E
5|$|Often, <b>teams</b> <b>will</b> {{finish a}} season with {{identical}} records. It becomes necessary, therefore, to devise means to break these ties, either {{to determine which}} <b>teams</b> <b>will</b> qualify for the playoffs, or to determine seeding in the playoff tournament. The rules below are applied in order until the tie is broken. If three teams are tied for one playoff spot and the third team is eliminated at any step, the tie breaker reverts to step one for the remaining two teams. If multiple playoff spots are at stake, the rules are applied in order until the first team qualifies, then the process is started again for the remaining teams.|$|E
5|$|In late September it {{was also}} {{announced}} that the New York Giants, New York Jets and the New Jersey Sports and Exhibition Authority had reached an agreement where both <b>teams</b> <b>will</b> work together {{to build a new}} stadium adjacent to the current Giants Stadium.|$|E
50|$|The veto {{process was}} also {{changed for the}} best of one games. One team can decide whether to veto first or second. The team that vetoes first will remove two maps. The second <b>team</b> <b>will</b> remove three maps. The first <b>team</b> <b>will</b> then choose {{from one of the}} two {{remaining}} maps. The second <b>team</b> <b>will</b> then choose the side it wants to start on. The best of three veto process was unchanged. Each <b>team</b> <b>will</b> remove one map. Then each <b>team</b> <b>will</b> choose one map. For the decider map, each <b>team</b> <b>will</b> remove one more map to decide the third map.|$|R
5000|$|Only one <b>team</b> <b>will</b> finish 0-3 {{and that}} <b>team</b> <b>will</b> place in 8th.|$|R
50|$|In {{the first}} round the 7th-ranked <b>team</b> <b>will</b> meet the 10th-ranked team and the 8th-ranked <b>team</b> <b>will</b> meet the 9th-ranked team for {{a place in the}} second round. In the second round, the top-ranked <b>team</b> <b>will</b> meet the lowest-ranked winner of {{the first round}}, the 2nd-ranked <b>team</b> <b>will</b> face the other winner of the first round, the 3rd-ranked <b>team</b> <b>will</b> face the 6th-ranked team, and the 4th-ranked <b>team</b> <b>will</b> face the 5th-ranked team. In the third round, the highest {{remaining}} seed is matched against the lowest remaining seed. In each round the higher-seeded team is awarded home advantage. In the first round the meetings are played as best-of-three series and the rest is best-of-seven series that follows an alternating home team format: the higher-seeded <b>team</b> <b>will</b> play at home for games 1 and 3 (plus 5 and 7 if necessary), and the lower-seeded <b>team</b> <b>will</b> be at home for game 2 and 4 (plus 6 if necessary).|$|R
5|$|It is {{proposed}} that in 2019 World Cup, {{the number of}} teams participating will go down to 10 and all the <b>teams</b> <b>will</b> play against each other once in round robin format, before entering the semifinals. This {{would be similar to}} the one used in 1992 World Cup.|$|E
5|$|Finally, in July 2000, the Avalanche, Nuggets and Pepsi Center {{were finally}} bought by real estate {{entrepreneur}} Stan Kroenke in a $450million deal. Kroenke is the brother-in-law of the Lauries; his wife Ann is Nancy Laurie's sister. Liberty retained only a 6.5% stake {{of the sports}} franchises. As part of the deal, Kroenke placed the teams into a trust that would ensure the <b>teams</b> <b>will</b> stay in Denver until at least 2025. After the deal, Kroenke organized his sports assets under Kroenke Sports Enterprises.|$|E
5|$|The 2005season marks {{only the}} eighthtime in 50years that exactly twoteams {{have gone into}} the bowl season undefeated. This {{has been a major}} {{criticism}} of the BCS format, which does not use a playoff to determine the national championship. Unless there are exactly two unbeaten teams, both from BCS conferences, the choice of the top twoteams can generate controversy. If more than twoundefeated teams remain, then one or more of those teams must be left out. If one or fewer undefeated teams remain, then an opponent must be chosen from among the one-loss teams, meaning that other one-loss <b>teams</b> <b>will</b> be left out.|$|E
50|$|Chip Ganassi Racing: <b>Team</b> <b>will</b> utilize Honda {{engines in}} 2012. The entire four-car <b>team</b> <b>will</b> return in 2012.|$|R

In the second round, the highest {{remaining}} seed is matched against the lowest remaining seed. In each round the higher-seeded team is awarded home advantage. Each series is a best-of-seven series that follows an alternating home team format: the higher-seeded <b>team</b> <b>will</b> play at home for games 1 and 3 (plus 5 and 7 if necessary), and the lower-seeded <b>team</b> <b>will</b> be at home for game 2 and 4 (plus 6 if necessary).|$|R

5|$|A New Day for Detroit - about Detroit's recent sports renaissance and {{economic}} revival, {{focusing on the}} construction of the Little Caesars Arena in Midtown Detroit, the future home of the Pistons (who had played at The Palace of Auburn Hills since 1988) and the Red Wings (who had played at the Joe Louis Arena since 1979), which will mean both teams' 2017–2018 seasons will be first time since the Lions' move to the Pontiac Silverdome in 1975 (and subsequent return to Detroit when they moved to Ford Field in 2002), that all four of Detroit's major professional <b>teams</b> <b>will</b> play in the city. It premiered on April 28, 2017 and was narrated by Oscar-winning actor and Detroit native J. K. Simmons.|$|E

Teams are seeded to enter the competition over any of the first four rounds, after which eight <b>teams</b> <b>will</b> remain to contest the quarter-finals. The final is played at a neutral venue.|$|E
5|$|Notably, KOF 94 innovated {{the genre}} by {{replacing}} a traditional round-based format used in preceding fighting {{games with a}} format consisting of 3-on-3 team based matches dubbed the Team Battle System. Instead of choosing a single character, the player selects from one of eight available teams, each consisting of three members. Before each match, the players choose {{the order in which}} each of their team member enters the battle. When the match begins, the members chosen to go first on their respective <b>teams</b> <b>will</b> fight. When one character is defeated, the following member of the same team will take his or her place, while the character on the other team will have a small portion of their life restored (if energy was lost during the previous round). If a character is losing a match against the opponent, then the player can call one of the remaining teammates standing on the sidelines to jump in and perform a support attack. The match ends when all three members of either team lose.|$|E

5|$|After {{a season}} with little {{change to the}} make-up of the league, the 2009–10 saw further change. The San Jose Sharks ended their {{association}} with the Chinese team. They pulled out all coaches and players they had sent. The Chinese Ice Hockey Association took over the team and brought in new import players and coaches to replace those lost. The team also changed its name from China Sharks to China Dragon. Midway through the previous season the Seibu Prince Rabbits announced that due to financial difficulties they would withdraw from the league {{at the end of}} the 2008–09 season. They were unable to find a buyer and the team folded. However, another team from Japan joined the league in the off-season. The Tohoku Free Blades were able to hire enough players and imports to join the league in time for the beginning of the season. This again left the league with seven teams. The league left the number of games played at 36, marking the first time that the league didn't adjust the schedule from the previous year. The league also introduced a couple of rules changes. All face-offs will take place on one of the nine face-off dots as well <b>teams</b> <b>will</b> no longer be allowed to change after an icing. Anyang Halla repeated as the regular season champions finishing with 79 points and 23 wins. The team also set the record for the most goals by a team in a 36-game season with 180. Alex Kim and Tim Smith lead the points race. Both finished with 75 points on the season, with Kim taking the goal scoring race with 29 and Smith taking the assists race with 48. The League further reduced the number of teams making the playoffs to only four. As well they brought in referees from outside the league to assist in officiating. The two Korean teams faced each other in one semi-final guaranteeing for the first time that a Korean team would appear in the final. Halla defeated High1 in four games after a loss on home ice. The Cranes similarly defeated the Eagles in four games. The final was a close series, needing all five games and with four of the five games only being decided by a single goal. In the final game, Halla tied the game with 17 seconds remaining and in over-time the team captain, Kim Woo-jae scored to give Halla a victory and mark the first time a non-Japanese team had won the cup. In the play-offs Brock Radunske led with six goals and 13 points overall while Darcy Takeshi Mitani led with 8 assists. Patrik Martinec took regular season MVP honors, and Cho Min-ho, also from Halla, was named Young Guy of the Year.|$|E
