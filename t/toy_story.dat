Initially, the first sequel to <b>Toy</b> <b>Story</b> {{was going to be a}} direct-to-video release, with development beginning in 1996.

5|$|Following {{the release}} of <b>Toy</b> <b>Story</b> 2 in 1999, Pixar and Disney had a gentlemen's {{agreement}} that Disney would not make any sequels without Pixar's involvement, despite their own right to do so. After the two companies were unable {{to agree on a}} new deal, Disney announced in 2004 they would plan move forward on sequels with/without Pixar, and put <b>Toy</b> <b>Story</b> 3 into pre-production at Disney's new CGI division Circle 7 Animation. However, when Lasseter was placed in charge of all Disney and Pixar animation following the 2006 merger of the companies, he put all sequels on hold and <b>Toy</b> <b>Story</b> 3 was cancelled. In May 2006, it was announced that <b>Toy</b> <b>Story</b> 3 was back in pre-production with a new plot and under Pixar's control. The film was released on June 18, 2010, as Pixar's eleventh feature film.|$|E

Released in 1995, <b>Toy</b> <b>Story</b> opened to critical acclaim and commercial success, leading to Pixar signing a five-film deal with Disney, which bore critically and financially successful computer animated films such as A Bug's Life (1998), <b>Toy</b> <b>Story</b> 2 (1999), and Monsters, Inc. (2001).|$|E
