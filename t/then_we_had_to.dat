We wanted to find a solution to a plot problem. And we still had Leonard Nimoy’s presence there, even though he [...] was dead. So they came up with the bizarre idea of putting his presence into Anna Torv, which is outrageous. Outrageous, and yet we did it, and {{had a lot of fun}} doing it. <b>Then</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> get him out of it. Because Leonard’s officially retired, so we did the animation to use his voice." ...|$|E
500|$|Frank Spotnitz, Richard Zajdlic, Tony Saint and Simon Burke were {{contracted}} as {{the series}} writers, while Alex Holmes, Bill Eagles, Paul Wilmshurst and Daniel Percival {{serve as the}} series directors. Andy Harries and Elaine Pyke were the show's executive producers, with Percival and Spotnitz working as Co-Executive Producers. In addition, Michael Casey, Trevor Hopkins and Sue De Beauvoir were the series producers, with Bill Shepard serving as co-producer. Spotnitz wrote the first episodes. He was approached to write for the series because the producers needed somebody to reimagine the show as Armitage was committed to The Hobbit in New Zealand, by introducing two new leads. Spotnitz described the process; [...] "We had this great format, this great world of 'Strike Back' and <b>then</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> imagine who were the new characters {{who were going to}} drive the show in the second year." [...] Before Project Dawn was even announced, the crew were scouting for locations in South Africa, where the first series was shot, as well as investigating {{other parts of the world}} including the United States, South America, and Europe.|$|E

Having directed Batman entirely in Britain, Burton agreed, and designers from Batmans art department were employed by Paramount for Sleepy Hollow. As a result, principal photography was pushed back to November 20, 1998 at Leavesden Film Studios, which had been recently vacated by [...] The majority of filming took place at Leavesden, with studio other work at Shepperton Studios, where the massive Tree of the Dead set was built using Stage H. Production then moved to the Hambleden estate at Lime Tree Valley for a month-long shoot in March, where the town of Sleepy Hollow was constructed. [...] "We came to England figuring we would find a perfect little town," [...] producer Adam Schroeder recalled, [...] "and <b>then</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> build it anyway." [...] Filming in Britain continued through April, and a few [...] scenes were shot using a sound stage in Yonkers, New York the following May.|$|E

Hawryliw {{had been}} The X-Files {{property}} master from 1993 to 1998 while {{the show was}} filmed in Vancouver, British Columbia. Over the years, he had written several scripts but had never submitted them to The X-Files writing staff. Eventually, {{he moved on to}} work on Millennium, where he developed a friendship with Guttridge. Guttridge showed Hawryliw a script he had been writing that he wanted to submit for The X-Files. Although the story was not written like an X-Files script, Hawryliw enjoyed the premise. The two decided to form a partnership: Guttridge would craft the basic story and script and Hawryliw would help to craft it into an X-Files script. Hawryliw later explained that the idea to make Pinker search out his son: [...] "There's this unique man who can walk through walls. Now, who would this ability best apply to? Well, a convict obviously—a guy in prison. But <b>then</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> give him an even stronger, more compelling reason to want his freedom, and that was where his son came from".|$|E
500|$|When Manfredini {{returned}} {{for the first}} sequel, he had an easier time composing since he only needed to perfect what he had already created. Over {{the course of the}} sequels, Manfredini loosened the philosophy that the theme should be reserved just for the killer. Manfredini describes the style of the sequels as more of a [...] "setting 'em up and knocking 'em down" [...] approach, which meant that there were more [...] "McGuffins and red‑herrings" [...] that required the killer's theme music be played to try to trick the audience. Manfredini explains, [...] "The original had the real myopic approach, and <b>then</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> start thinking of the sequels as more conventional films." [...] For Part 3, Manfredini only returned to score the first and last reels of the film because he was busy with a Broadway production. Jack Tillar pieced together portions of the score from the first two films to fill the remaining time for Part 3, while Michael Zagar composed an opening and closing theme. Manfredini and Zagar met at the latter's apartment, where Zagar rescored the original opening theme using a disco beat. Manfredini {{returned for}} The Final Chapter, and although there were similar elements to the score, everything was newly recorded for the fourth Friday the 13th.|$|E

It isn’t a judgment of guilt. It isn't a disciplinary measure. And what we've done is to use the interim to try {{to understand the nature of}} the case better. Weighing a lot of things [...] the presumption of innocence, the nature of the charges, the need of the students to get on with their life. Once the facts took the turn they did in December, <b>then</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> rebalance those things. Then at that point it just seemed to us that simple fairness meant that we had to allow the students to come back." ...|$|E

Swimming with Butch O'Hare meant that at eight o'clock in the morning, you swam out into the ocean off Maui; he would still be out there {{at three in the}} afternoon! If he got hungry, Butch would roll over and dive, {{and the next thing you}} knew, he would come up with a fish of some sort. Then he'd just roll over and lie on his back like an otter and eat the thing raw! He really impressed us with that! One day, he came back to the surface with an octopus draped over his arm. He said, 'Now, you have to learn how to kill these things, boys: you bite 'em right behind the eye.' And with that, he chomped down! The octopus has some sort of spinal cord there, and biting it there does kill it! <b>Then</b> <b>we</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> go back to the beach where Butch would put these things in a frying pan with a little oil and some salt and stir them around.
