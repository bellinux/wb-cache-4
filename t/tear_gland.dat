40|$|AIMS—To {{assess the}} course of <b>tear</b> <b>gland</b> {{function}} of patients with keratoconjunctivitis sicca (KCS) associated with primary (KCS-PSS) or secondary Sjögren's syndrome (KCS-SSS), and of patients with KCS not related to Sjögren's syndrome (KCS-NS).  METHODS—In 106  patients with dry eye an ophthalmic diagnosis of KCS was made. Subsequent evaluations revealed a diagnosis of KCS-PSS in 31, KCS-SSS in 19, and KCS-NS in 56  patients. Follow up assessments have been performed 10 - 12 years after initial diagnosis.  RESULTS—At baseline and at follow up <b>tear</b> <b>gland</b> function tests were worse in patients with KCS-PSS compared with the other forms of KCS. At follow up in the KCS-SSS patient group the <b>tear</b> <b>gland</b> function variables returned to marginal normal limits. In contrast with expectation, a marked improvement of the <b>tear</b> <b>gland</b> function variables in the KCS-NS patient group was noted.  CONCLUSIONS—In KCS-PSS patients <b>tear</b> <b>gland</b> function is characterised by a steady state situation. In KCS-SSS patients the normalisation of <b>tear</b> <b>gland</b> function variables most probably reflects a remission of the underlying disease. In view of the overall improvement in KCS-NS patients the term age related KCS should be avoided. ...|$|E

40|$|Objective. Little {{is known}} about the {{relation}} ship between lachrymal and salivary gland involvement in Sjogren's syndrome (SS). It is also of interest to know which eye test contributes most to the diagnosis of SS. We investigated the performance of different tear tests and how these tests relate to common serologic and salivary tests in SS. Methods. In patients suspected of SS. the tear breakup time and the tear mucus score were evaluated in addition to the routine tests. Eighty consecutive patients were included, categorized into primary SS (pSS), secondary SS (sSS), and negative for SS. Results. The tear breakup time and mucus score both performed insufficiently in diagnosing SS, in contrast to the Rose Bengal score. In pSS and sSS patients, a clear correlation was noted between tear and saliva quality and secretion rate, and between the Rose Bengal score and parotid sialography. Increased Rose Bengal scores also correlated significantly with hyperglobulinemia and presence of SSB antibodies in serum, with duration of subjective eye dryness, and with decreased <b>tear</b> <b>gland</b> function. Conclusion. The Rose Bengal score remains the eye test of choice having the highest specificity for SS. Hyperglobulinemia and especially positive SSB serology may warrant close monitoring of the eyes, since these serum findings appear to relate to the severity of ocular surface damage. Theoretically, a positive evaluation of either the ocular or oral component, in addition to positive serology or histopathology, could be sufficient to diagnose the syndrome for clinical purposes...|$|E

40|$|Hearing loss (HL) is a sensory {{disorder}} that affects an estimated 250 million people worldwide and can greatly affect quality of life. In New Zealand, more than 10 % {{of the population}} is affected by HL with the Māori population being overrepresented among all age groups. Therefore, understanding the mechanism of HL is extremely important for the development of new pharmaceuticals for the prevention or treatment of HL disorders. The main aim of the research undertaken in this thesis was to characterise the function of the Mus musculus (mouse) vitelline membrane outer layer one (Vmo 1) gene. This gene is considered an excellent candidate for being involved in human HL and/or balance disorders. Our hypothesis is based on its restricted gene localisation within the mouse inner ear and the postulated function of Reissner’s membrane. Two methods were used to address this aim. Firstly, comparative genomics was used to determine the level of nucleotide and amino acid conservation of VMO 1 across mammalian species, and to search for DNA motifs that may imply a biological function. Secondly, molecular biology and histochemical techniques were used to DNA sequence the Vmo 1 gene, detect the expression of 22 kDa VMO 1 protein within mouse tissues, and to localise the expression of VMO 1 protein within the mouse inner ear. Comparative genomics results showed VMO 1 to be highly conserved across 36 species. An in-depth analysis of the differences and similiarites between the mouse, human and chicken indicated a high level of gene conservation with an even greater degree of identity and similarity seen at a proteomic level. In addition, a high level of conservation across amino acids involved in the formation and stabilisation of the three dimensional structure. Thus, results suggest an important function for the VMO 1 protein. Two commerical VMO 1 antibodies were purchased to determine the localisation of the mouse VMO 1 protein. They were validated for specificity using western blot analysis of protein lysates dissected from postnatal day 28 mice (P 28). VMO 1 was identified within the inner ear protein lysate and <b>tear</b> <b>gland</b> protein lysate of an expected molecular weight size of 20 - 37 kDa with additional binding observed in the ear sample at 250 kDa. Immunohistochemistry detected high concentrations of VMO 1 protein within the tectorial membrane (TM) and inner pillar cells (IPC) in inner ear sections from the mouse at P 5. In agreement with the comparative genomics analysis, VMO 1 is a secreted protein. The movement of the hair cells (HC) relative to the TM is is essential for the transduction of sound into electrical signals. The IPC act as supporting cells for the hair cells, and help to couple movement of the basilar membrane to the HC. In conclusion, the importance of the TM and IPC in hearing function, and the localisation of the VMO 1 protein within these structures implies an important role for VMO 1 in hearing function. We recommend further studies to examine the specificity of the VMO 1 antibody, {{and the development of a}} Vmo 1 knockout mouse to support the functional analysis of Vmo 1 in the auditory system...|$|E

5000|$|... syn-Propanethial S-oxide (C3H6OS), {{a member}} of a class of {{organosulfur}} compounds known as thiocarbonyl S-oxides (formerly [...] "sulfines"), is a liquid that acts as a lachrymatory agent (triggers tearing and stinging on contact with the eyes). The chemical is released from onions, Allium cepa, as they are sliced. The release is due to the breaking open of the onion cells and their releasing enzymes called alliinases, which then break down amino acid sulfoxides, generating sulfenic acids. A specific sulfenic acid, 1-propenesulfenic acid, formed when onions are cut, is rapidly rearranged by a second enzyme, called the lachrymatory factor synthase or LFS, giving syn-propanethial S-oxide. The gas diffuses through the air and, on contact with the eye, it stimulates sensory neurons creating a stinging, painful sensation. Tears are released from the <b>tear</b> <b>glands</b> to dilute and flush out the irritant. Recently, a structurally related lachrymatory compound, syn-butanethial S-oxide, C4H8OS, has been found in another genus Allium plant, Allium siculum.|$|R

In cell preparations from pancreas, parotid and lacrimal glands we measured ATP release and intracellular Ca 2 + activity using Fura- 2. The data showed that pancreatic secretion and salivary secretions were reduced in P 2 X 7 −/− mice, and in contrast, tear secretion was increased in P 2 X 7 −/− mice. The secretory phenotype was also dependent on the sex of the animal, such that males were more dependent on the P 2 X 7 receptor expression. ATP release in all cell preparations could be elicited by carbachol and other agonists, and this was independent of the P 2 X 7 receptor expression. ATP and carbachol increased intracellular Ca 2 + activity, but responses depended on the gland type, presence of the P 2 X 7 receptor and the sex of the animal. Together, these results demonstrate that cholinergic stimulation leads to release of ATP that can via P 2 X 7 receptors up-regulate pancreatic and salivary secretion but down-regulate tear secretion. Our data also indicate that there is an interaction between purinergic and cholinergic receptor signalling and that function of the P 2 X 7 receptor is suppressed in females. We conclude that the P 2 X 7 receptors are important in short-term physiological regulation of exocrine gland secretion...|$|R

40|$|Dry eye {{syndrome}} {{is a recent}} discovery {{in the group of}} distinct treatable ocular diseases. This condition has been observed to be increasing wildly in the recent past due to civilizational changes. Dry eye is also referred to as tear film instability, a condition that typically develops from deficiencies of one or more components of the biologically complex pre-ocular tear film. Tears are composed of three layers: the outer oily lipid layer, the middle watery lacrimal layer, and the inner mucous or mucin layer. Each layer is produced by {{a different part of the}} eye, for example, the lacrimal gland produces the lacrimal layer. Therefore, a problem originating in any part of the eye can result in dry eyes. Clinically, dry eye cases represent a mixed picture of an allergy, an infection, and either drug or chemical toxicity. Therefore, dry eyes are often considered to be an accompaniment of Spring Catarrh, Follicular/ Trachomatous conjunctivitis, Glaucoma, Aphakia, and so on, in clinical practice.

40|$|BACKGROUND/AIMS—The {{antimicrobial}} {{activity of}} the tear film exceeds the activity of its known constituents. The authors postulate that this excess activity {{is the result of}} antimicrobial peptides called defensins, and they aimed to look for defensins in the human eye.  METHODS—Evidence of defensin production was sought by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Intron spanning primers were designed for β defensins 1  and 2, and α defensins 5  and 6.  RT-PCR was performed on cornea, conjunctiva, and lacrimal gland samples, and reaction products were size fractionated and sequenced to confirm their identity. A monoclonal antibody was utilised for the detection of α defensins 1,  2, and 3  in tissue sections and in immunoblots of tears.  RESULTS—RT-PCR revealed β defensin 1  message in samples of conjunctiva, cornea, and lacrimal gland. β Defensin 2  message was detected in the conjunctiva and cornea but was absent from the lacrimal gland. α Defensin 5  and 6  message was absent in these tissues but α defensins 1,  2, and 3  were detected in normal <b>tears,</b> lacrimal <b>gland,</b> and inflamed conjunctiva by immunochemistry.  CONCLUSION—The data suggest the human eye innately produces a spectrum of antimicrobial defensin peptides.

40|$|The corneal {{wound healing}} {{response}} {{is a complex}} cascade involving cytokine mediated interactions between the epithelial cells, stromal keratocytes, corneal nerves, lacrimal <b>glands,</b> <b>tear</b> film and cells of the immune system. The response of the tissue changes depend on the inciting injury. For example, incisional, lamellar and surface scrape injuries, like the ones used in keratorefractive surgery procedures, are followed by typical wound healing responses that are similar in some respects, but different in others. The severity of this response effects {{the outcome of the}} surgery. This review article will provide an overview of the cellular interactions and cytokin regulations associated with corneal wound healing response and modulation of this response after keratorefractive surgical procedures. The purpose of this review is to provide an overview of the corneal wound healing cascade, stromal–epithelial-immune interactions mediated by cytokines, the healing response in refractive surgery procedures and the modulation of this response...|$|R
