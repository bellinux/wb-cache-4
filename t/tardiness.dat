5|$|All new {{subsidiary}} legislation must {{be sent to}} the Council for scrutiny within 14 days of their publication in the Government Gazette. The Council is then required to make its report to the Speaker and the appropriate Minister within 30 days. However, unlike with bills, there is no provision to extend the original deadline. As with bills, <b>tardiness</b> in sending an adverse report results in a conclusive presumption that the Council finds no differentiating measures in the {{subsidiary legislation}}. Where the Council issues an adverse report, the Minister must revoke or amend the offending provision within six months of the report, unless Parliament passes a resolution confirming that provision.|$|E

Colt ran his plant with a military-like discipline, he would fire workers for <b>tardiness,</b> sub-par work or even suggesting improvements to his designs.|$|E
5|$|Pitt became Prime Minister in December 1783, with Wilberforce a key {{supporter}} of his minority government. Despite their close friendship, {{there is no}} record that Pitt offered Wilberforce a ministerial position in this or future governments. This may have been due to Wilberforce's wish to remain an independent MP. Alternatively, Wilberforce's frequent <b>tardiness</b> and disorganisation, as well as the chronic eye problems that at times made reading impossible, may have convinced Pitt that his trusted friend was not ministerial material. When Parliament was dissolved in the spring of 1784, Wilberforce decided to stand as a candidate for the county of Yorkshire in the 1784 general election. On 6 April, he was returned as MP for Yorkshire at the age of twenty-four.|$|E
5|$|The tournaments {{were not}} without controversy. Players complained about Microsoft's <b>tardiness</b> in posting the {{official}} {{rules for the}} first playoff, and {{it was believed that}} the top posted score was not achievable by fair means. Officials, however, stated that the score was possible, and allowed the results to stand. In the second playoff, Microsoft initially named the runner up as the North American finalist, after disqualifying the winner for no publicly stated reason, but eventually had to send the second runner up to Tokyo when the first was unable to produce a passport in time.|$|E
5|$|That summer Garfield {{suffered}} from jaundice and significant weight loss. He {{was forced to}} return home, where his wife nursed him back to health. While he was home, Garfield's friends worked to gain him the Republican nomination for Congress, although he refused to politick with the delegates. He returned to military duty that autumn and went to Washington to await his next assignment. During this period of idleness, a rumor of an extra-marital affair caused friction in the Garfield marriage until Lucretia eventually chose to overlook it. Garfield repeatedly received tentative assignments that were quickly withdrawn, to his frustration. In the meantime, he served on the court-martial of Fitz John Porter for his <b>tardiness</b> at the Second Battle of Bull Run. He was convinced of Porter's guilt, and voted with his fellow generals to convict. The trial lasted almost two months, from November 1862 to January 1863, {{and by the end}} of it, Garfield had at last procured an assignment as Chief of Staff to Major General William S. Rosecrans.|$|E
5|$|The Exchequer of Pleas or Court of Exchequer was a {{court that}} dealt with matters of equity, a set of legal {{principles}} based on natural law and common law in England and Wales. Originally part of the curia regis, or King's Council, the Exchequer of Pleas split from the curia during the 1190s, to sit as an independent, central court. The Court of Chancery's reputation for <b>tardiness</b> and expense resulted in much of its business transferring to the Exchequer. The Exchequer and Chancery, with similar jurisdictions, drew closer together over the years, until an argument was made during the 19th century that having two seemingly identical courts was unnecessary. As a result, the Exchequer lost its equity jurisdiction. With the Judicature Acts, the Exchequer was formally dissolved as a judicial body by an Order in Council of 16December 1880.|$|E

25|$|Earlier in the year, Cabrini had {{declined}} to renew Philip's contract, citing repeated <b>tardiness</b> and alcohol-related issues, effectively firing her. Shortly after she had been informed of that decision, {{she went out to}} a bar with other Cabrini employees. The outing led to her spending the night in jail. She complained to police that a fellow intern touched her inappropriately during that time. The prosecutor who investigated the case dropped the sexual abuse charge and instead charged Philip with third-degree falsely reporting an incident, a misdemeanor under New York law. He offered to drop the charge if she recanted the original complaint, but she refused and was held overnight pending release.|$|E
25|$|In New South Wales, {{there were}} delays in obtaining an early sailing due to <b>tardiness</b> in the {{authorities}} confirming good conduct with the convicts' assignees and then getting them released from their assignments. James Loveless, Thomas and John Stanfield, and James Brine departed Sydney on the John Barry on 11 September 1837, reaching Plymouth on 17 March 1838, {{one of the}} departure points for convict transport ships. A plaque next to the Mayflower Steps in Plymouth's historical Barbican area commemorates the arrival. Although due to depart with the others, James Hammett was detained in Windsor, charged with an assault, while the others left the colony. It was not until March 1839 that he sailed, arriving in England in August 1839.|$|E

Hill reportedly demanded to be addressed by everyone, including her bandmates, as [...] "Ms. Hill"; she also considered changing her moniker to [...] "Empress". Hill's <b>tardiness</b> was also cited as a contributing factor.|$|E
500|$|Historian Toby Thacker {{wrote that}} [...] "the {{attack on the}} Pilckem Ridge was {{considered}} a great success by Haig and has been similarly viewed by historians". He continues: [...] "in Haig's eyes the Welsh Division had redeemed its reputation after what he had perceived as its poor showing at Mametz Wood". Haig went on to write that the division had [...] "achieved {{the highest level of}} soldierly achievement". Historian Steven John wrote that the division [...] "regained the honour which it had unjustly lost after their supposed <b>tardiness</b> in the capture of Mametz".|$|E
500|$|The {{lyrics to}} [...] "Blue Jay Way" [...] relate entirely to Harrison's {{situation}} {{on that first}} night in Los Angeles. He refers to fighting off sleep and recalls his advice to Taylor to ask a policeman for directions to Blue Jay Way. Author Jonathan Gould views the song as [...] "darkly funny", with the singer's concern over his friends' <b>tardiness</b> almost resembling [...] "a metaphysical crisis". In the choruses, Harrison repeatedly urges [...] "Please don't be long / Please don't you be very long", a refrain that Inglis identifies as central to the composition's [...] "extraordinary sense of yearning and melancholy".|$|E
500|$|A {{meeting was}} {{organised}} {{for the next}} day, 9 November: the chaotic parley led nowhere, with the nationalists once again taking turns to make long, irrelevant speeches while the Rhodesians attempted to have Richard return the subject to the new constitution. Smith, who had earlier supported Richard as mediator {{in the face of}} the nationalists' criticism, became very frustrated by Richard's refusal to be firm with the PF and restore order to the proceedings. Unproductive discussions continued for another month, with Mugabe persistently arriving late to the meetings. When Rhodesian minister PK van der Byl confronted Mugabe about his <b>tardiness</b> and tersely demanded an apology, the ZANU leader became enraged and screamed, [...] "Foul-mouthed bloody fool!" ...|$|E
500|$|The duo {{split up}} afterward, as Jeff began a storyline with The Undertaker, while Matt was relegated to working on Heat. In the storyline, Matt then {{attacked}} Jeff, because Jeff had {{a match for}} the Intercontinental Championship. Matt was then moved to the SmackDown! brand, where he dubbed himself [...] "Matt Hardy Version 1" [...] and the [...] "Sensei of Mattitude", and picked up real-life friend Shannon Moore and briefly Crash Holly as followers. He later won the Cruiserweight Championship from Billy Kidman at the No Way Out pay-per-view in 2003. Jeff was released from WWE on April 22, 2003, for erratic behavior, drug use, refusal to go to rehab, and deteriorating ring performance, as well as constant <b>tardiness</b> and no-showing events.|$|E
500|$|As the {{prominence}} {{of the issue of}} Rhodesia increased in the late 1970s, attention on Van der Byl increased. Reporters noted his impressively quotable lines at press conferences (such as his explanation for why the Rhodesian government did not usually give the names of guerrillas which it had hanged: [...] "Why should we? Anyway, it's academic because they're normally dead after it"). While negotiating with the Patriotic Front put together by ZANU and ZAPU at the Geneva Conference in November 1976, he described ZANU leader Robert Mugabe as [...] "this bloodthirsty Marxist puppet" [...] and the Patriotic Front proposals as [...] "almost a parody, a music hall caricature of communist invective". [...] Mugabe repeatedly arrived late to the meetings held during the conference, and on one occasion Van der Byl tersely reprimanded the ZANU leader for his <b>tardiness.</b> Mugabe flew into a rage and shouted across the table at Van der Byl, calling the Rhodesian minister a [...] "foul-mouthed bloody fool!" ...|$|E
500|$|In January 2003, Hardy briefly {{turned into}} a heel (villain) after he {{attacked}} Van Dam and Shawn Michaels. It ended a month later when he saved Stacy Keibler from an attack by then-villain, Christian. In February, he had a brief program with Michaels, which saw the two team up. Then, in storyline, Hardy began dating Trish Stratus after saving her from Steven Richards and Victoria in March. Hardy and Stratus had a brief on-screen relationship that saw the duo talking backstage and teaming together in matches. Hardy competed in his final match (his first departure) against The Rock and lost. Hardy was released from WWE on April 22, 2003. The reasons given for the release were Hardy's erratic behavior, drug use, refusal to go to rehab, deteriorating ring performance, as well as constant <b>tardiness</b> and no-showing events. Hardy also cites [...] "burn out" [...] {{and the need for}} time off as reasons for leaving WWE.|$|E
500|$|As {{the general}} {{election}} got underway, the largest hurdle for the campaign was finances. Polling numbers showed Humphrey trailing Nixon, causing donations to decrease. President Johnson refused to {{use the power of}} his office to help raise money, although many speculated that the <b>tardiness</b> of the Convention, scheduled to coincide with Johnson's birthday, contributed to the issue. To stay afloat, several loans were made, which eventually accounted for half of the $11.6 million used by Humphrey throughout {{the general election}}. Campaign workers decided that no money would be spent on radio or television advertising until the final three weeks of the election. In September, President Johnson showed his support for Humphrey by giving what was described as the strongest endorsement of the campaign when he asked Texas Democrats to throw their support behind the Vice President. However, Johnson did not give his official endorsement until an October 10 radio address. Meanwhile, Humphrey campaigned in New York where he labeled Nixon a [...] "Hawk," [...] stating that the former Vice President [...] "wanted to go to war (in Vietnam) in 1954." [...] At a later stop in Buffalo, Humphrey was met by protesters.|$|E
500|$|The {{drafting}} of Wheatley had been hotly contested. [...] Some Giant draft war-room personnel {{had wanted to}} select Korey Stringer and others {{had an interest in}} Rashaan Salaam when the Giants' selection came. [...] After Wheatley was selected with the seventeenth pick, running backs Napoleon Kaufman, James Stewart and Rashaan Salaam were chosen with the eighteenth, nineteenth and twenty-first selections, respectively. Reeves made it no secret that he would have selected Salaam over Wheatley in the draft. [...] Wheatley's introduction to the Giants was a contract squabble that kept him from getting to training camp on time. [...] Then, in rookie season training camp, he had the misfortune of pulling a hamstring while running sprints on the first day. [...] Speculation had been that the injury had occurred in a stumble in a June track meet. [...] Reeves held the prompt injury against the running back he never wanted. [...] Wheatley later fell asleep in a meeting which drew a fine from Reeves. [...] Although he only actually fell asleep in one meeting, he also had mental concentration issues in practice. [...] He was not known for living erratically so his falling asleep and loss of concentration was enough of a problem that the Giants had Wheatley evaluated. [...] On top of this, Wheatley was fined several times for <b>tardiness</b> to team meetings.|$|E
500|$|The weather cleared on {{the morning}} of 1 June, and both fleets were drawn up line ahead, sailing in the same direction, Gibraltar in the centre, {{immediately}} before Hood's flagship, the first-rate [...] and behind the 74-gun [...] At around 08:15 the order was given for each ship to bear down upon and engage her opposite number. Gibraltar was one of three ships Howe signalled to put on more sail. The <b>tardiness</b> of Gibraltar and the 74-gun , {{on the other side of}} Queen Charlotte, meant that Howe found himself battling one 120-gun and two 80-gun ships simultaneously. Gibraltar was, however, able to stop a fourth enemy ship, the first-rate Républicain, from joining in, by bringing down her main and mizzen masts from a distance. By the end of the action, six French ships had been captured and another sunk. The remainder escaped. In the three engagements, it was estimated that French casualties were between 3,000 and 7,000 dead and wounded, while British losses were recorded as 290 dead and 858 wounded. Having been kept to windward for most of the battle, casualties aboard Gibraltar were light: two killed and 12 wounded. After spending two days making repairs, the British fleet sailed for home with its prizes, having failed to stop the grain convoy that arrived in Brest on 12June.|$|E
500|$|In July 1965, on Nashville's Channel 5 Night Train, Hendrix {{made his}} first {{television}} appearance. Performing in Little Richard's ensemble band, he backed up vocalists Buddy and Stacy on [...] "Shotgun". The video recording of the show marks the earliest known footage of Hendrix performing. Richard and Hendrix often clashed over <b>tardiness,</b> wardrobe, and Hendrix's stage antics, and in late July, Richard's brother Robert fired him. He then briefly rejoined the Isley Brothers, and recorded a second single with them, [...] "Move Over and Let Me Dance" [...] backed with [...] "Have You Ever Been Disappointed". Later that year, he joined a New York-based R band, Curtis Knight and the Squires, after meeting Knight {{in the lobby of}} a hotel where both men were staying. Hendrix performed with them for eight months. In October 1965, he and Knight recorded the single, [...] "How Would You Feel" [...] backed with [...] "Welcome Home" [...] and on October 15, Hendrix signed a three-year recording contract with entrepreneur Ed Chalpin. While the relationship with Chalpin was short-lived, his contract remained in force, which later caused legal and career problems for Hendrix. During his time with Knight, Hendrix briefly toured with Joey Dee and the Starliters, and worked with King Curtis on several recordings including Ray Sharpe's two-part single, [...] "Help Me". Hendrix earned his first composer credits for two instrumentals, [...] "Hornets Nest" [...] and [...] "Knock Yourself Out", released as a Curtis Knight and the Squires single in 1966.|$|E
500|$|UGO.com {{described}} Kim as a [...] "cheery and upbeat" [...] {{character who}} [...] "settles for {{nothing less than}} excellence". Described as a [...] "goody-goody," [...] Kim is also a perfectionist. Despite her high school popularity – the character {{is the most popular}} girl at Middleton High School, along with Bonnie Rockwaller – Kim is not stuck up and remains very much devoted to her academics, being a straight-A student. However, her reputation as [...] "a brainiac" [...] does not harm her popularity. The character's intellect counters negative stereotypes commonly associated with cheerleaders; she often incorporates her cheerleading routines into battle.< Meanwhile Bonnie, who is described as [...] "Kim's polar opposite", is depicted as [...] "a typical cheerleader", reflecting what Kim [...] "could have become". A running gag, Bonnie constantly complains about Kim's <b>tardiness</b> for cheerleading practice due to her tasking job. Described by Tracey McLoone of PopMatters as [...] "clever, as well as graceful and physically fit", the character also disproves the belief that brawn is superior to brains in battle. However, Kim is not a tomboy, and exhibits personality traits and interests typically associated with teenage girls, including shopping and fangirling over popular trends. Flawed, the character also has a tendency to come off as judgmental, jealous and overly competitive at times. Her best female friend Monique represents [...] "Kim’s bridge between the world of super-spy, superhero action, and the world of high school, and stuff teen girls care about", keeping the character [...] "grounded". Despite her confidence as a young woman, Kim remains very much concerned about her love life, which is sometimes treated as one of her weaknesses. Mike McDaniel of the Houston Chronicle joked that [...] "Nothing's impossible with Kim Possible -- except maybe landing a date." [...] Feminist Fairytales observed that Kim [...] "contain a ide range of differences in one person". Much of the character's dialogue consists of [...] "not-so-typical teen slang" [...] including [...] "So not the drama" [...] and [...] "No big", as well as her signature catchphrase [...] "What's the sitch?".|$|E
500|$|The {{month of}} March kicked off with charges {{from the media}} that McCarthy's {{campaign}} was just dragging along. Cited was his <b>tardiness</b> to the Senate floor, which failed to prevent a Southern filibuster against a civil rights bill drafted by fellow Minnesota Senator Walter Mondale. Despite the setback, three precincts in Minnesota elected McCarthy supported delegates to caucuses, {{to the detriment of}} Vice-President Hubert Humphrey, and President Johnson decided to abandon Massachusetts, giving 72 delegates to McCarthy. He described the news as [...] "encouraging." [...] At this point, McCarthy had spent a large amount of time campaigning in New Hampshire, hoping to improve his standing before the state's critical primary. Meanwhile, President Johnson's campaign circulated the slogan that [...] "the communists in Vietnam are watching the New Hampshire primary...don't vote for fuzzy thinking and surrender." [...] McCarthy likened this statement to McCarthyism, a reference to Senator Joe McCarthy of Wisconsin. [...] Opinion polls prior to the New Hampshire primary showed that McCarthy's support stood at only 10 to 20 percent. Although he did not win the contest, he stunned spectators of the race by winning a surprising 42.2 percent of the vote to Johnson's 49.4 percent. Media outlets described the results as a [...] "moral victory" [...] for McCarthy, [...] and influenced Robert Kennedy's decision to enter the race on March 16. [...] Kennedy's announcement did not affect McCarthy's campaign. He remained committed to the [...] "young people" [...] who had supported his campaign all along, and remarked that he was [...] "better qualified to run for the presidency" [...] than Kennedy. McCarthy set his sights on Wisconsin and began to prepare for the state's April primary. He ran advertisements in newspapers throughout the state and included his platform. In it, he called for [...] "more federal aid for education," [...] collective bargaining rights for farmers, [...] "a guaranteed minimum livable income for all Americans," [...] the construction of [...] "at least one million new housing units each year, and more [...] "federal funds to stop pollution." [...] While in Wisconsin, he criticized the government of South Vietnam, saying that it would be [...] "too kind" [...] to label the entity as corrupt and a dictatorship. He then announced his intentions to enter the primaries in Indiana and Florida, and hoped to compete in California in the upcoming months. On March 31, President Johnson made the surprise announcement that he was dropping out of the race and would not seek to be renominated for the presidency.|$|E
