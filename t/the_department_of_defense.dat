5|$|Implementing the {{provisions}} and mandates of the Nunn-Cohen Act, however, was neither rapid nor smooth. One {{of the first}} issues to surface was appointing an ASD (SO/LIC), whose principal duties included monitorship of special operations activities and low-intensity conflict activities of <b>the</b> <b>Department</b> <b>of</b> <b>Defense.</b> The Congress even {{increased the number of}} assistant secretaries of defense from 11 to 12, but <b>the</b> <b>Department</b> <b>of</b> <b>Defense</b> still did not fill this new billet. In December 1987, the Congress directed Secretary of the Army John O. Marsh to carry out the ASD (SO/LIC) duties until a suitable replacement was approved by the Senate. Not until 18 months after the legislation passed did Ambassador Charles Whitehouse assume the duties of ASD (SO/LIC).|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to these recommendations, the NTSB also recommended that <b>the</b> <b>Department</b> <b>of</b> <b>Defense</b> restrict high-speed, low-altitude aircraft operation in civilian air corridors, consider collision avoidance technologies on military aircraft, and make military pilots aware of the FAA's radar advisory service.|$|E

5|$|In his {{new role}} Nichols clashed with the AEC {{over the issue of}} whether it or <b>the</b> <b>Department</b> <b>of</b> <b>Defense</b> should have custody of nuclear weapons. The administration's policy {{remained}} firmly in favor of AEC control. This was tested during the Berlin Blockade, when Truman ordered B-29 bombers to Europe. For a time there was talk of calling off the Operation Sandstone nuclear weapons tests, but Nichols successfully argued for their continuation. In 1950, he became Deputy Director of the Guided Missiles Division of <b>the</b> <b>Department</b> <b>of</b> <b>Defense,</b> overseeing the Nike Project. He was appointed Chief of Research and Development when it was reorganized in 1952. Nichols retired from the Army on 31 October 1953. For his services from 1948 to 1953, he was belatedly awarded a second Distinguished Service Medal in 1956.|$|E

On 31 December 1967, <b>the</b> <b>Department</b> <b>of</b> <b>Defense</b> announced that 864,000 tons of American bombs {{had been dropped}} on North Vietnam during Rolling Thunder, compared with 653,000 tons dropped during the entire Korean War and 503,000 tons in the Pacific theater during the Second World War.|$|E
5|$|In 1950, General Nichols became Deputy Director of the Guided Missiles Division of <b>the</b> <b>Department</b> <b>of</b> <b>Defense.</b> He was {{appointed}} chief {{of research and}} development when it was reorganized in 1952. In 1953, he became the general manager of the Atomic Energy Commission, where he promoted the construction of nuclear power plants. He {{played a key role in}} the proceedings brought against J. Robert Oppenheimer that resulted in Oppenheimer's security clearance being revoked. In later life, Nichols became an engineering consultant on private nuclear power plants.|$|E
5|$|In 1968, Bethe, {{along with}} IBM {{physicist}} Richard Garwin, {{published an article}} criticising in detail the anti-ICBM defense system proposed by <b>the</b> <b>Department</b> <b>of</b> <b>Defense.</b> The two physicists described in the article that nearly any measure taken by the US would be easily thwarted with the deployment of relatively simple decoys. Bethe {{was one of the}} primary voices in the scientific community behind the signing of the 1963 Partial Test Ban Treaty prohibiting further atmospheric testing of nuclear weapons.|$|E

5|$|In 1969 Brookley Air Force Base {{was closed}} by <b>the</b> <b>Department</b> <b>of</b> <b>Defense,</b> dealing Mobile's economy a severe blow. The closing {{resulted}} in a 10% unemployment rate in the city. This and other factors related to industrial restructuring ushered {{in a period of}} economic depression that lasted through the 1970s. The loss of jobs created numerous problems and resulted in loss of population as residents moved away for work.|$|E
5|$|In {{subsequent}} years under Cheney, the proposed and adopted budgets followed patterns {{similar to that}} of 1990. Early in 1991, he unveiled a plan to reduce military strength by the mid-1990s to 1.6 million, compared with 2.2 million when he entered office. Cheney's 1993 defense budget was reduced from 1992, omitting programs that Congress had directed <b>the</b> <b>Department</b> <b>of</b> <b>Defense</b> to buy weapons that it did not want, and omitting unrequested reserve forces.|$|E
5|$|Mulder {{meets with}} Deep Throat, who {{explains}} that the COS is an artificial intelligence developed by Wilczek, and that <b>the</b> <b>Department</b> <b>of</b> <b>Defense</b> is trying to acquire it.

Scully doesn't accept Mulder's belief that the COS is sentient, but later discovers the machine hacking into her computer. She joins Mulder at the Eurisko Building to help him destroy the machine.|$|E

5|$|Nevertheless, {{pleased by}} the findings, the Eisenhower {{administration}} proposed negotiations on a permanent test ban and announced it would self-impose a year-long testing moratorium if Britain and the Soviet Union did the same. This decision amounted to a victory for John Foster Dulles, Allen Dulles (then the Director of Central Intelligence), and PSAC, who had argued within the Eisenhower administration for separating a test ban from larger disarmament efforts, and a defeat for <b>the</b> <b>Department</b> <b>of</b> <b>Defense</b> and AEC, which had argued to the contrary.|$|E
5|$|On May 28 and 29 of 1959 (exactly {{one year}} after the Zürich ALGOL 58 meeting), a meeting was held at the Pentagon to discuss the {{creation}} of a common programming language for business. It was attended by 41 people and was chaired by Phillips. <b>The</b> <b>Department</b> <b>of</b> <b>Defense</b> was concerned about whether it could run the same data processing programs on different computers. FORTRAN, the only mainstream language at the time, lacked the features needed to write such programs.|$|E
