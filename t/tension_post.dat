40|$|AbstractThe aim of {{this paper}} is to study the effect of <b>post</b> <b>tensioned</b> cables on {{strengthening}} steel frames and improving their load carrying capacity, giving more resistance against the external load (dead plus live or wind load). Different types of frames are analyzed: simple frame, double bay frame and double story frame. The analysis and the results are obtained using ANSYS finite element (FE) program. Different techniques were used to apply <b>post</b> <b>tensioning</b> to steel frame. Comparisons are made between these techniques to determine which technique is better in strengthening each type of frame. The results show that using <b>post</b> <b>tensioned</b> cables increases significantly the load capacity of the steel frame...|$|R
50|$|The {{reinforced}} concrete structure of Magasház was built using Yugoslavian IMS <b>post</b> <b>tensioning</b> technology.|$|R
50|$|This {{technology}} {{was used to}} create residential and public buildings in Hungary since the early 1970s. The idea behind IMS was constructing premade floor slabs and columns, connecting them afterwards. The gaps between elements were filled with a sealant called PU paste. This filling material however, was known to cause chloride corrosion over time, damaging the beams and in Yugoslavia, they used an inhibitor material and also separated the paste from the <b>tensioned</b> <b>posts</b> with a 1mm thin plastic sheet but in Hungary, they skipped these despite {{only a very small}} amount of inhibitor would've been necessary. Because of this, the building became unstable, and the inhabitants had to move out by the year 1989.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the experimental tests on cyclic behaviour {{of the base}} plate connections that {{are connected to the}} foundation with and without fully <b>post</b> <b>tensioned</b> anchor rods. The main aim is to evaluate these connections that are designed with available design procedures from the low damage aspect. Also, the effect of <b>post</b> <b>tensioning</b> on the seismic performance of this type of connection is presented. To characterize the base plate connection damageability, each column base was designed for a particular major inelastic deformation mode such as anchor rod yielding, yielding of the column, or column and base plate yielding. It is shown that considered joints are not able to be categorized as “a low damage”. Also, <b>post</b> <b>tensioning</b> of the base plate increases the rotational stiffness of the base, and results in more ductility of the column with low axial forc...|$|R

40|$|Precast {{concrete}} bridge deck panels {{have been used}} for decades to accelerate bridge construction. Cracking of the transverse connection between panels is a common problem that can damage deck overlays and cause connection leaking leading to corrosion of lower bridge elements. To better understand the behavior of bridge deck transverse female-to-female connections, shear and moment lab testing were performed at Utah State University for the Utah Department of Transportation. Two existing UDOT connections were tested, a welded stud connection and a <b>post</b> <b>tensioned</b> connection. A variation of the welded connection using rebar was also tested. In addition, two new curved bolt connections were tested as a new method of <b>post</b> <b>tensioning</b> a connection. The manner of connection cracking and associated cracking loads were recorded along with the ultimate connection capacities. The connections were also tested in a low cycle, high amplitude cyclical shear test. Lab testing showed that the welded stud connection had the lowest moment capacity. It also showed that the welded rebar connection had significantly higher strength than the welded stud connection with higher cracking and ultimate loads. Curved bolts were also shown to {{be a good way to}} <b>post</b> <b>tension</b> a connection with similar moment capacities as the <b>post</b> <b>tensioned</b> connection. Longer curved bolts were found to perform better than shorter curved bolts...|$|R
40|$|In recent years, the {{important}} of the maintenance, rehabilitation, and strengthening of reinforced concrete bridges has increased due to various factors including increase in traffic volume and weight, structural aging {{and exposure to}} adverse environmental conditions. External <b>post</b> <b>tensioning</b> is a suitable technique for rehabilitation or strengthening of concrete bridges. While external <b>post</b> <b>tensioning</b> have been effectively used for the flexural strengthening of existing bridges, recent experimental investigations {{have shown that the}} efficiency of the shear strengthening using external <b>post</b> <b>tensioning</b> is significantly reduced by the existing shear cracks. The effect of the existing shear cracks is a complex function depending on a number of parameters including width of the cracks, crack inclination, shear reinforcement ratio and concrete strength. In order to analytically investigate the effect of such shear cracks in externally post-tensioned bridge members, numerical analysis was carried out using ABAQUS software. This paper focuses on a simply supported reinforced concrete girder strengthened by external tendons with existing shear cracks. The accuracy of this type of analytical modelling is verified by comparing with the experimental results conducted on similar reinforced concrete girders...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{deals with}} the results of an {{experimental}} campaign carried out on a <b>post</b> <b>tensioned</b> concrete beam with the aim of investigating the possibility to detect early warning signs of deterioration based on static and/or dynamic tests. The beam was tested in several configurations aimed to reproduce 5 different phases of the ‘life’ of the beam: in the original undamaged state, under increasing loss of <b>tension</b> in the <b>post</b> <b>tensioning</b> cables, during and after the formation of cracks at mid span, after a strengthening intervention carried out by means of a second tension cable, during and after the formation of further cracks on the strengthened beam. Responses of the beam were measured by an extensive set of instruments consisting of accelerometers, inclinometers, displacement transducers, strain gauges and optical fibers. In this paper data from accelerometers and displacement transducers have been exploited. The paper presents the test program and the dynamic characterization of the beam in the different damage scenarios in terms of the first modal frequency, identified from dynamic tests and of the bending stiffness monitored during static tests...|$|R

40|$|The {{frequent}} use of precast concrete panels {{has been used to}} decrease the construction time for bridges. Cracking often occurs at the transverse connections of these panels, resulting in corrosion, and decreased bridge life. Previous laboratory testing of these connections was performed at Utah State University for the Utah Department of Transportation to determine maximum shear and moment capacities, cracking behavior, and cracking loads for five different connections. Two connections are Utah Department of Transportation standard connections. These connections are <b>post</b> <b>tensioned</b> and welded tie connection using shear studs. A different type of welded tie connection using rebar was also tested, along with two prototype connections using a curved bolt to apply <b>post</b> <b>tensioning.</b> As part of this research finite element models were created using ANSYS software to confirm the tested results, and provide models for future analysis. Moment-deflection and shear force-deflection curves were created using the results from the laboratory testing, and were compared with the results from the finite element analysis. The finite element models produced similar behavior and cracking loads when compared to the laboratory results.

Now <b>post</b> <b>tensioning</b> is most widely accepted all over since trusses consume a lot of less material compared to beams to span the same length and transfer moderate to heavy loads.

40|$|Paper {{presented}} at the 31 st Annual Southern African Transport Conference 9 - 12 July 2012 "Getting Southern Africa to Work", CSIR International Convention Centre, Pretoria, South Africa. Industrial flooring is moving towards jointless applications. The conventional method of jointed slabs is based on controlling stresses by dividing the slab into smaller segments. This method does not, however, allow for long term performance predictions of joints. As the focus is moving towards long term cost effectiveness, innovative solutions must be found to meet these requirements. <b>Post</b> <b>tensioned</b> slab on ground is one such a solution. The advantage of a <b>post</b> <b>tensioned</b> floor is that it increases structural capacity, reduces cracks and can eliminate up to 95 per cent of joints.
