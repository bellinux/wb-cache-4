50|$|<b>Taxation</b> <b>of</b> <b>costs,</b> {{now known}} as Detailed Assessment in English law {{following}} the Civil Procedure Act 1998, is a ministerial function performed by a court upon the resolution of case. It involves entering the various costs and their amounts against the party (either the Claimant or Defendant) against whom those costs have been awarded by the court. The itemisation of costs or the subsequent determination of the costs that should be allowed is not a determination {{of the outcome of}} the litigation.|$|E
5000|$|For {{more complex}} cases a process, {{formerly}} called a <b>taxation</b> <b>of</b> <b>costs,</b> {{now known as}} detailed assessment, is used. It is unrelated to [...] "tax" [...] {{in the sense of}} a method of raising government revenue. The successful party must file with the court (unless the other party fails to respond to the notice of assessment) a detailed breakdown of the costs and disbursements incurred, known as a bill of costs which sets out the successful party's claim. The bill is usually prepared by a law costs draftsman, whose skill is often as essential to successful recovery of costs as the skill of a solicitor or barrister is essential to success on the principal issues of the litigation. An officer of the court, Costs Judge or District Judge will then assess the reasonableness of the costs (unless the potential paying party failed to respond to the notice of assessment) with reference to a statutory schedule of limits of entitlements of costs, together with legal precedents, unless the costs can be agreed between the parties. The level of reduction can mean that the bill is reduced in some instances substantially, but in most cases at least 80% of the costs originally sought will be allowed. A court order for costs is enforceable as a debt against the unsuccessful party.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{investigate}} the effect of privatization in a mixed duopoly, where a private firm competes in quantities with a welfare-maximizing public firm. We consider two inefficiencies of the public sector: a possible cost inefficiency, and an alloca-tive inefficiency due to the distortionary effect <b>of</b> <b>taxation</b> (shadow <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> public funds). Furthermore, we analyze the effect of privatization on the timing of competition by endog-enizing the determination of simultaneous (Nash-Cournot) versus sequential (Stackelberg) games using the model developed by Hamilton and Slutsky (1990). The latter is especially relevant for the analysis of privatization, given that results and policy prescription emerged in the literature crucially rely on the type of competition assumed. We show that priva-tization has generally the effect of shifting from Stackelberg to Cournot equilibrium and that, absent efficiency gains privatization never increases welfare.

We have assessed the effects of a shift <b>of</b> <b>taxation</b> from taxing labour to <b>taxation</b> <b>of</b> external <b>costs</b> caused in the energy sector. Several examples give results compatible with the hypothesis that the changing price relation between labour and energy resulting from such a tax shift will make re-use, repairs and recycling increasingly competitive and thus tend to decrease mining as well as waste production. Likewise, less energy-intensive commodities and services in general would become increasingly competitive, and would tend to decrease the environmental load further. These environmentally desirable effects are beyond the taxed external effects of the energy sector itself and occur as an indirect effect of the increased relative price of energy...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{explores the}} {{implications}} of informational asymmetries between domestic and foreign investors for optimal capital tax rates and welfare. It adopts a model in which asymmetric information implies a home bias in equity. The paper finds that asymmetric information may raise capital tax rates by reducing the marginal <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> <b>taxation.</b> Furthermore, it shows that investors may gain from informational asymmetries. Although asymmetric information increases the uncertainty as perceived by investors, it may also increase tax rates and allow for a higher consumption of public goods. This reflects that asymmetric information may reduce the distortionary effects of competition among governments.

In particular, important disruption of the environment from both production and consumption threatens even {{the survival of the}} world. In the absence of adequate environmental protection, the situation is made worse by the continuing rapid economic growth in many countries. Economists typically prescribe the <b>taxation</b> <b>of</b> external <b>costs</b> including environmental disruption. A Pigovian tax is levied on an external cost in accordance to the damage it imposes. However, Coase questions the validity of this traditional Pigovian policy. Coase correctly emphasizes the reciprocal nature of an external effect, i. e. while the external effect adversely affects the damaged party (the society for the case of environmental disruption), inducing or forcing the disrupters to reduce the effect also imposes a cost on them. However, he ignores an important asymmetry.

[...] He discusses the 1983 Social Security amendments that followed the Greenspan Commission's recommendations.

In order to reduce the measurement error <b>of</b> the user <b>cost,</b> tax asymmetries are carefully taken into account by using the Shevlin-Graham methodology to proxy the marginal tax rate. The econometric analysis shows that the user cost (and hence taxes) is a relevant determinant of investment behavior (with an estimated elasticity of investment with respect to the user <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> capital which ranges from - 0. 199 to - 0. 217).

40|$|In {{this paper}} we analyze {{the impact on}} the demand of capital and labour of changes in their {{relative}} costs, using micro data. We especially highlight the role <b>of</b> the user <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> capital, for which we propose an original measure based on the <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> debt and the <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> equity. We hence take advantage of changes in the <b>taxation</b> <b>of</b> capital to build instrument variables and to estimate a complete system of factor demands. First we find that the elasticity of substitution between capital and labour is relatively weak in the non manufacturing sector, about 0, 4, whereas this parameter range from 0. 6 to 0, 8 in the manufacturing sector. Secondly, we show that the price elasticity of the demand for goods is quite high, and is almost equal to 2 in both industries. Thirdly and probably the most interesting result, we find a significant and direct relationship between the user <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> capital and the stock of capital, which does not appear in most former studies on French data. In a standard model of factor demand, our results mean that the wealth effect dominates the substitution effect. As a result, lowering the user <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> capital would lead, at partial equilibrium, to increase not only investment but also the employment level and output. <b>Taxation,</b> user <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> capital, factor demand, firm data...|$|R

The model considers {{the situation of}} a typical tourist destination country that is using casinos to attract and entertain foreign tourists. The objective is {{to invest in the}} sector efficiently while maximizing the amount of government revenue or profits accruing to the country. The regulator must determine how the price of gambling will be set, how many casinos will be allowed to enter the industry and the form and rates <b>of</b> <b>taxation.</b> Four alternative forms of regulation are considered: price regulation, state-owned monopoly, private monopoly and casino association regulation. Turnover taxes on the amount of funds gambled and also annual <b>taxation</b> <b>of</b> the fixed <b>costs</b> <b>of</b> the casinos are evaluated. Applications of the models are carried out for North Cyprus. The conclusion is that the economic efficiency costs and the revenue losses from the absence of effective regulation in these tourist destinations can be very substantial with welfare costs equal to the approximately 75 percent of the tax revenue generated by this sector. Furthermore it shows that while a tax on turnover can be efficient {{in the case of a}} competitive industry or a cartel association form of regulation, it will be distortionary if a multi-plant private monopoly is controlling the sector. In contrast a tax on fixed costs will lead to an efficient result in the case of a competitive industry, but it will lead to economic inefficiencies if the sector is regulated by a casino association that controls the number of casino entering the sector.

40|$|More {{recently}} {{researchers have}} turned to analyze how the tax structure, rather than the overall tax level, affects economic performance. For instance, several papers have investigated how taxation on corporate and individual (labor) income influences growth. <b>Taxation</b> <b>of</b> dividend income may also influence growth via its impact on investments and firm behavior.
