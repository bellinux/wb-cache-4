50|$|In 1963 the GWR {{replaced}} the double needle <b>telegraph</b> <b>instruments</b> {{with a single}} needle system.|$|R
60|$|The <b>telegraph</b> <b>instrument</b> {{began to}} click just then and the agent {{turned toward him}} sharply.|$|R
60|$|The agent {{sat down}} at the <b>telegraph</b> <b>instrument,</b> and looked up when it rapped out an answer to his message.|$|R
6000|$|Five minutes {{afterwards}} Margaret Raleigh and Roland Clewe, sitting {{close together}} by the <b>telegraph</b> <b>instrument</b> in the Works at Sardis, received the following message: ...|$|R
60|$|It took but {{a moment}} to loosen this and raise the cover, when, to my utter astonishment, I {{discovered}} an ordinary <b>telegraph</b> <b>instrument</b> clicking away within.|$|R
60|$|The {{incident}} of {{the finding of}} that buried <b>telegraph</b> <b>instrument</b> upon the lonely Sahara is little short of uncanny, in view of your story of the adventures of David Innes.|$|R
50|$|Women {{were trained}} to use {{wireless}} <b>telegraph</b> <b>instruments</b> {{to work for the}} US government or private companies and {{to take the place of}} male wireless operators who had gone to war.|$|R

60|$|She {{entered the}} empty waiting-room. An oil-lamp gave out a thick yellow light. The ticket window was open, {{and through it}} she saw there was neither agent nor {{operator}} in the little compartment. A <b>telegraph</b> <b>instrument</b> clicked faintly.|$|R
6000|$|... "I do {{not agree}} with you, Mr. Lind. You do not read human nature as I do. You know that I am an expert. I see men as he sees a <b>telegraph</b> <b>instrument,</b> quite uninfluenced by {{personal}} feeling." ...|$|R
5|$|The GWR's Telegraph Superintendent (1855–1892) {{patented}} the Disc Block <b>Telegraph</b> <b>Instrument</b> {{that was}} used to safely control the dispatch of trains. First used on the Metropolitan Railway in 1863 and the Bristol and South Wales Union Railway in 1864, it was later used on many other lines operated by the company.|$|R
6000|$|... "You see, mother," [...] he {{said that}} night, after Aspel had left the cottage and May had gone to her room, [...] "it will never do to let her kill herself over the <b>telegraph</b> <b>instrument.</b> She's too delicately formed for such work. We must find {{something}} better suited to her." ...|$|R

50|$|The show {{featured}} the displays of 196 commercial exhibitors and 1,500 exhibits, including a historical exhibit that featured devices used by Benjamin Franklin {{and the first}} Morse <b>telegraph</b> <b>instrument.</b> The novel application of electricity to the running of a railroad train, printing presses, sewing machines was demonstrated, as was an electrical searchlight, which had never been seen before.|$|R
60|$|Duane reached Bradford before dawn. He {{dismounted}} {{some distance}} from the tracks, tied his horse, and then crossed over to the station. He heard the clicking of the <b>telegraph</b> <b>instrument,</b> and it thrilled him. An operator sat inside reading. When Duane tapped on the window he looked up with startled glance, then went swiftly to unlock the door.|$|R

6000|$|Off {{went the}} message, and Paula retired {{into the next}} room, leaving the door open between that and {{the one she had}} just quitted. Here she busied herself with writing some letters, till {{in less than an hour}} the <b>telegraph</b> <b>instrument</b> showed signs of life, and she hastened back to its side. The reply {{received}} from the agent was as follows:-- ...|$|R
60|$|It was {{the very}} spot at which I first had seen David Innes. If he had ever raised a cairn above the <b>telegraph</b> <b>instrument</b> no sign of it {{remained}} now. Had {{it not been for}} the chance that caused Cogdon Nestor to throw down his sleeping rug directly over the hidden instrument, it might still be clicking there unheard--and this story still unwritten.|$|R

6000|$|... "Cables, of course," [...] {{answered}} Robin, [...] "why, Madge, I {{have done}} with land-telegraphs now. There's nothing more to learn about them. Cousin Sam has put me up to everything, you know. Besides, there's no mystery about land-lines. Why, you've only got to stick up a lot o' posts with insulators screwed to 'em, fix wires to the insulators, clap on an electric battery and a <b>telegraph</b> <b>instrument,</b> and fire away." ...|$|R

50|$|The Hilda Lindley House {{was built}} by the Army {{at a cost of}} about $22,000. The two-story structure, {{standing}} on a hill about 87 feet above mean low tide and approximately a half-mile back from the beach, contained two <b>instrument</b> <b>rooms</b> on the ground floor and another <b>instrument</b> <b>room</b> on the second floor, where soldiers used azimuth telescopes to look for enemy shipping on Block Island Sound. The soldiers looked through the fire control station’s characteristic mullioned observation slots — long, narrow windows with vertical supports.|$|R
50|$|The first {{railroad}} station was a manure spreader {{on the south}} side of the track equipped with the necessary wiring and <b>telegraph</b> <b>instruments</b> for receiving and sending messages on the movement of trains. A new station was built in 1887. Frank Lacy was the first agent but was a telegraph operator only. There were no tickets for sale and passengers paid their fares on the train. The station was enlarged in 1926.|$|R
50|$|The station {{opened with}} the line, {{and was a}} signal box and block post, using the <b>telegraph</b> <b>{{instruments}}</b> by 1879, with Winters instruments provided by 1890. A six lever frame was provided in 1927, for control of signals, until closed as a block post in 1993. The station was renamed Riddell in 1904, {{as part of a}} policy to adopt short station names, but was renamed to the full version in October 1976.|$|R

6000|$|Thus, {{between the}} hours devoted to architecture, {{he passed the}} next three days. One morning he set himself, by the help of John, to {{practise}} on the <b>telegraph</b> <b>instrument,</b> expecting a message. But though he watched the machine at every opportunity, or kept some other person on the alert in its neighbourhood, no message arrived to gratify him till after the lapse of nearly a fortnight. Then she spoke from her new habitation nine hundred miles away, in these meagre words:-- ...|$|R
6000|$|... "The two <b>telegraph</b> <b>instruments</b> {{communicating}} with India and America, which stood on two tables, side by side, in Mr Pender's house, were supplied by two batteries {{in the basement}} of the building. Eighty cells of Daniel's battery were used upon the Penzance circuit for India, and 100 cells on the Brest circuit for America. The ordinary water-pipes of the house served to connect the batteries with the earth, so as to enable them to pump their electricity from that inexhaustible reservoir." ...|$|R

60|$|Hetty was {{off like}} a flash. During her absence an intense silence pervaded the office, broken only by an {{occasional}} hiccough from one of Mr. Sizer's guests. Patsy was paralyzed with horror and had fallen back into her chair to glare alternately at Bob West and the big bully who threatened her cousin's husband. Arthur was pale and stern as he fixed a reproachful gaze on the hardware merchant. From Miss Briggs' little room could be heard the steady click-click of the <b>telegraph</b> <b>instrument.</b>|$|R

A copy of this engraving hangs in the Teylers <b>Instrument</b> <b>room</b> near the large electrostatic generator.|$|R
