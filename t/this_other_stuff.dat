He talked {{with an air of}} being extremely lucid about the [...] "ether" [...] and [...] "tubes of force," [...] and [...] "gravitational potential," [...] and things like that, and I sat in my other folding-chair and said, [...] "Yes," [...] "Go on," [...] "I follow you," [...] to keep him going. It was tremendously difficult stuff, but I do not think he ever suspected how much I did not understand him. There were moments when I doubted whether I was well employed, but at any rate I was resting from that confounded play. Now and then things gleamed on me clearly for a space, only to vanish just when I thought I had hold of them. Sometimes my attention failed altogether, and I would give it up and sit and stare at him, wondering whether, after all, it would not be better to use him as a central figure in a good farce and let all <b>this</b> <b>other</b> <b>stuff</b> slide. And then, perhaps, I would catch on again for a bit.|$|E

We would love to retire her undefeated, but more than anything else, we want to retire her sound; she’s been so good to us.

And then a couple of good things happened very quickly, including among other things somebody decided to do it as a radio play, which wound up being the longest radio play in German radio history, and all <b>this</b> <b>other</b> <b>stuff</b> happened and the books really took off there." ...|$|E

Each man acknowledged the primary impact of the character to have been on their mutual friendship and intellectual understanding. In particular, their time developing the Anarky series led to a working relationship centered on esoteric debate, discussion, and mutual respect.|$|E

During a concert on May 24, 2010, in the Prague club, Abaton, Blythe was involved in an incident {{that resulted in the}} death of Daniel Nosek, a 19-year-old attending fan. According to eyewitness statements cited by the Czech online daily newspaper aktuálně.cz following Blythe's arrest, Blythe was chanting [...] "Come on up" [...] between songs, which, the newspaper stated, may have been intended to invite applause from the audience and not a direct invitation to fans. The newspaper went on to report that the fan tried to climb onstage and was thrown by the singer from the stage, falling backwards directly on his head. According to the same paper, Nosek was not under the influence of drugs or alcohol, suffered serious brain trauma, fell into a coma, and died weeks later from his injuries.|$|E
5000|$|Stokke {{initially}} {{tried to}} control the situation herself but after being bombarded with emails and requests for photo shoots she sought a media consultant to handle her new found fame. She gave an interview on pole vaulting technique which was uploaded to YouTube and it received over one hundred thousand views, but comments and discussion on the internet largely remained sexual and in relation to her looks. Her father, a lawyer by trade, began to review online material to identify illegal behaviour or stalkers. Reflecting on her situation, Stokke told The Washington Post [...] "even if {{none of it is}} illegal, it just all feels really demeaning. I worked so hard for pole vaulting and all <b>this</b> <b>other</b> <b>stuff,</b> and it's almost like that doesn't matter. Nobody sees that. Nobody really sees me." [...] Der Spiegel noted that Stokke had become a [...] "sex symbol against her will". The attention affected her psychologically: she said that she found the leering [...] "creepy and a little scary" [...] and now took care to lock doors behind her.|$|E

Mathis hints at the theme for this album in the liner notes for his 1993 box set The Music of Johnny Mathis: A Personal Collection, where he gives his thoughts on the 1964 Little Anthony and the Imperials song [...] "I'm on the Outside Looking In" [...] that he covered for his 1988 album Once in a While: [...] "That was group singers' kind of material. I was singing other stuff. It wasn't {{the picture of the}} lone crooner standing in the spotlight. That's what I was doing when all <b>this</b> <b>other</b> <b>stuff</b> was going on. I never listened to it until it was brought to my attention by album's producers Peter Bunetta and Rick Chudacoff." [...] Mathis chose to continue his work with Bunetta and Chudacoff on this project, which focuses on [...] "this other stuff" [...] that Mathis refers to: pop and R&B hits from the 1950s and 1960s.|$|E

40|$|The thesis {{begins by}} {{discussing}} the Modern Paradigm, which, it is argued, forms the underpinning to much contemporary management thinking. This {{in turn is}} seen as having its own foundation, the Cartesian-Newtonian Synthesis. It is argued that this does not form an adequate basis for strategic management, and the thesis then draws upon four main streams of thinking: complexity theory, fuzzy logic, the debate on power in organizations, and critical theory. The material developed from these four streams is integrated, thereby developing a number of principles for strategic management. The context within {{which most of the}} case studies are set is also outlined, by reviewing the recent history and present situation in local government. We then turn to the practical implications. When teaching strategic management and change, a frequent response from managers is that they are comfortable with the rational planning approach, which they find straightforward in approach, and its tools and techniques readily usable. But when we get on to all <b>this</b> <b>other</b> <b>stuff</b> [...] . what does it mean, and how is it used? This relates also to my own experience as a manager, particularly in local government. The practical implications are important, and this whole thesis can be seen as an action research programme, with practical interventions enriching the theoretical perspective, which in turn has fed back into practice. This discussion begins by considering methodology, and identifies three interlinked methods - action research, action learning and whole systems intervention. These are related to critical theory, and it is argued that these approaches provide a practice based upon the theoretical themes developed earlier. This is followed by a discussion of action research, exploring one case study in some depth, chosen because it helps to illustrate both the strengths and the potential limitations of a critical approach to action research. The work is assessed, and its implication for contemporary management are considered, drawing also upon a current action research project concerned with the roles of trade unions in the regions of Europe. The thesis then turns to what can best be seen as an extended action research project concerned specifically with whole systems intervention. It examines the extent to which this can be developed and undertaken {{on the basis of the}} principles developed in the thesis. Five case studies are presented in which Search Conferences and/or ColourFlow Dialogue have been used. Reflecting the original remit of the thesis, these case studies have a common link in local government. Two involve local authorities directly; one concerns local government politicians and their political party, and one involves an area of local authority activity being moved into independent Trust status. The fifth has a more tenuous link with local government: it is a voluntary body which receives significant funding from Councils, but is otherwise independent; it is included because it was the first such exercise undertaken, and brought with it significant personal learning. Finally, the thesis reviews the findings, considers their implications, and draws conclusions. Thus the purpose of this thesis is both to present an approach to strategic management and organizational development which is richer than those premised on the Modern Paradigm, and to argue that this is more than a set of interesting or provocative ideas - it is an approach which can be put into practice. </p...|$|E
