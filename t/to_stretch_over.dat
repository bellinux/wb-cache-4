500|$|... "Un-American Graffiti" [...] is {{the first}} episode of Veronica Mars not {{to be part of}} a broader story arc in the form of a mystery that Veronica solves over several episodes. The crew's plan at the {{beginning}} of the season was to have the two-part murder mystery of Hearst's basketball coach, encapsulated in [...] "Postgame Mortem" [...] and [...] "Mars, Bars", <b>to</b> <b>stretch</b> <b>over</b> the rest of the season beginning with this episode, but this idea was changed around the airing of [...] "Spit & Eggs". Series creator Rob Thomas gave two rationales for the creative change. The first was that he believed that the story arcs alienated new or casual viewers, meaning that the change would solve the series' low Nielsen ratings, while the other reason was that he noticed that after the first season, the show had garnered the most narrative criticism about the story arcs. On trying the new narrative structure, Thomas stated, [...] "It seems like a good time to do it—a good fun test balloon. Try it over five [...] and see how fans and non-fans react." [...] However, Thomas also commented that the show would continue to exhibit a degree of serialization through Veronica's romantic and personal life. In addition, the new story formula was a way to have episodes focus on Veronica's personal life instead of devoting most of the episode time to advancing rushed mysteries.|$|E

6000|$|Another {{work was}} set in hand {{during the reign of}} Charles II., namely the palace he {{designed}} to build in rivalry of Versailles. Sir Christopher Wren was the architect. The grounds were intended <b>to</b> <b>stretch</b> <b>over</b> the downs to a great distance, and on the highest point was to stand a pharos, whose light would be visible from the Solent. Fountains were to be fed from the Itchen, and a magnificent palace was actually begun, the bricks for it being dug from a clay pit at Otterbourne, which has ever since borne the name of Dell Copse, and became noted for the growth of daffodils. The king lodged at Southampton to inspect the work, and there is a tradition (derived from Dean Rennell) that being an excellent walker, he went on foot to Winchester. One of his gentlemen annoyed him by a hint to the country people as to who he was, whereupon a throng come out to stare at him, at one of the bridges. He escaped, and took his revenge by a flying leap over a broad [...] "water carriage," [...] leaving them to follow as they could.|$|E
60|$|The {{same day}} I went on board we set sail, {{standing}} {{away to the}} northward upon our own coast, with design <b>to</b> <b>stretch</b> <b>over</b> for the African coast when we came about ten or twelve degrees of northern latitude, which, it seems, was the manner of course in those days. We had very good weather, only excessively hot, all the way upon our own coast, till {{we came to the}} height of Cape St. Augustino; from whence, keeping further off at sea, we lost sight of land, and steered as if we were bound for the isle Fernando de Noronha, holding our course N.E. by N., and leaving those isles on the east. In this course we passed the line in about twelve days’ time, and were, by our last observation, in seven degrees twenty-two minutes northern latitude, when a violent tornado, or hurricane, took us quite out of our knowledge. It began from the south-east, came about to the north-west, and then settled in the north-east; from whence it blew in such a terrible manner, that for twelve days together we could do nothing but drive, and, scudding away before it, let it carry us whither fate and the fury of the winds directed; and, during these twelve days, I need not say that I expected every day to be swallowed up; nor, indeed, did any in the ship expect to save their lives.|$|E
60|$|She came inveterately, though Lyon multiplied the sittings: Amy {{was never}} {{entrusted}} to the governess or the maid. He had knocked off poor old Sir David in ten days, but {{the portrait of}} the simple-faced child bade fair <b>to</b> <b>stretch</b> <b>over</b> into the following year. He asked for sitting after sitting, {{and it would have}} struck any one who might have witnessed the affair that he was wearing the little girl out. He knew better however and Mrs. Capadose also knew: they were present together at the long intermissions he gave her, when she left her pose and roamed about the great studio, amusing herself with its curiosities, playing with the old draperies and costumes, having unlimited leave to handle. Then her mother and Mr. Lyon sat and talked; he laid aside his brushes and leaned back in his chair; he always gave her tea. What Mrs. Capadose did not know was the way that during these weeks he neglected other orders: women have no faculty of imagination with regard to a man's work beyond a vague idea that it doesn't matter. In fact Lyon put off everything and made several celebrities wait. There were half-hours of silence, when he plied his brushes, during which he was mainly conscious that Everina was sitting there. She easily fell into that if he did not insist on talking, and she was not embarrassed nor bored by it. Sometimes she took up a book--there were plenty of them about; sometimes, a little way off, in her chair, she watched his progress (though without in the least advising or correcting), as if she cared for every stroke that represented her daughter. These strokes were occasionally a little wild; he was thinking so much more of his heart than of his hand. He was not more embarrassed than she was, but he was agitated: it was as if in the sittings (for the child, too, was beautifully quiet) something was growing between them or had already grown--a tacit confidence, an inexpressible secret. He felt it that way; but after all he could not be sure that she did. What he wanted her to do for him was very little; it was not even to confess that she was unhappy. He would be superabundantly gratified if she should simply let him know, even by a silent sign, that she recognised that with him her life would have been finer. Sometimes he guessed--his presumption went so far--that he might see this sign in her contentedly sitting there.|$|E

5000|$|Although {{evidence}} is scant, it is presumed that Masuna (who {{was probably a}} Christian) ruled over a Romano-Moorish kingdom that stretched (or had ambitions <b>to</b> <b>stretch)</b> <b>over</b> {{a substantial part of}} Mauretania Caesariensis. It may have been originally a successor state to the western Roman Empire (similar to Aegidius in Gaul) that managed to maintain its independence and resist occupation by the Vandals, or it may have been carved out later when Vandal rule weakened. It is almost certain Masuna was a Berber, possibly descended from a Romano-Berber family appointed as federate commanders in Roman times, who simply continued after the Vandal invasion, or a Berber warlord who extended his rule in the chaos of Vandal times beyond the pastoralist Berber tribes (contemporaneously known as [...] "Mauri" [...] or Moors), to also cover the Romanized cities of Mauretania.|$|E

50|$|The {{need for}} {{underwater}} acoustic telemetry exists in {{applications such as}} data harvesting for environmental monitoring, communication with and between manned and unmanned underwater vehicles, transmission of diver speech, etc. A related application is underwater remote control, in which acoustic telemetry is used to remotely actuate a switch or trigger an event. A prominent example of underwater remote control are acoustic releases, devices {{that are used to}} return sea floor deployed instrument packages or other payloads to the surface per remote command {{at the end of a}} deployment. Acoustic communications form an active field of research with significant challenges to overcome, especially in horizontal, shallow-water channels. Compared with radio telecommunications, the available bandwidth is reduced by several orders of magnitude. Moreover, the low speed of sound causes multipath propagation <b>to</b> <b>stretch</b> <b>over</b> time delay intervals of tens or hundreds of milliseconds, as well as significant Doppler shifts and spreading. Often acoustic communication systems are not limited by noise, but by reverberation and time variability beyond the capability of receiver algorithms. The fidelity of underwater communication links can be greatly improved by the use of hydrophone arrays, which allow processing techniques such as adaptive beamforming and diversity combining.|$|E

5000|$|The {{original}} {{problem statement}} {{in its entirety}} is as follows:An important problem closely connected with the foregoing to Hilbert's nineteenth problem is the question concerning the existence of solutions of partial differential equations when the values on the boundary of the region are prescribed. This problem is solved in the main by the keen methods of H. A. Schwarz, C. Neumann, and Poincaré for the differential equation of the potential. These methods, however, seem to be generally not capable of direct extension to the case where along the boundary there are prescribed either the differential coefficients or any relations between these and {{the values of the}} function. Nor can they be extended immediately to the case where the inquiry is not for potential surfaces but, say, for surfaces of least area, or surfaces of constant positive gaussian curvature, which are to pass through a prescribed twisted curve or <b>to</b> <b>stretch</b> <b>over</b> a given ring surface. It is my conviction that {{it will be possible to}} prove these existence theorems by means of a general principle whose nature is indicated by Dirichlet's principle. This general principle will then perhaps enable us to approach the question: Has not every regular variation problem a solution, provided certain assumptions regarding the given boundary conditions are satisfied (say that the functions concerned in these boundary conditions are continuous and have in sections one or more derivatives), and provided also if need be that the notion of a solution shall be suitably extended? ...|$|E
