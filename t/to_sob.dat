5|$|The comedian {{has said}} that he likes playing weak characters, and {{particularly}} revealing weaknesses in high status figures. During the course of the show, he will frequently peel back the Colbert character's apparent bravado to expose a very weak inner core. In one instance, Colbert demands one of his staff members subject him to simulated waterboarding, only to break down into pleas for mercy upon hearing a water bottle cap popped. In another episode, he criticizes The Today Show cohost Matt Lauer for saying that it's unacceptable for men to cry, only <b>to</b> <b>sob</b> hysterically upon learning that Katie Couric has left the show. These status shifts occur commonly, and constitute a central component of the show's comedy.|$|E
500|$|Cooper's {{vision of}} The Giant ends, {{replaced}} by the singer and band. The old waiter walks over to Cooper and says, [...] "I'm so sorry." [...] Donna begins <b>to</b> <b>sob.</b> James comforts her, to no avail. Bobby Briggs turns from the bar, overcome by sadness as well. Cooper stares out, bewildered, as the band repeats a melancholy refrain.|$|E
500|$|Zinta's next {{release of}} 2006 was Shirish Kunder's romantic musical Jaan-E-Mann, a story {{set in the}} United States about two men, played by Salman Khan and Akshay Kumar, who love the same woman. The film opened to mixed reviews from critics and its {{eventual}} box office profit was poor. Zinta {{played the role of}} Piya, the cynosure of two men. She was mostly criticised for taking a role of minimal importance, though her performance was generally well received. Raja Sen labelled her role an [...] "ornament throughout," [...] but further stated that she [...] "comes vividly alive in the film's last scene, a moment that makes you lament why filmmakers today don't let the babyfaced actress have more fun instead of forcing her <b>to</b> <b>sob</b> copiously. She doesn't have much to do in Jaan-E-Mann, but looks appropriately attractive." [...] Zinta said that the film was a great relief after the more emotionally intense Kabhi Alvida Naa Kehna, as Jaan-E-Mann was [...] "easy, happy and much more simple".|$|E

2500|$|As a critic, Ford {{is known}} for {{remarking}} [...] "Open the book to page ninety-nine and read, {{and the quality of}} the whole will be revealed to you." [...] George Seldes, in his book Witness to a Century, describes Ford ("probably in 1932") recalling his writing collaboration with Joseph Conrad, and the lack of acknowledgment by publishers of his status as co-author. Seldes recounts Ford's disappointment with Hemingway: [...] "'and he disowns me now that he has become better known than I am.' Tears now came to Ford's eyes." [...] Ford says, [...] "I helped Joseph Conrad, I helped Hemingway. I helped a dozen, a score of writers, and many of them have beaten me. I'm now an old man and I'll die without making a name like Hemingway." [...] Seldes observes, [...] "At this climax Ford began <b>to</b> <b>sob.</b> Then he began to cry." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 1859, Sarah {{learned that}} her father had died overseas. Her mother summoned a family council, {{including}} Morny, {{to decide what to do}} with her. Morny proposed that Sarah should become an actress, an idea that horrified Sarah, as she had never been inside a theater. [...] Morny arranged for her to attend her first theater performance at the Comedie Française in a party which included her mother, Morny, and his friend Alexandre Dumas, père. The play they attended was Brittanicus, by Jean Racine, followed by the classical tragedy Amphytrion by Plautus. Sarah was so moved by the emotion of the play, she began <b>to</b> <b>sob</b> loudly, disturbing the rest of the audience. Morny and others in their party were angry at her and left, but Dumas comforted her, and later told Morny that he believed that she was destined for the stage. After the performance, Dumas called her [...] "my little star".|$|E
2500|$|Several months later, Louise de Kérouaille came to England from France, {{ostensibly to}} serve as a maid of honour to Queen Catherine, but also to become another {{mistress}} to King Charles, probably by design on both the French and English sides. She and Gwyn would prove rivals for many years to come. They were opposites in personality and mannerism; Louise a proud woman of noble birth used to the sophistication of Versailles, Nell a spirited and pranking ex-orange-wench. Gwyn nicknamed Louise [...] "Squintabella" [...] for her looks and the [...] "Weeping Willow" [...] for her tendencies <b>to</b> <b>sob.</b> In one instance, recorded in a letter from George Legge to Lord Preston, Nell characteristically jabbed at the Duchess's [...] "great lineage," [...] dressing in black at Court, the same mourning attire as Louise, when a prince of France died. [...] Someone there asked, [...] "What the deuce was the Cham of Tartary to you?" [...] to which Nell responded, [...] "Oh, exactly the same relation that the French Prince was to Mademoiselle de Kérouaille." [...] The Duchess of Portsmouth's only recorded riposte was, [...] "anybody may know she has been an orange-wench by her swearing" [...] Their relationship was not strictly adversarial; they were known to get together for tea and cards, for example. Basset was the popular game at the time, and Gwyn was a frequent — and high-stakes — gambler.|$|E

2500|$|A larger {{ceremony}} was held again on April 8 in Tlaquepaque, Jalisco, {{this time with}} Governor Sandoval Díaz and the victims' families. Over 1,000 people attended the ceremony. In his eight minute speech, Sandoval Díaz stated that the attack would not go unpunished. [...] "They {{will not be an}} extra number in our statistics," [...] he said. He also stated that the assassins were going to [...] "pay" [...] for what they did, and clarified {{that it was not a}} cry for war, but rather a cry for peace and justice. He also asked all police corporations to continue fighting organized crime. Solorio Aréchiga read the names of all the officers killed, but had to stop momentarily <b>to</b> <b>sob.</b> For each of the names, the policemen repeated the same process as before, yelling [...] "present" [...] for each of them. After that, the police band did a taps call. Once it concluded, the audience clapped for one minute. The coffins were wrapped in the Flags of Jalisco. In front of each coffin was a flower arrangement, the banner of the Fuerza Única branch, and a framed photograph of the victim. Each of the victims' family members were given an official banner of the state of Jalisco. A year later, on April 6, 2016, the Government of Jalisco hosted another ceremony near the ambush site with the victims' families. Fuerza Única banners were placed across the mountainous road where the attack occurred.|$|E
2500|$|The label {{was later}} renamed to Machine Shop after the {{involvement}} of the band members in the work. Brad Delson took over the work as an A representative of the label. The label got the breakthrough success after the release of the overnight recorded collaborative EP by Jay-Z and Linkin Park, entitled Collision Course, which was released under the collaboration of labels, Roc-A-Fella, Warner Bros. and Machine Shop. The EP was released on November 30, 2004. The EP was certified as Platinum in America. Later the label signed artists like No Warning, Simplistic and LNDN.

It was also released as a DVD which featured Chester Bennington breaking Brad Delson's guitar. At the end of the concert, Joe Hahn threw a piece of his equipment on the stage floor. On November 22, 2005, the label again marked its success on releasing the album The Rising Tied by Fort Minor which was a side project by the founder Shinoda. Under the success of the album many artists like Styles of Beyond and Holly Brook were signed in the label. Holly Brook released two independent EPs Holly Brook EP and Sony CONNECT Sets under the label, whereas Styles of Beyond indirectly released singles in which they were featured through the project of Fort Minor. The singles by Fort Minor like Petrified/Remember the Name gave success <b>to</b> <b>S.O.B.</b> and Fort Minor. The breakthrough single Where'd You Go featuring Holly Brook marked number four on the Billboard Hot 100 making it the best ever debut song by any One-Hit-Wonder. The label meanwhile was also releasing EPs for Linkin Park Underground, and in addition it also released an EP for the fan club of Fort Minor, Militia. The label also released mixtapes like [...] and Razor Tag. The signing of S.O.B. brought the group back into the spotlight and marked success. On May 23, 2006, the label released Like Blood Like Honey by Holly Brook which was her debut album, which gave her the spot of #23 of U.S. Heat charts. In 2006, the label again gained spotlight after the single Numb/Encore by Linkin Park & Jay-Z won the Grammy Award for Best Rap/Sung Collaboration. On October 10, 2005, the label released a mixtape of its own which was named as Machine Shop Mixtape. It featured Various Artists like Taproot, Papa Roach, Deftones and many others.|$|E
