5|$|Judaism reached Kerala in the 10th century BC {{during the}} time of King Solomon. <b>They</b> <b>are</b> <b>called</b> Cochin Jews or Malabar Jews and are the oldest group of Jews in India. There was a {{significant}} Jewish community which existed in Kerala until the 20th century, when most of them migrated to Israel. The Paradesi Synagogue at Kochi is the oldest synagogue in the Commonwealth. Jainism has a considerable following in the Wayanad district.|$|E
5|$|All spoken {{languages}} have phonemes of {{at least}} two different categories, vowels and consonants, that can be combined to form syllables. As well as segments such as consonants and vowels, some languages also use sound in other ways to convey meaning. Many languages, for example, use stress, pitch, duration, and tone to distinguish meaning. Because these phenomena operate outside of the level of single segments, <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>called</b> suprasegmental. Some languages have only a few phonemes, for example, Rotokas and Pirahã language with 11 and 10 phonemes respectively, whereas languages like Taa may have as many as 141 phonemes. In sign languages, the equivalent to phonemes (formerly called cheremes) are defined by the basic elements of gestures, such as hand shape, orientation, location, and motion, which correspond to manners of articulation in spoken language.|$|E

50|$|The {{ancestors}} of the Dai in Yunnan were the Dianyue (滇越) group mentioned in the Records of a Historian by Sima Qian. In Records of the Later Han Dynasty, <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>called</b> Shan, and in Records of the Local Countries in Southern China, <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>called</b> Dianpu. In the Tang Dynasty, <b>they</b> <b>were</b> mentioned as Black Teeth, and as Face-Tattooed in a book named A Survey of the Aborigines by Fan Chuo. These monikers were given based on their customs of tattooing and teeth decoration. In the Song Dynasty, <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>called</b> Baiyi Man, and in the Yuan Dynasty <b>were</b> <b>called</b> Jinchi Baiyi. Until the Ming Dynasty, <b>they</b> <b>were</b> generally <b>called</b> Baiyi and after the Qing Dynasty, <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>called</b> Baiyi. The modern Dai people {{can be traced back}} to Dianyue, a subgroup among the ancient Baiyue groups.|$|R
50|$|Automatic gas-checks {{were used}} with {{studless}} ammunition in both Woolwich and polygroove rifled guns. <b>They</b> <b>were</b> {{otherwise known as}} “Rotating Gas-Checks” or “EOC Gas-Checks”. <b>They</b> <b>were</b> <b>called</b> “automatic” because <b>they</b> could <b>be</b> loaded into the barrel separately from the projectile, and automatically became firmly attached to the projectile on firing. <b>They</b> <b>were</b> <b>called</b> rotating gas-checks because <b>they</b> <b>were</b> able to rotate the projectile, enabling the use of studless projectiles. <b>They</b> <b>were</b> <b>called</b> EOC gas-checks, because <b>they</b> <b>were</b> developed by the Armstrong company which owned EOC.|$|R
5|$|Classic {{genome-wide}} {{linkage analysis}} has identified nine loci on different chromosomes associated with psoriasis. <b>They</b> <b>are</b> <b>called</b> psoriasis susceptibility 1 through 9 (PSORS1 through PSORS9). Within those loci are genes on pathways {{that lead to}} inflammation. Certain variations (mutations) of those genes are commonly found in psoriasis. Genome-wide association scans have identified other genes that are altered to characteristic variants in psoriasis. Some of these genes express inflammatory signal proteins, which affect cells in the immune system that are also involved in psoriasis. Some of these genes are also involved in other autoimmune diseases.|$|E
5|$|Epidemiology is used {{to break}} the chain of {{infection}} in populations during outbreaks of viral diseases. Control measures are used {{that are based on}} knowledge of how the virus is transmitted. It is important to find the source, or sources, of the outbreak and to identify the virus. Once the virus has been identified, the chain of transmission can sometimes be broken by vaccines. When vaccines are not available, sanitation and disinfection can be effective. Often, infected people are isolated {{from the rest of the}} community, and those that have been exposed to the virus are placed in quarantine. To control the outbreak of foot-and-mouth disease in cattle in Britain in 2001, thousands of cattle were slaughtered. Most viral infections of humans and other animals have incubation periods during which the infection causes no signs or symptoms. Incubation periods for viral diseases range from a few days to weeks, but are known for most infections. Somewhat overlapping, but mainly following the incubation period, there is a period of communicability — a time when an infected individual or animal is contagious and can infect another person or animal. This, too, is known for many viral infections, and knowledge of the length of both periods is important in the control of outbreaks. When outbreaks cause an unusually high proportion of cases in a population, community, or region, <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>called</b> epidemics. If outbreaks spread worldwide, <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>called</b> pandemics.|$|E
5|$|Grammar is {{the study}} of how {{meaningful}} elements called morphemes within a language can be combined into utterances. Morphemes can either be free or bound. If they are free to be moved around within an utterance, they are usually called words, and if they are bound to other words or morphemes, <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>called</b> affixes. The way in which meaningful elements can be combined within a language is governed by rules. The rules for the internal structure of words are called morphology. The rules of the internal structure of phrases and sentences are called syntax.|$|E

5000|$|The {{exact time}} {{period when the}} name [...] "Hun" [...] had the phonetization [...] "Xianyun" [...] remains {{determined}} only vaguely: Sima Qian stated that in the earlier pre-historic period the Huns <b>were</b> <b>called</b> [...] "Hu" [...] and [...] "Rong", in the late pre-historic period <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>called</b> [...] "Xunyu", in the literate period starting with the Yin Dynasty (1600-1046 BC) <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>called</b> [...] "Guifang", in the Zhou period (1045-256 BC) <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>called</b> [...] "Xianyun", starting from the Qin period (221-206 BC) the Chinese annalists called them [...] "Xiongnu".|$|R
50|$|Macadamia trees, {{or their}} nuts, had many {{different}} names during this period: in New South Wales <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>called</b> Bush Nuts or Mullimbimby Nuts; further north <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>called</b> Queensland Nuts or Bauple Nuts (or Bopple and Popple); {{and in all}} areas <b>they</b> <b>were</b> known as Australia Nut, Poplar and Nut Oak. Aboriginal groups {{in each of the}} localities where the nuts were found wild had named them: boombera was common in New South Wales, the Pine River groups called them burrawang; and in most of Queensland <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>called</b> kendel or kindal kindal.|$|R
5|$|If a comet is {{traveling}} fast enough, it may leave the Solar System. Such comets follow the open {{path of a}} hyperbola, and as such <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>called</b> hyperbolic comets. To date, comets are only known to be ejected by interacting with another object in the Solar System, such as Jupiter. An {{example of this is}} thought to be Comet C/1980 E1, which was shifted from a predicted orbit of 7.1 million years around the Sun, to a hyperbolic trajectory, after a 1980 close pass by the planet Jupiter.|$|E
5|$|In Hemiptera (true bugs), the {{forewings}} may be hardened, {{though to}} a lesser extent than in the beetles. For example, the anterior part of the front wings of stink bugs is hardened, while the posterior part is membranous. <b>They</b> <b>are</b> <b>called</b> hemelytron (pl. hemelytra). They are only found in the suborder Heteroptera; the wings of the Homoptera, such as the cicada, are typically entirely membranous. Both forewings and hindwings of Cicada are membranous, most species are glass-like although some are opaque. Cicadas are not good fliers and most fly only a few seconds. When flying, forewing and hindwing are hooked together by a grooved coupling along the hindwing costa and forewing margin. Most species have a basic venation as shown in the following picture.|$|E
5|$|Many {{types of}} objects in {{abstract}} algebra can satisfy chain conditions, and usually if they satisfy an ascending chain condition, <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>called</b> Noetherian in her honor. By definition, a Noetherian ring satisfies an ascending chain condition on its left and right ideals, whereas a Noetherian group {{is defined as a}} group in which every strictly ascending chain of subgroups is finite. A Noetherian module is a module in which every strictly ascending chain of submodules becomes constant after a finite number of steps. A Noetherian space is a topological space in which every strictly ascending chain of open subspaces becomes constant after a finite number of steps; this definition makes the spectrum of a Noetherian ring a Noetherian topological space.|$|E

5|$|Aboriginal {{cultural}} areas {{depend upon}} their ancestors' primary lifeway, or occupation, {{at the time}} of European contact. These culture areas correspond closely with physical and ecological regions of Canada. The indigenous peoples of the Pacific Northwest Coast were centred around ocean and river fishing; in the interior of British Columbia, hunter-gatherer and river fishing. In both of these areas the salmon was of chief importance. For the people of the plains, bison hunting was the primary activity. In the subarctic forest, other species such as the moose were more important. For peoples near the Great Lakes and Saint Lawrence River, shifting agriculture was practised, including the raising of maize, beans, and squash. While for the Inuit, hunting was the primary source of food with seals the primary component of their diet. The caribou, fish, other marine mammals {{and to a lesser extent}} plants, berries and seaweed are part of the Inuit diet. One of the most noticeable symbols of Inuit culture, the inukshuk is the emblem of the Vancouver 2010 Winter Olympics. Inuksuit are rock sculptures made by stacking stones; in the shape of a human figure, <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>called</b> inunnguaq.|$|E
5|$|Although the {{gameplay}} is {{as that of}} Ruby and Sapphire, Emerald introduces new features. The plot is modified; both Team Magma and Aqua are villains who {{are locked}} in a constant gang war and awaken Groudon and Kyogre, respectively. When the two legendary Pokémon begin to battle each other, the protagonist must unleash the legendary Pokémon Rayquaza (pictured on the box cover) to calm them. Some of the game mechanics are changed as well. Though double battles were clearly marked in Ruby and Sapphire, in Emerald, two separate trainers might unite to battle as a pair. After the Elite Four is defeated, the player may re-battle Gym Leaders in a double battle if <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>called</b> on their PokéNav. Also, Pokémon sprites are animated in battle like they were in Pokémon Crystal. Probably the most significant addition is the Battle Frontier, an expanded version of the Battle Tower in Ruby and Sapphire.|$|E
5|$|Walter (John Noble) has {{prepared}} himself to reveal to Peter (Joshua Jackson) the truththat {{he is from}} the parallel universewhen <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>called</b> to a case. Two teenagers were found dead, evidently killed by shapeshifter agents from the parallel universe. Exploring the nearby area, they find a third unformed shapeshifter which Walter takes to the lab to study. At the same time of the teenagers' death, they find a carrier signal in the local television. With biotechnology corporation Massive Dynamic's help, they determine that the signal emanated from the parallel universe during a brief moment that the two universes were in sync, and that the next point of synchronization would occur the next afternoon. Recalling Thomas Jerome Newton's (Sebastian Roché) previous attempt to bring a building from the parallel universe into the prime, the Fringe team believes they must stop this next attempt.|$|E

50|$|As {{navigation}} {{increased in}} importance, improvements {{were made to}} the basic design, and <b>they</b> came to <b>be</b> known by various names according to where <b>they</b> <b>were</b> located. Thus on the Thames <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>called</b> navigation weirs, on the East Anglian rivers <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>called</b> staunches, those on the River Avon, Warwickshire <b>were</b> <b>called</b> water gates, and in a number of instances <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>called</b> half locks. On the River Nene and some of the tributaries of the River Great Ouse, a design using a guillotine gate in a wooden frame was used from the early seventeenth century onwards. The gate was opened by operating a large spoked wheel, connected by chains to a toothed drum.|$|R
5|$|After the Clarno volcanoes had subsided, {{they were}} {{replaced}} about 36million {{years ago by}} eruptions from volcanoes to the west, in the general vicinity of {{what would become the}} Cascade Range. The John Day volcanoes, as <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>called,</b> emitted large volumes of ash and dust, much of which settled in the John Day basin. As with the earlier Clarno debris flows, the rapid deposition of ash preserved the remains of plants and animals living in the region. Because ash and other debris fell during varied climatic and volcanic conditions and accumulated from many further eruptions extending into the early Miocene (about 20million years ago), the sediment layers in the fossil beds vary in their chemical composition and color. Laid down on top of the Clarno Strata, the younger John Day Strata consist of several distinct groups of layers. The lowermost contains red ash such as that exposed in the Painted Hills Unit. The layer above it is mainly pea-green clay. On top of the pea-green layer are buff-colored layers. Fossils found in the John Day Strata include a wide variety of plants and more than 100 species of mammals, including dogs, cats, oreodonts, saber-toothed tigers, horses, camels, and rodents. The Blue Basin and the Sheep Rock unit contain many of these same fossils, as well as turtles, opossums, and large pigs. More than 60 plant species are fossilized in these strata, such as hydrangea, peas, hawthorn, and mulberry, as well as pines and many deciduous trees. One of the notable plant fossils is the Metasequoia (dawn redwood), a genus thought to have gone extinct worldwide until it was discovered alive in China in the early 20thcentury.|$|E
