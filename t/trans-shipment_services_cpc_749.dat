5|$|John Service, {{while under}} Stilwell's command, {{served as a}} {{diplomatic}} observer for both Stilwell and the American Embassy in Chungking. Over the next three months, he sent {{a series of reports}} to Chungking, and sparked controversy immediately. <b>Service</b> praised the <b>CPC</b> and compared them to European socialists, rather than the feared U.S.S.R. <b>Service</b> credited the <b>CPC</b> for a clean and superior society {{in stark contrast to the}} corruption and chaos he saw in the Nationalist areas controlled by Chiang Kai-shek. He was found bias. After visiting Yan'an, Service advocated that the United States should work with the forces opposed to the Nationalists, such as the Communists, though he did not advocate abandoning Chiang. This opinion was shared by John Paton Davies, and this position ruined both careers.|$|R
50|$|While CPCs often {{look like}} {{abortion}} clinics and are intentionally located near them, most are not legally licensed as medical clinics {{and do not}} offer medical <b>services.</b> However, <b>CPCs</b> often offer free pregnancy tests, often over-the-counter ones; additionally, there is a trend toward CPCs obtaining medical clinic status, largely so that more CPCs may offer sonograms {{in an attempt to}} convince women to carry their pregnancies to term. They may also provide screening for sexually transmitted infections, adoption referrals, religious counseling, financial assistance, prenatal services, child-rearing resources and other services.|$|R
50|$|The 5 CPC, in {{its report}} {{submitted}} in January 1997, recommended increase in posts for Armed Forces personnel in Group C and D in Central Armed Police Forces (CAPFs) from 10 to 25percent. For Short Service Commissioned Officers, on completion of their military <b>service,</b> 5 <b>CPC</b> recommended earmarking 25 percent officer's post in the CAPFs. These recommendationsby the pay Commission were intended to reduce the defence pension bill; save on training and recruitment costs; provide trained manpower to government departments; and provide soldiers a second career after their term of military engagement.|$|R
50|$|Sir Lawrence {{was clearly}} an {{entrepreneur}} who saw opportunities {{and took them}} up, for example he is noted for having built the Forth and Clyde Canal, which linked east coast with the west coast, through his estates. That canal was used mainly for the shipment of bulk commodities, especially coal from the Lanarkshire pits to Glasgow and Edinburgh. Nearby lies a modern feature the Falkirk Wheel which links the Forth and Clyde Canal with the Union Canal. Sir Lawrence Dundas founded Grangemouth in 1777 at {{the eastern end of}} the Forth and Clyde canal as a <b>trans-shipment</b> and <b>service</b> point. Grangemouth today is probably Scotland’s busiest port. The rapidly expanding town of Grangemouth gradually absorbed the parish of Bothkennar. In 1789, GEORGE III, William Frederick, King of Great Britain and Ireland as part of a greater earldom confirmed the barony and granted the original charter which now serves as documented reference for subsequent tracing of the title.|$|R
50|$|A crisis {{pregnancy}} center (CPC), {{sometimes called}} a pregnancy resource center (PRC), {{is a type}} of nonprofit organization established to counsel pregnant women against having an abortion. CPCs generally provide peer counseling related to abortion, pregnancy, and childbirth, and may also offer additional non-medical services such as financial assistance, child-rearing resources, and adoption referrals. CPCs that qualify as medical clinics may also provide pregnancy testing, sonograms, and other <b>services.</b> However, <b>CPCs</b> have also been known to disseminate false medical information, usually about the supposed physical and mental health risks of abortion, but sometimes also about the effectiveness of condoms and the prevention of sexually transmitted infections.|$|R
50|$|Fifth Central Pay Commission (5 CPC)The 5 CPC, in {{its report}} {{submitted}} in January 1997, recommended increase in posts for Armed Forces personnel in Group C and D in Central Armed Police Forces (CAPFs) from 10 percent to 25 percent. For Short Service Commissioned Officers, on completion of their military <b>service,</b> 5 <b>CPC</b> recommended earmarking 25 percent officer's post in the CAPFs. The intent of these recommendations was to reduce the defence pension bill, save on training and recruitment costs, provide trained manpower to government departments, and provide soldiers a second career after their term of military engagement.The Pay Commission recommendations were, however, mostly ignored by the Janata Dal (United Front), and BJP Government of Atal Bihari Vajpayee that followed. Mulayam Singh Yadav, Defence Minister (1 June 1996 - 19 March 1998), Indrajit Gupta (Communist Party of India-United Front), Home Minister (29 June 1996 - 19 March 1998), and L K Advani (BJP), Home Minister (19 March 1998 - 22 May 2004) did little to implement these recommendations. The problem festered, and the pension bill ballooned.|$|R

The agreement provided CPC with engineering, manufacturing, and sales capabilities allowing it to reintroduce the Snow King line of snow thrower engines and other engines formerly manufactured and sold by TecumsehPower. The engines are exclusively represented by LCT, and sold under the Snow King, Lauson, and LCT brands and <b>serviced</b> exclusively by <b>CPC</b> and the existing TecumsehPower dealer/distributor network. Traditionally, the Snow King line of engines had powered more snowthrowers than all other brands combined.|$|R
40|$|For {{supporters}} of the pro-life cause, crisis pregnancy centers (or CPC 2 ̆ 7 s) have become the 2 ̆ 2 darlings of the movement, 2 ̆ 2 according to the New York Times (Belluck, 2013), offering women with unplanned pregnancies free advice, information, classes, childcare, and needed supplies. For abortion advocates, such establishments are intended to seduce vulnerable abortion-seekers {{into a situation where}} they will be counseled out of an abortion and possibly even proselytized. Yet for as much controversy as exists in the news media, medical community, and legal realm about CPC 2 ̆ 7 s, there is an unsettling lack of understanding of how [...] and why [...] CPC 2 ̆ 7 s market themselves the way they do. Their challenge is unique; they must 2 ̆ 2 sell 2 ̆ 2 non-abortive services to women who are oftentimes insecure, pressured, and abortion-minded. If one grants the right of such centers to exist, one must also grant their right to advertise. Do they market with active or passive persuasion, and does it accomplish the goal? To answer such questions, this study focuses on VirtueMedia, a notable pro-life marketing non-profit with connections to Care Net [...] the closest crisis pregnancy care equivalent of Planned Parenthood on the pro-life side. Using Petty and Cacioppo 2 ̆ 7 s elaboration-likelihood model, or ELM, this study uses both proprietary and traditional means of content analysis to explore the themes and persuasive routes exhibited in two contrasting VirtueMedia television commercial campaigns. The study found that of the two campaigns analyzed, both relied heavily on peripheral cues and passive forms of persuasion, but not to the extent typically assumed. Overt central cues played a prominent role in one of the two campaigns. Also, women 2 ̆ 7 s-issues framing of the description of <b>CPC</b> <b>services</b> [...] as a peripheral cue [...] differed vastly in both form and function, sometimes taking a form that abortion advocates could consider 2 ̆ 2 deceptive, 2 ̆ 2 and other times existing alongside explicitly pro-life messages. The study, in fact, found that as inferred audience elaboration levels increased, the women 2 ̆ 7 s-issues message framing actually inverted pro-choice terms {{to draw attention to the}} tragedy of the post-abortive experience, showing a rhetorical strategy that is fluid depending upon the involvement of the audience [...] something again more consistent with brand positioning than deception. In sum, this ELM-based content analysis demonstrated that language typically indicative of pro-choice messages is employed by VirtueMedia as a brand positioning strategy rather than to intentionally obfuscate VirtueMedia 2 ̆ 7 s political views...|$|R
