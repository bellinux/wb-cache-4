25|$|A {{mid-range}} {{speaker is}} a loudspeaker driver that reproduces {{a band of}} frequencies generally between 1–6kHz, otherwise known as the 'mid' frequencies (between the woofer and tweeter). Mid-range driver diaphragms can be made of paper or composite materials, and can be direct radiation drivers (rather like smaller woofers) or they can be compression drivers (rather like some tweeter designs). If the mid-range driver is a direct radiator, it can be mounted on the front baffle of a loudspeaker enclosure, or, if a compression driver, mounted at the <b>throat</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>horn</b> for added output level and control of radiation pattern.|$|E
5000|$|An antenna lead-in is the {{transmission}} line (or feed line) which connects the antenna to a transmitter or receiver. The antenna feed may refer to all components connecting the antenna to the transmitter or receiver, such as an impedance matching network in addition to {{the transmission}} line. In a so-called aperture antenna, such as a horn or parabolic dish, the [...] "feed" [...] may also refer to a basic antenna inside the entire system (normally at the focus of the parabolic dish or at the <b>throat</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>horn)</b> which could be considered the one active element in that antenna system. A microwave antenna may also be fed directly from a waveguide in place of a (conductive) transmission line.|$|E
5000|$|Because {{ionized gas}} is {{electrically}} charged {{and so can}} be manipulated by a variable electrical field, {{it is possible to}} use a small sphere of plasma as a tweeter. Such tweeters are called a [...] "plasma" [...] tweeter or [...] "ion" [...] tweeter. They are more complex than other tweeters (plasma generation is not required in other types), but offer the advantage that the moving mass is optimally low, and so very responsive to the signal input. These types of tweeters are not capable of high output, nor of other than very high frequency reproduction, and so are usually used at the <b>throat</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>horn</b> structure to manage usable output levels. One disadvantage is that the plasma arc typically produces ozone, a poison gas, in small quantities as a by-product. Because of this, German-made Magnat [...] "magnasphere" [...] speakers were banned from import to the United States in the 1980s.|$|E
40|$|Here, {{we present}} a compact {{component}} for waveguide systems and horn antennas, enabling both filtering and polarization rotation capabilities. In particular, the proposed module consists <b>of</b> <b>an</b> electrically thin-chiral particle, which is first used to design a waveguide twist to connect two waveguide sections mutually rotated by 90 °. We show that around the resonant frequency of the particle, good transmission efficiency between the two mutually orthogonal waveguides is achieved. Then, the same module is inserted at the <b>throat</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> vertically polarized <b>horn</b> antenna to rotate its polarization plane and narrow its matching bandwidth. The result is <b>a</b> filtering <b>horn</b> antenna that, within the operating bandwidth of the particle, efficiently radiates a horizontally polarized field. The effectiveness of the proposed module is verified through numerical and experimental results...|$|R
40|$|A {{simple and}} cheap {{solution}} is proposed to transform a wideband and linearly polarised <b>horn</b> antenna in <b>a</b> dual-band circularly polarised horn filtenna. The filtering and polarisation transformation capabilities are achieved by inserting inside the <b>throat</b> <b>of</b> the <b>horn</b> <b>a</b> complementary electrically small resonator etched on a thin metallic sheet. In this way, the overall structure is well matched in two frequency ranges (13 – 14 and 16. 4 – 17 GHz) and radiates left-handed and right-handed circularly polarised {{fields in the}} lower and upper frequency bands, respectively. The measurements performed on a realised prototype confirm the good performance of the proposed structure, which may be employed in satellite communication systems requiring different circular polarisation for the up- and down-link frequency ranges...|$|R

5000|$|In 1984, Gunness filed {{a patent}} {{for a better}} way to use a {{manifold}} to combine the outputs of multiple compression drivers for increased sound power level (SPL), using two to four flat reflecting surfaces in the <b>throat</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>horn</b> to redirect sound waves for a more coherent summation. This low-distortion manifold design made it possible for EV to produce its first high-power concert and touring loudspeaker: the MT-4, with [...] "MT" [...] standing for [...] "Manifold Technology". This was a 4-way system split between two enclosures, with four speaker drivers summed in each bandpass; a total of 16 drivers. The upper two bandpasses used the Gunness manifold design for compression drivers, each manifold formed of two zinc castings. The medium low frequencies were carried by four 10 in cone drivers summed using a larger embodiment of the Gunness manifold concept based on ray tracing and reflection. The MT-4 was a very heavy system at 633 lb, but it put more power into a smaller package, and it was quicker to position and connect. The MT-4 proved popular, used on major tours and festivals such as the 1995 Monsters of Rock at Donington Park in central England and the main stage of the 1996 Lollapalooza tour featuring Metallica and Soundgarden. Together, EV engineer David Carlson and Gunness presented a paper to the Audio Engineering Society (AES) in November 1986, describing the methods they used to sum four drivers in each bandpass.|$|E
40|$|In this contribution, {{we present}} {{the design of}} a power-selectivity horn filtenna based on the use of a {{nonlinear}} Split Ring Resonator (SRR). In particular, in order to obtain a nonlinear behavior of the SRR, we load its external gap with a pair of Schottky diodes, which require a not negligible power level to be activated. Inserting the resulting nonlinear resonator inside the <b>throat</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>horn</b> antenna, we show that both matching and radiating properties exhibit or do not exhibit a notched-band, depending on the operating power level...|$|E
