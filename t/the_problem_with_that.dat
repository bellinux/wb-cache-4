2500|$|Sites such as Facebook are {{becoming}} increasingly popular tools for methods of ending relationships and friendships, proving that although new media is {{being used as a}} tool for connecting with individuals, it is now creating new problems associated with disconnecting from others. Instead of the traditional phone call or face-to-face interaction between individuals, people are now starting to end relationships by simply changing their relationship status, knowing full well that their significant other will see it shortly. <b>The</b> <b>problem</b> <b>with</b> <b>that</b> is that you are left with no closure and the entire online world now knows you are no longer in a relationship. In a 2010 study conducted online, nearly one-quarter of the 1,000 individuals surveyed found out that their own relationship was over by seeing it on Facebook. New media websites have made our private lives much more public, {{especially when it comes to}} breaking up, since updates are able to be immediately viewed by everyone in our networks (which tend to be more people than we would normally tell personally); for example, having friends comment on your newly changed [...] "single" [...] relationship status, and having to explain what happened can be distressing.|$|E

[...] There may, however, be no alternative to the Gacaca trials, she added. [...] "Obviously the problem of delivering justice after the genocide is an overwhelming problem. Gacaca may not be ideal but there is at this point no alternative.... The official explanation I think is that people did not speak openly until the Gacaca process and now many more accusations are surfacing. Also, the concession program, which requires the naming of all those who participated along with the accused , has led to a multiplication of names.

2500|$|The infamous {{exchange}} between McCartney and Harrison occurred on Monday, January 6. Around lunchtime on Friday, January 10, tensions {{came to a}} head and Harrison told the others that he was leaving the band. [...] This entire episode is omitted from the film. He later recalled: [...] "I thought, 'I'm quite capable of being happy on my own, and if I'm not able to be happy in this situation I'm getting out of here.' So I got my guitar and went home and that afternoon wrote 'Wah-Wah'." [...] Rehearsals and filming continued for a few more sessions; the finished film only used a small amount of footage from this period, namely a boogie-woogie piano duet by McCartney and Starr, although it was included in a way such that Harrison's absence was not apparent. [...] While he was gone, the others considered replacing him with guitarist Eric Clapton, an idea that particularly appealed to Lennon, who was captured on tape saying that if: [...] "George doesn’t come back by Monday or Tuesday, we ask Eric Clapton to play”, and that this would be congenial to Clapton in that the Beatles, unlike Clapton's previous band Cream, “would give him full scope to play his guitar.” [...] Years later, Clapton commented on the absurdity of this idea: “There may have been [...] <b>The</b> <b>problem</b> <b>with</b> <b>that</b> was I had bonded or was developing a relationship with George, exclusive of them. I think it fitted a need of his and mine, that he could elevate himself by having this guy that could be like a gunslinger to them. Lennon would use my name every now and then for clout, as if I was the fastest gun. So, I don’t think I could have been brought into the whole thing because I was too much a mate of George’s.” ...|$|E

40|$|In 2001, New Zealand {{modified}} its {{quota management}} system (QMS) {{to function as}} a hybrid ITQ/tax system. Catches in excess of annual catch entitlements (ACE) incur payments, called “deemed values”. The deemed value system was part of the reforms that separated ACE from quota, which reduced transactions costs for both the industry and government.

This paper will explain the catch balancing regime used prior to deemed values, and <b>the</b> <b>problems</b> <b>with</b> <b>that</b> system.

A core problem is that limited information is available for {{a large proportion of the}} 629 stocks managed in the QMS, so setting both quota and deemed values is inherently imprecise.

50|$|In {{more recent}} years the use of {{mitochondrial}} DNA (mtDNA) and Y-DNA chromosomal markers has offered the opportunity for clarification {{of the origin of}} the Sami. While their mtDNA haplogroup distribution overwhelmingly represents a subset of the European gene-pool, the most common Y-DNA haplogroup among the Sami is widely believed to be of Eurasian origin and very common among all peoples in Northeastern Europe, which is haplogroup N and its subclades. Some research shows that the second most common haplogroup is I, which is found almost exclusively among those of European ancestry. Haplogroup I in Sami, at least 38 Sami in Sweden, is dated to the 14th century, so quite late in Sami (genetic) history. In the study were only those 38 Sami tested. <b>The</b> <b>problem</b> <b>with</b> <b>that</b> study {{is that it does not}} reveal all the different haplogroups in each of the individuals.

Some of these methods include nematicides, cover crops, crop rotation, genetically modified plants and seed treatments. In soybeans, Essex is a tolerant cultivar whereas Forrest is sensitive. Essex has a higher yield in fields that are infested with the nematode. The plots in this study by Koenning were treated with aldicarb, carbofuran, and fenamiphos and had less nematodes 40 days post planting then the areas that were not treated. The plots that were planted with Forrest which is the sensitive cultivar and treated with carbofuran had a higher yield than untreated control plots. Damage threshold levels have not been well established but using fumigated plots has shown significant increases in yield.
