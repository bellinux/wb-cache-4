40|$|In east Europe {{and north}} Asia the {{majority}} of nuclear power-stations (NPS) as well as large hydro-electric (HES) and <b>thermal</b> <b>electric</b> <b>stations</b> (TES) are located within the north Eurasian lithosphere plate, which {{is characterized by the}} low seismicity and weak modern tectonic activity besides the different exogenetic processes. Some operating and projected NPS are relatively near to zones of the moderate seismicity in the Kaliningrad Region of northwest Russia and in south Ukraine. HES and TES in Baltic, Byelorussia and Ukraine are in the same position. Zones of more intensive seismicity and existence of active faults include NPS, HEP and TEP in the Urals, the Kola Peninsula, south Siberia, Transbaikal and Far East regions of Russia. Some of these stations are situated within crust blocks in transit zones, which separate main lithosphere plates and are characterized by increased tectonic mobility. The electric power-stations are most danger in the transit zones between north Eurasian, Arabian and Indian lithosphere plates, where collision processes have yet not stopped. This concerns <b>electric</b> <b>stations</b> in central Asia and Caucasus including NPS in Armenia. Seven schemes of the seismic energy distribution are composed for different parts of east Europe and north Asia.

The process modelling has been held on specialized stands and trial-industrial pulverized-coal ducts. Experimental investigations have been held on working boilers of power stations. As a result new effective qualities of the coal pulverization feed system with high concentration while low-reaction fuel burning have been established. The calculation methodology of the coal pulverization feed system aerodynamics has been developed. Regime parameters of the transportation with minimum power expenses and pulsations of a flow have been established. The new technological system of the coal pulverization feed for boilers with the oncoming disposition of vortical burners has been elaborated as well as control means of thecoal dust consumption and the methodology of the industrial adjustment of systes with aerofeeders. Recommendations for the decrease of pulsations, NO 3 x 1, pressure losses in boiler pulverized-coal ducts have been given.

40|$|We {{tested the}} {{effectiveness}} of a Hidrostal pump and filtered mercury vapor light system was tested for attracting, concentrating, and transporting fish commonly impinged on water intake structures of <b>thermal</b> <b>electric</b> generating <b>stations</b> on the Great Lakes. In general, the Hidrostal pump effectively transported test fish with relatively low mortality rates. Mortality varied among fish species, with rainbow trout (Salmo gairdneri) significantly hardier than yellow perch (Perca flavescens) and alewife (Alosa pseudoharengus). Mortality also generally increased at higher pumping speeds, while mortality of yellow perch was greater in a long transport loop than in a short transport loop. In tests of fish attraction and capture, the addition of a filtered mercury vapor light significantly increased the efficiency of fish capture of the Hidrostal pump transport system. Other directive cues (bubble curtains, strobe lights, and electric fields) did not significantly improve the efficiency of the Hidrostal pump-mercury vapor light system.

40|$|Normal 0 false false false EN-US X-NONE X-NONE MicrosoftInternetExplorer 4 Concentrations of six {{heavy metals}} (Pb, Cd, Cr, Ni, Cu, V) in muscles of {{freshwater}} fish have been determined in this work. Samples are taken from 20 freshwater reservoirs in Lithuania. The concentrations of HMs have been determined using the ICP-MS model "Element" (Finnigan MAT). It is found that in 20 % of samples the concentration of Pb exceeds the Maximum Tolerable Limit (MTL). The highest Cd concentration - 0. 14 mg/kg - almost 1. 5 {{times higher than the}} MTL is found in the sample from the Elektrėnai Pond which collects cooling water from the <b>thermal</b> <b>electric</b> power <b>station.</b> In other samples of fish muscle the Cd concentration does not exceed the MTL and ranges from 0. 042 mg/kg to 0. 058 mg/kg. When comparing {{the results of the present}} research with the data from 1998, it is found that the concentrations of HMs are increasing. Increase in the concentrations of Pb and Cd is particularly significant. As an example, an increase in the amount of Pb in 3 samples ranges between 11. 3 % and 14 %, in one sample - almost 27 %, in 4 samples - from 50 % to 66 %, in one sample - 89 %, and in one - almost 18 times. The concentration of Cd in 2 samples has increased almost by 20 %, in 5 samples, on average - by 40 - 70 %, in one sample - 86 %, and in one sample - 3 times. The concentration of other HMs in fish muscles has increased in the following way: the arithmetic average of Cr concentration increase is 82. 4 %, Cu and V increase, on average - 28 %, Ni - 17 times. In order to develop the fishing industry in freshwater reservoirs it is important to maintain the water quality standards, and to regularly monitor the levels of accumulation of HMs in water, sediments and fish...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to examine water use {{estimation}} in hydel and <b>thermal</b> <b>electric</b> power plants in selected regions i. e.

The study primarily focuses on the realistic fundamental premise that <b>thermal</b> <b>electric</b> and hydro electric energy generation is responsible for the largest monthly volume of water withdrawals in four seasons (i. e. summer, rainy, winter and post monsoon season) of a year. These enormous water withdrawals by these hydel and thermal power plants can have significant influence on local surface water resources. However there are very few studies of determinants of water use in hydel and <b>thermal</b> <b>electric</b> generation. Analysis of hydel and <b>thermal</b> <b>electric</b> water use data in the existing power plants clearly indicates that there is wide variability in unitary hydel and <b>thermal</b> <b>electric</b> water use within the system. The multivariate regression procedures were used to identify the significant determinants of thermal and hydel water withdrawals in various power plants i. e. five hydel and four thermal power plants. The estimated regression coefficients indicate that the best explanatory variables for the total quantity of hydel water withdrawals are storage capacity, tail water level and actual generation and thermal water withdrawals are condenser cooling and ash disposal.
