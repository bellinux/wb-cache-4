5|$|After Parise's {{penalty was}} served, it was Canada's turn {{to go on}} the power play, and Esposito scored his sixth goal of the series to tie it at 1–1. The teams {{exchanged}} power plays before Lutchenko scored a power play goal on a slap shot <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>the</b> Soviets ahead 2–1. Brad Park then scored his only goal of the series at even strength to complete some pretty passing between Dennis Hull and the Rangers' teammates of Ratelle, Gilbert and Park to tie the score. The period ended with the teams tied 2–2.|$|E
5|$|All work <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>the</b> I-185 into {{production}} was cancelled afterwards, {{even with the}} M-82 engine, as they were all required for the La-5 fighter. Another reason cited was that the La-5 used the fuselage of the Lavochkin-Gorbunov-Goudkov LaGG-3 which was already in production in three plants and would involve less disruption of the production lines. Another factor may have been that the La-5 required less duralumin to build, something in short supply at the time.|$|E

5|$|As Buchenwald was {{a forced}} labor camp, the German {{authorities}} had intended <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>the</b> 168 airmen {{to work as}} slave-labor in the nearby armament factories. Consequently, Lamason was ordered by an SS officer to instruct the airmen to work, or he would be immediately executed by firing squad. Lamason refused to give the order and informed the officer that they were soldiers and could not and would not participate in war production. After a tense stand-off, during which time Lamason {{thought he would be}} shot, the SS officer eventually backed down.|$|E

According to a Target spokesperson, the store was only interested in retailing albums which were released digitally and physically simultaneously. On December 21, 2013, all the videos from the album were screened at the SVA Theater in New York.|$|E
5|$|As the 100,000-year {{periodicity}} only {{dominates the}} climate of the past million years, there is insufficient information to separate the component frequencies of eccentricity using spectral analysis, making the reliable detection of significant longer-term trends more difficult, although the spectral analysis of much longer palaeoclimate records, such as the Lisiecki and Raymo stack of marine cores and James Zachos' composite isotopic record, helps <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>the</b> last million years in longer term context. Hence {{there is still no}} clear proof of the mechanism responsible for the 100ka periodicity—but there are several credible hypotheses.|$|E

5|$|Beilhart preached in Chicago and elsewhere, but was {{not known}} to proselytize strongly; however, {{although}} the group typically kept to themselves, their mysterious nature led to misconceptions and suspicion in the press. In 1904, numerous newspaper articles and editorials were written, mostly in Chicago, about the Society. Those articles were often sensationalist and served <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>the</b> Society in a bad light. The views and practices of the Society, particularly those against marriage and promoting free love, were not well accepted in the small Ohio community. Thus, in 1904, the group left Lisbon for Chicago where they expected their progressive ideas might be better tolerated.|$|E
5|$|Between 1594 and 1603, Elizabeth {{faced her}} most severe test in Ireland during the Nine Years' War, a revolt {{that took place}} at the height of {{hostilities}} with Spain, who backed the rebel leader, Hugh O'Neill, Earl of Tyrone. In spring 1599, Elizabeth sent Robert Devereux, 2nd Earl of Essex, <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>the</b> revolt down. To her frustration, he made little progress and returned to England in defiance of her orders. He was replaced by Charles Blount, Lord Mountjoy, who took three years to defeat the rebels. O'Neill finally surrendered in 1603, a few days after Elizabeth's death. Soon afterwards, a peace treaty was signed between England and Spain.|$|E

That law required that public access to such records be maintained, but did not specify where the records be kept. Following Goldschmidt's decision <b>to</b> <b>put</b> <b>the</b> documents {{in the care of}} the OHS, the state legislature passed a law requiring future governors to leave their documents in the state archives.
