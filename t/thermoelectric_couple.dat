5000|$|History of Zinc Antimony Alloys and Zinc AntimonideThe first {{reported}} use of zinc-antimony alloys {{was in the}} original work of Seebeck on thermoelectricity. By the 1860s, Moses G. Farmer, an American inventor, had developed the first high powered thermoelectric generator based on using a zinc-antimony alloy with a composition very close to stoichiometric ZnSb. He showed this generator at the 1867 Paris Exposition where it was carefully studied and copied (with minor modifications) {{by a number of}} people including Clamond. Farmer finally received the patent on his generator in 1870. George H. Cove patented a thermoelectric generator based on a Zn-Sb alloy in the early 1900s. His patent claimed that the voltage and current for six [...] "joints" [...] was 3V at 3A. This was a far higher output than would be expected from a <b>thermoelectric</b> <b>couple,</b> and was possibly the first demonstration of the thermophotovoltaic effect, as the bandgap for ZnSb is 0.56eV, which under ideal conditions could yield close to 0.5V per diode. The next researcher to work with the material was Maria Telkes while she was at Westinghouse in Pittsburgh during the 1930s. Interest was revived again with the discovery of the higher bandgap Zn4Sb3 material in the 1990s.|$|E
40|$|The {{development}} of more efficient <b>thermoelectric</b> <b>couple</b> technology capable of operating with high-grade heat sources up to 1, 275 K is key to improving the performance of radioisotope thermoelectric generators. Lanthanum telluride La 3 -xTe 4 and 14 - 1 - 11 Zintls (Yb 14 MnSb 11) {{have been identified as}} very promising materials. The fabrication of advanced high-temperature thermoelectric couples requires the joining of several dissimilar materials, typically including a number of diffusion bonding and brazing steps, to achieve a device capable of operating at elevated temperatures across a large temperature differential (up to 900 K). A <b>thermoelectric</b> <b>couple</b> typically comprises a heat collector/ exchanger, metallic interconnects on both hot and cold sides, n-type and ptype conductivity thermoelectric elements, and cold-side hardware to connect to the cold-side heat rejection and provide electrical connections. Differences in the physical, mechanical, and chemical properties of the materials that make up the <b>thermoelectric</b> <b>couple,</b> especially differences in the coefficients of thermal expansion (CTE), result in undesirable interfacial stresses that can lead to mechanical failure of the device. The problem is further {{complicated by the fact that}} the thermoelectric materials under consideration have large CTE values, are brittle, and cracks can propagate through them with minimal resistance. The inherent challenge of bonding brittle, high-thermal-expansion thermoelectric materials to a hot shoe material that is thick enough to carry the requisite electrical current was overcome. A critical advantage over prior art is that this device was constructed using all diffusion bonds and a minimum number of assembly steps. The fabrication process and the materials used are described in the following steps: (1) Applying a thin refractory metal foil to both sides of lanthanum telluride. To fabricate the n-type leg of the advanced <b>thermoelectric</b> <b>couple,</b> the pre-synthesized lanthanum telluride coupon was diffusion bonded to the metal foil using a thin adhesion layer. (2) Repeating a similar process for the 14 - 1 - 11 Zintl p-type leg of the advanced <b>thermoelectric</b> <b>couple.</b> (3) Bonding thick CTE-matched metal plates on the metallized lanthanum telluride and Yb 14 MnSb 11 to form the hot and cold sides of the <b>thermoelectric</b> <b>couple.</b> The calculated conversion efficiency of such an advanced couple would be about 10. 5 percent, about 35 percent better than heritage radioisotope thermoelectric technology that relies on Si-Ge alloys. In addition, unlike Si-Ge alloys, these materials can be combined with many other thermoelectric materials optimized for operation at lower temperatures to achieve conversion efficiency in excess of 15 percent (a factor of 2 increase over heritage technology) ...|$|E

Through the endeavor of many researchers, {{knowledge and understanding of}} streaming potential (SP) have slowly evolved from the original mere recognition of its existence to its present-day quantitative use in many applications such as Enhanced Oil Recovery (EOR), water flooding, intelligent wells, etc. The spontaneous potential acts to maintain overall electroneutrality when a separation of electrical charge occurs in response to gradients in pressure (Electrokinetic), chemical composition (Electrochemical), or temperature (Thermoelectric).

40|$|The study {{works to}} {{formulate}} convenient {{solutions to the}} problem of a <b>thermoelectric</b> <b>couple</b> operating under a time varying condition. Transient operation of a thermoelectric will become increasingly common as thermoelectric technology permits applications in an increasing number of uses. A number of terrestrial applications, in contrast to steady-state space applications, can subject devices to time varying conditions.

40|$|To gain {{a deeper}} {{understanding}} of the operation of a <b>thermoelectric</b> <b>couple</b> a set of analytic solutions have been derived for a variable material property couple and a transient couple. Using an analytic approach, as opposed to commonly used numerical techniques, results in a set of useful design guidelines.

The analytic modeling considers two cases and accounts for 1) material properties which vary with temperature and 2) transient operation of a couple. The variable material property case was handled by means of an asymptotic expansion, which allows for insight into the influence of temperature dependence on different material properties. The variable property work demonstrated the important fact that materials with identical average Figure of Merits can lead to different conversion efficiencies due to temperature dependence of the properties.

40|$|A {{technique}} for suppressing sublimation of key elements from skutterudite compounds in advanced thermoelectric devices has been demonstrated. The {{essence of the}} technique is to cover what would otherwise be the exposed skutterudite surface of such a device with a thin, continuous film of a chemically and physically compatible metal. Although similar to other sublimation-suppression techniques, this technique has been specifically tailored for application to skutterudite antimonides. The primary cause of deterioration of most thermoelectric materials is thermal decomposition or sublimation - one or more elements sublime from the hot side of a <b>thermoelectric</b> <b>couple,</b> changing the stoichiometry of the device. Examples of elements that sublime from their respective thermoelectric materials are Ge from SiGe, Te from Pb/Te, and now Sb from skutterudite antimonides. The skutterudite antimonides of primary interest are CoSb 3 [electron-donor (n) type] and CeFe(3 -x) Co(x) Sb 12 [electron-acceptor (p) type]. When these compounds are subjected to typical operating conditions [temperature of 700 C and pressure < 10 (exp - 5) torr (0. 0013 Pa) ], Sb sublimes from their surfaces, {{with the result that}} Sb depletion layers form and advance toward their interiors. As the depletion layer advances in a given device, the change in stoichiometry diminishes the thermal-to-electric conversion efficiency of the device. The problem, then, is to prevent sublimation, or at least reduce it to an acceptably low level. In preparation for an experiment on suppression of sublimation, a specimen of CoSb 3 was tightly wrapped in a foil of niobium, which was selected for its chemical stability. In the experiment, the wrapped specimen was heated to a temperature of 700 C in a vacuum of residual pressure < 10 (exp - 5) torr (0. 0013 Pa), then cooled and sectioned. Examination of the sectioned specimen revealed that no depletion layer had formed, indicating the niobium foil prevented sublimation of antimony at 700 C. This was a considerable improvement, considering that uncoated CoSb 3 had been found to decompose to form the lowest antimonide at the surface at only 600 C. Evidently, because the mean free path of Sb at the given temperature and pressure was of the order of tens of centimeters, any barrier closer than tens of centimeters (as was the niobium foil) would have suppressed transport of Sb vapor, thereby suppressing sublimation of S...|$|E

40|$|The goal of {{this study}} is to verify the long term {{stability}} of Yb 14 MnSb 11 for high performance <b>thermoelectric</b> (TE) <b>couples.</b> Three main requirements need to be satisfied to ensure the long term stability of thermoelectric couples: 1) stable thermoelectric properties, 2) stable bonding interfaces, and 3) adequate sublimation suppression. The efficiency of the couple is primarily based on the thermoelectric properties of the materials selected for the couple. Therefore, these TE properties should exhibit minimal degradation during the operating period of the <b>thermoelectric</b> <b>couples.</b> The stability of the bonding is quantified by low contact resistances of the couple interfaces. In order to ensure high efficiency, the contact resistances of the bonding interfaces should be negligible. Sublimation suppression is important because the majority of thermoelectric materials used for power generation have peak figures of merit at temperatures where sublimation rates are high. Controlling sublimation is also essential to preserve the efficiency of the couple. During the course of this research, three different life tests were performed with Yb 14 MnSb 11 coupons. TE properties of Yb 14 MnSb 11 exhibited no degradation after 6 months of aging at 1273 K, and the electrical contact resistance between a thin metallization layer and the Yb 14 MnSb 11 remained negligible after 1500 hr aging at 1273 K.
