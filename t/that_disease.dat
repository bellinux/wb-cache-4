5|$|Hippocrates is {{credited}} with being {{the first person to}} believe that diseases were caused naturally, not because of superstition and gods. Hippocrates was credited by the disciples of Pythagoras of allying philosophy and medicine. He separated the discipline of medicine from religion, believing and arguing <b>that</b> <b>disease</b> was not a punishment inflicted by the gods but rather the product of environmental factors, diet, and living habits. Indeed {{there is not a single}} mention of a mystical illness in the entirety of the Hippocratic Corpus. However, Hippocrates did work with many convictions that were based on what is now known to be incorrect anatomy and physiology, such as Humorism.|$|E
5|$|Jennifer Hawke-Petit (born September 26, 1958) was a {{nurse and}} co-director of the health center at Cheshire Academy, a private {{boarding}} school. She met her husband, William Petit, in 1985 on a pediatric rotation at Children's Hospital {{when he was a}} third-year medical student at the University of Pittsburgh and she was a new nurse. Their eldest daughter Hayley (born October 15, 1989) had just graduated from Miss Porter's School and was scheduled to attend Dartmouth College. Hayley had been an active fundraiser for multiple sclerosis research, following Jennifer's diagnosis with <b>that</b> <b>disease.</b>|$|E
5|$|Based on his philanthropic worldview, Clinton {{created the}} William J. Clinton Foundation {{to address issues}} of global importance. This {{foundation}} includes the Clinton Foundation HIV and AIDS Initiative (CHAI), which strives to combat <b>that</b> <b>disease,</b> and {{has worked with the}} Australian government toward that end. The Clinton Global Initiative (CGI), begun by the Clinton Foundation in 2005, attempts to address world problems such as global public health, poverty alleviation and religious and ethnic conflict. In 2005, Clinton announced through his foundation an agreement with manufacturers to stop selling sugared drinks in schools. Clinton's foundation joined with the Large Cities Climate Leadership Group in 2006 to improve cooperation among those cities, and he met with foreign leaders to promote this initiative. The foundation has received donations from a number of governments all over the world, including Asia and the Middle East. In 2008, Foundation director Inder Singh announced deals to reduce the price of anti-malaria drugs by 30percent in developing nations. Clinton also spoke in favor of California Proposition 87 on alternative energy, which was voted down.|$|E

5|$|Bhimsen {{felt the}} need to finish off his rivals, but at the same time, felt a need to take {{precaution}} before going after immediate members of the royal household. For almost two years after returning to Kathmandu, Rana Bahadur had no official position in the government – he was neither a king, nor a regent, nor a minister – yet he felt no qualms in using the full state power. Not only did Rana Bahadur carry out the Baisathi Haran under Bhimsen's advice, he was also able to banish all non-vaccinated children, as well as their parents, from the town during a smallpox outbreak, in order to prevent King Girvan from catching <b>that</b> <b>disease.</b> Now, after almost two-year, all of a sudden Rana Bahadur was made mukhtiyar (chief authority) and Bhimsen tried to implement his schemes through Rana Bahadur. Bhimsen had also secretly learned of a plot to oust Rana Bahadur. Tribhuvan Khawas (Pradhan), a member of Sher Bahadur's faction, was imprisoned on the re-opened charges of conspiracy with the British that led to the Knox's mission, but for which pardon had already been doled out, and was ordered to be executed. Tribhuvan Khawas decided to reveal everyone that was involved in the dialogue with the British. Among those implicated was Sher Bahadur Shah.|$|E
5|$|Carte {{was married}} twice. His first wife was Blanche Julia Prowse (1853–1885), the {{daughter}} of William Prowse, a piano manufacturer, music publisher and booking agent. As a teenager, she had participated in amateur theatricals with Carte. They married in 1870 and had two sons, Lucas (1872–1907) and Rupert. Blanche died of pneumonia in 1885, and in 1888, Carte married his assistant, Helen. Their wedding {{took place in the}} Savoy Chapel, with Arthur Sullivan as the best man. Rupert received training in an accounting firm and then became his father's assistant in 1894. Lucas, who was not involved in the family businesses, became a barrister. He was appointed Private Secretary to Lord Chief Justice Charles Russell in 1899 in connection with the Venezuelan boundary arbitration in Paris. There he contracted tuberculosis and later died of <b>that</b> <b>disease</b> at the age of 34.|$|E
5|$|Diseases {{introduced}} to the Americas by the conquistadors had a great impact upon indigenous populations. As the Spanish were occupied with the conquest of Mexico, these diseases ran ahead of them from 1519 onwards. A smallpox epidemic swept through Guatemala in 1520–1521, and {{is also likely to}} have spread throughout the Pipil region of El Salvador. By the time the Spanish arrived in the area in 1524, it is estimated that up to 50% of the native population of El Salvador had already been eliminated by the new diseases, against which they had no immunity. It is likely <b>that</b> <b>disease</b> had significantly weakened the Pipil by the time they fielded large armies against the Spanish at Acajutla and Tacuzcalco. Further waves of epidemic diseases spread across Mesoamerica in 1545–1548, and again in 1576–1581, reducing indigenous populations to just 10% of their pre-contact levels, making successful resistance against the European colonisers extremely difficult. The deadliest of the newly introduced diseases were smallpox, malaria, measles, typhus, and yellow fever. Their introduction was catastrophic in the Americas; it is estimated that 90% of the indigenous population had been eliminated by disease within the first century of European contact.|$|E
40|$|Using the SIS {{model on}} {{unweighted}} and weighted networks, we consider the disease localization phenomenon. In contrast to the well-recognized point of view <b>that</b> <b>diseases</b> infect a finite fraction of vertices right above the epidemic threshold, we show <b>that</b> <b>diseases</b> can be localized on {{a finite number of}} vertices, where hubs and edges with large weights are centers of localization. Our results follow from the analysis of standard models of networks and empirical data for real-world networks. Comment: 5 pages, 3 figure...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT. In The Nature of <b>Disease</b> I argued <b>that</b> a value-free {{account of}} our concept of disease cannot be given. Part of this {{argument}} consisted in showing <b>that</b> <b>diseases</b> as a class do not constitute a natural kind. To understand this, we need only see that we define and classify conditions into diseases and non-diseases {{not in terms of}} their causes but in terms of their effects. While no philosophical position is watertight, the arguments overwhelmingly favour the conclusion <b>that</b> <b>diseases</b> do not constitute a natural kind...|$|R

5|$|From the 10th century BC onwards, Assyria {{fought for}} control of the {{southern}} Levant. Frequently, cities and kingdoms of the southern Levant appealed to Egypt for aid in their struggles against the powerful Assyrian army. Taharqa enjoyed some initial success in his attempts to regain a foothold in the Near East. Taharqa aided the Judean King Hezekiah when Hezekiah and Jerusalem was besieged by the Assyrian king, Sennacherib. Scholars disagree on the primary reason for Assyria's abandonment of their siege on Jerusalem. Reasons for the Assyrian withdrawal range from conflict with the Egyptian/Kushite army to divine intervention to surrender to disease. Henry Aubin argues that the Kushite/Egyptian army saved Jerusalem from the Assyrians and prevented the Assyrians from returning to capture Jerusalem for the remainder of Sennacherib's life (20 years). Some argue <b>that</b> <b>disease</b> was the primary reason for failing to actually take the city; however, Senacherib's annals claim Judah was forced into tribute regardless.|$|E
5|$|The risk of {{epilepsy}} following meningitis is {{less than}} 10%; <b>that</b> <b>disease</b> more commonly causes seizures during the infection itself. In herpes simplex encephalitis {{the risk of a}} seizure is around 50% with a high risk of epilepsy following (up to 25%). Infection with the pork tapeworm, which can result in neurocysticercosis, is the cause of up to half of epilepsy cases in areas of the world where the parasite is common. Epilepsy may also occur after other brain infections such as cerebral malaria, toxoplasmosis, and toxocariasis. Chronic alcohol use increases the risk of epilepsy: those who drink six units of alcohol per day have a two and a half fold increase in risk. Other risks include Alzheimer's disease, multiple sclerosis, tuberous sclerosis, and autoimmune encephalitis. Getting vaccinated does not increase the risk of epilepsy. Malnutrition is a risk factor seen mostly in the developing world, although it is unclear however if it is a direct cause or an association. People with cerebral palsy have an increased risk of epilepsy, with half of people with spastic quadriplegia and spastic hemiplegia having the disease.|$|E
25|$|Once a {{panel of}} {{associated}} genetic markers have been established for a particular disease {{it can be used}} for all carriers of <b>that</b> <b>disease.</b> In contrast, since even a monogenic disease can be caused by many different mutations within the affected gene, conventional PGD methods based on finding a specific mutation would require mutation-speciﬁc tests. Thus, PGH widens the availability of PGD to cases where mutation-specific tests are unavailable.|$|E

50|$|Severinus {{believed}} <b>that</b> <b>diseases</b> had {{an organic}} cause. He theorized <b>that</b> seeds of <b>disease</b> (semina morborum) are foreign matter {{in a healthy}} body and take root, grow, and disrupt the normally orderly process of bodily functions. These seeds manifest themselves in various places {{in the body and}} produce particular symptoms <b>that</b> identify the <b>disease.</b> In order to restore health, chemically derived remedies could be produced and administered in order to restore bodily harmony.|$|R
25|$|If a {{vaccination}} program successfully reduces the disease threat, it {{may reduce the}} perceived risk of disease as cultural memories {{of the effects of}} <b>that</b> <b>disease</b> fade. At this point, parents may feel they have nothing to lose by not vaccinating their children. If enough people hope to become free-riders, gaining the benefits of herd immunity without vaccination, vaccination levels may drop to a level where herd immunity ceases to be as effective.|$|E
25|$|False negatives {{and false}} positives are {{significant}} issues in medical testing. False negatives {{may provide a}} falsely reassuring message to patients and physicians <b>that</b> <b>disease</b> is absent, when it is actually present. This sometimes leads to inappropriate or inadequate treatment of both the patient and their disease. A common example is relying on cardiac stress tests to detect coronary atherosclerosis, even though cardiac stress tests are known to only detect limitations of coronary artery blood flow due to advanced stenosis.|$|E
25|$|Around 1900, {{different}} salmon {{were introduced}} as sport fish. Only the king salmon (Chinook) {{adapted to the}} environment. For decades, the development of salmon and trout aquaculture in New Zealand was opposed by recreational fishers, on the grounds <b>that</b> <b>disease</b> would spread from fish farms into recreational fisheries, and that wild fish would be poached {{if they could be}} sold. In 1973 the government compromised by making trout farms illegal, but salmon farms legal. New Zealand is probably the only country in the world where trout farming is illegal, despite commercial interest from companies already farming salmon.|$|E

5000|$|Disease as a process: In the 20th century, a third {{concept of}} disease has appeared, {{based on the}} works of Caroline Whitbeck in 1977.

She also argues <b>that</b> <b>diseases</b> are complex processes of which both clinical and underlying pathophysiological manifestations are proper parts (as contrasted with effects).|$|R

25|$|Psychiatry, {{like most}} medical {{specialties}} has a continuing, has significant need for research into its diseases, classifications and treatments. Psychiatry adopts biology's fundamental belief <b>that</b> <b>disease</b> and health are different elements of an individual's adaptation to an environment. But psychiatry also {{recognizes that the}} environment of the human species is complex and includes physical, cultural, and interpersonal elements. In addition to external factors, the human brain must contain and organize an individual's hopes, fears, desires, fantasies and feelings. Psychiatry's difficult task is to bridge the understanding of these factors {{so that they can be}} studied both clinically and physiologically.|$|E
25|$|The former type {{of study}} is purely {{descriptive}} and {{cannot be used}} to make inferences about the general population of patients with <b>that</b> <b>disease.</b> These types of studies, in which an astute clinician identifies an unusual feature of a disease or a patient's history, may lead to formulation of a new hypothesis. Using the data from the series, analytic studies could be done to investigate possible causal factors. These can include case control studies or prospective studies. A case control study would involve matching comparable controls without the disease to the cases in the series. A prospective study would involve following the case series over time to evaluate the disease's natural history.|$|E

25|$|Melbourne in {{the early}} 1850s was a rough and {{primitive}} place with potholed roads.

It was into this environment came men seeking fortunes digging for gold. Within ten years the gold rush had transformed Melbourne from a provincial outpost of the British Empire to a wealthy and rapidly expanding city. Between 1853 and 1854 Melbourne doubled in size, however many of its new and expanding population lived in tented villages within the city.
