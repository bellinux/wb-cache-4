25|$|The Steele sisters come to London {{as guests}} of Mrs Jennings {{and after a}} brief {{acquaintance}} <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>asked</b> to stay at John and Fanny Dashwood's London house. Lucy sees the invitation as a personal compliment, rather than what it is, a slight to Elinor and Marianne who, being family, should have received such invitation first. Too talkative, Anne Steele betrays Lucy's secret. As a result, the Misses Steele are turned out of the house, and Edward is ordered to break off the engagement on pain of disinheritance. Edward refuses to comply and is immediately disinherited in favour of his brother, gaining respect for his conduct, and sympathy from Elinor and Marianne. Colonel Brandon shows his admiration by offering Edward the living of Delaford parsonage, {{so that he can}} marry Lucy as soon as he is ordained.|$|E
25|$|The {{estimates}} of likelihood {{associated with the}} optimistic bias are based on how closely an event matches a person's overall idea of the specific event. Some researchers suggest that the representativeness heuristic is {{a reason for the}} optimistic bias: individuals tend to think in stereotypical categories rather than about their actual targets when making comparisons. For example, when drivers are asked to think about a car accident, {{they are more likely to}} associate a bad driver, rather than just the average driver. Individuals compare themselves with the negative elements that come to mind, rather than an overall accurate comparison between them and another driver. Additionally, when individuals were asked to compare themselves towards friends, they chose more vulnerable friends based on the events they were looking at. Individuals generally chose a specific friend based on whether they resemble a given example, rather than just an average friend. People find examples that relate directly to what <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>asked,</b> resulting in representativeness heuristics.|$|E
30|$|A {{questionnaire}} {{was sent to}} all surgeons listed on the Gynecare database in the UK who were known to or thought to be carrying out TVT (n= 446). The surgeons <b>were</b> <b>asked</b> to identify themselves as gynaecologists or urologists and the institution in which <b>they</b> worked. <b>They</b> <b>were</b> <b>asked</b> approximately how many TVT procedures they carried out annually, whether they carried out preoperative urodynamics and whether they carried out TVT in the outpatient department, day surgery unit or as inpatients. The type of anaesthetic was requested and whether the surgeons used the concept of aqua dissection. The respondents <b>were</b> <b>asked</b> if <b>they</b> used a catheter introducer and, if so, what size catheter <b>they</b> used. <b>They</b> <b>were</b> <b>asked</b> if a cystoscopy was routinely carried out and whether this was carried out after each or both passes of the needle. The surgeons <b>were</b> <b>asked</b> whether <b>they</b> routinely used a cough test and, if so, at what bladder volume. <b>They</b> <b>were</b> <b>asked</b> whether the urethra was checked after {{the removal of the}} plastic sheath to ensure the sling was not too tight and, if so, what size dilator <b>was</b> used. <b>They</b> <b>were</b> <b>asked</b> whether a catheter was inserted at the completion of the procedure and, if so, whether a suprapubic or urethral catheter <b>was</b> used. <b>They</b> <b>were</b> <b>asked</b> what postoperative volume was deemed acceptable for discharge, whether the patients returned for follow-up and, if so, how long postoperatively.|$|R

A definition of a centre of excellence was deliberately not given. Secondly, <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>asked</b> about their management of endometriosis which involved the rectum or prerectal fascia. Finally, <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>asked</b> whether <b>they</b> felt there should be a network of centres of excellence to manage advanced endometriosis, and what services they should offer.

25|$|Articulated {{thoughts}} in stimulated situations (ATSS): ATSS is a paradigm {{which was created}} {{as an alternative to}} the TA (think aloud) method. This method assumes that people have continuous internal dialogues that can be naturally attended to. ATSS also assesses a person’s inner thoughts as they verbalize their cognitions. In this procedure, subjects listen to a scenario via a video or audio player and are asked to imagine that they are in that specific situation. Later, <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>asked</b> to articulate their thoughts as they occur in reaction to the playing scenario. This method is useful in studying emotional experience given that the scenarios used can influence specific emotions. Most importantly, the method has contributed to the study of personality. In a study conducted by Rayburn and Davison (2002), subjects’ thoughts and empathy toward anti-gay hate crimes were evaluated. The researchers found that participants showed more aggressive intentions towards the offender in scenarios which mimicked hate crimes.|$|E
25|$|Self-paced reading: The {{participants}} {{are faced with}} a screen, on which a text appears in successive segment. <b>They</b> <b>are</b> <b>asked</b> to process each sequent segment by pressing a key. A trial starts with the presentation of groups of dashes separated by spaces. Each group serving as a placeholder for a word in the text, which is to be presented on that trial and each dash representing a letter. When the participant subsequently presses the key, the first segment appears, say the first two words, replacing the corresponding placeholders for the right words, while the placeholders for the left words remain on the screen. Once pressing the key again, the two words from the first segment are replaced by their placeholders again and the next segment appears, taking the position of the corresponding placeholders. This continues until the whole text has been read. A follow-up comprehension question is presented to ensure that participants indeed pay attention to the meaning of the sentences. The interval between the two successive key presses is measured and registered as the response time.|$|E

2500|$|According to {{prominent}} historians like Alexander Zimin and Anna Khoroshkevich, {{the continuous}} {{use of the}} term Moscovia was a result of traditional habit and the need to distinguish between the Muscovite and the Lithuanian part of the Rus', {{as well as of the}} political interests of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, which competed with Moscow for the western regions of the Rus'. Due to the propaganda of the Commonwealth, as well as of the Jesuits, the term Moscovia was used instead of Russia in many parts of Europe where prior to the reign of Peter the Great there was a lack of direct knowledge of the country. In Northern Europe and at the court of the Holy Roman Empire, however, the country was known under its own name, Russia or Rossia. Sigismund von Herberstein, ambassador of the Holy Roman Emperor in Russia, used both Russia and Moscovia in his work on the Russian tsardom and noted: [...] "The majority believes that Russia is a changed name of Roxolania. Muscovites ("Russians" [...] in the German version) refute this, saying that their country was originally called Russia (Rosseia)". Pointing to the difference between Latin and Russian names, French captain Jacques Margeret, who served in Russia and left a detailed description of L’Empire de Russie of the early 17th century that was presented to King Henry IV, stated that foreigners make [...] "a mistake when they call them Muscovites and not Russians. When <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>asked</b> what nation they are, they respond 'Russac', which means 'Russians', and when <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>asked</b> what place they are from, the answer is Moscow, Vologda, Ryasan and other cities". The closest analogue of the Latin term Moscovia in Russia was “Tsardom of Moscow”, or “Moscow Tsardom” (...) , which was used along with the name [...] "Russia", sometimes in one sentence, as in the name of the 17th century Russian work On the Great and Glorious Russian Moscow State (...)
