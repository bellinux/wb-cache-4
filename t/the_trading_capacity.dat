40|$|This Master Thesis proposes an {{analytical}} model of commodity trading {{in the presence}} of market power, which is new to the literature. We establish the rational behavior of traders between two markets and derive price spread dynamics based on the trading volumes. We consider two commodity markets that quote different prices for the same product, and a trader capable of purchasing in one market to resell in the other, within a trading capacity. For simplicity, we assume that the inventory present between the two markets is constant, i. e., the amount stored is fixed (and is directly linked to <b>the</b> <b>trading</b> <b>capacity).</b> We first establish the structure of the optimal trading policy. This policy determines, given a realization of the current price spread between the two markets, how much (if any) volume must be bought/sold from/at the first market and sold/bought at/from the second market, so that the long-run average profit is maximized. When optimizing, the trader takes into account its impact on future spreads. We then describe the parameters of the optimal policy and we apply our model to kerosene prices in New York and Los Angeles, and illustrate the insights derived...|$|E

40|$|Valdivia is a Chilean city {{located near}} an estuary system, 800 km south of Santiago. The {{navigation}} {{capacity of the}} Valdivia river mainly determines the present state and future possibilities {{for the welfare of}} the city. Since sedimentation problems arose in the river, the capacity for navigation became limited. The ministry of Valdivia therefore desires a solution for this problem in order to create possibilities for future growth. However, it is not known to what extent solutions for the sedimentation problem will actually contribute to an increase of welfare. By identifying the problem for the Ministry of Public Works of Chile, the boundaries and goal of the project could be set. In this research an attempt is made to answer the following research question: How can the surplus of sediment in the Valdivia river be remedied and to what extent will this contribute to the economic and social values of the city of Valdivia? In order to know how to remedy the surplus of sediment, a qualitative analysis of probable causes of the sedimentation was necessary. The main subjects which were researched by means of data and literature are tidal influence, river discharges, sediment composition and salt intrusion. With this knowledge it was concluded that the directions and magnitudes of flow lines in the river system can give good indications on what locations sedimentation can occur. The interaction between tidal currents and river discharges are the main drivers behind these flow characteristics. To verify the theoretical analysis, a basic Delft 3 D model was set up containing only tidal movement and river discharges. The pattern of the flow lines which was obtained from the Delft 3 D model supports the possibility that sedimentation occurs on the current identified sedimentation locations. Although other hydrological and morphological processes were found to possibly influence sedimentation rates in the river, qualitative data for studying these processes were missing. The current Delft 3 D model is therefore a good result regarding the available data and {{can be seen as a}} part of preliminary research in order to support further studies. Because the exact causes of the sedimentation were not identified in this research, it was not possible to come up with suitable solutions and to research how these solutions could affect the system. However, in order to gain insight in the effects of a river system without sedimentation problems, a fictitious scenario was studied by means of a social cost benefit analysis. The goal of the social costs and benefits analysis was to give insight in what factors should be taken into account when considering a project plan which solves the sedimentation problem. A dredging design was made in order to make the Valdivia river navigable for larger cargo vessels to increase <b>the</b> <b>trading</b> <b>capacity</b> of Valdivia. This dredging design comprises the deepening of the Valdivia river to a minimum water depth of 10 meters. Considering investment and maintenance costs of the dredging activities of this magnitude, it is concluded that the costs are not profitable compared to the social and economic effects of a higher traffic intensity on the river. With the social costs and benefits analysis all effects of solving the sedimentation problem are inventoried. When the Delft 3 D model can identify what the remedy of the sedimentation could be, the impact on the economic and social values of Valdivia can be determined. This research was not sufficient to answer the research question. Both the Delft 3 D model and the SCBA model were lacking accurate and reliable data. To expand this research, it is necessary to collect the data of which an overview has been made. Therefore, this research can serve as a preliminary study for further research. It is recommended that after data collection, solutions will be identified which can solve the sedimentation problem. These solutions need to be compared with a scenario analysis in order to decide on which is the most suitable solution for the sedimentation problem. Besides this, it is advised to research whether it is actually necessary to expand the river for transport when looking at all actors involved. Multidisciplinary Projec...|$|E

40|$|Magister Legum - LLMThe {{provisions}} of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT 1994) generally give favourable consideration to developing and least developed countries. 1 Firstly, {{at the core of}} these provisions is the principle of special and differential treatment of these countries. As such developing countries are to meet their obligations under the WTO agreements as and when the special needs of their economies permit. The GATT 1994 provisions exempt least developed countries from participating in the obligations under the WTO agreements until such a time that they attain a reasonable level of development. Secondly, the Ministerial Meeting in Doha in November 2001 adopted a development agenda (that described capacity building activities as “core elements of the development dimension of <b>the</b> multilateral <b>trading</b> system”) and called for more co-ordinated delivery of trade related technical assistance and capacity building. 2 In this regard, developed members of the WTO have committed to provide technical assistance to developing and least developed members in order to build their capacity to participate effectively under the WTO. The reality of {{the situation on the ground}} is that developing and least developed countries still face a lot of challenges which hinder their full participation and realization of the benefits under <b>the</b> multilateral <b>trading</b> system. It must be appreciated, at the same time that developing countries like China and India have been active and influential in <b>the</b> multilateral <b>trading</b> system, and additionally, their economies have and are experiencing overt growth. What lessons does Africa need to learn from China and India?This study examines the causes of the poor performance of Sub Saharan Africa’s developing and Least Developed Countries in <b>the</b> multilateral <b>trading</b> system. In this regard, examples are drawn from two countries, namely, Kenya and Zambia. Further, the study examines the initiatives the WTO provides to enhance <b>the</b> <b>trade</b> <b>capacity</b> of its developing and least developed members. In addition, the study examines African <b>trade</b> <b>capacity</b> building initiatives such the New Partnership for Africa’s Development (NEPAD) and the African Capacity Building Foundation (ACBF) Initiatives, as well as the African Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA) Initiative in order to establish how these initiatives can assist in enhancing <b>the</b> <b>trade</b> <b>capacity</b> of developing and least developed countries. The study further examines the role of regional trade integration in enhancing <b>the</b> <b>trade</b> <b>capacity</b> building of developing and least developed countries. In this case, examples are drawn from the Southern Africa Development Community (SADC) and the Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa-Developing Countries (COMESA). In this regard, the study concludes that fully-fledged regional integration has the potential to promote economic growth and industrial development in Africa. The study also demonstrates the importance of the participation of governments and the private sector in improving a country’s participation in <b>the</b> multilateral <b>trading</b> system. This study particularly takes key interest in the crucial role of the public-private partnerships in enhancing competitive forces and competitiveness necessary to maximize trade opportunities, which in turn produces economic development. It is observed and concluded in this study that sustainably financed technical assistance and capacity building programmes have important roles to play in so far as integration of Sub Saharan Africa into <b>the</b> global <b>trading</b> system is concerned; and that developing countries in general and LDCs in particular are to be provided with enhanced Trade-Related Technical Assistance (TRTA) and capacity building to increase their effective participation in the negotiations, to facilitate their implementation of GATT/WTO rules and to enable them adjust and diversify their economies...|$|R

40|$|The WTO Dispute Settlement System (DSS) {{has often}} been cited as {{especially}} important for smaller or poorer developing countries that traditionally lack political or economic power to pursue their interests in a power-based system. In practice, however, the WTO DSS has predominantly been used by developed WTO members, such as the United States (US) and the European Union (EU). There {{are only a few}} proactive developing country users of the system, typically more advanced economies such as Brazil and China. Pakistan, a weak economy, and one of the WTO’s original developing country members, fits this general pattern, with limited participation in the WTO DSS. As this thesis explains, Pakistan’s modest use of the WTO DSS can be attributed not only to its small proportion of global trade but, more significantly, to its limited <b>trade</b> <b>capacity</b> to pursue cases in the WTO DSS. These <b>trade</b> <b>capacity</b> limitations include inadequate institutional, informational, human, financial and legal resources, which are needed to litigate effectively in the WTO DSS. Current WTO institutional support is limited to address <b>the</b> <b>trade</b> <b>capacity</b> issues of countries like Pakistan, and reform of the WTO DSS seems far-fetched. Pakistan, thus, has to enhance its <b>trade</b> <b>capacity</b> resources independently within existing constraints, in order to make better use of the current WTO DSS. Public–Private Partnerships (PPPs), or government–business resource sharing, have been cited as a factor in the US, the EU and Brazil’s enhancing of their <b>trade</b> <b>capacity</b> and success in WTO litigation. Developing countries such as Pakistan, on the other hand, have made only limited use of PPPs. The academic literature examining in detail their use of PPPs is also fairly sparse. This thesis, therefore, examines PPPs as a means of addressing Pakistan’s <b>trade</b> <b>capacity</b> issues. <b>The</b> thesis identifies the significance of PPPs for Pakistan in WTO litigation, and examines Pakistan’s current arrangements and potential barriers to the formation of effective PPPs. Most importantly, it explains how a poor economy like Pakistan can adopt PPPs successfully fitting in its unique needs and circumstances, and concludes that PPPs show great potential for other developing counties in similar situations...|$|R

Contrary to some widely-held view, it argues that natural resources are not necessarily a ‘curse’ that condemns low-income countries to underdevelopment but can {{provide a basis for}} sustained export-led growth. Natural resource-based sectors have potential for export diversification. <b>The</b> OECD ‘mirror’ <b>trade</b> data indeed suggest that many different routes to diversification exist, including resource-based manufacturing and processing of primary products. However, these opportunities are far from being exploited in many low-income countries.

It is very favourable for the national logistics industry that there are four pan-European corridors going across the country and that companies developed at regional level during the past few years.

40|$|This article {{addresses}} <b>the</b> <b>capacity</b> of <b>trade</b> {{marks to}} provide assurance concerning product {{quality and the}} importance of this capacity in promoting competition and various forms of innovation. It considers the meaning of “quality” in this context and shows how this can include the aesthetic and intangible characteristics of products as well as their functional and material characteristics. And it is suggested that quality assurance should cover the whole range of variable product characteristics to which at least some consumers attach value. This is because the key economic problem that underlies the need for this assurance is the difficulty that consumers may face in ascertaining or verifying {{the presence or absence of}} certain product characteristics. This article explains this problem of information asymmetry and shows how trade marks enable firms to mitigate it by providing quality assurance. As a matter of law, a trade mark merely guarantees that there is unitary control over the quality of marked products. The force behind a trade mark’s quality assurance is economic in nature and depends on its owner’s interest in maximizing <b>the</b> <b>trade</b> mark’s value as a marketing resource. There are various ways in which the owner can build up this value. These include investing in advertising and other promotional activity and in developing <b>the</b> <b>trade</b> mark’s <b>capacity</b> to confer intangible quality on marked products by establishing an image or particular set of associations for it. This explains the dynamic nature of a <b>trade</b> mark’s <b>capacity</b> to provide quality assurance.

Moreover, the country needs to make changes to fiscal incentives related to <b>trade</b> performance before <b>the</b> deadline established by the WTO of December 2015. Policy options include: (i) efforts in trade liberalization, to include reduction of tariffs, reduction of trade licenses, and elimination of environmental tax and revenue replacement duties; (ii) measures to strengthen <b>the</b> institutional <b>capacity</b> (<b>trade</b> and agriculture); (iii) a menu of options {{for a new generation}} of incentives; (iv) nonfiscal measures to increase export performance, particularly in the services sector; and (v) options to enhance trade facilitation and reduce cost of trade in goods. ...|$|R

40|$|A {{manufacturer}} writes {{supply contracts}} with N buyers. Then, the buyers invest in innovation, and the manufacturer builds capacity. Finally, demand is realized, and the firms renegotiate the supply contracts {{to achieve an}} efficient allocation of capacity among the buyers. The court remedy for breach of contract (specific performance versus expectation damages) affects how the firms share the gain from renegotiation, and hence how the firms make investments ex ante. The firms may also engage in renegotiation design, inserting simple clauses into the supply contract to shape the outcome of renegotiation. For example, when a buyer grants a financial "hostage" to the manufacturer or is charged a per diem penalty for delay in bargaining, the manufacturer captures the gain from renegotiation. "Tradable options," which grant buyers <b>the</b> right to <b>trade</b> <b>capacity</b> without intervention from the manufacturer, return the gain from renegotiation to the buyers. This paper proves that, under surprisingly general conditions, the firms can coordinate their investments with the simplest of supply contracts (fixed-quantity contracts). This may require renegotiation design, and certainly requires that the firms understand the breach remedy and set their contract parameters accordingly. © 2007 INFORMS...|$|R
