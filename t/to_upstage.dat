5|$|The {{palladium}} core in the arc reactor {{that keeps}} Stark alive and powers the armor is slowly poisoning him, and he cannot find a substitute. Growing increasingly reckless and despondent about his impending death, and {{choosing not to}} tell anyone about his condition, Stark appoints his personal assistant Pepper Potts CEO of Stark Industries, and hires Stark employee Natalie Rushman to replace her as his personal assistant. Stark competes in the Monaco Historic Grand Prix, where he is attacked {{in the middle of}} the race by Vanko, who wields electrified whips. Stark dons his Mark V armor and defeats Vanko, but the suit is severely damaged. Vanko explains his intention was to prove to the world that Iron Man is not invincible. Impressed by Vanko's performance, Stark's rival, Justin Hammer, fakes Vanko's death while breaking him out of prison and asks him to build a line of armored suits <b>to</b> <b>upstage</b> Stark. During what he believes is his final birthday party, Stark gets drunk while wearing the Mark IV suit. Disgusted, U.S. Air Force Lieutenant Colonel James Rhodes dons Stark's Mark II prototype armor and tries to restrain him. The fight ends in a stalemate, so Rhodes confiscates the Mark II for the U.S. Air Force.|$|E

25|$|The War Committee met (3 November 1916) without Robertson, so Lloyd George could, in Hankey’s words “air {{his views}} freely unhampered by the {{presence}} of that old dragon Robertson”. He complained that the Allies had not achieved any definite success, that the Germans had recovered the initiative, had conquered most of Romania, had increased her forces in the East (after increased mobilisation the German Army had increased in size from 169 ½ divisions on 1 June to 197 divisions (of which 70 were in the East, up from 47 ½ on 1 June)) and still had 4 million men in reserve. On this occasion Asquith backed him and the committee’s conclusion, which was neither printed nor circulated, was that “The offensive on the Somme, if continued next year, was not likely to lead to decisive results, and that the losses might make too heavy a drain on our resources having regard to the results to be anticipated.” It was agreed to consider offensives in other theatres. The ministers again (7 November) discussed, after Robertson had left the room, the plan to send Robertson to a conference in Russia (all except possibly McKenna were in favour) and a further inter-Allied conference <b>to</b> <b>upstage</b> the forthcoming conference of generals at Chantilly. Robertson rejected the idea as “the Kitchener dodge” and was angry at the discussion behind his back and, concerned that Lloyd George wanted to “play hanky panky”, refused to go.|$|E

[...] Radio Free Europe reports that an unnamed diplomatic source told that several NATO leaders, including Latvian president Vaira Vike-Freiberga, had tried to make arrangements for bilateral talks concerning this topic with Russian president Vladimir Putin during the summit, but Putin instead attended the CIS energy summit in Minsk, Belarus on 28 November 2006. In contrast, The Independent reported that the summit was marred by a diplomat fracas over an invitation to President Vladimir Putin and that he was eventually not invited, and that Putin as a result threatened that he would visit Latvia {{for the first time since}} independence during the summit in order <b>to</b> <b>upstage</b> the summit. It was even proposed that Putin could honour French president Jacques Chirac, who was at the summit and whose 74th birthday coincided with the summit, by visiting Latvia.

40|$|International audienceIntroduction of {{sentinel}} node biopsy (SNB) as an axillary staging {{procedure in}} breast cancer patients could have led <b>to</b> <b>upstaging</b> as well as downstaging of their disease. Intensified pathological processing could have led <b>to</b> <b>upstaging</b> due <b>to</b> presence of micrometastases, whereas the described false negative rate of 5 % could be a cause of downstaging. We investigated {{whether or not the}} introduction of the sentinel node procedure has changed the incidence of axillary nodal micrometastases and induced stage migration on a population based level. Data from the population based Eindhoven Cancer Registry were used on all ( =  17100) women diagnosed with invasive breast cancer in the South-East region of The Netherlands in the period 1994 – 2005. The percentage of patients staged with SNB increased from 0 % in 1994 to 62 % in 2005. The percentage of patients with micrometastases increased from 1. 0 % in 1994 to 4. 3 % in 2005 ( <  0. 0001), whereas no significant increase was observed of the proportion of patients with positive axillary lymph nodes. After adjustment for tumor size, age at diagnosis and histology the probability of having a positive axillary lymph node status was 10 % higher in period 2003 – 2005, as compared to period 1994 – 1996. Furthermore, women diagnosed in the period 2003 – 2005 had a 3. 5  times higher risk of having micrometastases compared to women diagnosed in the period 1994 – 1996 (i. e., before the introduction of SNB). The introduction of SNB in the Southeast region of The Netherlands has led to stage migration, as is reflected by the small but significant increase of the proportion of patients with positive axillary lymph nodes after adjustment for tumor size and age...|$|R

40|$|Dr. Suardi’s {{editorial}} {{highlights the}} need for studies on the best diagnostic strategy to adopt in the active surveillance (AS) era [1]. The more important issue is stressed {{in the title of}} his editorial: Could the selection of patients be perfect? AS entails a strategy by which selected men are managed expectantly with the intention of applying potentially curative treatment in case of signs of progres-sion. Prospective AS studies are emerging, and the literature also offers important data from series ofwatchful waiting management [2, 3]. AS strategy has changed the treatment and management of low-risk prostate cancers but must also evolve the diagnostic tool. Indeed, the proportion of patients treated due <b>to</b> <b>upstaging</b> or <b>to</b> prostate-specific antigen (PSA) rising during follow-up is substantial {{because of a lack of}} perfect initial staging [4]...|$|R

2500|$|George Low, the Manager of the Apollo Spacecraft Program Office, {{proposed}} a solution in August 1968.

30|$|In conclusion, {{hysteroscopy}} {{is highly}} accurate and clinically {{useful in the}} diagnosis of endometrial cancer. There is a slightly higher percentage of positive peritoneal cytology in endometrial cancer patients diagnosed with high-pressure hysteroscopy compared to patients diagnosed with low-pressure hysteroscopy due to transtubal reflux of endometrial cells and tissue into the peritoneal cavity. However, positive peritoneal cytology is not an independent prognostic factor in patients with endometrial cancer and, even if it leads <b>to</b> <b>upstaging</b> of a minority of endometrial carcinoma patients, {{it does not appear}} to affect their overall outcome. Moreover, endometrial cancer cells found in the peritoneal cavity in cases of hysteroscopy performed in endometrial cancer patients, although they experimentally show a functional viability, in clinical practice they seem to disappear in a short time and to have a low malignant potential. In cases that endometrial cancer is suspected, spilling can be reduced by a low intrauterine pressure of up to 70  mmHg, as tubal dye perfusion in chromopertubation requires a mean pressure of around 100  mmHg [46].|$|R
