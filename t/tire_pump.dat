50|$|The {{origins of}} the company {{date back to the}} 1948 {{establishment}} of the metal-working company Koma in West Germany. Originally producing bicycle <b>tire</b> <b>pumps,</b> the company branched out into the production of air pistols in 1950. In 1955, Koma was renamed Voere. The company's name is a combination of the founders' names: Voetter and Restle. That year, Voere began the production of small-bore rifles.|$|R
50|$|The {{transportation}} items {{may include}} bicycles with off-road tires and suspension, emergency tools and spare auto parts (e.g., fuses, fan belts, light bulbs, head light, <b>tire</b> <b>pump,</b> etc.), and an inflatable raft with paddles.|$|E
50|$|On October 24, 1901, her 63rd birthday, {{the barrel}} was put {{over the side}} of a rowboat, and Taylor climbed in, along with her lucky {{heart-shaped}} pillow. After screwing down the lid, friends used a bicycle <b>tire</b> <b>pump</b> to compress the air in the barrel. The hole used for this was plugged with a cork, and Taylor was set adrift near the American shore, south of Goat Island.|$|E
50|$|Elizalde {{caused a}} {{sensation}} in 1920, by beginning {{production of a}} 50/60cv straight-eight known as the Tipo 48 - {{one of the first}} cars in this configuration to go into production. Its 8143 cc power unit had four valves per cylinder and incorporated a <b>tire</b> <b>pump.</b> This pump doubled as a vacuum cleaner to be used on the car's interior. A 5181 cc straight-eight Gran Sport version of this model, capable of reaching 160 km/h, was also offered.|$|E
5000|$|Motor {{vehicles}} are normally equipped for changing a tire. These tools include a jack, a tire iron or lug wrench, and a spare <b>tire.</b> Air <b>pumps</b> run by hand-lever, pressure cans, or electricity {{can be used}} to re-inflate slow-leaking tires.|$|R
60|$|While Dick and Sam jacked up {{the axle}} of the {{automobile}} {{and put on a}} new tire--inner tube and shoe combined--Sam set to work and cleaned up the roadway, throwing all the glass into the bushes. Then the new <b>tire</b> was <b>pumped</b> up and tested.|$|R
2500|$|At mid-century {{there were}} two {{predominant}} bicycle styles for recreational cyclists in North America. Heavyweight cruiser bicycles, preferred by the typical (hobby) cyclist, featuring balloon tires, pedal-driven [...] "coaster" [...] brakes and only one gear, were popular for their durability, comfort, streamlined appearance, and a significant array of accessories (lights, bells, springer forks, speedometers, etc..). Lighter cycles, with hand brakes, narrower tires, and a three-speed hub gearing system, often imported from England, first became popular in the United States in the late 1950s. These comfortable, practical bicycles usually offered generator-powered headlamps, safety reflectors, kickstands, and frame-mounted <b>tire</b> <b>pumps.</b> In the United Kingdom, {{like the rest of}} Europe, cycling was seen as less of a hobby, and lightweight but durable bikes had been preferred for decades.|$|R
5000|$|When a {{professional}} Italian cycling team {{comes to town}} for a race, Dave is thrilled to be competing with them. However, the Italians become irked when Dave is {{able to keep up}} with them. One of them jams a <b>tire</b> <b>pump</b> in Dave's wheel, causing him to crash, which leaves him disillusioned and depressed upon realizing that the reason the Italians were winning races was because they were cheating. He subsequently confesses his deception to Katherine, who tearfully slaps him before storming off.|$|E
50|$|By 1914, Ethridge's {{population}} {{had grown to}} 400, and the town thrived as a lumber transloading station. The town was home to at least four lumber mills and one lumber finishing mill. Lumber from these mills and mills further out in the countryside was hauled to Ethridge and loaded onto trains. During this period, Ethridge had five grocery stores, a meat market, two barber shops, a post office, a hotel, and a <b>tire</b> <b>pump</b> factory. The town declined, however, following the Wall Street Crash of 1929 and the gradual supplanting of rail traffic by vehicle traffic in later years. Ethridge incorporated in 1973.|$|E
50|$|Donald drives {{deeper into}} the {{woodland}} and finds a spot where to sleep on an air mattress. After struggling to get the mattress inflated (failing twice with a <b>tire</b> <b>pump</b> before blowing it up himself) Donald gets ready to rest but is bothered by a rock underneath the mattress. He throws the rock away sending {{it up to a}} hill where it causes a chain reaction that sends a huge boulder towards Donald, who is woken up and panics trying to escape on his car. The boulder crushes him against a tree and Donald's vehicle is turned into a 1800s car-looking wreck.|$|E

Thus, making a perfect adiabatic compressor would require perfect heat insulation of all parts of the machine. For example, even a bicycle <b>tire</b> <b>pump's</b> metal tube becomes hot as you compress the air to fill a tire.|$|R
40|$|A project reportWe have {{designed}} this project {{keeping in mind}} the current needs of the automobile industry. This industry has been evolving many technologies {{in the past and}} foresees further advancements in the coming years. The title of our project is ‘Design and Stress Analysis of Rear Axle of Go-kart and Instantaneous <b>Tire</b> <b>Pumping</b> System’. Both these parts of our projects are inter related with each other. Air pressure in the tire {{is also one of the}} major cause of accidents and is difficult to repair at remote places. The axle being the integral part of an automobile needs to withstand all the forces which shall act on it during its operation. ITPS has also been integrated with the automobile axle assembly so as to achieve the benefits of maintaining an optimum tire pressure system...|$|R
50|$|Pounds {{per square}} inch {{absolute}} (psia) is used {{to make it clear}} that the pressure is relative to a vacuum rather than the ambient atmospheric pressure. Since atmospheric pressure at sea level is around 14.7 psi, this will be added to any pressure reading made in air at sea level. The converse is pounds {{per square inch}} gauge or pounds per square inch gauge (psig), indicating that the pressure is relative to atmospheric pressure. For example, a bicycle <b>tire</b> <b>pumped</b> up to 65 psi above local atmospheric pressure (say, 14.7 psia locally), will have a pressure of 65 + 14.7 = 79.7 psia or 65 psig. When gauge pressure is referenced to something other than ambient atmospheric pressure, then the units would be pounds per square inch differential (psid).|$|R

50|$|Tools {{and owner}} {{servicing}} were well thought out. The R65 came standard {{with a full}} tool kit, {{as well as a}} hand-operated <b>tire</b> <b>pump.</b> Owner maintenance is standard practice with these machines. Valve lash was adjusted by a simple set screw-and-locknut arrangement, and timing was taken care of by adjustment of the points' housing. On later models (i.e., model year 1981 onward), the points were no longer used and a Hall sensor was placed inside the housing, this housing behind the front engine cover is colloquially known as the 'bean can'. Most other maintenance tasks were easily achieved due to easy access to most mechanicals.|$|E
5000|$|There are {{two main}} types of tire valves to which the bicycle <b>tire</b> <b>pump</b> attaches. These are the Presta valve and the Schrader valve. Some pumps fit both types of valves, whereas others do not, but {{adapters}} are available that enable the pump to fit any type of valve. [...] "All valves adjustable connecting systems," [...] also known as AVACS, enable the pump to fit any type of valve found on a bicycle, and {{it also has the}} capacity to fit onto other universal inflatable products, such as balls, paddling pools, and rubber rings. The AVACS feature is commonly available on pump models and can also be bought as a separate valve attachment.|$|E

30|$|The first {{experiment}} {{examines the}} effects of creating visual or verbal explanations on the comprehension of a bicycle <b>tire</b> <b>pump’s</b> operation in participants with low and high spatial ability. Although the pump itself is not invisible, the components crucial to its function, notably the inlet and outlet valves, {{and the movement of}} air, are located inside the pump. It was predicted that visual explanations would include more information than verbal explanations, particularly structural information, since their construction encourages completeness and the production of a whole mechanical system. It was also predicted that functional information would be biased towards a verbal format, since much of the function of the pump is hidden and difficult to express in pictures. Finally, it was predicted that high spatial ability participants would be able to produce more complete explanations and would thus also demonstrate better performance on the post-test. Explanations were coded for structural and functional content, essential features, invisible features, arrows, and multiple steps.|$|R

50|$|The {{automatic}} transmission model {{would soon be}} discontinued, with only 700 built; it was widely criticized, it was too difficult for Soviet drivers to maintain, there were few service stations {{to do the work}} and few private mechanics qualified, and there was a shortage of transmission oil. From 1958, a three-speed manual, with synchromesh on the top two gears, was the only transmission available; this would be the M21V, while the taxi became the M21A. (The automatic would be used in the low-production GAZ-13 Chaika, which would also be maintained by professionals.) Standard equipment on all models included spare parts and two tool kits, with spanners, wrenches, screwdrivers, a <b>tire</b> <b>pump,</b> and a cans of paint to fix minor dings.|$|E
5000|$|In 1909 Arturo Elizalde Rouvier {{started a}} company was called [...] "Sociedad Mercantil J. M. Vallet y Cia" [...] to {{manufacturer}} car parts.A prototype called the Tipo 11 {{was launched in}} mid-1914.In 1915, King Alfonso XIII owned a 20cv Biada-Elizalde cabriolet Tipo 20.A 25cv sports version of the Tipo 20 was produced in 1919 as the Reine Victoria (name of the Queen consorts). It {{is believed to be}} the first Spanish car to feature four-wheel brakes.In 1920 the company started production of the four-cylinder, 3,817 cc, Model 29. Variants of this model were built until 1927.Production of the 8,143 cc straight-eight model, known as the Tipo 48, also began in 1920.The car had a built in <b>tire</b> <b>pump</b> which could also be used as a vacuum cleaner.A 5,181 cc straight-eight Gran Sport version of the Tipo 48 model, capable of 100 mph (160 km/h), was also produced.Production of Elizalde cars ceased in 1928.|$|E
50|$|Libby and Burnett make {{a plan to}} elope to San Francisco together, but Libby {{has to go to}} {{the farm}} to get some clothes and {{supplies}} on the way. When she comes home she finds, to her surprise, that her parents have reconciled. They tell her that there is a posse out looking for Burnett, to bring him back to prison. The posse arrives to the farm while Libby is there and she has no way of escaping and returning to Burnett in the cabin. When Burnett doesn't hear from her he comes to the farm late at night, looking for her. He finds her and she hides him in the barn, and there, in the night, Libby and Burnett fall hopelessly in love with each other. Libby's parents are not aware that Burnett is hiding in the barn. Later Burnett are nearly discovered by Barker, who is part of the posse, when he goes out to find a <b>tire</b> <b>pump.</b> Libby intercepts him and saves Burnett at the last second.|$|E
50|$|In 1946 {{the firm}} reorganized and diversified its activities, {{beginning}} its production of industrial equipment {{without giving up}} firearms manufacturing. New products consisted mainly in <b>tires,</b> hydraulic <b>pumps</b> and machine tools for the textile industry. For the weapons production, it obtained new machines and started research projects in order to renew its range. The Astra Model 3000 {{was the result of}} one of them and its production begins the following year.|$|R
50|$|Running {{off into}} the jungle, the monkey {{encounters}} the hitch-hiker gorilla from before, and tells of its abuse by Buddy. Walking proudly, the gorilla and the monkey enter the village after pummeling the native guarding the gate. The gorilla approaches Buddy as he inflates a tire; Buddy obviously fears the beast. After a brief scuffle near the <b>tire</b> and air <b>pump,</b> Buddy flees to a nearby guard tower, to which the gorilla chases him, with the <b>tire</b> and <b>pump</b> as a flail. The tire, upon being flung, bounces back, striking the gorilla and knocking the adversary into a tree. The tree bends backward under the gorilla's weight and sends the creature flying into the guard tower. The tower breaks, trapping Buddy and his rival under the rubble. The little monkey comes over to squawk in complaint. In response, the gorilla strikes the tire from before, which is still attached to the air pump. The pump's lever extends such and sends the monkey flying far into the distance. Buddy and the beast shake hands {{in a sort of}} triumph.|$|R
50|$|Ashley were {{manufacturer}} of body shells and chassis for specials from 1955 to 1962. They also offered {{a range of}} products for special builders: radiators, header tanks, lighting sets, steel tubing, sheet aluminium, various suspension parts, water <b>pumps,</b> <b>tires,</b> tubes and wheels. The company also made bonnets and hardtops for other mass-produced sports cars, including the Austin-Healey Sprite and Jaguar E-Type.|$|R
5000|$|The 1913 Model 48 was a {{left-hand}} steering tourer with a {{cast aluminum}} body and electric headlights and horn, {{as well as}} electric courtesy lights for the dash and doors. It used a 573 in3 (9,382 cc) (4½×6-inch, 114×152 mm) T-head straight-six engine of between 48 and 80 hp (36 and 60 kW) with dual-plug ignition and electric starter. It had a 145 in (3683 mm) wheelbase (long for the era) and 36×4½-inch (91×11.4 cm) front/37×5-inch (94×12.7 cm) rear wheels (which interchanged front and rear) and full-elliptic front and ¾-elliptic rear springs. Like most cars of the era, it came complete with a tool kit; in Marmon's case, it offered jack, power <b>tire</b> <b>pump,</b> chassis oiler, tire patch kit, and trouble light. The 48 came {{in a variety of}} models: two-, four-, five-, and seven-passenger tourers at US$5,000, seven-passenger limousine at US$6,250, seven-passenger landaulette at US$6,350, and seven-passenger Berlin limousine at US$6,450. (By contrast, a Colt Runabout was US$1,500, an Enger 40 US$2,000, and American's base model was US$4,250.) ...|$|E
50|$|This {{is also a}} 2-player game. One player will pump {{air into}} a {{vertical}} tube using what resembles a bicycle <b>tire</b> <b>pump,</b> while another player stands on an approximately 1 meter ledge. When the object inside the tube reaches the top, a series of track lights will come towards the player standing on the ledge. It is then his job to jump off the ledge {{in such a way}} that he will land on the ground below precisely when the track lights reach his platform. The faster the first player can pump air to get the object to the top of the vertical tube the slower the lights will travel, allowing a better chance the second player will trap the track lights below; The timer counts up to a maximum of 30 seconds, with the light's speed increasing after 8, 13, 18, and 23 seconds. The team has 8 attempts, and 3 successful trials wins them a coin. If a team of more than two players is competing, then each player (other than the player operating the pump) has their own platform, and all players must trap their lights to be successful. In such an event, the team's goal may be reduced.|$|E
5000|$|The Cavalcade {{features}} a 16 valve DOHC 1360 cc V4 with hydraulic lash adjusters and shaft drive for low maintenance. Many {{of the standard}} features on the Cavalcade were considered options on other motorcycles in 1985. The LX and LXE models feature self-cancelling turn signals, automatic rear pneumatic leveling system, rear suspension load pre-tensioner, air-adjustable damping on the front shocks that could be refilled with a standard <b>tire</b> <b>pump</b> connection, electronic cruise control, radio and cassette deck with LCD station display, volume and station selection controls on the handlebars, adjustment knob for the headlight, adjustable passenger floorboards, fore to aft top case adjustment for passenger comfort, adjustable handlebars and adjustable windshield. The radio is in a decorative housing that resembles a standard motorcycle fuel tank. The radio has an automatic volume control that raises and lowers the radio volume based on {{the speed of the}} motorcycle. The Cavalcade fuel tank is located under the driver's seat but is filled {{from the top of the}} decorative tank. A standard automobile-type oil filter is located midline of the underside of the chassis between the exhaust pipes. The engine is liquid cooled with a thermostatically-controlled electric fan. The radio antenna could be unscrewed and lowered so as not to interfere with the positioning of the weather cover, which was standard with all models.|$|E
50|$|In {{its most}} basic form, a bicycle pump {{functions}} via a hand-operated piston. During the up-stroke, this piston draws air through a one-way valve into the pump from the outside. During the down-stroke, the piston then displaces the air from the pump into the bicycle <b>tire.</b> Most floor <b>pumps,</b> also commonly called track pumps, have a built in pressure gauge to indicate tire pressure.|$|R

"Gentlemen, {{it is to}} be premised, {{that this}} {{mechanical}} operation can only apply to those parts of the narrative which are at present composed out of commonplaces, such as the love-speeches of the hero, the description of the heroine's person, the moral observations of all sorts, and the distribution of happiness {{at the conclusion of the}} piece. Mr. Dousterswivel has sent me some drawings, which go far to show, that by placing the words and phrases technically employed on these subjects, in a sort of framework, like that of the Sage of Laputa, and changing them by such a mechanical process as that by which weavers of damask alter their patterns, many new and happy combinations cannot fail to occur, while the author, <b>tired</b> of <b>pumping</b> his own brains, may have an agreeable relaxation in the use of his fingers." ...|$|R
50|$|Reed {{organs and}} {{harmoniums}} {{of the late}} nineteenth and early twentieth centuries featured a pair of bellows pedals at the base of the instrument. When the pedals were pumped up and down, air was drawn across the organ’s reeds, producing sound. This capability made the harmonium widely available to homes and small churches, though the dynamic range tended to be limited (not to mention that the organist would eventually <b>tire</b> from <b>pumping).</b> However, these free-reed organs had several ways of controlling their volume and expression. Unlike a pipe organ with a blower, the wind pressure of the reed organ can be directly controlled by varying the speed the bellows are operated with the feet, providing a means of producing softer or harsher tones. Harmoniums (where the bellows provided a positive pressure) usually had an air reservoir to reduce the effort needed to pump the bellows when many stops were engaged.|$|R
