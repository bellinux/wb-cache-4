However, <b>the</b> <b>king</b> <b>was</b> {{ultimately}} unable to overcome objections from the Polish-Lithuanian Sejm, who were unwilling to fight Sweden after the Treaty of Sztumska Wieś. The Russians, unable to see benefit in such an alliance, were also unenthusiastic, and the proposed alliance came to nothing.|$|E

If you say <b>the</b> <b>king</b> cannot <b>be</b> criticised, it means that <b>the</b> <b>king</b> <b>is</b> not human.

5|$|Although {{the veto}} {{question}} became central, the ministers were {{not out of}} the spotlight. Since the ministers were inferior to the King within the executive branch, <b>the</b> <b>King</b> <b>was</b> responsible for all actions conducted by this branch; however, the ministers were responsible for the advice given to the King when they were assembled in the Council of State. If any ministers were to dissent, according to the Constitution, they had to state this explicitly in the meeting protocol, lest they be considered in agreement and thus co-responsible. <b>The</b> <b>King</b> <b>was</b> above the law, but the Prime Minister and his cabinet could be tried for Impeachment for advising the King to act out an unconstitutional veto. The Impeachment Court consisted of Supreme Court Justices and elected politicians from the Lagting, and as the latter group held a two-thirds majority, an Impeachment trial with a fairly certain outcome could start as soon as the liberals won control over the Lagting seats through general elections.|$|E
5|$|At Doncaster, {{the king}} awaited Montagu, {{who was in}} the north raising a {{substantial}} force in Edward's name. Edward waited; but on 29 September 1470, marching to the King, Montagu declared for Warwick. His last-minute, surprise defection from the king has been called 'decisive'. <b>The</b> <b>king</b> <b>was</b> trapped; disbanding his army, and with a few followers, he escaped to Bishop's Lynn, sailing for Burgundy on 2 October.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} {{the third}} day, Charles was removed from the court, which then heard over 30 {{witnesses}} against the king in his absence over the next two days, and on 26 January condemned him to death.

5|$|During the {{fighting}} in May 1940, the Pierlot government came into conflict with King Leopold III who had taken personal command of the Belgian Army. The first confrontation {{between the government and}} the King occurred on 10 May, when the King, against the wishes of the government, left for his military headquarters without addressing the Chamber of Representatives like his father, Albert I, had done in 1914. Contact between the King and the government became sporadic while the government feared that <b>the</b> <b>King</b> <b>was</b> acting beyond his constitutional powers. Like his father, Leopold was subject to Article 64 of the constitution which specified that no act of <b>the</b> <b>King</b> <b>was</b> valid unless counter-signed by a government minister, yet also given supreme power in military matters under Article 68. The two clauses appeared to contradict each other and gave all the king's acts in military-political matters an unclear constitutional footing.|$|E
5|$|Having {{secured the}} eastern front, <b>the</b> <b>King</b> <b>was</b> able to {{concentrate}} on the recovery of Baltic areas lost by his father to Sweden. Władysław IV wanted {{to take advantage of the}} Swedish defeat at Nördlingen and fight for both the territories and his Swedish dynastic claims. The Poles were suspicious of his designs and war preparations and <b>the</b> <b>King</b> <b>was</b> able to proceed with negotiations only, where his unwillingness to give up the dynastic claim weakened the Commonwealth's position. According to the Treaty of Stuhmsdorf of 1635 the Swedes evacuated Royal Prussia's cities and ports, which meant a return of the Crown's lower Vistula possessions, and stopped collecting custom duties there. Sweden retained most of Livonia, while the Rzeczpospolita kept Courland, which having assumed the servicing of Lithuania's Baltic trade entered a period of prosperity.|$|E
5|$|In 1572, Sigismund II Augustus, {{the last}} {{king of the}} Jagiellonian dynasty, died without any heirs. The {{political}} system was not prepared for this eventuality, as there was no method of choosing a new king. After much debate {{it was determined that}} the entire nobility of Poland and Lithuania would decide who <b>the</b> <b>king</b> <b>was</b> to be. The nobility were to gather at Wola, near Warsaw, to vote in the royal election.|$|E

5|$|In the Pyramid Age, {{the tomb}} of <b>the</b> <b>king</b> <b>was</b> {{associated}} with a mortuary temple located close to the pyramid. As {{the tomb of}} <b>the</b> <b>king</b> <b>was</b> hidden, this mortuary temple was located away from the burial, closer to the cultivation facing toward Thebes. These mortuary temples became places visited during the various festivals held in the Theban necropolis. Most notable is the Beautiful festival of the valley, where the sacred barques of Amun-Re, his consort, Mut, and son, Khonsu, left the temple at Karnak in order to visit the funerary temples of deceased kings on the West Bank and their shrines in the Theban Necropolis.|$|E

5|$|In {{the early}} years, he was {{assisted}} {{by the man}} who had become his trusted prime-minister, Johan Göransson Gyllenstierna (1635–1680).

5|$|Tatars {{under the}} {{leadership}} of Kadan experienced a major failure in March 1242 at Klis Fortress, when they were hunting for Béla IV of Hungary. The Tatars believed that <b>the</b> <b>king</b> <b>was</b> in the Klis Fortress, and so they began to attack from all sides, launching arrows and hurling spears. However, the natural defenses of the fortress gave protection, and the Tatars could cause only limited harm. They dismounted from their horses and began to creep up hand over hand to higher ground. But the fortress defenders hurled huge stones at them, and managed to kill a great number. This setback only made the Tatars more ferocious, and they came right up to the great walls and fought hand to hand. They looted the houses in the outskirt of the fortress and took away much plunder, but failed to take Klis altogether. Upon learning that <b>the</b> <b>king</b> <b>was</b> not there, they abandoned their attack, and ascending their mounts rode off in the direction of Trogir, a number of them turning off toward Split.|$|E
