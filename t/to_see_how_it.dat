5|$|According to {{production}} staff, scenes involving the alien queen {{were the most}} difficult to film. A life-sized mock-up was created by Stan Winston's company in the United States <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>how</b> <b>it</b> would operate. Once the testing was complete, the crew working on the queen flew to England and began work creating the final version. Standing at 14 feet (4.3 m) tall, it was operated using a mixture of puppeteers, control rods, hydraulics, cables, and a crane above to support it. Two puppeteers were inside the suit operating its arms, and 16 were required to move it. All sequences involving the full size queen were filmed in-camera with no post-production manipulation. Additionally, a miniature alien queen was used for certain shots.|$|E

25|$|Perales {{was born}} in Zaragoza on 29 December 1975. She has one sibling, a brother, who is seven years younger than her. When she was 15 years old, her father died from leukemia, and she was then raised by her single mother. At the age of 19, she {{developed}} neuropathy and lost feeling in her legs over a three-month period. The condition is relatively rare, and doctors did not initially know how to treat it. Instead, they were waiting <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>how</b> <b>it</b> progressed before deciding on the proper treatment. When she left the hospital {{for the first time}} in a wheelchair, she was embarrassed because she felt a need to explain to others the events that led to her becoming a paraplegic. She has very little leg strength and no sensation in her legs, and if she cuts herself while shaving her legs, she cannot feel the cut. Prior to contracting neuropathy, she was an active karate practitioner. The last time she was able to walk without assistance was on 10 May 1995 during the celebration of Zaragoza's la Recopa victory. Perales earned a Diploma in Physiotherapy, which she earned from the Universidad de Zaragoza where she was a student from 1996 to 1999.|$|E

25|$|Next after fine colors, I like plain white. One of my sorrows, {{when the}} summer ends, is that I must put off my cheery and {{comfortable}} white clothes and enter {{for the winter}} into the depressing captivity of the shapeless and degrading black ones. It is mid-October now, and the weather is growing cold {{up here in the}} New Hampshire hills, but it will not succeed in freezing me out of these white garments, for here the neighbors are few, and it is only of crowds that I am afraid. I made a brave experiment, the other night, <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>how</b> <b>it</b> would feel to shock a crowd with these unseasonable clothes, and also to see how long it might take the crowd to reconcile itself to them and stop looking astonished and outraged. On a stormy evening I made a talk before a full house, in the village, clothed like a ghost, and looking as conspicuous, all solitary and alone on that platform, as any ghost could have looked; and I found, to my gratification, that it took the house less than ten minutes to forget about the ghost and give its attention to the tidings I had brought.I am nearly seventy-one, and I recognize that my age has given me a good many privileges; valuable privileges; privileges which are not granted to younger persons. Little by little I hope to get together courage enough to wear white clothes all through the winter, in New York. It will be a great satisfaction to me to show off in this way; and perhaps the largest of all the satisfactions will be the knowledge that every scoffer, of my sex, will secretly envy me and wish he dared to follow my lead.|$|E

500|$|She {{moved into}} feature film acting cautiously, {{choosing}} deliberately small roles to begin with. In November 2005, {{after going through}} an audition to land the role, Lavigne travelled to New Mexico to film a single scene in the 2007 film, The Flock. She played Beatrice Bell, the girlfriend of a crime suspect, appearing alongside Claire Danes and Richard Gere. Gere gave Lavigne acting tips between takes. On her role in The Flock, Lavigne said, [...] "I did that just <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>how</b> <b>it</b> was and to not jump into [...] too fast". The Flock was not released in American theatres, {{and because it was}} not released in foreign markets until late 2007, it is not considered Lavigne's debut. The film made $7million in the foreign box office.|$|E

The performance was released on DVD and Blu-ray on 13 November 2012. In an interview with Billboard, McCartney said that he didn't rule out the possibility of a tour of the album with the musicians who played on it: [...] "We haven't really talked about it yet.

If I can't have Mulder and Scully, I'll take Walter and Peter, and even Astrid and Charlie... I'm happy to see another show on TV that deals with the unknowable and the possibly fascinating, with an actual budget in hand.

500|$|During {{the early}} stages of development, some members of Sonic Team visited Hong Kong shortly before the {{transfer}} of British sovereignty, in hopes of finding inspiration for the game's stages. Some staff also travelled to Universal Studios in California to experience the Backdraft attraction to learn how to generate a similar sensation in the game. The team also visited a special firefighting event in Tokyo where they witnessed robots putting out fires, and were surprised <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>how</b> <b>it</b> compared to their image of the game's futuristic setting. Naka recalled that the robot had special infrared sensors and a camera which could see through fires, and was impressed by their techniques. According to Naka, the team did not ask for advice from professional firefighters during development, partly due to the concern that their game would not be well received, as Naka thought they would have said that real firefighting [...] "wasn't that simple". At the Tokyo Games Show, a real firefighter, however, did comment that the character's costumes were too thin. Naka reflected that if they had made any of game elements highly realistic, the contrast between those elements and the clearly fictional elements would have been exaggerated.|$|E

[...] Among music critics, Phil Kloer from Record-Journal felt that whether one condemns the video as racist or not, [...] "It's condemnable {{on the face of it}} because it exploits a symbol of evil [...] in order to sell records." [...] Writing for the Los Angeles Times, Chris Willman complimented the video for its portrayal of a love song, rather than blasphemy. He was more interested in the stigmata presented in the clip.

500|$|Armstrong had at one point, {{prior to}} its release, {{suggested}} the album would make good material for an adapted feature film.

VH1 quoted Armstrong as saying, [...] "We've definitely been talking about someone writing a script for it, and there's been a few different names that have been thrown at us. It sounds really exciting, but for right now it's just talk." [...] Armstrong later stated that filming would begin in 2006, stressing, [...] "We want <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>how</b> <b>it</b> turns out first so that it doesn't suck." [...] On June 1, 2006, Armstrong announced in an interview with MTV that the movie [...] "is definitely unfolding" [...] and that [...] "every single week there's more ideas about doing a film for American Idiot, and it's definitely going to happen", but the band later said, [...] "It is gonna take a little while." [...] In the summer of 2010, talk about creating a film adaption was brought up again after actor Tom Hanks was interested in producing it.

[...] In addition, Marshall believed the alien antagonists [...] "give the Weeping Angels a run for their money in scare factor." [...] Simon Brew of Den of Geek thought the episode was [...] "a triumphant return for Doctor Who, bubbling with confidence and throwing down story strands that hint at an engrossing series." [...] Brew liked Sheppard's performance as Delaware and Darvill's increasing presence as Rory. Brew also complimented Haynes' work in the United States, saying it was an improvement from [...] "Daleks in Manhattan", which featured British actors attempting to play with American accents. Tom Phillips of Metro said the 1969 US setting were [...] "beautifully used," [...] and enjoyed the [...] "spookiness" [...] of the Silence. However Phillips felt the episode would be [...] "a bit hard to get into" [...] for new viewers. Kevin O'Sullivan The Sunday Mirror was more negative towards the episode, stating it was [...] "impossible to understand," [...] and for [...] "strictly sci-fi nerds only," [...] adding that Smith [...] "remains a derivative Doctor who brings nothing new to the party." ...|$|E
