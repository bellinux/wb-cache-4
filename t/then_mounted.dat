5|$|Amid {{rumors that}} the team would be sold and/or relocated, the Mariners—who had had only two winning seasons (1991 and 1993) since {{beginning}} play in 1977—mounted a late-season comeback in 1995 to clinch their first postseason appearance in franchise history. They <b>then</b> <b>mounted</b> a series of comebacks in the ALDS, first overcoming a 2-game series deficit to force a deciding Game 5, then tying Game 5 in the 8th inning to force extra innings, and finally a one-run 11th inning deficit that was overcome by the Double.|$|E
5|$|Half of the regiment's {{strength}} {{was ordered to}} retreat from its position before the North Korean force was encountered, leaving the flank open for the remaining force, 1st Battalion at Pyongtaek. The battalion encountered North Korean forces the morning of July 6, and after a brief fight, was unable to repel them effectively. The battalion <b>then</b> <b>mounted</b> a disorganized retreat to Cheonan several miles away, having failed to significantly delay the North Korean forces in their movement south.|$|E
5|$|Edward and {{his allies}} amongst the Welsh princes soon began to quarrel, and in early 1282 {{rebellion}} broke out, led by Llwelyn's brother, Dafydd ap Gruffydd. Edward responded to the revolt by mobilising a royal army of 8,000 foot soldiers and 750 cavalry, which he marched north to Rhuddlan, while in South and mid-Wales Marcher Lord forces advanced from Carmarthen and Montgomery. Edward <b>then</b> <b>mounted</b> a naval invasion of the Isle of Anglesey and formed a temporary bridge to cross over onto the mainland, taking the war into the Welsh heartlands of Snowdonia. Llywelyn was killed that December, and in early 1283 Dafydd was captured and executed.|$|E

5|$|The 1st Marine Provisional Brigade, in {{conjunction}} with Task Force Hill, mounted a massive offensive on Cloverleaf Hill and Obong-ni on August 17. At first tenacious North Korean defense halted the Marines' push. The North Koreans <b>then</b> <b>mounted</b> a counterattack following this in hopes of pushing the Marines back, but this failed disastrously. By nightfall on August 18, the North Korean 4th Division had been nearly annihilated and Obong-ni and Cloverleaf Hill had been retaken by US forces. The next day, {{the remains of the}} 4th Division withdrew completely across the river. In their hasty retreat, they left a large number of artillery pieces and equipment behind which the Americans used.|$|E
5|$|The seventh {{match was}} the main event from SmackDown, a Punjabi Prison match for the World Heavyweight Championship, where, Batista, defended the title against The Great Khali. In the match, two giant wooden cages {{surrounded}} the ring, and, to win, a competitor had to escape both structures. After both men prevented the other from escaping, Khali utilized a leather strap as a weapon. Batista later used the leather strap and attempted to climb over inner cage, but Khali stopped him and squeezed Batista's head with a Vise Grip. Khali then called for a door to be opened but Batista struck him with a low blow. The match ended when Khali had climbed over the inner cage and began climbing the outer cage. Batista <b>then</b> <b>mounted</b> the inner cage, jumped to the second cage and, overtaking Khali, climbed to the ground, thereby winning the match and retaining the title.|$|E
5|$|Troops were {{landed on}} the Island of Walcheren at 16:30 on 30 July, while bomb-vessels and gun-boats began a {{bombardment}} of Veere. The town surrendered immediately but it took several days of fighting, before the fort was captured on 1 August. The British <b>then</b> <b>mounted</b> an attack on Flushing, and the island of Zuid-Beveland which was taken unopposed; the forts there having already been deserted. However, the British neglected Cadzand on the south-west side of the Scheldt, where more than 5,700 French troops crossed the river to reinforce Flushing. The capitulation of Fort Rammekens allowed the British to besiege the town on 3 August and to prevent further aid being sent, a flotilla of gunboats was dispatched to the western arm of the Scheldt, to cut it off on the seaward side. The British then began locating and marking a channel for larger ships on 6 August.|$|E

5|$|One scene {{involved}} a burning head, {{which was created}} by taking a cast of the actor's face, head and body with a plaster, then placing soft rubber over the cast to simulate human flesh. It was also treated so it did not release black smoke like a rubber tire when it burned. For burn effects placed on the body after the fire, the crew made a sculpture of the wounds, <b>then</b> <b>mounted</b> them onto rubber appliances, which were glued to the actor. For Harriet's death scene, in which she is scalped and her brain is visible, makeup artist Cindy Jordan put a cap over actress V. Joy Lee's head and covered it with mortician's wax {{to make it look}} bumpy. Another special effect {{involved a}} spirit that appears in the form of ectoplasm during a séance. It was created from cellulose, water and green food coloring. It proved difficult to make, and several attempts were made before the right consistency was achieved. To create the appearance of it coming out of actress V. Joy Lee's mouth, an eight-foot long hose was attached to the side of her face. Project manager Mark Seibert had to suck the fake ectoplasm through the hose to get it in, then during filming he spit it out. It took several shots before the take was successful, and it looked so funny during filming that the crew kept laughing during takes.|$|E
5|$|The Germans {{still held}} {{the village of}} Bréville, between the 3rd Parachute and 1st Special Service Brigades, which gave them a vantage point to observe the {{airborne}} division's positions. On 8June the Germans launched a two pronged attack from Bréville, against the commandos and against the 9th Parachute Battalion. The German force, comprising elements of the 857th Grenadier Regiment, 346th Infantry Division, were only driven back by a counterattack led by the 9th Parachute Battalion's Regimental Sergeant Major. The next morning the 9th Parachute Battalion was the target for a heavy mortar bombardment, followed by two further infantry attacks. Later the same morning, the 3rd Parachute Brigade's headquarters was attacked by German troops who had infiltrated the lines. The brigade defence platoon managed to hold out until a counterattack by the 9th Parachute Battalion cleared the enemy away. On 10June, 31 men who had landed in the wrong locations joined the battalion, bringing their numbers up to 270 all ranks. The fighting was now concentrated around the Château Saint Come, which was occupied by a German infantry company supported by two self propelled guns. One of the self-propelled guns was blown up by Vickers machine gun fire, but the Germans <b>then</b> <b>mounted</b> a determined infantry assault, and the battalion had to call for support from HMS Arethusa. The leading German troops were undaunted by the naval bombardment, and reached the battalion's lines before they were stopped. One of the German prisoners was a battalion commander, who informed his captors that the 875th Grenadier Regiment had been virtually destroyed in the previous day's fighting. That evening the 9th Parachute Battalion captured the Château Saint Come, and was involved in skirmishes throughout the night. The following day, 11June, the 5th Battalion Black Watch {{was attached to the}} brigade to assist in their attempt to capture Bréville, but their attacks were repulsed by the Germans with heavy losses. They tried again on the 12th, and the German response was an attack by infantry supported by armour, which not only drove the Black Watch back, but almost overran the 9th Parachute Battalion's position. The situation was only saved by a counterattack by 'A' Company 1st Canadian Battalion under the command of Brigadier Hill.|$|E

25|$|A second, larger raid, was <b>then</b> <b>mounted,</b> by a {{detachment}} of 17th Fd Co, Yeomanry, mounted infantry and cyclists, covered by 3rd Bn King's Royal Rifle Corps and two guns of 99th Battery Royal Field Artillery. The party moved out from Neohori bridge before dawn on 23 August and burned {{two out of}} three target bridges over the Angista before being attacked. A planned movement to bridges further away was abandoned, but one party of sappers and mounted infantry slipped upstream unseen and destroyed the third Angista bridge.|$|E
25|$|The normal {{method of}} {{installation}} of a large spinner on a light aircraft involves installing a circular spinner back plate over the engine driveshaft, then the propeller, followed by a spinner front plate. The spinner dome is <b>then</b> <b>mounted</b> over this assembly and secured with screws to the back and front plates. Small plates are usually fitted behind the propeller {{to fill in the}} spinner dome cutouts and are secured to the backplate again with screws. Some spinner designs do not incorporate the front plate, although these are not suitable for higher-powered engines.|$|E
25|$|Meanwhile, the 2nd (British) Battalion of the Imperial Camel Corps joined Arab irregulars in a raid {{east of the}} Jordan. They first {{captured}} and destroyed the railway station at Mudawara, finally cutting the Hejaz Railway, and <b>then</b> <b>mounted</b> a reconnaissance near Amman, scattering corned beef tins and documents as proof of their presence. Lawrence sent agents to openly buy up huge quantities of forage in the same area. As a final touch, British newspapers and messages were filled with reports of a race meeting to take place on 19 September, the day on which the attack was to be launched.|$|E

The San Francisco Museum of Art (later SFMOMA) gave the work its first public, free appearance in the United States from 27 August to 19 September 1939. The Museum of Modern Art in New York City <b>then</b> <b>mounted</b> an important Picasso exhibition on 15 November 1939 that remained on view until 7 January 1940, entitled: Picasso: 40 Years of His Art, that was organized by Alfred H. Barr in collaboration with the Art Institute of Chicago. The exhibition contained 344 works, including Guernica and its studies.|$|E
25|$|The Østfold Line was {{the first}} railway in Norway to use iron as the main {{construction}} material for its bridges. This allowed the line to be built with several larger viaducts, the most prominent being the Ljan Viaduct. The design was placed under the construction- and bridgeoffice, which was led by Axel Jacob Petersson. During the design process, he devised the pendulum pillar principle. This method allowed for smaller pillars which could be prefabricated and <b>then</b> <b>mounted</b> easily at the cite, reducing costs significantly. The lower costs allowed for several viaducts to be built, which again allowed for less gradients, as embankments would be prohibitively expensive.|$|E
25|$|This {{required}} the Steadicam {{to be on}} a special mount modeled on a wheelchair in which the operator sat while pulling a platform with the sound man. The weight of the rig and its occupants proved to be too much for the original tires however, resulting in a blowout one day that almost caused a serious crash. Solid tires were <b>then</b> <b>mounted</b> on the rig. Kubrick also had a highly accurate speedometer mounted on the rig so as to duplicate the exact tempo of a given shot so that Brown could perform take after identical take. Brown also discusses how the scenes in the hedge maze were shot with a Steadicam.|$|E

25|$|Sediment or rock {{samples are}} {{collected}} from either cores or outcrops, and the microfossils they contain are extracted {{by a variety}} of physical and chemical laboratory techniques, including sieving, density separation by centrifuge or in heavy liquids, and chemical digestion of the unwanted fraction. The resulting concentrated sample of microfossils is <b>then</b> <b>mounted</b> on a slide for analysis, usually by light microscope. Taxa are then identified and counted. The enormous numbers of microfossils that a small sediment sample can often yield allows the collection of statistically robust datasets which can be subjected to multivariate analysis. A typical microfossil study will involve identification of a few hundred specimens from each sample.|$|E
25|$|Siraj had {{remained}} in his tent throughout the cannonade surrounded by attendants and officers assuring him of victory. When {{he heard that}} Mir Madan was mortally wounded, he was deeply disturbed and attempted reconciliation with Mir Jafar, flinging his turban to the ground, entreating him to defend it. Mir Jafar promised his services but immediately sent word of this encounter to Clive, urging him to push forward. Following Mir Jafar's exit from the Nawab's tent, Rai Durlabh urged Siraj to withdraw his army behind the entrenchment and advised {{him to return to}} Murshidabad leaving the battle to his generals. Siraj complied with this advice and ordered the troops under Mohan Lal to retreat behind the entrenchment.

25|$|First-ranked Texas {{entered the}} game with a 3–0 record, and had decisively beaten Missouri, 42–0; Colorado, 76–0; and Oklahoma A, 54–6. The Longhorns jumped out to a lead, 14–0. In the second quarter, Wallace intercepted a pass from Tom Landry on the Oklahoma 44-yard line, and he <b>then</b> <b>mounted</b> a drive that ended with an 11-yard {{touchdown}} pass. The extra point attempt failed. Shortly thereafter, Wallace made another interception on the Longhorns' 39-yard line, but Darrell Royal soon threw an interception of his own in the Texas end zone. In the fourth quarter, Joe Golding intercepted a pass and returned it 99 yards for a touchdown that tied the school record set the previous year. Texas then engineered a 75-yard drive for the final touchdown and won, 20–13.|$|E
