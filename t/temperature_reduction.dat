Integrating hydrological, biological and economic models, a series of optimization problems are investigated for different policy targets including <b>temperature</b> <b>reductions</b> and enhanced fish populations. Results indicated that the heterogeneous nature of riparian conditions and stream morphology needs to be considered if restoration activities are to be allocated efficiently in a watershed.

Unshaded parking lots {{can be viewed as}} miniature heat islands, where temperatures can be even higher than surrounding areas. Tree canopies will reduce air temperatures significantly. Although the bulk of hydrocarbon emissions come from tailpipe exhaust, 16% of hydrocarbon emissions are from evaporative emissions that occur when the fuel delivery systems of parked vehicles are heated. These evaporative emissions and the exhaust emissions of the first few minutes of engine operation are sensitive to local microclimate. If cars are shaded in parking lots, evaporative emissions from fuel and volatilized plastics will be greatly reduced.|$|E

40|$|This article {{examines}} the allocative efficiency of water quality management activities to protect endangered salmonid species in a heterogeneous watershed in the Pacific Northwest. Using an integrated hydrological, biological, and economic modeling framework, the relative efficiency of alternative policy targets such as <b>temperature</b> <b>reductions</b> and enhanced fish populations is investigated. Results indicate that the heterogeneous nature of riparian conditions and stream morphology influence the choice of management activities. Localized effects of management efforts on temperature are important to achieve small <b>temperature</b> <b>reductions.</b> However, as the desired magnitude of <b>temperature</b> <b>reductions</b> increases, the cumulative (longitudinal) effects become more important, and management efforts in more distant reaches are more efficient than efforts nearer the point of monitoring.

Data were collected at altitudes of 30, 000 and 45, 000 feet at military and partial afterburning power settings. The FTIT reductions for the supersonic tests are less than at subsonic Mach numbers because of the increased modeling and control complexity. In addition, the propulsion system was designed to be optimized at the mid supersonic Mach number range. Subsonically at military power, FTIT reductions were above 70 R for either the left or right engines, and repeatable for the right engine. At partial afterburner and supersonic conditions, the level of FTIT reductions were at least 25 R and as much as 55 R. Considering that the turbine operates at or very near its temperature limit at these high power settings, these seemingly small <b>temperature</b> <b>reductions</b> may significantly lengthen the life of the turbine. In general, the minimum FTIT mode has performed well, demonstrating significant <b>temperature</b> <b>reductions</b> at military and partial afterburner power.
