5|$|Nora crossed {{an area of}} {{abnormally}} {{warm water}} near {{the west coast of}} the Baja California Peninsula. It restrengthened slightly before making its first landfall near , Baja California Sur, on September 25. When Nora was inland, the area of the storm located in the Gulf of California began to reintensify. Hurricane Nora <b>then</b> <b>made</b> <b>a</b> second landfall about 60 miles (95 km) south-southeast of San Fernando, Baja California.|$|E
5|$|Originally {{proposed}} in 1981, Lillehammer's {{bid for the}} 1992 Winter Olympics was unsuccessful and lost to Albertville, France. Lillehammer <b>then</b> <b>made</b> <b>a</b> new bid for the 1994 Olympics, which it won on 15 September 1988. Venue construction ran from spring 1990 to December 1993, with all the competition {{and most of the}} non-competition venues purpose-built for the games. For the first time in Olympic history, environmental and sustainability issues were considered in venue construction.|$|E

5|$|The {{holding company}} of Manchester City F.C., Manchester City Limited, {{is a private}} limited company, with {{approximately}} 54 million shares in issue. The club has been in private hands since 2007, when the major shareholders agreed to sell their holdings to UK Sports Investments Limited (UKSIL), a company controlled by former Thailand prime minister Thaksin Shinawatra. UKSIL <b>then</b> <b>made</b> <b>a</b> formal offer to buy the shares held by several thousand small shareholders.|$|E
5|$|The last {{portion of}} Beebe's journey {{took him to}} China, from which they made an {{unplanned}} visit to Japan in order to escape a riot {{as well as a}} surge of bubonic plague. When the plague and riots had subsided, Beebe returned to China to document the local pheasant species, <b>then</b> <b>made</b> <b>a</b> second visit to Japan to study pheasants kept in the Imperial Preserves there. In Japan, Beebe was given two cranes by the Imperial Household in exchange for a pair of swans, which were unknown in Japan.|$|E
5|$|All {{of these}} {{decisions}} were ratified in the Accord of Winchester that year, witnessed by the King and the papal legate, or {{representative of the}} pope, {{as well as many}} bishops and abbots. Thomas <b>then</b> <b>made</b> <b>a</b> written profession of obedience, some time after late May. Lanfranc wrote to AlexanderII, attempting to get a written papal privilege of Canterbury's primacy, but Alexander replied that Lanfranc must personally resubmit the case to the papal court before a papal privilege could be issued. Alexander died in 1073. His successor, Pope GregoryVII, was opposed to the idea of primacies, and the matter of the papal privilege for Canterbury went nowhere. In 1073, with the help of Wulfstan, Bishop of Worcester and Peter, Bishop of Chester, Thomas consecrated Radulf as Bishop of Orkney in an attempt to increase York's authority in Scotland. Wulfstan often performed episcopal functions in parts of the diocese of York during the 1070s for Thomas, especially in areas that were still in turmoil after the conquest.|$|E

5|$|Both the Blazers and Mavericks started Game 4 {{with a quiet}} first half, with Dallas leading slightly. The Blazers then {{missed their}} first 15 shots after halftime as the Mavs' lead grew as big as 67–44. Roy <b>then</b> <b>made</b> <b>a</b> three-pointer {{near the end of}} the third to cut the lead to 67–49. In the fourth quarter, Roy scored 18 points after going 1-for-3 the {{previous}} 3 quarters, including a clutch 4-point play to tie the game and a bank shot from the middle of the paint with 49 seconds left to give his team the lead for good, finishing with 24 points to lead the Blazers to an improbable 84–82 win to tie the series. The Blazers would go on to lose the series in 6 games, but it gave hope for Roy to start again next season.|$|E
5|$|Brooks <b>then</b> <b>made</b> <b>a</b> powerful, well-timed dive and {{surfaced}} almost {{even with}} his Soviet counterpart Kopliakov. He had drawn level halfway through his leg and made a superior turn {{to take the lead}} as they headed home. The Soviet freestyler pulled level with 25m to go before Brooks sprinted away again to seal an Australian victory by 0.22s. He did not breathe in the last ten metres, and claimed to be laughing for the final five metres, confident that his opponent could not pass him. Brooks had finished his leg in 49.86s as he had vowed to his team mates. In doing so, he recorded the fastest freestyle split in the relay, even faster than the individual 100m freestyle gold medallist, Jörg Woithe of East Germany.|$|E
5|$|Hearts {{started the}} match as the {{brighter}} {{of the two}} teams. Rudi Skácel headed wide early on from an Andrew Driver cross. Hearts took the lead through Darren Barr in the 15th minute, scoring from close range. Hearts continued to control the match and Pa Kujabi picked up a booking for fouling Suso Santana. Skácel then doubled Hearts' lead after receiving {{the ball on the}} edge of the area and turning to hit a shot which deflected off James McPake before going in. Hibs then had an opportunity as Kujabi's cross came to Garry O'Connor, but he hit his shot over the bar. McPake <b>then</b> <b>made</b> <b>a</b> goal-line clearance from a Suso shot which had beaten Hibs' keeper Mark Brown. McPake got Hibs back into the game from a corner. Tom Soares' initial delivery was cleared but he got the ball back out on the wing and put in a low cross which McPake converted.|$|E

5|$|Immediately {{after the}} Headingley Test, Harvey made 32 in a fleet-footed cameo {{attack against the}} local spinners as Australia amassed 456 and {{defeated}} Derbyshire by an innings. In the next match against Glamorgan, {{he came to the}} crease at the fall of third wicket and made nine runs before rain ended the match in the second innings. Harvey <b>then</b> <b>made</b> <b>a</b> duck, bowled by a big-turning leg break from Eric Hollies in the first innings as Australia defeated Warwickshire by nine wickets; he was not required to bat in the second innings. Harvey was then rested as Australia faced and drew with Lancashire for the second time on the tour. He returned for the non-first-class match against Durham, scoring two out of Australia's 282 in a rain-affected draw, which ended after the first day without reaching the second innings.|$|E
5|$|In 2011, The Annotated Phantom Tollbooth was published, which {{includes}} sketches and copies of Juster's handwritten drafts and word lists, Feiffer's early drawings, and an introduction and annotations by Leonard S. Marcus. A fiftieth anniversary edition was also published, with appreciations by Maurice Sendak, Michael Chabon and Philip Pullman. More than three million copies {{have been sold}} of the original book in the U.S. alone. It has been adapted into a small-scale opera with music by Arnold Black, and book by Juster and Sheldon Harnick, produced by Opera Delaware in 1995. It was then revamped into a musical that had its debut to strong reviews at the Kennedy Center in Washington, D.C. and <b>then</b> <b>made</b> <b>a</b> national tour.|$|E
5|$|In 974, Izz al-Dawla {{was trapped}} in Wasit by his troops who under leader Sebük-Tegin had rebelled against him. Adud al-Dawla quickly left Fars to quell the rebellion, where he inflicted a decisive defeat on the rebels on January 30, 975, who under their new leader Alptakin fled to Syria. Adud al-Dawla <b>then</b> <b>made</b> <b>a</b> plot which forced Izz al-Dawla to abdicate in his favor on March 12, 975. Rukn al-Dawla, greatly angered at this action, protested against Adud al-Dawla, {{claiming}} that the line of Mu'izz al-Dawla could not be removed from power. Adud al-Dawla tried to make an agreement with his father by proposing {{to pay tribute to}} him. Rukn al-Dawla, however, rejected his offer, and then restored Izz al-Dawla as the ruler of Iraq. The consequences of the restoration of Izz al-Dawla would later lead to war between him and Adud al-Dawla after the death of Rukn al-Dawla.|$|E
50|$|Mooney {{made his}} Reading {{debut in the}} League Cup, coming on as a {{substitute}} against Luton Town. He <b>then</b> <b>made</b> <b>an</b> extra time appearance in a League Cup penalty shootout defeat against Stoke City.|$|R

5|$|Loxton {{returned}} {{in the next}} match and claimed both openers to end with 2/27 from 19 overs as Warwickshire were bowled out for 138 in their first innings. He <b>then</b> <b>made</b> <b>a</b> duck as Australia struggled to 254 in reply. Loxton bowled six overs and took 0/15 in the second innings before Australia won by nine wickets. Australia then faced and drew with Lancashire {{for the second time}} on the tour. Loxton did little, scoring two in his only innings and taking a match total of 1/32, his victim being Test batsman Jack Ikin. In the non-first-class game against Durham, a rain-affected draw that did not reach the second innings, Loxton made 15 in Australia's 282 and then took 1/8 from six overs as the hosts reached 5/73 before rain washed out the match after the first day.|$|E
5|$|On 21 December 1918, Benham put to sea from Brest for {{the last}} time and began the voyage back to the United States. Rejoining the Atlantic Fleet at the {{beginning}} of 1919, the warship participated in the annual fleet maneuvers held in Cuban waters and <b>then</b> <b>made</b> <b>a</b> cruise to the Azores in May. Upon her return to the United States that summer, she was placed in ordinary at Norfolk on 28 June. Active again in 1921, she patrolled the eastern seaboard until assigned duty as plane guard and tender to the Atlantic Fleet Air Squadrons. That duty terminated in May 1922, and she stood into Philadelphia on 12 May to prepare for inactivation.|$|E

That year, {{the company was}} awarded a contract to carry mail and she was redesignated as RMS Otranto, the RMS standing for Royal Mail Ship. She was present at King George V's Coronation Naval Review on 26 June and made several voyages to the Norwegian fjords before mid-September {{when she returned to}} the Australia run, on which she remained until war was declared on Germany on 4 August 1914.|$|E
