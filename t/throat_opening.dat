50|$|Erythranthe tilingii is a rhizomatous {{perennial}} herb growing 2 to 35 centimeters tall. The oppositely arranged oval leaves may {{be several}} centimeters long {{and some are}} borne on short petioles. The yellow flower may be over 4 centimeters long, its narrow tubular <b>throat</b> <b>opening</b> into a wide, two-lipped mouth. The base of the flower tube is encapsulated in a calyx of sepals with uneven lobes.|$|E
50|$|Flowers {{appear in}} small {{clustered}} inflorescences {{at the ends}} of the stem branches. Each is on a pedicel covered in hairlike black glands. The glandular flower has a small <b>throat</b> <b>opening</b> into a flat-faced pinkish-lavender corolla with five protruding purple-anthered stamens. The center of the flower and throat may have purple and yellow blotches. The fruit is an egg-shaped capsule about half a centimeter long.|$|E
50|$|This wildflower is {{somewhat}} variable in appearance, with branching, leafy stems reaching anywhere from 10 to 90 centimeters in maximum height and sometimes having glandular {{hairs on the}} fleshy herbage. The leaves are divided into toothed or lobed leaflets. Atop {{the branches of the}} thick stem are spherical inflorescences of 50 to 100 small flowers. Each flower has a <b>throat</b> <b>opening</b> into a spreading corolla which may be white, pink, lavender, or light blue. The stamens protrude slightly from the flower's mouth and are white with white, blue, or pink anthers.|$|E
50|$|Linanthus orcuttii is {{a petite}} annual herb {{producing}} short, hairy stems {{no more than}} about 10 centimeters tall. The leaves are divided into hairy, needlelike lobes several millimeters long. The inflorescence is a small cluster of funnel-shaped flowers with thin, tubular <b>throats</b> <b>opening</b> into corollas barely over a centimeter wide. The flower may be white or shades of blue-purple to pink, with yellow and white throats streaked with tiny purple lines.|$|R

50|$|Aliciella triodon (formerly Gilia triodon) is {{a species}} of {{flowering}} plant in the phlox family known by the common name coyote gilia. It is native to the American desert southwest from California to New Mexico, where it grows in desert habitat such as scrub and woodland. This small herb produces a thin, glandular stem not more than about 13 centimeters tall. The stem {{is surrounded by a}} basal rosette of fleshy, sharp-lobed leaves each up to 2 centimeters long. There are sometimes smaller, unlobed leaves on the stem itself. The inflorescence is a solitary flower or loose array of two or three flowers each about 5 to 7 millimeters wide. Each flower has a hair-thin tubular <b>throat</b> <b>opening</b> into a whitish corolla. The corolla lobes each have three distinct teeth.|$|E
50|$|Japanese plane (kanna 鉋), is most {{commonly}} a wooden block, or dai (台) containing a laminated blade, sub-blade, and securing pin. This {{is similar in}} respects to the archaic type of European wooden plane, in which the blade is fixed in place by tapping down upon a wooden wedge. In the Japanese plane, the blade is fixed in position primarily by {{the confines of the}} plane's <b>throat</b> <b>opening.</b> Unlike a western plane, the support bed for the blade is not a flat surface in a Japanese plane - rather it is convex. The blade itself is tapered both in thickness and in width so as to wedge tightly into the dai when tapped down into place. Japanese planes are operated by pulling rather than pushing, and much work is done in the seated position or alongside a planing beam.|$|E
50|$|Porterella is a {{monotypic}} genus {{of flowering}} {{plants in the}} bellflower family containing the single species Porterella carnosula, which is known by the common name fleshy porterella, or simply porterella. It is native to the western United States from California to Wyoming, where it grows in moist spots, such as ponds or wet grasslands, sometimes just {{at the edge of}} the water or partially submerged. It is an annual herb producing an erect stem to a maximum height around 30 centimeters. The leaves along the stem are oval or triangular, those growing beneath the surface of the water more triangular in shape. They measure up to 1.5 centimeters long by half a centimeter wide. The inflorescence bears showy flowers which are quite similar in appearance to those of some species in sister genus Downingia. Each has a narrow tubular <b>throat</b> <b>opening</b> into a wide corolla with two narrow pointed upper lobes and three wider, rounded lower lobes each with a small tooth. The upper lobes are deep blue, and the lower lobes are a similar shade with an area of white and bright yellow near the throat. The stamens are fused into a single unit tipped with tiny toothlike anthers.|$|E
50|$|The {{material}} enters {{through the}} feed <b>throat</b> (an <b>opening</b> near {{the rear of}} the barrel) and comes into contact with the screw. The rotating screw (normally turning at up to 120 rpm) forces the plastic beads forward into the heated barrel. The desired extrusion temperature is rarely equal to the set temperature of the barrel due to viscous heating and other effects. In most processes, a heating profile is set for the barrel in which three or more independent PID-controlled heater zones gradually increase the temperature of the barrel from the rear (where the plastic enters) to the front. This allows the plastic beads to melt gradually as they are pushed through the barrel and lowers the risk of overheating which may cause degradation in the polymer.|$|R
5|$|Waxwings are {{not highly}} territorial, and, {{although}} normally solitary breeders, several pairs may nest close together {{where there are}} a number of good nest sites. Males may sometimes deter rivals from approaching their mates, and females may squabble over nest sites. Aggression is shown by sleeking down the feathers and crest, showing the black <b>throat,</b> and <b>opening</b> the bill. The breeding display is almost the opposite of this; the male erects his body and crest feathers, and turns his head away from the female. The male may repeatedly present a gift of a small item, often food, to his partner, placing it in her open bill. In about 90% of cases, this display does not lead to copulation. Older males have more red tips to the wings and are preferred by females.|$|R

40|$|The {{measurement}} {{of water in}} open channels on extremely flat grades is difficult because of the head loss that is necessary. A modified venture section, the contraction of which is provided by a top cover section mounted in a rectangular flume, is proposed {{to meet the requirements}} of a suitable measuring device for use in canals of flat gradients. The method of finite differences has been used for the mathematical solution to the idealized inviscid flow problem. This was followed by a laboratory investigation to ascertain the hydraulic characteristics of the proposed design. The experiments were conducted in a 3 feet by 3 feet by 200 feet concrete flume. The equation for discharge as obtained in this study is as follows: Coefficient of discharge CD has been calculated for <b>throat</b> <b>opening</b> of 5, 6, 7, 8 and 9 inches.

40|$|Tightening {{environmental}} regulations create special challenges with coal fired stoker boilers where the moving bed firing configuration greatly limits operational flexibility. For stokers, gas cofiring is an {{efficient way to}} achieve compliance, enhance performance and treat operational problems. Firing from 5 to 30 percent of total heat input through side-wall gas burners offers a spectrum of benefits including faster and cleaner warmup and light-off, reduced opacity, recovered derate, coal flexibility, and improved turndown and load following. In this project, the 165, 000 lb/hr Babcock & Wilcox spreader stoker boiler at Dover Light & Power was retrofit with dual Coen gas fired burners rated at 37 MMBtu/hr each. The burners were positioned on opposite sidewalls 6 feet above the grate and offset 8 feet. A high-pressure drop burner design with a small <b>throat</b> <b>opening</b> was used to increase flame penetration into the combustion gases and minimize pressure part modifications. The gas burners in this staggered configuration promote better mixing and heat distribution and reduce the load per unit area o...|$|E

40|$|Applicability of {{electrokinetic}} {{effect in}} improving water injectivity in tight sandstone is studied. DC potential and injection rate are varied for optimization and determination {{of their individual}} impact on clay discharge and movement. The liberated clays were characterized through size exclusion microfiltration and ICP-MS analysis. Real time temperature and pH monitoring were also informative. Results showed that severalfold (up to 152 %) apparent increase of core permeability could be achieved. Some of the experiments were more efficient in terms of dislodgement of clays and enhanced stimulation which is supported by produced brines analysis with higher concentration of clay element. The results also showed larger quantity of clays in the produced brine in the initial periods of water injection followed by stabilization of differential pressure and electrical current, implying that the stimulation effect stops when the higher voltage gradient and flow rates are no more able to dislodge remaining clays. Additionally, fluid temperature measurement showed an increasing trend with the injection time and direct proportionality with the applied voltage. The basic theory behind this stimulation effect is predicted to be the colloidal movement of pore lining clays that results in widening of pore <b>throats</b> and/or <b>opening</b> new flow paths...|$|R
500|$|The {{operation}} of a crank handle powers several different mechanisms inside Tipu's Tiger. A set of bellows expels air through a pipe inside the man's <b>throat,</b> with its <b>opening</b> at his mouth. This produces a wailing sound, simulating the cries of distress of the victim. A mechanical link causes the man's left arm to rise and fall. This action alters the pitch of the 'wail pipe'. Another mechanism inside the tiger's head expels air through a single pipe with two tones. This produces a [...] "regular grunting sound" [...] simulating {{the roar of the}} tiger. Concealed behind a flap in the tiger's flank is the small ivory keyboard of a two-stop pipe organ in the tiger's body, allowing tunes to be played.|$|R
40|$|The use of graded rock fill is a {{cost-effective}} means of sinkhole repair, providing a stable platform for infrastructure while allowing controlled flow of surface {{water into the}} sinkhole throat. Typically, the soil around the sinkhole is excavated down to the rock throat, and large diameter (0. 25 to 0. 5 m) shot rock aggregate is dumped into the excavation. The shot rock forms a stable bridge over the throat, even though the largest rock particle is often smaller than the <b>throat</b> <b>opening,</b> and additional free draining fill is placed up to grade. This paper investigates {{the stability of the}} repair for a range of rock particle diameter (relative to the sinkhole throat diameter). The paper has two goals: a) describe the three-dimensional modeling of the placement of shot rock using the Discrete Element Method, where it is demonstrated that for a given throat radius, there exists an intermediate range of particles sizes for which stability depends upon how the particles arrange during the filling procedure, and b) present a statistical description of this intermediate range of particle sizes for which the throat is semi-stable, using logistic regression to describe the gradual transition from unstable to stable behavior...|$|E
40|$|Turbomachinery blade {{profiles}} {{in use today}} were all derived out of conventional methods. For example an impulse blading of a turbine is derived out of multi circular arcs of different radii for, suction surface and pressure surface with a suitable leading and trailing edge radii. The reaction bladings were designed purely out of empirism based {{on the amount of}} acceleration or Gulf factor i. e., the ratio of <b>throat</b> <b>opening</b> to pitch (Ref-l),where as compressor blade profiles were derived by imposing a suitable c r on a known base profile with a chosen thickness distribution. The performance of these profiles were assessed by conducting series of experiments which involves the measurement of surface velocity distribution and profile loss. From the experimental results each profile can be given a tag of operating range. Selection of blade profile for a given velocity distribution involves the complete scanning of experimental results, which becomes tedious and time consuming. Now a days many theoretical methods are available to evaluate the performance of the blade profile. These methods were extensively used to update the blade profiles originated during the early decades. ...|$|E

This monogamous species nests mainly from mid June to July.Waxwings are not highly territorial, and, although normally solitary breeders, several pairs may nest close together where {{there are a number}} of good nest sites. Males may sometimes deter rivals from approaching their mates, and females may squabble over nest sites. Aggression is shown by sleeking down the feathers and crest, showing the black <b>throat,</b> and <b>opening</b> the bill. The breeding display is almost the opposite of this; the male erects his body and crest feathers, and turns his head away from the female. The male may repeatedly present a gift of a small item, often food, to his partner, placing it in her open bill. In about 90% of cases, this display does not lead to copulation. Older males have more red tips to the wings and are preferred by females.The nest, built by both sexes, is a cup of thin twigs lined with softer material such as fine grass, moss, fur or lichen. It is constructed 1.3 - 15 m above the ground in a pine or scrub, commonly close to the trunk. The eggs are a glossy pale blue spotted with black and grey and the clutch is 3-7 eggs, although five or six is most common. The average size of the egg is 24 x 18 mm, and it weighs 3.8 g, of which 5% is shell. The eggs are incubated for 13-14 days by the female alone. She is fed regurgitated berries by her mate, and rarely leaves the nest. The chicks are altricial and naked, and have bright red mouths; they are fed by both parents, although the male brings most of the food, mainly insects, in the first few days. The young are subsequently fed largely with fruit. The chicks fledge about 14-16 days after hatching. They are fed by the adults for about two weeks after fledging.|$|R
40|$|It {{is widely}} {{accepted}} among singers and voice trainers that {{singing in the}} same manner for <b>opening</b> <b>throat</b> like yawn may result in increasing the resonance and thus allow singers to express the content of music in detail. We carried out an experiment to investigate whether the practice is effective in improving vocal skills. We employed a female singer, whose repertoire is mostly consisted of classical music, and asked her to adopt the particular way of singing. We measured its effect in two aspects: 1) Objectively, we measured the vibration of her body while she was singing using a laser interferometer, an innovative optical sensing technology, and 2) Inter-subjectively, we measured how listeners perceived the content of music composition with a questionnaire. As the result, we found the technique to be effective in increasing the resonance of the voice by opening the cavity of larynx and pharynx. The FFT analysis of the vibration revealed that the spectrum values around high tones(750 - 800 Hz) were distinctively high when she opened the cavity of larynx and pharynx, compared to the ones when she did not adopt such a technique. We examined how thirty listeners perceived the content of a song by adopting the Music appreciation evaluation experiment (Mood Adjective Check List) to observe its effects as we expected. We conclude that the singing, in which the throat opens like yawn, resulted in increasing the resonance of voice. We believe that our finding will help singers to improve his or her vocal-skill in musically meaningful ways. I...|$|R
6000|$|Taking {{my place}} near the pulpit I saw them to advantage. The church was pretty full. I {{sat down beside}} a very stout Hottentot girl, whose dress of showy chintz {{was as much a}} subject of {{interest}} to herself as of indifference to the congregation. There were marvellous contrasts and surprising harmonies displayed in that church, with not a few discords. Childlike good-humour sat on every countenance. When Mr Green ascended the pulpit eager expectancy gleamed in every jet-black eye. When the psalm was given out the preparatory clearing of <b>throats</b> and consequent <b>opening</b> of thick red lips and revelation of splendid rows of teeth all over the church had quite a lighting-up effect on the scene. They sang heartily and well of course,--all black people do so, I think. Just opposite me sat {{a young man with a}} countenance so solemn that I felt sure he had made up his mind to [...] "be good," [...] and get the full benefit of the services. His black cheeks seemed to glisten with earnestness; his thick lips pouted with devotional good-will. I do not write in ridicule, but merely endeavour to convey my full meaning. He wore a superfine black dress coat, a gaudy vest, and buff corduroy trousers so short that they displayed to advantage his enormous bare feet. Beside him was an elderly man with tweed trousers, a white shirt and brown shooting coat, and a face not quite so solemn but very sedate. Some of the men had boots, some had black silk hats, others wideawakes,--which of course they removed on entering. It seemed to me that there was among them every part and variety of costume from morning to evening dress, but no individual could boast of being complete in himself.|$|R
40|$|Porous {{materials}} play {{an important}} role in many applications, e. g. fuel cells, bone transplants and CO 2 storage. The current thesis is motivated by the challenges faced in fuel cell technology with regard to the design and manufacture of porous electrodes. The macroscopic, observable properties of porous materials are determined by their microstructure. However, the challenge still remains in finding and formulating relations between the microstructure and the macroscopic properties. This work tests and develops further a recent method that aims at deriving such relations. The method consists of first quantifying the microstructure in terms of volume elements called quadrons. This description is then used in an entropy-based statistical mechanical formalism that makes it possible to derive macroscopic properties. We apply the quadron description to numerically generated structures: planar granular packs and 3 D tetrahedral cellular structures. We find that the quadron statistics are sensitive to the microstructure. Especially, they capture information about the pores, a microstructural feature that grain-based volumes such as Voronoi cells do not capture. We evaluate the compactivity – an analog to temperature – of the planar packs using different methods. All the methods give the right relation between the compactivities of the packs. In addition, the volume distributions of the quadrons decay exponentially. These results lend support to the statistical mechanical formalism. We compare the quadron statistics of different 3 D cellular structures including examples of relevant microstructural features such as the <b>throats</b> – the <b>openings</b> between two pores. Applying the reciprocity defined within the quadron description, we link between grain shapes, the number of grain contacts and the length of the TPB, which is a key property of fuel cells electrodes. This reproduces an established phenomenon in granular materials, however, this result is obtained here using cellular structures and the quadron description only. Imperial Users onl...|$|R
