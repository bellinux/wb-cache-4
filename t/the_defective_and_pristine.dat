40|$|Over {{the last}} decade, plant virus-based vectors have been {{developed}} and successfully exploited for high-yield production of heterologous proteins in plants. However, widespread application of recombinant viruses raises concerns about possible risks to the environment. One of the primary safety issues that must be considered is the uncontrolled spread of the genetically engineered virus from experimental plants to susceptible weeds or crops. Using a movement-deficient Potato virus X (PVX) -based transient gene expression vector which harbors the β-glucuronidase (gus) gene, we established a plant viral expression system that provides containment of the recombinant virus and allows for safe and efficient protein production. By deletion of the viral 25 k movement protein gene, systemic spread of the modified virus in non-transgenic Nicotiana benthamiana plants was successfully inhibited. In transgenic N. benthamiana plants expressing the 25 K viral movement protein, this deficiency was complemented, thus resulting in systemic infection with the movement-deficient virus. While no differences in virus spread and accumulation were observed compared to infection caused by wild-type PVX in non-transgenic plants, the movement protein transgenic plants exhibited none of the normal symptoms of viral infection. Several biosafety aspects were investigated including the potential for recombination between <b>the</b> <b>defective</b> virus <b>and</b> <b>the</b> movement protein transgene, as well as complementation effects in non-transgenic plants doubly infected with <b>the</b> <b>defective</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> wild-type virus.

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} an {{abstraction}} {{of a unified}} problem of drug discovery and pathogen identification. Pathogen identification involves identification of disease-causing biomolecules. Drug discovery involves finding chemical compounds, called lead compounds, that bind to pathogenic proteins and eventually inhibit {{the function of the}} protein. In this paper, the lead compounds are abstracted as inhibitors, pathogenic proteins as <b>defectives,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> mixture of "ineffective" chemical compounds and non-pathogenic proteins as normal items. A defective could be immune to the presence of an inhibitor in a test. So, a test containing a defective is positive iff it does not contain its "associated" inhibitor. The goal {{of this paper is to}} identify <b>the</b> <b>defectives,</b> inhibitors, <b>and</b> their "associations" with high probability, or in other words, learn <b>the</b> Immune <b>Defectives</b> Graph (IDG) efficiently through group tests. We propose a probabilistic non-adaptive pooling design, a probabilistic two-stage adaptive pooling design and decoding algorithms for learning the IDG. For the two-stage adaptive-pooling design, we show that the sample complexity of the number of tests required to guarantee recovery of <b>the</b> inhibitors, <b>defectives,</b> <b>and</b> their associations with high probability, i. e., the upper bound, exceeds the proposed lower bound by a logarithmic multiplicative factor in the number of items. For the non-adaptive pooling design too, we show that the upper bound exceeds the proposed lower bound by at most a logarithmic multiplicative factor in the number of items.

A library of mutants, containing 19 amino acid insertions in the E 2 glycoprotein sequence of the prototype alphavirus, Sindbis virus (SINV), was generated. Fifty-seven independent E 2 insertions were characterized, of which more than half (67 %) gave rise to viable virus.
