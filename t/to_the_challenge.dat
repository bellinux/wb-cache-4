5|$|Grimsby's ageing {{team made}} a bright start in 1952–53 with five {{straight}} wins but eventually slipped and finished in fifth place. In 1953–54, Shankly became disillusioned when the board {{could not give}} him money to buy new players. He was reluctant to promote some promising reserves because of loyalty to the older players (a fault that was to resurface at Liverpool years later) and he finally resigned in January 1954, citing the board's lack of ambition as his main reason. In his autobiography, {{he said that he}} and his wife were feeling homesick in Grimsby and, when an opportunity came to manage Workington, he was attracted <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>challenge</b> partly because they would be closer to Scotland.|$|E
5|$|Harvey {{was forced}} to {{shoulder}} more responsibility in the batting order now that Bradman had retired and Sid Barnes took an extended break. The youngest player in the team, Harvey rose <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>challenge</b> by establishing several Australian records. His Test figures of 660 at 132.00 was the most runs on a Test tour of South Africa by a visiting batsman, surpassing Len Hutton's previous mark by 83 runs, as were his 1,526 first-class runs at 76.30 and eight centuries on tour. His eight first-class centuries on one South African tour equalled the efforts of Denis Compton, Len Hutton and Arthur Morris.|$|E
5|$|In 1931, {{a dispute}} arose between Foran, {{in his role}} as Stanley Cup trustee, and the NHL. The American Hockey League had asked for a Stanley Cup {{challenge}} against the champions of the NHL. Foran had agreed <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>challenge</b> and ordered the NHL to comply, but the NHL refused to play the challenge. Foran was fired from his position as Senators' president and was replaced by Redmond Quain.|$|E

Khan claims he is up <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>challenge</b> of taming the world and accepts Kirk's offer. Instead of a court-martial for Lt.McGivers, Kirk allows her to go into exile with Khan.

5|$|With Adrian Peterson still {{recovering}} from breaking his collar bone against Iowa State and Allen Patrick on the sidelines in an ankle brace after suffering a late-game sprain the week before, {{many aspects of the}} offense were in doubt coming into this game. Paul Thompson responded by putting up a career-high 309yards passing, completing 24 of 31attempts. True-freshman running back Chris Brown also stepped up <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>challenge</b> and ran for 84yards and two touchdowns, both in the fourth quarter; {{this was the first time}} in 16games that a Sooner back did not run for over 100yards.|$|E
5|$|With the TASS force graduated, Diana Taurasi had {{to carry}} most of the load in her junior season, with help from {{returning}} teammates Maria Conlon, Jessica Moore and Ashley Battle and a top-ranked recruiting class of Ann Strother, Barbara Turner, Willnet Crockett and Nicole Wolff. With no seniors on the roster, 2003 {{was supposed to be}} a rebuilding year for UConn, but as the year progressed it became clear that Taurasi was up <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>challenge</b> of carrying a group of young players to the championship. UConn finished the regular season undefeated and established a 70-game winning streak, shattering the previous mark of 54 set by Louisiana Tech; the streak ended in the Big East championship game loss to Villanova.|$|E

5|$|After his stint {{with the}} Conquistadors, Chamberlain {{successfully}} went into business and entertainment, made money {{in stocks and}} real estate, bought a popular Harlem nightclub, which he renamed Big Wilt's Smalls Paradise, and invested in broodmares. Chamberlain also sponsored his personal professional volleyball and track and field teams, and also provided high-level teams for girls and women in basketball, track, volleyball and softball, and made money by appearing in ads for TWA, American Express, Volkswagen, Drexel Burnham, Le Tigre Clothing and Foot Locker. After his basketball career, volleyball became Chamberlain's new passion: being a talented hobby volleyballer during his Lakers days, he became {{board member of the}} newly founded International Volleyball Association in 1974 and became its president one year later. As a testament to his importance, the IVA All-Star game was televised only because Chamberlain also played in it: he rose <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>challenge</b> and was named the game's MVP. He played occasional matches for the IVA Seattle Smashers before the league folded in 1979. Chamberlain promoted the sport so effectively that he was named to the Volleyball Hall of Fame: {{he became one of the}} few athletes who were enshrined in different sports.|$|E
5|$|Because he {{is prone}} to bouts of {{clinical}} depression, after a fainting spell (triggered by a panic attack), Tony's physician refers him for treatment from psychiatrist Dr. Jennifer Melfi (Lorraine Bracco), in the show's first episode. She treats Tony {{to the best of}} her ability {{despite the fact that they}} routinely clash over various issues. Melfi is usually thoughtful, rational and humane—a stark contrast to Tony's personality. Tony, a serial womanizer, occasionally divulges his sexual attraction to Dr. Melfi; Melfi harbors some degree of attraction to Tony, too, but never admits or acts on it. Melfi is far more attracted to Tony's dangerousness and power. She is drawn <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>challenge</b> of helping such an unusual client, and naively assumes that their doctor-patient relationship will not affect her personal life in any way.|$|E
5|$|Burgmeier {{started out}} as a youth at Triesen before moving to Vaduz in 2000. Although based in his home country, like all Liechtenstein clubs Vaduz played league {{football}} in Switzerlandat the time in the third tierbut also competed in the Liechtenstein Football Cup. In Burgmeier's first season the team won promotion <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Challenge</b> League and won the Liechtenstein Cup with a 9–0 defeat against Ruggell in the final. He scored his first goal at the higher level on 31 July 2001, in a postponed game from {{the first round of the}} season, which finished in a 4–1 victory against Thun. However, Vaduz finished in 11thplace in the Fall Season, before results improved and they finished in second place in the Final Table, avoiding being relegated. The team also successfully defended their Liechtenstein Cup defeating USV Eschen/Mauren 6–1 in the final.|$|E

25|$|In Pushkin's time, {{the early}} 19th century, duels were very {{strictly}} regulated.
