The network has since begun to actively market the feed to potential advertisers, {{and at the}} start of 2009 its first UK-specific programming, Strictly Money, began, initially as a 12-week experiment but the programme continued to air until March 2011. Now the only UK-specific programming is the occasional weekend <b>teleshopping</b> <b>broadcast.</b> Viewers in Ireland also receive this feed.|$|E

On the empty channel, <b>Teleshopping</b> was <b>broadcast.</b> This lasted until 1 September when the channel closed.

5000|$|In the UK, [...] "admags" [...] (advertisement magazines) were {{originally}} {{a feature of}} the regional commercial ITV stations from launch in 1955, but were banned in 1963. The word 'teleshopping' was coined in 1979 by Michael Aldrich, who invented real-time transaction processing from a domestic television and subsequently installed many systems throughout the UK in the 1980s. This would now be referred to as online shopping. In the 1989, the Satellite Shop was the launched as the first UK shopping channel. Shortly afterwards, infomercials began on satellite television and they became known as teleshopping. Until 2009, the UK permitted neither paid infomercials nor <b>teleshopping</b> on <b>broadcast</b> television. However, in 2009, Ofcom allowed up to three hours of infomercials a day on any channel.|$|R
50|$|After Quest was launched, Film4 {{broadcast}} {{hours were}} extended to 09:45 - 08:45 (although films only broadcast between 11:00 - around 04:00), as Gems TV changed its schedule to broadcast during Quest's downtime (between 01:00 - 11:00). Film4 now, instead of closing down in downtime hours, instead <b>broadcasts</b> <b>teleshopping</b> or an animated caption stating it will return at 11:00. Around the same time, Gems TV ceased its second stream {{and was replaced}} by extended coverage of CNN.|$|R
50|$|The channel also {{broadcasts}} {{live the}} majority of CNBC Asia's output. However broadcasts of CNBC Asia's live programming had been scaled {{back in the late}} 2000s as the channel had preferred to <b>broadcast</b> <b>teleshopping</b> and, latterly, poker programming overnight. During the period when poker was shown CNBC Europe only broadcast the final hour (final two hours between April and October) of Asian programming, apart from late Sunday night/early Monday morning when the channel broadcast CNBC Asia's full morning line-up. In 2009, {{the majority of}} Asian programming was reinstated although the entire broadcast day of CNBC Asia is still only shown on Sunday night/early Monday morning.|$|R
