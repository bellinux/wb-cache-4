50|$|The {{concept of}} this model is that, in {{developing}} information assurance systems, organizations must consider the interconnectedness of all the different factors that impact them.

The McCumber model helps one to remember to consider all important design aspects without becoming too focused on any one in particular (i.e., relying exclusively on <b>technical</b> <b>controls</b> at the expense of requisite policies and end-user training).|$|E
40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedThis study uses a systems analysis approach {{to determine the}} communications <b>technical</b> <b>control</b> needs of the Fleet Marine Force as the transition from analog to all digital systems occurs. Introductory material is presented on the Landing Force Integrated Communications System (LFICS) and associated methods of communications system control- The decision problem is stated as a needed choice between alternatives in both near term (1987 - 1990) and long term (1991 +) eras of service. Examined are the <b>technical</b> <b>control</b> functional requirements for both the transitional near term and the eventual long term digital systems. The study raises issues on the automation of <b>technical</b> <b>control</b> {{in the development of}} a systems engineering functional description of an "ideal" facility. Consideration is given to the many other service and industrial solutions in the formulation of twelve alternative approaches to the total solution of communications <b>technical</b> <b>control</b> in the near and long term- A gualitative, ordinal valued, multicriteria decision theory model is applied to the selection between these alternatives as opposed to a more quantitative cost and operational effectiveness analysis (COEA) study approach. The decision model is fully developed for this application and for general future use by the interested reader. Conclusions and recommendations are made based on analysis of the modeling results.
