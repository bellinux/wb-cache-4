50|$|Petroleum-based {{pipe dope}} is not {{intended}} for use on threaded PVC, CPVC or ABS pipe and fittings since it will deteriorate the plastic. Builders in the US are expected to use thread compounds that meet ASTM F2331 - Standard Test Method for Determining Chemical Compatibility of <b>Thread</b> <b>Sealants</b> with Thermoplastic Threaded Pipe and Fittings Materials or thread seal tape on PVC, CPVC and ABS threads.|$|E
50|$|<b>Thread</b> <b>sealants</b> such as joint {{compound}} (pipe dope or thread seal tape such as PTFE tape) are unnecessary on compression fitting threads, {{as it is}} not the thread that seals the joint but rather the compression of the ferrule between the nut and pipe. However, a small amount of plumber's grease or light oil applied to the threads will provide lubrication to help ensure a smooth, consistent tightening of the compression nut.|$|E

40|$|There are {{a number}} of {{companies}} t h a t manufacture hydraulic rams. While manufactured rams come pre-assembled and offer the highest degree of conve-nience and efficiency, they can be quite expensive. Fortunately, inexpensive ram pumps can be assembled from pipe fitt ings t h a t are commonly available a t most hardware and farm stores. Assembly is fairly quick and easy. All t h a t is needed is a pair of pipe wrenches, Teflon tape or other <b>thread</b> <b>sealant,</b> PVC cleaning solvent and PVC cement. Table 1. l ists all of the par ts shown in Figure 1.

50|$|The company {{continued}} to grow and bring new products to {{the market in the}} plumbing and marking categories. In 1950, the company introduced LA-CO Regular Flux, which was the first water-soluble, all-weather flux. The company {{continued to}} put out new products and in 1971 LA-CO produced Slic-tite. This <b>thread</b> <b>sealant</b> revolutionized the plumbing industry by putting polytetrafluoroethylene or PTFE in the sealant. This allowed the pipes to be easily screwed together.|$|R
50|$|Weld-On is a {{division}} of IPS Corporation, a manufacturer of solvent cements, primers, and cleaners for PVC, CPVC, and ABS plastic piping systems. Weld-On products are commonly used for joining plastic pipes and fittings. Weld-On also manufactures specialty products from repair adhesives for leaking pipes, pipe <b>thread</b> <b>sealants</b> / joint compounds, to test plugs for pipeline pressure testing. Their products are most commonly utilized in the irrigation, industrial, pool & spa, electrical conduit, and plumbing industries.|$|E
5000|$|The taper on NPT threads {{allows them}} to form a seal when torqued as the flanks of the threads {{compress}} against each other, as opposed to parallel/straight thread fittings or compression fittings in which the threads merely hold the pieces together and do not provide the seal. The various types of pipe threads are designed for use both with or without <b>thread</b> <b>sealants,</b> as particular applications demand. The sealants, where used, are typically thread seal tape or pipe dope (sometimes plumber's putty). As the thread body is tapered (...) , a larger diameter keeps compressing into a smaller diameter and finally forms a seal (no clearance remains between the crests and roots of the threads because of the taper). This means that NPT fittings should be burr-free and lubricated using a lubricant like lubricating paste or thread seal tape. The use of tape also helps to limit corrosion on the threads, which otherwise can make future disassembly nearly impossible.|$|E
50|$|Overuse or mis{{application}} {{of thread}} tape {{may be a}} hazard. Excess application of PTFE tape can prevent mating threads from fully engaging, reducing the shear point of the threads. Combining thread-seal tape with a pipe dope compound can also overload threads. Also, internal overhangs of loose material may constrict a joint or slough off and form a foreign body that could jam a valve seat. Therefore, use of PTFE tape as a <b>thread</b> <b>sealant</b> is generally not considered appropriate in fluid power (hydraulic) systems.|$|R
