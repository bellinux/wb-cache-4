5|$|The {{relatively}} successful {{resolution of}} <b>the</b> <b>crisis</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> northwest {{did nothing to}} help recover the losses in the southeast. To make matters worse, in 1369 (the date is disputed), the Ottoman Turks under Murad I conquered Adrianople (in 1363) and made it the effective capital of their expanding state. At the same time, they also captured the Bulgarian cities of Philippopolis and Boruj (Stara Zagora). As Bulgaria and the Serbian princes in Macedonia prepared for united action against the Turks, Ivan Alexander died on February 17, 1371. He was succeeded by his sons Ivan Sracimir in Vidin and Ivan Šišman in Tǎrnovo, while the rulers of Dobruja and Wallachia achieved further independence.|$|E

25|$|An {{alternative}} socialist establishment existed alongside, the Petrograd Soviet, wielding {{power through}} the democratically elected councils {{of workers and}} peasants, called Soviets.

25|$|Declining productivity, a high fixed {{exchange}} rate between the ruble and foreign currencies to avoid public turmoil, and a chronic fiscal deficit were the reasons {{that led to the}} crisis. The economic cost of the first war in Chechnya, estimated at $5.5billion (not including the rebuilding of the ruined Chechen economy), also contributed to <b>the</b> <b>crisis.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> first half of 1997, the Russian economy showed some signs of improvement.

25|$|In the 1970s, the {{population}} increased by 15% and national income increased {{at an annual}} rate of about 4%. Employment increased by around 1% per year, but the state sector amounted to a large part of that. Public sector employment was a third of the total workforce by 1980. Budget deficits and public debt increased, leading to <b>the</b> <b>crisis</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 1980s. During the 1980s, underlying economic problems became pronounced. Middle income workers were taxed 60% of their marginal income, unemployment had risen to 20%, annual overseas emigration reached over 1% of population, and public deficits reached 15% of GDP.|$|E
25|$|During his reign, Frederick on {{the whole}} behaved as a {{constitutional}} monarch. He did not, however, quite give up interfering in politics. In 1854, he contributed to {{the fall of the}} strongly conservative Ørsted cabinet, and in 1859–60, he accepted a liberal government appointed on the initiative of his wife. During <b>the</b> <b>crisis</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Duchies in 1862–63, shortly before his death, he spoke openly for an inter-Scandinavian military co-operation. Those minor crises created frictions and maintained some permanent insecurity, but did not damage his general popularity. In some of these affairs, he overstepped the mark beyond any doubt; on the other hand, the first Danish constitution was somewhat vague as regards to the limits of royal power.|$|E
25|$|During the 1990s, Hungary {{were not}} able to qualify for any {{international}} tournaments save for the 1996 Summer Olympics held in Atlanta. The 1980s were considered as the most bitter years of the Hungarian football, but the 1990s proved to be the worst. In 1996, Hungary reached its lowest FIFA World Raking, 87th. The fall of the Hungarian Communist regime caused financial problems to many Hungarian clubs. Formerly successful clubs like Ferencváros and Újpest faced financial crisis and bankruptcy. This {{had a profound effect on}} the Hungarian national team as well since earlier the biggest clubs from Budapest (Ferencváros, Újpest, Honvéd and MTK) produced the players for the national side. Another important reason for the decline can be attributed to the Bosman ruling. Since the Hungarian clubs lost the financial aid from the state in the early 1990s, they {{were not able}} to compete with the richer Western European clubs. <b>The</b> <b>crisis</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Hungarian club football affected the performance of the national team.|$|E

25|$|The Axis {{was able}} to {{reinforce}} North Africa sufficient for Rommel to try to attack before the British.

An operation to fly Spitfires to Malta succeeded and anti-aircraft ammunition was to be supplied by fast minelayer, with which Malta must hold on until mid-June, when the situation in the Western Desert.

The new commanders, who {{became known as the}} Third OHL, had spent two years in command of Ober Ost, the German section of the Eastern Front. Hindenburg and Ludendorff had demanded reinforcements from Falkenhayn to fight a decisive campaign against Russia and intrigued against Falkenhayn over his refusals. Falkenhayn held that decisive military victory against Russia was impossible and that the Western Front was the main theatre of the war.

25|$|Pompey married Cornelia, a {{daughter}} of Quintus Caecilius Metellus Pius Scipio.

Pompey was also seen as being partial in the conduct of some trials. He succeeded in restoring order and chose his father-in‑law as his colleague for the last five months of the year. Pompey was granted an extension of his command in his provinces and was given an annual sum for the maintenance of his troops. Cato warned Pompey about Caesar’s manoeuvres to increase his power by using the money he made from the spoils of war to extend is patronage in Rome and urged him to counter Caesar. Pompey hesitated, and Cato stood for the consulship in order to deprive Caesar of his military command and have him tried. However, he was not elected.|$|E
