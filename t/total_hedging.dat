40|$|In an {{incomplete}} market {{it is usually}} impossible to eliminate the intrinsic risk of an option. In this case quadratic risk-minimization {{is often used to}} determine a hedging strategy. However, it may be more natural to use piecewise linear risk-minimization since in this case the risk is measured in actual dollars (not dollars squared). We investigate hedging strategies using piecewise linear risk-minimization. We illustrate that piecewise linear risk-minimization often leads to smaller expected <b>total</b> <b>hedging</b> cost and significantly different, possibly more desirable, hedging strategies from those of quadratic risk minimization. The distributions of the <b>total</b> <b>hedging</b> cost and risk show that hedging strategies obtained by piecewise linear risk-minimization have a larger probability of small cost and risk, though they also have a very small probability of larger cost and risk.

40|$|I study an agent’s optimal consumption-saving and {{portfolio}} choice decisions when he cannot fully insure his income shocks {{and does not}} know his income growth rate. I show that the agent rationally saves for precaution against the risk of estimating his income growth, {{in addition to his}} standard precautionary saving demand induced by income volatility. I then extend the analysis to allow for the agent’s unknown growth rate to be stochastic. Finally, I generalize the model to allow the agent to trade risky assets to hedge against both his income risk and estimation risk. A more volatile and noisier underlying income process gives rise to a less volatile belief updating process. Hence, estimation risk (due to stochastic belief updating) is lower, and the implied hedging demand against estimation risk is smaller.

Given that hedging reduces the volatility of cash flows, we ask whether it allows financial analysts to provide more accurate forecasts for firms that hedge than for firms that do not. Three data sources are used to construct the data set for this study: the Edgar database, Compustat and I/B/E/S.

40|$|AbstractHedges are {{ubiquitous}} green {{elements in}} many European cities. The selection of hedge types characterized by different traits {{can be suggested}} for urban greening projects to decrease pollution levels. At this end, carbon dioxide (CO 2) sequestration and noise attenuation capability were analyzed in the following hedge types: Laurus nobilis, Nerium oleander, Pittosporum tobira and Pyracantha coccinea, largely used as green infrastructure in Rome (Italy). Representative hedges for each species were selected from high level traffic streets in the city centre (P sites). Traffic density (TD) was monitored simultaneously with CO 2 concentration and noise level (N) {{in each of the}} considered P sites. The monthly CO 2 sequestration capability (MSC) was calculated multiplying the <b>total</b> photosynthesis per <b>hedge</b> by the <b>total</b> photosynthetic activity time (in hours) per month. The multiple regression analysis predicted noise attenuation (ΔN) by a linear combination of total leaf area (TLA), total leaf density (TLD) and leaf mass area (LMA) of the considered hedge types. All the considered species, being evergreens, were active all year long, including winter, when CO 2 emissions from road transport peaked. Nevertheless, among the considered hedge types, P. tobira and L. nobilis were the most efficient species in both MSC (31. 6 ± 2. 8 and 25. 4 ± 2. 4 kg CO 2 month– 1, respectively) and ΔN (15 ± 1 %, mean value). The results give insight on the use of hedges to mitigate pollution effects. Moreover, this method can be used to monitor hedge contribution to air quality, in relation to various elements in the city (i. e. traffic density, new cars produced, application of management projects, local laws). These results might be available for projects based on the use of vegetation in order to improve environmental quality in urban areas...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} the extensive literature survey based both on theoretical rationales for hedging {{as well as}} the empirical evidence that support the implications of the theory regarding the arguments for the corporate risk management relevance and its influence on the company’s value. The survey of literature presented in this paper has revealed that there are two chief classes of rationales for corporate decision to hedge - maximisation of shareholder value or maximisation of managers’ private utility. If corporate hedging decisions are capable of increasing firm values, they can do so by reducing the volatility of cash flows. The literature survey presented in this paper has revealed that, by hedging financial risks firms can decrease cash flow volatility, what leads to a lower variance of firm value. This means that not only a firm value is moving less, but that the probability of occurring low values is smaller than without hedging. Reduced volatility of cash flows results in decreased costs of financial distress and expected taxes, thereby enhancing the present value of expected future cash flows. Additionally, it reduces the costs associated with information “asymmetries” by signalling management 2 ̆ 7 s view of the company 2 ̆ 7 s prospects to investors, or it reduces agency problems. In addition, reducing cash flow volatility can improve the probability of having sufficient internal funds for planned investments eliminating the need either to cut profitable projects or bear the transaction costs of obtaining external funding. However, it needs to be emphasised that there is no consensus as to what hedging rationale is the most important in explaining risk management as a corporate policy. It can be concluded that, the <b>total</b> benefit of <b>hedging</b> is the combination of all these motives and, if the costs of using corporate risk management instruments are less than the benefits provided via the avenues mentioned in this paper, or any other benefit perceived by the market, then risk management is a shareholder-value enhancing activity...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{discusses}} how the communicative {{purpose of}} the different rhetorical sections of research papers (RP) and case reports (CR) in medical English written discourse influences the frequency and category distribution of the modulation devices (hedges) used in each section. To this end, we analyzed a corpus of 15 articles drawn from five leading medical journals. Hedges were identified {{by means of a}} contextual analysis, their frequency was recorded in the different rhetorical sections of the 15 articles, and their percentages (over the total number of running words) were computed. The hedges recorded were then classified according to five pre-established categories, and their percentual distribution per category was evaluated in each rhetorical section. The results were analyzed by means of Chi-square tests. Our research indicates that the three most frequently used hedging devices in both text-types (shields, approximators and compound hedges) account for over 90 % of the <b>total</b> number of <b>hedges</b> used in our sample. The Discussion (RP) /Comment (CR) sections are the most heavily hedged sections, whereas the Methods (RP) and the Case Report sections (CR) are the least-hedged rhetorical divisions (p=. 001 and. 071 respectively). The Introduction section of both RP and CR favors shields (mainly epistemic verbs) as a hedging convention followed by approximators (negative or quasi negative expressions in RP Introductions, and adaptors of frequency in CR Introductions). In the Introduction hedges allow researchers to establish an "early niche" for their research. Scientific writers mostly resort to approximators as a hedging technique in the Methods section (p=. 0001) {{as well as in the}} Results sections of RP and in the Case Report sections of CR. Shields (mostly modal verbs) are also used (although to a much lesser extent) in the Result section of RP to evaluate, interpret and comment on the findings of the research being reported. Both shields and compound-hedges are the most frequently encountered hedging devices in the Discussion/Comments sections of RP and CR. Finally, the distribution of hedges in the Case Report section in CR resembles that observed in the Result section in RP, but it is significantly richer in approximators (p=. 0001) used for describing symptoms and for conveying the idea of range. We conclude that the choice of expressions of tentativeness and flexibility is dictated by the general structure of the discourse, by its communicative purpose, by the level of claim the writers wish to make, and by the authors' pretension to universality and generalization. Because hedging in scientific discourse is a necessary and vitally important skill, we finally provide some pedagogical implications of our research such as the use of sensitization, translation and rewriting exercises in ESP courses. 149 - 171 frmeyer@cantv. ne...|$|R
40|$|Finance theory {{does not}} provide a {{comprehensive}} framework for explaining risk management within the imperfect financial environment in which firms operate. Corporate managers, however, rank risk management as one of their most important objectives. Therefore, {{it is not surprising that}} papers on the question why firms hedge are mushrooming. This paper critically reviews this literature and analyses the implications for risk management practice. It is distinguished between two competing approaches to corporate hedging: equity value maximising strategies and strategies determined by managerial risk aversion. The first category suggests that managers act in the best interest of shareholders. They hedge to reduce real costs like taxes, costs of financial distress and costs of external finance or to replace home-made hedging by shareholders. The second category considers that managers maximise their personal utility rather than the market value of equity. Their hedging strategy, therefore, is determined by their compensation plan and reputational concerns. There is ambiguous empirical evidence on the dominant hedging motive. It depends on the environment in which firms operate (e. g. tax schedule) and on firm characteristics (e. g. capital intensity). In general, one can observe that (i) hedging taxable income is of minor importance, (ii) firms with a high probability of financial distress hedge more, (iii) companies with greater growth opportunities hedge more, (iv) managers with common stockholdings hedge more than managers with option holdings and (v) high ability managers hedge more than low ability managers. The <b>total</b> benefits of <b>hedging</b> are not the sum across the various motives. Therefore, a manager has to concentrate on a primary motive to implement an effective risk management programme: If his primary motive is to minimise corporate taxes, he will hedge taxable income. If his primary concern is to reduce the costs of financial distress and if he can faithfully communicate the firm?s true probability of default, his hedging strategy will focus on the market value of debt and equity. If hedging is prompted to reduce the demand for costly external finance, he will hedge cash flows. If the manager is concerned with his reputation, he will focus on accounting earnings. Once he has focused on a certain exposure, the manager has to decide whether he wants to minimise the volatility of this exposure or simply avoid large losses.

Ausgehend von den Irrelevanzthesen von Modigliani/Miller wird gezeigt, daß die starke Betonung des Risikomanagements in Unternehmen auf zweierlei Arten erklärbar ist: Zum einen erhöht Hedging den Shareholder Value, da es Steuern, Bankrottkosten, die Kosten von externem Kapital und den Absicherungsbedarf von schlecht diversifizierten Aktionären verringern kann. Zum anderen kann Hedging den Nutzen von Managern erhöhen, soweit es einen Einfluß auf deren Vermögen oder Ruf hat.
