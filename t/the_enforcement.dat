5|$|Randall's {{determination}} to cut spending, combined with Southern Democrats' desire to reduce federal power {{in their home}} states, led the House to pass an army appropriation bill with a rider that repealed <b>the</b> <b>Enforcement</b> Acts, which {{had been used to}} suppress the Ku Klux Klan. <b>The</b> <b>Enforcement</b> Acts, passed during Reconstruction over Democratic opposition, made it a crime to prevent someone from voting because of his race. Hayes was determined to preserve the law protecting black voters, and he vetoed the appropriation. The Democrats did not have enough votes to override the veto, but they passed a new bill with the same rider. Hayes vetoed this as well, and the process was repeated three times more. Finally, Hayes signed an appropriation without the rider, but Congress refused to pass another bill to fund federal marshals, who were vital to <b>the</b> <b>enforcement</b> of <b>the</b> <b>Enforcement</b> Acts. The election laws remained in effect, but the funds to enforce them were curtailed. Randall's role in the process was limited, but the Democrats' failure to force Hayes's acquiescence weakened his appeal as a potential presidential candidate in 1880.|$|E

5|$|Hayes's later {{attempts}} {{to protect the}} rights of southern blacks were ineffective, as were his {{attempts to}} rebuild Republican strength in the South. He did, however, defeat Congress's efforts to curtail federal power to monitor federal elections. Democrats in Congress passed an army appropriation bill in 1879 with a rider that repealed <b>the</b> <b>Enforcement</b> Acts, which had been used to suppress the Ku Klux Klan. Those Acts, passed during Reconstruction, made it a crime to prevent someone from voting because of his race. Hayes was determined to preserve the law protecting black voters, and he vetoed the appropriation. The Democrats did not have enough votes to override the veto, but they passed a new bill with the same rider. Hayes vetoed this as well, and the process was repeated three times more. Finally, Hayes signed an appropriation without the offensive rider, but Congress refused to pass another bill to fund federal marshals, who were vital to <b>the</b> <b>enforcement</b> of <b>the</b> <b>Enforcement</b> Acts. The election laws remained in effect, but the funds to enforce them were curtailed for the time being.|$|E

5|$|White supremacists, {{such as the}} Ku Klux Klan (KKK), used {{paramilitary}} {{violence to}} prevent blacks from voting. A number of blacks were killed at the Colfax massacre of 1873 while attempting to defend their right to vote. <b>The</b> <b>Enforcement</b> Acts were passed by Congress in 1870–1871 to authorize federal prosecution of the KKK and others who violated the amendment. However, as Reconstruction neared its end and federal troops withdrew, prosecutions under <b>the</b> <b>Enforcement</b> Acts dropped significantly. In United States v. Cruikshank (1876), the Supreme Court ruled {{that the federal government}} did not have the authority to prosecute the perpetrators of the Colfax massacre because they were not state actors.|$|E
5|$|With Ulysses S. Grant {{elected to}} the Presidency in 1868, Congress had a more willing partner in Reconstruction. The 40th Congress's lame duck session passed the Fifteenth Amendment, which {{guaranteed}} {{that the right to}} vote could not be restricted because of race; Sherman joined the two-thirds majority that voted for its passage. The 41st Congress passed <b>the</b> <b>Enforcement</b> Act of 1870 to enforce its civil rights Amendments among a hostile Southern population. That Act, written by John Bingham of Ohio to mirror the Fourteenth Amendment, created penalties for violating another person's constitutional rights. The next year, Congress passed the Ku Klux Klan Act, which strengthened <b>the</b> <b>Enforcement</b> Act by allowing federal trials and federal troops to be used. Sherman voted in favor of both Acts, which had Grant's support.|$|E

In 1850, now a member of the new Free Soil Party, he encouraged like-minded legislators to pass a stronger prohibition law. They did so, but saw it vetoed by Democratic governor John W. Dana. The legislature fell one vote short of overriding the veto.|$|E

40|$|Spectrum sharing is {{emerging}} as a key strategy for future wireless communications systems. Enforcement is a requirement for spectrum sharing to protect the incumbent of the spectrum from bad interference. Practical schemes have linked together ex-ante and ex-post <b>enforcement.</b> <b>The</b> design of <b>the</b> overall <b>enforcement</b> system may give more emphasis to one or the other. The emphasis in commercial-government sharing in the United States has been on ex-ante measures [4, 5]. Determining the role of ex-post enforcement in a spectrum sharing scheme is of significant importance since spectrum sharing will inevitably result in interference events. To evaluate the role of <b>the</b> ex-post <b>enforcement</b> approach, we will consider numerical examples where we compare the cost of <b>the</b> ex-post only <b>enforcement</b> to <b>the</b> cost of <b>the</b> ex-ante only <b>enforcement</b> {{on one of the}} suggested bands for spectrum sharing (1695 - 1710 MHz). The cost of <b>the</b> ex-post <b>enforcement</b> in our model depends on the penalty value that Primary User (PU) uses to control interference events and the probability of detecting the interference. The penalty value depends on two factors which are changeable and unchangeable <b>enforcement</b> costs. <b>The</b> cost of <b>the</b> ex-post only <b>enforcement</b> has two variables that affect it, which are probability of detection; and <b>the</b> changeable <b>enforcement</b> cost. <b>The</b> numerical results show how these two variables affect one another, and their effect on the radius of th...|$|R
