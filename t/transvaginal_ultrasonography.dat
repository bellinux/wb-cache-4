25|$|Pregnancy {{of unknown}} {{location}} (PUL) {{is the term}} used for a pregnancy {{where there is a}} positive pregnancy test but no pregnancy has been visualized using <b>transvaginal</b> <b>ultrasonography.</b> Specialized early pregnancy departments have estimated that between 8 and 10% of women attending for an ultrasound assessment in early pregnancy will be classified as having a PUL. The true nature of the pregnancy can be an ongoing viable intrauterine pregnancy, a failed pregnancy, an ectopic pregnancy or rarely a persisting PUL.|$|E
25|$|Screening by {{hysteroscopy}} {{to obtain}} cell samples obtained for histological examination is being developed. This {{is similar to}} the current pap smear that is used to detect cervical cancer. The UK Collaborative Trial of Ovarian Cancer Screening is testing a screening technique that combines CA-125 blood tests with transvaginal ultrasound. Other studies suggest that this screening procedure may be effective. However, it's not yet clear if this approach could actually help to save lives—the full results of the trial will be published in 2015. One major problem with screening is no clear progression of the disease from stage I (noninvasive) to stage III (invasive) is seen, and it may not be possible to find cancers before they reach stage III. Another problem is that screening methods tend to find too many suspicious lesions, most of which are not cancer, but malignancy can only be assessed with surgery. The ROCA method combined with <b>transvaginal</b> <b>ultrasonography</b> is being researched in high-risk women to determine if it is a viable screening method. It is also being investigated in normal-risk women as it has shown promise in the wider population. Studies are also in progress to determine if screening helps detect cancer earlier in people with BRCA mutations.|$|E

2500|$|A {{complete}} miscarriage is {{when all}} products of conception have been expelled; {{these may include}} the trophoblast, chorionic villi, gestational sac, yolk sac, and fetal pole (embryo); or later in pregnancy the fetus, umbilical cord, placenta, amniotic fluid, and amniotic membrane. The presence of a pregnancy test that is still positive {{as well as an}} empty uterus upon <b>transvaginal</b> <b>ultrasonography</b> does, however, fulfill the definition of pregnancy of unknown location. Therefore, there may be a need for e.g. follow-up pregnancy tests to ensure that there is no remaining pregnancy, including an ectopic pregnancy. [...] An incomplete miscarriage occurs when some products of conception have been passed, but some remains inside the uterus. However, an increased distance between the uterine walls on <b>transvaginal</b> <b>ultrasonography</b> may also simply be an increased endometrial thickness and/or a polyp.

40|$|Background/Aim. The {{glycoprotein}} of a {{high molecular}} weight CA- 125, {{which is not a}} specific tumor marker of ovarian cancer, is secreted by the endothelial cells of most pelvic organs. Endometriosis, inflammatory processes in the pelvic cavity, as well as some nongynecoligical malignant diseases, could be followed by the increased values of CA- 125. Serial assessment of the values of CA- 125 makes it possible to avoid surgical treatment, and, by means of the used conservative treatment, to avoid malignant diseases not to be noticed. Methods. The study included 57 female patients hospitalized due to inflammable adnexal tumors. Besides following the values of serum CA- 125 during and after the therapy, also performed were the <b>transvaginal</b> Doppler <b>ultrasonography</b> and the determination of the values of resistance index (RI). Results. In 27 patients (55. 1 %) the CA- 125 values ranged from 38. 8 U/ml to 794 U/ml, while in 30 of the patients they were within the range of normal. In this group of the patients, besides the increased values of CA- 125, also increased were the values of leucocytes (119 /l − 209 /l), as well as the sedimentation rates (65 − 120) within the first hour. In all the 57 patients, <b>transvaginal</b> Doppler <b>ultrasonography</b> revealed the presence of adnexal tumor of inflammatory kind. The measured values of RI were within the range of 0. 539 − 0. 681. Eight of the patients were treated by the conservative - triple antibiotic therapy, while in 49 patients explorative laparotomy was performed. Hystorectomy was done in 12 of the patients, and one-side adnexectomy in 37 of them. Conclusion.

40|$|Arterial {{embolization}} of myomas (AEM) is {{an established}} {{option for the}} conservative treatment of uterine leio-myomas; it treats all present uterine nodules at once, is less invasive than other pro-cedures and effective in controlling symptoms, and does not require long term hospitalizations. Nevertheless, the potential impact on endometrial morphological and functional outcomes after the procedure is still controversial based on reports of endometritis or eventual transient ische-mia. This study evaluated endometrial reorganization in uterine leiomyoma patients, before and after AEM, through gene expression analyses of extracellular matrix and cytokines genes in the endometrial tissue.

Treatment should only be considered when a potentially viable intrauterine pregnancy has been definitively excluded. A treated persistent PUL is defined as one managed medically (generally with methotrexate) without confirmation of the location of the pregnancy such as by ultrasound, laparoscopy or uterine evacuation. A resolved persistent PUL is defined as serum hCG reaching a non-pregnant value (generally less than 5 IU/l) after expectant management, or after uterine evacuation without evidence of chorionic villi on histopathological examination. In contrast, a relatively low and unresolving level of serum hCG indicates the possibility of an hCG-secreting tumour.|$|E
2500|$|An {{ultrasound}} {{showing a}} gestational sac with fetal {{heart in the}} fallopian tube has a very high specificity of ectopic pregnancy. <b>Transvaginal</b> <b>ultrasonography</b> has a sensitivity of at least 90% for ectopic pregnancy. The diagnostic ultrasonographic finding in ectopic pregnancy is an adnexal mass that moves separately from the ovary.

2500|$|Gynecologic ultrasonography, {{specifically}} {{looking for}} small ovarian follicles. These {{are believed to}} be the result of disturbed ovarian function with failed ovulation, reflected by the infrequent or absent menstruation that is typical of the condition. In a normal menstrual cycle, one egg is released from a dominant follicle– in essence, a cyst that bursts to release the egg. After ovulation, the follicle remnant is transformed into a progesterone-producing corpus luteum, which shrinks and disappears after approximately 12–14 days. In PCOS, there is a so-called [...] "follicular arrest"; i.e., several follicles develop to a size of 5–7mm, but not further. No single follicle reaches the preovulatory size (16mm or more). According to the Rotterdam criteria, which are widely used for diagnosis, 12 or more small follicles should be seen in an ovary on ultrasound examination. More recent research suggests that there should be at least 25 follicles in an ovary to designate it as having polycystic ovarian morphology (PCOM) in women aged 18–35 years. The follicles may be oriented in the periphery, giving the appearance of a 'string of pearls'. If a high resolution <b>transvaginal</b> <b>ultrasonography</b> machine is not available, an ovarian volume of at least 10 ml is regarded as an acceptable definition of having polycystic ovarian morphology instead of follicle count.|$|E
30|$|In addition, {{parametric}} lymphadenectomy {{in patients}} with cervical cancer was additionally performed, which comprises the removal of all lymphatic tissue of the vascular part of the cardinal ligament including all branches of the internal iliac vessels and the lymph nodes of the lumbosacral fossa.

The entire surgical procedure was performed {{in a uniform manner}} by one of the senior surgeons at the Department of Gynecology of the Friedrich-Schiller University in Jena. Five trocars were placed: two 10 -mm trocars at the umbilicus and in the left upper abdomen and three 5 -mm trocars in the lower abdomen, midline, left, and right side. The drains were removed when the volume of fluid collected was less than 100  ml/day. After removal of the drains, each patient underwent <b>transvaginal</b> pelvic <b>ultrasonography</b> (US) to search for asymptomatic lymphocysts and urinary tract ultrasonography to search for ureteral complications.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{investigate}} {{the presence and}} outcome of uterine vascular malformations in women with abnormal premenopausal bleeding. STUDY DESIGN: In this observational study 265 consecutive patients with abnormal premenopausal bleeding were examined by the same ultrasonographer with <b>transvaginal</b> gray-scale <b>ultrasonography</b> and color Doppler imaging. A final diagnosis of uterine vascular malformation was based on ultrasonographic findings, hysteroscopy or histological findings. Patients suspected of uterine vascular malformations at ultrasonography were closely monitored. RESULTS: In nine patients (3. 4 %) we found ultrasonographic features of uterine vascular malformations. Color Doppler imaging showed hypervascularity, marked turbulence, and low-impedance, high-velocity flow. In six patients the condition resolved spontaneously. Two patients with hydatiform mole needed chemotherapy and their condition normalized. One patient underwent a selective embolization of the uterine artery. Subsequently, five patients had uncomplicated pregnancies after resolution of the vascular malformation. CONCLUSION: Uterine vascular malformations are more common than previously thought.

Methods. A cross-sectional study involving 62 normal pregnancies {{was performed to}} assess YSV from 7 to 10 weeks of gestational age. An endocavitary volumetric transducer (3 D 5 - 8 EK) was used for all measurements. the VOCAL (Virtual Organ Computer-aided AnaLysis) method with a 30 rotation angle was used for volumetric calculations. Regression models were constructed to analyze the correlation between YSV and GA or CRL the mean, standard deviation, median, minimum and maximum values were calculated for each gestational age. Results. There was a poor correlation between YSV and GA or CRL. the quadratic regression was the model that best expressed the correlation between these variables: R 2 = 0. 188 for GA and R 2 = 0. 203 for CRL. the mean YSV went from 0. 063 cm(3) (95 % CI: 0. 047; 0. 080) at 7 weeks to 0. 164 cm(3) (95 % CI 0. 095; 0. 232) at 10 weeks.

40|$|Human placental {{circulation}} {{in the first}} trimester of pregnancy remains a subject of scientific debate. Most of the acquired knowledge on the physiological background of maternal-fetal interface relies on old studies, most of them performed in non-hemochorial placentas and using light and electron microscopy for the pathological specimens' evaluation. Recently, some ultrasonographic research in this field, using pulsed-wave and/or colour Doppler, yielded contradictory results. The availability of these non-invasive methods should allow the in vivo investigation of placental circulation since early phases of human pregnancy.

It is already known that vessel diameter is not an indicator of reflux in the great saphenous vein. However, to this day, physicians still use vein size to plan treatment of refluxing ovarian veins. The authors aimed to investigate whether or not vessel diameter can be used as an indicator of reflux in the ovarian veins. MethodsNineteen female patients (mean 40. 2 years, range 29 – 60) presenting to a specialist vein unit with leg varicose veins underwent duplex ultrasonography (DUS). All were found to have a significant pelvic contribution to their leg reflux on <b>transvaginal</b> duplex <b>ultrasonography</b> (TVS) and were referred to an interventional radiologist for treatment by transjugular coil embolization. During the procedure, the diameter of the ovarian veins was measured using digital subtraction venography. ResultsThirty-four ovarian veins were measured (17 right, 17 left) and of these 18 were found to be non-refluxing while 16 displayed reflux. The mean diameter of the non-refluxing veins was 7. 2  mm (range 3 – 13  mm) and that of the refluxing veins was 8. 5  mm (range 4 – 13  mm). This difference was found to be insignificant at a 95 % confidence level (Student t test, p = . 204).

Materials and Methods: In this prospective observational study, 65 infertile women underwent IVF procedure in Isfahan, during 2013 - 2014, were studied. The pulsatility index (PI), resistive index (RI) and peak systolic velocity (PSV) of the uterine arteries and arcuate arteries were measured in all selected women using transvaginal color and pulsed Doppler measurements {{on the day of}} human chorionic gonadotrophin injection. The women followed up for the primary endpoint which was a successful pregnancy. The mean of PI, RI, and PSV were compared in groups of women who had successful IVF and not. The receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was used to determine the predictive value of studied indices. Results: In this study, from 65 women, 32 (49. 2 %) and 33 (50. 8 %) have successful and unsuccessful IVF outcome, respectively. The mean of PI and RI of both uterine and arcuate arteries were significantly lower in pregnant women than non-pregnant ones (P < 0. 001). The area under the ROC curve of PI (84. 7 %) and RI (84. 4 %) for uterine arteries was higher than other indices. The most accurate indices for predicting the outcome of IVF was RI of uterine arteries with an accuracy of 81. 5 %.

All women were evaluated by transvaginal grayscale and color Doppler ultrasonography. Blood flow within the endometrium was measured using color Doppler. Pulsed Doppler was performed to evaluate blood flow impedance by calculating the resistance index (RI). Results: Forty-six patients underwent dilation and curettage of which 67. 4 % were proven to have retained products of conception (RPOC). Thirty-one patients were followed up through expectant management. Endometrial thickness (ET) was greater in the group with RPOC (p  10  mm.
