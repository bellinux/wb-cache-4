5|$|Beshear faced heavy {{deficits in}} polls against McConnell {{throughout}} {{the general election}} campaign. McConnell also raised twice {{as much money as}} Beshear during the campaign. Beshear tried to make McConnell's fundraising a campaign issue, claiming much of the money came from political action committees that represented interests that lobbied the Senate committees on which McConnell served. McConnell defended his contributors, saying that the right to free speech included the right to donate money. Beshear charged <b>that</b> <b>Republicans,</b> including McConnell, had voted to cut Medicare; McConnell responded <b>that</b> <b>Republicans</b> had not cut Medicare, but had put forward a plan to curb its growth, a plan that didn't differ significantly, McConnell said, from the one proposed by Democratic President Bill Clinton.|$|E
5|$|In November 2009, Gibbs {{announced}} that, {{rather than}} {{running for re-election}} to the state senate in fall of 2010, he would run for the Summit County Commissioner seat being vacated by Bob French. Gibbs's retirement opened up a seat <b>that</b> <b>Republicans</b> viewed as a pickup opportunity.|$|E
5|$|In an {{interview}} with GQ ahead of the Michigan primary in February 2012, McCotter expressed concern <b>that</b> <b>Republicans</b> were underestimating the strength of Democrats, and that winning in the Midwest would be difficult because of the Republicans' position on manufacturing and the Wall Street bailout. He maintained that though he disagreed with Romney on the auto industry bailout, Romney had {{the best chance to}} overcome the obstacles.|$|E

5|$|One {{month before}} the 2008 United States election, 5% of Ohio {{mortgages}} were either severely delinquent or in foreclosure. There were 67,658 foreclosure actions {{in the first half}} of 2008. An editorial in The New York Times purported <b>that</b> <b>Republicans</b> may try to use foreclosure lists to block voters. Brunner warned all election boards that involvement in a foreclosure is not, by itself, sufficient basis for challenging enfranchisement.|$|E
5|$|Despite its stated {{commitment}} to providing politically balanced programming, C-SPAN and its {{shows such as}} Washington Journal, Booknotes, Q & A, and After Words have been accused by some liberal organizations of having a conservative bias. In 2005, the media criticism organization Fairness and Accuracy in Reporting (FAIR) released a study of C-SPAN's morning telephone call-in show Washington Journal, showing <b>that</b> <b>Republicans</b> were favored as guests over Democrats by a two-to-one margin during a six-month period that year, and that people of color are underrepresented. A 2007 survey released by the Center for Economic and Policy Research reported that C-SPAN covered conservative think tanks more than left-of-center think tanks.|$|E
5|$|In the 1994 {{campaign}} season, in {{an effort}} to offer an alternative to Democratic policies and to unite distant wings of the Republican Party, Gingrich and several other Republicans came up with a Contract with America, which laid out ten policies <b>that</b> <b>Republicans</b> promised to bring to a vote on the House floor during the first hundred days of the new Congress, if they won the election. The contract was signed by Gingrich and other Republican candidates for the House of Representatives. The contract ranged from issues such as welfare reform, term limits, tougher crime laws, and a balanced budget law, to more specialized legislation such as restrictions on American military participation in United Nations missions.|$|E

5|$|Due to ill health, Blackburn {{could not}} take {{an active part in}} the {{campaign}}. He sought relief from his ailments at Crab Orchard Springs, while much of the campaign oratory was delivered on his behalf by fellow Democrats Boyd Winchester, Parker Watkins Hardin, W. C. P. Breckinridge, and others. Republicans, who had nominated Walter Evans, had fewer speakers with which to canvass the state, and were at a decided disadvantage. Democrats attacked the administrations of Republican Presidents Ulysses S. Grant and Rutherford B. Hayes, cited the alleged abuses perpetrated in the South by Carpetbaggers and Scalawags, and leveled charges <b>that</b> <b>Republicans</b> favored capitalists over the state's working class. Republican orators, led by William O'Connell Bradley, charged Democrats with financial extravagance, citing a $3million surplus in the state treasury in 1865 compared with a $1million debt in 1878. Bradley claimed that Democrats had maintained their power in the state through gerrymandering election districts. He cited poor conditions at the state penitentiary and inadequate funding of public education as evidence of Democratic mismanagement of the state.|$|E
5|$|Garfield {{during this}} time {{purchased}} the property in Mentor that reporters later dubbed Lawnfield, and from which he would conduct the first successful front porch campaign for the presidency. Hayes suggested that Garfield run for governor in 1879, seeing that as a road that would likely put Garfield in the White House. Garfield preferred to seek election as senator, and devoted his efforts to seeing <b>that</b> <b>Republicans</b> won the 1879 election for the General Assembly, with the likely Democratic candidate the incumbent, Allen G. Thurman. The Republicans swept the legislative elections. Rivals were spoken of for the seat, such as Secretary Sherman, but he had presidential ambitions (for which he sought Garfield's support), and other candidates fell by the wayside. Garfield {{was elected to the}} Senate by the General Assembly in January 1880, though his term was not to begin until March 4, 1881.|$|E
5|$|Philadelphia's {{municipal}} election of November 5, 1957, involved {{the election of}} the district attorney, city controller, and the remainder of a term for one city council seat, as well as several row offices and judgeships. Democrats were successful citywide, continuing a run of victories racked up after the passage of a new city charter in 1951 despite growing divisions between factions of the party. Victor H. Blanc, the incumbent district attorney, led the Democratic ticket to victory. They held the city council seat and took two citywide offices <b>that</b> <b>Republicans</b> had won in 1953. In the judges' elections, most were endorsed by both parties but in the one race that pitted a Democratic candidate against a Republican, the Democrats were successful in seating their candidate, former Congressman Earl Chudoff.|$|E

5|$|The {{compromise}} proposal {{was referred to}} a special committee proposed by Crittenden's fellow Kentucky senator, Lazarus Powell. Though it was believed <b>that</b> <b>Republicans</b> in general, including their representatives on the committee, were disposed to accept Crittenden's compromise or one substantially similar to it, President-elect Lincoln had already instructed his trusted allies in the legislature to resist any plan to extend slavery into the territories. Consequently, when the committee held its first meeting, the Republican members blocked Crittenden's plan and six others from coming to {{the floor for a}} vote. Despite their opposition, however, the Republicans presented no alternative plan. After the rejection of Crittenden's plan in committee, Florida, Mississippi, Alabama, and Georgia followed South Carolina's lead and passed ordinances of secession.|$|E

25|$|Donelon, who {{followed}} in Grisbaum's path, also has ties to Treen. It was then newly inaugurated Governor Treen in 1980, who proposed <b>that</b> <b>Republicans</b> unite behind Donelon {{for the special}} election to choose Treen's congressional successor. In 1996–1997, the Christian Coalition gave him an overall 80 percent rating for that legislative session.|$|E

25|$|Smith {{expected}} <b>that</b> <b>Republicans,</b> who {{had included}} {{equal rights for}} women in their party's platform since 1940, would probably vote for the amendment. Some historians speculate that Smith in addition to helping women was trying to embarrass Northern Democrats, who opposed civil rights for women since labor unions opposed the clause.|$|E
25|$|In June 2016, Republicans in Congress {{attempted}} to attach {{an amendment to}} a bill funding the fight against the Zika virus epidemic that would have reversed the flag ban. It was just one provision of several <b>that</b> <b>Republicans</b> had attached, including an amendment cutting Planned Parenthood funding. Senate Democrats blocked the bill through filibuster.|$|E
25|$|After the {{two terms}} of Democrat Grover Cleveland, the {{election}} of William McKinley in 1896 is widely seen as a resurgence of Republican dominance and is sometimes cited as a realigning election. McKinley promised that high tariffs would end the severe hardship caused by the Panic of 1893, and <b>that</b> <b>Republicans</b> would guarantee a sort of pluralism in which all groups would benefit.|$|E
5000|$|On August 28, The Washington Times {{reported}} <b>that</b> <b>Republican</b> {{legislators in}} South Carolina were [...] "laying plans" [...] {{for a special}} legislative session on whether to impeach Sanford.

25|$|In a {{poll by the}} University of Iowa in July and August 2007 of Iowa Republicans, Obama {{received}} the third-highest percentage, with 7 percent of the vote—more than Republican candidates Mike Huckabee, Sam Brownback, and to-be nominee John McCain combined. Polls by the Washington Post and ABC News indicated <b>that</b> <b>Republicans</b> and independents {{were more likely than}} Democrats to answer that Obama would be the Democrats' best chance to win the election.|$|E
25|$|Georgia was {{the last}} state to fall, with Sonny Perdue taking the {{governorship}} in 2002. Republicans aided the process with redistricting that protected the African-American and Hispanic vote (as required by the Civil Rights laws), but split up the remaining white Democrats so <b>that</b> <b>Republicans</b> mostly would win. In 2006, the Supreme Court endorsed {{nearly all of the}} gerrymandering engineered by Tom DeLay that swung the Texas Congressional delegation to the GOP in 2004. DeLay himself was acquitted on appeal in 2013 of illegally funding the state GOP.|$|E
