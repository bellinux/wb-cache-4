They don't want that kind of competition." [...] A complication with this arrangement was that the South Station bus terminal has only 25 gates (along with two departure gates), all of which were used at the time until other companies left.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{develops}} a continuous approximation {{model of a}} general freight carrier serving a fixed region with an increasing density of demand. <b>Terminal,</b> <b>transportation</b> and relocation costs are considered. As the demand for service by a freight carrier increases, <b>transportation</b> <b>terminals</b> are added to decrease transportation costs. The vehicle routing scheme includes economies of scale for linehaul <b>transportation</b> between <b>terminals.</b> Although the optimal strategy for adding and locating terminals may require knowledge of future demand, myopic strategies may be nearly optimal. Three strategies are considered that provide {{upper and lower bounds}} on the distribution cost from the optimal strategy. Terminal locations are found for each strategy. A myopic strategy with limited capability for relocation is shown to be nearly optimal unless terminal relocation costs are large. ...|$|R

40|$|Good {{establishment}} of <b>transportation</b> <b>terminals</b> (jetties and airports) of coastal towns {{in proportion to}} relevant landuses and urban networks is {{an important element in}} urban tourism planning. Increasing urban network has both positive and negative impacts. Accessibility is chosen as key elements with respect to its critical roles in quality and attraction of coastal tourism. The overall objective {{of this study is to}} develop a decision support tool to plan appropriate locations for jetties, airport and urban transportation network development through the use of spatial technologies to address the issues of accessibility. Langkawi Island, an important tourism city in Malaysia has been chosen as a case study. This method can explain the linkage between accessibility and tourism quality. It covers the optimum accessibility from Jetties and airport to tourism landuses and facilities area. This research has successfully managed to develop a scientifically based approach to convert conceptual configuration of accessible tourism locations into <b>transportation</b> <b>terminals</b> using geospatial technology. It is hoped that this spatial based approach can be employed in transportation planning and urban network suitability assessment at both the local and structure plan levels...|$|R
