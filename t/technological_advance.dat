5|$|During the 1980s, McDonnell Douglas studied an AH-64B, {{featuring}} {{an updated}} cockpit, new fire control system and other upgrades. In 1988, funding was approved for a multi-stage upgrade program to improve sensor and weapon systems. <b>Technological</b> <b>advance</b> {{led to the}} program's cancellation {{in favor of more}} ambitious changes. In August 1990, development of the AH-64D Apache Longbow was approved by the Defense Acquisition Board. The first AH-64D prototype flew on 15 April 1992, prototype testing ended in April 1995. During testing, six AH-64D helicopters were pitted against a numerically superior group of AH-64A helicopters; the results demonstrated the AH-64D to have a seven times increase in survivability and four times increase in lethality compared to the AH-64A. On 13 October 1995, full-scale production was approved; a $1.9-billion five-year contract was signed in August 1996 to rebuild 232 AH-64As to AH-64D standard. On 17 March 1997, the first production AH-64D first flew, it was delivered on 31 March.|$|E
5|$|The {{importance}} of infantry and light cavalry {{began to decline}} during the early Carolingian period, with a growing dominance of elite heavy cavalry. The use of militia-type levies of the free population declined over the Carolingian period. Although much of the Carolingian armies were mounted, a large proportion during the early period {{appear to have been}} mounted infantry, rather than true cavalry. One exception was Anglo-Saxon England, where the armies were still composed of regional levies, known as the fyrd, which were led by the local elites. In military technology, one of the main changes was the return of the crossbow, which had been known in Roman times and reappeared as a military weapon during {{the last part of the}} Early Middle Ages. Another change was the introduction of the stirrup, which increased the effectiveness of cavalry as shock troops. A <b>technological</b> <b>advance</b> that had implications beyond the military was the horseshoe, which allowed horses to be used in rocky terrain.|$|E

25|$|In 1975, Sebastian von Hoerner {{proposed}} {{a formula for}} population growth which represented hyperbolic growth with an infinite population in 2025. The hyperbolic growth of the world population observed until the 1970s was later correlated to a non-linear second order positive feedback between demographic growth and technological development. This feedback {{can be described as}} follows: <b>technological</b> <b>advance</b> → increase in the carrying capacity of land for people → demographic growth → more people → more potential inventors → acceleration of <b>technological</b> <b>advance</b> → accelerating growth of the carrying capacity → faster population growth → accelerating growth of the number of potential inventors → faster <b>technological</b> <b>advance</b> → hence, the faster growth of the Earth's carrying capacity for people, and so on. The transition from hyperbolic growth to slower rates of growth is related to the demographic transition.|$|E

25|$|A major <b>technological</b> <b>advance</b> was {{the design}} of the Dutch {{merchant}} ship known as the fluyt. Unlike rivals, it was not built for possible conversion in wartime to a warship, so it was cheaper to build and carried twice the cargo, and could be handled by a smaller crew. Construction by specialized shipyards using new tools made it half the cost of rival ships. The factors combined to sharply lower the cost of transportation for Dutch merchants, giving them a major competitive advantage.|$|E

25|$|Trinity Chain Pier, {{originally}} called Trinity Pier of Suspension, {{was built}} in Trinity, Edinburgh, Scotland in 1821. The pier was designed by Samuel Brown, a pioneer of chains and suspension bridges. It was intended to serve ferry traffic on the routes between Edinburgh and the smaller ports around the Firth of Forth, and was built {{during a time of}} rapid <b>technological</b> <b>advance.</b> It was well used for its original purpose for less than twenty years before traffic was attracted to newly developed nearby ports, and it was mainly used for most of its life for sea bathing. It was destroyed by a storm in 1898; a building at the shore end survives, much reconstructed, as a pub and restaurant called the Old Chain Pier.|$|E
25|$|Colonization of {{asteroid}}s {{would require}} space habitats. The asteroid belt has significant overall material available, the largest object being Ceres, {{although it is}} thinly distributed as it covers a vast region of space. Unmanned supply craft should be practical with little <b>technological</b> <b>advance,</b> even crossing 500 million kilometers of space. The colonists would have {{a strong interest in}} assuring their asteroid did not hit Earth or any other body of significant mass, but would have extreme difficulty in moving an asteroid of any size. The orbits of the Earth and most asteroids are very distant from each other in terms of delta-v and the asteroidal bodies have enormous momentum. Rockets or mass drivers can perhaps be installed on asteroids to direct their path into a safe course.|$|E

25|$|There {{are many}} {{theories}} {{for the cause}} of the Viking invasions. The will to explore likely played a major role. At the time England, Wales and Ireland were vulnerable to attack, being divided into many different warring kingdoms in a state of internal disarray, while the Franks were well defended. Over-population on the mainland was highly influential. <b>Technological</b> <b>advance</b> like the use of iron, or a shortage of women due to selective female infanticide also had an impact. Tension caused by Frankish expansion to the south of Scandinavia and their subsequent attacks upon the Viking peoples. Harald I of Norway ("Harald Fairhair") had united Norway around this time and displaced many peoples. Resultingly, these people sought for new bases to launch counter-raids against Harald.|$|E
25|$|The {{high cost}} of health care in the United States is {{attributed}} variously to <b>technological</b> <b>advance,</b> administration costs, drug pricing, suppliers charging more for medical equipment, the receiving of more medical care than people in other countries, the high wages of doctors, government regulations, the impact of lawsuits, and third party payment systems insulating consumers from the full cost of treatments. The lowest prices for pharmaceuticals, medical devices, and payments to physicians are in government plans. Americans tend to receive more medical care than people do in other countries, which is a notable contributor to higher costs. In the United States, a person is more likely to receive open heart surgery after a heart attack than in other countries. Medicaid pays less than Medicare for many prescription drugs due to the fact Medicaid discounts are set by law, whereas Medicare prices are negotiated by private insurers and drug companies. Government plans often pay less than overhead, resulting in healthcare providers shifting the cost to the privately insured through higher prices.|$|E
500|$|From 1926 onwards, Elgar made {{a series}} of {{recordings}} of his own works. Described by the music writer Robert Philip as [...] "the first composer to take the gramophone seriously", he had already recorded much of his music by the early acoustic-recording process for His Master's Voice (HMV) from 1914 onwards, but the introduction of electrical microphones in 1925 transformed the gramophone from a novelty into a realistic medium for reproducing orchestral and choral music. Elgar was the first composer {{to take full advantage of}} this <b>technological</b> <b>advance.</b> Fred Gaisberg of HMV, who produced Elgar's recordings, set up a series of sessions to capture on disc the composer's interpretations of his major orchestral works, including the Enigma Variations, Falstaff, the first and second symphonies, and the cello and violin concertos. For most of these, the orchestra was the LSO, but the Variations were played by the Royal Albert Hall Orchestra. Later in the series of recordings, Elgar also conducted two newly founded orchestras, Boult's BBC Symphony Orchestra and Sir Thomas Beecham's London Philharmonic Orchestra.|$|E

500|$|The Warrior-class design used many well-proven {{technologies}} {{that had been}} used in ocean-going ships for years, including her iron hull, steam engine, and screw propeller; only her wrought-iron armour was a major <b>technological</b> <b>advance.</b> Naval architect and historian David K. Brown wrote, [...] "What made [...] truly novel was the way in which these individual aspects were blended together, making her the biggest and most powerful warship in the world." [...] Being faster, better armoured and harder to hit than her rivals, she was superior to any existing naval ship. The Admiralty immediately stopped the construction of all wooden ships of the line, and ordered another eleven ironclads over the next few years. Jacky Fisher, who was the ship's gunnery lieutenant in 1863–64, later wrote that in spite of this, most people did not realise at the time what a significant change it would bring about: [...] "It certainly was not appreciated that this, our first armourclad ship of war, would cause a fundamental change in what had been in vogue for something like a thousand years." ...|$|E
500|$|Denning {{writes that}} the real {{challenge}} is keeping up with technological change, and in this sense, scientific management was the key American <b>technological</b> <b>advance</b> in the 20th century. It allowed American companies to provide large numbers of jobs to semi-skilled workers through supply-chain management, hierarchies, and rule-based systems. Businesses must now adjust to well-informed consumers who disdain profiteering and wish to be [...] "delighted". A related challenge is shifting from managing semi-skilled to knowledge workers. The Economist contrasted the [...] "Great Stagnation" [...] thesis with the [...] "Great Divergence" [...] which traces the pay gap to an increasing demand for skilled workers. Timothy Noah, writing in Slate, did not share Cowen's optimism {{about the future of}} American educational attainment on the basis that President Obama [...] "is getting tough" [...] on teachers' unions. There have been many reforms implemented in the last thirty years that the unions initially opposed, and the United States has poorer outcomes than many OECD countries with stronger unions. Noah reminds us that the earlier authors were optimistic about increased third level enrollment and that has since fallen as have graduation rates. The United States remains significantly behind other advanced countries in educational outcomes offering a perverse hope for improvement.|$|E
