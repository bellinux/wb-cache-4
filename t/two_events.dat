5|$|The 2007–2008 Nazko {{earthquake}} swarm {{is one of}} numerous seismic events that have occurred near volcanoes in British Columbia. Volcanoes that have experienced volcanic earthquakes include Mount Meager (seventeen events), Mount Cayley (four events), Mount Garibaldi (three events), Silverthrone Caldera (<b>two</b> <b>events),</b> Castle Rock (<b>two</b> <b>events),</b> Hoodoo Mountain (eight events), Crow Lagoon (four events), The Volcano (five events), and the Mount Edziza volcanic complex (eight events). Seismic data suggest that these volcanoes still contain active magma chambers, indicating possible future eruptive activity. Although the available data do not allow a clear conclusion, these observations are indications that some of Canada's volcanoes may be active, with significant potential dangers. This seismic activity correlates both with some of Canada's most youthful volcanoes and with long-lived volcanoes {{with a history of}} significant explosive activity, such as Hoodoo Mountain and the Mount Edziza volcanic complex.|$|E
5|$|The {{same week}} as the {{memorial}} dedication, the National Transportation Safety Board held hearings related to another fatal incident in the Metro system, one which happened earlier in 2015; the juxtaposition of the <b>two</b> <b>events</b> was noted by some commentators.|$|E

5|$|At {{least two}} episodes of {{earthquakes}} constitute the Nazko swarm. In the first seismic phase from October 9 to November 1, 2007, {{a total of}} 153 earthquakes took place. During the second seismic phase between September 25, 2007 and June 12, 2008, 4,428 earthquakes occurred. These two seismic episodes were cross-correlated by scientists to understand changes {{in the development of}} the earthquake swarm. Correlation coefficients were around 1.0 for the beginnings of the periods of activity, indicating almost identical situations, and then decayed to around 0.5, indicating a decrease in similarity between the later stages of the <b>two</b> <b>events.</b>|$|E
5|$|Auburn University student Arianna Vanderpool-Wallace {{participated in}} <b>two</b> <b>events</b> at Beijing: the 50meters freestyle, and the 100meters freestyle.

Vanderpool-Wallace {{was placed in the}} eighth heat, which was led by Israel's Anna Gostomelsky, Vanderpool-Wallace, and the Czech Republic's Sandra Kazikova. She ranked second with a time of 25.40seconds, whereas heat leader Gostomelsky finished at 25.23seconds, and third-place finalist Kazikova finished at 25.54seconds. Overall, out of the 92 participating athletes, Vanderpool-Wallace ranked 24th. She did not advance to later rounds.|$|E
5|$|Eva also visited Switzerland {{during her}} European tour, a visit {{that has been}} viewed as {{the worst part of}} the trip. According to the book Evita: A Biography by John Barnes, while she {{traveled}} down a street with many people crowding her car, someone threw two stones and smashed the windshield. She threw her hands up in shock, but was not injured. Later, while sitting with the Foreign Minister, protesters threw tomatoes at her. The tomatoes hit the Foreign Minister and splattered on Eva's dress. After these <b>two</b> <b>events,</b> Eva had had enough, and after two months returned to Argentina.|$|E

In 2015, this decision was reversed, and <b>two</b> <b>events</b> were scheduled, in April and October.|$|E
5|$|Four British athletes {{competed in}} alpine skiing {{events at the}} Games.

The preparations of Britain's skiers were disrupted {{by the collapse of}} Snowsport GB, but all athletes were able to enter the games after the intervention of the British Olympic Association. Alcott, considered a realistic contender for a medal, achieved the squad's best finish coming eleventh in the women's combined.|$|E

5|$|Lacking an infield {{lighting}} system, {{cars were}} driven inside the stadium to illuminate {{it for the}} last <b>two</b> <b>events</b> of the decathlon. The cycling tandem event, which {{was held in the}} dark, was another example of the main venue's lighting issues. After the Games it was used as the English national football stadium, hosting numerous concerts and sporting events, including the 1966 FIFA World Cup Final and the British leg of Live Aid in 1985. It was closed in 2000, and demolished three years later to allow the construction of the new Wembley Stadium.|$|E

5|$|Regular races were {{organised}} until 1903, when <b>two</b> <b>events</b> were held; {{these were}} the last for 24years, perhaps due to {{the closure of the}} summit observatory the following year.

The second race ran from new Fort William post office, and MacKenzie lowered the record to 2hours 10minutes, a record he held for 34years.|$|E
