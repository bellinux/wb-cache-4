Gods change sex or manifest as an Avatar {{of the opposite sex}} in order to facilitate sexual congress. Non-divine beings also undergo sex-changes through the actions of the gods, as the result of curses or blessings, or as the natural outcome of reincarnation.|$|E

5|$|Given this, it {{is unfortunate}} that the Cypria—the part of the Epic Cycle that covers the period of the Trojan War of Troilus' death—does not survive. Indeed, no {{complete}} narrative of his story remains from archaic <b>times</b> <b>or</b> the subsequent classical period (479–323 BC). Most of the literary sources from before the Hellenistic age (323–30 BC) that even referred to the character are lost or survive only in fragments or summary. The surviving ancient and medieval sources, whether literary or scholarly, contradict each other, and many do not tally with the form of the myth that scholars now believe to have existed in the archaic and classical periods.|$|E
5|$|Media {{and fans}} of college {{football}} consider the UT program {{one of the great}} powerhouses of the game because of the school's winning record as well as their previous national championships in 1963, 1969 and 1970. From 1936 to 2004, the team finished the season in the top ten team of the Associated Press Poll 23 <b>times,</b> <b>or</b> one-third of the time. At the start of the 2005 season, the Longhorns were one of the most victorious programs in college football history; they were third in total victories and fourth if measured by winning percentage.|$|E
5|$|Queens Park Rangers' record appearance-maker is Tony Ingham, {{who made}} 555 {{appearances}} in his QPR career between 1950 and 1963. Nine other players have {{made more than}} 400 appearances, the most recent being Kevin Gallen, who has made the ninth-highest number of appearances with 414 matches, scoring 104 goals in the process. George Goddard is the club's top goalscorer with 186 goals in his seven years with the club. Other than Goddard and Gallen, only Brian Bedford, Rodney Marsh and Don Givens have scored more than 100 goals for the club. As of 11th August 2017, 180 players have appeared 100 <b>times</b> <b>or</b> more for QPR, 34 have played 250 or more and 10 players 400 or more games.|$|E

5|$|Since 1900, 118Category4 hurricanes {{have been}} {{recorded}} in the eastern and central Pacific basins. Of these, thirteen have attained Category4 status {{on more than one}} occasion, by weakening to a status on the Saffir–Simpson Hurricane Scale lower than Category4 and later restrengthening into a Category4. Such storms are demarcated by the dates they first attained and the final time they lost the intensity. Only two storms, Hurricane Fico in 1978 and Hurricane Norbert in 1984, reached Category4 status three <b>times</b> <b>or</b> more.|$|E
5|$|The {{chemical}} {{reacts with}} moisture {{on the skin}} and in the eyes, causing a burning sensation and the immediate forceful and uncontrollable shutting of the eyes. Effects usually include tears streaming from the eyes, profuse coughing, exceptional nasal discharge that is full of mucus, burning in the eyes, eyelids, nose and throat areas, disorientation, dizziness and restricted breathing. It will also burn the skin where sweaty and/or sunburned. In highly concentrated doses it can also induce severe coughing and vomiting. Almost all of the immediate effects wear off within an hour (such as exceptional nasal discharge and profuse coughing), although the feeling of burning and highly irritated skin may persist for hours. Affected clothing {{will need to be}} washed several <b>times</b> <b>or</b> thrown away.|$|E

5|$|Diamond-bearing rock {{is carried}} from the mantle to the Earth's surface by deep-origin {{volcanic}} eruptions. The magma {{for such a}} volcano must originate at a depth where diamonds can be formed— or more (three <b>times</b> <b>or</b> more the depth of source magma for most volcanoes). This is a relatively rare occurrence. These typically small surface volcanic craters extend downward in formations known as volcanic pipes. The pipes contain material that was transported toward the surface by volcanic action, but was not ejected before the volcanic activity ceased. During eruption these pipes {{are open to the}} surface, resulting in open circulation; many xenoliths of surface rock and even wood and fossils are found in volcanic pipes. Diamond-bearing volcanic pipes are closely related to the oldest, coolest regions of continental crust (cratons). This is because cratons are very thick, and their lithospheric mantle extends to great enough depth that diamonds are stable. Not all pipes contain diamonds, and even fewer contain enough diamonds to make mining economically viable.|$|E
5|$|IQ tests {{generally}} are reliable enough {{that most people}} ages ten and older have similar IQ scores throughout life. Still, some individuals score very differently when taking the same test at different <b>times</b> <b>or</b> when taking more than one kind of IQ test at the same age. For example, many children in the famous longitudinal Genetic Studies of Genius begun in 1921 by Lewis Terman showed declines in IQ as they grew up. Terman recruited school pupils based on referrals from teachers, and gave them his Stanford–Binet IQ test. Children with an IQ above 140 by that test {{were included in the}} study. There were 643 children in the main study group. When the students who could be contacted again (503 students) were retested at high school age, they were found to have dropped 9 IQ points on average in Stanford–Binet IQ. More than two dozen children dropped by 15 IQ points and six by 25 points or more. Yet parents of those children thought that the children were still as bright as ever, or even brighter.|$|E
5|$|The player {{interacts with}} {{characters}} and objects by clicking on them. Clicking {{on the ground}} causes the player's selected characters to move. The gameplay, though in real-time, can be paused, whereupon commands may be issued to controllable characters, who will attempt to execute them when the game is unpaused. The game can also be set to pause automatically at certain times. Dialogue is started by NPCs at certain scripted <b>times,</b> <b>or</b> by the player's clicking on NPCs who are not immediately hostile. When speaking to an NPC, the player must often choose what to say {{from a list of}} responses. The dialogue may lead to quests or important information. When the player clicks on a hostile being, the currently selected characters will advance to attack it. Information about characters, creatures, items, and buildings in the game environment is shown on a tool tip, which appears when the mouse pointer is held over game elements.|$|E
