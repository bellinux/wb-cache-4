His health affected him badly during the writing process and he dropped from his usual rate of two thousand words a morning <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> over an hour's worth of work a day.|$|E
5|$|Although the {{zygomatic}} plates (plates of bone at {{the side}} of the skull) are variable, their size is generally intermediate for the Akodon boliviensis group and their front margin ranges from straight <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> concave. The zygomatic notches, projections at the front of the plates, are better developed than in A.caenosus and A.sylvanus. The incisive foramina (openings in the front part of the palate) are long, sometimes extending between the first upper molars. Tiny posterolateral palatal pits are located at the back of the palate. The back margin of the palate is squared to rounded, with a spine in the middle (medial process) sometimes present. The opening behind the palate, the mesopterygoid fossa, is of intermediate width, being narrower than in A.sylvanus, A.simulator, and A.budini but broader than in A.caenosus.|$|E
5|$|Classified as a red supergiant of {{spectral}} type M1-2, {{the star}} {{is one of the}} largest and most luminous stars visible to the naked eye. If Betelgeuse were at the center of the Solar System, its surface would extend past the asteroid belt, wholly engulfing the orbits of Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, and possibly Jupiter. Calculations of its mass range from slightly under ten <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> over twenty times that of the Sun. It is calculated to be 640 light-years away, yielding an absolute magnitude of about −6. Less than 10 million years old, Betelgeuse has evolved rapidly because of its high mass. Having been ejected from its birthplace in the Orion OB1 Association—which includes the stars in Orion's Belt—this runaway star has been observed moving through the interstellar medium at a speed of 30km/s, creating a bow shock over 4 light-years wide. Currently in a late stage of stellar evolution, the supergiant is expected to explode as a supernova within the next million years.|$|E

5|$|From 1872 until 1879, the nationalities {{forming the}} bulk of the new {{settlers}} were composed of Portuguese (31.2%), Italians (25.8%), Germans (8.1%) and Spanish (1.9%). In the 1880s, Italians would surpass the Portuguese (61.8% to 23.3% respectively), and the Spanish would displace the Germans (6.7% to 4.2% respectively). Other, smaller groups also arrived, including Russians, Poles and Hungarians. Since nearly all European immigrants settled in the southeastern and southern areas of the Empire, ethnic distribution, already unequal before the mass immigration, became even more divergent between regions. For a nation that had a small, widely scattered population (4,000,000 in 1823 and 14,333,915 in 1890), the immigration of more than 1,380,000 Europeans had a tremendous effect upon the country's ethnic composition. In 1872, the year of the first reliable national census, white Brazilians represented just over a third (38.1%) of the total population; in 1890, they had increased <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> under half (44.0%) of all Brazilians.|$|E
5|$|While racing for {{position}} on lap 23, Sainz forced Jolyon Palmer {{off the track}} in turn two and was later handed a ten-second time penalty for the incident. Four laps later, Pascal Wehrlein tried to overtake Felipe Nasr for 16th, but was unsuccessful and in turn lost a position to Kvyat. His teammate Ricciardo overtook Kevin Magnussen for eighth on lap 29, but lost the position again and was in turn passed by Romain Grosjean. As Nico Rosberg started to lap backmarkers on lap 31, the gap to second-placed Hamilton started to come down, with his advantage dropping from more than eleven seconds <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> more than seven seconds by lap 36. Meanwhile, Verstappen was forced to retire due to power unit failure on lap 34, while running in sixth place. As Hamilton was told by his pit crew that he suffered from a water pressure problem, his gap to Rosberg started to increase again, staying at 13 seconds by lap 41. Wehrlein made a pit stop for new tyres on the same lap, but problems with his stop forced him stationary for almost a minute, resulting in him moving into last place on the road.|$|E

25|$|In Britain, {{rationing}} {{was finally}} imposed in early 1918, limited to meat, sugar, and fats (butter and margarine), but not bread. The new system worked smoothly.

25|$|Badarian flint tools {{continued}} {{to develop into}} sharper and more shapely blades, and the first faience was developed. Distinctly Badarian sites have been located from Nekhen <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> north of Abydos. It appears that the Fayum A culture and the Badarian and Tasian Periods overlapped significantly; however, the Fayum A culture was considerably less agricultural and was still Neolithic in nature.|$|E
25|$|If the {{prevailing}} fashion be {{to reject the}} long sleeve, and to partially display the arm, let the glove advance considerably above the elbow, and there be fastened with a draw-string or armlet. But this should only be the case when the arm is muscular, coarse, or scraggy. When it is fair, smooth, and round, it will admit of the glove being pushed down <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> above the wrists.|$|E

25|$|In {{promotion}} of the record, Smith and Urie filmed a short film to accompany the album, titled The Overture. Directed by Shane Drake, the film was released on March 9, 2011 and contains several musical snippets from the record. The nearly seven-minute mini-film, features Urie and Smith with a score of actors ranging from identical twins <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> people couple. The film is filled with symbolism regarding the departure of Ross and Walker, {{and the process of}} moving on without them.|$|E
25|$|The League's {{publications}} {{included a}} quarterly newsletter, The Ypres Times (first published in October 1921, and still being published {{as late as}} 1938), and books such as The Immortal Salient (1925), a historical record of the battles and a guide for pilgrims to Ypres. An account of {{the horror of the}} conditions on the Ypres Salient, written by the war correspondent Philip Gibbs, was used for the League's information leaflets. Planned publications included the Ypres Book of Valour. The League also had a marching song, called Tramping along <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> tin whistle and an old toy drum, a version of which was published in 1926.|$|E
25|$|When Aydrian matured he {{left the}} elves after overpowering the Queen in a magical test of wills. Upon his {{journeys}} he came <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> town where he took up the Ranger name of Nighthawk, as his father's was called Nightbird. During his journeys he met his parent's sworn enemy Marcalo De'Unnero (who had become a Weretiger). They allied and began to plot until Aydrian killed King Danube and took the throne for himself. As king he threw the lands into war and was eventually defeated by the King's Brother Midalis who fought alongside Aydrian's mother Pony, his former friend who was a ranger-in-training with him Brynn Dharielle, a Jhesta Tu mystic Pagonel, a large barbarian ranger Andacanvar, and the dragon Agradeleous.|$|E

25|$|After a {{visit to}} Yosemite Valley, the Grants resumed their {{cross-country}} journey ultimately bound for Philadelphia, eventually arriving there on December 16, 1879. The Grant's stopped briefly in the Utah Territory and then Nebraska, amazed with all the new development and railroads along the way, and continued on to Galena, Illinois where they were received with a large reception. There the Grants resided in a furnished home, resting there for several weeks after the initial fanfare subsided. Before leaving, Ulysses expressed his disappointment about Galena, that it once was a prosperous river front city, but now was reduced <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> backwater community that had been bypassed by all the new railroads.|$|E
25|$|I {{discovered}} {{a dark and}} hairy creature on a branch... The sedapa was also hairy {{on the front of}} its body; the colour there was a little lighter than on the back. The very dark hair on its head fell to just below the shoulder-blades or even almost to the waist... Had it been standing, its arms would have reached <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> above its knees; they were therefore long, but its legs seemed to me rather short. I did not see its feet, but I did see some toes which were shaped in a very normal manner... There was nothing repulsive or ugly about its face, nor was it at all apelike.|$|E
25|$|Tolls rose <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> over £1,000 per year, but the Commissioners {{decided that}} the canal boats damaged the locks, and all traffic had to be {{transferred}} to river barges. This order was withdrawn in 1827, but the condition of the river gradually deteriorated, and the arrival of the Blisworth to Peterborough Railway in 1845 further reduced profitability. Flooding was also a problem, but the Commissioners had no powers to act as Commissioners of Sewers, to address the problems of drainage. With serious flooding in December 1848, a public meeting was held, and a committee was elected to consider Nene drainage. The main problem was a restriction at Wisbech, and the engineer James Rendel estimated that £120,000 was required to reconstruct the river below Peterborough. The Nene Valley Drainage and Improvement Act was obtained in 1852, to allow this work to be completed.|$|E
