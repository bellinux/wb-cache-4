5|$|Both ships {{served in}} the active duty {{squadron}} early in their careers, and participated in the Italo-Turkish War of 1911–12. They {{took part in the}} Italian offensives in North Africa and the island of Rhodes, but did not see combat with the Ottoman fleet. They were reduced to harbor defense ships by the outbreak of World War I, and <b>they</b> <b>spent</b> <b>the</b> war in Venice. The ships were discarded shortly {{after the end of the}} war, both having been stricken in 1920.|$|E
5|$|Both {{ships were}} in the Second Squadron of the Mediterranean Fleet at the {{outbreak}} of World War I in August 1914. They participated in the Battle of Antivari in mid-August and unsuccessfully attempted to lure out the Austro-Hungarian battle fleet. <b>They</b> <b>spent</b> <b>the</b> {{early part of the}} war based at Corfu, Navarino and Malta, to keep the Austro-Hungarians bottled up in the Adriatic Sea. In 1916 the ships supported Allied operations in Salonica and also detached landing parties to support the Allied attempt to force Greek acquiescence for those operations in Athens on 1 December. <b>They</b> <b>spent</b> <b>the</b> rest of the war at Salonica and Athens. Patrie became flagship of the French squadron at Salonica in 1918. After the end of the war, both ships were placed in reserve in 1919. République was disarmed in 1920 and stricken from the naval register in 1921 and subsequently broken up for scrap. Patrie was retained longer, serving as a training ship in Toulon for mechanics and torpedomen until 1927, when she too was stricken and sold for scrap.|$|E
5|$|On 7 September 1909 two {{visitors}} were left stranded {{at the top}} of the tower as the final lift car of the night descended without them.

5|$|Suggestions {{to explain}} the mythical blue men include {{that they may be}} a {{personification}} of the sea, or originate with the Picts, whose painted bodies may have given the impression of men raising themselves out of the water if they were seen crossing the sea in boats that might have resembled kayaks. The genesis of the blue men may alternatively lie with the North African slaves the Vikings took with them to Scotland, where <b>they</b> <b>spent</b> <b>the</b> winter months close to the Shiant Isles in the Minch.|$|E
5|$|The {{fighting}} around Passchendaele {{proved to}} be the division's last offensive actions for 1917 and <b>they</b> <b>spent</b> <b>the</b> winter months in the rear training, or undertaking defensive duties in reasonably quiet sectors of the line as they were reformed and brought back up to strength. Around this time also, the five Australian divisions on the Western Front were reorganised into a unified command structure under the Australian Corps.|$|E

5|$|They {{relieved}} {{elements of}} the Royal Naval Brigade, with the regiment taking over from the Nelson and Deal Battalions, on the right flank. One squadron occupied the front line, one squadron the support trench, and the third was the reserve. The regiment was on the left, the Auckland Mounted Rifles in the centre, and the Canterbury Mounted Rifles on the right. <b>They</b> <b>spent</b> <b>the</b> next few days improving the fire trenches, constructing communications trenches, and enlarging tracks so men and guns could move forward quickly.

5|$|After {{returning}} to the United States, Monroe took an 18-month hiatus from work to concentrate on married life on the East Coast. She and Miller split their time between their Manhattan apartment and an eighteenth-century farmhouse that they purchased in Roxbury, Connecticut; <b>they</b> <b>spent</b> <b>the</b> summer in Amagansett, Long Island. She became pregnant in mid-1957, but it was ectopic {{and had to be}} terminated. She suffered a miscarriage a year later. Her gynecological problems were largely caused by endometriosis, a disease from which she suffered throughout her adult life. Monroe was also briefly hospitalized during this time due to a barbiturate overdose. During the hiatus, she dismissed Greene from MMP and bought his share of the company as they could not settle their disagreements and she had begun to suspect that he was embezzling money from the company.|$|E
5|$|After the Danish Reformation, {{involving}} {{the suppression of}} the Catholic bishopric in 1536, the city enjoyed a sustained period of prosperity from the 1530s to the mid-17th century, becoming northern Funen's commercial centre. One of the main sources of income was the sale of cattle, providing substantial funds for the construction of fine half-timbered houses for the local merchants. The local nobility also participated in the city's development by building residences where <b>they</b> <b>spent</b> <b>the</b> winter months. But the city's prosperity came to an abrupt end in the late 1650s heavy taxes were imposed {{after the end of the}} Swedish Wars. A period of stagnation ensued until the end of the 18th century.|$|E
5|$|Early {{the next}} day the NZMRB moved towards Katia, with the {{intention}} of attacking a Turkish gun emplacement. The brigade positioned itself between the 2nd Light Horse Brigade on the left and the 3rd Light Horse Brigade on the right. Taking the lead, the regiment advanced close enough by 14:30 to charge the position on horseback, then dismounted and continued the attack on foot, all in the face of heavy rifle and machine-gun fire. No progress was made and <b>they</b> <b>spent</b> <b>the</b> rest of the day returning fire from cover. The engagement cost the regiment one dead and six wounded.|$|E

5|$|In the meantime, Nhu {{prepared}} the Army of the Republic of Vietnam Special Forces commanded by Colonel Lê Quang Tung— {{who took his}} orders directly from Nhu and not the senior generals— for the raids. An American-trained outfit created to fight the Việt Cộng, the Special Forces were better-equipped, better-trained and better-paid than the regular army, but were used by the Ngô family as a private army for repressing dissidents and protecting their rule, rather than fighting for the national interest. As such, <b>they</b> <b>spent</b> <b>the</b> majority {{of their time in}} Saigon warding off coup attempts. Tung brought more Special Forces into Saigon, bringing the total from two to four battalions in the capital.|$|E
5|$|Italy {{initially}} remained neutral during World War I, but by 1915, {{had been}} convinced by the Triple Entente {{to enter the}} war against Germany and Austria-Hungary. Both the Italians and Austro-Hungarians adopted a cautious fleet policy in the confined waters of the Adriatic Sea, and so the four Regina Elena-class battleships did not see action. <b>They</b> <b>spent</b> <b>the</b> war rotating between the naval bases at Taranto, Brindisi, and Valona. After {{the end of the}} war, the ships of the class were included amongst the battleships that Italy could keep in service (by the terms of the Washington Naval Treaty), but they were retained only for a few years. Between February 1923 and September 1926, all four ships were stricken from the naval register and broken up for scrap.|$|E
5|$|Later in 1916, République, Patrie, and the {{surviving}} s supported Allied operations in Salonica and also detached landing parties {{to support the}} Allied attempt to force Greek acquiescence for those operations in Athens on 1 December. <b>They</b> <b>spent</b> <b>the</b> rest of the war at Salonica and Athens. During the war, four of Républiques 3-pounder guns were converted into anti-aircraft guns with new high-angle mounts. After {{the end of the}} war, République was placed in reserve in 1919, along with Patrie. She was disarmed the following year and subsequently stricken from the naval register in 1921 and broken up for scrap.|$|E

5|$|République and Patrie {{served in}} the Mediterranean Fleet for the {{duration}} of their careers, including the entirety of World War I. They saw action at the Battle of Antivari in August 1914 and spent most of 1914–15 blockading the Straits of Otranto to prevent Austro-Hungarian warships from breaking out into the Mediterranean. They both contributed some of their crews to the attempt to ensure Greek acquiescence to Allied operations in Macedonia in Athens in late 1916. <b>They</b> <b>spent</b> <b>the</b> rest of the war based in Athens or Salonica. After the end of the war, République was placed in reserve in 1919, disarmed in 1920 and sold for scrapping in 1921; Patrie was placed in reserve as well in 1919 and served as a training ship from 1920, until she was stricken in 1927 and she too was sold to the ship-breakers in 1928.|$|E
5|$|The Continental Army {{had retreated}} from Quebec to Fort Ticonderoga and Fort Crown Point in June 1776 after British forces were massively reinforced. <b>They</b> <b>spent</b> <b>the</b> summer of 1776 fortifying those forts, and {{building}} additional ships {{to augment the}} small American fleet already on the lake. General Carleton had a 9,000 man army at Fort Saint-Jean, but needed to build a fleet to carry it on the lake. The Americans, during their retreat, had either taken or destroyed most of the ships on the lake. By early October, the British fleet, which significantly outgunned the American fleet, was ready for launch.|$|E
