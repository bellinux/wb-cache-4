Rodman attended to the most severely wounded victim.|$|E
5|$|I {{would hold}} <b>that</b> <b>officers</b> {{must have some}} level of particularized {{suspicion}} in order to conduct a seizure and search {{like the one at}} issue here, because (1) seizing oneâ€™s personal property deprives the individual of his valid possessory interest in his property, and (2) authorizing a generalized computer forensic search (untethered to any particularized suspicion) permits the Government to engage in the type of generalized fishing expeditions that the Fourth Amendment is designed to prevent.|$|E
5|$|In 2004, Nayyouf gave an {{interview}} to the Dutch newspaper De Telegraaf in which he claimed that Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein hid his arsenal {{of weapons of mass}} destruction in Syria before the United States invaded Iraq in 2003. Nayyouf claimed <b>that</b> <b>officers</b> of the Special Republican Guard organized the smuggling in collaboration with relatives of Bashar al-Assad including Dhu al-Himma Shalish and Assif Shoakat, who is also CEO of Bhaha, an import/export company owned by the Assad family. Nayyouf identified sites near the cities of al-Baida, Tell Sinan, and Sjinsjar as alleged holding sites for Iraqi WMDs.|$|E

5|$|The program {{suggests}} that the reaction time of state-run television crews and police on Tiananmen Square demonstrates they had advance knowledge of the event. They observed <b>that</b> <b>officers</b> arrived almost immediately on the scene equipped with numerous fire extinguishers. Fire extinguishers are not standard equipment for police on Tiananmen Square; the nearest building that would house them was several minutes away from the scene.|$|E
5|$|Another {{burden of}} his {{promotion}} to First Lord of the Admiralty was that St Vincent was inundated with letters from aspiring officers {{and their relatives}} and friends. Soliciting employment from those in positions of influence in the navy had become common practice and was a generally accepted method of securing a good posting. The more influence that an officer could draw upon, the better and often more lucrative the position. Also, due to the peace with France the navy had been reduced and employment was scarce. The First Lord could not, therefore, provide every officer of influence a position and was obliged to reject many of the letters that he received. Despite St Vincent having declared both publicly and privately <b>that</b> <b>officers</b> would be promoted or given position commensurate with their achievements and not based on their political or social influence, the letters continued to flow to the Admiralty.|$|E
5|$|Lenin tasked Trotsky with {{establishing}} a Workers' and Peasants' Red Army, {{and with his}} support, Trotsky organised a Revolutionary Military Council in September 1918, remaining its chairman until 1925. Recognising their valuable military experience, Lenin agreed <b>that</b> <b>officers</b> from the old Tsarist army could serve in the Red Army, although Trotsky established military councils to monitor their activities. The Reds held control of Russia's two largest cities, Moscow and Petrograd, {{as well as most}} of Great Russia, while the Whites were located largely on the former Empire's peripheries. The latter were therefore hindered by being both fragmented and geographically scattered, and because their ethnic Russian supremacism alienated the region's national minorities. Anti-Bolshevik armies carried out the White Terror, a campaign of violence against perceived Bolshevik supporters which was typically more spontaneous than the state-sanctioned Red Terror. Both White and Red Armies were responsible for attacks against Jewish communities, prompting Lenin to issue a condemnation of anti-Semitism, blaming prejudice against Jews on capitalist propaganda.|$|E

5000|$|In {{conjunction}} with their investigation, the LAPD employed an expert who created a computer reenactment based on physical {{evidence of the}} shooting. According to the LAPD, the reenactment supported Officer Hopper's version of events. In October 2001, the LAPD internal review board ruled <b>that</b> <b>Officer</b> Hopper's actions were justifiable and he was [...] "in policy" [...] using deadly force. According to LAPD officials, the board also recommended <b>that</b> <b>Officer</b> Hopper seek additional training to [...] "improve his tactics".|$|R
5|$|On 11October Valckenier unsuccessfully {{requested}} <b>that</b> <b>officers</b> {{control their}} troops {{and stop the}} looting. Two days later the council established a reward of two ducats for every Chinese head surrendered to the soldiers as an incentive for the other ethnic groups {{to assist in the}} purge. As a result, ethnic Chinese who had survived the initial assault were hunted by gangs of irregulars, who killed those Chinese they found for the reward. The Dutch worked with natives in different parts of Batavia; ethnic Bugis and Balinese grenadiers were sent to reinforce the Dutch on 14October. On 22October Valckenier called for all killings to cease. In a lengthy letter in which he blamed the unrest entirely on the Chinese rebels, Valckenier offered an amnesty to all Chinese, except for the leaders of the unrest, on whose heads he placed a bounty of up to 500 rijksdaalders.|$|E

25|$|While the Infantry {{likes to}} claim that the Infantry OCS course {{developed}} by General Bradley is the precursor of the branch immaterial course taught at Fort Benning, the truth is more likely that the integration of the various Combat, Combat Support and Combat Service Support duties <b>that</b> <b>Officers</b> perform caused the various OCS training programs to be combined.|$|E
25|$|The motel's owner, Evelyn Carr, {{claimed that}} she had been on the {{telephone}} with Franklin {{at the time of the}} incident.

25|$|Officers {{from the}} {{passenger}} accommodation {{were able to}} reach the boat deck, but the impact caused extensive damage below decks, where collapsed overheads and wrecked ladders injured or trapped {{many of the men}} in one of the converted holds.

25|$|Immediately {{after the}} {{shooting}}, the Metropolitan Police {{stated that the}} shooting was 'directly linked' to {{the investigation of the}} attempted bombings the previous day. It was revealed that police policy toward suspected suicide bombers had been revised, and <b>that</b> <b>officers</b> had been ordered to fire directly toward suspects' heads, the theory according to British authorities being that shooting at the chest could conceivably detonate a concealed bomb.|$|E
25|$|A {{group of}} lawyers {{requested}} court injunctions against the Toronto Police Service from using newly purchased Long Range Acoustic Devices (LRAD), {{also known as}} sound cannons, during protests.

25|$|Later in August, {{following}} Philipponâ€™s guilty plea, the British Columbia Civil Liberties Association {{published a}} CBSA Operational Bulletin which {{indicated that the}} CBSA maintains it has the legal authority to compel passwords, {{but at the same}} time acknowledges that the law is unclear.

25|$|In October 2008, 91 {{pages of}} memos drafted in 2002 by {{officers}} at the Naval Consolidated Brig, Charleston were made public.

The memos also state that Padilla and a third prisoner, Ali Saleh Kahlah al-Marri, were held in similar conditions at the Brig.|$|E
25|$|Though {{the results}} of the {{intelligence}} tests were not available in time to be used to assess the candidates, they were assumed to be useful and an advisory committee even suggested <b>that</b> <b>officers</b> should only be chosen from those who scored highly on intelligence tests.
