40|$|Abstract Background Prior {{studies have}} {{demonstrated}} an increase in Clostridium difficile infection (CDI) incidence in the United States (U.

This study describes national CDI incidence by age group over a 10 -year period and mortality and hospital length of stay (LOS) among patients with CDI. Methods This was a retrospective analysis of the U. S. National Hospital Discharge Surveys from 2001 to 2010. Eligible patients with an ICD- 9 -CM discharge diagnosis code for CDI (008. 45) were stratified by age: < 18  years (pediatrics), 18 – 64 years (adults), and [*]≥ 65  years (elderly adults). Data weights were used to derive national estimates. CDI incidence was calculated as CDI discharges/ 1000 <b>total</b> <b>discharges.</b> Mortality and LOS were compared between age groups using chi-square or Wilcoxon rank sum tests. Results These data represent 2. 3 million hospital discharges for CDI over the study period. CDI incidence was highest among elderly adults (11. 6 CDI discharges/ 1000 <b>total</b> <b>discharges),</b> followed by adults (3. 5 CDI discharges/ 1000 <b>total</b> <b>discharges)</b> and pediatrics (1. 2 CDI discharges/ 1000 <b>total</b> <b>discharges).</b> The elderly also had higher rates of mortality (8. 8 %) compared to adults (3. 1 %) and pediatrics (1. 4 %) (p[*]<[*] 0. 0001).

40|$|Estimation of <b>total</b> <b>discharge</b> is {{necessary}} to understand the hydrological cycle and to manage water resources efficiently. However, the task is problematic {{in an area where}} ground observations are limited. The North Korea region is one example. Here, the <b>total</b> <b>discharge</b> was estimated based on the water balance using multiple satellite products. They are the terrestrial water storage changes (TWSC) derived from the Gravity Recovery and Climate Experiment (GRACE), precipitation from the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM), and evapotranspiration from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS). The satellite-based discharge was compared with land surface model products of the Global Land Data Assimilation System (GLDAS), and a positive relationship between the results was obtained (r = 0. 70 – 0. 86; bias = − 9. 08 – 16. 99 mm/month; RMSE = 36. 90 – 62. 56 mm/month; NSE = 0. 01 – 0. 62). Among the four land surface models of GLDAS (CLM, Mosaic, Noah, and VIC), CLM corresponded best with the satellite-based discharge, satellite-based discharge has a tendency to slightly overestimate compared to model-based discharge (CLM, Mosaic, Noah, and VIC) in the dry season. Also, the <b>total</b> <b>discharge</b> data based on the Precipitation-Runoff Modeling System (PRMS) and the in situ discharge for major five river basins in South Korea show comparable seasonality and high correlation with the satellite-based discharge.

Design: Retrospective study of consecutive ICH and cerebral infarction admissions to a rehabilitation hospital over a 4 -year period. Setting: Free-standing urban rehabilitation hospital. Participants: A total of 1064 cases met the inclusion criteria (545 women, 519 men; 871 with cerebral infarction, 193 with ICH). Interventions: Not applicable. Main Outcome Measures: Functional status was measured using the FIM™ instrument, recorded at admission and discharge. Recovery was quantified by the change in FIM total score (ΔFIM total score). Outcome measures were <b>total</b> <b>discharge</b> FIM score and ΔFIM total score. Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed. Results: Total admission FIM score was higher in patients with cerebral infarction than in patients with ICH (59 vs 51, P=. 0001). No difference in <b>total</b> <b>discharge</b> FIM score was present. Patients with ICH made a significantly greater recovery than those with cerebral infarction (ΔFIM total score, 28 vs 23. 3; P=. 002). On multivariate analysis, younger age, longer length of stay, and admission FIM cognitive subscore independently predicted <b>total</b> <b>discharge</b> FIM and ΔFIM total score. The severity of disability at admission, indicated by total admission FIM score, independently predicted <b>total</b> <b>discharge</b> FIM score, but not ΔFIM total score. The ICH patients with the most severely disabling strokes had significantly greater recovery than cerebral infarction patients with stroke of similar severity. Conclusions: The patients with ICH had greater functional impairment than the cerebral infarction patients at admission, but made greater gains. Patients with the most severely disabling ICH improved more than those with cerebral infarction of comparable severity.

This method has been validated by comparison with the observed streamflow, and shows an agreement with a root mean square error (RMSE) of 14. 30 mm/month for GRACE-based discharge and 20. 98 mm/month for that derived from precipitation minus evaporation (P − E).
