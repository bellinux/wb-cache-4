5|$|Hale–Bopp was a record-breaking comet—the {{farthest}} comet {{from the}} Sun discovered by amateurs, {{with the largest}} well-measured cometary nucleus known after 95P/Chiron, and it was {{visible to the naked}} eye for <b>twice</b> <b>as</b> <b>long</b> as the previous record-holder. It was also brighter than magnitude0 for eightweeks, longer than any other recorded comet.|$|E

The Park Grill group's proposal was <b>twice</b> <b>as</b> <b>long</b> as the other two but, technically, promised the Park District the lowest revenues. By {{the end of the}} year, O'Malley's team had been selected to run the restaurant, souvenir and concession stands, and a cafe in the new Millennium Park.|$|E
5|$|Spaying or neutering {{increases}} life expectancy: {{one study}} found neutered male cats live <b>twice</b> <b>as</b> <b>long</b> as intact males, while spayed female cats live 62% longer than intact females. Having a cat neutered confers health benefits, because castrated males cannot develop testicular cancer, spayed females cannot develop uterine or ovarian cancer, and both have a reduced risk of mammary cancer.|$|E
5000|$|Parapinnixa affinis {{is similar}} to other pea crabs of the genus Parapinnixa, {{especially}} P. nitida. It differs from P. nitida in the proportions of its carapace, {{which is more than}} <b>twice</b> <b>as</b> wide <b>as</b> <b>long</b> in P. nitida but less than <b>twice</b> <b>as</b> wide <b>as</b> <b>long</b> in P. affinis. The carapace is approximately 4.5 x 2.5 mm wide, with a maximum of 6.0 x 3.6 mm. The carapace is usually [...] "light amber mottled with dark ochre", but 5% of crabs are albino.|$|R

5|$|The series {{moved back}} to once-weekly Saturday broadcasts. All episodes were 45 minutes long, though they also exist in 25-minute versions. Although there were now only 13 episodes in the season, the total running time {{remained}} approximately {{the same as in}} previous seasons since the episodes were almost <b>twice</b> <b>as</b> <b>long.</b>|$|E
5|$|Arizona won {{the game}} 49–48 after scoring two touchdowns {{in the final two}} minutes to come back for the victory. As expected, the game was {{dominated}} by offense; Arizona and Nevada combined for 1234 total yards and 70 first downs. Despite losing the game, Nevada possessed the ball nearly <b>twice</b> <b>as</b> <b>long</b> and gained twice as many rushing yards as Arizona. Arizona quarterback Matt Scott was named the game's offensive most valuable player (MVP), and teammate Marquis Flowers, a linebacker, was named the game's defensive MVP.|$|E
5|$|Bradman's Test {{batting average}} of 99.94 {{has become one}} of cricket's most famous, iconic statistics. No other player who has played more than 20Test match innings has {{finished}} with a Test average of more than 61. Bradman scored centuries at a rate better than one every three innings—in 80Test innings, Bradman scored 29centuries. Only 11 players have since surpassed his total, all at a much slower rate: the next fastest player to reach 29 centuries, Sachin Tendulkar, required nearly <b>twice</b> <b>as</b> <b>long</b> (148innings) to do so.|$|E

5|$|Hale–Bopp was {{discovered}} on July 23, 1995 separately by Alan Hale and Thomas Bopp prior to it becoming naked-eye visible on Earth. Although predicting the maximum apparent brightness of new comets with {{any degree of}} certainty is difficult, Hale–Bopp met or exceeded most predictions when it passed perihelion on April 1, 1997. It was {{visible to the naked eye}} for a record 18months, <b>twice</b> <b>as</b> <b>long</b> as the previous record holder, the Great Comet of 1811. Accordingly, Hale–Bopp was dubbed the Great Comet of 1997.|$|E
5|$|In PC Magazine testing, Norton {{completely}} detected {{most of the}} malware samples. For {{two-thirds of}} the samples, all traces were removed. Norton found and removed all the commercial keyloggers. A full scan took nearly an hour to complete though, <b>twice</b> <b>as</b> <b>long</b> as the 2007 version. The suite blocked most of the malware from installing and all the commercial keyloggers, regardless of any modifications made to the samples. PC World noted that Norton removed 80 percent of malware-associated files and Registry entries.|$|E
5|$|While {{the cast}} {{departed}} {{to work on}} other projects, the post-production team was tasked with finalizing the film {{in time for a}} Christmas release; the resulting work would take <b>twice</b> <b>as</b> <b>long</b> as the filming process had taken. Editor Todd Ramsay and assistants spent principal photography syncing film and audio tracks. The resulting rough cuts were used to formulate plans for sound effects, music, and optical effects that would be added later.|$|E

The anal scale is single. Subcaudals: 17-24.|$|R
50|$|The longtail {{butterfly}} ray (Gymnura poecilura) is {{a species of}} {{butterfly ray}}, family Gymnuridae, native to the Indo-Pacific from the Red Sea to southern Japan and western Indonesia. Growing up to 92 cm across, this ray has a lozenge-shaped pectoral fin disc about <b>twice</b> <b>as</b> wide <b>as</b> <b>long,</b> colored brown to gray above with many small, light spots. The spiracles behind its eyes have smooth rims. This species can be identified by its tail, which is about <b>as</b> <b>long</b> <b>as</b> the snout-to-vent distance, lacks fins, and bears nine to twelve each of alternating black and white bands.|$|R
5|$|Although {{built in}} {{response}} to Gloire, the Warriors had a very different operational concept from the French ship, which was meant to replace wooden ships of the line. The Warriors were designed by Watts as 40-gun armoured frigates and were not intended {{to stand in the}} line of battle, as the Admiralty was uncertain about their ability to withstand concentrated fire from wooden two- and three-deck ships of the line. Unlike Gloire, they were planned to be fast enough to force battle on a fleeing enemy and to control the range at which a battle was fought to their own advantage. In contrast to Gloires square profile, Warrior has a clipper bow, but she is <b>twice</b> <b>as</b> <b>long</b> as a typical clipper ship.|$|E
5|$|Bulky and soft-bodied, {{the false}} {{catshark}} has a broad {{head with a}} short, rounded snout. The nostrils have large flaps of skin on their anterior rims. The narrow eyes are over <b>twice</b> <b>as</b> <b>long</b> as high, and are equipped with rudimentary nictitating membranes; behind the eyes are large spiracles. The huge mouth is arched and bears short furrows at the corners. There are over two hundred rows of tiny teeth in each jaw, arranged in straight lines in the upper jaw and diagonal lines in the lower jaw; each tooth has a pointed central cusp flanked by one or two smaller cusplets on either side. The five pairs of gill slits are fairly small.|$|E
5|$|The axial tilt of Mars is 25.19 degrees {{relative}} to its orbital plane, {{which is similar}} to the axial tilt of Earth. As a result, Mars has seasons like Earth, though on Mars, they are nearly <b>twice</b> <b>as</b> <b>long</b> because its orbital period is that much longer. In the present day epoch, the orientation of the north pole of Mars is close to the star Deneb. Mars passed an aphelion in March 2010 and its perihelion in March 2011. The next aphelion came in February 2012 and the next perihelion came in January 2013.|$|E

40|$|Rionegrochelys caldieroi de la Fuente, Maniel, and Jannello gen. et sp. nov. is a Late Cretaceous turtle from Rio Negro Province, Argentina. The holotype and the {{referred}} {{specimens of}} this new species show an unusual shell morphology and microanatomy. The proportion between the carapace and plastron and the peculiar morphology of the shell such as the heart shaped carapace, a very deep nuchal notch, peripheral bones 2 – 11 with strongly gutter, the first vertebral scute <b>twice</b> <b>as</b> wide <b>as</b> <b>long</b> and subrectangular in shape, the posterior margin of vertebral scute 5 is three lobe shaped, and the unexpected osteohistology characterized by a massive structure, with higher compactness (80. 6 %) than other chelids, suggests beyond doubt that this turtle may be considered a new taxon. A semi-aquatic habitat with tendency towards terrestrial environments is inferred for Rionegrochelys caldieroi {{similar to that of}} the extant pelomedusid Pelomedusa subrufa among the extant pleurodires. Rionegrochelys caldieroi is recovered as a stem chelid. This new species seems to be closely related to Bonapartemys bajobarrealis and the clade formed by Lomalatachelys neuquina plus Mendozachelys wichmanni...|$|R
50|$|The {{rules for}} {{wheelchair}} tennis {{are similar to}} able-bodied tennis except that the ball is allowed to bounce <b>twice</b> so <b>long</b> <b>as</b> the first bounce falls within the court.

5|$|The bipedal-quadrupedal {{consensus}} was changed by a {{detailed study of}} the forelimbs of Plateosaurus by Bonnan and Senter (2007), which clearly showed that Plateosaurus was incapable of pronating its hands. The pronated position in some museum mounts had been achieved by exchanging the position of radius and ulna in the elbow. The lack of forelimb pronation meant that Plateosaurus was an obligate (i.e. unable to walk in any other way) biped. Further indicators for a purely bipedal mode of locomotion are the great difference in limb length (the hind limb is roughly <b>twice</b> <b>as</b> <b>long</b> as the forelimb), the very limited motion range of the forelimb, {{and the fact that}} the centre of mass rests squarely over the hind limbs.|$|E
5|$|The {{facilities}} of {{the theatre}} naturally lent {{themselves to the}} new genre of musical theatre. Chu Chin Chow opened in 1916 and ran for an astonishing world record 2,235 performances (almost <b>twice</b> <b>as</b> <b>long</b> as the previous record for musical theatre – a record that it held until surpassed by Salad Days in 1955). Major productions of plays with large casts were also performed at His Majesty's. George and Ira Gershwin's Oh, Kay! had its London premiere on 21 September 1927. This starred Gertrude Lawrence and John Kirby, and ran for 213 performances. Noël Coward's operetta Bitter Sweet enjoyed a run of 697 performances beginning 18 July 1929. J. B. Priestley's theatrical adaptation of his own The Good Companions premiered on 14 May 1931.|$|E
5|$|Yet another {{trait that}} sets most lemurs apart from anthropoid {{primates}} is their long lifespan {{together with their}} high infant mortality. Many lemurs, including the ring-tailed lemur, have adapted to a highly seasonal environment, which has affected their birthrate, maturation, and twinning rate (r-selection). This helps them to recover rapidly from a population crash. In captivity, lemurs can live <b>twice</b> <b>as</b> <b>long</b> {{as they do in}} the wild, benefiting from consistent nutrition that meets their dietary requirements, medical advancements, and improved understanding of their housing requirements. In 1960, it was thought that lemurs could live between 23 and 25 years. We now know that the larger species can live for more than 30 years without showing signs of aging (senescence) and still be capable of reproduction.|$|E

40|$|In June 1993 the Namibian {{government}} announced the expiration of existing fishing {{rights and the}} application of a new fishing rights system starting in January 1994. Rights are now granted for seven, 10, 15 and 20 years on the basis of investment, Namibian participation and other requirements. Data are gathered by surveys on income and expenditure to fulfil the policy conditions. In this study, part of the data are used to test if there are any statistical relationships between various factors such as levels of investment, interest rates, fishing income and quota, and the length of fishing rights. A log-linear model is derived to analyse elements that influence investment. In addition, the relationship between social contribution and length of fishing rights is explored. The results indicate that the interest rate is insignificant, while quota and fishing income influence investment. In particular, short term right holders invest almost <b>twice</b> <b>as</b> much <b>as</b> <b>long</b> term right holders. The model indicated positive net (but declining gross) investment for long term right holders. Long term rights holders also contribute more in terms of social activities than short term rights holders. Incentive...|$|R
5|$|For {{work on the}} scenario, Jun Maeda contributed {{along with}} {{composing}} some of the game's music. Further writers include Leo Kashida who had worked on , and two new scenario writers to Key—Yūto Tonokawa, and Chika Shirokiri. Maeda wrote the scenarios for Rin and the entire male cast; Kashida wrote the scenario for Mio; Tonokawa wrote the scenarios for Komari and Yuiko; finally, Shirokiri wrote the scenarios for Haruka and Kudryavka. In an interview of Maeda and Tonokawa in the August 2007 issue of Push!!, {{it was reported that}} the story of Little Busters! is <b>twice</b> <b>as</b> <b>long</b> as Air's, but only half as long as Clannad's. However, this {{does not take into account}} the minigames in Little Busters! which serve to lengthen the game. The music in the game, not counting Maeda's, was composed by Key's signature composers Shinji Orito and Magome Togoshi, in addition to Manack and members of PMMK. Togoshi left Key in October 2006 before the visual novel went on sale.|$|E
5|$|In 1968, Hendrix and Jeffery jointly {{invested}} in {{the purchase of the}} Generation Club in Greenwich Village. They had initially planned to reopen the establishment, but after an audit revealed that Hendrix had incurred exorbitant fees by block-booking lengthy sessions at peak rates they decided that the building would better serve them as a recording studio. With a facility of his own, Hendrix could work as much as he wanted while also reducing his recording expenditures, which had reached a reported $300,000 annually. Architect and acoustician John Storyk designed Electric Lady Studios for Hendrix, who requested that they avoid right angles where possible. With round windows, an ambient lighting machine, and a psychedelic mural, Storyk wanted the studio to have a relaxing environment that would encourage Hendrix's creativity. The project took <b>twice</b> <b>as</b> <b>long</b> as planned and cost twice as much as Hendrix and Jeffery had budgeted, with their total investment estimated at $1 million.|$|E
5|$|In 1987, {{the media}} speculated that Clinton {{would enter the}} Presidential race after {{incumbent}} New York Governor Mario Cuomo declined to run and Democratic front-runner Gary Hart withdrew owing to revelations of marital infidelity. Clinton decided to remain as Arkansas governor (following consideration for the potential candidacy of Hillary Rodham Clinton for governor, initially favored—but ultimately vetoed—by the First Lady). For the nomination, Clinton endorsed Massachusetts Governor Michael Dukakis. He gave the nationally televised opening night address at the 1988 Democratic National Convention, but his speech, which was 33 minutes long and <b>twice</b> <b>as</b> <b>long</b> as it was expected to be, was criticized for being too long and poorly delivered.
