The storm surge destroyed a government dock and caused flooding and beach erosion near the coast.

40|$|<b>Tree</b> <b>and</b> shrub {{integration}} {{has been}} promoted {{as a means of}} enhancing rural livelihoods through sustaining watershed provision of services and products, especially in Ethiopia. However, research to support this effort has been limited. This study was conducted in Borodo watershed in central Ethiopia, to identify constraints to the process of <b>tree</b> <b>and</b> shrub integration in the watersheds. A household survey was conducted, supplemented with focus group discussions (FGDs), key informant interview and field observations. A total of 31 <b>tree</b> <b>and</b> 11 shrub species were identified in different niches in the watershed. The key constraints to <b>tree</b> <b>and</b> shrub species integration included shortage of arable land, soil cracking, free grazing, lack of seedlings of desired species and water-logging. The main catalysts to the integration were availability of information on improved integration and cash for investment in the required activities, easy land certification and market opportunity for <b>tree</b> <b>and</b> shrub products. The <b>tree</b> <b>and</b> shrub growing niches preferred by farmers were homesteads (95. 5 %), gully sides (67. 4 %), stream sides (61. 8 %) road sides (60. 7 %), and crop land (12. 4 %). It is essential to address the factors that hinder <b>tree</b> <b>and</b> shrub species integration at various growing niche so as to improve the availability of <b>tree</b> products <b>and</b> services. Moreover, the capacity of farmers should be upgraded through training and demonstration of best <b>tree</b> planting, management <b>and</b> utilisation practices...|$|R

40|$|Urban <b>tree</b> <b>and</b> woody yard {{residues}} are {{an important}} component of the municipal solid waste (MSW) stream in the United States. In 2000, approximately 14. 5 million tons of urban <b>tree</b> <b>and</b> woody yard residues was generated, nearly 7 % of total MSW. Some woody residues are being recovered for recycling, composting, or other uses, but a large proportion is simply discarded. In total, urban <b>tree</b> <b>and</b> woody yard residues form a resource about as large or larger than the current timber harvest from National Forests. Materials from each of these two sources have distinctly different properties and, in general, are not interchangeable. Urban <b>tree</b> <b>and</b> woody yard residues are typically suited for low value products such as mulch, while National Forest timber is suited for high value solid wood and pulp products. In 2000, just over 12 million tons of timber was harvested from National Forests, compared to 14. 5 million tons of urban <b>tree</b> <b>and</b> woody yard residues generated...|$|R
