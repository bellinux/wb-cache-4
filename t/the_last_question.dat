500|$|The {{second round}} plays {{almost exactly the}} same as the first round; however, the {{questions}} were asked to men who belong to a specific group (e.g., married men, African-American men, or men under the age of 25). Each correct prediction is worth $300. <b>The</b> <b>last</b> <b>question</b> of Round 2 is designated as the [...] "VIP" [...] question, which is focused on one specific group of men and asked to a special guest related to the question. When the VIP question is about a specific man, before the question is asked, the panel is allowed 30 seconds to [...] "interrogate" [...] the VIP about their background, personal preferences, etc., and then the question is played out as normal, with the VIP giving his answer verbally after the contestants give their prediction. Actor Ted Lange (most well known for his role on The Love Boat) appeared in some episodes as the show's bartender and was often the man who was previously asked the VIP question.|$|E
2500|$|On 30 May 2007, Spicks and Specks {{celebrated its}} 100th episode. Instead {{of the show}} being divided into rounds, teams were asked 100 {{questions}} – one {{from each of the}} previous 99 episodes, and one new question, [...] "What is <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>question</b> on our 100th episode?" [...] which was correctly answered: [...] "What is <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>question</b> on our 100th episode." [...] by Antoinette Halloran. Alan Brough's team was victorious although it did come down to the very last question.|$|E
2500|$|In an {{interview}} with CBS News first broadcast on September 7, 2006, Armitage admitted that he was Novak's [...] "initial" [...] and [...] "primary source" [...] (Novak's words). In the interview, he described his conversation with Novak: [...] "At {{the end of a}} wide-ranging interview he asked me, [...] "Why did the CIA send Ambassador (Wilson) to Africa?" [...] I said I didn't know, but that she worked out at the agency, adding it was [...] "just an offhand question.... I didn't put any big import on it and I just answered and it was <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>question</b> we had." [...] After acknowledging that he was indeed Robert Novak's initial and primary source for the column outing Plame, Richard Armitage referred to what has been termed [...] "a classified State Department memorandum" [...] which purportedly refers to Valerie Wilson.|$|E

2500|$|James later {{gained a}} place at Pembroke College, Cambridge, to read English literature. While there, he contributed to all the {{undergraduate}} periodicals, was a member and later President of the Cambridge Footlights, and appeared on University Challenge as captain of the Pembroke team, beating St Hilda's, Oxford but losing to Balliol on <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>question</b> in a tied game. During one summer vacation, {{he worked as a}} circus roustabout to save enough money to travel to Italy. His contemporaries at Cambridge included Germaine Greer (known as [...] "Romaine Rand" [...] in the first three volumes of his memoirs), Simon Schama and Eric Idle. Having, he claims, scrupulously avoided reading any of the course material (but having read widely otherwise in English and foreign literature), James graduated with a —better than he had expected—and began a Ph.D. thesis on Percy Bysshe Shelley.|$|E
2500|$|The [...] "false-photograph" [...] task {{is another}} task {{that serves as}} a measure of theory of mind development. In this task, {{children}} must reason about what is represented in a photograph that differs from the current state of affairs. [...] Within the false-photograph task, either a location or identity change exists. In the location-change task, the examiner puts an object in one location (e.g., chocolate in an open green cupboard), whereupon the child takes a Polaroid photograph of the scene. [...] While the photograph is developing, the examiner moves the object to a different location (e.g., a blue cupboard), allowing the child to view the examiner's action. [...] The examiner asks the child two control questions: [...] "When we first took the picture, where was the object?" [...] and [...] "Where is the object now?". [...] The subject is also asked a [...] "false-photograph" [...] question: [...] "Where is the object in the picture?" [...] The child passes the task if he/she correctly identifies the location of the object in the picture and the actual location of the object {{at the time of the}} question. However, <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>question</b> might be misinterpreted as: [...] "Where in this room is the object that the picture depicts?" [...] and therefore some examiners use an alternative phrasing.|$|E
2500|$|The defense's chief {{expert witness}} was Fredric Wertham, a {{psychiatrist}} {{with an emphasis}} on child development who conducted psychiatric examinations for the New York criminal courts. During two days of testimony, Wertham explained Fish's obsession with religion and specifically his preoccupation with the biblical story of Abraham and Isaac (Genesis 22:1–24). Wertham said that Fish believed that similarly [...] "sacrificing" [...] a boy would be penance for his own sins and that even if the act itself was wrong, angels would prevent it if God did not approve. Fish attempted the sacrifice once before but was thwarted when a car drove past. Edward Budd was the next intended victim, but {{he turned out to be}} larger than expected so he settled on Grace. Although he knew Grace was female, it is believed that Fish perceived her as a boy. Wertham then detailed Fish's cannibalism, which in his mind he associated with communion. <b>The</b> <b>last</b> <b>question</b> Dempsey asked Wertham was 15,000 words long, detailed Fish's life and ended with asking how the doctor considered his mental condition based on this life. Wertham simply answered [...] "He is insane". Gallagher cross-examined Wertham on whether Fish knew the difference between right and wrong. He responded that he did know but that it was a perverted knowledge based on his opinions of sin, atonement and religion and thus was an [...] "insane knowledge". The defense called two more psychiatrists to support Wertham's findings.|$|E

2500|$|One India gave a {{positive}} review saying [...] "The music of Raaz – TMC indeed impresses, the soundtrack here {{is yet another}} good addition to the enviable music catalogue of the Bhatts and Emraan would certainly have some more chartbusters to add to his name. As for <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>question</b> i.e. whether Raaz – TMC matches up to Nadeem-Shravan's Raaz, then well, let's {{put it this way}} that albums like Aashiqui, Raaz or a Saajan are made only once and there shouldn't even be a conscious effort to replicate or surpass them. In this regard, the music of Raaz – TMC has its own place under the sun and what matters in the end is whether it works for the film or not. Well, the answer for this one is a firm Yes! Thaindian News also reviewed the music for the film. They said [...] "“Soniyo" [...] is the best number of the album. Sung by Sonu Nigam and Shreya Ghoshal, the pleasant track moves at a very steady pace. Kumar keeps the lyrics as simple as the composition and it gives the singers ample space. Consisting mainly of melodic, slow paced tracks, the frontrunners of this album are two fast numbers. Both [...] "O Jaana" [...] and [...] "Soniyo" [...] are the highlights of the pack. But at the above the song Maahi became a blockbuster hit after its release. According to the Indian trade website Box Office India, with around 13,00,000 units sold, this film's soundtrack album was the year's twelfth highest-selling.|$|E
2500|$|In January 2006, Llewelyn-Bowen and {{his wife}} Jackie were offered {{a place on the}} Valentine's Day celebrity couples edition of Who Wants to Be a Millionaire? They {{appeared}} on the show managing to reach the £1 million question, before answering it incorrectly and dropping down to £32,000 (a loss of £468,000). For the first time ever, Celador allowed Llewelyn-Bowen {{and his wife}} retry the show after the company claimed that <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>question</b> [...] "didn't meet their standards". After returning and being shown a different £1 million question, the couple decided not to risk losing £468,000 for the second time and won £500,000 for their chosen charity, The Shooting Star Children's Hospice, of which Llewelyn-Bowen and his wife are both patrons. Their new question was about the first man to travel to space twice, and the correct answer to the question was Gus Grissom. They decided not to risk it this time and walked away with the £500,000. This amount is the highest amount that any celebrity couple has won on any British edition of Who Wants To Be a Millionaire? The £468,000 they originally lost was also the greatest loss ever seen on the show, and no other contestant has ever answered the final question incorrectly in the United Kingdom version. The allegedly misleading question was [...] "Translated from the Latin, what is the United States motto?" [...] The answer given was [...] "In God We Trust" [...] which is originally English and has in fact been the motto of the United States since 1956. The intended answer had been [...] "One Out of Many" [...] which is a translation of the Latin phrase E pluribus unum, which is not actually the current United States motto. E pluribus unum had been the de facto motto but was never legally declared as such.|$|E
