25|$|Blackpool {{finished}} the 1949–50 season in seventh place. A quarter-final defeat at Liverpool ended the club's FA Cup interest for another season. Blackpool's reserve team, however, won the Central League championship, scoring 82 {{goals in the}} process. They were assisted significantly by Jackie Mudie, who was just beginning <b>to</b> <b>knock</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> door of the first team. Other new members included the amateur Bill Slater and Bill Perry. Out went goalkeeper Joe Robinson, who was unable to win back the number-one jersey from Farm, as well as Alex Munro, who retired, and Ron Suart, who joined Blackburn.|$|E
500|$|Patrick Murphy, {{chief of}} police for the Berwyn Heights Police Department, was {{especially}} critical of the county police. [...] Murphy argued that the raid {{could have been prevented}} if his department had handled the situation, stating [...] "you can't tell me the {{chief of police}} of a municipality wouldn't have been able <b>to</b> <b>knock</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> door of the mayor of that municipality, gain his confidence and enter the residence". [...] Furthermore, according to Mayor Calvo, a memorandum of understanding between the county and the city requires county police to inform the city if an operation is being conducted within their jurisdiction.|$|E
500|$|Lavigne {{was born}} in Belleville, Ontario, Canada. Her mother is of English, Scottish, and German descent, and her father, Jean-Claude Joseph Lavigne, is of French-Canadian origin. She was named [...] "Avril" [...] by her father after the French word {{for the month of}} April. He and Lavigne's mother, Judy, {{recognized}} their child's vocal abilities when she was two years old and sang [...] "Jesus Loves Me" [...] {{on the way home from}} church. Lavigne has an older brother, Matthew, and a younger sister, Michelle, both of whom teased her when she sang. [...] "My brother used <b>to</b> <b>knock</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> wall because I used to sing myself to sleep and he thought it was really annoying." ...|$|E

500|$|Bannon set {{her stories}} in and among gay bars in the 1950s and 1960s that were secret. As {{described}} in Beebo Brinker, one had <b>to</b> <b>knock</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> door and be recognized before being let in. In reality, {{women were not}} allowed to wear pants in some bars in New York City. Police raided bars and arrested everyone within regularly; a raid on a gay bar prompted the seminal Stonewall riots in 1969 that started the gay rights movement. Because of the atmosphere of secrecy and shame, little was recorded at the time {{about what it was like}} to be gay then, and Bannon unwittingly recorded history from her own visits to Greenwich Village. In 2007, one of the writers who adapted three of the books into a play said of Bannon's work, [...] "I think she rises above the pulp. She wasn't trying to write trash. There wasn't any place for a woman to be writing this kind of material... But I just think the writing's transcended its time and its era and its market." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{following}} day, the Prince and {{his family}} uphold a centuries-old family tradition and visit a convent founded by a female ancestor. After returning from the convent, the Prince looks out his window at Donnafugata's town square and spies Tancredi, dressed in his, [...] "seduction color," [...] of Prussian blue. He is carrying a box of peaches from the palace's fruit grove and is seen <b>to</b> <b>knock</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> door of the Sedàras household.|$|E
2500|$|But on 1 November 1886, in a laconic communication, Verdi {{was able}} to proclaim: [...] "DEAR BOITO, It is finished! All honour to us! [...] (and to Him!!). Farewell. G. VERDI".(sic) This left only a few minor tweaks to be done, with Boito {{providing}} two more lines in December and Verdi writing {{to him on the}} 18th saying [...] "I have just consigned to [...] the last acts of Otello! Poor Othello!...He won't come back here any more!!!" [...] The librettist replied: [...] "The Moor will come back no more <b>to</b> <b>knock</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> door of the Palazzo Doria , but you will go to meet the Moor at La Scala. Otello exists. The great dream has become reality".|$|E
5000|$|.....the officer's {{announcement}} {{of his presence}} was at least equivalent <b>to</b> a <b>knock</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> screen door. Indeed, {{it was probably the}} only option that had even a chance of rising above the din. Under these circumstances, there was no violation of the Fourth Amendment’s knock-and-announce rule.|$|R

2500|$|After {{returning}} from his last European trip, Hopper rented {{a studio in}} New York City, where he struggled to define his own style. Reluctantly, he returned to illustration to support himself. Being a freelancer, Hopper was forced to solicit for projects, and had <b>to</b> <b>knock</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> doors of magazine and agency offices to find business. His painting languished: [...] "it's {{hard for me to}} decide what I want to paint. I go for months without finding it sometimes. It comes slowly." [...] His fellow illustrator, Walter Tittle, described Hopper's depressed emotional state in sharper terms, seeing his friend [...] "suffering...from long periods of unconquerable inertia, sitting {{for days at a time}} before his easel in helpless unhappiness, unable to raise a hand to break the spell." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "How am I ever to {{get along}} in this world unless I watch out?" [...] {{he said to himself}} dismally. [...] "I suppose it will do no good <b>to</b> <b>knock</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> door. By the way the place is located, the sleeping-room must be upstairs in the rear, and I might pound till doomsday without any one hearing me." ...|$|E
60|$|Stephen {{satisfied}} {{him that}} there was no danger on that score, and heard him muttering, that it was no harm to secure a safe harbour in case a man hadn't <b>the</b> luck <b>to</b> be <b>knocked</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> head ere he grew too old to trail a pike. And he would fain see the old man.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{trust in}} Saint Lambert {{that he will}} marry her," [...] said Crevecoeur, [...] "as indeed, he is likely enough to do, {{for the sake of}} her moneybags, and equally likely <b>to</b> <b>knock</b> her <b>on</b> <b>the</b> head, so soon as these are either secured in his own grasp, or, at farthest, emptied." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Motomoe sprang forward involuntarily, and the sneer was chased {{from his}} face by an {{expression}} of solicitude. Then the beauty of <b>the</b> situation dawned <b>on</b> him, and he chuckled and grinned. No, I didn't expect anything of him. Hadn't he tried <b>to</b> <b>knock</b> me <b>on</b> <b>the</b> head? What could he do anyway? He didn't know anything about engines.|$|R
60|$|Carl, still motionless, was {{the more}} agonized {{because there was no}} sound from Gertie, not even a sobbing call. Anything might have {{happened}} to her. While he was coaxing himself <b>to</b> <b>knock</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> pane, Stillman puttered about the shack, petting the dog, filling his pipe. He passed out of Carl's range of vision toward the side of the room in which was the window.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Don't rub it in,' pleaded Beverley. 'It isn't fair. There's nobody so {{sensitive}} as a reformed floor-knocker. You {{will come up}} or let me come down, won't you? Whenever I have that sad, depressed feeling, I go out and kill a policeman. But you wouldn't care for that. So the only {{thing for you to}} do is <b>to</b> <b>knock</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> ceiling. Then I'll come charging down and see if there's anything I can do to help.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "As I {{went to the}} door, {{the thing}} passed before me, rapping on the walls. When I was got to the door it knocked outside; when I opened the door, it began <b>to</b> <b>knock</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> turret. The moon was shining; I went on {{to see what would}} happen, but it beat on the other sides of the tower, and, as it always evaded me, I went up to see how my patient was. He was alive, but very weak.|$|E

5000|$|The refrain {{describes}} {{the reaction of}} the neighbours to the news of the couple's good fortune. [...] "Wot cher!" [...] was a Cockney greeting [...] - [...] a contraction of [...] "What cheer" [...] used as a greeting since the Middle Ages. To [...] "knock em" [...] is an idiomatic phrase, <b>to</b> <b>knock</b> them <b>on</b> <b>the</b> head i.e. to stun them.|$|R
60|$|I did long, achingly, {{then and}} for four and twenty hours afterwards, for {{something}} to fetch {{me out of my}} present existence, and lead me upwards and onwards. This longing, and all of a similar kind, it was necessary <b>to</b> <b>knock</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> head; which I did, figuratively, after the manner of Jael to Sisera, driving a nail through their temples. Unlike Sisera, they did not die: they were but transiently stunned, and at intervals would turn on the nail with a rebellious wrench: then did the temples bleed, and the brain thrill to its core.|$|E

Suddenly, a strange man, (Michael Ironside), a vampire, attacks them, biting Kerrys neck while Justin is forced to flee.|$|R
6000|$|... "No doubt, no doubt," [...] said he, sadly, not {{daring to}} argue such a point with her, and yet feeling but little {{consolation}} from her assurance. [...] "So is the bullock in God's hands when the butcher is going <b>to</b> <b>knock</b> him <b>on</b> <b>the</b> head, but yet {{we know that}} the beast will die. Men live and die from natural causes, and not by God's interposition." ...|$|R
