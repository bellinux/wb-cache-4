5|$|Survival horror {{games are}} a subgenre of horror games, where the player {{is unable to}} fully prepare or arm their avatar. The player usually {{encounters}} several factors to make combat unattractive as a primary option, such as {{a limited number of}} weapons or invulnerable enemies, if weapons are available, their ammunition is sparser than in other games, and powerful weapons such as rocket launchers are rare, if even available at all. Thus, players are more vulnerable than in action games, and the hostility of the environment sets up a narrative where <b>the</b> <b>odds</b> <b>are</b> weighed decisively against the avatar. This gameplay shifts away from direct combat, and players must learn to evade enemies or turn the environment against them. Games try to enhance the experience of vulnerability by making the game single player rather than multiplayer, and by giving the player an avatar who is more frail than the typical action game hero.|$|E
25|$|There is {{generally}} legislation requiring {{that the odds}} in gaming devices are statistically random, to prevent manufacturers from making some high-payoff results impossible.

25|$|The {{number of}} {{variants}} {{contributing to a}} disease and the interactions among those variants also could influence the distribution of diseases among groups. The difficulty that has been encountered in finding contributory alleles for complex diseases and in replicating positive associations suggests that many complex diseases involve numerous variants rather than a moderate number of alleles, {{and the influence of}} any given variant may depend in critical ways on the genetic and environmental background. If many alleles are required to increase susceptibility to a disease, <b>the</b> <b>odds</b> <b>are</b> low that the necessary combination of alleles would become concentrated in a particular group purely through drift.|$|E
25|$|And also, {{thus it is}} {{that the}} fictitious troubadour Manrico can gain his rags-to-riches background, having risen from the obscurity of a Biscayan gypsy camp to become Urgel's chief general, a knight and a master swordsman in his own right, good enough to defeat Di Luna himself in a {{personal}} duel, or win a knightly tournament: only to lose it again on the military battlefield, where <b>the</b> <b>odds</b> <b>are</b> perpetually against him, and he is damned as an outlaw even before the opera begins, for no deed of his own but because his master is the rebel. And yet he gets to be a heroic, popular outlaw, who might just escape with his life in return for a vow of future loyalty, if put on trial in front of the Prince himself: a chance that Luna does not want to risk, given that his rivalry with Manrico is personal as well as political. Hence the challenge to the duel over the personal rivalry, instead of calling the guards and making the arrest political, in Act 1: and hence also the decision to execute without trial in Act 4 even though Luna knows he is abusing his position. Leonora and Azucena are, of course, as fictitious as Manrico, as is the story's conceit that the former Count of Luna had not one but two sons.|$|E

[...] In 2008, the Wrecking Crew were featured in the documentary film The Wrecking Crew, directed by Tommy Tedesco's son, Denny Tedesco. In 2014, its musicians were depicted in the Brian Wilson biopic Love & Mercy. [...] Two of their members, drummers Hal Blaine and Earl Palmer, were among the inaugural [...] "sidemen" [...] inductees to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2000, and the entire Wrecking Crew was inducted into the Musicians Hall of Fame in 2007.

500|$|The {{dismissal}} raises tension at the Simpson household, with Homer and Marge {{siding with}} Lisa and Bart, respectively. Homer believes that Lisa {{needs to do}} what is good to the team, while Marge thinks she should reconsider, since the family comes first. Under Lisa's leadership, the team advances to the championship against Capital City. On the day of the game, Marge takes Bart to an amusement park; while they ride the roller coaster, Lisa calls Bart to beg for his help, but he brushes her off. Mike Scioscia, manager of the Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim, pops up in the seats behind Marge and Bart and tells him that the best players listen to their managers, pointing out his three World Series wins [...] two as player, one as manager. Marge takes Bart to the game, which is now in its last inning with the Isotots down 11-10. Bart puts aside his differences with Lisa and offers to pinch-run from first base, then ignores her signs and steals both second and third. As he begins to steal home, Lisa realizes <b>the</b> <b>odds</b> <b>are</b> vastly against him, then decides to ignore the numbers and cheer him on anyway. He is tagged out at the plate, costing the Isotots their championship bid, but Lisa thanks him for helping her learn to love baseball as a game, and the team cheers them for resolving their differences.|$|E
