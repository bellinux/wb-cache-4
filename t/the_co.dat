5|$|As {{damage is}} dealt by units within <b>the</b> <b>CO</b> zone, the CO's power meter fills slightly, {{at a rate}} of one bar per five hit points worth of damage inflicted. As <b>the</b> <b>CO</b> power meter is filled, <b>the</b> <b>CO</b> zone grows larger. When the meter is full, <b>the</b> <b>CO</b> can {{activate}} his power which has an effect on the whole battlefield, such as repairing allied units, damaging enemy units, or temporarily altering weather conditions. In addition, the offensive and defensive boosts that normally apply only in <b>the</b> <b>CO</b> zone, also applies to all allied units on the whole battlefield for the turn that <b>the</b> <b>CO</b> power is active. If <b>the</b> <b>CO</b> unit is destroyed, <b>the</b> <b>CO</b> meter empties and <b>the</b> <b>CO</b> returns to the HQ, able to be redeployed with another unit.|$|E

They arrived at the village at 11:00 having only been confronted by sniper fire. The Germans assembling on the heights overlooking the village attacked at 15:00. Fighting at close quarters and house to house, by 16:00 the battalion was forced to withdraw back to Herourvillette. The battle cost them 87 casualties, including <b>the</b> <b>CO.</b>|$|E

5|$|In the meantime, Miller {{earned the}} further ire of his CO by flying {{unauthorised}} leisure flights. Not wanting to fly tour flights over Germany, Miller lodged bogus reports {{saying that the}} Mosquitoes were malfunctioning, causing unnecessary maintenance work. Thus, <b>the</b> <b>CO</b> ordered Miller to take his plane instead, which caught fire. With one functional engine, Miller {{came back to the}} air base and bellylanded. The plane broke apart and caught fire, but Miller escaped physical injury and was playing sport an hour later.|$|E
5|$|After Dieppe the {{headquarters}} staff changed again. Lovat {{was promoted to}} brigadier and given command of the 1st Special Service Brigade. Mills-Roberts was promoted and sent to North Africa to take over command of No. 6 Commando. They were replaced by Robert Dawson as <b>the</b> <b>CO</b> and Ronald Menday as 2IC. Other changes included moving to a new base in Falmouth {{and the formation of}} a heavy weapons troop in each commando. The new troop with mortar and Vickers machine gun sections provided the heavy weapons needed for their new role as assault infantry. By now the Commandos had started to move away from smaller raiding operations. They were formed into units intended to spearhead future Allied landing operations. To assist in this they were given the organic fire support weapons, that had been absent when they were a raiding force.|$|E
5|$|After {{ten months}} of training, Miller {{was offered a}} {{commission}} as a pilot officer. His best friend missed out, so he arranged for Flight Lieutenant Keith Johnson an Australian cricket official, to pull some strings, ensuring his friend's promotion. The pair were posted to 12 Advanced Flying Unit in Grantham, Lincolnshire in on 15 August 1944, which was an Operations Training Unit {{for the purpose of}} familiarising officers with flying aircraft. However, on a trip back to Ouston to visit their colleagues, a night of drunken revelry led to property damage and injury to another airman. Miller and his friend were charged with eight offences and faced possible expulsion. Luckily for Miller, the Commanding Officer (CO) at his new posting at Cranfield, Buckinghamshire was his old CO at Ouston. Miller was given another three-week disciplinary course, but his pleas convinced <b>the</b> <b>CO</b> to reduce the sentence to a fine for the property damage. Miller was allowed to resume his training in Beauforts, Beaufighters and Mosquitos. Again he had a near miss, when some instruments on his plane failed and he was forced to land his Beaufighter for repairs. After the repairs, another pilot used the plane and the problem recurred. The second pilot crash-landed and was killed. Later, Miller was returning from a training mission over France and misjudged the runway, bouncing his plane on the tarmac. Trying to lift off again, only one engine responded and the unequal power supply caused the plane to swerve, missing the hangar by centimetres. He then escaped death by skipping a social appointment that he had agreed to attend. A V1 rocket hit the venue and killed many of the patrons inside. In October, he went AWOL to watch violinist Yehudi Menuhin perform in London and was dismissed, but <b>the</b> <b>CO</b> revoked his decision on the condition that Miller play for his cricket team.|$|E

5|$|Johnson's old injury {{continued}} to trouble {{him and he}} found flying high performance aircraft like the Spitfire extremely painful. RAF medics gave him two options; he could have an operation that would correct the problem, but this meant he would miss the Battle of Britain, or becoming a training instructor flying the light Tiger Moth. Johnson opted for the operation. He had hoped for discreet treatment, but word soon reached <b>the</b> <b>CO,</b> and Johnson was taken off flying duties {{and sent to the}} RAF Hospital at Rauceby. He did not return to the squadron until 28 December 1940. CO Burton took Johnson up for a test flight on 31 December 1940 in Miles Magister L8151. After the 45-minute flight, Johnson's fitness to fly was approved.|$|E
25|$|Although a Super CO Power is in {{many cases}} better than the normal CO Power, <b>the</b> <b>CO</b> Meter is drained {{differently}} depending on which power was activated. While Super CO Power will drain <b>the</b> <b>CO</b> Meter completely, the normal CO Power would leave players with some leftover charge on <b>the</b> <b>CO</b> Meter {{depending on how much}} existed before <b>the</b> <b>CO</b> Power. This allows for more strategy than Advance Wars since the player must now decide between using weaker abilities more frequently or greater abilities less frequently.|$|E

25|$|Carbon {{itself is}} solid at {{case-hardening}} temperatures {{and so is}} immobile. Transport {{to the surface of}} the steel was as gaseous carbon monoxide, generated by the breakdown of the carburising compound and the oxygen packed into the sealed box. This takes place with pure carbon but too slowly to be workable. Although oxygen is required for this process it is re-circulated through <b>the</b> <b>CO</b> cycle and so can be carried out inside a sealed box. The sealing is necessary to stop <b>the</b> <b>CO</b> either leaking out or being oxidised to CO2 by excess outside air.|$|E

25|$|One {{of the key}} added {{features}} of Black Hole Rising over its predecessor is the Super CO Power. <b>The</b> <b>CO</b> Power, introduced in Advance Wars, was a special ability unique to each commanding officer that could be triggered as the commanding officer's CO Meter filled by battle.

Black Hole Rising changed the format of <b>the</b> <b>CO</b> Meter to use small and large stars, although it essentially still functions as a fillable meter. A regular CO Power is still available by filling the small stars, but a more powerful Super CO Power, introduced in Black Hole Rising, can be triggered by filling the large stars as well.|$|E
