5|$|The {{shipping}} channel {{approaching the}} Fox River in Green Bay was changed {{a number of}} times in order to accommodate vessels of increasing draft. The Army Corps of Engineers also modified the channel in the mid 1920's. The Green Bay Harbor Entrance buoy was established in 1927 to mark this point until the Bureau of Lighthouses could obtain funds for a more permanent solution. The acetylene buoy emitted a flash of 0.3 seconds duration every 3 seconds and had a wave-activated bell. The light {{is one of the few}} on the Great Lakes still powered by submarine cable. It is issued from a pair of 300mm <b>Tideland</b> Signal ML300 acrylic optics mounted on the gallery railing. Because the light is too far out to be seen well from shore, the only good view of it is from a boat.|$|E

500|$|Post-production was {{severely}} delayed when Gilliam {{disagreed with the}} Weinsteins over the final cut privilege. In the meantime, the conflict lasted so long that Gilliam {{had enough time to}} shoot another feature film, <b>Tideland.</b> To create the visual effects, Gilliam awarded the shots to Peerless Camera, the London-based effects studio he founded in the late-1970s with visual effects supervisor Kent Houston. However, two months into filming, Houston said that Peerless [...] "ran into a number of major issues with The Brothers Grimm and with the Weinstein Brothers". He continued that [...] "the main problem {{was the fact that the}} number of effects shots had dramatically increased, mainly because of issues that arose during shooting with the physical effects." [...] Meanwhile, the Queen's chamber inside the tower was actually built by the Art Department as 2 sets. One set was resplendent and new while the other was old and decrepit. The sets were joined to each other by the central mirror, a piece of transparent glass giving the illusion that a single set was reflected and used to create the effect.|$|E
50|$|The {{question}} arose {{for federal}} nations whether the <b>tidelands</b> for formerly independent coastal states had been ceded {{to the federal}} union on admission, or retained. The admission of the former Republic of Texas as a state in the United States in 1845 stipulated that its <b>tidelands</b> remained the territory of Texas. This has been an issue for {{oil and natural gas}} leases and federally funded development that affects such <b>tidelands.</b>|$|R
2500|$|Prior to Washington {{statehood}} in 1889, {{the question}} of title to the <b>tidelands</b> was entirely unclear. Yesler and others had built onto the <b>tidelands</b> regardless of this legal limbo. The number of these [...] "tideland jumpers" [...] increased up as statehood approached. Officially, the federal government held the <b>tidelands</b> in trust for the future state, and all such activities—which included the construction of railways—were technically illegal. The new state constitution fashioned a compromise measure: the state generally affirmed its own ownership of <b>tidelands,</b> but provided for case-by-case exceptions to be adjudicated by the courts. In many cases, adjudication {{had to be made}} between upland owners and those who had built on pilings on the <b>tidelands.</b> Constitutional provisions were also made for state-owned harbors with zones along the shore reserved for [...] "landings, wharves and streets and other conveniences of navigation and commerce." [...] All this was later modified to allow towns and municipalities to gain more control of their own shorelines, setting the stage for coherent plans for development and reclamation.|$|R

500|$|Arthur caused {{power outages}} {{impacting}} at least 44,000customers, of which 16,500were in Carteret County; another 1,000outages each occurred in Craven and New Hanover counties. As a result, Duke Energy deployed over 500personnel to restore electrical service, while <b>Tideland</b> EMC handled more than 2,000outages in Pamlico, Hyde and Craven counties. Strong winds toppled trees and power poles in Hyde County and Ocracoke Island, and flooding occurred {{just south of}} downtown Wilmington, North Carolina. On other areas along the coast, flood waters reached [...] deep; with widespread coastal erosion observed in many areas. Meanwhile, at Wrightsville Beach, the hurricane tore off shingles and partially defoliated palm trees, and in Manteo, [...] of water inundated several businesses. Nearby, Kill Devil Hills experienced flooding to numerous residences and roads. Copious rainfall and strong winds were reported along the Outer Banks; at least one additional county {{was added to the}} North Carolina's state of emergency declaration, and while officials in Dare County initially intended to cut off access to the county while potential destruction was being surveyed, the curfew ended just after sunrise. Emergency officials announced the intention to begin damage assessments throughout the state as sunrise approached and Arthur departed the region.|$|E
2500|$|The {{original}} motion picture soundtrack of The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus was composed by Mychael Danna and Jeff Danna {{who had previously}} worked on Gilliam's <b>Tideland</b> (2005).

2500|$|The second {{lighthouse}} {{was constructed}} in 1895 {{and for a while}} served as the rear light in the range. It had a , timber framed corrugated galvanized iron clad tower, with a lantern and a balcony. The original optical apparatus was a 4th order fixed lens with kerosene wick burner. In 1930 the light was converted to acetylene lighting, with sun valve and flasher. By 1977 the original lens had been removed and a solar powered <b>Tideland</b> ML-300 electric beacon installed. [...] A pilot station was established on the foreshore nearby in 1919, and closed in 1963.|$|E

[...] There is an extensive pickleweed habitat at the western end of the bay, where many acres of mudflat areas are exposed to shorebirds at low tide at the efflux of Pickleweed Inlet. [...] Upland plants found at the perimeter of Richardson's Bay include toyon, coast live oak, California bay, and native California bunch grasses.|$|E
2500|$|In late 1969 Elliot Berman joined Exxon's {{task force}} which {{was looking for}} {{projects}} 30 {{years in the future}} and in April 1973 he founded Solar Power Corporation, a wholly owned subsidiary of Exxon at that time. The group had concluded that electrical power would be much more expensive by 2000, and felt that this increase in price would make alternative energy sources more attractive. He conducted a market study and concluded that a price per watt of about $20/watt would create significant demand. The team eliminated the steps of polishing the wafers and coating them with an anti-reflective layer, relying on the rough-sawn wafer surface. The team also replaced the expensive materials and hand wiring used in space applications with a printed circuit board on the back, acrylic plastic on the front, and silicone glue between the two, [...] "potting" [...] the cells. Solar cells could be made using cast-off material from the electronics market. By 1973 they announced a product, and SPC convinced <b>Tideland</b> Signal to use its panels to power navigational buoys, initially for the U.S. Coast Guard.|$|E
2500|$|Gans {{said that}} casting of Mitchell {{as the lead}} for the film is [...] "a matter of feeling. If you play Silent Hill you know that each {{character}} has a very special poetic quality. They are both twisted and sophisticated. We tried to {{keep that in mind}} when we did the casting on this film." [...] Bean's role in the film was originally kept to {{the beginning and the end}} of the movie, but due to studio pressure for a male lead, his role was expanded into a subplot. Gans cast Holden after seeing her in The Majestic: [...] "in The Majestic, she was beautifully feminine and I cast her so I could show her other side, make her strong and sleek. Gans saw Ferland as [...] "the ideal actress" [...] after viewing the television show Kingdom Hospital and her screen test for Terry Gilliam's film <b>Tideland.</b> To prepare for her role, Krige read the book The End of Days by Erna Paris, a book about tyranny during the Spanish Inquisition.|$|E

The dominant species in this area were; Halophila ovalis, Cymodocea serrulata, Cymodocea rotundata, Enhalus acoroides. H. ovalis dominated in shallow areas mainly on <b>tidelands</b> and in deep areas, E. acoroides dominated areas that received the strongest influence of drift sand, such as shallow offshore sides of the seagrass meadows, or waterways. Along coastal sides of E. acoroides communities, the comparatively calm inner sides were dominated by C. serrulata and C. rotundata. Among those seagrass meadows, concentration of dugong feeding trails were observed at H. ovalis communities in <b>tidelands,</b> therefore dugongs selectively feed on H. ovalis at <b>tidelands</b> in this study site during dry season...|$|R
