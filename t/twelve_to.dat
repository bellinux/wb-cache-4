5|$|CSU {{released}} its first prediction on December5, 2003, which projected an above average season, with 13named storms, seven hurricanes, and three major hurricanes. This forecast was adjusted upward slightly on April2. On May17, {{prior to the}} start of the season, NOAA forecasters predicted a 50% probability of activity above the normal range, with <b>twelve</b> <b>to</b> fifteen tropical storms, six to eight of those becoming hurricanes, and two to four those hurricanes reaching major intensity. Dr. Gray released a prediction on May 28 that was similar, with 14named storms, eightreaching hurricane strength, and threebecoming major hurricanes.|$|E

5|$|Libya {{was also}} {{expected}} to be an early export customer for <b>twelve</b> <b>to</b> fifteen Su-35s along with other Russian weapons; however, {{the civil war in}} Libya and the resulting military intervention cancelled such plans. Russia has also offered the modernized Su-35 to India, Malaysia, and Greece; no firm contracts have materialised, with the first two countries having been occupied with other fighter projects and unlikely to procure the modernized Su-35.|$|E
5|$|Like Highway401, {{a portion}} of the route is divided into a collector-express system with <b>twelve</b> <b>to</b> {{fourteen}} continuous lanes. Notable about Highway427 are its several multi-level interchanges; the junctions with QEW and Highway401 are two of the largest interchanges in Ontario and were constructed between 1967 and 1971, while the interchanges with Highway409 and Highway407 are more recent and were completed in 1992 and 1995, respectively.|$|E
5|$|South Africa, Zimbabwe and Kenya {{hosted the}} 2003 World Cup. The number of teams {{participating}} in the event increased from <b>twelve</b> <b>to</b> fourteen. Kenya's victories over Sri Lanka and Zimbabwe, among others– and a forfeit by the New Zealand team, which refused to play in Kenya because of security concerns– enabled Kenya to reach the semi-finals, the best result by an associate. In the final, Australia made 359 runs {{for the loss of}} two wickets, the largest ever total in a final, defeating India by 125 runs.|$|E

5|$|The {{introduction}} of semifinals in 2002 raised the potential number of contestants from around <b>twelve</b> <b>to</b> thirty-two. A children's {{version of the}} competition, Lilla Melodifestivalen, also began that year. Light orchestrated pop songs, known locally as schlager music, are so prevalent that the festival is {{sometimes referred to as}} Schlagerfestivalen ("The schlager festival") by the Swedish media. However, other styles of music such as rap, reggae, and glam rock have made an appearance since the event's expansion. The {{introduction of}} a grand final in Stockholm has attracted substantial tourism to the city.|$|E
5|$|Those {{individuals}} and institutions {{who are already}} armigerous through recognised heraldic authorities worldwide may apply to the Canadian Heraldic Authority to have their arms registered. There is no cost associated with application for registration, and it takes less time, approximately three months, than application for a new award of arms, which takes approximately <b>twelve</b> <b>to</b> fourteen months.|$|E
5|$|By 1918, {{the number}} of front line {{infantry}} within the British Army in France had decreased, leading to a manpower crisis. In an attempt to consolidate manpower and to increase {{the number of}} machine guns and artillery support available to the infantry, the number of battalions in a division was cut from <b>twelve</b> <b>to</b> nine. This had the effect of reducing the establishment of a division from 18,825 men to 16,035. In addition, to ease reinforcement, an attempt was made to consolidate as many battalions from the same regiment within the same brigade. These changes impacted the division, resulting in the 15th RWF, 11th SWB and 10th and 16th Welsh being disbanded and the 2nd RWF joining from the 33rd Division. These changes to the division also saw the machine gun companies consolidated into a single battalion, one medium mortar battery broken up and absorbed by the remaining two batteries and the heavy mortar battery leaving the division to become a Corps asset.|$|E

5|$|Stanley Savige {{was born}} on 26 June 1890, in Morwell, Victoria, the eldest of eight {{children}} to Samuel Savige, a butcher, and his wife Ann Nora, née Walmsley. Stan Savige left Korumburra State School {{at the age of}} <b>twelve</b> <b>to</b> work as a blacksmith's striker. While at Korumburra, he enlisted in the school junior cadets as a bugler. The family moved to Prahran, Victoria, in 1907, where Savige worked at a variety of jobs and served in the Prahran senior cadets for 18months, from 1907 to 1909. He became a scoutmaster, forming the First Yarra Troop. Savige was {{an active member of the}} South Yarra Baptist Church, where he was a Sunday school teacher. Through his church activities, Savige met Lilian Stockton, to whom he became engaged on New Year's Day, 1914.|$|E
5|$|The Follo Line {{will allow}} the {{capacity}} in the South Corridor from Oslo to increase from about <b>twelve</b> <b>to</b> forty trains per hour. Local and freight trains will use the Østfold Line, while regional and express trains will use the Follo Line. Travel time will be reduced from 22 to 11 minutes. With a new line, there will be 11,000 more public transport trips through the corridor; this includes a 67% increase during rush-hour and 43% {{the rest of the}} day. This allows a reduction of 5,800 car trips per day and reduces carbon dioxide emissions of 5,474 tonnes. Rush hour capacity would be eight trains per hour to Kolbotn, with four continuing to Ski along the old line. The new line would be served by four trains to Moss, two to Mysen and two to Halden. There would be half the frequency during off-peak hours.|$|E
5|$|The blacknose shark has a slender, {{streamlined}} {{body with a}} long, rounded snout and large eyes. There is a well-developed flap of skin {{in front of each}} nostril, defining the inflow and outflow openings. <b>Twelve</b> <b>to</b> 13 and 11 to 12 tooth rows occur {{on either side of the}} upper and lower jaws, respectively, with one or two teeth at the symphysis (middle). The teeth are triangular and oblique, with serrated edges; the upper teeth are stouter than the lower teeth. The five pairs of gill slits are short, measuring less a third the length of the first dorsal fin base.|$|E

5|$|The {{body of the}} finetooth shark is {{slender and}} streamlined. The snout is long and pointed, with the nares preceded by short, broadly {{triangular}} flaps of skin. The eyes are large and round, with nictitating membranes (protective third eyelids). The mouth is broad with well-defined furrows at the corners. <b>Twelve</b> <b>to</b> 15 tooth rows occur {{on either side of}} the upper jaw and 1314 tooth rows {{on either side of the}} lower jaw.

5|$|The codex {{consists}} of parchment, originally in double sheets, {{which may have}} measured about 40 by 70cm. The whole codex consists, with a few exceptions, of quires of eight leaves, a format popular throughout the Middle Ages. Each line of the text has some <b>twelve</b> <b>to</b> fourteen Greek uncial letters, arranged in four columns (48 lines per column) with carefully chosen line breaks and slightly ragged right edges. When opened, the eight columns thus presented to the reader have much the same appearance as the succession of columns in a papyrus roll. The poetical books of the Old Testament are written stichometrically, in only two columns per page. The codex has almost 4,000,000 uncial letters.|$|E
5|$|The mid-year {{population}} of Portland in 2010 was 12,400; this figure has remained around <b>twelve</b> <b>to</b> thirteen thousand since the 1970s. In 2010 there were 5,786 dwellings {{in an area}} of , giving an approximate population density of 1100 people per km2 (4.5 per acre). The population is almost entirely native to England—94.9 percent of residents are of white British ethnicity, well above the England and Wales average of 80.5 percent. The average price of a detached house on Portland in 2010 was £194,200; terraced houses are cheaper, at £149,727, and an apartment or maisonette costs £110,500.|$|E

5|$|Their {{income was}} modest, with George's small per annum living; Cassandra brought the {{expectation}} of a small inheritance {{at the time of}} her mother's death to the marriage. They took up temporary residence at the nearby Deane rectory until Steventon, a 16th century house in disrepair, underwent necessary renovations. Cassandra gave birth to three children while living at Deane: James in 1765, George in 1766, and Edward in 1767. Her custom was to keep an infant at home for several months and then placed it with Elizabeth Littlewood, a woman living nearby to nurse and raise for <b>twelve</b> <b>to</b> eighteen months.|$|E
5|$|With {{regards to}} the plot, the {{producers}} wanted to repeat the same style as the previous sixth series and include another story-arc in the seventh. The writers and producers got together {{to think about what}} is to become a big political story that will affect the United Kingdom in <b>twelve</b> <b>to</b> eighteen months time. They decided on using the resurgence of power in Russia following the end of the Cold War, which the producers felt in subtle ways, is threatening the security of the West. The new storyline would allow the series to return to the world of spying, truth, and who the character should trust. The episode was written by Neil Cross. It was also additionally written by Ben Richards.|$|E
5|$|After {{the end of}} {{the promotional}} period, Burger King {{received}} numerous complaints from fans of Chicken Fries through social media sites such as Twitter and Facebook. One of the major ways the company responded was through personalized responses to these posts. Instead of using an automated response that would paste a standardized message on people's Twitter feeds, the company instead employed several staff to personally respond to customers voicing displeasure on the LTO nature of the 2014 introduction. The entire 2014 Chicken Fries promotion represented a major shift in the attitude towards advertising for Burger King, moving from a more traditional advertising structure to one focused almost entirely on digitally-based media. This change happened fairly quickly, falling into place over the <b>twelve</b> <b>to</b> eighteen-month period preceding the reintroduction of Chicken Fries to the chain's menu. Along with the new advertising firm, a new director of digital marketing and social media was newly hired from cosmetics firm L'Oréal was added, increasing the clout of the digital advertising team within the chain.|$|E
