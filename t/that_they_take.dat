5|$|Federal law prohibits {{alcoholic}} beverages from being shipped through the mail. New Jersey effectively prohibits the shipment {{of beer and}} spirits to customers by requiring a liquor license to transport alcohol, but not having any class of liquor license that grants permission to ship beer or spirits. United Parcel Service (UPS) and Federal Express will ship wine to a person's home, but will only deliver beer or hard liquor to a licensed business. Although uncommon, it is legal for a liquor store to deliver {{alcoholic beverages}} by car or van to a person's home. ABC regulations mandate that the alcoholic beverages being delivered are paid for in advance, that they are received by someone 21 or older, and <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>take</b> place when the licensed establishment is permitted to be open.|$|E
5|$|Leaving Cirencester in July 1920, Hammond {{planned to}} go to Winchester Agricultural College, {{following}} the path into farming mapped out by his mother. However, his plans changed when his headmaster wrote to the captain of Gloucestershire, Foster Robinson, reporting Hammond's school cricket record and suggesting <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>take</b> a look at him. Hammond, who scored a century in his first appearance in adult cricket days after leaving school, played in a trial match for the Gloucestershire Club and Ground, scoring 60 runs, taking two wickets and impressing the local press. Subsequently, two members of Gloucestershire's committee visited Hammond's mother {{in an attempt to}} sign him for the club. Hammond's mother was initially reluctant, but his eagerness finally convinced her and he signed a professional contract.|$|E

Even now in the Meghalaya Legislative Assembly or village councils or panchayats the representation of women in politics is minimal. As of 2013, in a Meghalaya Legislative Assembly of 60 members, there are only four women. In the male centric Dorbar Shnong, which is the basic political arm of the tribes, women are not permitted to hold office. However, women feel <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>take</b> better care of money matters than men and they enjoy economic freedom.|$|E

5|$|Accompanied by Brady, Hindley {{approached}} 12-year-old John Kilbride in {{the early}} evening of 23 November 1963, at a market in Ashton-under-Lyne and offered him a lift home on the pretext that his parents would be worried about him being out so late. With the added inducement of a bottle of sherry, Kilbride readily agreed to get into the Ford Anglia car that Hindley had hired. Brady told Kilbride that the sherry was at their home, and they would have to make a detour to collect it. On the way he suggested <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>take</b> another detour, to search for a glove he said that Hindley had lost on the moor. When they reached the moor Brady took the child with him while Hindley waited in the car. Brady sexually assaulted Kilbride and attempted to slit his throat with a six-inch serrated blade before fatally strangling him with a piece of string, possibly a shoelace.|$|E

They both agree to begin liberating the various boroughs of London by defeating Templar-controlled gangs, sabotaging Templar-controlled businesses, assassinating high ranking Templars, and building up their own criminal gang called the Rooks. Along the way, they enlist the help of various people including: Charles Dickens, Frederick Abberline, Alexander Graham Bell, Florence Nightingale, Edward Hodson Bayley, and a young Arthur Conan Doyle.|$|E
25|$|At long last, the {{youthful}} Chinese are today {{more worried about}} more extensive issues that go past mutual interests.

Be that as it may, {{the youthful}} Chinese set these inside the bigger national structure of between ethnic collaboration, equity and human rights, and defending of nature (Lee,2011). Thus numerous youthful Chinese experts are attracted to NGOs and common society developments. Also, in the event <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>take</b> part in legislative issues they join multi-ethnic parties.

25|$|The {{eggs are}} round and white, and about 45mm in diameter. The {{hatchlings}} remain buried for days until they all emerge together at night. At around 50 to 70 days, the eggs hatch during the night, and the hatchlings instinctively head {{directly into the}} water. This {{is the most dangerous}} time in a turtle's life. As they walk, predators, such as gulls and crabs, feed on them. A significant percentage never make it to the ocean. Little is known of the initial life history of newly hatched sea turtles. Juveniles spend three to five years in the open ocean before they settle as still-immature juveniles into their permanent shallow-water lifestyle. It is speculated <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>take</b> twenty to fifty years to reach sexual maturity. Individuals live up to eighty years in the wild. It is estimated that only 1% of hatchlings reach sexual maturity.|$|E
25|$|On July 11, 1764, the British {{government}} {{passed an}} order-in-council to permit Acadians to legally return to British territories, provided <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>take</b> an unqualified oath of allegiance. Some Acadians returned to Nova Scotia (which included present-day New Brunswick). Under the deportation orders, Acadian land tenure had been forfeited to the British crown and the returning Acadians no longer owned land. Beginning in 1760 {{much of their}} former land was distributed under grant to the New England Planters. The lack of available farmland compelled many Acadians to seek out a new livelihood as fishermen {{on the west coast}} of Nova Scotia, known as the French Shore. The British authorities scattered other Acadians in small groups along the shores of the Atlantic Ocean and the Gulf of Saint Lawrence. It was not until the 1930s, {{with the advent of the}} Acadian co-operative movements, that the Acadians became less economically disadvantaged.|$|E

25|$|With a German {{offensive}} against Vimy {{or on the}} Lys sector apparently imminent, Tavish Davidson visited Foch at Beauvais (6 April). He asked for a French offensive, or <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>take</b> over front {{as far north as}} the Somme, or send French reserves to behind the British front. Haig also wrote to Foch that day. Haig met Foch at Aumale on 7 April; Foch said he wanted an offensive by Rawlinson’s Fourth Army (the former Fifth Army) in cooperation with Debeney’s French First Army. Haig regarded this as a time-wasting tactic as Fourth Army was still in no shape to attack. Foch was willing to deploy 4 French infantry and 3 cavalry divisions near Amiens but not further north. Haig asked Henry Wilson to come out and lobby Foch. Foch may have been influenced by a German attack (by General von Boehm’s Seventh Army) against the French (“Archangel”), towards the Oise-Aisne Canal on the morning of 7 April, which took more prisoners than the Germans suffered casualties.|$|E
25|$|The {{protozoan}} Ophryocystis elektroscirrha {{is another}} parasite of the monarch. It infects the subcutaneous tissues and propagates by spores formed during the pupal stage. The spores are found {{over all of}} the body of infected butterflies, with the greatest number on the abdomen. These spores are passed, from female to caterpillar, when spores rub off during egg laying and are then ingested by caterpillars. Severely infected individuals are weak, unable to expand their wings, or unable to eclose, and have shortened lifespans, but parasite levels vary in populations. This is not the case in laboratory rearing, where after a few generations, all individuals can be infected. Infection with this parasite creates an effect known as culling whereby migrating monarchs that are infected are less likely to complete the migration. This results in overwintering populations with lower parasite loads. Owners of commercial butterfly breeding operations claim <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>take</b> steps to control this parasite in their practices, although this claim is doubted by most scientists who study monarchs.|$|E
25|$|The {{second group}} {{proposed}} {{that there were}} three major pathways that most animal domesticates followed into domestication: (1) commensals, adapted to a human niche (e.g., dogs, cats, fowl, possibly pigs); (2) prey animals sought for food (e.g., sheep, goats, cattle, water buffalo, yak, pig, reindeer, llama and alpaca); and (3) targeted animals for draft and nonfood resources (e.g., horse, donkey, camel). The beginnings of animal domestication involved a protracted coevolutionary process with multiple stages along different pathways. Humans {{did not intend to}} domesticate animals from, or at least they did not envision a domesticated animal resulting from, either the commensal or prey pathways. In both of these cases, humans became entangled with these species as the relationship between them, and the human role in their survival and reproduction, intensified. Although the directed pathway proceeded from capture to taming, the other two pathways are not as goal-oriented and archaeological records suggest <b>that</b> <b>they</b> <b>take</b> place over much longer time frames.|$|E
