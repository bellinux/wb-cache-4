5|$|A third {{component}} of motion that occurs relatively infrequently involves {{the interaction of}} multiple tropical cyclones. When two cyclones approach one another, their centers will begin orbiting cyclonically about a point between the <b>two</b> <b>systems.</b> Depending on their separation distance and strength, the two vortices may simply orbit around one another or else may spiral into the center point and merge. When the two vortices are of unequal size, the larger vortex will tend to dominate the interaction, and the smaller vortex will orbit around it. This phenomenon is called the Fujiwhara effect, after Sakuhei Fujiwhara.|$|E
5|$|Fireflies use {{light to}} attract mates. <b>Two</b> <b>systems</b> are {{involved}} according to species; in one, females emit light from their abdomens to attract males; in the other, flying males emit signals {{to which the}} sometimes sedentary females respond. Click beetles emit an orange light from the abdomen when flying and a green light from the thorax when they are disturbed or moving about on the ground. The former is probably a sexual attractant but the latter may be defensive. Larvae of the click beetle Pyrophorus nyctophanus live in the surface layers of termite mounds in Brazil. They light up the mounds by emitting a bright greenish glow which attracts the flying insects on which they feed.|$|E

5|$|For {{most of the}} 19th and 20th centuries, the United Kingdom largely {{used the}} long scale, whereas the United States used the short scale, so that the <b>two</b> <b>systems</b> were often {{referred}} to as British and American in the English language.

5|$|However other scholars, such as Arthur Berriedale Keith, J. Burnet and A.R. Wadia, {{believe that}} the <b>two</b> <b>systems</b> {{developed}} independently. They note {{that there is no}} historical evidence of the philosophers of the two schools meeting, and point out significant differences in the stage of development, orientation and goals of the two philosophical systems. Wadia writes that Plato's metaphysics were rooted in this life and his primary aim was to develop an ideal state. In contrast, Upanishadic focus was the individual, the self (atman, soul), self-knowledge, and the means of an individual's moksha (freedom, liberation in this life or after-life).|$|E
5|$|In April 1958, Eisenhower asked Congress for {{legislation}} {{to overhaul the}} Department of Defense. Over a decade had passed since the legislation which had established it, and {{he was concerned about}} the degree of inter-service rivalry, duplication and mismanagement that was evident in many programs. In ballistic missile development, the Soviet Sputnik program had demonstrated that country's technological lead over the United States. The Army and Air Force had rival programs, PGM-19 Jupiter and PGM-17 Thor respectively, and the additional cost to the taxpayers of developing <b>two</b> <b>systems</b> instead of one was estimated at $500million.|$|E

5|$|On November 2, a trough of {{low-pressure}} {{was analyzed}} near the Lesser Antilles. The system moved westward into the Caribbean Sea without much organization. On November 7, the low-pressure area moved south of Cuba and became sufficiently organized {{to be considered}} a tropical depression with a pressure of at least 1010 mbar (hPa; 29.83 inHg). The depression moved over Cuba and into the Atlantic, where it dissipated the following day. On November 9, a second system was detected northeast of Bermuda with a pressure of 1005 mbar (hPa; 29.68 inHg), though it remained unclear whether the <b>two</b> <b>systems</b> were related.|$|E
5|$|S. L. de Silva and P.

5|$|Shortly {{after the}} JTWC issued their final {{advisory}} on Lucille, the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) began monitoring the system near Luzon as a tropical depression. By May28, radiosonde data from Clark Air Base in Luzon {{indicated that the}} second system acquired a closed circulation at the 500mb level and began moving northeastward. While crossing the northern Philippines, the <b>two</b> <b>systems</b> merged and became a single cyclone, retaining the name Lucille. During its passage of the country, winds up to 63km/h (39mph) were reported in Manila. Once back over open waters, the system intensified as it accelerated northeastward, attaining tropical storm intensity early on May30.|$|E

5|$|Subtropical {{cyclones}} with hurricane-force {{winds of}} greater than 33m/s, (119km/h, 64knots, or 74mph) are not officially {{recognized by the}} National Hurricane Center.

Although the season began early with <b>two</b> <b>systems</b> in January, the bulk of activity was confined from September to December. The official India Meteorological Department tracked 12depressions in the basin, and the unofficial Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) monitored two additional storms.

5|$|The apothecaries' system {{often used}} the same ounces as the {{precious}} metals system, although even then the number of ounces in a pound could be different. The apothecaries' pound was divided into its own special units, which were inherited (via influential treatises of Greek physicians such as Dioscorides and Galen, 1st and 2nd century) from the general-purpose weight system of the Romans. Where the apothecaries' weights and the normal commercial weights were different, {{it was not always}} clear which of the <b>two</b> <b>systems</b> was used in trade between merchants and apothecaries, or by which system apothecaries weighed medicine when they actually sold it.
