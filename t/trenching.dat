Raman were the directors of operation from 1989 to 1992. Steven Sidebothom of the University of Delaware, who had back ground knowledge of Roman Egypt, {{was in charge of the}} <b>trenching</b> at the site. Further excavations were done during six working seasons from 1989 to 1992, which led to a contradictory view that the brick structures and the wells investigated by Wheeler were of poor quality as they were founded on poor sandy foundations. The wood work was also noted to be of poor quality and the houses had no waterproofing. The excavations also lead to a view that Arikamedu's Roman trading link was more of an inference. The excavations have now established that the trading with Rome extended to a period beyond that assessed by Wheeler; that trading continued from the second century BCE to the seventh or eighth century CE.|$|E

25|$|To obtain {{information}} about the soil conditions below the surface, some form of subsurface exploration is required. Methods of observing the soils below the surface, obtaining samples, and determining physical properties of the soils and rocks include test pits, <b>trenching</b> (particularly for locating faults and slide planes), boring, and in situ tests.|$|E

5000|$|Very {{early in}} the war, British {{defensive}} doctrine suggested a main <b>trench</b> system of three parallel lines, interconnected by communications <b>trenches.</b> The point at which a communications <b>trench</b> intersected the front <b>trench</b> was of critical importance, and it was usually heavily fortified. The front <b>trench</b> was lightly garrisoned and typically only occupied in force during [...] "stand to" [...] at dawn and dusk. Between 70 and 100 yd behind the front <b>trench</b> was located the support (or [...] "travel") <b>trench,</b> to which the garrison would retreat when the front <b>trench</b> was bombarded.|$|R
25|$|The {{composition}} of the inner <b>trench</b> slope and a first-order control on <b>trench</b> morphology is determined by sediment supply. Active accretionary prisms are common in <b>trenches</b> near continents where rivers or glaciers supply great volumes of sediment to the <b>trench.</b> These filled <b>trenches</b> may lack the bathymetric expression of a <b>trench.</b> The Cascadia margin of the northwest USA is a filled <b>trench,</b> the result of sedimentation by the rivers of the western United States and Canada.|$|R
25|$|A Lofall Fault {{has been}} {{reported}} {{on the basis of}} marine seismic reflection surveying, but has not been confirmed by <b>trenching.</b> This fault seems {{to be associated with the}} Kingston arch anticline, and part of the uplift and basin pattern, but shortened because of the geometry of the SWIF. It is not notably seismogenic.|$|E
25|$|So too, many of {{the spirits}} {{especially}} concerned with the operations of nature are conceived as neutral or even benevolent; the European peasant fears the corn-spirit only when he irritates him by <b>trenching</b> on his domain and taking his property by cutting the corn; similarly, {{there is no reason}} why the more insignificant personages of the pantheon should be conceived as malevolent, and we find that the Petara of the Dyaks are far from indiscriminate and malignant, being viewed as invisible guardians of mankind.|$|E
25|$|The chert was {{discovered}} by William Mackie while mapping the western margin of the Rhynie basin in 1910–1913. Trenches were cut into the chert {{at the end of}} this period, and Robert Kidston and William Henry Lang worked furiously to describe the plant fossils between 1917 and 1921. The arthropods were examined soon afterwards by different workers. Interest in the chert then waned until the field was reinvigorated by Alexander Geoffrey Lyon in the late 1950s, and new material was collected by further <b>trenching</b> from 1963-71. Since 1980, the chert has been examined by the University of Münster, and from 1987 by Aberdeen University, whose researchers confirmed that the chert was indeed produced in a hot spring setting.|$|E

50|$|A {{traverse}} <b>trench</b> is a <b>trench</b> dug {{perpendicular to}} a <b>trench</b> line, but extending {{away from the}} enemy. It has two functions. One function {{is to provide a}}n entry into the main <b>trench.</b> A second function is to provide a place for defenders to shelter and regroup should the enemy have penetrated into the main <b>trench</b> and be able to fire down the main <b>trench's</b> length.|$|R
50|$|A {{traverse}} in <b>trench</b> warfare is {{an adaptation}} to reduce casualties to defenders occupying a <b>trench.</b> One form of traverse is a U-shaped detour in the <b>trench</b> with the <b>trench</b> going around a protrusion formed {{of earth and}} sandbags. The fragments or shrapnel, or shockwave from a shell landing and exploding within a <b>trench</b> then cannot spread past the obstacle the traverse interposes. Also, an enemy that has entered a <b>trench</b> is unable to fire down the length at the defenders, or otherwise enfilade the <b>trench.</b>|$|R
25|$|On 15 June 1702, Louis of Baden {{left his}} camp at Langenkandel and {{advanced}} his entire army to {{the vicinity of}} Landau. He disposed his troops in six encampments around the fortress with his headquarters at Arzheim. In the siege which began on the 16th, three attacks were planned. Louis personally directed the main attack against the south gate. The counts of Nassau-Weilburg and Leiningen led the Palatine troops in a false attack against the earthworks on Queichausfluss while Thüngen commanded the attack against the Crownwork. Using their plentiful supply of ammunition, the French gunners delivered heavy and accurate fire on the Imperial <b>trenching</b> forces.

500|$|Other scarps {{associated}} with the Seattle fault have been identified by LIDAR-based mapping; <b>trenching</b> has generally shown the faulting to be more complex than was first realized.

500|$|Lekson and McKenna {{note that}} {{following}} the rediscovery of Chetro Ketl {{in the early}} 19th century, the building's [...] "pace of dissolution increased alarmingly... has deteriorated {{at a faster rate}} over the last century and a half than in the previous six." [...] Chetro Ketl's wooden elements have proven especially vulnerable in a region that lacks timber, with soldiers, cattlemen, and transients scavenging them from the structure. The rear balcony was present in 1901, but by 1921 the beams had been removed by people scouring the canyon for wood. The process of uncovering beams during excavation has further hastened their deterioration. Chaco Wash, which deepens and widens during summer rain showers, also threatens the canyon's ruins. The once prominent refuse mound has been all but destroyed by repeated <b>trenching</b> and by diverting arroyos near Chetro Ketl. Treasure hunting, livestock grazing, and early National Park Service stabilization efforts also contributed to the degradation of the structure, as have deep excavations that left Chaco Wash prone to flooding. Archeology was responsible for the catastrophic effects of a 1947 flood that destroyed the walls of twenty rooms and collapsed [...] of the north wall. It also toppled Chetro Ketl's tallest remnants.|$|E

50|$|The Farallon <b>Trench</b> was {{an ancient}} oceanic <b>trench</b> {{on the west}} coast of North America during the Late Cretaceous Epoch. The <b>trench</b> started disappearing when the Farallon Plate began subducting under the North American Plate. The Subduction of oceanic {{lithosphere}} occurs through <b>trench</b> migration. So that after the Farallon Plate completely subducted, there are only Juan de Fuca Plate remaining. The Farallon <b>Trench</b> then turned into the San Andreas Fault. Since then, it has spread out to the north, <b>trench</b> above Juan De Fuca Plate, and south, <b>trench</b> above Central America.

2500|$|Prior to 2000 {{prominent}} aeromagnetic anomalies strongly {{suggested that}} the fault zone continued southeast, perhaps {{as far as the}} town of Duvall, but this was uncertain as the SWIF is largely concealed, and the faint surface traces generally obliterated by urban development.

2500|$|Some herbivores use feeding {{behaviors}} {{that are capable of}} disarming the defenses of their host plants. [...] One such plant defensive strategy is the use of latex and resin canals that contain sticky toxins and digestibility reducers. [...] These canal systems store fluids under pressure, and when ruptured (i.e. from herbivory) secondary metabolic products flow to the release point. [...] Herbivores can evade this defense, however, by damaging the leaf veins. [...] This technique minimizes the outflow of latex or resin beyond the cut and allows herbivores to freely feed above the damaged section. [...] Several strategies are employed by herbivores to relieve canal pressure, including vein cutting and <b>trenching.</b> The technique used by the herbivore corresponds to the architecture of the canal system. Dussourd and Denno examined the behavior of 33 species of insect herbivores on 10 families of plants with canals and found that herbivores on plants with branching canal systems used vein cutting, while herbivores found on plants with net-like canal systems employed <b>trenching</b> to evade plant defenses.|$|E

40|$|<b>Trench</b> depth is {{important}} in low-voltage <b>trench</b> MOSFETs because it affects the switching losses through the gate-drain capacitance (C(GD)). The dependence of C(GD) on the <b>trench</b> depth is investigated by analytical modeling and experimental characterization. An analytical model that relates the <b>trench</b> depth, <b>trench</b> bottom oxide thickness, n(-) layer doping, and drain voltage (V(D)) to C(GD) is developed and validated by experimental measurements. <b>Trench</b> MOSFETs with thick bottom oxides have been fabricated with 1. 3 -, 1. 5 -, 1. 7 -, and 2 -mu m deep <b>trenches.</b> CV measurements show that C(GD) {{is proportional to the}} <b>trench</b> depth at low V(D) and becomes increasingly independent of <b>trench</b> depth as V(D) is increased. The model is used to show that this is due to C(GD) being dominated by the oxide capacitance at low V(D) and the depletion capacitance at high V(D). The fact that the average thickness of the <b>trench</b> bottom oxide decreases as the <b>trench</b> depth increases (because of additional sidewall oxide overlapping the drain) means that the impact of the <b>trench</b> depth is the highest at low V(D), where the depletion capacitance is ineffective...|$|R
