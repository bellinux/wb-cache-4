5|$|On 31 October 1517, Luther sent {{a letter}} to Archbishop of Mainz, Albert of Brandenburg, under whose {{authority}} the indulgences were being sold. In the letter, Luther addresses the archbishop out of a loyal desire to alert him to the pastoral problems created by the indulgence sermons. He assumes that Albert is unaware of what is being preached under his authority, and speaks out of concern <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>are</b> being led away from the gospel, and that the indulgence preaching may bring shame to Albert's name. Luther does not condemn indulgences or the current doctrine regarding them, nor even the sermons which had been preached themselves, as he had not seen them firsthand. Instead he states his concern regarding the misunderstandings of the people about indulgences which have been fostered by the preaching, such as the belief that any sin could be forgiven by indulgences or that the guilt as well as the punishment for sin could be forgiven by an indulgence. In a postscript, Luther wrote that Albert could find some theses on the matter enclosed with his letter, so that he could see the uncertainty surrounding the doctrine of indulgences in contrast to the preachers who spoke so confidently of the benefits of indulgences.|$|E

They accepted {{the authority of the}} British crown in Canada, defended its legitimacy, and preached obedience to the British ruler. For ultramontanes, the faith of Franco-Canadians was to survive by defending their Roman Catholic religion and the French language.|$|E

25|$|The {{authorization}} {{system was}} against Article 21 {{of the constitution}} that guarantees {{the freedom of speech}} and expression. Writing and publication of history textbook is a form of speech that is protected by the Constitution; however, the system of school textbook authorization as it was practiced in 1965 conducted thought control and prohibited publication and use of textbooks at schools that were deemed inappropriate according to a particular political ideology held by the government. According to Ienaga this falls under the category of censorship (検閲) that is prohibited by Section 2, Article 21 of the Constitution of Japan. Article 21 specifically prohibits censorship in an independent section because it is the principle of the democratic constitution of Japan <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>are</b> guaranteed the opportunities to freely enjoy the results of scholastic researches, be exposed to all sorts of ideas and opinions, and know socio-political reality and historical truth through various media such as press, radio, and television.|$|E
500|$|A {{key idea}} of {{democracy}} is that [...] "people may consent to be governed by laws made by ... democratically elected representatives". Judges are required to interpret statutes {{in a manner that}} gives [...] "effect to the intent and will of Parliament". By interpreting statutes according to Parliament's intention, the judiciary upholds the notion of representative democracy as it makes sure <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>are</b> ruled accurately by the laws made by their elected leaders. Thus, the role of judges in interpretation is essential to democracy.|$|E

500|$|A 2008 {{review of}} the episode written by Ahsan Haque of IGN was {{generally}} positive; Haque stated that while it {{he did not believe}} [...] "Chitty Chitty Death Bang" [...] was an [...] "instant classic," [...] it has [...] "plenty of memorable moments" [...] and [...] "a nicely crafted storyline."

500|$|Research by the Centre for Tropical Urban and Regional Planning at James Cook University has {{concluded}} that Palm Island has most of the resources {{it needs to be}} largely self-sufficient through housing, agriculture and tourism. [...] However Barry Moyle the Chief Executive Officer of the Palm Island Aboriginal Shire Council and former Mayor of Johnstone Shire Council suggests that the tourism potential of the island is hindered by the negative reputation that Palm Island is considered to have. [...] Moyle asserts that once potential tourists get past that negative image [...] "they will find really nice and beautiful people, with a rich culture, living on this untouched tropical gem of North Queensland". [...] Further, according to Moyle, [...] "it could be considered a big ask that people will get past the perception <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>are</b> all no-hoper alcoholics and perpetrators of domestic violence, which is considered to be the general reputation that Palm Islanders have in broader Australia. [...] Locals say that there are bad eggs, but that is the same in all communities." ...|$|E
500|$|It is not {{the case}} that every noun is only {{associated}} with one classifier. [...] Across dialects and speakers there is great variability in the way classifiers are used for the same words, and speakers often do not agree which classifier is best. For example, for cars some people use bù, others use tái, and still others use (...) liàng; Cantonese uses gaa3. [...] Even within a single dialect or a single speaker, the same noun may take different measure words depending on the style in which the person is speaking, or on different nuances the person wants to convey (for instance, measure words can reflect the speaker's judgment of or opinion about the object). An example of this is the word for person, rén, which uses the measure word (...) gè normally, but uses the measure kǒu when counting number of people in a household, and wèi when being particularly polite or honorific, and míng in formal, written contexts; likewise, a group of people may be referred to by massifiers as [...] (yì [...] rén, [...] "a [...] of people") or [...] (yì [...] rén, [...] "a [...] of people"): the first is neutral, whereas the second implies <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>are</b> unruly or otherwise being judged poorly.|$|E

2500|$|... "If {{you live}} with dignity and self-respect, the Kali would destroy itself" [...] is another oft-repeated verse from Akilattirattu. The {{importance}} of this instruction comes to light when considering that the destruction of Kali is projected in Akilattirattu {{as one of the}} chief motives of the mission of Ayya Vaikundar. The book, through various other narratives, underscores the point <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>are</b> to live in dignity. For example, the narrative on the origin of the Santror Makkal as the children of Narayana endowed the people with a divine pedigree, and it was a powerful story to drive home the message that the people were a dignified humanity. Some of the rituals that emerged in the life of Ayyavazhi were aimed at indoctrinating the message of human dignity. Wearing a piece of headgear during worship is an example of one of these rituals.|$|E
2500|$|Exactly {{what the}} term peace (in sacrifice-of-peace offering) refers to {{is a matter}} of debate, as is whether the deity was seen as a guest at the meal or as the host. Some {{scholars}} hold that the sacrifice-of-peace offering was a covenant of friendship expressing community between God and the people, and among the people themselves; that these groups were at peace with one another. Others claim that it is an attempt to balance the books when positive events occur, attributed to God, by favouring God with a meal, or by fulfilling a vow previously made, as appropriate to the situation; that rehabilitation is achieved and the people restored to perfection (make perfect being a possible meaning of shelamim). In the latter of these possibilities, and partly in the former, the sacrifice is regarded as for God, and hence <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>are</b> merely guests at the meal.|$|E

On 25 November 1891, Beveridge sold his merchandise business, George Griffiths and Co. to David Cohen and Company. Beveridge nevertheless retained his keen interest in the Free Trade movement and in politics generally, including presiding over the election committee for John Neild's unsuccessful bid for the seat of Woollahra at the 1894 election (he lost to Adrian Knox, standing as an 'Independent Free Trade' candidate). George Reid's Free traders were successful at that election and Beveridge, {{in a letter to}} the Sydney Morning Herald, noted: [...] "the vote of last Tuesday must inspire every thinking man in the community with the idea <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>are</b> ripe for the establishment of a progressive policy, and I believe Mr Reid is the man for the hour." ...|$|E
2500|$|There {{are among}} them {{a few things that}} are not {{completely}} worthless. The music is a bit infantile, plain, spirited; but in the end, the people, our Spanish people, are something of all that. I believe <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>are</b> right when they continue to be moved by Córdoba, Mallorca, by the copla of the Sevillanas, by the Serenata, and Granada. In all of them I now note that there is less musical science, less of the grand idea, but more color, sunlight, flavor of olives. That music of youth, with its little sins and absurdities that almost point out the sentimental affectation ... appears to me like the carvings in the Alhambra, those peculiar arabesques that say nothing with their turns and shapes, but which are like the air, like the sun, like the blackbirds or like the nightingales of its gardens. They are more valuable than all else of Moorish Spain, which though we may not like it, is the true Spain.|$|E
2500|$|In 2014, the Chick tract Unforgiven was {{distributed}} by Bible Baptist Church in Garden City, Roanoke, Virginia and drew outrage from the area's Muslim community. The tract {{tells the story}} of an African-American man who, while in prison, is coerced into joining the Islamic faith and changes his name to Muhammad. [...] Upon his release he threatens his Christian grandmother. Hussain Al-Shiblawi, a local man, told WDBJ-TV that he gets pamphlets from the church every Sunday and that they are typically inspirational, but that this one was different. “It basically indicated <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>are</b> violent, the religion itself is violent, and the facts in here are not true,” he said. “It shows him trying to kill his mother saying, ‘If you weren’t my grandma, I’d kill you where you stand, Allahu Akbar.’” In one scene, the grandmother begs Lamont to return to the Christian faith, telling him he’ll “die in [...] sins” and be unforgiven by God if he doesn’t. But the young man isn’t swayed by her pleas. “I choose Muhammad! And I hate your Jesus, your Bible and you!,” he screams. “Get out of my house you infidel!” Bible Baptist Church said the church did not write the tract and simply distributed it.|$|E

2500|$|In 1863, the now Emperor Napoleon III {{began to}} loosen {{some of the}} {{restrictions}} on political opposition. Thiers was encouraged to re-enter political life by his friends, and by a new acquaintance, the Prussian ambassador to Paris, Otto von Bismarck. Thiers {{decided to run for}} election to the Assembly. On 31 May 1863, at the age of sixty-six, he was elected as a deputy for Paris. He returned to the Assembly on 6 November 1863 and took his seat, but found that under Napoleon III the protocol had changed. Instead of speaking from the tribune, members were only allowed to speak from their seats. Thiers was uncomfortable with this way of speaking, and his first few speeches were failures, but he soon mastered the form. On 11 January 1864 he delivered a blistering attack on Napoleon's government, and listed the [...] "necessary liberties" [...] he said were lacking in France: [...] "Security of the citizen against violence from individuals or from the arbitrary use of power; [...] liberty, but not impunity, for the press; free elections; freedom of the people's representatives; [...] and public opinion expressed by the majority guiding the steps of the government. These are the liberties <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>are</b> asking for today; [...] tomorrow, in a tone very different, they may be demanding them."

[...] These principles are human rights-based approach design of their programs, education about rights-based approach, rights to participation, and accountability.

[...] The design of these programs also stresses that the donations are not a gift but rather <b>that</b> <b>the</b> <b>people</b> <b>are</b> finally receiving the human rights treatment they deserve. [...] Education {{of human rights and}} the programs that are being implemented is important.

[...] Education is also to inform the governments, international organizations and donor agencies that are dealing with human rights their roles and responsibilities. [...] Then there is the principle of rights to participation. [...] This deals with the idea that beneficiaries should be included when implementing programs on their behalf. [...] Organizations should include the beneficiaries to help empower. [...] Then there is the principle of accountability which is designed to have standards of human rights and development. [...] It is also designed for NGOs, international organizations, donor agencies and governments to be held to a higher standard of responsibility.|$|E
