5|$|The film {{focuses on}} Malini (Pushpavalli), an impoverished woman who joins her actress friend Sundari's (M. S. Sundari Bai) theatre company Kala Mandhiram {{and becomes a}} success.

5|$|A {{few years}} after {{settling}} down in Berlin, Accum had a house built at 16 Marienstraße (later 21 Marienstraße), where he dwelt until his death. During his last years, he suffered from {{a bad case of}} gout, which ultimately led to his death. His illness took a serious turn for <b>the</b> <b>worse</b> in June 1838, and he rapidly deteriorated. On June 28, approximately 16 years after he return to Germany, Accum {{died at the age of}} 69 in Berlin. He was buried there at the Dorotheenstädtischen Friedhof.|$|E

5|$|Air-landing {{obstacles}} {{were not}} the only tactic Rommel used against aerial invaders. Rommel ordered the flooding of some fields so that glider troops and paratroops landing in the water would drown. He ordered machine gun crews to cover the exits of fields that were bounded by bocage—tall, dense hedgerows—so that glider infantry and paratroopers would come under fire as they moved out of their landing area. The bocage hedgerows themselves were <b>the</b> <b>worse</b> hazard to safe glider landings, and caused more glider casualties than Rommelspargel.|$|E
5|$|Andrić's {{wife died}} on 16 March 1968. His health {{deteriorated}} steadily and he travelled little {{in his final}} years. He continued to write until 1974, when his health took another turn for <b>the</b> <b>worse.</b> In December 1974, he was admitted to a Belgrade hospital. He soon fell into a coma, and died in the Military Medical Academy at 1:15a.m. on 13 March 1975, aged 82. His remains were cremated, and on 24 April, the urn containing his ashes was buried at the Alley of Distinguished Citizens in Belgrade's New Cemetery. The ceremony was attended by about 10,000 residents of Belgrade.|$|E
5|$|As {{with prior}} drafts, {{the team with}} the worst overall record from the {{previous}} season selected first, with teams from the AL and NL alternating picks. If two or more teams had the same record, the team with <b>the</b> <b>worse</b> record from two seasons prior would draft higher. Because the Pittsburgh Pirates of the NL selected first overall in 1986 Major League Baseball Draft, an AL team had the first pick in the 1987 draft. The final two selections in the first round both came from American League teams, as the AL had two more organizations than the NL.|$|E

5|$|By 1976, {{after the}} city's {{residents}} had endured {{a spike in}} crime, overstressed public infrastructure, and an influx of people unfamiliar with Alaska customs, 56 percent said the pipeline had changed Fairbanks for <b>the</b> <b>worse.</b> In downtown Fairbanks, overcrowding, traffic problems, and drunken rambunctiousness caused by pipeline workers pushed businesses to move into malls built away from downtown. New commercial centers like Gavora Mall, Bentley Mall, and others {{away from the city}} center drove the construction of freeways that bypassed downtown Fairbanks.|$|E
5|$|Construction of the {{pipeline}} caused a massive economic boom in towns up and down {{the pipeline}} route. Prior to construction, most residents in towns like Fairbanks—still recovering from the devastating 1967 Fairbanks Flood—strongly supported the pipeline. By 1976, after the town's residents had endured a spike in crime, overstressed public infrastructure, and an influx of people unfamiliar with Alaska customs, 56 percent said the pipeline had changed Fairbanks for <b>the</b> <b>worse.</b> The boom was even greater in Valdez, where the population jumped from 1,350 in 1974 to 6,512 by the summer of 1975 and 8,253 in 1976.|$|E
5|$|Furthermore, the {{political}} climate {{in the aftermath of}} Elagabalus' reign, as well as Dio's own position within the government of Alexander likely influenced the truth of this part of his history for <b>the</b> <b>worse.</b> Dio regularly refers to Elagabalus as Sardanapalus, partly to distinguish him from his divine namesake, but chiefly to do his part in maintaining the damnatio memoriae and to associate him with another autocrat notorious for a dissolute life.|$|E

Overall, they believed the game to be worse than Resident Evil 2, pointing out the game's shorter length, more tedious puzzles, weaker action, and lesser scare factor.|$|E
5|$|In {{comparison}} to the other worlds of the Hainish universe, the relationship between Athshe and the League of Worlds is portrayed as ambiguous. Whereas with planets such as Gethen in The Left Hand of Darkness the integration with the Hainish planets {{is seen as a}} good thing, Athshe is seen as changed for <b>the</b> <b>worse</b> both by the loggers and by being taught to kill their own species. The League eventually decides to isolate Athshe and limit all contact with it, a decision shown to have ambiguous overtones.|$|E

Since Daniloff was not engaged in espionage, Matlock advised taking a hard line with the Soviets. While charges against Daniloff were dropped, a diplomatic row ensued, leading by the end of October, to the expulsion of 100 Soviets, including 80 suspected intelligence officers. The U.S. lost 10 diplomats from Embassy Moscow, along with all 260 of the Russian support staff.|$|E

Andersen got a better-paid job, laying the foundation for the headquarters of Oslo Lysverker, but when that job was done he had to seek day-to-day work at the harbour. After an upturn during the First World War, Norway's financial situation again turned for <b>the</b> <b>worse,</b> no-one would hire a man with an institutional background, and he was out of work. He made a last-ditch attempt to make money, buying liquor in Tønsberg and selling it on the black market in Kristiania, but this was not enough for his wife, who left him to pursue a more financially secure future.|$|E
