5|$|Nash {{caused the}} South Melbourne {{coaching}} staff concern when he fractured two fingers in a match against Hawthorn {{two weeks before}} the final series. Normally this <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>injury</b> would require a player to miss six weeks of football but Nash, who kicked six goals in the match, missed just one week, returned for South's Semi-Final win against Richmond and was considered Best on Ground in South Melbourne's 1933 premiership win. In the Grand Final Nash played at centre-half-back, took thirteen marks and had twenty-nine kicks and dominated play.|$|E

His body was {{recovered}} from Snow's Marsh, located {{on the west side}} of the Cape Fear River. Frank's body had sustained significant injuries, including the amputation of both legs, and debris was embedded in his body. Frank's injuries were significantly different from and much more extensive than the other passengers'. Furthermore, Frank's injuries were inconsistent with the <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>injury</b> usually incurred in an aircraft accident.|$|E

5|$|Cena {{returned}} at WrestleMania 32, helping The Rock {{fend off}} The Wyatt Family. Cena then made his full {{return on the}} Memorial Day edition of Raw on May 30, four months earlier than had been expected for his <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>injury.</b> He was confronted by AJ Styles, only to be betrayed by Styles, who joined his former Club teammates Luke Gallows and Karl Anderson in attacking Cena. This set up a match between Cena and Styles at Money in the Bank, which Styles won with interference from Gallows and Anderson. On the July 4 episode of Raw, Cena was again attacked by the Club, but was saved by Enzo Amore and Big Cass. Subsequently, a six-man tag team match was made between the two teams for Battleground. On July 19 at the 2016 WWE draft, Cena was drafted to the SmackDown brand, while also defeating Club member Luke Gallows via pinfall in a singles contest. Cena, Amore and Cass defeated The Club at Battleground after Cena pinned Styles. Cena continued his feud with Styles, which resulted in him losing their match at SummerSlam on August 21. With Styles later winning the renamed WWE World Championship, Cena challenged him and previous champion Dean Ambrose in a triple threat match for the title at No Mercy. He lost the match after being pinned by Styles, which came after Ambrose and Cena simultaneously made Styles submit, therefore restarting the match. Cena then took a hiatus from WWE to film American Grit season 2.|$|E
5|$|Secondary injury events include {{damage to}} the blood–brain barrier, release of factors that cause inflammation, free radical overload, {{excessive}} release of the neurotransmitter glutamate (excitotoxicity), influx of calcium and sodium ions into neurons, and dysfunction of mitochondria. Injured axons in the brain's white matter may separate from their cell bodies {{as a result of}} secondary injury, potentially killing those neurons. Other factors in secondary injury are changes in the blood flow to the brain; ischemia (insufficient blood flow); cerebral hypoxia (insufficient oxygen in the brain); cerebral edema (swelling of the brain); and raised intracranial pressure (the pressure within the skull). Intracranial pressure may rise due to swelling or a mass effect from a lesion, such as a hemorrhage. As a result, cerebral perfusion pressure (the pressure of blood flow in the brain) is reduced; ischemia results. When the pressure within the skull rises too high, it can cause brain death or herniation, in which parts of the brain are squeezed by structures in the skull. A particularly weak part of the skull that is vulnerable to damage causing extradural haematoma is the pterion, deep in which lies the middle meningeal artery, which is easily damaged in fractures of the pterion. Since the pterion is so weak, this <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>injury</b> can easily occur and can be secondary due to trauma {{to other parts of the}} skull where the impact forces spreads to the pterion.|$|E
25|$|Drugs or toxins {{that have}} a {{pharmacological}} (type A) hepatotoxicity are those that have predictable dose-response curves (higher concentrations cause more liver damage) and well characterized mechanisms of toxicity, such as directly damaging liver tissue or blocking a metabolic process. As {{in the case of}} acetaminophen overdose, this <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>injury</b> occurs shortly after some threshold for toxicity is reached.|$|E

50|$|Tendons {{are subject}} to many <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>{{injuries}}.</b> There are various forms of tendinopathies or tendon injuries due to overuse. These <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>injuries</b> generally result in inflammation and degeneration or weakening of the tendons, which may eventually lead to tendon rupture. Tendinopathies {{can be caused by}} a number of factors relating to the tendon extracellular matrix (ECM), and their classification has been difficult because their symptoms and histopathology often are similar.|$|R
25|$|Idiosyncratic (type B) injury occurs without warning, when agents cause non-predictable {{hepatotoxicity}} in susceptible individuals, {{which is}} not related to dose and has a variable latency period. This <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>injury</b> does not have a clear dose-response nor temporal relationship, and most often does not have predictive models. Idiosyncratic hepatotoxicity has led to the withdrawal of several drugs from market even after rigorous clinical testing as part of the FDA approval process; Troglitazone (Rezulin) and trovafloxacin (Trovan) are two prime examples of idiosyncratic hepatotoxins pulled from market.|$|E
500|$|Conus medullaris {{syndrome}} is {{an injury to}} the end of the spinal cord, located at about the T12–L2 vertebrae in adults. This region contains the S4–S5 spinal segments, responsible for bowel, bladder, and some sexual functions, so these can be disrupted in this <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>injury.</b> [...] In addition, sensation and the Achilles reflex can be disrupted. Causes include tumors, physical trauma, and ischemia.|$|E
500|$|A burn is a <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>injury</b> to [...] skin, {{or other}} tissues, caused by heat, cold, electricity, chemicals, friction, or radiation. Most burns {{are due to}} heat from hot liquids, solids, or fire. While rates are similar {{for males and females}} the {{underlying}} causes often differ. Among women in some areas, risk is related to use of open cooking fires or unsafe cook stoves. Among men, risk is related to the work environments. Alcoholism and smoking are other risk factors. Burns can also occur as a result of self harm or violence between people.|$|E
30|$|The {{mechanisms}} <b>of</b> <b>injury,</b> spectrum <b>of</b> abnormalities and radiological findings {{encountered in}} blunt thoracic trauma are categorised into <b>injuries</b> <b>of</b> the pleural space (pneumothorax, hemothorax), the lungs (pulmonary contusion, laceration and herniation), the airways (tracheobronchial lacerations, Macklin effect), the oesophagus, the heart, the aorta, the diaphragm and the chest wall (rib, scapular, sternal fractures and sternoclavicular dislocations). The possible coexistence <b>of</b> multiple <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>injury</b> {{in a single}} patient is stressed, and therefore systematic exclusion after thorough investigation <b>of</b> all <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>injury</b> is warranted.|$|R

500|$|Although the {{mechanism}} {{is not well}} understood, TBI due to blunt trauma is widely thought {{to be caused by}} any combination of three possible mechanisms: an increase in pressure within the airways, shearing, and pulling apart. The first <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>injury,</b> sometimes called an [...] "explosive rupture", may occur when the chest is violently compressed, for example when a driver strikes the steering wheel in a vehicle accident or when the chest is crushed. The pressure in the airways, especially the larger airways (the trachea and bronchi), quickly rises {{as a result of the}} compression, because the glottis reflexively closes off the airways. When this pressure exceeds the elasticity of the tissues, they burst; thus the membranous part of the trachea is more commonly affected by this mechanism of injury than cartilaginous portions.|$|E

2500|$|Puncture: [...] Sharp object penetrates {{the tissue}} and travels inward, {{but does not}} move {{laterally}} in any direction {{from the point of}} entry. [...] Such wounds can be misleading, as they may appear quite small on surface examination, but extend quite deeply into the body, even damaging nerves, blood vessels, or internal organs. [...] They may cause substantial internal bleeding or secondary injuries, such as a collapsed lung, which may not be readily evident during primary assessment. [...] Occasionally, the object causing the injury remains in the wound as an impaled object. A stab wound from a knife or other sharp object, or a bullet wound, are examples of this <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>injury.</b> [...] Medical professionals usually refer to this type of wound as penetrating trauma.|$|E
2500|$|Head {{trauma is}} {{classified}} as either open or closed head injury. In open head injury [...] the skull is penetrated and brain tissue is destroy in a localized area. Closed head injury is more common, the skull is not penetrated {{but there is an}} impact of the brain against the skull which can create permanent structural damage (e.g. subdural hematoma). With both types, symptoms may disappear or persist over time. [...] It has been found that typically the longer the length of time spent unconscious and the length of post-traumatic amnesia the worse the prognosis for the individual. [...] The cognitive residual symptoms of head trauma are associated with the <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>injury</b> (either open head injury or closed head injury)and the amount of tissue destroyed. Symptoms of closed injury head trauma tend to be the experience of intellectual deficits in abstract reasoning ability, judgement, and memory, and also marked personality changes.
