5|$|In short, had Mr. Boulton {{done nothing}} more in <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>than</b> he has {{accomplished}} {{in improving the}} coinage, his name would deserve to be immortalised; and if it be considered that this {{was done in the}} midst of various other important avocations, and at enormous expense,— for which, at the time, he could have had no certainty of an adequate return,—we shall be at a loss whether most to admire his ingenuity, his perseverance, or his munificence. He has conducted the whole more like a sovereign than a private manufacturer; and the love of fame has always been to him a greater stimulus than the love of gain. Yet it is to be hoped that, even in the latter point of view, the enterprise answered its purpose.|$|E

25|$|Some {{historians and}} admirers of Patel such as Rajendra Prasad, the first President of India and {{industrialist}} J. R. D. Tata have expressed {{the opinion that}} Patel {{would have made a}} better prime minister for India than Nehru. These admirers and Nehru's critics cite Nehru's belated embrace of Patel's advice regarding the UN and Kashmir and the integration of Goa by military action and Nehru's rejection of Patel's advice on China. Proponents of free enterprise cite the failings of Nehru's socialist policies as opposed to Patel's defence of property rights and his mentorship of what was to be later known as the Amul co-operative project. However, A. G. Noorani, in comparing Nehru and Patel, writes that Nehru had a broader understanding of <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>than</b> Patel.|$|E
25|$|In April 2011, the United States Department of Energy {{published}} {{projections of}} the radiation risks {{over the next year}} (that is, for the future) for people living in the neighborhood of the plant. Potential exposure could exceed 20mSv/year (2 rems/year) in some areas up to 50kilometers from the plant. That is the level at which relocation would be considered in the USA, and it is a level that could cause roughly one extra cancer case in 500 young adults. However, natural radiation levels are higher in some parts of <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>than</b> the projected level mentioned above, and about 4 people out of 10 can be expected to develop cancer without exposure to radiation. Further, the radiation exposure resulting from the incident for most people living in Fukushima is so small compared to background radiation that it may be impossible to find statistically significant evidence of increases in cancer.|$|E

Eventually, Marie came to believe that she and Ferdinand were [...] "the best associates, the most loyal companions, but our lives intertwine only in certain matters". Ferdinand enjoyed Marie's presence during military marches and consequently, she was frequently invited to this sort of event.|$|E

Blaming Serbia for the attack, Austria-Hungary declared war a month later, initiating World War I. Shortly after the assassination, Stojanović wrote in his notebook a quote from Giuseppe Mazzini: [...] "There is no more sacred thing in <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>than</b> the duty of a conspirator, who becomes an avenger of humanity and the apostle of permanent natural laws."

I always felt it fell between two stories, Jim wanted it to be one thing and I wanted it to be about something else."

[...] Like Tell All Your Friends, the album's song titles were gleaned primarily from TV. The title of [...] "Bonus Mosh Pt.

He attacked the US more generally, asserting that it had committed more [...] "unspeakable atrocities" [...] across <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>than</b> any other nation, citing the atomic bombing of Japan; this attracted international controversy, although he later improved his relationship with Blair.

500|$|Many {{directors}} have listed {{it as one}} of the greatest films ever made, including Woody Allen, Michael Apted, Les Blank, Kenneth Branagh, Paul Greengrass, Michel Hazanavicius, Michael Mann, Sam Mendes, Jiri Menzel, Paul Schrader, Martin Scorsese, Denys Arcand, Gillian Armstrong, John Boorman, Roger Corman, Alex Cox, Milos Forman, Norman Jewison, Richard Lester, Richard Linklater, Paul Mazursky, Ronald Neame, Sydney Pollack and Stanley Kubrick. Yasujirō Ozu said it was his favorite non-Japanese film and was impressed by its techniques. François Truffaut said that the film [...] "has inspired more vocations to cinema throughout <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>than</b> any other" [...] and recognized its influence in The Barefoot Contessa, Les Mauvaises Rencontres, Lola Montès, and 8 1/2. Truffaut's Day for Night pays tribute to the film in a dream sequence depicting a childhood memory of the character played by Truffaut stealing publicity photos from the film. Numerous film {{directors have}} cited the film as influential on their own films, including Theo Angelopoulos, Luc Besson, the Coen brothers, Francis Ford Coppola, Brian De Palma, John Frankenheimer, Stephen Frears, Sergio Leone, Michael Mann, Ridley Scott, Martin Scorsese, Bryan Singer and Steven Spielberg. Ingmar Bergman disliked the film and called it [...] "a total bore. Above all, the performances are worthless. The amount of respect that movie has is absolutely unbelievable!" ...|$|E
500|$|In a twist from expectation, Eliot's poem {{suggests}} that old men {{should go out}} and explore. He warns that people should trade wisdom for pointless experience and argues that men should explore human experience itself. This concept is hinted of in The Waste Land and draws from the ideas within Dante's Convivio. Dante argues that old men are supposed to return to God and describes the process in a way similar to the travels of Odysseus. Unlike Homer's hero, Dante argues that men should not travel in the material world but in the spiritual world. Both Dante and Eliot put forth a similar view to St. Augustine when they focus on internal travels. Through these travels, mankind is able to have faith in salvation and {{able to see that}} there is more to <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>than</b> darkness. Eliot explains within the poem that we are all interconnected through time and that we must realize this. Only through this realization is mankind able to understand the truth of the universe. This, in turn, would allow humanity to break free from the burden of time. As Russel Kirk explains: [...] "That end, for those who apprehend a reality superior to 'birth, copulation, and death'—a reality transcending the rhythms of physical nature—is to know God and enjoy Him forever." ...|$|E
500|$|By {{the first}} decade of the 18th century, the once-prosperous Safavid realm was in a state of heavy decline, with insurrections in {{numerous}} parts of its domains. The king, Sultan Husayn, was a weak ruler, and although personally inclined to be more humane, flexible, and relaxed than his chief mullah, he went along with the recommendations of his advisers regarding important state decisions. He reigned as a [...] "stationary monarch", preferring, apart from the occasional hunting party, to be inside or near the capital of Isfahan at all times, invisible to all [...] "but the most intimate of courtiers". Having seen not much more of <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>than</b> the harem walls, he had quickly fallen under the spell of the leading ulama, most notably Mohammad-Baqer Majlesi. Majlesi, who had already gained considerable political power during the reign of Sultan Husayn's predecessor SuleimanI ( [...] 1666–1694), instigated the persecutions directed towards Safavid Iran's Sunni and Sufi inhabitants, as well as its non-Muslim religious minorities, namely Christians, Jews, and Zoroastrians. Though the Christians, mainly represented by the Armenians, suffered less than other groups, they were also targeted from time to time. As Prof.Roger Savory states, even though Sultan Husayn did not show personal hostility towards Christians, he was persuaded by the clergy (Majlisi in particular), who had great influence over him, to issue [...] "unjust and intolerant decrees". The tense religious atmosphere in the late Safavid era would prove to be a significant factor in the revolts by Sunni adherents from various places within the empire. As Prof.Michael Axworthy notes: [...] "The clearest example was the revolt in Shirvan, where Sunni religious men had been killed, religious books destroyed and Sunni mosques turned into stables".|$|E
