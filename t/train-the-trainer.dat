S. dental schools through an admissions commit-tee development program. With funding provided by the Pipeline, Profession, and Practice: Community-Based Dental Education program and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, ten dental directors/deans of admissions from a cross-section of U. S. dental schools were selected through a competitive application process {{to participate in a}} <b>Train-the-Trainers</b> Admissions Committee Workshop. After completing intensive training that was built on legally sound admissions practices, these new trainers copre-sented ADEA Admissions Committee Workshops in two-member teams at six U. S. dental schools. This report summarizes the evaluation of both the <b>train-the-trainers</b> workshop and six workshops held in summer 2009.

30|$|Figure  1 {{also makes}} {{transparent}} {{the complexity of}} taking effective PD programs to scale. Often discussions about “going to scale” are framed by numbers, as {{in the number of}} teachers that will be “touched” and the number of personnel that are needed to be trained so that they, in turn, can train others (e.g., the <b>train-the-trainers</b> approach). Such discussions are often silent with respect to the substance of what must be learned at different layers of the system. Cast within a teaching and learning approach, Fig.  1 shows the complexity of the content to be learned, the amount of which rapidly increases as you move up the layers. For example, in the top layer, researchers/designers support facilitators to learn the substance in layer 1 (what effective math and science teaching and learning looks like in the classroom) and in layer 2 (how to work with teachers-as-learners to improve what they do in the classroom). This represents a steep learning curve for most researchers/designers as well as the facilitators. All of this suggests the importance of keeping a learning perspective on issues related to scale because it requires us to think carefully and conceptually about the requirements—many of which may be hidden from view—of rapidly expanding an effective PD program.|$|R
40|$|Objectives. Studies {{have shown}} that {{healthcare}} personnel hesitate to perform defibrillation due to individual or organisational attitudes. We aimed to assess trainers’ attitudes towards cardiopulmonary resuscitation and defibrillation (CPR-D), Current Care Guidelines, and associated training. Methods. A questionnaire was distributed to CPR trainers attending seminars in Finland (N= 185) focusing on the updated national Current Care Guidelines 2011. The questions were answered using Likert scale (1 = totally disagree, 7 = totally agree). Factor loading of the questionnaire was made using maximum likelihood analysis and varimax rotation. Seven scales were constructed (Hesitation, Nurse’s Role, Nontechnical Skill, Usefulness, Restrictions, Personal, and Organisation). Cronbach’s alphas were 0. 92 – 0. 51. Statistics were Student’s t-test, ANOVA, stepwise regression analysis, and Pearson Correlation. Results. The questionnaire was returned by 124 / 185, 67 % CPR trainers, of whom two-thirds felt that their undergraduate training in CPR-D had not been adequate. Satisfaction with undergraduate defibrillation training correlated with the Nontechnical Skills scale (p< 0. 01). Participants scoring high on Hesitation scale (p< 0. 01) were less confident about their Nurse’s Role (p< 0. 01) and Nontechnical Skills (p< 0. 01). Conclusion. Quality of undergraduate education affects the work of CPR trainers and some feel uncertain of defibrillation. The <b>train-the-trainers</b> courses and undergraduate medical education should focus more on practical scenarios with defibrillators and nontechnical skills...|$|R

40|$|Creative {{problem solving}} (CPS) is an {{approach}} for identifying {{solutions to problems}} within a structured, facilitated process. In the current studies, CPS was customized for general education intervention (GEI) teams in elementary schools. In the first study, 24 GEI teams were randomly assigned either to a CPS for GEI training condition or to a control group. Team outcome measures were tracked {{over the course of}} a school year, and the CPS for GEI teams consistently demonstrated superior perfor-mance relative to controls across all measures. One year later, a second study investigated 2 approaches to delivering training in CPS for GEI teams. Five teams received CPS for GEI training directly from university-based staff, and 9 teams received training from employees in their district who had previously received CPS for GEI training from the university-based staff (a “train-the-trainers” approach). Schools receiving training from their own staff per-formed as well as the independently trained schools, thereby providing support for the <b>train-the-trainers</b> approach.

40|$|Latin America is {{characterized}} by ethnic, geographical, cultural, and economic diversity; therefore, training in gastroenterology in the region {{must be considered in}} this context. The continent&#x 2019;s medical education {{is characterized}} by a lack of standards and the volume of research continues to be relatively small. There is a multiplicity of events in general gastroenterology and in sub-disciplines, both at regional and local levels, which ensure that many colleagues have access to information. Medical education programs must be based on a clinical vision and be considered in close contact with the patients. The programs should be properly supervised, appropriately defined, and evaluated on a regular basis. The disparity between the patients&#x 2019; needs, the scarce resources available, and the pressures exerted by the health systems on doctors are frequent cited by those complaining of poor professionalism.

40|$|It {{has been}} my great {{privilege}} and honor to have served as President of the World Gastroenterology Organisation over the past 4 years and to have attempted {{to follow in the}} footsteps of my eminent predecessors and mentors, Guido Tytgat and Meinhard Classen. Thanks to their stewardship and the wise management of our finances by Joseph Geenen, my colleagues and I inherited an organization that was financially sound and whose governance was on a firm footing, ably supported by Bridget Barbieri and her staff at Medconnect. In 2005, therefore, we had an opportunity to expand the activities of WGO. Recognizing the organization’s limited resources, we decided to concentrate on training and education. Furthermore, aware of the special needs of those areas of the world where gastroenterology is poorly developed, we sought to concentrate our efforts considerably, though not exclusively, on such areas. To serve these goals, we next came to define the Training Centers, the <b>Train-the-Trainers</b> (TTT) programs, the International Digestive Cancer Alliance, and our Global Guidelines as our flagship educational programs and sought to establish cohesion between them in order to pursue our central mission—training and education in gastroenterology. Other supporting projects were developed or enhanced: the WGO website, World Gastroenterology News, the WGO e-newsletter, the “Ask a Librarian ” service and, most recently, the tremendously successful World Digestive Health Day—each and every one of these activities promoting our message and disseminating important information on digestive health and disease worldwide.

40|$|The {{events of}} fall 2001, {{including}} the anthrax attacks and {{the thousands of}} biologic threats and hoaxes, required law enforcement, other public safety organizations, and public health agencies {{to work together in}} ways without precedent. The concurrent responses to such threats affirmed the many similarities in the goals and investigative methods used by both law enforcement and public health officials but also highlighted salient differences in the different disciplines 22 ̆ 0 ac 2 ̆ 122 approaches. To foster improved understanding of the investigative goals and methods specific to each discipline and to strengthen interdisciplinary collaborative effectiveness in response to future attacks involving biological agents, in the spring of 2002 the Public Health Law Program of the U. S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in partnership with other agencies and organizations undertook the development of a module for the joint training of law enforcement and public health officials. As noted above, a primary goal for the training module is to enhance the joint effectiveness of law enforcement and public health when both disciplines conduct concurrent investigations in response to a threat or attack involving possible biological weapons. The module addresses this goal by bringing law enforcement and public health officials together while working through fact-based case scenarios involving biological weapons attacks or threats. The module 22 ̆ 0 ac 2 ̆ 122 s centerpiece is a set of three fact-based case scenarios worked through by small groups. The small groups, which include equal numbers of law enforcement and public health officials, address key objectives by reviewing sets of facts, and then by answering questions matched to the objectives. The objectives span a spectrum of issues, including, for example: conducting epidemiological investigations and public health responses in the setting of a crime scene; meshing criminal investigative procedures with epidemiological, laboratory, and other scientific procedures in such settings; and joint law enforcement and public health operations and communications. In addition to improving understanding of relevant laws, approaches, and procedures, the module 22 ̆ 0 ac 2 ̆ 122 s delivery is designed to increase participants 22 ̆ 0 ac 2 ̆ 122 familiarity with their law enforcement and public health counterparts in their home jurisdictions.
