5000|$|The idea Dickinson {{conveyed}} above, explains University of Montana Law Professor Jeffrey T. Renz, is that taxing for {{the general}} welfare is but taxation {{as a means of}} regulating commerce. Renz expands upon this point: If we excise [...] "general welfare" [...] from the <b>Tax</b> <b>Clause,</b> we are presented with the claim that Congress may not levy duties for purposes other than paying the debts and providing for the common defense. Indeed, omitting the general welfare phrase would eliminate nearly all duties for regulatory purposes. A strong argument could be made that while Congress might have the power to regulate foreign and interstate commerce, the omission of [...] "general welfare" [...] from the <b>Tax</b> <b>Clause</b> was intended to deny it the power to regulate commerce by means of duties.|$|E

40|$|This article, {{prepared}} for a symposium at the Salmon P. Chase College of Law, Northern Kentucky University, considers whether the <b>Taxing</b> <b>Clause</b> provides an alternative constitutional basis, as some have recently argued, for the individual mandate in the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 21 - the requirement, going into effect in 214, that most individuals acquire satisfactory health insurance or pay a penalty. The article concludes that the <b>Taxing</b> <b>Clause</b> arguments are misguided. At best, the Clause can provide authority for the penalty, not for the mandate as a whole. Furthermore, the article questions whether the penalty will be a tax at all - if not, the <b>Taxing</b> <b>Clause</b> is obviously irrelevant - or, if {{it will be a}} tax, whether constitutional limitations on the taxing power will be satisfied. In particular, the article takes seriously whether the penalty might be a capitation tax, a form of direct tax that would have to meet an onerous apportionment rule to be valid. And the article argues that the penalty will not be a “tax on incomes” exempted from apportionment by the Sixteenth Amendment. The bottom line is this: relying on the <b>Taxing</b> <b>Clause</b> makes the analysis of the individual mandate more complicated than it needs to be, and the focus of constitutional analysis should return to where it has always belonged: the Commerce Clause...|$|R
40|$|The {{idea has}} gained {{currency}} that the <b>Taxing</b> <b>Clause</b> in the Constitution gives Congress {{the power to}} do anything, or almost anything, that would be funded by taxation. Most recently, that argument has been advanced in connection with the litigation about the individual mandate in the Obamacare legislation — by, among others, legal philosopher Ronald Dworkin. If the penalty for failure to acquire suitable insurance will be a tax, then, it is argued, the requirement to acquire insurance, the mandate, will itself be a valid exercise of the taxing power. If that’s right, it certainly isn’t obviously so. Since almost everything the national government does is funded through taxation, that understanding would lead to a conception of congressional power that is effectively unlimited, and the <b>Taxing</b> <b>Clause</b> would trump almost all other grants of congressional power in Article I, section 8...|$|R

40|$|The {{proposals}} seem to {{have fallen}} by the wayside by mid- 2009, but {{earlier in the year}} Congress seriously considered imposing a “tax” of up to 90 percent on bonuses received by employees (and former employees) of AIG and other entities that had benefited significantly from Troubled Asset Relief Program funds. (Indeed, the House actually passed one proposal, which would have imposed a levy on only this discrete group of taxpayers and that would have applied to only this one category of income.) This article considers whether such a levy, applicable at a nearly confiscatory rate, would be constitutional. The article concludes that, if the levy were to derive its authority only from the <b>Taxing</b> <b>Clause</b> - if, that is, no other provision in the Constitution such as the Commerce Clause would give Congress authority - the levy would be constitutionally suspect.

40|$|This {{chapter in}} a {{forthcoming}} book on NFIB v. Sebelius asks whether the {{various parts of}} Chief Justice Roberts’s opinion on the minimum coverage provision are legally justifiable. I focus on what Roberts decided, not why he decided it that way. Law is fully adequate to explain the Chief Justice’s vote to uphold the minimum coverage provision as {{within the scope of}} Congress’s tax power. Roberts embraced the soundest constitutional understanding of the <b>Taxing</b> <b>Clause.</b> He also showed fidelity to the law by applying—and not just giving lip service to—the deeply entrenched presumption of constitutionality that judges are supposed to apply when federal laws are challenged on federalism grounds. Robert’s opinion was unpersuasive in concluding that the minimum coverage provision was beyond the scope of the Commerce and Necessary and Proper Clauses. Roberts failed to apply the modern doctrine of “constitutional avoidance,” thereby needlessly deciding these questions. What is more, he decided them wrongly. Fortunately, the doctrinal consequences of this portion of his opinion will likely (although by no means certainly) prove insignificant. In the final part of this chapter, I move from the internal perspective of the faithful legal practitioner to the external perspective of the system analyst. I ask what Roberts may have accomplished in responding to NFIB as he did. By prohibiting Congress from requiring Americans to purchase products against their will, Roberts partially expressed new popular and professional constitutional arguments—arguments developed by those who had mobilized against the prevailing view among legal experts that the minimum coverage provision is constitutional. By upholding the minimum coverage provision under the <b>Taxing</b> <b>Clause,</b> he validated the values of the ACA’s supporters and respected the post-New Deal convention that the Court should uphold momentous social welfare legislation. By partially validating the sincerely held moral beliefs of both sides, Roberts may have succeeded in sustaining some measure of social solidarity amidst intense disagreement over health care reform, thereby enhancing the public legitimacy of constitutional law. Roberts {{may or may not have}} intended to practice judicial statesmanship, and his statesmanship may not be enough to justify his contradictions of sound legal reasoning. But statesmanship probably provides the most persuasive way to try to justify his analyses of the Commerce and Necessary and Proper Clauses. Such a defense, however, would require the application of criteria that are difficult to justify as legal from the internal point of view...|$|R

40|$|In {{this thesis}} the {{taxation}} of North Sea oil {{is found to}} deter oilfield investment substantiaty - investment which it pursued would bring about Pareto benefits. Analysis of both the comparative static tax effects and the dynamics of taxation on oilfield development decisions reveals {{the nature of the}} deterrent, while a specially developed econometric model is used to quantify the impact of the tax structure and of tax changes on recoverable reserves. By detailing the mechanisms through which taxation distorts the allocation of investment resources away from North Sea developments, the thesis stresses that individual <b>tax</b> <b>clauses</b> tend not to perform the roles allotted to them and that tax changes alter the economics of oil projects in ways and in magnitudes that {{do not seem to be}} realised. Hence, not only is the nature of these effects misunderstood, but the extent oi these effects is much more damaging than commonly appreciated. These findings are reached by following the principles laid out in the early chapters which suggest that, if an improvement in the allocation of resources is to occur, laise beliets must be reclined. In particular, the inconsistencies between the targets and instruments of North Sea policy suggest there are false beliets about the need to stimulate development decisions and about the role of taxation - suggestions which are confirmed in the detailed research of the thesis. Having condemned existing North Sea oil tax policy, a practical, feasible and attainable alternative to the current tax system, that would not distort investment decisions so severely, is recommended...|$|R
40|$|This essay, a {{contribution}} to a fall symposium at the Oklahoma City University law school, examines the Supreme Court's Commerce Clause jurisprudence {{in light of the}} Supreme Court's decision last Term in United States v. Morrison. Morrison found unconstitutional the Violence Against Women Act because its reach exceeded that permitted to the federal government under Article I, Section 8 of the Constitution. We argue that the Court's restrictions on the commerce power, while certainly a departure from previous directions in the federalism area, alone present no drastic or revolutionary limitations on the federal government's ability to achieve its policies. Some might fear that Morrison will prevent Congress from using the Commerce Clause to reach noncommercial, intrastate activity. Other powers, however, such as the Spending and <b>Taxing</b> <b>Clauses,</b> provide Congress with alternative opportunities to reach beyond the new restrictions on the Commerce Clause. Even the Court's current pronouncements on the Commerce Clause provide Congress with ample power to reach a great deal of conduct. Due to the national integration of the economy and society, the channels and instrumentalities prongs of the Commerce Clause provide substantial authority to establish uniform federal rules over a vast amount of noncommercial conduct. Even if Congress wishes to intrude even further into intrastate activity, the Court's effort to impose the barrier at economic activity may prove sufficiently permeable to allow federal jurisdiction over most things that Congress would want to regulate. If the Court intends to impose serious restraints on Congress, its recent efforts in the Commerce Clause area can only be the early steps...|$|R

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is the {{analysis}} of some important clauses inserted in the Portuguese corporate income tax (CIT) code and how they can be a source of divergence between reported earnings and taxable income. Additionally, the paper also discusses if these clauses are a source of management flexibility in reporting earnings, even if it means paying higher taxes. Design/methodology/approach – The approach taken in this paper is based on a branch of legal research methodology. The paper uses applied legal research, exploring two avenues. One is based on the recognition that it is usually not possible to arrive at the correct interpretation of the law only by pure deductive reasoning, because hard cases' outcomes tend to form a body of jurisprudence that affects the application of legal rules. Verbal interpretation and manipulation of law usually give rise to contradictory outcomes from apparently identical situations. The approach is also based on macro tax data, in order to present some empirical evidence of hypothesized management behavior. Findings – The paper finds that ambiguity in CIT laws induces a type of management behaviour characterised by minimizing tax liabilities estimates. Portuguese corporate tax returns show an improbable low level of adjustments related to clauses where flexibility in the timing of cost deduction is an option. Originality/value – The paper adds to the body of literature that analyses the relation between the level of ambiguity and uncertainty in tax laws and its impact on managers' decisions, particularly about reported income, and presents some supportive evidence of the hypothesized behaviour. It is useful for managers, tax authorities and tax courts, by discussing the relation between the nature of <b>tax</b> <b>clauses</b> and management behaviour...|$|R
