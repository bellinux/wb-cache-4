5|$|Local people {{sometimes}} take pups for the exotic pet <b>trade</b> <b>or</b> as pets for themselves, but the animal rapidly grows to become unmanageable. Duplaix relates {{the story of}} an Arawak Indian who took two pups from their parents. While revealing of the affection held for the animals, the seizure was a profound blow to the breeding pair, which went on to lose their territory to competitors.|$|E

5|$|Rothbard {{accepted}} the Labor theory of property, but rejected the Lockean proviso, arguing {{that if an}} individual mixes his labor with unowned land then he becomes the proper owner eternally, and that after that time it is private property which may change hands only by <b>trade</b> <b>or</b> gift.|$|E

5|$|Haywood was an {{advocate}} of industrial unionism, a labor philosophy that favors organizing all workers in an industry under one union, regardless of the specific <b>trade</b> <b>or</b> skill level; this was {{in contrast to the}} craft unions that were prevalent at the time, such as the AFL. His belief that workers of all ethnicities should be united also clashed with many unions. His preference for direct action over political tactics alienated him from the Socialist Party leadership and contributed to his recall from the party's executive committee in 1913.|$|E
5|$|Historians {{debate whether}} early modern {{individuals}} experienced {{a period of}} youth in the modern sense. For many the early teens were marked by moving away from home to undertake life-cycle service, which was necessary {{so that they could}} build up skills and capital that would enable them to marry and create a separate household. Lower down in society boys might be apprenticed to a <b>trade,</b> <b>or</b> become agricultural servants. Girls might go into domestic or agricultural service. For those higher up in society and increasingly for those lower down, this might be after a period of schooling or even university.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to terraforming, optimizing individual base performance and building secret projects, players may also benefit their factions through social engineering, probe teams, and diplomacy. Social engineering modifies the ideologically based bonuses and penalties {{forced by the}} player's choice of faction. Probe teams can sabotage and steal information, units, technology, and energy from enemy bases, while diplomacy lets the player create coalitions with other factions. It also allows the <b>trade</b> <b>or</b> transfer of units, bases, technology and energy. The Planetary Council, similar to the United Nations Security Council, takes Planet-wide actions and determines population victories.|$|E

5|$|One {{of the key}} {{contributors}} to globalization was the Triangular Trade and how it connected the world. The Triangular <b>Trade</b> <b>or</b> Triangle Trade was a system used to connect three {{areas of the world}} through trade. Once traded, items and goods were shipped {{to other parts of the}} world, making the triangle trade a key to global trade. The Triangle Trade system was run by Europeans, increasing their global power.|$|E
5|$|Religion in China {{during this}} period had a great effect on people's lives, beliefs, and daily activities, and Chinese {{literature}} on spirituality was popular. The major deities of Daoism and Buddhism, ancestral spirits, and the many deities of Chinese folk religion were worshipped with sacrificial offerings. Tansen Sen asserts that more Buddhist monks from India travelled to China during the Song {{than in the previous}} Tang dynasty (618–907). With many ethnic foreigners travelling to China to conduct <b>trade</b> <b>or</b> live permanently, there came many foreign religions; religious minorities in China included Middle Eastern Muslims, the Kaifeng Jews, and Persian Manichaeans.|$|E

5|$|Sercey's {{campaign}} had ended in failure, with little disruption to British <b>trade</b> <b>or</b> naval {{operations in the}} East Indies. The East India Company had however taken more serious losses from the depredations of privateers. Most active was Robert Surcouf, whose small ship Emilie captured the timber ship Penguin off Pegu in October 1795 and country ships Russell, Sambolasse and Diana off {{the mouth of the}} Hooghly River in January 1796. More seriously, he also captured the pilot boat Cartier, which he used to seize the large East Indiaman Triton.|$|E
5|$|Swahili coastal {{settlements}} frequently conducted {{trade with}} the interior, obtaining goods for overseas <b>trade</b> <b>or</b> local consumption. However, isolated and small settlements have been interpreted as hinterlands that developed around and supported the economies of the larger settlements. Small settlements or hamlets were established between the fourteenth and sixteenth centuries within the vicinity of Gedi including sites {{at the end of}} Mida Creek, Kiburugeni, Watamu, Shaka, and Kilepwa. These smaller settlements are thought to represent agricultural communities that provided Gedi with most of its agricultural produce.|$|E
5|$|The company's ship-naming policy {{throughout}} its 87-year period of operations {{was to use}} its home port's name plus a suffix word, often a <b>trade</b> <b>or</b> occupation. The most frequently used name was Manchester Trader, applied to six different vessels between 1898 and cessation of operations in 1985. Some names used appropriately during the First World War, such as Manchester Hero, Manchester Brigade and Manchester Division were not reused after the disposal or loss of those vessels. Some ships operated short-term or on charter retained their original names and did not receive the Manchester prefix.|$|E

5|$|The {{siliquae}} in the Hoard {{were struck}} mainly at Western mints in Gaul and Italy. It is unknown {{whether this is}} because coins from further East rarely reached Britain through <b>trade,</b> <b>or</b> because the Eastern mints rarely struck siliquae. The production of coins seems to follow {{the location of the}} Imperial court at the time; for instance, the concentration of Trier coins is much greater after 367, perhaps associated with Gratian moving his court to Trier.|$|E
5|$|At the 1906 election, Deakin {{remained}} Prime Minister {{even though}} Labour gained considerably more seats than the Protectionists. When Watson resigned in 1907, Fisher succeeded him as Labour leader, although Hughes and William Spence also stood for the position. Fisher {{was considered to}} {{have a better understanding of}} economic matters, was better at handling caucus, had better relations with the party organisation and the unions, and was more in touch with party opinion. He did not share Hughes' passion for free <b>trade</b> <b>or</b> that of Watson and Hughes for defence (and later conscription). In political terms he was a radical, on the left-wing of his party, with a strong sense of Labour's part in British working-class history.|$|E

In 1691, Brandenburg-Prussia and the Duchy of Courland agreed on a partition of Tobago, but since Courland was no longer present on the island which was meanwhile claimed by England, the agreement was nullified, and negotiations with England {{did not result in}} an agreement. In 1695, Brandenburg-Prussia tried {{to get a hold of}} Tortola, but England denied them settlement. Likewise, England declined an offer to purchase Sint Eustatius in 1697.|$|E
