5|$|During the innings, Bill Edrich was on four when he edged Ray Lindwall to Johnson {{at first}} slip. Johnson got both hands <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> above his head, but dropped it. However, the dropped catch was not costly, as Edrich was {{dismissed}} for 18.|$|E
5|$|After {{the success}} of Take Me Out <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Ball</b> Game, Freed gave Donen and Kelly the chance to direct On the Town, {{released}} in 1949. The film was an adaptation of the Betty Comden and Adolph Green Broadway musical about sailors on leave in New York City {{and was the first}} musical to be filmed on location. Donen and Kelly had wanted to shoot the entire film in New York, but Freed would only allow them to spend one week away from the studio.|$|E
5|$|As the goalkeeper has {{the choice}} of how many hands they want to use, the {{decision}} should be made {{of what they want}} to do. A shot should be stopped with two hands either if it is weak or close to the goalkeeper's body, and normally stopped with one in other circumstances. This is because one-handed saves can go <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> faster.|$|E
5000|$|Tactical (<b>to</b> help <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> carrier, <b>to</b> get <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> back, <b>to</b> offer support, <b>to</b> pass <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> {{and follow}} <b>the</b> pass, {{positioning}} {{and the movement}} into space) ...|$|R
25|$|Other than <b>the</b> ability <b>to</b> land <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> on a {{strategically}} optimum {{line and}} length, the main weapons of the bowler are his ability <b>to</b> move <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> sideways as it approaches the batsman {{and his ability}} <b>to</b> deliver <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> at a high velocity.|$|R
25|$|Upon {{impacting}} the ground, some translational {{kinetic energy}} {{can be converted}} to rotational kinetic energy and vice-versa depending on <b>the</b> <b>ball's</b> impact angle and angular velocity. If <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> moves horizontally at impact, friction will have a 'translational' component in <b>the</b> direction opposite <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>ball's</b> motion. In <b>the</b> figure, <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> is moving <b>to</b> <b>the</b> right, and thus it will have a translational component of friction pushing <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> left. Additionally, if <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> is spinning at impact, friction will have a 'rotational' component in <b>the</b> direction opposite <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>ball's</b> rotation. On <b>the</b> figure, <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> is spinning clockwise, and the point impacting the ground is moving <b>to</b> <b>the</b> left with respect <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>ball's</b> center of mass. The rotational component of friction is therefore pushing <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> right. Unlike the normal force and the force of gravity, these frictional forces will exert a torque on <b>the</b> <b>ball,</b> and change its angular velocity (omega&).|$|R
5|$|If a ball travels {{outside of}} the playing area, play is {{restarted}} by possession being awarded to the opponents of the team which last touched the ball, unless the ball goes out of bounds due to a shot or a deflected shot. In that case, possession is awarded to the player that is closest <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> when it leaves the playing area.|$|E
5|$|There {{are also}} {{gameplay}} issues when the player takes {{their turn to}} bat. The AI is not developed and, when the player hits a pitch, it nearly always takes the longest possible route <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>ball,</b> making runs easier to score. It also lacks the capability to throw out a runner who is returning to a base (instead of advancing) or perform a double play after catching a fly ball. Furthermore, the batter can only move vertically, not horizontally, in the batter's box.|$|E
5|$|After {{his success}} in Belgium with Gent, Mido signed a five-year {{contract}} with Eredivisie team Ajax in 2001. He suffered a concussion during their UEFA Cup match with Limassol, after colliding with a defender. He made his return for the team against Heerenveen, a match which Ajax lost 5–1. However, he was sent off against Twente, after kicking Spira Grujić whilst trying to beat him <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>ball,</b> {{for which he was}} later given a three-match ban. He returned for Ajax against Vitesse, coming on as a substitute in the 75th minute. He failed to be selected for the substitutes bench against Feyenoord in March 2002, which was due to a minor clash with manager Ronald Koeman, and Mido left for a short vacation in Cairo. Mido scored in Ajax's victory over Utrecht in the KNVB Cup final, meaning he ended the 2001–02 season with the Dutch League and Cup double.|$|E
50|$|Once <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> {{is out of}} the hot, the hotwatches (scrum-halves) try <b>to</b> get <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> past <b>the</b> hot, either <b>to</b> kick <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> into Worms, or <b>to</b> kick <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> into Ropes. Alternatively, {{they can}} choose <b>to</b> knock <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> {{backwards}} <b>to</b> a better placed 'kick', remembering that the kick must play <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> down. If at any stage during <b>the</b> game <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> enters Ropes, it is usually the job of <b>the</b> hot <b>to</b> go in and retrieve it, by getting the other hot out of the way.|$|R
50|$|The {{disadvantage}} of {{round the corner}} may be {{that it is more}} difficult <b>to</b> aim <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> especially when kicking {{from the side of the}} field, this requires greater accuracy <b>to</b> get <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> between <b>the</b> poles.Players using this method do carefully measured steps to put them in <b>the</b> right position <b>to</b> kick <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> in <b>the</b> desired direction.|$|R
50|$|As {{a result}} of the {{strategy}} employed by the Blue Bombers, in which they voluntarily conceded safeties <b>to</b> keep <b>the</b> <b>ball,</b> <b>the</b> rules were changed for the following 1966 CFL season. Teams scored against on a safety touch would no longer be entitled <b>to</b> keep <b>the</b> <b>ball.</b> Instead, they would be forced <b>to</b> kick <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> away <b>to</b> <b>the</b> other team.|$|R
5|$|After the break, Morris added 37 runs in 14 {{minutes from}} a series of Compton full tosses and long hops, while Bradman had only added three. This {{prompted}} Yardley to take the new ball. Bradman reached 50 in 60 minutes and then aimed a drive from Ken Cranston, but sliced it in the air to point. Yardley dived and got his hands <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>ball,</b> but failed to hold on. Australia reached 202—halfway to the required total—with 165 minutes left, after Morris dispatched consecutive full tosses from Laker. Bradman then hooked two boundaries, but suffered a fibrositis attack, which put him in significant pain. Drinks were then taken, and Morris had to farm the strike until Bradman's pain had subsided. Australia then reached 250 shortly before tea with Morris on 133 and Bradman on 92. Bradman then reached his century in 147 minutes as the second-wicket stand passed 200.|$|E
5|$|As a player, Shearer {{was often}} styled {{as a classic}} English centre-forward, owing to his strength, {{physical}} stature, heading ability and strong shot, which enabled him to be highly prolific goalscorer. Of his 206 Newcastle goals, 49 were scored with his head. Earlier in his career, especially at Southampton, Shearer played a more creative role: providing chances for fellow strikers, and making runs into space, owing to his early development as a midfielder. Later on in his career, Shearer played a more forward role, after his age robbed him {{of some of his}} pace. Able to hold the ball up well, he often functioned as a target man, providing balls for other players. Although his strength allowed him to hold on <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>ball,</b> his playing style sometimes brought him criticism – most commonly that his play was too physical, and that he used his elbows too aggressively. It was this which contributed to both of his sendings off, although one was later rescinded on appeal.|$|E
5|$|Between every down, {{the player}} selects a formation, play and, on defense, {{coverage}} shell from a menu. The game contains fifty-five offensive plays and seventy-one defensive plays, such as screen and play-action passes, blitzes and man-to-man defense. During a down, the player may control one team member {{at a time}} or allow the entire team to execute a play automatically. On offense, depending on the play, the player controls the quarterback, running back or kicker. After a pass, control automatically changes <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> receiver. On defense, the player may at any time switch control between any members of the team. Instant replay is available to review plays.|$|E
50|$|Defenders {{can hold}} on to a ball carrier whilst trying <b>to</b> tag <b>the</b> <b>ball,</b> {{but they are not}} allowed to attempt <b>to</b> tackle <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> carrier <b>to</b> <b>the</b> ground.|$|R
50|$|In Golf, {{teams had}} <b>to</b> place <b>the</b> <b>balls</b> into their opponents zones & nets, while in Squirrel the {{challenge}} was reversed, with teams aiming <b>to</b> collect <b>the</b> <b>balls.</b>|$|R
50|$|If he {{is unable}} to find an open {{receiver}} he will attempt <b>to</b> run <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> himself, throw <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> out of bounds to prevent a sack and/or turnover, or if there is no lane, he may collapse <b>to</b> <b>the</b> ground <b>to</b> protect <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> and try <b>to</b> avoid a fumble. Even with a well structured offensive line, the quarterback only has seconds <b>to</b> pass <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> within <b>the</b> tackle box. Moving the pocket can help avoid a sack. When that fails, quarterbacks may scramble, either to gain more time for <b>the</b> wide receivers, <b>to</b> avoid a sack, or <b>to</b> rush <b>the</b> <b>ball.</b>|$|R
5|$|Despite United's early pressure, it was Barcelona {{who scored}} the first {{goal of the}} match. Edwin van der Sar cleared the ball downfield for Manchester United, but it was headed away by Barcelona's midfield anchor Sergio Busquets. Carrick was first <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> for Manchester United, but he could only head {{it as far as}} Xavi, who passed to Andrés Iniesta. The Manchester United defence backed away from the Spaniard, who – after exchanging passes with Lionel Messi – played the ball into the path of Samuel Eto'o in the Manchester United penalty area. Nemanja Vidić {{attempted}} to shepherd the Cameroonian striker towards the goal line, but Eto'o easily stepped inside him and toe-poked the ball past Van der Sar to make it 1–0 to Barcelona inside 10minutes.|$|E
5|$|Hobbs was an {{occasional}} medium-paced bowler who bowled a good length {{and made the}} ball swing. Some critics judged {{him to be a}} potentially good bowler, but both Surrey and England were reluctant for him to bowl regularly, fearing it would affect his batting. As a fielder, Hobbs improved greatly from his early days. He fielded in the covers and was expert in cutting off potential runs and returning the ball quickly to the wicket-keeper. Contemporaries believed him {{to be one of the}} best cover fielders there had been, and remarked on his powers of anticipation in getting <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>ball.</b> They also noted he sometimes deceived batsmen with his casual attitude and occasional deliberate mis-fields; these would be followed by very sharp fielding which often produced a run out.|$|E
5|$|Lampard {{then put}} Chelsea 3–2 ahead, but Hargreaves {{levelled}} {{things up with}} a shot into the top corner. Ashley Cole was the next up, and Van der Sar got a strong hand <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> but could not keep it out. Nani then {{knew he had to}} score to keep United in it, and he did, leaving it up to John Terry to win the cup for Chelsea; however, Terry lost his footing when planting his standing foot by the ball, and, even though Van der Sar was sent the wrong way, Terry's mis-hit effort struck the outside of the right post and went wide.|$|E

25|$|Originally {{holes and}} saucers worked by using tubes behind the playing field, with a pin at <b>the</b> top <b>to</b> hold <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> for later drops. Another {{version of the}} tube uses two {{spinning}} wheels <b>to</b> transfer <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> from hole <b>to</b> hole. Newer versions use an electronic track with a carriage or an electromagnet <b>to</b> pull <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> between holes.|$|R
5000|$|Kickers attempt <b>to</b> {{position}} <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> in a {{way that}} allows them <b>to</b> kick <b>the</b> <b>ball's</b> [...] "sweet spot". Kicking the sweet spot will result in <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> travelling further and is located {{about a third of the}} way up <b>the</b> <b>ball.</b>|$|R
5|$|Luton kicked-off the final, {{and both}} sides enjoyed early spells of possession, moving the ball about briskly. Arsenal tested the Luton back four in the eighth minute, when Davis' pass went over Johnson and the ball was {{collected}} by Thomas on the right flank. Charging towards the penalty area, he was impeded by the incoming Dibble and moved near the byline, but Johnson obstructed his eventual shot at goal. Minutes later, Luton had their first chance of the match from a long free kick, taken by Tim Breacker. The ball reached the Arsenal penalty area, and goalkeeper John Lukic failed to collect it; Harford got his head <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>ball,</b> but it just went over the crossbar. Another Luton free kick, {{this time in the}} 13th minute, led to the opening goal. The Arsenal defence failed to clear Preece's incoming delivery, and Foster, thinking quick, managed to slip an angled pass in Brian Stein's direction. The midfielder scored – it was the second goal Arsenal had conceded in the competition.|$|E
5|$|Manchester United {{used their}} {{third and final}} {{substitute}} in the 75thminute, replacing Giggs with Paul Scholes, who took over as team captain. Ronaldo and Scholes each received yellow cards in the 78th and 80thminutes, respectively; Ronaldo's yellow card was awarded for a robust shoulder-charge on Puyol as the Barcelona right back shepherded the ball out for a goal kick, while Scholes was booked for a late challenge on Busquets. While the referee played advantage after Scholes' foul, Iniesta cut inside from the left wing and hit a shot that was saved above the head of Van der Sar. An extended spell of Barcelona possession followed, as they strung a series of around 20 passes together, culminating with Puyol attempting to clip the ball over the onrushing Van der Sar, who blocked the shot. Both players went for the follow-up, but the Dutch goalkeeper was first <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> and sent Puyol sprawling.|$|E
5|$|Steve DeBerg {{opened the}} second half with an 84-yard drive ending in a touchdown, and {{followed}} that with a touchdown pass to Gerald Carter a minute later. The game nearly became {{a repeat of the}} previous week, as the Packers replaced quarterback Don Majkowski with Randy Wright. Wright's two fourth-quarter touchdowns cut into Tampa Bay's 23–3 lead, but this time the offense was able to hold on <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>ball.</b> Two Calvin Magee catches for first downs sealed the victory. The Buccaneers' 17second-half points are credited to the coaching staff's adjustment to the Packers' man-to-man defense. The Buccaneers and Packers both had the same amount of net yards (279), passing yards (190), and rushing yards (89). Donald Igwebuike's three field goals broke Bill Capece's Buccaneer career record. The victory left the Buccaneers in second place in the NFC Central division. This led to speculation as to whether coach Perkins, who had been able to lead the New York Giants to the playoffs in three years as their coach, would be able to repeat the feat in a single year with Tampa Bay.|$|E
25|$|Electromagnets: Some {{machines}} feature {{electrically operated}} magnets below <b>the</b> playfield <b>to</b> affect <b>the</b> <b>ball's</b> speed and/or trajectory according <b>to</b> <b>the</b> {{current state of}} game play. This may be done <b>to</b> make <b>the</b> <b>ball's</b> movement unpredictable, <b>to</b> temporarily halt <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> (as a ball saver, for example), or <b>to</b> otherwise control <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> by non-mechanical means. Electromagnets may also be used in above-playfield elements (often as part of <b>the</b> playfield toys) <b>to</b> grab <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> and move it elsewhere (onto a mini-playfield, for example). The Williams machine The Twilight Zone featured a mini-playfield that used electromagnets controlled by the flipper buttons, allowing <b>the</b> player <b>to</b> flip <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> on <b>the</b> mini-playfield, essentially working as invisible flippers. Contrary to somewhat popular myth, there are no professionally produced pinball machines known to contain magnets under <b>the</b> playfield intended <b>to</b> clandestinely make game play harder or increase ball losses.|$|R
5000|$|If <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> lies in or on an {{obstruction}}, <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> may be lifted, the obstruction removed, and <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> must {{be dropped}} (or placed if on the putting green) as near <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>ball's</b> original spot as possible but not nearer <b>to</b> <b>the</b> hole.|$|R
50|$|Why I-formation is EffectiveIn tennis {{you want}} <b>to</b> keep <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> away from <b>the</b> net player, because It's easy <b>to</b> put <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> away from closer <b>to</b> <b>the</b> net then any other {{position}} on the court.|$|R
5|$|The onslaught {{prompted}} Yardley to {{take the}} new ball and replace Compton with his pacemen. Bradman reached 50 in 60 minutes and then aimed a drive from Cranston's bowling, but sliced {{it in the air}} to point. Yardley dived forward and got his hands <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>ball,</b> but failed to hold on. Australia reached 202halfway to the required totalwith 165 minutes left, after Morris dispatched consecutive full tosses from Laker. England began to become demoralised and their fielding continued to deteriorate. Bradman hooked two boundaries, but suffered a fibrositis attack, which put him in significant pain. Drinks were taken while Bradman was being treated, and Morris had to shield his captain from the strike until the pain had subsided. Australia reached 250 shortly before tea with Morris on 133 and Bradman on 92. Bradman then reached his century in 147 minutes as the second-wicket stand passed 200.|$|E
5|$|There {{has also}} been a surge in the demand for Hester’s jerseys within the Chicago area {{sporting}} stores. Also, Hester was invited to throw the ceremonial opening pitch and sing Take Me Out <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Ball</b> Game at the Chicago Cubs' 2007 home opener. Along with teammates Rex Grossman and Tommie Harris, Hester appeared on the February 2007 issue of Sports Illustrated for Kids. His reputation {{has also been}} bolstered by EA Sports' Madden NFL 08, where Hester's perfect 100 speed rating made him the fastest player in the game's history. Hester also appeared in a promotional video for the game. He appeared in commercials for Under Armour in 2008 and 2009. In 2013, Hester outran a cheetah in a race sponsored by National Geographic at Busch Gardens Tampa. The competition consisted of Hester running back and forth on a straight track to simulate laps, while the cheetah ran in a similar but separate track.|$|E
5|$|United {{then went}} back downfield and Ronaldo took on Lauren, who dared not dive in for a tackle and risk a second yellow card. Ronaldo got past the Cameroonian full-back and then chipped a cross into the penalty area, but Van Nistelrooy was unable to make enough contact with the ball to force his header on target. A minute later, Silvestre found Rooney with another {{diagonal}} pass; Rooney attempted to drive in a low cross, but it ended up heading towards goal and came back off {{the foot of the}} post. Fletcher was first <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> but he fired a shot across the face of the goal and out for a goal kick. With their very next attack, United sent Ronaldo away down the left wing again; he sent over another cross, but it was again too far in front of Van Nistelrooy.|$|E
25|$|Sanding of <b>the</b> bowling <b>ball</b> {{surface was}} another {{technique}} <b>to</b> soften <b>the</b> <b>ball's</b> surface. Once <b>the</b> track area {{is located on}} <b>the</b> <b>ball,</b> <b>the</b> bowler would sand <b>the</b> track area <b>to</b> make <b>the</b> surface more abrasive, allowing <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> <b>to</b> hook more. And, bowlers would apply solvents <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>ball's</b> surface during tournament play—rubbing the chemicals into the cover using a rag. More rules by <b>the</b> ABC had <b>to</b> be passed, including restrictions from doctoring <b>the</b> bowling <b>ball's</b> surface at any time once <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> has passed inspection by an official.|$|R
