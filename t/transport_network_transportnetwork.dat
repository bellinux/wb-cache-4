30|$|In [11 – 13], {{the authors}} {{addressed}} HSDPA flow control. It {{is a common}} assumption in these papers that Iub <b>transport</b> <b>network</b> capacity is not limiting. These flow controls are optimized only for efficient use of the air interface. In [14], the authors introduced a <b>transport</b> <b>network</b> overload control algorithm for Best-Effort DCH traffic. They showed that already {{in the case of}} DCHs, this improves <b>transport</b> <b>network</b> utilization. In [15], the authors introduced cross-layer backpressure in the RNC, which allows good <b>transport</b> <b>network</b> utilization, when the <b>transport</b> <b>network</b> bottleneck buffer is in the RNC. In [4], an HSDPA flow control algorithm which solves not only the efficient usage of air interface but also the congestion situation on <b>transport</b> <b>network</b> is proposed. The proposed algorithm {{can be used in a}} more general <b>transport</b> <b>network,</b> because it does not require the <b>transport</b> <b>network</b> bottleneck buffer to be in the RNC. In [16], the authors proposed an extension of a related HSDPA flow control algorithm which provides fairness-optimal initial rates for HSDPA flows sharing the same <b>transport</b> <b>network</b> bottleneck.|$|R

In {{order to}} improve the {{objectivity}} of urban public <b>transport</b> <b>network</b> evaluation and achieve the sub-file of quality level of preliminary scheme, a comprehensive evaluation method for urban public <b>transport</b> <b>network</b> was proposed based on TOPSIS, and then constructed the evaluation model of urban public <b>transport</b> <b>network.</b> This method was applied to Xi’an urban public <b>transport</b> <b>network</b> planning, which obeyed the basic theory of scheme evaluation and some related requirements. The result showed that planning- 5 was the best one among the five urban public <b>transport</b> <b>network</b> planning in Xi’an and consistent with the passenger flow prediction. The evaluation model for urban public <b>transport</b> <b>network</b> based on TOPSIS was objective, which involved few parameters, simple operation, scientific evaluation and provided a basis for urban public <b>transport</b> <b>network</b> planning decision...|$|R
30|$|With {{more and}} more {{increased}} air interface throughput, the efficient utilization of the often limiting <b>transport</b> <b>network</b> became more important. To meet this demand a per-flow HSUPA <b>transport</b> <b>network</b> flow control algorithm has been proposed. The need for <b>transport</b> <b>network</b> congestion control was shown and <b>transport</b> <b>network</b> congestion detection and avoidance techniques were described. The introduced algorithm can support quality of service differentiation among HSUPA flows as well as different <b>transport</b> <b>network</b> bottlenecks for the flows of the same Node B. It was shown by simulations that the proposed algorithm can maintain high <b>transport</b> <b>network</b> utilization and good fairness among the flows while also keeping the delay and loss in the <b>transport</b> <b>network</b> low. The solution {{has been compared to}} a scenario where we rely only on TCP congestion control and {{it has been shown that}} the lack of HSUPA flow control causes serious performance degradation in the system when the <b>transport</b> <b>network</b> capacity is limiting the throughput.|$|R

30|$|The {{introduction}} of High Speed Uplink Packet Access (HSUPA) greatly improves achievable uplink bitrate but it presents new challenges {{to be solved}} in the WCDMA radio access <b>network.</b> In the <b>transport</b> <b>network,</b> bandwidth reservation for HSUPA is not efficient and TCP cannot efficiently resolve congestion because of lower layer retransmissions. This paper proposes an HSUPA <b>transport</b> <b>network</b> flow control algorithm that handles congestion situations efficiently and supports Quality of Service differentiation. In the Radio <b>Network</b> Controller (RNC), <b>transport</b> <b>network</b> congestion is detected. Relying on the standardized control frame, the RNC notifies the Node B about <b>transport</b> <b>network</b> congestion. In case of <b>transport</b> <b>network</b> congestion, the Node B part of the HSUPA flow control instructs the air interface scheduler to reduce the bitrate of the flow to eliminate congestion. The performance analysis concentrates on <b>transport</b> <b>network</b> limited scenarios. It is shown that TCP cannot provide efficient congestion control. The proposed algorithm can achieve high end-user perceived throughput, while maintaining low delay, loss, and good fairness in the <b>transport</b> <b>network.</b>|$|R

40|$|<b>Transport</b> <b>networks</b> have {{to provide}} {{carriers}} with time-efficient alternative routes in case of disruptions. It is, therefore, essential for <b>transport</b> <b>network</b> planners and operators to identify sections within the network which, if broken, have a considerable {{negative impact on the}} networks performance. Research on <b>transport</b> <b>network</b> analysis provides lots of different approaches and models in order to identify such critical sections. Most of them, however, are only applicable to mono-modal <b>transport</b> <b>networks</b> and calculate indices which represent the criticality of sections by using aggregated data. The model presented, in contrast, focuses on the analysis of intermodal <b>transport</b> <b>networks</b> by using a traffic micro simulation. Based on available, real-life data, our approach models a <b>transport</b> <b>network</b> as well as its actual traffic participants and their individual decisions in case of a disruption. The resulting transport delay time due to a specific disruption helps to identify critical sections and critical networks, as a whole.

30|$|Likewise to HSDPA [4], the Iub and Iur <b>transport</b> <b>network</b> links {{could be}} a {{bottleneck}} in the radio access network for HSUPA, since the increased air interface (Uu) capacity does not always come with similarly increased <b>transport</b> <b>network</b> capacity in practice. (Iub is between Node B and RNC, Iur is between Drift RNC and Serving RNC (SRNC).)The cost of transport links is still high in some cases and not expected to decrease dramatically [5]. The <b>transport</b> <b>network</b> links {{are expected to be}} bottleneck, for example, in case of E 1, T 1 transmissions and ADSL UL transmission but it is unlikely to have UL <b>transport</b> <b>network</b> bottleneck, for example, in case of E 3 transmission or 100 [*]Mbps Ethernet access. (The bitrate available for ATM cells is 1920 [*]kbps in case of E 1, 1536 [*]kbps in case of T 1 and 33920 [*]kbps in case of E 3.)

40|$|Under urbanisation, {{transport}} infrastructures may {{be improved}} when urban population grows. Meanwhile, land use patterns may vary and this urban dynamics may drive variations in mode choice of commuters and spatial features of <b>transport</b> <b>networks.</b> Empirical studies have observed scaling laws between {{the amount of}} transport infrastructures and city sizes. This thesis is aiming to provide a modelling framework for the analytical investigation of network growth and present some empirical observations of the variation in spatial features of <b>transport</b> <b>networks.</b> First, a simple linear monocentric city model is formulated and the global performance of transport systems is derived. Two cases according to strategies of urban intensification and sprawl have been studied to examine the consequence of the scaling-law growth in transport infrastructures. Second, this thesis proposes a modelling framework. The framework includes two congestible modes, the scaling-law growth of transport infrastructures and housing allocation of residents so that phenomena under urban dynamics could be modelled. The experiments show that the proposed modelling framework could investigate the trade-off of investment on the highway and public transport system. Third, empirical observations of spatial features in <b>transport</b> <b>networks</b> are reported in this thesis. The thesis measures circuity of <b>transport</b> <b>networks,</b> because this indicator could examine how aggregate <b>transport</b> <b>networks</b> are and the efficiency of network structures. Then research methods that can deal with several data sources are developed.
