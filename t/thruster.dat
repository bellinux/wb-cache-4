5|$|Hafnium {{is used in}} alloys with iron, titanium, niobium, tantalum, {{and other}} metals. An alloy used for liquid rocket <b>thruster</b> nozzles, for example the main engine of the Apollo Lunar Modules, is C103 which {{consists}} of 89% niobium, 10% hafnium and 1% titanium.|$|E
5|$|Silicon nitride {{has long}} been used in {{high-temperature}} applications. In particular, it was identified {{as one of the}} few monolithic ceramic materials capable of surviving the severe thermal shock and thermal gradients generated in hydrogen/oxygen rocket engines. To demonstrate this capability in a complex configuration, NASA scientists used advanced rapid prototyping technology to fabricate a one-inch-diameter, single-piece combustion chamber/nozzle (<b>thruster)</b> component. The <b>thruster</b> was hot-fire tested with hydrogen/oxygen propellant and survived five cycles including a 5-minute cycle to a 1320°C material temperature.|$|E
5|$|The {{satellite}} continued operations until February 25, 1982, when it {{was removed}} from operations due to a faulty yaw control <b>thruster.</b> The satellite was placed in standby mode on March 31, 1983.|$|E
50|$|It will be {{equipped}} with two sets of rocket <b>thrusters,</b> which include four to six large ‘Delta V’ <b>thrusters</b> and eight to 12 small Reaction Control System (RCS) <b>thrusters.</b> The function of the ‘Delta V’ <b>thrusters</b> will be speed management, slowing down the probe or speeding it up as per requirements, while the RCS <b>thrusters</b> {{will be used for}} delicate manoeuvring.|$|R
500|$|MRO has twenty {{rocket engine}} <b>thrusters</b> on board. Six large <b>thrusters</b> each produce [...] of thrust {{for a total}} of [...] meant mainly for orbital insertion. These <b>thrusters</b> were {{originally}} designed for the Mars Surveyor 2001 Lander.

Finally, eight small <b>thrusters</b> each produce [...] of thrust for attitude control during normal operations.|$|R
50|$|Among {{electric}} <b>thrusters,</b> ion <b>thrusters</b> {{have received}} the most serious commercial and academic consideration. Ion <b>thrusters</b> are seen as the best solution for these missions, as they require high change in velocity but do not require rapid acceleration.|$|R
5|$|A {{participant}} in the U.S. Air Force's Man in Space Soonest and X-20 Dyna-Soar human spaceflight programs, Armstrong joined the NASA Astronaut Corps in 1962. He made his first space flight as command pilot of Gemini 8 in March 1966, becoming NASA's first civilian astronaut to fly in space. He performed the first docking of two spacecraft, with pilot David Scott. This mission was aborted after Armstrong used some of his reentry control fuel to prevent a dangerous spin caused by a stuck <b>thruster,</b> in the first in-flight space emergency.|$|E
5|$|Deep Impacts {{state of}} health was {{uncertain}} during the first day after launch. Shortly after entering orbit around the Sun and deploying its solar panels, the probe switched itself to safe mode. The {{cause of the problem}} was simply an incorrect temperature limit in the fault protection logic for the spacecraft's RCS <b>thruster</b> catalyst beds. The spacecraft's thrusters were used to detumble the spacecraft following third stage separation. On January 13, 2005, NASA announced that the probe was out of safe mode and healthy.|$|E
5|$|Thrust is {{provided}} by four Rolls-Royce Mermaid azimuth <b>thruster</b> type podded propulsion units, each featuring one forward-facing low-vibration propeller with separately bolted blades. The forward pair of thrusters is fixed, but the aft pair can swivel through 360°, removing {{the need for a}} rudder. The Queen Mary 2 is the first quadruple-propeller passenger ship completed since the SS France in 1961. Queen Mary 2 carries eight spare blades on the foredeck, immediately forward of the bridge screen.|$|E
50|$|Mechanical azimuth <b>thrusters</b> can {{be fixed}} installed, {{retractable}} or underwater-mountable. They may have fixed pitch propellers or controllable pitch propellers. Fixed installed <b>thrusters</b> are used for tugboats, ferries and supply-boats. Retractable <b>thrusters</b> are used as auxiliary propulsion for dynamically positioned vessels and take-home propulsion for military vessels. Underwater-mountable <b>thrusters</b> are used as dynamic positioning propulsion for very large vessels such as semi-submersible drilling rigs and drillships.|$|R

5000|$|The Reaction Control System (RCS) {{consisted}} of eight pitch/yaw <b>thrusters</b> (four for each axis) and four roll <b>thrusters.</b> They {{used the same}} kind of hydrogen peroxide fuel as the main rocket engine from a dedicated [...] fuel tank and were controlled by the pilot using a handle mounted in the instrument panel. The pitch/yaw <b>thrusters</b> were rated at [...] thrust each and the roll <b>thrusters</b> were rated at [...] thrust.|$|R
5|$|In {{addition}} to the pressurised modules, Mir featured several external components. The largest component was the Sofora girder, a large scaffolding-like structure consisting of 20 segments which, when assembled, projected 14 metres from its mount on Kvant-1. A self-contained <b>thruster</b> block, the VDU, was mounted {{on the end of}} Sofora and was used to augment the roll-control thrusters on the core module. The VDU's increased distance from Mirs axis allowed an 85% decrease in fuel consumption, reducing the amount of propellant required to orient the station. A second girder, Rapana, was mounted aft of Sofora on Kvant-1. This girder, a small prototype of a structure intended to be used on Mir-2 to hold large parabolic dishes away from the main station structure, was 5 metres long and used as a mounting point for externally mounted exposure experiments.|$|E
5|$|Soyuz TM-9 {{launched}} EO-6 {{crew members}} Anatoly Solovyev and Aleksandr Balandin on 11 February 1990. While docking, the EO-5 crew noted that three thermal blankets on the ferry were loose, potentially creating problems on reentry, {{but it was}} decided that they would be manageable. Their stay on board Mir saw the addition of the Kristall module, launched 31 May 1990. The first docking attempt on 6 June was aborted due to an attitude control <b>thruster</b> failure. Kristall arrived at the front port on 10 June and was relocated to the lateral port opposite Kvant-2 the next day, restoring the equilibrium of the complex. Due to the delay in the docking of Kristall, EO-6 was extended by 10 days to permit the activation of the module’s systems and to accommodate an EVA to repair the loose thermal blankets on Soyuz TM-9.|$|E
5|$|Unable to {{maneuver}} the Soyuz to dock with the station, Stone ejects herself via explosive decompression {{and uses a}} fire extinguisher as a makeshift <b>thruster</b> to travel the final metres to Tiangong, which is rapidly deorbiting. Stone then enters the Shenzhou capsule just as Tiangong starts to break up on the upper edge of the atmosphere. Stone radios that she is ready {{to head back to}} Earth. After re-entering the atmosphere, Stone hears Mission Control, which is tracking the capsule and sending a rescue. But due to a harsh reentry and the premature jettison of the heat shield, a fire starts inside the capsule.|$|E
40|$|Microwave <b>thrusters</b> without {{propellant}} {{are a new}} concept. In these <b>thrusters,</b> microwaves are radiated into {{a sealed}} conical cavity through a waveguide, which act {{on the surface of}} the cavity and follow the contour of the <b>thrusters</b> to produce thrust. The advantages of these <b>thrusters</b> are: (1) Producing thrust without propellant; without erosion, wear and thermal stress from the hot exhaust gas; and at the same time increasing quality. (2) If the microwave output power is stable, the performance of <b>thrusters</b> is not affected by its working environment. (3) Existing experiments and theories show that using different structure materials, with microwave output power of 1 kW, the range of thrust is 0. 1 – 31500 N. From above mentioned, these <b>thrusters</b> can be used in satellites, deep space explorers and spacecraft, bringing the advantages of increasing their loading capability and operating life.

25|$|The first working ion <b>thruster</b> {{was built}} by Harold R. Kaufman in 1959 at NASA's Glenn Research Center in Ohio. The <b>thruster</b> {{was similar to the}} general design of a gridded {{electrostatic}} ion <b>thruster</b> with mercury as its propellant. Suborbital tests of the engine followed during the 1960s, and in 1964 the engine was tested on a suborbital flight aboard the Space Electric Rocket Test 1 (SERT 1). It successfully operated for the planned 31 minutes before falling back to Earth. This test was followed by an orbital test, SERT-2, in 1970.|$|E
5000|$|Direct drive: In some modern designs {{which use}} PMSM motors, {{the ratio of}} motor torque to its {{diameter}} is so high that the motor can rotate the propeller without a gearbox. In direct drive underwater <b>thrusters,</b> the motors are heavier than those used in geared <b>thrusters,</b> but lack of a gearbox compensates for this. Direct drive <b>thrusters</b> have higher reliability, lower noise, and higher efficiency, but the prices are higher than geared <b>thrusters.</b>|$|R

50|$|As of 2012 the {{propulsion}} system uses 16 MRE-1 <b>thrusters</b> which can provide one pound of thrust each. They are mono-propellent <b>thrusters</b> designed survive the unique thermal conditions JWST including {{extended periods of}} direct sunlight and light reflected from the sunshield. There is another set of thrusts called the Secondary Combustion Augmentation Thrusters; there are four of these <b>thrusters</b> and they have eight pounds of thrust each. Whereas the smaller <b>thrusters</b> are intended for aiding in precision pointing, the bigger <b>thrusters</b> are planned {{to be used for}} station keeping to maintain the telescope's halo orbit. The MRE-1 use hydrazine as a monoproellant and the larger SCAT <b>thrusters</b> are bi-propllant. The SCAT also uses hydrazine (N2H4), but also uses dinitrogen tetroxide (N2O4) as an oxidizer as the two fuels for its two-propellant design.|$|R
