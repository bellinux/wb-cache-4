5|$|Herodotus {{says that}} when the Persians in Asia Minor heard {{of the attack on}} Sardis, they {{gathered}} together, and marched to the relief of Artaphernes. When they arrived at Sardis, they found <b>the</b> <b>Greeks</b> recently departed. So they followed their tracks back towards Ephesus. They caught up with <b>the</b> <b>Greeks</b> outside Ephesus and <b>the</b> <b>Greeks</b> were forced to turn and prepare to fight. Holland suggests that the Persians were primarily cavalry (hence their ability to catch up with <b>the</b> <b>Greeks).</b> The typical Persian cavalry of the time were probably missile cavalry, whose tactics were to wear down a static enemy with volley after volley.|$|E

5|$|In {{the summer}} of 479BC <b>the</b> <b>Greeks</b> {{assembled}} a huge (by ancient standards) army and marched out of the Peloponnesus. The Persians retreated to Boeotia and built a fortified camp near Plataea. <b>The</b> <b>Greeks,</b> however, refused {{to be drawn into}} the prime cavalry terrain around the Persian camp, resulting in a stalemate that lasted 11 days. While attempting a retreat after their supply lines were disrupted, the Greek battle line fragmented. Thinking <b>the</b> <b>Greeks</b> in full retreat, Mardonius ordered his forces to pursue them, but <b>the</b> <b>Greeks</b> (particularly the Spartans, Tegeans and Athenians) halted and gave battle, routing the lightly armed Persian infantry and killing Mardonius.|$|E

5|$|The {{defeat at}} Marathon barely touched the vast {{resources}} of the Persian empire, yet for <b>the</b> <b>Greeks</b> it was an enormously significant victory.

5|$|This {{force was}} then {{guided by the}} Ephesians through the {{mountains}} to Sardis, Artaphernes's satrapal capital. <b>The</b> <b>Greeks</b> caught the Persians unaware, {{and were able to}} capture the lower city. However, Artaphernes still held the citadel with a significant force of men. The lower city then caught on fire, Herodotus suggests accidentally, which quickly spread. The Persians in the citadel, being surrounded by a burning city, emerged into the market-place of Sardis, where they fought with <b>the</b> <b>Greeks,</b> forcing them back. <b>The</b> <b>Greeks,</b> demoralised, then retreated from the city, and began to make their way back to Ephesus.|$|E
5|$|When Mardonius' raids {{disrupted}} the Allied supply chain, it forced the Allies {{to rethink their}} strategy. Rather than now moving to attack, however, they instead looked to retreat and secure their lines of communication. Despite this defensive move by <b>the</b> <b>Greeks,</b> {{it was in fact}} the chaos resulting from this retreat that finally ended the stalemate. Mardonius perceived this as a full-on retreat, in effect thinking that the battle was already over, and sought to pursue <b>the</b> <b>Greeks.</b> Since he did not expect <b>the</b> <b>Greeks</b> to fight, the tactical problems were no longer an issue and he tried {{to take advantage of the}} altered strategic situation he thought he had produced. Conversely, <b>the</b> <b>Greeks</b> had, inadvertently, lured Mardonius into attacking them on the higher ground and, despite being outnumbered, were thus at a tactical advantage.|$|E

5|$|Darius's European {{expedition}} was a {{major event}} in his reign, which began with the invasion of Thrace. Darius also conquered many cities of the northern Aegean, Paeonia, while Macedonia submitted voluntarily, after the demand of earth and water, becoming a vassal kingdom. He then left Megabyzus to conquer Thrace, returning to Sardis to spend the winter. <b>The</b> <b>Greeks</b> living in Asia Minor {{and some of the}} Greek islands had submitted to Persian rule already by 510 BCE. Nonetheless, there were certain Greeks who were pro-Persian, although these were largely based in Athens. To improve Greek-Persian relations, Darius opened his court and treasuries to those Greeks who wanted to serve him. These Greeks served as soldiers, artisans, statesmen and mariners for Darius. However, the increasing concerns amongst <b>the</b> <b>Greeks</b> over the strength of Darius's kingdom along with the constant interference by <b>the</b> <b>Greeks</b> in Ionia and Lydia were stepping stones towards the conflict that was yet to come between Persia and certain of the leading Greek city states.|$|E
5|$|Fearing that <b>the</b> <b>Greeks</b> might {{attack the}} bridges across the Hellespont and trap his army in Europe, Xerxes retreated {{with much of}} the army back to Asia. He left a hand picked force under Mardonius to {{complete}} the conquest the following year. However, under pressure from the Athenians, the Peloponnesian Allies eventually agreed to try to force Mardonius to battle, and marched on Attica. Mardonius retreated to Boeotia to lure <b>the</b> <b>Greeks</b> into open terrain and the two sides eventually met near the city of Plataea. There, at the Battle of Plataea in August 479 BC, the Greek army won a decisive victory, destroying much of the Persian army, and ending the invasion of Greece. Meanwhile, at the near-simultaneous naval Battle of Mycale <b>the</b> <b>Greeks</b> destroyed much of the remaining Persian fleet, thereby reducing the threat of further invasions.|$|E

5|$|In June 1912, the Greek Navy {{selected}} tenders from Germany's AG Vulcan for two destroyers and six torpedo boats, to {{be completed}} in just three to four months. This exceptionally short timeframe was accomplished through the help of the German Navy, which allowed <b>the</b> <b>Greeks</b> to take over German ships then being constructed. The contract price was evidently low, as one British firm complained that they could not understand how Vulcan would make a profit. Then, one month later, <b>the</b> <b>Greeks</b> selected Vulcan again for the construction of their battlecruiser, with its armor and armament coming from Bethlehem Steel in the United States. British firms were furious, again alleging that it would be impossible for Vulcan to make a profit on the contract, and surmising that the German government was subsidizing the purchase to get a foothold in the shipbuilding market. <b>The</b> <b>Greeks,</b> for their part, countered that the British manufacturers were colluding to keep armor plate prices high, and so they were able to significantly decrease their costs by ordering the ship's armor in the United States.|$|E

5|$|Learning from {{a runner}} that the Phocians had not held the path, Leonidas called a council of war at dawn. According to Diodorus, a Persian called Tyrrhastiadas, a Cymaean by birth, warned <b>the</b> <b>Greeks.</b> Some of <b>the</b> <b>Greeks</b> argued for withdrawal, but Leonidas {{resolved}} {{to stay at}} the pass with the Spartans. Upon discovering that his army had been encircled, Leonidas told his allies that they could leave if they wanted to. While many of <b>the</b> <b>Greeks</b> took him up on his offer and fled, around two thousand soldiers stayed behind to fight and die. Knowing that the end was near, <b>the</b> <b>Greeks</b> marched into the open field and met the Persians head-on. Many of the Greek contingents then either chose to withdraw (without orders) or were ordered to leave by Leonidas (Herodotus admits that there is some doubt about which actually happened). The contingent of 700 Thespians, led by their general Demophilus, refused to leave and committed themselves to the fight. Also present were the 400 Thebans and probably the helots who had accompanied the Spartans.|$|E

5|$|Mycale and Plataea {{have great}} {{significance}} in ancient {{history as the}} battles which decisively ended the second Persian invasion of Greece, thereby swinging {{the balance of the}} Greco-Persian Wars in favour of <b>the</b> <b>Greeks.</b> The Battle of Salamis saved Greece from immediate conquest, but it was Mycale and Plataea which effectively ended that threat. However, neither of these battles are as well known as Thermopylae, Salamis or Marathon. The reason for this discrepancy is not entirely clear; it might however be a result of the circumstances in which the battle was fought. The fame of Thermopylae certainly lies in the doomed heroism of <b>the</b> <b>Greeks</b> in the face of overwhelming numbers; Marathon and Salamis perhaps because they were both fought against the odds, and in dire strategic situations. Conversely, the Battles of Plataea and Mycale were both fought from a relative position of Greek strength, and against lesser odds; perhaps <b>the</b> <b>Greeks</b> were even expecting to win and had certainly seen the opportunity to deal the final blow.|$|E
5|$|On 4 January 1913, the Ottoman Navy and Army {{attempted}} a landing at Bozca Ada (Tenedos) to retake the island from <b>the</b> <b>Greeks.</b> Barbaros Hayreddin {{and the rest}} of the fleet supported the operation, but the appearance of the Greek fleet forced the Ottomans to break off the operation. <b>The</b> <b>Greeks</b> also withdrew, and several Ottoman cruisers opened fire as both sides departed, but no damage was done. By 15:30, Barbaros Hayreddin was back at Ã‡anakkale inside the safety of the Dardanelles. On 10 January, the fleet conducted a patrol outside the Dardanelles.

5|$|Tactically, the Persian fleet {{should have}} held the {{advantage}} at sea, since the Athenian {{part of the}} Greek fleet was, despite their efforts at Artemisium and Salamis, still raw in seamanship.

However, when <b>the</b> <b>Greeks</b> chose to fight on land, the Persians then threw away the advantage of their fortifications by emerging to fight <b>the</b> <b>Greeks</b> in the open field.
