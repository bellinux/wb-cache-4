25|$|When Anangu {{began their}} {{struggle}} for land rights in 1976, very little prospecting was being conducted at Mintabie. As <b>things</b> <b>turned</b> <b>out,</b> {{the push for}} land rights coincided with a rush on opal exploration. Consequently, {{by the time the}} South Australian Parliament began to seriously consider granting land rights to Anangu, a growing number of opal miners were setting up operations around Mintabie.|$|E

Despite one of the prototypes being used for an extensive European tour in the summer of 1957 by one magazine, it was not until other pre-production cars were tested by the factory immediately prior to full production that issues with the car's handling were revealed.|$|E
25|$|One {{particularly}} high-profile {{example of}} a duck came in 1948, when Don Bradman was playing his final Test match for Australia, against England at The Oval. In Australia's first innings, Bradman was bowled for a duck by Eric Hollies, causing his Test average to fall from 101.39 to 99.94; had he scored just four runs, his average would have been 100. As <b>things</b> <b>turned</b> <b>out,</b> Australia won the match by an innings, and so Bradman did not get to bat a second time (had he batted, he would have needed at least 104 runs if dismissed or at least four runs if not out to get his average back to 100).|$|E

25|$|On 11 July 1803, Racoon, under Commander Austin Bissell, was sailing between Guanaba and St. Domingo in the West Indies {{when she}} sighted a French naval brig {{anchored}} in Léogâne Roads. As Racoon sailed towards her, Bissell {{saw that the}} French had springs on their cables and were ready to engage. Racoon was flying the French flag, and although he was unaware that the war had broken out again between France and Britain, the French captain was wary, rightly so as <b>things</b> <b>turned</b> <b>out.</b> At 2:45p.m. Racoon anchored, also with springs, 30 yards from the brig. She then exchanged her French ensign for the British, and opened fire. The two vessels exchanged fire {{for half an hour}} before the French vessel cut his cables and tried to sail away. Racoon followed and after about another 10 minutes of fire from Racoon, the French brig surrendered.|$|E
25|$|<b>Things</b> <b>turned</b> <b>out</b> {{slightly}} otherwise in Aragon, {{where the}} sociolinguistic situation was different, with a clearer Basque-Romance bilingual situation (cf. Basques from the Val d'Aran cited c. 1000), but a receding Basque language (Basque {{banned in the}} marketplace of Huesca, 1349). While the language was chosen as a medium of prestige in records and official statements along with Latin in the early 13th century, Occitan faced competition from the rising local Romance vernacular, the Navarro-Aragonese, both orally and in writing, especially after Aragon's territorial conquests south to Zaragoza, Huesca and Tudela between 1118 and 1134. It resulted that a second Occitan immigration of this period was assimilated by the similar Navarro-Aragonese language, which {{at the same time}} was fostered and chosen by the kings of Aragon. The language fell into decay in the 14th century across the whole southern Pyrenean area and became largely absorbed into Navarro-Aragonese first and Castilian later in the 15th century, after their exclusive boroughs broke up (1423, Pamplona's boroughs unified).|$|E

500|$|By 1988 Ryzhkov {{increasingly}} {{sided with}} Leonid Abalkin, {{one of the}} few economists who advocated fiscal responsibility. At the 19th Conference of the Central Committee, Abalkin was severely criticised by Gorbachev, and accused of [...] "economic determinism". Several conference delegates agreed with Gorbachev, but Ryzhkov's support remained solid. Abalkin was ordered to deliver a report to the Presidium of the Council of Ministers by December, which as <b>things</b> <b>turned</b> <b>out,</b> put financial stability at the top of its agenda. Gorbachev disliked Abalkin's report and rejected Ryzhkov's requests that he support it. Ryzhkov was then forced to create an even more conservative reform plan for 1989 in which price reform was to be postponed until 1991. When the Abalkin report was proposed at the Central Committee plenum, the majority of delegates indirectly attacked Gorbachev for his indecisiveness {{when it came to the}} implementation of price reform. In April 1990, after submitting a draft to the Presidential Council and the Federation Council, Ryzhkov's price reform was initiated. However, a short while later it was once more put on hold following severe criticism from Boris Yeltsin and several pro-Gorbachev intellectuals. The economic turmoil which hit the Soviet Union in 1990 was blamed on Ryzhkov, even though it was Gorbachev who had delayed Ryzhkov's proposed reform.|$|E

2500|$|<b>Things</b> <b>turned</b> <b>out</b> {{differently}} in the 1930s, {{although it was not}} a smooth transition. In 1932, most of the system's streetcars were converted to [...] "one-man operation" [...] where, rather than requiring both a motorman to drive in front and a conductor to take fares in the rear, the motorman took over both operations. The doors on the streetcars were modified to allow easier boarding in front. So-called [...] "gate cars" [...] which had used open grating on the rear of the cars mostly disappeared from the lines. The transition from two-man to one-man operation was taking place on many streetcar lines across the country around this time.|$|E

Baby steps towards multi-candidate elections {{and the rule of law}} in the USSR crumbled instantly as show trials, spy mania, mass arrests, and mass executions swept the land.
