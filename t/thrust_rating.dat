The Luftwaffe's 35 ECRs were delivered new, while Italy received 16 converted IDSs. Italian Tornado ECRs differ from the Luftwaffe aircraft as they lack built-in reconnaissance capability and use RecceLite reconnaissance pods, also only Luftwaffe ECRs are equipped with RB199 Mk.105 engine, which has a slightly higher <b>thrust</b> <b>rating.</b> The German ECRs do not carry a cannon.

We present here the first direct imaging of the thermal envelope of such a thrust zone: the Jotun Basal Thrust (JBT) in the Scandinavian Caledonides, through Raman Spectroscopy of Carbonaceous Material in the alum shales, an organic carbon-rich unit of Cambro-Ordovician age along which the basal decollement of the JBT developed.

40|$|International audienceIn {{continental}} collision, most of {{the convergence}} between the two involved plates is accommodated on a major thrust system at crustal to lithospheric scale, which thermal state depends on critical parameters such as <b>thrust</b> <b>rate,</b> initial thermal properties of involved lithosphere units or local processes such as shear heating. In active orogens the deeper part of such thrust systems is only imaged by geophysics and their thermal state is inferred from modeling. The Norwegian Caledonides offer a rare exhumed thrust system : the Jotun Basal Thrust (JBT), that allows the direct determination of its thermal envelope through Raman Spectroscopy of Carbonaceous Material (RSCM). Data were collected in the Alum shales formation, an organic carbon-rich unit of Cambro-Ordovician age along which the basal decollement of the JBT accommodated {{a significant portion of}} the relative movement between the Caledonian nappe stack and Baltica during the Scandian collision and its later collapse. Maximum temperature mapping within this unit shows isotherms almost cylindrically grading from 320 C in the southeast to 500 C in the northwest in the trailing end of the nappe stack. Based on Bt+Chl+Grt+Phg equilibrium, we estimate that the trailing end reached 500 C at 1. 2 0. 1 GPa pressure. 2 D thermo-kinematic modeling constrained with these new natural data and timing considerations for the Scandian collision were used to understand the geodynamic significance of this maximum temperature envelope.

5000|$|Naturally, as {{altitude}} increases, {{there is}} a decrease in air density and, therefore, the net thrust of an engine. There is also a flight speed effect, termed <b>thrust</b> lapse <b>rate.</b> Consider the approximate equation for net thrust again:With a high specific thrust (e.g., fighter) engine, the jet velocity is relatively high, so intuitively one can see that increases in flight velocity have less of an impact upon net thrust than a medium specific thrust (e.g., trainer) engine, where the jet velocity is lower. The impact of <b>thrust</b> lapse <b>rate</b> upon a low specific thrust (e.g., civil) engine is even more severe. At high flight speeds, high-specific-thrust engines can pick up net thrust through the ram rise in the intake, but this effect tends to diminish at supersonic speeds because of shock wave losses.|$|R

50|$|A {{very common}} {{question}} is how to contrast the <b>thrust</b> <b>rating</b> of a jet engine with the power rating of a piston engine.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} studies wireless scheduling by jointly optimizing {{the physical}} (PHY) layer and the medium-access-control (MAC) layer. It {{consists of the}} following three main thrusts. In the first <b>thrust,</b> <b>rate</b> optimization for multicast communications at the medium access control (MAC) layer is studied. For Threshold-T based multicast policies, the transmission rates are optimized to maximize the throughput in stable networks and in saturated networks, respectively. To ensure multicast reliability when no retransmission is required at the MAC layer, transport layer erasure coding is used for reliability enhancement. The second thrust focuses on distributed opportunistic scheduling (DOS) for throughput maximization in wireless ad hoc networks based on random access. In such networks, DOS involves a process of joint channel probing and distributed scheduling. The desired tradeoff, between the throughput gain from better channel conditions and the cost for further channel probing, boils down to judiciously choosing the optimal stopping policy for channel probing. First, the collision model is assumed for random access, and the optimal scheduling policy is characterized from two perspectives: 1) For the network-centri...|$|R
40|$|The resummed {{differential}} <b>thrust</b> <b>rate</b> in e + e − annihilation {{is calculated}} using Soft-Collinear Effective Theory (SCET). The resulting {{distribution in the}} two-jet region (T ∼ 1) is found {{to agree with the}} corresponding expression calculated in perturbative QCD. Matching procedures to account for finite corrections at T < 1 in the two theories are then described. There are two important differences between the SCET and QCD approaches. First, SCET manifests a dynamical seesaw scale q = p 2 /Q in addition to the center-of-mass energy Q and the jet mass scale p ∼ Q √ (1 − T). Thus, the resummation of logs of p/q can be cleanly distinguished from the resummation of logs of Q/p. Second, finite parts of loop amplitudes appear in specific places in the perturbative distribution: in the matching to the hard function, at the scale Q, in matching to the jet function, at the scale p, and in matching to the soft function, at the scale q. This allows for a consistent merger of fixed order corrections and resummation. In particular, the total NLO e + e − cross section is reproduced from these finite parts without having to perfor...|$|R
