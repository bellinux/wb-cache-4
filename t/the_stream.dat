5|$|Between one of Stafford Meadow Brook's {{reservoirs}} {{and southern}} Scranton, the watershed of <b>the</b> <b>stream</b> is glacially deformed. At a saddle in this reach, <b>the</b> <b>stream</b> was once able to flow through Rocky Glen into Spring Brook during high flow conditions. There is an inner ridge between the gorge of Stafford Meadow Brook and that or Roaring Brook.|$|E
5|$|Due to the {{topography}} {{of the area}} in the vicinity of Scotch Run, the area near <b>the</b> <b>stream</b> was not settled until some time after the first settlement in the surrounding areas. Alexander McCauley settled on <b>the</b> <b>stream</b> in Beaver Township 1774. Some time before 1820, a carding mill was built by George Fleming on <b>the</b> <b>stream</b> southeast of Mainville. In 1820, it started {{to be used as a}} school, which was run by Jacob Gensel.|$|E
5|$|From its {{headwaters}} downstream to the downstream-most {{crossing of}} the Scranton/Moosic line, the drainage basin of Stafford Meadow Brook is designated as a High-Quality Coldwater Fishery and a Migratory Fishery. From that point downstream to its mouth, <b>the</b> <b>stream</b> is classified as a Warmwater Fishery and a Migratory Fishery. A large section of <b>the</b> <b>stream</b> from its headwaters to the lower Pennsylvania Route 307 bridge meets the criteria for an Exceptional Value designation. Wild trout naturally reproduce in <b>the</b> <b>stream</b> {{at least as far}} upstream as river mile 6.82 and as far downstream as its mouth. <b>The</b> <b>stream</b> was stocked with 500 adult and fingerling rainbow trout in 1894–1895. In 1984, the Pennsylvania Fish Commission speculated that there were native brook trout in part of <b>the</b> <b>stream.</b>|$|E

5|$|Hammersley Fork {{begins in}} central Eulalia Township, Potter County, near the Sinnemahoning Creek watershed. It flows {{southeast}} to Elk Lick Knob, where it receives the tributary Black Mark Hollow. <b>The</b> <b>stream</b> then turns south and flows into a valley, passing Bunnell Ridge. The valley gets deeper and <b>the</b> <b>stream</b> receives several small tributaries. It turns southwest shortly downstream {{of the mouth}} of Elkhorn Run. In the southern reaches of the township, <b>the</b> <b>stream</b> receives the tributary Bell Branch and turns south-southeast, exiting Eulalia Township.|$|E
5|$|In {{its upper}} reaches, most of Scotch Run is closed to public access. For this reason, a 1997 report stated that {{this section of}} <b>the</b> <b>stream</b> offered poor {{recreational}} opportunities. However, the report stated that <b>the</b> <b>stream</b> provided good recreational opportunities in its lower reaches. According to the report, both sections of <b>the</b> <b>stream</b> are poor sites for angling.|$|E

40|$|<b>The</b> <b>streaming</b> {{potential}} {{generated by}} a pressure-driven flow over a weakly charged slip-stick surface [the zeta potential of the surface is smaller than the thermal potential (25 mV) ] with an arbitrary double layer thickness is theoretically studied by solving the Debye–Huckel equation and Stokes equation. A series solution of <b>the</b> <b>streaming</b> potential is derived. Approximate expressions for <b>the</b> <b>streaming</b> potential in <b>the</b> limits of thin double layers and thick double layers are also given in excellent agreement with the full solution. To understand the impact of <b>the</b> slip, <b>the</b> <b>streaming</b> potential is compared against that over a homogeneously charged smooth surface. Our results indicate that <b>the</b> <b>streaming</b> potential over a superhydrophobic surface can only be enhanced under certain conditions. Moreover, as the double layer thickness increases, {{the advantage of the}} superhydrophobic surface diminishes. In addition, the Onsager relation which directly relates the magnitude of electro-osmotic effect to that of <b>the</b> <b>streaming</b> current effect has been explicitly proved to be valid for thin and thick double layers and homogeneously charged superhydrophobic surfaces. Comparisons between <b>the</b> <b>streaming</b> current and electro-osmotic mobility for an arbitrary electric double layer thickness under various conditions indicate that the Onsager relation seems applicable for arbitrary weakly charged superhydrophobic surfaces although there is no general proof. Knowledge of <b>the</b> <b>streaming</b> potential over a slip-stick surface can provide guidance for designing novel and efficient microfluidic energy-conversion devices using superhydrophobic surfaces...|$|R

In lacks a riparian buffer in parts of Scranton. However, there are large hemlock stands along <b>the</b> <b>stream</b> above Lake Scranton.
