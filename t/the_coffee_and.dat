5|$|As in Puerto Rico and Hispaniola, {{the severe}} drought during the El Niño of 1997 {{exacerbated}} the flood's disruption to crops in eastern Cuba. The heavy rainfall from Georges damaged the crops greatly, {{despite the effort}} to harvest them prior to its arrival. Up to 70% of the plantain crop, a chief food in the country's diet, was destroyed. The sugarcane crop fared badly as well, limiting one of the country's important export crops. <b>The</b> <b>coffee</b> <b>and</b> cocoa plantations also suffered from the hurricane, further damaging the country's food supply. A total of 15,758 hectares of croplands as well as 36,040 tons of fruit were destroyed by Hurricane Georges. Agricultural losses from the storm were estimated at $15million.|$|E
5|$|Washington {{experienced}} some tax trouble with federal authorities, concerning the financial relationship {{between himself and}} his company. In November 1918, he contracted with the company {{for the use of}} his trade secrets in the manufacture of <b>the</b> <b>coffee,</b> <b>and</b> a month later gave a four-fifths stake in this to his immediate family. The Washingtons insisted that taxes needn't be paid on the family members' income, and the case went first to the Board of Tax Appeals, and then to the Court of Appeals, which in 1927 ruled against the Washingtons by a two-to-one decision. A petition to the Supreme Court was not accepted.|$|E
5|$|Belgium {{continued}} to rule Rwanda as a UN Trust Territory after World War II, with {{a mandate to}} oversee its eventual independence. The economic landscape had changed considerably during the war; a cash economy grew, {{and with it the}} demand for labourers in the Congolese mines of Katanga and <b>the</b> <b>coffee</b> <b>and</b> sugar plantations of Uganda. There was a simultaneous shift in the Catholic Church; prominent figures in the early Rwandan church, who were from a wealthy and conservative background (such as Léon-Paul Classe), were replaced by younger clergy of working-class origin. Of these, a greater proportion were Flemish rather than Walloon Belgians and sympathised with the plight of the Hutu. Economic conditions and the seminary education provided by the church gave the Hutu a social mobility not previously possible, allowing the development of an elite group of Hutu leaders and intellectuals. This group, consisting of Hutu from the precolonial Kingdom of Rwanda, was joined by prominent citizens of kingdoms acquired during colonialism (including the Kiga).|$|E

25|$|Coffee percolators and {{automatic}} coffeemakers brew coffee using gravity. In an automatic coffeemaker, hot water drips onto coffee grounds that {{are held in}} a paper, plastic, or perforated metal coffee filter, allowing the water to seep through the ground coffee while extracting its oils and essences. The liquid drips through <b>the</b> <b>coffee</b> <b>and</b> the filter into a carafe or pot, and the spent grounds are retained in the filter.|$|E
25|$|The best (but least used) {{method of}} drying coffee is using drying tables. In this method, the pulped and {{fermented}} coffee is spread thinly on raised beds, which allows the air to pass {{on all sides of}} <b>the</b> <b>coffee,</b> <b>and</b> then the coffee is mixed by hand. In this method the drying that takes place is more uniform, and fermentation is less likely. Most African coffee is dried in this manner and certain coffee farms around the world are starting to use this traditional method.|$|E

25|$|The {{next step}} in the process is the {{roasting}} of the green coffee. Coffee is usually sold in a roasted state, and with rare exceptions all coffee is roasted before it is consumed. It can be sold roasted by the supplier, or it can be home roasted. The roasting process influences the taste of the beverage by changing the coffee bean both physically and chemically. The bean decreases in weight as moisture is lost and increases in volume, causing it to become less dense. The density of the bean also influences the strength of <b>the</b> <b>coffee</b> <b>and</b> requirements for packaging.|$|E

25|$|According to Leonhard Rauwolf's 1583 account, coffee became {{available}} in England {{no later than}} the 16th century, largely {{through the efforts of}} the British East India Company and the Dutch East India Company. The first coffeehouse in England was opened in St. Michael's Alley in Cornhill, London. The proprietor was Pasqua Rosée, the servant of Daniel Edwards, a trader in Turkish goods. Edwards imported <b>the</b> <b>coffee</b> <b>and</b> assisted Rosée in setting up the establishment. Oxford's Queen's Lane Coffee House, established in 1654, is still in existence today. By 1675, there were more than 3,000 coffeehouses throughout England, but there were many disruptions in the progressive movement of coffeehouses between the 1660s and 1670s. During the enlightenment, these early English coffee houses became gathering places used for deep religious and political discussions among the populace. This practice became so common, and potentially subversive, that Charles II made an attempt to crush coffee houses in 1675.|$|E
25|$|Coffee is the state's most {{important}} cash crop {{with a history}} from the 19th century. The crop was introduced in 1846 by Jeronimo Manchinelli who brought 1,500 seedlings from Guatemala on his farm La Chacara. This {{was followed by a}} number of other farms as well. Coffee production intensified during the regime of Porfirio Díaz and the Europeans who came to own many of the large farms in the area. By 1892, there were 22 coffee farms in the region, among them Nueva Alemania, Hamburgo, Chiripa, Irlanda, Argovia, San Francisco, and Linda Vista in the Soconusco region. Since then coffee production has grown and diversified to include large plantations, the use and free and forced labor and a significant sector of small producers. While most coffee is grown in the Soconusco, other areas grow it, including the municipalities of Oxchuc, Pantheló, El Bosque, Tenejapa, Chenalhó, Larráinzar, and Chalchihuitán, with around six thousand producers. It also includes organic coffee producers with 18 million tons grown annually 60,000 producers. One third of these producers are indigenous women and other peasant farmers who grow the coffee under the shade of native trees without the use of agro chemicals. Some of this coffee is even grown in environmentally protected areas such as the El Triunfo reserve, where ejidos with 14,000 people grow <b>the</b> <b>coffee</b> <b>and</b> sell it to cooperativers who sell it to companies such as Starbucks, but the main market is Europe. Some growers have created cooperatives of their own to cut out the middleman.|$|E
500|$|Before {{affecting}} Madagascar, {{officials in}} the country advised residents to evacuate to shelters, although the storm was {{not expected to be}} as severe as it was. When Manou stalled just offshore eastern Madagascar, it produced gusts as strong as 211km/h (131mph) in Vatomandry. The same city reported [...] of rainfall in a 15‑hour period. Damage was heaviest in Vatomandry, where 85% of buildings were destroyed, although the broader region also experienced severe damage and was largely isolated {{from the rest of the}} country. In Vatomandry, Manou severely damaged the main hospital, several schools, and the prison. The storm disrupted power and water networks. Strong winds blowing salt spray destroyed <b>the</b> <b>coffee</b> <b>and</b> cloves crops, and rice crops were also damaged, after 80% of rice fields were flooded in Brickaville and Andevoranto. In those two towns, an official estimated that 95% of houses were wrecked. The road between Vatomandry and Brickaville was washed out or otherwise blocked by landslides, and the village of Ilaka was isolated after the storm wrecked a bridge. Throughout Madagascar, Manou injured 85 and killed 89people, including 23people in Vatomandry and 2 in Brickaville. About 24,500houses were destroyed, leaving 114,480people homeless.|$|E

At this time, {{the crew and}} Inuit {{families}} had been rescued from the ice floe, however the fate of Budington, Bessels, and {{the remainder of the}} crew was still unknown. The board consisted of Admiral Louis M. Goldsborough, Secretary of the Navy Robeson, Commodore Reynolds, Captain Henry W. Howgate of the Army, and Spencer F. Baird of the Academy of Sciences. Tyson was the first to appear for questioning, and related the friction between Hall, Budington, and Bessels, and Hall's deathbed accusations of poisoning. The board also inquired about the whereabouts of Hall's journals and records. Tyson responded that while Hall was delirious, he instructed Budington to burn some of the papers, and the rest had disappeared. Later, journals of other crew members were discovered {{at the site of the}} Polaris wreck, but these had the sections regarding Hall's death cut out. Meyer testified to Budington's drinking, saying that the sailing master was [...] "drunk most always while we were going southward". Steward John Herron testified that he had not made the coffee that Hall had suspected of being laced with poison; he explained that the cook made <b>the</b> <b>coffee,</b> <b>and</b> that he had not kept track of how many people had touched the cup before it was brought to Hall.|$|E
2500|$|Tim Hortons is {{popularly known}} as [...] "Timmies". The ubiquity of Tim Hortons, through the wide {{expansion}} of its outlets, makes it a prominent feature of Canadian life; Canadians eat more doughnuts per capita and have more doughnut outlets per capita than any other nation. Tim Hortons' prevalence in <b>the</b> <b>coffee</b> <b>and</b> doughnut market has led to its branding as a Canadian cultural icon. The media routinely refer to its iconic status, despite this being a relatively recent development; {{there were only a}} few outlets before the chain's expansion in the late 1990s and 2000s. A series of Tim's television commercials promotes this idea by showing vignettes of Canadians abroad and their homesickness for Tim Hortons. Noted Canadian author Pierre Berton once wrote: [...] "In so many ways the story of Tim Hortons is the essential Canadian story. It is a story of success and tragedy, of big dreams and small towns, of old-fashioned values and tough-fisted business, of hard work and of hockey." ...|$|E

[...] Ridge and Taylor's twins, Stephanie ("Steffy") and Phoebe, are born in 1999. During the pregnancy Taylor experiences tuberculosis after interacting {{with a man who}} has it. Her pregnancy becomes high risk and she refuses treatment to protect the babies. Tylo said that this was [...] "a great way to bring awareness about the disease and the threat it poses to pregnant women". When Taylor dies in 2002, supervising producer Rhonda Friedman noted that Ridge refuses to accept the [...] "horrible reality", saying: [...] "He begs Taylor to come back to him. He just doesn't want to let go of this woman who he has loved for so many years, someone he say himself growing old with." [...] Devin Owens of Soap Opera Digest called Taylor Ridge's soulmate. Taylor's [...] "ghost" [...] visits Ridge in 2004 and encourages him to be with Brooke. Following Taylor's return to the show, her marriage to Ridge fell apart in 2006 and they divorce.
