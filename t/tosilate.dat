40|$|Background: Suplatast <b>tosilate</b> {{is a type}} 2 (Th 2) {{cytokine}} inhibitor {{that blocks}} the production of IgE antibodies and the invasion of tissues by eosinophils during an allergic reaction. Suplatast <b>tosilate</b> ameliorates asthma symptoms and airway hypersensitivity by inhibiting production of the Th 2 cytokines interleukin (IL) - 4 and IL- 5. Methods: In the present study, a comparative examination of the therapeutic effects of suplatast <b>tosilate</b> {{was carried out in}} patients with mild intermittent and mild persistent asthma by randomly allocating 35 adult patients to a suplatast <b>tosilate</b> group (n = 18; 100 mg suplatast <b>tosilate</b> three times daily) and a beclomethasone dipropionate (BDP) group (n = 17; 200 μg BDP twice daily) for 6 weeks of treatment. Results: The suplatast <b>tosilate</b> group required more time than the BDP group to show improvement in peak expiratory flow, but at week 6 the change from baseline was nearly the same in both groups. A significant improvement was observed for both groups in the peripheral blood eosinophil ratio, serum eosinophil cationic protein (ECP) levels, induced sputum ECP levels, forced expiratory volume in 1 second, and airway hypersensitivity, but induced sputum ECP level was lower in the BDP group than in the suplatast <b>tosilate</b> group. Total IgE levels decreased in the suplatast <b>tosilate</b> group only. Conclusions: We conclude that suplatast <b>tosilate</b> may be useful inlong-term management of mild bronchial asthma...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACTBackgroundThymus and activation-regulated {{chemokine}} (TARC/CCL 17) is {{a highly}} specific ligand for CCR 4. TARC {{may contribute to the}} recruitment, activation, and development of Th 2 polarized cells that express CCR 4. These characteristics have led investigators to hypothesize that TARC is involved in the development of Th 2 responses. Suplatast <b>tosilate</b> ((±) -[2 -[4 -(3 -ethoxy- 2 -hydroxy-propoxy) phenylcarbamoyl] ethyl] dimethylsulfonium p-toluenesulfonate) is an anti-allergic agent that selectively suppresses the synthesis of Th 2 cytokines. We examined the effect of suplatast <b>tosilate</b> on TARC production and CCR- 4 expression in vitro. Furthermore, we attempted to clarify whether TARC production was suppressed after clinical administration of suplatast <b>tosilate.</b> MethodsPeripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were isolated from patients with allergic rhinitis who tested positive to house dust. PBMCs were stimulated with mite antigen. TARC mRNA was detected by real time PCR. The amount of TARC was estimated using an ELISA kit. PBMCs expressing CCR- 4 were sorted by flow cytometry. The plasma level of TARC was examined in patients with chronic allergic rhinitis before and after treatment with suplatast <b>tosilate</b> for 4 weeks. ResultsSuplatast <b>tosilate</b> significantly reduced TARC production by PBMCs. TARC mRNA was also suppressed in a concentration dependent manner. However, suplatast <b>tosilate</b> did not inhibit the expression of CCR- 4 on PBMCs.

40|$|ABSTRACTThe airway wall of {{asthmatic}} {{patients is}} infiltrated with inflammatory cells, consisting chiefly of eosinophils and T lymphocytes. Among these T lymphocytes, Th 2 cells {{are involved in}} the regulation of the IgE immune response and local allergic inflammation, which underlie allergic diseases. Various cytokines produced and released by Th 2 cells play important roles in the development of many allergic diseases, including asthma, and the exacerbations of their disease states. Therefore, targeting of Th 2 cell-derived cytokines is a rational therapeutic strategy for the treatment of asthma. Corticosteroids and immunosuppressive agents can potently inhibit Th 2 cytokine-mediated responses, but have no selectivity for Th 2 cells: they also exert pharmacological activity against cells other than inflammatory cells, thereby potentially causing adverse side-effects. However, suplatast <b>tosilate</b> is the only specific Th 2 cytokine inhibitor that can be used clinically and it has been used widely in Japan as a maintenance drug in the treatment of asthma, atopic dermatitis and allergic rhinitis. There is considerable evidence of the effectiveness of suplatast <b>tosilate</b> in patients with mild asthma or moderate persistent asthma. Furthermore, an effect on cough variant asthma and a steroid-sparing effect have also been reported for suplatast <b>tosilate...</b>|$|E

In this study, the associations between the polymorphisms of genes related to the pathophysiology of AD and the efficacy of suplatast <b>tosilate,</b> an oral immunemodulator known to downregulate Th 2 -related allergic responses, were analyzed in adult patients with chronic AD. Patients were recruited from our previous study, where suplatast <b>tosilate</b> was evaluated for its efficacy when used in combination with topical steroids. The genotypes of 35 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of 27 genes related to AD pathogenesis were then determined in 17 responders and 18 non-responders, as defined by the improvement rate in their AD skin scores. While {{no significant difference in the}} patient background was observed between responders and non-responders, significant associations were noted between the response to treatment with suplatast <b>tosilate</b> and three SNPs of IL- 4 (- 590 C/T: P= 0. 04, - 33 C/T: P= 0. 04) and IL- 12 B (1188 A/C: P= 0. 03), but not for the other SNPs. Of note, ethnic differences in the genotype frequencies of IL- 4 - 590 C/T and IL- 12 B 1188 A/C SNPs were found. In conclusion, the present results raise the possibility that AD patients who tend to produce more IL- 4 and IL- 12 may be susceptible to suplatast <b>tosilate</b> treatment and that ethnic variations should be considered to further understand the role of Th 2 -related responses...|$|E

40|$|AbstractHistamine H 1 {{receptor}} (H 1 R) gene is upregulated {{in patients}} with pollinosis; its expression level is highly correlated with the nasal symptom severity. Antihistamines are widely used as allergy treatments because they inhibit histamine signaling by blocking H 1 R or suppressing H 1 R signaling as inverse agonists. However, long-term treatment with antihistamines does not completely resolve toluene- 2, 4 -diisocyanate (TDI) -induced nasal symptoms, although it can decrease H 1 R gene expression to the basal level, suggesting additional signaling {{is responsible for the}} pathogenesis of the allergic symptoms. Here, we show that treatment with suplatast <b>tosilate</b> in combination with antihistamines markedly alleviates nasal symptoms in TDI-sensitized rats. Suplatast suppressed TDI-induced upregulation of IL- 9 gene expression. Suplatast also suppressed ionomycin/phorbol- 12 -myristate- 13 -acetate-induced upregulation of IL- 2 gene expression in Jurkat cells, in which calcineurin (CN) /nuclear factor of activated T-cells (NFAT) signaling is known to be involved. Immunoblot analysis demonstrated that suplatast inhibited binding of NFAT to DNA. Furthermore, suplatast suppressed ionomycin-induced IL- 9 mRNA upregulation in RBL- 2 H 3 cells, in which CN/NFAT signaling is also involved. These data suggest that suplatast suppressed NFAT-mediated IL- 9 gene expression in TDI-sensitized rats and this might be the underlying mechanism of the therapeutic effects of combined therapy of suplatast with antihistamine...|$|E

We will report our recent work on the macrorheology, microrheology and nonlinear flow behaviour of dilute aqueous solutions of a surfactant CTAT (Cetyltrimethylammonium <b>Tosilate).</b> This system forms elongated micelles and exhibits strong viscoelasticity at low concentrations (∼ 0. 9 wt%) without the addition of electrolytes. Microrheology measurements of G(ω) have been done using diffusing wave spectroscopy which will be compared with the conventional frequency sweep measurements done using a cone and plate rheometer. The second part of the paper deals with the nonlinear rheology where the measured shear stress σ is a nonmonotonic function of the shear rate ˙γ. In stress-controlled experiments, the shear stress shows a plateau for ˙γ larger than some critical strain rate, similar to the earlier reports on CPyCl/NaSal system. Cates et al have proposed that the plateau is a signature of mechanical instability in the form of shear bands. We have carried out extensive experiments under controlled strain rate conditions, to study the time-dependence of shear stress. The measured time series of shear stress has been analysed in terms of correlation integrals and Lyapunov exponents to show unambiguously that the behaviour is typical of low-dimensional dynamical systems.

40|$|Phosphorescent {{materials}} have {{attracted much attention}} due to their promising applications in sensors, display, and optical imaging. Extensive studies have reported on trinuclear gold (I) complexes such as imidazolate, pyrazolate and carbeniete; however, triazolate is rarely reported. Although hydrophobic trinuclear gold (I) triazolate complex {{has been reported in}} a solid state with luminescence center at near infrared area (750 nm) at room temperature, but no example of phosphorescent amphiphilic trinuclear gold (I) triazolate complex with liquid crystalline properties has been reported for potential application in near infrared phosphorescent temperature sensor materials. Here we report the synthesis of triazole ligand bearing amphiphilic side chain and then use it for complexation with gold salt to form amphiphilic trinuclear gold (I) triazolate complex. Triazole ligand was prepared in six stepwise reactions from triethylene glycol (EG 3) to <b>tosilate</b> ethylene glycol (TsEG 3,step 1; 180 g, 90 %), mono substitution triethylene glycol with decanediol (C 10 EG 3 OH, step 2; 17 g, 43 %), bromination (C 10 EG 3 Br, step 3; 9 g, 45 %), Williamson ether substitution reaction (C 10 EG 3 BnCOOMe,step 4; 3. 5 g, 67 %), carboxylation (C 10 EG 3 COOH,step 5; 2 g, 80 %) and amidation (C 10 EG 3 TzH,step 6; 240 mg, 23 %). The resulting triazole ligand will be reacted with dimethylsulfide gold (I) chloride ([Au(SMe 2]Cl) in methanol in the presence of excess freshly distilled triethylamine (Et 3 N) to form the gold complex. The phosphorescent properties will be discussed later...|$|E
40|$|Background: : Exacerbations of {{bronchial}} asthma usually {{occur in the}} autumn. To our knowledge, however, the effectiveness of drugs for preventing exacerbations of asthma in the autumn has not been studied previously, except for leukotriene receptor antagonists and Omalizmab. Methods: : This study compared the prophylactic effectiveness of suplatast <b>tosilate</b> with that of mequitazine in children with asthma symptoms, which is usually exacerbated in the autumn. The study group comprised 27 children aged 2 to 15 years who required treatment for asthmatic attacks {{during the past year}} and tested positive at least for mite allergen in the preceding autumn. The subjects were randomly assigned to receive either suplatast or mequitazine. The primary endpoint of this study was the number of days without symptoms during the 8 weeks of treatment. In addition, the Japanese Pediatric Asthma Control Program (JPAC) scores were also recorded every 2 weeks in each group. Results: : Overall, 14 patients received suplatast, and 13 received mequitazine for 8 weeks from September through early October. During follow-up, the number of days without symptoms and the total JPAC scores did not differ significantly between the groups. However, as compared with weeks 1 to 2 of treatment, the mean number of days without symptoms during weeks 7 to 8 increased significantly in only the suplatast group (8. 6 vs. 11. 5 days; p = 0. 004). Conclusions: : Our results suggest that short-term additional treatment with suplatast is useful for preventing asthma symptoms in children with asthma, which is usually exacerbated in the autumn...|$|E

40|$|Background: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{identify}} the predictive factors, among laboratory test data and patient background variables, of an efficient response to the anti-allergic agent suplatast <b>tosilate</b> in patients with moderate to severe bronchial asthma. Methods: The subjects were 44 patients with moderate to severe bronchial asthma on inhaled steroid therapy who were enrolled in a phase II clinical trial of suplatast (300 and 600 mg/day). Improvements in respiratory function parameters and symptom scores during the first 4 weeks of administration of suplatast were assessed to evaluate the response to the drug. Logistic regression analysis was used to relate the response to the independent variables. Secondly, to test whether these results were applicable to clinical practice, we examined the data from a phase III clinical trial of suplatast. Results: Twenty-two patients were assessed as responders according to our criteria. The percentage of blood eosinophil (%EOS, P = 0. 015) and basophil (%BASO, P = 0. 019) counts were identified as significant variables to predict responders. When cut-off levels for %EOS and %BASO were set at 7. 5 and 1. 2, respectively, the sensitivity for prediction of responders with lower %EOS and %BASO was 81. 8 % (18 / 22). Furthermore, when we applied the same cut-off levels to subjects of a phase III clinical trial of suplatast, the sensitivity of prediction was found to be as high as 75. 0 % (6 / 8). Conclusions: These results indicate that %EOS and %BASO are good candidates to predict the response to suplatast among patients with moderate to severe bronchial asthma on inhaled steroid therapy. These predictors may contribute, in combination with genomic information, to stratified medical treatment tailored to the individual needs of patients...|$|E

They {{were divided into}} two groups (A and B) randomized by the envelope method. A was administered intravenously piperacillin (PIPC) 2 g once after surgery, and twice on the following day. B was similarly administered PIPC intravenously, followed by oral administration of tosufloxacin <b>tosilate</b> (TFLX) 300 mg twice daily from the second to the fifth day. Of the total of 135 cases, 104, 45 in A and 59 in B, conformed to the patient standards established for analysis. Efficacy was assessed by the primary physician and also according to a unified standard in which the onset of a post-surgical infection and a bacteriuria of 10 (4) or greater CFU/ml observed ten days after surgery were regarded as ineffective. An intergroup statistically significant difference was not observed in the efficacy rate assessed by the primary physician. However, according to the unified standard assessment, B showed a significantly higher efficacy rate (88. 1 %) than A (62. 2 %). The administration of TFLX following PIPC was useful. With an indwelling catheter, B exhibited a significantly greater efficacy rate when the retention period was four days or longer. The efficacy was greater in both groups if lavage was not performed, and this effect was greater in A. Consequently, the administration of TFLX was considered more useful for long-term indwelling catheter cases. Neither serious side effects, nor clinical test abnormalities were observed in this study...|$|E
