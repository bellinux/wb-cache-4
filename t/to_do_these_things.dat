5|$|In Katherine Buetow's {{guide to}} the Australian Cattle Dog, Ian Dunbar {{makes the point that}} while people think of dog {{training}} as teaching a dog to sit, speak and roll over, the dog already knows how <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>these</b> <b>things.</b> Training, he says, involves teaching the dog that {{it is a good idea}} <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>these</b> <b>things</b> when a particular word is said or signal is given. He goes on to explain his belief that training is about opening communication channels, so that the dog knows what the handler wants it to do, and knows that it will be worth its while to do it. Consequences for the dog can be rewards for doing what is required, as recommended by Dunbar, or corrections where an unwanted behaviour is performed. Like other working breeds, the Australian Cattle Dog is intelligent and responsive; both of these traits can be an advantage in training where a structured, varied program is used, but can lead to unwanted outcomes if training is not consistent, or is repetitive and boring for the dog. Stock dog trainer Scott Lithgow recommends making training a game so the Cattle Dog learns that obedience leads to enjoyment. Many of a Cattle Dog's natural behaviours are undesirable in a pet: barking, chewing, chasing, digging, defending territory, and nipping heels. Training, therefore, involves helping the dog adopt a lifestyle that is probably very different from that of its droving ancestors. The Australian Cattle Dog is biddable, and responds well to training.|$|E
5|$|The royal {{prerogative}} is in much {{use in the}} realm of foreign affairs. It is the monarch who recognises foreign states (although several statutes regulate the immunities enjoyed by their heads and diplomatic representatives), issues declarations of war and peace, and forms international treaties. The monarch also has the power to annexe territory, as was done in 1955 with the island of Rockall. Once territory has been annexed, the monarch has complete discretion as {{to the extent to which}} the government will take over the former government's liabilities; this was confirmed in West Rand Central Gold Mining Company v The King. The monarch also has the power to alter British territorial waters and cede territory. Her freedom <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>these</b> <b>things</b> in practice is doubtful, in that they might deprive British citizens of their nationality and rights. When the island of Heligoland was ceded to Germany in 1890, Parliamentary approval was first sought. The monarch can also regulate colonies and dependent territories by exercising the prerogative through Orders in Council. The courts have long fought against the monarch's use of this power: in R (Bancoult) v Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs (No 2), the Court of Appeal ruled that using Orders-in-Council to frustrate judicial rulings was an unlawful abuse of power, although this ruling was later overturned.|$|E
25|$|If {{the wife}} dies, {{even if not}} due to illness, the Talmud's stipulations require the husband to arrange, and pay for, her burial; the burial must, {{in the opinion of}} the Talmud, be one {{conducted}} in a manner befitting the husband's social status, and in accordance with the local custom. Prominent rabbis of the Middle Ages clarified this, stating that the husband must make any provisions required by local burial customs, potentially including the hiring of mourners and the erection of a tombstone. According to the Talmud, and later rabbinic writers, if the husband was absent, or refused <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>these</b> <b>things,</b> a rabbinical court should arrange the wife's funeral, selling some of the husband's property in order to defray the costs.|$|E

500|$|If a {{defendant}} {{at the time}} of trial claims he is insane, this hinges on whether or not he is able to understand the charge, the difference between [...] "guilty" [...] and [...] "not guilty" [...] and is able to instruct his lawyers. If he is unable <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>these</b> <b>things,</b> he can be found [...] "unfit to plead" [...] under Section 4 of the Criminal Procedure (Insanity) Act 1964. In that situation, the judge has wide discretion as to {{what to do with the}} defendant, except in cases of murder, where he must be detained in hospital.|$|E
500|$|According to the literature, {{it appears}} that the {{majority}} of free Athenians owned at least one slave. Aristophanes, in Plutus, portrays poor peasants who have several slaves; Aristotle defines a house as containing freemen and slaves. Conversely, not owning even one slave was a clear sign of poverty. In the celebrated discourse of Lysias For the Invalid, a cripple pleading for a pension explains [...] "my income is very small and now I'm required <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>these</b> <b>things</b> myself and do not even have the means to purchase a slave who can do these things for me." [...] However, the huge slave populations of the Romans were unknown in ancient Greece. When Athenaeus cites the case of Mnason, friend of Aristotle and owner of a thousand slaves, this appears to be exceptional. Plato, owner of five slaves {{at the time of his}} death, describes the very rich as owning 50 slaves.|$|E

2500|$|For Barruel, {{the final}} designs of the {{coalition}} of the philosophes, the Freemasons and the Illuminati were achieved by the Jacobins. These clubs were formed by [...] "the adepts of impiety, the adepts of rebellion, and the adepts of anarchy" [...] working together to implement their radical agenda. Their guiding philosophy and actions were {{the culmination of the}} conspiracy as they directly wanted to end the monarchy and the church. Barruel believed that the only difference between the Jacobins and their precursors was that the Jacobins actually brought down the church and the throne and were able to institute their basic beliefs and goals while their precursors only desired <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>these</b> <b>things</b> without much success.|$|E

2500|$|Around 1910, {{while he}} was working in Wilmington, Delaware, Fish met a 19-year-old man named Thomas Kedden. He took Kedden {{to where he was}} staying, and the two began a sadomasochistic relationship; it is unclear whether or not Fish forced Kedden <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>these</b> <b>things,</b> but in his {{confession}} he implies that the man was intellectually disabled. After ten days, Fish took Kedden to [...] "an old farm house", where he began to torture him. The torture took place over two weeks. Fish eventually tied Kedden up and cut off half of his penis. [...] "I shall never forget his scream, or the look he gave me," [...] Fish later recalled. He originally intended to kill Kedden, cut up his body, and take it home, but he feared the hot weather would draw attention to him; instead, Fish poured peroxide over the wound, wrapped it in a Vaseline-covered handkerchief, left a $10 bill, kissed Kedden goodbye, and left. [...] "Took first train I could get back home. Never heard what become of him, or tried to find out," [...] Fish said.|$|E
2500|$|Randi {{has been}} accused of {{actually}} using [...] "psychic powers" [...] to perform acts such as spoon bending. According to James Alcock, at a meeting where Randi was duplicating the performances of Uri Geller, a professor from the University at Buffalo shouted out that Randi was a fraud. Randi said: [...] "Yes, indeed, I'm a trickster, I'm a cheat, I'm a charlatan, that's what I do for a living. Everything I've done here was by trickery." [...] The professor shouted back: [...] "That's not what I mean. You're a fraud because you're pretending <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>these</b> <b>things</b> through trickery, but you're actually using psychic powers and misleading us by not admitting it." [...] A similar event involved Senator Claiborne Pell, a confirmed believer in psychic phenomena. When Randi personally demonstrated to Pell that he could reveal—by simple trickery—a concealed drawing that had been secretly made by the senator, Pell refused to believe that it was a trick, saying: [...] "I think Randi may be a psychic and doesn't realize it." [...] Randi has consistently denied having any paranormal powers or abilities.|$|E

[...] The Chicago Tribune noted that Anderson's [...] "clear, bright upper range was at its clarion best, the soprano singing with strength and nuanced sensitivity" [...] and hailed her acting as well: [...] "ramatically, Anderson was exceptional, drawing {{out all of the}} conflicting emotions with an intensity tempered by dignity." [...] Later in 1997, she returned to the Opera Orchestra of New York to portray her first Elvira in Verdi's Ernani. [...] In 1998, Anderson spoke in Opera News of her move away from light coloratura roles [...] "into deeper water":I wanted to put it off as long as possible. I kept saying, and it's been quoted so many times, I didn't want to do [...] "Normina." [...] I wanted to do Norma. And Leonora. I didn't want to sound like a soubrette trying <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>these</b> <b>things.</b> I've done things like Il Corsaro and La Battaglia di Legnano very early in my career, so Verdi's always been a presence.
