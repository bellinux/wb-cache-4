5|$|A {{ceremony}} of dedication {{was held on}} the afternoon of October 28, 1886. President Grover Cleveland, the former New York governor, presided over the event. On the morning of the dedication, a parade was held in New York City; {{estimates of the number of}} people who watched it ranged from several hundred thousand to a million. President Cleveland headed the procession, then stood in the reviewing stand to see bands and marchers from across America. General Stone was the grand marshal of the parade. The route began at Madison Square, once the venue for the arm, and proceeded to the Battery at the southern tip of Manhattan by way of Fifth Avenue and Broadway, with a slight detour so the parade could pass in front of the World building on Park Row. As the parade passed the New York Stock Exchange, traders threw ticker <b>tape</b> <b>from</b> the windows, beginning the New York tradition of the ticker-tape parade.|$|E
5|$|After the FBI {{finds out}} that they believe Michael {{is going to try}} and break Sara out of prison they contact Mahone. Mahone is offered his old job back with the FBI if he agrees to give them {{credible}} information that leads to proof of Michael's plans. Mahone gives up the blind spot in the cameras that Michael had found, which the FBI fixes and then demands more information from Mahone. Mahone eventually decides not to turn his back on Michael but instead to use the connection to his advantage. Mahone informs the FBI that Michael is going to parachute into the prison, and when a dummy is parachuted into the prison Michael has enough of a distraction to break Sara out. Once Sara has escaped safely, Mahone gives her and Lincoln a <b>tape</b> <b>from</b> Michael that explained why he sacrificed himself for Sara.|$|E
5|$|Henry {{enters the}} cave and is locked in. He escapes through another exit, and discovers a place used by Brian to escape his father. Henry goes deeper into the cave with the {{climbing}} equipment left at Brian's camp, and discovers Brian's corpse {{at the bottom of}} a cavern, piled under rocks. Delilah is upset, blaming herself for allowing Brian to stay. The next day, a conflagration grows uncontrollably and an emergency evacuation order is given out to all lookouts. As Henry prepares, he follows the tracking device's signal to a cassette <b>tape</b> <b>from</b> Ned, who claims that Brian's death was because of climbing inexperience. Unwilling to return to society, Ned admits to living in the wilderness and is trekking deeper, advising against following him. Henry finds Ned's camp with items from the watchtowers, camp and the teenage girls, whom Delilah confirms are safe and sound. The government camp was studying wildlife, with Ned using radio equipment to deter Henry. Delilah states that a rescue helicopter is waiting for him at Thorofare Lookout and he treks there to find Delilah gone, having taken another helicopter. Using the radio equipment, he contacts her one final time and asks when he will see her again. She tells him to go back to his wife and Henry boards a helicopter heading home.|$|E

25|$|On formal {{occasions}} women too wear a taovala, or {{more often}} a kiekie, a string skirt {{attached to a}} waistband. It is lighter and cooler than a mat. Kiekie are made from many different materials, from the traditional (pandanus leaves, as used in mats) to the innovative (unspooled magnetic <b>tape</b> <b>from</b> tape cassettes).|$|E
25|$|Although {{electric}} typewriters {{would not}} achieve widespread popularity until {{nearly a century}} later, the basic groundwork for the electric typewriter was laid by the Universal Stock Ticker, invented by Thomas Edison in 1870. This device remotely printed letters and numbers on a stream of paper <b>tape</b> <b>from</b> input generated by a specially designed typewriter {{at the other end}} of a telegraph line.|$|E

The intensity of X-ray triboluminescence is sufficient for it to be used as a source for X-ray imaging.|$|E

25|$|The {{relationship}} between the two blossoms, despite red <b>tape</b> <b>from</b> social workers (who ultimately rally to Henry's side). As their day in court approaches, the state forces Punky to stay at Fenster Hall, a shelter for orphaned and abandoned children, which makes her realize how close she has grown to Henry. Finally, their day arrives, and the court approves Henry to become Punky's foster father. Later on, Henry legally adopts her.|$|E
25|$|Scott struggled, but {{was held}} down and handcuffed {{by the three}} men, gagged with duct <b>tape</b> <b>from</b> ear to ear, and had his ankles tied with rope. As he lay face down and with his cuffed hands beneath his body, one of the men, {{weighing}} 300 pounds, sat {{on top of his}} back. Scott's legs, upper body and back had sustained multiple bruises and abrasions from being dragged to the van across stairs, floors and a patio.|$|E
25|$|On August 5, 1974, the White House {{released}} a previously unknown audio <b>tape</b> <b>from</b> June 23, 1972.

25|$|The {{brothers}} {{considered the}} period between 2002–2005 to be their most creative and successful, exploring various different media for the shorts, and having a large quantity of merchandise. Matt considered a day in February 2004 to be {{the highlight of the}} series, having received a demo <b>tape</b> <b>from</b> They Might Be Giants for a song to use in a Strong Bad Email short, and a life-size replica of Tom Servo from Mystery Science Theater 3000 producer Jim Mallon on the same day. They also reflected on how Homestar Runner had been a common point of reference over which newly formed couples bonded, and how Joss Whedon incorporated references to Homestar Runner into his television shows Buffy the Vampire Slayer and Angel as further signs of success.|$|E
25|$|In most cassettes, the {{magnetic}} tape {{is attached to}} each spool with a leader, usually made of strong plastic. This leader protected the weaker magnetic <b>tape</b> <b>from</b> the shock occurring when the tape reached the end. Leaders can be complex: a plastic slide-in wedge anchors a short fully opaque plastic tape to the take-up hub; one or more tinted semi-opaque plastic segments follow; the clear leader (a tintless semi-opaque plastic segment) follows, which wraps almost {{all the way around}} the supply reel, before splicing to {{the magnetic}} tape itself. The clear leader spreads the shock load to a long stretch of tape instead of to the microscopic splice. Various patents have been issued detailing leader construction and associated tape player mechanisms to detect leaders. Cassette tape users would also use spare leaders to repair broken tapes.|$|E
25|$|Shahzad is {{believed}} to have bought the 1993 Nissan Pathfinder on April 24, a week prior to the attempted bombing. The vehicle had been listed in an online Craigslist ad, and he reportedly bought it from a female Connecticut college student for $1,300 (negotiated down from $1,800), which he paid in $100 bills. He reportedly exchanged the cash for the car at a Connecticut shopping center parking lot, where he inspected the interior and cargo area (but not the engine) and declined the offer of a bill of sale. He later had the car windows tinted, which made it harder to peer inside. A surveillance <b>tape</b> <b>from</b> the parking lot shows Shahzad test-driving the car, according to the FBI. He bought a second vehicle through Craigslist (a black Isuzu Rodeo) from a mechanic in Stratford, Connecticut.|$|E

25|$|David {{is still}} {{concerned}} over how his father died, {{and as he}} gives Snow encouragement to teach again, he visits Gold and makes a deal with him. David visits Belle and tells her about the deal and then gives Belle the gift. At the same time, Snow {{comes up with a}} plan to help Jekyll, and later shows Regina a lab located in Whale's garage to prepare the plans to stop the Evil Queen. Later that night, Snow tells David not to seek revenge on what happened to his father as he reads a note over a candle. The note reveals that David's father was murdered in a cart accident. Belle listened to the <b>tape</b> <b>from</b> Gold. Back at the mental hospital, The Evil Queen visits Hyde again, and uses her magic to free him from the cuffs and they walk out of the cell together, linking arms.|$|E
25|$|After {{having his}} cabaret card restored, Monk relaunched his New York career with a {{landmark}} six-month residency at the Five Spot Cafe in the East Village neighborhood of New York beginning in June 1957, leading a quartet with John Coltrane on tenor saxophone, Wilbur Ware on bass, and Shadow Wilson on drums. Little of this group's music was documented owing to contractual problems: Coltrane was signed to Prestige at the time, but Monk refused {{to return to}} his former label. One studio session by the quartet was made for Riverside, three tunes which were not released until 1961 by the subsidiary label Jazzland along with outtakes from a larger group recording with Coltrane and Hawkins, those results appearing in 1957 as the album Monk's Music. An amateur <b>tape</b> <b>from</b> the Five Spot (a later September 1958 reunion with Coltrane sitting in for Johnny Griffin) was issued on Blue Note in 1993; and a recording of the quartet performing at a Carnegie Hall concert on November 29 was recorded in high fidelity by Voice of America engineers, rediscovered {{in the collection of the}} Library of Congress in 2005 and released by Blue Note.|$|E
25|$|A tape gag {{involves}} the use of sticky tape sealing the mouth shut. Commonly used types of tape include duct tape, gaffer tape and PVC <b>tape</b> <b>from</b> two to three inches wide. Tape gags are often the simplest of gags to apply. If the wearer blows while the tape is on it makes it easier to remove (as they can chew it off), making it not the most effective gag. To better secure the tape, a long strip of tape can be wrapped around {{the lower part of the}} person's head. A strip from ear to ear under the jaw restricts jaw movement, making the gag more effective. However, the tape can cause the skin on the lips to be ripped off and it can irritate the lips and cause fever blisters in those who have dormant fever blisters or cold sores. If left on for long, it will cause the wearer pain for the tape to be removed from their mouth. The tape can also rip hair off when wrapped around the head, despite making the gag more difficult to get off. The longer the tape is left on, the harder and more painful it is to later remove from the skin.|$|E

25|$|Since police detectives {{initially}} {{seemed to}} be unhelpful to Lieberman and assumed that Philip had died with the other victims, he hired Gallant, who found two pieces of evidence suggesting {{that she may have}} returned to the apartment building early on the morning of September 11. The first was the call from the home phone to Lieberman's cell; the second was some videotape from the security cameras in the lobby. Timestamped at 8:43a.m., just 3 minutes before American Airlines Flight 11 was crashed into the North Tower, and within the 7-9 a.m. timeframe during which, Lieberman later testified, Philip always returned after her nights out, it shows a woman entering the building, waiting near the elevator and leaving after a few minutes. Due to the poor contrast from the sunlight in the lobby, she was visible only in silhouette, but her hair and dress are consistent with Philip as seen in the Century 21 <b>tape</b> <b>from</b> the previous evening. Her family also says the woman exhibits similar mannerisms. She is, however, not carrying any of the bags that she would have had from her shopping trip, and again she is apparently unaccompanied. Lieberman could not positively identify her as his wife, but a city police investigator believes it was her.|$|E
25|$|In November 1996, Mike Eidson, a Miami attorney, {{said in an}} {{interview}} that many of the passengers had survived the initial impact but had drowned afterward. Eidson represented 41 passengers and crew in a lawsuit contending that the aircraft's manufacturer, Boeing, bore responsibility for the disaster, as the company ought to have foreseen the misuse of its products. The suit was filed against Boeing in federal court in Miami in May 1997. According to the complaint, the flightdeck errors were caused by careless maintenance by Aeroperú and negligence and defective design by Boeing. Boeing argued that it was not at fault, and that responsibility for the accident lay with the employee who did not remove the <b>tape</b> <b>from</b> the static ports, and the aircraft's pilot for not noticing the tape still applied by visual check. Richard Rodriguez of the NTSB said that it was understandable that Schreiber did not find the tape because the maintenance worker had used duct tape instead of the brightly colored tape that he was supposed to use. In addition, Rodriguez said that the pitot-static ports were high above the ground. Therefore, Schreiber could not have seen the tape against the fuselage. After extensive litigation, the parties agreed to transfer the case against Boeing and Aeroperú to an international arbitration in Santiago, Chile, for a determination of the damages. The defendants agreed not to contest liability in Chile.|$|E
