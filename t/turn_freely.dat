25|$|When skeining from wheel spun yarn, the bobbin {{can either}} {{be removed from the}} wheel and placed on a kate, or skeined {{directly}} from the wheel. If the bobbin is left on the wheel the tension on the drive band must be lessened in order to allow the bobbin to <b>turn</b> <b>freely.</b> Yarn spun on spindles {{can either be}} left on the spindle, or slipped onto a dowel for plying. The spindle or dowel is either placed in a lazy kate, or even a bowl to keep the spindle in one place while winding off the yarn.|$|E
500|$|The southeastern {{bridge is}} the longer of the two, at [...] long. It {{is made up}} of 11 spans, each made up of nine welded plate girders, with a [...] {{relieving}} span at each end. The north-western bridge is shorter, at only [...] in length, and {{is made up of}} five spans with a [...] relieving span at each end. The bridge decks are of reinforced concrete supported by the plate girders, which are in <b>turn</b> <b>freely</b> supported by the concrete piers.|$|E
2500|$|In the mid-tenth century, Archpriest Leo of Naples {{translated}} into Latin a second-century Greek Alexander romance falsely attributed to Callisthenes. [...] This new translation was later supplemented by other material (from sources including Orosius's Historia adversus paganos) and, in its expanded form, {{came to be}} known as the Historia de preliis. [...] It is this Latin version that was, in its <b>turn,</b> <b>freely</b> {{translated into}} the Old French text known as the Roman d'Alexandre en prose (Alexander Romance in Prose), borrowing at times from other sources, including the verse Roman d'Alexandre. [...] The prose romance dates to the thirteenth century. [...] There are three major recensions of the text, where subsequent editors either added supplements or made excisions.|$|E
50|$|In 1869, a small {{three-wheeled}} vehicle {{propelled by}} a horizontal twin cylinder engine which drove the rear axle by spur-gearing; only one rear wheel was driven, the other <b>turning</b> <b>freely</b> on the axle. A vertical fire-tube boiler was mounted {{at the rear}} with a polished copper casing over the fire box and chimney; the boiler was enclosed in a mahogany casing. The front wheel was used for steering and the weight was only 19 cwt.|$|R
50|$|There {{are various}} types of blocks {{that are used in}} sailing. Some blocks are used to {{increase}} mechanical advantage and others are used simply to change the direction of a line. A ratchet block <b>turns</b> <b>freely</b> when a line is pulled in one direction but does not turn the other direction, although the line may slip past the sheave. This kind of block makes a loaded line easier to hold by hand, and is sometimes used on smaller boats for lines like main and jib sheets that are frequently adjusted.|$|R

60|$|Swivel.--The woodcut {{shows how}} a {{makeshift}} swivel can be fitted to a tether rope. Without one, the rope will be twisted almost up to a knot by the horse walking {{round and round}} his picket peg; with one, the rope will <b>turn</b> <b>freely</b> in the hole, through which its large knotted head prevents it from being drawn.|$|E
60|$|King John {{would be}} {{represented}} in a modern play or novel {{as a kind of}} degenerate; a shifty-eyed moral maniac with a twist in his soul's backbone and green blood in his veins. The mediaevals were quite capable of boiling him in melted lead, but they would have been quite incapable of despairing of his soul in the modern fashion. A striking a fortiori case is that of the strange mediaeval legend of Robert the Devil. Robert was represented as a monstrous birth sent to an embittered woman actually in answer to prayers to Satan, and his earlier actions are simply those of the infernal fire let loose upon earth. Yet though he can be called almost literally a child of hell, yet the climax of the story is his repentance at Rome and his great reparation. That is the paradox of mediaeval morals: as it must appear to the moderns. We must try to conceive a race of men who hated John, and sought his blood, and believed every abomination about him, who would have been quite capable of assassinating or torturing him in the extremity of their anger. And yet we must admit that they would not really have been fundamentally surprised if he had shaved his head in humiliation, given all his goods to the poor, embraced the lepers in a lazar-house, and been canonised as a saint in heaven. So strongly did they hold that the pivot of Will should <b>turn</b> <b>freely,</b> which now is rusted, and sticks.|$|E
50|$|For {{gearboxes}} in general, gear clusters {{mounted on}} a layshaft may either <b>turn</b> <b>freely</b> on a fixed shaft, or {{may be part of}} a shaft that then rotates in bearings. There may be multiple separate clusters on a shared shaft and these are allowed to <b>turn</b> <b>freely</b> relative to each other.|$|E
40|$|Case StudyAn axially split, opposed impeller, {{high speed}} water {{injection}} pump ran well for several months. Head, capacity and efficiency started to degrade markedly, but the pump <b>turned</b> <b>freely</b> and was relatively smooth. It was disassembled and inspected. All the wear parts, impellers, casing and other components were in like new condition. The impellers were underfiled and the pump returned to service - {{with the same}} unacceptable performance results. A thermal image camera was used to check for hot or cold spots and those images will be presented. The detected hotspot resulted in a bore scope inspection of the cross over passage, and uncovered {{the cause of the}} performance problem...|$|R
50|$|In 2008, Francione opposed California's Proposition 2, {{which was}} a ballot {{proposition}} to prohibit the confinement of certain farm animals {{in a manner that}} does not allow them to <b>turn</b> around <b>freely,</b> lie down, stand up, and fully extend their limbs.|$|R
5000|$|Pulleys were {{constructed}} of wood, iron, steel {{or a combination}} thereof. Varying sizes of pulleys were used in conjunction to change the speed of rotation. For example a 40" [...] pulley at 100 rpm would turn a 20" [...] pulley at 200 rpm. Pulleys solidly attached ("fast") to the shaft could be combined with adjacent pulleys that <b>turned</b> <b>freely</b> ("loose") on the shaft (idlers). In this configuration the belt could be maneuvered onto the idler to stop power transmission or onto the solid pulley to convey the power. This arrangement was often used near machines to provide a means of shutting the machine off when not in use. Usually at the last belt feeding power to a machine, a pair of stepped pulleys {{could be used to}} give a variety of speed settings for the machine.|$|R

50|$|In January 2014, Ulver {{collaborated with}} Norway’s National Theatre, {{providing}} the soundtrack to Demoner 2014 (translated Demons 2014); {{based on a}} text by Geir Gulliksen, in <b>turn</b> <b>freely</b> based on the Dostoyevsky novel Demons, also known as The Possessed, the play premiered on February 8, 2014.|$|E
50|$|The fluid {{bearings}} are pads {{with holes}} through which pressurized inert gas (such as helium) or oil presses against the spherical {{shell of the}} platform. The fluid bearings are very slippery, and the spherical platform can <b>turn</b> <b>freely.</b> There are usually four bearing pads, mounted in a tetrahedral arrangement to support the platform.|$|E

2500|$|Other sculptural objects {{include two}} model chariots in gold, one in{{complete}}, plus figures {{of a horse}} and a rider that may belong to this or other model groups, as may two other horses cut out from sheet gold. [...] The wheels of the complete chariot would originally have <b>turned</b> <b>freely,</b> and it had received at least one repair in antiquity. [...] It is pulled by four horses (rather small, and with only nine legs surviving between them) and carries two figures, a driver and a seated passenger, both wearing torcs. [...] The chariot has handrails at the open rear to assist getting in and out, while the solid front carries {{the face of the}} protective Egyptian dwarf-god Bes. [...] A leaping ibex was probably the handle of an amphora-type vase, and compares with handles shown on tribute vessels in the Persepolis reliefs, as well as an example now in the Louvre.|$|R
50|$|The {{proposition}} adds {{a chapter}} to Division 20 of the California Health and Safety Code, Sections 25990-25994, to prohibit the confinement of certain farm animals {{in a manner}} that does not allow them to <b>turn</b> around <b>freely,</b> lie down, stand up, and fully extend their limbs. The measure deals with three types of confinement: veal crates, battery cages, and sow gestation crates.|$|R
50|$|The {{design of}} a tubular lock {{is similar to the}} pin tumbler lock, in that there are several stacks of pins. The key is a {{cylinder}} shape with notches cut around the outer or (rarely) inner edge. Each of these notches depresses a single pin inside the lock to a specific height allowing the lock cylinder to <b>turn</b> <b>freely.</b>|$|E
50|$|Edgar wrote a golf book {{entitled}} The Gate to Golf, {{based on his}} discoveries made in England. Edgar had an ailing hip which he could not <b>turn</b> <b>freely.</b> Through experimentation, he found that a restricted hip turn still allowed a repeatable swing with excellent power and control. This book proved to have significant impact on golf instruction, {{right up to the}} present time.|$|E
50|$|The smaller {{sustainer}} {{engines are}} usually not equipped with a throttle, but instead have a cable to open decompression valves in each cylinder to allow the engine to <b>turn</b> <b>freely</b> for starting. Sustainer engines are typically two-stroke two-cylinder air-cooled engines {{in the range of}} 18-30 hp (14-22 kW). They are lighter in weight, and simpler to operate than self-launching powerplants.|$|E

50|$|The U-shaped crank has {{a wooden}} spindle on it and—along {{with the top}} spindle—is allowed to <b>freely</b> <b>turn</b> under the hands without {{producing}} {{wear and tear on}} the hands (thus, no blisters).|$|R
50|$|In a drive suspension, the knuckle has no spindle, {{but rather}} has a hub into which is affixed the {{bearings}} and shaft {{of the drive}} mechanism. The end of the drive mechanism would then have the necessary mounting studs for the wheel/tire and/or brake assembly. Therefore, the wheel assembly would rotate as the drive shaft (or half-shaft) dictates. It would not <b>turn</b> <b>freely</b> by itself, {{but only if the}} shaft was disengaged from the transaxle or differential.|$|E
5000|$|A {{freeboard}} typically has 6 wheels - four normal longboard-style wheels at {{each corner}} and two spring-locked center wheels. The wheels {{on the central}} axis are able to <b>turn</b> <b>freely</b> in all directions, allowing the board to [...] "slide" [...] laterally provided none of the four corner wheels are touching the ground. This mimics the traditional [...] "side-to-side" [...] motion of snowboard riding. By exerting pressure on the corner wheels, the rider is {{able to control the}} board.|$|E
5000|$|Wheel and axle motion (e.g. screwdrivers, doorknobs): A {{wheel is}} {{essentially}} a lever with one arm {{the distance between the}} axle and the outer point of the wheel, and the other the radius of the axle. Typically this is a fairly large difference, leading to a proportionately large mechanical advantage. This allows even simple wheels with wooden axles running in wooden blocks to still <b>turn</b> <b>freely,</b> because their friction is overwhelmed by the rotational force of the wheel multiplied by the mechanical advantage.|$|E
50|$|An SK {{spokesman}} {{stated that}} Razvozzhayev {{had not been}} abducted, but had <b>turned</b> himself in <b>freely</b> and volunteered a confession of his conspiracy with Udaltsov and Lebedev to cause widespread rioting. The spokesman stated that the torture allegations would be investigated.|$|R
2500|$|Farm Sanctuary has {{successfully}} banned various confinement systems of farm animals by supporting voter referendums. In 2002, Farm Sanctuary {{was part of}} a coalition of groups that comprised Floridians for Humane Farms, which sponsored the initiative that amended the Florida Constitution to limit the [...] "cruel and inhumane confinement of pigs during pregnancy." [...] The measure, which passed with 55 percent approval, outlaws caging pigs in gestation stalls, which are metal enclosures that measure two feet across and prevent sows from <b>turning</b> around <b>freely.</b>|$|R
5000|$|A soft {{dead center}} {{is used in}} the {{headstock}} spindle as the work rotates with the centre. Because the centre is soft it can be trued in place before use. The included angle is 60°. Traditionally, a hard dead center is used together with suitable lubricant in the tailstock to support the workpiece. In modern practice the dead center is frequently replaced by a live center, as it <b>turns</b> <b>freely</b> with the workpiece [...] - [...] usually on ball bearings [...] - [...] reducing the frictional heat, especially important at high speeds. When clear facing a long length of material it must be supported at both ends. This can be achieved by the use of a traveling or fixed steady. If a steady is not available, the end face being worked on may be supported by a dead (stationary) half center. A half center has a flat surface machined across a broad section of half of its diameter at the pointed end. A small section of the tip of the dead center is retained to ensure concentricity. Lubrication must be applied at this point of contact and tail stock pressure reduced. A lathe carrier or lathe dog may also be employed when turning between two centers.|$|R
50|$|The southeastern {{bridge is}} the longer of the two, at 737 ft long. It {{is made up}} of 11 spans, each made up of nine welded plate girders, with a 33 ft {{relieving}} span at each end. The north-western bridge is shorter, at only 382 ft in length, and {{is made up of}} five spans with a 35 ft relieving span at each end. The bridge decks are of reinforced concrete supported by the plate girders, which are in <b>turn</b> <b>freely</b> supported by the concrete piers.|$|E
5000|$|The {{balanced}} propeller, {{with four}} to eight blades, rotates inside a protective ring. The position of a lever controls the propeller. In down position the propeller is stopped and the instrument is lowered, after which reaching the desired depth a weight called a messenger is dropped to move the lever into the middle position which allows the propeller to <b>turn</b> <b>freely.</b> When the measurement has been taken another weight is dropped to push the level to its highest position at which the propeller is again stopped.|$|E
50|$|The Puckle gun {{was fired}} {{in a similar fashion}} to a {{conventional}} flintlock musket; however, after each shot, a crank on the threaded shaft at the rear would be unscrewed to release the cylinder to <b>turn</b> <b>freely.</b> The cylinder would then be advanced by hand to the next chamber, and the crank turned back again to lock the cylinder into the breech of the fixed barrel. The flintlock mechanism could then be primed for another shot: it was triggered using a lever which was separate from the crank assembly.|$|E
50|$|The {{structure}} of a Soplet is formally defined by the stereotype it implements. This stereotype may be individually composed of several aspects (such as Translatable, Beanable, Bindable, Testable etc.), which in <b>turn</b> may be <b>freely</b> defined by the developer (or which {{are part of a}} framework which he uses).|$|R
5000|$|... "Inoperable" [...] may be {{considered}} synonymous with [...] "locked"; the locked handle may be immovable, or it may <b>freely</b> <b>turn</b> but without opening the door.
