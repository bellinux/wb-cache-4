5|$|Schaffer in Social Development (1996) {{suggests}} that the father–child relationship is primarily a cultural construction shaped by the requirements of each society. In societies where the care of infants has been assigned to boys rather <b>than</b> <b>girls,</b> no difference in nurturing capacity was found. Other studies, however, point in the opposite direction.|$|E
5|$|Globally, {{autism is}} {{estimated}} to affect 24.8 million people as of 2015. As of 2010, {{the number of people}} affected is estimated at about 1–2 per 1,000 worldwide. It occurs four to five times more often in boys <b>than</b> <b>girls.</b> About 1.5% of children in the United States (one in 68) are diagnosed with ASD , a 30% increase from one in 88 in 2012. The rate of autism among adults aged 18 years and over in the United Kingdom is 1.1%. The number of people diagnosed has been increasing dramatically since the 1980s, partly due to changes in diagnostic practice; the question of whether actual rates have increased is unresolved.|$|E

25|$|Anti-gay {{groups have}} often argued that more {{homosexual}} men are sexual abusers than heterosexuals, {{on the grounds}} that a third of abusers target boys rather <b>than</b> <b>girls.</b> This is far in excess of the proportion of gay men in the population.

25|$|Boys have {{a higher}} chance for being {{diagnosed}} with autism <b>than</b> <b>girls.</b> The ASD sex ratio averages 4.3:1 and is greatly modified by cognitive impairment: it may be close to 2:1 with mental retardation and more than 5.5:1 without. Recent studies have found no association with socioeconomic status, and have reported inconsistent results about associations with race or ethnicity.|$|E
50|$|Osgood-Schlatter disease {{generally}} {{occurs in}} {{boys and girls}} aged 9-16 coinciding with periods of growth spurts. It occurs more frequently in boys <b>than</b> in <b>girls,</b> with reports of a male-to-female ratio ranging from 3:1 to as high as 7:1. It {{has been suggested that}} difference is related to a greater participation by boys in sports and risk activities <b>than</b> by <b>girls.</b>|$|R
40|$|This study {{examined}} the relationship of race and rural/urban setting to physical, behavioral, psychosocial, and environmental factors associated with physical activity. Subjects included 1, 668 eighth-grade girls from 31 middle schools: 933 from urban settings, and 735 from rural settings. Forty-six percent of urban girls and 59 % of rural girls were Black. One-way and two-way ANOVAs with school as a covariate were {{used to analyze the}} data. Results indicated that most differences were associated with race rather <b>than</b> setting. Black <b>girls</b> were less active <b>than</b> White <b>girls,</b> reporting significantly fewer 30 -minute blocks of both vigorous and moderate-to-vigorous physical activity. Black girls also spent more time watching television, and had higher BMIs and greater prevalence of overweight <b>than</b> White <b>girls.</b> However, enjoyment of physical education and family involvement in physical activity were greater among Black girls titan White girls. Rural White girls and urban Black girls had more favorable attitudes toward physical activity. Access to sports equipment, perceived safety of neighborhood, and physical activity self-efficacy were higher in White <b>girls</b> <b>than</b> Black <b>girls...</b>|$|R

25|$|Most research, such as {{studies done}} by UNICEF, {{suggests}} that boys {{are much more}} likely <b>than</b> <b>girls</b> to be trafficked for the purposes of begging; experts presume this is because there is a greater female presence in trafficking for the purposes of sexual exploitation. In Albania, where forced begging is a common practice, seventy percent of victims are male.|$|E
25|$|In India, gender-based health inequities are {{apparent}} in early childhood. Many families provide better nutrition for {{boys in the}} interest of maximizing future productivity given that boys are generally seen as breadwinners. In addition, boys receive better care <b>than</b> <b>girls</b> and are hospitalized at a greater rate. The magnitude of these disparities increases with the severity of poverty in a given population.|$|E

25|$|There is {{uncertainty}} {{regarding the}} gender gap {{between males and females}} with AS. A person with Asperger's is often remarked as possessing masculine traits like emotional distance from the inability to empathize, and far more boys <b>than</b> <b>girls</b> are diagnosed with Asperger's. Most studies on the syndrome were derived from research on males, neglecting specific attention to females with AS who often go misdiagnosed. For the most part, studies on girls with Asperger's are anecdotal.|$|E

25|$|Anemia {{has also}} been linked to SIDS (note, however, that per item 6 {{in the list of}} {{epidemiologic}} characteristics below, extent of anemia cannot be evaluated at autopsy because an infant's total hemoglobin can only be measured during life.). SIDS incidence rises from zero at birth, is highest from two to four months of age, and declines toward zero after the infant's first year.

25|$|While {{atypical}} {{gender role}} development may be heritable, {{this does not}} mean that it is independent. However, environmental effects can differ largely for different genders. Because society is more accepting of male traits (girls playing soccer) than female traits (boys doing ballet), society’s negativity typically forces males to try to stay within the stereotypic norms. That being said however, male influence accounted by environmental factors that lead to atypical development is also stronger for boys <b>than</b> <b>girls</b> in terms of atypical development.|$|E
25|$|Due to {{anatomical}} {{and physiological}} differences, injuries in {{children need to}} be approached differently from those in adults.

In the United States, approximately sixteen million children go to an emergency department due to some form of injury every year, with boys being more frequently injured <b>than</b> <b>girls</b> by a ratio of 2:1.
