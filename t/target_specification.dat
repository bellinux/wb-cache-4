50|$|Control charts limit {{specification}} limits or targets {{because of}} the tendency of those involved with the process (e.g., machine operators) to focus on performing to specification when in fact the least-cost course of action is to keep process variation as low as possible. Attempting to make a process whose natural centre {{is not the same}} as the target perform to <b>target</b> <b>specification</b> increases process variability and increases costs significantly and is the cause of much inefficiency in operations. Process capability studies do examine the relationship between the natural process limits (the control limits) and specifications, however.|$|E
40|$|The {{behavior}} composition problem involves automatic {{synthesis of}} a controller that {{is able to}} “realize” (i. e., implement) a desired <b>target</b> <b>specification</b> by suitably controlling a collection of already available, partially controllable, behaviors running in a partially predictable shared environment. A behavior in our context refers to an already existing functionality such as the logic of a device, a service, a standalone component, etc; whereas a <b>target</b> <b>specification</b> represents the desired non-existent functionality that {{is meant to be}} obtained through the available behaviors. Previous work in behavior composition has exclusively aimed at synthesising exact controllers, those that bring about the desired specification completely. One open issue has resisted principled solutions: if the <b>target</b> <b>specification</b> cannot be completely implemented, {{is there a way to}} realize it “optimally”? In this doctoral thesis, we propose qualitative and quantitative optimisation frameworks that are able to accommodate composition problems that do not admit the “perfect” coordinating controller. In the qualitative setting, we rely on the formal notion of simulation to define realizable fragments of a <b>target</b> <b>specification</b> and show the existence of a unique supremal realizable fragment for a given problem instance. In addition, we extend the qualitative framework by introducing exogenous uncontrollable events to represent observable contingencies. In the quantitative setting, we provide a decision theoretic approach to behavior composition by quantifying the uncertainties present in the domain. In all cases, we provide effective techniques to compute optimal solutions and study their computational properties...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{strives to}} track a target object in a video. Rather than specifying the {{target in the}} first frame of a video by a {{bounding}} box, we propose to track the object based on a natural language specification of the target, which provides a more natural human-machine interaction {{as well as a}} means to improve tracking results. We define three variants of tracking by language specification: one relying on lingual <b>target</b> <b>specification</b> only, one relying on visual <b>target</b> <b>specification</b> based on language, and one leveraging their joint capacity. To show the potential of tracking by natural language specification we extend two popular tracking datasets with lingual descriptions and report experiments. Finally, we also sketch new tracking scenarios in surveillance and other live video streams that become feasible with a lingual specification of the target...|$|E

40|$|In this paper, recent {{activities}} {{on the development of}} Hydrazinium Nitroformate (HNF) and HNF based propellants are discussed from different perspectives -programmatic, technical, and strategic. From a programmatic point of view, the current programmes on HNF and their goals are discussed in relation to the Milestone Decision Points that have been identified in the Roadmap on HNF and HNF based propellant development. [1]. From a technical point of view, the so-called <b>target</b> <b>specification</b> of HNF is reviewed, indicating where HNF meets this <b>target</b> <b>specification</b> and where extra effort is required. Earlier research has shown that the properties of HNF (like purity, stability, morphology and sensitivity) to a large extent determine the properties of the HNF based propellant (like mechanical, ballistic, processing and sensitivity characteristics). Therefore, one of the main focal points of recent and future development activities is the improvement of the HNF properties. The other main focal point is the preparation for motor tests on 1 kg propellant scale, raising the Technology Readiness Level (TRL) of HNF-based propellants from 4 to 5 [2]. From a strategic point of view, the possibilities of embedding HNF and HNF based propellant advances in the development-frame of future applications are discussed. Particular emphasis is placed on space applications...|$|E

40|$|This is {{a report}} on my thesis work on {{bachelor}} level that took place on SSAB Oxelösund {{during the spring of}} 2018. The work has revolved around concept development of an installation for hardness measuring in their production line, and has furthered the development of an existing project. During the last years, different aspects of the project have been analyzed to bring the project closer to a realization. The work has focused around taking a closer look on a concept of a unit meant to perform surface preparation, indentations and topographical analysis of steel plate. The goal is to install this in a so called in-line solution, using a portal over the production line as a basis. This has involved function analysis, establishing <b>target</b> <b>specifications</b> and suggest existing components that can fit those. To define the demands for the <b>target</b> <b>specifications,</b> tests have been performed on vibration factors on the suggested installation place, and laser as a means to clean steel surfaces have been tried out. The result have been an advancement on earlier concepts. Suggestions have been made regarding components, sub functions have been further defined, environmental factors have been analyzed and new technology for surface preparation have been successfully tried out...|$|R
