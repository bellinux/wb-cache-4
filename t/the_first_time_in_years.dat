However, when he sees Manjula for <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>in</b> <b>years,</b> he is shocked by her beauty and wit, and feels less reluctant. The pair decide that perhaps the marriage can work after all, with Manjula reminding Apu that they can always get a divorce.|$|E
5|$|After {{the special}} session of Congress had adjourned, Sherman {{returned}} home to Mansfield. He spoke on behalf of Ohio Governor Charles Foster's effort {{for a second term}} and went to Kenyon College with ex-President Hayes, where he received an honorary degree. Sherman looked forward to staying with his wife at home for an extended period for <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>in</b> <b>years,</b> when news arrived that Garfield had been shot in Washington. The assassin, Charles J. Guiteau, was a deranged office-seeker who believed that Garfield's successor would appoint him to a patronage job. After lingering for several months, Garfield died, and Arthur became president. After completing a long-planned visit to Yellowstone National Park and other Western sites with his brother William, Sherman returned to a second special session of Congress in October 1881.|$|E
5|$|In January {{they find}} a {{restaurant}} that specializes in local cuisine and, previously vegetarians, they cook and eat beef for <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>in</b> <b>years.</b> Working in Malawi, MacKinnon is struck by the contrast between their western diet {{and that of the}} poor country's: there is ample food supplies in Malawi but most is exported to Canada and the United States who buy the food they do not require. The couple learn about Mexican and Maya cuisine while in Merida, Mexico for a wedding. The book ends with an epilogue, written by both Smith and MacKinnon six months after their one-year diet. They make a symbolic journey to Bamfield, within their 100-mile radius, to collect sea water for its salt and prove they could obtain their own salt supply.|$|E

The name Oberkassel {{refers to a}} Roman fortification; {{in the course of}} time [...] "Romerkastell" [...] (Roman castle) became [...] "Oberkassel". Oberkassel absorbed the previously separate settlements of Berghoven (mentioned for <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>in</b> 873), Büchel (mentioned for <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>in</b> 1202), Broich (mentioned for <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>in</b> 1306) and Meerhausen (mentioned for <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>in</b> 1442).|$|R

5|$|Scully theorizes that Gates {{has brought}} Kevin to a {{recycling}} plant he owns in Jerusalem, Ohio. Mulder {{thinks that he}} has headed to the airport, as a man matching Gates' description was reported headed there. Mulder thinks Scully believes that she's been chosen to protect Kevin. Scully arrives at the recycling plant where Gates tells Kevin that he must die for the 'New Age' to come. Gates attempts to jump into a paper shredding machine with Kevin, but Kevin grabs onto the side as Gates falls into the shredder. Scully is able to pull Kevin to safety. Two days later, Scully and Kevin say goodbye. Kevin tells Scully he'll see her again. Scully goes to the confessional for <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>in</b> <b>years,</b> wondering if God is speaking, but {{that no one is}} listening.|$|E
5|$|When Elsa turns twenty-one, {{she is to}} be crowned {{queen of}} Arendelle. She is terrified that the kingdom's {{citizens}} might find out about her powers and fear for her. The castle gates {{open to the public}} and visiting dignitaries for <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>in</b> <b>years.</b> Amongst them is the scheming Duke of Weselton, and the dashing Prince Hans of the Southern Isles, with whom Anna falls head-over-heels in love. Elsa’s coronation happens without a hitch, but she still remains distant from Anna. When Hans proposes to Anna, Elsa objects, accidentally unleashing her powers before the court. The Duke brands her a monster. Elsa flees the kingdom, but her suppressed magic engulfs Arendelle in an eternal winter. Reaching the North Mountain, Elsa discards her crown and creates a palace of ice in which to live a solitary life.|$|E
5|$|Due to the {{intensely}} closeted {{nature of}} Miami's gay community at that time, many voters {{who were not}} swayed by Bryant's rhetoric were persuaded instead by her campaign's point that the law was unnecessary; {{they were unable to}} see the problem of discrimination. Unlike blacks or Cubans, gay men and lesbians were able to find jobs, although they faced dismissal upon their supervisors learning of their sexual orientation. In order to see a complaint through, they would have to remain out, and many lived in constant fear of exposure. Since the advent of second wave feminism earlier in the decade, many lesbians in the U.S. were unable to see themselves as part of the same community with gay men. Accusations from Save Our Children were almost all directed at the behavior of men. As a result, much of the response by gay men was angry and many lesbians took issue with the misogynistic tone gay men used. However, with Bryant representing a common adversary, for <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>in</b> <b>years,</b> gay men and lesbians united to work together on the campaign.|$|E

50|$|The 1961 Hawthorn Football Club {{season was}} the clubs 37th {{season in the}} Victorian Football League. The 1961 season was a {{historical}} one for Hawthorn finishing top of the ladder and claiming the McClelland Trophy for <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>in</b> their history, reaching the Grand Final for <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>in</b> their history, and winning the Premiership for <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>in</b> their history.|$|R
5|$|In {{an effort}} to remedy the {{perceived}} defects of the Articles of Confederation, delegates were first sent to the Annapolis Convention in 1786 {{and then to the}} Philadelphia Convention in 1787, where they drafted the United States Constitution, which was then sent to the states for ratification or rejection. Hancock, who was not present at the Philadelphia Convention, had misgivings about the new Constitution's lack of a bill of rights and its shift of power to a central government. In January 1788, Hancock was elected president of the Massachusetts ratifying convention, although he was ill and not present when the convention began. Hancock mostly remained silent during the contentious debates, but as the convention was drawing to close, he gave a speech in favor of ratification. For <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>in</b> <b>years,</b> Samuel Adams supported Hancock's position. Even with the support of Hancock and Adams, the Massachusetts convention narrowly ratified the Constitution by a vote of 187 to 168. Hancock's support was probably a deciding factor in the ratification.|$|E
5|$|Sue Ellen {{has become}} a {{powerful}} woman in Dallas, leading successful fundraising campaigns and making connections with influential Texans. Her success has led her to run for Governor of Texas, with campaign backers already lining up to support her. But despite this success, Sue Ellen harbors deep regret for her mistakes as a mother raising John Ross and {{will do anything to}} make things right for him. Upon seeing J.R. for <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>in</b> <b>years,</b> there is a brief moment of romantic tension and nostalgia. However, Sue Ellen becomes wary of J.R.'s claims of having changed when Cliff Barnes returns to town. Then when a colleague and occasional lover of John Ross's, Veronica Martinez, is pushed off a balcony and killed, Sue Ellen bribes the medical examiner into ruling the death a suicide and finds herself looking for support from Harris Ryland, Ann's ex-husband. Harris later plans to use Sue Ellen's sure win to his advantage and desiring to run a clean office, Sue Ellen seeks Ann's help who later gets a recording of Harris admitting to his crimes and placing him into a spot of submission.|$|E
25|$|Manchester United {{started the}} season by drawing their opening two games against Reading and Portsmouth. United lost Wayne Rooney to a foot injury picked up against Reading and Cristiano Ronaldo to {{suspension}} {{after he was}} sent off for appearing to headbutt Portsmouth's Richard Hughes. A derby defeat to Manchester City saw the club slip into 17th place in the table. Results elsewhere pushed them into the relegation zone for <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>in</b> <b>years.</b>|$|E

50|$|The Canadian Amateur {{stayed in}} Ontario and Quebec until 1921, {{when it went}} to Manitoba.

Since then, it has rotated around the country's top courses, with the current format {{allowing}} {{each of the six}} major golf regions (Atlantic Canada, Quebec, Ontario, Manitoba and Saskatchewan, Alberta, and British Columbia) to have its turn on approximately a six-year cycle. Among Canada's ten provinces, only Newfoundland and Labrador has yet to host it.|$|R

25|$|Before the {{beginning}} of the 2005 English cricket season began, a resurgent English cricket team had won four Test series in a row, going unbeaten through the 2004 calendar year. The start of the international season saw England defeat Bangladesh 2–0 in their two-match series, winning both Tests by an innings. This was followed by a tri-nations one-day tournament that also featured Australia. However, all eyes were on the Ashes. Australia still started as favourites, but England, for <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>in</b> <b>years,</b> were expected to put up a real challenge to Aussie supremacy.|$|E

25|$|With the Cowboys {{traditionally}} hosting Thanksgiving Day games, separate uniform {{practices have}} been used for these games in recent years.

Dallas would lose the game, but again wore the older blue jersey at home on Thanksgiving the next year and won. With the 2002 victory, it seems an exception the theory of the blue jersey jinx is invoked on Thanksgiving.|$|E
25|$|Strauss {{expertly}} {{managed the}} convention. At the 1972 convention, party infighting had delayed candidate McGovern's acceptance speech until late at night, when the television audience {{had gone to}} sleep. Strauss made sure that Carter's acceptance speech ran in prime time, and the convention ended with a memorable tableau: {{the leaders of the}} party's opposing wings, conservative George Wallace and liberal George McGovern, flanking Carter with clasped hands upraised. The Democrats entered the fall campaign united for <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>in</b> <b>years.</b> Credit for this accomplishment was awarded to Chairman Strauss, and Carter quickly asked Strauss to chair his election campaign as well.|$|E

Their first World Cup saw the South Africans seeded into the toughest group of the competition containing Australia, England and Fiji. The South Africans found their three group matches extremely difficult and failed to win a match during the tournament.|$|E

Used in a very defensively-minded role, Russell enjoyed limited offensive success but slotted in as the team's de facto #4 defenseman alongside fellow veteran Andrej Sekera. Much like the Flames in 2015, the Oilers made the playoffs in 2016-17 for <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>in</b> <b>years,</b> but lost in the second round to the Anaheim Ducks, and for the second year in a row, Russell was held goalless in the playoffs.|$|E

Ferguson {{came into the}} fight below 230 pounds for <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>time</b> <b>in</b> <b>years</b> and was {{considered}} to be in the best shape of his career. Because the IBF did not consider Ferguson to be a legitimate contender, they would not sanction the defense for Bowe and only the WBA and lineal championships were on the line. Ferguson thought he had a legitimate chance to knock the champion out, but Bowe disregarded his boasts. Ferguson was knocked down {{toward the end of the}} first round and barely made it back to his feet at the bell, then was dropped again as the second round began and knocked out.|$|E
