5|$|Charles Fisk, also {{a pianist}} and music scholar, has {{described}} another cyclic element in Schubert's last sonatas – a unifying <b>tonal</b> design, which follows a similar, basic dramatic scheme {{in each of}} the three works. According to Fisk, each sonata presents at its very beginning, the generative kernel of a musical conflict from which all the ensuing music will derive. The first movement, beginning and ending in the sonata's home key, confronts this key with a contrasting tonality or <b>tonal</b> stratum. This dichotomous <b>tonal</b> design is also manifested in both third and final movements, whose openings are variants of the first movement's opening. Moreover, the contrasting tonality becomes the main key of the second movement, thus increasing the harmonic tension in the middle of the sonata, while projecting the first movement's <b>tonal</b> design (home key – contrasting tonality – home key) on the sonata as a whole. In the first half of each sonata, the musical material in the contrasting tonality is presented in sharp conflict with the material in the home key – in each appearance boldly detached from its surroundings. However, in the third movements and especially in the finales, this contrasting <b>tonal</b> realm is gradually integrated into its environment, bringing a sense of unity and resolution to the <b>tonal</b> conflict which was presented at the beginning of the sonata. Fisk goes further to interpret the dramatic musical scheme manifested in the <b>tonal</b> design of the sonatas, as the basis of a unique psychological narrative (see below).|$|E

5|$|Leo Ornstein to many {{represents}} an evil musical genius wandering without the utmost pale of <b>tonal</b> orthodoxy, {{in a weird}} No-Man's Land haunted with tortuous sound, with wails of futuristic despair, with cubist shrieks and post-impressionist cries and crashes. He is the great anarch, the iconoclast.|$|E

5|$|Due to {{subsequent}} vowel loss many Mayan languages now show complex consonant clusters at {{both ends}} of syllables. Following the reconstruction of Lyle Campbell and Terrence Kaufman, the Proto-Mayan language had the following sounds. It has been suggested that proto-Mayan was a <b>tonal</b> language, {{based on the fact that}} four different contemporary Mayan languages have tone (Yucatec, Uspantek, San Bartolo Tzotzil and Mocho'), but since these languages each can be shown to have innovated tone in different ways, Campbell considers this unlikely.|$|E
5|$|Extramusical {{connotations of}} this kind have {{sometimes}} {{been used as a}} basis {{for the construction of a}} psychological or biographical narrative, attempting to interpret the musical program behind Schubert's last sonatas. Charles Fisk has suggested that the sonatas portray a protagonist going through successive stages of alienation, banishment, exile, and eventual homecoming (in the A major and B-flat Sonatas), or self-assertion (in the C minor Sonata). Discrete tonalities or <b>tonal</b> strata, appearing in complete musical segregation from one another at the beginning of each sonata, suggest contrasting psychological states, such as reality and dream, home and exile, etc.; these conflicts are further deepened in the ensuing slow movements. Once these contrasts are resolved at the finale, by intensive musical integration and the gradual transition from one tonality to the next, a sense of reconciliation, of acceptance and homecoming, is invoked. Fisk's hypothetical narrative is grounded on the basis of the ample cyclic connections within the sonatas and their unique <b>tonal</b> design, as well as their musical similarities to songs such as Der Wanderer and the Winterreise song cycle; and on biographical evidence concerning Schubert's life, including a story written by Schubert (Mein Traum – My Dream). Fisk suggests that the sonatas convey Schubert's own feelings of loneliness and alienation; by their striving towards musical and <b>tonal</b> integration, the writing of these works offered Schubert a release from his emotional distress, particularly deepened after finishing the composition of the lonely, depressive and hopeless songs of Winterreise, during the preceding year.|$|E
5|$|His compositions, {{particularly}} those of his later period, are notable for their complex textures, rich harmonies and orchestration, and the elaborate use of leitmotifs—musical phrases associated with individual characters, places, ideas, or plot elements. His advances in musical language, such as extreme chromaticism and quickly shifting <b>tonal</b> centres, greatly influenced the development of classical music. His Tristan und Isolde is sometimes described as marking the start of modern music.|$|E
5|$|In 1910 Brooks had {{her first}} solo show at the prestigious Gallery Durand-Ruel, {{displaying}} thirteen paintings, almost all of women or young girls. Some were portraits; others showed anonymous models in interior scenes or against <b>tonal</b> backgrounds, often with pensive or withdrawn expressions. The paintings were generally naturalistic, showing an attentive eye for the details of Belle Époque fashion, with parasols, veils, and elaborate bonnets on display.|$|E
5|$|In the mid-1920s, Ornstein left New York {{to accept}} a {{teaching}} post at the Philadelphia Musical Academy, later part of the University of the Arts. During this period, he wrote {{some of his most}} important work, including the Piano Concerto, commissioned by the Philadelphia Orchestra in 1925. Two years later, he produced his Piano Quintet. An epic <b>tonal</b> work marked by an adventurous use of dissonance and complex rhythmic arrangements, it is recognized as a masterpiece of the genre.|$|E
5|$|It {{is likely}} that the <b>tonal</b> {{lowering}} seen in this particular example is related to the low tone nasal prefix found in future tense constructions in some other Senufo languages. In fact, Supyire shows a similar phenomenon in future tense constructions with a direct object (in other future tense constructions, a low tone nasal is found).|$|E
5|$|Like most Southeast Asian languages, {{including}} Tai and {{the varieties}} of Chinese, E is <b>tonal.</b> The language is described as having seven tones, with the seventh varying allophonically with {{the length of the}} vowel it is attached to. With numbers ranging from 1 to 5, with 1 being the lowest tone and 5 the highest, the contours of the various tones in E are as follows.|$|E
5|$|New Caledonia {{languages}} {{are divided into}} several groups. The Northern language group is <b>tonal</b> and includes 12 languages: Caac, Cemuhî, Fwâi, Jawe, Kumak, Nemi, Paicî, Pije, Pwaamei, Pwapwa, Yalayu, and Yuaga. Approximately 60,000 residents of New Caledonia speak {{at least one of}} the Kanak languages. Most of these {{languages are}} only in spoken form. There is no one unified language among the Kanaks; however, the largest group of Kanaks speak Drehu.|$|E
5|$|Third dance {{movement}} (Scherzo or minuet) in the tonic, {{in overall}} A–B–A ternary form, with a trio in either ternary or binary form, {{and in a}} conventionally related key (relative major, subdominant, and parallel minor respectively). They are based on their sonata's first movements, with a similar <b>tonal</b> scheme and/or motivic reference. The B section of each piece features tonalities serving important dramatic functions in previous movements. Each features animated, playful figurations for the right hand and abrupt changes in register.|$|E
5|$|Wagner's later musical style {{introduced}} {{new ideas}} in harmony, melodic process (leitmotif) and operatic structure. Notably from Tristan und Isolde onwards, he explored {{the limits of}} the traditional <b>tonal</b> system, which gave keys and chords their identity, pointing the way to atonality in the 20th century. Some music historians date the beginning of modern classical music to the first notes of Tristan, which include the so-called Tristan chord.|$|E
5|$|A Sea Symphony (1910), {{the only}} one of the series to include a part for full choir, differs from most earlier choral symphonies in that the choir sings in all the movements. The extent to which it is a true symphony has been debated; in a 2013 study, Alain Frogley {{describes}} it as a hybrid work, with elements of symphony, oratorio and cantata. Its sheer length—about eighty minutes—was unprecedented for an English symphonic work, and within its thoroughly <b>tonal</b> construction it contains harmonic dissonances that pre-echo the early works of Stravinsky which were soon to follow.|$|E
5|$|A {{study of}} short-finned pilot whales off the {{southwest}} coast of Tenerife in the Canary Islands {{has found the}} members of a pod maintained contact with each other through call repertoires unique to their pod. A later study found, when foraging at around 800 m deep, short-finned pilot whales make <b>tonal</b> calls. The number and length of the calls seem to decrease with depth despite being farther away from conspecifics at the surface. As such, the surrounding water pressure affects the energy of the calls, but it does not appear to affect the frequency levels.|$|E
5|$|Also {{frequently}} performed is the Fifth Symphony (Op. 50, 1921–22) presenting another {{battle between}} the forces of order and chaos. A snare drummer is given the task of interrupting the orchestra, playing ad libitum and out of time, as if to destroy the music. Performed by the Danish Radio Symphony Orchestra conducted by Erik Tuxen at the 1950 Edinburgh International Festival, it caused a sensation, sparking interest in Nielsen's music outside Scandinavia. In the Sixth Symphony (without opus number), written 1924–25, and subtitled Sinfonia Semplice (Simple Symphony), the <b>tonal</b> language seems {{similar to that in}} Nielsen's other symphonies, but the symphony develops into a sequence of cameos, some sad, some grotesque, some humorous.|$|E
5|$|Assonance, {{where the}} use of similar vowel sounds within a word rather than similar sounds at the {{beginning}} or end of a word, was widely used in skaldic poetry, but {{goes back to the}} Homeric epic. Because verbs carry much of the pitch in the English language, assonance can loosely evoke the <b>tonal</b> elements of Chinese poetry and so is useful in translating Chinese poetry. Consonance occurs where a consonant sound is repeated throughout a sentence without putting the sound only at the front of a word. Consonance provokes a more subtle effect than alliteration and so is less useful as a structural element.|$|E
5|$|During its release, Life Is Strange {{received}} generally favourable reviews commending {{the character}} development, rewind game mechanic and tackling of taboo subjects. It won the BAFTA Games Award for Best Story, the Peabody-Facebook Futures of Media Award and The Game Awards' Games for Impact Award. Common criticisms included the slang that was used, poor lip-syncing in earlier episodes, and <b>tonal</b> inconsistencies in the story. It has sold over three million copies as of May 2017. A prequel——was released on 31 August 2017. A digital series and a sequel—Life Is Strange 2—are in development.|$|E
5|$|Earlier in 2017 Puw {{completed}} his first chamber opera Y Tŵr {{based on the}} play by the Welsh playwright, Gwenlyn Parry and to libretto by Gwyneth Glyn. The opera in three acts explores the relationship and emotions between two characters during three specific periods in their lives, during youth, middle age and finally, old age. The composer's use of atonal musical language, octatonic scales and the occasional <b>tonal</b> passage are directly linked with the various emotions of the characters and the unfolding of the drama.|$|E
5|$|First {{movement}} in moderate or fast tempo, and in sonata form. The exposition {{consists of two}} or three thematic and <b>tonal</b> areas and, as common in the Classical style, moves from tonic to dominant (in major mode works) or to the relative major (in minor mode works). However, as often with Schubert, the harmonic scheme of the exposition involves additional, intermediate tonalities, which may be quite remote from the tonic-dominant axis, and sometimes imbue certain expository passages with the character of a development section. The main themes of the exposition are often in ternary form, with their middle section digressing to a different tonality. The themes generally do not form symmetrical periods, and irregular phrase lengths are prominent. The exposition ends with a repeat sign. The development section opens with an abrupt turn into a new <b>tonal</b> area. A new theme, based on a melodic fragment from the second thematic group of the exposition, is presented in this section over recurrent rhythmic figuration, and then developed, undergoing successive transformations. The first thematic group returns in the recapitulation with different or additional harmonic digressions; the second group returns unaltered, only transposed a fourth up. The short coda maintains the tonic key and mainly soft dynamics, achieving a resolution of the movement's conflicts and ending pianissimo.|$|E
5|$|From {{the figure}} of the artist, the viewer's eye leaps again diagonally into the {{pictorial}} space. Another man stands, echoing and opposing the form of the artist, outside rather than inside, made clearly defined and yet barely identifiable by the light and shade. The positioning of such an area of strong <b>tonal</b> contrast right {{at the rear of the}} pictorial space is a daring compositional tactic. The shapes of bright light are similar to the irregular light shapes of the foreground Maid of Honour, but the sharply defined door-frame repeats the border of the mirror.|$|E
5|$|Greenlandic prosody {{does not}} include stress as an {{autonomous}} category; instead, prosody is determined by <b>tonal</b> and durational parameters. Intonation is influenced by syllable weight: heavy syllables are pronounced {{in a way that}} may be perceived as stress. Heavy syllables include syllables with long vowels and syllables before consonant clusters. The last syllable is stressed in words with fewer than four syllables and without long vowels or consonant clusters. The antepenultimate syllable is stressed in words with more than four syllables that are all light. In words with many heavy syllables, syllables with long vowels are considered heavier than syllables before a consonant cluster.|$|E
5|$|I. Molto moderato. This {{movement}} {{employs a}} three-key exposition. The first theme introduces a G-flat trill that anticipates the following harmonic events – {{a shift to}} G-flat major in the central section of the main theme, and, after {{a return to the}} tonic, an enharmonic shift to F-sharp minor {{at the start of the}} second theme. After a colorful harmonic excursion, the third <b>tonal</b> area arrives in the traditional dominant key (F major). In contrast to the previous sonatas, here the development section elaborates on several different themes from the exposition. It reaches a dramatic climax in D minor, in which the first theme is presented, fluctuating between D minor and the home key, in a manner similar to the parallel passage from the previous sonata (see above). In the recapitulation, the bass line in the first theme rises to B-flat instead of descending to F (as in the exposition), and the second theme enters in B minor, instead of F-sharp minor. The rest of the exposition is repeated without alterations, transposed a fourth up, meaning that it returns to the home key, B-flat, for the third <b>tonal</b> area. The coda once again recalls the first theme, although only fragmentarily.|$|E
5|$|It {{was again}} rebuilt by them in 1930, {{and then by}} Hill, Norman and Beard in 1948, which brought the number of stops to 58. In 1972 this was {{increased}} {{to a total of}} 65 speaking stops. The Positive division, with its separate case behind the console, was installed at the same time. Problems caused by the <b>tonal</b> scheme's lack of coherence– the 1895 pipework contrasting sharply with that of 1972– and with reliability, caused by the wide variety of different types of key actions, all difficult to access, led to the decision to have the instrument rebuilt yet again.|$|E
5|$|Khmer {{differs from}} {{neighboring}} languages such as Thai, Burmese, Lao and Vietnamese {{in that it}} is not a <b>tonal</b> language. Words are stressed on the final syllable, hence many words conform to the typical Mon–Khmer pattern of a stressed syllable preceded by a minor syllable. The language has been written in the Khmer script, an abugida descended from the Brahmi script via the southern Indian Pallava script, since at least the seventh century. The script's form and use has evolved over the centuries; its modern features include subscripted versions of consonants used to write clusters and a division of consonants into two series with different inherent vowels. Approximately 79% of Cambodians are able to read Khmer.|$|E
5|$|Little, Brown and Company heavily {{promoted}} {{the book and}} it became the first debut novel to become number one on The New York Times bestseller list in its first week on sale. As of 2005, it was the fastest-selling hardback debut novel in U.S. history. In general, the novel received mixed reviews. While some praised the book's description of the setting, others criticized its structure and lack of <b>tonal</b> variety. Kostova received the 2006 Book Sense award for Best Adult Fiction and the 2005 Quill Award for Debut Author of the Year. Sony has bought the film rights and, as of 2007, was planning an adaptation.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the reasons}} for the long period of neglect of Schubert's piano sonatas seems to be their {{dismissal}} as structurally and dramatically inferior to the sonatas of Beethoven. In fact, the last sonatas contain distinct allusions and similarities to works by Beethoven, a composer Schubert venerated. However, musicological analysis has shown that they maintain a mature, individual style. Schubert's last sonatas are now praised for that mature style, manifested in unique features such as a cyclical formal and <b>tonal</b> design, chamber music textures, and a rare depth of emotional expression.|$|E
5|$|Ornamentation {{assumes a}} preeminent role {{in much of}} Sorabji's music. His {{harmonic}} language, which frequently combines <b>tonal</b> and atonal elements, is thus freer than in the music of many other composers and less amenable to analysis. Like many other 20th-century composers, Sorabji displays a fondness for tritone and semitone relationships. The opening gesture of his Fourth Piano Sonata, for example, emphasises these two intervals, and the two long pedal points in its third movement are a tritone apart. However, some people have remarked that his music rarely contains the tension that is commonly associated with very dissonant music.|$|E
5|$|Over the {{instrumental}} passage, the tabla rhythm switches to a 10-beat jhaptal cycle. A musical dialogue ensues in 5/4 time, first between the dilruba and sitar, then between a Western string section and sitar. The interplay between these lead instruments adheres to the call-and-response tradition of Indian classical music, known as jawab-sawal. The passage resolves in melodic unison as the instruments together state a rhythmic cadence, or tihai, {{to close the}} middle segment. After this, the drone is again prominent as the rhythm returns to 16-beat tintal for the final verse and chorus. On the finished recording, the <b>tonal</b> and spiritual tension is relieved by the inclusion of muted canned laughter.|$|E
5|$|Shostakovich's {{works are}} broadly <b>tonal</b> {{and in the}} Romantic tradition, but with {{elements}} of atonality and chromaticism. In some of his later works (e.g., the Twelfth Quartet), he made use of tone rows. His output is dominated by his cycles of symphonies and string quartets, each totaling fifteen works. The symphonies are distributed fairly evenly throughout his career, while the quartets are concentrated towards the latter part. Among the most popular are the Fifth and Seventh Symphonies and the Eighth and Fifteenth Quartets. Other works include the operas Lady Macbeth of Mtsensk, The Nose and the unfinished The Gamblers based on the comedy of Nikolai Gogol; six concertos (two each for piano, violin and cello); two piano trios; and a large quantity of film music.|$|E
