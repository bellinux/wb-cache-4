5|$|After Winterbourne Stoke {{the route}} once again becomes dual {{carriageway}} from Yarnbury Castle {{and across the}} Wylye valley, meeting the A36 at Deptford. There is then another section of single carriageway road, {{coming out of the}} valley and up to the crest of the Great Ridge, before a further section of dual two lane road down from the hill crest near Berwick St Leonard. On reaching the valley, it reverts again to single carriageway and through the village of Chicklade, before following the terrain over <b>to</b> <b>Mere,</b> where it runs north of the town as another dual carriageway bypass. Continuing west, it passes south of Wincanton and then north of Sparkford to a roundabout where the road reverts once more to single carriageway.|$|E
5|$|During {{the presidential}} {{referendum}} in Egypt, Nasser was re-elected {{to a second}} term as UAR president and took his oath on 25 March 1965. He was the only candidate for the position, with virtually all of his political opponents forbidden by law from running for office, and his fellow party members reduced <b>to</b> <b>mere</b> followers. That same year, Nasser had the Muslim Brotherhood chief ideologue Sayyed Qutb imprisoned. Qutb was charged and found guilty by the court of plotting to assassinate Nasser, and was executed in 1966. Beginning in 1966, as Egypt's economy slowed and government debt became increasingly burdensome, Nasser began to ease state control over the private sector, encouraging state-owned bank loans to private business and introducing incentives to increase exports. During the 60's, the Egyptian economy went from sluggishness to the verge of collapse, the society became less free, and Nasser's appeal waned considerably.|$|E
5|$|The polyps of {{stony corals}} have {{six-fold}} symmetry while those of soft corals have eight. The mouth of each polyp {{is surrounded by}} a ring of tentacles. In stony corals these are cylindrical and taper to a point, but in soft corals they are pinnate with side branches known as pinnules. In some tropical species these are reduced <b>to</b> <b>mere</b> stubs and in some they are fused to give a paddle-like appearance. In most corals, the tentacles are retracted by day and spread out at night to catch plankton and other small organisms. Shallow water species of both stony and soft corals can be zooxanthellate, the corals supplementing their plankton diet with the products of photosynthesis produced by these symbionts. The polyps interconnect by a complex and well-developed system of gastrovascular canals, allowing significant sharing of nutrients and symbionts.|$|E

25|$|A bog {{body is a}} human cadaver {{that has}} been {{naturally}} mummified in a peat bog. Such bodies, sometimes known as bog people, are both geographically and chronologically widespread, having been dated to between 8000 BCE and the Second World War. The unifying factor of the bog bodies {{is that they have}} been found in peat and are partially preserved; however, the actual levels of preservation vary widely from perfectly preserved <b>to</b> <b>mere</b> skeletons.|$|E
25|$|While Ethical Culturists {{generally}} {{share common}} beliefs {{about what constitutes}} ethical behavior and the good, individuals are encouraged {{to develop their own}} personal understanding of these ideas. This does not mean that Ethical Culturists condone moral relativism, which would relegate ethics <b>to</b> <b>mere</b> preferences or social conventions. Ethical principles are viewed as being related to deep truths about the way the world works, and hence not arbitrary. However, it is recognized that complexities render the understanding of ethical nuances subject to continued dialogue, exploration, and learning.|$|E

25|$|By {{the closing}} {{decades of the}} eighteenth century Brno had become the de facto capital of Moravia. This fact, as well as dissatisfaction with the {{university}} management due to persisting influence of the Church, led to the university relocating there in 1778. In Brno, the number of students declined <b>to</b> <b>mere</b> 575. There were nine professors at the faculty of theology, two at law and four at philosophy (one of which was professor of Political science, which would later become part of the faculty of law).|$|E
25|$|A new {{forceful}} commander, Lieutenant General Nobuo Tanaka, took {{command of}} the 33rd Division on 22 May, and ordered repeated attacks which reduced many of his division's battalions <b>to</b> <b>mere</b> handfuls of men. In June, he received reinforcements (a regiment from the Japanese 53rd Division, and a detachment from the 14th Tank Regiment) and used them to launch another attack. After initial success, the fresh regiment suffered heavy casualties from shellfire. By the end of June, the 33rd Division had suffered so many casualties that they could make no further effort.|$|E
25|$|In 1349 the Black Death {{spread to}} Norway and had {{within a year}} killed {{a third of the}} {{population}}. Later plagues reduced the population to half the starting point by 1400. Many communities were entirely wiped out, resulting in an abundance of land, allowing farmers to switch to more animal husbandry. The reduction in taxes weakened the king's position, and many aristocrats lost the basis for their surplus, reducing some <b>to</b> <b>mere</b> farmers.

This is unlikely, however, given that it appeared in four separate photographs over three different nights.|$|R

25|$|The immanence of the Trinity {{that was}} {{defined in the}} {{finalized}} Nicene Creed. The economy of God, as God expresses himself in reality (his energies) was not what the Creed addressed directly. The specifics of God's interrelationships of his existences, are not defined within the Nicene Creed. The attempt to use the Creed to explain God's energies by reducing God existences <b>to</b> <b>mere</b> energies (actualities, activities, potentials) could be perceived as the heresy of semi-Sabellianism by advocates of Personalism, according to Meyendorff. Eastern Orthodox theologians have complained about this problem in the Roman Catholic dogmatic teaching of actus purus.|$|E
25|$|On Saturday, {{conditions}} were so poor, with visibility down <b>to</b> <b>mere</b> ten yards, that the organizers scheduled an additional practice session for Sunday morning.

Jackie Stewart in his Matra MS10 was down in sixth place on the grid. At the time, Ickx became the youngest person ever to sit on pole, a record beaten 14 years later when Andrea de Cesaris achieved pole position at the 1982 United States Grand Prix West.|$|E
25|$|Today's {{critics of}} Voltaire's opinion are {{directed}} primarily at his economic {{assessment of the}} Canadian colony. Voltaire’s idea of the Canadian colony based essentially on fur trade was, even {{at the time of}} his own writings, already outdated by almost a century. Thus, although it may be difficult to determine exactly what part of his depiction of Canada might be attributed to deliberate exaggeration for polemical purposes, to attachment to a preconceived idea or <b>to</b> <b>mere</b> misinformation, his few writings on the subject do seem to display a certain level of short-sightedness regarding the actual level of economic evolution that had, by then, already been reached in the settled parts of Canada and about the colony’s potential for further development.|$|E

25|$|The next {{election}} of a Polish king had occurred in 1386, with the selection of Władysław II Jagiełło (Jogaila), Grand Duke of Lithuania, as the first king of Poland's second dynasty. The electors chose Władysław II Jagiełło as king, and he married a daughter of Louis I, Jadwiga of Poland, but had no promise that his dynasty would continue on the throne. He would need to issue more privileges to the nobility to secure the guarantee that upon his death, {{one of his sons}} would inherit. The royal council chose the candidates, and the delegates of nobility and towns confirmed them during the sejm. The principle of election continued in effect throughout the nearly two centuries of the Jagiellon Dynasty, but just as in Piast times, it actually amounted <b>to</b> <b>mere</b> confirmation of the incoming heir.|$|E
25|$|In cool climates (such as in {{the high}} Arctic or at high elevations), the depth of a scrape nest can be {{critical}} to both the survival of developing eggs and the fitness of the parent bird incubating them. The scrape must be deep enough that eggs are protected from the convective cooling caused by cold winds, but shallow enough that they and the parent bird are not too exposed to the cooling influences of ground temperatures, particularly where the permafrost layer rises <b>to</b> <b>mere</b> centimeters below the nest. Studies have shown that an egg within a scrape nest loses heat 9% more slowly than an egg placed on the ground beside the nest; in such a nest lined with natural vegetation, heat loss is reduced by an additional 25%. The insulating factor of nest lining is apparently so critical to egg survival that some species, including Kentish plovers, will restore experimentally altered levels of insulation to their pre-adjustment levels (adding or subtracting material as necessary) within 24 hours.|$|E
25|$|Starting {{with the}} Religions Law of May 1938, a cult of Emperor-worship closely {{modeled after the}} Imperial cult in Japan where the Showa Emperor was worshiped as a living god, began in Manchukuo. Just as in Japan, {{schoolchildren}} began their classes by praying to {{a portrait of the}} emperor while imperial rescripts and the imperial regalia become sacred relics imbued with magical powers by being associated with the god-emperor. As the Emperor Puyi was considered to be a living god, his will could not be limited by any law, and the purpose of the law was starkly reduced down to serving the will of the emperor rather than upholding values and rules. As in Japan, the idea governing the legal philosophy in Manchukuo was the Emperor was a living god who was responsible to no-one and who delegated some of his powers down <b>to</b> <b>mere</b> human beings who had the duty of obeying the will of the god-emperors. In Japan and Manchukuo, the actions of the god-emperors were always just and moral because gods could never do wrong, rather than because the god-emperors were acting to uphold moral values that existed a prior.|$|E
