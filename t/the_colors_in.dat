5|$|Derrickson {{was fascinated}} by color schemes. He chose blue-green and orange as the primary colors for The Day the Earth Stood Still. The missile silo {{converted}} by the military for experimenting on Gort emphasized gray and orange, which was inspired by an image of lava flowing through a gray field. Derrickson opted to shoot on traditional film, and rendered <b>the</b> <b>colors</b> <b>in</b> post-production {{to make them more}} subtle, for realism.|$|E
5|$|Over one {{thousand}} artists and technicians {{were used in}} the making of Fantasia, which features more than 500 animated characters. Segments were color-keyed scene by scene so <b>the</b> <b>colors</b> <b>in</b> a single shot would harmonize between proceeding and following ones. Before a segment's narrative pattern was complete, an overall color scheme was designed to the general mood of the music, and patterned to correspond with the development of the subject matter. The studio's character model department would also sculpt three-dimensional clay models so the animators could view their subject from all angles.|$|E
5|$|Singer and cinematographer Newton Thomas Sigel chose {{different}} styles for the separate {{halves of the}} film. Elegant camerawork such as cranes were used as the plot builds to the attempt on Hitler's life, and the second half is frantic with handheld cinematography as the plotters are hunted down. <b>The</b> <b>colors</b> <b>in</b> the film also become more intense as the story continues. Sigel focused on red, {{the color of the}} Nazi flag, which he felt represented the violence of their ideology. Singer looked towards thrillers of the 1940s and home movies shot by Eva Braun for inspiration. Shooting scenes at night was difficult because presenting historical accuracy of the era required blackouts. Sigel noted in real life, car headlights were used for the firing squad to aim at and execute the plotters in the Bendlerblock. Singer chose to shoot in 1:85 aspect ratio, and since filming took place in Germany, the director used Arriflex cameras with Zeiss lenses.|$|E
40|$|Negative afterimage {{appears in}} our vision when we shift our gaze from an over stimulated {{original}} image {{to a new}} area with a uniform <b>color.</b> <b>The</b> <b>colors</b> of negative afterimages differ from <b>the</b> old stimulating <b>colors</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> original image when <b>the</b> <b>color</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> new area is either neutral or chromatic. The interaction between stimulating <b>colors</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> test and inducing field in the original image changes our color perception due to simultaneous contrast, and the interaction between changed <b>colors</b> perceived <b>in</b> <b>the</b> previously-viewed field and <b>the</b> <b>color</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> currently-viewed field also affects our perception of <b>colors</b> <b>in</b> negative afterimages due to successive contrast. Based on these observations we propose a computational model to estimate colors of negative afterimages in more general cases where <b>the</b> original stimulating <b>color</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> test field is chromatic, and <b>the</b> original stimulating <b>color</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> inducing field and <b>the</b> new stimulating <b>color</b> can be either neutral or chromatic. We validate our model with human experiments. Comment: 10 pages, 6 figue...|$|R

25|$|The PlayStation Move motion {{controller}} {{features an}} orb {{at the head}} which can glow in any of {{a full range of}} colors using RGB light-emitting diodes (LEDs). Based on <b>the</b> <b>colors</b> <b>in</b> the user environment captured by the camera, the system dynamically selects an orb color that can be distinguished {{from the rest of the}} scene. The colored light serves as an active marker, the position of which can be tracked along the image plane by the camera. The uniform spherical shape and known size of the light also allows the system to simply determine the controller's distance from the camera through the light's image size, thus enabling the controller's position to be tracked in three dimensions with high precision and accuracy. The simple sphere-based distance calculation allows the controller to operate with minimal processing latency, as opposed to other camera-based control techniques on the PlayStation 3.|$|E

25|$|However, the Meditator {{realizes that}} he is often {{convinced}} when he is dreaming that he is sensing real objects. He feels certain that he is awake and sitting by the fire, but reflects that often he has dreamed this very sort of thing and been wholly convinced by it. Though his present sensations may be dream images, he suggests that even dream images are drawn from waking experience, much like paintings in that respect. Even when a painter creates an imaginary creature, like a mermaid, the composite parts are drawn from real things—women and fish, {{in the case of}} a mermaid. And even when a painter creates something entirely new, at least <b>the</b> <b>colors</b> <b>in</b> the painting are drawn from real experience. Thus, the Meditator concludes, though he can doubt composite things, he cannot doubt the simple and universal parts from which they are constructed like shape, quantity, size, time, etc. While we can doubt studies based on composite things, like medicine, astronomy, or physics, he concludes that we cannot doubt studies based on simple things, like arithmetic and geometry.|$|E

25|$|Foragers first go {{in search}} of water, which they collect in {{multiple}} trips. This water is then regurgitated {{on the surface of}} the nest material (typically plant fibers). The water serves as a type of glue, adhering the fibers of the nest material, beginning the formation of a ball. The water also serves to moisten and soften the fibers of the pulp so it is easier to manipulate for the formation of the nest. Using their mandibles, the foraging wasps remove the plant fibers (pulp) from its surface. This forms a ball of pulp, and the wasp will move around the immediate area in order to collect enough pulp (a ball that is about the size of its head, 2–4mm). This collection process only takes a few minutes. At this point, the forager returns to the nest, carrying the pulp mass. Either the forager or the queen wasp will take the pulp and apply it to the growing nest. The forager repeats this process multiple times in a day, usually for many hours. Interestingly, there is evidence that foragers collect the same foraging material on each trip. In nests that are made out of materials with distinct colors, researchers found that each forager collected only one of <b>the</b> <b>colors</b> <b>in</b> the nest, creating a colorful nest.|$|E

500|$|Bart's voice actor, Nancy Cartwright, {{wrote in}} her {{autobiography}} My Life as a 10-Year-Old Boy that the episode's script gives the audience a [...] "visual and aural feast". She said the background designers [...] "must have gone on another field trip for this one" [...] because they captured {{the look of a}} typical musical recording studio. The recording studio in the episode, where Lurleen records her new songs with the Simpson family, features two rooms, one for the artist and one for the engineer, with a pane of glass between them. Cartwright said the designers added their own [...] "special touch" [...] by putting a few cracks on the walls, designing a slightly dilapidated ceiling, and by making it look as if the soundproofing on the walls is falling off. The property designers went on a field trip to Sun Studio to receive inspiration for the props in the recording studio, such as the [...] "in session" [...] red light, the mixing board, the musical instruments, and the volume-unit meters that indicates how loud the artist is singing. For the interior design of the recording studio, the color designers mixed colors such as orange, mauve, gray, and brown to make them complement each other. <b>The</b> <b>colors</b> <b>in</b> the engineer's booth were darker to make Homer's white suit stand out from the background. The appearance of the engineer at the recording studio was based on John Boylan, an American music producer who produced the highly successful album The Simpsons Sing the Blues. Lurleen's mobile home was designed to be [...] "very confined" [...] and [...] "tiny" [...] so that the compositions of Homer and Lurleen would be tighter, thus giving the scene an intimate, romantic feeling.|$|E
