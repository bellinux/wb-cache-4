5|$|In late 2011, Shadows Fall {{entered the}} studio to begin {{recording}} their seventh studio album. While in the studio, they held live video streams to discuss {{the progress of the}} album and answer questions from fans. This album is the first to be produced by Adam Dutkiewicz since the band's original studio release, Somber Eyes to the Sky. Fire From <b>the</b> <b>Sky</b> <b>was</b> released on May 15, 2012 through Razor & Tie.|$|E
5|$|Instead, {{a system}} of {{multiple}} receiver antennas was adopted, each one located so that only a certain section of <b>the</b> <b>sky</b> <b>was</b> visible. Two horizontal receivers were mounted {{on either side of}} the fuselage and only saw reflections from the left or right, slightly overlapping in the middle. Two vertical receivers were mounted above and below the wing, seeing reflections above or below the aircraft.|$|E
5|$|During the {{afternoon}} of July 16, 1904, a severe thunderstorm produced a strong tornado that touched down around 3:30pm EST in Chappaqua, New York. Residents reported the first indication of the thunderstorm was a large black cloud approaching the region. <b>The</b> <b>sky</b> <b>was</b> reportedly completely dark as torrential rain and high winds commenced. Intense lightning and loud thunder prompted people to seek shelter in their cellars. The tornado tracked directly through Chappaqua before moving towards the Hudson River. Upon reaching the river, the tornado became a waterspout that was powerful enough to uncover the river bed below it. The waterspout eventually dissipated by 4:00pm EST. The tornado was later rated as F3 on the modern-day Fujita scale.|$|E

5|$|Mysore was the {{location}} of the first private radio broadcasting station in India when Akashavani (voice from <b>the</b> <b>sky)</b> <b>was</b> established in the city on 10 September 1935 by M.V. Gopalaswamy, a professor of psychology, at his house in the Vontikoppal area of Mysore, using a 50-watt transmitter. The station was taken over by the princely state of Mysore in 1941 and was moved to Bangalore in 1955. In 1957, Akashvani was chosen as the official name of All India Radio (AIR), the radio broadcaster of the Government of India. The AIR station at Mysore broadcasts an FM radio channel at 100.6MHz, and Gyan Vani broadcasts on 105.2. BIG FM and Red FM are the two private FM channels operating in the city.|$|E

5|$|The Battle of Alexander at Issus {{is painted}} on a limewood panel {{measuring}} , and portrays {{the moment of}} Alexander the Great's victory. The vertical format was dictated by the space available in the room for which the painting was commissioned – each in William's set of eight was made {{to be the same}} size. At an unknown date, the panel was cut down on all sides, particularly at the top, so <b>the</b> <b>sky</b> <b>was</b> originally larger and the moon further from the corner of the scene. The scene is approached from an impossible viewpoint – at first only feet from the fray, the perspective gradually ascends to encompass the seas and continents in the background and eventually the curvature of the Earth itself.|$|E
5|$|Typewriter in <b>the</b> <b>Sky</b> <b>was</b> {{generally}} well-received, {{and regular}} readers of Hubbard's stories {{at the time}} widely appreciated the work. Anthony Boucher and J. Francis McComas wrote in a 1951 review that the story was amusing though it could have used copy editing, and Groff Conklin described its concept as silly. The New York Times review the same year said it had a lively pace. Damon Knight was critical of the depiction of the protagonist's fate, and concluded {{the ending of the}} book made up for this defect. Books including The Classic Era of American Pulp Magazines and Pulp Culture: The Art of Fiction Magazines characterized the work as one of Hubbard's best stories. Adam Roberts pointed out Hubbard likely based the character of pulp fiction writer Horace Hackett on himself.|$|E
5|$|The galactic {{plane of}} the Milky Way passes through Perseus, whose {{brightest}} star is the yellow-white supergiant Alpha Persei (also called Mirfak or Mirphak), which shines at magnitude 1.79. It {{and many of the}} surrounding stars are members of an open cluster known as the Alpha Persei Cluster. The best-known star, however, is Algol (Beta Persei), linked with ominous legends because of its variability, which is noticeable to the naked eye. Rather than being an intrinsically variable star, it is an eclipsing binary. Other notable star systems in Perseus include X Persei, a binary system containing a neutron star, and GK Persei, a nova that peaked at magnitude 0.2 in 1901. The Double Cluster, comprising two open clusters quite near each other in <b>the</b> <b>sky,</b> <b>was</b> known to the ancient Chinese. The constellation gives its name to the Perseus cluster (Abell 426), a massive galaxy cluster located 250 million light-years from Earth. It hosts the radiant of the annual Perseids meteor shower—one of the most prominent meteor showers in the sky.|$|E

5|$|The {{morning of}} the {{evacuation}} promised a perfect day. The sun rose out of a calm and sparkling sea and warmed the impassive cliffs of Oiseval. <b>The</b> <b>sky</b> <b>was</b> hopelessly blue {{and the sight of}} Hirta, green and pleasant as the island of so many careless dreams, made parting all the more difficult. Observing tradition the islanders left an open Bible and a small pile of oats in each house, locked all the doors and at 7am boarded the Harebell. Although exhausted by the strain and hard work of the last few days, they were reported to have stayed cheerful throughout the operation. But as the long antler of Dun fell back onto the horizon and the familiar outline of the island grew faint, the severing of an ancient tie became a reality and the St Kildans gave way to tears.|$|E
5|$|Although clepsydrae {{were more}} useful than sundials—they {{could be used}} indoors, during the night, and also when <b>the</b> <b>sky</b> <b>was</b> cloudy—they were not as {{accurate}}; the Greeks, therefore, sought a way to improve their water clocks. Although still not as accurate as sundials, Greek water clocks became more accurate around 325, and they were adapted to have a face with an hour hand, making {{the reading of the}} clock more precise and convenient. One of the more common problems in most types of clepsydrae was caused by water pressure: when the container holding the water was full, the increased pressure caused the water to flow more rapidly. This problem was addressed by Greek and Roman horologists beginning in 100, and improvements continued {{to be made in the}} following centuries. To counteract the increased water flow, the clock's water containers—usually bowls or jugs—were given a conical shape; positioned with the wide end up, a greater amount of water had to flow out in order to drop the same distance as when the water was lower in the cone. Along with this improvement, clocks were constructed more elegantly in this period, with hours marked by gongs, doors opening to miniature figurines, bells, or moving mechanisms. There were some remaining problems, however, which were never solved, such as the effect of temperature. Water flows more slowly when cold, or may even freeze.|$|E
5|$|In past Zelda titles, {{the team}} had made {{numerous}} new fields for player exploration, but this time they limited the number of overworlds to three and expanded their content so players {{would be able to}} full appreciate them through repeated visits. The team also created the world based on their experiences with Twilight Princess: feeling that the overworld and dungeons were too large with puzzles too thinly dispersed, the team both sought to compact areas and have environmental puzzles in the overworld. The biggest difficulty was ensuring that players could reach areas quickly while still discovering new features and puzzles. The creation of the Skyloft overworld was due to difficulties connecting the three Surface-based overworlds with each other due to drastically contrasting environments. <b>The</b> <b>sky</b> <b>was</b> initially going to be presented similar to the course selection screen from the Super Mario series, but this was changed to an overworld with its own quests and population so Link had a place where he could prepare for his adventures. An initial idea, when jumping down from the sky seemed unlikely to be approved, was to have a huge tower acting as a central hub, with the height at which Link jumped lengthening the duration of his free fall. Once the concept of traveling from the sky had been chosen instead, the Loftwing mounts were created so it looked and felt more rational to players. These overlapping gameplay mechanics triggered the creation of Skyloft, along with elements of the early game such as the Knight Academy. The continual movements and routines of Skyloft's people were modeled after similar time-driven mechanics from , with similar links between character-specific side quests and the main narrative. Despite the aerial element, the mechanics necessary for free navigation meant a Loftwing racing minigame could not be implemented.|$|E

5|$|Myers {{made one}} hundred oxy-hydrogen balloon bombs for the {{government}} to do a full scale experiment of producing rain. The balloons were 10, 12, and 20 feet in diameter. The purpose of the Texas experiment was to see if making artificial rain could be done by man-made weather modification. After the experiment took place it was reported that the result was a success of what was hoped for. The news press release of August 20, 1891, reported that rain was made to fall two days before at three o'clock in the afternoon. At the time <b>the</b> <b>sky</b> <b>was</b> clear and there was no prediction of rain in the area for at least a week. The claim was that the rain produced was directly or indirectly caused by the explosion of the oxygen-hydrogen balloon bombs that were exploded electrically at altitudes of 1800 to 3000 feet. That started a sequence of events that lead to a torrent. The rain storm that ensued was reported by ranchers and railroad linemen for some thousand miles across several states. After this Myers was contracted by paper companies in New York state to see about producing rain in their forests that needed it badly. He contended that the Mohawk Valley was {{a good place to start}} rain and that the rainfall then would go to the Adirondack Mountains and Catskill Mountains.|$|E
