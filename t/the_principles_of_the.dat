5|$|In 1821, the Greeks revolted against centuries-long Ottoman rule. They won {{numerous}} victories {{early on}} and declared independence. However, the declaration contradicted <b>the</b> <b>principles</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Congress of Vienna and of the Holy Alliance, which imposed a European equilibrium of the status quo, outlawing any change. In contrast to what happened elsewhere in Europe, the Holy Alliance did not intervene to stop the liberal Greek insurgents.|$|E
5|$|In May 1856, Benjamin {{joined the}} Democrats, stating they had <b>the</b> <b>principles</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> old-time Whig Party. He indicated, {{in a letter}} to constituents, that as Northern Whigs had failed to vote to uphold the rights granted to Southern states in the Constitution, the Whigs, as a {{national}} party, were no more.|$|E

5|$|After the {{accession}} of the Roman Catholic Mary I, Cranmer was put {{on trial}} for treason and heresy. Imprisoned {{for over two years}} and under pressure from Church authorities, he made several recantations and apparently reconciled himself with the Roman Catholic Church. However, on the day of his execution, he withdrew his recantations, to die a heretic to Roman Catholics and a martyr for <b>the</b> <b>principles</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> English Reformation. Cranmer's death was immortalised in Foxe's Book of Martyrs and his legacy lives on within the Church of England through the Book of Common Prayer and the Thirty-Nine Articles, an Anglican statement of faith derived from his work.|$|E
50|$|In {{his book}} Philosophy of Logic (1999), he {{introduced}} a theory named <b>the</b> <b>Principle</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Logical. He defines <b>the</b> <b>Principle</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Logical {{as an ideal}} matrix <b>of</b> <b>the</b> logical <b>principles</b> or laws <b>of</b> thought (<b>the</b> law <b>of</b> identity, <b>the</b> law <b>of</b> non-contradiction, <b>the</b> law <b>of</b> excluded middle, <b>the</b> law <b>of</b> sufficient reason).|$|R
50|$|In {{the second}} reading, which in theory is {{supposed}} to occur two weekends after the first reading, a debate on <b>the</b> general <b>principles</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> bill {{is followed by a}} vote. This is the main opportunity to debate <b>the</b> <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> bill rather than individual clauses. A division at this stage, therefore, represents a direct challenge to <b>the</b> <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> bill. If the bill is read a second time, it proceeds to the committee stage.|$|R
5000|$|Liang's great rival among {{progressive}} intellectuals was Dr. Sun Yat-sen, {{a republican}} revolutionary. Sun felt that democracy {{would be impossible}} {{as long as the}} Qing monarchy still existed. Democracy was part <b>of</b> his platform, <b>the</b> Three <b>Principles</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> People (三民主義) - <b>the</b> <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> people under 1 nation (nationalism), <b>the</b> <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> people's rights (democracy), and <b>the</b> <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> people's livelihood and well-being (civility, decency and respect). Like Liang, Sun agreed that democracy, or at least universal suffrage, could not happen overnight in a country with high illiteracy rates and lack of political consciousness. Sun's Three Stages of Revolution called for a period of [...] "political tutelage" [...] where people would be educated before elections can occur.|$|R
5|$|Conditions in Biafra worsened {{as the war}} continued. In September 1968, {{the city}} of Aba fell to the Nigerian {{military}} and Achebe once again moved his family, this time to Umuahia, where the Biafran government had also relocated. He was chosen to chair the newly formed National Guidance Committee, charged {{with the task of}} drafting principles and ideas for the post-war era. In 1969, the group completed a document entitled <b>The</b> <b>Principles</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Biafran Revolution, later released as The Ahiara Declaration.|$|E
5|$|Dalhousie {{was founded}} as the Lieutenant Governor of Nova Scotia George Ramsay, 9th Earl of Dalhousie desired a non-denominational college in Halifax. Financing largely came from customs duties {{collected}} by a previous Lieutenant Governor, John Coape Sherbrooke, during the War of 1812 occupation of Castine, Maine; Sherbrooke invested GBP£7,000 as an initial endowment and reserved £3,000 {{for the physical}} construction of the college. The college was established in 1818, though it faltered shortly after as Ramsay left Halifax {{to serve as the}} Governor General of British North America. The school was structured upon <b>the</b> <b>principles</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> University of Edinburgh, where lectures were open to all, regardless of religion or nationality. The University of Edinburgh was located near Ramsay's home in Scotland.|$|E
5|$|European Union law (EU law) has {{prescribed}} {{the structure}} of and relationships between all European cattle herd books since 1977. However, {{it was not until}} 2007 that the French Limousin Herd Book began a process of restructuring to comply with relevant EU regulations, directives and decisions. EU law affecting stud cattle breeding in Europe derives principally from an EU objective to achieve free movement of goods between member countries, and to address farmer and consumer protectionist and interventionist actions that oppose <b>the</b> <b>principles</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> EU Common Agricultural Policy. Intervention by member countries in their agricultural sectors poses an obstacle to free trade in European countries, which EU legislation, among other things, attempts to address.|$|E

5|$|Heber was {{interested}} {{in all aspects of}} Indian life and quickly made friends, both with the local population and with the representatives of non-Anglican churches. Occasionally his easy manner and lavish hospitality clashed with <b>the</b> <b>principles</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> more puritan and evangelical of his clergy; one such, Isaac Wilson of the CMS, used a sermon to mount a direct attack on the bishop after what he considered were excessive celebrations following a baptismal service. Wilson was forced to apologise after Heber threatened him with a Consistory court.|$|E
5|$|Historian Matti Moosa {{considered}} Marrash to be {{the first}} truly cosmopolitan Arab intellectual and writer of modern times. Marrash adhered to <b>the</b> <b>principles</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> French Revolution and defended them in his own works, implicitly criticizing Ottoman rule in Western Asia and North Africa. He was also influential in introducing French romanticism in the Arab world, especially through his use of poetic prose and prose poetry, of which his writings were the first examples in modern Arabic literature, according to Salma Khadra Jayyusi and Shmuel Moreh. His modes of thinking and feeling, and ways of expressing them, have had a lasting influence on contemporary Arab thought and on the Mahjari poets.|$|E
5|$|Houses at Noel Park were {{deliberately}} {{designed to}} be relatively small, both for cheapness and to discourage tenants from taking on lodgers. Many of the larger houses at Shaftesbury Park had been sublet and split, and the practice went against <b>the</b> <b>principles</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Artizans Company's founders. To discourage the practice at Queen's Park and Noel Park, cottage flats were built; these maintained the terraced façade, but split the house into upper and lower flats, each flat having a separate front door onto the street. Many properties, particularly on the central Gladstone Avenue, were built in this style; this maintained the unbroken façade of the first-class houses, but allowed large numbers of smaller and low-income families to be housed.|$|E

5|$|Latter Days premiered at the Philadelphia International Gay & Lesbian Film Festival on July 10, 2003 and was {{released}} {{in various states of}} USA over the next 12 months. Later the film {{was released}} in a few other countries and shown at several gay film festivals. It was the first film to portray openly the clash between <b>the</b> <b>principles</b> <b>of</b> <b>The</b> Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and homosexuality, and its exhibition in some U.S. states was controversial. Various religious groups demanded that the film be withdrawn from theaters and video stores under boycott threats.|$|E
5|$|One of the {{earliest}} garden suburbs in the world, Noel Park was designed to provide affordable housing for working-class families wishing to leave the inner city; every property had both a front and back garden. It was planned from the outset as a self-contained community {{close enough to the}} rail network to allow its residents to commute to work. In line with <b>the</b> <b>principles</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Artizans Company's founder, William Austin, no public houses were built within the estate, and there are still none today.|$|E
5|$|The Crisis carried editorials by Du Bois that {{supported}} the ideals of unionized labor but excoriated the racism demonstrated by its leaders, who systematically excluded blacks from membership. Du Bois also supported <b>the</b> <b>principles</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Socialist Party (he was briefly {{a member of the}} party from 1910 to 1912), but he denounced the racism demonstrated by some socialist leaders.Lewis, p. 275 (denounced). Frustrated by Republican president Taft's failure to address widespread lynching, Du Bois endorsed Democratic candidate Woodrow Wilson in the 1912 presidential race, in exchange for Wilson's promise to support black causes.|$|E

Although welcoming <b>the</b> <b>principles</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> new governance arrangements, the forum (in 2011) and the Friends of Richmond Park (in 2012) have expressed concerns about the composition of the new board.|$|E
5|$|The General Court, as the {{legislative}} and judicial bodies, and the Governor, {{as the chief}} executive of the colony, constituted a political system of division of power. It followed a recommendation in John Calvin's political theory to set up several institutions which complement and control each other in a system of checks and balances in order to minimize the misuse of political power. In 1625, the settlers had repaid their debts and thus gained complete possession of the colony. The colony was de facto a republic, since neither an English company nor the King and Parliament exerted any influence—a representative democracy governed on <b>the</b> <b>principles</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Mayflower Compact ("self-rule").|$|E
5|$|The Renaissance in Scotland was a cultural, {{intellectual}} and artistic movement in Scotland, {{from the late}} fifteenth century {{to the beginning of}} the seventeenth century. It is associated with the pan-European Renaissance that is usually regarded as beginning in Italy in the late fourteenth century and reaching northern Europe as a Northern Renaissance in the fifteenth century. It involved an attempt to revive <b>the</b> <b>principles</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> classical era, including humanism, a spirit of scholarly enquiry, scepticism, and concepts of balance and proportion. Since the twentieth century the uniqueness and unity of the Renaissance has been challenged by historians, but significant changes in Scotland can be seen to have taken place in education, intellectual life, literature, art, architecture, music and politics.|$|E
