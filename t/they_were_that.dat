He also has a minimal social media {{presence}} and controls all of his US bookings personally. Some of his friends told The New York Times author of a 2017 profile piece on Taborn [...] "how relieved <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>that</b> someone, at last, was profiling him, as if he were being forced out of hiding".|$|E

Seen from inside, they address a fear that things are not as <b>they</b> <b>were,</b> <b>that</b> a combination of immigration and membership of the European Union poses {{a challenge to the}} traditions of the Nordic way of life. In some way the fact that Finland has joined the EU demonstrates that the country is no longer just the small, poor, well-behaved neighbour of the Nordic block.|$|E
500|$|The game {{received}} very {{mixed reviews}} from gaming publications. The Japanese magazine Weekly Famitsu gave the title {{a score of}} 28 out of 40, praising its graphics, usage of real cars and innovative driver's view perspective. The American magazine Game Informer and website GameZone also lauded the game's realistic car interiors and highly detailed environments, putting them on par with those of Ridge Racer V and Gran Turismo 3: A-Spec. Still, Allgame noted {{the presence of a}} subtle shimmering effect in the graphics, an effect typically seen on early PlayStation 2 titles, while the American website Game Revolution found the graphics [...] "severely jagged". The shimmering and jaggedness were also noted by GameSpot and the American website IGN, which did not feel <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>that</b> irritating.|$|E

500|$|Nine {{days before}} the start of production, neither Quint nor Hooper had been cast. The role of Quint was {{originally}} offered to actors Lee Marvin and Sterling Hayden, both of whom passed. Zanuck and Brown had just finished working with Robert Shaw on The Sting, and suggested him to Spielberg. Shaw was reluctant to take the role since he did not like the book, but decided to accept at the urging of both his wife, actress Mary Ure, and his secretary—"The last time <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>that</b> enthusiastic was From Russia with Love. And they were right." [...] Shaw based his performance on fellow cast member Craig Kingsbury, a local fisherman, farmer, and legendary eccentric, who was playing fisherman Ben Gardner. Spielberg described Kingsbury as [...] "the purest version of who, in my mind, Quint was", and some of his offscreen utterances were incorporated into the script as lines of Gardner and Quint. Another source for some of Quint's dialogue and mannerisms, especially in the third act at sea, was Vineyard mechanic and boat-owner Lynn Murphy.|$|E
500|$|Based on a re-evaluation of the {{original}} sources used by the medieval historians, the Oxford scholar James Howard-Johnston, in his acclaimed 2010 book Witnesses to a World Crisis: Historians and Histories of the Middle East in the Seventh Century, rejects the traditional interpretation of events, based on Theophanes, in favour of the Syriac chroniclers' version. Howard-Johnston asserts that no siege actually took place, based not only on its absence in the eastern sources, {{but also on the}} logistical impossibility of such an undertaking for the duration reported. Instead, he believes that the reference to a siege was a later interpolation, influenced by the events of the second Arab siege of 717–718, by an anonymous source that was then used by Theophanes. According to Howard-Johnston, [...] "The blockade of Constantinople in the 670s is a myth which has been allowed to mask the very real success achieved by the Byzantines in the last decade of Mu'awiya’s caliphate, first by sea off Lycia and then on land, through an insurgency which, before long, aroused deep anxiety among the Arabs, conscious as <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>that</b> they had merely coated the Middle East with their power".|$|E
500|$|Oxford, {{who were}} {{considered}} strong favourites, won the toss and elected {{to start from}} the Surrey station. [...] The race commenced at 2.50pm. [...] Oxford took an early lead and were half a length ahead at Craven Cottage. [...] Cambridge drew back into contention and were nearly level as the crews passed the Mile Post, recording the same times. [...] A push from Oxford saw them move away from Cambridge with a lead of two lengths by Hammersmith Bridge. [...] Although increasing their rate to try to reduce the deficit, Cambridge's rowing became untidy and Oxford were able to capitalise, passing Chiswick Steps with a lead of three lengths, and shooting Barnes Bridge four up. [...] Passing the finishing post with a lead of 15 seconds, Oxford won by four lengths {{in a time of}} 18 minutes 7 seconds, the third-fastest {{time in the history of}} the event, slower only than Cambridge's winning times in the 1934 and 1938 races. [...] A correspondent writing in The Times suggested that [...] "if there were any surprises at all ... <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>that</b> this notoriously fickle event went so exactly to form." ...|$|E

2500|$|Johann Wolfgang von Goethe says, [...] "Treat {{people as}} <b>they</b> <b>were</b> <b>that</b> {{they ought to}} be and you may help them to become what they are capable of being". As a leader, there are two qualities that you need to focus on in an organization: the {{structure}} of the organization and how followers are involved. The type of leadership you want in an organization would be a democratic approach. A democratic leader does not feel threatened when followers make suggestions, but instead accepts the contributions to help improve the overall quality of decision-making. Having a democratic system allows for the followers to set goals for the organization, and this creates two-way communication that openly flows between the leader and followers. The leader wants to have more interaction with the followers. Through interaction it allows followers to be engaged in the organization, but they also have a higher participation rate. The democratic style of leadership communication is often most effective. Generally, the benefits derived from democratic communication far outweigh any potential cost.|$|E

60|$|The Word of God is {{an awful}} Word to a broken-hearted man. Solomon says, 'The word of a king is as the roaring of a lion'; and if so, what is the Word of God? for by the wrath and fear is meant the {{authoritative}} word of a king. We have a proverb, 'The burnt child dreads the fire, the whipped child fears the rod'; even so the broken-hearted fears the Word of God. Hence you have a remark set upon them that tremble at God's Word, to wit, <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>they</b> <b>that</b> keep among the godly; <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>they</b> <b>that</b> keep within compass; <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>they</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> aptest to mourn, and {{to stand in the}} gap, when God is angry; and to turn away his wrath from a people.|$|R
