A small addition of thorium to tungsten thermocathodes considerably reduced the work function of electrons; as the result, electrons are emitted at considerably lower temperatures. Tungsten forms a one-atom-thick layer {{on the surface of}} thorium. The work function from a thorium surface is lowered possibly because of the electric field on the interface between thorium and tungsten formed due to thorium's greater electropositivity.

2500|$|Large {{transmitting}} tubes have carbonized tungsten filaments {{containing a}} small trace (1% to 2%) [...] of thorium.

Such <b>thoriated</b> tungsten cathodes usually deliver lifetimes in the tens of thousands of hours. The end-of-life scenario for a thoriated-tungsten filament is when the carbonized layer has mostly been converted back into another form of tungsten carbide and emission begins to drop off rapidly; a complete loss of thorium has never been found to be a factor in the end-of-life in a tube with this type of emitter.|$|E

50|$|Magnesium-thorium alloys {{have been}} used in several {{military}} applications, particularly in missile construction. The most noted example of this is the ramjet components in the CIM-10 Bomarc missile and Lockheed D-21 drone, which implemented <b>thoriated</b> magnesium in their engine construction. This is due to <b>thoriated</b> magnesium alloys being lightweight, having high strength, and creep resistance up to 350 Â°C. But, these alloys are no longer used due to radiation concerns involving thorium's radioactivity. This has resulted in several missiles being removed from public display. Similarly, the structure of the Equipment and Retro-Rocket Modules of the Gemini spacecraft (the white-painted portions) were made of <b>thoriated</b> magnesium for their strength-to-weight ratio and thermal properties.

50|$|Thorium-containing alloys are {{not usually}} used, since a thorium content of more than 2% {{requires}} that a component be handled as a radioactive material, although <b>thoriated</b> magnesium was used in military and aerospace applications in the 1950s.|$|E
50|$|The {{most common}} type of {{directly}} heated cathode, used in most high power transmitting tubes, is the <b>thoriated</b> tungsten filament, discovered in 1914 and made practical by Irving Langmuir in 1923. A small amount of thorium is added to the tungsten of the filament. The filament is heated white-hot, at about 2400 Â°C, and thorium atoms migrate {{to the surface of the}} filament and form the emissive layer. Heating the filament in a hydrocarbon atmosphere carburizes the surface and stabilizes the emissive layer. <b>Thoriated</b> filaments can have very long lifetimes and are resistant to the ion bombardment that occurs at high voltages, because fresh thorium continually diffuses to the surface, renewing the layer. They are used in nearly all high-power vacuum tubes for radio transmitters, and in some tubes for hi-fi amplifiers. Their lifetimes tend to be longer than those of oxide cathodes.|$|E
50|$|Another {{concern for}} the <b>thoriated</b> {{magnesium}} alloys is the low melting point and rapid oxidation of the metal.

50|$|Thorium dioxide was {{formerly}} added to glasses during manufacture {{to increase their}} refractive index, producing <b>thoriated</b> glass with up to 40% ThO2 content.

50|$|Thorium dioxide {{is used as}} a {{stabilizer}} in tungsten electrodes in TIG welding, electron tubes, {{and aircraft}} engines.
