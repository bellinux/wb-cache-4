40|$|AbstractTo analyze {{interactions}} between single steps of process chains, variations in material properties, especially the near-surface microstructure {{and the resulting}} mechanical properties, specimens with <b>tension</b> <b>screw</b> geometry were machined with five different typical process chains. The resulting microstructures were characterized with light optical and scanning electron microscopy, microhardness measurements as well as X-rays. The different process chains and their parameters lead to different developments of the microstructure and the resulting residual stresses. The particular process chain influences the surface integrity and consequently the fatigue behavior in a characteristic manner. The plastic strain amplitude as well as high precision temperature and electrical resistance measurements {{can be used to}} evaluate the fatigue properties of specimens with <b>tension</b> <b>screw</b> geometry. The development of the temperature provides substantial information with respect to cyclic load dependent changes in the microstructure. The load- and cycle-dependent change of the electrical resistance {{is a function of the}} specific electrical resistance, which is directly influenced by the defect structure and defect density of the material. Areas and process chains critical in respect to fatigue can be reliably identified. The measured values can be used as input data for the physically based fatigue life calculation method “PHYBAL” with a very limited number of specimens. Even though the geometry is more complex than a standard fatigue specimen, the calculated lifetimes are in a very good accordance with the conventionally determined S-N curves...|$|E

40|$|Introduction. Pirogow’s {{amputation}} at {{the ankle}} presents a valuable alternative to lower leg amputation {{for patients with}} the corresponding indications. Although this method offers the ability to stay mobile {{without the use of}} a prosthesis, it is rarely performed. This paper proposes a modification regarding the operation method of the Pirogow amputation. The results of the modified operation method on ten patients were objectified 12 months after the operation using a patient questionnaire (Ankle Score). Material and Methods. We modified the original method by rotating the calcaneus. To fix the calcaneus to the tibia, Kirschner wire and a 3 / 0 spongiosa <b>tension</b> <b>screw</b> as well as a Fixateur externe were used. Results. 70 % of those questioned who were amputated following the modified Pirogow method indicated an excellent or very good result in total points whereas in the control group (original Pirogow’s amputation) only 40 % reported excellent or very good result. In addition, the level of pain experienced one year after the completed operation showed different results in favour of the group being operated with the modified way. Furthermore, patients in both groups showed differences in radiological results, postoperative leg length difference, and postoperative mobility. Conclusion. The modified Pirogow amputation presents a valuable alternative to the original amputation method for patients with the corresponding indications. The benefits are found in the significantly reduced pain, difference in reduced radiological complications, the increase in mobility without a prosthesis, and the reduction of postoperative leg length difference...|$|E

Many design features of the preliminary design are under revision with the aim to achieve the built-to-print-status. This paper deals with design and analysis of a bolted joint for the Blanket Shield Module with special perspective on Remote Handling capability. The BSM of the ECH Launcher {{is attached to the}} Launcher Main Frame by a bolted joint conceived so that in the Hot Cell Facility, RH maintenance can be performed on internal components. The joint must be capable to resist very high Electro-Magnetic loads from disruptions, while it has to sustain substantial thermal cycling during operation. Thus the need for a rigid and reliable design is essential. Beside the set of pre-stressed bolts the flanges were therefore equipped with additional shear keys to divert radial moments away from the bolts. Main focus of the work performed was the mechanical {{design of the}} joint and the assessment of the structural integrity with respect to the loads applied and its capability for maintenance by RH procedures. To fulfill a major aspect of the RH requirements, the bolts were designed as captive in order to avoid their accidental removal from the joint. The captive bolt design is based on a concept that uses a dedicated spring ring, a standard spiral spring and a <b>tensioning</b> <b>screw</b> with two threads to secure the bolts in a form-locking stop.

Any deflection of the lever is converted to an axial pull on the valve shaft, lifting the seat off the crown and allowing air to flow.

When the screw is submitted to pullout strength, it causes internal tension near the medullar canal and this situation can be analyzed by using the photoelasticity technique. Objective: Were analyzed those internal tensions near the medullar canal of photoelastic vertebra models using different sizes of screws of the vertebral fixation system submitted to pullout strength. Methods: A lumbar vertebral model made of photoelastic material with three different USS 1 -type pedicular screw sizes (5, 6, and 7 mm) was used. The internal <b>tensions</b> around the <b>screw</b> were tested in 12 predetermined points by a plain transmission polaroscope. Results: The areas of greater tension concentration were between the medullar canal and the curves of the transverse process. Comparing the maximum average pulling tension, statistical differences were observed between screws 5 and 7, and 6 and 7. On the other hand, for screws 5 and 6, there were no significant differences.

Beside bone quality, {{the design of}} a screw influences inter-fragmentary compression. Compres-sive force is achievable for any kind of screw system; however, the primary deformation of the bone is different for the different screw systems. The work necessary to achieve compressive force for primary stability was measured for different screw systems and compared to an AO screw with washer. Materials and Methods: The compressive force was determined as a func-tion of screw advancement for 3 different cannulated screw types (7. 3 -mm AO screw with and without washer, the 6. 5 -mm Herbert screw and the 6. 5 -mm Ideal Compression Screw (I.
