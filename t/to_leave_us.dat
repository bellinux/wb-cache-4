[...] When reviewing the final scene, Marsi commended the appearance of the positive pregnancy test to the audience, calling the it [...] "Quite the cliffhanger <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> <b>us</b> with after a finale that was already pretty darn entertaining.

500|$|Limbo {{initial release}} on the Xbox 360 has {{received}} acclaim from video game critics and journalists; the subsequent {{release of the}} game for the PlayStation 3 and Microsoft Windows platforms received similar praise, holding Metacritic aggregate scores of 90/100 and 88/100, respectively, compared to the 90/100 earned by the Xbox 360 version. Some journalists compared Limbo to previous minimalist platform games such as Another World, Flashback, Heart of Darkness, , Ico, Portal and Braid. Reviews consistently noted Limbo short length for its higher selling price: two to five hours of gameplay for 15 euros or 15 U.S. dollars. Reviewers asserted this length-to-price ratio was the largest drawback for the game, and would be a deterrent for potential buyers. Some journalists contended that {{the length of the}} game was ideal; The Daily Telegraph Tom Hoggins considered the short game to have a [...] "perfectly formed running time", while Daemon Hatfield of IGN commented that [...] "it's better for a game <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> <b>us</b> wanting more than to overstay its welcome". Numerous independent game developers, in an organised [...] "Size Doesn't Matter" [...] effort, commented on the critical response to Limbo length-to-price ratio. The independent developers questioned the need to quantify that ratio, and noted that it only seems {{to be used as a}} factor in judging video games and not other forms of entertainment such as films.|$|E

2500|$|With the {{increase}} of slaves in New York, poor whites had to compete economically. Some slaveholders were artisans who taught their slaves their trade. They could subcontract their work and underbid other white artisans. This created racial and economic tension between the slaves and competing white craftsmen. The governor of New York in 1737 told the legislature, [...] "the artificers complain and with too much reason of the pernicious custom of breeding slaves to trades whereby the honest industrious tradesmen are reduced to poverty for want of employ, {{and many of them}} forced <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> <b>us</b> to seek their living in other countries." [...] Some whites went out of business because of this.|$|E

[...] Kevin O'Sullivan for the Sunday Mirror was critical of Danniella Westbrook's return in 2009, highlighting an [...] "inexplicable personality transplant" [...] in Sam and decrying the [...] "homecoming" [...] storyline as [...] "An insult to long-suffering viewers' intelligence". Comparatively, Virgin Media have rated Sam/Westbrook's return in 2009 as the tenth greatest soap comeback of all time, saying [...] "She was only on screen for five seconds before the famous 'Enders drums signalled the return of Walford's much-missed Mitchell sister. It {{may not have been}} a big surprise to see Sam back, but those scriptwriters sure know how <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> <b>us</b> gasping for more." ...|$|E

[...] The soap’s executive producer Dominic Treadwell-Collins, who has decided not to kill-off Bianca, said: [...] "We are so sad that Patsy has decided <b>to</b> <b>leave</b> <b>us</b> but completely understand it's the right time for her. Bianca won't be leaving Albert Square until the Autumn so there's still a lot more to come from her on screen this year – and the door will be left wide open for her return.

It was revealed months later that an upcoming storyline would involve Bianca and Terry departing alongside their children, minus Liam and Whitney.

2500|$|After the 1864 {{gold rush}} {{in the newly}} {{established}} Montana Territory, pressure upon the Salish intensified from both illegal non-Indian squatters and government officials. In 1870, Victor died, and he was succeeded as chief by his son, Chief Charlot (aka Charlo, Claw of the Little Grizzly). Like his father, Charlot adhered to a policy of nonviolent resistance. He insisted {{on the right of}} his people to remain in the Bitterroot Valley. But territorial citizens and officials thought the new chief could be pressured into capitulating. In 1871, they successfully lobbied President Ulysses S. Grant to declare that the survey required by the treaty had been conducted and that it had found that the Jocko (Flathead) Reservation was better suited {{to the needs of the}} Salish. On the basis of Grant's executive order, Congress sent a delegation, led by future president James Garfield, to make arrangements with the tribe for their removal. Charlot ignored their demands and even their threats of bloodshed, and he again refused to sign any agreement <b>to</b> <b>leave.</b> <b>U.S.</b> officials then simply forged Charlot's [...] "X" [...] onto the official copy of the agreement that was sent to the Senate for ratification.|$|E
