5|$|The {{easiest way}} for the goalkeeper to block shots {{is for them to}} block <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> <b>with</b> either their hands or arms. Longer arms can help the goalkeeper to reach the ball, thus being an advantage. Sports {{involving}} quick reactions may be helpful, as these help the goalkeeper's reflexes which is a crucial skill.|$|E

50|$|Feeding is how <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> {{boys and}} girls give <b>the</b> <b>balls</b> to <b>the</b> players. At {{different}} tournaments, they use different techniques for feeding. At some tournaments, bases have both arms in the air, then feed <b>the</b> <b>balls</b> <b>with</b> one arm; at others, they have one arm in the air which they feed <b>the</b> <b>balls</b> <b>with</b> and <b>the</b> other arm behind their back. When feeding <b>the</b> <b>ball,</b> they must also be aware of a player's preference. Most players accept the standard, which is for <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> boy or girl to gently toss <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> (from <b>the</b> position <b>with</b> their arms extended upwards) such that it bounces one time then to the proper height for the player to catch <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> easily.|$|R
5|$|Thomas Lawton (6 October 1919– 6 November 1996) was an English {{football}} player and manager. A strong centre-forward with excellent all-round attacking skills, {{he was able}} to head with <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> <b>with</b> tremendous power and accuracy. Despite losing much of his best years to World War II, he scored 260 goals in 433 league and cup competitions in 14 full seasons in the Football League.|$|E
5|$|A {{creative}} {{player on}} <b>the</b> <b>ball,</b> <b>with</b> excellent vision, technical skills, and {{an eye for}} goal, he is a free kick specialist and is capable of playing in several offensive positions. Due to his short stature, dynamic abilities and pace, Giovinco acquired the nickname formica atomica ("atomic ant", after the eponymous Hanna-Barbera character) in his youth. In 2015, he was {{named one of the}} 100 best footballers in the world by The Guardian, FourFourTwo, and L'Équipe.|$|E
5|$|After {{considerable}} {{debate and}} various experiments, {{the law was}} changed again in 1972. In an attempt to reduce pad-play the new version, {{which is used to}} this day, allowed batsmen to be out lbw in some circumstances if they did not attempt to hit <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> <b>with</b> their bat. Since the 1990s, the availability of television replays and, later, ball-tracking technology to assist umpires has increased the percentage of lbws in major matches. However, the accuracy of the technology and the consequences of its use remain controversial.|$|E

5|$|Dung beetles form spherical {{balls of}} animal excrement, which they roll with their bodies, {{generally}} by walking backwards and pushing <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> <b>with</b> their rear legs. Phylogenetic analysis indicates that this rolling behavior evolved independently several times.

Although {{it is the}} dung ball that rolls rather than the beetle itself, the beetles face {{many of the same}} mechanical difficulties that rolling organisms contend with.|$|E
5|$|Each team {{consists}} of a maximum of eleven players (excluding substitutes), one of whom must be the goalkeeper. Competition rules may state a minimum number of players required to constitute a team, which is usually seven.

5|$|Handled {{the ball}} is Law 33 in the laws of cricket {{established}} by the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC). A batsman can be given out for handling the ball if, while playing a delivery, the batsman intentionally touches <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> <b>with</b> {{one or both of}} their hands not holding the bat. A decision of not out must be reached if the batsman handles the ball to avoid incurring an injury. A bowler does not receive credit for the wicket when a batsman is dismissed in this fashion.|$|E
5|$|In {{the second}} half, Tech's fortune turned. Late {{in the third}} quarter, the Virginia Tech defense stopped Miami's offense again, but instead of {{receiving}} the punt cleanly, the Hokies committed a roughing the kicker penalty that allowed Miami to retain possession of <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> <b>with</b> a first down. A few plays later, Miami scored its first touchdown of the game. In the fourth quarter Miami finally took the lead on a 10-play, 70-yard drive. The Hokies were unable to answer the Hurricanes' score, and Miami won the 1966 Liberty Bowl, 147.|$|E

Four minutes later Belletti passed through the inside-right channel to Larsson. After controlling the ball, Larsson made a left footed return pass to Belletti. Belletti ran onto control <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> <b>with</b> his left foot. He then used his right to shoot through Almunia's legs to score at the near post. This was Larsson's second assist for Barcelona since he joined the game.|$|E
5|$|Tech {{continued}} {{to run down}} the clock by running the ball straight ahead for a four-yard gain. Tech backup quarterback Nick Sorensen then entered the game, and running back Andre Kendrick gained a first down with a run to the 33-yard line. Kendrick then gained a first down at the Alabama 39-yard line. Kendrick {{continued to}} advance <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> <b>with</b> short runs, draining the clock to secure the Tech lead.

Miami received <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> <b>with</b> 1:24 remaining and ran a series of inconsequential plays to draw down the clock and bring the game to an end. Miami earned the win, 2010.|$|E

The Hokies advanced {{as far as the}} Florida State 44-yard line, but Florida State sacked Taylor twice, denying the Hokies another first down. Tech ran down the clock, then punted with 42 seconds remaining in the first half. Rather than attempt to score in the final seconds, Florida State kneeled on the ball and let the first half end with Tech leading, 21–17.|$|E
5|$|Tennessee had {{one final}} {{opportunity}} to score after receiving Virginia Tech's kickoff with 2:38 remaining. Jonathan Crompton threw several passes downfield, completing throws of 9, 9, 8, and 26 yards, advancing the Volunteers {{toward the end}} zone. Inside the Virginia Tech red zone, however, the Volunteers found less success. They committed a false start penalty, advanced <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> <b>with</b> a five-yard run, then Crompton threw two incomplete passes. On fourth down, Crompton was sacked for a 14-yard loss, the Volunteers' final play of the game. Virginia Tech knelt on the ball to run the final seconds off the clock and clinch the 37-14 victory.|$|E
5|$|The Seminoles {{returned}} Tech's post-score kick {{to their}} 15-yard line, where Florida State's offense began work again, hoping {{to regain the}} lead for State. Weinke completed a seven-yard pass to Warrick, then was sacked by the Virginia Tech defense. Weinke overcame the loss on the next play with a 19-yard first-down pass. State continued to advance <b>the</b> <b>ball</b> <b>with</b> short passes, as Weinke completed a five-yard throw. Chaney gained three yards on a rush to the right as the final seconds {{of the third quarter}} ticked off the clock, setting up an important third-down play.
