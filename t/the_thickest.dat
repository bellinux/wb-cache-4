5|$|Cannon {{in general}} have {{the form of}} a {{truncated}} cone with an internal cylindrical bore for holding an explosive charge and a projectile. <b>The</b> <b>thickest,</b> strongest, and closed part of the cone is located near the explosive charge. As any explosive charge will dissipate in all directions equally, <b>the</b> <b>thickest</b> portion of the cannon is useful for containing and directing this force. The backward motion of the cannon as its projectile leaves the bore is termed its recoil and the effectiveness of the cannon can be measured in terms of how much this response can be diminished, though obviously diminishing recoil through increasing the overall mass of the cannon means decreased mobility.|$|E

40|$|Aims. More than 30 {{years after}} its discovery, <b>the</b> <b>thick</b> disc of <b>the</b> Milky Way is not fully explored. We examine the shape of <b>the</b> <b>thick</b> disc {{in order to gain}} insight into the process of its formation. Methods. The shape of <b>the</b> <b>thick</b> disc is studied in detail using {{photometric}} data at high and intermediate latitudes from SDSS and 2 MASS surveys. We adopted the population synthesis approach using an ABC-MCMC method to determine the potential degeneracies in the parameters, that can be caused by the mixing with the halo and with the thin disc. We characterised <b>the</b> <b>thick</b> disc shape, scale height, scale length, local density, and flare, and we investigated the extent of <b>the</b> <b>thick</b> disc formation period by simulating several formation episodes. Results. We find that the vertical variation in density is not exponential, but much closer to a hyperbolic secant squared. Assuming a single formation epoch, <b>the</b> <b>thick</b> disc is better fitted with a sech 2 scale height of 470 pc and a scale length of 2. 3 kpc. However, if one simulates two successive formation episodes, which mimicks an extended formation period, the older episode has a higher scale height and a longer scale length than the younger episode, which indicates a contraction during the collapse phase. The scale height ranges from 800 pc to 340 pc, the scale length from 3. 2 kpc to 2 kpc. The likelihood is much higher when <b>the</b> <b>thick</b> disc formation extends over a longer period. We also show that star formation increases from the old episode to the young and that there is no flare in the outskirt of <b>the</b> <b>thick</b> disc during <b>the</b> main episode.

Tornadoes occurring in these conditions are especially dangerous, since only weather radar observations, or possibly {{the sound of an}} approaching tornado, serve as any warning to those in the storm's path. Most significant tornadoes form under the storm's updraft base, which is rain-free, making them visible. Also, most tornadoes occur in the late afternoon, when the bright sun can penetrate even <b>the</b> <b>thickest</b> clouds. Night-time tornadoes are often illuminated by frequent lightning.|$|E
5|$|Scientists once {{believed}} that the distinct status of some subspecies could be justified by morphology, including {{the size of the}} mane. Morphology was used to identify subspecies such as the Barbary lion and Cape lion, which had <b>the</b> <b>thickest,</b> most extensive manes amongst wild lions. Research results indicate that environmental factors such as average ambient temperature influence the colour and size of a lion's mane. The cooler ambient temperature in European and North American zoos, for example, may result in a heavier mane. Thus the mane is not an appropriate marker for identifying subspecies. The males of the Asiatic subspecies, however, are characterised by sparser manes than average African lions.|$|E

40|$|The {{origin and}} {{evolution}} of <b>the</b> thin and <b>thick</b> disks in <b>the</b> Galaxy have been studied by means of detailed stellar abundances. High-resolution spectra of 102 F and G dwarf stars have been obtained with the spectrographs on the ESO 3. 6 -m and ESO 1. 5 -m telescopes on La Silla (Chile), the Very Large Telescope (VLT) on Paranal (Chile), and the Nordic Optical Telescope (NOT) on La Palma (Canary Islands, Spain). Abundances for 14 elements (O, Na, Mg, Al, Si, Ca, Ti, Cr, Fe, Ni, Zn, Y, Ba, and Eu) have been determined. The following results were found: 1) Both the thin and <b>the</b> <b>thick</b> disks show distinct and well-defined abundance trends at sub-solar metallicities; 2) <b>The</b> <b>thick</b> disk shows signatures of chemical enrichment from Type Ia Supernovae; 3) [O/Fe] in the thin disk continues to decrease linearly at super-solar metallicities; 4) The abundance trends we see in <b>the</b> <b>thick</b> disk are invariant with distance from the Galactic plane ($Z_{ m max}$) and galactocentric radius ($R_{ m m}$); 4) <b>The</b> <b>thick</b> disk sample is in the mean older than the thin disk sample. The thesis also includes an investigation of ages and metallicities in <b>the</b> <b>thick</b> disk. <b>The</b> {{results from this study}} are; 5) There is a possible age-metallicity relation present in <b>the</b> <b>thick</b> disk, 6) Star formation has been ongoing for several billion years in <b>the</b> <b>thick</b> disk. Based on these findings, together with other constraints from the literature, we discuss different formation scenarios for <b>the</b> <b>thick</b> disk.

40|$|Models of the {{formation}} of <b>the</b> <b>thick</b> disk of <b>the</b> Milky Way Galaxy make specific predictions about the chemical abundance properties of the metal-weak (and oldest) stellar population in <b>the</b> <b>thick</b> disk. We have undertaken the study of the elemental abundances and kinematic properties of a sample of 319 candidate metal-poor thick-disk stars selected from the RAVE spectroscopic survey of bright stars. Our aim is to differentiate among the present scenarios of {{the formation}} of <b>the</b> <b>thick</b> disk. In this study, we measured the abundances of several alpha-elements and found that the thick-disk [alpha/Fe] ratios are enhanced, implying that enrichment proceeded by purely core-collapse supernovae. Further, the sample probes distances ranging out to about 2 kpc from the Sun, allowing for the investigation of the gradients in <b>the</b> <b>thick</b> disk. I will discuss the results from these investigations and how they compare to the predictions made by present models {{of the formation}} of <b>the</b> <b>thick</b> disk...|$|R

The eccentricity of hair cross-sectional shape index is also calculated using <b>the</b> <b>thickest</b> and thinnest axial diameters of human hair, and this index also differs by race. The hair eccentricity indexes of Africans, Europeans and Mongoloids are: 1.74, 1.49 and 1.30, respectively.

40|$|We have {{developed}} a novel Markov Chain Mote Carlo (MCMC) chemical "painting" technique to explore possible radial and vertical metallicity gradients for <b>the</b> <b>thick</b> disc progenitor. In our analysis we match an N-body simulation to {{the data from the}} Apache Point Observatory Galactic Evolution Experiment (APOGEE) survey. We assume that <b>the</b> <b>thick</b> disc has a constant scale-height and has completed its formation at an early epoch, after which time radial mixing of its stars has taken place. Under these assumptions, we find that the initial radial metallicity gradient of <b>the</b> <b>thick</b> disc progenitor should not be negative, but either flat or even positive, to explain the current negative vertical metallicity gradient of <b>the</b> <b>thick</b> disc. Our study suggests that <b>the</b> <b>thick</b> disc was built-up in an inside-out and upside-down fashion, and older, smaller and thicker populations are more metal poor. In this case, star forming discs at different epochs of <b>the</b> <b>thick</b> disc formation are allowed to have different radial metallicity gradients, including a negative one, which helps to explain a variety of slopes observed in high redshift disc galaxies. This scenario helps to explain the positive slope of the metallicity-rotation velocity relation observed for <b>the</b> Galactic <b>thick</b> disc. On <b>the</b> other hand, radial mixing flattens the slope of an existing gradient. Comment: 12 pages, 9 figures, 3 tables, accepted for publication in MNRA...|$|R
