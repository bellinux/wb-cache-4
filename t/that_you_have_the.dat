[...] Scully said he was [...] "the main reason" [...] why The Simpsons [...] still so good after all these years." [...] Vitti has said Meyer's [...] "fingerprints are on nearly every script" [...] and he [...] "exerts as much influence on the show as anyone can without {{being one of the}} creators," [...] while recounting how [...] "a show <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> writer's credit for will run, and the next day people will come up to you and tell you how great it was. Then they'll mention their two favorite lines, and both of them will be George's." [...] Bill Oakley noted Meyer has [...] "he's been there since the beginning adding thousands of jokes and plot twists, etc., that everyone considers classic and brilliant.|$|E
500|$|It {{has been}} noted {{generally}} that natural justice is a fundamental element {{of the rule of}} law. In administrative law, the two principles of natural justice, which constitute a framework for common law procedural rights, are the rule against bias (nemo iudex in causa sua, or [...] "no man a judge in his own cause") and the right to be heard (audi alteram partem, or [...] "hear the other side"). In the Australian case Gas and Fuel Corporation of Victoria v. Wood Hall Ltd. & Leonard Pipeline Contractors Ltd. (1978), the Supreme Court of Victoria said that the ideas underlying both principles are that of [...] "fairness and judgement only after a full and fair hearing given to all parties." [...] Speaking in Parliament on 24 November 1999, MP Toh See Kiat expressed the view that the Singapore legal system does apply the rules of natural justice, which he described thus: [...] "atural justice requires essentially two basic principles. One is <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> right to be heard and to explain your case, and, two, is the right to equal treatment. A right to have your case heard also means that there is a review." ...|$|E
500|$|An {{ensemble}} of 20 actors {{make up the}} bulk of the series' cast. Hawley found ensembles enticing because they presented [...] "a lot of really good moving pieces". At Paleyfest 2015, the Fargo creator commented: [...] "It's sort of like a horse race in a way, especially when you know that everyone is on this collision course. It's like, 'Who's going to make it?' And you can put people together in unexpected pairings." [...] Offerman played Karl Weathers, an alcoholic and the only lawyer in Luverne, and Cristin Milioti was assigned the part of Betsy Solverson, Lou's terminally ill wife. Hawley felt that Milioti was the right choice because her personality was similar to her character's. Garrett portrays Joe Bulo, and Bokeem Woodbine appears as Mike Milligan, a role he was offered two days after auditioning. For the role of Hanzee Dent, Hawley hired Zahn McClarnon two weeks after his audition. Six others play members of the Gerhardts: Kieran Culkin as Rye, Rachel Keller as Simone, Michael Hogan as Otto, Allan Dobescu as Charlie, Angus Sampson as Bear, and Jeffrey Donovan as Dodd. When asked about his decision to cast Donovan, Hawley told the actor, [...] "I don't know. You just come off with a sense of power. I think Dodd comes off with a sense of power, and I thought <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> chops to find the humor in it." [...] Donovan gained 30 pounds in preparation for his role. Other major supporting roles in Fargo second season include: Bruce Campbell as Ronald Reagan, Keir O'Donnell as Ben Schmidt, and Elizabeth Marvel as Constance Heck.|$|E

500|$|After {{the release}} of the video, critics commented on the {{resemblance}} between Rihanna's ex-boyfriend Chris Brown and her fictional love interest in the video, Dudley O'Shaughnessy, and how the video's content appeared to be somewhat of a reenactment of the assault upon Rihanna by Brown on the evening of the 2009 Grammy Awards. Chris Doplan of Consequence of Sound said that O'Shaughnessy strongly resembled Brown in his appearance. Amanda Dobbins of New York magazine concurred with Doplan, and wrote that O'Shaughnessy has short blond hair like Brown once had. Erika Ramirez of Billboard magazine also thought that O'Shaughnessy's character is a depiction of Brown, especially in relation to the scene which features the couple in a car, with O'Shaughnessy driving recklessly and Rihanna begging him to stop. William Goodman of Spin provided an analysis of the video with regard to the Brown comparisons. Like many reviewers, he noted the resemblance between Brown and O'Shaughnessy, writing [...] "The clip stars a dead ringer for Brown, complete with dyed hair and bulging biceps". Goodman commented upon the video's opening narration, which was actually voiced by Agyness Deyn, [...] "The video opens with a Rihanna voice-over that warns, 'You almost feel ashamed that someone could be that important. No one will ever understand how much it hurts... you almost wish that you could have all that bad stuff back, so <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> good." [...] In conclusion, Goodman commented that [...] the scene showing an altercation in a car is reminiscent of Brown's assault on Rihanna, which occurred inside a car. Goodman wrote: [...] "during a heated argument between the couple in a muscle car, the Brown look-alike gives the Barbadian beauty a slap on the face. Convinced yet?" ...|$|E

He commented: [...] "There are some song ideas and {{little things like}} that -- nothing really official, but the seeds just start to get planted. One {{of the great things}} about this career is <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> {{opportunity}} every time to go in and start again with a blank slate and think, 'What can we do differently?

2500|$|Traditional {{adventure}} games became {{difficult to}} propose as new commercial titles. Gilbert wrote in 2005, [...] "From first-hand experience, I {{can tell you}} that if you even utter the words 'adventure game' in a meeting with a publisher you can just pack up your spiffy concept art and leave. You'd get a better reaction by announcing <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> plague." [...] In 2012 Schaefer said [...] "If I were to go to a publisher right now and pitch an adventure game, they'd laugh in my face." [...] Though most commercial adventure game publication had stopped in the United States by the early 2000s, the genre was still popular in Europe. Games such as The Longest Journey by Funcom as well as Amerzone and Syberia, both conceived by Benoît Sokal and developed by Microïds, with rich classical elements of the genre still garnered high critical acclaims.|$|E

2500|$|After filming {{ended on}} the series Mercy Peak, Bartolomei {{decided he would}} stay in New Zealand rather than {{returning}} to Australia and was offered {{the role of a}} new character – Craig Valentine on Shortland Street, who was set to undergo a steamy romance with the upcoming character Sarah Potts. Bartolomei decided to leave the soap in 2008, saying, [...] "It was a very difficult decision, from an actor's point of view it's not very often <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> security that a job like Shortland Street provides. But after {{four and a half years}} I longed for a degree of anonymity again. I'm a very private person, and given what I do for a job, the spectre of Shortland Street will invariably take that away from you." [...] The character was killed off in a dramatic gang storyline, something which producers at first thought would be [...] "unforgivable" [...] but which, due to Bartolomei's iinsistence on leaving, they went through with. Bartolomei said of the storyline, [...] "It's all a bit of fun and it's nice to see the characters away from the normal hospital setting and involved in something a little bit different," [...] and of the conclusion to Sarah and Craig's romance, [...] "That does get revisited but not in a stereotypical way. There is a great deal of resolution at the end for everyone concerned." ...|$|E

She says, [...] "Death is not deviant, it's actually the most normal and universal act there is." [...] She is working to overcome the belief that dead bodies are dangerous and can only be handled by trained professionals using technical equipment and specialized facilities. She says {{the most important thing}} she wants the public to know is that the corpse is the family's legal quasi-property, and <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> power over what happens to that body. Don't let anyone, funeral home, hospital, coroner, etc., pressure you into making a quick decision you might regret. Take the time to do your research and understand your options. The dead person will still be dead in 24 hours; you have time to make the right decision for you. While a body is not commercial property, which can be transferred or held for a debt, for purposes of burial the body is treated as the next of kin's property. Her highest priority changes that she would like to see in US law would be the repeal of the laws in eight states that require a funeral home for at least some part of the process, and to make alkaline hydrolysis available in more than the current eight states.|$|E
2500|$|On August 13, 2014, Seth M. Sherwood was {{announced}} {{to write the}} film, under the title Leatherface. On October 31, 2014, Julien Maury and Alexandre Bustillo were hired to direct the film, who admired its distinction in narrative from the series' previous installments: [...] "When we first received the script, of course it's not everyday <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> opportunity to see Leatherface {{on the front page}} and we were very surprised, in a good way, that the script was taking a different path, and it's quite original." [...] Producer Whedon elucidated that the directors were chosen because their [...] "perfect vision" [...] and their [...] "edge to their storytelling". Upon signing on to the project, Maury and Bustillo requested rewrites, in which Sherwood gave his support. The general plot structure remained the same, though the directors wanted the screenplay to match their vision. Nearly every death sequence was altered and the ending, originally a mass murder involving Leatherface killing at least thirty people with his chainsaw, was changed, [...] "It was really over the top and even if we like blood and gore, we were like, no, that’s not the character, we cannot do that." [...] In March and April 2015, Sam Strike, James Bloor, Stephen Dorff, and Jessica Madsen joined the cast, respectively. On May 5, 2015, Lili Taylor was publicised to replace Angela Bettis, who dropped out due to a scheduling conflict. The following day, Vanessa Grasse joined the cast to play Lizzy.|$|E
