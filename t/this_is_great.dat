500|$|In a joint album review with Peter Jones for Record Mirror, Richard Green enthused about [...] "Love You To", saying: [...] "Starts like a {{classical}} Indian recital... <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>great.</b> So different. Play it again! Best [...] so far." [...] Allen Evans of the NME said the song had a [...] "Kama Sutra-type lyric" [...] and lauded Harrison's sitar playing as [...] "stunning" [...] and [...] "tremendous" [...] before concluding: [...] "Fascinating mixture of minor melody with Indian accompaniment. One {{of the most}} striking tracks." [...] In his role as guest reviewer for Disc and Music Echo, Ray Davies of the Kinks also admired the performance and suggested that Harrison [...] "must have quite a big influence on the group now".|$|E
2500|$|In September 2013 Salmon {{recalled}} [...] "a {{whole lot}} of what I do is tied up in my past. The Scientists, The Beasts of Bourbon, The Surrealists. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>great,</b> but I still like to make new stuff. I've kept my sanity {{over the years by}} doing new stuff and waiting for it to become old enough to be revived". He described how The Surrealists reformed in 2006, for a one-off concert at Azkena Festival, Spain. The Scientists also reunited in 2006 and recorded their performance at Shepherd's Bush, which was issued as a live album, Sedition in the following year.|$|E
2500|$|While {{the three}} gods {{are at the}} falls, Ótr (in {{the form of an}} otter) catches a salmon and eats it on a river bank, his eyes shut, when Loki hits and kills him with a stone. The gods think that <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>great,</b> and flay the skin from the otter to make a bag. That night, the three gods stay with Hreidmar (the father of Regin, Andvari, and the now-dead Ótr) and show him their catches, {{including}} the skin of the otter. Upon seeing the skin, Regin and Hreidmar [...] "seized them and made them ransom their lives" [...] in exchange for filling the otterskin bag the gods had made with gold and covering the exterior of the bag with red gold.|$|E

2500|$|Darwin {{had already}} made his views clearer to others, telling Lyell that if each step in {{evolution}} was providentially planned, the whole procedure would be a miracle and natural selection superfluous. He had also sent a copy to John Herschel, and on 10 December he told Lyell of having [...] "heard by round about channel that Herschel says my Book [...] "is the law of higgledy-piggledy".– What this exactly means I do not know, but it is evidently very contemptuous.– If true <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>great</b> blow & discouragement." [...] Darwin subsequently corresponded with Herschel, and in January 1861 Herschel added a footnote to the draft of his Physical Geography [...] which, while disparaging [...] "the principle of arbitrary and casual variation and natural selection" [...] as insufficient without [...] "intelligent direction", said that [...] "with some demur as to the genesis of man, we are far from disposed to repudiate the view taken of this mysterious subject in Mr. Darwin's book." ...|$|E
2500|$|Save Rock and Roll was {{recorded}} primarily at Rubyred Recordings in Santa Monica, California from October 2012 to March 2013. The band's main {{goal was to}} reinvent {{the sound of the}} group from scratch, creating what Trohman called a [...] "reimagining of the band", which focuses more on pop. Sessions were not without their difficulties, as the band struggled initially to produce new material. Walker had doubts about the band's volatility, feeling the record would not be made following [...] "meltdown after meltdown". When the band members learned that Elton John was a fan of their music, they jokingly suggested that he might want to record with them. John complied, and Stump flew to Atlanta late in production, halting the mixing process, to record with him. He was very positive regarding the album's direction: [...] "He actually spoke up for the album's title. He came in and was like, 'Love the album title. Love where this is going. <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>great,</b> said Stump.|$|E
2500|$|In {{perhaps the}} {{greatest}} 10,000 metres race of all time, Dibaba ran the fourth fastest time in history while winning the bronze medal. Her finish time of 29:42.56 was 12.1 seconds faster than her previous personal best of 29:54.66, which she set at the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing. Teammate Almaz Ayana smashed Wang Junxia's 22 year old (and controversial) world record (29:31.78) by 14.33 seconds {{on her way to}} the gold medal in a time of 29:17.45. Silver medalist Vivian Cheruiyot of Kenya came within 0.75 seconds of Wang's world record while running the third fastest time (29:32.53) in history. Fourth place finisher Alice Aprot Nawowuna of Kenya ran the fifth fastest time (29:53.51) in history. (She led the race for the first 5000 metres, reaching that mark in a very quick 14:46.81.) The next 9 finishers each set an area record (Molly Huddle of the U.S.), a national record (Cheruiyot of Kenya, Sarah Lahti of Sweden, Diane Nukuri of Burundi), or a personal best. National records for Greece, Kyrgyzstan, and Uzbekistan also were broken. Before this race, a woman had finished a 10,000 metres race in under 30 minutes only five times - but four did so in this race. Dibaba said after the race, [...] "I had a short time after delivery. Fortunately I got bronze.... <b>This</b> <b>is</b> <b>great</b> for me, my family and all of Ethiopia. The bronze is for my son." ...|$|E
