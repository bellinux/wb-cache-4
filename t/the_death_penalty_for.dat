5|$|Although the Act of Parliament {{defining}} {{high treason}} {{remains on the}} United Kingdom's statute books, during {{a long period of}} 19th-century legal reform the sentence of hanging, drawing, and quartering was changed to drawing, hanging until dead, and posthumous beheading and quartering, before being abolished in England in 1870. <b>The</b> <b>death</b> <b>penalty</b> <b>for</b> treason was abolished in 1998.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of the trial, FRAP members VIadimiro Fernández, Manuel Blanco and José Humberto Baena {{received}} <b>the</b> <b>death</b> <b>penalty</b> <b>for</b> the killing of Lucio Rodríguez, an armed policeman, in Madrid on 14 July 1975. Humberto had been an activist in the then-illegal Communist Party of Spain and had been arrested and jailed following a student demonstration in 1970. His parents claimed that he had been in Portugal {{at the time of the}} killing and that one of the main witnesses was not allowed to attend the trial. Though the prosecution had sought <b>the</b> <b>death</b> <b>penalty</b> <b>for</b> all five accused, Pablo Mayoral Ronda and Fernando Siera Marco received sentences of 30 and 25 years respectively. Lawyers of the three sentenced to death appealed the sentences.|$|E

5|$|Breckinridge {{pressed to}} reform the state's {{criminal}} code, {{which was based on}} the English system and imposed <b>the</b> <b>death</b> <b>penalty</b> <b>for</b> over 200 different crimes. Inspired by Thomas Jefferson's failed attempt to reform Virginia's code, he first asked the Lexington Democratic Society to study ways to make punishments more proportional to crimes in November 1793. By 1796, he was drafting a new code based on the principles that criminals should be rehabilitated, victims should be compensated for their injury, the public should be reimbursed for the cost of prosecuting the criminal, and the punishment's severity should serve as a deterrent for would-be offenders. In January 1798, he introduced his proposed code in the General Assembly. A month later, the Assembly reformed the code, abolishing <b>the</b> <b>death</b> <b>penalty</b> <b>for</b> every crime except first-degree murder.|$|E

5|$|With these defections, Massino was slapped with a {{superseding}} indictment charging {{him with}} seven additional murders: the three capos (this time {{for participation in}} the murder itself rather than conspiracy), Mirra, Bonventre, Infanti and Sciascia.

5|$|Ronnie Lee Gardner (January 16, 1961 – June 18, 2010) was an American {{criminal}} {{who received}} <b>the</b> <b>death</b> <b>penalty</b> <b>for</b> murder in 1985, and was executed by a firing squad {{by the state}} of Utah in 2010.

5|$|The Christians were {{alleged to}} have helped General Mathews with a sum of Rs. 3,30,000/-. Hyder summoned a Portuguese officer and several Christian priests from Mangalore to suggest the {{punishment}} for the Mangalorean Catholics for treachery. The Portuguese officer suggested <b>the</b> <b>death</b> <b>penalty</b> <b>for</b> those Catholics who helped the British, {{because it was a}} fitting punishment for people who betrayed the sovereign. But Hyder exhibited a diplomatic stance and imprisoned the Christians, rather than killing them.|$|E

5|$|Besides the budget, another {{measure that}} failed to pass in the 2002 session was a bill to {{eliminate}} <b>the</b> <b>death</b> <b>penalty</b> <b>for</b> juveniles. The precedent for the juvenile death penalty had been set in the 1989 Supreme Court case of Stanford v. Kentucky, wherein {{the court ruled that}} Kevin Stanford could be executed for the 1981 rape, sodomy, and murder of a gas station attendant in Jefferson County, Kentucky, even though Stanford was only 17 {{at the time of the}} crime. In 2003, Patton announced he would commute Stanford's sentence. Patton did oversee the execution of two adult prisoners in 1997 and 1999, making him the first Kentucky governor to do so since 1962.|$|E
5|$|Despite his severe manner Stevenson was {{extremely}} sociable, {{and he was}} often the centre of a lively crowd at the bar of the Garrick Club, {{of which he was}} a member. His home on the Sussex coast was called Truncheons, sometimes taken to reflect his authoritarian views, but the area had been known by that name for many years before his arrival. Following his retirement Stevenson called for the restoration of <b>the</b> <b>death</b> <b>penalty</b> <b>for</b> all murders, and made frequent guest appearances on television until his health and eyesight began to fail. Among the programmes he took part in was Granada Television's six-part series The Bounds of Freedom, broadcast in 1979.|$|E
5|$|In October 1984, Gardner killed Melvyn John Otterstrom {{during a}} robbery in Salt Lake City. While being moved in April 1985 {{to a court}} hearing for the homicide, he fatally shot {{attorney}} Michael Burdell in an unsuccessful escape attempt. Convicted of two counts of murder, Gardner {{was sentenced to life}} imprisonment for the first count and received <b>the</b> <b>death</b> <b>penalty</b> <b>for</b> the second. The state adopted more stringent security measures {{as a result of the}} incident at the courthouse. While held at Utah State Prison, Gardner was charged with another capital crime for stabbing an inmate in 1994. However, that charge was thrown out by the Utah Supreme Court because the victim survived.|$|E

The court had accepted his plea, but {{due to the lack of}} completeness within his admittance, the judge had deemed that many of the 86 charges were not addressed and therefore the trial continued.|$|E
5|$|Neumann {{delivered}} {{a letter from}} the queen to Grover Cleveland, who began his second non-consecutive term as president on March 4. The Cleveland administration commissioned the Blount Report, and based on its findings, concluded that the overthrow of Liliʻuokalani was illegal, and that Stevens and American military troops had acted inappropriately in support of those who carried out the overthrow. On November 16, Cleveland sent his minister Albert S. Willis to propose a return of the throne to Liliʻuokalani if she granted amnesty to everyone responsible. Her first response was that Hawaiian law called for property confiscation and <b>the</b> <b>death</b> <b>penalty</b> <b>for</b> treason, and that only her cabinet ministers could put aside the law in favor of amnesty.|$|E
5|$|On 31 March 1814, {{upon the}} arrival of the Sixth Coalition armies at Paris, Sérurier {{publicly}} destroyed the 1,417 captured enemy flags and personally burned the sword and sash of Frederick the Great as to not let them fall into the Allies' hands. The restored King Louis XVIII made Sérurier a Peer of France, but he joined Napoleon during the Hundred Days, when the former emperor briefly returned to power. This caused him to lose his post at Les Invalides and his marshal's salary after Napoleon's second downfall.

5|$|Poland, {{home of the}} world's largest Jewish {{community}} {{before the}} war, lost 3,300,000 (90percent) of its Jewish population. Although the Germans rigorously imposed <b>the</b> <b>death</b> <b>penalty</b> <b>for</b> hiding Jews, some Poles hid Jews (saving their lives) despite the risk to themselves and their families. Although reports of the Holocaust had reached Western leaders, public awareness in the United States and other democracies of the mass murder of Jews in Poland was low at the time; the first references in The New York Times, in 1942, were unconfirmed reports rather than front-page news.|$|E
5|$|A congratulatory {{telegram}} to Kruger from Kaiser Wilhelm II on 3 January {{prompted a}} storm of anti-Boer and anti-German feeling in Britain, with Jameson becoming lionised as a result. Kruger shouted down talk of <b>the</b> <b>death</b> <b>penalty</b> <b>for</b> the imprisoned Jameson or a campaign of retribution against Johannesburg, challenging his more bellicose commandants to depose him if they disagreed, and accepted Robinson's proposed mediation with alacrity. After confiscating the weapons and munitions the Reform Committee had stockpiled, Kruger handed Jameson and his troops over to British custody and granted amnesty to all the Johannesburg conspirators except for 64 leading members, who were charged with high treason. The four main leaders—Lionel Phillips, John Hays Hammond, George Farrar and Frank Rhodes (brother of Cecil)—pleaded guilty in April 1896 and were sentenced to hang, but Kruger quickly had this commuted to fines of £25,000 each.|$|E
5|$|After {{three weeks}} of jury selection, and eight trial days, the defense made their closing {{statements}} on March 7 in about three hours.

The judge told prosecutors {{that they had to}} choose to charge the defendants with capital murder or conspiracy to commit murder. The prosecution decided on the capital murder charge, and sought <b>the</b> <b>death</b> <b>penalty</b> <b>for</b> both Cisneros and Garza. The following day, the jury convicted Cisneros and Garza of capital murder for arranging Fischer's death. Neither of them showed any emotion when the verdict was given. Cisneros then removed her jewelry and was taken to the Cameron County jail with Garza. The jurors met the following day to discuss the punishment phase of the trial.|$|E
