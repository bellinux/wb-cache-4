25|$|The cities {{played a}} major role in fomenting the American Revolution, but they were hard hit during the war itself, 1775-83. They lost their main role as oceanic ports, because of the {{blockade}} by the British Navy. Furthermore, the British occupied the cities, especially New York 1776-83, and the others for briefer periods. During the occupations they were cut off from their hinterland trade and from overland communication. When the British finally departed in 1783, <b>they</b> <b>took</b> <b>out</b> large numbers of wealthy merchants who resumed their business activities elsewhere in the British Empire.|$|E

25|$|Although Pat Davies is {{counted as}} Sale's first international, having been picked {{to play for}} England in 1927, it was G.A.M. Isherwood who was Sale's first {{representative}} in an international Test match, when he played in all three tests of the 1910 British tour to South Africa at scrum-half. The club has consistently provided international players and, during the 1930s, had {{one of its most}} dominant periods, fielding players of the calibre of Hal Sever (England), Claude Davey and Wilf Wooller (Wales) and Ken Fyfe (Scotland).

25|$|Ghazi sent an {{envoy to}} Éxarchos {{saying that he}} wanted to negotiate. The men met in Tripoli, Ghazi's capitol, but once Éxarchos arrived, Ghazi had him seized and hanged. When Éxarchos' mother heard the news she was infuriated. On Easter Sunday when {{everyone}} in Skoutari was at church she started calling the men women for not avenging her son's death. So the men of Skoutari under the command of Zanet dressed up as priests went to the Ottoman castle of Passavas, and asked the commander if they could come in and bless the castle. The commander agreed, and once all the men were inside, <b>they</b> <b>took</b> <b>out</b> their hidden weapons and slaughtered everyone inside the walls. None of the Ottomans made it out alive. After the massacre, Passavas was abandoned and never inhabited again. The Ottomans then tried to destroy Zanet in 1803 and 1807. The Ottomans tried to subdue Mani again in 1815 by capturing Skoutari but the men of Skoutari beat back the attack and in 1821 the rest of Greece declared their independence from the Ottomans.|$|E

500|$|Mary met {{her future}} husband during an air raid on Liverpool in 1940, when Jim was 38 years old, and had settled into what his friends thought was, [...] "a {{confirmed}} bachelorhood." [...] Mary had been too career-conscious to think of marriage and, {{at the age of}} 31 years, was thought of as a spinster. They met in June 1940, at 11 Scargreen Avenue, West Derby, the McCartney family home. Mary was staying with Jim's sister, Jin, {{because of the lack of}} accommodation in Liverpool at the time. As Mary sat quietly in an armchair, the air-raid sirens sounded at 9:30. At that time, the group moved to the Anderson shelter in the back garden to wait for the all-clear, but as there was an intensive bombing raid, the signal did not come and everyone was thus forced to sit in the cellar until dawn. Mary talked long enough with Jim to become romantically interested in him, and thought that he was [...] "utterly charming and uncomplicated," [...] as well as being entertained by his [...] "considerable good humour." [...] <b>They</b> <b>took</b> <b>out</b> a marriage licence at Liverpool Town Hall on 8 April 1941, and were married a week later at St. Swithin's Roman Catholic chapel in Gillmoss, West Derby, on 15 April 1941. They first lived at 10 Sunbury Road, Anfield, and then resided for a short time at 92 Broadway, Wallasey, during November 1942. Jim's job at Napiers was classified as war work, so the McCartneys were given a small, but temporary, prefab house at 3 Roach Avenue, Knowsley.|$|E

2500|$|A persistent, though mostly apocryphal, story {{involving}} Fort Independence {{was allegedly}} the inspiration {{behind one of}} Edgar Allan Poe's most well known works. [...] A monument outside the west battery of the fort marks the grave of Lieutenant Robert F. Massie, {{who was killed in}} a duel there on December 25, 1817. [...] According to folklorist Edward Rowe Snow, Massie was so popular with the soldiers stationed at Fort Independence that <b>they</b> <b>took</b> <b>out</b> their frustration on his killer, Lieutenant Gustavus Drane, by walling him up within a vault in the fort. [...] Edgar Allan Poe, while serving with the 1st United States Artillery Regiment at Fort Independence purportedly heard the tale and was inspired, according to Snow, to write [...] "The Cask of Amontillado".|$|E

Under the collaboration Can't Stop Productions, Morali and his business partner Henri Belolo hastily built a group of dancers around Willis to perform in clubs and on Dick Clark's American Bandstand. The band's name refers to New York City's Greenwich Village, at the time known for its large gay population. Morali and Belolo created a group of stereotypes based on the fantasy attire often worn by gay men of Greenwich Village when socializing. As the Village People's popularity grew, Morali, Belolo, and Willis saw {{the need for a}} permanent [...] "group". <b>They</b> <b>took</b> <b>out</b> an ad in a music trade magazine which read: [...] "Macho Types Wanted: Must Dance And Have A Moustache." ...|$|E

The Becker introduced the [...] advanced primer ignition blowback (API) design for autocannons, {{a concept that}} was quickly taken up by other companies. Notable among these was the Swiss Oerlikon FF S, which introduced a number of improvements. In the 1930s, Hispano-Suiza was asked to develop a 20mm cannon able to fire through the propeller shaft of a gear-reduction inline aviation engine like the Hispano-Suiza 8BeC. <b>They</b> <b>took</b> <b>out</b> a license on the Oerlikon FF S and made minor modifications to produce the Hispano-Suiza Automatic Cannon Type HS.7 and HS.9. Shortly after production began, the Hispano-Suiza and Oerlikon companies disagreed over patent rights and their business connection came to an end.|$|E
