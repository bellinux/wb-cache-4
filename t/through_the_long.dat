5|$|In the 1950s, {{construction}} {{began on}} the St. Lawrence Seaway, a system of canals and locks {{that would make the}} St. Lawrence River suitable for shipping. As part of the seaway's construction, a low-lying area in Ontario and New York between Waddington, New York, and Cornwall, Ontario, would be inundated with water {{in order to create a}} navigable channel <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>Long</b> Sault rapids and to allow hydroelectric stations to be established immediately upriver from Massena and Cornwall. Much of NY37B was located within the flood-prone region due to its proximity to the river. On July1, 1958, the intentional flooding was carried out via the destruction of a cofferdam upstream, creating what is now known as Lake St. Lawrence and inundating the majority of NY37B west of Massena.|$|E
2500|$|Masquerades puzzle is elaborate. The {{answer is}} hidden in the fifteen painted illustrations. In each painting, a line must be drawn from each {{depicted}} creature's left eye <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>longest</b> digit on its left hand, and out {{to one of the}} letters in the page border. Then from <b>the</b> left eye <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>longest</b> digit on <b>the</b> left foot; <b>the</b> right eye <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>longest</b> digit on <b>the</b> right hand; and finally <b>the</b> right eye <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>longest</b> digit on <b>the</b> right foot. This is only done for eyes and digits that are visible in the painting. The letters indicated by these lines can be made to form words, either by treating them as anagrams or by applying the sequence of animals and digits suggested by the Isaac Newton painting (pictured).

25|$|One of {{the major}} {{advantages}} of concrete pavements is they are typically stronger and more durable than asphalt roadways. They also can be grooved to provide a durable skid-resistant surface. A notable disadvantage is that they typically can have a higher initial cost, and can be more time-consuming to construct. This cost can typically be offset <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>long</b> life cycle of the pavement. Concrete pavement can be maintained over time utilizing a series of methods known as concrete pavement restoration which include diamond grinding, dowel bar retrofits, joint and crack sealing, cross-stitching, etc. Diamond grinding is also useful in reducing noise and restoring skid resistance in older concrete pavement.|$|E

Unexpectedly, Bonaparte defeated Austrian forces at the Battle of Rovereto in the Tyrol. Then the main French army moved east and south down the Brenta valley to defeat Wurmser at the Battle of Bassano on 8 September. Instead of retreating to the east, Wurmser moved southwest to unite with Mészáros and marched hard for Mantua. The Austrians evaded Bonaparte's pursuit and reached the fortress, though the French forced them to fight a costly battle at La Favorita Palace on 15 September.

With the various County Police Acts, policing became a more standardised practice in the United Kingdom throughout the late nineteenth century, the uniforms and equipment became equally standardised. From a variety of home grown uniforms, bicycles, swords and pistols the British police force evolved in look and equipment <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>long</b> coats and top hat, to the recognisable modern uniform of a white shirt, black tie (or cravat for women in many forces), reflective jackets, body armour, and the panda car.|$|E
25|$|Relevant {{evidence}} suggests that Eleanor was not fluent in English, but was accustomed to read, and so presumably to think and speak, in French, her mother's tongue, with which {{she would have been}} familiar from childhood despite spending her early years in Spain. In this she was luckier than many medieval European queens, who often arrived in their husband's realms to face the need to learn a new language; but the English court was still functionally bilingual, in large measure <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>long</b> succession of its queens, who were mostly from French-speaking lands. In 1275, on a visit to St Albans abbey in Hertfordshire, the people of the town begged her help in withstanding the abbot's exactions from them, but one of her courtiers had to act as translator before she could respond to the plea for assistance. All the literary works noted above are in French, as are the bulk of her surviving letters, and since Peckham wrote his letters and his angelic treatise for her in French, she was presumably well known to prefer that language.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—The {{shrinking}} feature {{sizes of}} the manufacturing process lead to high requirements on the post-production test. The high distribution of Small Delay Defects (SDDs) becomes a serious issue for the correct functionality of the manufactured de-sign. Timing-aware ATPG targets the detection of faults <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>longest</b> paths in order to detect defects caused by distributed SDDs. However, this results in high CPU run times due to the large search space. This paper serves as the theoretical basis {{for the application of}} algorithms for Pseudo-Boolean Optimization (PBO) in order to leverage the recent advances in efficient search space pruning techniques in this field. We show how the problem of detecting a transition fault <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>longest</b> path can be formulated as a PBO problem. The proposed PBO formulation encodes the timing of the path into the minimization function using structural information. Additionally, the method is able to take transition-dependent delays into account to model a more realistic behavior. I...|$|R

[...] Kinberg reasoned, [...] "there just wasn't enough space", and considered Gambit would only work with as much screentime as Beast. Alan Cumming had been uncomfortable with the long hours he had to take with the prosthetic makeup as Nightcrawler in X2, but still planned to return for the sequel. The part of Nightcrawler was so minimal, however, that the studio felt it was not worthwhile to go <b>through</b> <b>the</b> <b>long</b> and costly makeup process, and the character was cut. Kinberg felt that [...] "there wasn't much left to do with the character.

[...] Nightcrawler's absence was later explained in [...] The introdutory scenes tried to emulate the Auschwitz opener for the first film, going with different scenes that resonated later in the plot instead of an action scene like in most blockbusters. Afterwards came a scene in the Danger Room, which was considered for the previous X-Men films but never included for budget and writing concerns. The writers tried to make the simulation not feel extraneous by showcasing some of the character conflicts and abilities in a [...] "Days of Future Past"-inspired battle with a Sentinel.
