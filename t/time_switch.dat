25|$|Traditional {{telephone}} switches connected physical circuits (e.g., wire pairs) while modern telephone switches use {{a combination}} of space- and time-division switching. In other words, each voice channel is represented by a time slot (say 1 or 2) on a physical wire pair (A or B). In order to connect two voice channels (say A1 and B2) together, the telephone switch interchanges the information between A1 and B2. It switches both the time slot and physical connection. To do this, it exchanges data between the time slots and connections 8,000 times per second, under control of digital logic that cycles through electronic lists of the current connections. Using both types of switching makes a modern switch far smaller than either a space or <b>time</b> <b>switch</b> could be by itself.|$|E

30|$|In this paper, we {{consider}} a denoise-and-forward (DNF) two-way relay network (TWRN) with non-coherent differential binary phase-shift keying modulation, where a battery-free relay node harvests {{energy from the}} received radio frequency (RF) signals and uses the harvested energy to help the source nodes for information exchange. Based on the power splitting (PS) and <b>time</b> <b>switching</b> (TS) receiver architectures, power splitting relaying (PSR) and <b>time</b> <b>switching</b> relaying (TSR) protocols at relay are studied. In order to investigate the effect of power allocations on two source nodes, power splitting coefficient and <b>time</b> <b>switching</b> factor at relay on performance, the two proposed protocols are analyzed and the bit error rate (BER) expressions of end-to-end system are derived. Based on these expressions, the optimal power of sources, the power splitting ratio and the <b>time</b> <b>switching</b> factor are obtained via the numerical search method. The simulation and numerical results provide practical insights into the effect of various system parameters, such as the power splitting coefficient, the <b>time</b> <b>switching</b> factor, sources to relay distances, the noise power, and the energy harvesting efficiency {{on the performance of}} this TWRN. In addition, the results show that the PSR protocol outperforms the TSR protocol in terms of throughput under various network geometries.|$|R

30|$|Wireless energy {{transfer}} through radio frequency (RF) signals {{has emerged as}} the promising and effective solution to supply power and prolong the lifetime of energy-constrained wireless networks. Since RF signals can carry both information and energy, it has recently attracted a lot of attention on research activities, especially on investigating simultaneously wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT) [1 – 3]. In [4], an energy constrained relay node using amplify-and-forward (AF) protocol was considered based on the <b>time</b> <b>switching</b> and power splitting receiver architectures, respectively. Specifically, the authors investigated both the delay-limited and the non-delay-limited transmission and derived the analytical expressions for the outage probability and ergodic capacity, respectively. Later on, the same authors extended the analysis to the throughput and ergodic capacity of DF relaying systems in [5]. Based on the <b>time</b> <b>switching</b> receiver architecture, the authors in [6] proposed adaptive <b>time</b> <b>switching</b> protocols for RF energy harvesting and information transmission for both AF and DF networks. They obtained analytical expressions of the achievable throughput for both the continuous and the discrete <b>time</b> <b>switching</b> protocols.
