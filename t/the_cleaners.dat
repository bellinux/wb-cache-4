5|$|Two {{years after}} {{the events of the}} first game, Max has been {{reinstated}} as a detective in the NYPD. Max is called on to investigate a gunfight at a warehouse owned by Max's old associate Vladimir Lem and discovers the place has been attacked by a group of hitmen called <b>the</b> <b>Cleaners.</b> He encounters Mona Sax, who was presumed dead {{at the end of the}} previous game. Max heads to a restaurant owned by Lem and rescues him from his old foe Vinnie Gognitti; Lem claims that Gognitti is trying to monopolize the black market gun trade and sees Lem as a threat. After evading an attack by <b>the</b> <b>Cleaners</b> in his Apartment, Max tracks Mona to an abandoned funhouse and learns that <b>the</b> <b>Cleaners</b> are after anyone who knows about the secretive Inner Circle. While attempting to track down a contact, Mona is arrested because of her crimes and is taken in to the police station, despite Max's protests.|$|E
5|$|While at the station, Max overhears his new partner, Valerie Winterson, {{talking on}} the phone about Mona. Suddenly, the station is {{attacked}} by <b>the</b> <b>Cleaners,</b> who are looking for Mona. Mona breaks out of her cell, and after fighting off <b>the</b> <b>Cleaners,</b> Max and Mona begin hunting down the people responsible for the attack. Their search leads them to a construction site, where he and Mona defend themselves against <b>the</b> <b>Cleaners.</b> After their foes leave, Winterson arrives and holds Mona at gunpoint. Mona claims that Winterson is there to kill her, while Winterson claims that she is simply trying to arrest a fleeing fugitive. After several moments of consideration, Max fatally shoots Winterson, allowing Mona to escape. Before she dies, Winterson shoots Max, hospitalizing him.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Cleaners</b> raid the Hospital {{building}} {{looking for}} Max, but Max manages to fight his way out. He visits Senator Alfred Woden, {{the leader of}} the Inner Circle, who reveals that <b>the</b> <b>Cleaners</b> work for Lem; Lem wants to secure control of the criminal underground and the Inner Circle by killing Gognitti and Woden. Max raids Lem's restaurant, killing several of his henchmen, and discovers that Winterson was Lem's mistress. He then races to Gognitti's hideout to save him from Lem, and the two flee to Mona's funhouse hoping that she can help them, but Lem ambushes them. He reveals that Mona is a hired gun for Woden, with orders to kill Lem and Max. Lem murders Gognitti, shoots Max and leaves him for dead. Mona rescues Max, and together, they go to Woden's mansion to save him from Lem.|$|E

50|$|On June 3, 2016, a {{woman was}} caught on camera berating a cleaner and her manager at the mall's Koufu food court. <b>The</b> <b>cleaner,</b> who is deaf and mute and {{looked to be in}} his 70s, had tried to clear her table before she {{finished}} her food. Enraged, she shouted at <b>the</b> <b>cleaner,</b> who walked away, after which she appeared to continue having her meal calmly. However, when her husband returned to her table, she insisted that her husband brought <b>the</b> <b>cleaner</b> back so that he could apologise to her. Despite <b>the</b> <b>cleaner's</b> manager apologising on behalf of his subordinate and explaining that he was deaf and mute, the lady scolded the manager instead for between 15 to 20 minutes.|$|R
50|$|The {{presence}} of <b>the</b> <b>cleaner</b> mimic, P. rhinorhynchos, {{has a negative}} impact on the foraging success of <b>the</b> <b>cleaner</b> model L. dimidiatus. P. rhinorhynchos feeds by eating the tissue and scales of client fish, making client fish much more cautious while at cleaning stations. More aggressive mimics have a greater negative impact on the foraging rate and success of <b>the</b> <b>cleaner</b> fish. When mimics appear in higher densities relative to cleaners, there is a significant decline in the success rate of <b>the</b> <b>cleaner</b> fish. <b>The</b> effects of the mimic/model ratio are susceptible to dilution, whereby an increase in client fish allows both the mimics and the models to have more access to clients, thus limiting the negative effects that mimics have on model foraging success.|$|R

25|$|As {{the gang}} grew {{in size and}} influence, they began hiring {{themselves}} out as hitmen and took part in <b>the</b> <b>Cleaners</b> and Dyers war. The Purples profited from the Detroit laundry industry unions and associations. They were hired out to keep union members in line and to harass non-union independents. Bombing, arson, theft, and murder were the usual tactics that the gang employed to enforce union policy.|$|E
25|$|A {{misrepresentation}} is a {{false statement}} of fact or law that is relied on by the other party in entering a contract. For example, in Curtis v Chemical Cleaning and Dyeing Co Ms Curtis took a wedding dress with beads and sequins to <b>the</b> <b>cleaners.</b> They gave her a contract to sign and she asked the assistant what it was. The assistant said it was to stop risk to the beads. In fact the contract exempted all liability. The dress was stained. But the exclusion was ineffective because of the assistant's misrepresentation.|$|E

5000|$|This example meets some, but not all, of the {{criteria}} described in Trivers’s model. In the cleaner-host system the benefit to <b>the</b> <b>cleaner</b> is always immediate. However, the evolution of reciprocal altruism is contingent on opportunities for future rewards through repeated interactions. In one study, nearby host fish observed [...] "cheater" [...] cleaners and subsequently avoided them. In these examples, true reciprocity is difficult to demonstrate since failure means the death of <b>the</b> <b>cleaner.</b> However, if Randall’s claim that hosts sometimes chase off possible dangers to <b>the</b> <b>cleaner</b> is correct, an experiment might be constructed in which reciprocity could be demonstrated.|$|R

25|$|At Uxbridge, Middlesex Crusaders {{proved the}} worth of wicket-taking bowling. Irfan Pathan dug out Matthew Walker with the second ball of the game, and that set {{the tone of the}} innings. Left-arm spinner Chris Peploe took three wickets, but conceded 35 runs, yet Kent's final total of 144 for 8 did not look too threatening. Owais Shah kept {{ploughing}} on his hard-hitting form, taking James Tredwell to <b>the</b> <b>cleaners</b> in his 59 not out, and Middlesex made it to 145 for 4 with 16 balls remaining in the innings, as none of the opposition bowlers took more than one wicket.|$|E
25|$|Australia dug {{themselves}} out of the hole, however, Michael Clarke and Michael Hussey slowly accumulating to increase the rate. England clearly lacked a fifth bowler, opting instead for Vikram Solanki to bat down the order, so they used a combination of Michael Vaughan, Solanki and Collingwood to get through their ten required overs. That let Australia off the hook, with Clarke and Hussey adding 105, before Jon Lewis – who had been taken to <b>the</b> <b>cleaners</b> earlier on – dug out Michael Clarke with an inside edge onto the stumps, taking the fifth wicket of the game {{at just the right}} time. Shane Watson accumulated well with Hussey, however, hitting six an over as Lewis was smashed about again, but Harmison got his revenge by completing his first five-wicket haul in ODIs as Hussey was beaten by a slower ball – the first time Hussey had been dismissed in One Day Internationals, for a batting average of 229. Then, Andrew Flintoff was brought back, getting a splendid yorker in for Watson, who was out for 25 just as the Aussies were preparing to hit out – the score 220 for 7 after 44.1 overs. Jason Gillespie and Brad Hogg survived a couple of overs from Flintoff and Harmison – meaning that Harmison finished with five for 33 off ten overs. Towards the end, Australia built up again, before losing Gillespie to a top edge, but 244 for 8 with seven balls remaining still looked difficult for England to chase. Gough dug out Michael Kasprowicz with a yorker with two balls to spare, and four legbyes ended the innings to take Australia to 252 for 9.|$|E
500|$|Some species use {{cleaner fish}} to remove {{external}} parasites. The {{best known of}} these are the Bluestreak cleaner wrasses of the genus Labroides found on coral reefs in the Indian and Pacific oceans. These small fish maintain so-called [...] "cleaning stations" [...] where other fish congregate and perform specific movements {{to attract the attention}} of <b>the</b> <b>cleaners.</b> Cleaning behaviors have been observed in a number of fish groups, including an interesting case between two cichlids of the same genus, Etroplus maculatus, the cleaner, and the much larger Etroplus suratensis.|$|E

At 04:03, one of <b>the</b> <b>cleaners</b> noticed smoke, and shouted to the mechanics that they should turn off the overhead current. The current was kept on and the pantographs kept up {{so it would be}} easy to get out of the trams in case of a fire. All the workers were in the annex, while the fire had started in the main wing. Two of the trams at the back were ablaze. [...] One of the mechanics ran to turn off the power, while the other went to phone the fire department. [...] Based on the requirements of the insurance policy, the depot was always to be manned, and in case of a fire trams were to be driven out. [...] At this point in time such actions would still have been possible, but were not done due to the confusion.

2500|$|From 1973 to 1976, in her ongoing piece Up to and Including Her Limits, a naked Scheemann is {{suspended}} {{from a tree}} surgeon's harness, which is attached from the ceiling above a canvas. Using the motions of her body to make marks with a crayon, the artist maps time processes as a video monitor records {{the movement of the}} artist. In this work, Schneemann addresses the male-dominated art world of Abstract Expressionism and action painting, specifically work done by artists Jackson Pollock and Willem de Kooning. Schneemann arrived at the museum when it opened with <b>the</b> <b>cleaners,</b> guards, secretaries, maintenance crew and remained until it closed. Through this practice the artist explored the political and personal implications of the museum space by enabling the place of art creation and art presentation to become one. Schneemann intended to do away with performance, a fixed audience, rehearsals, improvisation, sequences, conscious intention, technical cues, and a central metaphor or theme in order to explore what is left. [...] In 1984, Schneemann completed the final video, a compilation of video footage from six performances: the Berkeley Museum, 1974; London Filmmaker's Cooperative, 1974; Artists Space, NY, 1974; Anthology Film Archives, NY, 1974; The Kitchen, NY, 1976; and the Studio Galerie, Berlin, 1976.|$|E

[...] That was my senior year and I was a ‘new boy’, having just moved to Massillon that summer from the wide open spaces of South Dakota, Wyoming and Nebraska. [...] The first day at school several of my classmates came around to suggest that of course I was coming out for football; and although I protested that I {{had never had a}} ball in my hands, they countered with the argument that I was a good sized lump of a boy and would make a fine prospect. [...] So I promised. [...] Well the only preparation necessary was to take an old pair of shoes down to the town cobbler and have some cleats nailed on them. [...] I think the athletic association must have had some football pants, but I do remember distinctly that you had to furnish your own stockings (any color) and an old sweater. [...] Put these on and you were in business. [...] I can’t believe that there were more than 11 candidates out because I made the team the first afternoon. [...] Nor did we have a regular coach. [...] A boy named Fritz Merwin, who I think had played the year before was our coach. [...] If you ask me, he’s the one whose picture ought to be hanging up around there someplace. [...] He didn’t get paid anything, and if a coach ever had an awkward squad of 11 nit-wits, he did. [...] But he was out there every afternoon, early and late teaching us fundamentals instead of fancy razzle-dazzle plays, and in the end it paid off because we won a few games.

the bit you put down your throat we have to be thankful for our mangy cup of tea itself as a great compliment to be noticed the way the world is divided in any case if its going to go on I want at least two other good chemises for one thing and but I dont know what kind of drawers he likes none at all I think didnt he say yes and half the girls in Gibraltar never wore them either naked as God made them that Andalusian singing her Manola she didnt make much secret of what she hadnt yes and the second pair of silkette stockings is laddered after one days wear I could have brought them back to Lewers this morning and kicked up a row and made that one change them only not to upset myself and run the risk of walking into him and ruining the whole thing and one of those kidfitting corsets Id want advertised cheap in the Gentlewoman with elastic gores on the hips he saved the one I have but thats no good what did they say they give a delightful figure line 11/6 obviating that unsightly broad appearance across the lower back to reduce flesh my belly is a bit too big Ill have to knock off the stout at dinner or am I getting too fond of it the last they sent from ORourkes was as flat as a pancake he makes his money easy Larry they call him the old mangy parcel he sent at Xmas a cottage cake and a bottle of hogwash he tried to palm off as claret that he couldnt get anyone to drink God spare his spit for fear hed die of the drouth or I must do a few breathing exercises I wonder is that antifat any good might overdo it the thin ones are not so much the fashion now garters that much I have the violet pair I wore today thats all he bought me out of the cheque he got on the first O no there was the face lotion I finished the last of yesterday that made my skin like new I told him over and over again get that made up in the same place and dont forget it God only knows whether he did after all I said to him 111 know by the bottle anyway if not I suppose 111 only have to wash in my piss like beeftea or chickensoup with some of that opoponax and violet I thought it was beginning to look coarse or old a bit the skin underneath is much finer where it peeled off there on my finger after the burn its a pity it isnt all like that and the four paltry handkerchiefs about 6/- in all sure you cant get on in this world without style all going in food and rent when I get it Ill lash it around I tell you in fine style I always want to throw a handful of tea into the pot measuring and mincing if I buy a pair of old brogues itself do you like those new shoes yes how much were they Ive no clothes at all the brown costume and the skirt and jacket and the one at <b>the</b> <b>cleaners</b> 3 whats that for any woman cutting up this old hat and patching up the other the men wont look at you and women try to walk on you because they know youve no man then with all the things getting dearer every day for the 4 years more I have of life up to 35 no Im what am I at all 111 be 33 in September will I what O well look at that Mrs Galbraith shes much older than me I saw her when I was out last week her beautys on the wane she was a lovely woman magnificent head of hair on her down to her waist tossing it back like that like Kitty OShea in Grantham street 1st thing I did every morning to look across see her combing it as if she loved it and was full of it pity I only got to know her the day before we left and that Mrs Langtry the jersey lily the prince of Wales was in love with I suppose hes like the first man going the roads only for the name of a king theyre all made the one way only a black mans Id like to try a beauty up to what was she 45 there was some funny story about the jealous old husband what was it at all and an oyster knife he went no he made her wear a kind of a tin thing round her and the prince of Wales yes he had the oyster knife cant be true a thing like that like some of those books he brings me the works of Master Francois Somebody supposed to be a priest about a child born out of her ear because her bumgut fell out a nice word for any priest to write and her a--e as if any fool wouldnt know what that meant I hate that pretending of all things with that old blackguards face on him anybody can see its not true and that Ruby and Fair Tyrants he brought me that twice I remember when I came to page 5 o the part about where she hangs him up out of a hook with a cord flagellate sure theres nothing for a woman in that all invention made up about he drinking the champagne out of her slipper after the ball was over like the infant Jesus in the crib at Inchicore in the Blessed Virgins arms sure no woman could have a child that big taken out of her and I thought first it came out of her side because how could she go to the chamber when she wanted to and she a rich lady of course she felt honoured H R H he was in Gibraltar the year I was born I bet he found lilies there too where he planted the tree he planted more than that in his time he might have planted me too if hed come a bit sooner then I wouldnt be here as I am he ought to chuck that Freeman with the paltry few shillings he knocks out of it and go into an office or something where hed get regular pay or a bank where they could put him up on a throne to count the money all the day of course he prefers plottering about the house so you cant stir with him any side whats your programme today I wish hed even smoke a pipe like father to get the smell of a man or pretending to be mooching about for advertisements when he could have been in Mr Cuffes still only for what he did then sending me to try and patch it up I could have got him promoted there to be the manager he gave me a great mirada once or twice first he was as stiff as the mischief really and truly Mrs Bloom only I felt rotten simply with the old rubbishy dress that I lost the leads out of the tails with no cut in it but theyre coming into fashion again I bought it simply to please him I knew it was no good by the finish pity I changed my mind of going to Todd and Bums as I said and not Lees it was just like the shop itself rummage sale a lot of trash I hate those rich shops get on your nerves nothing kills me altogether only he thinks he knows a great lot about a womans dress and cooking mathering everything he can scour off the shelves into it if I went by his advices every blessed hat I put on does that suit me yes take that thats alright the one like a weddingcake standing up miles off my head he said suited me or the dishcover one coming down on my backside on pins and needles about the shopgirl in that place in Grafton street I had the misfortune to bring him into and she as insolent as ever she could be with her smirk saying Im afraid were giving you too much trouble what shes there for but I stared it out of her yes he was awfully stiff and no wonder but he changed the second time he looked Poldy pigheaded as usual like the soup but I could see him looking very hard at my chest when he stood up to open the door for me it was nice of him to show me out in any case Im extremely sorry Mrs Bloom believe me without making it too marked the first time after him being insulted and me being supposed to be his wife I just half smiled I know my chest was out that way at the door when he said Im extremely sorry and Im sure you were

40|$|Ok Tedi Mining Limited {{generates a}} copper and gold {{concentrate}} from its porphyry and skarn ore deposits located at Mt. Fublian, Western Province, PNG. The predominant porphyry ore-type is blended with high grade skarn ores to optimize copper and gold feed grades to the concentrator. Current operation (2003) is to blend 80 % porphyry with 20 % skarn ores, {{resulting in an}} acceptable concentrate grade and recovery. However, when the proportion of skarn ore in the plant feed exceeds 20 %, low flotation recovery is often observed. Approximately 20 % of the copper and 30 % gold losses occur through the rougher flotation circuit. However, losses via <b>the</b> <b>cleaner</b> tailing stream are 8 % and 9 % for copper and gold, respectively, and augment value mineral losses to the final tailing. It may be noted that <b>the</b> <b>cleaner</b> tailing stream contains value minerals which have already been successfully floated in the rougher section of the concentrator, and are therefore recoverable. This study has the objective of determining the reasons for copper and gold loss in <b>the</b> <b>cleaner</b> tailing. <b>The</b> focus is therefore on <b>the</b> <b>cleaner</b> flotation bank and related streams. The project strategy commenced with characterization of <b>the</b> <b>cleaner</b> circuit performance under various operating conditions. This would provide evidence for any proposed mechanisms to explain the losses of valuable minerals to <b>the</b> <b>cleaner</b> tailing. <b>The</b> {{second part of the}} project strategy was to evaluate potential methods for improvement of cleaner flotation performance via laboratory flotation tests. To complete the work, plant trials of methods showing benefit in the laboratory were conducted. Characterisation surveys of <b>the</b> <b>cleaner</b> flotation bank were conducted as a function of ore blend, pulp and surface chemistry, mineralogy, flotation kinetics, particle size distribution, cleaner flotation cell hydrodynamic characterisation and residence time. These studies indicated that for greater than 20 % pyrite skarn in the concentrator feed blend, lower than expected gold and copper recoveries were achieved in <b>the</b> <b>cleaner</b> bank. Pulp and surface chemical analytical techniques indicated layers of oxide coatings existed on all particles, depressing flotation. Oxide coatings had also resulted in the copper activation of pyrite (CuS rimming), making separation from copper sulfides difficult. Losses included coarse composite particles, also suggesting possible liberation issues. However, liberated copper sulfides were also lost, supporting the notion of depression via oxide coatings. Residence time calculations for <b>the</b> <b>cleaner</b> flotation bank suggested that the flotation capacity was less than adequate, particularly at high mill throughput rates. Hydrodynamic characterisation indicated improvements in cell hydrodynamics were warranted. In contrast to the oxidised ore feed blend described above, when less than 20 % pyrite skarn was contained in the ore blend, high copper and gold recoveries were achieved in <b>the</b> <b>cleaner</b> bank. Laboratory tests suggested that increasing cleaner feed pH from 10. 5 to 11. 5, and 1 or collector addition to <b>the</b> <b>cleaner</b> feed, would result in improved cleaner flotation performance. These changes were trialed in the plant, with the pH adjustment being successful. High cleaner feed pH continues as a permanent modification to plant operating conditions...|$|R
