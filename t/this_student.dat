5|$|Georgia Tech's mascot Buzz got {{his start}} in the 1970s. The {{original}} Georgia Tech Yellow Jacket mascot was Judi McNair who donned a homemade yellowjacket costume in 1972 and performed at home football games. She rode on the Ramblin' Wreck and appears in the 1972 Georgia Tech Blueprint yearbook. McNair's mascot was considered a great idea, {{as it was a}} big hit with the fans. In 1979, McNair's idea for a Yellow Jacket was reintroduced by another Georgia Tech student, Richie Bland. Bland, who was apparently unaware of McNair's prior initiative, paid $1,400 to have a local theme park costume designer make a yellowjacket costume that he first wore at a pep rally prior to the Tennessee football game. Rather than obtain permission from Georgia Tech as Judi had done in 1972, <b>this</b> <b>student</b> simply sneaked onto the field in costume during a football game and ran across the field. The fans believed that this costumed character was acting as an official member of the cheerleading squad and responded accordingly. By 1980, this new incarnation of the yellow jacket mascot was given the name Buzz Bee and was adopted as an official mascot by Georgia Tech. This new Buzz character would be the model for a new Georgia Tech emblem, designed in 1985 by Mike Lester.|$|E

40|$|The {{current study}} {{included}} two experiments that functionally analyzed stereotypical oral-digital behavior of one female student with profound mental retardation. An analogue functional {{analysis was used}} in Experiment 1 to detect {{the function of the}} student's oral-digital stereotypy which might serve to escape from task demands, obtain attention from others, or produce sensory self-stimulation. An analysis of sensory modalities was conducted in Experiment 2 to further analyze the possible sensory consequences maintaining the student's repetitive oral-digital. Results of the present study demonstrated that multiple consequences which included drawing attention from teachers and producing sensory stimulation could serve to maintain <b>this</b> <b>student's</b> stereotypy. The specific sensory function of <b>this</b> <b>student's</b> oral-digital stereotypy might be maintained by tactile stimulation. These findings were further discussed in terms of the sensory and social reinforcers that execute their impacts on <b>this</b> <b>student's</b> stereotypical behavior, and procedures used to detect those functions...|$|R

5|$|Having {{escaped the}} {{buildings}} {{in a variety}} of ways (including through doors and out of windows), some students found themselves impeded by a river that adjoined the school. However, some were able to use rowing boats as a means of escape. Saari started fires at several other locations within the school buildings, and the fire in the exam room damaged some of the bodies so badly that they had to be identified from DNA and dental records. Nine of the victims were found in the exam room, and one in a nearby corridor. It was later ascertained that <b>this</b> <b>student</b> had fled the burning classroom and then died in the corridor. Eight of the victims were female students, one a male student, and one a male member of staff. All of the students killed were in their 20s, and the teacher was in his 50s. A 21-year-old woman was shot in the head but had two operations in the days after sustaining her injury, and was reported as being in a satisfactory condition. A further ten students were treated for minor injuries including sprains and cuts from broken glass. All the victims were classmates of Saari's. Saari was originally from Pohjois-Pohjanmaa, but lived in Kauhajoki where he was enrolled on his catering course at the college. It was later revealed that the male student was probably a close friend of Saari's. The pair had spent an evening out together in February 2008 when they were threatened with a starter pistol. A photo of them together had been circulating on the Internet, in which Saari jokingly points at his friend's head with his forefinger. The names of the other victims were withheld by police.|$|E

25|$|In October 2002, the College Board {{dropped the}} Score Choice Option for SAT-II exams.

It is described as optional, and it is not clear if the reports sent will indicate whether or not <b>this</b> <b>student</b> has opted-in or not. A number of highly selective colleges and universities, including Yale, the University of Pennsylvania, and Stanford, have announced they will require applicants to submit all scores.

25|$|As a result, all Brenda's friends {{apologized for}} their {{behavior}} towards her. During the fourth season, Brenda {{is interested in}} the drama department but it also led to problems: she spoiled her first audition and then went to the director of the play to try again and convince him. She then got the role, but a student made a rumor saying that she had slept to have the role. Unfortunately, <b>this</b> <b>student</b> was the girlfriend of Steve Sanders and the latter believed the rumors, others refusing more or less to believe the denials of Brenda. Steve understood his mistake when the student asked him to attack Brenda to make her miss rehearsals. A little later, Steve's friend tried to commit suicide, but Brenda and Steve joined forces to save her and Steve was finally compensated by following Brenda's debut on stage. The director's praise led her to accept the latter at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Arts (RADA) in London for a year. After Kelly and Dylan last broke up, Brenda finally learned that a relationship was possible between Kelly and Brandon and expressed her blessing. She later spent her last night with Dylan, telling her she would not be gone forever. The couple will reconcile briefly in the final scene of the fourth season, though (because of Shannen Doherty's departure) Brenda's character was removed from the script and she never returned to Beverly Hills.|$|E
500|$|Within {{weeks of}} Ross's death, former cadets at Texas AMC began {{gathering}} {{funds for a}} monument. In 1917, the state appropriated $10,000 for the monument, and two years later, a 10-ft (3m) bronze statue of Ross, sculpted by Pompeo Coppini, was unveiled {{at the center of}} the Texas AMC campus. In more recent years, students began the tradition of placing pennies at the feet of statue before exams for good luck. School legend states that Ross would often tutor students, and as payment would accept only a penny for their thoughts. At exam time, his statue, located in Academic Plaza, is often covered in pennies. Country singer Granger Smith, an A graduate, wrote a song titled We Bleed Maroon, with a chorus having the line [...] "put a penny on old Sully and wish me some luck" [...] in homage to <b>this</b> <b>student</b> tradition.|$|E
