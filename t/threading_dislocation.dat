Two dislocations on the same or on intersecting slip planes may react to form a <b>threading</b> <b>dislocation</b> segment that does not glide {{under the influence of}} the misfit strain. In the coplanar case, a kinetic barrier exists that slows down dislocation migration. For the reaction involving dislocations on intersecting planes, an energetic barrier impedes other advancing dislocations.

40|$|Growth of terrace graded virtual substrates, {{pioneered by}} Capewell (2002), has been {{conducted}} utilising solid-source molecular beam epitaxy (SS-MBE) to produce structures of higher germanium composition (up to pure germanium) and greater thickness (up to 20 ?m) than previously investigated. Terrace grading offers a number of advantages over more conventional grading techniques which include the reduction of surface <b>threading</b> <b>dislocation</b> density, reduction of surface roughness {{and the possibility of}} the complete elimination of <b>threading</b> <b>dislocation</b> pile-up. The closely spaced pile-up of threading dislocations is believed to {{have a significant impact on}} the electrical properties of processed devices, and its elimination is a key goal in this work. Numerous terrace graded virtual substrate compositions have been grown and characterised during the course of this work and, where appropriate, comparison made with more conventional structures. The complete elimination of <b>threading</b> <b>dislocation</b> pile-up has been demonstrated at compositions of 30 % and 40 %, with a reduced <b>threading</b> <b>dislocation</b> density in comparison to equivalent liner graded structures. A major reduction in <b>threading</b> <b>dislocation</b> density has been accomplished though post growth ex-situ annealing at 900 ?c for an extend period of time, though the exact mechanism remains uncertain. The possible role of surface precipitates enabling reduction of dislocation pile-up and/or density is considered along with the effects of unwanted particulate contamination during growth.

40|$|International audienceThe {{existence}} of <b>threading</b> <b>dislocations</b> in ferroelectric heterostructures has been frequently reported.

The <b>threading</b> <b>dislocations</b> exhibited by the PbZr 0. 2 Ti 0. 8 O 3 films were investigated by cross-sectional and plan-view (high-resolution) transmission electron microscopy. Many <b>threading</b> <b>dislocations</b> were dissociated into dipoles spanning a -most probably lead-rich- stacking fault.

We find that <b>threading</b> <b>dislocation</b> densities decay exponentially {{as a function of}} the strain relieved, irrespective of the fraction of threading dislocations that are mobile. Reactions between threading dislocations tend to produce a population that is a balanced mixture of mobile and sessile in (001) cubic materials.

This indicates that the scattering rate of conduction electrons in the BaSnO 3 system is strongly affected by the site at which the dopants are located. More importantly, we found that electron scattering by <b>threading</b> <b>dislocations</b> also depends critically on the dopant site. We propose that the large enhancement of scattering by the <b>threading</b> <b>dislocations</b> in Sb-doped BaSnO 3 films is caused by the combination effect of the change in the distribution of Sb impurities in the films, the formation of the Sb impurity clusters near the <b>threading</b> <b>dislocations,</b> and the conduction electron clustering near the Sb impurities...|$|R

Plan-view transmission electron microscopy (TEM) indicates a significant increase in <b>threading</b> <b>dislocation</b> density for InSbInSb films grown on the low-misfit buffers, and a significant decrease in <b>threading</b> <b>dislocation</b> density for InSbInSb films grown on high-misfit or step-graded buffers, in comparison with those grown directly on GaAsGaAs.

A quantitative analysis of electron mobility and carrier-concentration dependence on <b>threading</b> <b>dislocation</b> density suggests that electron scattering from the lattice dilation associated with threading dislocations has a stronger effect on electron mobility than electron scattering from the depletion potential surrounding the dislocations.

40|$|The {{scope of}} this thesis is the epitaxy of group-III nitride heterostructures on (0001) {{sapphire}} substrates for the fabrication of semiconductor laser diodes. MOVPE as well as MBE were used to deposit the structures. The growth of the epilayers was studied {{with regard to the}} <b>threading</b> <b>dislocation</b> density, the strain state and the thermodynamic stability. In general, a low <b>threading</b> <b>dislocation</b> density is obtained for growth processes showing an elongated island growth mode, as those grow free of dislocations. According experiments are discussed on the background of a thermodynamic description of the decomposition reaction. The <b>threading</b> <b>dislocation</b> density was estimated by x-ray diffraction, using a model based on the concept of mosaic crystals. It describes the microstructure of the layer as many dislocation-free, but tilted and twisted crystals. It was shown by plan-view TEM images, that the edge- and screw-type <b>threading</b> <b>dislocation</b> densities can be determined within reasonable limits of accuracy. The strain state of the studied GaN layers is found to correlate with the island diameter at coalescence. The thermal compressive strain at room temperature is partly compensated by an intrinsic, tensile strain, which forms during growth and depends on the average island size. It might be a consequence of the gap closure process during island coalescence. The photoluminescence of InGaN quantum wells was studied for different well thicknesses and Si doping levels of the GaN barriers. The structures were simulated numerically, taking piezoelectric fields into account. The results point towards a light emission mechanism governed by well thickness fluctuations superimposed by the piezoelectric field. The increased electron density induced by the Si doping is proposed to block the localized states of the threading dislocations, acting as nonradiative centers.

40|$|The {{development}} of electric-field-induced optical modulation in the materials capable of monolithically integrated on silicon (Si) substrates offer {{the possibility of}} high-speed modulation in a pico second timeframe as well as low power consumption, key requirements for integrated modulator applications. This thesis presents {{a study of the}} Franz-Keldysh effect in germanium (Ge) layers epitaxially grown on Si substrates, by using free-space spectral responsivity measurement. Generalized Franz-Keldysh formalism and separately measured Ge material constants were used to calculate theoretical results, which were in agreement with experimental data. The Franz-Keldysh model predicts that the Ge layers on Si substrates will be the best material for phase modulation at nearly 2 [mu]m wavelength, with a value of L, of 3. 8 mm and insertion loss of 0. 4 dB. In addition, this thesis presents the design of silicon-germanium (SixGe 1 -x) electroabsorption and phase modulators at 1. 55 pLm wavelength from the Franz-Keldysh model. The composition optimized for electroabsorption and phase modulator applications is SixGe 1 -x with a value of x~ 0. 075 and 0. 135, respectively. To achieve high-quality Ge-rich SiGe materials for the modulator applications, deposition of SixGe 1 -x (0. 008 <x< 0. 125) buffers at low temperature was performed, and the growth kinetic was studied. The films were deposited on SiGe buffers to reduce lattice mismatch between the buffers and the remainders of the films, and were in-situ annealed in the same condition as was used for similarly grown Ge films for a reduction of <b>threading</b> <b>dislocation</b> density. Si 0. 15 Ge 0. 85 p-i-n diodes and Sio. 15 Geo. ss rib waveguides were fabricated. (cont.) High leakage current in the Si 0. 15 Ge 0. 85 p-i-n diodes was due to dislocation defects consistent with measured <b>threading</b> <b>dislocation</b> density from PV-TEM images, which showed <b>threading</b> <b>dislocation</b> density of approximately 1. 5 ± 0. 5 x 109 cm- 2. The analysis shows that <b>threading</b> <b>dislocation</b> density below 5 x 107 cm- 2 is required for high performance of p-i-n diodes. Furthermore, high optical loss was measured in Si 0. 15 Ge 0. 85 rib waveguides and strip-load waveguides. The loss is due to light scattering at sidewalls and dislocations. Scattering from dislocations less than 1 x 108 cm- 2 is required for loss below materials' interband absorption. This high <b>threading</b> <b>dislocation</b> density shows that the annealing condition used for Ge-on-Si is not effective in reduction of <b>threading</b> <b>dislocation</b> density in Si 0. 15 Ge 0. 85.
