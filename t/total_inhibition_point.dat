We now present evidence that the twin tyrosines also control the insulin-mediated stimulation of glycogen synthesis. Surprisingly, this type of Chinese hamster ovary transfectant is as hypersensitive to insulin for its mitogenic effect as are Chinese hamster ovary cells expressing many intact insulin receptors. Such data suggest that (i) the insulin mitogenic effect routes through a different pathway than insulin uses to activate the transport and metabolism of glucose and (ii) the mitogenic effect of insulin is not controlled by the twin tyrosines. At the molecular level, the solubilized mutated receptor has no insulin-dependent tyrosine kinase activity, whereas this receptor displays measurable insulin-stimulated phosphorylation of its beta subunit in 32 P-labeled cells. We therefore propose that the autocatalytic phosphorylating activity of the receptor reports a cryptic tyrosine kinase activity that cannot be visualized {{by the use of}} classical exogenous substrates...|$|R

This study reports the activity of two ITCs [allylisothiocyanate (AITC) and 2 -phenylethylisothiocyanate (PEITC) ] on bacterial motility and prevention of biofilm formation by Escherichia coli, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus and Listeria monocytogenes. AITC caused <b>total</b> <b>inhibition</b> of swimming (P. aeruginosa) and swarming (E. coli, P. aeruginosa) motilities.

Significant preventive action with AITC on biofilm formation by P. aeruginosa (90 %) and by L. monocytogenes (61 %), and with PEITC on biofilm formation by S. aureus (75 %) was verified.

Mosquito infection rates (IR) were compared. infection rates correlated positively with gametocyte and oocyst densities.

Surprisingly, TGF-beta(1) -activated MyoFbs are growth-arrested not only at G 1 -phase but also at S-phase of the cell cycle. Staining with TUNEL indicates that these cells carry DNA damages. However, the absolute majority of MyoFbs are non-apoptotic cells as established with two apoptosis-specific methods, flow cytometry and caspase-dependent cleavage of cytokeratin 18. Expression in MyoFbs of proliferative cell nuclear antigen {{even in the absence}} of serum confirms that these MyoFbs perform repair of DNA damages. These results suggest that TGF-beta(1) -activated MyoFbs can be growth-arrested by two checkpoints, the G 1 /S checkpoint, which prevents cells from entering S-phase and the intra-S checkpoint, which is activated by encountering DNA damage during the S phase or by unrepaired damage that escapes the G 1 /S checkpoint. Despite carrying of the DNA damages TGF-beta(1) -activated MyoFbs are highly functional cells producing lysyl oxidase and contracting the collagen matrix. (C) 2008 Elsevier Inc.
