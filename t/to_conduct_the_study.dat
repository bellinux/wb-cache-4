NASA selected TRW's Space & Electronics Group, Eastman Kodak and Hughes Danbury Optical Systems <b>to</b> <b>conduct</b> <b>the</b> <b>study.</b> In 1998, TRW Inc. {{was selected as the}} contractor for the SIM Lite project; Northrup Grumman acquired part of TRW in 2002 and took over the contract. Also selected was Lockheed Martin Missiles and Space located in Sunnyvale, California. The two contracts, which included the mission formulation and implementation phases, were announced in September 1998 and worth a total of over US$200million. The formulation phase of the mission included initial mission design and planning for the full scale implementation of the mission. At the time of the NASA announcement, launch was scheduled for 2005 and the mission was part of the Origins Program, a series of missions designed to answer questions such as the origin of life Earth.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—There is {{a growing}} {{consensus}} that crosscutting concerns harm code quality. An example of a crosscutting concern is a functional requirement whose implementation is distributed across multiple software modules. We asked the question, “How much does the amount that a concern is crosscutting affect the number of defects in a program? ” We conducted three extensive case studies to help answer this question. All three studies revealed a moderate to strong statistically significant correlation between the degree of scattering {{and the number of}} defects. This paper describes the experimental framework we developed <b>to</b> <b>conduct</b> <b>the</b> <b>studies,</b> <b>the</b> metrics we adopted and developed to measure the degree of scattering, <b>the</b> <b>studies</b> we performed, <b>the</b> efforts we undertook to remove experimental and other biases, and the results we obtained. In the process, we have formulated a theory that explains why increased scattering might lead to increased defects.
