5|$|FLCN {{creates a}} protein called folliculin that has two isoforms. It appears {{to act as}} a tumor {{suppressor}} and is expressed strongly in the skin, distal nephrons, and type I pneumocytes. It has also been found in <b>the</b> <b>parotid</b> <b>gland,</b> brain, breast, pancreas, prostate, and ovaries. Tumor suppressors normally prevent cells from growing and dividing too rapidly or in an uncontrolled way. Mutations in the FLCN gene may interfere with the ability of folliculin to restrain cell growth and division, leading to the formation of noncancerous and cancerous tumors. Recent studies suggest that folliculin accomplishes this function through its involvement with cellular metabolism, possibly through modulation of the mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin) pathway and/or oxidative phosphorylation in mitochondria. Folliculin interacts with FNIP1 and FNIP2 (FLCN-interacting protein) to form a complex with AMP-activated protein kinase. Folliculin's participation in the mTOR pathway may explain the similarity in phenotype between BHD syndrome, Cowden syndrome, tuberous sclerosis, and Peutz-Jeghers syndrome.|$|E

25|$|The {{probability}} of xerostomia at one year increases by 5% for every 1Gy increase in dose to <b>the</b> <b>parotid</b> <b>gland.</b> Doses above 25–30Gy {{are associated with}} moderate to severe xerostomia. Similar considerations apply to the submandibular gland, but xerostomia is less common if only one parotid gland {{is included in the}} radiated field and the contralateral submandibular gland is spared (less than 39Gy) In the same manner, radiation dose to the pharyngeal constrictor muscles, larynx, and cricopharyngeal inlet determine the risk of dysphagia (and hence dependence on gastrostomy tube feeds). The threshold for this toxicity is volume-dependent at 55–60Gy, with moderate to severe impairment of swallowing, including aspiration, stricture and feeding tube dependence above a mean dose of 47Gy, with a recommended dose to the inferior constrictor of less than 41Gy. Dose-toxicity relationships for the superior and middle constrictors are steep, with a 20% increase in the {{probability of}} dysphagia for each 10Gy.

25|$|The {{day before}} {{yesterday}} I was present at an operation performed by Dr. George McClellan, on a gentleman from Virginia. It consisted in {{the removal of the}} whole of <b>the</b> <b>parotid</b> <b>gland</b> in a scirrhous and much enlarged state, from {{the left side of the}} face. Nothing could exceed the combined coolness and skill manifested by Dr. M. throughout this terrible operation, which he has now performed for the eleventh time, and hitherto with remarkable success. On this occasion, however, he was doomed to disappointment, for the patient died last night, about thirty-six hours after the operation. McClellan sent for me in the evening, to see the dying man with him, and we met in the chamber of death between ten and eleven o'clock. I had sometimes heard McClellan spoken of as a heartless surgeon, devoid of feeling or sympathy for those who came under his knife; but I can solemnly aver that I have seldom witnessed more unaffected sorrow than he manifested on this occasion. He walked the room incessantly, and repeatedly clasped my hands in his, while he expressed, in emphatic language, the feelings that preyed upon his mind. He moreover assured me, that he seldom performed one of his severer operations without first asking the blessing of God on his undertaking; and that days and nights of painful anxiety, often preceded those great professional efforts which have justly placed his name on the pinnacle of surgical fame. The gurgling respiration of the unfortunate patient announced the near approach of death, and I withdrew, full of sympathy for the agonized emotions of my friend.|$|E

40|$|Objective: Our {{aim was to}} {{evaluate}} predictors of xerostomia in patients with head and neck cancers treated with intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT). Methods: Thirty-three patients with pharyngeal cancer were evaluated for xerostomia after having been treated with IMRT. All patients were treated with whole-neck irradiation of 46 – 50 Gy by IMRT, followed by boost IMRT to the high-risk clinical target volume to a total dose of 56 – 70 Gy in 28 – 35 fractions (median, 68 Gy). For boost IMRT, a second computed tomography (CT- 2) scan {{was done in the}} third to fourth week of IMRT. Xerostomia was scored 3 – 4 months after the start of IMRT. Results: The mean doses to the contralateral and ipsilateral <b>parotid</b> <b>glands</b> were 24. 0 – 6. 2 and 30. 3 – 6. 6 Gy, respectively. Among the 33 patients, xerostomia of grades 0, 1, 2 and 3 was noted in one, 18, 12 and two patients, respectively. Although the mean dose to <b>the</b> <b>parotid</b> <b>glands</b> was not correlated with the grade of xerostomia, the initial volume of <b>the</b> <b>parotid</b> <b>glands</b> was correlated with the grade of xerostomia (P = 0. 04). Of 17 patients with small <b>parotid</b> <b>glands</b> (< 38. 8 ml) on initial CT (CT- 1), 11 (65 %) showed grade 2 or grade 3 xerostomia, whereas only three (19 %) of 16 patientswith larger <b>parotid</b> <b>glands</b> showedgrade 2 xerostomia (P < 0. 05). Themean volumeof <b>the</b> <b>parotid</b> <b>glands</b> onCT- 1 was 43. 1 – 15. 2 ml, but decreased significantly to 32. 0 – 11. 4 ml (74 %) on CT- 2 (P < 0. 0001).

30|$|The general, but not {{significant}} observed lower mean SUV {{values in the}} submandibular glands {{may be explained by}} the argument that cutaneous cooling is not equally affective for both <b>the</b> <b>parotid</b> and submandibular <b>glands.</b> <b>The</b> first explanation for this observation might be that <b>the</b> <b>parotid</b> <b>glands</b> are more susceptible to external cooling than submandibular glands, due to their more superficial anatomical localization. Secondly, <b>the</b> <b>parotid</b> <b>glands</b> may have been cooled more effectively than the submandibular glands, causing a greater difference between the cooled and the non-cooled side. Another, although less likely, potential factor may be that <b>the</b> <b>parotid</b> and submandibular <b>glands</b> respond differently to cooling: causing differences in vasoconstriction, blood flow, cellular metabolism, and radiotracer uptake. A vast analysis of the assumed relation between skin temperature, perfusion of the salivary glands, and radiotracer uptake in patients undergoing PRLT may offer some clarification to the assumed underlying mechanism.|$|R

All patients were treated with curative intent. Salivary gland function was assessed by measuring stimulated salivary flow at the beginning, during and at the end of radiotherapy as well as 1, 6, 12, 24, and 36 months after treatment. Measurements were converted to flow rates and normalized relative to rates before treatment.
