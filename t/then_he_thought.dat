5|$|The UCR and the Frepaso united as a {{political}} coalition, the Alliance for Work, Justice and Education, led by Alfonsín, Fernando delaRúa and Rodolfo Terragno from the UCR, and Carlos Álvarez and Graciela Fernández Meijide from the Frepaso. The coalition won the 1997 legislative elections. Alfonsín {{did not agree with}} delaRúa about the fixed exchange rate used by <b>then.</b> <b>He</b> <b>thought</b> that it had been a good measure in the past but had become detrimental to the Argentine economy, while delaRúa supported it.|$|E
500|$|On {{that first}} mission, Tibbets saw in {{real-time}} that his bombs were falling on innocent civilians. [...] At the time, {{he thought to}} himself, [...] "People are getting killed down there that don't have any business getting killed. [...] Those are not soldiers." [...] But <b>then</b> <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> back to a lesson he had learned during his time at medical school from his roommate who was a doctor. [...] This doctor explained to him about his former classmates who failed the program {{and ended up in}} drug sales. [...] The reason why they had failed the program was because [...] "they had too much sympathy for their patients", which [...] "destroyed their ability to render the medical necessities". [...] It dawned on Tibbets that: ...|$|E
2500|$|Narrated Anas ibn Malik: [...] "I know (about) the Hijab (the {{order of}} veiling of women) {{more than anybody}} else. Ubay ibn Ka'b used to ask me about it. Allah's Apostle became the bridegroom of Zaynab bint Jahsh whom he married at Medina. After the sun had risen high in the sky, the Prophet invited the people to a meal. Allah's Apostle {{remained}} sitting and some people remained sitting with him after the other guests had left. Then Allah's Apostle {{got up and went}} away, and I too, followed him till he reached the door of 'Aisha's room. <b>Then</b> <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> that the people must have left the place by then, so he returned and I also returned with him. Behold, the people were still sitting at their places. So he went back again for the second time, and I went along with him too. When we reached the door of 'Aisha's room, he returned and I also returned with him to see that the people had left. Thereupon the Prophet hung a curtain between me and him and the Verse regarding the order for (veiling of women) Hijab was revealed." [...] , ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Uncle Dick {{started and}} turned pale. Fust 'e {{seemed as if}} 'e was going to speak, and <b>then</b> <b>'e</b> <b>thought</b> better of it. He sat staring at 'Arry as if 'e couldn't believe his eyes.|$|R
60|$|And <b>then,</b> as <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> {{of his own}} condition--that of a mere poor-house foundling--his {{eyes grew}} moist.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, {{of course}} Brassy didn't know that, and he wouldn't believe it until Captain Dale {{explained}} it to him. And <b>then</b> <b>he</b> said <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> {{ought to be able}} to hold the position because he was one of the best shots in the school." ...|$|R
60|$|He {{was turning}} away; and <b>then</b> <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> of Tess's tender letter.|$|E
60|$|<b>Then</b> <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> {{of going}} home, {{and the thought}} {{reminded}} him of Dan.|$|E
60|$|<b>Then</b> <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> of {{the girl}} to whom he had {{surrendered}} his sword.|$|E
60|$|Lemuel reflected, and <b>then</b> <b>he</b> said <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> {{you ought}} {{to find out about}} such things if you got a chance.|$|R
6000|$|... "No clever {{man would}} act in an ungentlemanly way," [...] said the curate, and <b>then</b> smiled, for <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> had unconsciously made an epigram.|$|R
60|$|Phonny {{ran up to}} the trap, {{and took}} hold of it. He lifted it up very cautiously. He shook {{it as well as}} <b>he</b> could, and <b>then</b> listened. <b>He</b> <b>thought</b> that <b>he</b> could hear or feel some slight motion within. He became very much excited.|$|R
60|$|<b>Then</b> <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> of his mission, and a bold plan {{came into}} his mind.|$|E
60|$|Mr. Vyner started, {{and half}} {{rose to his}} feet. <b>Then</b> <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> better of it.|$|E
6000|$|He {{thought about}} himself, {{and the whole}} earth [...] Of man the wonderful, and of the stars, [...] And how the deuce they ever could have birth; [...] And <b>then</b> <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> of earthquakes, and of wars, [...] How many miles the moon might have in girth, [...] Of air-balloons, and of the many bars [...] To perfect {{knowledge}} of the boundless skies;-- [...] And <b>then</b> <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> of Donna Julia's eyes.|$|E
60|$|Colonel Pepper, thus appealed to, blushed, looked embarrassed, coughed, and <b>then</b> {{replied that}} <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> Germany was quite {{large enough for}} such a river.|$|R
60|$|Philip quickly {{reckoned}} out {{how much}} that would amount to, and his mouth watered; thirty pounds would be a godsend just <b>then,</b> and <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> the fates owed him something. He told Mildred {{what he had done}} when he saw her at breakfast next morning. She thought him very silly.|$|R
60|$|Somewhere along Theater Street he {{had lost}} it. He remembered being hustled {{somewhat}} roughly on the bridge {{over one of the}} canals that cross that busy thoroughfare. Possibly some slant-eyed, light-fingered pickpocket was even then enjoying the fifty-odd yen his purse had contained. And <b>then</b> again, <b>he</b> <b>thought,</b> <b>he</b> might have lost it himself, just lost it carelessly.|$|R
60|$|Somerset House! thought Endymion, as {{he stood}} before the fire alone. Is it so near as that? To-morrow, and I am to be at Somerset House! And <b>then</b> <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> {{of what they were}} doing at Hurstley--of that terrible parting with his mother, which made him choke--and of his father's last words. And <b>then</b> <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> of Myra, and the tears stole down his cheek. And then he knelt down by his bedside and prayed.|$|E
60|$|He made as if {{he would}} pursue the Invisible Man downstairs. <b>Then</b> <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> better of it and stepped into the dining-room.|$|E
60|$|Festing {{remarked that}} they wore jackets {{that had a}} tanned look, unusually short skirts, and thick nailed boots. <b>Then</b> <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> Helen's eyes twinkled.|$|E
60|$|<b>Then</b> Rollo <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> {{would try}} French; so he {{translated}} his question, and asked it in French.|$|R
60|$|Another {{quarter of}} an hour went by and <b>then</b> Dick <b>thought</b> <b>he</b> heard voices. He {{strained}} his ears.|$|R
6000|$|... "Ah, {{you are not}} a mother, and cannot know. Why should I {{not think}} of him when he was good and kind, honest and hardworking? And <b>then</b> <b>he</b> had <b>thought</b> of me first. Why should I not think of him? Did not mamma listen to my father when he came to her?" ...|$|R
60|$|<b>Then</b> <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> {{of crying}} {{for help and}} gave half a dozen shouts. But no answer came back, for nobody was in that vicinity.|$|E
60|$|<b>Then</b> <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> {{of cutting}} off his finger; {{but he wanted}} two things to do it with--courage and a knife; and he had got neither.|$|E
6000|$|... "Live! I {{suppose we}} could live." [...] <b>Then</b> <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> of the {{cabbages}} and the cottage at Pau. [...] "There would be seven hundred a-year I suppose." ...|$|E
5000|$|The Goodies {{are taken}} to a {{lighthouse}} for 5 years since Graeme signed them up for it, although Graeme <b>then</b> confesses that <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> the advert said [...] "A little light housekeeping".|$|R
6000|$|They talked as {{they had}} talked in old days, Sam pulling himself up now and <b>then,</b> when <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> himself too familiar.

60|$|So {{at least}} the Dean found it. First he wrote one set of words and <b>then</b> <b>he</b> sat and <b>thought</b> and wrote {{something}} else. But nothing seemed to suit.|$|R
60|$|<b>Then</b> <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> {{it would}} be foolish, and started to enter the house. But he was undecided, and at last hurried down the roadway in the {{direction}} of the river.|$|E
6000|$|<b>Then</b> <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> of {{the effect}} of this night upon her life. What would Clifford Belden do now? To what deeps would his rage descend if he should come to know of it? ...|$|E
60|$|Then Perseus {{looked down}} the cliff and shuddered; but he was ashamed to show his dread. <b>Then</b> <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> of Medusa and the renown before him, and he leaped into the empty air.|$|E
60|$|Resolved {{not to be}} beaten, {{the unfortunate}} Irishman sat down again, and again started up, but, feeling ashamed, {{suddenly}} flung himself flat on his back, held his breath, and ground his teeth together. <b>He</b> <b>thought</b> of gridirons; <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> of the rack; <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> of purgatory; <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> of the propriety of starting up and of tearing limb from limb the attendant, who, with a quiet smile, lay down beside him and shut his eyes; <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> of the impossibility of bearing it an instant longer; and <b>then</b> <b>he</b> suddenly <b>thought</b> that it felt a little easier. From this point he began to experience sensations that were slightly pleasurable, and a profuse perspiration broke out over his whole body.|$|R
60|$|All {{that day}} he sat sighing and {{thinking}} about the beautiful princess, until the evening had come. <b>Then</b> <b>he</b> suddenly <b>thought</b> of his piece of good luck. He pulled his piece of blue glass {{out of his pocket}} and breathed upon it and rubbed it with his thumb, and instantly the Genie was there.|$|R
25|$|Most of {{the reports}} in the media tended to be {{critical}} of Patriarch Kirill and laughing at the claims that the dust was harmful, saying that it was just sand {{and it would have been}} far more efficient to just hire a maid to vacuum it up. The Patriarch himself <b>then</b> said <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> it to be inappropriate to forgive Shevchenko.|$|R
