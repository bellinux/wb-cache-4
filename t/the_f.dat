5|$|In 2015, some rush-hour peak-direction F trains started {{skipping}} local stops between Jay Street and Fourth Avenue, and the MTA {{is planning}} to use expanded rush-hour express service (from Jay Street to Church Avenue) in both directions in the summers of 2016 and 2017. In May 2016, the MTA announced that half of all rush-hour F trains may start running express in both directions in fall 2017; however, because of rolling stock and track capacity limitations, the train frequency {{on the rest of}} <b>the</b> <b>F</b> route would remain the same. However, with the introduction of the R179s, one more train per hour could be run on <b>the</b> <b>F.</b> The operation of half of <b>the</b> <b>F</b> trains as express would result in operational improvements, with faster service, as southbound F trains would no longer be delayed by terminating G trains discharging at Church Avenue. Overall, <b>the</b> <b>F</b> express will result in an overall reduction of 27,000 minutes during the AM rush hour and 13,000 minutes during the PM rush hour. The change in service will decrease service at local stations, reducing in longer wait times, but it will help riders in South Brooklyn with the longest commutes. F express trains would be slightly more crowded than current F trains, but <b>the</b> <b>F</b> locals would be less crowded. PM rush hour express service would lead to much larger exit surges from less frequent F local trains at Bergen Street and Carroll Street, leading to significant congestion at one staircase at Bergen Street, and moderate congestion at one staircase at Carroll St. Relieving the congestion, would entail widening the staircases and installing ADA-required elevators that would cost approximately $10 million per station.|$|E

A number o f alternative measures o <b>f</b> <b>the</b> cost o <b>f</b> capital to Irish industry are presented.

40|$|Heads — you win; tails — I lose. ” Such is <b>the</b> message <b>the</b> <b>Fed</b> sends to bond speculators. But {{why would}} <b>the</b> <b>Fed</b> offer such a stupid wager?

40|$|The 1950 s {{are often}} cited as a decade in which the Federal Reserve {{operated}} a particularly successful monetary policy. The present paper examines the evolution of Federal Reserve monetary policy from the mid- 1930 s through the 1950 s {{in an effort to}} understand better the apparent success of policy in the 1950 s. Whereas others have debated whether <b>the</b> <b>Fed</b> had a sophisticated understanding of how to implement policy, our focus is on how the constraints on <b>the</b> <b>Fed</b> changed over time. Roosevelt Administration gold policies and New Deal legislation limited the Fed’s ability to conduct an independent monetary policy. <b>The</b> <b>Fed</b> was forced to cooperate with the Treasury in the 1930 s, and fully ceded monetary policy to Treasury financing requirements during World War II. Nonetheless, <b>the</b> <b>Fed</b> retained a policy tool in the form of reserve requirements, and from the mid- 1930 s to 1951, changes in required reserve ratios were the primary means by which <b>the</b> <b>Fed</b> responded to expected inflation. The inability of <b>the</b> <b>Fed</b> to maintain a credible commitment to low interest rates in the face of increased government spending and rising inflation led to the Fed-Treasury Accord of March 1951.
