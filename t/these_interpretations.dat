5|$|Soft tissue was {{apparently}} preserved with the specimen, but was subsequently removed during preparation. Covering the limbs {{and the rest}} of the body was a layer of smooth, multilayered calcite, which was originally interpreted as preservation of decaying skin. Additionally, an accumulation of sediment in the abdominal region may have represented gut contents, with both gastroliths and digested bones. However, since both samples of the alleged soft tissue are no longer available, it is impossible to verify <b>these</b> <b>interpretations.</b>|$|E
5|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that the Court of Appeal's judgment can be interpreted in one of two ways: that the exercise of a power is not amenable to judicial review either if it has no public element altogether, or if it has an insufficient public element. Neither of <b>these</b> <b>interpretations</b> is without complications. As regards the first interpretation, {{it may be difficult to}} conceive of an exercise of statutory power that has no public element at all. If the second interpretation is correct, there is doubt as to the level of sufficiency required for the exercise of a power to be amenable to judicial review as the Court did not explain this.|$|E

In the Nanxiong formation in Southern China, Macroolithus fossils range up to and possibly over the Cretaceous-Tertiary boundary, which is traditionally assumed to mark the extinction of the non-avian dinosaurs. Some paleontologists have interpreted the record of dinosaur eggs at this formation as supporting a gradual extinction event, rather than a sudden cataclysmic event. However, other paleontologists believe that <b>these</b> <b>interpretations</b> are merely based on artifacts of erosion and redeposition in the early Paleogene.|$|E
5|$|Samuel Adams {{later became}} a {{controversial}} figure in American history.

5|$|In rabbinical tradition, {{the age of}} Isaac at {{the time}} of binding is taken to be 37, which {{contrasts}} with common portrayals of Isaac as a child. The rabbis also thought that the reason for the death of Sarah was the news of the intended sacrifice of Isaac. The sacrifice of Isaac is cited in appeals for the mercy of God in later Jewish traditions. The post-biblical Jewish interpretations often elaborate the role of Isaac beyond the biblical description and primarily focus on Abraham's intended sacrifice of Isaac, called the aqedah ("binding"). According to a version of <b>these</b> <b>interpretations,</b> Isaac died in the sacrifice and was revived. According to many accounts of Aggadah, unlike the Bible, it is Satan who is testing Isaac as an agent of God. Isaac's willingness to follow God's command at the cost of his death has been a model for many Jews who preferred martyrdom to violation of the Jewish law.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The {{purpose of}} this article is to present a parametrised {{functional}} interpretation. Depending on the choice of the parameter relations one obtains well-known functional interpretations, such as Gödel’s Dialectica interpretation, Diller-Nahm’s variant of the Dialectica interpretation, Kohlenbach’s monotone interpretations, Kreisel’s modified realizability and Stein’s family of functional interpretations. A functional interpretation consists of a formula translation and a proof translation. We show that all <b>these</b> <b>interpretation</b> only differ on two choices: firstly, on “how much ” of the counterexamples for A became witnesses for ¬A when defining the formula translation, and, secondly, “how much ” of the witnesses of A one is interested in when defining the proof translation...|$|R

The arrangements are extremely ingenious.|$|E
25|$|Scholars have {{generally}} {{rejected the idea}} that Bradshaw art was painted by anyone other than Aboriginal people. Statistical analysis undertaken by Michael Barry has concluded that the Bradshaw art shares no stylistic attributes with prehistoric figurative art overseas. Moreover, Barry argues that stylistically, Bradshaw art has {{more in common with}} art found elsewhere in Australia, such as figures painted in Arnhem Land. Some popular historians and amateur researchers have continued to suggest exotic origins for the Bradshaw rock paintings, although <b>these</b> <b>interpretations</b> are considered fringe by reviewers.|$|E

25|$|Jonas Trinkūnas, {{the leader}} of a neo-pagan {{movement}} Romuva, believes that in the Lithuanian mythology Vytis represents Perkūnas, a god of thunder. It is believed that the Vytis may represent Perkūnas as supreme god or Kovas who was also a war god and has been depicted as a horseman since ancient times. Gintaras Beresnevičius also points out that a white horse had a sacral meaning to Balts. <b>These</b> <b>interpretations</b> coincide with one of the interpretations of the German coat of arms, that suggests an adler being the bird of Odin, a god of war, which is commonly depicted as a horserider.|$|E

40|$|We {{evaluate}} the interpretations {{that can be}} made when examining the association between accounting information and long-window stock returns. We show that the common practice of regressing long-window stock returns on earnings components, and inferring from their coefficients the appropriateness of the components for recognition, can lead to ambiguous and mis-specified results. The problem arises because of correlated omitted variables intrinsic to this approach. Using simulations, we show that the problem is more severe, the less persistent the earnings component, and the larger the sample size. An empirical example that compares two measures of core earnings is used to highlight these problems. We recommend the test described in Vuong (1989) to mitigate <b>these</b> <b>interpretation</b> problems. JEL Classification: M 4...|$|R
