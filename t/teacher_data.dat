5000|$|There {{are five}} school unit files, {{organized}} around the year of data collection. A school unit record consists of information about a school {{as the result of}} source data captured from family interviews, a classroom teacher, or the school principal. The structure of this data file is different from others in that rather than being merged on a common key, the records are actually stacked one upon the other in groups. The first part of the file consists of family data, the middle portion consists of <b>teacher</b> <b>data,</b> and the final portion consists of principal data. A key variable to the construction of this dataset is the REC_SRC (record source) variable. It informs the user as to the source of the data in the record. The abbreviations are [...] "fi," [...] "ta," [...] and [...] "qp" [...] for family interview, teacher questionnaire (Part A), and questionnaire for principals, respectively. The data viewed as the centerpiece of these datasets are the school climate survey variables and their associated factor scores.|$|E

Data were collected from 817 participants comprising both pre and in-service teachers in four phases. Two separate factor analyses were conducted for the pre-service <b>teacher</b> <b>data</b> and in-service <b>teacher</b> <b>data.</b> Principle component analysis, with varimax rotation, suggested three distinct constructs: affect, perceived usefulness and behaviour.

In addition to addressing these research questions, this study highlights the challenges for using data from cross-sectional, international comparative studies to link student outcomes with teachers’ instructional practices.|$|E

40|$|Background: High {{levels of}} {{clinical}} comorbidity {{have been reported}} between autistic spectrum disorders (ASD) and {{attention deficit hyperactivity disorder}} (ADHD). This study takes an individual differences approach to determine the degree of phenotypic and aetiological overlap between autistic traits and ADHD behaviours in the general population. Methods: The Twins Early Development Study is a community sample born in England and Wales. Families with twins born in 1994 – 6 were invited to join; 6, 771 families participated in the study when the twins were 8 years old. Parents completed the Childhood Asperger Syndrome Test and the Conners' DSM-IV subscales. <b>Teacher</b> <b>data</b> were also collected on a sub-sample. High scores on the Conners' subscales were used to identify possible ADHD cases. Potential ASD cases were interviewed using the Development and Well-Being Assessment. Multivariate structural equation model-fitting was employed, as well as DeFries Fulker extremes analysis and liability threshold model-fitting. Results: Significant correlations were found between autistic and ADHD traits in the general population (. 54 for parent data,. 51 for <b>teacher</b> <b>data).</b> In the bivariate models, all genetic correlations were >. 50, indicating a moderate degree of overlap in genetic influences on autistic and ADHD traits, both throughout the general population and at the quantitative extreme. This phenotypic and genetic overlap still held when sex, IQ and conduct problems were controlled for, for both parent and <b>teacher</b> <b>data.</b> There was also substantial overlap in suspected cases (41 % of children who met criteria for an ASD had suspected ADHD; 22 % with suspected ADHD met criteria for an ASD). Conclusions: These results suggest there are some common genetic influences operating across autistic traits and ADHD behaviours throughout normal variation and at the extreme. This is relevant for molecular genetic research, as well as for psychiatrists and psychologists, who may have assumed these two sets of behaviours are independent...|$|E

30|$|We {{could argue}} that a future teacher with a good {{understanding}} of mathematics concepts does not necessarily possess the pedagogical skills to communicate these concepts to students. Therefore, a matter of interest is whether there is a connection between mathematics and MPCK and, if so, how strong that connection is and whether the program affiliation could influence this relationship. For the analysis relating to this example, we again used future primary <b>teacher</b> <b>data</b> from the Russian Federation.|$|E

Conducting simultaneous assessments to contain cost and gather additional programmatic information can be also considered. To be more efficient with resources, the number of ERS items can be reduced while maintaining the validity and reliability of the instrument by conducting factor analysis on previous ERS assessment data.|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: Childhood {{psychopathology}} {{is associated}} with both high {{and low levels of}} prosocial behaviour. It has been proposed that the development of prosocial behaviour shows emerging and consolidating individual differences as children grow older. The influences on these individual differences have not previously been examined in children and adolescents using multiple raters in a genetically informative design. METHODS: Twin data from 682 families based on parent and teacher reports were used to examine the genetic and environmental influences on prosocial behaviour in 5 - 16 -year-olds. Effects of sex, age and rater were examined. RESULTS: There {{were no significant differences in}} the magnitude of genetic and environmental influence on male and female prosocial behaviour. Declining common environment and increasing genetic influences were seen with age. This emerged as a trend in parent data and reached statistical significance in <b>teacher</b> <b>data.</b> When parent and <b>teacher</b> <b>data</b> were examined together in a rater bias model significant bias acting on the parent ratings emerged, in keeping with previous discrepancies between parental and observational measures. There was overlap in the phenotype rated by parents and teachers, with a highly heritable common underlying phenotype. CONCLUSIONS: The influences on the distribution of prosocial behaviour in children and adolescents show declining shared environmental and increasing genetic influences with age. Parental assessments of prosocial behaviour show significantly higher scores than teacher reports and whilst there is overlap in the phenotype rated by parents and teachers, parents show significant bias in their ratings...|$|E
