40|$|This paper {{covers the}} {{planning}} process in the Midtown neighborhood of Atlanta, Georgia. Midtown is an urban neighborhood with high concentrations of office and residential development, both new and old. Recently, after a prolonged period of decline, Midtown witnessed an impressive wave of new development. The business community, working through the Midtown Alliance, its primary association, has reacted to this renewed interest by initiating a number of planning efforts. These efforts are intended to work towards a goal of creating a functionally-integrated and walkable, mixed-use urban community. While the business sector’s efforts have included impressive applications of recent new urbanist concepts, several issues arise when one analyzes the implications of their plans. The foremost problem is the Alliance’s concentration solely upon the section of Midtown that the neighborhood’s major interests dominate, thereby geographically limiting the scope of all planning-related improvements. Resultantly, the residential sections of Midtown will not receive the enhancements and development controls designed to benefit the area’s major business districts. In addition to the issues resulting from the <b>territorial</b> <b>limitation,</b> Midtown residents are also concerned the Alliance’...|$|E

Judicial {{cooperation}} in civil matters {{is an important}} area of the European integration that reflects the necessity to provide cross-border private law relations within the EU with legal certainty and judicial protection. This cooperation solves in an efficient way problems that would otherwise result from {{the differences between the}} private law systems of the individual Member States and from the independence and <b>territorial</b> <b>limitation</b> of their judicial systems. Its solution consists in the unification and harmonization in the field of the international private law. This method enables to these difficulties to be solved without the necessity o f a deeper interference with the private law systems of the Member States. Currently the area covers {{an essential part of the}} subject of the international private law, namely all its key areas - international jurisdiction, recognition and enforcement offoreign judicial decisions, determination of applicable law and legal aid among the courts throughout the Union.

40|$|An {{outcome of}} two hundred years of hegemony of the nationstates {{in the world is}} a certain type of {{blindness}} that afflicts social sciences, particularly consumer research, and leads to caveats in research designs, analysis, and interpretation. Modern nation-states combine the idea of a culturally unified nation and the idea of a sovereign state that governs it. The lack of problematization in the role of countries as containers of a national culture, often referred to as methodological nationalism, and the assumption that countries are the natural units of analysis when examining macro-cultural processes lead to a number of commonly repeated mistakes, such as naive generalizations and misinterpretation of research findings. The {{purpose of this article is}} to discuss the potential implications of methodological nationalism in consumer culture and marketing research and also to identify strategies that allow researchers to avoid or minimize the problems that stem from it. Methodological nationalism is a term coined by Martins (1974), and later used by Smith (2004) and other social scientists. It refers to the "assumption that the nation/state/society is the natural social and political form of the modern world" (Wimmer and Glick Schiller 2002, p. 301). Critics of methodological nationalism argue that it makes certain historical trends and forms of identity completely invisible. Wimmer and Glick Schiller (2002) extended the debate on methodological nationalism by explaining that it can occur in three different forms: silencing, naturalization and <b>territorial</b> <b>limitation...</b>|$|E
40|$|In September 2014 the ECJ {{issued its}} {{decision}} in C- 7 / 13 the Skandia case. The case con- cerned service transactions made between a main establishment {{in a third}} country and its Swedish branch. The branch {{was a member of}} a VAT group in Sweden. The ECJ estab- lished that the membership resulted in that the VAT group was considered as one taxable person which meant that the services was considered provided to the group itself and not the separate member. Therefore the transactions were deemed taxable. The purpose of this thesis is to analyse the ECJ’s assessment and judgment of the Skandia case, and how the decision affect art. 11 of the VAT Directive about VAT groups. The art. 11 of the VAT Directive provides a possibility for Member States of the EU to in- troduce rules that makes it possible for more than one person, if they meet certain criteria, to qualify as a single taxable person. In Sweden, these rules are implemented in chapter 6 a of the Swedish VAT Law. The rules on VAT groups have been further developed and in- terpreted by case law from the ECJ. The thesis shows that the Skandia case confirms some of the principles from previous case law, and develops new principles for the application of art. 11 of the VAT Directive. We draw the conclusion that the development of the law in relation to the ECJ's decision in the Skandia case, indicates that art. 11 of the VAT Directive should be assessed independently and not be influenced by other articles of the VAT Directive. We also believe that the Skandia case suggest that the <b>territorial</b> <b>limitation</b> of art. 11 means that a person must be physically established in a Member State to be able to be a member of a VAT group in that Member State. Finally, we draw the conclusion that the Skandia case indicates that the ECJ has taken inspiration from the international co-operation organ OECD. Such development is interesting because a correlation between these two organs would lead to a greater pre- dictability and legal certainty on an international level. ...|$|E

40|$|Third-country {{nationals}} can use regulation 1231 / 10 {{to invoke}} regulation 883 / 04, However, the <b>territorial</b> <b>limitation</b> imposed by regulation 1231 / 10 still limits third-country nationals. The main {{issue is that}} regulation 1231 / 10 is restricted to EU territory. Outside of the EU, any requirement regarding equal treatment in accordance with regulation 1231 / 10 is not applicable. Decision 3 / 80, the European Convention on Social Security, the Dutch-Turkish social security treaty and ILO Treaty 118 also consider facts outside of the EU, as demonstrated by figures of the Employee Insurance Agency and Social Insurance Bank. Relevant facts outside of the EU include for example the periods of time third-country nationals {{lived and worked in}} third countries and the export of benefits to these countries. My proposal to conclude new treaties with third countries on the EU level was discussed {{in the context of the}} four analysed coordination schemes. In the discussion, I have researched what possibilities exist to include the techniques of the involved schemes in treaties with third countries, to address those exact issues faced by third country nationals as a result of the limited territorial scope of regulation 1231 / 10. In addition to facing possible issues because the territorial scope is limited to the EU, third-country nationals also face issues from regulation 1231 / 10 resulting from the requirement that a third-country national must be in a situation which is not confined in all respects within a single EU Member State. We have seen that the analysed coordination schemes do not require the cross-border movement between at least two EU Member States before involved persons can call upon the concerned coordination schemes. With respect to these coordination schemes, it suffices that the involved persons move from one treaty country to another. This is therefore not limited to just EU Member States. There are no relevant objections for cancelling the requirement that third-country nationals as a result of regulation 1231 / 10 must be in a situation which is not confined within a single EU Member State. I have discussed the possible conditions for considering facts outside the EU. These conditions are the following: the nature and level of the benefit, the enforcement of national legislation rules, the demand for reciprocity and preventing a disruption in the labour market. These possible conditions for considering facts outside the EU were inventoried out of the coordination developments with regard to third-country nationals on both a national and EU level. The assessment of my proposal to conclude new treaties to include third countries against the relevant conditions has shown that when it comes to the coordination of social security for third-country nationals, it is possible to create a coordination scheme that is more effective than regulation 1231 / 10. The EU Member States can overcome the few disadvantageous consequences that were discussed in my proposal by establishing further measures. If EU Member States proceed with my proposed expansion, this will therefore not lead to a heavier load on financing their social security systems, and therefore would not have any significant disadvantages for EU Member States...|$|E
40|$|Sugar cane {{agriculture}} {{continues to}} exist in Okinawa based on its specific ecological conditions, that is, the humid subtropical coral islands, and its peculiar political-economic situation, that is, the peripheral area of one advanced capitalistic economy. Although {{it is one of}} the typical industries and the dominant form of resource use in Okinawa, its productivity and its technology remains at a lower level until now. It has been already more than 20 years since Okinawa was returned to Japan in 1972, but its production are fluctuating sharply year by year depending on the weather conditions, which endangers the livelihood of rural communities by fits and starts. Such a situation is more critical in the isolated islands where the sugar industry remains almost their sole source of income. Tarama Island, which is located about 350 km southwest of the main island of Okinawa: presents a good example. The sugar cane agriculture of Tarama Island from the mid- 1960 s to the mid - 1970 s is characterized by extremely low output intensity and lower technology and it experienced overall contraction and disintensification which was observed in diminishing land and labor inputs and stagnation of capital investment. Under these circumstances at the time of the 1971 severe drought the unprecedented scale of out-migration and abandonment of the cultivated land had occurred and it threatened the continued existence of the rural community of Tarama Island. From the mid- 1970 s to the mid- 1980 s the situation reversed itself and the sugar cane agriculture of Tarama Island saw the rapid increase in production based on both the external expansion in size, that is, increases in land, labor, especially of younger generation, and capital devoted to the sugar cane agriculture, and the internal intensification, that is, increases in land, labor, and capital inputs per hectare, the improvement of the cultivation techniques, and the resultant rise in the output intensity. Such a drastic change was triggered by the expansion of the crushing capacity of the sugar mill which was approved by the Japanese government, and was accelerated by the steep raise in the guaranteed price for sugar cane. However, such an evolution pattern of the sugar cane agriculture of Tarama Island came to a deadlock in the mid- 1980 s facing the <b>territorial</b> <b>limitation</b> of the island ecosystem and the reconsideration of the guaranteed price for sugar cane by the Japanese government. Now the incomplete intensification of the sugar cane agriculture of Tarama Island, that is, the insufficiency of intensive use of land, labor, and capital devoted to the sugar cane agriculture has become a big problem. As to the stagnation of output intensity, delay in the renewal of cane varieties is no doubt one of the important factors, but also it should be noted that most of the sugar cane is still grown without irrigation on Tarama Island. Without irrigation, no matter how cultivation operations are improved and intensified, only limited success can be achieved. However, the implementation of irrigation is faced with both technological and economic problems (Nagata, 1992 a). The crucial point here is that these kinds of technological innovations cannot be induced solely by the farmers'efforts. The entry into the sugar cane agriculture and the enlargement of the size of the enterprise is not so difficult because the sugar cane farming is relatively simple technically. In the case of Tarama Island the acquisition of farmland was also done smoothly through the informal social networks in the community. As a result, from the mid - 1970 s to the mid-I 980 s on Tarama Island a number of average farm households which cultivate 200 - 400 ares of farmland with sugar cane and produce 70 - 160 tons each year. As long as favorable prices for sugar cane are offered, this size of enterprise is not so bad, but once the guaranteed price for sugar cane is held down this size is too small to make a proper profit. As to the introduction of expensive machinery such as large-sized tractor, the enriched institutional financing and subsidized projects after 1972 have enabled the farmers to introduce it more easily, consequently, the farmers have tended to attach the greater importance to convenience than to efficiency and as a result to overinvest in capital equipment. On Tarama island tractors is mainly operated through the informal social networks. Practically no efforts have been done to regulate the introduction and use of expensive machinery in terms of efficiency. Early in the 1990 s the sugar cane agriculture of Tarama Island has developed into a critical condition again. Diminishing economic profitability of the sugar cane farming has brought about an outflow of labor force from the sugar cane agriculture. Especially it is applicable to the opportunistic younger generation particularly born in 1950 s who contributed to the expansion of sugar cane agriculture from the mid- 1970 s to the mid- 1980 s. The imperfect substitution of capital for labor, particularly, the existence of strenuous work of manual harvest is also one of the negative factors. When the farmers of senior generation who were born in the latter half of the 1920 s and in the first half of the 1930 s retire from the sugar cane farming, if the mechanical harvesting is not realized and some problems related to its economic profitability are not resolved properly, the sugar cane agriculture of Tarama Island is expected to see a large scale of contraction as was observed in the first half of the 1970 s...|$|E
40|$|This {{book is a}} {{study of}} the “jurisdictional gap” that existed for 40 years {{as a result of a}} United States Supreme Court {{decision}} in 1955. This decision determined that U.

Because of the <b>territorial</b> <b>limitations</b> on the jurisdiction of U. S. civilian courts, this meant that there was no court in which veteran suspects could be tried for war crimes. Consequently, numerous American citizens literally got away with murder. This article traces the legislative history of the attempts to close the jurisdictional gap from 1955 to 2000, when the U. S. Congress vested jurisdiction over such crimes and suspects in federal district courts; it assesses the reasons for the years of failure to pass remedial legislation, as well as the pressures that ultimately led to the passage of the law that plugged the jurisdictional gap; and it analyses the verdicts and implications of the first two cases in which U.

40|$|Methodological {{nationalism}} {{restricts the}} focus on transnational migrants in Europe, in particular in the Upper-Rhine border area (France-Germany-Switzerland). Three main limitations can be underlined: to start with, the ignorance of nationalism in contemporary social science research, including in migration and border studies; moreover, the naturalization of the nation- state that contributes to shape numerous social science biases; finally, <b>territorial</b> <b>limitations</b> that constrain research topics (Wimmer and Glick Schiller 2002). To overcome those issues, this research combines three methodological perspectives: first, a socio-historical analysis of transnational migrants in the Rhineland area, in order to comprehend past and contemporary dynamics; second, a socio-political approach that stresses the migrants’ “ways of being” (Glick Schiller 2005), including their activism and rhetoric, e. g. direct observations and interviews in multiple sites; third, a pluri-scalar approach that implies several levels of analysis, e. g. local, regional, cross-border, transnational and supra-national. The analysis of transnational migrants’ public action in the Rhineland Valley suggests a triple hypothesis: those transnational migrants’ activists elaborate a public discourse against a specific political and social stigmatization (Becker [1963] 1997); they also institutionalize and reinforce social movements with highly trained lawyers that defend their interests at the highest European jurisdictional level; they create empirically an original form of transnational quasi-trade unions.

C. § 1470 (2003) (transfer of obscene materials to minors) and 18 U. S. C. § 2422 (2003) (coercion and enticement). These latter statutes, however, have yet to receive significant or wide-spread recognition as having extraterritorial application.

With regard to patents, it is increasingly common for a multinational company to face alleged infringing acts committed by the same competitor in several countries. Securing international patent protection both at the acquisition and the enforcement stage is the corollary to the cross border exploitation of patents. The regulation of transnational trade and the international exploitation of patent rights have brought about international agreements concerning these closely related issues, such as international patent granting power, international harmonization of patent laws and uniform systems of jurisdiction and choice of law rules applicable to patent enforcement {{as well as other}} areas. However, there is an increasingly strained relationship between international patent acquisition and enforcement 1 which is the dominant focus of this paper. Whilst a network of international agreements facilitates the grant of increasingly similar patent rights in many countries, cross border patent enforcement through the application of the relevant private international rules has been very weak. From a private international law perspective, the legal independence and <b>territorial</b> <b>limitations</b> of patent rights has severe implications for the application of the relevant jurisdictional and choice of law rules. Therefore, cross-border adjudication has indeed been challenged in the patent area.

40|$|Producing {{large-scale}} victimization {{is one of}} {{the prime}} goals of terrorists worldwide. A regular characteristic not only of the unparalleled attacks of 9 / 11, with its more than 3, 000 direct fatalities, is to provoke maximum public attention by producing as many casualties as possible. Victims fall prone to such events due to a terrorist preference for soft and symbolic targets. Not surprisingly, victims of terrorism receive particular attention when counter-terrorism policies are formulated. In practise, however, compensation and support for those directly or indirectly affected by terrorist acts is often rather poor. This article aims to analyse (i) the situation of victims of terrorism in a theoretical victimological framework, and (ii) legislation in favour of victims of terrorism from a comparative perspective. Significant differences can be found not only within Europe where victim policies are basically EU and CoE guided but likewise in comparison with the policies in the US and Israel, which have both implemented particular legislation for victims of terrorism decades ago. This article argues for the adoption of a principled approach to compensation based on social solidarity instead of tort law rules. Further attention is drawn to a particularly unprivileged group: those individuals who become victims of terrorist threats abroad and who, {{as a consequence of the}} <b>territorial</b> <b>limitations</b> applicable to compensation rules, have no access to victim compensation schemes in their home countries...|$|R

40|$|At the {{beginning}} of the Meiji period the Tenri Sect, the Maruyama Sect, and other new religious organizations grew from local organizations known as ko, which were found in all Japanese farming communities at the time, into large religious denominations. Among them, the Tenri Sect became especially large. The author believes that this was because of features of the Tenri kō that were not shared by kō of other sects. For this reason, he considers it necessary to reexamine the religious kō from a new angle. Most of the research on kō so far has been carried on by students of folklore or sociologists rather than students of religion. The students of folklore have been interested in religious customs, and the sociologists {{in the nature of the}} organization of the kō and the mode in which they were formed. In particular, sociologists have considered the religious kō in discussions revolving around the division of society in farming communities into organizations based on the clan structure and those which do not involve blood relationships. They have not dealt in detail with the religious purposes of the ko, but really in actual society, many kō are almost completely divorced from religious purposes. In the religious ko, the members have equal rights and duties. Some kō are made up of heads of houses, while the composition of others is based on the status of their members in the family group. Japanese agricultural society is formed of kumi (associations), buraku (communities), unions of small buraku (similar to the villages of the Tokugawa period), and villages. kō exist at all levels, and the members belong to kō at all levels. The kumi and buraku ko, which are the most important, are formed by the heads of houses. Kō are concerned with both mutual aid and mutual regulations, with both recreation and duty. They try to insure the equality of members, but also represent class control. They function not only as selfgoverning bodies but as ramifications of the system maintained by the controlling class. The Tenri Sect made its ideology the central feature of its kō and at the same time developed the “parent-child principle,” i. e. the link between parent and child, which transcends <b>territorial</b> <b>limitations...</b>|$|R
40|$|This paper {{looks at}} how cities can {{function}} {{in much the}} same way as nations in the construction of political projects. Taking Pasqual Maragall's mobilization of Barcelona during his period as mayor of the city (198297) as an example, it explores how locally dependent politicians attempt to exploit 'spaces of engagement' (Cox 1998) to escape from the <b>territorial</b> and scalar <b>limitations</b> which city councils have to operate within. It argues that mayors can embody cities, and explores how Maragall located himself within a set of performatively, discursively and institutionally constructed visions of Barcelona embedded in wider economic, political and cultural spaces...|$|R
40|$|Genetic {{resources}} and associated traditional knowledge has been deemed valuable and triggered attention from both developed countries who look for resources {{to make profits}} and less developed countries who have long been using their genetic {{resources and}} associated traditional knowledge {{as a source of}} food, consumables, and cures or treatments for humans, plants, and animals. There has been an international debate in the international level on to whom legal control and ownership of genetic resources and associated traditional knowledge should belong to; whether they are a heritage from the mother earth that belong to everyone without any <b>territorial</b> <b>limitations</b> or they belong to the community of which they can be found in. The legal form that has been playing {{a major role in the}} genetic resources and traditional knowledge issue is the patent system which has provided exclusive rights to patent holders of inventions that are derived from traditional knowledge that belongs to a community from another country. The dissertation, 2 ̆ 7 How to Solve the Biopiracy Problem in Thailand by Using Traditional Knowledge as Prior Art in the Patent System 2 ̆ 7 explores and determines the causes of the problem of patenting traditional knowledge related invention by tackling the prior art subject matter in the patent law scope. The dissertation hypothesizes that inventions derived from traditional knowledge cannot be patented under any patent laws no matter in an international level or a national level because traditional knowledge has been invented, developed, accumulated, and improved through generations which makes it lack the novelty and non-obviousness quality required in the patent system. However, because the relevant international laws do not provide a hard and fast definition and interpretation of what can be constituted as prior arts but leave it up to each member country, the dissertation thus undertakes deep analyses of the relevant international treaties, the patent laws and other relevant laws of Thailand-the country of traditional knowledge misappropriations is the focus of the dissertation-and the United States which is the receiving country of traditional patent applications and determines if traditional knowledge, despite not being properly documented, can be used as prior arts to oppose a patent application. The dissertation also proposes legal approaches of how to put an end to biopiracies and traditional knowledge misappropriations in Thailand via the use of a legal framework...|$|R
