You and Nan {{have known each other}} all your lives; yet, till this last visit, you never thought you loved her more than any other childish friend. It is <b>too</b> <b>soon</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> the words so often spoken hastily,--so hard to be recalled. Go back to your work, dear, for another year; think of Nan in the light of this new hope: compare her with comelier, gayer girls; and by absence prove the truth of your belief. [...] Then, if distance only makes her dearer, if time only strengthens your affection, and no doubt of your own worthiness disturbs you, come back and offer her what any woman should be glad to take,--my boy's true heart." ...|$|E
60|$|Nor is Emerson, either, in {{the case}} of those whom the world has failed to recognise, and whom {{therefore}} it is the business of the critic to make known and to define. It is <b>too</b> <b>soon</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> in what particular niche among the teachers of the race posterity will place him; enough that in our own generation he has already been accepted as one of the wise masters, who, being called to high thinking for generous ends, did not fall below his vocation, but, steadfastly pursuing the pure search for truth, without propounding a system or founding a school or cumbering himself overmuch about applications, lived the life of the spirit, and breathed into other men a strong desire after the right governance of the soul. All this is generally realised and understood, and men may now be left to find their way to the Emersonian doctrine without the critic's prompting. Though it is only the other day that Emerson walked the earth and was alive and among us, he is already one of the privileged few whom the reader approaches in the mood of settled respect, and whose names have surrounded themselves with an atmosphere of religion.|$|E

6000|$|This was too much--he was the mocking fiend. Paul {{turned from}} {{him with a}} mere nod for good-night and the sense in a sore heart that he might come back {{to him and his}} easy grace, his fine way of {{arranging}} things, some time in the far future, but couldn't fraternise with him now. It was necessary to his soreness to believe for the hour in the intensity of his grievance--all the more cruel for its not being a legal one. It was doubtless in the attitude of hugging this wrong that he descended the stairs without taking leave of Miss Fancourt, who hadn't been in view at the moment he quitted the room. He was glad to get out into the honest dusky unsophisticating night, to move fast, to take his way home on foot. He walked a long time, going astray, paying no attention. He was thinking of too many other things. His steps recovered their direction, however, {{and at the end of}} an hour he found himself before his door in the small inexpensive empty street. He lingered, questioning himself still before going in, with nothing around and above him but moonless blackness, a bad lamp or two and a few far-away dim stars. To these last faint features he raised his eyes; he had been saying to himself that he should have been [...] "sold" [...] indeed, diabolically sold, if now, on his new foundation, at the end of a year, St. George were to put forth something of his prime quality--something of the type of [...] "Shadowmere" [...] and finer than his finest. Greatly as he admired his talent Paul literally hoped such an incident wouldn't occur; it seemed to him just then that he shouldn't be able to bear it. His late adviser's words were still in his ears--"You're very strong, wonderfully strong." [...] Was he really? Certainly he would have to be, and it might a little serve for revenge. Is he? the reader may ask in turn, if his interest has followed the perplexed young man so far. The best answer to that perhaps is that he's doing his best, but that it's <b>too</b> <b>soon</b> <b>to</b> <b>say.</b> When the new book came out in the autumn Mr. and Mrs. St. George found it really magnificent. The former still has published nothing but Paul doesn't even yet feel safe. I may say for him, however, that if this event were to occur he would really be the very first to appreciate it: which is perhaps a proof that the Master was essentially right and that Nature had dedicated him to intellectual, not to personal passion.|$|E
6000|$|... ...I {{have been}} both very busy and very bent on getting away this year without fail, for a miracle, from the oppressive London season. I have just {{accomplished}} it; I passed the St. Gotthard day before yesterday, and I {{hope to find}} it possible to remain absent till August 1st. After that I am ready to pay cheerfully and cheaply for my journey by staying quietly in town for August and September, in {{the conditions in which}} you saw me last year. I shall take as much as possible of a holiday, for I have been working carefully, consecutively and unbrokenly {{for a very long time}} past--turning out one thing (always [...] "highly finished") after another. However, I like to work, thank heaven, and at the end of a month's privation of it I sink into gloom and discomfort--so that I shall probably not wholly [...] "neglect my pen".... I hope you will have received promptly a copy of The Tragic Muse, though I am afraid I sent my list to the publishers a little late. I don't in the least know, however, when the book is supposed to come out. I have no opinion or feeling about it now--though I took long and patient and careful trouble (which no creature will recognise) with it at the time: too much, no doubt: for my mind is now a muddled, wearied blank on the subject. I have shed and ejected it--it's void and dead--and my feeling as to what may become of it is reduced to the sordid hope it will make a little money--which it won't.... The matter you expressed a friendly hope about the success of, and which for all sorts of reasons I desire to be extremely secret, silent and mysterious about--I mean the enterprise I covertly mentioned to you as conceived by me with a religious and deliberate view of gain over a greater scale than the Book (my Books at least) can ever approach bringing in to me: this matter is on a good and promising footing, but it is <b>too</b> <b>soon</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> anything about it, save that I am embarked in it seriously and with rather remarkably good omens. By which I mean that it is not to depend on a single attempt, but on half a dozen of the most resolute and scientific character, which I find I am abundantly capable of making, but which, alas, in the light of this discovery, I become conscious that I ought to have made ten years ago. I was then discouraged all round, while a single word of encouragement would have made the difference. Now it is late. But on the other hand the thing would have been then only an experiment more or less like another--whereas now it's an absolute necessity, imposing itself without choice if I wish a loaf on the shelf for my old age. Fortunately as far as it's gone it announces itself well--but I can't tell you yet how far that is. The only thing is to do a great lot.|$|E

5000|$|The 2002-03 {{season was}} one to forget for Giggs. He {{was forced to}} defend his poor form, insisting {{that he was not}} finished.

[...] A week later, on 24 February, Manchester United chief executive Peter Kenyon refused to rule out the possibility of Giggs leaving Old Trafford, saying: [...] "It's <b>too</b> <b>soon</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> whether we would even consider a bid, and all we want to do at the moment is concentrate on this season." [...] It was further claimed that a rift in the dressing room was contributing towards Giggs' possible departure. However, the following day, Giggs played one of his most memorable games, in a 3-0 victory against Juventus. After coming on as a substitute for Diego Forlán in the eighth minute, Giggs scored twice, including a goal that would later be heralded as one of his greatest goals and one of his finest Champions League moments.|$|E

5000|$|Stephen Thomas Erlewine of Allmusic {{stated that}} the album is one of Rimes' [...] "better records". He {{continued}} by stating [...] "When she's not collaborating, Rimes demonstrates excellent taste in cover material -- she records Missy Higgins' [...] "Where I Stood," [...] kicks up dust on Liz Rose/Chris Stapleton/Morgane Hayes' rockabilly raver [...] "You Ain't Right," [...] and gets down and dirty on Buddy & Julie Miller's [...] "Gasoline and Matches," [...] trading verses with Rob Thomas then letting Jeff Beck run wild—which gives the record dimension if not a singular momentum." [...] Erlewine concluded by stating that Rimes' label, Curb Records, [...] "isn't banking on its success—but that's {{one of the reasons}} it's satisfying: all the loose ends, the deliberate detours into sounds both old and new, illustrate Rimes' range and her skill, as she never sounds uneasy in any of these settings. It's not perfect—it's too long, its sequencing is haphazard—and yet all the music on Spitfire resonates, every song suggesting an avenue Rimes could pursue the next time out." [...] Erlewine gave the album four out of five stars. At Country Weekly, Jon Freeman wrote that [...] "unlike most of us, she's also a damn good country singer. On her new album, Spitfire, LeAnn attempts to wade through some of what's happened in her life over the last three years—the highs and lows and the stuff in between. With that in mind, Spitfire is not all pretty or comfortable." [...] Daryl Addison of Great American Country praised the album by stating Rimes [...] "delivers a fascinating look at her own hard lessons with one of the year's most honest and revealing releases." [...] Billy Dukes of Taste of Country noted how [...] "Spitfire is a fascinating album, and at times one feels like a voyeur listening to it. It's like breaking into your sister's dresser drawer and finding her diary, but high-quality songwriting keeps it from resembling a childish tabloid." [...] At USA Today, Brian Mansfield affirmed that [...] "Rimes has been making records since she was 12 but finds her genuine voice here, at 30, with songs so honest and vulnerable they'll provide her haters fresh ammunition. As fine and true as any country album released this year." [...] Michael McCall from the Associated Press gave the album three out of three stars and wrote a positive review stating that out of all the albums released throughout Rimes' career that Spitfire [...] "tops them all." [...] and continued by stating [...] "Rimes displays a newfound subtlety in her strong voice on several songs, effectively using phrasing and shifts in tone to express complex feelings that sound as if they come from real experience. It’s <b>too</b> <b>soon</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> Rimes has finally found a direction that can carry her back {{to the top of the}} charts, but Spitfire does show she’s found her adult voice — as a songwriter as well as a singer." ...|$|E
