5|$|In January 1961, {{as part of}} {{the process}} of decolonisation, the island's British {{authorities}} drew up constituencies and held democratic elections. Both <b>the</b> <b>ASP</b> and the ZNP won 11 of the available 22 seats in Zanzibar's Parliament, so further elections were held in June with the number of seats increased to 23. The ZNP entered into a coalition with the Zanzibar and Pemba People's Party (ZPPP) and this time took 13 seats, while <b>the</b> <b>ASP,</b> despite receiving the most votes, won just 10. Electoral fraud was suspected by <b>the</b> <b>ASP</b> and civil disorder broke out, resulting in 68 deaths. To maintain control, the coalition government banned the more radical opposition parties, filled the civil service with its own appointees, and politicised the police.|$|E
5|$|Rising electoral {{success was}} {{accompanied}} by factional in-fighting, with a leadership contest emerging in <b>the</b> <b>ASP</b> between the incumbent Alejo Véliz and Morales, who had the electoral backing of the social movement's bases. The conflict led to a schism, with Morales and his supporters splitting to form their own party, the Political Instrument for the Sovereignty of the Peoples (Instrumento Político por la Soberanía de los Pueblos – IPSP). The movement's bases defected en masse to the IPSP, leaving <b>the</b> <b>ASP</b> to crumble and Véliz to join the centre-right New Republican Force (Nueva Fuerza Republicana – NFR), for which Morales denounced him as a traitor to the cocalero cause. Continuing his activism, in 1998 Morales led another cocalero march from El Chapare to la Paz, and came under increasing criticism from the government, who repeatedly {{accused him of being}} involved in the cocaine trade and mocked him for how he spoke and his lack of education.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} other {{characters}} in Little Annie Fanny are derived from Gray's Little Orphan Annie. Sugardaddy Bigbucks, Annie's surrogate father and a powerful, manipulative capitalist, is based on Daddy Warbucks. His mysterious assistant, the Wasp, derives from Warbucks' assistant <b>the</b> <b>Asp,</b> and Punchjab, his bodyguard, comes from the character Punjab. Other supporting characters include ad man Benton Battbarton (whose name is taken from the advertising agencies Batten, Barton, Durstine & Osborn and Benton & Bowles), Battbarton's rival Huck Buxton (modeled on gap-toothed British actor Terry-Thomas), Duncan Fyfe Hepplewhite (an art plagiarist), and Freddie Flink (who resembles comic actor Fred Gwynne from Car 54, Where Are You?).|$|E

40|$|GspB is a serine-rich {{glycoprotein}} adhesin of Streptococcus gordonii that is {{exported to}} the bacterial surface by the accessory Sec system. This dedicated export pathway {{is comprised of}} seven components (SecA 2, SecY 2, and five accessory Sec proteins [Asp 1 to <b>Asp</b> 5]). <b>The</b> latter proteins have no known homologs beyond <b>the</b> <b>Asps</b> of other species. Asp 1 to Asp 3 are absolutely required for export of the substrate GspB, but their roles in this process are unknown. Using copurification analysis and far-Western blotting, we found that Asp 2 and Asp 3 could individually bind the serine-rich repeat (SRR) domains of GspB. Deletion of both SRR regions of GspB led to a decrease in its export, suggesting that binding of <b>the</b> <b>Asps</b> to <b>the</b> SRR regions is important for GspB transport by the accessory Sec system. <b>The</b> <b>Asps</b> also bound a heterologous substrate for the accessory Sec system containing a slow-folding MalE variant, {{but they did not}} bind wild-type MalE. The combined results indicate that <b>the</b> <b>Asps</b> may recognize <b>the</b> export substrate through preferential interactions with its unstructured or unfolded regions. Glycosylation of the SRR domains on GspB prevented Asp binding, suggesting that binding of <b>the</b> <b>Asps</b> to <b>the</b> preprotein occurs prior to its full glycosylation. Together, these findings suggest that Asp 2 and Asp 3 are likely to function in part as chaperones in the early phase of GspB transport...|$|R

5|$|In 1959, {{a charismatic}} Ugandan named John Okello arrived in Pemba, {{working as a}} {{bricklayer}} and in February 1963 moved to Zanzibar. Working as an official in the Zanzibar and Pemba Paint Workers' Union and as an activist in <b>the</b> <b>ASP,</b> Okello had built himself a following and almost from the moment that he arrived on Zanzibar had been organizing a revolution {{that he planned to}} take place shortly after independence. Okello and his followers had built up secret stockpiles of weapons and made plans to seize key government buildings.|$|E
5|$|The {{second most}} studied triad is the Cysteine-Histidine-Aspartate motif. Several {{families}} of cysteine proteases use this triad set, for example TEV protease and papain. The triad acts similarly to serine protease triads, {{with a few}} notable differences. Due to cysteine's low pKa, the importance of <b>the</b> <b>Asp</b> to catalysis varies and several cysteine proteases are effectively Cys-His dyads (e.g. hepatitis A virus protease), whilst in others the cysteine is already deprotonated before catalysis begins (e.g. papain). This triad is also used by some amidases, such as N-glycanase to hydrolyse non-peptide C-N bonds.|$|E
5|$|It {{was in this}} {{environment}} that the ideology of Ba'athism came into being. The Arab Ba'ath Movement was established by Michel Aflaq and Salah al-Din al-Bitar in the 1940s, others who played a notable role {{in the early stages}} of the Ba'athist movement were Zaki al-Arsuzi, Wahib al-Ghanim and Jallal al-Sayyid. Akram al-Hawrani founded the Arab Socialist Party (ASP) in 1953 – the Ba'ath Party was established through a merger of <b>the</b> <b>ASP</b> and the Arab Ba'ath Party. Of the 150 delegates to the founding congress of the Arab Ba'ath Party in 1947, the majority were either middle-class professionals or intellectuals. By the 1950s the party had managed to acquire an urban middle class base. However, the Ba'ath Party was not a purely middle class party, and from the very beginning, it sent party cadres to rural areas to recruit new members and form new party organisations. In 1956, the Ba'ath Party organized the first labour protest in Syrian history. While the Ba'ath Party was strong, its decision to recruit members from across society led to tribalism and clientelism within the party. Party leaders then opted to overlook democratic norms and procedures.|$|E

25|$|Some {{aspects of}} the films also carry over into Benson's continuation. M, for instance, is not Sir Miles Messervy, but the female M that was first {{introduced}} in the film GoldenEye (1995), although Gardner also introduced this character in his novelisation of that film and retained the character through his final novel COLD (1996). Bond also reverts to using his trusty Walther PPK, claiming he had switched to other guns (notably <b>the</b> <b>ASP</b> in Gardner's later novels), but {{felt that it was}} time he used it again. The follow-up to Zero Minus Ten, the novelization to Tomorrow Never Dies has Bond switching to the Walther P99. This remains Bond's main weapon throughout Benson's novels. Later novels by Benson also attempt to insert some of the characters from the films into his story. In The Facts of Death, for instance, Admiral Hargreaves is present at a party.|$|E
25|$|The {{waters of}} the park are among Sweden's richest, which can be {{explained}} by a great number of factors, such as their optimal acidity, a great richness of nutrients, or even, among other things, the zones of rapids alternating with calmer zones. These waters permit the park have not only a great number of species, but also a great number of individual fish and certain fish of enormous size. Among the species present, one can name several species of cyprinids (the family of carp, minnows, barbs, barbels, and others), of which in particular <b>the</b> <b>asp,</b> rare in Sweden. The waters abound also with northern pike, with specimens weighing sometimes , with European perch, with zander, and with grayling — which species is classified as endangered in Sweden, much like the brown trout. The Atlantic salmon was also present in the park's waters, but the dams downstream have considerably reduced its possibilities of rejoining the park. The noble crayfish, a species endangered worldwide, was relatively common in the {{waters of the}} Dalälven, but has now almost disappeared; some catches in the park are however reported from time to time.|$|E

500|$|According to the {{official}} Zanzibari history, the revolution was planned and headed by <b>the</b> <b>ASP</b> leader Abeid Amani Karume. However, at the time Karume was on the African mainland as {{was the leader of}} the banned Umma Party, Abdulrahman Muhammad Babu. <b>The</b> <b>ASP</b> branch secretary for Pemba, Ugandan-born ex-policeman John Okello, had sent Karume to the mainland to ensure his safety. Okello had arrived in Zanzibar from Kenya in 1959, claiming to have been a field marshal for the Kenyan rebels during the Mau Mau Uprising, although he actually had no military experience. He maintained that he heard a voice commanding him, as a Christian, to free the Zanzibari people from the Muslim Arabs, and it was Okello who led the revolutionaries—mainly unemployed members of the Afro-Shirazi Youth League—on 12 January. One commentator has further speculated that it was probably Okello, with the Youth League, who planned the revolution. There appears to have been three different plots to overthrow the government, led by Karume, Babu and Okello, of which the latter was the most advanced and it was he who struck the blow that brought down the Sultan's regime. Okello was not widely known in Zanzibar, and the government was more concerned with monitoring <b>the</b> <b>ASP</b> and Umma rather a little-known and barely literate house painter and minor union official. Okello was a complete mystery to the world {{at the time of the}} revolution, and MI5 reported to Whitehall that he was an ex-policeman who fought with the Mau Mau in Kenya and had been trained in Cuba in the art of revolutionary violence. Okello himself at a press conference several days later angrily denied having ever been to Cuba or China, stating that he was a Christian whose motto was [...] "Everything can be learned from the Bible".|$|E
500|$|Bolivia's National Electoral Court (Corte Nacional Electoral – CNE) {{refused to}} {{recognize}} <b>the</b> <b>ASP,</b> citing minor procedural infringements. The coca activists circumvented {{this problem by}} running {{under the banner of}} the United Left (IU), a coalition of leftist parties headed by the Communist Party of Bolivia (Partido Comunista Boliviano – PCB). They won landslide victories in those areas which were local strongholds of the movement, producing 11 mayors and 49 municipal councilors. Morales was elected to the National Congress as a representative for El Chapare, having secured 70.1% of the local vote. In the national elections of 1997, the IU/ASP gained four seats in Congress, obtaining 3.7% of the national vote, with this rising to 17.5% in the department of Cochabamba. The election resulted in the establishment of a coalition government led by the right-wing Nationalist Democratic Action (Acción Democrática Nacionalista – ADN), with Hugo Banzer as President; Morales lambasted him as [...] "the worst politician in Bolivian history".|$|E
500|$|A Revolutionary Council was {{established}} by <b>the</b> <b>ASP</b> and Umma parties {{to act as an}} interim government, with Karume heading the council as President and Babu serving as the Minister of External Affairs. The country was renamed the People's Republic of Zanzibar and Pemba; the new government's first acts were to permanently banish the Sultan and to ban the ZNP and ZPPP. Seeking to distance himself from the volatile Okello, Karume quietly sidelined him from the political scene, although he was allowed to retain his self-bestowed title of field marshal. However, Okello's revolutionaries soon began reprisals against the Arab and Asian population of Unguja, carrying out beatings, rapes, murders, and attacks on property. He claimed in radio speeches to have killed or imprisoned tens of thousands of his [...] "enemies and stooges", but actual {{estimates of the number of}} deaths vary greatly, from [...] "hundreds" [...] to 20,000. Some Western newspapers give figures of 2,000–4,000; the higher numbers may be inflated by Okello's own broadcasts and exaggerated reports in some Western and Arab news media. The killing of Arab prisoners and their burial in mass graves was documented by an Italian film crew, filming from a helicopter, for Africa Addio and this sequence of film comprises the only known visual document of the killings. Many Arabs fled to safety in Oman, although by Okello's order no Europeans were harmed. The post-revolution violence did not spread to Pemba.|$|E
