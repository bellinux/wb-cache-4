The transition itself can only be illustrated and corroborated by transitional fossils, which will never demonstrate an exact half-way point.|$|E

The first steamboat on the Missouri was the Independence, which started running between St. Louis and Keytesville, Missouri around 1819. By the 1830s, large mail and freight-carrying vessels were running regularly between Kansas City and St. Louis, and many traveled even farther upstream. A handful, such as the Western Engineer and the Yellowstone, were able to make it up the river as far as eastern Montana.|$|R

60|$|Deigning no reply, Bickley {{walked away}} to fetch some fine fish {{which had been}} washed up by the tidal wave and were still {{flapping}} about in a little pool of salt water.

This done, by the aid of the tools that were in the storerooms, Bickley, who was an excellent carpenter, repaired the saloon door, all that was necessary to keep us private, as the bulkhead still remained.|$|R
60|$|This sally {{produced}} a hearty laugh, which rarely fails to establish momentary good fellowship.

60|$|It was {{not easy}} to recover this shock and make the visit unrestrained, even though Fanny had not been, under <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>of</b> <b>circumstances,</b> the least trifle in the way. In such further {{communication}} as passed among them before the sisters took their departure, Little Dorrit fancied it was revealed to her that Mr Gowan treated his wife, even in his very fondness, too much like a beautiful child. He seemed so unsuspicious of the depths of feeling which she knew must lie below that surface, that she doubted if there could be any such depths in himself. She wondered whether his want of earnestness might be the natural result of his want of such qualities, and whether it was with people as with ships, that, in too shallow and rocky waters, their anchors had no hold, and they drifted anywhere.|$|E
60|$|The Briton {{had come}} out of the Cove of Cork, only a few days before, and was bound on service, with orders to run off to the westward, a few hundred miles, and to cruise three months in a {{latitude}} that might cover the homeward-bound running ships, from the American provinces, of which there were many in that early period of the war. This was not agreeable news to us, who had hoped to be landed somewhere immediately, and who had thought, at first, on seeing the ship carrying a press of sail to the westward that she might be going to Halifax. There was no remedy, however, and we were fain to make <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>of</b> <b>circumstances.</b> Captain Rowley promised to put us on board the first vessel that offered, and that was as much as we had a right, to ask of him.|$|E

50|$|Wang {{a native}} Kaifeng, was {{captured}} by the Kitans in 1003 {{at the battle of}} Wang-Tu. The Kitan emperor awarded Wang with official rank in the Kitan bureaucracy. Wang made <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>of</b> his <b>circumstances</b> and spoke with the Kitans of the advantage of resolving their conflict with the Sung peacefully. The dowager empress Ch'eng-t'ien, who was in actual control of the Kitan state at the time, had grown tired of war, and she listened to Wang's proposals. With the Liao empress dowager’s approval, Wang submitted a memorial to the Sung emperor through the Sung prefect of Mochou, stating that the Liao court wished to restore friendly relations. So, Wang facilitated the first talks of peace between the two empires. He had inside information for both of the empires so he knew exactly what each of them wanted in return for peace so he proposed exactly that to both sides. In the end it was Wang who persuaded the empress to give up on her land claims which ultimately lead to the treaty of Shan-Yuan.|$|R

He felt, with a throe of helpless sympathy, that she was undertaking too much. It was hazardous enough to attempt the practice of her novel profession under <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>of</b> <b>circumstances,</b> but to keep herself in abeyance so far as not to be known at all in it, and, at the same time, to give way to her interest in it to the extent of coming out, with her infirmly established health, into that wintry weather, and superintending the preparations for the first folly she had planned, was a risk altogether too great for her.|$|E
60|$|The {{singular}} felicity, {{with which}} Ishmael had contrived {{to shift the}} responsibility of all that had passed, from his own shoulders to those of his prisoners, backed as it was by circumstances that hardly admitted of a very philosophical examination of any mooted point in ethics, was sufficiently embarrassing to the several individuals, who were so unexpectedly required to answer for a conduct which, in their simplicity, they had deemed so meritorious. The life of Obed had been so purely theoretic, that his amazement was not the least embarrassing at a state of things which might not have proved so very remarkable had he been a little more practised {{in the ways of}} the world. The worthy naturalist was not the first by many, who found himself, at the precise moment when he was expecting praise, suddenly arraigned, to answer for the very conduct on which he rested all his claims to commendation.

60|$|It {{would be}} a poor service to spread culture, if this be its result, among the {{comparatively}} innocent and cheerful ranks of men. When our little poets have {{to be sent to}} look at the ploughman and learn wisdom, we must be careful how we tamper with our ploughmen. Where a man in not <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>of</b> <b>circumstances</b> preserves composure of mind, and relishes ale and tobacco, and his wife and children, in the intervals of dull and unremunerative labour; where a man in this predicament can afford a lesson by the way to what are called his intellectual superiors, there is plainly something to be lost, as well as something to be gained, by teaching him to think differently. It is better to leave him as he is than to teach him whining. It is better that he should go without the cheerful lights of culture, if cheerless doubt and paralysing sentimentalism are to be the consequence. Let us, by all means, fight against that hide-bound stolidity of sensation and sluggishness of mind which blurs and decolorises for poor natures the wonderful pageant of consciousness; let us teach people, as much as we can, to enjoy, and they will learn for themselves to sympathise; but let us see to it, above all, that we give these lessons in a brave, vivacious note, and build the man up in courage while we demolish its substitute, indifference.|$|E

40|$|Multispectral imaging {{has been}} studied {{in recent years as}} a means of {{assessing}} fruit firmness. Here we report on the development of a static multispectral imaging system (MSI) that was used to validate the potential of the technique for high-speed commercial grading. The system consists of a high-performance CMOS camera, four lasers, electronically controlled shutters and a location control system. It captures four spectral scattering images on the fruit. In this study 100 ‘Royal Gala’ apples have been measured using the static MSI. The MSI measurements were applied on the intact apple and also on a flat surface of internal flesh exposed by removing a thick skin slice. The scattering profiles were fitted with a standard light diffusion model and a heuristic modified Lorentzian model. The results showed that the correlations between penetrometer firmness and model parameters were poor, with the correlation coefficient, R, ranging from 0. 4 to 0. 8 in <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>circumstance</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> flat surface measurements.

40|$|This article {{concentrates}} on production and consumption, particularly {{of food and}} textiles, and the contribution of such processes and bodily action to feeling at home, for the highly heterogeneous population of Karenni refugees from Burma living in camps on the Thai border. Looking at eating, weaving and wearing, I examine the implications and associations of the production and consumption processes and their similarities and differences with pre-exile life. I argue that an investigation into sensory aspects of such issues can illuminate {{how it feels to}} be a refugee, in a physical sense: to be out of one's familiar place and ecology, seeking actively to bring about a sense of being ‘at home’ in the exiled context of a border camp. Being displaced inevitably alters forced migrants' connections with the physical world of places, objects and other people of which they are a part. To focus on this aspect of forced migration, rather than following the more usual emphases on causes, protection and assistance, or psychosocial impacts, facilitates exploration of the fundamentally cultural processes through which refugees make meaning out of the rupture they have experienced. It is an approach that demonstrates local agency and makes it clear that refugees are not passive victims, but active agents working hard to make <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>of</b> their <b>circumstances.</b> For <b>the</b> Karenni as for other displaced and non-displaced peoples alike, an important part of feeling ‘at home’ is the cultivation of a sense of spatiotemporal continuity of place and of emplacement. Yet real, physical continuity of place is impossible for refugees: the camp is not and never will be the place whence they have come. I demonstrate that refugees make considerable efforts {{to create a sense of}} purpose and home in displacement, and that embodied knowledge and the opportunity for its repeated enactment, and especially, sensory experience, are central components in this. While the camp is in some ways perpetually becoming more like home, it will never quite be it. Nonetheless, repeated and active engagement in the present with the objects and actions of the past, are in a refugee setting particularly powerful and dynamic in forming and re-forming connections with the pre-exile past.
