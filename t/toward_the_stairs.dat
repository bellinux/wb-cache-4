60|$|With {{cautious}} steps Leo {{left the}} kitchen and walked <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> <b>stairs</b> leading to the next floor.|$|E
6000|$|... "Come," [...] said Kantos Kan, [...] "we will escort John Carter and {{his party}} to his own palace," [...] and they formed about us and started <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> <b>stairs</b> leading to the Aisle of Hope.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes; the {{explanation}} {{would then have}} been obvious; but what I saw suggests something graver. Dick went away, looking relieved; but Williamson moved <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> <b>stairs</b> and then turned back, and a few moments afterward Staffer came in. He said, 'So you have seen him!'" ...|$|E
60|$|Tom and Sam {{had been}} in the dark hallway but two minutes when the door of Mumps' {{dormitory}} opened and the sneak came out, wearing his slippers and his long overcoat. He glided swiftly <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> side <b>stairs</b> leading to Captain Putnam's private apartments.|$|R
60|$|For ten {{or fifteen}} minutes nothing {{occurred}} to disturb Sam, {{and he was just}} beginning to think that watching was all nonsense when he saw a dark figure creeping along the wall at the extreme lower end of the hallway, where it made a turn <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> back <b>stairs.</b>|$|R
50|$|Within the first-floor {{room of the}} cabin, {{there is}} a {{fireplace}} at the west end. The fireplace has a solid brick mantel and a small brick firebox. At {{the opposite end of}} the room, immediately adjacent to the primary, south entrance, there is a dog-leg stair with two steps rising to shallow landing <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> loft. <b>The</b> <b>stair</b> indicates mild repairs but is primarily in its original condition.|$|R
60|$|Further {{discussion}} {{of the young woman}} was discouraged by a repetition of the clanking of the chain without. Now it was receding along the hallway <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> <b>stairs</b> and presently, to the infinite relief of The Oskaloosa Kid, the two heard it descending to the lower floor.|$|E
60|$|Jimmy {{had gone}} up to his room {{to put on the}} costume he was to wear in the first act at about the time when Spennie was being seized upon by Charteris to act as prompter. As he moved <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> <b>stairs,</b> a square-cut figure appeared.|$|E
6000|$|His hands, {{that seemed}} to have no power or purpose, touched her cheeks, {{mechanically}} caressing. More than disgust, she felt that awful pity. Putting her arm round his waist, she moved with him <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> <b>stairs.</b> If only no one heard; if only she could get him quietly up! And she murmured: ...|$|E
50|$|West of Hartshorne US-270 splits {{off from}} SH-1 and it {{continues}} east concurrent with SH-63. For 6 mi SH-1 and SH-63 overlap State Highway 2. Here the road continues east and becomes even more hilly and curvy as it heads <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> Winding <b>Stair</b> Mountains. From this point forward, the road contains {{a large number of}} hairpin turns - some even as drastic as 180-degrees. At Talihina SH-63 splits off to the south and US-271 merges on to the highway for 8 mi.|$|R
60|$|Bridge stepped quickly {{down the}} {{remaining}} steps, entered the rear room which {{had served as}} dining room and kitchen, inspected the two small bedrooms off this room, and the summer kitchen beyond. All were empty; {{then he turned and}} re-entering the front room bent his steps <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> cellar <b>stairs.</b> At <b>the</b> foot of the stairway leading to the second floor lay the flash lamp that the boy had dropped the night before. Bridge stooped, picked it up and examined it. It was uninjured and with it in his hand he continued <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> cellar door.|$|R
6000|$|The {{next day}} two pale-looking men, in artisan costume, {{came up to}} the gate {{at the same time as}} I did, each {{carrying}} a long wooden box under his arm, strongly bound with iron. I tried to make them talk while we were waiting for admission, but neither of them would go beyond [...] "Yes," [...] or [...] "No"; and both had, to my eyes, some unmistakably sinister lines in their faces. The next day the houskeeping cook came to the door--a buxom old woman with a look and a ready smile, and something in her manner which suggested that she had not begun life quite so respectably as she was now ending it. She seemed to be decidedly satisfied with my personal appearance; talked to me on indifferent matters with great glibness; but suddenly became silent and diplomatic the moment I looked <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> <b>stair</b> and asked innocently if she had to go up and down them often in the course of the day. As for the doctor himself he was unapproachable on the subject of the mysterious upper regions. If I introduced chemistry in general into the conversation he begged me not to spoil his happy holiday hours with his daughter and me, by leading him back to his work-a-day thoughts. If I referred to his own experiments in particular he always made a joke about being afraid of my chemical knowledge, and of my wishing to anticipate him in his discoveries. In brief, after a week's run of the lower regions, the upper part of the red-brick house and the actual nature of its owner's occupations still remained impenetrable mysteries to me, pry, ponder, and question as I might.|$|R
60|$|As he expected, {{the door}} on the side porch was locked, and he went around to the dining-room and entered like a burglar through a window. As he crossed the wide hall, walking softly <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> <b>stairs,</b> his father came out of the library. The {{surprise}} was mutual, and each halted aghast.|$|E
6000|$|She whirled away <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> <b>stairs,</b> but {{her father}} caught her by the arm. [...] "Marcia!" [...] he shouted, in his old raucous voice, [...] "You've got to understand! This"--he hesitated, as if running over all terms of opprobrium in his mind, and he resumed {{as if he had}} found them each too feeble--"Bartley hasn't acted under any mistake." ...|$|E
60|$|While thus {{chained to}} my seat, {{something}} seemed suddenly flung open; a confused sound of imprecations, {{mixed with the}} ivory rattling, louder than before, burst upon my ear, and through the partly {{open door of the}} room where I was, I caught sight of a tall, frantic man, with clenched hands, wildly darting through the passage, <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> <b>stairs.</b>|$|E
30|$|When the {{lowermost}} {{contact point}} separates completely {{from the edge}} of <b>the</b> <b>stairs,</b> <b>the</b> projecting point of the centroid is located more <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> rear of the robot than at the rotation center.|$|R
6000|$|... "I think I'll go {{back with}} the boys," [...] he said, making another step <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> top of <b>the</b> <b>stairs,</b> down which <b>the</b> man from the pilot-boat was hurrying.|$|R
6000|$|... "Found it expensive, didn't you?" [...] Lisle suggested; and as {{they reached}} the foot of <b>the</b> <b>stairs</b> he led his {{companion}} <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> door. [...] "Suppose we take a turn along the terrace before we look for your sister." ...|$|R
60|$|This {{unexpected}} {{coming of}} Jeff sent the young second mate {{and the old}} tar flat on Captain Ponsberry, and for the moment there was a struggle all around. In the meantime some sailors on the deck began to drag a heavy hatch <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> <b>stairs.</b> Soon this was placed in position, and then those below were virtually prisoners.|$|E
60|$|I obeyed him, and in {{an instant}} he had entered a similar one. We were {{scarcely}} there before I {{heard the sound of}} a key in the door. Through a chink in the curtain I saw Miss Blanche. She pushed back the latch and stood for a moment as though listening, her face turned <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> <b>stairs</b> up which she had come.|$|E
60|$|The amateur cracksman {{handed over}} his loot, and retired <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> <b>stairs.</b> Molly {{could hear him}} going down them three at a time, in a whirl of relief and good resolutions. She went to Sir Thomas' room, and {{replaced}} the notes. Having done this, she could not {{resist the temptation to}} examine herself in the glass for a few moments. Then she turned away, switched off the light, and was just about to leave the room when a soft footstep in the passage outside came to her ears.|$|E
50|$|Whoever {{the ghost}} on <b>the</b> <b>stairs</b> is, {{he may not}} be alone. The only recent {{incidents}} of a possibly supernatural origin have all taken place on or near <b>the</b> <b>stairs.</b> A visitor to the museum claimed to hear the swish of petticoats behind her as she walked past the base of the staircase. Turning, she was able to see just a portion of a figure, dressed in Victorian finery, go past her down <b>the</b> hallway <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> back of the house.|$|R
50|$|At {{approximately}} 1:50 PM local time, President Allende {{ordered the}} defenders of the La Moneda Palace to surrender. The defenders then formed {{a line from the}} second floor, down <b>the</b> <b>stairs</b> and onto <b>the</b> Morande street door. The president went along this queue, from the ground floor up <b>the</b> <b>stairs,</b> shaking hands and thanking everyone personally for their support in that difficult moment. At the end of the queue, Allende turned <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> Independence salon, located in the north-east side of the Palaces second floor.|$|R
6000|$|But she was gone, leaping, stumbling, hurrying, flying up <b>the</b> <b>stairs</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> {{music and}} him who had forgotten, {{but who had}} known her for his {{in each of his}} two existences, and as she climbed up she sobbed, cried and sang: [...] "Frank! Frank! Frank!" ...|$|R
60|$|He {{was less}} {{to her than}} the dust under her feet, and his protestations had not even the power to rouse her wrath. Indeed, all that worried her at this moment was vexation with herself for having troubled {{to listen to him}} at all: it had been worse than foolish to suppose that he had any news to impart which did not {{directly}} concern himself. So now, while he, utterly taken aback, was staring at her open-mouthed and bewildered, she turned away, cold and full of disdain, gathering her draperies round her, and started to walk slowly <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> <b>stairs.</b> Her clinging white skirt made a soft, swishing sound as it brushed the tiled floor, and she herself--with her slender figure, graceful neck and crown of golden curls, looked, as the gloom of evening wrapped her in, more like an intangible elf--an apparition--gliding through space, than just a scornful woman who had thought fit to reject the importunate addresses of an unwelcome suitor.|$|E
60|$|She {{was gone}} in another moment, and Evelyn hastily carried out her {{instructions}} and then waited with what patience she could assume. At last {{there was a}} rattle of wheels outside, followed by a voice giving orders, and then a tramp of feet. The sounds brought her a strange inward shrinking, but {{she ran to the}} door, and saw two tattered men awkwardly carrying a stretcher up the steps, while Carroll and another assisted them. Then the light fell upon its burden and, half prepared as she was, she started in dismay. Vane, whom she had last seen in vigorous health, lay partly covered with an old blanket which had slipped off him to the waist. His jacket looked a mass of rags, his hat had fallen aside and his face showed hollow and worn and pinched. Then he saw her and a light leaped into his eyes, but the next moment Carroll's shoulder hid him and the men plodded on <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> <b>stairs.</b> They ascended them with difficulty and the girl waited until Carroll came down.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{do not go}} {{one single}} cent on burglar alarms, Mr. Twain--not a single cent--and I will tell you why. When we were {{finishing}} our house, we found {{we had a little}} cash left over, on account of the plumber not knowing it. I was for enlightening the heathen with it, for I was always unaccountably down on the heathen somehow; but Mrs. McWilliams said no, let's have a burglar alarm. I agreed to this compromise. I will explain that whenever I want a thing, and Mrs. McWilliams wants another thing, and we decide upon the thing that Mrs. McWilliams wants--as we always do--she calls that a compromise. Very well: the man came up from New York and put in the alarm, and charged three hundred and twenty-five dollars for it, and said we could sleep without uneasiness now. So we did for awhile--say a month. Then one night we smelled smoke, and I was advised to get up and see what the matter was. I lit a candle, and started <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> <b>stairs,</b> and met a burglar coming out of a room with a basket of tinware, which he had mistaken for solid silver in the dark. He was smoking a pipe. I said, 'My friend, we do not allow smoking in this room.' He said he was a stranger, and could not be expected to know the rules of the house: said he had been in many houses just as good as this one, and it had never been objected to before. He added that as far as his experience went, such rules had never been considered to apply to burglars, anyway.|$|E
60|$|Harry and Jim {{had started}} <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> cabin before Walter ceased speaking, {{therefore}} {{he had no}} choice save to follow them, and with an undefined feeling of awe the three went down <b>the</b> <b>stairs</b> into a comfortably but not expensively furnished saloon, from each side of which led the eight state-rooms.|$|R
6000|$|As {{she said}} the words, the doctor's step was heard on <b>the</b> <b>stairs.</b> Mr. Bashwood drew back from her, with his heart beating fast in unutterable expectation. [...] "It will end to-night!" [...] he {{repeated}} to himself, under his breath, as he moved away <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> {{far end of the}} corridor.|$|R

A small set of stairs lead to a landing in front of the building on the right side of the photo. A person is at the top of <b>the</b> <b>stairs</b> walking <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> entrance of the building.

6000|$|... "Aha, Mrs. Gripper, {{there you}} are with your pots and pans, and your burning fiery furnace! One had need be Shadrach, Meshach, and the other fellow to stand over that. Breakfast as soon as ever you like. Eggs, sausages, bacon, kidneys, marmalade, water-cresses, coffee, and so forth. My friend and I belong to the select few whom it's a perfect {{privilege}} to cook for. Voluptuaries, Mrs. Gripper, voluptuaries, both of us. You'll see," [...] continued Allan, as they went on <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> <b>stairs,</b> [...] "I shall make that worthy creature young again; I'm better than a doctor for Mrs. Gripper. When she laughs, she shakes her fat sides, and when she shakes her fat sides, she exerts her muscular system; and when she exerts her muscular system--Ha! here's Susan again. Don't squeeze yourself flat against the banisters, my dear; if you don't mind hustling me on the stairs, I rather like hustling you. She looks like a full-blown rose when she blushes, doesn't she? Stop, Susan! I've orders to give. Be very particular with Mr. Midwinter's room: shake up his bed like mad, and dust his furniture till those nice round arms of yours ache again. Nonsense, my dear fellow! I'm not too familiar with them; I'm only keeping them up to their work. Now, then, Richard! where do we breakfast? Oh, here. Between ourselves, Midwinter, these splendid rooms of mine are a size too large for me; I don't feel as if I should ever be on intimate terms with my own furniture. My views in life are of the snug and slovenly sort--a kitchen chair, you know, and a low ceiling. Man wants but little here below, and wants that little long. That's not exactly the right quotation; but it expresses my meaning, and we'll let alone correcting it till the next opportunity." ...|$|E
5000|$|The central chimney and {{staircase}} {{dominate the}} interior of the house. Two vertical elements — the fireplace-chimney and <b>the</b> <b>stair</b> — compete, as it were, for central position. And each of these elements, one essentially solid, the other essentially void, compromises in its shape and position — that is, inflects <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> other to make a unity of the duality of the central core they constitute. On one side the fireplace distorts in shape and moves over a little, as does its chimney; on the other side <b>the</b> <b>stair</b> suddenly constricts its width and distorts its path because of the chimney.|$|R
50|$|When {{the group}} heads down <b>the</b> <b>stairs</b> <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> {{bottom of the}} pyramid, she stays behind {{to look at a}} photo of her boyfriend. If the player does not take the picture away from her (or gives it back after taking it away), she will later leap from a 10-storey height to her death.|$|R
60|$|Some one was tiptoeing {{across the}} floor above. The Lizard was in the hallway close beside <b>the</b> <b>stairs</b> when he {{realized}} the footsteps were coming <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> stairway, {{and a moment later}} that they were cautiously descending. The Lizard flattened himself against the wall, and if he breathed his lungs gave forth no sound.|$|R
60|$|John rose to {{his feet}} and made his way <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> door. His face showed little sign of disturbance. He even nodded to some men whom he knew slightly. As he passed down <b>the</b> <b>stairs,</b> he met Graillot. Then once more the {{self-control}} became in danger. He seized the Frenchman savagely by the arm.|$|R

Two women flank her {{on either side}} and two stand {{at the bottom of}} <b>the</b> <b>stairs.</b> Sister turns <b>toward</b> <b>the</b> camera and smiles. Three of the women do not turn to the camera. Only one woman is facing the photographer. They are all outside and the sun is shining...|$|R
