25|$|As each episode begins, viewers {{hear the}} school children, off-screen, leaving {{school at the}} end of the day. They say goodbye <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>{{classroom}}</b> pets. Once the classroom is vacant, a pencil holder rattles to create the ringing of a telephone. Often, the classroom will be decorated with student artwork or other items related to the storyline, particular animal or geographic location of that episode.|$|E

25|$|When {{they get}} back <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>classroom,</b> they wordlessly return to their cages, and their hats and capes come off. The Flyboat also disassembles by itself. Ming-Ming is always {{the first one to}} get back in her cage, Tuck is always the second, and Linny is always the last. A music style having to do with that day's rescue is played, as Linny takes a bite out of the celery in her cage and winks towards the camera as the closing credits begin.|$|E
25|$|Another {{approach}} is to use speech recognition software. In the past the hardware costs alone were so high {{that this was not}} a viable option in public schooling. However, in recent years as technology improved and prices fell, schools around the world introduced tablet computers <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>classroom.</b> And so the required computing power is already in the hands of an increasing number of children. One of the major advantages of using speech recognition software is that it can give feedback and so can be used to help improve pronunciation.|$|E

2500|$|Once {{the animal}} is saved, a parent or other {{relative}} often comes out of nowhere to give grateful thanks to the Wonder Pets for saving its baby. The Wonder Pets celebrate with a celery snack, which the rescued animal's parent sometimes adds to {{with a bit of}} regional food, or they insist on a regional preparation. Then they fly back <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>classroom</b> (they sometimes stay in the scene where they fly to at the episode's end; for example, in [...] "Save the Squirrel", they are last shown riding the roller coaster at Coney Island).|$|E

2500|$|As {{a result}} of the direct {{influence}} teachers have in shaping the mental, moral and spiritual lives of children during their most formative years, Dewey holds the profession of teaching in high esteem, often equating its social value to that of the ministry and to parenting (Dewey, APT, 2010; Dewey, DRT, 2010; Dewey, MPC, 2010; Dewey, PST, 2010; Dewey, TTC, 2010; Dewey, TTP, 2010). [...] Perhaps the most important attributes, according to Dewey, are those personal inherent qualities which the teacher brings <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>classroom.</b> [...] As Dewey notes, [...] "no amount of learning or even of acquired pedagogical skill makes up for the deficiency" [...] (Dewey, TLS, p.25) of the personal traits needed to be most successful in the profession.|$|E

2500|$|Sanders {{struggled}} {{toward the}} science area, {{and a teacher}} took him into a classroom where 30 students were located. They placed a sign in the window: [...] "1 bleeding to death," [...] in order to alert police and medical personnel of Sanders' location. Due to his knowledge of first aid, student Aaron Hancey was brought <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>classroom</b> from another by teachers despite the unfolding commotion. With {{the assistance of a}} fellow student named Kevin Starkey, and teacher Teresa Miller, Hancey administered first aid to Sanders for three hours; attempting to stem the blood loss using shirts from students in the room. Using a phone in the room, Miller and several students maintained contact with police outside the school. All the students in this room were evacuated safely.|$|E
2500|$|Fairfield University {{guarantees}} first-year students {{four years}} of campus housing and provides several housing options depending on their class.

Students typically choose to live in The Quad in order to be close <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>classroom</b> buildings and to enjoy the annual battle of dorms water fights; and frisbee and wiffleball games during the warm weather. The Orient is located in the southeast corner of campus and consists of Kostka Hall and Claver Hall which is suite style living, and also the apartments, the newest on campus housing. This section earned its nickname because the original names of the residence halls located in that area were [...] "Southeast" [...] (now Kostka) and [...] "Far East" [...] (now Claver). Though the names were changed in the 1980s, the nickname survived as a non sequitur.
