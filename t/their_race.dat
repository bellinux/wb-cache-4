Mithra possess high dexterity and agility, but lower HP and charisma. Mithra are cursed with envy.|$|E

5|$|In 1920, Donaldson made a then-controversial move {{by hiring}} an African-American {{journalist}} James Albert Jackson {{to write a}} weekly column devoted to African-American performers. According to The Business of Culture: Strategic Perspectives on Entertainment and Media, the column identified discrimination against black performers and helped validate their careers. Jackson {{was the first black}} critic at a national magazine with a predominantly white audience. According to his grandson, Donaldson also established a policy against identifying performers by <b>their</b> <b>race.</b> Donaldson died in 1925.|$|E
5|$|In {{light of}} the criticisms leveled against {{scientific}} jury selection—that it lets lawyers stack juries and distorts the effect of money—several reforms have been proposed. One common reform proposal is the elimination of peremptory challenges. Supreme Court precedent already forbids use of peremptories (peremptory challenges) to exclude jurors based solely on <b>their</b> <b>race</b> or sex. Proponents argue that doing away with peremptories altogether will eliminate the perceived and real injustice of permitting lawyers to eliminate jurors dispositionally unfavorable to them without a challenge for cause argument in open court. Opponents counter that attorneys cannot always ferret out actionable evidence of juror bias, particularly {{in the context of}} a limited voir dire.|$|E

The Browns had started out 6–0 but faltered after racial divisions cropped up within the team.

5|$|When African {{slaves were}} freed in America, they {{struggled}} {{to reach the}} social status of whites. Many former slaves tried to conform their hairstyles {{as part of this}} struggle. Women, especially, felt pressure to make their hair straight, rather than keeping the tightly coiled style they had known. However, during the civil rights movement of the 1950s and 1960s, African-Americans such as Malcolm X advocated hairstyles such as afros and dreadlocks, in order to embrace <b>their</b> <b>race,</b> and to return to West African roots.|$|E
5|$|After World War 2, William Marbury, then Chairman of the Board of Trustees of the Peabody Institute, {{began the}} process of {{integrating}} that institution, which had denied entrance to several well-regarded African American performers based solely on <b>their</b> <b>race,</b> including Anne Brown and Todd Duncan, {{who had been the}} first black performer with the New York City Opera when he was forced to study with Frank Bibb, a member of the Peabody faculty, outside the Conservatory. The director of the Peabody soon ended segregation, both at the Conservatory and at the Baltimore Symphony Orchestra, which was conducted by its first African American, A. Jack Thomas, at his request. The Peabody was officially integrated in 1949, with support from mayor Howard W. Jackson. Paul A. Brent, who graduated in 1953, was the first to matriculate, and was followed by Audrey Cyrus McCallum, who was the first to enter the Peabody Preparatory. Musical integration was a gradual process that lasted until at least 1966, when the unions for African American and white musicians merged to form the Musicians' Association of Metropolitan Baltimore. Baltimore is the hometown of African American classical opera tenor Steven Cole.|$|E
5|$|Apart {{from being}} an {{obligatory}} religious duty, the Hajj is seen to have a spiritual merit that provides the Muslims with an opportunity of self-renewal. Hajj serves {{as a reminder of}} the Day of Judgment when Muslims believe people will stand before God. Hadith literature (sayings of Muhammad) articulates various merits a pilgrim achieves upon successful completion of their Hajj. After successful pilgrimage, pilgrims can prefix their names with the title 'Al-Hajji', and are held with respect in Muslim society. However, Islamic scholars suggest Hajj should signify a Muslim's religious commitment, and should not be a measurement of their social status. Hajj brings together and unites the Muslims from {{different parts of the world}} irrespective of <b>their</b> <b>race,</b> colour, and culture, which acts as a symbol of equality.|$|E

In the occasion, Eren also learns that Zeke is his older half-brother, who betrayed their father and defected to the Marleyans. After Wall Maria is reclaimed, Eren and the others make preparations for their imminent confrontation with the Marleyan forces.|$|E
5|$|Dalton {{applied the}} logic of abolitionism {{to the cause of}} women's freedom. She said that just as no one should be made a slave because of <b>their</b> <b>race,</b> women should not have to be subservient because of their gender. She saw the Victorian ideals for women in {{marriage}} as part of that slavish subservience. She argued that since a woman loses all her property when she marries, that it would be more advantageous for her to not officially marry so she could still buy and sell land and have legal claim over her own children and her own body. Dalton also argued that new brides should be allowed to decide when they have their first child. Some of her ideas were surprisingly radical for a Mormon woman at the time, and she and Elizabeth Cady Stanton agreed that women needed to protect themselves from unjust laws.|$|E
5|$|In 1873, Melvin {{refused to}} {{transfer}} the case of Taylor Strauder, a black man, to a federal court following his indictment by an all-white Ohio County grand jury {{for the murder of}} his wife. Strauder and his lawyers argued that he would not receive equal treatment in the West Virginia courts due to its all-white jury law and cited the Civil Rights Act of 1866 for a transfer to a federal court. Following Melvin's ruling, Strauder's murder trial proceeded in the Ohio County court in May 1873, and he was inevitably convicted by an all-white jury. Strauder appealed his conviction to the Supreme Court of Appeals of West Virginia and finally to the Supreme Court of the United States, where his case Strauder v. West Virginia 100 U.S. 303 (1879) was decided on March1, 1880. The Supreme Court held that categorical exclusion of blacks from juries {{for no other reason than}} <b>their</b> <b>race</b> violated the Equal Protection Clause, and Strauder's conviction was overturned due to the Ohio County court's violation of United States constitutional criminal procedure.|$|E
