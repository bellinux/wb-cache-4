40|$|One {{of the few}} {{initiatives}} to address ongoing global warming that did not completely stall at the UNFCCC climate change negotiations was the reduction emissions from deforestation and forest degradation (REDD). REDD has {{a focus on the}} forests of the tropics. Unfortunately forest mensuration in most tropical countries has been inadequate to accurately determine forest carbon stocks, much less the effects of land use and changes in land use on them (Houghton et al. 2009; Bryan et al. 2010 a). Whilst <b>tropical</b> <b>logging</b> is known to be widespread, the exact areas of tropical forest subject to logging have not been accurately mapped (Asner et al. 2009) or mapped with sufficient regularity to provide adequate data on the areas subject to this activity. Biomass losses due to logging have usually been derived from limited plot data, or derived via various models from estimates of regional biomass and timber extraction volumes (Houghton et al. 2009) and thus encapsulate considerable uncertainty. For these reasons the carbon impact of <b>tropical</b> <b>logging</b> remains an open question, and one that needs to be closed before any international institutional arrangement considers promoting forms of timber extraction as a tool for controlling carbon emissions. Here, we examine the current state of forest carbon research in Papua New Guinea (PNG) to illustrate the problems that can arise by developing forest management policy prematurely from incomplete forest research...|$|R

40|$|Over {{the past}} few decades, {{tropical}} timber production in many Asia–Pacific countries has been akin to the symmetric logistic distribution curve, or 'Hubbert Curve', observed in the exploitation of many non-renewable resources — a rapid increase in production followed by a peak and then decline. There are three principal reasons why <b>logging</b> of native <b>tropical</b> forests resembles the mining of a non-renewable resource: the standard cutting cycle of 30 – 40 years is too brief to allow the wood volume to regenerate; <b>tropical</b> <b>logging</b> catalyses considerable deforestation; and the bulk of logging is undertaken by multinational corporations with little interest in long-term local sustainability. Unless something fundamental changes, we believe tropical forests {{will continue to be}} overharvested and cleared apace, leading to an inevitable global decline in tropical timbers of non-plantation origin.

Forest stands were classified into gap, pioneer, non-pioneer and mixed (pioneer, non-pioneer and unclassified trees) based on the species composition of trees > 10 cm diameter breast height. Soil respiration rates {{did not differ significantly}} between non-gap sites (1290 ± 210 mg CO 2 m- 2 h- 1) but were double those in gap sites (640 ± 130 mg CO 2 m- 2 h- 1). Post hoc analyses found that an increase in soil temperature and a decrease in litterfall and fine root biomass explained 72 % of the difference between gap and non-gap sites. The significant decrease of soil respiration rates in gaps, irrespective of day or night time, suggests that autotrophic respiration may be an important contributor to total soil respiration in logged forests. We conclude that biosphere-atmosphere carbon exchange models in tropical systems should incorporate gap frequency and that future research in tropical forest should emphasize the contribution of autotrophic respiration to total soil respiration. © 2009 Elsevier B.

The global move from protection to free trade has reached the Pacific and will have its greatest initial impact on Fiji’s sugar and garment industries, both of which face major restructuring and possibly extinction.

It is also a major offerer of Official Development Assistance (ODA) to this area. The purpose of this thesis is to analyze the relationship between Japanese bilateral ODA to three Southeast Asian countries (Indonesia, the Philippines, and Malaysia) and tropical timber harvest levels in these countries. Two different methods are applied: econometric timber market model analysis and the Granger causality test. Timber market model analysis shows a significant correlation between Japanese bilateral ODA and timber harvest levels in Indonesia and in Malaysia. It also shows a significant correlation between timber harvest levels in Malaysia and the number of new housing construction starts in Japan. There is no significant relationship for the Philippines. The Granger causality test shows clear evidence of causality from Japanese housing construction to timber harvest levels in Indonesia, and also to Japanese bilateral ODA to Indonesia. It shows evidence of causality from timber harvest levels in Malaysia to Japanese bilateral ODA to Malaysia, too. There are no causal effects among timber harvest levels in the Philippines, Japanese bilateral ODA to the Philippines, and Japanese housing construction. All of the results can be explained in a reasonable manner by considering political, economic, and forestry situations of the three Southeast Asian countries and Japan...|$|R
40|$|Extract] Primary {{tropical}} forests are powerhouses of biodiversity but are rapidly declining in extent and are threatened even within some protected areas. As a result, non-primary forests, {{especially those that}} have been selectively logged, are becoming more important to conservation efforts. In the tropics, logging is almost always selective, targeting only certain commercially valuable tree species above a minimum size and leaving other species unharvested. More than 400 million hectares of tropical forest are now in permanent timber estates, and at least 20 % of all <b>tropical</b> forests were <b>logged</b> from 2000 to 2005. Biologists have often emphasized the deleterious impacts of selective logging for disturbance- sensitive wildlife, but recent evidence suggests that logged forests can have surprisingly high conservation values. In a meta-analysis across four <b>tropical</b> regions, selectively <b>logged</b> forests were by far the most biologically similar to primary forests, compared with agricultural and groforestry systems...|$|R

40|$|The {{demand for}} timber {{products}} is facilitating the degradation and opening up of {{large areas of}} intact habitats rich in biodiversity. Logging creates an extensive network of access roads within the forest, yet these are commonly ignored or excluded when assessing impacts of logging on forest biodiversity. Here we determine {{the impact of these}} roads on the overall condition of selectively logged forests in Borneo, Southeast Asia. Focusing on dung beetles along > 40 km logging roads we determine: (i) the magnitude and extent of edge effects alongside logging roads; (ii) whether vegetation characteristics can explain patterns in dung beetle communities, and; (iii) how the inclusion of road edge forest impacts dung beetle assemblages within the overall logged landscape. We found that while vegetation structure was significantly affected up to 34 m from the road edge, impacts on dung beetle communities penetrated much further and were discernible up to 170 m into the forest interior. We found larger species and particularly tunnelling species responded more than other functional groups which were also influenced by micro-habitat variation. We provide important new insights into the long-term ecological impacts of <b>tropical</b> <b>logging.</b> We also support calls for improved logging road design both during and after timber extraction to conserve more effectively biodiversity in production forests, for instance, by considering the minimum volume of timber, per unit length of logging road needed to justify road construction. In particular, we suggest that governments and certification bodies need to highlight more clearly the biodiversity and environmental impacts of logging roads...|$|R

40|$|In <b>tropical</b> forest, <b>logging</b> {{operations}} are basically {{defined by a}} single and very simple rule: the Minimum Diameter Cutting Limit (MDCL). Because mixed dipterocarp forests exhibit a relatively high density of timber species (10 to 20 trees/ha), the MDCL rule leads to high felling intensities. Field experiments in East Kalimantan showed that under such high felling intensities, RIL techniques are inefficient to reduce damage on forest stand. The long term consequence of high rate of damage is an increase of the rotation cycle (> 80 years) poorly compatible with sustainable forest management principles. In addition to the global effect of logging on forest stand, commercial species face drastic change in their density and structure. Their capability {{to adapt to the}} new environmental conditions and to maintain populations in the ecosystem after logging will mainly depend on the following features: original population density, population structure, regeneration strategy, and breeding systems.

40|$|About 20 {{percent of}} the total {{production}} of tropical timber is traded internationally. But for Indonesia, Malaysia, Papua New Guinea, and some countries in West-Central Africa, tropical timber trade accounts for more than 50 percent of production. Although the tropical timber trade has often been blamed for deforestation, the authors find that it contributes much less to deforestation than do poor policies for the production of tropical timber. Lack of tenure rights, short and uncertain logging concessions, low stumpage values, and inadequate monitoring of logging activities are among the major policy failures that help deplete the tropical forests. Trade policies, often identified as an instrument for enforcing environmental objectives internationally, are inefficient instruments for correcting domestic distortions, {{and in the case of}} tropical timber trade, may affect the environment perversely. Export and import restrictions ultimately depress the value of an already underpriced resource - the forest. Restrictions on log exports, for example, encourage wasteful processing of logs. Unless sound forest management policies are enforced domestically, the net effect could even be an increase in the rate of deforestation. Import restrictions may have a marginal impact, since trade accounts for less than 20 percent of production and most of the tropical timber is imported in Asia, where such restrictions currently do not exist. Even if import restrictions had a significant impact, it would be in a reduction in value of <b>tropical</b> <b>logs</b> that would make alternative uses of the forest lands more profitable - so the rate of deforestation might not be reduced. Eco-labeling's main strength is its capacity to discriminate (through market signals) in favor of timber produced under sound environmental practices. By contrast, bans and boycotts have an indiscriminate, perverse impact. But if eco-labeling is imposed unilaterally by a subset of countries, its effectiveness will be doubtful. It will lead to trade diversion and potentially perverse environmental results, not to mention an increase in GATT trade disputes. Even if eco-labeling is adopted by all importing countries, there could still be trade diversion in tropical timber products because some consumers may not prefer certified timber, given its higher price. Eco-labeling programs should be designed so that producers see them not as a nontariff barrier but as an instrument for capturing the rents associated with prevailing environmental concerns in the developed world. Consumer education is important to the success of such programs, and eco-labeling programs should be designed accordingly.

40|$|AbstractLand use {{change is}} {{a major threat to}} biodiversity. One {{mechanism}} by which land use change influences biodiversity and ecological processes is through changes in the local climate. Here, the relationships between leaf area index and five climate variables – air temperature, relative humidity, vapour pressure deficit, specific humidity and soil temperature – are investigated across a range of land use types in Borneo, including primary <b>tropical</b> forest, <b>logged</b> forest and oil palm plantation. Strong correlations with the leaf area index are found for the mean daily maximum air and soil temperatures, the mean daily maximum vapour pressure deficit and the mean daily minimum relative humidity. Air beneath canopies with high leaf area index is cooler and has higher relative humidity during the day. Forest microclimate is also found to be less variable for sites with higher leaf area indices. Primary forest is found to be up to 2. 5 °C cooler than logged forest and up to 6. 5 °C cooler than oil palm plantations.

40|$|The {{ecological}} {{responses of}} tropical forest wildlife to selective timber extraction have received considerable {{attention in the}} last few decades, yet there is little consensus among the large number of studies about the most appropriate sampling design. Here, we reviewed 26 years of <b>tropical</b> forest <b>logging</b> literature to evaluate the relationship between sampling design and the quality of information reported, which varied greatly among 75 studies. Most studies (88 %) failed to include a pre-logging baseline condition in the sampling design, and the temporal scale of post-logging studies was generally inadequate. Studies also usually failed to report key information on study areas; only half of the articles reported some information on the spatial scale of the study, and only one-third presented some quantitative metric to describe forest habitat structure. Additionally, most studies (64 %) failed to report the type of forest management and almost half (45 %) did not describe the intensity of timber harvest in the logged areas. These sampling and reporting biases in logging studies hugely undermine the comparability among studies. We conclude with some general guidelines to maximize comparability among studies, and to enhance the potential usefulness of future logging studies for wildlife conservation strategies in tropical forest regions. © Juliana Laufer, Fernanda Michalski and Carlos A...|$|R

This study reveals some evidence of forest degradation in selectively logged production forests of Myanmar, which are subject to inappropriate cutting frequency. We compared stand structure, commercial species composition, and incidence of illegal logging between two compartments with low (LCF; 1 time) and high (HCF; 5 times) cutting frequency over a recent 18 years. Prior to the latest cutting, LCF had 176 trees ha− 1 with an inverted-J shape distribution of diameter at breast height (DBH), including a substantial amount of teak (Tectona grandis) and other commercially important species in each DBH class. HCF prior to the latest cut had only 41 trees ha− 1 without many commercially important species. At HCF, nearly half the standing trees of various species and size were illegally cut following legal operations; this was for charcoal making in nearby kilns. At LCF, two species, teak and Xylia xylocarpa, were cut illegally and sawn for timber on the spot. More extensive and systematic surveys are needed to generalize the findings of forest degradation and illegal logging. However, our study calls for urgent reconsideration of logging practices with high cutting frequency, which can greatly degrade forests with accompanying illegal logging, and for rehabilitating strongly degraded, bamboo-dominated forests. To reduce illegal logging, it would be important to pay more attention on a MSS regulation stating that logging roads should be destroyed after logging operations...|$|R

40|$|The {{increment}} of a <b>tropical</b> forest under <b>logging</b> depends {{not only}} on the growth rate but also on the residual diameter structure of the forest. It was estimated the residual diametric structure to guarantee the necessary increment to recover the logged timber volume in a compartment of tropical forest in the state of Amazonas, in Brazil. The simulation of forest growth rate calculated after cutting when observing calculated tax and structure resulted in an increment that can recover the initial commercial volume during the cycle under consideration. It was observed in simulations that if the total commercial volume is removed {{in the beginning of the}} first logging cycle the forest will not recover the timber volume under the cycle in question. It was observed that approximately 81 % of the increment that is necessary to recover the volume logged was originated in the commercial residual classes (above 45 cm of diameter center class). It was identified an optimal class of diameter to be kept in the forest, above which the timber volume return is null. The most important to be considered in the volume recover is the increment potential of the forest structure that must remain in the compartment...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Human-caused {{disturbance}} to <b>tropical</b> rainforests—such as <b>logging</b> and fire—causes substantial {{losses of}} carbon stocks. This {{is a critical}} issue {{to be addressed in}} the context of policy discussions to implement REDD+. This work reviews current scientific knowledge about the temporal dynamics of degradation-induced carbon emissions to describe common patterns of emissions from logging and fire across tropical forest regions. Using best available information, we: (i) develop short-term emissions factors (per area) for logging and fire degradation scenarios in tropical forests; and (ii) describe the temporal pattern of degradation emissions and recovery trajectory post logging and fire disturbance. Results Average emissions from aboveground biomass were 19. 9  MgC/ha for logging and 46. 0  MgC/ha for fire disturbance, with an average period of study of 3. 22 and 2. 15  years post-disturbance, respectively. Longer-term studies of post-logging forest recovery suggest that biomass accumulates to pre-disturbance levels within a few decades. Very few studies exist on longer-term (> 10  years) effects of fire disturbance in tropical rainforests, and recovery patterns over time are unknown. Conclusions This review will aid in understanding whether degradation emissions are a substantial component of country-level emissions portfolios, or whether these emissions would be offset by forest recovery and regeneration...|$|R
40|$|URL] The {{increment}} of a <b>tropical</b> forest under <b>logging</b> depends {{not only}} on the growth rate but also on the residual diameter structure of the forest. It was estimated the residual diametric structure to guarantee the necessary increment to recover the logged timber volume in a compartment of tropical forest in the state of Amazonas, in Brazil. The simulation of forest growth rate calculated after cutting when observing calculated tax and structure resulted in an increment that can recover the initial commercial volume during the cycle under consideration. It was observed in simulations that if the total commercial volume is removed {{in the beginning of the}} first logging cycle the forest will not recover the timber volume under the cycle in question. It was observed that approximately 81 % of the increment that is necessary to recover the volume logged was originated in the commercial residual classes (above 45 cm of diameter center class). It was identified an optimal class of diameter to be kept in the forest, above which the timber volume return is null.
