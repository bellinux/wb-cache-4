No previous studies in rural Australia have explored the experience of Aboriginal patients with haemodialysis or renal services delivery. Methods An Indigenist research paradigm and community based participatory research methods informed interviews conducted with 18 Aboriginal haemodialysis recipients and 29 health professionals providing treatment or care. Results ‘Family’ was the motivator for persevering with haemodialysis. Comparison of both data sets revealed significant congruence between Aboriginal and provider perspectives. A combined <b>thematic</b> <b>analysis</b> <b>produced</b> a supervening theme of Avoiding the ‘costly’ crisis. Four sub themes were: better screening for early detection; flexible family-focussed care; system redesign to demonstrate cultural understanding; managing patient fear of mainstream services.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{asks how}} the internalised racism of racial minority clients becomes identified and treated clinically by white psychotherapists. Four psychotherapists, who self-identified as white, participated in semi-structured interviews, exploring their perceptions and understandings of how internalised racism and racism manifested within the clinical setting. The data from these interviews was analysed using <b>thematic</b> <b>analysis</b> and <b>produced</b> four main themes; ‘manifestations of internalised racism and racism in therapy’, ‘dis-identification’, ‘therapist’s explicitness’ and ‘connection to culture’. These themes were supported and anchored by four sub-themes. The themes represent a therapeutic process called: emergence, understanding, intervention and aim. The emergence of ‘racism and internalised racism in therapy’ describes both the clients’ and the psychotherapists’ experiences of internalised racism and racism as it emerges in the therapeutic encounter. ‘Dis-identification’ captures the psychotherapists’ understanding of internalised racism operating as their minority client’s dis-identification with their {{racial and cultural}} heritage. ‘Therapist’s explicitness’ identifies a therapeutic intervention, the psychotherapist’s communication to their minority clients about the racial differences between them. And finally ‘connection to culture’ captures the psychotherapist’s therapeutic aim of encouraging a connection to racial and cultural heritage as a protective factor against racism and emotional and psychological difficulties...|$|R
40|$|It {{is widely}} assumed that interprofessional {{learning}} (IPL) impacts positively on interprofessional working (IPW) {{in health and}} social care. However, {{there is no clear}} evidence that pre-qualifying IPL improves service delivery. The direct effect of pre-qualifying IPL on IPW and service delivery is difficult to demonstrate; researchers must rely on professionals’ self-report in this regard. This paper presents findings from a qualitative study in which semi-structured interviews were used to collect individuals’ views and perceptions about pre-qualifying IPL as preparation for practice. Two groups of participants came from four health and social care professions: adult nursing, midwifery, physiotherapy and social work. One group had experienced a substantial pre-qualifying IPL initiative, while the other group had not. Useful insights were gained from comparing the views and perceptions of individuals from these two groups. The total sample comprised 29 practitioners: nineteen were educated on interprofessional curricula and ten on traditional uniprofessional curricula. <b>Thematic</b> data <b>analysis</b> <b>produced</b> findings about pre-qualifying education as preparation for IPW.

40|$|Purpose of the research: This {{narrative}} literature review uses systematic principles to define evidence regarding dignity conserving care at end-of-life from published research on dignity or distress in end-of-life care. Methods: The Chochinov model of dignity {{was used as}} a pre-defined framework. Articles were reviewed using <b>thematic</b> <b>analysis</b> to <b>produce</b> a synthesis of findings. A total of 39 articles (26 qualitative and 13 quantitative) fulfilled the inclusion criteria and were found to give suggestions on care actions. Key results: Several care actions were identified related to all themes contained within the Dignity Model, except aftermath concerns. Examples include: controlling symptoms; listening to the patient and taking them seriously; providing advice concerning how to cope on a daily basis; treating patients as equals and with respect, and; encouraging the family members’ presence. Conclusions: Evidence for supporting palliative care services has previously been found to be weak in determining solutions to meet individual’s important needs. Drawing together primary research, as in this study, is therefore of importance. The suggested care actions will be used to develop a dignity care pathway for end-of-life care, which is currently being evaluated by the authors.

40|$|Sport and {{exercise}} psychology research in disability sport seldom engages with social models of disability. As a result, the socio-historical landscape of disability is underrepresented in sport psychology research. The {{aim of this}} study is to interpret influences on participation in disability sport through the conceptual lens of the social relational model (SRM) of disability (Thomas, 1999, 2004, 2007). Ten Irish adult male athletes with physical disabilities participated in semi-structured interviews exploring the barriers and facilitators that influence participation in Wheelchair Rugby. Deductive <b>thematic</b> <b>analysis</b> <b>produced</b> four themes influenced by the social relational model: impairment effects; societal attitudes and discourse; opportunities and access; and psychological well-being. Links were made to the experience of embodied impairment, classification, oppression, inequality, media, independence, and self-efficacy. The analysis illustrates how cultural constructions of disability are inextricably linked to individual influences on participation in Wheelchair Rugby. The results indicate that in disability sport participation, the experience of social oppression, inequality and cultural stereotypes of disability can be synonymous with the personal experience of physical impairment. The implication of this research is that there is a value in sport {{and exercise}} psychology practitioners utilising the social relational model as a tool to conceptualise the lived experience of physical disability...|$|E

40|$|Women in the {{postpartum}} period face {{a number}} of physical and emotional challenges that research results indicate could be alleviated through exercise. Unfortunately, many new mothers are unable to participate in regular exercise due {{to a variety of}} personal and societally constructed obstacles. There is a growing trend to incorporate babies into yoga classes in an effort to increase the accessibility of postpartum exercise. There has been limited research conducted regarding the effectiveness of this emerging trend, and none have examined the feelings of participants engaged in mother and baby yoga classes. To address this gap in the literature, the experiences of 17 new mothers who participated in mother and baby yoga classes were explored. Four focus group semi-structured interviews were conducted utilizing feminist methodology designed to create an egalitarian and empowering experience.

40|$|Injuries inevitably {{occur in}} any sport at any level. The {{integrated}} sport injury model {{is one of the}} most extensive frameworks to address the psychological responses to athletic injury. While this model posits that socioeconomic status (SES) influences how an athlete cognitively, emotionally, and behaviorally responds to an injury, no research has substantiated this claim. Low SES individuals experience an exceptional amount of stress, which may complicate how they cope with a negative event. The coping strategies employed by an athlete can have major implications on rehabilitation adherence, recovery time, and psychosocial well-being. The purpose of this study was to qualitatively examine the experiences of low-to-middle SES athletes coping with injury. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 11 National Collegiate Athletic Association Division I athletes who had sustained recent injuries that lasted at least four weeks. A <b>thematic</b> data <b>analysis</b> <b>produced</b> 73 raw data themes and 16 higher-order themes, which were organized into five general dimensions: cognitive appraisals, emotional reactions, problem-focused coping, emotion-focused coping, and avoidance coping. While many participants initially reacted with catastrophizing thoughts and negatively toned emotions, they employed mostly adaptive forms of coping, such as positive reframing and perseverance. Generally, coaches, athletic trainers, sport psychology professionals, and other individuals should be more cognizant of SES and other related identities when collaborating with injured athletes...|$|R
40|$|International {{prevalence}} rates of both Adverse Childhood Experiences (ACEs) and Mental Health Difficulties (MHD) are consistently high. Research has also repeatedly identified strong positive correlations {{between these two}} widespread public health issues, both of which demonstrate intergenerational continuity and broad negative health and social outcomes. Due to these intergenerational risks, this thesis attempts {{to contribute to the}} knowledge base regarding aspects of both ACEs and MHD, from a familial perspective. Chapter one synthesises qualitative literature regarding the way in which children of parents who experience MHD make sense of their parent’s MHD. The review analysed findings across 14 studies, which produced three overarching themes. Children’s understanding of their parent’s MHD seemingly operated within a biopsychosocial model. This conceptualisation had numerous effects on their life and impacted on their perception of mental health more generally. Clinical implications for services working with children, parents and families, alongside limitations and recommendations for future research are discussed. Chapter two presents a research paper that aimed to understand how parents experienced routine enquiry about their own ACEs. <b>Thematic</b> <b>analysis</b> <b>produced</b> three themes across eleven semi-structured interviews, from seven participants. The findings proposed a five-stage chronological model of ACE enquiry, which seemed to incorporate a process of post-disclosure behaviour change. However, results also raise important clinical issues associated with power dynamics. Theoretical contributions and clinical recommendations are presented in relation to trauma enquiry and disclosure literature. Finally, chapter three offers a summary of the research findings and reflections, presented as chapters that articulate key decision and learning points...|$|E

40|$|Liver {{transplantation}} is {{a widespread}} treatment for both acute and chronic liver disease. Previous {{research has indicated that}} psychological well-being is strongly associated with positive health outcomes post-transplant. There is also evidence however to suggest a significant level of psychiatric morbidity in patients posttransplant. Therefore, it is essential to evaluate liver transplant surgery according to both physical and psychological results. This study implemented a longitudinal mixed methods approach. The objectives were; to describe the experience of patients awaiting liver transplant surgery, to examine the relationships between psychological state pre-transplant and psychological health status post-transplant; to explore any changes made to an individual's frame of reference used for self-evaluation of Health-Related Quality of Life (HRQoL) and to identify any factors that were associated with this change. One-to-one interviews were conducted with 18 participants with end-stage liver disease (ESLD); 9 ofthese participants were interviewed again at 1 month, 3 months and 9 months post liver transplant. <b>Thematic</b> <b>analysis</b> <b>produced</b> 5 themes across time: impact of liver disease/transplant on patients' life, emotional reaction to liver disease/transplant, methods of coping with liver disease/transplant, support ofothers and perception ofthe future. Quantitative analyses indicated an improvement in HRQoL from pre-transplant to 3 months post-transplant. High levels ofanxiety were evident at I-month post surgery whist depression decreased over time. Optimism scores increased from pretransplant to post 9 months. Response shift effects were observed at all posttransplant time-points with patients rating their HRQoL significantly lower (on average) in retrospect than they did at pre-transplant.

40|$|This study {{involved}} student nurses, lecturers, mentors and service users in {{working together to}} design, evaluate and refine a system enabling student mental health nurses to seek feedback from service users. The feedback concerned students' interpersonal skills and occurred in practice, {{at the point of}} service delivery. Although the drive to engage service users in service delivery, research and education has mainstream acceptance, much remains to be learned about how to achieve meaningful involvement. Mental health professionals are striving to adopt the recovery model and harness service user expertise through the development of more reciprocal relationships. This research aims to contribute to this wider thrust, by exploring the experiences of those concerned when students attempt to learn from rather than about service users. Conducted over two years, a participatory action research approach was adopted. Data came from interviews held with those implementing the system for feedback, and from the deliberations of the participants guiding the process. <b>Thematic</b> <b>analysis</b> <b>produced</b> evidence of relevance to nurse educationalists, mental health nurses and researchers. Although contextual, findings indicated that service users volunteering to give feedback had a positive experience. Students' experience lay on a continuum. Those with a stronger sense of self were more willing and able to ask for feedback than less confident students. Cultural adjustment to the role change required presented a challenge and tested self-awareness. Over time, all students achieved deep learning and, for some, learning appeared transformative. Recommendations relate to the system for seeking feedback and the conduct of participatory action research. Overall, the study concluded that both allowed the development of more equitable relationsh ips, in which mental health nurses respected the expertise of service users.

The paper begins by providing {{a brief overview of}} international developments in ECCE over the past two decades, highlighting a growing argument that points to the need for a shift in policy and programming agendas away from target setting at international levels, towards the promotion and support of localized, contextually grounded approaches to supporting policies and programmes in ECCE. In an attempt to find ways of establishing empirical support for this argument, the paper explores the extent to which key messages delivered by international donor organizations and representatives at the Policy Forum can be seen to reflect the current activities and concerns of countries within the region (as expressed through individual country reports presented during the forum). Based on results of this analysis, the paper concludes with recommendations for balancing the ‘local’ and ‘international’ influence on policy making and agenda setting as countries in the Asia Pacific region move forward with provision of formalized ECCE post- 2015.|$|R

40|$|Objectives This {{research}} {{explores the}} nature of familiness within SME manufacturing family firms in the United Kingdom. The study aims to provide a definitive answer to whether familiness exists in this sphere, explores {{the nature of}} familiness and concludes with recommendations for improving the business performance of family firms. The research applies the theoretical lens of Pierre Bourdieu to understanding the nature of family firms through examination of the innovation process. Prior Work Previous literature has reached differing conclusions about whether the family firm is indeed distinct from the non-family firm. There is therefore a need to understand, not only whether familiness exists, but also what {{the nature of these}} unique qualities are. Bourdieu’s theoretical concepts of doxa, fields and habitus have been applied separately to multiple social settings, but this study is the first to apply these powerful concepts in conjunction to explain familiness. Innovation activities have been selected as the most appropriate business activity for exploring the nature of familiness, because prior work has indicated that the stultifying influence of family can inhibit innovation. The manufacturing sector has been chosen for this study as previous research has shown that innovation is crucial for long-term survival in this sector. Surprisingly, there remains a gap in empirically based policy support and advice for family firm innovation in the UK, which this research helps to fill. Approach A mixed methods, convergent parallel design is proposed. Quantitative analysis uses a dataset of 582 manufacturing SMEs to determine through descriptive statistics whether there are distinctive differences between family and non-family firms. A factor <b>analysis</b> then <b>produces</b> statistically derived factors of familiness. Hypotheses, derived from both the statistical analysis and the literature, are then tested using chi-squared techniques. The mixed methods approach continues with a qualitative analysis that provides rich insights of how familiness contributes to innovation. The primary dataset for qualitative analysis consists of 27 semi-structured interviews with SME family manufacturing firms. Cross-case, <b>thematic</b> <b>analysis</b> <b>produces</b> a Bourdieusian-derived conceptual grouping of family firms. Throughout the quantitative and qualitative analyses, Bourdieu’s theories of habitus, fields and doxa provide an insightful underpinning conceptual framework. Findings The quantitative findings confirm there are distinct differences between family and non-family firms in the SME manufacturing sector in the UK, which leads to the conclusion that familiness does exist. The quantitative findings provide surprising results that innovation is higher in older family firms, and that innovation is not related to awareness of external support. The qualitative findings show that Bourdieusian concepts of doxa, habitus, and fields used in conjunction provide a powerful theoretical explanation for the values and motivations that drive distinctive family firm behaviour. A triangulation of results produces a taxonomy of family firms according to their innovation activity and their unique family characteristics. Value The taxonomy represents a contribution to theoretical knowledge by developing Bourdieusian-inspired theory as to how familiness can be used to develop competitive advantage. The methodological contribution to knowledge is made through an innovative convergent parallel mixed methods design. Future family firm researchers can use this design to establish the existence of familiness through quantitative techniques and to explore the nature of familiness using a qualitative approach. The research makes a contribution to practice by making recommendations for family firms and policy suggestions for national and local governments to support family firm innovation...|$|R
40|$|Community {{colleges in}} Western North Carolina have {{enrolled}} many displaced workers who lack basic academic skills and {{are unable to}} find jobs. This study focused {{on the problem of}} displaced workers with low academic skills who rarely advance beyond Adult Basic Education (ABE) classes for retraining in high-tech job skills. The purpose of this single case {{study was to determine the}} barriers that prevent functionally illiterate displaced workers or nontraditional students enrolled in ABE programs from completing ABE classes and advancing to retraining programs. The adult learning styles and learning impediments framework were used to study what prevented student advancement beyond the ABE programs. Eight students were purposefully identified and agreed to participate in the study. The student participants completed open-ended questionnaires, participated in semi-structured individual interviews, and were observed in a classroom environment. The collected data were analyzed using descriptive coding and <b>thematic</b> <b>analysis.</b> The study <b>produced</b> 2 key themes that may help students succeed: (a) ABE instructors should adapt teaching methods to adult learning styles, and (b) the primary focus of ABE programs should be on the improvement of basic English language skills. The results of this study can be used by ABE directors, ABE instructors, and community college administrators as they seek to improve adult learning in ABE programs, increase students 2 ̆ 7 technical skills, and get displaced workers back to work...|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} note uses a {{case study}} approach to illustrate {{when and how to}} apply <b>thematic</b> <b>analysis</b> as a tool to interpret empirical material in tourism research and suggests a variety of research contexts in which its use may be appropriate. The case study demonstrates the value of <b>thematic</b> <b>analysis</b> in understanding and unpacking a body of rich, descriptive media text (such as magazine articles, social media, and marketing material). This note also establishes that <b>thematic</b> <b>analysis</b> can be successfully used with visual material, taking intertextuality into account to facilitate a well-balanced interpretation of underlying cultural meanings. A further strength is the ability to produce graphic representations of the analysis, which then provide a suitable structure for discussing the findings. Using research carried out on second-home articles in a New Zealand magazine from 1936 to 2012 to illustrate the process, a step by step description of how to apply <b>thematic</b> <b>analysis</b> to written and visual text is provided. It also provides a set of criteria to ensure the trustworthiness of the research output, and as such is a valuable guide to carrying out a rigorous <b>thematic</b> <b>analysis</b> of texts in a variety of tourism research contexts...|$|R
