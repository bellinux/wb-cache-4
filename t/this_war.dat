5|$|The Hudson Bay territories (known to the English as Prince Rupert's Land) {{were not}} {{significantly}} fought over in <b>this</b> <b>war.</b> They had been a scene of much dispute by competing French and English companies starting in the 1680s, but the 1697 Treaty of Ryswick left France in control of all but one outpost on the bay. The only incident of note was a French attack on the outpost of Fort Albany in 1709. The Hudson's Bay Company was unhappy that Ryswick had not returned its territories, and it successfully lobbied {{for the return of}} its territories in the negotiations that ended <b>this</b> <b>war.</b>|$|E

5|$|A revitalised Parthian Empire renewed its {{assault in}} 161 AD, {{defeating}} two Roman armies and invading Armenia and Syria. Emperor Lucius Verus and general Gaius Avidius Cassius were sent in 162 AD {{to counter the}} resurgent Parthia. In <b>this</b> <b>war,</b> the Parthian city of Seleucia on the Tigris was destroyed and the palace at the capital Ctesiphon was {{burned to the ground}} by Avidius Cassius in 164 AD. The Parthians made peace but were forced to cede western Mesopotamia to the Romans.|$|E

5|$|It is {{difficult}} {{to determine the extent to}} which the events of <b>this</b> <b>war</b> contributed to changes in the use and legal rights of Roman slaves. The end of the Servile Wars seems to have coincided with the end of the period of the most prominent use of slaves in Rome and the beginning of a new perception of slaves within Roman society and law. The Third Servile War was the last of the Servile Wars, and Rome did not see another slave uprising of this magnitude again.|$|E

Tywin gives half of his forces to Jaime to attack Riverrun, the seat of House Tully and Lady Catelyn's childhood home, in retaliation for Catelyn's seizure of Tyrion.|$|E

5|$|On 20 April 1792, the French National Convention {{declared}} war on Austria. In <b>this</b> <b>War</b> of the First Coalition (1792–1798), France ranged itself against most of the European states sharing land or water borders with her, plus Portugal and the Ottoman Empire. Although the Coalition forces achieved several victories at Verdun, Kaiserslautern, Neerwinden, Mainz, Amberg and Würzburg, the efforts of Napoleon Bonaparte in northern Italy pushed Austrian forces back and resulted in the negotiation of the Peace of Leoben (17 April 1797) and the subsequent Treaty of Campo Formio (October 1797).|$|E

In <b>this</b> <b>War</b> of the First Coalition (1792–1798), France ranged itself against most of the European states sharing land or water borders with her, plus Portugal and the Ottoman Empire. Coalition forces achieved several victories at Verdun, Kaiserslautern, Neerwinden, but these were countered by French victories at Tourcouring (1794), Dunkirk, and Haguenau. For the French, the Rhine Campaign of 1795 proved especially disastrous, although they had achieved some success in other theaters of war (see for example, War of the Pyrenees (1793–1795).|$|E
5|$|The 4th Siege of Badajoz {{took place}} from July to October 1658 during the Portuguese Restoration War.

The fortifications of Badajoz were essentially medieval and considered vulnerable by the Portuguese, and had already been attacked by them three times during <b>this</b> <b>war.</b>|$|E

5|$|The French Republican {{position}} {{became increasingly}} difficult. Compounding problems in international relations, French émigrés agitated for {{support of a}} counter-revolution. From their base in Koblenz, adjacent to the French–German border, they sought direct support for military intervention from the royal houses of Europe, and raised an army. On 20 April 1792, the French National Convention declared war on Austria and its allies. In <b>this</b> <b>War</b> of the First Coalition (1792–1798), France ranged itself against most of the European states sharing land or water borders with her. Portugal and the Ottoman Empire also joined the alliance against France.|$|E
5|$|The Navy's {{experience}} in <b>this</b> <b>war</b> was encouraging {{in that it}} had won but also cautionary in that the enemy {{had one of the}} weakest of the world's modern fleets. Also, the Manila Bay attack was extremely risky in which the American ships could have incurred severe damage or run out of supplies, as they were 7,000 miles from the nearest American harbor. That would {{have a profound effect on}} Navy strategy and American foreign policy for next several decades.|$|E

5|$|The {{sources for}} <b>this</b> <b>war</b> are mostly of Byzantine origin. Foremost among the {{contemporary}} Greek texts is the Chronicon Paschale by an unidentified author from around 630.

Theodore the Synkellos has a surviving speech, which was made during the Siege of Constantinople in 626, that contains useful information for some events. There are some surviving papyri from Egypt from that period.|$|E
