The delay interval between the throttle and the engine response was often around the one-to-two second mark; pilots would typically adapt to this peculiarity of the aircraft and become adept at mastering height control. Two {{attempts were made to}} improve the height control, the addition of a simplistic trimmer on the throttle to restrict its possible speed of movement, and the installation of 'throttle-anticipators' that failed to operate as intended.

40|$|The {{motivation}} {{for the development of}} vehicle stability control systems {{comes from the fact that}} vehicle dynamic behavior in unfavorable driving conditions such as low road-tire adhesion and high speed differs greatly from its nominal behavior. Due to this unexpected behavior, a driver may not be successful in controlling the vehicle in challenging driving situations based only on her/his everyday driving experience. Several noteworthy research works have been conducted on stability control systems over the last two decades to prevent car accidents due to human error. Most of the resultant stability controllers contain individual modules, where each perform a particular task such as yaw tracking, sideslip control, or wheel slip control. These design requirements may contradict each other in some driving scenarios. In such situations, inconsistent control actions can be generated with individual modules. The development of a stability controller that can satisfy diverse and often contradictory requirements is a great challenge. In general, transferring a control structure from one vehicle to another with a different drivetrain layout and actuation system configuration requires remarkable rectifications and repetition of tuning processes from the beginning to achieve a similar performance. This can be considered to be a serious drawback for car manufacturing companies since it results in extra effort, time, and expenses in redesigning and retuning the controller. In this thesis, an integrated controller with a modular structure has been designed to concurrently provide control of the vehicle chassis (yaw rate and sideslip control) and wheel stability (wheel slip ratio control). The proposed control structure incorporates longitudinal and lateral vehicle dynamics to decide on a unified control action. This control action is an outcome of solving an optimization problem that considers all the control objectives in a single cost function, so integrated wheel and vehicle stability is guaranteed. Moreover, according to the particular modular design of the proposed control structure, it can be easily reconfigured to work with different drivetrain layouts such as all-wheel-drive, front-wheel-drive, and rear-wheel-drive, as well as various actuators such as torque vectoring, differential braking, and active steering systems. The high-level control module provides a Center of Gravity (CG) based error analysis and determines the required longitudinal forces and yaw moment adjustments. The low-level control module utilizes this information to allocate control actions optimally at each vehicle corner (wheel) through a single or multi-actuator regime. In order to consider the effect of the actuator dynamics, a mathematical description of the auction system is included in distribution objective function. Therefore, a legitimate control performance is promised in situations requiring shifting from one configuration to another with minimal modifications. The performance of the proposed modular control structure is examined in simulations with a high-fidelity model of an electric GM Equinox vehicle. The high-fidelity model has been developed and provided by GM and the use of the model is to reduce the number of labor-intensive vehicle test and is to test extreme and dangerous driving conditions. Several driving scenarios with severe steering and <b>throttle</b> <b>commands,</b> then, are designed to evaluate the capability of the proposed control structure in integrated longitudinal and lateral vehicle stabilization on slippery road condition. Experimental tests also have been performed with two different electric vehicles for real-time implementation as well as validation purposes.

30|$|The master {{controller}} {{was the primary}} means of controlling the tram and integrated <b>throttle</b> and braking <b>commands</b> into a single lever.

This was a non-technical skill and descriptions supported the joint-cognitive systems view [12]. The master controller is ultimately associated with the safety function of ensuring a smooth passenger journey task and subtask, as shown in Fig.  3. The problems observed with the master controller fell into a number of categories and included designs with low correspondence between body and arm posture, variation in reach distances, and forearm pads that did not facilitate contact with all master controller notch positions. For example, the master controller in Fig.  4 was integrated into the right-arm of the driver seat and could only be adjusted by pivoting the armrest up or down at the point it joined the rear of the chair. The way that master controller movements graduated with accelerating and braking also varied between trams, within and between the two sites. Predicting changes in tram speed was therefore less reliable and reported as a contributing factor to work-related stress.|$|R

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{investigates the}} problem of developing verifiable stable control architectures for gas turbine engines. First, a nonlinear physics-based dynamic model of a twin spool turboshaft engine which drives a variable pitch propeller is developed. In this model, {{the dynamics of the}} engine are defined to be the two spool speeds, and the two control inputs to the system are fuel flow rate and prop pitch angle. Experimental results are used to verify the dynamic model of JetCat SPT 5 turboshaft engine. Based on the experimental data, performance maps of the engine components including propeller, high pressure compressor, high pressure, and low pressure turbines are constructed. The engine numerical model is implemented using Matlab. Second, a stable gain scheduled controller is described and developed for a gas turbine engine that drives a variable pitch propeller. A stability proof is developed for a gain scheduled closed-loop system using global linearization and linear matrix inequality (LMI) techniques. Using convex optimization tools, a single quadratic Lyapunov function is computed for multiple linearizations near equilibrium and non-equilibrium points of the nonlinear closed-loop system. This approach guarantees stability of the closed-loop gas turbine engine system. To verify the stability of the closed-loop system on-line, an optimization problem is proposed which is solvable using convex optimization tools. Through simulations, we show the developed gain scheduled controller is capable to regulate a turboshaft engine for large thrust commands in a stable fashion with proper tracking performance. Third, a gain scheduled model reference adaptive control (GS-MRAC) concept for multi-input multi-output (MIMO) nonlinear plants with constraints on the control inputs is developed and described. Specifically, adaptive state feedback for the output tracking control problem of MIMO nonlinear systems is studied. Gain scheduled reference model system is used for generating desired state trajectories, and the stability of this reference model is also analyzed using convex optimization tools. This approach guarantees stability of the closed-loop gain scheduled gas turbine engine system, which is used as a gain scheduled reference model. An adaptive state feedback control scheme is developed and its stability is proven, in addition to transient and steady-state performance guarantees. The resulting closed-loop system is shown to have ultimately bounded solutions with a priori adjustable bounded tracking error. The results are then extended to GS-MRAC with constraints on the magnitudes of multiple control inputs. Sufficient conditions for uniform boundedness of the closed-loop system is derived. A semi-global stability result is proven with respect to the level of saturation for open-loop unstable plants, while the stability result is shown to be global for open-loop stable plants. Simulations are performed for three different models of the turboshaft engine, including the nominal engine model and two models where the engine is degraded. Through simulations, we show the developed GS-MRAC architecture can be used for the tracking problem of degraded turboshaft engine for large thrust commands with guaranteed stability. Finally, a decentralized linear parameter dependent representation of the engine model is developed, suitable for decentralized control of the engine with core and fan/prop subsystems. Control theoretic concepts for decentralized gain scheduled model reference adaptive control (D-GS-MRAC) systems is developed. For each subsystem, a linear parameter dependent model is available and a common Lyapunov matrix can be computed using convex optimization tools. With this control architecture, the two subsystems of the engine (i. e., engine core and engine prop/fan) can be controlled with independent controllers for large <b>throttle</b> <b>commands</b> in a decentralized manner. Based on this D-GS-MRAC architecture, a "plug and play" (PnP) technology concept for gas turbine engine control systems is investigated, which allows us to match different engine cores with different engine fans/propellers. With this plug and play engine control architecture, engine cores and fans/props could be used with their on-board subordinate controllers ready for integration into a functional propulsion system. Simulation results for three different models of the engine, including the nominal engine model, the model with a new prop, and the model with a new engine core, illustrate the possibility of PnP technology development for gas turbine engine control systems.

This thesis presents a stochastic thrust model and aerodynamic model for small propeller driven UAVs whose power plant {{is a small}} electric motor. First a model which relates thrust generated by a small propeller driven electric motor {{as a function of}} <b>throttle</b> setting and <b>commanded</b> engine RPM is developed. A perturbation of this model is then used to relate the uncertainty in throttle and engine RPM commanded to the error in the predicted thrust. Such a stochastic model is indispensable in the design of state estimation and control systems for UAVs where the performance requirements of the systems are specied in stochastic terms. It is shown that thrust prediction models for small UAVs are not a simple, explicit functions relating throttle input and RPM command to thrust generated. Rather they are non-linear, iterative procedures which depend on a geometric description of the propeller and mathematical model of the motor. A detailed derivation of the iterative procedure is presented and the impact of errors which arise from inaccurate propeller and motor descriptions are discussed. Validation results from a series of wind tunnel tests are presented. The results show a favorable statistical agreement between the thrust uncertainty predicted by the model and the errors measured in the wind tunnel.

Within the system, the major control loop is between the mass flow rate and thruster current, with time-dependencies required to handle all expected transients, and additional, much slower interactions between the thruster and cathode temperatures, flow controller and PPU. The internal system interactions generally occur on shorter timescales than the spacecraft interactions, though certain failure modes may require rapid responses from the spacecraft. The AEPS system performance model is designed to account for all these interactions in a way that allows evaluation of the sensitivity of the system to expected changes over the planned mission as well as to assess the impacts of normal component and assembly variability during the production phase of the program. This effort describes the plan for the system performance model development, correlation to NASA test data, and how the model will be used to evaluate the critical internal and external interactions. The results will ensure the component requirements do not unnecessarily drive the system cost or overly constrain the development program. Finally, the model will be available to quickly troubleshoot any future unforeseen development challenges...|$|R
