5|$|Banksia cuneata lacks a lignotuber, so {{plants are}} killed by bushfire. However, this species is {{strongly}} serotinous: seed is released only following a fire. Thus plants accumulate an aerial seed bank in fire intervals, which is released all at once after a fire, ensuring population regeneration. The mechanism is a resin that seals the follicles shut, preventing dehiscence; <b>the</b> <b>heat</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> bushfire melts the resin, and the follicles open. Intense fires cause the immediate release of the seed and seed separator, but after cooler fires the seed separator often remains in place, blocking the follicle exit and preventing seed release. The wings on the seed separator are hygroscopic; they draw together when moistened, then reflex out again as they dry. Thus they lever themselves, and the seeds, out of the follicle {{over the course of}} one or more wet-dry cycles, ensuring that seed is released only after rain has fallen. The juvenile period for B.cuneata is around four years. Populations are very vulnerable to fire during this period, as fire will wipe out the entire population {{and there will be no}} seed from which it might recover. A model-based investigation found that the optimal fire interval for maximising population size over the medium term is around 15 years. More frequent fires reduce population size by killing adults before they have reached their full fecundity. Less frequent fires reduce population size because there are fewer opportunities for seed dispersal and germination. However, the optimal fire interval for minimising the risk of extinct in the long term is probably much longer.|$|E
25|$|Scarification mimics natural {{processes}} that weaken the seed coat before germination. In nature, some seeds require particular conditions to germinate, such as <b>the</b> <b>heat</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> fire (e.g., many Australian native plants), or soaking {{in a body}} of water {{for a long period of}} time. Others need to be passed through an animal's digestive tract to weaken the seed coat enough to allow the seedling to emerge.|$|E

25|$|The {{first known}} temple to Venus was vowed to Venus Obsequens ("Indulgent Venus") by Q. Fabius Gurges in <b>the</b> <b>heat</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> {{battle against the}} Samnites.

Its dedication date connects Venus Obsequens to the Vinalia rustica festival.|$|E

25|$|Sodium bicarbonate, {{regular or}} {{ordinary}} used on class B and C fires, {{was the first}} of the dry chemical agents developed. In <b>the</b> <b>heat</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> fire, it releases a cloud of carbon dioxide that smothers the fire. That is, the gas drives oxygen away from the fire, thus stopping the chemical reaction. This agent is not generally effective on class A fires because the agent is expended and the cloud of gas dissipates quickly, and if the fuel is still sufficiently hot, the fire starts up again. While liquid and gas fires do not usually store much heat in their fuel source, solid fires do. Sodium bicarbonate was very common in commercial kitchens before the advent of wet chemical agents, but now is falling out of favor, as it is much less effective than wet chemical agents for class K fires, less effective than Purple-K for class B fires, and is ineffective on class A fires.

500|$|A popular subgenre of war {{films in}} the 1950s and 1960s was the {{prisoner}} of war film. The genre was popularised in Britain with major films like Guy Hamilton's The Colditz Story (1955) and John Sturges's The Great Escape (1963). They told stories of real escapes from German prisoner of war camps such as Stalag Luft III in the Second World War. Despite episodes of danger and human tragedy, these films delight in a continual boyish game of escape and ingenuity, celebrating the courage and the defiant spirit of the prisoners of war, and treating war as fun. David Lean's Bridge on the River Kwai (1957) was judged best picture at the Oscars; it took the genre from chilly German prisons to <b>the</b> <b>heat</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> camp in Thailand. It was the first, too, to use lush colour {{to bring out the}} British stiff upper lip of the colonel, played by Alec Guinness in an Oscar-winning performance.

2500|$|There then {{followed}} two cantatas {{based on the}} poetry of René Char. Of Le Visage nuptial Griffiths observes that [...] "Char’s five poems speak in hard-edged surrealist imagery of an ecstatic sexual passion", which Boulez reflected in music [...] "on the borders of fevered hysteria". He explored modes of articulation between song and speech, as well as quarter-tones. [...] In its original version (1946–47) the piece was scored for small forces (soprano, contralto, two ondes Martenot, piano and percussion). Forty years later Boulez arrived at the definitive version for soprano, mezzo-soprano, chorus and orchestra (1985–89). Le Soleil des eaux (1948) originated in incidental music for a radio drama by Char. It went though three further versions before reaching its final form in 1965 as a piece for soprano, mixed chorus and orchestra. The first movement (Complainte du lézard amoureux) is a love song addressed by a lizard to a goldfinch in <b>the</b> <b>heat</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> summer day, in an atmosphere which Jameux characterises as [...] "fluid and nonchalant". By contrast the second movement (La Sorgue) is described by Griffiths as a violent and incantatory protest against the pollution of the river Sorgue, [...] "with shouting chorus and a bounding quaver rhythm".|$|E
