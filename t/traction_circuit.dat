50|$|Protection of {{traction}} motors from short circuits {{is accomplished by}} means of a fast-acting circuit breaker, which disconnects the <b>traction</b> <b>circuit</b> within 2-5 milliseconds if the current exceeds 575±25 amps. In case of a short to ground where the current does not exceed this level, protection is accomplished by a differential relay which compares current {{at both ends of the}} circuit and opens the circuit breaker if the difference in current exceeds 40 amps. The {{traction motors}} are also protected by a wheelslip relay which trips if the angular velocity of one of the traction motors significantly differs from the others (wheelslip, skidding, stripped gears, etc.) and an overload relay which trips if the current in a traction motor's circuit exceeds 265 amps; tripping of these relays automatically reduces the train's acceleration. The engineer's instrument panel has warning lights which illuminate when any of these relays trip (except for the differential relay—its action can be deduced from certain peculiarities in the tripping of the circuit breaker), and the tripping of the wheelslip relay also activates a warning bell.|$|E

In this Licentiate thesis, an isolated high power integrated charger is proposed, designed and constructed based on a special ac machine with a double set of stator windings called motor/generator. The charger is capable of unit power factor operation as well as bi-directional power operation for grid to vehicle application. The mathematical electromechanical model of the motor/generator is derived and presented. Based on the developed model, new controller schemes are developed and designed for the grid synchronization and charge control. The machine windings are re-arranged for the traction and charging by a controllable relay-based switching device that is designed for this purpose.

Different examples of integrated chargers reported by academia or industry, isolated or non-isolated, are reviewed and compared in terms of circuit configuration, control strategy, degree of integration, and efficiency. Moreover some new isolated and non-isolated solutions are presented and explained. A patented integrated motor drive and isolated battery charger based on a split-phase permanent magnet (PM) motor is described where the motor windings are reconfigured for the traction and charging mode by using a relay-based switching device. To reduce the magnetization current due to the motor airgap, the motor rotates at synchronous speed during the battery charging. So, an extra clutch is used in the system to disconnect the motor from the vehicle transmission during the charge operation. The mathematical model of the split-phase PM motor based on a double $dq$ approach, the developed controllers, and the system functionality are explained. Moreover, simulation and experimental results show that the system has a good performance in terms of system efficiency and dynamic response with two PM motor alternatives in two separate practical systems. Two new categories of integrated motor drives and non-isolated battery chargers are presented and explained. The first scheme is based on the winding's reconfiguration of a split-phase PM motor which simulation and practical results are provided. The second scheme is a single-phase solution that a split-phase PM motor and two inverters enable battery charging.

5000|$|The engineer's {{controller}} has 18 starting notches, {{of which}} only 4 {{are classified as}} running notches (allowing prolonged operation of the motors in this notch). Acceleration is mainly controlled by means of resistances which are initially connected into the <b>traction</b> motor <b>circuit</b> and then incrementally notched out by means of shorting with special contactors. These contactors (19 in all) are grouped together in one drum controller. The ER2 uses an indirect control system: the engineer only has to place his (or her) controller handle in the desired notch, and the control system automatically notches out the drum controller to reach that notch. (The drum controller is pneumatically operated). For slow movement, as when shunting, the engineer places the controller in the first notch, designated M ("manevrovoe", i.e. [...] "shunting"); this closes both line contactors, the bridge contactor, and contactors #7 and #8, connecting all 4 traction motors in series and engaging all of the starting resistances (total resistance 17.66 ohm). Moving the controller handle to the next notch (running notch #1) initiates an incremental notching-out (shorting-out) of the starting resistances; unlike most Russian electric locomotives, on which the engineer directly controls {{the selection of the}} starting notches, in the ER2 the intermediate starting notches are switched automatically by means of an accelerating relay which regulates the train's acceleration (by monitoring the traction current's change, see also: Traction motor#Automatic acceleration), although the engineer can override it and select the intermediate notches manually. In starting notch #9, all of the starting resistances are shorted out, and only the series-connected traction motors remain in the circuit, their fields at 100% strength. This corresponds to running notch #1 on the engineer's controller. Further notching out of the controller weakens the traction motors' field: in starting notch #10, the field strength is reduced to 67%, and in starting notch #11 to 50%. Starting notch #11 corresponds to running notch #2 on the engineer's controller.|$|R
