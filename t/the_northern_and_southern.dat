5|$|The {{climate of}} a region depends {{on a number of}} factors, {{especially}} latitude. A latitudinal band of the surface with similar climatic attributes forms a climate region. There are a number of such regions, ranging from the tropical climate at the equator to the polar climate in <b>the</b> <b>northern</b> <b>and</b> <b>southern</b> extremes. Weather is also influenced by the seasons, which result from the Earth's axis being tilted relative to its orbital plane. Thus, at any given time during the summer or winter, one part of the Earth is more directly exposed to the rays of the sun. This exposure alternates as the Earth revolves in its orbit. At any given time, regardless of season, <b>the</b> <b>northern</b> <b>and</b> <b>southern</b> hemispheres experience opposite seasons.|$|E
