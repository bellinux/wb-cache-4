40|$|Intramedullary tibiotalocalcaneal {{arthrodesis}} (IMTCA) is {{an increasingly}} used procedure for salvage of complex hindfoot and ankle disorders. 1 • 2 To avoid injury to vital plantar neurovascular structures, {{it is important}} to begin with an appropriate insertion site during retrograde IMTCA. We use a simple, reproducible method to deter-mine this site based on anatomic landmarks. TECHNIQUE In the sagittal plane, a line is drawn from the second toe {{to the center of the}} heel (Fig. 1). In the coronal plane, a line is drawn at the junction of the anterior and middle thirds of the heel pad (Fig. 1). A line drawn in the coronal plane bisecting the medial malleolus may also be used (Fig. 2). If the medial malleolus is used as a reference, the line obviously must be drawn before resection of the malleoli. At the intersection of the sagittal and coronal lines, a 3 -cm transverse incision is made in the skin and subcutaneous tissue. A hemostat is used to bluntly dissect down to the plantar cortex of the calcaneus. A 3. 2 -mm threaded <b>tip</b> <b>guide</b> pin is then placed onto the plantar cortex of the calcaneal body. If the guide pin slides medially toward the sustentaculum, reposition it a few more millimeters laterally. Verify proper place-ment into the distal tibia in the anteroposterior and lateral planes with fluoroscopy. Recent follow-up neurological examination in 22 pa-tients who had undergone IMTCA at our institution at an average of 18 months postoperatively indicated n...|$|E

40|$|Objective: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the degree of conversion and hardness of different composite resins, photo-activated for 40 s with two different light <b>guide</b> <b>tips,</b> fiber optic and polymer. Methods: Five specimens were made for each group evaluated. The percentage of unreacted carbon double bonds (% C=C) was determined from the ratio of absorbance intensities of aliphatic C=C (peak at 1637 cm- 1) against internal standard before and after curing of the specimen: aromatic C-C (peak at 1610 cm- 1). The Vickers hardness measurements were performed in a universal testing machine. A 50 gf load was used and the indenter with a dwell time of 30 seconds. The degree of conversion and hardness mean values were analyzed separately by ANOVA and Tukey's test, with a significance level set at 5 %. Results: The mean values of degree of conversion for the polymer and fiber optic light <b>guide</b> <b>tip</b> were statistically different (P<. 001). The hardness mean values were statistically different among the light <b>guide</b> <b>tips</b> (P<. 001), but also there was difference between top and bottom surfaces (P<. 001).

50|$|Trekkers on Mount Kilimanjaro {{typically}} have a support crew of guides and porters who are integral in helping climbers reach the summit. The {{size of the}} support crew depends {{on the number of}} trekkers in a group and is regulated by the Kilimanjaro National Park (KINAPA). Tour operators are expected to comply with KINAPA guide and porter regulations. A typical climbing group of 2 trekkers will have one guide, one assistant guide, 6 porters (3 for each climber) and one cook. Porters are responsible for carrying a trekkers gear as well as key items like tents, water and cooking supplies. It is customary to <b>tip</b> <b>guides</b> and porters at the last meal on the mountain or {{at the end of the}} trip.

40|$|Orientation of a bi-leaflet {{prosthesis}} (BLP) might influence coronary perfusion. The aim of {{this study}} was to investigate the influence of the orientation on coronary perfusion pressure during hyperemia and adrenergic stimulation. During hyperemia perfusion pressure determines coronary blood flow. Fourteen patients with normal coronary angiogram underwent aortic valve replacement (AVR) by a BLP, and seven received a bio-prosthesis. Patients receiving a BLP were randomized to either orientation A (hinge mechanism perpendicular to a line drawn between the coronary ostia) or B (hinge mechanism parallel to the line between the ostia). Six months after surgery all patients underwent cardiac catheterization. Pressures were measured during resting conditions, during maximum hyperemia, and during maximum adrenergic stimulation with a guiding catheter in the aortic arch (Pao), simultaneously with a sensor <b>tipped</b> <b>guide</b> wire in the coronary artery (Pcor) and in the aortic root (Proot). Pao-Proot described a flow-induced pressure drop in the aortic root (Venturi effect) and the gradient Proot-Pcor described coronary ostium abnormalities.

40|$|Accurate {{guidance}} of an ablation catheter {{is critical in}} the RF ablation (RFA) of ventricular tachycardia (VT). With current technologies, {{it is challenging to}} rapidly and accurately localize the site of origin of an arrhythmia, often restricting treatment to patients with hemodynamically stable arrhythmias. We investigated the effectiveness of a new guidance method, the inverse solution guidance algorithm (ISGA), which is based on a single-equivalent dipole representation of cardiac electrical activity and is suitable for patients with hemodynamically unstable VT. Imaging was performed in homogeneous and inhomogeneous saline-filled torso phantoms in which a catheter <b>tip</b> was <b>guided</b> toward a stationary electrical dipole source over distances of more than 5 cm. Using ISGA, the moving catheter <b>tip</b> was <b>guided</b> to within 0. 61 plusmn 0. 43 and 0. 55 plusmn 0. 39 mm of the stationary source in the homogeneous and inhomogeneous phantoms, respectively. This accuracy was achieved with less than ten movements of the catheter. These results suggest that ISGA has potential to provide accurate and efficient guidance for RFA procedures in the patient population with hemodynamically unstable arrhythmias.
