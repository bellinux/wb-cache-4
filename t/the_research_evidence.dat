25|$|How might {{climate change}} affect energy {{consumption}} in the United States? <b>The</b> <b>research</b> <b>evidence</b> is relatively clear that climate warming will mean reductions in total U.S. heating requirements and increases in total cooling requirements for buildings. These changes will vary by region and by season, but they will affect household and business energy costs and their demands on energy supply institutions. In general, the changes imply increased demands for electricity, which supplies virtually all cooling energy services but only some heating services. Other effects on energy consumption are less clear.|$|E
25|$|How might {{climate change}} affect energy {{production}} and {{supply in the}} United States? <b>The</b> <b>research</b> <b>evidence</b> about effects is {{not as strong as}} for energy consumption, but climate change could affect energy production and supply (a) if extreme weather events become more intense, (b) where regions dependent on water supplies for hydropower and/or thermal power plant cooling face reductions in water supplies, (c) where temperature increases decrease overall thermoelectric power generation efficiencies, and (d) where changed conditions affect facility siting decisions.

25|$|How might {{climate change}} have other effects that {{indirectly}} shape energy {{production and consumption}} in the United States? <b>The</b> <b>research</b> <b>evidence</b> about indirect effects ranges from abundant information about possible {{effects of climate change}} policies on energy technology choices to extremely limited information about such issues as effects on energy security. Based on this mixed evidence, it appears that climate change is likely to affect risk management in the investment behavior of some energy institutions, and it is very likely to have some effects on energy technology R investments and energy resource and technology choices. In addition, climate change can be expected to affect other countries in ways that in turn affect U.S. energy conditions through their participation in global and hemispheric energy markets, and climate change concerns could interact with some driving forces behind policies focused on U.S. energy security.|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: The gaps {{observed}} between <b>the</b> use of <b>research</b> <b>evidence</b> and policy {{have been reported}} {{to be based on the}} different methods of using <b>research</b> <b>evidence</b> in policymaking by researchers and actual policymakers. Some policies and policymaking processes may therefore be particularly well informed by <b>research</b> <b>evidence</b> compared to others. The aims of the present article are to explore <b>the</b> use of <b>research</b> <b>evidence</b> in health-enhancing physical activity (HEPA) policies, identify when <b>research</b> <b>evidence</b> was used, and find what other types of evidence were employed in HEPA policymaking. METHODS: Multidisciplinary teams from six EU member states analysed <b>the</b> use of <b>research</b> <b>evidence</b> and other kinds of evidence in 21 HEPA policies and interviewed 86 key policymakers involved in the policies. Qualitative content analysis was conducted on both policy documents and interview data. RESULTS: <b>Research</b> <b>evidence</b> was mostly used to justify the creation of HEPA policies and, generally, implicitly without citation. The policies analysed used many types of evidence other than citable <b>research.</b> <b>The</b> <b>evidence</b> used in HEPA policies was found to fall into the following categories: societal framework, media, everyday knowledge and intuition, <b>research</b> <b>evidence,</b> and other types of <b>evidence.</b> CONCLUSIONS: <b>Research</b> <b>evidence</b> seems to be the only type of evidence used in policymaking. Competition between the use of other types of <b>evidence</b> and <b>research</b> <b>evidence</b> is constant due to the various sources of information on the Internet and elsewhere. However, researchers need to understand their role in translating <b>research</b> <b>evidence</b> into policymaking processes...|$|R

40|$|AbstractBackgroundA {{breadth of}} {{literature}} exists that explores <b>the</b> utilization of <b>research</b> <b>evidence</b> in policy change processes. From this work, {{a number of}} studies suggest <b>research</b> <b>evidence</b> is applied to change processes by policy change stakeholders primarily through instrumental, conceptual, and/or symbolic applications, or is not used at all. Despite <b>the</b> expansiveness of <b>research</b> on policy change processes, a deficit exists in understanding <b>the</b> role of <b>research</b> <b>evidence</b> during change processes related to the implementation of structural interventions for HIV prevention among injection drug users (IDU). This study examined <b>the</b> role of <b>research</b> <b>evidence</b> in policy change processes for the implementation of publicly funded syringe exchange services in three US cities: Baltimore, MD, Philadelphia, PA, and Washington, DC. MethodsIn-depth qualitative interviews were conducted with key stakeholders (n= 29) from each of the study cities. Stakeholders were asked about the historical, social, political, and scientific contexts in their city during the policy change process. Interviews were transcribed and analyzed for common themes pertaining to applications of <b>research</b> <b>evidence.</b> ResultsIn Baltimore and Philadelphia, the typological approaches (instrumental and symbolic/conceptual, respectively) to <b>the</b> applications of <b>research</b> <b>evidence</b> used by harm reduction proponents contributed to the momentum for securing policy change for the implementation of syringe exchange services. Applications of <b>research</b> <b>evidence</b> were less successful in DC because policymakers had differing ideas about the implications of syringe exchange program implementation and because opponents of policy change used evidence incorrectly or not at all in policy change discussions. ConclusionTypological applications of <b>research</b> <b>evidence</b> are useful for understanding policy change processes, but their efficacy falls short when sociopolitical factors complicate legislative processes. Advocates for harm reduction may benefit from understanding how to effectively integrate <b>research</b> <b>evidence</b> into policy change processes in ways that confront the myriad of factors that influence policy change...|$|R
