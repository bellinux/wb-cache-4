5|$|Sperm whales {{can live}} 70 years or more. They are {{a prime example}} of a species that has been K-selected, meaning <b>their</b> <b>reproductive</b> {{strategy}} is associated with stable environmental conditions and comprises a low birth rate, significant parental aid to offspring, slow maturation, and high longevity.|$|E
5|$|As {{with other}} mammals, {{domestic}} sheep reproduction occurs sexually. <b>Their</b> <b>reproductive</b> strategy {{is very similar}} to other domestic herd animals. A flock of sheep is generally mated by a single ram, which has either been chosen by a farmer or has established dominance through physical contest with other rams (in feral populations). Most sheep have a breeding season (tupping) in the autumn, though some are able to breed year-round.|$|E

5|$|The major phyla (sometimes called divisions) of fungi {{have been}} {{classified}} {{mainly on the}} basis of characteristics of <b>their</b> sexual <b>reproductive</b> structures. Currently, seven phyla are proposed: Microsporidia, Chytridiomycota, Blastocladiomycota, Neocallimastigomycota, Glomeromycota, Ascomycota, and Basidiomycota.|$|R
5|$|During the {{breeding}} season, the American white ibis gathers in huge colonies near water. Pairs are predominantly monogamous and both parents {{care for the}} young, although males tend to engage in extra-pair copulation with other females to increase <b>their</b> <b>reproductive</b> success. Males have also been found to pirate food from unmated females and juveniles during {{the breeding}} season.|$|E
5|$|Males’ sexual {{maturation}} is triggered by an increased proportion {{of light in}} the photoperiod, such that they are sexually mature when they colonize the field when the crop reaches leaf development. More specifically, a day length of 16h is required for the weevils to terminate <b>their</b> <b>reproductive</b> diapause. An optimal day length of 18h is found to induce diapause termination.|$|E
5|$|Very rarely, {{female worker}} bees lay eggs that escape worker policing, {{in a process}} known as the anarchic syndrome. Female {{reproductive}} workers in these colonies activate their ovaries even {{in the presence of a}} queen. The worker eggs are allowed as they mimic queen hydrocarbons. Thus, female workers can maximize <b>their</b> <b>reproductive</b> fitness at the expense of the colony. Anarchic syndrome is an example of selection working in opposite directions at individual and group levels.|$|E
50|$|Despite <b>their</b> unusual <b>reproductive</b> habits, {{little is}} known about these species. Historically they have proven very {{difficult}} to keep alive in aquaria, although recent success with K. gulliveri has been achieved by Tokyo Sea Life Park in Japan.|$|R
25|$|Parasitic castrators feed on <b>their</b> host's <b>reproductive</b> tissues, leaving other bodily {{processes}} largely intact, {{and therefore}} ensuring the host's survival {{and the freedom}} of the parasite to remain in the host body {{for as long as the}} host continues to live.|$|R
50|$|Like all bats, silver-haired bats are {{vulnerable}} to population threats because of <b>their</b> inherently low <b>reproductive</b> rate.|$|R
5|$|Frequent {{cyclones}} also pose a threat, {{particularly to}} concentrated or small populations. In late January 1997, Cyclone Gretelle destroyed 80% of the Manombo forest canopy. With their habitat, including {{most of their}} food resources, effectively destroyed, the ruffed lemurs of the forest broadened their diet, remaining surprisingly frugivorous. Their body weights dropped and no births were reported for four years, but they managed to stave off starvation. This event demonstrated not only their flexibility {{in the face of}} natural disasters, which may highlight the evolutionary reasons behind <b>their</b> <b>reproductive</b> capacity and litter size, but also the threat faced by already stressed populations.|$|E
5|$|Mecopterans mostly inhabit moist environments {{although}} a few species are found in semi-desert habitats. Scorpionflies, family Panorpidae, generally live in broad-leaf woodlands with plentiful damp leaf litter. Snow scorpionflies, family Boreidae, appear in winter and are to be seen on snowfields and on moss; the larvae being able to jump like fleas. Hangingflies, family Bittacidae, occur in forests, grassland and caves with high moisture levels. They mostly breed among mosses, in leaf litter and other moist places, but <b>their</b> <b>reproductive</b> habits have been little studied, {{and at least one}} species, Nannochorista philpotti, has aquatic larvae.|$|E
5|$|Populations of Bengal and Sunda {{slow lorises}} are not faring well in zoos. Of the 29captive {{specimens}} in North American zoos in 2008, several are hybrids that cannot breed, while most are past <b>their</b> <b>reproductive</b> years. The last captive birth for these species in North America was in 2001 in San Diego. Pygmy slow lorises are doing better in North American zoos; {{from the late}} 1980s (when they were imported) to 2008, the population grew to 74 animals, with most of them born at the San Diego Zoo.|$|E

50|$|Tuf {{at first}} {{reasonably}} proposes that the Suthlamese simply restrict <b>their</b> incontinent <b>reproductive</b> practices, {{but because the}} Suthlamese fixation is religious, it is impervious to reason. They will not control their population growth, and thus drive obsessively into a suicidal future of starvation and war.|$|R
50|$|In {{the case}} of {{self-organizing}} living systems, usefully organized complexity comes from beneficially mutated organisms being selected to survive by their environment for <b>their</b> differential <b>reproductive</b> ability or at least success over inanimate matter or less organized complex organisms. See e.g. Robert Ulanowicz's treatment of ecosystems.|$|R
5|$|Prey {{mobility}} {{could also}} explain the initial development of aposematic signaling. If prey have characteristics {{that make them}} more exposed to predators, such as when some dendrobatids shifted from nocturnal to diurnal behavior, then they have more reason to develop aposematism. After the switch, the frogs had greater ecological opportunities, causing dietary specialization to arise. Thus, aposematism {{is not merely a}} signaling system, but a way for organisms to gain greater access to resources and increase <b>their</b> <b>reproductive</b> success.|$|E
5|$|Some plants {{reportedly}} rely {{on using}} intoxicating chemicals to produce inebriated bees, and use this inebriation {{as part of}} <b>their</b> <b>reproductive</b> strategy. One plant that some claim uses this mechanism is the South American bucket orchid (Coryanthes sp.), an epiphyte. The bucket orchid attracts male euglossine bees with its scent, derived {{from a variety of}} aromatic compounds. The bees store these compounds in specialized spongy pouches inside their swollen hind legs, as they appear to use the scent (or derivatives thereof) in order to attract females.|$|E
5|$|Varroa {{destructor}} is a parasitic mite that colonizes beehives and preys on {{honey bees}} by consuming their hemolymph. Varroa mites parasitize {{all types of}} honey bees (workers, nurse bees, larvae) depending on their life cycle stage. During the phoretic stage, Varroa prefer to attach to nurse bees as this results in higher fitness leading into the reproductive stage. The mites then feed on larvae during <b>their</b> <b>reproductive</b> stage and increased fitness leads {{to an increase in}} mite fecundity (# of female offspring). Due to Varroas ability to feed on all types of honey bees, they are one of the biggest threats to colonies, especially over winter.|$|E

50|$|L. lineolaris utilize {{cotton plants}} {{as one of}} <b>their</b> main <b>reproductive</b> hosts.

5|$|A {{number of}} health and medical {{research}} advocates, such as the Society for Women's Health Research in the United States, support this broader definition, rather than merely issues specific to human female anatomy to include areas where biological sex differences {{between women and men}} exist. Women also need health care more and access the health care system more than do men. While part of this is due to <b>their</b> <b>reproductive</b> and sexual health needs, they also have more chronic non-reproductive health issues such as cardiovascular disease, cancer, mental illness, diabetes and osteoporosis. Another important perspective is realising that events across the entire life cycle (or life-course), from in utero to aging effect the growth, development and health of women. The life-course perspective {{is one of the key}} strategies of the World Health Organization.|$|E
5|$|As Captain Jean-Luc Picard (Patrick Stewart) {{attempts}} {{to negotiate with}} the Aldeans, they briefly allow Dr. Crusher to reunite with her son on the planet. Wesley hints about the Custodian to her, while she secretly passes him a tricorder to scan the Aldeans. After Picard fails to get the Aldeans to agree to the children's return, they fire an energy weapon that sends the Enterprise three days away from Aldea at maximum warp. The Aldeans warn that they can send the Enterprise an impossibly far distance if they refuse to cooperate. During the return trip, Dr. Crusher reviews the scanner results and finds the Aldeans are suffering from radiation poisoning, which has harmed <b>their</b> <b>reproductive</b> capabilities but can be reversed if the source is discovered. On arrival back at the planet, Picard orders the crew {{to try to find a}} way through the planet's shield while he restarts negotiations.|$|E
5|$|Both sexes have genital slits on the {{underside}} of their bodies. The male can retract and conceal his penis through his slit. The female's slit houses her vagina and anus. Females have two mammary slits, each housing one nipple, one {{on each side of the}} genital slit. The ability to stow <b>their</b> <b>reproductive</b> organs (especially in males) allows for maximum hydrodynamics. The breeding season produces significant physiological changes in males. At that time, the testes enlarge, enabling them to hold more sperm. Large amounts of sperm allow a male to wash away the previous suitor's sperm, while leaving some of his own for fertilization. Also, sperm concentration markedly increases. Having less sperm for out-of-season social mating means it wastes less. This suggests sperm production is energetically expensive. Males have large testes in relation to their body size.|$|E
30|$|By {{comparing}} reproductive {{traits of}} lab-reared full-sib brothers {{of different ages}} in <b>their</b> first <b>reproductive</b> season (i.e. first nest building), the present study revealed that an advanced age can have considerable consequences on the expression of reproductive traits in three-spined sticklebacks, which might have an influence in inter- as well as intra-sexual contexts.|$|R

5|$|Brood parasitism, {{in which}} an egg-layer leaves her eggs with another individual's brood, is more common among birds than {{any other type of}} organism. After a {{parasitic}} bird lays her eggs in another bird's nest, they are often accepted and raised by the host {{at the expense of the}} host's own brood. Brood parasites may be either obligate brood parasites, which must lay their eggs in the nests of other species because they are incapable of raising their own young, or non-obligate brood parasites, which sometimes lay eggs in the nests of conspecifics to increase <b>their</b> <b>reproductive</b> output even though they could have raised their own young. One hundred bird species, including honeyguides, icterids, and ducks, are obligate parasites, though the most famous are the cuckoos. Some brood parasites are adapted to hatch before their host's young, which allows them to destroy the host's eggs by pushing them out of the nest or to kill the host's chicks; this ensures that all food brought to the nest will be fed to the parasitic chicks.|$|E
5|$|Indirect mutualisms occur {{where the}} organisms live apart. For example, trees {{living in the}} {{equatorial}} regions of the planet supply oxygen into the atmosphere that sustains species living in distant polar regions of the planet. This relationship is called commensalism; because, many others receive the benefits of clean air at no cost or harm to trees supplying the oxygen. If the associate benefits while the host suffers, the relationship is called parasitism. Although parasites impose a cost to their host (e.g., via damage to <b>their</b> <b>reproductive</b> organs or propagules, denying {{the services of a}} beneficial partner), their net effect on host fitness is not necessarily negative and, thus, becomes difficult to forecast. Co-evolution is also driven by competition among species or among members of the same species under the banner of reciprocal antagonism, such as grasses competing for growth space. The Red Queen Hypothesis, for example, posits that parasites track down and specialize on the locally common genetic defense systems of its host that drives the evolution of sexual reproduction to diversify the genetic constituency of populations responding to the antagonistic pressure.|$|E
5|$|Nunn and Zino {{estimated}} that the two Macaronesian species diverged {{at the end of}} the Early Pleistocene, 850,000 years ago. An analysis of feather lice taken from Fea's petrels, Pterodroma feae deserti, from Bugio Island, and from Zino's petrels from the Madeiran mainland showed that there were marked differences between the two seabirds in terms of the parasites they carried, suggesting that they have long been isolated, since lice can normally only be transferred through physical contact in the nest. The species on Zino's petrel are most similar to those of the Bermuda petrel, whereas Fea's petrel's lice are like those of Caribbean and Pacific Pterodroma species. This suggests that despite the close physical proximity of the two species of gadfly petrel found in the Madeiran archipelago, they may have arisen from separate colonisations of mainland Madeira and, later, the Desertas Islands. Although <b>their</b> <b>reproductive</b> isolation has allowed the separate evolutionary development of the two species, genetic evidence shows the three Macaronesian petrels are each other's closest relatives.|$|E
50|$|Red {{king crabs}} have an 11-month brood cycle in <b>their</b> first <b>reproductive</b> {{year and a}} 12-month cycle thereafter. Both red and blue king crabs have planktotrophic larvae that undergo 4 zoeal stages {{in the water column}} and a non-feeding, glaucothoe stage which is an {{intermediate}} stage which seeks appropriate habitat on the sea floor.|$|R
5|$|According to {{inclusive}} fitness theory, organisms {{can gain}} fitness not just through increasing <b>their</b> own <b>reproductive</b> output, {{but also that}} of close relatives. In evolutionary terms, individuals should help relatives when Cost < Relatedness * Benefit. The requirements for eusociality are more easily fulfilled by haplodiploid species such as bees because of their unusual relatedness structure.|$|R
