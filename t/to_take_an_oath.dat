5|$|John Sigismund {{was born}} in Buda on 7 July 1540. On {{learning}} of his birth, his father, who was on campaign in Transylvania, rode to his soldiers' camp to inform them of the good news. The following day John fell ill, and he died on 21 or 22 July. Before his death he persuaded those present at his death bed <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>an</b> <b>oath</b> that they would prevent the transfer of his realm to Ferdinand.|$|E
5|$|Emeric, Stephen's {{only son}} to survive infancy, {{died in an}} {{accident}} in 1031. Stephen's cousin Vazul had the strongest claim to the throne, but the King overlooked him and named Peter as his heir. On Stephen's order, Vazul was blinded shortly thereafter and his three sonsLevente, Andrew and Béla exiled, which strengthened Peter's right of succession. The King asked Peter <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>an</b> <b>oath</b> respecting the property of his wife, Queen Giselle, suggesting that Peter's relationship with his aunt was tense.|$|E
5|$|Morehead {{returned}} {{to his home in}} Louisville, but feared his refusal <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>an</b> <b>oath</b> of allegiance to the Constitution would lead to another arrest. In June 1862, he fled to Canada, then to Europe, and finally to Mexico. Following the war, Morehead {{returned to}} the United States and lived on his plantation in Greenville, Mississippi. He died there on December 21, 1868 and was buried on the grounds. On May 31, 1879, he was reburied in the Frankfort Cemetery in Frankfort, Kentucky.|$|E

50|$|The first {{graduate}} from the University of Glasgow who was openly known to be Jewish was Levi Myers, in 1787. Unlike their English contemporaries, Scottish students were not required <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> religious <b>oath.</b>|$|R
50|$|He {{was known}} for his {{judicial}} conservative philosophical leanings and is noted in country's political history for providing legality for the martial law upheld by chief of army staff General Zia-ul-Haq to restore law and order, in the light of doctrine of necessity, as part of his conservative leanings. In addition, he also heard the case of Zulfikar Ali Bhutto and controversially upheld the capital sentence by the Lahore High Court for authorizing the murder of a political opponent. In 1981, Haq notably refused <b>to</b> <b>taken</b> <b>an</b> <b>oath</b> under the imposed PCO, resigning on conscientious grounds.|$|R
5|$|Antisemitic {{legislation}} passed in 1933 {{led to the}} removal all of Jewish teachers, professors and officials from the education system. Most teachers were required {{to belong to the}} Nationalsozialistischer Lehrerbund (National Socialist Teachers League; NSLB) and university professors were required to join the National Socialist German Lecturers. Teachers had <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>an</b> <b>oath</b> of loyalty and obedience to Hitler and those who failed to show sufficient conformity to party ideals were often reported by students or fellow teachers and dismissed. Lack of funding for salaries led to many teachers leaving the profession and the average class size increased from 37 in 1927 to 43 in 1938 due to the resulting teacher shortage.|$|E
5|$|Taking {{advantage}} of internal conflicts which {{emerged in the}} Holy Roman Empire after Emperor Otto I's death, Géza invaded Bavaria and took the fortress of Melk in 983. In 991, the Bavarians launched a counter-attack which forced Géza to withdraw Hungarian forces from the territories east of the Vienna Woods. Furthermore, he renounced the lands east of the river Leitha in his peace treaty of 996 with Henry IV of Bavaria. Géza also arranged the marriage of his son and heir Stephen to Henry IV's sister Giselle. Even before this marriage alliance, Géza convoked the Hungarian leaders to an assembly and forced them <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>an</b> <b>oath</b> confirming his son's right to succeed him.|$|E
5|$|To {{prevent any}} action against his testament's {{provisions}} for his son's succession and the regency, Theodore {{on his deathbed}} demanded an oath to be taken by Senate, army, people and clergy, both those present at court and those absent elsewhere in the state. Immediately after his death, George Mouzalon, aware of his vulnerability and his complete lack of support, called an assembly of the leading nobles, officials, and military commanders. He offered to resign from his post in favour of any person that the assembly chose, but the dignitaries, led by Michael Palaiologos, dissuaded him and encouraged him to stay on and even accepted <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>an</b> <b>oath</b> of loyalty to him {{as well as to}} the young emperor. It was a sham, as a conspiracy by the leading aristocratic families was well under way to depose him, in which Palaiologos apparently played a covert but leading role.|$|E
50|$|In 1862, {{during the}} Civil War, he refused on {{principle}} <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> test <b>oath</b> for lawyers {{of loyalty to}} the Union cause (as did Virginia-born James D. Thornton), which led to his semi-retirement from the Bar.|$|R
5|$|Privy {{counsellors}} {{can choose}} to affirm their allegiance in similar terms should they prefer not <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> religious <b>oath.</b> At the induction ceremony, the order of precedence places Anglicans (being those of the established church) before others.|$|R
25|$|The Humanist Association of Ireland ran {{a series}} of {{advertisements}} on Dublin commuter trains which they called the Unbelievable Campaign. The campaign was to highlight that judges and the president have <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>a</b> religious <b>oath,</b> which effectively stops 250,000 people from taking these posts.|$|R
5|$|When Ladislaus IV {{was murdered}} in 1290, the Holy See {{declared}} the kingdom a vacant fief. Although Rome granted the kingdom to his sister's son, Charles Martel, crown prince of the Kingdom of Naples, {{the majority of the}} Hungarian lords chose Andrew, the grandson of AndrewII and son of a prince of dubious legitimacy. Andrew became the first monarch <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>an</b> <b>oath</b> respecting the liberties of the Church and the nobility before his coronation. He regularly convoked the prelates, the lords and the noblemen's representatives to assemblies known as Diets, which started to develop into a legislative body. By 1300, when the kingdom had disintegrated into autonomous provinces ruled by powerful noblemen (including Matthew Csák, Ladislaus Kán, and Amadeus Aba), the Croatian lord, Paul I Šubić of Bribir, dared to invite the late Charles Martel's son, the twelve-year-old Charles Robert, to Hungary. The young pretender was marching from Croatia towards Buda when AndrewIII unexpectedly died on January 14, 1301.|$|E
5|$|The {{election}} sejm of 1632 eventually {{concluded in}} the election of Władysław; he had no serious other contenders. The decision on {{who would be the}} Commonwealth's next king was reached on 8 November, but as the pacta conventa were not yet ready, the official announcement was delayed until 13 November. In the pacta conventa, Władysław pledged himself to fund a military school and equipment; {{to find a way to}} fund a naval fleet; to maintain current alliances; not to raise armies, give offices or military ranks to foreigners, negotiate peace treaties or declare war without the Sejm's approval; not to take a wife without the Senate's approval; to convince his brothers <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>an</b> <b>oath</b> to the Commonwealth; and to transfer the profits from the Royal Mint to the Royal Treasury rather than to a private treasury. When the election result had been announced by the Crown Grand Marshal, Łukasz Opaliński, the nobility (szlachta), who had taken part {{in the election}}, began festivities in honor of the new king, which lasted three hours. Władysław was crowned in the Wawel Cathedral, in Kraków on 6 February in the following year.|$|E
5|$|In mid-1812, Russia and the Ottoman Empire {{signed the}} Treaty of Bucharest, {{bringing}} the Russo-Ottoman War to a close. For his efforts, Karađorđe received the Order of Saint Anna from the Russians. The Governing Council scrambled <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>an</b> <b>oath</b> {{of loyalty to}} Russia {{in the hope that}} this would garner them further protection, to no avail. The Russian Emperor, Alexander, was aware of Napoleon's plans to invade Russia and desperately sought to return as many Russian soldiers as possible in order to repel the attack. As part of the Treaty of Bucharest, the Russians and Ottomans agreed that Serbian fortifications built after 1804 were to be destroyed, while cities and forts from which the Ottomans had been expelled {{over the course of the}} uprising were to be reoccupied and garrisoned by Ottoman troops. In exchange, the Ottomans agreed to declare a general amnesty for former rebels, as well as to grant the Serbs of the Pashalik of Belgrade some degree of autonomy. As part of the agreement, the Russians agreed to withdraw their forces from Serbia, as well as from Wallachia and Moldavia. The Russians encouraged Karađorđe and his followers to negotiate directly with the Porte regarding the minutiae of the handover of cities and fortifications to the Ottomans. Trepidation filled the rebel camp once it became clear that there was nothing to prevent the Ottomans from exacting reprisals against the Pashalik's Serb population after the Russians withdrew. Karađorđe thus refused to abide by the terms of the Treaty of Bucharest and fighting continued.|$|E

60|$|This {{explanation}} was satisfactory, to Albert's great joy; for the wily knight had foreseen the great difficulty, or rather impossibility, of prevailing upon Brian de Bois-Guilbert <b>to</b> <b>take</b> such <b>an</b> <b>oath</b> before the assembly, and had invented this excuse {{to escape the}} necessity of his doing so.|$|R

5|$|The President {{is elected}} {{on the basis}} of {{universal}} suffrage, through a secret ballot, for a five-year term. If no candidate in the elections secures more than 50% of all votes cast (including blank and spoilt ballots), a runoff election is held. The Constitution of Croatia sets a limit of a maximum of two terms in office. The president-elect is required <b>to</b> <b>take</b> <b>an</b> <b>oath</b> of office before the judges of the Constitutional Court. Franjo Tuđman won the first Croatian presidential elections in 1992 and 1997. During his time in office, the constitution adopted in 1990 provided for a semi-presidential system, which was in the coming years further strengthened by laws specifically aimed at providing Tuđman with sweeping powers (e.g. naming and dismissing numerous government officials, confirming county prefects), as his HDZ party held a supermajority in parliament through out the 1990s. After his death in 1999, the constitution was amended and many presidential powers were transferred to parliament, the prime minister and the government. Stjepan Mesić won two consecutive terms, in 2000 and in 2005 and served as president until 2010. Ivo Josipović won the presidential elections held in 2009–2010 and left office in 2015 after losing his reelection bid for a second term. The winner of the most recent presidential elections, held in December 2014 and January 2015, was Kolinda Grabar-Kitarović. She succeeded Josipović on 19 February 2015 for a term lasting until 18 February 2020.|$|E
