5|$|Pan frying (or shallow frying) {{requires}} {{a frying pan}} of sturdy construction {{and a source of}} fat that does not fully immerse the chicken. The chicken pieces are prepared as above, then fried. Generally the fat is heated to a temperature hot enough to seal (without browning, at this point) the outside of the chicken pieces. Once the pieces {{have been added to the}} hot fat and sealed, the temperature is reduced. There is debate as to how often to turn the chicken pieces, with one camp arguing for often turning and even browning, and the other camp pushing for letting the pieces render skin side down and only turning when absolutely necessary. Once the chicken pieces are close to being done the temperature is raised and the pieces are browned to the desired color (some cooks add small amounts of butter at this point to enhance browning). The moisture from the chicken <b>that</b> <b>sticks</b> and browns on the bottom of the pan become the fonds required to make gravy.|$|E
25|$|In {{species that}} {{lay their eggs}} in rafts, rafts do not form adventitiously; the female Culex settles {{carefully}} on still water with its hind legs crossed, and as it lays the eggs one by one, it twitches to arrange them into a head-down array <b>that</b> <b>sticks</b> together to form the raft.|$|E
25|$|The series spans 50 {{years of}} Quatermain's life, from 18 to 68; {{at the start}} of the {{foundation}} novel King Solomon's Mines, he has just turned 55. Physically, he is small, wiry, and unattractive, with a beard and short hair <b>that</b> <b>sticks</b> up. His one skill is his marksmanship, where he has no equal. Quatermain is aware that as a professional hunter, he has helped to destroy his beloved wild free places of Africa. In old age he hunts without pleasure, having no other means of making a living.|$|E

50|$|One {{important}} {{idea when}} evaluating the friction behavior within a fracture {{is the impact}} of asperities, which are the irregularities <b>that</b> <b>stick</b> out from the rough surfaces of fractures. Since both faces have bumps and pieces <b>that</b> <b>stick</b> out, not all of the fracture face is actually touching the other face. The cumulative impact of asperities is a reduction of the real area of contact, which is important when establishing frictional forces.|$|R
25|$|When {{conditions}} turn unfavourable, usually upon {{depletion of}} nutrients, diatom cells typically increase in sinking rate and exit the upper mixed layer ("bust"). This sinking is induced by either {{a loss of}} buoyancy control, the synthesis of mucilage <b>that</b> <b>sticks</b> diatoms cells together, or the production of heavy resting spores. Sinking out of the upper mixed layer removes diatoms from conditions unfavourable to growth, including grazer populations and higher temperatures (which would otherwise increase cell metabolism). Cells reaching deeper water or the shallow seafloor can then rest until conditions become more favourable again. In the open ocean, many sinking cells are lost to the deep, but refuge populations can persist near the thermocline.|$|E
25|$|Many {{species of}} {{cockatoo}} – which even if {{able to be}} banded require special bands to fit the unique shape of their legs – will crush bands with their powerful bills and claws. The ability to overcome this problem varies between species, and with some such as the Gang-gang cockatoo, it {{is known to be}} too dangerous to attempt banding. New World vultures also cannot be banded on their legs because they urinate onto their legs, causing corrosion of the bands into a powdery oxide <b>that</b> <b>sticks</b> to the vulture’s leg and injures the bird. Dippers are also dangerously handicapped by ringing because the rings induce drag that makes it extremely difficult for them to catch prey in fast-flowing water.|$|E
25|$|During snowfalls when {{temperatures}} hover {{close to}} freezing, northern {{parts of the}} city, such as around Derry Road away from warmer Lake Ontario usually get more snow <b>that</b> <b>sticks</b> to the ground because of the lower temperatures. The reverse occurs when a strong storm approaches from the south kicking up lake effect snow, bringing higher snowfall totals to south Mississauga. The city usually experiences 6 months of snow free weather however there is the odd occurrence where snow does fall either in October or May. The Port Credit and Lakeview areas have a micro-climate more affected by {{the proximity of the}} open lake, warming winter temperatures as a result but it can be sharply cooler on spring and summer afternoons, this can also be the case in Clarkson, but with much less consistency.|$|E

25|$|Starting {{with the}} 2008 National Electrical Code and the 2009 Canadian Electrical Code, listed {{tamper-resistant}} receptacles that address electric shock hazards to children {{must now be}} installed in almost all areas of new or renovated dwellings. According to statistics cited by the NFPA, the code change adds only $40 {{to the cost of}} building an average, 75-receptacle home in the US, yet prevents shock hazards to a child <b>that</b> <b>sticks</b> a single, metal object into the receptacle. The new receptacles are expected {{to reduce the number of}} electric shocks to children because inserting a normal, two-blade electrical plug applies pressure on both sides of the receptacle to open an internal, spring-loaded shutter, but a foreign object fails to do so and therefore does not make contact with the live electrical contacts. However, the device can still be defeated by inserting two objects simultaneously. Despite its weaknesses, the tamper-resistant receptacle is superior to protective plastic outlet caps which must be individually installed on each receptacle (and are a choking hazard when removed), and to sliding covers that children easily learn to defeat.|$|E
500|$|Blast Magazine {{columnist}} Christopher Peck {{was disappointed}} that the writers had not yet revealed {{the reason for the}} Evil Queen's grudge, commenting, [...] "If the thing <b>that</b> <b>sticks</b> out most about an episode of television is what I didn’t get out, that’s an ominous sign: a foreshadowing that the show has no goddamn clue where it’s headed." [...] He did however enjoy seeing Graham's memories, calling them and the other series flashbacks [...] "the freshest and most thrilling part of the show."

500|$|The single's lyrics cover {{a variety}} of issues, ranging from [...] "body image, class division, an unhappy {{marriage}} and alcoholism". [...] "Ugly" [...] opens with Fantasia narrating a tragic story about {{a woman with a}} “picket fence, two-car garage and a man that she don’t love”. The narrative's rural setting is established through the lyrics, “Gimme that rusty old grain silo”. Fantasia advocates for female empowerment and explores expectations regarding beauty with lyrics like: [...] "With dirt on my hands and scrapes on my knees/Feeling like nothing can wash it off clean/Tell your girls it’s a beautiful thing/Just trust me/It’s far from ugly.” The lyrics also feature the importance of love, with Fantasia singing, “Thank you for that good good man who loves me.” Alex Mcpherson interpreted Fantasia's delivery of the lyric “Give me good food <b>that</b> <b>sticks</b> to my bones” as incorporating gospel elements into the song. [...] "Ugly" [...] ends with Fantasia discussing her life immediately after winning the third season of American Idol.|$|E

It is also the memory of Professor Bernard Quatermass grappling with the pulsating giant plant that threatened to destroy the world from its rooting place in the Abbey's nave… The Quatermass Experiment frightened the life out of a vast new generation of television viewers whose sets had been acquired in order to watch the Coronation… Quatermass {{was one of the first}} series on British television to make life seem potentially terrifying." ...|$|E

Vin Diesel was considered to portray Daredevil before him, but he opted to take a role in another film. In a February 2011 interview, Guy Pearce said that he was offered the role but turned it down, stating that [...] "comic-strip stuff isn’t really my cup of tea, really." [...] Matt Damon also revealed that he was offered the role. [...] He claimed that he and Ben [...] "loved that comic book but I just didn't quite believe in the script or the director at the time." [...] Colin Farrell was also considered until Affleck signed. As a fan, Affleck made sure he had read every single issue of Daredevil, commenting that it was about taking what he knew as a fan and faithfully getting it on the screen. Joe Quesada considered it [...] "serendipity in action" [...] that Affleck is the lead role, as when he and Kevin Smith did the [...] series, they had modeled it on Affleck. Affleck said Daredevil was his favorite comic book as a kid, and explained why he took the role by saying [...] "Everybody has that one thing from childhood that they remember and <b>that</b> <b>sticks</b> with them.

[...] Additionally, he said, [...] "I didn't want someone else to do it, because I was afraid that they would go out and do it different from the comic and screw it up." ...|$|E

[...] It's an instrumental, it was a real collaboration and it just kind of came out of us in the studio, real improvised natural music, very simple. I think it's beautiful.
