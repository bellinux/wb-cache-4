5|$|The use {{of musical}} {{instruments}} in worship was a divisive topic within the Stone-Campbell Movement from its earliest years, when some adherents opposed the practice on scriptural grounds, while {{others may have}} relied on a cappella simply because they lacked access to musical instruments.

5|$|When dinosaurs appeared, {{they were}} not the {{dominant}} terrestrial animals. The terrestrial habitats were occupied by various types of archosauromorphs and therapsids, like cynodonts and rhynchosaurs. Their main competitors were the pseudosuchia, such as aetosaurs, ornithosuchids and rauisuchians, which were more successful than the dinosaurs. Most of these other animals became extinct in the Triassic, in one of two events. First, at about 215million years ago, a variety of basal archosauromorphs, including the protorosaurs, became extinct. This was followed by the Triassic–Jurassic extinction event (about 200million years ago), that saw the end of most of the other groups of early archosaurs, like aetosaurs, ornithosuchids, phytosaurs, and rauisuchians. Rhynchosaurs and dicynodonts survived (at least in some areas) at least as late as early-mid Norian and early Rhaetian, respectively, and the exact date of their extinction is uncertain. These losses left behind a land fauna of crocodylomorphs, dinosaurs, mammals, pterosaurians, and turtles. The first few lines of early dinosaurs diversified through the Carnian and Norian stages of the Triassic, possibly by occupying the niches of <b>the</b> <b>groups</b> <b>that</b> became extinct.|$|E
5|$|Afterward, the PSC {{largely ignored}} the lease plan {{since it was}} still focused on {{building}} {{the first phase of}} the Dual Contracts. The Flushing Business Men's Association kept advocating for the Amity Street subway, causing a schism between them and the rest of <b>the</b> <b>groups</b> <b>that</b> supported the LIRR lease. Through the summer of 1915, the PSC and the LIRR negotiated the planned lease to $125,000 a first year, , with an eight percent increase each year; the negotiations then stalled in 1916. The Whitestone Improvement Association, impatient with the pace of negotiations, approved of the subway under Amity Street even though it would not serve them directly. The PSC's chief engineer wrote in a report that a combined 20,600 riders would use the Whitestone and Bayside lines each day in either direction, and that by 1927, there would be 34,000 riders per day per direction. The Third Ward Rapid Transit Association wrote a report showing how much they had petitioned for Flushing subway extensions to that point, compared to how little progress they had made in doing so. Negotiations continued to be stalled in 1917. Despite the line not having been extended past Corona yet, the idea of a subway extension to Little Neck encouraged development there.|$|E
40|$|AbstractTo {{determine}} whether a weight-adjusted high dose (2 mg/kg body weight over 3 h) rapid infusion of recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator (rt-PA) was more efficacious than a weight-adjusted standard dose (1. 25 mg/kg over 3 h) in achieving reperfusion {{in the setting of}} acute myocardial infarction, 175 patients were entered into a randomized multicenter trial. Eighty-four patients were entered into <b>the</b> high dose <b>group,</b> receiving 1. 2 mg/kg (10 % given as a bolus injection) over 1 h, followed by 0. 8 mg/kg over the next 2 h. Ninety-one patients were given 0. 75 mg/kg (10 % given as a bolus injection) in 1 h, followed by 0. 5 mg/kg administered over the next 2 h. The median dose in <b>the</b> <b>group</b> <b>that</b> received 2 mg/kg dose was 145 mg, compared with 100 mg in <b>the</b> <b>group</b> <b>that</b> received 1. 25 mg/kg. The 90 min patency rate in <b>the</b> <b>group</b> <b>that</b> received 2 mg/kg was 84 % compared with 70 % in <b>the</b> <b>group</b> <b>that</b> received 1. 25 mg/kg (p = 0. 003). Sixty-four percent of the patients in each group underwent coronary angioplasty at the time of cardiac catheterization. The infarct-related artery patency rate at the end of catheterization was 91 % in <b>the</b> <b>group</b> <b>that</b> received 2 mg/kg compared with 83 % in <b>the</b> <b>group</b> <b>that</b> received 1. 25 mg/kg (p = 0. 08). Among patients with a patent infarct-related coronary artery after catheterization, the 6 month mortality rate in <b>the</b> <b>group</b> <b>that</b> received 2 mg/kg was 2. 9 % compared with 9. 8 % in <b>the</b> <b>group</b> <b>that</b> received 1. 25 mg/kg (p = 0. 15). The bleeding complication rate in <b>the</b> two <b>groups</b> was similar. Two patients in <b>the</b> <b>group</b> <b>that</b> received 2 mg/kg developed nonfatal intracranial bleeding (one after emergency open heart surgery). These data suggest that more rapid administration of a higher weight-adjusted dose of rt-PA may be more effective in restoring infarct-related artery patency in the setting of acute myocardial Infarction than the currently accepted dose of 100 mg over 3 h. Larger randomized trials are warranted to evaluate the need for prolonged (> 60 to 90 min) infusions, optimal dosage and the risk of intracranial bleeding with more rapid rt-PA administration...|$|R

40|$|There is accumulating {{evidence}} that sleep {{as well as}} awake offline processing {{is important for the}} transformation of new experiences into long-term memory. Yet much remains to be understood about how various cognitive factors influence the efficiency of awake offline processing. In the present study we investigated how changes in attention and context in the immediate period after exposure to new visual information influences long-term memory consolidation. After presentation of multiple naturalistic scenes within a working memory paradigm, recognition was assessed 30 minutes and 24 hours later in three groups of subjects. One group of subjects engaged in a focused attention task (the Revised Attentional Network Task (R-ANT)) in the 30 minutes after exposure to <b>the</b> scenes. Another <b>group</b> of subjects remained in the testing room during the 30 minutes after scene exposure and engaged in no goal- or task-directed activities. A third group of subjects left the testing room and returned 30 minutes later. A signal detection analysis revealed no significant differences among <b>the</b> three <b>groups</b> in hits, false alarms, or sensitivity on the 30 -minute recognition task. At the 24 -hour recognition test, <b>the</b> <b>group</b> <b>that</b> performed <b>the</b> R-ANT made significantly fewer hits compared to <b>the</b> <b>group</b> <b>that</b> left <b>the</b> testing room and didn’t perform the attention ask. <b>The</b> <b>group</b> <b>that</b> performed <b>the</b> R-ANT and <b>the</b> <b>group</b> <b>that</b> remained in <b>the</b> testing room during the 30 -minute post-exposure interval made significantly fewer false alarms on the 24 -hour recognition test compared to <b>the</b> <b>group</b> <b>that</b> left <b>the</b> testing room. <b>The</b> <b>group</b> <b>that</b> stayed in <b>the</b> testing room and engaged in no goal- or task-directed activities exhibited significantly higher sensitivity (d’) compared to <b>the</b> <b>group</b> <b>that</b> left <b>the</b> testing room and <b>the</b> <b>group</b> <b>that</b> performed <b>the</b> R-ANT task. Staying in the same context after exposure to new information and resting quietly with minimal engagement of attention results in the best ability to distinguish old from novel visual stimuli after 24 hours. These findings suggest that changes in attentional demands and context during an immediate post-exposure offline processing interval modulate visual memory consolidation in a subtle but significant manner...|$|R
