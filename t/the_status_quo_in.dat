5|$|Contrary to expectations, the American bombing effort had not {{pulverized}} the Base Areas and {{had only}} tended to drive PAVN and the NLF deeper into the Cambodian countryside. This series of events began to pose questions for Hanoi. The North Vietnamese {{had been willing to}} maintain <b>the</b> <b>status</b> <b>quo</b> <b>in</b> Cambodia as long as their supply lines and sanctuaries were secure. But with the expansion of the war across the border they might have to take further steps to maintain their position.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{collapse}} of the Imperial army, the battle proved to be of little strategic significance. At the insistence of Francis I, the French army resumed the siege of Carignano, where Colonna held out for several weeks. Soon after the city's surrender, Enghien was forced to send twenty-three companies of Italian and Gascon infantry—and nearly half his heavy cavalry—to Picardy, which had been invaded by Charles V. Left without a real army, Enghien was unable to capture Milan. D'Avalos, meanwhile, routed a fresh force of Italian infantry under Pietro Strozzi and the Count of Pitigliano at the Battle of Serravalle. The end of the war saw a return to <b>the</b> <b>status</b> <b>quo</b> <b>in</b> northern Italy.|$|E
5|$|The Aleutian Islands played little {{part in the}} {{proceedings}} of World War I, as the events of this war were concentrated in Europe. In 1922, the Washington Naval Treaty was signed by the United States, the British Empire, the Empire of Japan, the French Third Republic, and the Kingdom of Italy. Article XIX of the Treaty required Japan, Britain and the United States to maintain <b>the</b> <b>status</b> <b>quo</b> <b>in</b> terms of military fortifications in their respective Pacific Rim territories. While Japan and Britain gained a number of exemptions from the terms of Article XIX (for example, Australia and New Zealand were not prevented from building up their fortifications {{as a result of}} the Treaty), Japan made it a requirement of their agreement to the Treaty that the Aleutian Islands were not to be exempted.|$|E

5|$|In {{the late}} 1930s, Stalin's Soviet Union {{was no longer}} {{satisfied}} with <b>the</b> <b>status</b> <b>quo</b> <b>in</b> its relations with Finland. This came {{as a result of}} a change in Soviet foreign policy, which now pursued the aim of recovering the provinces of Tsarist Russia lost during the chaos of the October Revolution and the Russian Civil War. The Soviets considered the old Empire to have had an optimal balance of security and territory, and their thoughts were shaped by a historical precedent: as the Treaty of Nystad of 1721 was intended to protect Tsarist Saint Petersburg from the Swedes, the re-acquisition of Finland would protect the now Bolshevik Leningrad from the rising power of Nazi Germany. While in 1938 Sweden was no longer a major threat against Russia, the Soviets had not forgotten the role that the Finnish-controlled Åland islands had played as a base of operations for the German Expeditionary Force in the Finnish Civil War.|$|E
5|$|Reflecting {{both the}} realist and liberal {{paradigms}} {{of international relations}} and the conception of national interests, {{a number of other}} important themes in Australian strategic culture are also obvious. Such themes include: an acceptance of the state as the key actor in international politics, the centrality of notions of Westphalian sovereignty, a belief in the enduring relevance and legitimacy of armed force as a guarantor of security, and the proposition that <b>the</b> <b>status</b> <b>quo</b> <b>in</b> international affairs should only be changed peacefully. Likewise, multilateralism, collective security and defence self-reliance have also been important themes. Change has been more evolutionary than revolutionary and these strategic behaviours have persisted throughout its history, being the product of Australian society's democratic political tradition and Judaeo-Christian Anglo-European heritage, as well its associated values, beliefs and economic, political and religious ideology. These behaviours are also reflective of its unique security dilemma as a largely European island {{on the edge of the}} Asia-Pacific, and the geopolitical circumstances of a middle power physically removed from the centres of world power. To be sure, during threats to the core Australia has often found itself defending the periphery and perhaps as a result, it has frequently become involved in foreign wars. Throughout these conflicts Australian soldiers—known colloquially as Diggers—have often been noted, somewhat paradoxically, for both their fighting abilities and their humanitarian qualities.|$|E
5|$|After {{the legions}} under Flamininus had {{returned}} to Italy, the Greek states were once again on their own. The dominant powers in the region at this time were the kingdom of Macedon, which had recently lost a war against Rome, the Aetolians, the strengthened Achaean League and a reduced Sparta. The Aetolians, who had opposed the Roman intervention in Greek affairs, incited Nabis to retake his former territories and position among the Greek powers. By 192, Nabis who had built a new fleet and strengthened his army, besieged Gythium. The Achaeans responded by sending an envoy to Rome with a request for help. In response the Senate sent the praetor Atilius with a navy to defeat Nabis' navy {{as well as an}} embassy headed by Flamininus. Instead of waiting for the Roman fleet to arrive, the Achaean army and navy headed towards Gythium under the command of Philopoemen. The Achaean fleet was defeated by the recently constructed Spartan fleet, with the Achean flagship falling to pieces in the first ramming attack. On land as well the Achaeans could not defeat the Spartan forces outside Gythium and Philopoemen retreated to Tegea. When Philopoemen reentered Laconia for a second attempt his forces were ambushed by Nabis' but nevertheless he managed to gain a victory. The Achaeans now could ravage Laconia for thirty days unopposed while the Spartan troops remained in their fortified city. Plans for capturing Sparta itself had been laid by the time the Roman envoy Flamininus arrived and convinced the Achaean strategus Philopoemen to spare it. For the time being Nabis decided to accept <b>the</b> <b>status</b> <b>quo</b> <b>in</b> return and surrender under the same conditions as the last treaty.|$|E

40|$|We {{present a}} general model of {{legislative}} bargaining <b>in</b> which <b>the</b> <b>status</b> <b>quo</b> is an arbitrary {{point in a}} multidimensional policy space. In contrast to other bargaining models, <b>the</b> <b>status</b> <b>quo</b> is not assumed to be bad for all legislators, and delay may be Pareto efficient. We prove existence of stationary equilibria. We show that if all legislators are risk averse or if even limited transfers are possible, then delay is only possible if <b>the</b> <b>status</b> <b>quo</b> lies <b>in</b> <b>the</b> core. Thus, we expect immediate agreement in multidimensional models, where the core is typically empty. In one dimension, delay is possible {{if and only if}} <b>the</b> <b>status</b> <b>quo</b> lies <b>in</b> <b>the</b> core of the voting rule, and then it is the only possible outcome. Our comparative statics analysis yield two noteworthy insights: moderate <b>status</b> <b>quos</b> imply moderate policy outcomes, and legislative patience implies policy moderation...|$|R

25|$|Maintaining <b>the</b> <b>status</b> <b>quo</b> <b>in</b> {{the region}} became a {{priority}} for Ramesses, considering {{the emergence of the}} Assyrian military power.

If the Assyrians were allowed to enter Syria, they would be an arm's length away from Egypt herself and pose a threat to Egypt proper. By accepting the Hittite overture of alliance, the newly made allies would help safeguard their mutual holdings in Syria against this upstart power of Assyria.|$|E
