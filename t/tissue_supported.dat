40|$|AbstractAlthough HIV- 1 gene {{expression}} is detected in naive, resting T cells in vivo, such cells {{are resistant to}} productive infection in vitro. However, {{we found that the}} endogenous microenvironment of human lymphoid <b>tissues</b> <b>supports</b> de novo infection and depletion of this population.

Quantitation of the “burst size” within naive cells further demonstrated that these cells were productively infected and contributed to the local viral burden. These findings demonstrate that lymphoid <b>tissues</b> <b>support</b> active HIV- 1 replication in resting, naive T cells. Moreover, these cells are not solely reservoirs of latent virus but are permissive hosts for viral replication that likely targets them for elimination...|$|R

40|$|Inoculation {{of wheat}} {{seedlings}} by the crown rot pathogen Fusarium pseudograminearum {{is commonly used}} to screen for resistance based on leaf sheath discolouration. While leaf sheath discolouration is effective for describing disease reactions, {{the degree to which}} the pathogen colonises the full range of seedling host tissues is an important aspect of the disease process, which has not been systematically examined. After single point droplet inoculation of the coleoptile, quantitative PCR was used to determine the spread of F. pseudograminearum into different host tissues during crown rot pathogenesis at 14 and 28 days after inoculation. Quantitative PCR and visual assessment indicated that while most seedling tissues (leaf sheath, leaf blade, sub-crown internode, primary root and secondary root) were colonised, the basal portion of leaf sheath <b>tissue</b> <b>supported</b> the highest density of F. pseudograminearum. Other significant sites of colonisation were the upper leaf sheath and sub-crown internode.

40|$|Acinetobacter baumannii is {{emerging}} as a serious nosocomial pathogen with multidrug resistance that has {{made it difficult to}} cure and development of efficacious treatment against this pathogen is direly needed. This has led to investigate vaccine approach to prevent and treat A. baumannii infections. In this work, an outer membrane putative pilus assembly protein, FilF, was predicted as vaccine candidate by in silico analysis of A. baumannii proteome and was found to be conserved among the A. baumannii strains. It was cloned and expressed in E. coli BL 21 (DE 3) and purified by Ni-NTA chromatography. Immunization with FilF generated high antibody titer (> 64000) and provided 50 % protection against a standardized lethal dose (10 * 8 CFU) of A. baumannii in murine pneumonia model. FilF immunization reduced the bacterial load in lungs by 2 and 4 log cycles, 12 and 24 h post infection as compared to adjuvant control; reduced the levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines TNF-α, IL- 6, IL- 33, IFN-γ and IL- 1 β significantly and histology of lung <b>tissue</b> <b>supported</b> the data by showing considerably reduced damage and infiltration of neutrophils in lungs.

40|$|Factors to be {{considered}} when selecting an attachment type Selection of an attachment system that is suitable for a specific clinical situation is sometimes difficult. A good knowledge of the different systems and their mechanical properties, {{and the way in}} which they distribute load, is important. For instance, when short implants are used resilient attachments should be applied to ensure a degree of relief on the supporting implants. This allows denture movements to occur and enables the edentulous ridge to absorb the masticatory forces. Consequently, a significant amount of masticatory force is dissipated by the edentulous ridge. Some factors that should be identified and considered in order to obtain the best treatment option with the use of RISOs include the following: 1. Quantity and quality of available residual ridge When the alveolar residual ridge is severely resorbed, a bar attachment and a telescopic attachment provide better horizontal stability, and most occlusal loads are dissipated through the supporting implants as previously stated. However, the potential risk for mechanical failure of the implant or its components is a concern if an adequate number, size and length of the implants are not appreciated. On the other hand, when bone resorption is minimal, individual attachments such as a Locator, ball or magnet can be used. In this case the denture is mainly <b>tissue</b> <b>supported</b> and the attachments may just be used to retain the denture...|$|E

Experimental groups of the rats were randomly divided into 13 groups,each including seven animals: Group 1 (control) treated with saline; groups 2, 3, and 4 treated with 50, 100, or 150 mg/kg of CP, respectively; group 5 treated with 0. 5 mL olive oil; groups 6 and 7 treated with 5. 0 and 10 mg/kg of Car, respectively; groups 8, 9, or 10 treated with respective CP plus 5. 0 mg/kg of Car; and groups 11, 12, or 13 treated with respective CP plus 10 mg/kg of Car. Serum alanine transaminase (ALT),aspartat transaminase (AST), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), malondialdehyde (MDA),creatine kinase-MB (CK-MB), total oxidant state (TOS), oxidative stress index (OSI), and levels were high only in the CP groups. There was a dose-dependence on the CP-induced cardiotoxicity. Hemorrhage, inflammatory cell infiltration and {{the separation of the}} muscle fibers in the heart <b>tissue</b> <b>supported</b> the biochemical data. With 5. 0 and 10 mg/kg Car, there was an important decrease in the CP toxicity and this was related to the oxidative and nitrosative stress in the CP-induced cardiotoxicity. Reduced inflammation and lipid peroxidation in the heart tissue and increase of serum glutathione (GSH) and total antioxidant capacity (TAS) levels were found when carvacrol was applied. Based on these findings, it could be proposed that Car was a strong candidate in preventing the CP-induced cardiotoxicity but further clinical studies should be done in order to verify its application on humans...|$|E

Design/methodology/approach: FEM modeling analyses {{were used to}} determine distribution of mastication loads between mucous foundation and bone tissue surrounding mini-implants that have 1. 8 mm diameter. Examined were two types of commercial solitary denture attachments, described as biomechanically compatible due to their rotational movements freedom or due to the additional pivoting mobility. Findings: In case of both types of attachments the most dangerous lateral implants loadings significantly exceed half of oblique mastication loads value. In mini-implants and bone tissue lateral forces generate a high level of stresses. Research limitations/implications: Analyses were carried out with assumed linear characteristics of materials. Denture-to-soft foundation, as well as implant-to-bone complete adherence was assumed. Practical implications: While using mini-implants it is crucial to carefully evaluate the condition of bone foundation, due to the risk of quick development of atrophic processes in case of insufficient bone parameters. In case of mini-implants very important is very high strength value level and surface quality, {{due to the fact that}} in case of diameter of 1. 8 mm there might occur local yielding and propagation of fatigue cracks.

40|$|High titre {{replication}} of human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) in cell culture {{is restricted to}} primary human fibroblasts. During acute infection in vivo, HCMV nucleic acids and antigens {{have been found in}} various organs. Using only morphological criteria, inconsistent data have been reported about the cell types that can be infected by HCMV. In particular, the role of fibroblasts in organ infections has remained unclear. To define accurately the target cells of HCMV in vivo, tissue sections from lung and gastrointestinal tract of patients suffering from acute HCMV infection were investigated using immunohistochemical double-labelling analyses. Monoclonal antibodies with defined specificity against immediate early (IE), early (E) and late (L) viral antigens and antibodies directed against cell marker proteins were employed to identify infected cells. The results demonstrated that a broad spectrum of cells was infected by HCMV in vivo. Consistent with their susceptibility in culture, fibroblasts formed a major population of HCMV-infected cells. In contrast, haemopoietic cells were only infrequently stained with virus-specific antibodies. Fibroblasts, epithelial cells, endothelial cells, smooth muscle cells and macrophages appeared to be permissive for HCMV replication. Contrary to this, polymorphonuclear cells showed only IE gene expression, indicating that these cells were abortively infected. The analysis of the distribution of infected cells in <b>tissue</b> <b>supported</b> the hypothesis that endothelial cells and monocytes/macrophages may {{play a crucial role in}} the haematogenous spread of HCMV; in contrast, fibroblasts, smooth muscle cells and epithelial cells may form the cell populations important for the multiplication and spread of the virus in infected tissues...|$|E
40|$|During wound healing, angiogenic {{capillary}} sprouts {{invade the}} fibrin/fibronectin-rich wound clot {{and within a}} few days organize into a microvascular network throughout the granulation tissue. As collagen accumulates in the granulation tissue to produce scar, the density of blood vessels diminishes. A dynamic interaction occurs among endothelial cells, angiogenic cytokines, such as FGF, VEGF, TGF-β, angiopoietin, and mast cell tryptase, and the extracellular matrix (ECM) environment. Specific endothelial cell ECM receptors are critical for these morphogenetic changes in blood vessels during wound repair. In particular, αvβ 3, the integrin receptor for fibrin and fibronectin, appears to be required for wound angiogenesis: αvβ 3 is expressed on the tips of angiogenic capillary sprouts invading the wound clot, and functional inhibitors of αvβ 3 transiently inhibit granulation tissue formation. Recent investigations have shown that the wound ECM can regulate angiogenesis in part by modulating integrin receptor expression. mRNA levels of αvβ 3 in human dermal microvascular endothelial cells either plated on fibronectin or overlaid by fibrin gel were higher than in cells plated on collagen or overlaid by collagen gel. Wound angiogenesis also appears to be regulated by endothelial cell interaction with the specific three-dimensional ECM environment in the wound space. In an in vitro model of human sprout angiogenesis, three-dimensional fibrin gel, simulating early wound clot, but not collagen gel, simulating late granulation <b>tissue,</b> <b>supported</b> capillary sprout formation.
