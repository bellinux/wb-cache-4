The spirit of liberty is the spirit which is not too sure that it is right; the spirit of liberty is the spirit which seeks to {{understand}} the minds of other men and women; the spirit of liberty is the spirit which weighs their interests alongside its own without bias; the spirit of liberty remembers that not even a sparrow falls to earth unheeded; the spirit of liberty is the spirit of Him who, near two thousand years ago, taught mankind <b>that</b> <b>lesson</b> it has never learned, but has never quite forgotten; {{that there may be a}} kingdom where the least shall be heard and considered side by side with the greatest.|$|E

25|$|With the Capitulations of Santa Fe, the Crown of Castile granted {{expansive}} {{power to}} Christopher Columbus, including exploration, settlement, political power, and revenues, with sovereignty reserved to the Crown. The first voyage established sovereignty for the crown, and the crown acted {{on the assumption}} that Columbus's grandiose assessment of what he found was true, so Spain negotiated the Treaty of Tordesillas with Portugal to protect their territory on the Spanish side of the line. The crown fairly quickly reassessed its relationship with Columbus and moved to assert more direct crown control over the territory and extinguish his privileges. With <b>that</b> <b>lesson</b> learned, the crown was far more prudent in the specifying the terms of exploration, conquest, and settlement in new areas.|$|E

25|$|This was {{the first}} Doctor Who serial to have its {{location}} material shot entirely on OB videotape, {{as opposed to the}} more usual BBC television drama practice of the time of shooting studio interiors on videotape and location exteriors on film. This was due to the large number of video effects involving the eponymous robot required in exterior scenes (shot at the then BBC Engineering Training Department at Wood Norton, Worcestershire), which were easier and more convincing to marry to videotape than to film. The team had learned <b>that</b> <b>lesson</b> during the previous season's Invasion of the Dinosaurs. The Wood Norton facility was chosen for location shooting because it had an underground bunker, which director Christopher Barry felt would be suitable for the entrance to the underground complex in the story; however, they were refused permission to shoot in that area.|$|E

25|$|After their {{missions}} for the Navy, Knorr {{arrived on}} site on August 22, 1985, and deployed Argo.

40|$|This {{study had}} two purposes. One was to {{research}} the effect of using incomplete concept maps regarding the concept of "How a Lever Works. " Another was to research {{whether or not it}} is possible to use incomplete concept maps as a metacognitive tool. As a result of this research, the following three points became clear: 1. There is a high possibility <b>that</b> <b>lessons</b> <b>that</b> use incomplete concept maps work more effectively on scholastic aptitude with regards to scientific thinking than lessons where concept maps are made by the children themselves. Moreover, <b>lessons</b> <b>that</b> use incomplete concept maps also work effectively for children of lower scholastic ability. 2. In the case of two children, it was found that incomplete concept maps helped them think about the relationship of concept labels. This suggests the possibility <b>that</b> <b>lessons</b> <b>that</b> use incomplete concept maps are useful in structuring the concept of "How a Lever Works" in children's minds. 3. In the case of "Child N," who was in the upper scholastic ability group, it was possible to observe the work of metacognition in the child. This suggests the possibility that incomplete concept maps may be used as a metacognitive tool...|$|R
25|$|Probably no {{instrument}} in modern time so {{lends itself to}} threats to constitutional guarantees of individual freedom as the polygraph or so-called lie detector. The threat of its use or the intimidation inherent in its use restricts free expression and communication of ideas, intrudes on an individual's subconscious thought, makes him fear to speak his thoughts freely, or compels him to speak against his will. To my mind, the entire purpose of these machines is to invade a man's mind and find what lurks in the innermost part of his mental consciousness for reasons which {{have nothing to do}} with his ability to perform a job. If the right of privacy means anything at all and if it is a right to be cherished in our society, it means that people should be entitled to have thoughts, hopes, desires, and dreams that are beyond the reach of a bureaucrat, an employer, or an electronic technician. This is something which enthusiasts for these machines do not seem to understand. They do not understand and they do not appreciate how important privacy is to each American, and as long as <b>that</b> <b>lesson</b> is not understood, we all will find our right to privacy constricted if not abrogated entirely. I propose this legislation to ban the use of the polygraph for employment purposes in the hopes that Congress will pause for a moment, step back, and take a long look at the issues involved in the unrestrained use of the polygraph. Legislation is necessary to bring some order and control to the practice...|$|E

500|$|McAdams' {{break-out}} role came in 2004, {{when she}} {{starred in the}} comedy film Mean Girls opposite Lindsay Lohan, Lacey Chabert and Amanda Seyfried, based on Rosalind Wiseman's book Queen Bees and Wannabes. McAdams was 25 {{years old when she}} was cast as the mean high school queen bee Regina George, and she modelled her character on Alec Baldwin's performance in the drama Glengarry Glen Ross (1992). Mike Clark of USA Today praised her [...] "comic flair" [...] while Jenny McCartney of The Daily Telegraph found her [...] "delightfully hateful." [...] Mick LaSalle of the San Francisco Chronicle felt that [...] "McAdams brings glamour and magnetism to Regina, but also the right hint of comic distance." [...] The film grossed $129 million worldwide and earned McAdams two MTV Movie Awards. Mean Girls later reached No. 12 in an Entertainment Weekly list of the Greatest Ever High School Movies. Tina Fey, who co‑starred in the film and wrote the screenplay, has credited McAdams with teaching her how to act {{in front of a camera}} rather than an audience: [...] "She's a film actor.

500|$|The {{film was}} {{reviewed}} positively by reviewers {{of the trade}} publications. A very positive review by Walton of The Moving Picture News states, [...] " [...] tale of deep, sterling, human interest. The whole plot is so simple, so refreshingly lucid and pure. We cannot criticize this film {{any more than a}} man could analyze mother love. There is a tenderness - and pathos - that is as a nimbus to the whole. The acting of the blind girl, natural, and exquisite, and of her little sister is sweetly innocent. We saw this film twice, on the day of release, in different theatres, and in each case large audiences were touched - and also highly amused by the little girl in the carriage. A sweeter, purer, human-interest tale has not been put on the curtain. The prayer scene deserves to be limned by a master hands <b>that</b> <b>lesson</b> to our children's children. Had we space we could tell the comments of men and women on this production. One thing may be said and that is, all saw and realized the pathos, the beauty and the triumph of the work. Had the film been acted in a theatre we feel certain the audience, with ourselves, with one acclaim would have declared these two orphan girls as manifestations, in the hour of need, of the highest and best emotions of the race!" [...] The Moving Picture Worlds reviewer was also positive and concluded that, [...] "Such films are helpful because they make nearly despairing men sometimes hopeful, and as long as hope lasts there is opportunity for achievement." [...] Even the reviewer of The New York Dramatic Mirror offered praise for Marie Eline's acting ability in particular, but found no fault with the production itself. Bowers notes that the Mirror was not without its detractors and was accused of being a tool of the Edison Trust companies, but reviews for Thanhouser films were amongst the most perceptive.|$|E

2500|$|Summerhill {{sought to}} produce individualists {{conscious}} of their surrounding social order, and Neill chose the self-governance of Homer Lane's Little Commonwealth for {{the basis of}} <b>that</b> <b>lesson.</b> The general meeting replaced teacher authority with communal control, which freed teachers from their roles as disciplinarians and instructed children {{in the role of}} democratic participation and the role of rules. Additionally, reports of teacher–student disputes were rare. Neill felt that the community's authority never created resentment in those subject to sanctions. Sven Muller contended that the meeting was more useful than discipline for creating civic-minded citizens. An ex-pupil recalled some of the wild ideas Neill would propose at the meeting, and while the students would vote him down, she later recounted how the exercise was also intended as a lesson for the staff on the power of the meeting and communal authority. Neill considered self-governance [...] "the most valuable asset in education and life" [...] and the general meeting [...] "more important than all the textbooks in the world".|$|E

Even though it's written through the filter of relationships, it's not necessarily specific for relationships.
