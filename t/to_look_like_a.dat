The restaurant has an associated laboratory where Blumenthal and his team develop new dish concepts.|$|E

D'Angelo decides to cut ties {{to his family}} after his uncle organizes the deaths of several inmates and blames it on a corrupt guard to shave time from his sentence. Eventually Stringer covertly orders D'Angelo killed, with the murder staged <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> suicide. Avon is unaware of Stringer's duplicity and mourns {{the loss of his}} nephew.|$|E
5|$|James Fenhagen and Byron Taylor {{created the}} {{original}} stage design for Double Dare. The {{design for the}} original series' set {{was inspired by a}} 1980s Italian postmodern design and architecture group known as the Memphis Group. Glass brick walls and yellow and pink, often in a checkerboard pattern, were prominent aspects of the set design. Highlighted by blue and yellow tile-style floors, Geoffrey Darby gave the direction for the set <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> natatorium (swimming pool), while Robert Mittenthal feels its inspiration is derived from a bathroom. All the original Double Dare music was composed by Edd Kalehoff.|$|E
5|$|When Oblivion did open, {{the area}} was re-themed <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> {{sinister}} government facility, unlike Fantasy World's fairground theme, and renamed X-Sector. The only surviving ride from Fantasy World, the Black Hole roller coaster, was also changed; the large tent that it was situated in was repainted to blue and silver instead of green and yellow stripes. To make the new X-Sector a major ride area, Alton Towers added two old rides {{from other parts of}} the park: Energizer and Enterprise (both from Festival Park, now Dark Forest). Both rides were repainted to fit to the new theme.|$|E

5|$|Dinner by Heston Blumenthal is a {{restaurant}} in London, England. Opened in January 2011, it gained a Michelin star within a year, and in April 2014 was listed fifth on The World's 50 Best Restaurants in Restaurant magazine. It received a second Michelin Star in the 2014 Guide. The restaurant is headed by former Fat Duck head chef Ashley Palmer-Watts. Menu options are based on historical British dishes, which were researched by food historians and through the British Library. The restaurant's opening drew interest within the industry, and reviews have been positive. Particular dishes have received praise, including the meat fruit, a chicken liver mousse created <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> mandarin orange.|$|E
5|$|Filmed in Canada, {{principal}} photography {{took place}} in Montreal, Saint-Jean-sur-Richelieu, and several other Quebec locations {{during the summer and}} autumn of 1999. In January 1999, Travolta flew his private Boeing 727 on a secret visit to Montreal to scout out locations for shooting. The film was reported to have been the most expensive production shot in Canada up to that point. It was also reported that the production costs would have been twice as high had the film been shot in the United States. Almost every shot in the film is at a Dutch angle, because, according to Roger Christian, he wanted the film <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> comic book.|$|E
5|$|Fire Brigade (set number 10197), {{released}} in September 2009, {{was the fourth}} set in the Modular Buildings series. The set contains 2231 pieces and is recommended for builders 16 {{years of age or}} older. Modeled <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> realistic 1930s fire station, the set includes a bell tower, an opening garage door, a 1930s style fire truck, and 4 minifigures with a fire-dog. Like Green Grocer, all floors in the Fire Brigade set are fully furnished. The Fire Brigade is the first Modular House to come with a vehicle, the 1930s style fire truck. The set also includes some new, unique pieces, such as gold fire helmets and a red sliding garage door.|$|E

5|$|On 10 January 1994 a press {{reception}} {{to announce}} The Division Bell and world tour {{was held at}} a former US Naval Air Station in North Carolina, in the US. A purpose-built Skyship 600 airship, manufactured in the UK, toured the US until it returned to Weeksville, and was destroyed by a thunderstorm on 27 June. Pieces of the aircraft were sold as souvenirs. The band held another reception, in the UK, on 21 March. This time they used an A60 airship, translucent, and painted <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> fish, which took journalists {{on a tour of}} London. The airship, which was lit internally so it glowed in the night sky, was also flown in northern Europe.|$|E
5|$|Tech Tower is {{considered}} an iconic representation of Georgia Tech and {{of higher education in}} Atlanta. It is often featured in marketing materials and merchandise for the Institute and its silhouette is recognized throughout the Atlanta metropolitan area. The Tower, Georgia Tech's undergraduate research journal, is named after Tech Tower. Kessler Campanile, a stylized bell tower built on the Georgia Tech campus as part of an Institute-wide branding campaign in the mid-1990s, was designed <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> modernized version of Tech Tower. The campanile is now featured in all Georgia Tech logos, though some have argued that Tech Tower itself would be a more appropriate symbol.|$|E
5|$|Visual display was prized. Brilliant {{colors were}} {{obtained}} by the addition of, for example, juices from spinach and the green part of leeks. Yellow came from saffron or egg yolk, while red came from sunflower, and purple came from Crozophora tinctoria or Heliotropium europaeum. Gold and silver leaf were placed on food surfaces and brushed with egg whites. Elaborate and showy dishes were the result, such as tourte parmerienne which was a pastry dish made <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> castle with chicken-drumstick turrets coated with gold leaf. One of the grandest showpieces of the time was roast swan or peacock sewn back into its skin with feathers intact, the feet and beak being gilded. Since both birds are stringy, and taste unpleasant, the skin and feathers could be kept and filled with the cooked, minced and seasoned flesh of tastier birds, like goose or chicken.|$|E

5|$|As Miraz and {{his army}} arrive at Aslan's How, Caspian {{suggests}} Peter and Miraz duel to the death, with the loser's army to surrender, {{to buy time}} for Lucy and Susan to find Aslan. Miraz agrees to the duel, not wanting <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> coward {{in front of his}} men. The girls are attacked by Telmarine soldiers, so Susan remains behind to fight them while Lucy continues alone. Peter defeats Miraz, and gives Caspian his sword to finish him off, but Caspian spares Miraz's life. Sopespian kills Miraz with one of Susan's arrows and accuses the Narnians, leading to a battle, with the Telmarines gradually winning. Lucy finds Aslan in the woods and he awakens the trees, turning the battle in the Narnians' favor. Sopespian orders a retreat to a bridge, where they are confronted by Lucy and Aslan. Aslan summons the river god, who destroys the bridge, killing many of the soldiers, swallowing Sopespian and winning the battle.|$|E
5|$|The Sci-Fi Dine-In {{is modeled}} after a 1950s {{drive-in}} theater. The entrance is made <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> box office, and guests can walk from there along a tall fence {{to the dining}} room, where they sit at formica countertops in booths {{made to look like}} convertibles from the 1940s and 1950s. These booths were designed by Walt Disney Imagineering and are made of fiberglass with much chrome plating. The cars have whitewall tires, and speakers are mounted on poles next to each car. The license plates are dated from 1955, and each convertible seats four people, although these mock vehicles were initially six-seaters when the restaurant first opened. There are six picnic tables near {{the back of the room}} that are only used when the rest of the restaurant is full and there are guests who are willing to forego the experience of sitting in the cars. All guests who make reservations are seated in the cars, although this was not the case the year the restaurant first opened. The restaurant has a total seating capacity of 260.|$|E
5|$|The {{restaurant}} {{intends to}} change the menu every three months, each menu containing historical dishes ranging from the 14th to 19th centuries. Prior to opening, rumours were abound regarding the dishes to be served at Dinner, including one report from The Guardian which claimed that an ice-cream meat pie was {{to appear on the}} menu. Dishes that do appear include scallops and peas with cucumber ketchup and bergamot cured mackerel salad. Each item has been based on a historical recipe, such as the scallop dish which dates from 1826 and was published in The Cook and Housewife's Manual Mistress by Meg Dodds. One item which was reported in multiple reviews was the meat fruit, a chicken liver mousse made <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> textured mandarin orange. The meat fruit was proving so popular that by November 2011, some 900 were being sold per week and the restaurant was aiming to increase production to be able to supply up to 1200 a week. During the Christmas period, the Meat Fruit is decorated to appear like a plum rather than a mandarine to accord with the holiday season.|$|E

5|$|The {{scenes of}} Adam and Rachel having sex {{in a shop}} window in the third episode, {{inspired}} by one of Bullen's ex-girlfriends, was filmed in an empty shop unit near Piccadilly station. The unit was dressed <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> charity shop, with various items and the bed added. Mylod and the stunt co-ordinator storyboarded the sequence where the car comes through the shop window before setting it up on location. Nesbitt and Baxendale were switched with stunt doubles and the car was propelled up a ramp through the window. Explosive charges {{were placed on the}} glass to achieve a shatter effect. As only one take could be done, Mylod trailed five cameras on the window. Filming ran from 8p.m. to 6a.m. the following day. The location was near several clubs and many passers-by inquired what was being filmed. To avoid giving away the plot they were told that Baxendale was filming a bed advertisement, capitalising on her exposure from appearing in Friends. Baxendale selected the lingerie Rachel wears in that episode herself, buying £2,000 worth from the Janet Reger outlet in Knightsbridge, London.|$|E
5|$|The {{scene where}} Danny Lee chases a gunman onto a tram was filmed in Causeway Bay {{and the crew}} only had three hours to film. Residents {{thought it was a}} real gunfight and phoned the police. However, when the police arrived, Danny Lee talked to the {{superintendent}} so they could continue filming. Scenes from the Dragon Boat festival were shot months apart, some footage was of the boat races and rest of the footage involving the actors was shot months later. It was planned for the boats to flip over during the chase but the owners refused because they felt it would bring bad luck. The scene at the airport were filmed at the Kai Tak Airport. The scenes at Paul Chu Kong's character's house were filmed in Stanley, Hong Kong. John Woo wanted this house to be by a beach but a suitable location could not be found. The action scene inside the house took 28 days to shoot. The final action scene took 36 days to shoot and was shot at a remote building made <b>to</b> <b>look</b> <b>like</b> <b>a</b> church while the exterior seen from Ah Jong's apartment is a real church. The original ending of the film involved Jennie waiting at an airport for Li to give her the money and for them to travel to the United States. Due to Sally Yeh's tight filming schedule, the scene was not filmed and replaced with Ah Jong playing the harmonica.|$|E
