The minimum energy stored in the lobes of a powerful radio source might be 1053 J. The lower limit on the work done on the external medium by such a source is several times <b>this.</b> <b>A</b> <b>good</b> deal of the current interest in radio sources focuses on the effect they must have at the centres of clusters at the present day. Equally interesting is their likely effect on structure formation over cosmological time: {{it is thought that}} they may provide a feedback mechanism to slow the formation of the most massive objects.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} 1960s U.S. nuclear {{submarines}} armed with mid-range nuclear missiles of type Polaris A-1 were deployed outside the Swedish west coast. Range and safety considerations made <b>this</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> area {{from which to}} launch a retaliatory nuclear strike on Moscow. The submarines {{had to be very}} close to the Swedish coast to hit their intended targets though. As a consequence of this, in 1960, the same year that the submarines were first deployed, the U.S. provided Sweden with a military security guarantee. The U.S. promised to provide military force in aid of Sweden in case of Soviet aggression. This guarantee was kept from the Swedish public until 1994, when a Swedish research commission found evidence for it. As part of the military cooperation the U.S. provided much help {{in the development of the}} Saab 37 Viggen, as a strong Swedish air force was seen as necessary to keep Soviet anti-submarine aircraft from operating in the missile launch area. In return Swedish scientists at the Royal Institute of Technology made considerable contributions to enhancing the targeting performance of the Polaris missiles.|$|E
500|$|The longest {{casting process}} {{was that of}} Bakula as Archer, due to the {{extended}} contract negotiations that took place, which added to a delay in production. He had been sought for the part by the executive producers, although Bakula {{wanted to do the}} show, he [...] "wanted to feel that [...] was making a good deal and that everyone was going to work together to make <b>this</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> experience." [...] He had signed up for a pilot for CBS called Late Bloomers before agreeing to appear on Enterprise. One of the reasons he agreed to join the cast of Enterprise was that he had previously worked with Kerry McCluggage, one of the co-founders of UPN, on Quantum Leap. Berman later admitted {{that they did not have}} an alternative in mind if Bakula decided to turn down the role.|$|E

2500|$|I {{remember}} that your brother Hugh {{did something to}} dissuade me from tackling Manxland in any sort of work. He did not think the readers of novels would find the island at all interesting, and {{he was sure that}} the local atmosphere was not such as would attract them. I thought over <b>this</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> deal, and decided, I must say, against your brother's judgment. [...] In the first place, the island has excellent atmosphere. It has the sea, a fine coast on the west, fine moorland above; it has traditions, folk-talk, folk-lore, a ballad literature, and no end of superstition – and all these are very much its own.|$|E

2500|$|In October 1967, the US Marine Corps {{issued a}} {{requirement}} for a helicopter with a lifting capacity 1.8 {{times that of the}} CH-53D that could fit on amphibious assault ships. Before this Sikorsky had been working on an enhancement to the CH-53D, under the company designation [...] "S-80", featuring a third turboshaft engine and a more powerful rotor system. [...] Sikorsky proposed the S-80 design to the Marines in 1968. The Marines considered <b>this</b> <b>a</b> <b>good,</b> quick solution, and funded development of a testbed helicopter. [...] Changes on the CH-53E also included a stronger transmission and a fuselage stretched 6 feet 2inches (1.88 m). [...] The main rotor blades were changed to a titanium-fiberglass composite. [...] A new automatic flight control system was added. [...] The tail configuration was also changed to a larger vertical tail with the tail rotor tilted slightly to provide some lift in hover.|$|E

2500|$|Reviewers wrote, and Miller later confirmed, that a {{recurring}} theme in the lyrics of Real Nighttime was life after college, which Miller paired with the intuition that [...] "freedom had a strong aspect of being bad news." [...] The song [...] "24" [...] placed the narrator at the cusp of a quarter-life crisis, as a self-conscious young adult whose mixed feelings established that he [...] "doesn't know where he fits, or to how to live on his own, in a post-collegiate milieu." [...] The theme continued with allusions to finding one's own direction and leaving the nest, as in [...] "Curse of the Frontier Land" [...] ("A year ago we called <b>this</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> time"), and [...] "I Mean It This Time" [...] ("Give me all the gin I need, for I may not be this strong when I call my parents and tell them they've been wrong.") ...|$|E
2500|$|After Lord Clive {{finished}} {{working up}} {{she was sent}} to the Thames Estuary on 9 August 1915 to practice bombardment techniques with her sisters [...] and [...] A replica had been laid out there of some of the principal features of the Belgian coast near Zeebrugge and the ships practised their manoeuvering and spotting arrangements. Two tripods were dropped in the sea, housing observers which could triangulate the fall of shot and signal corrections to the monitors. One problem was that the modified 12-inch gun mounts broke down quite a bit, as they had not been designed to fire at angles up to 30° and many of their components were quite elderly. The ships were judged ready and a bombardment was planned on 21 August. This had to be postponed for a day because of bad weather, but Lord Clive, her sisters and their supporting armada of ten destroyers, nine minesweepers, the seaplane carrier , four ships to handle the observation tripods, and no less than fifty drifters to handle the explosive anti-submarine nets laid to protect the monitors, sailed to a position about [...] off Zeebrugge during the night of 22–23 August. Lord Clive anchored and opened fire at 05:36 on the locks of the Zeebrugge Canal that led to the German naval base at Bruges. She fired 31 shells at the locks over {{an hour and a half}} before switching targets to a nearby factory which received eleven rounds. Vice Admiral Reginald Bacon ordered the ships to cease-fire after two hours, cancelling the plans to bombard Ostend as well since both Sir John Moore and Prince Rupert had been suffering significant problems with their turrets. The bombardment was fairly ineffectual; two barges were sunk, some buildings damaged, two civilians killed and some German workmen injured, but the locks were not hit. The British judged <b>this</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> first try and planned for a bombardment of Ostend once Sir John Moore and Prince Rupert had been repaired.|$|E
