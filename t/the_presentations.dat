5|$|Sato {{estimated}} the game's budget at US$3–5 million. He {{said that the}} development team intended to make Silent Hill a masterpiece rather than a traditional sales-oriented game, and that they opted for an engaging story, which would persist over time – similar to successful literature. The game debuted at the 1998 Electronic Entertainment Expo in Atlanta, Georgia, United States, where <b>the</b> <b>presentations</b> of movies and in-game scenes garnered applause from the audience. This favorable reception persuaded Konami to allot more personnel and public relation initiatives to the project. Konami later showcased Silent Hill at the European Computer Trade Show in London, and included a demo with its stealth game Metal Gear Solid in Japan.|$|E

Following this model, <b>the</b> <b>presentation</b> schema is defined as a common <b>presentation</b> structure for <b>the</b> members who have the same methodology and/or domain of research in a research group in the laboratory.
