Tombstone city Marshal Virgil Earp learned that <b>the</b> <b>Cowboys</b> were armed and had gathered near the O.K. Corral. He asked Wyatt and Morgan Earp and Doc Holliday to assist him, as he intended to disarm them.

2500|$|Calf Roping, {{also called}} Tie-down roping, {{is based on}} ranch work in which calves are roped for branding, medical treatment, or other purposes. It is the oldest of rodeo's timed events. <b>The</b> <b>cowboy</b> ropes a running calf around the neck with a lariat, and his horse stops and sets back on the rope while <b>the</b> <b>cowboy</b> dismounts, runs to the calf, throws {{it to the ground}} and ties three feet together. (If the calf falls when roped, <b>the</b> <b>cowboy</b> must lose time waiting for the calf to get back to its feet so that <b>the</b> <b>cowboy</b> can do <b>the</b> work.) The job of the horse is to hold the calf steady on the rope. [...] A well-trained calf-roping horse will slowly back up while <b>the</b> <b>cowboy</b> ties <b>the</b> calf, to help keep the lariat snug.|$|R

5|$|Oklahoma State scored first, with a {{surprising}} 49yard pass from Al Pena to D'Juan Woods. <b>The</b> <b>Cowboys</b> had lined up tight on 4th and 1 {{as if trying}} a short, power run, but faked that play and threw a deep pass instead, catching the Longhorn defense off-guard.

40|$|John R. Erickson {{researched}} <b>The</b> Modem <b>Cowboy</b> in {{a working}} laboratory that extended from horizon to horizon in his particular {{section of the}} Great Plains, the Texas and Oklahoma panhandles. He writes from personal experience, gained in years of working as a cowboy on modern ranches. He makes plain the fact that <b>the</b> <b>cowboy</b> of today must master many skills unknown to <b>the</b> <b>cowboy</b> of <b>the</b> colorful open range before the era of tractors, vaccination, controlled breeding, and 2 ̆ 2 calfpullers. 2 ̆ 2 <b>The</b> modern <b>cowboy</b> should be a mechanic and something of a veterinarian and horticulturist as well. Although he still rides horses and ropes cattle, he also builds pasture fences, repairs windmills, and puts up hay. Even so, as Erickson makes clear, the romance is not all gone {{from the life of}} <b>the</b> <b>cowboy.</b> <b>The</b> glamor invested in the old-time riders of the purple sage by great western movies and innumerable cowboy stories still firmly surrounds <b>the</b> <b>cowboy,</b> a durable fellow indeed, both in fact and fiction. Most important, perhaps, as Erickson points out, is the fact that <b>the</b> <b>cowboy</b> is still needed. As long as Americans perfer beef on their tables, and until the cattle business modernizes and mechanizes him out of existence, <b>the</b> <b>cowboy</b> will {{be a part of the}} scene...|$|R

5|$|The {{incident}} {{has become}} a fixture in American history due to the personal nature of the feud between the Earps and the McLaury and Clanton brothers and {{the symbolism of the}} fight between lawmen and <b>the</b> <b>Cowboys.</b> <b>The</b> <b>Cowboys</b> maimed Virgil and murdered Morgan but escaped prosecution, and Wyatt's extra-legal campaign for revenge captured people's attention.
