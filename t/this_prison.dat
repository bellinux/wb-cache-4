5|$|Barton's {{career and}} life have {{been marked by}} {{numerous}} controversial incidents and disciplinary problems {{and he has been}} convicted twice on charges of violence. On 20 May 2008, he was sentenced to six months' imprisonment for common assault and affray during an incident in Liverpool City Centre. Barton served 77 days of <b>this</b> <b>prison</b> term, being released on 28 July 2008. On 1 July 2008, he was also given a four-month suspended sentence after admitting assault occasioning actual bodily harm on former teammate Ousmane Dabo during a training-ground dispute on 1 May 2007. This incident effectively ended his Manchester City career. Barton has been charged with violent conduct three times by The Football Association: for the assault on Dabo, for punching Morten Gamst Pedersen in the stomach and for attacking three players {{on the final day of}} the 2011–12 season.|$|E
5|$|Cambridge Castle, locally {{also known}} as Castle Mound, is located in Cambridge, Cambridgeshire, England. Originally built after the Norman conquest to control the {{strategically}} important route {{to the north of}} England, it {{played a role in the}} conflicts of the Anarchy, the First and Second Barons' Wars. Hugely expanded by Edward I, the castle then fell rapidly into disuse in the late medieval era, its stonework recycled for building purposes in the surrounding colleges. Cambridge Castle was refortified during the English Civil War but once again fell into disuse, used primarily as the county gaol. The castle gaol was finally demolished in 1842, with a new prison built in the castle bailey. <b>This</b> <b>prison</b> was demolished in 1932, replaced with the modern Shire Hall, and only the castle motte and limited earthworks still stand. The site is open to the public daily and offers views over the historic buildings of the city.|$|E
25|$|In {{the year}} 1882, the railway of Horonai was {{completed}} (官営幌内鉄道, Kan'ei Horonai Tetsudō), the third railway of the Japanese empire connecting the mine with the Otaru harbor. Also, the government {{decided to build}} the prison of sorachi in Mikasa (空知監獄). Thus the problem of overcrowded prisons {{as well as the}} problem of insufficient labour power in the mine were solved. Between 1883 and 1894, <b>this</b> <b>prison</b> provided an average of 720 prison miners a year, making up 80 percent of the total workforce.|$|E

25|$|On March 26, 2012 he {{was sentenced}} to 5 years in prison for making {{repeated}} death threats against Norwegian politicians and the Kurds if they pursued certain civil actions against him. He has appealed <b>this</b> <b>prison</b> sentence. The next day, March 27, 2012, he was arrested by the Norwegian Police Security Service (PST) and Norwegian Police and taken into protective custody and incarceration. This occurred after certain additional statements of a threatening nature were linked to him, suggesting that others might take retaliatory actions against Norwegians if his civil prison sentence were implemented.|$|E
25|$|On Miguel E. Schultz Street is a {{building}} that was once a federal jail, which briefly held Fidel Castro and Che Cuevara in 1956 after the Mexican government found out they were preparing to militarily confront the Fulgencio Batista regime in Cuba from Mexican soil. <b>This</b> <b>prison</b> ceased operating sometime in the 1980s. Another abandoned landmark is the mansion located {{on the corner of}} Rosas Moreno and Antonio Caso, which used to be the Russian embassy. In the 1980s, it was abandoned then suffered a fire. Today it is a shell with much of its roof caved in. All that remains intact is the pink stone decorative features on its facade.|$|E
25|$|Another {{round of}} arsons in 1961 and 1962 {{prompted}} {{the creation of}} the Agassiz Mountain Prison as a satellite of BC Penitentiary. <b>This</b> <b>prison</b> was specifically designed to house Doukhobor prisoners. Since the Doukhobors refused to do any work while incarcerated, there were no work programs and no privileges for the inmates at the new institution. The entire prison was designed to avoid incendiarism, with everything, including furniture, being made of concrete or metal. All fabrics, such as clothing and bedding, were fireproofed. The leaders of the Sons of Freedom were kept segregated, as were the younger men. The inmates began a hunger strike in August 1962, which carried on for over a year and resulted in one death due to malnutrition, despite forced-feedings.|$|E

Prior to <b>this</b> <b>prisons,</b> the {{probation}} system and the courts were all managed by the Department of Justice. The new Act gave management of prisoners, parolees and offenders on probation to a new Department of Corrections while leaving administration of the court system and fines collection with the Ministry of Justice. The intention was to enable the new Department to improve public safety and assist in the rehabilitation and reintegration of offenders.|$|R
25|$|Political prisoners: Political {{prisons are}} the harshest {{long-term}} punishment {{that can be}} inflicted to an individual in the DPRK, and are used as the means to remove from society those individuals and families that are seen as an irredeemable threat to the regime. As such, these inmates cease to be considered citizens with any rights. Persons accused of major political crimes become victims of enforced disappearance; they are detained and, if not executed immediately, brought without trial to political prison camps (kwanliso) and held incommunicado. Their families are never informed of their fate. The State uses this system to instill fear in the population. The inmate population has been gradually eliminated through deliberate starvation, forced labor, executions, torture, rape and the denial of reproductive rights. The Commission estimates that {{hundreds of thousands of}} political prisoners have perished in these camps over the past five decades, with atrocities that resemble the horrors of camps that totalitarian states established during the twentieth century. Between 80,000 and 120,000 people are believed to remain incarcerated. The DPRK has always denied the existence of <b>this</b> <b>prison</b> network.|$|E

2500|$|In January 1939, the British Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain visited Rome, {{during which}} visit, Mussolini learned that though Britain {{very much wanted}} better {{relations}} with Italy, and was prepared to make concessions, it would not sever all ties with France {{for the sake of}} an improved Anglo-Italian relationship. With that, Mussolini grew more interested in the German offer of a military alliance, which had first been made in May 1938. In February 1939, Mussolini gave a speech before the Fascist Grand Council, during which he proclaimed his belief that a state's power is [...] "proportional to its maritime position" [...] and that Italy was a [...] "prisoner in the Mediterranean and the more populous and powerful Italy becomes, the more it will suffer from its imprisonment.

One juror later said that the jury felt Sellers would be paroled in 7 to 14 years, and <b>this</b> <b>prison</b> term was not lengthy enough. [...] So the jury opted for the death penalty.

2500|$|Pennsylvania soon {{put this}} theory into practice, and turned its old jail at Walnut Street in Philadelphia {{into a state}} prison, in 1790. <b>This</b> <b>prison</b> was modeled on {{what became known as}} the [...] "Pennsylvania system" [...] (or [...] "separate system"), and placed all prisoners into solitary cells with nothing other than {{religious}} literature, and forced them to be completely silent to reflect on their wrongs. New York soon built the Newgate state prison in Greenwich Village, which was modeled on the Pennsylvania system, and other states followed.|$|E

In 1885, Chucho el Roto died at his prison but the cause of his death has been disputed. One story states that he died fighting with other prisoners. Another states that he was badly wounded in the leg trying to escape from <b>this</b> <b>prison.</b> After the escape he was tortured.

Van der Post was famous {{for his work in}} maintaining the morale of prisoners of many different nationalities. Along with others, he organised a [...] "camp university" [...] with courses from basic literacy to degree-standard ancient history, and he also organized a camp farm to supplement nutritional needs. He could also speak some basic Japanese, which helped him greatly. Once, depressed, he wrote in his diary: [...] "It is {{one of the hardest things}} in <b>this</b> <b>prison</b> life: the strain caused by being continually in the power of people who are only half-sane and live in a twilight of reason and humanity." [...] He wrote about his prison experiences in A Bar of Shadow (1954), The Seed and the Sower (1963) and The Night of the New Moon (1970). Japanese film director Nagisa Oshima based his film Merry Christmas, Mr. Lawrence (1982) on the last two of these books.|$|E

When Cecil arrives to tell her that the time for her execution has come, he informs her that Elizabeth has granted her final wishes, including allowing Anna to accompany her to the scaffold. Then Mary offers a pardon to the queen (Mary, Anna, Talbot, Cecil, chorus: Di un cor che more reca il perdóno / [...] "From a heart that is dying, may pardon be granted"). Leicester comes to bid her farewell. Both are distraught and he expresses outrage. Mary asks him to support her at the hour of her death and protests her innocence once again (Aria: Ah! se un giorno da queste ritorte / [...] "Ah! Though one day from <b>this</b> <b>prison</b> your arm wanted to abduct me, now you lead me to my death"). She is then led to the scaffold.|$|E
