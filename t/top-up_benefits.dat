It examines the contribution of the NMW to direct poverty reduction and to “making work pay”. It concludes that the main contribution made by the NMW to poverty reduction at the household level is probably through its role in underpinning the operation of in-work <b>top-up</b> <b>benefits.</b> minimum wage, poverty...|$|E

The Opinions and Lifestyle Survey, formerly known as ONS Opinions Survey or Omnibus, is a regular, multi-purpose survey which {{was carried out in}} eight months of the year until April 2005. From this point it has run monthly. It started operating commercially in 1990 and was set up originally {{to meet the needs of}} government departments for a survey that used short and simple sets of questions, had greater statistical reliability than private sector omnibus surveys and a properly designed random sample. Now, however, an increasing number of academics are finding it a valuable research tool. The Opinions and Lifestyle Survey is used for a number of purposes, for example: to provide quick answers to questions of immediate interest to provide information on topics that do not require a full survey to develop and pilot questions for other surveys to sift for subgroups that can be followed up in another survey History From January 2008 the ONS Omnibus Survey changed its name to the ONS Opinions Survey (OPN) and became part of the Integrated Household Survey (IHS). As a result, certain classificatory variables were altered to harmonise with the rest of the surveys that form the IHS. For further information, see detailed breakdown of the changes contained within the documentation for 2008 studies onwards. Subsequently, in January 2010, the OPN component was dropped from the IHS due to only one individual per household being interviewed, while the IHS requires questions to be asked of all household members. This process significantly increased the length of the OPN interview and, therefore, OPN reverted back to interviewing one household member, but still contains questions harmonised to the IHS. From April 2012 the ONS Opinions Survey changed its name to the Opinions and Lifestyle Survey following the merger of the non-EU-SILC questions from the General Lifestyle Survey. Special Licence Access Opinions and Lifestyle Survey data With effect from 2008, the decision was made by ONS to make all new and existing Disability Monitoring data (Module 363) and Contraception data (Module 170) issuable only to Approved Researchers under Special Licence access conditions due to the disclosive nature of the modules. See the Opinions and Lifestyle Survey Special Licence Access datasets page. Main Topics : Each month's questionnaire consists of two elements: core questions, covering demographic information, are asked each month together with non-core questions that vary from month to month. The non-core questions for this month were: Local Authority Tenants (Module 186) : this module was asked on behalf of the Department of Environment, Transport and the Regions (DETR), and only applied to those respondents renting from local authorities in England and Wales. It combined a repeat of the 'Tenant's Charter' module run in 1991 / 2 and 1992 / 3 with questions based on ones from the 1994 module 'Information for LA Tenants' and the Survey of English Housing. Withheld Deposits (Module 193) : this module was asked on behalf of the DETR and would have been included in the Survey of English Housing, but no space was available. It was asked in England only, to help the DETR compile a sample of respondents who had at some time in the past three years had a deposit that they had paid prior to moving into privately rented accommodation withheld when they left. Second Homes (Module 4) : this module was asked on behalf of the DETR. It has appeared in previous Omnibus surveys in a slightly different form. The module queried respondents on ownership of a second home by any member of the household and reasons for having the second home. Attitudes to Disability Benefits (Module 191) : this module was asked on behalf of the Department of Social Security. The questions focus on three different sorts of benefit claimants, the disabled, who can claim Income Replacement Benefit, people injured at work and carers. Alcohol brought into the United Kingdom (UK) from European Union (EU) countries (Module 164) : this module was asked on behalf of Customs and Excise, and aimed to assess the extent of cross-border shopping since the Single European Market was introduced. It is only concerned with alcohol bought in other EU countries in outlets other than duty-free shops. Attitudes to in-work subsidies and unemployment benefit (Module 194) : this module was asked on behalf of the DSS and focuses on attitudes to <b>top-up</b> <b>benefits</b> for low-paid workers with jobs, attitudes to unemployment benefit, and attitudes to unemployed couples with and without children. Lone Mothers (Module 184) : this module was asked on behalf of the DSS. The questions were taken from a British attitudes survey and compare attitudes towards mothers living in couples with children of varying ages with attitudes towards lone mothers. Contraception (Module 170) : the Special Licence version of this module is held under SN 6476. PEPs and TESSAs (Module 185) : this module was asked on behalf of the Inland Revenue, to gain more information about the distribution of PEPs and TESSAs and in particular the extent to which the two groups overlap. Vulnerable consumers of financial products (Module 195) : this module was asked on behalf of the Office for Fair Trading, who were conducting an enquiry into vulnerable consumers of financial services such as banking, savings and investments, credit and insurance...|$|E

Main Topics : Each month's questionnaire consists of two elements: core questions, covering demographic information, are asked each month together with non-core questions that vary from month to month. The non-core questions for this month were: Televisions (Module 177) : this module was asked on behalf of the Department of National Heritage, to ascertain how many households have a television that did not work at the time and did not have another TV set that did work, and whether they intended to get the broken television set repaired in the next seven days after the interview took place. Head of Household Information (Module 70 a) : this module covers occupation and supervisory status of head of household. It was asked only if the respondent was not head of household. Withheld Deposits (Module 193) : this module was asked on behalf of the Department of Environment, Transport and the Regions (DETR), and would have been included in the Survey of English Housing, but no space was available. It was asked in England only, to help the DETR compile a sample of respondents who had at some time in the past three years had a deposit that they had paid prior to moving into privately rented accommodation withheld when they left. Second Homes (Module 4) : this module was asked on behalf of the Department of Environment, Transport and the Regions (DETR). It had appeared in previous Omnibus surveys in a slightly different form. The module queried respondents on ownership of a second home by any member of the household and reasons for having the second home. Drinking (Module 192) : this module was asked on behalf of the Department of Health. It is based on the 'Drinking' module (113) asked in February and March 1997 (see SN: 3920), with some questions omitted and some new questions added, which were designed to measure the likely impact on drinking of an initiative to add unit labelling to drinks sold in supermarkets and off-licences. Alcohol brought into the UK from EU countries (Module 164) : this module was asked on behalf of Customs and Excise, and aimed to assess the extent of cross-border shopping since the Single European Market was introduced. It is only concerned with alcohol bought in other EU countries in outlets other than duty-free shops. Back Pain (Module 196) : this module was asked on behalf of the Department of Health and asks about back pain experienced in the 12 months prior to the survey. It includes questions about the number of days back pain was experienced, visits to health services for the pain, its cause, whether activities restricted or time taken off work during the four weeks prior to the survey due to back pain. Public Confidence in Official Statistics (Module 197) : this module followed on from pilot work begun in the November 1996 survey, and aimed to measure: 1) whether people have heard of ONS or its component parts - the Office of Population Censuses and Surveys, and the Central Statistical Office and 2) the level of public confidence in official statistics (those produced by ONS). Marriage and Cohabitation (Module 179) : this module was asked on behalf of the Lord Chancellor's Department and Oxford University, and queried respondents' opinions of various aspects of relationships. The module was asked only of respondents who were married for the first time and have children aged under 16, or were cohabiting and had never been married. In the March 1998 survey it was asked of cohabiting respondents only. Evaluation of Physical Activity (Health Promotion) Advertisements (Module 160) : the purpose of this module was to evaluate advertisements run by the Health Education Authority (HEA) encouraging physical activity and exercise. It focused on respondents' awareness of the advertisements, and their knowledge of amount of physical activity beneficial to health. It was used on respondents in England only. Attitudes to disability benefits (Module 191 / 191 a) : this module was asked on behalf of the Department of Social Security and the questions focus on three different sorts of benefit claimants - the disabled who can claim 'income replacement' benefit, people injured at work and carers. Attitudes to in-work subsidies and unemployment benefit (Module 194 / 194 a) : this module was asked on behalf of the Department of Social Security and focuses on attitudes to <b>top-up</b> <b>benefits</b> for low-paid workers with jobs, attitudes to unemployment benefit, and attitudes to unemployed couples with and without children. Sexual Health (Module 198) : this module was asked on behalf of the Health Education Authority (HEA), in order to monitor knowledge of sexual health matters and their awareness of HIV and AIDS. HIV Testing (Module 199) : this module was asked on behalf of the Department of Public Health, Barking and Havering Health Authority in conjunction with the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, and aimed to assess knowledge and attitudes about testing for HIV. PEPs and TESSAs (Module 185) : this module was asked on behalf of the Inland Revenue, to gain more information about the distribution of PEPs and TESSAs and in particular the extent to which the two groups overlap. Vulnerable consumers of financial products (Module 195) : this module was asked on behalf of the Office for Fair Trading, who were conducting a enquiry into vulnerable consumers of financial services such as banking, savings and investments, credit and insurance. <br...|$|E
30|$|For pension {{benefits}} in the broad sense (that is, old-age, survivor’s, disability, and work injury and occupational diseases), no significant conceptual and operational issues seem to exist, except for the nonexportability of noncontributory <b>benefits</b> (<b>top-ups),</b> administrative issues around documentation readiness and information, and the taxation of benefits in disbursement.|$|R
30|$|Nonexportability of noncontributory <b>benefits</b> (pension <b>top-ups)</b> {{is quite}} likely the most {{contentious}} issue in all four corridors. All four investigated EU member countries {{have some form of}} minimum income guarantee in old age, with means-tested top-ups granted if the own pension benefit level plus other income is below the guaranteed income level in old age (Ausgleichszulagenrichtsatz fuer Alterspensions in Austria; Garantie de revenus aux personnes âgées in Belgium; Allocation de solidarité pour les personnes âgées in France; and Grundsicherung im Alter in Germany). Yet, none of these EU member countries allow the export of the <b>top-ups</b> to supplement <b>benefits</b> paid abroad.|$|R
40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the impact of}} organisational factors on fathers’ use of parental benefits. Only 9. 4 % of Canadian fathers outside Quebec claimed or intended to claim parental benefits in 2012. Fathers’ stronger labour force attachment and higher earnings contribute to their decreased likelihood of claiming parental benefits compared to mothers. Workplace values and work demands also significantly impact fathers’ use of parental benefits. Using a case study analysis of Quebec, the 2011 General Social Survey, and a supplemental online survey, this study evaluates {{the extent to which}} work-related and other factors facilitate or hinder fathers’ use of parental benefits. The study also estimates the impacts of possible options for reform, including exclusive, non-transferable paternity benefits, part-time parental benefits, and a tax credit for employers who provide <b>top-ups</b> for parental <b>benefits...</b>|$|R
30|$|These {{changes to}} the {{activation}} regime introduced by the Labour governments were backed up {{by a series of}} {{changes to the}} tax and benefit system and the introduction in 1999 of a national minimum wage. The aim of these changes was to “make work pay”, i.e., to ensure that moving off an inactive benefit (JSA, lone-parent, IB) into work would lead to a financial gain for the individual and his family. Given the complexity of the design of the UK’s benefit system–benefits are flat-rate and means-tested with a variety of <b>top-ups</b> via cash <b>benefits</b> or tax credits; there are also earnings disregards by which benefits are withdrawn as work income increases–achieving this objective is very difficult and it can create so-called “poverty traps” for certain groups. Be that as it may, these reforms did increase work incentives for many lone parents, and there is no doubt that, when combined with the activation reforms, they accounted for part of the strong rise in lone-parent employment from almost 45 % in 1997 to nearly 57 % in 2009. But the tax credits proved very costly for the public purse and they worsened work incentives for many second earners in couple households.|$|R
