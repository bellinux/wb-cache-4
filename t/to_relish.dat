5|$|That summer, Victoria and Albert spent a rainy {{holiday in}} the west of Scotland at Loch Laggan, but heard from their doctor, Sir James Clark, that his son had enjoyed dry, sunny days farther east at Balmoral Castle. The tenant of Balmoral, Sir Robert Gordon, died {{suddenly}} in early October, and Albert began negotiations {{to take over the}} lease from the owner, the Earl Fife. In May the following year, Albert leased Balmoral, which he had never visited, and in September 1848 he, his wife and the older children went there for the first time.

This culminated in his appointment as club captain, a role he seemed <b>to</b> <b>relish</b> but {{of which he}} was relieved for the 2006–07 season in favour of Wayne Thomas.

Aurelian used his cavalry to great effect, breaking the Goths into smaller groups which were easier to deal with. By late summer the Goths were defeated: any survivors were stripped of their animals and booty and were levied into the army or settled as farmers in frontier regions. Aurelian had no time <b>to</b> <b>relish</b> his victories; in late August news arrived from Sirmium that emperor Claudius was dead.|$|E

25|$|Hartnell's {{performance}} in This Sporting Life was noted by Verity Lambert, the producer who {{was setting up}} a new science-fiction television series for the BBC entitled Doctor Who; mainly {{on the strength of}} that performance, Lambert offered him the title role. Although Hartnell was initially uncertain about accepting a part in what was pitched to him as a children's series, in part due to his success in films, Lambert and director Waris Hussein convinced him to take the part, and it became the character for which he gained the highest profile and is now most remembered. Hartnell later revealed that he took the role because it led him away from the gruff, military parts in which he had become typecast, and, having two grandchildren of his own, he came <b>to</b> <b>relish</b> particularly the attention and affection that playing the character brought him from children. His first episode of Doctor Who aired on 23 November 1963.|$|E

[...] Columnist Martin Knelman, in the Toronto Star, advised, [...] "Don't expect a balanced account of the troubles that brewed. This is strictly the Gospel According to Richard - entertaining but also blatantly self-serving. ... He had no appetite for compromise, consensus or conciliation. He seemed <b>to</b> <b>relish</b> the chance to shock people, make them angry and create dramatic showdowns. Now with this book, he seizes the chance to attack those who stood in his way."

500|$|Juster {{says the}} book was rescued from the {{remainders}} table when Emily Maxwell wrote a strong review of it in The New Yorker. Maxwell wrote, [...] "As Pilgrim's Progress {{is concerned with the}} awakening of the sluggardly spirit, The Phantom Tollbooth is concerned with the awakening of the lazy mind." [...] Hers was far from the only positive piece; children's author Ann McGovern reviewed it for The New York Times, writing [...] "Norton Juster's amazing fantasy has something wonderful for anyone old enough <b>to</b> <b>relish</b> the allegorical wisdom of Alice in Wonderland and the pointed whimsy of The Wizard of Oz". John Crosby wrote for the New York Herald Tribune, [...] "In a world which sometimes seems to have gone mad, it is refreshing to pause and consider for a moment a book for children which contains a character called 'Faintly Macabre, the not-so-wicked Which.' The name of the book is The Phantom Tollbooth and it was written by a bearded elf named Norton Juster and illustrated by Jules Feiffer, who is the cleverest of the young neurotics". Dissenting was the Bulletin of the Center for Children's Books, which in March 1962 deemed the book an [...] "intensive and extensive fantasy, heavily burdened with contrivance and whimsy".|$|E

500|$|Others such as Susanne Kord and Elisabeth Krimer {{note how}} Cordelia {{is also a}} subversive {{representation}} of feminine stereotypes, describing [...] "Although superficially, Cordelia conforms to {{the stereotype of the}} insensitive bitch", what she actually does is [...] "offers her viewers the clandestine pleasures of female self-assertion". One of Cordelia's strongest traits, her honesty, is also highlighted in [...] "Earshot", where Buffy temporarily develops telepathic powers and can hear the thoughts of her friends, who avoid her to hide these thoughts. For Cordelia however, [...] "her thought processes and actual utterances are completely identical" [...] and because of this she embodies an [...] "antithesis of female self-sacrifice" [...] in these years but also [...] "the opposite of the kind of hypocrisy that is typically attributed to women". Writer Jennifer Crusie interprets this as Cordelia's [...] "lack of depth" [...] becoming [...] "her strength". She does not mean to argue that Cordelia is stupid however, pointing out [...] "Cordy's solipsism could easily be mistaken for stupidity, but it comes coupled with a keen intelligence and a fixity of purpose that makes her almost invincible." [...] Jowett feels Cordelia's confidence is based in her wealth. Despite becoming more sympathetic as the series progressed, [...] "bitchiness enhances Cordelia's comic appeal", as it offers viewers an opportunity <b>to</b> <b>relish</b> its honest truth-telling.|$|E
500|$|Vicky Allan of the Sunday Herald noted Bond himself, and not {{his love}} interests, was sexually {{objectified}} in this film.

[...] This sentiment is shared by the University of Leicester's James Chapman, author of License to Thrill, who also notes Craig's Bond is [...] "not yet the polished article"; he felt his incarnation of Bond is close to Fleming's because he is [...] "humourless," [...] but is also different because [...] "Fleming's Bond did not enjoy killing; Craig's Bond seems almost <b>to</b> <b>relish</b> it." [...] Andrew Sarris of The New York Observer wrote that this particular Bond film is [...] "the very first that I would seriously consider placing on my own yearly 10-best list. Furthermore, I consider Daniel Craig to be the most effective and appealing of the six actors who have played 007, and that includes even Sean Connery." ...|$|E
