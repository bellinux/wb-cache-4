30|$|With China’s rapid {{economic}} development, {{it is important}} to formulate reasonable <b>and</b> feasible <b>tax</b> <b>and</b> <b>fee</b> policies to promote the development and utilization of low-grade oil and gas resources to guarantee China’s energy supply security. In this paper, by analyzing major problems of China’s current <b>tax</b> <b>and</b> <b>fee</b> policies for oil and gas resources, a reform program for low-grade oil and gas resources is designed from the aspects of tax/fee items and tax/fee rates. The impacts of this reform program on China and China’s oil companies during the “Twe lfth Five-Year Plan” are investigated according to the related data in 2008. The results show that the proposed <b>tax</b> <b>and</b> <b>fee</b> reform program will lower the tax burden of oil companies, promote the development of low-grade oil and gas resources, and increase China’s GDP and national fiscal revenue. Besides that, it will bring positive social effects by increasing employment opportunities.|$|R
40|$|As {{alternatives}} to more general taxes based on broad measures of each taxpayer 2 ̆ 7 s economic capacity, benefit <b>taxes</b> <b>and</b> user <b>fees</b> are praised by some for promoting economic efficiency, government accountability <b>and</b> <b>tax</b> fairness, <b>and</b> condemned by others as reactionary, regressive, and distributively unjust. This paper adopts a more even-handed approach to benefit <b>taxes</b> <b>and</b> user <b>fees,</b> regarding these sources of revenue as preferable to general taxation for specific purposes but inferior to general taxes for other purposes. Part II provides {{a theoretical framework}} for analyzing benefit <b>taxes</b> <b>and</b> user <b>fees,</b> defining these levies in contrast to general taxes, examining theoretical arguments for and against government reliance on benefit <b>taxes</b> <b>and</b> user <b>fees,</b> considering the appropriate role of benefit <b>taxes</b> <b>and</b> user <b>fees</b> as methods of government finance, and reviewing {{the manner in which}} these levies should be designed in order to achieve the purposes for which they are best suited.

Because politicians are reluctant to raise tax levels to cover desired levels of transportation expenditures, policy makers are searching for revenue options with strong public support. The results of two surveys provide some optimism for implementing new options, such as tolling. Respondents also reacted positively to linking fees with environmental objectives. Three tax options [...] gas <b>taxes,</b> sales <b>taxes,</b> <b>and</b> vehicle license <b>fees</b> [...] had virtually the same levels of overall support, about 40 %.

25|$|The purchase-like Cafritz lease was controversial. Since no deeds for the {{improvements}} changed hands, Cafritz {{was able to}} avoid paying $3 million in transfer taxes and recordation fees. Since the District of Columbia did not tax leases, Cafritz only paid <b>taxes</b> <b>and</b> <b>fees</b> on the land, which amounted to only $620,000. Elected officials in the cash-strapped city were angered by the deal, and worried that numerous other purchase-like leases would soon wreak havoc on the city's income from transfer taxes. The controversy raged for several months until, in May 1989, the D.C. City Council approved legislation increasing the transfer tax and closing the purchase-like lease loophole.|$|E

25|$|Contrary to a stockbroker, a {{professional}} who arranges transactions between a buyer and a seller, {{and gets a}} guaranteed commission for every deal executed, {{a professional}} trader may have a steep learning curve and his/her ultra-competitive performance based career may be cut short, especially during generalized stock market crashes. Stock market trading operations have a considerably high level of risk, uncertainty and complexity, especially for unwise and inexperienced stock traders/investors seeking {{an easy way to}} make money quickly. In addition, trading activities are not free. Stock speculators/investors face several costs such as commissions, <b>taxes</b> <b>and</b> <b>fees</b> to be paid for the brokerage and other services, like the buying/selling orders placed at the stock exchange. Depending on the nature of each national or state legislation involved, a large array of fiscal obligations must be respected, and taxes are charged by jurisdictions over those transactions, dividends and capital gains that fall within their scope. However, these fiscal obligations will vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. Among other reasons, there could be some instances where taxation is already incorporated into the stock price through the differing legislation that companies have to comply with in their respective jurisdictions; or that tax free stock market operations are useful to boost economic growth. Beyond these costs are the opportunity costs of money and time, currency risk, financial risk, and Internet, data and news agency services and electricity consumption expenses—all of which must be accounted for.|$|E
25|$|Following the USL {{victory at}} the December 2012 {{parliamentary}} election, including Ponta winning 61% {{of the vote in}} his own seat, where he was challenged by Dan Diaconescu, Băsescu named Ponta to another term as premier. Subsequently, the two signed a cooperation accord, while tensions with the PNL deepened. These grew especially apparent in April 2013, when Ponta, as interim Justice Minister, named Laura Codruța Kövesi to head the National Anticorruption Directorate (DNA) in spite of objections from the PNL, who viewed her as a Băsescu ally. In February 2014, the PNL left the government, marking the end of the USL, the precipitating motive being Ponta's refusal to name Klaus Iohannis as deputy prime minister. Ponta, by now head of a Social Democratic Union (USD) involving his party, the National Union for the Progress of Romania (UNPR) and the PC, went on to form a new government with the Democratic Union of Hungarians in Romania (UDMR). During Ponta's first two years in office, his cabinets significantly raised the salaries of public-sector employees, which Băsescu and his allies had cut by 25% in 2010. At the same time, he raised or introduced a number of <b>taxes</b> <b>and</b> <b>fees,</b> one of the most widely-felt being an increase in the fuel tax. He confronted two environmentally sensitive issues: the Roșia Montană Project, which he initially opposed but later became more open to the idea; and shale gas extraction through fracking, which he first backed but then shifted to preferring exploitation of natural gas from the Black Sea.|$|E
