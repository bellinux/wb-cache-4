500|$|The Chicago Black Hawks signed Bentley to a {{contract}} {{in the fall of}} 1939. [...] He had previously been placed on the protected list of the Montreal Canadiens, meaning they were the only NHL team eligible to sign him to {{a contract}}. [...] They subsequently dealt his NHL rights to the Boston Bruins for Vic Myles. [...] When he and brother Max went to Boston for a tryout camp, Bruins' owner Art Ross declared them [...] "among the worst amateurs <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> camp". However, by the time Chicago signed him, Bentley had established himself {{as one of the top}} forwards on the prairies.|$|E
500|$|Ike and Tina began {{a sexual}} {{relationship}} in 1959, much to Tina's chagrin. Ike also felt guilt over the relationship, stating later that having sex with Tina {{felt as if he}} were having sex with a sibling. Recalling to Rolling Stone in 1986, the first time she had sex with Ike Tina said, [...] "He had broken up with the mother of his two sons, who I ended up raising. He was without a girlfriend. One of the musicians said he was going <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> room and have sex with me. I couldn't lock the door, so I went to sleep with Ike, thinking he would protect me. Shit! It happened then, but I thought, 'Well, okay, I'll just do it once.' Didn't really know what to do because I wasn't turned on to him, even though it was good." [...] In her book, Tina stated the couple married in Tijuana, in 1962. She recalled the first time Ike physically abused her began after she told him she was considering leaving Ike's group due to financial disputes and their own confusing relationship. Tina said Ike grabbed a shoe stretcher and hit her in the head with it. Afterwards, Tina said, Ike asked her to have sex with him. Tina wrote in her memoirs, I, Tina, that the incident was the first time Ike had [...] "instilled fear" [...] in her.|$|E

2500|$|In 1849-50, Courbet painted Stone-Breakers (destroyed in the Allied Bombing of Dresden in 1945), which Proudhon admired as an icon {{of peasant}} life; it has been called [...] "the first of his great works". The {{painting}} {{was inspired by a}} scene Courbet witnessed on the roadside. He later explained to Champfleury and the writer Francis Wey: [...] "It is not often that one encounters so complete an expression of poverty and so, right then and there I got the idea for a painting.

6000|$|... "Your {{sister-in-law}} {{has just}} been to see me, Mr. Dallison. She's such a dear-so interested in everything. I tried <b>to</b> get her <b>to</b> <b>come</b> on <b>to</b> <b>my</b> meeting with me." ...|$|R
