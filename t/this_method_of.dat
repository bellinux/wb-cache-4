5|$|The {{simplest}} {{method of}} forecasting the weather, persistence, relies upon today's conditions to forecast the conditions tomorrow. This {{can be a}} valid way of forecasting the weather when {{it is in a}} steady state, such as during the summer season in the tropics. <b>This</b> <b>method</b> <b>of</b> forecasting strongly depends upon the presence of a stagnant weather pattern. Therefore, when in a fluctuating weather pattern, <b>this</b> <b>method</b> <b>of</b> forecasting becomes inaccurate. It can be useful in both short range forecasts and long range forecasts.|$|E

5|$|At first, most of {{the newly}} settled Normans kept {{household}} knights and did not settle their retainers with fiefs of their own, but gradually these household knights came to be granted lands of their own, {{a process known as}} subinfeudation. William also required his newly created magnates to contribute fixed quotas of knights towards not only military campaigns but also castle garrisons. <b>This</b> <b>method</b> <b>of</b> organising the military forces was a departure from the pre-Conquest English practice of basing military service on territorial units such as the hide.|$|E

5|$|Attacks {{against the}} Han River pontoon bridges at Seoul {{do not seem}} to have been {{successful}} until FEAF ordered the Bomber Command to lay delayed action bombs alongside the bridges on August 27, set to detonate at night. <b>This</b> <b>method</b> <b>of</b> attack seems to have caused such heavy casualties among the North Korean labor force trying to keep the pontoons in repair that they finally abandoned the effort. These bridges remained unfinished when the UN forces recaptured Seoul later in the year.|$|E
5|$|Because {{its feet}} are located so far {{back on its}} body, the red-throated loon is quite clumsy walking on land, but it can use its feet to shove itself forward on its breast. Young use <b>this</b> <b>method</b> <b>of</b> {{covering}} ground when moving from their breeding pools to larger bodies of water, including rivers and the sea. It is the only species of loon able to take off directly from land. If frightened, it may submerge until only its head or bill shows above {{the surface of the}} water.|$|E
5|$|Binary search trees lend {{themselves}} to fast searching in external memory stored in hard disks, as binary search trees can effectively be structured in filesystems. The B-tree generalizes <b>this</b> <b>method</b> <b>of</b> tree organization; B-trees are frequently used to organize long-term storage such as databases and filesystems.|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe paper {{develops}} a systemic use of boolean {{models in the}} model theory of infinitary languages. This yields a notion of (boolean) saturated model for denumerable sublanguages of Lα 1 ω. <b>This</b> <b>methods</b> <b>of</b> saturated models are then applied; in particular results of “upward Löwenheim-Skolem” type and results relating syntactic and semantic properties are obtained...|$|R

5|$|Concentrated {{solar power}} plants may use thermal storage to store solar energy, such as in {{high-temperature}} molten salts. These salts are an effective storage medium because they are low-cost, have a high specific heat capacity, and can deliver heat at temperatures compatible with conventional power systems. <b>This</b> <b>method</b> <b>of</b> energy storage is used, for example, by the Solar Two power station, allowing it to store 1.44TJ in its 68m³ storage tank, enough to provide full output for close to 39 hours, with an efficiency of about 99%.|$|E
5|$|During the Pittston strike, the UMWA {{wanted to}} only use nonviolent means of {{protest against the}} company. Many union members practiced <b>this</b> <b>method</b> <b>of</b> civil disobedience and found {{creative}} ways for their message to be heard such as mass sit down strike and road blockades. However, many wildcat strikers ignored {{the request of the}} UMWA and used violence to express the anger that they felt toward the Pittston Coal Company. By the time the strike had ended, over 4,000people had been arrested for their actions.|$|E
5|$|In August the UN {{also began}} using Korean civilians with A-frames as cargo {{carriers}} to move supplies {{up through the}} mountains to the front lines. <b>This</b> <b>method</b> <b>of</b> transport proved both cheaper and more efficient than using pack animals. American units obtained the civilian carriers through arrangements with the ROK Army. Soon the American divisions were using Korean labor for nearly all unskilled work, at an average of about 500 laborers and carriers to a division.|$|E

50|$|Election {{campaign}} communication research suffers {{criticism for}} lacking interdisciplinary exchange, e.g. between political science, psycho-sociology and media and communications science. Another reproach {{is being made}} for a too Western-centered scope of research, e.g., disregarding campaigning practices in African or Asian nations. Related to <b>this,</b> <b>methods</b> <b>of</b> international comparison are criticized for an insufficient consideration of country-specific political cultures, norms and language-barriers.|$|R
5|$|Storm petrels use {{a variety}} of {{techniques}} to aid flight. Most species will occasionally feed by surface pattering, holding and moving their feet on the water's surface while holding steady above the water. They remain stationary by hovering with rapid fluttering or by using the wind to anchor themselves in place. <b>This</b> <b>method</b> <b>of</b> feeding flight is more commonly used by Oceanitidae storm petrels however. Northern storm petrels also use dynamic soaring, gliding across wave fronts gaining energy from the vertical wind gradient.|$|E
5|$|Taylor gave up {{appealing}} {{his sentence}} after his request for retrial {{was rejected by}} the Utah Supreme Court. He became the second person to be executed by firing squad in the United States (after Gary Gilmore) since the death penalty was reinstated in 1976. Taylor said he chose <b>this</b> <b>method</b> <b>of</b> execution to embarrass the state of Utah. On January 26, 1996, the day of Taylor's execution, legislation was introduced in the Utah House of Representatives to eliminate the firing squad.|$|E

Others are kept in aquariums or used in research, especially in the fields of genetics and developmental biology.|$|E

5|$|The UMWA {{tried to}} focus the strikers on civil disobedience and often stepped in to stop the wildcat strikers. The union members used many {{different}} nonviolent strike tactics. These acts included standing and blocking the roads that the coal trucks would travel, mass sit down strikes, and large groups of people picketing outside of the Pittston coal mines. <b>This</b> <b>method</b> <b>of</b> protesting helped the UMWA gain support from other people around the country.|$|E

5|$|<b>This</b> <b>method</b> <b>of</b> {{economic}} analysis seeks to overcome gender bias by showing how {{men and women}} differ in their consumption, investment or saving behavior. Gender disaggregation strategies justify the separation of macroeconomic variables by gender. Korkut Ertürk and Nilüfer Çağatay show how the feminization of labor stimulates investment, while an increase in female activity in housework raises savings. This model highlights how gender effects macroeconomic variables and shows that economies have a higher likelihood of recovering from downturns if women participate {{in the labor force}} more, instead of devoting their time to housework.|$|E

5|$|A change {{occurred}} {{in the game and}} the role of the goalkeeper in the 1880s, when the Scottish reduced the size of the scoring area by placing rugby posts, spaced about 10 feet apart, at each end of the pool. At the same time, the rules were changed to allow goalkeepers to stand on the pool deck and leap onto the head of an opposing player who approached the goal. This change in the rules was brief. To prevent the serious injuries that resulted from <b>this</b> <b>method</b> <b>of</b> goalkeeping, the rules were revised again to require the goalie to remain in the water.|$|E
