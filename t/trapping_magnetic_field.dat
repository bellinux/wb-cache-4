It is shown that the spatial as well as generalized time reversal symmetries lead to a two-fold degeneracy of the electronic states {{in the presence of}} the external field. A delicate interplay between the Coulomb and magnetic interactions in the inhomogeneous field leads to an unusual weak field splitting of the energy levels as well as complex spatial patterns of the corresponding spin polarization density of individual Rydberg states. Remarkably the magnetic quadrupole field induces a permanent electric dipole moment of the atom. The past two decades have seen substantial progress of our knowledge on highly excited Rydberg atoms exposed to homogeneous magnetic fields providing major impact on areas such as quantum chaos, semiclassics of nonintegrable systems and properties of magnetized structures [1, 2, 3, 4].

40|$|Quantum {{transition}} probabilities and {{quantum entanglement}} for two-qubit states of a four level trapped ion quantum system are computed for time-evolving ionic states driven by Jaynes-Cummings Hamiltonians with interactions mapped onto a SU(2) ⊗SU(2) group structure. Using the correspondence {{of the method}} of simulating a 3 + 1 dimensional Dirac-like Hamiltonian for bi-spinor particles into a single trapped ion, one preliminarily obtains the analytical tools for describing ionic state transition probabilities as a typical quantum oscillation feature. For Dirac-like structures driven by generalized Poincaré classes of coupling potentials, one also identifies the SU(2) ⊗SU(2) internal degrees of freedom corresponding to intrinsic parity and spin polarization as an adaptive platform for computing the quantum entanglement between the internal quantum subsystems which define two-qubit ionic states. The obtained quantum correlational content is then translated into the quantum entanglement of two-qubit ionic states with quantum numbers related to the total angular momentum and to its projection onto {{the direction of the}} <b>trapping</b> <b>magnetic</b> <b>field.</b> Experimentally, the controllable parameters simulated by ion traps can be mapped into a Dirac-like system in the presence of an electrostatic field which, in this case, is associated to ionic carrier interactions.

40|$|The {{stresses}} {{produced by}} magnetorotational turbulence can provide effective angular momentum transport in accretion disks. However, questions remain {{about the ability}} of simulated disks to reproduce observationally inferred stress-to-gas-pressure ratios. In this paper we present a set of high resolution global magnetohydrodynamic disk simulations which are initialised with different field configurations: purely toroidal, vertical field lines, and nested poloidal loops. A mass source term is included which allows the total disk mass to equilibrate in simulations with long run times, and also enables the impact of rapid mass injection to be explored. Notably different levels of angular momentum transport are observed during the early-time transient disk evolution. However, given sufficient time to relax, the different models evolve to a statistically similar quasi-steady state with a stress-to-gas-pressure ratio, α∼ 0. 032 - 0. 036. The indication from our results is that steady, isolated disks may be unable to maintain a large-scale magnetic field or produce values for the stress-to-gas-pressure ratio implied by some observations. Supplementary simulations exploring the influence of <b>trapping</b> <b>magnetic</b> <b>field,</b> injecting vertical field, and rapidly injecting additional mass into the disk show that large stresses (α∼ 0. 1 - 0. 25) can be induced by these mechanisms. The simulations highlight the common late-time evolution and characteristics of turbulent disks for which the magnetic field is allowed to evolve freely. If the boundaries of the disk, the rate of injection of magnetic field, or the rate of mass replenishment are modified to mimic astrophysical disks, markedly different disk evolution occurs.

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} work aimed towards achieving sideband cooling of 40 Ca+ ions in a Penning trap. The {{observation of}} {{an increase in}} the number of quantum jumps as a function of the <b>trapping</b> <b>magnetic</b> <b>field</b> is first presented. This observation is explained by the ion falling into a long-lived D 5 / 2 state, out of which the ion is not being re-pumped. The ion can fall into this state due to mixing of the fine structure components with the same mJ quantum number induced by the applied magnetic field. A calculation of the mixing and shelving rate as a function of magnetic field strength is presented. This theory matches well with the experimental results observed. This work has been presented in a publication in which a perturbative analysis was used. An alternative analysis is presented here in which the full Hamiltonian is diagonalised. The essential conclusions however remain unchanged. This ‘J-state mixing’ effect means re-pumping from each of the six D 5 / 2 state sub-levels of our ion is required for efficient laser cooling. This is achieved by the addition of a system comprising an 854 nm laser and a fibre EOM to provide the radiation required to re-pump these levels. The same EOM is then used to re-pump out of the four sub-levels of the D 3 / 2 state using a single 866 nm laser. This is a great simplification of the experimental setup required to cool a 40 Ca+ ion in a Penning trap which would otherwise require ten separate lasers to independently address each of the D sub-states. Achieving efficient repumping leads to the ability to perform pulsed spectroscopy on the quadrupole S 1 / 2 → D 5 / 2 transition in 40 Ca+.

Assuming all SNe within a given ∆m 15 (B) range form a distinct sub-class, we fit a combined light-curve for all class members with a variety of models. We improve our previous calculations of energy deposition rates by including the transport of the comptonized electrons. Their non-local and time-dependent energy deposition produces a correction of as much as ≤ 0. 10 m for Chandrasekhar models and ≤ 0. 18 m for sub-Chandrasekhar models. We find that applying a filter efficiency correction, derived from measured spectra, to B, V, R, and I light-curves after day 50 can produce a consistent bolometric light-curve. The V band is an accurate indicator of total emission in the 3500 ˚A- 9700 ˚A range, with a constant fraction (∼ 25 %) appearing in the V band after day 50. This suggests that the V band scales with the bolometric luminosity, and that the deposited energy is instantaneously recycled into optical emission during this epoch. Varying bolometric corrections for the other bands are derived. We see significant evolution of the colors of SNe Ia between day 50 and day 170. We suggest that {{this may be due to}} the transition from spectra dominated by emission lines from the radioactive nucleus, 56 Co, to those from the stable daughter nucleus, 56 Fe.

40|$|Experimental and {{modelling}} {{data for}} <b>trapped</b> <b>magnetic</b> <b>field</b> profiles for stacks of superconducting tape in different stacking arrangements. The {{data were collected}} in August 2015 in the Applied Superconductivity and Cryoscience Group (ASCG) laboratory in Cambridge. Experimental field profiles were for stacks of tape made using Roebel cable offcuts received from the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology (KIT). Full details {{can be found in}} the linked paper.

40|$|Based on DC {{magnetization}} measurements, {{the temperature}} dependencies of the <b>trapped</b> <b>magnetic</b> <b>field</b> have been calculated for two MgB 2 samples prepared by two different techniques: the high-pressure sintering {{and the hot}} pressing. Experimentally measured trapped field values for the first sample coincide remarkably well with calculated ones in the whole temperature range. This proves, from one side, {{the validity of the}} introduced calculation approach, and demonstrates, from another side, the great prospects of the hot pressing technology for large scale superconducting applications of the MgB 2.

40|$|Applications of the {{extended}} critical state model are considered. The <b>trapped</b> <b>magnetic</b> <b>field,</b> the penetration field and the field dependence of the critical current density are analysed. The critical current density and the trapped field in superconducting grains depend on the grain size. Asymmetry of the hysteresis curves relative to the M = 0 axis {{is related to the}} scale of the current circulation.
