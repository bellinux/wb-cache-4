Regardless, they confirmed a reputation for audacity and courage, winning the only two Victoria Crosses of the land campaign, despite their small numbers. Yet Australian involvement was barely noticed at home {{at the time and}} made little difference to the outcome of the war. Total casualties included 10 killed and 40 wounded, with most deaths being from disease during operations in Mesopotamia.|$|E
5|$|From {{a modern}} perspective, {{we say that}} QED is not well defined as a quantum field theory to {{arbitrarily}} high energy.

This is one of <b>the</b> <b>motivations</b> for embedding QED within a Grand Unified Theory.|$|E
5|$|Critics of {{the planned}} exhibit, {{especially}} those of the American Legion and the Air Force Association, charged that the exhibit focused too much attention on the Japanese casualties inflicted by the nuclear bomb, rather than on <b>the</b> <b>motivations</b> for the bombing or {{the discussion of the}} bomb's role in ending the conflict with Japan. The exhibit brought to national attention many long-standing academic and political issues related to retrospective views of the bombings. As a result, after various failed attempts to revise the exhibit {{in order to meet the}} satisfaction of competing interest groups, the exhibit was canceled on 30 January 1995. Martin O. Harwit, Director of the National Air and Space Museum, was compelled to resign over the controversy.|$|E

He documents the CIA's involvement in the 1953 Iranian coup d'état, and provides a biographical assessment of <b>the</b> <b>motivations</b> of Mohammad Mosaddegh, the Iranian leader deposed in the coup.

The Cathars were brutally suppressed and the autonomous County of Toulouse formally submitted to the crown of France.

There is also a positive statistical correlation between self-harm and emotional abuse. Self-harm may become a means of managing and controlling pain, in contrast to the pain experienced earlier in the person's life of which they had no control over (e.g., through abuse).|$|E

5|$|Kristins Hall is {{an arena}} located at Stampesletta in Lillehammer, Norway. It consist of an ice rink, a {{combined}} handball and floorball court, and a curling rink. The venue, {{owned and operated}} by the Lillehammer Municipality, opened in 1988 and cost 65 million Norwegian krone (NOK) to build. One of <b>the</b> <b>motivations</b> for its construction was to help Lillehammer's bid to be selected as the host of the 1994 Winter Olympics. The ice rink has a capacity for 3,194 spectators and is the home rink of GET-ligaen hockey club Lillehammer IK. Kristins Hall is located next to the larger Håkons Hall, which opened in 1993.

5|$|The {{desire to}} self-harm {{is a common}} symptom of {{borderline}} personality disorder. People with other mental disorders may also self-harm, including those with depression, anxiety disorders, substance abuse, eating disorders, post-traumatic stress disorder, schizophrenia, and several personality disorders. Self-harm can also occur in high-functioning individuals who have no underlying mental health diagnosis. <b>The</b> <b>motivations</b> for self-harm vary. Some {{use it as a}} coping mechanism to provide temporary relief of intense feelings such as anxiety, depression, stress, emotional numbness, or a sense of failure. Self-harm is often associated with a history of trauma, including emotional and sexual abuse. There are a number of different methods {{that can be used to}} treat self-harm and which concentrate on either treating the underlying causes or on treating the behaviour itself. When self-harm is associated with depression, antidepressant drugs and therapy may be effective. Other approaches involve avoidance techniques, which focus on keeping the individual occupied with other activities, or replacing the act of self-harm with safer methods that do not lead to permanent damage.|$|E

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>motivations</b> of {{the three}} in the infighting are not {{completely}} clear. According to Friedrich Katz, Madero, in refusing to let Navarro be killed, was motivated not only by his personal humanism but also by a need to assert his civilian authority over military leaders. It also seems that Villa was mostly concerned with {{taking care of his}} soldiers and his personal hatred for Navarro, since it was his soldiers—known as Villistas—who Navarro had earlier ordered to be bayoneted. Years later, after he fell out with Orozco, Villa wrote in his memoirs that the whole episode was a set-up by Orozco, who had been paid 50,000 pesos by Díaz's agents to get him to kill Madero. While Katz and other scholars consider this assessment extreme, it is possible that Orozco, who believed he should be the rightful leader of the revolution, was trying to provoke Villa into killing Madero. That way Madero would be out of the way, Villa would be discredited among the intellectual revolutionary circles as a common bandit and Orozco could claim the mantle of leadership. In the end, however, Villa kept his cool, Madero convinced common soldiers to support him and Orozco did not have the nerve to go through with it.|$|E

In recognition of his research he was awarded the Stalin Prize in 1953, membership in the Communist Party of the Soviet Union in 1955 and the Soviet Academy of Sciences in 1958, and two Orders of Lenin. He was awarded the Lenin Prize in 1964 for his work on the weak interaction. He began a lifelong affair with Rodam Amiredzhibi, the wife of poet Mikhail Arkadyevich Svetlov, in 1950. In 1955 he appeared in public at a press conference where he explained to the world <b>the</b> <b>motivations</b> of his choice to leave the West and work in the Soviet Union.
