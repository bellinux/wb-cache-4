5000|$|The Indonesian {{government}} {{was reported to}} have evacuated around 17,500 people from the region on and around the volcano. The government issued the highest-level warning for the area, which was expected to remain in force for around a week, since scientists were unfamiliar with the characteristics of the volcano, due to it having been dormant for so long. The government also set up kitchens for refugees to have access to food and handed out 7,000 masks. Over 10,000 people have been internally evacuated after the eruption, Secretary of the provincial administration, Edy Sofyan told Xinhua by phone. Spokesman of National Disaster Management Agency Priyadi Kardono said the eruption had not been predicted earlier like other volcanoes and that authorities must conduct a quick preparation for emergency work because Mount Sinabung’s seismic activity has been monitored intensively only since Friday after it showed an increase in activity. In the wake of the eruption, the National Disaster Management Agency (Badan Nasional Penanggulangan Bencana/BNPB), supported the roughly 27,489 displaced people by providing shelters. In addition, [...] "BNPB has distributed 1,000 blankets, 1,000 sleeping mats and 500 family tents.

60|$|It {{was about}} eleven o'clock {{when we reached}} Elandslaagte Station. A train awaited the prisoners. There were six or seven closed vans {{for the men and}} a {{first-class}} carriage for the officers. Into a compartment of this we were speedily bundled. Two Boers with rifles sat themselves between us, and the doors were locked. I was desperately hungry, and asked for both food and water. 'Plenty is coming,' they said, so we waited patiently, and sure enough, in a few minutes a railway official came along the platform, opened the door, and thrust before us in generous profusion two <b>tins</b> <b>of</b> preserved mutton, two <b>tins</b> <b>of</b> preserved <b>fish,</b> four or five loaves, half a dozen pots of jam, and a large can of tea. As far as I could see the soldiers fared no worse. The reader will believe that we did not stand on ceremony, but fell to at once and made the first satisfying meal for three days. While we ate a great crowd of Boers gathered around the train and peered curiously in at the windows. One of them was a doctor, who, noticing that my hand was bound up, inquired whether I were wounded. The cut caused by the splinter of bullet was insignificant, but since it was ragged and had received no attention for two days it had begun to fester. I therefore showed him my hand, and he immediately bustled off to get bandages and hot water and what not, with which, amid the approving grins of the rough fellows who thronged the platform, he soon bound me up very correctly.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} the national development policy of coastal fisheries in Vanuatu {{and its role}} in improving the living conditions and nutrition of the people. This policy has focused on the exploitation <b>of</b> deep-sea bottom-dwelling <b>fish</b> along the reef slope and the creation <b>of</b> commercial <b>fishing</b> associations at the village level; these associations were supposed to improve the diets of urban and rural people, to reduce the imports <b>of</b> <b>tinned</b> <b>fish,</b> to develop cash economies in village communities, and to create employment in order to reduce migration to cities. In view of the significant sums of money injected by international aid and the poor results achieved, this policy can be deemed to have been, so far, a failure. Though it is not encouraged by the Vanuatu Government, small-scale unstructured fishing is more efficient, in terms of both nutrition and substitution for imported fish. In the future, this fishing should not be neglected. An increase of fisheries production would appear to be possible at very little cost by equipping sailing canoes with small engines and by introducing simple and low-cost ways <b>of</b> preserving <b>fish.</b> Key words: developmental planning; marine resource; small-scale fishing...|$|R

'I buried a man there, {{a retired}} sea captain {{who had spent}} some twenty {{years of his life}} in China, and his widow was a Chinese woman, a little dot of a thing, rather nice-looking. She spoke a little English and more Maori. We walked through the Pa to the burial- ground, some twenty natives all dressed in black, i.e. {{something}} black about them, and many in a good suit, attending the funeral. Levi had spent the day before (Sunday) with them and had told them about me. As I approached the Pa before the funeral they all raised the native cry of welcome, the [...] "Tangi." [...] I advanced, speaking to them collectively, and then went through the ceremony of shaking hands with each one in order as they stood in a row, saying something, if I could think of it, to each. After the funeral they all (according to native custom) sat down in the open air, round a large cloth on the ground, on which were spread <b>tins</b> <b>of</b> potatoes, <b>fish,</b> pork, &c. The leader came to me and said, [...] "This is the Maori fashion. Come, my friend, and sit with us," [...] and deposited three bottles of beer at my feet, while provisions enough for Dan Lambert were stored around--a sort of Homeric way of honouring me, and perhaps they made a Benjamin of me. However, I had already eaten a mouldy biscuit and had a glass of beer at the house of the Chinawoman, so I only said grace for them, and after talking a little while, I shook hands all round and went off. Their hands, being used as knives and forks, were not a little greasy; but of course one does not think of that.|$|R
