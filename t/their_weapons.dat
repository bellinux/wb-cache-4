5|$|A {{problem with}} early bombsights {{was that they}} could only correct {{for the effects of}} the wind in a simple way and {{required}} the bomber to fly directly up- or down-wind from the target, to minimise the complexity of the required calculations. This made it difficult to attack moving targets and allowed anti-aircraft artillery to sight <b>their</b> <b>weapons</b> along the wind line.|$|E

5|$|According to the Earps' {{version of}} events, {{the fight was}} in self-defense because the Cowboys, armed in {{violation}} of local ordinance, aggressively threatened the lawmen and defied a lawful order to hand over <b>their</b> <b>weapons.</b> The Cowboys maintained that they raised their hands, offering no resistance, and were shot in cold blood by the Earps. Sorting out who {{was telling the truth}} was difficult and remains so.|$|E

They and <b>their</b> <b>weapons</b> reached the island on 31 May.

Early-batch of this class equipped with one Bofors 40 mm L/60 gun like the Daiou-class, but latter-batch had changed <b>their</b> <b>weapon</b> to the new Oerlikon KDC 35mm gun.

5|$|The film advising company Warriors Inc. was enlisted {{to ensure}} the war scenes, {{including}} the attire worn by the actors, looked authentic. Former members of the U.S. military taught the actors how to handle, fire, and reload <b>their</b> <b>weapons,</b> as well as perform various tactical movements. The opening war scene was filmed over three weeks and required fifty stuntmen. Animatics were used to map out the necessary camera angles for filming.|$|E

There were many complaints about the weapons clogging up with sand after prolonged use in the desert environment.|$|E
50|$|The {{object of}} the game is to defend the VIP from assassins and zombies for a set amount of time. Once that time is met, the player {{progresses}} to another level. Each new level will present a randomly generated city, and a new weapon for the player. The levels get progressively harder. Aiming <b>their</b> <b>weapon,</b> the player is not presented with an aiming reticule as is common in most first-person shooter games, but allows the player to use the ironsight of <b>their</b> <b>weapon.</b>|$|R

5|$|After {{targeting}} another {{character and}} initiating combat, the player and his opponent will damage each other automatically with <b>their</b> <b>weapons.</b> This continues until the player stops or {{the target is}} dead. Each profession's unique nano programs, perks and research also provide combat abilities used by the player during the fight. These can heal the owner, cause additional damage, lower {{the skills of the}} enemy, blind them or otherwise hinder the enemy's ability to fight. Once the target is dead, the player is able to loot money and items from the enemy's body.|$|E

5|$|Along {{with items}} and money earned from battles, winning battles earns {{experience}} points which increases each party member's level and {{allows them to}} learn skills from <b>their</b> <b>weapons.</b> Performing well in battles, such as achieving quick victories or successful Session Attacks, increases party members' Stage Level, which unlock Performa for Radiant Skills and opens up new side stories. The game ends, sending the player back to the title screen, if all party members are knocked unconscious by running out of HP.|$|E

5|$|Criticism of the game's {{handling}} of ground combat upon its initial release prompted Paragon {{to issue an}} updated version 3.0 {{of the game in}} late 1990 which featured an enhanced combat system. The new version offered the ability for the player to pause repeatedly the real-time combat to order party members to change their positions or fire <b>their</b> <b>weapons</b> at a selected opponent. This update was made available without charge to everyone who had purchased an earlier version of the game.|$|E
