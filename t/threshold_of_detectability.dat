A particular concern is the possibility of a foreign object that attaches itself to a satellite in orbit for adverse reasons. A frequency response analysis was used to determine the changes in mass and moment of inertia of the space structure based on a change in the natural frequencies of the structure or components of the structure. Feasibility studies were first conducted on a 7 in x 19 in aluminum plate with various boundary conditions, which was impacted with a mallet and the frequency response was determined. The frequency response for the blank plate was used as the basis for detection of the addition, and possibly the location, of added masses on the plate. Statistical variation of the data was determined to allow variations of frequency due to added mass and thermal changes to be evaluated. Effect on damping was also investigated. The test results were compared to both analytical solutions and finite element models created in SAP 2000.

The calibration process consists {{of a number of}} steps: (1) populating the database with independently identified regional events; (2) developing regional boundaries and pre-identifying severe regional phase blockage zones; (3) measuring and calibrating coda based magnitude scales; (4 a) measuring regional amplitudes and making magnitude and distance amplitude corrections (MDAC); (4 b) applying the DOE modified kriging methodology to MDAC results using the regionalized background model; (5) determining the <b>thresholds</b> <b>of</b> <b>detectability</b> <b>of</b> regional phases as a function of phase type and frequency; (6) evaluating regional phase discriminant performance both singly and in combination; (7) combining steps 1 - 6 to create a calibrated discrimination surface for each stations; (8) assessing progress and iterating. We have now developed this calibration procedure {{to the point where it}} is fairly straightforward to apply earthquake-explosion discrimination in regions with ample empirical data. Several of the steps outlined above are discussed in greater detail in other DOE papers in this volume or in recent publications. Here we emphasize the results of the above process: station correction surfaces and their improvement to discrimination results compared with simpler calibration methods. Some of the outstanding discrimination research issues involve cases in which there is little or no empirical data. For example in many cases there is no regional nuclear explosion data at IMS stations or nearby surrogates. We have taken two approaches to this problem, first finding and using mining explosion data when available, and second using test-site based models to transport earthquake-explosion discrimination behavior to new regions. Finally an important component of our research is assessing improvement in the ability to discriminate events. By combining the multivariate discriminants with the threshold detection curves for the regional seismic phases used in those discriminants, we have started to make maps of the probability an event will be identified properly. These maps serve a broad range of purposes from demonstrating progress to funding agencies to prioritizing {{research and}} calibration efforts...|$|R

40|$|We {{present an}} {{experimental}} study of the anisotropic resistivity of superconducting La(2 -x) Ba(x) CuO(4) with x= 0. 095 and transition temperature Tc= 32 K. In a magnetic field perpendicular to the CuO(2) layers, H(perp), we observe that the resistivity perpendicular to the layers, ρ(perp), becomes finite at a temperature consistent with previous studies on very similar materials; however, the onset of finite parallel resistivity, ρ(par), occurs {{at a much higher}} temperature. This behavior contradicts conventional theory, which predicts that ρ(perp) and ρ(par) should become finite at the same temperature. Voltage vs. current measurements near the <b>threshold</b> <b>of</b> voltage <b>detectability</b> indicate linear behavior perpendicular to the layers, becoming nonlinear at higher currents, while the behavior is nonlinear from the onset parallel to the layers. These results, in the presence of moderate H(perp), appear consistent with superconducting order parallel to the layers with voltage fluctuations between the layers due to thermal noise. In search of uncommon effects that might help to explain this behavior, we have performed diffraction measurements that provide evidence for H(perp) -induced charge and spin stripe order. The field-induced decoupling of superconducting layers is similar to the decoupled phase observed previously in La(2 -x) Ba(x) CuO(4) with x= 1 / 8 in zero field.

40|$|AbstractGeophysical {{characterization}} of the Devonian Nisku Formation in the Wabamun area, Alberta, Canada for large-scale CO 2 sequestration project {{has been successful in}} revealing two primary groups of anomalies. The first group is interpreted to be due to contrasts in lithology of the Nisku Formation. This interpretation is supported by constraints provided by well control, seismic modeling and petrophysical data. The second group is interpreted to be footprints of geological discontinuities which are induced by dissolution and karsting in a geologic formation shallower in the stratigraphy. Even though {{there is no evidence to}} indicate that the integrity of the Nisku Formation or the overlying caprock has been compromised, such geologic discontinuities should be taken into consideration if supercritical CO 2 were to be injected into the Nisku Formation. The analysis has identified favorable low-impedance high-porosity locations that could be developed for a CO 2 injection site. Those locations exhibit a good correlation with relatively high porosity-permeability zones of the Nisku Formation on maps derived from wireline data and core analysis using petrophysical analysis. Finally, fluid replacement modelling was undertaken to predict the feasibility of time-lapse seismic monitoring for detecting an injected CO 2 plume. The results suggest that changes in seismic response will most likely be subtle and that the plume will probably be at the lower <b>threshold</b> <b>of</b> seismic <b>detectability...</b>|$|R

It is extended to provide information regarding the detection of weak signals which complements the detectability method usually employed in ST radar studies.

Spectral moments errors are evaluated by a method which {{is an extension of}} the analytical method of estimation developed by Miller and Rochwarger and the results compared to other statistical and analytical models. As already known, three factors can affect the error on the estimated parameters: the signal-to-noise ratio, the spectral width and the incoherent integration number. For high signal-to-noise ratios, analytical results are in good agreement with Barrick's and Denenberg's theoretical models and with Yamamoto's statistical one. For low signal-to-noise ratios, the spectral parameters are more sensitive to the selected model but overall variability is similar...|$|R
40|$|With {{the sophistication}} and {{increased}} use of scintillation cameras in nuclear medicine, routine quality assurance procedures are needed to insure a consistent and acceptable level of performance. A set of simple protocols has been developed to facilitate use of these procedures in a daily quality assurance program. To implement application of the protocols, a workshop on quality assurance for scintillation cameras has been developed for presentation to clinical nuclear medicine personnel. The Scintillation Camera Quality Assurance Work-shop has been presented in eight locations, and information for the presentation of a workshop is available for nationwide distribution. In nuclear medicine, the interpretation of static images and dynamic function studies often depends critically {{on the quality of}} the images and data furnished by the equipment and techniques used. This critical dependence exists because abnormal conditions in the patient frequently are manifested as subtle changes in the images and data that are barely above the <b>threshold</b> <b>of</b> <b>detectability.</b> Sub-optimal equipment and techniques may cause these subtle changes to fall below the <b>threshold</b> <b>of</b> <b>detectability</b> and therefore pass unnoticed by the physician. For this reason, it is essential that nuclear medicine equipment and procedures be maintained at an acceptable level of performance at all times. To achieve this objective, a continuous program of quality assurance is needed in each medical institution with nuclear medicine facilities. Various advisory and regulatory agencies for nuclear medicine services have recognized the importance of quality assurance procedures in nuclear medicine by requiring that adequate testing procedures be performed and recorded regularly as conditions for accreditation and licensure.
