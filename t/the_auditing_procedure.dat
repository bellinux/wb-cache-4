40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{develops a}} formal {{model of a}} primary equity market in which costly state verification and asymmetric information require auditing policies and enforcement power to guarantee an efficient (second best) equilibrium and avoid market failure. The model captures some essential features of Third World capital markets, including unequal investment opportunity sets and the related asymmetry in information that results from {{a small group of}} insiders having controlling interests in most firms. ^ The model is sued to determine the optimal financial contract that is incentive compatible under the assumed asymmetric information structure and strict limited liability. Firms have random returns which can be verified by costly audits. A contract specifies the payoffs to the parties for each distinguishable state of nature, and <b>the</b> <b>auditing</b> <b>procedure</b> to be followed. Allowing for random auditing, a class of contracts is shown to be optimal under the condition that payoffs be restricted to fixed fractions of verified returns. This class of contracts encompasses both standard debt contracts and standard equity contracts. The exact nature of the optimal contract is shown to depend on the probability distribution of returns. ^ If more than one contract is allowed, it is shown that an optimal capital structure arises from the trade off between the agency costs associated with different financial contracts. ...|$|E

This Workshop shall support the development and implementation of the myEOrganics service and analyses technical and policy requirements for this business case in general. myEOrganics supports <b>the</b> <b>auditing</b> <b>procedure</b> of organic agriculture by providing information on several indicators, like nitrogen level in plants, field shape, etc. to auditors on a mobile app. The necessary information is derived from processed Earth Observation (EO) satellite data and enables the auditor to determine whether a field is being cultivated according to standards of organic farming or not, thus making the distinction between non-organically (i. e. conventionally) and organically grown crop. With the help of geo-referencing, this data can be used in-situ on a mobile device capable of geo-positioning by certification personnel during their audits. This Stakeholder Workshop within the myEOrganics project is targeted towards experts from different areas of organic farming, certification, satellite data management and processing, as well as related topics. myEOrganics and its business case will be discussed in order to identify potentials and barriers of its implementation, further discussions will take place to analyze the general potential of alike business cases (mobile satellite data based services for agriculture) ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background HCV is {{a leading}} cause of liver chronic {{diseases}} all over the world. In developed countries the highest prevalence of infection is reported among intravenous drug users and haemodialysis (HD) patients. The present report is to identify the pathway of HCV transmission during an outbreak of HCV infection in a privately run haemodialysis (HD) unit in Italy in 2005. Methods Dynamics of the outbreak and infection clinical outcomes were defined through an ambi-directional cohort study. Molecular epidemiology techniques were used to define the relationships between the viral variants infecting the patients and confirm the outbreak. Risk analysis and auditing procedures were carried out to define the transmission pathway(s). Results Of the 50 patients treated in the HD unit 5 were already anti-HCV positive and 13 became positive during the study period (AR = 28. 9 %). Phylogenic analysis identified that, all the molecularly characterized incident cases (10 out of 13), were infected with the same viral variant of one of the prevalent cases. The multivariate analysis and <b>the</b> <b>auditing</b> <b>procedure</b> disclosed a single event of multi-dose vials heparin contamination as the cause of transmission of the infection in 11 out of the 13 incident cases; 2 additional incident cases occurred possibly as a result of inappropriate risk management. Discussion More than 30 % of all HCV infections in developed countries results from poor application of standard precautions during percutaneous procedures. Comprehensive strategy which included: educational programmes, periodical auditing on standard precaution, use of single-dose vials whenever possible, prospective surveillance for blood-borne infections (including a system of prompt notification) and risk assessment/management dedicated staff are the cornerstone to contain and prevent outbreaks in HD Conclusions The outbreak described should serve as a reminder to HD providers that patients undergoing dialysis are at risk for HCV infection and that HCV may be easily transmitted whenever standard precautions are not strictly applied. </p...|$|E

Auditing standards settings bodies pointed out that auditor’s determination of materiality threshold is a matter of professional judjment.
