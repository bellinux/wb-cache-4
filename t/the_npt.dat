5|$|The PTBT was a {{first of}} a series of nuclear arms control {{treaties}} in the second half of 20th century. The PTBT has been considered the stepping stone to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) of 1968, which made explicit reference to the progress provided by the PTBT. In addition to <b>the</b> <b>NPT,</b> the PTBT was followed within ten years by the Outer Space Treaty and Treaty of Tlatelolco in 1967, Seabed Arms Control Treaty in 1971, and the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty in 1972.

In early 1993, while verifying North Korea's initial declaration, the IAEA concluded that there was strong evidence this declaration was incomplete.

25|$|Today, as a {{non-nuclear-weapon state}} party to <b>the</b> <b>NPT,</b> Brazil {{has the right}} under {{international}} norms to manufacture a naval reactor and produce highly enriched uranium to fuel it.

40|$|Although Bayesian Nets (BNs) are {{increasingly}} being used to solve real world risk problems, their use is still constrained by the difficulty of constructing the node probability tables (NPTs) for each node. In the absence of hard data, we must rely on domain experts to provide, often subjective, judgements to inform <b>the</b> <b>NPTs.</b> A key challenge is to construct relevant <b>NPTs</b> using <b>the</b> minimal amount of expert elicitation, recognising that it is rarely cost-effective to elicit complete sets of probability values. We describe a simple approach to defining NPTs for a large class of commonly occurring nodes (called ranked nodes). The approach {{is based on the}} doubly truncated Normal distribution with a central tendency that is invariably a type of weighted function of the parent nodes. In extensive real-world case studies we have found that this approach is sufficient for generating <b>the</b> <b>NPTs</b> of a very large class of nodes. The approach has been automated and is thus accessible to all types of domain experts, including those with little statistical expertise. The result has been that such individuals have been able to build large-scale realistic BN models that solve important problems. Hence, this work represents a breakthrough in BN research and technology since it can make the difference between being able to build realistic BN models and not...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: The University of Adelaide {{offers a}} six-year {{undergraduate}} medical degree {{with a focus}} on small group learning. Senior medical students had previously received limited formal training in education skills, and were identified as an underutilised teaching resource. AIMS: To devise a programme in which senior students are exposed to the various facets of university teaching responsibilities and to evaluate its impact on both the tutors and the students. METHODS: A six week rotation in medical education for final year medical students was designed and implemented in 2010 to involve them in the development, delivery and assessment of the 1 st and 2 nd year medical programme as near-peer tutors (NPTs). RESULTS: Two years after the rotation’s implementation, voluntary evaluation of both the junior students and NPTs was undertaken through a mixed methods approach of survey and focus group. Junior students (n¼ 358) revealed <b>the</b> <b>NPTs</b> provided nonthreatening learning environments, provided helpful feedback and acted as role models. Additionally, <b>the</b> <b>NPTs</b> (n¼ 24) reported they had consolidated prior knowledge, developed their teaching skills and expressed a desire to be more involved in teaching in the future. CONCLUSIONS: <b>The</b> implementation of <b>NPTs</b> in <b>the</b> teaching of junior medical students appears to benefit both students and their near-peer colleagues. Involvement of NPTs in all facets of medical education through this rotation stands to not only foster potential interest in an academic pathway but also equip them with a variety of transferable skills which they can draw on as future educators in their profession.

25|$|However, the {{legislative}} decree that formalized Brazilian’s adhesion to <b>the</b> <b>NPT</b> linked {{it to the}} understanding that Article VI of the Treaty – which stipulated negotiations in good faith to cease the nuclear arms race and achieve nuclear disarmament, and {{the outcome of a}} treaty on complete disarmament under strict and effective international controls - would be fulfilled. Even though Brazil decided to join the regime, it continued to criticize the slow pace of disarmament and demanded balance between the obligation of non-proliferation and the obligation of disarmament.|$|E
25|$|While Brazil was {{conducting}} its nuclear activities {{outside of the}} nuclear non-proliferation regime, many {{in the international community}} doubted its stated peaceful intention. In addition to Brazil’s refusal to sign <b>the</b> <b>NPT,</b> the fact that the country was ruled by a hard-line military regime fuelled the suspicion that Brasília was pursuing a nuclear bomb. This opinion was manifested openly and implicitly by different nations as well as the international anti-nuclear movement. The most vehement of skeptics was the U.S., with countries like France, Canada, the UK and the Soviet Union also following suit in their doubts of Brazil.|$|E
25|$|The deal caused lively {{international}} reactions. One of {{the main}} reasons for the frenzy was {{due to the fact that}} West Germany, an NPT signatory, made a commitment to transfer nuclear technology to Brazil, headed by a military dictatorship that was not party to <b>the</b> <b>NPT.</b> In the years that followed the announcement, Brazil and West Germany were under strong pressure coming from not just the U.S., but also the United Kingdom, Canada, France, and the Soviet Union—countries which supported a restrictive position on nuclear sales and strongly opposed the export of advanced nuclear technology such as fuel reprocessing plants.|$|E
