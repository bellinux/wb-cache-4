5|$|In an {{interview}} in 1993, Dalton said <b>that</b> <b>Michael</b> France was writing the screenplay, due {{to be completed in}} January or February 1994. Despite France's screenplay being completed by that January, in April 1994 Dalton officially resigned from the role.|$|E
5|$|Mahone {{begins to}} suffer from drug {{withdrawal}} and is informed by his state-appointed lawyer that his trial is almost a full year away. When Whistler realizes <b>that</b> <b>Michael</b> is not entirely on his side, he forms an alliance with Mahone. Mahone deduces <b>that</b> <b>Michael</b> is planning to break Whistler out of the prison, and Michael eventually agrees to let him join the escape. After he begins hallucinating about Haywire, Mahone accepts heroin from T-Bag to calm himself.|$|E

50|$|Michael's house makes a {{very brief}} {{appearance}} in Ghost Story, although he does not. The Archangel Uriel shows <b>that</b> <b>Michael's</b> house is surrounded by guardian angels, which resemble Secret Service agents.

5000|$|Meanwhile, the protagonist, a [...] "straight-talking" [...] Irish-American New York City {{homicide}} detective named Tommy O’Malley, {{is charged with}} solving the murders <b>that</b> <b>Michaels</b> has committed, while competing with Michaels for the heart of Ashley Van Buren, a blond, sexy aristocrat turned crime columnist. Some reviewers have said <b>that</b> <b>Michaels</b> and O'Malley are [...] "thinly veiled versions" [...] of O'Reilly.|$|R
50|$|A 2005 article {{published}} by the Seattle Times reported <b>that</b> <b>Michaels</b> had received more than $165,000 in fuel-industry funding, including money from the coal industry to publish his own climate journal.|$|R
5|$|The Perm {{authorities}} distributed a concocted {{cover story}} <b>that</b> <b>Michael</b> was abducted by unidentified men and had disappeared. Chelyshev and Borunov were arrested. Shortly before his own arrest, Colonel Peter Znamerovsky, a former Imperial army officer also exiled to Perm, managed to send Natalia a brief telegram saying <b>that</b> <b>Michael</b> had disappeared. Znamerovsky, Chelyshev and Borunov were all {{killed by the}} Perm Bolsheviks. Soviet disinformation about Michael's disappearance led to unfounded rumours that he had escaped and was leading a successful counter-revolution. In the ultimately forlorn hope <b>that</b> <b>Michael</b> would ally with Germany, the Germans arranged for Natalia and her daughter to escape to Kiev in German-controlled Ukraine. On {{the collapse of the}} Germans in November 1918, Natalia fled to the coast, and she and her daughter were evacuated by the British Royal Navy.|$|E
5|$|The {{circumstances}} {{around the}} death of Michael Shishman are unclear. According to the Byzantine emperor and historian John Kantakouzenos the emperor was mortally wounded in the battle and soon died while another Byzantine historian suggests <b>that</b> <b>Michael</b> Shishman lived for three more days not able to gain consciousness and died on the fourth day. The Serbian chronicles state that his horse fell during the battle and crashed his body. When his body was taken to Dečanski, he mourned him but pointed out that he preferred war to peace. The early 15th-century Bulgarian scholar and cleric Gregory Tsamblak says <b>that</b> <b>Michael</b> Shishman was captured and killed by {{the son of the}} Serbian king, Stephen Dušan. He was buried in the Church of St George in Staro Nagoričane.|$|E
5|$|The {{process of}} Michael's {{establishment}} in Epirus is obscure. The hagiography of St. Theodora of Arta, {{written in the}} late 13th century, maintains that Alexios III had appointed Michael as governor in the Peloponnese and a certain Senachereim, who was Michael's relative by marriage (they both had married first cousins from the Melissenos family), as governor of the Theme of Nicopolis in Epirus. When the local inhabitants rose in revolt against him, Senachereim called upon Michael for aid. Michael rushed to Nicopolis, but not before the locals had killed Senachereim. After <b>that,</b> <b>Michael,</b> himself widowed, took Senachereim's widow as his wife and succeeded him as governor. Although generally regarded as inaccurate due to the many errors it contains, {{this part of the}} hagiography is at least partially corroborated by Villehardouin's account that he married the daughter of a local magnate. It is certain <b>that</b> <b>Michael</b> was never appointed governor of the Peloponnese, but the hagiography's reference to the peninsula has led to suggestions by modern scholars that he is to be identified with the Michael who led the Peloponnesian Greeks in the Battle of the Olive Grove of Kountouras against the Crusaders, in the summer of 1205. This commonly held identification has been questioned by more recent research by the historian Raymond-Joseph Loenertz, who suggests <b>that</b> <b>Michael</b> leaving Epirus, which still was not securely under his control, to go on campaign in the Peloponnese would have been extremely unlikely as it would leave Epirus open to attack by Boniface. Loenertz does however consider <b>that</b> <b>Michael</b> may indeed have led another expedition into the Peloponnese a few years later, in 1207–09 (see below).|$|E
50|$|On September 4, 2012, it was {{announced}} <b>that</b> <b>Michaels</b> will return to The Biggest Loser in Season 14. Michaels also returned for Season 15, which premiered on October 15, 2013 on NBC.|$|R
50|$|In a Parliamentary written {{answer on}} 11 December 2012, Damian Green, Minister of State for Police and Criminal Justice, {{reported}} <b>that</b> <b>Michael's</b> salary as PCC for South Wales is £85,000 per annum.|$|R
2500|$|Speculation arose <b>that</b> <b>Michaels</b> {{would leave}} ABC for NBC, however he {{subsequently}} {{signed a deal}} to remain on Monday Night Football, when it moved to ESPN in 2006. However, in {{the weeks leading up}} to Super Bowl XL (ABC's final NFL broadcast to date), it was widely speculated <b>that</b> <b>Michaels</b> was attempting to get out of his contract with ESPN to join John Madden (who worked alongside Michaels for the previous four years on Monday Night Football as an analyst) at NBC. Michaels added fuel to the fire by refusing to state his future plans, and he could not [...] "respond to rumors... because that would become a distraction." [...] On February 8, 2006, ESPN announced that its Monday Night Football team would consist of Mike Tirico on play-by-play, with football anaylst Joe Theismann and Tony Kornheiser as analysts. ESPN explicitly stated <b>that</b> <b>Michaels</b> would not return to either Monday Night Football broadcasts or ABC's NBA broadcasts, all but assuring Michaels' departure from ABC after 30 years, and joining Madden at NBC.|$|R
5|$|A third theory, {{supported}} by both Serbian and Bulgarian researchers, is that despot Michael is an unknown son of Michael Asen IV, the first-born son of Bulgarian tsar Ivan Alexander (r. 1331–1371), who was proclaimed co-tsar {{shortly after his}} father's accession and died in a battle against the Ottomans before 1354–1355. Against this identification is the account of Nikephoros Gregoras, who mentions <b>that</b> <b>Michael</b> Asen's widow returned childless to Constantinople after his death. Another issue with this theory is that no source mentions Michael Asen as a despot.|$|E
5|$|After the FBI {{finds out}} that they believe Michael {{is going to try}} and break Sara out of prison they contact Mahone. Mahone is offered his old job back with the FBI if he agrees to give them {{credible}} information that leads to proof of Michael's plans. Mahone gives up the blind spot in the cameras <b>that</b> <b>Michael</b> had found, which the FBI fixes and then demands more information from Mahone. Mahone eventually decides not to turn his back on Michael but instead to use the connection to his advantage. Mahone informs the FBI <b>that</b> <b>Michael</b> is going to parachute into the prison, and when a dummy is parachuted into the prison Michael has enough of a distraction to break Sara out. Once Sara has escaped safely, Mahone gives her and Lincoln a tape from Michael that explained why he sacrificed himself for Sara.|$|E
5|$|An {{alternative}} {{theory to}} the corpse's identity was {{suggested in the}} history The Secrets of HMS Dasher (2004). This suggested that in March 1943 {{there was an explosion}} on , which sank, killing 379 men; one of these corpses was purportedly used. The military historian Denis Smyth dismisses the suggestion, and observes that the official records of the operation state <b>that</b> <b>Michael</b> was the body.|$|E
50|$|On April 3, 2013, it was {{announced}} <b>that</b> <b>Michaels</b> would be taking over as the executive producer for The Tonight Show. Consequently, The Tonight Show moved to New York in early 2014 as The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon.|$|R
5000|$|Besides his {{inconsistent}} work, Michaels (despite being initially seen as adding {{credibility to}} ABC's NBA broadcasts {{in contrast to}} his predecessor, Brad Nessler) was criticized for apparently lacking the kind of enthusiasm and confidence (for instance, Michaels initially reacted to Amar'e Stoudemire's block of Tim Duncan's shot during the 2005 playoffs by calling it a [...] "great, great contested shot") expected of a No. 1 play-by-play voice. Barry Horn of the Dallas Morning News said <b>that</b> <b>Michaels</b> was simply [...] "not a basketball guy". Meanwhile, Bill Simmons said during the 2005 Finals <b>that</b> <b>Michaels</b> [...] "shows up for these games, does his job, then drives home thinking, [...] "'Only five weeks to the NFL Hall of Fame Game, I'm almost there!'" ...|$|R
2500|$|Al Michaels {{was criticized}} by the New York Post for not {{broadcasting}} the game and seeming uninterested in the NBA in general. Barry Horn of The Dallas Morning News said <b>that</b> <b>Michaels</b> was simply [...] "not a basketball guy". Meanwhile, Bill Simmons said during the 2005 Finals <b>that</b> <b>Michaels</b> [...] "shows up for these games, does his job, then drives home thinking, ‘Only five weeks to the [...] Hall of Fame Game, I'm almost there!’" [...] Another criticism <b>that</b> <b>Michaels</b> received was <b>that</b> he too often found himself making tediously long-winded explanations. In return, he would tend to talk over two or three possessions in a row (which Michaels seemed to be better suited for football and baseball broadcasts, for which he's better known for). The end result {{was that he would}} hardly have time to comment on the action viewers were seeing because he was so hung up on a prior subplot or storyline that he felt the audience just had to know about. Michaels was also accused of apparently lacking the kind of enthusiasm and confidence (for instance, Michaels initially reacted to Amar'e Stoudemire's block of Tim Duncan's shot during the 2005 playoffs by calling it a [...] "great, great contested shot") expected of a main play-by-play voice.|$|R

5|$|It is {{estimated}} <b>that</b> <b>Michael</b> Jackson earned about $750 million in his lifetime. Sales of his recordings through Sony's music unit earned him an estimated $300 million in royalties. He {{may have also}} earned an additional $400 million from concerts, music publishing (including {{his share of the}} Beatles catalog), endorsements, merchandising and music videos. Estimating how much of these earnings Jackson was able to personally pocket is difficult because one has to account for taxes, recording costs and production costs.|$|E

5000|$|Nathan Rabin of The A.V. Club {{called the}} episode [...] "kick-ass" [...] and awarded it an [...] "A-". Rabin commended the fact <b>that</b> <b>Michael's</b> bad-idea-for-the-right-reason made him likable. Furthermore, he noted <b>that</b> both <b>Michael</b> {{and the kids}} engaged in [...] "mutually {{beneficial}} self-deception"; the former thought he could save those in need, and the latter had {{something to look forward}} to. Rabin also enjoyed the subplot involving Jim and Dwight, noting that it [...] "afforded Rainn Wilson an opportunity to do surprisingly accurate, unconscionably mean impersonations of Stanley and Toby".|$|R
5|$|On March 31, 2008, the United States Department of Defense {{confirmed}} <b>that</b> <b>Michael</b> Monsoor would posthumously {{receive the}} Medal of Honor from the President of the United States, George W.

5|$|The {{hopes of}} the monarchists <b>that</b> <b>Michael</b> {{might be able}} to assume the throne {{following}} the election of the Constituent Assembly were overtaken by events. His renunciation of the throne, though conditional, marked the end of the Tsarist regime in Russia. The Provisional Government had little effective power; real power was held by the Petrograd Soviet.|$|E

5|$|Two polls {{conducted}} {{shortly after}} Schiavo's feeding tube was removed {{for the final}} time in 2005 showed that {{a large majority of}} Americans believed <b>that</b> <b>Michael</b> Schiavo should have had the authority to make decisions on behalf of his wife, Terri, and that the United States Congress overstepped its bounds with its intervention in the case. However, other polls seemed to favor the Schindler family's position, and questions were raised about the wording of all the polls.|$|E
5|$|According to The Wall Street Journal {{and diverse}} news sites, the 750 million units sold by Michael Jackson is an {{inflated}} figure that was initially claimed by Raymone Bain (2006), {{who was the}} singer's publicist at that time, without any factual evidence and probably {{in an effort to}} promote album sales. From 2006 until present time, several sources such as RIAA, Rolling Stone, and Time have claimed <b>that</b> <b>Michael</b> Jackson has sold 750 million units (or even 1 billion), however, Adrian Strain, a representative from the International Federation of the Phonographic Industry (IFPI) has said that this figure is unreal.|$|E
