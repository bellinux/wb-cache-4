5|$|The {{velocity}} {{with which}} the university sped through its change into a major research institution was astounding.

5|$|A {{chemical}} tracer is 24-isopropylcholestane, {{which is a}} stable derivative of 24-isopropylcholesterol, which {{is said to be}} produced by demosponges but not by eumetazoans ("true animals", i.e. cnidarians and bilaterians). Since choanoflagellates are thought to be animals' closest single-celled relatives, a team of scientists examined the biochemistry and genes of one choanoflagellate species. They concluded that this species could not produce 24-isopropylcholesterol but <b>that</b> <b>investigation</b> of a wider range of choanoflagellates would be necessary in order to prove that the fossil 24-isopropylcholestane could only have been produced by demosponges.|$|E

5|$|During the trial, {{the defence}} {{argued that the}} {{proceedings}} were invalid as Knight had been granted immunity by the Attorney-General's Chambers in 1991 from further charges arising from his corruption investigations, in exchange for him to plead guilty in the earlier trial. They argued that the latest set of charges stemmed from <b>that</b> <b>investigation</b> and thus were subject to the immunity clause. The CPIB revealed {{that it had been}} tipped off about the misappropriation of money only in 1997 by an unnamed informant. The court ruled that the proceedings could continue because the 1991 probe into Knight's dealings did not investigate his misappropriation of money. Eventually the court found him guilty of two charges of misappropriation and sentenced him to a $10,000 fine and another day in jail.|$|E

25|$|The first {{effort to}} enact the law outside of Idaho was started in Oregon in 2003, when the Idaho law still only applied to stop signs. While it {{overwhelmingly}} passed in the House, it never {{made it out of}} the Senate Rules Committee. The Oregon effort in turn inspired an investigation of the law by the San Francisco Bay Area Metropolitan Transportation Commission in 2008. <b>That</b> <b>investigation</b> failed to spawn legislation, but it did garner national attention, which led to similar efforts nationwide.|$|E
25|$|She {{applied for}} the {{insurance}} money the day after her husband's funeral. Sorenson's relatives claimed that Gunness had poisoned her husband to collect on the insurance. Surviving records suggest that an inquest was ordered. It is unclear, however, whether <b>that</b> <b>investigation</b> actually occurred or Sorenson's body was ever exhumed to check for arsenic, as his relatives demanded. The insurance companies awarded her $8,500 (about $240,000 in 2012 dollars), with which she bought a farm {{on the outskirts of}} La Porte, Indiana.|$|E

25|$|Later in 1990, Rolling {{was arrested}} in Ocala on a {{burglary}} charge and, {{in the course of}} <b>that</b> <b>investigation,</b> his tools were matched to marks left at the Gainesville murder scenes. The small one-man camp where he was living was in a wooded area located near the apartment complexes frequented by students, including those of the victims. There, investigators discovered recordings Rolling had made of himself singing country songs that he had composed and audio diaries alluding to the crimes. He was charged with several counts of murder in November 1991.|$|E
25|$|On September 1, 2015, 32 {{years after}} the incident, Snuka {{was arrested and charged}} with third-degree murder and {{involuntary}} manslaughter for Argentino's death. It is the oldest case to result in charges in Lehigh County's history. On October 7, Snuka's lawyers agreed to forego a preliminary hearing, which the prosecution contended was a waste of court resources, given the thorough grand jury investigation. In return, they received transcripts and other evidence from <b>that</b> <b>investigation,</b> which defense attorney Robert J. Kirwan II said would be much more helpful in preparing Snuka's case than a hearing would have been.|$|E
25|$|The second miracle {{required}} for his canonization {{was reported to}} have occurred in January 2015. It was also reported <b>that</b> <b>investigation</b> into the alleged miracle was underway in northern Italy where the healing was said to have occurred. According to the vice-postulator Antonio Lanzoni, the canonization could have been approved in the near future, allowing for canonization sometime in the spring of 2016; this did not materialize because the investigations were still ongoing. It was further reported in January 2017 that Pope Francis was considering canonizing Paul VI either in that year, or in 2018 (marking 40 years since the late pope's death), without the second miracle {{required for}} sainthood.|$|E

50|$|The Committee to Protect Journalists {{had issued}} {{a special report}} in which it said that after the 2009 coup, journalists were {{increasingly}} vulnerable to attack and murder and <b>that</b> <b>investigations</b> were not carried out in a professional way, {{which has led to}} an increase in impunity in such cases.|$|R
25|$|At {{approximately}} 1:45p.m. on Saturday, April 12, 2014, {{a contract}} food service employee at the Kentucky State Penitentiary was seriously assaulted by Pennington. The employee, JoAnne Smith, was hospitalized in stable condition. At {{the time of}} the assault, Pennington was placed in segregation at the prison pending an investigation by the Kentucky Department of Corrections and the Kentucky State Police. As a result of <b>that</b> <b>investigation,</b> Pennington was indicted by a Lyon County grand jury with first degree assault, which is a Class B felony in Kentucky. Pennington was transferred to the Kentucky State Reformatory shortly after the assault and will also face internal Department of Corrections charges relating to the assault.|$|E
25|$|As part of <b>that</b> <b>investigation,</b> Transit {{considered}} {{whether it}} would have been worthwhile to toll new capacity to assist in funding its construction. This could have been in the form of tolling the new lanes along this route, which would have ensured an untolled alternative was available (as legally required), while the tolled new lanes would be far less congested. In mid 2007, Transit indicated that it would not seek a decision on funding the bridge via road tolls before starting work on construction. Auckland Airport had accused Transit of threatening to defer the project if it could not gain backing from the public and local Councils. As the bridge was to be finished for the 2011 Rugby World Cup, further delays would possibly have resulted in the bridge not being completed in time.|$|E
25|$|Einstein (1908) triedâ€“ as a {{preliminary}} {{in the framework}} of special relativityâ€“ also to include accelerated frames within the relativity principle. In the course of this attempt he recognized that for any single moment of acceleration of a body one can define an inertial reference frame in which the accelerated body is temporarily at rest. It follows that in accelerated frames defined in this way, the application of the constancy of the speed of light to define simultaneity is restricted to small localities. However, the equivalence principle that was used by Einstein in the course of <b>that</b> <b>investigation,</b> which expresses the equality of inertial and gravitational mass and the equivalence of accelerated frames and homogeneous gravitational fields, transcended the limits of special relativity and resulted in the formulation of general relativity.|$|E

50|$|Hughes told Radio New Zealand on 16 March <b>that</b> <b>investigations</b> {{indicated}} <b>that</b> finance for {{the coup}} had been provided from abroad, though details were still sketchy.

25|$|Similar to the {{submarines}} scandal, {{but much}} less talked about, Portas was {{also responsible for}} the acquisition of 260 Pandur armoured combat vehicles for 364 million euros when he was Minister of Defence. He signed the contract during his final days in office, and, like for the submarines, it included a vague counterparts provision for the manufacturer to spend 516 million euros on Portuguese merchandises and investments. However, at least 400 million euros of those counterparts expired unused and the few investments made allegedly benefited a personal friend of Portas. In addition, there were major mechanical problems with the first batches of Pandur vehicles delivered and a subsequent Minister of Defence cancelled {{the balance of the}} purchase. As in the submarines' scandal, Paulo Portas has not been shown to have committed any illegalities, but there were major suspicions and an official criminal investigation was launched in 2010 and in 2016 Portas was referenced (but not accused) in the context of <b>that</b> <b>investigation.</b>|$|E
500|$|The Jewish {{community}} of Rhodes appealed {{for help from}} the Jewish community in Constantinople, who forwarded the appeal to European governments. In the United Kingdom and Austria, Jewish communities gained support from their governments. [...] They sent official dispatches to the ambassadors in Constantinople unequivocally condemning the blood libel. [...] A consensus developed that the charge was false. [...] The governor of Rhodes sent {{the case to the}} central government, which initiated a formal inquiry into the affair. In July 1840, <b>that</b> <b>investigation</b> established the innocence of the Jewish community. Finally, in November of the same year, the Ottoman sultan issued a decree (firman) denouncing the blood libel as false.|$|E
500|$|Gray, {{considered}} by Darwin {{to be his}} friend and [...] "best advocate", also attempted to convince Darwin in his letters that design was inherent in all forms of life, and {{to return to his}} faith. Gray saw nature as filled with [...] "unmistakable and irresistible indications of design" [...] and argued that [...] "God himself is the very last, irreducible causal factor and, hence, the source of all evolutionary change." [...] Darwin agreed that his theories were [...] "not at all necessarily atheistical" [...] but was unable to share Gray's belief. [...] "I feel most deeply that the whole subject is too profound for the human intellect. A dog might as well speculate on the mind of Newton," [...] he wrote. Gray was a Christian, but he was a staunch supporter of Darwin in America. He collected together a number of his own writings to produce an influential book, Darwiniana (1876); these essays argued for a conciliation between Darwinian evolution and the tenets of theism, {{at a time when many}} on both sides perceived the two as mutually exclusive. Gray denied <b>that</b> <b>investigation</b> of physical causes stood opposed to the theological view and the study of the harmonies between mind and Nature, and thought it [...] "most presumable that an intellectual conception realized in Nature would be realized through natural agencies". The result of all this is that Gray distanced himself from Social Darwinism. Gray is a critical link in the history of American intellectualism, and his writings that explain how religion and science were not necessarily mutually exclusive have been considered his supreme accomplishment; thereby providing a way for believers in Creationism to consider Darwin's ideas.|$|E
