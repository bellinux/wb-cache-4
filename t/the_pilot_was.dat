5|$|HBO did {{not make}} a {{decision}} for four months after <b>the</b> <b>pilot</b> <b>was</b> delivered. In March 2010, HBO's decision to greenlight the series including <b>the</b> <b>pilot</b> <b>was</b> announced, with the production of the series scheduled to start June 2010. HBO however demanded extensive reshoot of the pilot, and wanted all the scenes from Morocco scrapped. A cameo appearance by George RR Martin as a Pentoshi nobleman at Daenerys's wedding filmed in Morocco was therefore also cut. In all 90 percent of <b>the</b> <b>pilot</b> <b>was</b> re-shot in 2010, with some cast changes and a different director.|$|E

5|$|Following its broadcast, <b>the</b> <b>pilot</b> <b>was</b> seen by {{over nine}} million viewers, easily winning its time slot, having nearly doubled viewership from ITV1 {{at the same}} time; the ratings went beyond the producers' expectations. However, critics gave varied {{responses}} towards the episode.|$|E

5000|$|Aircraft {{carriers}} and naval air stations typically use Fresnel lenses in their optical landing systems. The [...] "meatball" [...] light aids <b>the</b> <b>pilot</b> in maintaining proper glide slope for the landing. In the center are amber and red lights composed of Fresnel lenses. Although {{the lights are}} always on, {{the angle of the}} lens from <b>the</b> <b>pilot's</b> point of view determines the color and position of the visible light. If the lights appear above the green horizontal bar, <b>the</b> <b>pilot</b> <b>is</b> too high. If it <b>is</b> below, <b>the</b> <b>pilot</b> <b>is</b> too low, and if the lights <b>are</b> red, <b>the</b> <b>pilot</b> <b>is</b> very low.|$|R

5|$|In 1915 a Farman {{aeroplane}} crash-landed at Southcote Farm next to Southcote Junction. <b>The</b> <b>pilot</b> <b>was</b> able to {{jump from}} the plane before it crashed, and ran alongside it until it collided with a hedge near the railway embankment.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the free ad-support offerings, every episode of Friday Night Lights became available for download on the iTunes Store on February 10, 2007 for $1.99 per episode.

5|$|Lt. Phillips {{received}} {{permission from}} his superiors {{to fly the}} F-4B with an inoperative transponder. As the fighter proceeded to NAS Fallon in Nevada, the oxygen leak worsened until the system was disabled completely, and <b>the</b> <b>pilot</b> <b>was</b> instructed to fly at low altitude. The Phantom II departed NAS Fallon at 5:16p.m. following a flight plan routing across the Fresno, Bakersfield, and Los Angeles air corridors.|$|E

5000|$|In the {{execution}} of a contact approach, <b>the</b> <b>pilot</b> <b>is</b> responsible for obstruction clearance, but ATC will still provide separation from other IFR or Special VFR traffic.

5|$|Reception of {{the pilot}} varied {{according}} to the audience in question. <b>The</b> <b>pilot</b> <b>was</b> very well received by the mathematics community. Within {{a couple of weeks}} of Pegg's article for the MAA, Keith Devlin, another member of the association, gave the pilot a very favorable review.|$|E
5|$|Season one aired between March 24 and April 26, 2005. It {{originally}} debuted as a midseason {{replacement for}} Committed. It carried over general plot {{ideas from the}} earlier British series created by Stephen Merchant and Ricky Gervais, and particularly the threat of wholesale downsizing. However, only <b>the</b> <b>pilot</b> <b>was</b> a direct adaptation {{of one of the}} UK version's episodes.|$|E
5|$|The {{control systems}} {{also had some}} innovations. The control column was {{centrally}} placed and the pilot sat {{on the port side}} of the cockpit. The column had an extension arm fitted and had the ability to be swung over to the starboard side in case <b>the</b> <b>pilot</b> <b>was</b> incapacitated. The control instruments were located above the pilot's head in the ceiling, which allowed viewing and did not block the pilot's vision. The fuel instruments were electrical. The He 111 used the inner fuel tanks, closest to the wing root, first. The outer tanks acted as reserve tanks. <b>The</b> <b>pilot</b> <b>was</b> alerted to the fuel level when there was 100L (26US gal) left. A manual pump was available in case of electrical or power failure but the delivery rate of just 4½L (1.2US gal) per minute demanded that the pilot fly at the lowest possible speed and just below 3,048m (10,000ft). The He 111 handled well at low speeds.|$|E

5|$|The {{light alloy}} split flaps at the {{trailing}} {{edge of the}} wing were also pneumatically operated via a finger lever on the instrument panel. Only two positions were available; fully up or fully down (85°). The flaps were normally lowered only during the final approach and for landing, and <b>the</b> <b>pilot</b> <b>was</b> to retract them before taxiing.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>pilot</b> <b>was</b> {{delivered}} to Bravo during September 2002, and was well received in audience testing. Soon thereafter NBC purchased Bravo and ordered 12 episodes of the series. NBC promoted the show extensively, including billboard campaigns and print advertisements in national magazines.|$|E

5|$|The {{script for}} the episode went through 30 drafts, and four {{separate}} stories before the BBC were satisfied {{and ordered the}} series. Writing <b>the</b> <b>pilot</b> <b>was</b> completed before the September 11 terrorist attacks; after the attacks took place, the producers decided to add mention of the events into the episode in order to acknowledge {{the fact that the}} series is about fighting terrorism.|$|E
5|$|Tom McCarthy {{directed}} the original pilot, {{but much of}} this was later re-shot by Tim Van Patten as <b>the</b> <b>pilot</b> <b>was</b> reworked into the first episode of the complete season. Van Patten also {{directed the}} second episode. McCarthy is still credited as a consulting producer for the series' first episode. Brian Kirk and Daniel Minahan directed three episodes each, and Alan Taylor directed the final two.|$|E
5|$|A full {{series of}} six episodes (five new episodes, plus <b>the</b> <b>pilot)</b> <b>was</b> {{commissioned}} on 31 August 1977.

In addition, Brett had left the BBC, and the final five episodes in the first series were produced by Geoffrey Perkins.|$|E

50|$|In the UK, {{the person}} in command must hold a valid Private Pilot's Licence issued by the Civil Aviation Authority {{specifically}} for ballooning; {{this is known as}} the PPL(B). There are two types of commercial balloon licences: CPL(B) Restricted and CPL(B) (Full). The CPL(B) Restricted <b>is</b> required if <b>the</b> <b>pilot</b> <b>is</b> undertaking work for a sponsor or being paid by an external agent to operate a balloon. <b>The</b> <b>pilot</b> can fly a sponsored balloon with everything paid for with a PPL unless asked to attend any event. Then a CPL(B) Restricted is required. The CPL(B) <b>is</b> required if <b>the</b> <b>pilot</b> <b>is</b> flying passengers for money. The balloon then needs a transport category C of A (certificate of air worthiness). If <b>the</b> <b>pilot</b> <b>is</b> only flying sponsor's guests, and not charging money for flying other passengers, then <b>the</b> <b>pilot</b> <b>is</b> exempted from holding an AOC (air operator's certificate) though a copy of it is required. For passenger flying the balloon also requires a maintenance log.|$|R

Jones additionally sought inspiration from his hometown of Fargo, North Dakota, and the comics he drew featuring Thompson and his other friends. <b>The</b> <b>pilot</b> <b>was</b> released on the official website of Cartoon Network on May 16, 2014.|$|E
5|$|After <b>the</b> <b>pilot</b> <b>was</b> {{ordered in}} 1997, the show premiered on the premium cable network HBO in the United States on January 10, 1999, and ran its six seasons with 86episodes to June 10, 2007. The series then went through {{syndication}} {{and has been}} broadcast on A in the United States and internationally. The Sopranos was produced by HBO, Chase Films, and Brad Grey Television. It was primarily filmed at Silvercup Studios, New York City, and on location in New Jersey. The executive producers throughout the whole run were David Chase, Brad Grey, Robin Green, Mitchell Burgess, Ilene S. Landress, Terence Winter, and Matthew Weiner.|$|E
5|$|After <b>the</b> <b>pilot</b> <b>was</b> {{transmitted}} on 12 July 1991, the BBC {{were interested}} in a series. However, Moffat had signed on to write {{the third and fourth}} series of Press Gang as one twelve-episode block so it was not until 1992 that they produced the series. After being postponed from the autumn schedules, the first series was transmitted on Thursday evenings on BBC2 from 7 January until 11 February 1993.|$|E
