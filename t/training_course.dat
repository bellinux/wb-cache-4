40|$|Background: Malaria {{is still}} one of the most {{important}} infectious diseases in the world. The disease also is a public health problem in south and southeast of Iran. This study programmed to show the correlation between regular malaria microscopy training and refresher <b>training</b> <b>courses</b> and control of malaria in Iran. Methods: Three types of <b>training</b> <b>courses</b> were conducted in this programme including; five – day, ten – day and bimonthly <b>training</b> <b>courses.</b> Each of the <b>training</b> <b>courses</b> contained theoretical and prac­tical sections and training impact was evaluated by practical examination and multiple-choice quizzes through pre and post tests. Results: Distribution pattern of the participants in the training and refresher <b>training</b> <b>courses</b> showed that the most participants were from Sistan & Baluchistan and Hormozgan provinces where malaria is endemic and most cases of the infection come out from these malarious areas. A total of 695 identified individuals were participated in the <b>training</b> <b>courses.</b> A significant conversely correlation was found between conducting malaria microscopy <b>training</b> <b>courses</b> and annual malaria cases in Iran. Conclusion: Conducting a suitable programme for malaria microscopy training and refresher train­ing plays an important role in the control of malaria in endemic areas. Obviously, the decrease of mala­ria cases in Iran has been achieved due to some activities that malaria diagnosis training was one of them...|$|R
