A worker across the street said he saw a limousine speed past, accompanied by motorcycles with their sirens blaring; Grant knew immediately that they were headed to Parkland Memorial Hospital. Once at Parkland, Grant started snapping pictures of anything he could, including Vice President Johnson's car, and a man and a police officer delivering what Grant believed was blood plasma.|$|E
5|$|In 2013, Sélestat {{had a total}} {{population}} of 19,332, which makes it the eighth most populous town in Alsace. During the Middle Ages and the Renaissance {{it was the third}} largest city in the region, after Strasbourg and Colmar, and it is ranked the third commune in Alsace for cultural heritage. Sélestat was founded in the 8th century as a port on the Ill and it experienced a long period of prosperity thanks <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>trade</b> in wine and a thriving religious and cultural life. It gradually declined after the Reformation and the French conquest in the 17th century.

40|$|The {{value of}} {{specialist}} assistance <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>trading</b> of low-volume stocks {{has important implications}} in exchange design. We study {{the relation between the}} structure of individual specialist portfolios and the transitory volatility of low-volume stocks in these portfolios under the traditional NYSE auction-dealer market structure. We find that <b>the</b> <b>trading</b> quality for inactive stocks is positively related <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>trading</b> volume of active stocks in the same specialist portfolios. These results are consistent with specialist subsidization of low-volume stocks in their portfolios and suggest that specialists provide important support <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>trading</b> of inactive stocks if they have the resources.

5|$|In the 17th century, Banagher was {{the centre}} of a flourishing woollen trade. In 1699, the impost placed on the export of woollen goods to England {{practically}} killed the woollen trade. At {{the outbreak of the}} American Revolutionary War in 1775, an embargo placed on the export of foodstuffs to the American Colonies dealt another blow <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>trade</b> of Banagher. In 1780, the British Parliament withdrew all these restrictions and Banagher's economy began to improve rapidly.|$|E
5|$|In this period, one of {{the major}} {{incentives}} for the growth of Transylvanian towns was the trade with Wallachia and Moldavia.

Thereafter, foreign merchants had to sell their most sought-after merchandise, broadcloth to the tradesmen of Braşov who resold it in Wallachia in exchange for animals, cotton, wax and honey.|$|E

5|$|The Capitulation of Saldanha Bay saw the {{surrender}} to the British Royal Navy of a Dutch expeditionary force sent to recapture the Dutch Cape Colony in 1796 during the French Revolutionary Wars. In 1794 {{the army of the}} French Republic overran the Dutch Republic which then became a French client state, the Batavian Republic. Concerned by the threat posed <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>trade</b> routes between Great Britain and British India by the Dutch Cape Colony in Southern Africa, a British expeditionary force had landed at Simon's Town in June 1795 and forced {{the surrender}} of the colony in a short campaign. The British commander, Vice-Admiral Sir George Elphinstone, then reinforced the garrison and stationed a naval squadron at the Cape to protect the British conquest.|$|E
5|$|The New Harbour {{was later}} renamed as Keppel Harbour in 1900 after Admiral Sir Henry Keppel of HMS Meander, {{who carried out}} an on-site survey to build an {{anchorage}} in the harbour in the 1880s.

5|$|Books were expensive, {{since each}} copy {{had to be}} written out {{individually}} on a roll of papyrus (volumen) by scribes who had apprenticed <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>trade.</b> The codex—a book with pages bound to a spine—was still a novelty {{in the time of}} the poet Martial (1st century AD), {{but by the end of}} the 3rd century was replacing the volumen and was the regular form for books with Christian content. Commercial production of books had been established by the late Republic, and by the 1st century AD certain neighbourhoods of Rome were known for their bookshops (tabernae librariae), which were found also in Western provincial cities such as Lugdunum (present-day Lyon, France). The quality of editing varied wildly, and some ancient authors complain about error-ridden copies, as well as plagiarism or forgery, since there was no copyright law. A skilled slave copyist (servus litteratus) could be valued as highly as 100,000 sesterces.|$|E

She also sporadically competed in singles matches, losing to both Kelly Kelly and Melina. Hall then took a brief hiatus and made her return on August 3, teaming with Phoenix to defeat Mickie James and Gail Kim. Hall unsuccessfully competed at WrestleMania XXV in a 25-wrestler Battle Royal to determine the first Miss WrestleMania after being eliminated by Gail Kim. On the October 12 episode of Raw, Hall defeated Mickie James to win the Divas Championship, her first championship in WWE, but lost it to Melina immediately afterwards after Melina {{was traded to the}} Raw brand thanks <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>trade</b> by Nancy O'Dell.

5|$|In November 1917, Lenin {{issued the}} Decree on Workers' Control, which {{called on the}} workers of each {{enterprise}} to establish an elected committee to monitor their enterprise's management. That month they also issued an order requisitioning the country's gold, and nationalised the banks, which Lenin saw as a major step toward socialism. In December, Sovnarkom established a Supreme Council of the National Economy (VSNKh), which had authority over industry, banking, agriculture, and trade. The factory committees were subordinate <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>trade</b> unions, which were subordinate to VSNKh; thus, the state's centralised economic plan was prioritised over the workers' local economic interests. In early 1918, Sovnarkom cancelled all foreign debts and refused to pay interest owed on them. In April 1918, it nationalised foreign trade, establishing a state monopoly on imports and exports. In June 1918, it decreed nationalisation of public utilities, railways, engineering, textiles, metallurgy, and mining, although often these were state-owned in name only. Full-scale nationalisation {{did not take place}} until November 1920, when small-scale industrial enterprises were brought under state control.|$|E
5|$|Most of the burghs were on {{the east}} coast, and among them were the largest and wealthiest, {{including}} Aberdeen, Perth and Edinburgh, whose growth was facilitated by trade with the continent. Although in the southwest Glasgow was beginning to develop and Ayr and Kirkcudbright had occasional links with Spain and France, sea trade with Ireland was much less profitable. In addition to the major royal burghs this era saw the proliferation of lesser baronial and ecclesiastical burghs, with 51 being created between 1450 and 1516. Most of these were much smaller than their royal counterparts; excluded from international trade, they mainly acted as local markets and centres of craftsmanship. In general burghs probably carried out far more local trading with their hinterlands, relying on them for food and raw materials. The wool trade was a major export {{at the beginning of}} the period, but the introduction of sheep-scab was a serious blow <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>trade</b> and it began to decline as an export from the early 15th century and despite a levelling off, there was another drop in exports as the markets collapsed in the early-16th century Low Countries. Unlike in England, this did not prompt the Scots to turn to large scale cloth production and only poor quality rough cloths seem to have been significant.|$|E

5|$|Murray {{started with}} the trading of Mike Fisher to the Nashville Predators in {{exchange}} for a first-round pick in the 2011 draft. Fisher already had a home in Nashville with new wife Carrie Underwood. The trading of Fisher, a fan favorite in Ottawa, lead to a small anti-Underwood backlash in the city with the banning of her songs from the play lists of some local radio stations. Murray next traded Chris Kelly, another veteran, to the Boston Bruins for a second-round pick in the 2011 draft. A few days later, pending unrestricted free agent Jarkko Ruutu was sent to the Anaheim Ducks {{in exchange for a}} sixth-round pick in 2011. A swap of goaltenders was made with the Colorado Avalanche which brought Craig Anderson to Ottawa in exchange for Brian Elliott. Both goalies were having sub-par seasons prior <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>trade.</b> Under-achieving forward Alex Kovalev was traded to the Pittsburgh Penguins for a seventh-round draft pick. On trade deadline day, Ottawa picked up goaltender Curtis McElhinney on waivers, and traded Chris Campoli with a seventh-round pick to the Chicago Blackhawks for a second-round pick and Ryan Potulny. Goaltender Anderson played very well down the stretch for Ottawa, and the team quickly signed the soon-to-be unrestricted free agent to a four-year contract. After media speculation on the future of Murray within the organization, Murray was re-signed as general manager on April 8, to a three-year extension. On April 9, Head Coach Cory Clouston and assistants Greg Carvel and Brad Lauer were dismissed from their positions. Murray said that the decision was made {{based on the fact that}} the team entered the season believing it was a contender, but finished with a 32–40–10 record.
