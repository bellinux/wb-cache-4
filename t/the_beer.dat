5|$|Fermentation is {{sometimes}} {{carried out in}} two stages, primary and secondary. Once most of the alcohol has been produced during primary fermentation, <b>the</b> <b>beer</b> is transferred to a new vessel and allowed a period of secondary fermentation. Secondary fermentation is used when <b>the</b> <b>beer</b> requires long storage before packaging or greater clarity. When <b>the</b> <b>beer</b> has fermented, it is packaged either into casks for cask ale or kegs, aluminium cans, or bottles for other sorts of beer.|$|E
5|$|The Irish {{version of}} FES is brewed with pale malt, 25 per cent flaked barley (for head {{retention}} and body) and 10 per cent roasted barley, {{the latter being}} what gives <b>the</b> <b>beer</b> its dark hue. It uses the bitter Galena, Nugget and Target hop varieties which have undergone an isomerized kettle extract process. There are about a third more hops than in Guinness Draught and <b>the</b> <b>beer</b> has 47 Bitterness Units. <b>The</b> <b>beer</b> is force carbonated.|$|E
5|$|After {{successful}} test marketing from 1974, John Smith's Bitter {{was distributed}} in the South of England from 1979 onwards, accompanied by an extensive marketing budget. As research by Courage indicated that Southern drinkers considered Yorkshire bitter to be superior, <b>the</b> <b>beer</b> was sold there under the name John Smith's Yorkshire Bitter. Sales of <b>the</b> <b>beer</b> doubled in 1981 owing {{to the increase in}} free trade outlets in the South stocking <b>the</b> <b>beer.</b> By 1982 it was the highest selling Courage brand and the highest selling canned bitter in the United Kingdom.|$|E

5|$|From 1979, keg Stones {{began to}} be {{promoted}} heavily nationwide, and <b>the</b> <b>beer</b> {{was introduced to the}} South of England for the first time. <b>The</b> <b>beer</b> was promoted following the withdrawal of the unpopular Brew Ten, which was itself intended to replace Bass's regional ales. Originally <b>the</b> <b>beer</b> would be produced at the Cannon Brewery and then transported to Bass' Hope & Anchor brewery, also in Sheffield, for pasteurisation and kegging, but eventually demand for Stones Bitter became too great for the Cannon alone, and production was also extended to other Bass breweries. In the early 1980s, it was produced at Bass' Runcorn brewery, although this was quickly halted after drinkers complained of headaches from the poorly manufactured beer. The Runcorn beer had been brewed at a higher temperature, which increased the amount of hangover-inducing fusel oils in <b>the</b> <b>beer.</b>|$|E

5|$|Nearby Sierra Nevada Brewing Company {{partnered with}} the monks of New Clairvaux {{to make a}} series of Belgian-style beers under the Ovila Abbey brand. In late 2010, <b>the</b> <b>beer</b> {{producer}} launched a website to tell about the making of <b>the</b> <b>beer</b> product line {{and the story of}} the restoration of the stones. Sierra Nevada founder Ken Grossman said he had long been interested in making a line of Belgian beers, and the abbey's project provided a good opportunity. The first product, a Dubbel, was released in March 2011, followed in July by a Saison and in November by a Quadrupel. Sierra Nevada has dedicated a percentage of <b>the</b> <b>beer</b> sales to assist in funding the rebuilding project.|$|E

5|$|Originally {{a bottle}} {{conditioned}} beer, FES has been pasteurised to ensure quality consistency since 1948. Since 1950, {{in an attempt}} to recreate the flavour profile of bottle conditioned FES, <b>the</b> <b>beer</b> has been produced by blending fresh FES with 2 per cent FES that has been aged for up to 100 days, which has developed a high lactic acid content. Finally, <b>the</b> <b>beer</b> is allowed to mature in the bottle for 28 days before being sent out for distribution.|$|E
5|$|Some brewers add {{one or more}} {{clarifying}} {{agents to}} beer, which typically precipitate (collect as a solid) out of <b>the</b> <b>beer</b> along with protein solids and are found only in trace amounts in the finished product.

5|$|The first {{recorded}} shipment of <b>the</b> <b>beer</b> to the United States was in 1817.

5|$|A beer {{tower is}} a beer {{dispensing}} device, usually found in bars and pubs, {{that consists of}} a cylinder attached to a beer cooling device at the bottom. Beer is dispensed from <b>the</b> <b>beer</b> tower into a drinking vessel.|$|E
5|$|After boiling, the {{hopped wort}} is now cooled, {{ready for the}} yeast. In some breweries, the hopped wort may pass through a hopback, which is a small vat filled with hops, to add {{aromatic}} hop flavouring and {{to act as a}} filter; but usually the hopped wort is simply cooled for the fermenter, where the yeast is added. During fermentation, the wort becomes beer in a process which requires a week to months {{depending on the type of}} yeast and strength of <b>the</b> <b>beer.</b> In addition to producing ethanol, fine particulate matter suspended in the wort settles during fermentation. Once fermentation is complete, the yeast also settles, leaving <b>the</b> <b>beer</b> clear.|$|E
50|$|All of <b>the</b> <b>beers</b> Allagash {{produces}} are bottle conditioned.

5|$|FES is {{the oldest}} variant of Guinness that is still available, {{although}} its ingredients and production methods have varied over time. In 1824, it had an original gravity (OG) of 1082. After a peak in strength in 1840, when <b>the</b> <b>beer</b> had an OG of 1098, by 1860, <b>the</b> <b>beer</b> was reduced to its current standard strength of around 1075 OG. FES was originally brewed with pale and brown malts. Black malt was used from 1819, and by 1828 its use had entirely replaced brown malt. In 1883, <b>the</b> <b>beer</b> was produced with 85 per cent pale malt, 10 per cent amber malt and 5 per cent roasted malt. From 1929 – 1930 onwards, Guinness switched from using roasted malt in the beer's production to roasted barley. Amber malt continued {{to be added to}} the grist until 1940. Flaked barley was introduced in the early 1950s, and the hopping rate was decreased.|$|E
5|$|FES {{was sold}} and then {{withdrawn}} in the UK in 1976 as Guinness XXX Extra Strong Stout; it returned in 1990 when interest in craft beer increased. <b>The</b> <b>beer</b> was again {{withdrawn from the}} UK market, returning in 2003 to cater for the increasing African diaspora. The British market is supplied with both the Irish and the Nigerian brewed variants of <b>the</b> <b>beer,</b> the latter of which has annual sales of £2 million. Official imports of FES into the US were resumed in 2010, following a resurgent interest in craft beer; this was {{after a period of}} grey imports, predominantly for African and Caribbean expatriates.|$|E
5|$|In 1801, Guinness West India Porter, {{the direct}} {{predecessor}} of Foreign Extra Stout, was first exported from the St. James's Gate brewery in Dublin. The product was formulated for Irish immigrant {{workers in the}} Caribbean. <b>The</b> <b>beer</b> was only brewed between October and April, which reduced acidification, and was matured in large wooden vats {{for up to two}} years, which gave the finished product greater stability. To survive the long journey overseas, which was then taken by ship, it was brewed with extra hops and a higher alcohol content, which acted as natural preservatives for <b>the</b> <b>beer.</b> Exported in barrels, the product was then bottled locally, which helped to reduce costs.|$|E
