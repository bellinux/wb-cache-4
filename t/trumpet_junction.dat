25|$|At Junction 8 a spur off the M40 with two-lane carriageways {{leaves the}} {{mainline}} of the motorway and continues {{for a few}} miles before ending (motorway restrictions ending) at a <b>trumpet</b> <b>junction</b> for Wheatley and the A418(A40) (the old junction 8), with the road continuing as a two lane dual carriageway as the A40 towards Oxford and farther on to Cheltenham and Wales. The spur can be accessed only via the M40 northbound, and traffic heading towards the M40 can join only the southbound carriageway. Traffic going {{in the other direction}} has to use the <b>trumpet</b> <b>junction,</b> and follow the A418 past Wheatley services. This short spur {{is the end of the}} original M40, prior to the building of the current Junction 8 and extension to Birmingham.|$|E
2500|$|The first [...] of the M5 {{motorway}} {{to be built}} {{were constructed}} as a dual two-lane motorway (two lanes in each direction), with Worcestershire County Council acting as engineer. [...] This section, from Junction 4 (Lydiate Ash) in the north to a <b>trumpet</b> <b>junction</b> with the M50 in the south, opened in July 1962. The southern end was called a <b>trumpet</b> <b>junction</b> because of its shape: a 270 degree curved bend. There were no other exits from this <b>trumpet</b> <b>junction</b> though room was left for an extension to the south.|$|E

5000|$|Various {{forms of}} parclo {{interchanges}} are {{used on the}} North Luzon Expressway in the Philippines. The configuration of parclo interchanges (particularly those of the [...] "folded diamond" [...] type) allows for the consolidation of toll barriers at points where onramps and offramps run alongside each other. A single large barrier can serve each onramp/offramp pair simultaneously, reducing construction and operation expenses at through junctions. When possible, such as at terminal <b>junctions,</b> <b>trumpet</b> interchanges are preferred since they only require one large toll barrier for all four on/off-ramps.|$|R
