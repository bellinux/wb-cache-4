5|$|In his history, Harry Altham {{wrote that}} the 1884 Australians have been equated with the 1882 team but he himself {{disagreed}} with that assessment. He added <b>that</b> <b>George</b> Giffen considered England's team in the final Test {{to have been the}} strongest of the nineteenth century.|$|E
2500|$|Franklin D. Roosevelt praised George as [...] "one of {{the really}} great thinkers {{produced}} by our country" [...] and bemoaned the fact <b>that</b> <b>George's</b> writings were not better known and understood. Yet even several decades earlier, William Jennings Bryan wrote <b>that</b> <b>George's</b> genius had reached the global reading public and that he [...] "was {{one of the foremost}} thinkers of the world." ...|$|R
2500|$|In 1997, Spencer MacCallum wrote <b>that</b> Henry <b>George</b> was [...] "Undeniably the {{greatest}} writer and orator on free trade who ever lived."

5|$|After Grant {{retired from}} the screen, he became more active in business. He {{accepted}} {{a position on the}} board of directors at Fabergé. This position was not honorary, as some had assumed; Grant regularly attended meetings and travelled internationally to support them. His pay was modest in comparison to the millions of his film career, a salary of a reported $15,000 a year. Such was Grant's influence on the company <b>that</b> <b>George</b> Barrie once claimed that Grant had played a role in the growth of the firm to annual revenues of about $50 million in 1968, a growth of nearly 80% since the inaugural year in 1964. The position also permitted use of a private plane, which Grant could use to fly to see his daughter wherever her mother, Dyan Cannon, was working.|$|E
5|$|Although the inflorescences of Banksia aquilonia {{are similar}} to B.integrifolia, the leaves are marked in their differences—the midrib on the leaves' undersides is distinctively covered in short reddish-brown hairs and the leaves are spirally {{arranged}} on the branches rather than in whorls as in all B.integrifolia subspecies. It was these differences <b>that</b> <b>George</b> felt were distinctive enough {{for it to be}} separate it as a full species from B. integrifolia. The overall habit of a Banksia aquilonia tree resembles that of B.integrifolia, though is generally smaller. The southernmost populations of B.aquilonia are separated from the northernmost B.integrifolia occurrence by , hence location is helpful in identification.|$|E
5|$|As Jerry is {{sleeping}} on the plane he dreams of returning to his apartment only to find several FBI agents there interrogating Kramer, who apparently has ratted out Jerry. When Jerry protests that {{he had nothing to}} do with it, they reveal that the Russian was an undercover FBI agent. Jerry tries to flee only to be gunned down by the agents. This jolts him awake. He finds his show is canceled due to bad weather, and George picks up Jerry at the airport. Jerry is initially amazed <b>that</b> <b>George</b> is perfectly willing, even anxious to drive Jerry home. When he informs George they cannot go back to his apartment because of the baby shower, George insists and Jerry discovers <b>that</b> <b>George</b> is wearing the red shirt and is just using the favor as a chance to encounter Leslie at the baby shower. Meanwhile, Kramer and the two Russians crash the shower to install cable television, start to eat all the food and get into a heated argument. When George and Jerry arrive, George's plan proves unsuccessful, as he cannot muster the courage confront Leslie and instead awkwardly tries to curry her favor. He is interrupted when one of the other party guests (Margaret Reed as Mary) suddenly confronts Jerry because he never called her back after a date. This unpleasant scene is the final straw and the guests leave hurriedly. On the way out of the bathroom the angry woman bumps Leslie and her dessert into George, adding a chocolate cake stain to the Bosco stain already on the shirt. Jerry changes his mind about the cable hook-up, but is still charged with a large amount of money. When he refuses to pay, the Russians break the picture tube of his television set.|$|E

60|$|It was {{a relief}} to Dr. May <b>that</b> <b>George's</b> vigil soon became a sound repose on the sofa in the dressing-room; and he was left to read and muse uninterruptedly.|$|R
5|$|Bertie's and Lionel's {{relationship}} {{comes to}} be known to the King's advisors when there are preparations for his coronation in Westminster Abbey. It comes to light <b>that</b> <b>George</b> never asked for advice from his advisors about his speech defect treatment and that Lionel never had formal training to be a medical doctor. Lionel explained {{that at the time}} he started with speech defects there was no formal training and that the only known help that was available for returning Great War shell-shocked Australian soldiers was from personal experience.|$|E
5|$|By September 1943, Neddermeyer's {{team had}} grown from five people to fifty. That month, John von Neumann came to Los Alamos at Oppenheimer's request. Von Neumann was {{impressed}} by the implosion concept and, working with Edward Teller, an old friend, made a series of suggestions. Von Neumann was able to create a sound mathematical model of implosion, enabling Neddermeyer to present a proposal for a greatly expanded research program. Edwin McMillan and Isidor Isaac Rabi recommended <b>that</b> <b>George</b> Kistiakowsky, who had a specialized knowledge in the precision use of explosives, be brought in to help the program. In February 1944, Kistiakowsky became Parsons' deputy for implosion.|$|E
5|$|George I died on 11/22 June 1727 {{during one}} of his visits to Hanover, and George II succeeded him as king and elector at the age of 43. The new king decided not to travel to Germany for his father's funeral, which far from {{bringing}} criticism led to praise from the English who considered it proof of his fondness for England. He suppressed his father's will because it attempted to split the Hanoverian succession between George II's future grandsons rather than vest all the domains (both in Britain and Hanover) in a single person. Both British and Hanoverian ministers considered the will unlawful, as George I did not have the legal power to determine the succession personally. Critics supposed <b>that</b> <b>George</b> II hid the will to avoid paying out his father's legacies.|$|E
50|$|One of Orwell's biographers, Jeffrey Meyers, {{suggested}} in his Orwell: Wintry Conscience of a Generation (2000), <b>that</b> <b>Georges</b> Kopp was Orwell's main inspiration when {{he created the}} character of O'Brien in 1984.|$|R

50|$|Noting {{similarities}} between George's novel Children of the Morning (1926) and William Golding's celebrated Lord of the Flies (1954), Auberon Waugh suggested <b>that</b> <b>George's</b> work may have subliminally influenced Golding, although the latter denied having read it.|$|R
5|$|George Sr. is not, in fact, gone. After faking {{his death}} in Mexico by paying off the cops, George Sr. returns to the family model home, where George Michael discovers him and hides him in the attic. To protect his son from legal implications, Michael hides George Sr. in Gob's prop Aztec Tomb, orchestrates a diversion, and tells the family <b>that</b> <b>George</b> Sr. has escaped once more. Throughout {{the rest of the}} season, Michael sneaks George Sr. provisions, and George Sr. keeps tabs on the Bluth family through the {{ventilation}} system. George Sr. also faces onslaught from the outside world; the press begins looking for him in Iraq, fumigators surround the house while he's still in the attic, and Kitty returns to steal a sample of his semen to make her own Bluth baby.|$|E
5|$|George {{does not}} arrive for {{work the next}} day. Joanne shows in a new volunteer, Glen, who is {{replacing}} Liz. Having found out <b>that</b> <b>George</b> has made similar calls to CSL for years, Andy {{plans to go to}} the police. Andy answers the phone, and it is George. In Chloe's voice, George says that he just wanted someone to listen to him, then warns that he has told the dead woman's son where Andy works. In the background, Glen stands, and points a gun at Andy's head. He calls Andy's name, and Andy turns around to see Glen right before the credits play.|$|E
5|$|George was {{succeeded by}} his son, George Augustus, {{who took the}} throne as George II. It was widely assumed, even by Walpole for a time, <b>that</b> <b>George</b> II planned to remove Walpole from office but was {{prevented}} from doing so by his queen, Caroline of Ansbach. However, Walpole commanded a substantial majority in Parliament and George II {{had little choice but}} to retain him or risk ministerial instability. In subsequent reigns the power of the prime minister increased further at the expense of the power of the sovereign.|$|E
50|$|It {{was here}} in Russia <b>that</b> <b>Georges</b> Boulanger met a young girl from Estonia named Ellionorr Paulson. She was an {{intellectual}} student of law and medicine. They eventually got married and had two daughters, Nora and Georgette.|$|R
5000|$|It {{was during}} this time <b>that</b> <b>George's</b> father Hubert died. George {{would go on to}} pen the lyrics for [...] "Between The Heavens and the Deep Blue Sea" [...] and the album was {{dedicate}} to Hubert van der Spuy.|$|R
60|$|He {{left her}} to make what she liked of this, and he {{imagined}} {{that there was something}} to be inferred from it. He thought it might be wise to give her a hint <b>that</b> <b>George's</b> affections were already engaged.|$|R
5|$|Hancock was {{put forth}} as a {{candidate}} in the 1789 U. S. presidential election. As was the custom in an era where political ambition was viewed with suspicion, Hancock did not campaign or even publicly express interest in the office; he instead made his wishes known indirectly. Like everyone else, Hancock knew <b>that</b> <b>George</b> Washington {{was going to be}} elected as the first president, but Hancock may have been interested in being vice president, despite his poor health. Hancock received only four electoral votes in the election, however, none of them from his home state; the Massachusetts electors all voted for another Massachusetts native, John Adams, who received the second-highest number of electoral votes and thus became vice president. Although Hancock was disappointed with his performance in the election, he continued to be popular in Massachusetts.|$|E
5|$|In {{the same}} interview, Earp claimed <b>that</b> <b>George</b> Hoyt had {{intended}} to kill him, although newspaper accounts from that time report differently. He also said he and Bat Masterson had confronted Clay Allison when {{he was sent to}} Dodge City to finish George Hoyt's job, and that they had forced him to back down. Two other accounts contradicted Earp, crediting cattleman Dick McNulty and Long Branch Saloon owner Chalk Beeson with convincing Allison and his cowboys to surrender their guns. Cowboy Charlie Siringo witnessed the incident and left a written account.|$|E
5|$|It {{was widely}} {{believed}} <b>that</b> <b>George</b> would dismiss Walpole, who had distressed him by joining his father's government, and replace him with Sir Spencer Compton. George asked Compton, rather than Walpole, {{to write his}} first speech as king for him, but Compton asked Walpole to draft it. Caroline advised George to retain Walpole, who continued to gain royal favour by securing a generous civil list (a fixed annual amount set by Parliament for the king's official expenditure) of £800,000. Walpole commanded a substantial majority in Parliament and George {{had little choice but}} to retain him or risk ministerial instability. Compton was ennobled as Lord Wilmington the following year.|$|E
60|$|Bob {{told them}} briefly of the hiding-place he had found, {{and then the}} work of loading the wagons was begun, Ralph noting with a slight feeling of resentment, <b>that</b> <b>George's</b> team was to be loaded {{as well as the}} others.|$|R
5000|$|According to Oscar B. Johannsen, [...] "Since {{the very}} {{basis of the}} Austrian concept of value is subjective, it is {{apparent}} <b>that</b> <b>George's</b> understanding of value paralleled theirs. However, he either did not understand or did not appreciate the importance of marginal utility." ...|$|R
5000|$|It is {{said that}} Aurel Babeş was very aware of the great {{international}} reputation <b>that</b> <b>Georges</b> Papanikolaou had gained in contrast to his own. In a spirit of recognition and fairness, Romania refers to cervical testing as [...] "Methode Babeș-Papanicolaou" [...] in honor of Babeș.|$|R
5|$|Jerry {{inherits}} {{some old}} possessions {{of his grandfather}} Irving. Among them is a statue that looks just like one George's family had, until George broke it. Jerry promises <b>that</b> <b>George</b> can have it, but leaves it in his apartment for a few days. Kramer takes a few of Irving's old clothes, including a hat which he believes makes him look like Joe Friday of Dragnet. Elaine persuades Jerry to have his apartment cleaned by her client Rava's (Nurit Koppel) boyfriend Ray (Michael D. Conway). Jerry is very impressed {{by the quality of}} the cleaning; but when he and Elaine visit Rava, Jerry notices a statue with a vivid similarity to the one he inherited, and believes Ray stole it. He calls Kramer to check his apartment, and when Kramer cannot find the statue there, Jerry’s suspicion is confirmed.|$|E
5|$|Martin Filler {{acknowledged}} that the film legitimately used artistic licence to make valid dramatic points, {{such as in the}} probably imagined scene when George V lectures his son on the importance of broadcasting. Filler cautions <b>that</b> <b>George</b> VI would never have tolerated Logue addressing him casually, nor swearing, and the King almost certainly would have understood a newsreel of Hitler speaking in German. Filler makes the larger point that both the King and his wife were, in reality, lukewarm towards Churchill because of the latter's support for his brother during the abdication crisis. They only warmed to Churchill later in the war, because of his performance as a wartime leader.|$|E
5|$|President Bush's legacy {{continues}} to develop today. Supporters credit Bush's counterterrorism policies with preventing another major terrorist attack from {{occurring in the}} US after 9/11 and also praise individual policies such as the Medicare prescription drug benefit and the AIDS relief program known as PEPFAR. Critics often point to {{his handling of the}} Iraq War, specifically the failure to find weapons of mass destruction, that were the main rationale behind the initial invasion—as well as his handling of tax policy, Hurricane Katrina, climate change and the 2008 financial crisis—as proof <b>that</b> <b>George</b> W. Bush was unfit to be president.|$|E
50|$|Georges {{began running}} {{television}} ads for his campaign {{the last week}} in July. Georges candidacy has {{attracted the attention of}} the Greek press in the United States. The Baton Rouge Morning Advocate reported <b>that</b> <b>Georges</b> would tout himself as a political outsider and newcomer to state politics.|$|R
50|$|Then Sibilot {{enters the}} room, while Georges {{is talking to}} himself in the mirror. The {{dialogue}} between the two might imply <b>that</b> <b>Georges</b> started to forget his real identity to become Nekrassov. After some deep talk and some round of practice, Sibilot also acts as Georges is Nikita Nekrassov.|$|R
50|$|When George’s parents {{married in}} 1505, {{his father had}} settled all his {{property}} at Raunds, Little Harrowden and Wellingborough on himself and his bride; then to the heirs of their body and in default of such heirs to the right heirs of Henry. It seems likely <b>that</b> <b>George’s</b> mother (who was evidently still living in 1548 when she was mentioned when Henry mentioned her in his will) had died by 1553, as in <b>that</b> year <b>George</b> and his wife Cecily conveyed the manor of Little Harrowden to Anthony Shuckborough, apparently without Margaret being involved.|$|R
