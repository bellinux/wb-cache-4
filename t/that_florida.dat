5|$|Several critics noted <b>that</b> <b>Florida</b> sounded {{too eager}} to coin terms {{and that some of}} the pop {{cultural}} references and anecdotes were awkward. Environmental psychologist Michael Dudley pointed out copy-editing errors such as misspellings, and complained <b>that</b> <b>Florida</b> ignored existing literature on the topic of the connections between personalities and places. Likewise, Tom Hutton in the journal Economic Geography noted the absence of influential academics Allen Scott and Peter Hall in the text.|$|E

5|$|Despite his willing {{adherence}} to the Southern position {{on the issues that}} were dividing the country, Mallory was not prominent in the secession movement. He advocated reconciliation almost up to the moment <b>that</b> <b>Florida</b> passed its ordnance of secession.

On January 21, Mallory delivered his farewell speech in the United States Senate.|$|E

50|$|In 1840, {{a public}} meeting in Pensacola {{produced}} a demand <b>that</b> West <b>Florida</b> be united with Alabama.

25|$|The United States {{acquired}} Florida from Spain {{through the}} Adams-Onís Treaty in 1819 and took {{possession of the}} territory in 1821.

25|$|The {{city had}} just begun to recover from the 1926 {{hurricane}} when another devastating hurricane struck, this time to the north, in Palm Beach County. The 1928 Okeechobee Hurricane only slightly damaged Fort Lauderdale, but the enormous death toll contributed to the perception <b>that</b> <b>Florida</b> was not the paradise that had been promoted by developers. When the Great Depression struck in 1929, it had little effect on the city, which was already in a depression from the real estate bubble burst three years earlier.|$|E
25|$|Though Havana, {{which had}} become the third-largest city in the Americas, was to enter an era of {{sustained}} development and closening ties with North America during this period, the British occupation of the city proved short-lived.

Less {{than a year after}} Havana was seized, the Peace of Paris was signed by the three warring powers, ending the Seven Years' War. The treaty gave Britain Florida in exchange for Cuba on France's recommendation to Spain, The French advised that declining the offer could result in Spain losing Mexico and much of the South American mainland to the British.

25|$|Slemmer and Gilman {{stepped aside}} and soon {{returned}} {{to say they}} would reply the next day. Slemmer asked Chase how many men he had, whether he could take the fort by storm and how many men {{he thought he would}} lose. Chase replied that he could take the fort but supposed he might lose half of his force. Slemmer responded that he did not believe Chase was willing to make that sacrifice. Chase said that Slemmer must know <b>that</b> <b>Florida</b> could not permit the fort to be held and that an attack would start a civil war. Slemmer said he wanted to consult with the captains of two U.S. Navy vessels in the harbor. The next day, as the Navy vessels withdrew, Slemmer refused the demand for surrender of the fort. He refused a similar demand from Chase on January 18, 1861.|$|E
500|$|In 2009, Rousso {{spoke in}} favor of changes to Florida {{gambling}} laws that would remove caps on buy-ins and wagers on poker in the state.

[...] In 2007, a $100 cap replaced a $2/bet limit. This cap still prohibits large tournaments with multi-thousand dollar buy-ins from occurring in Florida.|$|E

5000|$|On August 21, 2014, Judge Hinkle {{issued a}} ruling in Brenner and Grimsley that granted the {{same-sex}} couple plaintiffs' motion for a preliminary injunction. In ordering the injunction, Judge Hinkle found <b>that</b> <b>Florida's</b> statutory and constitutional bans on same-sex marriage were unconstitutional: This order holds {{that marriage is}} a fundamental right as that term is used in cases arising under the Fourteenth Amendment's Due Process and Equal Protection Clauses, <b>that</b> <b>Florida's</b> same-sex marriage provisions thus must be reviewed under strict scrutiny, and that, when so reviewed, the provisions are unconstitutional. Judge Hinkle added: The institution of marriage survived when bans on interracial marriage were struck down, and the institution will survive when bans on same-sex marriage are struck down. Liberty, tolerance, and respect are not zero-sum concepts. Those who enter opposite-sex marriages are harmed not at all when others, including these plaintiffs, are given the liberty {{to choose their own}} life partners and are shown the respect that comes with formal marriage. Tolerating views with which one disagrees is a hallmark of civilized society.|$|R
500|$|The defendants, MacShara and Rudzewicz, filed {{a motion}} to dismiss the case on the {{argument}} as Michigan residents, the District Court of Southern Florida did not have jurisdiction. After a hearing, the Court ruled <b>that</b> <b>Florida</b> has personal jurisdiction under State of Florida's long-arm statute, stating that [...] "...a non-resident Burger King franchise {{is subject to the}} personal jurisdiction of this Court in actions arising out of its franchise agreements". The partners filed a counter claim and alleged Burger King had violated Michigan's Franchise Investment Law and sought damages and fees. After a short trial, the Court found for Burger King and ordered Rudzewicz and MacShara to close the restaurant and awarded Burger King damages, fees, and costs.|$|E
500|$|In 1973, rice rats were {{discovered}} at Cudjoe Key in the Florida Keys, and in 1978 Spitzer and Lazell described this {{population as a}} new species, Oryzomys argentatus. The status of this form—either a distinct species or not even subspecifically distinct from O.palustris natator—has remained controversial since; the 2005 third edition of Mammal Species of the World does not recognize O.argentatus as a separate species, but acknowledges a need for further research. A 2005 study using microsatellite DNA found <b>that</b> <b>Florida</b> Keys rice rats exhibit low genetic variation and are significantly different from Everglades rice rats; the study concluded in favor of classifying the Keys rice rat as a [...] "distinct vertebrate population". This population probably diverged from mainland rice rats about 2000 years ago.|$|E
500|$|In turn, Burger King Corporation {{asked for}} a rehearing, which was denied. Burger King then filed {{an appeal to the}} US Supreme Court, which agreed to hear the case on its merits, after which it would decide if it had {{jurisdiction}} to grant a writ of certiorari. In its decision, the Supreme Court overturned the Appellate Court and found <b>that</b> <b>Florida</b> does have jurisdiction in the case. The Court concluded that the defendants, Rudzewicz and MacShara, sought out their franchise in the state of Florida and were availed of the protections of that state and were, therefore, subject to jurisdiction there. Additionally, the Court reasoned that the defendants had a [...] "substantial and continuing" [...] relationship with Burger King in Florida and that due process would not be violated because the defendants should have reasonably anticipated being summoned into court in Florida for breach of contract.|$|E
50|$|Miami-Dade Circuit Judge Sarah Zabel held {{a hearing}} in the case on July 2 and granted the plaintiffs' motion for summary {{judgment}} on July 25. She found <b>that</b> <b>Florida's</b> same-sex marriage ban and related statutes deprive couples due process and {{equal protection of the}} laws as guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment. She noted <b>that</b> under <b>Florida</b> Supreme Court precedent she needed to apply rational basis review to laws discriminating against homosexuality, but suggested the Florida Supreme Court revisit the question of the appropriate level of scrutiny on appeal. She stayed enforcement of her decision pending appeal. She lifted that stay on January 5, 2015, ordering Miami-Dade County to issue licenses to same-sex couples, which county officials began doing around noon that day.|$|R
