40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the proper use}} and occurrence conditions of German tag questions, “oder, ” “ne, ” and “ja” and analyzes the characters of spoken language. It {{has been shown that}} tag questions are often used in informal situations where the speaker asks for active communication. The proper use of German tag question is to show “empathy. ” “Oder” is used when the speaker is cooperative with <b>the</b> <b>hearer,</b> and <b>the</b> speaker and <b>the</b> <b>hearer</b> share <b>the</b> same experience. In this case, the speaker asks empathy from <b>the</b> <b>hearer</b> and intention of <b>the</b> <b>hearer</b> is important. “Ne” is used when the speaker is cooperative with <b>the</b> <b>hearer,</b> and <b>the</b> speaker and <b>the</b> <b>hearer</b> {{do not have the same}} experience. As for this use, the speaker insists his/her opinion, and the intention of both of the speaker and <b>the</b> <b>hearer</b> are important. “Ja” is used when the speaker is persuasive with <b>the</b> <b>hearer,</b> and <b>the</b> speaker has confidence with his utterance and asks confirmation from the hearer; the intention of the speaker is important. These analyses suggest following three points, as the characters of the spoken language: (i) emotional distance between the speaker and <b>the</b> <b>hearer</b> can be changed, (ii) affection influence the selection of “oder”, “ne”, and “ja”, which do not show affection directly, and (iii) by expressing affection, the speaker can indirectly indicate his/her intention and ask <b>the</b> <b>hearer</b> for action...|$|R

40|$|Vianinda Pratama Sari. C 0305006. 2010. AN ANALYSIS OF VOCATIVE EXPRESSIONS IN THE FILM ENTITLED “BRING IT ON”. English Department. Faculty of Letters and Fine Arts. Sebelas Maret University. Surakarta This {{research}} investigates non-referential vocative expressions {{employed by}} {{the characters in the}} film entitled “Bring It On”. The objectives of this research are to find out the types of vocative expressions {{employed by the}} characters in the film entitled “Bring It On” and to describe the reasons why those characters employ a certain type of vocative expressions. This research used a descriptive qualitative research referring to the method to formulate the conclusion by collecting, classifying, and interpreting the data of the research. The data sources of the research were the film entitled “Bring It On” directed by Peyton Reed and its script found from the internet. All of the utterances containing non-referential vocative expressions employed by the characters in the film entitled “Bring It On” were used as the data of the research. This research applied purposive sampling technique in which several significant data containing non-referential vocative expressions were analyzed. Derived from the analysis, the research concludes that there are four types of vocative expressions employed by the characters in the film entitled “Bring It On” according to Kubo’s speech act theoretic analysis of vocatives. They are associative non-referential calling, dissociative non-referential calling, associative non-referential addressing, and dissociative non-referential addressing. Those different types of non-referential vocative expressions are certainly influenced by different contexts of situation. The reasons why the characters in the film entitled “Bring It On” employ a certain type of vocative expressions are analyzed based on either a perlocutionary act of association or a perlocutionary act of dissociaton contained in the vocative expression. Basically, there are two reasons why the characters employ a certain type of vocative expressions namely to associate <b>the</b> <b>hearer</b> and to dissociate <b>the</b> <b>hearer.</b> <b>The</b> reason that the speaker intends to associate <b>the</b> <b>hearer</b> is specifically divided into four reasons. The first reason is that the speaker has an intention to show his or her affection and to respect <b>the</b> <b>hearer.</b> This reason maintains a close relationship between the speaker and <b>the</b> <b>hearer.</b> <b>The</b> second reason is that the speaker intends to minimize <b>the</b> speaker- <b>hearer</b> distance. This reason occurs when the speaker has a higher social status than <b>the</b> <b>hearer.</b> <b>The</b> next reason is that the speaker intends to associate <b>the</b> <b>hearer</b> who dissociates <b>the</b> speaker. The basic context of this reason is that the speaker is hated by <b>the</b> <b>hearer</b> but <b>the</b> speaker is still willing to associate <b>the</b> <b>hearer.</b> <b>The</b> last reason is that the speaker has an intention to motivate <b>the</b> <b>hearer.</b> This reason occurs when <b>the</b> <b>hearer</b> needs to be motivated. On the other hands, the reason that the speaker has an intention to dissociate <b>the</b> <b>hearer</b> is divided into three reasons namely to tease <b>the</b> <b>hearer,</b> to show that the speaker does not like <b>the</b> <b>hearer,</b> and to show the speaker’s anger. The first reason is that the speaker has an intention to tease <b>the</b> <b>hearer.</b> This reason occurs when the speaker and <b>the</b> <b>hearer</b> have a bad relationship. The second reason is that the speaker intends to show that he or she does not like <b>the</b> <b>hearer.</b> Similar with <b>the</b> first reason, this reason occurs when the speaker has a bad relationship with <b>the</b> <b>hearer.</b> <b>The</b> last reason is related to the speaker’s intention to show his or her anger. The context occurred in this reason is that the speaker is angry since <b>the</b> <b>hearer</b> has made a mistake. Therefore, {{it can be said that}} the speaker has a bad relationship with <b>the</b> <b>hearer.</b> It is finally expected that this research will be useful for those who are interested in the related study. In addition, it is suggested that those who do research in linguistics are able to develop the research to other aspects of deixis. Furthermore, it is suggested that the film maker can provide vocative expressions containing insincere perlocutionary acts, exploitation of group term distinction and inconsistent vocative phrases so that the analysis will be more various and complete. ...|$|R
