5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>sexy</b> son {{hypothesis}} {{is closely related}} to the good genes assumption and the Fisherian runaway selection process. Like good genes, <b>the</b> <b>sexy</b> son hypothesis assumes the existence of indirect genetic benefits that are able to compensate any inferior direct reproductive success (i.e., fewer offspring). The main difference between good genes and <b>the</b> <b>sexy</b> son {{hypothesis is}} that the latter assumes an indirect effect due to the attractiveness of the sons, whereas good genes focus on the viability of both sons and daughters. However, [...] "attractiveness" [...] is not narrowly defined, and can refer to every trait that increases a male's probability to become polygynous.|$|R

25|$|One way to {{overcome}} this issue is to avoid introducing threatening friends to desirable mates. In one study women were shown three pictures of the same female. In one picture the model was dressed conservatively, {{in the other two}} she was dressed provocatively, but in the third the model had been photoshopped to have a larger frame. All the women tested rated the thin, provocatively dressed women as <b>the</b> <b>sexiest.</b> Participants were also twice as likely to avoid introducing the model to their partners compared to the conservatively dressed model, who was rated as the least threatening. The authors interpreted these findings as, women who are dressed provocatively are seen as more promiscuous, so therefore {{are less likely to be}} introduced to partners due to the possibility of poaching. Not introducing an attractive female to a mate, minimises the likelihood that poaching will occur as it is a form of indirect aggression that minimises contact between a mate and a potential threat.|$|E
