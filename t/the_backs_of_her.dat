There were freckles on <b>the</b> <b>backs</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> shoulders and acne on her face and chest.|$|E
500|$|Margaret Elizabeth [...] "Peggy" [...] Carter (portrayed by Hayley Atwell) is {{an officer}} with the Strategic Scientific Reserve (SSR) who worked with Captain America during World War II, {{falling in love with}} him before he {{seemingly}} sacrificed himself to stop the Nazi-division Hydra. Following the end of the war, Carter is working in a secretarial role despite her status as an agent. Approached by Howard Stark, whom she had also worked with during the war, to help clear his name after being framed for selling weapons to the USSR, Carter agrees to go behind <b>the</b> <b>backs</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> superiors. Her treason is eventually discovered by Agent Daniel Sousa, but she is let off when she helps stop the Russians. She goes on to earn the respect of her coworkers, instigate the defeat of Whitney Frost, and start a relationship with Sousa.|$|E
2500|$|Before Andrea Martin {{accepted}} the role, director René Auberjonois (Odo) confided in her that {{working under the}} Ferengi prosthetics would be the hardest acting she'd ever done if she'd never worked under such makeup before. [...] Auberjonois speculated that she took the role anyway because he'd been so upfront with her. [...] Martin's makeup for Ishka took three hours every day. [...] Ishka, being older, required extra development of the makeup protheses. [...] Makeup designer Michael Westmore explained that they [...] "made a thin skin that went over one of [...] stock Ferengi heads [...] [...] They [...] made a new face for her, wrinkled, and did <b>the</b> <b>backs</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> hands." [...] The script for [...] "Family Business" [...] also complicated the makeup process because it called for Ishka to be nude in several scenes; therefore, makeup needed to be developed for parts of Ferengi never before seen. [...] One take over Ishka's shoulder had to be reshot because the producers felt that Martin's [...] "supple skin" [...] didn't match the character; Westmore and crew [...] "took Kleenex, wrinkled it up and rubberized it, and covered her back and shoulders", a process Martin didn't care for, saying, [...] "Boy, if you hadn't warned me about this, I would be out the door." ...|$|E

6000|$|She turns away, shuddering, {{and sits}} {{down on the edge of}} the [...] armchair, {{covering}} her eyes with <b>the</b> <b>backs</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> hands.

60|$|But to {{have got}} there at last {{was a great}} comfort, {{especially}} as there were lights still burning in the office window, and therefore some hope {{that she was not}} too late.

60|$|But Miss Ledrook wouldn't come to Miss Snevellicci, so Miss Snevellicci {{was obliged}} to go to Miss Ledrook, which she did, in a {{skipping}} manner that was quite fascinating; and Miss Ledrook evidently joked Miss Snevellicci about being struck with Nicholas; for, after some playful whispering, Miss Snevellicci hit Miss Ledrook very hard on <b>the</b> <b>backs</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> hands, and retired up, {{in a state of}} pleasing confusion.|$|E

6000|$|While thus discoursing he had unbuckled {{his empty}} scabbard. He sent it flying under the bed, and, {{lowering}} {{the point of}} the sword, brushed past the perplexed Lieut.

Feraud did not seem to see her, but she ran after him and seized his left arm. He shook her off, and then she rushed towards Lieut. D'Hubert and clawed at the sleeve of his uniform.|$|E

After this she sat a while brooding and listening to the pulsing of her heart, which was beating with unusual strength this night. As she did so in that mysterious hour which sometimes comes to us in English summers, a great change fell upon her. When she sat down upon that fallen tree she was still a girl and virginal; when she rose from it she was a developed, loving woman. It was as though a spirit had visited her and whispered in her ear. She could almost hear the words. They were: ...|$|E

60|$|I must {{describe}} that group. Of the figure {{next to me}} I could only see the back. It was a broad back done up in black silk not of the newest. The whole figure, one may say, was dumpy. The black silk was not long, as dresses now are worn, nor wide in its skirts. In every way it was skimpy, considering the breadth it had to cover; and below the silk I saw the heels of two thick shoes, and enough to swear by of two woollen stockings. Above the silk was a red and blue shawl; and above that a ponderous, elaborate brown bonnet, as to the materials of which I should not wish to undergo an examination. Over and beyond this I could only see <b>the</b> <b>backs</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> two hands. They were held up as though in wonder at that which the red-nosed holder of the scissors had dared to do.|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't {{know what}} I feel for you," [...] she {{answered}} in an agonized voice, her fingers tightening over <b>the</b> <b>backs</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> white hands. [...] "If reverence be love--if trust be love, infinite and absolute trust--if gratitude be love--if emptiness after you are gone {{be a sign}} of it--yes, I love you. If the power to see clearly only through you, to interpret myself only by your aid be love, I acknowledge it. I tell you so freely, as of your right to know. And the germ of which you spoke is you. You have grown until you have taken possession of--of what is left of me. If I had only been able to see clearly from the first, Peter, I should be another woman to-day, a whole woman, a wise woman. Oh, I have thought of it much. The secret of life was there at my side from the time I was able to pronounce your name, and I couldn't see it. You had it. You stayed. You took duty where you found it, and it has made you great. Oh, I don't mean to speak in a worldly sense. When I say that, it is to express the highest human quality of which I can think and feel. But I can't marry you. You must see it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, sir!" [...] Wemmick went on; [...] "it happened--happened, don't you see?--that {{this woman}} was so very artfully dressed {{from the time of}} her apprehension, that she looked much slighter than she really was; in particular, her sleeves are always remembered to have been so skilfully {{contrived}} that her arms had quite a delicate look. She had only a bruise or two about her,--nothing for a tramp,--but <b>the</b> <b>backs</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> hands were lacerated, and the question was, Was it with finger-nails? Now, Mr. Jaggers showed that she had struggled through a great lot of brambles which were not as high as her face; but which she could not have got through and kept her hands out of; and bits of those brambles were actually found in her skin and put in evidence, as well as the fact that the brambles in question were found on examination to have been broken through, and to have little shreds of her dress and little spots of blood upon them here and there. But the boldest point he made was this: it was attempted to be set up, in proof of her jealousy, that she was under strong suspicion of having, at about the time of the murder, frantically destroyed her child by this man--some three years old--to revenge herself upon him. Mr. Jaggers worked that in this way: [...] "We say these are not marks of finger-nails, but marks of brambles, and we show you the brambles. You say they are marks of finger-nails, and you set up the hypothesis that she destroyed her child. You must accept all consequences of that hypothesis. For anything we know, she may have destroyed her child, and the child in clinging to her may have scratched her hands. What then? You are not trying her for the murder of her child; why don't you? As to this case, if you will have scratches, we say that, for anything we know, you may have accounted for them, assuming {{for the sake of argument}} that you have not invented them?" [...] "To sum up, sir," [...] said Wemmick, [...] "Mr. Jaggers was altogether too many for the jury, and they gave in." ...|$|E

50|$|Of {{their three}} children, the oldest is Hillary (Kaylee DeFer), a typical 17-year-old who {{frequently}} misbehaves, {{trying to get}} away with bad behavior behind <b>the</b> <b>backs</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> parents, who often regard her with suspicion. Second oldest is 16-year-old Larry (Kyle Sullivan), an odd misfit given to emotional outbursts (such as when Vicky denies him permission to see Brian Boitano star as Bilbo Baggins in The Lord of the Rings On Ice). Larry is often seen with his best friend Kenny (Rami Malek). Initially Dave believes that the boys are both gay, but it is later revealed to the audience that while Larry is not gay, Kenny has a secret crush on Larry. Dave, {{and to a lesser extent}} Vicky, often treat Larry's flamboyancy with wary eyes. The youngest child, the pubescent 14-year-old Mike (Dean Collins), must deal with issues such as masturbation, dating and underage gambling. His character is portrayed as tougher and more cynical than Larry's.|$|E
50|$|In 1974, {{there were}} rumors that Hunter forgeries were being sold by William J. Toye in New Orleans. Decades later, the Federal Bureau of Investigations (FBI) {{investigated}} reports of forgery of Hunter's works and raided the home of Toye in September 2009. Toye, {{who was accused of}} selling forged paintings three times over the course of four decades, pleaded guilty in federal court on June 6, 2011. Others, including a relative of Hunter's and one of Henry's have forged Hunter's artwork as well. Whitehead says Toye's fakes were the best. His forgeries were painted on vintage board and his brush strokes and monogram were good replicas of Hunter's. But Hunter normally left smudges on <b>the</b> <b>backs</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> work and marred the edges, distinguishing marks missing from Toye's counterfeits. Whitehead said that unlike the work of European masters, which generally has well-documented provenance, Hunter produced thousands of paintings, which she sold from her front door. Also, collectors spending millions are more prone to research the history of their prospective purchases than folk art collectors spending much less. The price for Hunter paintings range between a few thousand dollars to $20,000 according to Whitehead.|$|E
