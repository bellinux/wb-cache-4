5|$|The dromedary's diet {{consists}} {{mostly of}} foliage, dry grasses and desert vegetation mostly thorny plants. A study said the <b>typical</b> <b>diet</b> of the dromedary is dwarf shrubs (47.5%), trees (29.9%), grasses (11.2%), other herbs (0.2%) and vines (11%). The dromedary {{is primarily a}} browser; forbs and shrubs comprise 70% of its diet in summer and 90% of its diet in winter. The dromedary may also graze on tall, young, succulent grasses.|$|E
5|$|At the time, hadrosaurids {{were thought}} to have been aquatic animals, and Kräusel made a point of stating that the {{specimen}} did not rule out hadrosaurids eating water plants. The discovery of possible gut contents made little impact in English-speaking circles, except for another brief mention of the aquatic-terrestrial dichotomy, until it was brought up by John Ostrom in the course of an article reassessing the old interpretation of hadrosaurids as water-bound. Instead of trying to adapt the discovery to the aquatic model, he used it as a line of evidence that hadrosaurids were terrestrial herbivores. While his interpretation of hadrosaurids as terrestrial animals has been generally accepted, the Senckenberg plant fossils remain equivocal. Kenneth Carpenter has suggested that they may actually represent the gut contents of a starving animal, instead of a <b>typical</b> <b>diet.</b> Other authors have noted that because the plant fossils were removed from their original context in the specimen and were heavily prepared, it is no longer possible to follow up on the original work, leaving open the possibility that the plants were washed-in debris.|$|E
25|$|Aspartic acid (aspartate) {{is one of}} {{the most}} common amino acids in the <b>typical</b> <b>diet.</b> As with {{methanol}} and phenylalanine, intake of aspartic acid from aspartame is less than would be expected from other dietary sources. At the 90th percentile of intake, aspartame provides only between 1% and 2% of the daily intake of aspartic acid. There has been some speculation that aspartame, in conjunction with other amino acids like glutamate, may lead to excitotoxicity, inflicting damage on brain and nerve cells. However, clinical studies have shown no signs of neurotoxic effects, and studies of metabolism suggest it is not possible to ingest enough aspartic acid and glutamate through food and drink to levels that would be expected to be toxic.|$|E
50|$|Any {{complete}} diet {{must contain}} some protein, but the nutritional {{value of the}} protein relates directly to its amino acid composition and digestibility. High-quality fishmeal normally contains between 60% and 72% crude protein by weight. <b>Typical</b> <b>diets</b> for fish may contain from 32% to 45% total protein by weight.|$|R

2500|$|She {{also used}} the book to {{describe}} in detail her belief that most Americans inflicted harm on themselves with their <b>typical</b> <b>diets,</b> which was excessively high in salt, refined sugars, pesticides, growth hormones, preservatives and other additives, and thereby [...] "devitalized" [...] of its essential nutrients by the excessive processing. As a result, she says countless adults and most children in the U.S. [...] "have never once had a mouthful of genuinely wholesome food." [...] She recognizes that wholesome foods are difficult to obtain in supermarkets, {{which is one of}} the reasons she recommends vitamin supplements.|$|R
25|$|Phenylalanine {{is one of}} the {{essential}} amino acids and is required for normal growth and maintenance of life. Concerns about the safety of phenylalanine from aspartame for those without phenylketonuria center largely on hypothetical changes in neurotransmitter levels as well as ratios of neurotransmitters {{to each other in the}} blood and brain that could lead to neurological symptoms. Reviews of the literature have found no consistent findings to support such concerns, and while high doses of aspartame consumption may have some biochemical effects, these effects are not seen in toxicity studies to suggest aspartame can adversely affect neuronal function. Like methanol, common foods in the <b>typical</b> <b>diet,</b> such as milk, meat, and fruits, will lead to ingestion of significantly higher amounts of phenylalanine than would be expected from aspartame consumption.|$|E
25|$|From a dietary perspective, plant cells do not {{manufacture}} cholesterol, {{and it is}} {{not found}} in plant foods. Some plant foods, such as avocado, flax seeds and peanuts, contain phytosterols, which compete with cholesterol for absorption in the intestines, reducing the absorption of both dietary and bile cholesterol. However, a <b>typical</b> <b>diet</b> contributes on the order of 0.2 grams of phytosterols, which is not enough to {{have a significant impact on}} blocking cholesterol absorption. Phytosterols intake can be supplemented through the use of phytosterol-containing functional foods or dietary supplements that are recognized as having potential to reduce levels of LDL-cholesterol. Some supplemental guidelines have recommended doses of phytosterols in the 1.6–3.0grams per day range (Health Canada, EFSA, ATP III, FDA). A recent meta-analysis demonstrating a 12% reduction in LDL-cholesterol at a mean dose of 2.1grams per day. However, the benefits of a diet supplemented with phytosterols have been questioned.|$|E
2500|$|When Phe {{cannot be}} metabolized by the body, a <b>typical</b> <b>diet</b> {{that would be}} healthy for people without PKU causes {{abnormally}} high levels of Phe to accumulate in the blood, which is toxic to the brain. If left untreated, complications of PKU include severe intellectual disability, brain function abnormalities, microcephaly, mood disorders, irregular motor functioning, and behavioral problems such as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, {{as well as physical}} symptoms such as a [...] "musty" [...] odor, eczema, and unusually light skin and hair coloration.|$|E

30|$|Nonetheless, of all {{essential}} AAs, lysine is {{the most}} strongly conserved one, as demonstrated in rats and chicks (Flodin 1997; Benevenga and Blemings 2007). Meredith et al. (1986) reported that in young men when lysine intake was reduced, the oxidation of lysine decreased significantly, which {{was supported by the}} study of the activity of liver LKR (the initial enzyme in the saccharopine pathway) that was decreased in rats treated with less lysine (Chu and Hegsted 1976). These findings suggested that lysine is unique in that it is less catabolized than most, if not all, other essential AAs. This unique conservative nature of lysine is very interesting because lysine {{is the most}} deficient AA in almost all <b>typical</b> <b>diets</b> for monogastric animals such as pigs.|$|R
2500|$|Early British {{settlers}} brought familiar {{meats and}} crops with them from Europe and these remain {{important in the}} Australian diet. The British settlers found some familiar game – such as swan, goose, pigeon, and fish – but the new settlers often had difficulty adjusting to the prospect of native fauna as a staple diet. They established agricultural industries producing more familiar Western style produce. Queensland and New South Wales became Australia's main beef cattle producers, while dairy cattle farming {{is found in the}} southern states, predominantly in Victoria. Wheat and other grain crops are spread fairly evenly throughout the mainland states. Sugar cane is also a major crop in Queensland and New South Wales. Fruit and vegetables are grown throughout Australia. [...] "Meat and three veg", fish and chips, and the Australian meat pie continue to represent traditional meals for many Australians. The post-World War II multicultural immigration program brought new flavours and influences, with waves of immigrants from Greece, Italy, Vietnam, China, and elsewhere bringing about diversification of the <b>typical</b> <b>diet</b> consumed.|$|E
2500|$|Diet was {{an issue}} that is often {{discussed}} through this time, as an aspect of medical care. [...] Since our idea of modern technology did not exist, diet was a simple way for Romans to attain a healthy life. [...] This remains true in the Roman Military as the soldiers required appropriate nutrition in order to function at high activity levels. Because of the number of the people requiring food, there were unique circumstances in the acquisition of food. [...] During a campaign the soldiers would often forage food from their enemies land. [...] In fact as part of the standard kit, Roman soldiers would carry a sickle, which would be used to forage food. [...] They would carry a three-day ration of food in case they were in a situation where foraging was not available. [...] This would largely consist of items such as wheat and barley. [...] During a time of peace, the Roman Army would have had a <b>typical</b> <b>diet</b> consisting of bacon, cheese, vegetables, and beer to drink. Corn is mentioned in their works as well, however; this was a [...] common term that was applied to their use of grain. [...] The Roman use of the term corn is {{not to be confused with}} maize, which did not come to Europe until the discovery of the New World. [...] Items such as poultry and fish were also likely part of the standard diet. [...] The soldier was given a ration, which was taken from his pay. [...] This shows that the soldiers were well fed in times of peace. [...] If the soldiers were well fed, they were healthier and able to maintain a high level of physical activity, as well as stave off disease. [...] Disease is something that is easier to prevent rather than treat. [...] This idea holds true in the event a fort was under siege; certain food items were rationed such as poultry. [...] The reasoning behind this was that poultry was very inexpensive to maintain and in the event of a siege it did not require a lot of resources to maintain. [...] It was also noted that poultry had benefits for those who were sick. [...] This demonstrates the idea was present that the army needed to maintain the health of its members regardless of circumstances. [...] These discoveries were made while looking at the remains of Roman military sites. [...] By excavating these sites and looking at fecal matter found, scientists were able to determine what was eaten. [...] It is a simple fact that poor diet negatively affects a military's combat readiness. [...] The variety of food found shows the Romans were not focused on just caloric intake, as they knew a variety of food was important to health.|$|E
