40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} the market basket {{analysis}} of <b>sports</b> <b>equipment,</b> which is relatively less explored area in the literature. In the present investigation, market basket analysis of <b>sports</b> <b>equipment</b> would be done by collecting primary data directly from retail and wholesale sports basket. FP-Growth algorithm is an efficient algorithm for mining frequent patterns. In particular, we apply FP-Growth algorithm on the data collected directly from the sports vendors to trace various associations leading to a <b>sports</b> <b>equipment</b> basket. One particular advantage is that it circumvents the need for producing candidate sets, which is typically computationally intensive. The findings of this paper {{can be applied to}} optimize marketing and sale of <b>sports</b> <b>equipment.</b> In particular, knowing different dynamics of <b>sports</b> <b>equipment</b> basket, <b>sports</b> vender can optimize the display of <b>sports</b> <b>equipment</b> on their premises to maximize sales...|$|R
