40|$|OBJECTIVE—To explore parents' {{experiences}} of bereavement care after withdrawal of newborn intensive care.  DESIGN—Face to face interviews with 108 parents of 62 babies born over two calendar {{years in the}} East of Scotland.  RESULTS—Only 22 % were seen by six weeks after the death, 10 % were not recalled before 6 - 11 months, and 8 % were not seen {{at all in the}} first year. All except one couple saw the neonatologist who had cared for their baby. Only 33 % remembered a neonatal nurse being present. Most (88 %) were seen in the study hospital. Parents highlighted a number of specific needs. Appointments should be: (a) scheduled soon after the death of the baby and certainly within two months of the death irrespective of whether or not autopsy results are available; (b) with the named neonatologist; (c) in a setting away from the hospital if possible. Parents value: (a) efforts to find out how they are coping; (b) full frank information given sensitively to enable them to build up a cohesive picture of what happened and assess their future risks; (c) reassurance where possible, but half truths, false reassurances, and broken promises are unacceptable.  CONCLUSIONS—Follow up care is a crucial part of the management of families from whose babies treatment has been withdrawn. Resources devoted to it should be re-examined to provide a service more in tune with parental need. In choosing the place, <b>timing,</b> <b>and</b> <b>conduct</b> of the meeting, staff should be sensitive to the expressed wishes of the parents themselves. ...|$|E

40|$|We {{develop a}} game-theoretic model {{to study the}} timing of new product preannouncement and launch under competition. We derive firms' optimal <b>timing</b> choices <b>and</b> <b>conducted</b> a {{numerical}} analysis to evaluate the role of various factors. Our analytical and numerical results showed that anticipated competitor's timing choices are the most significant factors. A firm should not preannounce early unless the preannouncement is effective in creating pent-up demands. However, the preannouncement and launch should be rushed if the quality or profit margin of the new product is high, and postponed if the market share of the existing product is high. The market leader should preannounce earlier in a simultaneous game than in a sequential game, but the opposite for the market follower. Data collected from the microprocessor industry validated our model. New product preannouncement Firm competition Pent-up demand Competitive strategy...|$|R
40|$|Visual {{stimulation}} paradigms in perception research {{often require}} accurate timing for presentation of visual stimuli. Acquisition of exact stimulus update timestamps in realtime is often crucial, both for synchronization of stimulus updates between different presentation modalities and for logging. Modern graphics hardware, multi-core processors and operating systems provide a far {{higher level of}} functionality, flexibility, and performance in terms of throughput, than systems a decade ago. They also pose new challenges for precise presentation timing or timestamping. Typical causes of interference are, eg the dynamic power management of modern graphics cards and computers, novel hybrid graphics solutions, user interface desktop composition and the properties of graphics- and CPU-scheduling of the latest generation of operating systems. This work presents results for the accuracy and robustness of visual presentation <b>timing</b> <b>and</b> timestamping tests, <b>conducted</b> within Psychtoolbox- 3 (Kleiner et al, 2007 Perception 36 ECVP Supplement, 14) on different operating systems and graphics cards under realistic stimulus presentation loads.

30|$|Furthermore, a {{much more}} {{preferable}} way is to combine the above two transmission strategies together. For such a reconfigurable USCS transceiver, when the local clock deviation has exceeded the tolerable error threshold according to the synchronization drifting property, we may use the continuous transmission (i.e., the carrier-synchronized modulation) to correct <b>timing</b> deviations, <b>and</b> simultaneously, <b>conduct</b> energy reservation from received signals {{for the purpose of}} prolonging lifetime of low-cost battery-powered sensor nodes. Once the timing calibration has been completed, or sufficient energy has been accumulated, we may immediately switch to an intermittent mode. In such a hybrid case, the operational power of USCS receiver can be minimized, while ensuring a substantial transmission performance with the assistance of simple <b>and</b> accurate <b>timing</b> technique accompanying low-complexity noncoherent detection.|$|R

40|$|Six male {{subjects}} {{took part}} in a pilot study on a stationary wheelchair ergometer. They propelled the ergometer at a speed of 0. 55, 0. 83, 1. 11 and 1. 39 m/s. The speed increased every 3 min. Inertia and friction force were adjusted proportional to body weight. Every third minute 750 samples of the torque and velocity signals were digitized at a sampling rate of 100 Hz. From the signals mean external power output (Pmean), peak power (Ppeak), mean torque (Mmean) and peak torque (Mpeak), work/cycle, 'time-to-peak torque' (TTP), cycle duration (CT), push time (PT) and recovery time (RT) were determined in relation to mean velocity (speed). For the mean velocity range studied, analysis of variance (P less than 0. 05) revealed significant increments in Ppeak, Mpeak, Pmean, Mmean and work/cycle with increasing mean velocity, whereas CT and PT showed a significant decrease. TTP showed a decrease with speed which, however, was not statistically significant. The RT showed no significant variation as well. Our previous research into propulsion techniques mainly focused on movement frequency <b>and</b> <b>timing</b> <b>and</b> was <b>conducted</b> during wheelchair ambulation on a motor driven treadmill. Despite considerable interindividual variation in terms of movement pattern, current and previous studies showed similar trends in the timing pattern (cycle, push, recovery duration) with respect to speed. Theoretical considerations regarding variations in peak torque and work/cycle with respect to velocity are supported by the current results. Both torque and work/cycle are important technique parameters and of relevance in speed regulation. The data also suggest that wheelchair ambulation can be validly simulated and studied with the special purpose wheelchair ergometer. (ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS...|$|R

40|$|The {{alfalfa weevil}} Hypera postica (Gyllenhal) {{is the most}} {{destructive}} pest of leguminous crops such as alfalfa, Chinese milk vetch, and hairy vetch throughout the world, including Japan. To control H. postica, the solitary endoparasitoid Bathyplectes anurus (Thomson) was released in Japan as a classical biological control agent. In our study, we investigated the bottom-up effects of hairy vetch seeding methods (i. e., control of seeding <b>timing</b> <b>and</b> density) on the B. anurus density to develop a field production method for B. anurus. The average densities of H. postica and B. anurus were significantly higher with early <b>timing</b> <b>and</b> a higher seeding density compared with early <b>timing</b> <b>and</b> a lower seeding density, late <b>timing</b> <b>and</b> a higher seeding density <b>and</b> late <b>timing,</b> <b>and</b> a lower seeding density. This confirmed that the densities of H. postica and B. anurus could be adjusted by the bottom-up effect of hairy vetch seeding methods. During the tri-trophic interaction among hairy vetch, H. postica, and B. anurus, {{the interaction between the}} hairy vetch weight and H. postica densities was high, whereas the interaction between the H. postica and B. anurus densities was very high. These results suggested that early <b>timing</b> <b>and</b> high density seeding indirectly enhanced the density of B. anurus by strong direct effects of the H. postica density on the B. anurus during the tri-trophic interaction. Overall, we concluded that a combination of early <b>timing</b> <b>and</b> high density hairy vetch seeding may facilitate efficient field productions of B. anurus...|$|R
