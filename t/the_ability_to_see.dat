5|$|Another {{example of}} his {{leadership}} and his coup d'œil, <b>the</b> <b>ability</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> at a glance {{what needed to be}} done, occurred after the Battle of Kolin. The loss at Kolin forced the King to lift the siege at Prague. The King's brother, Augustus William, took command of the army and ordered the retreat from Prague. Seydlitz was attached to the advanced corps of Karl Christoph von Schmettau in a brigade of ten squadrons. As Seydlitz's wing entered Lusatia, near the town of Zittau, the Austrians were present in force, and Seydlitz with his squadrons were trapped in the town. Tricking the Austrians into thinking his troop was a foraging party, his cavalry burst on the Austrian cavalry before they could climb into their saddles. Seydlitz led his cavalry in an escape, in close column, and was quickly out of sight.|$|E

In Mary's case, the identifications and categorizations of color will only be in respect to representations of black and white.|$|E
