5|$|Paley's Natural Theology is an {{extended}} argument, constructed around {{a series of}} examples including finding a watch; comparing the eye to a telescope; {{and the existence of}} finely adapted mechanical structures in animals, such as joints which function like hinges or manmade ball and socket joints. Paley argues that these all lead to an intelligent Creator, and that a system is more <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>sum</b> <b>of</b> <b>its</b> parts. The last chapters are more theological in character, arguing that the attributes of God must be sufficient for the extent of his operations, and that God must be good because designs seen in nature are beneficial.|$|E

25|$|Gloucestershire {{was very}} {{successful}} in one-day cricket in the late 1990s and early 2000s winning several titles under the captaincy of Mark Alleyne and coaching of John Bracewell. The club operated on a small budget and was famed as a team greater <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>sum</b> <b>of</b> <b>its</b> parts, boasting few international stars. Gloucestershire's overall knockout record between 1999 and 2002 was 28 wins and seven losses from 37 games, including 16 wins from 18 at the Bristol County Ground.|$|E
25|$|It has {{not been}} contested that {{cardiovascular}} risk factors tend to cluster together; the matter of contention has been the assertion that the metabolic syndrome is anything more <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>sum</b> <b>of</b> <b>its</b> constituent parts. Phenotypic heterogeneity (for example, represented by variation in metabolic syndrome factor combinations among individuals with metabolic syndrome) has fueled that debate. However, more recent evidence suggests that common triggers (for example, excessive sugar-intake in the environment of overabundant food) {{can contribute to the}} development of multiple metabolic abnormalities at the same time, supporting the commonality of the energy utilization and storage pathways in metabolic syndrome.|$|E
25|$|Resultative constructions are set {{syntactic}} patterns used {{to express}} resultativeness. Within these structures, the object NP is viewed as having undergone some change of state, and the change {{is viewed as a}} result achieved through the action expressed by the combination of the verb and the result phrase. The word order of the elements is said to be constant and crucial in conveying the resultative meaning; under this analysis, the output in its entirety is regarded as having a more complex meaning <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>sum</b> <b>of</b> <b>its</b> components' individual meanings. This constructional approach has been proposed in order to account for the semantic differences between standalone verbs that have no intrinsic resultative meaning and their resultative counterparts (e.g. hammer versus hammer flat).|$|E

25|$|On 12 September 2012 it was {{reported}} that BAE and EADS were in discussions regarding a possible merger. In the event of the merger, BAE shareholders would own 40% and EADS 60% of the new enlarged organisation. A key French EADS shareholder Lagardere asked EADS to rethink the proposed merger plan as the conditions were unsatisfactory. The bosses of BAE Systems and EADS issued a joint statement seeking political support for their proposed 35 billion euro (US$45 billion) merger from the British, French and German governments; and reiterated that the combination is borne out of opportunity, not necessity and the new company would be greater <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>sum</b> <b>of</b> <b>its</b> parts. It {{was reported}} on 10 October 2012, that the merger between BAE Systems and EADS had been called off.|$|E
25|$|It {{has been}} found that two {{converging}} bimodal stimuli can produce a perception that is not only different in magnitude <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>sum</b> <b>of</b> <b>its</b> parts, but also quite different in quality. In a classic study labeled the McGurk effect, a person's phoneme production was dubbed with a video of that person speaking a different phoneme. The end result was the perception of a third, different phoneme. McGurk and MacDonald (1976) explained that phonemes such as ba, da, ka, ta, ga and pa can be divided into four groups, those that can be visually confused, i.e. (da, ga, ka, ta) and (ba and pa), and those that can be audibly confused. Hence, when ba – voice and ga lips are processed together, the visual modality sees ga or da, and the auditory modality hears ba or da, combining to form the percept da.|$|E
500|$|Durkheim {{sought to}} create {{one of the first}} {{rigorous}} scientific approaches to social phenomena. Along with Herbert Spencer, {{he was one of the}} first people to explain the existence and quality of different parts of a society by reference to what function they served in maintaining the quotidian (i.e. by how they make society [...] "work"). He also agreed with Spencer's organic analogy, comparing society to a living organism. Thus his work is sometimes seen as a precursor to functionalism. Durkheim also insisted that society was more <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>sum</b> <b>of</b> <b>its</b> parts.|$|E

500|$|In fact, Whitehead {{describes}} any entity as in {{some sense}} nothing more and nothing less <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>sum</b> <b>of</b> <b>its</b> relations to other entities – its synthesis of and reaction to the world around it. [...] A real thing is just that which forces {{the rest of the}} universe to in some way conform to it; that is to say, if theoretically a thing made strictly no difference to any other entity (i.e. it was not related to any other entity), it could not be said to really exist. [...] Relations are not secondary to what a thing is, they are what the thing is.|$|E
500|$|Not all reviews were negative. TV Equals {{called the}} episode [...] "pretty funny," [...] {{particularly}} praising the episode's cold opening. Jeffrey Hyatt from Screen Crave awarded the episode a 7 out of 10, noting that [...] "There have been worse. And {{this is another}} one I will re-watch later and probably like better the second time around." [...] IGN reviewer Cindy White gave the episode a 7.0 out of 10 rating, signifying a [...] "good episode."

500|$|Science fiction critic Paul Kincaid {{had mixed}} {{feelings}} about the novel. In a review at the SF Site webzine he criticized the characterisation saying {{that he could not}} always separate the main characters. Kincaid questioned the need for the supernatural entity, the Typhon, which is never developed. He described the [...] "end of time" [...] sequence as [...] "the most powerful science fictional moment in this entire book", saying that he found it [...] "far more scary, far more gripping, than any supernatural intervention". Kincaid said that while he found the book [...] "ambitious" [...] and [...] "intellectually satisfying", [...] "somehow the whole feels less <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>sum</b> <b>of</b> <b>its</b> parts".|$|E

500|$|Upon release, Mass Effect {{received}} {{critical acclaim}} from video game publications. The game's interactive storytelling and cinematic design were highlighted very positively, while the combat and vehicle navigation were generally {{seen as the}} game's weakest features. Kevin VanOrd of GameSpot described Mass Effect as [...] "a great game with moments of brilliance {{and a number of}} small but significant obstacles that hold it back from reaching its true potential." [...] Similarly, IGN's Erik Brudvig considered it greater <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>sum</b> <b>of</b> <b>its</b> parts, stating that although Mass Effect features numerous technical issues, most of the game [...] "is so expertly delivered that it can transcend its weaknesses." ...|$|E
500|$|Wark {{was not a}} [...] "supremely talented" [...] player, but, {{according}} to football journalist Jim White, one who espoused team-work and team spirit: [...] "There {{is no question that}} the 'one-for-all, all-for-one' mentality generated in the Anfield dressing room was the engine that drove the great team. With players such as Alan Kennedy, John Wark, Sammy Lee and Craig Johnston, nobody could claim this was a collection of top-notch operators in the manner, say, of the current Real Madrid. Every week, they played as an entity greater <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>sum</b> <b>of</b> <b>its</b> parts." [...] He has been described as [...] "a defensive midfielder with an astonishing goalscoring record".|$|E
500|$|Writing for Rolling Stone in 2002, David Fricke {{included}} [...] "Within You Without You" [...] on {{his list}} of the [...] "25 Essential Harrison Performances". He described it as, variously, the Beatles' [...] "purest excursion... into raga", and [...] "at once beautiful and severe, a magnetic sermon about materialism and communal responsibility {{in the middle of}} a record devoted to gentle Technicolor anarchy". In his review of the 50th anniversary edition of Sgt. Pepper for the same publication, Mikal Gilmore said that only [...] "Within You Without You" [...] and Lennon's [...] "A Day in the Life" [...] transcend the album's legacy as [...] "a gestalt: a whole that was greater <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>sum</b> <b>of</b> <b>its</b> parts".|$|E

Club {{described}} the crossover as [...] "one big 90-minute movie," [...] {{and found it}} is only when the viewer is well into the broadcast that it becomes clear that there are two storylines from separate shows. Wilkins found [...] "Legends Of Today" [...] and [...] "Legends Of Yesterday" [...] charming feeling they [...] "operate on a more epic scale" [...] than either show's typical episode. Oliver's paternity storyline felt creaky to Wilkins, and he noted the episodes again strained [...] "to set up the latest spin-off". Despite these faults, he found [...] "the overall effect of this crossover two-parter ... pretty damn impressive," [...] and the [...] "team-up story ... grand enough to be more <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>sum</b> <b>of</b> <b>its</b> parts".|$|E

Rajeev Masand of CNN-IBN gave 3 out of 5 stars and said, [...] "Barfi had the potential to be great cinema, but as it stands it's a respectable film that's still better than a lot else you're likely to see." [...] On the contrary, Namrata Joshi of Outlook felt that [...] "The flashback within flashback narrative gets way too clumsy and turgid, the thriller twist absolutely pointless [...] appears much too crafted and self-consciously gorgeous, and feels eminently facile and plastic".|$|E
500|$|Upon {{its release}} Ecstasy {{received}} moderate critical acclaim.

In Loveless, a book from the 33⅓series about the My Bloody Valentine album of the same name, Mike McGonial referred to Ecstasy as a [...] "rarified, effete and poppy approach to Byrdsian rock" [...] and AllMusic rated the album two and a half out of five stars. In a separate review of Ecstasy and Wine, AllMusic writer Bradley Torreano described Ecstasy as the point where the band [...] "started moving toward Cocteau Twins territory, using guitarist Bilinda Butcher's airy voice to define their image" [...] and when [...] "Shields and Butcher [...] exploring the guitar landscapes that would later become their trademark".|$|E
