5|$|Each {{account is}} {{closed with a}} {{miniature}} woodcut known from {{its position in the}} text as a <b>tail-piece.</b> These small artworks depict aspects of country life, often with humorous subjects, but all with Bewick's eye for detail, style, and precision. Some add to the illustration of the bird in question, as for example the heron, where the <b>tail-piece</b> shows one heron catching an eel, and another flying away. The <b>tail-piece</b> for Sabine's snipe, a gamebird, shows a hunter firing, and a small bird falling to the ground. There is no exclusion of human life from the images: one <b>tail-piece</b> depicts a works complete with smoking chimney beside a river.|$|E
5|$|Also like Bewick, many {{articles}} {{end with}} a <b>tail-piece,</b> a small engraving, but here again Yarrell shows himself to be both more serious and less merely decorative than Bewick, with more information to impart. The Egyptian vulture article ends with a large and accurate engraving of another specimen, so the article shows both a young and an old bird, with clearly different plumage which is also described in the text.|$|E
5|$|Peter Hall's 1974 film Akenfield (from the 1969 book by Ronald Blythe) {{contains}} {{a scene where}} the grandfather {{as a young man}} is reaping a cornfield. He weeps when he accidentally crushes a bird's egg, an image derived from Bewick's <b>tail-piece</b> woodcut for the partridge. The woodcut shows a reaper with a scythe, a dead bird and its nest of a dozen eggs on the ground under the scythe, which has just lifted. George Ewart Evans used the image on the title page of his 1956 book about Blaxhall (near Charsfield, on which 'Akenfield' is probably partly based).|$|E

500|$|Alexander Fussell created {{most of the}} {{drawings}} for the book. Yarrell thanks Fussell in his Preface for [...] "nearly five hundred of {{the drawings}} on wood here employed", and John Thompson (1785–1866) and his sons for the [...] "very long series of engravings" [...] of the drawings. He also thanks his printers, Messrs. Bentley, Wilson and Fley for their care and skill. The pen for the remaining drawings, if any (the title page asserts there are 520 in the book), is not stated. As well as the figures of birds, there are 59 tail-pieces (following Bewick, small woodcuts {{to fill in the}} spaces at ends of articles), of which some are whimsical, like Bewick's, but many illustrate anatomical details, especially breastbones and windpipes, and others, although decorative, realistically depict aspects of bird behaviour or human interaction with birds. For example, the <b>tail-piece</b> for the [...] "Jack Snipe" [...] shows a bittern among reeds, swallowing a frog, while that for the [...] "Common Bittern" [...] shows [...] "a mode of shooting an Eagle from a pit".|$|E
2500|$|The strings {{were played}} by small {{electric}} powered rollers, which were self-rosinating, and a chromatic set of metal 'fingers'. The violin had no finger board. A small metal [...] "finger", activated by an electromagnet, rose {{from under the}} string lifting it in a [...] "V" [...] shaped slot thus stopping off the string. The strings were bowed by four small wheels made of discs of celluloid clamped together in a dish-shaped form. These applied just the right pressure to the strings and were driven by a variable-speed controlled motor. This and a mute allowed the volume of sound produced to be varied. The violin produced a full tone {{and was able to}} sound 1/2 note double stops at ragtime tempi. The staccato coil allowed the bows to leave the string {{a fraction of a second}} before the 'fingers'. The violin stayed in tune by a sophisticated array of tuning arms and weights. The vibrato was produced by using an electromagnet to shake the <b>tail-piece</b> of the violin.|$|E
2500|$|Around 900, the {{language}} spoken in the Faroes was Old Norse, which Norse settlers {{had brought with}} them {{during the time of}} the settlement of Faroe Islands (landnám) that began in 825. However, many of the settlers were not from Scandinavia, but descendants of Norse settlers in the Irish Sea region. In addition, women from Norse Ireland, Orkney, or Shetland often married native Scandinavian men before settling in the Faroe Islands and Iceland. [...] As a result, the Irish language has had some influence on both Faroese and Icelandic. There is some debatable evidence of Irish language place names in the Faroes: for example, the names of Mykines, Stóra Dímun, Lítla Dímun and Argir have been hypothesized to contain Celtic roots. Other examples of early-introduced words of Celtic origin are: [...] "blak/blaðak" [...] (buttermilk), cf. Middle Irish bláthach; [...] "drunnur" [...] (<b>tail-piece</b> of an animal), cf. Middle Irish dronn; [...] "grúkur" [...] (head, headhair), cf. Middle Irish gruaig; [...] "lámur" [...] (hand, paw), cf. Middle Irish lámh; [...] "tarvur" [...] (bull), cf. Middle Irish tarbh; and [...] "ærgi" [...] (pasture in the outfield), cf. Middle Irish áirge.|$|E

6000|$|Now {{it is in}} this widest {{sense that}} Lord Lytton understands the term; there are {{examples}} in his two pleasant volumes of all the forms already mentioned, and even of another which can only be admitted among fables by the utmost possible leniency of construction. [...] "Composure," [...] "Et Cætera," [...] and several more, are merely similes poetically elaborated. So, too, is the pathetic story of the grandfather and grandchild: the child, having treasured away an icicle and forgotten it for ten minutes, comes back to find it already nearly melted, and no longer beautiful: at the same time, the grandfather has just remembered and taken out a bundle of love-letters, which he too had stored away in years gone by, and then long neglected; and, behold! the letters are as faded and sorrowfully disappointing as the icicle. This is merely a simile poetically worked out; and yet it is in such as these, and some others, to be mentioned further on, that the author seems at his best. Wherever he has really written after the old model, {{there is something to be}} deprecated: in spite of all the spirit and freshness, in spite of his happy assumption of that cheerful acceptation of things as they are, which, rightly or wrongly, we come to attribute to the ideal fabulist, there is ever a sense as of something a little out of place. A form of literature so very innocent and primitive looks a little over-written in Lord Lytton's conscious and highly-coloured style. It may be bad taste, but sometimes we should prefer a few sentences of plain prose narration, and a little Bewick by way of <b>tail-piece.</b> So that it is not among those fables that conform most nearly to the old model, but one had nearly said among those that most widely differ from it, that we find the most satisfactory examples of the author's manner.|$|E
6000|$|The {{letters to}} Cromwell were {{published}} in Curll's [...] "Miscellanea," [...] of which the title-page says [...] "Printed in the year 1727;" [...] but the dedication to the letters themselves is dated June, 1726, {{and it was in}} 1726 that they appeared. The incidental and scanty notices of them at the time are sufficient to indicate the impression they produced. Thompson, writing in October to Aaron Hill, says that [...] "though careless and uncorrected, they are full of wit and gaiety." [...] There may have been many who thought that they did as much credit to the heart as {{to the head of the}} poet. [...] "I have read the collection of letters you mention," [...] Fenton wrote to Broome in September, 1726, [...] "and was delighted with nothing more than that air of sincerity, those professions of esteem and respect, and that deference paid to his friend's judgment in poetry which I have sometimes seen expressed to others, and I doubt not with the same cordial affection. If they are read in that light, they will be very entertaining and useful in the present age; but in the next, Cicero, Pliny, and Voiture may regain their reputation." [...] The comments on Pope's sincerity were plainly ironical. Fenton considered him to be extremely hypocritical, and some person concerned in the publication of 1726 must have formed the same opinion of his character, if the ludicrous <b>tail-piece</b> is intended to be typical of the letters. A little man whose diminutive stature did not permit him to clasp the taller figure in his arms while they stood upon a level, is represented as having jumped off the ground and seized his companion round the waist, who, with his hands thrown into the air at the painful vehemence of the embrace, is struggling to get loose. Undiscerning persons, who judged the poet by his words, would form a different estimate, and would perceive only proofs of his excellence where Fenton saw examples of his habitual insincerity. [...] "His correspondence," [...] says Johnson, of the later collection of 1735, [...] "filled the nation with praises of his candour, tenderness, and benevolence, the purity of his purposes, and the fidelity of his friendship."[16] ...|$|E
