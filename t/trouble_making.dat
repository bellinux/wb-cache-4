Jess feels overwhelming guilt for Leslie's death, but his father consoles him to keep their friendship alive for her sake.|$|E
5|$|At the time, Hooters was {{sponsoring}} a car driven by Mark Stahl, another owner-driver in the Cup series. Unlike Kulwicki, Stahl was a part-time participant who had <b>trouble</b> <b>making</b> races. The Hooters car {{failed to make}} the field for the Motorcraft Quality Parts 500 and the Atlanta-based chain, desiring a spot in the race, approached the sponsorless Kulwicki to gauge his interest. The principals agreed to at least a one-race deal, which became a much longer term deal when Kulwicki recorded an eighth-place finish in the race. Later in the season, Kulwicki won the Bristol night race for his third career win. In 29races, he had eleven top10 finishes, fourpoles, and finished 13th in the points.|$|E
5|$|John Palliser {{crossed the}} Rockies through a pass in 1858 {{that led to}} the {{headwaters}} of the Palliser River, a tributary of the Kootenay River now named in his honor. (However, at first, his party referred to it as Palliser's River.) His expedition made it downstream to Columbia Lake, but had some <b>trouble</b> <b>making</b> their way back to Alberta; the return route that they had chosen proved too dangerous to negotiate. After trading for some horses and new supplies from a band of Ktunaxa, they made it back over the Rockies later that year through North Kootenay Pass near Lower and Upper Kananaskis Lakes, after traveling up the Elk River.|$|E

5|$|When Macdonald {{returned}} to Nova Scotia in 1945, {{he was only}} 55, but the silver-haired politician now seemed 20years older. After the retirement of Premier A. S. MacMillan, the Liberals reaffirmed Macdonald's leadership at their convention on August 31, 1945. Less than two months later, Macdonald's Liberals swept the province wiping out the Conservatives {{for the first time}} since Confederation and winning all but two Cape Breton ridings where voters elected members of the Co-operative Commonwealth Federation or CCF, the forerunner of the present-day New Democratic Party, or NDP. In spite of his huge victory, a close colleague noted that Macdonald was not the same man he had been before he left Nova Scotia in 1940. He had <b>trouble</b> <b>making</b> decisions, not because he was a procrastinator, but because he was not well.|$|E
5|$|Becky tells Steve {{that she}} is {{pregnant}} and he later discovers that Becky has already told Claire and Steve tells his mother, Liz. Unfortunately Becky miscarries twice, although she was unaware of her 2nd pregnancy, and medical tests reveal an abnormality of the womb, meaning she is unable to carry a child full-term, making Becky decide {{that she wants to}} adopt. During the process, Steve needs a reference from Amy's mother, Tracy Barlow (Kate Ford), who promptly uses it to cause <b>trouble,</b> <b>making</b> Becky threaten, in return, that Tracy will never see Amy again. Unfortunately Becky and Steve are refused the right to adopt because her estranged half-sister Kylie gave a bad reference and the fact that Social Services feel that it is too soon after her miscarriages. She confronts Kylie, but the sisters eventually reconcile and Becky helps Kylie reclaim custody of her son, Max. Becky becomes very attached to Max, whilst Kylie becomes more irresponsible. Kylie announces plans to move to Cyprus with her new boyfriend and Becky begs her to reconsider, so Kylie offers to sell Max to her and Steve for £20,000, which they agree to. On the night of the tram crash, Kylie returns and demands more money, so Becky steals £5,000 from the ruins of Dev Alahan's (Jimmi Harkishin) corner shop, to pay Kylie off. Tracy is released from prison and the two start feuding again, particularly after Tracy discovers Max's sale and agrees to keep quiet in exchange for Amy.

Otto knew that Bep had <b>troubles</b> <b>making</b> ends meet and {{did his best to}} help her, too. He occasionally lent money to her. Bep Voskuijl - van Wijk died in Amsterdam on 6 May 1983, due to a kidney disease. She was 63 years old.|$|R
25|$|In May 1814 Birney {{returned}} to his hometown and took up {{the practice of law}} there, becoming the acting attorney for the local bank. He handled both civil and criminal lawsuits in Danville and other outlying counties of Kentucky.

Having <b>trouble</b> <b>making</b> ends meet, Birney made his living at this time primarily as a claims adjuster.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} stages of the 2010s, several {{governmental}} analysts observed that commercial networks were having <b>trouble</b> <b>making</b> the transition to digital television and subsequently, a $250m rebate was implemented on their licensing fees. The government funded stations, ABC and SBS, received increased funding in the closing stages of the 2000s to enable them to make the transition to digital TV. Meanwhile, the community station C31 received no government assistance or funding to make the transition; this still remains a source of controversy.|$|E

Gavin quit school after eighth grade and became a full-time clerk at a shoe store for $12.50 a week. His next stint was as a manager for Jewel Oil Company. A combination of restlessness and limited future opportunities in his hometown caused Gavin {{to run away from}} home. In March 1924, on his 17th birthday, he took the night train to New York. The first thing he did upon arriving was to send a telegram to his parents saying everything was all right to prevent them from reporting him missing to the police. After that, he started looking for a job.|$|E

Naftogaz CEO Vladimir Trykolych said that Naftogaz owed $1.26–1.27billion to RosUkrEnergo in total, but claimed that Naftogaz had no debt to Gazprom. However, on December 2, Naftogaz {{acknowledged that it}} owed $1billion to Gazprom, {{and said it was}} having <b>trouble</b> <b>making</b> payments on time due to unexpected losses in 2008. Later in mid-December, Gazprom stated that a debt of $2.195billion had accumulated. In response, Naftogaz made a payment of $800million, and promised to pay another $200million soon. Gazprom proposed to make an upfront transit payment at the 2008 rate in order to provide funds for the debt to be cleared, but Naftogaz rejected the offer.|$|E
25|$|During the Meiji period, the samurai {{class was}} {{gradually}} disbanded, {{and the special}} privileges granted to them were taken away, {{including the right to}} carry swords in public. The Haitōrei Edict in 1876 forbade the carrying of swords in public except for certain individuals, such as former samurai lords (daimyō), the military, and the police. Skilled swordsmiths had <b>trouble</b> <b>making</b> a living during this period as Japan modernized its military, and many swordsmiths started making other items, such as farm equipment, tools, and cutlery. Military action by Japan in China and Russia during the Meiji period helped revive interest in swords, {{but it was not until}} the Shōwa period that swords were produced on a large scale again. Japanese military swords produced between 1875 and 1945 are referred to as guntō (military swords).|$|E
25|$|Starting in 2011, {{medallion}} prices dropped considerably likely due {{to competition}} from ride-share services. , medallion prices had dropped to around $500,000 in value, with one medallion dropping to $250,000. There was also a decrease in taxi usage: in November 2016, there were 336,737 daily trips that netted $4.98 million, a decrease from the 463,701 daily trips netting $5.17 million in November 2010. However, in mid-2016, after a five-year decline, taxi usage began to increase again. Due to this competition, medallion owners sued the city and Uber in November 2015. By 2017, the 60,000 ride share vehicles in New York City outnumbered the city's medallion vehicles {{at a ratio of}} almost 4 to 1, and many medallion owners faced the prospect of bankruptcy or severe debt because of the low medallion prices, which few entities were willing to buy. Medallion holders had <b>trouble</b> <b>making</b> payments on the loans that they borrowed to pay for the medallions.|$|E
50|$|Smith {{returned}} in 1989, and {{although in the}} matches {{in the first half}} of the season in which Smith was present, Glamorgan courageously played out several draws in games in which other teams looked strong, the second half of the season was poor, the form on the big occasion deserting the squad. However 1989 was also the season in which Smith hit his first-class best, an innings of 116 against Kent. 1990 was much more positive, with Smith getting back into the rhythm of the first-class game after his <b>troubles,</b> <b>making</b> the season's first showing in the second match of the season, in which Jimmy Cook made what was, at the time, Somerset's second-highest single-innings total by a player.|$|R

25|$|Lewis led {{a strong}} {{campaign}} during the 1975 election with his oratory and passion bringing new supporters to the party. The NDP highlighted {{issues such as}} rent control and workplace safety. Each day, Lewis {{told the story of}} a different Ontarian in <b>trouble,</b> <b>making</b> a case that this was {{because of the lack of}} adequate legislation. Polls showed the NDP surging and the incumbent Ontario Progressive Conservative Party in freefall and in the course of the campaign Premier William Davis was forced to commit his party to bringing in rent control and other progressive reforms in order to retain power. When the ballots were counted the Tories were reduced to a minority government. Lewis' NDP had doubled its seats from 19 to 38, surpassing the Ontario Liberal Party to become the Official Opposition. To some it appeared that it was only a matter of time before the NDP would form the government.|$|E

As the group is unable to find the mastermind behind the competition, the Investigation Team decides to search for him. He fights using Izanagi, though during its strongest attack it transforms in Izanagi-no-Okami. His moveset was balanced for the sequel to make him more versatile as a result of comments regarding his character being too strong in the first game. The author behind Arenas manga, Aiyakyuu, said that Yu was his favorite character and that whenever he draws him he thinks [...] "Yu is so cool!"

500|$|In an {{interview}} with The Office fansite [...] "OfficeTally", Celotta said she and Lieberstein had only about one weekend to finish the script and distribute it to the actors, so there was little discussion about their individual volleyball abilities. Once the scripts were circulated, the writers learned that Jenna Fischer was {{not very good at}} volleyball and had <b>trouble</b> <b>making</b> certain motions with her arm over her head due to a previous injury. As a result, director Ken Kwapis arranged for stunt doubles to perform some of the volleyball moves; a handful of scenes were also shot with Pam doing an overhead motion with the ball being added later using computer-generated imagery. The opening credits were trimmed down to ten seconds and no post-credits scene was used {{in order to keep the}} episode within the network-mandated 21 minutes and 35 seconds. The producers considered making the episode an hour long like other season finales from past seasons, like [...] "The Job" [...] and [...] "Goodbye, Toby", but they found they did not have enough plot points to conclude in [...] "Company Picnic" [...] and would have had trouble filling a full hour.|$|E

Love's mother, who was studying to be a psychologist, had her in therapy by the age of two. In 1970, her mother moved the family to the rural community of Marcola, Oregon, where they lived along the Mohawk River, while her mother completed her degree at the University of Oregon. She described her parents' household as being full of [...] "hairy, wangly-ass hippies running around naked [...] Gestalt therapy. My mom was also adamant about a gender-free household: no dresses, no patent leather shoes, no canopy beds, nothing." [...] Love was adopted by her then-stepfather, Frank Rodriguez. He and her mother had two daughters and a son who died in infancy of a heart defect when Love was ten. They also adopted a boy. [...] Love attended a Montessori school in Eugene, where she struggled academically and had <b>trouble</b> <b>making</b> friends. At age nine, a psychologist noted that she exhibited signs of autism.|$|E
500|$|Mathijs {{states that}} cult films and fandom {{frequently}} involve nontraditional elements {{of time and}} time management. [...] Fans will often watch films obsessively, an activity that is viewed by the mainstream as wasting time yet {{can be seen as}} resisting the commodification of leisure time. [...] They may also watch films idiosyncratically: sped up, slowed down, frequently paused, or at odd hours. [...] Cult films themselves subvert traditional views of time – time travel, non-linear narratives, and ambiguous establishments of time are all popular. [...] Mathijs also identifies specific cult film viewing habits, such as viewing horror films on Halloween, sentimental melodrama on Christmas, and romantic films on Valentine's Day. [...] These films are often viewed as marathons where fans can gorge themselves on their favorites. [...] Mathijs states that cult films broadcast on Christmas have a nostalgic factor. [...] These films, ritually watched every season, give a sense of community and shared nostalgia to viewers. [...] New films often have <b>trouble</b> <b>making</b> inroads against the institutions of It's A Wonderful Life (1946) and Miracle on 34th Street (1947). [...] These films provide mild criticism of consumerism while encouraging family values. [...] Halloween, on the other hand, allows flaunting society's taboos and testing one's fears. [...] Horror films have appropriated the holiday, and many horror films debut on Halloween. [...] Mathijs criticizes the over-cultified, commercialized nature of Halloween and horror films, which feed into each other so much that Halloween has turned into an image or product with no real community. [...] Mathijs states that Halloween horror conventions can provide the missing community aspect.|$|E
