By the end of the 1960s, a number of small magazines dedicated to the hobby were springing up, along with new game companies. Many of these were not available in any store, being spread by 'word of mouth' and advertisements in other magazines.|$|E

In this <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>situation,</b> Borel, who was known as a quiet and taciturn boy who kept to himself and rather tend the chickens in the backyard during his free time than to go out, grew up and developed an increasing admiration for the military, telling lies about heroic deeds of his father during the Indochina War and adoring his stepbrother Franck Bichet, who served in the army. He had an affection for weapons and used to shoot sparrows with an air gun.|$|E
2500|$|Errors by Nicholas II in {{managing}} the Russian government also led to his misinterpreting the <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>situation</b> in which Russia was to become involved with Japan. Some scholars have suggested that Tsar Nicholas II dragged Japan into war intentionally, in hopes of reviving Russian nationalism. This notion is disputed by a comment made by Nicholas to Kaiser Wilhelm of Germany, saying {{there would be no}} war because he [...] "did not wish it".|$|E

[...] While not specifying whether Naruto or another important character will die, Kishimoto commented he finds this <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>situation</b> interesting due to the impact it could probably happen in the scenario and most notably Boruto, clarifying it would give the authors more freedom.|$|E

We want peace, security, and economic welfare, and we cannot forgo all of our other rights for nuclear energy. The government claims it is not making a bomb.

If the Iranian people are able to topple the government, this could improve the situation. [...] the people of Iran rose up and were badly suppressed. Right now, Iran is the country with the most journalists in prison. This is the price people are paying." ...|$|E

Those are the explosives littering the minefield that is life in society." [...] Heinze is stunned that the show is able to pack so much original comedy into twenty-two minutes of airtime, and he has little sympathy for people who dismiss the show as being shallow or neurotically self-focused: [...] "People with little sense of humor have failed, time and again, to understand that the notorious self-centeredness of the show’s characters enables us to laugh at the selfish, neurotic traits we all share but prefer to disguise." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Oxfordshire inquest resumed as {{scheduled}} on 12 March with testimony from a British Forward Air Controller (FAC) {{involved in the}} incident, who stated that the incident wouldn't have happened if the two U.S. pilots involved had followed the same procedures that UK pilots must follow in the same <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>situation.</b> On 13 March, the same British FAC testified that POPOV36 committed a [...] "catalogue of serious failures" [...] when he shot at the British vehicles in the incident, including [...] "ignoring crucial warning signs, attacking without permission, and failing to wait for an artillery shell marker on a proposed target." [...] After the inquest revealed that portions of relevant evidence from the U.S. investigation into the incident were blacked out in the copy of the report given to the inquest, Matty Hull's widow made a personal appeal to U.S. president George W.

40|$|The causal {{structures}} for each <b>of</b> four <b>types</b> <b>of</b> situations-interpersonal failure, noninterpersonal failure, interpersonal success, and noninterpersonal success-were explored and compared. A {{first group of}} subjects generated plausible causes for five specific <b>situations</b> in each <b>of</b> the four general <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>situations.</b> A second group of subjects provided similarity data on these causes, which were used in a cluster analysis of the causes. A third group of subjects rated the generated causes on each of six dimensions reported in the attribution literature: changeability, locus, stability, intentionality, globality, and controllability. Analyses of the clusters of causes and the ratings revealed (a) different <b>types</b> <b>of</b> causes were generated for different <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>situations,</b> (b) different <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>situations</b> led people to generate causes that differ in dimensional location, (c) the various causal dimensions were highly intercorrelated. These findings were applied to A. W. Kruglanski’s (Psychological Review, 1980,tV) model of attribution processes. In addition, implications for the study <b>of</b> interpersonal <b>situations</b> and for the cognition-motivation debate over “self-serving ” bias in attribution were discussed. Finally, several methodological issues were examined. Making attributions for experienced or observed events is a basic cognitive process. When faced with important, unusual, or unexpected events we search for meaningful explanations of their causes (Heider...|$|R

30|$|Concerning {{communication}} strategies, the found factors {{make sense}} regarding the situation types. It seems that communication is different whether one is confronted with strong sadness {{that one has}} no time to take care of, with bad diagnosis, with distributional conflicts, with anger or even with mobbing. This fits assumptions {{that are used in}} popular trainings on social competences, as for example from Hinsch and Pfingsten (2007), where three prototypical <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>situations</b> are used (to assert one’s right, to maintain relationships, to bid for sympathy).
