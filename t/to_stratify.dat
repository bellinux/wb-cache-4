40|$|Background Antibodies <b>to</b> <b>stratified</b> epithelia {{characterize}} chronic ulcerative stomatitis, {{an entity}} that very closely resembles erosive lichen planus both clinically and histologically. These antibodies are directed against a 70 -kd antigen. Objective Our {{aim was to}} verify whether antibodies <b>to</b> <b>stratified</b> epithelia are present in patients with common lichen planus. Patients and methods One hundred thirty-eight patients with various forms of lichen planus were studied. Indirect immunofluorescence was performed on both monkey esophagus and HEp 2 - 2000 cells. Immunoblotting was done with cultured keratinocytes used as the source antigen. Results Nineteen patients had antibodies <b>to</b> <b>stratified</b> epithelia (in 9 directed against an antigen of 70 kd). Forty-eight patients had circulating antibodies detected by indirect immunofluorescence on both monkey esophagus and HEp 2 - 2000 cells (in 7 directed against an antigen of 70 kd). Indirect immunofluorescence was positive only on HEp 2 - 2000 cells in 21 patients. Indirect immunofluorescence was negative in 50 patients on both HEp 2 - 2000 cells and monkey esophagus. None of the last 71 patients had antibodies directed to an antigen of 70 kd. Limitations This is a serological study; results from direct immunofluorescence studies would be interesting. Conclusion Antibodies <b>to</b> <b>stratified</b> epithelia directed <b>to</b> an antigen of 70 kd are not exclusive to chronic ulcerative stomatitis, but are also present in some patients with lichen planus...|$|R
25|$|Stratification, {{also called}} moist-chilling, breaks down {{physiological}} dormancy, and involves {{the addition of}} moisture to the seeds so they absorb water, and they are then subjected to a period of moist chilling to after-ripen the embryo. Sowing in late summer and fall and allowing to overwinter under cool conditions is an effective way <b>to</b> <b>stratify</b> seeds; some seeds respond more favorably to periods of oscillating temperatures which {{are a part of}} the natural environment.|$|E
25|$|From 1920, Sanielevici was an {{isolated}} {{figure on the}} left, editing {{a new version of}} Curentul Nou and only affiliating with the popular daily Adevărul. He moved away from literary theory and, following his anthropological speculations, revived Lamarckism and scientific racism to formulate his own racial-sociological system. Himself a Jewish Romanian, Sanielevici attempted to undermine the racial assumptions of Nazi ideologists and local fascists, but his own interpretations of natural history were universally ridiculed. Sanielevici placed human nutrition and mastication at the core of racial distinctions, and went on <b>to</b> <b>stratify</b> artistic temperaments into racial clusters.|$|E

40|$|Density {{stratification}} {{is one of}} {{the essential}} underlying physical mechanisms for atmospheric and oceanic flow. As a first step to investigating the mechanisms of stratified turbulence, linear stability plays a critical role in determining under what conditions a flow remains stable or unstable. In the study of transition <b>to</b> <b>stratified</b> turbulence, a common vortex model, known as the Lamb-Chaplygin dipole, is used to investigate the conditions under which <b>stratified</b> flow transitions <b>to</b> turbulence. Numerous investigations have determined that a critical length scale, known as the buoyancy length, {{plays a key role in}} the breakdown and transition <b>to</b> <b>stratified</b> turbulence. At this buoyancy length scale, an instability unique <b>to</b> <b>stratified</b> flow, the zigzag instability, emerges. However investigations into sub-buoyancy length scales have remained unexplored. In this thesis we discover and investigate a new instability of the Lamb-Chaplyin dipole that exists at the sub-buoyancy scale. Through numerical linear stability analysis we show that this short-wave instability exhibits growth rates similar to that of the zigzag instability. We conclude with nonlinear studies of this short-wave instability and demonstrate this new instability saturates at a level proportional to the cube of the aspect ratio...|$|R

[...] Excavations were carried out at Icehouse Bottom in 1969, 1970, 1971, and 1977.
