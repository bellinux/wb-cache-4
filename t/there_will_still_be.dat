25|$|Georgescu {{argues that}} Daly's {{steady-state}} economy will provide no ecological salvation for mankind, especially {{not in the}} longer run. Due to the geologic fact that mineral ores are deposited and concentrated very unevenly in the crust of the Earth, exploration and extraction of mineral resources will sooner or later be faced with the principle of diminishing returns, whereby extraction activities are pushed to still less accessible sites and still lower grades of ores. In the course of time, then, extraction costs and market prices of the incremental amount of resources will tend to increase. Eventually, all minerals will be exhausted, but the economic exhaustion will manifest itself long before the physical exhaustion provides the ultimate backstop for further activity: <b>There</b> <b>will</b> <b>still</b> <b>be</b> deposits of resources left in the crust, but the geologic concentration of these deposits will remain below the critical cutoff grade; hence, continued extraction will no longer pay off, and the market for these resources will then collapse. This long-term dynamics works itself through any economic (sub-)system, regardless of the system's geographical location, its size and its state of development (whether a progressive, a steady or a declining state). In effect, the arguments advanced by Daly {{in support of his}} steady-state economy apply with even greater force in support of a declining-state economy, Georgescu points out: When the overall purpose is to ration and stretch mineral resource use for as long time into the future as possible, zero economic growth is more desirable than growth is, true; but negative growth is better still! In this context, Georgescu also criticises Daly for not specifying at what levels man-made capital and human population are to be kept constant in the steady-state.|$|E

500|$|While Retro Studios {{tried to}} create [...] "the {{ultimate}} first-person experience" [...] with the Metroid Prime series, Sakamoto's approach with gameplay was different, particularly for the story Other M intended to tell. When Sakamoto met Team Ninja, he said his intent was a game with [...] "controls as simple as those of a NES game", so it would appeal to modern players. Team Ninja agreed with that approach, as they felt control schemes with excessive buttons were possibly turning players off the action genre, {{and tried to make}} the game employ only the Wii Remote, without resorting to the Nunchuk expansion. The development team also tried to use the simpler controls to provide flashy action, with varied special attacks that would need few button inputs to be executed. Sakamoto focused on 2D-like gameplay because he considered it more [...] "comfortable" [...] for audiences, particularly during shifts from gameplay to cutscenes, as he thought 2D [...] " [...] have the same distractions when you want to give them story sequences". While the developers felt no need to integrate everything from the Prime series as they were games with different concepts, a few of the elements that [...] "made those games unique" [...] were implemented into Other M, such as the [...] "immersive sight" [...] of the first-person mode. When questioned if Other M would be too similar to Ninja Gaiden, Hayashi responded that while the new game will feature heavy action-based sequences, <b>there</b> <b>will</b> <b>still</b> <b>be</b> the exploration-based sequences characteristic of other Metroid games. Sakamoto said that Other Ms story progression was {{in the same manner as}} Metroid Fusion, and stated that the collaboration between Nintendo and Team Ninja is [...] "unlike anything that's ever been done at Nintendo; it's more than just a collaborative effort — it's one group working toward a common goal".|$|E

2500|$|Some organisations {{have decided}} to hold outdoor demonstrations in Batam, Indonesia instead, to {{circumvent}} the ban in Singapore. About 1,000 delegates were planning to protest there for a week with a final outdoor demonstration on 18 September. The Indonesian laws state that {{they were allowed to}} protest on the streets, if they informed the authorities three days beforehand. The authorities were reportedly lukewarm towards their proposed demonstrations and forum.

On 6 September, the Batam police had {{sent a letter to the}} organisers that both their demonstration and forum would be banned. The police cited economic, political and security reasons for the ban, adding that other NGOs were not in favour of such protests.

At first, the child, in the cradle, will be allowed to enjoy munuscula, or little gifts. Importantly, the boy will grow skilled in reading, learning of the deeds of both heroes and his father. At this point in his life, the Golden Age will not have arrived in full; <b>there</b> <b>will</b> <b>still</b> <b>be</b> both sailing and walled towns, and thus, still war. Jenny Strauss Clay noted that the poem implies that the whole Heroic Age will have to be replayed; a new band of Argonauts will travel the seas, and a new Trojan War will occur. Given time, the need for sailing will dissipate. Then, the ground will grow more fertile: grapes will grow from brambles, oak trees will produce honey, corn will emerge from the ground by itself, poisonous plants and animals will disappear, and useful animals will be improved.

40|$|The stocker cattle {{business}} {{has been one of}} the growth areas of beef production in the Southeast during the last several decades. The ample supply of lightweight calves in need of a little management, coupled with the ability of the stocker operator to manage on economic margins makes it in many cases a better business model than traditional cow/calf production. Many cow-calf operators have also added stocker programs to their businesses. Some simply wean their calves and grow them to a heavier weight, but some also add additional purchased cattle to improve their ability to capture tractor-trailer load lot premiums as they market their calves. Recent changes in fuel, feed, and fertilizer prices have dramatically impacted the cattle industry, but margins in stocker cattle can remain positive if producers manage their calf purchase and feed costs carefully. Historically we have used a value of gain of about $ 0. 50 per lb on growing cattle, but with recent changes in calf pricing, gain is worth much more than that. For example, cattle at Lynchburg, VA on July 27, 2008 showed no price slide between 4 cwt and 6 cwt cattle, and when you compare those prices with the VA board sales those light cattle prices are similar to the heavier cattle, which would suggest gains in the new environment may be worth as much as $ 1. 00 per lb (and that is what feedlot cost of gain is now). These conditions will be hard on cow-calf producers whom undoubtedly will see lower prices for weaned calves, but <b>there</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> <b>still</b> <b>be</b> ample opportunities for producers to profitably grow those cattle to heavier weights...|$|R
