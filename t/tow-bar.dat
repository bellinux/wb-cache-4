2500|$|In {{addition}} to the wrecking body, all trucks had a [...] front winch and a rear pintle hitch. Not intended to carry a load, the M1 could support [...] while towing up to [...] The -A1 upgrade also had a rear winch, heavier bumpers, and a large front <b>tow-bar,</b> allowing the truck to recover and move light armored vehicles.|$|E
50|$|Bofors also {{developed}} a towable carriage which they displayed in April 1935 at a show in Belgium. This mount allowed the gun to be fired from the carriage with no setup required, although with limited accuracy. If time was available for setup, the gunners used the <b>tow-bar</b> and muzzle lock as levers, raising the wheels {{off the ground and}} thereby lowering the gun onto supporting pads. Two additional legs folded out to the sides, and the platform was then leveled with hand cranks. The entire setup process could be completed in under a minute.|$|E
50|$|Pushback tugs {{are mostly}} used to push an {{aircraft}} {{away from the}} gate when it is ready to leave. These tugs are very powerful {{and because of the}} large engines, are sometimes referred to as an engine with wheels. Pushback tugs {{can also be used to}} pull aircraft in various situations, such as to a hangar. Different size tugs are required for different size aircraft. Some tugs use a <b>tow-bar</b> as a connection between the tug and the aircraft, while other tugs lift the nose gear off the ground to make it easier to tow or push. Recently there has been a push for towbarless tractors as larger airplanes are designed.|$|E
5000|$|The Diesel/hydraulic powered [...] "work tractors" [...] are {{primarily}} used each morning for beam inspection and maintenance-of-way which includes trimming vegetation {{beyond the reach}} of guests, cleaning and repairing the electrical commutator rails as well as periodically scheduled servicing and painting of the concrete beam guideway. They are powerful enough to return a fully loaded train fitted with <b>tow-bars</b> to a station platform, then to the Monorail Shop, independent of 600V track power.|$|R
50|$|Thule {{was founded}} in 1942 by the Thulin family in Hillerstorp, {{southern}} Sweden. The company grew steadily, especially in the 1960s when Thule specialized in roof racks and other automobile accessories facilitating for the car owner to bring their outdoor equipment and luggage with them. In 1979, Thule was sold to Eldon, a company listed on the Stockholm Stock Exchange, which continued to develop the company. In 1999 Eldon was acquired by the private equity firm EQT and delisted. Thule was then sold to the UK-based private equity firm Candover in 2004, which embarked on significant M&A activity, growing the turnover more than three times, adding new product lines such as <b>tow-bars,</b> car-trailers, snow-chains, RV products and bags for electronic devices.|$|R
2500|$|The wrecker had a Holmes twin-boom {{design with}} a {{swinging}} boom and powered hoist cable on each side. When towing the booms were rotated to the rear, connected at the ends, {{and worked as}} one A-frame. When lifting the booms could be separated and rotated 90% forward to the side, an outrigger could be lowered to increase lifting capacity. A power take-off on the transfer case drove a transmission with two winches in the wrecker frame. Controls {{on both sides of}} the body allowed each winch to raise or lower independently of the other. The body had low sides on the rear half which tapered to the floor in the front, making clearance for the boom to swing. A brace for the wrecker frame held a spare tire. Welding tanks, an air compressor, cables, block and tackle, chains, <b>tow-bars,</b> and other equipment were carried.|$|R
5000|$|There were plans, not {{put into}} practice, {{to use the}} Arado Ar 234 jet bomber to launch V-1s either by towing them aloft or by {{launching}} them from a [...] "piggy back" [...] position (in {{the manner of the}} Mistel, but in reverse) atop the aircraft. In the latter configuration, a pilot-controlled, hydraulically operated dorsal trapeze mechanism would elevate the missile on the trapeze's launch cradle some eight feet clear of the 234's upper fuselage. This was necessary to avoid damaging the mother craft's fuselage and tail surfaces when the pulsejet ignited, as well as to ensure a [...] "clean" [...] airflow for the Argus motor's intake. A somewhat less ambitious project undertaken was the adaptation of the missile as a [...] "flying fuel tank" [...] (Deichselschlepp) for the Messerschmitt Me 262 jet fighter, which was initially test-towed behind an He 177A Greif bomber. The pulsejet, internal systems and warhead of the missile were removed, leaving only the wings and basic fuselage, now containing a single large fuel tank. A small cylindrical module, similar in shape to a finless dart, was placed atop the vertical stabilizer {{at the rear of the}} tank, acting as a centre of gravity balance and attachment point for a variety of equipment sets. A rigid <b>tow-bar</b> with a pitch pivot at the forward end connected the flying tank to the Me 262. The operational procedure for this unusual configuration saw the tank resting on a wheeled trolley for take-off. The trolley was dropped once the combination was airborne, and explosive bolts separated the towbar from the fighter upon exhaustion of the tank's fuel supply. A number of test flights were conducted in 1944 with this set-up, but inflight [...] "porpoising" [...] of the tank, with the instability transferred to the fighter, meant the system was too unreliable to be used. An identical utilisation of the V-1 flying tank for the Ar 234 bomber was also investigated, with the same conclusions reached. Some of the [...] "flying fuel tanks" [...] used in trials utilised a cumbersome fixed and spatted undercarriage arrangement, which (along with being pointless) merely increased the drag and stability problems already inherent in the design.|$|E
