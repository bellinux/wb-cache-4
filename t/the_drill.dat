This study included two projects conducted on <b>the</b> <b>drills</b> at Parken Zoo in Eskilstuna where I investigated: 1) the effect of visual barriers on the behaviour of <b>the</b> <b>drills</b> and if <b>the</b> visual barriers can moderate the visitor effect on <b>the</b> <b>drills</b> and 2) how outdoor-only access together with feeding enrichment (frozen fruit and tube feeders) affects the behaviour of <b>the</b> <b>drills.</b> 1 / 0 - sampling method was used when observing the behaviours of <b>the</b> <b>drills</b> with 1 minute-intervals. Resting/Sleeping increased, while social agonistic behaviour and stereotypies decreased with visual barriers. A moderated visitor effect was shown in resting/sleeping and social affiliative behaviour in <b>the</b> <b>drills</b> with visual barriers. However, social agonistic behaviour and visitor interaction were still affected by visitors after {{the installation of the}} visual barriers, implying that <b>the</b> <b>drills</b> still find visitors stressful to some extent and that further alterations on the observation area viewing the indoor enclosure is recommended for the welfare of <b>the</b> <b>drills.</b> With outdoor-only access together with feeding enrichment, locomotion, foraging/eating and body-shaking increased, while resting/sleeping, social affiliative and agonistic behaviour, stereotypies, visitor interaction, scratching and self-grooming decreased. This suggests that outdoor-only access and feeding enrichment improve the behaviour of <b>the</b> <b>drills</b> and would be a valid option during summer season for <b>the</b> <b>drills</b> at Parken Zoo. ...|$|R

40|$|This {{article is}} {{intended}} to present a multibody dynamic model of <b>the</b> <b>drilling</b> system, consisting of drillstring and <b>drilling</b> fluid. <b>The</b> drillstring is a complex rigid–flexible coupling system, including rigid bodies, Euler–Bernoulli beam elements, constraints and dynamic loads, and its dynamic model is established using the absolute nodal coordinate formulation. <b>The</b> <b>drilling</b> fluid, composed of internal, annulus, and under-bit fluids, is modeled as one-dimensional compressible fluid; the relative flow of <b>the</b> <b>drilling</b> fluid is modeled using the Arbitrary Lagrangian–Eulerian description; {{the force of the}} drillstring acting on <b>the</b> <b>drilling</b> fluid is introduced through <b>the</b> <b>drilling</b> fluid transport motion; meanwhile, the reaction force acting on the drillstring is taken as an external load. The contact between <b>the</b> drillstring and <b>drilling</b> fluid is simulated based on Hertz contact theory, and the rock penetration model is built based on the rock-breaking velocity equation.

Information from <b>the</b> <b>drilling</b> monitoring can be added to the existing geological information for more accurate identification of the rock discontinuities and weathered degrees of soils and rocks, because a larger number of drilled holes from rotary-percussive drilling can be used. In this paper, two sets of DPM data from two adjacent holes are examined. The two holes were drilled with two different rotary-percussive drills in soil nailing construction. Based on the monitored data, the interaction of <b>the</b> most important <b>drilling</b> parameters is assessed.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{generally}} {{about how the}} mechanical system reacts when a load is given or friction is happen to touch the mechanical system. Every mechanical system will always be affected {{when there is a}} disturbance. Drilling operation is one of the common operations in the industry. When <b>the</b> <b>drilling</b> operation works, there must be a friction occurs when the work is done. Thus, there will be lack of performance for <b>the</b> <b>drilling</b> machine. <b>The</b> lack of the performance of <b>the</b> <b>drilling</b> machine will lead to the speed of the machine that will decrease slightly. That is the main part of this project. To make the performance of <b>the</b> <b>drilling</b> machine maintain, <b>the</b> speed must be increase as soon the friction is given to <b>the</b> <b>drilling</b> machine. To solve the problem, the Fuzzy Logic Method is use in this project. Using Fuzzy Logic Method, new equation will be finding and use it for this project.

5|$|The cult of Thor {{was linked}} up with men's {{habitation}} and possessions, and with {{well-being of the}} family and community. This included the fruitfulness of the fields, and Thor, although pictured primarily as a storm god in the myths, was also concerned with the fertility and preservation of the seasonal round. In our own times, little stone axes from the distant past have been used as fertility symbols and placed by the farmer in the holes made by <b>the</b> <b>drill</b> to receive the first seed of spring. Thor's marriage with Sif of the golden hair, about which we hear little in the myths, seems to be a memory of the ancient symbol of divine marriage between sky god and earth goddess, when he comes to earth in the thunderstorm and the storm brings the rain which makes the fields fertile. In this way Thor, as well as Odin, may be seen to continue the cult of the sky god which was known in the Bronze Age.|$|E

The rock’s fracture mechanism during different stages of the percussive mechanism is analyzed to create a load forecasting model for the cutting and percussive fracturing of rock using an elemental blade. Finally, a model of the load on the LRCB is obtained from the analytic equation for the bit’s cutting blade distribution; experimental verification of the rotary-impact load characteristics for lunar rock simulant with different parameters is performed. The results show that the penetrations per revolution (PPR) are the primary parameter influencing <b>the</b> <b>drilling</b> load.
