An example is {{an encounter with}} guerrillas in the Kandeya Tribal Trust Lands, north of Mount Darwin, on 19 July 1975. On that day a Territorial Force (TF) unit engaged a group of cadres near a river and killed two without suffering casualties. The nationalist fighters retreated into a defensive ambush position on the banks, beneath the roots of some overhanging trees. The Territorials then summoned a Fireforce made up of 7 and 10 Troops, 2 Commando from Mount Darwin, and on arrival made a sweep of the river line, accompanied by 10 Troop. When the Rhodesians rounded {{a bend in the}} stream the concealed insurgents opened fire, immediately killing a Territorial sergeant and RLI Rifleman Hennie Potgieter. Rifleman Ken Lucas, an FN MAG gunner, suffered a wound to his leg. After the initial burst of fire, the insurgents remained behind their cover and waited, concealed from security force eyes. Judging from the silence and inactivity that the guerrillas had fled, and thinking that the two downed men were still alive, Major Hank Meyer told Lieutenant Joe du Plooy to sweep around the river with two 7 Troop sticks and send a medic out to give treatment.|$|E

Association studies independent of causal theories, along with multiple testing errors, too often drive health care and public policy decisions. In an era of large-scale biological research, we ask questions about the role of statistical analyses in advancing coherent theories of diseases and their mechanisms. We advocate for reinterpretation of the scientific method in the context of large-scale data analysis opportunities and for renewed appreciation of falsifiable hypotheses, so that we can learn more from our best mistakes...|$|R

5000|$|Most {{frequently}} used nonlinear estimators of connectivity are: mutual information, transfer entropy, generalised synchronisation, continuity measure, synchronization likelihood, phase synchronization. First {{two of them}} rely on construction of histograms for estimation of probabilities.

Among these measures only transfer entropy allows for the determination of directionality.

The comparison of nonlinear methods with linear correlation in the presence of noise revealed the poorer performance of non-linear estimators.

40|$|International audienceData from volcano-monitoring studies {{constitute}} the only scientifically valid basis for short-term forecasts {{of a future}} eruption, or of possible changes during an ongoing eruption. Thus, in any effective hazards-mitigation program, a basic strategy in reducing volcano risk is the initiation or augmentation of volcano monitoring at historically active volcanoes and also at geologically young, but presently dormant, volcanoes with potential for reactivation. Beginning with the 1980 s, substantial progress in volcano-monitoring techniques and networks ? ground-based as well space-based ? has been achieved. Although some geochemical monitoring techniques (e. g., remote measurement of volcanic gas emissions) are being increasingly applied and show considerable promise, seismic and geodetic methods to date remain the techniques of choice and are the most widely used. Availability of comprehensive volcano-monitoring data was a decisive factor in the successful scientific and governmental responses to the reawakening of Mount St. elens (Washington, USA) in 1980 and, more recently, to the powerful explosive eruptions at Mount Pinatubo (Luzon, Philippines) in 1991. However, even with the ever-improving state-of-the-art in volcano monitoring and predictive capability, the Mount St. Helens and Pinatubo case histories unfortunately still represent <b>the</b> <b>exceptions,</b> <b>rather</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> rule, in successfully forecasting the most likely outcome of volcano unrest...|$|R
25|$|This can be {{the case}} when {{multiple}} genes act in parallel {{to achieve the same}} effect.

However, there inevitably comes a point where phosphorus is no longer the limiting factor for growth and reproduction and so further improvements in phosphorus metabolism have smaller or no effect (negative epistasis). Some sets of mutations within genes have also been specifically found to be additive.

Efforts to plan for sea-level rise can be thwarted by several institutional biases, including government policies that encourage coastal development, flood insurance maps that do not consider sea-level rise, federal policies that prefer shoreline armoring over soft shore protection, and lack of plans delineating which areas would be protected or not as sea level rises.|$|E

40|$|This {{paper is}} a {{preliminary}} {{discussion of the}} material aspects of globalisation {{in terms of the}} effects on older men and women of movements of trade, capital and people round the world. While some elders have benefited, most notably where pensions and health care are well developed, the majority of older men and women are among the poor who have lost out the world over. Free trade, economic restructuring, the globalisation of finance and the upsurge in migration have all tended to affect elders badly {{in most parts of the}} world. These developments have been overseen or even dictated by intergovernmental organisations (IGOs) such as the International Monetary Foundation (IMF), the World Bank and World Trade Organization (WTO) while other IGOs with less power have been limited to anti ageist exhortation. Globalisation transfers resources from the poor to the rich within countries and between them. It therefore increases social problems but at the same time diminishes the capacity of countries to make social policy. However the effects of globalisation, particularly financial globalisation, on national capacity for making social policy can be exaggerated.

These three samples included 428 participants from China, 818 participants from the US, and 871 participants from globally dispersed teams (GDTs). An EQS procedure and a polynomial regression procedure were used to examine whether the covariance matrices were equal across samples and whether the relationships between self-other agreement and performance would be different across cultures, respectively.
