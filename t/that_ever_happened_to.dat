While in Ocala, he tried to become better at basketball by doing 200 push-ups every night. He also visited his hometown during school vacations. In his time living in Florida, Clinkscales had a growth spurt and stood nearly at 6ft (1.83 m), boosting his performance on the court.

500|$|Bowie {{declared}} himself gay {{in an interview}} with Michael Watts for a 1972 issue of Melody Maker, coinciding with his campaign for stardom as Ziggy Stardust. According to Buckley, [...] "If Ziggy confused both his creator and his audience, a big part of that confusion centred on the topic of sexuality". In a September 1976 interview with Playboy, Bowie said, [...] "It's true—I am a bisexual. But I can't deny that I've used that fact very well. I suppose it's the best thing <b>that</b> <b>ever</b> <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> me". According to his first wife, Angie, Bowie had a relationship with Mick Jagger.|$|E
500|$|Hastert {{opposed the}} Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act (McCain-Feingold), the {{landmark}} {{campaign finance reform}} law. In 2001, during {{the debate on the}} bill, Hastert criticized Republican Senator John McCain of Arizona, saying that McCain had [...] "bullied" [...] House Republicans by sending them letters in support of his campaign-finance reform proposals. Hastert called the legislation [...] "the worst thing <b>that</b> <b>ever</b> <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> Congress" [...] and expressed the view that there were [...] "constitutional flaws" [...] in the legislation. Supporters of campaign-finance reform circumvented Hastert by means of a discharge petition, a seldom-used procedural mechanism in which a measure may be brought to a floor vote (over the objections of the speaker) if an absolute majority of Representatives sign a petition in support of doing so. The discharge petition was not successfully used again until 2015.|$|E
500|$|The {{song was}} played only once and {{received}} minor treatments afterwards, {{with the addition}} of a cello part in the introduction and some editing, which included removing a verse to reduce the song's length. Eno was outraged that U2 wanted to shorten the song, and he was adamant that the band not alter the original track too much, saying, [...] "These fucking guys, they're supposed to be so spiritual—they don't spot a miracle when it hits them in the face. Nothing like <b>that</b> <b>ever</b> <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> me in the studio in my whole life." [...] The band's original concept for No Line on the Horizon was to create an album of future hymns—songs that would be played forever. According to Eno and Lanois, [...] "Moment of Surrender" [...] is the closest the band came to reaching that concept.|$|E

As Love later reflected, [...] "The best thing <b>that</b> <b>ever</b> <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> me in a way, was Kat." [...] Love asked Bjelland to start a band with her as a guitarist, and the two moved to San Francisco in June 1985, where they {{recruited}} bassist Jennifer Finch and drummer Janis Tanaka. According to Bjelland, [...] " [...] didn't play an instrument at the time" [...] aside from keyboards, so Bjelland would transcribe Love's musical ideas on guitar for her. The group played several house shows and recorded one 4-track demo before disbanding in late 1985. After Pagan Babies, Love moved to Minneapolis, where Bjelland had formed the group Babes in Toyland, and briefly worked as a concert promoter before returning to California.|$|E

500|$|Following {{a period}} of adjustment, Selänne gained an {{appreciation}} for his new team; he quickly came to call the deal the best thing <b>that</b> <b>ever</b> <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> him. He was paired with Paul Kariya, whom he met at the 1996 NHL All-Star Game, and the duo were counted on to lead the young franchise to a post-season berth for the first time. Selänne scored 36 points in 28 games with the Ducks, and combined with his Jets totals, finished the 1995–96 season with 108 points. He followed {{it up with a}} third 100-point season in 1996–97, finishing with 109, including 51 goals. He was named to the First All-Star Team for a second time, while he and Kariya led the Mighty Ducks into the franchise's first playoff appearance in 1997.

500|$|The {{loss of the}} Red Sox {{was seen}} as a manifestation of the Curse of the Bambino, long thought to be the reason behind all things bad <b>that</b> <b>ever</b> <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> the Red Sox. Described as a [...] "shocking blast" [...] by the Sporting News, Dent's home run silenced the Fenway Park crowd. [...] For the light-hitting Dent, it was just his fifth home run of the 1978 season. It sealed Dent's {{reputation}} among Yankee fans, while inspiring the permanent nickname [...] "Bucky Fucking Dent" [...] in New England. Dent, later the manager of the Yankees, was fired during a series in Boston in 1990. Twenty-five years later, in Game 7 of the 2003 American League Championship Series, Aaron Boone received similar treatment by Red Sox fans after he hit the home run {{in the bottom of the}} 11th inning that clinched the pennant for the Yankees, but the Yankees would later lose to the Florida Marlins in the World Series, which went six games.|$|E
500|$|Final Fantasy Adventure was {{featured}} in Nintendo Power when it was re-released in the United States. The game holds an aggregated score of 79.07% approval rating on Game Rankings based on seven reviews. IGN praised the Game Boy re-release version noting its strong story, graphics, and music. They additionally praised the game's puzzle elements as innovative and drew comparisons to , though noted that its role-playing gameplay did not blend well with its action-oriented nature. RPGFan also praised the game stating it was [...] "possibly the best thing <b>that</b> <b>ever</b> <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> Gameboy." [...] RPGamer praised the game's plot stating,"The story is one where you can relate to the characters and also the world around them." [...] Ndojo also gave similar praise to the game however noting it being vastly different from Final Fantasy stating, [...] "If you’re expecting Final Fantasy in the traditional sense, you’re going to be disappointed. However, if you play the game for a while, you just might find that it’s equally entertaining in its own fashion." ...|$|E
500|$|As {{the series}} ended its first season, a problem had arisen for the producers: the {{pregnancy}} of Gillian Anderson, who played Dana Scully. Some network executives wanted the role recast, which Carter refused to do. Though they considered having Scully {{giving birth to}} an alien child, the producers decided to work around Anderson's pregnancy by having her abducted and appearing comatose several episodes later. This was described by executive producer Frank Spotnitz as [...] "the best thing <b>that</b> <b>ever</b> <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> the series" [...] as it helped form the intricate mythology that would run throughout the show. The writers decided to close the X-Files {{at the end of}} the first season and thus separate Mulder and Scully in the earlier episodes of the season. To hide Anderson's pregnancy in the early episodes, the producers disguised it with [...] "very fancy trick angles, trench coats, and scenes where she is seated rather than standing". Anderson was not featured at all in the episode [...] "3", as she was giving birth to her daughter at the time.|$|E

I was just enjoying watching the crotchety old coot kick his arse." ...|$|R
5000|$|Three {{episodes in}} the second half of the season starred Michael Weston as Simon Marsden, Olivia's half brother. Hargitay {{described}} this storyline as [...] "probably the biggest thing <b>that's</b> <b>ever</b> <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> Olivia." [...] The episode in which Marsden is introduced features an appearance by Mary Stuart Masterson in her recurring role of Dr. Rebecca Hendrix.|$|R
500|$|After several {{stand-alone}} episodes featuring UFOs and extraterrestrials {{early in}} the first season, the show's mythology developed largely based on the pregnancy of actress Gillian Anderson, who became pregnant midway through production of the first season. Executive producer Frank Spotnitz described it as [...] "the best thing <b>that</b> <b>ever</b> <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> the series", noting that the mythology [...] "really ended up running through {{the life of the}} series, all because Gillian Anderson became pregnant". Although there were initially thoughts about Anderson's character Scully giving birth to an alien child, ultimately the writers decided to work around Anderson's pregnancy. The writers decided on closing the X-Files {{at the end of the}} season to separate Mulder and Scully from one another, and have Scully abducted, reappearing comatose several episodes later. In addition to the creation of the storyline concerning Scully's abduction, Anderson's reduced role in the first half of the second season permitted the writers to develop some of the other characters in the show including Assistant Director Walter Skinner (Mitch Pileggi), The Smoking Man (William B. Davis) and X (Steven Williams), and resulted in the introduction of the character Alex Krycek (Nicholas Lea). Krycek, who was initially created by writer Howard Gordon to temporarily replace Scully as Mulder's partner for three episodes eventually grew into a character that lasted seven seasons on the show.|$|E
500|$|Although widely acclaimed, {{the album}} has been censured by some. It was voted the worst record ever {{made in a}} 1998 Melody Maker poll of pop stars, DJs and journalists. Among the harshest detractors was {{musician}} and journalist John Robb, who described the album as [...] "the benchmark of 1967 – the low water point of rock 'n' roll". In a scathing appraisal of the record prior to its 40th anniversary in 2007, Guardian critic Richard Smith wrote that it is [...] "if not the worst, then certainly the most overrated album of all time". He {{also said that the}} [...] "excruciating" [...] LP was often ranked by members of the music press as the best ever due to affection for its cultural impact, and [...] "not because of anything intrinsically great about the record". Asked in 2007 to nominate the [...] "supposedly great" [...] album he would [...] "gladly never hear again", artist and writer Billy Childish named Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band, saying that it [...] "signalled the death of rock 'n' roll". Musician and author Bill Drummond, in a 2010 publication, called the record [...] "the worst thing <b>that</b> <b>ever</b> <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> music". In 2015, Rolling Stones guitarist Keith Richards denounced the album as [...] "a mishmash of rubbish, kind of like Satanic Majesties".|$|E
500|$|Angelou {{came up with}} Letter to My Daughter, {{which became}} a New York Times bestseller, while going through old boxes of notes and papers full of {{concepts}} for future books and poems, which she called [...] "WIP" [...] ("Works in Progress"). She found twenty years worth of notes written to her friend Oprah Winfrey, and realized that she should put the essays they inspired into a book so that others could read them. Although she had no daughters, and {{gave birth to a}} son (Guy Johnson), which she called [...] "the best thing <b>that</b> <b>ever</b> <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> me in my life", many women in Angelou's career looked to her as a mother figure. She wrote Letters to speak to those women and to share with them the wisdom she has gained throughout her long life. According to writer Gary Younge of The Guardian, most of the essays [...] "end with the kind of wisdom that, depending on your taste, qualifies as either homespun or hokey". For example, she uses what has been called her most famous statement, when speaking of Cuban artist Celia Cruz: [...] "We are more alike than unalike". Although Angelou discounts the idea when he brings it up to her, Younge thinks Letter reads like an extended farewell; in her 500-word introduction she mentions death twice.|$|E
5000|$|The Allmusic {{review by}} William Ruhlmann awarded the album three stars and said [...] "From the beginning, the two singers display a rapport, with Jackson, {{who has a}} more {{distinctive}} voice and a more natural performing style than Feinstein, helping his better-known partner loosen up and wail...Musically at least, Cheyenne Jackson {{is one of the}} best things <b>that's</b> <b>ever</b> <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> him." ...|$|R
5000|$|Floyd {{came very}} close to winning a second Green Jacket at the 1990 Masters, where he lost in a playoff to Nick Faldo. On the second playoff hole, Floyd pulled a 7-iron shot into the pond left of the 11th green. Afterward, he said, [...] "This is the most devastating thing <b>that's</b> <b>ever</b> <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> me in my career. I've had a lot of losses, but nothing like this." ...|$|R

They race to the bus station in the MOBs van, arriving just as the bus is about to leave. O.B. hopped on the bus and tells Summer that she only asked him twice to leave and everyone knows that it's three times for luck. After a hug and a kiss, they departed for London with Max looking on.|$|R
500|$|Humor and irony are {{frequently}} {{used in the}} book. Mark Lawson of The Guardian considered the narrator's tone to be [...] "sardonic empath", and other critics have characterized {{the beginning of the}} novel as comical. When Cal is baptized as an infant by Father Mike, a Greek Orthodox clergyman, the priest receives a surprise: [...] "From between my cherubic legs a stream of crystalline liquid shot into the air ... Propelled by a full bladder, it cleared the lip of the font ... struck Father Mike {{right in the middle of}} the face." [...] Derek Weiler of the Toronto Star noted that Eugenides has witty commentary about German compound words and the [...] "horrific qualities of public men's rooms". The author employed another writing deviceabrupt incongruityin describing Desdemona's physical appearances to suggest that her incestuous acts should be taken lightly when judging her. In describing her hair, he wrote that her [...] "braids were not delicate like a little girl's but heavy and womanly, possessing a natural power, like a beaver's tail". According to Penelope Music of Book Magazine, the mismatch in tone of the final two words compared with the rest of the sentence was such that the reading experience was changed from [...] "run-of-the-mill magical realism to true, subversive comedy". An instance of irony is illustrated by Cal's grandparents and parents: His grandparents assimilate into American culture through hard work and struggles while retaining certain old customs. His parents, however, abandon their roots for a more comfortable lifestyle. In another incident, the diner owned by the Stephanides is engulfed in flames during the 1967 Detroit riot. Cal notes that [...] "hameful as it is to say, the riots were the best thing <b>that</b> <b>ever</b> <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> us." [...] The diner was insured and the Stephanides gain a windfall payout.|$|E
500|$|Efforts at {{improvement}} {{before the}} bombing had in some respects made matters worse, cutting off the area north of the Arndale Centre– the exterior of which was widely unloved– {{from the rest of}} the city centre. A large building nearby, now redeveloped as The Printworks and formerly occupied by the Daily Mirror newspaper, had been unoccupied since 1987. Many locals therefore considered that [...] "the bomb was the best thing <b>that</b> <b>ever</b> <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> Manchester", as it cleared the way for redevelopment of the dysfunctional city centre, a view also expressed in 2007 by Terry Rooney, MP for Bradford North. The leader of the Liberal Democrat opposition on Manchester City Council, Simon Ashley, responded that [...] "I take exception to his [...] comments about the IRA bomb. No one who was in the city on that day, who lost their jobs or was scared witless or injured by the blast, would say the bomb was the best thing to happen to Manchester". [...] Sir Gerald Kaufman, MP for Manchester Gorton, stated that the bomb provided the opportunity for redeveloping Manchester city centre, although it was not fully exploited. [...] "The bomb was obviously bad but from a redevelopment point of view, it was a lost opportunity. While the area around St Ann's Square and Deansgate is not disagreeable, if you compare it with Birmingham and its exciting development, we've got nothing to touch that in Manchester". Howard Bernstein, chief executive of Manchester City Council, has been quoted as saying [...] "people say the bomb turned out to be a great thing for Manchester. That's rubbish." [...] There was already substantial regeneration and redevelopment taking place in the city centre {{before the bombing}}, in support of the Manchester bid for the 2000 Summer Olympics, its second Olympic bid. Tom Bloxham, chairman of property development group Urban Splash and of the Arts Council England (North West), agreed with Bernstein that the bomb attack was not the trigger for the large-scale redevelopment that has taken place in Manchester since the early 1990s: ...|$|E
