40|$|Phase {{wrapping}} {{is one of}} main {{causes of}} the local minima problem in waveform inversion. However, the unwrapping process for 2 D phase maps that includes singular points (residues) is complicated and does not guarantee unique solutions. We employ an exponential damping <b>to</b> <b>eliminate</b> <b>the</b> <b>residues</b> in the 2 D phase maps, which makes the 2 D phase unwrapping process easy and produce a unique solution. A recursive inversion process using the damped unwrapped phase provides an opportunity to invert for smooth background updates first, and higher resolution updates later as we reduce the damping. We also apply a Gaussian filter to the gradient to mitigate the edge artifacts resulting from the narrow shape of the sensitivity kernels at high damping. Numerical examples demonstrate that our unwrapped phase inversion with damping and a Gaussian filter produces good convergent results even for a 3 Hz single frequency of Marmousi dataset and with a starting model far from the true model...|$|E
40|$|One of {{the major}} {{concerns}} in dairy cattle lodging management is the great amount of manure produced daily in a reduced area that can be an excellent fertilizer option or an enormous pollutant potential, depending on the disposal procedures. In Brazil, the destination of raw effluent of lodged dairy cattle {{was in the past}} and continues nowadays being the water courses using the conventional and condemned method of the dilution, as the only form <b>to</b> <b>eliminate</b> <b>the</b> <b>residues</b> of the installations {{which is one of the}} reasons for eutrophication of rivers, streams, lakes and ponds. A pilot plant was installed to treat 10 % of the effluent produced in the dairy parlor installations of the EAFI/MG. The pilot plant was designed with three units: an anaerobic lagoon followed by a facultative pond and a subsurface constructed wetland. The pilot plant presented the following average removal: phosphorus, 80 %; nitrate, 88 %; COD, 89 %; total solids, 67 %; and turbidity, 60 %. The pH during the whole operation maintained around 6. 2. The study concluded that the system presented a great potential for treatment of dairy parlor effluent...|$|E
40|$|In this work, we {{communicate}} a facile and low temperature synthesis {{process for the}} fabrication of graphene-TiO 2 photocatalytic composite thin films. A sol-gel chemical route is used to synthesize TiO 2 from the precursor solutions and spin and spray coating are used to deposit the films. Excitation of the wet films during the casting process by ultrasonic vibration favorably influences both the sol-gel route and the deposition process, through the following mechanisms. The ultrasound energy imparted to the wet film breaks down the physical bonds of the gel phase. As a result, only a low-temperature post annealing process is required <b>to</b> <b>eliminate</b> <b>the</b> <b>residues</b> to complete the conversion of precursors to TiO 2. In addition, ultrasonic vibration creates a nanoscale agitating motion or microstreaming in the liquid film that facilitates mixing of TiO 2 and graphene nanosheets. The films made based on the above-mentioned ultrasonic vibration-assisted method and annealed at 150 °C contain both rutile and anatase phases of TiO 2, {{which is the most}} favorable configuration for photocatalytic applications. The photoinduced and photocatalytic experiments demonstrate effective photocurrent generation and elimination of pollutants by graphene-TiO 2 composite thin films fabricated via scalable spray coating and mild temperature processing, the results of which are comparable with those made using lab-scale and energy-intensive processes...|$|E
50|$|There {{are several}} {{families}} of dual-specificity phosphatase enzymes in mammals. All share a similar catalytic mechanism, {{by which a}} conserved cysteine residue forms a covalent intermediate with the phosphate group <b>to</b> be <b>eliminated.</b> <b>The</b> <b>residues</b> surrounding their catalytic core obey a rather strict consensus: His-Cys-x-x-x-x-x-Arg-Ser. The serine side chain and an additional conserved aspartate {{play a central role}} in the elimination of the Cys-linked intermediate, thus completing their enzymatic cycle. The main difference between tyrosine-specific phosphatases and dual-specificity phosphatases lies in the width of the latter enzymes' catalytic pocket: thus they can accommodate phosphorylated serine or threonine side chains as well as phosphorylated tyrosines.|$|R
40|$|Hybrid {{materials}} of the polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) -Tetraethyl orthosilicate (TEOS) system {{have already been}} widely described by several authors, being their potential for biological applications largely studied. For some bone related applications, the addition of Ca to these systems is commonly accepted as necessary for the enhancement of bioactivity. However Ca is commonly introduced {{in the form of}} calcium nitrate, which requires a heat treatment step in order <b>to</b> <b>eliminate</b> <b>the</b> nitrate <b>residues.</b> <b>The</b> aim of the present work is to produce a PDMS-SiO 2 -CaO-TiO 2 hybrid material through a sol-gel process, for potential biomedical applications. Calcium nitrate was used as the calcium source and to avoid the presence of nitrate <b>residues</b> in <b>the</b> final product, a heat-treating step at 400 degrees C was performed. Titanium was added to the hybrid system in order to enhance the thermal stability of the materials subjected to this temperature. TGA, FT-IR and Si- 29 NMR techniques were used to understand the role of the calcium and titanium in the structure formation, and the way they influence the thermal stability of the PDMS -SiO 2 system. A final material containing calcium, with no traces of nitrate and the maintenance of a significant amount of methyl groups was successfully obtained. (C) 2013 Elsevier B. V.

40|$|This article {{provides}} the first English translation of Tanabe’s early essay, “The Limit of Logicism in Epistemology: A Critique of the Marburg and Freiburg Schools” (1914). The key {{notion that the}} young Tanabe seeks to define in relation to his detailed analyses of contemporary Neo-Kantian epistemology {{is the notion of}} “pure experience” presented in Nishida’s philosophy. The general theory of epistemology shared among the thinkers from these two prominent schools of philosophy in early 20 th century Germany aimed <b>to</b> <b>eliminate</b> <b>the</b> empirical <b>residues</b> in Kant’s theory of knowledge while opposing naïve empiricism and the uncritical methodology of positive science. Their “logicistic” approach, according to Tanabe, seems to contradict Nishida’s notion of pure experience, for it cannot allow any vestige of empiricism in its systematic framework, which is specifically designed to ground scientific knowledge. Yet given that the Neo-Kantian configuration of epistemology does not create the object of knowledge, it must face sensation or representational content as its limiting instance. Thus, to ground a Neo-Kantian theory of knowledge while taking account of this limit of logicism involves explaining their understanding of the unity of subject and object in human knowing. For this, Tanabe argues, recourse to Nishida’s notion of pure experience is indispensable...|$|R

A large batch of Apa was purified from M. tuberculosis culture filtrate {{to determine the extent of}} glycosylation and its role on the expression of the immune responses. Mass spectrometry revealed a spectrum of glycosylated molecules, with the majority of species bearing six, seven, or eight mannose residues (22, 24, and 17 %, respectively), while others three, four, or five mannoses (5, 9, and 14 %, respectively). Molecules with one, two, or nine mannoses were rare (1. 5, 3, and 3 %, respectively), as were unglycosylated species (in the range of 1 %). <b>To</b> <b>eliminate</b> <b>the</b> mannose <b>residues</b> linked <b>to</b> <b>the</b> protein, the glycosylated Apa molecules were chemically or enzymatically treated.

40|$|Some trace {{elements}} have the property that, {{although they are}} incompatible with most mineral phases in magmatic systems, they are strongly concentrated in certain minor mineral phases. These minor phases, termed here ‘carrier-phases’, and their associated {{trace elements}} include platinum group elements in base metal sulphide and chromite; chromium and vanadium in magnetite; uranium group metals in zircon and monazite; and rare earth elements in monazite and xenotime. Carrier-phases may form {{only a small fraction}} of a source rock undergoing partial melting and tend <b>to</b> be <b>eliminated</b> from <b>the</b> <b>residue</b> at an intermediate point in the partial melting history; conversely, those same minor carrier-phases tend to precipitate late during fractional crystallization of a liquid produced in the above manner, but may constitute a high proportion of the cumulate then forming. This paper explores the phase equilibria aspects of such processes in a simple system, outlining a nomenclature which is then used in a mathematical treatment applicable to non-modal melting and crystallization processes involving several crystal species. The treatment at this stage assumes constant individual crystal–liquid distribution coefficients. Equations are developed, which are applied in a companion paper to illustrate the behaviour that can be anticipated when carrier-phases play a significant role in trace element location during melting and crystallization...|$|R
40|$|Blood loss {{at sites}} of {{vascular}} rupture {{is controlled by}} the adhesion and aggregation of platelets and the formation of an insoluble fibrin matrix. Fibrinogen is considered to be critical in these processes by both providing an abundant dimeric ligand for alpha IIb beta 3 -mediated platelet aggregation, and serving as the fundamental building block of the fibrin polymer. To establish an in vivo model system to examine in detail the importance of alpha IIb beta 3 -fibrinogen interactions in platelet function, hemostasis, response to injury and vasoocclusive disease, and to test the prevailing hypothesis that the C-terminal segment of the fibrinogen gamma chain is essential for alpha IIb beta 3 binding, we have used gene-targeting technology in mice <b>to</b> <b>eliminate</b> <b>the</b> last five <b>residues</b> (QAGDV) from <b>the</b> gamma chain. Mice homozygous for the modified gamma chain gene (gamma delta 5 /gamma delta 5) displayed a generally normal hematological profile, including normal platelet count, plasma fibrinogen level, clotting time and fibrin crosslinking. However, both gamma delta 5 -fibrinogen binding to alpha IIb beta 3 and platelet aggregation were highly defective. Remarkably, another alpha IIb beta 3 -dependent process, clot retraction, was unaffected by the gamma delta 5 mutation. Despite the preservation of clotting function, gamma delta 5 /gamma delta 5 mice were unable to control blood loss following a surgical challenge and occasionally developed fatal neonatal bleeding events...|$|R
40|$|Full-waveform {{inversion}} (FWI) {{suffers from}} the phase wrapping (cycle skipping) problem when the frequency of data is not low enough. Unless we obtain a good initial velocity model, the phase wrapping problem in FWI causes a result corresponding to a local minimum, usually {{far away from the}} true solution, especially at depth. Thus, we have developed an inversion algorithm based on a space-domain unwrapped phase, and we also used exponential damping to mitigate the nonlinearity associated with the reflections. We construct the 2 D phase residual map, which usually contains the wrapping discontinuities, especially if the model is complex and the frequency is high. We then unwrap the phase map and remove these cycle-based jumps. However, if the phase map has several <b>residues,</b> <b>the</b> unwrapping process becomes very complicated. We apply a strong exponential damping <b>to</b> <b>the</b> wavefield <b>to</b> <b>eliminate</b> much of <b>the</b> <b>residues</b> in <b>the</b> phase map, thus making the unwrapping process simple. We finally invert the unwrapped phases using the back-propagation algorithm to calculate the gradient. We progressively reduce the damping factor to obtain a high-resolution image. Numerical examples determined that the unwrapped phase inversion with a strong exponential damping generated convergent long-wavelength updates without low-frequency information. This model {{can be used as a}} good starting model for a subsequent inversion with a reduced damping, eventually leading to conventional waveform inversion...|$|R
40|$|The CyanoQ protein {{has been}} {{demonstrated}} to be a component of cyanobacterial Photosystem II (PS II), but there exist a number of outstanding questions concerning its physical association with the complex. CyanoQ is a lipoprotein; upon cleavage of its transit peptide by Signal Peptidase II, which targets delivery of the mature protein to the thylakoid lumenal space, <b>the</b> N-terminal cysteinyl <b>residue</b> is lipid-modified. This modification appears to tether this otherwise soluble component to the thylakoid membrane. To probe the functional significance of the lipid anchor, mutants of the CyanoQ protein have been generated in Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 <b>to</b> <b>eliminate</b> <b>the</b> N-terminal cysteinyl <b>residue,</b> preventing lipid modification. Substitution of <b>the</b> N-terminal cysteinyl <b>residue</b> with serine (Q-C 22 S) resulted in {{a decrease in the}} amount of detectable CyanoQ protein to 17 % that of the wild-type protein. Moreover, the physical properties of the accumulated Q-C 22 S protein were consistent with altered processing of the CyanoQ precursor. The Q-C 22 S protein was shifted to a higher apparent molecular mass and partitioned in the hydrophobic phase in TX- 114 phase-partitioning experiments. These results suggest that the hydrophobic N-terminal 22 amino acids were not properly cleaved by a signal peptidase. Substitution of the entire CyanoQ transit peptide with the transit peptide of the soluble lumenal protein PsbO yielded the Q-SS mutant and resulted in no detectable accumulation of the modified CyanoQ protein. Finally, the CyanoQ protein was present at normal amounts in the PS II mutant strains ΔpsbB and ΔpsbO, indicating that an association with PS II was not a prerequisite for stable CyanoQ accumulation. Together these results indicate that CyanoQ accumulation in Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 depends on the presence of the N-terminal lipid anchor, but not on the association of CyanoQ with the PS II complex...|$|R
40|$|Experimental phase {{equilibrium}} and trace element partitioning data are reported for H 2 O-saturated mid-ocean ridge basalt at 2. 5 GPa, 750 - 900 °C and oxygen fugacities at the nickel - nickel oxide buffer. Garnet, omphacite and rutile are present at all temperatures. Amphibole and epidote disappear as residual phases above 800 °C; allanite appears above 750 °C. The Na - Al-rich silicate glass {{present in all}} run products {{is likely to have}} quenched from a supercritical liquid. Trace element analyses of glasses demonstrate the important control exerted by residual minerals on liquid chemistry. In addition to garnet, which controls heavy rare earth elements (HREE) and Sc, and rutile, which controls Ti, Nb and Ta, allanite buffers the light REE (LREE; La - Sm) contents of liquids to relatively low levels and preferentially holds back Th relative to U. In agreement with previous experimental and metamorphic studies we propose that residual allanite {{plays a key role in}} selectively retaining trace elements in the slab during subduction. Experimental data and analyses of allanite-bearing volcanic rocks are used to derive a model for allanite solubility in liquids as a function of pressure, temperature, anhydrous liquid composition and LREE content. The large temperature dependence of allanite solubility is very similar to that previously determined for monazite. Our model, fitted to 48 datapoints, retrieves LREE solubility (in ppm) to within a factor of 1. 40 over a pressure range of 0 - 4 GPa, temperature range of 700 - 1200 °C and for liquids with anhydrous SiO 2 contents of 50 - 84 wt %. This uncertainty in LREE content is equivalent to a temperature uncertainty of only ± 27 °C at 1000 K, indicating the potential of allanite as a geothermometer. Silicic liquids from either basaltic or sedimentary protoliths will be saturated in allanite except for Ca-poor protoliths or at very high temperatures. For conventional subduction geotherms the low solubility of LREE (+ Th) in liquids raises questions about the mechanism of LREE + Th transport from slab to wedge. It is suggested either that, locally, temperatures experienced by the slab are high enough <b>to</b> <b>eliminate</b> allanite in <b>the</b> <b>residue</b> or that substantial volumes of H 2 O-rich fluids must pass through the mantle wedge prior to melting. The solubility of accessory phases in fluids derived from subducted rocks can provide important constraints on subduction zone thermal structure. 31 page(s...|$|R
