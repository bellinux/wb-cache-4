5|$|Despite {{his failure}} at seizing the throne, Constantine Doukas' {{popularity}} meant that his memory was preserved both {{among the people}} and the aristocracy of Asia Minor: in the 930s, Basil the Copper Hand assumed his identity and led a peasant revolt, while among the aristocracy he was glorified as a hero. Elements of Constantine's life eventually found <b>their</b> <b>way</b> <b>into</b> the epic poem Digenes Akrites.|$|E

5|$|Filming {{also took}} place in 2005, near the {{marketplace}} of the Bucharest neighborhood Rahova. The chosen area raised a few difficulties related to safety.

5|$|After Aubers Ridge, {{the corps}} was then rested {{in a quiet}} sector until September, when it {{deployed}} for the Battle of Loos. The initial attack was {{to be made by}} three divisions, with the Meerut Division leading the attack on the Indian front; Blackader's brigade, with two Gurkha battalions and the 2nd Leicesters, was on its right flank.

5|$|Because {{of their}} {{carnivorous}} {{nature and the}} beauty of their glistening traps, sundews have become favorite ornamental plants; however, the environmental requirements of most species are relatively stringent and can be difficult to meet in cultivation. As a result, most species are unavailable commercially. A few of the hardiest varieties, however, have made <b>their</b> <b>way</b> <b>into</b> the mainstream nursery business and can often be found for sale next to Venus flytraps. These most often include D. capensis, D. aliciae, and D. spatulata.|$|E

Nintendo was quick to take legal action against those distributing {{the game in the}} US. Bootleg copies of Donkey Kong also appeared in both North America and France under the Crazy Kong, Konkey Kong or Donkey King names. The 1982 Logger arcade game from Century Electronics is a direct clone of Donkey Kong, with a large bird standing in for the ape and rolling logs instead of barrels.|$|E

It was known by this name because the layout of the water body suggested a shape similar to that of a slug.|$|E

As {{a result of the}} popularity of these sorts of foods, Wales has the highest fat consumption in Britain, and the highest levels of obesity.|$|E
