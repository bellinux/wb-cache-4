50|$|The {{structure}} and {{dynamics of the}} gastrointestinal peptide hormone motilin have been studied {{in the presence of}} isotropic q = 0.5 phospholipid bicelles. The NMR solution structure of the peptide in acidic bicelle solution was determined from 203 NOE-derived distance constraints and six backbone torsion angle constraints. Dynamic properties for the 13Cα→1H vector in Leu-10 were determined for motilin specifically labeled with 13C at this position by analysis of multiple-field relaxation data. The structure reveals an ordered alpha-helical conformation between Glu-9 and Lys-20. The N-terminus is also well structured with a turn resembling that of a classical beta-turn. The 13C dynamics clearly show that motilin tumbles slowly in solution, with a correlation <b>time</b> <b>characteristic</b> of a large object.|$|E

During the construction period of Onyx hotel in 1974, a typical Illyrian military helmet was discovered accidentally. Apropos, the archaeological rescue excavations commenced at this site that resulted with abundant movable archeological material being discovered, while {{among the most important}} ones uncovered features a grave of an important pair of people that was named by the archeologists as The Royal Tomb. The couple's grave was constructed in the rectangular shape base and built with tuff stone plates, most probably extracted from the neighboring quarry. The recorded female grave contained rich grave goods material for example; fibula, omega shape needles, a ring and necklace decorated with geometrical motifs, forged in silver and bronze. On the other hand, the male burial grave contained the grave goods, personal belongings composed of; weapons, silver and bronze jewelry. The archaeological documentation of these important and valuable findings, among others, offers a picture of the <b>time,</b> <b>characteristic</b> for the social and economical differentiation of individuals or groups. Rich archaeological material discovered at this site belongs to the Late Iron Age, 6th-5th century BC. Surrounding micro region is rich on site and off site findings of different periods, confirming the continuity and occupancy of these most probably due to the great life conditions when having in mind the thermal water sources near this site. On the other hand, the landscape and geostrategic favorable position were ideal for selection of this locality to be inhabited during the long time period.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThis paper {{presents}} the recovery <b>time</b> <b>characteristic</b> of BSCCO (Bi- 2212) Superconducting Fault Current Limiter (SFCL) on Small Power Producer (SPP) for transient stability and fault current reduction. The Bi- 2212 SFCL thermal model including the resistance behavior is investigated {{to determine the}} recovery <b>time</b> <b>characteristic</b> on the transient stability. The recovery time of the SFCL is directly obtained by adjusting the shunt reactor to demonstrate {{the effect of the}} SFCL recovery. The simulation results reveal that the recovery time of the SFCL depends on the shunt reactance. With the high shunt reactance, the SFCL can more diminish the fault current than the one from the low shunt. Nevertheless, the stability margin will be decreased leading to the out of step condition of generator. For this reason, this paper also proposes the method to find the suitable shunt reactance of the SFCL to accomplish both the transient stability and fault current curtailment...|$|E

Using the circuit, the <b>time</b> <b>characteristics</b> of the beta-ray Orange Spectrometer are determined to be such that for most coincidence measurements the lower limit of resolution will be determined primarily by the photomultipliers and scintillators, and not the spectrometer. A method for calculating the electron path lengths - and so, times of flight - which {{can be applied to}} spectrometers of this type is outlined and tested. The circuit provides a ready means for measuring the <b>time</b> <b>characteristics</b> of the avalanche transistor itself, and such a study is made.

40|$|The {{contributions}} of specific residues in γ- and ɛ-subunits to the developmental changes in conductance and open time of Xenopus muscle acetylcholine receptors (AChRs) were investigated. This study was directed primarily at residues in the M 2 domains of γ- and ɛ-subunits; however, {{the results of}} additional mutations in the extracellular region flanking M 2 and in the amphipathic region between M 3 and M 4 are also described. The M 2 domains of γ- and ɛ-subunits differ at only three amino acid residues, {{two of which are}} adjacent to each other and located near the narrowest part of the pore. These two residues (NI in γ, SV in ɛ) were found to be major determinants of the difference in conductance and open time of AChRs bearing γ- or ɛ-subunits. Mutation of N to S in the γ-subunit converted the long open time of receptors bearing the γ-subunit (γ-AChRs) to the brief open <b>time</b> <b>characteristic</b> of receptors bearing an ɛ-subunit (ɛ-AChRs). Conversely, ɛ-AChRs with SV mutated to NI in the ɛ-subunit exhibited a long open <b>time</b> <b>characteristic</b> of γ-AChRs. Mutation of N to S in the γ-subunit increased the conductance of γ-AChRs but did not confer the full conductance of wild-type ɛ-AChRs.
