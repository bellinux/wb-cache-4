30|$|To {{achieve this}} goal, it is {{necessary}} to design a novel fiber-type anode that possesses a hierarchical crystalline TiO 2 structure to reduce the grain boundaries and defects, and maintains a relatively high surface area in the meanwhile. Electrochemical anodization can be used <b>to</b> <b>anodize</b> a Ti wire into a cylindrically core-shell-like TiO 2 nanotube (TNT) array anode. In particular, this anodization process can greatly simplify anode post-processing by employing un-anodized inner Ti cores as the electric conduction leads. Electrochemical anodization has been widely employed <b>to</b> <b>anodize</b> metals into porous oxide membranes, such as anodic aluminum oxide (AAO) [4] and anodic titanium oxide (ATO), which can be further utilized as the templates to prepare various confined or patterned nanostructures [5], including quantum dots [6], nanowires/nanotubes [5, 7 – 9], and even nanonets [8, 10 – 12]. This process possesses an advantage that the key structural parameters of the porous membranes (pore diameter, inter-pore distance, and membrane thickness) can be tuned by carefully controlling the anodization conditions. Porous ATO has drawn particular attention due to the significant role of TiO 2 in DSSCs [13, 14], photocatalysis [15], water photoelectrolysis [13], and organic pollutants degradation [16]. So far, most TNT arrays have been prepared on flat Ti foils [17] as well as other flat substrates such as glass, alumina, and silicon [18]. Wang and co-workers [19] recently reported the fabrication of a DNA-like photo-electrode via electrochemical anodization as well as the application of this photo-electrode in liquid DSSCs. Another group of scientists [20] fabricated the liquid DSSCs by employing the TNT arrays. The device structure by inserting the photo-anode in a capillary glass tube along with a platinum wire as the counter electrode, however, limited the device's flexibility and thus restricted post-processing of solid solar cells.|$|E

AFM images after variable extents of oxide dissolution showed that the voids were distributed evenly through the inner 60 % of the film thickness, indicating that they were formed at the metal-oxide interface during film growth. Both AFM and TEM showed that the void concentration in the film was sensitive to the extent of dissolution of the aluminum samples in NaOH prior <b>to</b> <b>anodizing.</b> Positron annihilation spectroscopy had previously detected voids in samples without anodic films, located in the metal near the oxide-metal interface; the quantity of these interfacial voids was controlled by NaOH dissolution. The void concentration in the inner part of the anodic films was proportional to the quantity of these pre-existing interfacial voids. It was inferred that the oxide voids were formed by incorporation, during anodizing, of interfacial metal voids into the oxide film.

ABSTRACT: Irrigation water quality has significant importance in dry region that have high temperature and low humidity. Mechanical properties and physical properties are stability, porous, soil structure and hydraulic directing relative to exchange ion in irrigation. We can control problem due to pollution in environment level and water resources and can increase products performance.

40|$|Recently, it is {{possible}} to deposit aluminum from non-aqueous solution by using non-aqueous solvent. An anodic oxidation is very common to improve corrosion resistance and micropore formation. However there is almost no investigation about anodic oxidation of plated aluminum film. The plated aluminum films were anodized to create micropore. An oxalic acid was used <b>to</b> <b>anodize</b> Al plated film. Five conditions had been investigated to create micropores by changing oxalic acid concentration, applied voltage and treated time. The best condition was 0. 1 mol/l oxalic acid concentration, 40 V applied voltage and 5 minutes treatment time. In this study, the plated Al films were not uniformly formed. The area that was not uniformly formed, micropore, wave-like structure and so on, showed heterogeneous anodic oxidation. Therefore, an uniform Al film formation is necessary for micropore formation. The plated aluminum film area which showed some roughness also showed heterogeneous anodic oxidation. However, there was some regularity of micropore arrangement. The roughness {{was one of the most}} important factors to improve regularity. An mixture acidic solution of phosphoric acid, sulfuric acid and oxalic acid, whose mixing ratio was 15 : 4 : 1, was used for chemical polishing to improve flatness of plated aluminum film.

However, a crucial parameter in selecting the material for an orthopedic implant {{is the degree}} to which it will integrate into the surrounding bone. Loosening at the bone&ndash;implant interface can cause catastrophic failure when motion occurs between the implant and the surrounding bone. Recently, a different anodization process using hydrofluoric acid has been shown to increase bone growth on commercially pure titanium and titanium alloys through the creation of nanotubes. The objective of this study was to compare, for the first time, the influence of anodizing a titanium alloy medical device in sulfuric acid for color coding purposes, as is done in the orthopedic implant industry, followed by anodizing the device in hydrofluoric acid to implement nanotubes. Specifically, Ti 6 Al 4 V model implant samples were anodized first with sulfuric acid to create color-coding features, and then with hydrofluoric acid to implement surface features to enhance osteoblast functions. The material surfaces were characterized by visual inspection, scanning electron microscopy, contact angle measurements, and energy dispersive spectroscopy. Human osteoblasts were seeded onto the samples for a series of time points and were measured for adhesion and proliferation. After 1 and 2 weeks, the levels of alkaline phosphatase activity and calcium deposition were measured to assess the long-term differentiation of osteoblasts into the calcium depositing cells. The results showed that anodizing in hydrofluoric acid after anodizing in sulfuric acid partially retains color coding and creates unique surface features to increase osteoblast adhesion, proliferation, alkaline phosphatase activity, and calcium deposition. In this manner, this study provides a viable method <b>to</b> <b>anodize</b> an already color coded, anodized titanium alloy to potentially increase bone growth for numerous implant applications.

40|$|Doping {{profiles}} are {{engineered to}} manipulate device properties {{and to determine}} electrical performances of microelectronic devices frequently. To support engineering studies afterward, essential information is usually required from physically characterized doping profiles. Secondary Ion Mass Spectrometry (SIMS), Spreading Resistance Profiling (SRP) and Electrochemical Capacitance Voltage (ECV) profiling are standard techniques for now to map profile. SIMS yields a chemical doping profile via ion sputtering process and owns a better resolution, whereas ECV and SRP produce an electrical doping profile detecting free carriers in microelectronic devices. The major difference between electrical and chemical doping profiles is at heavily doped regions greater than 1020 atoms/cm 3. At the profile region over the solubility limit, inactive dopants induce a flat plateau and detected by electrical measurements only. Destructive techniques are usually designed as stand-alone systems to study impurities. For an in-situ process control purpose, non-contact methods, such as ellipsometry and non-contact capacitance voltage (CV) techniques are current under development. In this theses work, terahertz time domain spectroscopy (THz-TDS) is utilized to achieve electrical doping profile in both destructive and non-contact manners. In recent years the Terahertz group at Rochester Institute Technology developed several techniques that use terahertz pulses to non-destructively map doping profiles. In this thesis, we study a destructive but potentially higher resolution version of the terahertz based approach to map the profile of activated dopants and augment the non-destructive approaches already developed. The basic idea of the profile mapping approach developed in this MS thesis is <b>to</b> <b>anodize,</b> and thus oxidize to silicon dioxide, thin layers (down to below 10 nm) of the wafer with the doping profile to be mapped. Since the dopants atoms and any free carriers in the silicon oxide thin film are invisible to the terahertz probe this anodization step very effectively removes a ‘thin slice’ from the doping profile to be mapped. By iterating between anodization and terahertz measurements that detect only the ‘remaining’ non-oxidized portion of the doping profile one can re-construct the doping profile with significantly higher precision compared to what is possible by only a single non-destructive measurement of the un-anodized profile as used in the non-destructive version of our technique. In this MS thesis we explore all aspects of this anodization based variation of doping profile mapping using free space terahertz pulses. This includes a study of silicon dioxide thin film growth using a room temperature electrochemical oxidation process. Etching procedures providing the option to remove between successive anodization and terahertz measurement steps.

The reduction of fatigue limit under 5 % NaCl environments was much larger than that under high humidity environment. The remarkable reduction of fatigue limit under corrosive environments was attributed {{to the formation of}} corrosion pit, which was induced by simultaneous action of mechanical loading and corrosive environment. To improve the reduced fatigue strength under corrosive environment, coating used to apply on the surface. Non-chromium chemical conversion coating showed superior effect on the improvement of fatigue strength under corrosive environment compared <b>to</b> <b>anodized</b> coating. Fatigue strengths of the coated and painted AZ 61 alloy under high humidity and 5 %NaCl environments showed almost the same fatigue strength as bulk material under low humidity...|$|R
