5|$|After the Simpsons {{arrive at}} home, the camera cuts {{to a shot}} of them on the couch, then zooms out to show this as a picture hanging on the wall of a fictional {{overseas}} Asian animation and merchandise sweatshop. The animation color quickly becomes drab and gray, and the music turns dramatic à la Schindler's List. A large group of tired and sickly artists draw animation cels for The Simpsons among piles of human bones and <b>toxic</b> <b>waste,</b> and a female artist hands a barefoot child employee an animation cel, which he washes in a vat of biohazardous fluid.|$|E
5|$|Construction of the Green Line past Anacostia Station was {{complicated}} by {{the discovery of a}} potential <b>toxic</b> <b>waste</b> site {{in the path of the}} subway. In June 1991, WMATA discovered that the District of Columbia had dumped 426,000 tons of possibly hazardous incinerator bottom ash in an unused exposed culvert along the subway's potential path near St. Elizabeth's Hospital between 1977 and 1989. The city continued to dump the ash at the site for four years after it learned that WMATA planned to use the site for the Green Line. Experts were concerned that the ash dump contained pockets of methane gas and soluble acid, which would make the site unusable by Metrorail.|$|E
5|$|Curtiss-Wright left in 1960, {{after which}} a {{succession}} of tenants further contaminated the nuclear reactor facility and its hot cells with radioactive isotopes, including strontium-90 and cobalt-60. The manufacture of radiation-treated hardwood flooring continued until 2002. Pennsylvania reacquired the land in 1963 and 1967, and in 1965 established Quehanna as a wild area, albeit one with a nuclear facility and industrial complex. The cleanup of the reactor and hot cells took over eight years and cost $30million; the facility was demolished and its nuclear license terminated in 2009. Since 1992 the industrial complex has been home to Quehanna Motivational Boot Camp, a minimum-security prison. Quehanna Wild Area has many sites where radioactive and <b>toxic</b> <b>waste</b> was buried, {{some of which have}} been cleaned up while others were dug up by black bears and white-tailed deer.|$|E

5|$|Jason {{made his}} comic book {{debut in the}} 1993 {{adaptation}} of Jason Goes to Hell, written by Andy Mangels. The three-issue series was a condensed version of the film, with a few added scenes that were never shot. Jason made his first appearance outside of the direct adaptations in Satan's Six No. 4, published in 1993, which {{is a continuation of}} the events of Jason Goes to Hell. In 1995, Nancy A. Collins wrote a three-issue, non-canonical miniseries involving a crossover between Jason and Leatherface. The story involves Jason stowing away aboard a train, after being released from Crystal Lake when the area is drained due to heavy <b>toxic</b> <b>waste</b> dumping. Jason meets Leatherface, who adopts him into his family after the two become friends. Eventually they turn on each other. In 1994 four young adult novels were released under the title of Friday the 13th. They did not feature Jason explicitly, but revolve around people becoming possessed by Jason when they put on his mask.|$|E

The influence of these organics, which display a variety of chemical characteristics, on the heat of hydration, setting, strength development and microstructure were observed. Most organics influenced early hydration by retardation or acceleration but mature samples displayed a similar phase composition to the OPC control. Microstructural observation of organic-containing OPC indicated that subtle spatial variations {{in the distribution of}} hydration phases and topographic features existed despite the absence of significant interference with normal hydration reactions.

5000|$|Characteristic Waste: These are wastes {{that are}} defined {{based on their}} {{specific}} characteristics of ignitability, corrosivity, reactivity, and toxicity. Federal statute 40CFR§261 regulates these wastes. Ignitable wastes are defined by their combustion capacity under conditions when they consist of waste oils and solvents. Corrosive wastes like battery acids are characterized by their pH value - acids (pH ≤ 2) and bases (pH ≥ 12.5). Reactive wastes include lithium-sulfur batteries and explosives that can cause explosions, toxic fumes, or gases and <b>toxic</b> <b>wastes</b> that are harmful to human health or environment when inhaled or ingested or disposed. Examples of <b>toxic</b> <b>wastes</b> include mercury and lead.|$|R
5000|$|The site {{became a}} {{collection}} point for <b>toxic</b> <b>wastes</b> starting {{sometime in the}} 1960s. It {{caught the attention of}} state officials when some of the drums caught fire and burned {{for more than a week}} in 1966. However, at that time there were no laws to address the storage or containment of <b>toxic</b> <b>wastes,</b> and the site continued to be unregulated for another decade. In 1977, the owner (also inferred to be the primary [...] "dumper") of the site, A.L. Taylor, died. It is unclear who owns the property today, and county tax records show that the property taxes have gone unpaid for several years.|$|R
