The sample design consisted of a single-mode mail survey, with two methods of respondent selection: the All Adult method and the Next Birthday method. The sampling consisted of a two-stage stratified sample of addresses used by Marketing Systems Group (MSG). In the All Adult method, two questionnaires were sent with each mailing, where all adults residing in a sampled household {{were asked to complete}} the questionnaire. In the next birthday method, one questionnaire was sent with each mailing so that the adult who would have the next birthday in the sampled household was asked to complete <b>the</b> <b>questionnaire.</b> <b>Data</b> {{were collected}} from 3,959 respondents.

5000|$|Carried out in 1995-1997 HUNT 2 {{was more}} {{extensive}} than HUNT 1, because all residents over 13 years old were invited. HUNT 2 {{was divided into}} Adult and YOUNG-HUNT. YOUNG-HUNT involved the 13- to 19-year-old age group and Adult-HUNT involved participants over 20 years old. Blood samples were taken for participants of the Adult HUNT. Overall participation in HUNT 2 was roughly 75,000 people (70% of the overall population). Sixty {{one percent of the}} HUNT 2 participants also participated in the HUNT 1 survey. There were several additional studies in Adult-HUNT, including spirometry and benmassemålinger. HUNT 2 was a follow-up of the HUNT 1: the questions and comments regarding high blood pressure, diabetes and quality of life were identical or very similar to the questions in HUNT 1. HUNT 2 was a much larger study, with a larger age range (from 13 years upwards), a wider range of subjects, and that more data were collected for each participant. Approximately 70 000 persons participated in HUNT 2 (about 70% [...] ), of which 45 000 had also participated in the HUNT 1 Clinical monitoring, data processing and quality control was performed after data collection was completed, and from autumn 1998 data files have been available to the research community. Besides <b>the</b> <b>questionnaire</b> <b>data</b> and clinical measurements were in HUNT 2 taken a venous blood sample from all participants of which was 20 years or older (a total of about 65 000), and after preliminary analysis, both serum samples and whole blood samples frozen. These store today at minus 70 °C. Also blood clot is stored in the frozen state. Blood samples are a source of genetic information, and thus has great potential for research in genetic epidemiology, or the relative importance of genetic and environmental causes of disease, for example. in cardiovascular diseases, lung diseases, osteoporosis, cancer, headaches, metabolic diseases, etc.|$|E

30|$|<b>The</b> <b>questionnaire</b> <b>data</b> were digitized. In {{accordance}} with the questionnaire guidelines, predefined items were reversed and mean values were computed for the scales intuitiveness, perceived usability, perceived aesthetics, positive emotions, and negative emotions. Global UX evaluation and passage of time judgments were not transformed as they were single-item scales. Most of these values, however, were not normally distributed over participants. Moreover, variances in the TDS low conditions were very small for the scales perceived usability and passage of time judgments. Overall, the skew of the data was too strong to allow a parametric analysis.
