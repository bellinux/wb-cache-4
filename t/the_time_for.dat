30|$|In {{addition}} to the above assumptions, we prescribe constraints on <b>the</b> calculation <b>time</b> <b>for</b> one re-planning.

40|$|<b>The</b> test <b>time</b> <b>for</b> core-external {{interconnect}} {{shorts and}} opens is typically {{much less than}} that for core-internal logic. Therefore, prior work on test-infrastructure design for core-based system-ona-chip (SOC) has mainly focused on minimizing <b>the</b> test <b>time</b> <b>for</b> core-internal logic. However, as feature sizes shrink for newer process technologies, <b>the</b> test <b>time</b> <b>for</b> signal integrity (SI) faults on interconnects cannot be neglected. <b>The</b> test <b>time</b> <b>for</b> SI faults can be comparable to, or even larger than, <b>the</b> test <b>time</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> embedded cores. We investigate the impact of interconnect SI tests on SOC test-architecture design and optimization. A compaction method for SI faults and algorithms for test-architecture optimization are also presented. Experimental results for the ITC’ 02 benchmarks show that the proposed approach can significantly reduce <b>the</b> overall testing <b>time</b> <b>for</b> core-internal logic and core-external interconnects...|$|R

Before he can do so, Alice appears with the news that the Prince has been prevented from marrying Isabelle.

5|$|Although it {{was unusual}} at <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>for</b> a {{national}} candidate to actively campaign, Johnson gave a number of speeches in Tennessee, Kentucky, Ohio, and Indiana. He also sought to boost his chances in Tennessee while re-establishing civil government by making the loyalty oath even more restrictive, in that voters would now have to swear they opposed making a settlement with the Confederacy. The Democratic candidate for president, George McClellan, hoped to avoid additional bloodshed by negotiation, and so the stricter loyalty oath effectively disenfranchised his supporters. Lincoln declined to override Johnson, and their ticket took the state by 25,000 votes. Congress refused to count Tennessee's electoral votes, but Lincoln and Johnson did not need them, having won in most states that had voted, and easily secured the election.|$|E
5|$|As the 46th Congress {{convened in}} 1879, the Democratic caucus was reduced, {{but they still}} held a {{plurality}} of seats. The new House contained 152 Democrats, 139 Republicans, and 20 independents, {{most of whom were}} affiliated with the Greenback Party. Many of Randall's fellow Democrats differed with him over protectionism and his lack of support for Southern railroad subsidies, and considered choosing Joseph Clay Stiles Blackburn of Kentucky as their nominee for Speaker, instead. Several other Southerners' names were floated, too, as anti-Randall Democrats tried to coalesce around a single candidate; in the end, none could be found and the caucus chose Randall as their nominee with 107 votes out of 152. With some Democrats not yet present, however, the Democrats began to fear that the Republicans and Greenbackers would strike a deal to combine their votes to elect James A. Garfield of Ohio as Speaker. When <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>for</b> the vote came, however, Garfield refused to make any compromises with the third-party men, and Randall and the Democrats were able to organize the House once more.|$|E
5|$|Astrology {{was taken}} up by Islamic {{scholars}} following the collapse of Alexandria to the Arabs in the 7th century, and {{the founding of the}} Abbasid empire in the 8th. The second Abbasid caliph, Al Mansur (754–775) founded the city of Baghdad to act as a centre of learning, and included in its design a library-translation centre known as Bayt al-Hikma 'House of Wisdom', which continued to receive development from his heirs and was to provide a major impetus for Arabic-Persian translations of Hellenistic astrological texts. The early translators included Mashallah, who helped to elect <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>for</b> the foundation of Baghdad, and Sahl ibn Bishr, (a.k.a. Zael), whose texts were directly influential upon later European astrologers such as Guido Bonatti in the 13th century, and William Lilly in the 17th century. Knowledge of Arabic texts started to become imported into Europe during the Latin translations of the 12th century.|$|E
