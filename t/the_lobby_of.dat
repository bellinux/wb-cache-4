5|$|The {{rectangular}} narthex {{constitutes the}} middle {{part of the}} building, between the atrium and the cella, and serves as <b>the</b> <b>lobby</b> <b>of</b> the church. It lies directly east of the atrium, through a wide gate flanked {{by a couple of}} high circular turrets.

5|$|The Simpsons creator Matt Groening {{conceived}} {{the idea for}} the Simpsons in <b>the</b> <b>lobby</b> <b>of</b> James L. Brooks's office. Brooks, the producer of the sketch comedy program The Tracey Ullman Show, wanted to use a series of animated shorts as bumpers between sketches. He had asked Groening to pitch an idea for a series of animated shorts, which Groening initially intended to present as his Life in Hell series. When Groening realized that animating Life in Hell would require the rescinding of publication rights for his life's work, he chose another approach and formulated his version of a dysfunctional family.|$|E

5|$|By 1969, Clarence13X {{became very}} tired and slept little. He feared {{that he would}} be killed and {{instructed}} his followers to remain strong if he died. On June12, he spent time with several of his disciples at their school. He left the school between 2:00 and 3:00 am on June 13 and then gambled for an hour or two. As was his occasional practice, he traveled to Dora Smith's house to rest. He was ambushed by three assailants who fatally shot him while he was in <b>the</b> <b>lobby</b> <b>of</b> her apartment building. That morning, several people from the mayor's office met with his family, and the mayor later visited the Five Percenters' school to express condolences.|$|E
5|$|During {{the first}} half of the 20th century the IOC ran on a small budget. As {{president}} of the IOC from 1952 to 1972, Avery Brundage rejected all attempts to link the Olympics with commercial interest. Brundage believed <b>the</b> <b>lobby</b> <b>of</b> corporate interests would unduly impact the IOC's decision-making. Brundage's resistance to this revenue stream meant the IOC left organising committees to negotiate their own sponsorship contracts and use the Olympic symbols. When Brundage retired the IOC had US$2million in assets; eight years later the IOC coffers had swelled to US$45million. This was primarily due to a shift in ideology toward expansion of the Games through corporate sponsorship and the sale of television rights. When Juan Antonio Samaranch was elected IOC president in 1980 his desire was to make the IOC financially independent.|$|E
5|$|In June 1998 {{the brother}} of the Sultan of Brunei, Prince Jefri Bolkiah, was sued by his former {{business}} partners in a case that was settled out of court. During the case the Manoukians claimed that Prince Jefri kept 40 prostitutes at a time at the Dorchester. In 1999, the hotel hosted the first ever Pride of Britain Awards. In March 2002, a robbery took place in <b>the</b> <b>lobby</b> <b>of</b> the hotel when thieves wearing ski masks smashed the jewellery cabinets with a sledgehammer and took off with jewels. The Dorchester celebrated its 80th anniversary in 2011. To mark the event, the charity 'Trees for Cities' planted eighty 'future great trees' around the capital.|$|E

There are still two of the previously three larger wall mosaics in <b>the</b> lift <b>lobbies</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Policlinic Reil in Halle. A further 17-meter long wall mosaic frieze can still be seen in a school in Braunsbedra near Halle.|$|R
5|$|Many more {{hotels and}} {{restaurants}} were constructed in the remaining years of Boeckling's tenure, including Hotel Cedars, White House Hotel, Crystal Rock Castle, and Crystal Gardens Ballroom. The Cyclone, a rickety and rough coaster, was built in 1926. Cedar Point continued to update its ride attractions, replacing the Racer, the Circle Swing, and many other rides {{to make way for}} a Shoot-the-Chutes water ride, a Tilt-A-Whirl, and fun houses such as Noah's Ark and Bluebeard's Palace. Boeckling's health began to deteriorate in the late 1920s. In 1931, Boeckling became confined to a wheelchair, but he continued to oversee park operations, and was pushed around Cedar Point by an employee or relative. His condition worsened, however, and he eventually had to remain indoors. Boeckling died on July 24, 1931 from uremia. His portrait in <b>the</b> <b>lobby</b> <b>of</b> Breakers Hotel was draped in black. Flags in the resort and on the G.A. Boeckling steamboat were lowered to half mast.|$|E
5|$|On {{the morning}} of September 27, Anderson left his camp with about 75 men to scout for Union forces. They soon arrived at {{the small town of}} Centralia and {{proceeded}} to loot it, robbing people and searching the town for valuables. They found a large supply of whiskey and all began drinking. Anderson retreated into <b>the</b> <b>lobby</b> <b>of</b> the town hotel to drink and rest. A stagecoach soon arrived, and Anderson's men robbed the passengers, including Congressman James S. Rollins and a plainclothes sheriff. The two were prominent Unionists, and hid their identities from the guerrillas. As the guerrillas robbed the stagecoach passengers, a train arrived. The guerrillas blocked the railroad, forcing the train to stop. Anderson's men quickly took control of the train, which included 23 off-duty Union soldiers as passengers. This was the first capture of a Union passenger train in the war.|$|E
5|$|Reagan's casket, a Marsellus Masterpiece model, {{was carried}} by a {{military}} honor guard representing all branches of the United States Armed Forces into <b>the</b> <b>lobby</b> <b>of</b> the library to lie in repose. There, a brief family service was conducted by the Reverend Dr. Michael H. Wenning, former pastor of Bel Air Church, where Reagan worshipped. When the prayer service concluded, Nancy Reagan and her family approached the casket, where Nancy laid her head on it. After the family left, {{the doors of the}} presidential library opened, and the public began filing in at a rate of 2,000 an hour throughout the night. In all, about 108,000 people visited the presidential library to see the casket.|$|E

5|$|Trump {{was granted}} {{permission}} by the City of New York {{to build the}} top 20 stories of the building in exchange for operating the atrium as a city-administered privately owned public space. In <b>the</b> <b>lobby</b> <b>of</b> the building are two Trump merchandise kiosks (one of which replaced a long public bench) operating out of compliance with city regulations. The city issued a notice of violation in July 2015, demanding the bench be put back in place. Although the Trump Organization initially said that the violation was without merit, a lawyer speaking for Trump's organization stated in January 2016 that the kiosks would be removed in two to four weeks, prior to an expected court ruling.|$|E
5|$|In Hyderabad, Gautham accidentally spoils Sameera's {{birthday}} plans, infuriating her. Although he {{is convinced}} {{that he has made}} up an enemy to cope with being an orphan, a mysterious person tries to kill Sameera. Gautham saves her and proposes marriage, which she accepts. Sameera learns that the mysterious person is Antonio Rosarios, a Goa-based crime boss who wants to kill her because she tried to expose the presence of hydrogen cyanide in seeds sold by Rosarios' company, AG1. Gautham meets Rosarios in <b>the</b> <b>lobby</b> <b>of</b> Sameera's office building. Assuming that he is an illusion, he shoots Rosarios in his head. By the time Gautham realises Rosarios is real he is dead, and Gautham learns that his parents were murdered. He catches an aged taxi driver who was stalking him (one of the three men he imagined), and learns that two London-based Indians (one of whom was Rosarios) killed his parents; his father gave the taxi driver a bag to give to Gautham. In the bag is an old Rubik's Cube, a key and a British coin.|$|E
