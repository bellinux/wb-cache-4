5|$|<b>Transport</b> <b>links</b> {{generally}} {{are regarded as}} an important factor which affects a company’s decision on where to locate, and thus invest, although the latest survey shows quality of telecommunications moving above transport in importance. Survey evidence indicates that a quarter of companies regard access to air services as {{an important factor in}} the decision of where in the UK to locate operations, whilst one in ten companies report that the absence of good air <b>transport</b> <b>links</b> has affected their decision to invest in the UK. The survey has been criticised as suffering from a poor response rate and therefore open to bias, though this issue has been recognised and rationalised by the report's authors.|$|E

5|$|Pakistan, {{attempting}} {{to force the}} issue of Kashmir's accession, cut off supplies and <b>transport</b> <b>links.</b> The chaos in Punjab resulting from Partition had also severed <b>transport</b> <b>links</b> with India, meaning that Kashmir's only links with the two dominions was by air. Rumours about atrocities against the Muslim population of Poonch by the Maharajah's forces caused the outbreak of civil unrest. Shortly thereafter, Pathan tribesmen from the North-West Frontier Province of Pakistan crossed the border and entered Kashmir. The invaders made rapid progress towards Srinagar. The Maharaja of Kashmir wrote to India, asking for military assistance. India required the signing of an Instrument of Accession and setting up an interim government headed by Sheikh Abdullah in return. The Maharaja complied, but Nehru declared {{that it would have}} to be confirmed by a plebiscite, although there was no legal requirement to seek such confirmation.|$|E

5|$|The 1930s road follows Telford's road {{as far as}} Bridge of Orchy, then runs to {{the east}} of Loch Tulla, while the old road runs to the other side.

5|$|The only {{region that}} has a {{significant}} difference {{from the rest of}} Wales is the Gower peninsula, whose lack of land <b>transport</b> <b>links</b> left it isolated.

5|$|Brussels {{also has}} better <b>transport</b> <b>links</b> than Strasbourg, with lower pay for civil {{servants}} which reduce costs. Some commentators further underline that night-life in Strasbourg is comparatively lacklustre and that MEPs who'd wish to relax {{after a long}} and hard working day aren't offered many opportunities to do so. The position of Strasbourg suffered a minor blow in 2006, when allegations surfaced over charges {{by the city of}} Strasbourg on buildings the Parliament was renting.

5|$|Due to the {{geological}} {{layout of the}} Rhondda Valley, <b>transport</b> <b>links</b> are fairly restrictive. The original road layout followed the valleys with few connections between them. In the 1920s, a major unemployment relief programme for out of work miners was created to build mountain roads connecting communities together. The mountain roads had a lasting effect and transformed the valleys from being dead-end communities. In the late 20th and early 21st century, new road projects such as the Rhondda by-pass have been created out of former railway lines.|$|E
5|$|In the 18th century Richmond and {{neighbouring}} Twickenham on {{the opposite}} bank of the Thames, {{both of which were}} distant from London but enjoyed efficient <b>transport</b> <b>links</b> to the city via the river, became extremely fashionable, and their populations began to grow rapidly. As the ferry was unable to handle large loads and was often cancelled due to weather conditions, the river crossing became a major traffic bottleneck.|$|E
5|$|Mining {{subsidence}} {{coupled with}} structural and political {{changes to the}} mining industry began the decline in Astley's industrial activities during the mid-20th century; its cotton mill closed in 1955, and the last coal {{was brought to the}} surface in 1970. However, Astley has grown as part of a commuter belt, supported by its proximity to Manchester city centre and inter-city <b>transport</b> <b>links.</b> Astley Green Colliery Museum houses collections of Astley's industrial heritage.|$|E
