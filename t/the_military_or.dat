5|$|Males having short, cut hair {{are in many}} {{cultures}} viewed as being under society's control, such as while in <b>the</b> <b>military</b> <b>or</b> prison or as punishment for a crime.

5|$|Obligatory {{psychological}} {{testing for}} gun owners {{is a common}} subject of discussion, but {{it has always been}} rejected. Gun advocates point out that the nature of the tests and the parties responsible for them are not clear. It is also pointed out that it is unlikely that any psychological testing would reveal a potentially dangerous individual, because some famous killers in the past were members of <b>the</b> <b>military</b> <b>or</b> the law enforcement and passed very difficult psychological testing successfully.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{outbreak}} of the Second World War, Duigan desired command of the Second New Zealand Expeditionary Force (2NZEF), which was to be raised for service in Europe. Lack of command experience and his performance as CGS meant that he was not a popular choice within <b>the</b> <b>military</b> <b>or</b> the New Zealand Government. Major General Bernard Freyberg was instead appointed commander of 2NZEF, and Duigan's term as CGS was extended. Throughout 1940, Duigan worked to ensure the continued support and reinforcement of 2NZEF, and oversaw the reintroduction of conscription. He also attended defence conferences in Singapore and India, and made tours of the 2NZEF while it was in the Middle East.|$|E
5|$|Ordinary {{soldiers}} were merely recruited or conscripted rural farmers, while surrendered bandits and mercenaries also joined the military. Soldiers were not awarded official status by Confucian scholars {{as belonging to}} one of the Four Occupations; the scholar-officials were wary of condoning or legitimizing those whose lives revolved around the uncivilized practices of wu (violence). Even though the military examinations, rankings, and posts were parallel to those of the civil order, scholar-officials and the gentry nonetheless viewed military pursuits as uncultivated. Despite this disdain and argument of moral high ground, scholar-officials often commanded troops and wielded military power. Yet scholar-officials were not at the apex of <b>the</b> <b>military</b> <b>or</b> even civilian order; at the pinnacle of society was the emperor. The emperor's use of violence was seen as a necessity to rein in rebellious elements of society and dominate violent and uncultivated Inner Asian tribes, who would then submit to the emperor and become transformed by China's superior wen (culture and civilization).|$|E

5|$|The 95th Division {{was first}} {{constituted}} on 4 September 1918 {{in the national}} army. It was organized that month at Camp Sherman, Ohio. The division was organized with the 189th Infantry Brigade and the 190th Infantry Brigade of the Oklahoma organized reserve. The division was slated to be deployed overseas to fight in World War I. Training {{of all of the}} division's units began immediately. On 11 November, the Armistice with Germany was signed, ending the hostilities. The division's deployment was cancelled and it was demobilized in December 1918. All of the division's officers and enlisted men were discharged from <b>the</b> <b>military</b> <b>or</b> transferred to other units. On 24 June 1921, the division was reactivated in the organized reserves. From that point until 1942, the division remained as a reserve unit based in Oklahoma City.|$|E
5|$|The {{northern}} {{economy was}} decentralized for its protection and large factories, {{located in the}} heavily populated Red River Delta region, were broken up and scattered into caves and small villages throughout the countryside. In the more heavily bombed southern panhandle, entire villages moved into underground tunnel complexes for the duration. Food shortages in North Vietnam became widespread, especially in the urban areas, as rice farmers went into <b>the</b> <b>military</b> <b>or</b> volunteered for service repairing bomb damage. When the nation's transportation system came under attack, destroyed bridges were repaired or replaced by dirt fords, ferries, and underwater or pontoon bridges. The system proved to be durable, well built, easily repaired, and practically impossible to shut down.|$|E

25|$|Another {{powerful}} {{tactic of}} nonviolent intervention invokes public {{scrutiny of the}} oppressors {{as a result of}} the resisters remaining nonviolent in the face of violent repression. If <b>the</b> <b>military</b> <b>or</b> police attempt to repress nonviolent resisters violently, the power to act shifts from the hands of the oppressors to those of the resisters. If the resisters are persistent, <b>the</b> <b>military</b> <b>or</b> police will be forced to accept the fact that they no longer have any power over the resisters. Often, the willingness of the resisters to suffer has a profound effect on the mind and emotions of the oppressor, leaving them unable to commit such a violent act again.|$|E
