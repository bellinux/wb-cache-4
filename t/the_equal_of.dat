5|$|During World War I, a {{large number}} of pre-dreadnoughts {{remained}} in service. The advances in machinery and armament meant that a pre-dreadnought was not necessarily <b>the</b> <b>equal</b> <b>of</b> even a modern armoured cruiser, and was totally outclassed by a modern dreadnought battleship or battlecruiser. Nevertheless, the pre-dreadnought {{played a major role in}} the war.|$|E
5|$|Edward Somerset made minor {{improvements}} to {{the interior of the}} castle {{at the start of the}} 17th century, but focused primarily on the exterior, expanding and developing the gardens and building the moat walk around the Great Tower.

5|$|Adams {{appointed}} two U.S. Supreme Court associate justices {{during his}} term in office: Bushrod Washington, {{the nephew of}} American founding father and President George Washington, to succeed James Wilson; and Alfred Moore, who succeeded James Iredell. He also named John Marshall as the fourth Chief Justice of the United States, replacing Oliver Ellsworth, who had retired due to ill health. Marshall's long tenure represents the most lasting influence of the Federalists, as he infused the Constitution with a judicious and carefully reasoned nationalistic interpretation and established the Judicial Branch as <b>the</b> <b>equal</b> <b>of</b> the Executive and Legislative branches.|$|E

5|$|Infighting between Barclay's {{subordinates}} repeatedly {{prevented the}} Russian commander from committing his forces to battle. Barclay's fellow generals and the Russian court viewed the constant retreat as {{a reluctance to}} fight; consequently, he was removed from command and replaced by Prince Mikhail Kutuzov on 29 August 1812. Although the 67-year-old General Kutuzov was not seen by his contemporaries as <b>the</b> <b>equal</b> <b>of</b> Napoleon, he possessed the ability to muster a good defence. He was favoured over Barclay because he was Russian whereas Barclay was of Scottish descent and officers subordinate to Barclay could accept Kutuzov, thereby uniting the army. On 18 August Kutuzov arrived at Sarevo to greet the army.|$|E
5|$|The founders' {{ambition}} was {{to build}} an orchestra <b>the</b> <b>equal</b> <b>of</b> any European or American rival. Between 1932 and the Second World War the LPO was widely judged to have succeeded in this regard. After the outbreak of war the orchestra's private backers withdrew and the players reconstituted the LPO as a self-governing cooperative. In the post-war years the orchestra faced challenges from two new rivals; the Philharmonia and the Royal Philharmonic, founded respectively in 1946 and 1947, achieved a quality of playing not matched by the older orchestras, including the LPO.|$|E

Though an independent city {{rather than a}} county, the City of Baltimore is considered <b>the</b> <b>equal</b> <b>of</b> a county for most purposes and is a county-equivalent. Many of the counties in Maryland were named for relatives of the Barons Baltimore who were the proprietors of the Maryland colony from its founding in 1634 through 1771. The Barons Baltimore were Catholic, and George Calvert, 1st Baron Baltimore, originally intended that the colony be a haven for English Catholics, though {{for most of its}} history Maryland has had a majority of Protestants.|$|E

5|$|William Harrison Ainsworth, a Victorian novelist {{considered}} {{in his day}} <b>the</b> <b>equal</b> <b>of</b> Dickens, wrote a romanticised account of the Pendle witches published in 1849. The Lancashire Witches {{is the only one}} of his 40 novels never to have been out of print. The British writer Robert Neill dramatised the events of 1612 in his novel Mist over Pendle, first published in 1951. The writer and poet Blake Morrison treated the subject in his suite of poems Pendle Witches, published in 1996, and in 2011 poet Simon Armitage narrated a documentary on BBC Four, The Pendle Witch Child.|$|E
5|$|Godley's II ANZAC Corps {{consisted}} of the Australian 4th and 5th Divisions along with the ANZAC Mounted Division, and it took over the defensive duties of the I ANZAC Corps. The two Australian divisions were still relatively raw and Godley oversaw the intensive training of both formations. By the end of May 1916, he considered the divisions to be <b>the</b> <b>equal</b> <b>of</b> the 1st and 2nd Australian divisions, which were by that time on the Western Front. The following month, the divisions of II ANZAC Corps began departing for France. Godley went on leave {{for a short time}} during this period of transition for his corps. In July, he returned to duty and II ANZAC Corps took over the section of the front line previously occupied by the I ANZAC Corps, near Armentieres. Later that same month, the 5th Division participated in the Battle of Fromelles in support of the neighbouring British XI Corps. It, together with the 4th Division, would later be transferred to the Somme.|$|E
5|$|In 1960 Solti {{signed a}} three-year {{contract}} to be {{music director of the}} Los Angeles Philharmonic from 1962. Even before he took the post the Philharmonic's autocratic president, Dorothy Chandler, breached his contract by appointing a deputy music director without Solti's approval. Although he admired the chosen deputy, Zubin Mehta, Solti felt he could not have his authority undermined from the outset, and he withdrew from his appointment. He accepted an offer to become musical director of Covent Garden Opera Company, London. When first sounded out about the post he had declined it. After 14 years of experience at Munich and Frankfurt he was uncertain that he wanted a third successive operatic post. Moreover, founded only 15 years earlier, the Covent Garden company was not yet <b>the</b> <b>equal</b> <b>of</b> the best opera houses in Europe. Bruno Walter convinced Solti that it was his duty to take Covent Garden on.|$|E

5|$|In 1969, Chadwick was {{appointed}} Dean of Christ Church, uniquely a dual {{role as a}} cathedral dean and head of a college. This period was not entirely happy; a scholarly ability to see all sides of a question, along with an ingrained desire not to upset his colleagues, sometimes made it {{hard for him to}} make a quick or firm decision. However, during his time as Dean the college benefited from a continued programme of renovation with internal changes that provided more student accommodation. The position gave Chadwick the chance to influence the musical direction of the cathedral. In The Independent newspaper, obituary writer Andrew Louth notes that at the retirement of Sydney Watson as organist, when he and Chadwick played piano duets together Chadwick's technique was <b>the</b> <b>equal</b> <b>of</b> Watson's. The new organist, Simon Preston, had ambitious plans for improving musical standards, and Chadwick was pleased to be able to support these, not least by raising funds for a new organ.|$|E
5|$|The CDF is {{the most}} senior {{appointment}} in the ADF. The CDF commands the ADF, and is notionally <b>the</b> <b>equal</b> <b>of</b> the Secretary of Defence, the most senior public servant in the Department of Defence. The CDF is the only four-star officer in the ADF and is a general, admiral or air chief marshal. As well as having command responsibilities, the CDF is the Minister for Defence's principal military adviser. Air Chief Marshal Mark Binskin is the current CDF, and assumed this position on 30 June 2014. Hugh White, a prominent academic and former Deputy Secretary in the Department of Defence, has criticised the ADF's current command structure. White argues that the Minister plays too large a role in military decision-making and does not provide the CDF and Secretary of Defence with necessary and sufficient authority to manage the ADO effectively.|$|E
5|$|The area {{surrounding}} Bodiam Castle was landscaped {{when the}} castle was built, {{to increase its}} aesthetic appeal. Archaeologists Oliver Creighton and Robert Higham have described Bodiam {{as one of the}} best examples of landscaping to emphasise a castle. The water features were originally extensive, but only the moat survives, along with the earthworks left over from its construction. Roughly rectangular, the moat is supplied by several springs, some of them within it, which made it difficult to drain during the excavations of the 1930s. A moat can prevent attackers from gaining access to the base of a castle's walls, but in the case of Bodiam it also had the effect of making the castle appear larger and more impressive by isolating it in its landscape. The moat is now regarded more as an ornamental feature than a defence. The approach to the castle through the moat and satellite ponds was indirect, giving visitors time to view the castle in its intended splendour. Military historian Cathcart King describes the approach as formidable, and considers it <b>the</b> <b>equal</b> <b>of</b> the 13th-century castles of Edward I in Wales, such as Caerphilly Castle.|$|E

5|$|Until {{the twelfth}} century, {{education}} within the Byzantine Greek population was {{more advanced than}} in the West, particularly at primary school level, resulting in comparatively high literacy rates. Success came easily to Byzantine Greek merchants, who enjoyed a very strong position in international trade. Despite the challenges posed by rival Italian merchants, they held their own throughout {{the latter half of}} the Byzantine Empire's existence. The clergy also held a special place, not only having more freedom than their Western counterparts, but also maintaining a patriarch in Constantinople who was considered <b>the</b> <b>equal</b> <b>of</b> the pope. This position of strength had built up over time, for at the beginning of the Byzantine Empire, under Emperor Constantine the Great (r. 306–337), only a small part, about 10%, of the population was Christian.|$|E
5|$|Prior to Adams' performances, finger billiards {{had been}} {{demonstrated}} in New York by French player M. Adrien Izar, who had astonished spectators with an exhibition held on September 20, 1875, before which the game was little known in the United States. In France and England, Izar was considered the game's champion player. The night before his 1878 exhibition, Adams received a telegram in which Izar challenged him {{to play for the}} championship and named Chicago as the venue for contest. Adams replied that he was unwilling to leave New York at that time, but that he would pay Izar's expenses to travel to New York. Adams later issued the following statement to newspapers:I have never intended to play a public match in my line, having never arrogated to myself a superiority above other hand billiard players, although I have deemed myself <b>the</b> <b>equal</b> <b>of</b> any one living in my line, not excepting Mons. Izar, by whom continually letters are written, whose contents have for their purpose a derogation of my skill. That this may be checked, and summarily, I would state that I am willing to play Mons. Izar a match game for $500 a side, in New York City, Boston or Chicago, on a 5x10 table, full size balls and Collender cushion; the championship and gate money to be awarded the player showing the greatest variety of shots in connection with accuracy, and in all giving the most interesting exhibition of finger billiards.|$|E
5|$|Though Cleeve was by {{no means}} a wealthy house, the monks were able to make {{significant}} investment in remodelling their home so as to match the rising living standards of the later mediaeval period. In the fourteenth-century elaborate polychrome tiled floors (an expensive and high status product) were laid throughout the abbey and in the mid-fifteenth century radical works were undertaken. A wooden shelter was constructed over the tiled floor in 2016. Abbot David Juyner (r.1435–87) commissioned a complete redesign of the south range of the monastery. He demolished the old refectory and built a new one parallel to the cloister on the first floor. This grand chamber with its wooden vaulted ceiling (carved with angels) was <b>the</b> <b>equal</b> <b>of</b> the hall of any contemporary secular lord. Beneath it he built several self-contained apartments. These were probably used by corrodians, pensioners of the abbey. Juyner may also have been responsible for decorating the abbey with wall paintings of religious and allegorical subjects. Some of these wall paintings survive. As well as one depicting the Crucifixion, there is an arrangement of St Catherine and St Margaret on either side of, and facing, a man standing on a bridge: the bridge is over water full of fish, and the man has an angel on either side of his head, and is being attacked by a lion to his left on the bridge, and a dragon to his right. Work continued under Juyner's successors to the eve of the Dissolution. The last building work to be completed was the remodelling of the gatehouse, performed after 1510, though as late as 1534 the monks were engaged in a major project of renewing the cloister walks in the latest fashion. As at the neighbouring house of Forde Abbey, this was never completed, due to the dissolution of the abbey.|$|E
