5|$|Although the Loons were afforded {{respect as}} {{principal}} peace chiefs, this status was not permanent. The Cranes, led in Buffalo's time by his sub-chief Tagwagane, maintained {{that they were}} the hereditary chiefs. <b>They</b> <b>said</b> <b>the</b> Loons' status as spokesmen hinged upon recognition by the Cranes. A chief's power in Ojibwa society was based on persuasion and consensus; it was contingent, holding only as long as the community of elders, including the women, chose to respect and follow the chief's lead.|$|E
5|$|In May, 2011 {{more than}} 2,000 of the {{estimated}} 8,000 investors who lost money {{in the collapse of}} GSL took legal action seeking damages from Great Southern. <b>They</b> <b>said</b> <b>the</b> company did not disclose the risks associated with managed investment schemes and the company's poor financial performance. The action also sought to question Bendigo and Adelaide Bank, Javelin Asset Management and Great Southern Finance as to why they issued loans to investors in Great Southern.|$|E

For an unknown reason, the street's name was not changed to Woodland Avenue, but to Milwaukee Avenue. The Avenue's {{proximity}} to the Milwaukee Short Line Railroad has been suggested as a cause.|$|E

5|$|According to Bayliss, the dog {{had been}} given a {{morphine}} injection earlier in the day, then was anaesthetized during the procedure with six fluid ounces of alcohol, chloroform and ether (ACE), delivered from an ante-room to a tube in his trachea, via a pipe hidden behind the bench on which the men were working. The Swedish students disputed that {{the dog had}} been adequately anaesthetized. <b>They</b> <b>said</b> <b>the</b> dog had appeared conscious during the procedure, had tried to lift himself off the board, {{and that there was no}} smell of anaesthesia or the usual hissing sound of the apparatus. Other students said the dog had not struggled, but had merely twitched.|$|E
5|$|Curtis, {{with the}} backing of Massachusetts Governor Calvin Coolidge, {{rejected}} the Storrow Commission's proposal. He proceeded with department trials of the 19 and on September 8 found them guilty of union activity. Rather than dismiss them from the police force, he extended their suspensions. He later explained that he was giving them an opportunity to reconsider their actions and avoid discharges, which would have been irrevocable. The police union members responded that same day by voting 1134 to 2 in favor of a strike and scheduled it to start at evening roll call the next day. Their stated grounds omitted wages and working conditions. <b>They</b> <b>said</b> <b>the</b> strike's rationale was to protest the Commissioner's denial of their right to ally themselves with the AFL.|$|E
5|$|In 2008 The Scientific World Journal {{published}} research {{in which women}} with long-term problems achieving orgasm were instructed using documentation from Betty Dodson. <b>They</b> <b>said</b> <b>the</b> Magic Wand's large head effectively created a vibrating sensation {{in the area of}} the clitoris and vulva without superficial discomfort. Their research showed that more than 93% of a group of 500 chronically anorgasmic women could reach orgasm using Magic Wand and the Betty Dodson Method. The Scientific World Journal research was subsequently discussed in a literature review published in 2010 by The Journal of Sexual Medicine. Bat Sheva Marcus published a 2011 article in The Journal of Sexual Medicine after introducing women to the Magic Wand as a way to increase her subjects' levels of sexual experience and assess changes in their sexual expectations.|$|E

5|$|Planet Moon Studios' {{blending}} of two genres in Giants {{has earned the}} acclaim of reviewers. Game Revolution and GameSpot found the simplified real-time strategy task of resource gathering in Giants more interesting than tedious, and Troy Dunniway, Microsoft's Head of Game Design in 2002, commented that the real-time strategy elements enhanced the game's shooter aspect rather than making it a hybrid of two genres. Sci Fi Weekly was impressed that both styles of play never interfered with each other, which was complemented by the unique gameplay of each race. The Entertainment Depot, however, found the base building in several missions tedious; <b>they</b> <b>said</b> <b>the</b> player had to rebuild the base several times due to being forced to leave the base defenseless, which allowed the enemy destroy the structures.|$|E
5|$|In 1998, Murray Hill Publishing sued 20th Century Fox for $150,000, {{claiming}} that {{the idea for the}} film was stolen from a screenplay they had purchased from high school teacher Brian Webster entitled Could This Be Christmas?. <b>They</b> <b>said</b> <b>the</b> script had 36 similarities with Jingle All the Way, including the plot, dialogue and character names. Murray Hill President Bob Laurel bought the script from Webster in 1993, and sent it to Fox and other studios in 1994 but received no response and claimed the idea was copied by Kornfield, who was Fox's script reader. In 2001, Fox were found guilty of stealing the idea and ordered to pay $19 million ($15 million in damages and $4 million in legal costs) to Murray Hill, with Webster to receive a portion. Laurel died {{a few months after the}} verdict, before receiving any of the money. On appeal, the damages figure was lowered to $1.5 million, before the verdict itself was quashed in 2004 after a judge decided the idea was not stolen, as Fox had bought Kornfield's screenplay before he or anybody else at Fox had read Could This Be Christmas?.|$|E
5|$|The {{number of}} {{passengers}} decreased from 12.3 million passengers in 1947 to 4.4 million in 1949, due to passengers switching from SIRT to city-operated buses due to a bus fare cut. On September 5, 1948, 237 of the previous 492 weekday trains were cut; the express service would be reduced during rush hours, and all night trains after 1:29 A. M. would be cancelled. Thirty percent of the company's personnel were laid off. On September 7, 1948, Staten Island Borough President Cornelius Hall continued to rally against the cuts made by the SIRT at a Public Service Commission hearing in Manhattan. Commuters testified that trains were missing connections to ferry boats and that some trains were being held at the Saint George Terminal in the rush hour to wait for two boatloads of passengers. Previously, <b>they</b> <b>said,</b> <b>the</b> trains pulled out with only one boatload of passengers. On September 13, 1948, the SIRT agreed to add four trains, and to extend the schedule of four others. On September 22, 1948, the Interstate Commerce Commission allowed the SIRT to abandon the ferry it had operated for 88 years between Tottenville and Perth Amboy, New Jersey; the ferry operation was transferred to Sunrise Ferries, Inc of Elizabeth, New Jersey on October 16.|$|E

25|$|<b>They</b> <b>said</b> <b>the</b> investors' victory {{rate was}} {{misleading}} {{as a measure}} of arbitration's effectiveness since they often merely reimbursed investors for their losses, most of which then went to pay legal bills, and did not include punitive damages such as a court might award that could deter future misconduct. Nor did investors arbitrating claims have access to the full range of procedures they would in court. They could not force the brokerage to produce evidence, and they often charged that the brokerages falsified or improperly withheld documents. Arbitrators also did not have to provide a written explanation for their decisions.|$|E
25|$|If adopted, the Bill would mount {{a serious}} {{challenge}} to the continued deployment of nuclear weapons throughout the world's oceans. The New Zealand Nuclear Free Zone Extension bill lost its second reading on 29 May 2002. Opposition to amending New Zealand's anti-nuclear legislation came from the New Zealand Labour Party, who say that implementing the detail would be impossible and could make the proposed new legislation unenforceable. <b>They</b> <b>said</b> <b>the</b> bill breaches a fundamental principle of the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, which requires all countries to allow freedom of navigation through their EEZs. However, anti-nuclear activists remain confident that the amendments to New Zealand's nuclear legislation will eventually pass, citing grey areas {{of the law in}} the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea. There is a firm belief amongst New Zealanders, as indicated by polls, that New Zealand must take leadership on this vital International issue.|$|E
25|$|The IDF stated on 31 July {{that more}} than 280 Hamas rockets malfunctioned and fell inside the Gaza strip, hitting sites {{including}} Al-Shifa Hospital and the Al-Shati refugee camp, killing at least 11 and wounding dozens. Hamas denied that any of its rockets hit the Gaza Strip., but Palestinian sources said numerous rocket launches ended up falling in Gaza communities and that scores {{of people have been}} killed or injured. Israeli Military sources said the failed Hamas launches increased amid heavy Israeli air and artillery strikes throughout the Gaza Strip. <b>They</b> <b>said</b> <b>the</b> failed launches reflected poorly-assembled rockets as well as the rush to load and fire projectiles before they are spotted by Israeli aircraft. While the Al-Shifa Hospital incident is disputed, early news reports have suggested that the strike was from an Israeli drone missile. Amnesty International concluded that the explosion at the Shati refugee camp on 28 July in which 13 civilians were killed was caused by a Palestinian rocket, despite Palestinian claims it was an Israeli missile.|$|E
