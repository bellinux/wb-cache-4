All constructs have shown to be able to provide at least logical concurrency, but the constructs have fundamental differences. Selecting a solution that is tailored to a specific problem involves analyzing the domain, requirements and constraints for a given problem. <b>This</b> <b>thesis</b> <b>uses</b> a subset of requirements engineering to define a requirements analysis method that is used to assess the constructs with respect to the problem to obtain the solutions and their suitability for the given problem. In this thesis, the method is used to assess three concurrency solutions: cyclic scheduling, threads, processes and an event-handling framework.
