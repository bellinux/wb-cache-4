5|$|Despite his {{prominent}} {{position in}} the Nguyễn Dynasty, {{little is known about}} Phan's personal stance on Vietnamese relations with France, which {{was in the process of}} colonising Vietnam. France had first invaded in 1858, beginning the colonisation of southern Vietnam. Three provinces were ceded under the 1862 Treaty of Saigon, and a further three in 1867 to form the colony of Cochinchina. During the period, there was debate in the Huế court on <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>strategy</b> to regain the territory. One group advocated military means, while another believed in the use of diplomacy in addition to financial and religious concessions. By the time of Tự Đức's death in 1883, the whole of Vietnam was colonised, henceforth incorporated with Laos and Cambodia into French Indochina.|$|E

5|$|In 1964, the {{political}} establishment in South Vietnam was still in turmoil. Following the coup that ousted Ngô Đình Diệm, the military situation quickly worsened as the Viet Cong gained significant ground in the countryside because the Military Revolutionary Council which governed South Vietnam, lacked direction {{both in terms of}} policy and planning. Furthermore, General Dương Văn Minh, as the Chairman of the Military Revolutionary Council, and his civilian Prime Minister Nguyễn Ngọc Thơ favoured a political resolution instead of using military force, which brought them into conflict with the United States over <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>strategy</b> to end the Communist threat in South Vietnam. As a result, both men became increasingly unpopular among the military generals who held real political power in Saigon. On January 30, 1964, General Nguyễn Khánh successfully ousted Dương Văn Minh from the Military Revolutionary Council without firing a single shot. For much of the year, Khánh spent most of his efforts on consolidating political power, instead of fighting the Viet Cong.|$|E
5|$|In {{contrast}} to the political unrest in Saigon, the Communist leadership in North Vietnam were far more concerned about <b>the</b> <b>best</b> <b>strategy</b> to fight the South Vietnamese government and their American supporters. While all leaders in Hanoi shared the same goal of eventual reunification of their homeland, different factions within the Communist Party disagreed on the best method to achieve their desired goal. Members of North Vietnam's Politburo were divided by the issues surrounding the Soviet strategy of peaceful co-existence versus the Chinese strategy of supporting national liberation movements in emerging countries. Despite their differences of opinion, the Communist Party leadership ultimately made preparations for armed struggle in South Vietnam. From Hanoi's perspective, the military regime in Saigon was able to hold out because the Communist main forces were still not ready to fight a conventional war, so North Vietnam must focus {{on the development of}} its military force in the shortest period of time. In the meantime, however, the war must be kept at its current level in order to prevent the full involvement of the United States military.|$|E

Following the ousting of President Ngô Đình Diệm in 1963, South Vietnam's top army generals {{continued}} to vie with each other for control of the country’s military-dominated government instead of combating the emerging forces of the National Liberation Front, also known as the Viet Cong. The fragility of the South Vietnamese government was reflected on the battlefield, where its military experienced great setbacks against the Viet Cong. Taking advantage of Saigon's political instability, Communist leaders in Hanoi began preparing for war.

25|$|The Australian painted lady's {{mating system}} evolved {{due to a}} highly {{dispersed}} female population.

The United States, with the larger U.S. Army, favoured a more direct method of fighting the main force of the German Army in Northwestern Europe.

25|$|Like {{all other}} hymenopterans, P. colobopterus is haplodiploid. This means that unfertilized eggs will produce males, while fertilized eggs will produce females.

Since each worker would be more closely related to her son than the male offspring of any other workers, it may be expected that the production of males would be a major source of conflict.

40|$|ABSTRACT: The current {{paper is}} an attempt to find a {{sustainable}} fuel strategy for passenger cars in Iran. Currently, most of Iran’s passenger cars consume gasoline, a non-renewable fossil fuel. This fuel has well-known environmental impacts, including various kinds of pollutions, as well as the threat of quick running out. These general negative characteristics of gasoline are amplified by the high consumption rate of Iran’s transportation sector, (e. g. about three times more than that of UK). The objective of this paper is firstly selecting possible alternative fuels for Iran’s transportation sector, and then proposing the percent of cars consuming these alternative fuels (along with gasoline). <b>The</b> <b>best</b> <b>strategies</b> are proposed based on environmental and economic considerations, and hence are more sustainable decisions comparing with <b>the</b> other <b>strategies.</b> <b>The</b> <b>best</b> <b>strategies</b> are found using partial order theory and Hasse diagram technique, which is a multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) tool...|$|R
