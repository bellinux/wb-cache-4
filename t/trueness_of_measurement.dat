The training manual complements the training course that was intended {{to improve the quality of}} measurement results obtained when quantifying genetically modified organisms (GMO) in food and feed. Both, the training course and this manual, were developed in line with the current EU GMO legislation. The manual is addressed to laboratory managers and practitioners in analytical laboratories who perform GM quantification measurements and use reference materials for calibration, quality control and method validation including in-house verification. It is also intended for analysts who need to assess measurement uncertainties as required by (EC) No 1829 / 2003, (EC) No 619 / 2011 and ISO/IEC 17025 : 2005. This training document has been written by JRC-IRMM upon request of the European Union Reference Laboratory for Genetically Modified Food and Feed (EURL-GMFF) to further improve the reporting of National Reference Laboratories (NRLs) nominated under Regulation (EC) No 882 / 2004 and official GMO control laboratories within the EU. This manual is organised in four chapters covering the proper calibration of PCR methods, the estimation of measurement uncertainty, the establishment of metrological traceability of a measurement result and the way to prove the <b>trueness</b> <b>of</b> <b>measurement</b> results. The training manual is a didactic support of a previous guidance document that outlines issues related to the estimation of measurement uncertainty (MU) in the GMO sector. The training manual is also in line with the European technical guidance document for the flexible scope accreditation of laboratories quantifying GMOs, that is intended for laboratories that are acquiring or are holding a flexible scope of accreditation according to ISO/IEC 17025.

30|$|Point-of-care {{ultrasound}} images {{should reflect}} patient {{anatomy and physiology}} at a given moment in time. Clinical measurements obtained from ultrasound images, however, {{are known to be}} highly operator-dependent [1]. The <b>trueness</b> <b>of</b> clinical <b>measurements</b> obtained from ultrasound images should, therefore, be a part of assessments of competence in acquiring them [2]. Reference standards of ‘truth’ are hard to come by, however [3]. Advanced imaging, such as computed tomography or magnetic resonance, is not practical for everyday assessments [4], especially since many point-of-care ultrasound targets are dynamic and require contemporaneous reference standards. Thus, after training programs in point-of-care ultrasound, assessments of trainee competence have not been based on clinical measurements but instead on perceived manual skills or image quality. One potential solution is to have instructors acquire ultrasound images on the same patients {{at the same time as}} the trainees under assessment. Clinical measurements obtained from these contemporaneously acquired ultrasound images of an instructor can then serve as reference standards.|$|R

40|$|STATEMENT OF PROBLEM: A new {{approach}} to both 3 -dimensional (3 D) trueness and precision is necessary to assess the accuracy of intraoral digital impressions and compare them to conventionally acquired impressions. PURPOSE: The purpose of this in vitro study was to evaluate whether a new reference scanner is capable of measuring conventional and digital intraoral complete-arch impressions for 3 D accuracy. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A steel reference dentate model was fabricated and measured with a reference scanner (digital reference model). Conventional impressions were made from the reference model, poured with Type IV dental stone, scanned with the reference scanner, and exported as digital models. Additionally, digital impressions of the reference model were made and the digital models were exported. Precision was measured by superimposing the digital models within each group. Superimposing the digital models on the digital reference model assessed the <b>trueness</b> <b>of</b> each impression method. Statistical significance was assessed with an independent sample t test (α=. 05). RESULTS: The reference scanner delivered high accuracy over the entire dental arch with a precision of 1. 6 ± 0. 6 µm and a <b>trueness</b> <b>of</b> 5. 3 ± 1. 1 µm. Conventional impressions showed significantly higher precision (12. 5 ± 2. 5 µm) and trueness values (20. 4 ± 2. 2 µm) with small deviations in the second molar region (P<. 001). Digital impressions were significantly less accurate with a precision of 32. 4 ± 9. 6 µm and a <b>trueness</b> <b>of</b> 58. 6 ± 15. 8 µm (P<. 001). More systematic deviations of the digital models were visible across the entire dental arch.

40|$|The digital {{intraoral}} {{impression is}} a central part in today's CAD/CAM dentistry. With its possibilities, new treatment options for the patient is provided and the prosthetic workflow is accelerated. Nowadays, the major issue with intraoral scanning systems is to gain more accuracy especially for larger scan areas and to simplify clinical handling for the dentist. The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate different scanning strategies regardingtheir accuracy with full arch scans in an in-vitro study design. A reference master model was used for the digital impressions with the Lava COS, the Cerec Bluecam and a powderfree intraoral scanning system, Cadent iTero. The <b>trueness</b> and precision <b>of</b> each scanning protocol was measured. Lava COS provides the a <b>trueness</b> <b>of</b> 45. 8 microm with the scanning protocol recommended from the manufacturer.

40|$|Die Unsicherheit analytischer Ergebnisse lässt Rückschlüsse auf die Zuverlässigkeit der angewandten Analyseverfahren zu. Entsprechend den Qualitätsanforderungen an akkreditierte Prüf- und Kalibrierlaboratorien (siehe u. a. Norm ISO/IEC 17025) ist daher die Angabe der Messunsicherheit erforderlich. Zur Ermittlung der Messunsicherheit typischer FT-IR-spektroskopischer Analysen von Feststoffen und Flüssigkeiten wurde eine systematische Untersuchung des Einflusses zahlreicher FT-, proben- und gerätespezifischer Parameter auf den Messwert durchgeführt. Die Überprüfung der Ordinatenrichtigkeit bei FT-IR-spektroskopischen Messungen an Gläsern erfolgte mit Hilfe eines Transmissionsstandards des National Physical Laboratory (NPL), der aus einem Schott NG 11 Neutralglasfilter besteht, und bei Messungen an Flüssigkeiten durch Vergleich der nach einem Absolutverfahren bestimmten Extinktionskoeffizienten des Dichlormethans mit von der IUPAC publizierten Standardwerten. Nach Optimierung der Messbedingungen stimmen die Transmissionswerte des NPL-Standards und die Extinktionskoeffizienten des Dichlormethans mit den entsprechenden Standardwerten überein. Die für die Bestimmung dieser Messgrößen aufgestellten Unsicherheitsbilanzen gestatten die {{quantitative}} Abschätzung des Einflusses einzelner Parameter auf die Gesamtunsicherheit. Bei Anwendung der KBr-Presstechnik für die quantitative Analyse von unlöslichen Feststoffen haben die Partikelgröße des Analyten und die Homogenität der Presslinge einen dominierenden Einfluss auf die Qualität der Spektren. Um die Unsicherheit zu minimieren, die auf dem Einfluss der Partikelgröße beruht, muss es ein Ziel der Probenvorbereitung sein, dass die Partikeldurchmesser der Kalibriersubstanz und des Analyten einen Wert von ca. 2 µm nicht überschreiten und möglichst gleich groß sind. Bei Untersuchungen mit Calciumcarbonat-Proben unterschiedlicher Partikeldurchmesser hat sich die Halbwertsbreite der auszuwertenden Bande, die mit der Partikelgröße korreliert, als ein geeignetes Maß für die Beurteilung erwiesen, wie gut letztere Bedingung erfüllt ist. Eine inhomogene Verteilung der absorbierenden Partikel im Pressling kann durch Durchstrahlen der gesamten Oberfläche des Presslings oder durch Mitteln der an verschiedenen Positionen des Presslings gemessenen Spektren berücksichtigt werden. Diese Arbeiten zeigen, dass die Anwendung der KBr-Presstechnik bei sorgfältiger Probenvorbereitung und Einhaltung optimaler Messbedingungen im Rahmen der Messunsicherheit zu richtigen Ergebnissen führt. The {{uncertainty of}} analytical results allows {{to assess the}} reliability of the applied analytical methods. According to quality requirements for accredited laboratories (see e. g. ISO/IEC 17025) it is necessary to report the uncertainty <b>of</b> <b>measurement.</b> In order to evaluate the uncertainty of typical quantitative FT-IR spectroscopic analysis of solids and liquids a detailed study of the influence of numerous FT-, sample- and instrument-specific parameters on the measurand was performed. The <b>trueness</b> <b>of</b> FT-IR spectroscopic <b>measurements</b> on glasses was tested with a transmittance standard of the National Physical Laboratory (NPL) that consists of a Schott NG 11 neutral density filter. The <b>trueness</b> <b>of</b> FT-IR spectroscopic <b>measurements</b> on liquids was checked by the comparison of the molar absorptivities of dichloromethane determined by transmission measurements with the standard values published by IUPAC. After optimisation <b>of</b> the <b>measurement</b> conditions the transmittance values of the NPL standard and the molar absorptivities of dichloromethane are in accordance with the corresponding standard values. The uncertainty budgets evaluated for these measurends makes it possible to assess the contribution of a single parameter on the combined uncertainty. By using the KBr pressed pellet technique for the quantitative analysis of insoluble solids the particle size of the analyte and the homogeneity of the pellets are the major contributions to the quality of spectra. In order to minimize the uncertainty due to the particle size a purpose of the sample preparation must be to reduce the particle sizes of the calibration sample and the analyte to a maximum size of 2 µm and both particle sizes should agree. A detailed study with calcium carbonate samples with different mean particle sizes has shown that the half-width of the analysed band depends on the particle size and is suitable to test how far the last mentioned condition is fulfilled. In order to minimize the uncertainty due to an inhomogeneous distribution of the absorbing particles in the pellets the infrared beam must pass through the whole surface area of a pellet or the mean value of the spectra measured at different positions on the surface area has to be evaluated. This work proves that the use of the pressed pellet technique can lead to correct results within the limits of the uncertainty if the sample preparation is carried out carefully and optimal measurement conditions are kept...|$|R

The objective {{of the present study was}} to compare the accuracy (<b>trueness</b> and precision) <b>of</b> digital impressions of the full arch with that of conventional impressions on the in-vitro model. For this purpose, a master model was acquired with a new reference scanning process, the measuring <b>trueness</b> <b>of</b> which was +/- 4. 1 microm and the precision +/- 2. 5 microm. On the one hand, conventional impressions and then plaster models (n = 5) were produced from this master model, and on the other hand, digital impressions were made with the Cerec AC Bluecam and the Lava COS system (each n = 5). The plaster models were also scanned with the reference scanner. The available data records were superimposed and the differences determined. The deviation from the master model defines the <b>trueness</b> <b>of</b> the impression method. The deviations of the models among one another demonstrate the precision of the method.

For regulated mycotoxins, such as aflatoxins, fumonisins, ochratoxin A, zearalenone and trichothecenes, {{evaluation of the}} method performance characteristics precision, <b>trueness,</b> limit <b>of</b> detection and matrix effects have been exemplified for the matrix maize. In case of the limit of detection, an alternative evaluation approach for high resolution FT-Orbitrap data is proposed. <b>Measurements</b> <b>of</b> the signal to noise ratios obtained from "full profile mode" data led to detection limits between 8 and 160 ng g- 1. Eight naturally contaminated, wheat- and maize-based matrix test materials, originating from interlaboratory comparison studies were used to confirm <b>trueness</b> <b>of</b> the method for deoxynivalenol, zearalenone, fumonisin B 1 and B 2, HT- 2 and T- 2 toxin. In addition to accurate quantification of the most relevant mycotoxins, the obtained full scan chromatograms were used to investigate {{the potential of the}} FT-Orbitrap to screen simultaneously for a large number of fungal metabolites. First, a list of 200 metabolites, potentially being present in food samples has been established. Next, specific detection and identification criteria were defined, which were based on accurate mass, peak intensity and isotopologue ratio. Application of these criteria to the suspected metabolites from the list resulted in the putative identification of 13 fungal metabolites in addition to the target toxins...|$|R
30|$|The {{accuracy}} of intraoral scanners has been evaluated for both single abutment [10 – 13] and short-span fixed dental prostheses [14 – 16]. To determine the {{accuracy of}} intraoral scanners, researchers have performed in vitro studies using reference models [17 – 20]. Although short-span intraoral scans have exhibited excellent accuracy, few in vivo studies have investigated {{the accuracy of}} intraoral scans on whole dentition in the clinical setting. Kuhr et al. [21] developed a new method <b>of</b> measuring the <b>trueness</b> <b>of</b> full-arch intraoral scans using reference spheres. However, the authors investigated only lower teeth [21]. Anh et al. [22] compared the precision of images acquired using the iTero and TRIOS intraoral scanners; however, they performed in vitro studies using fabricated dental arch models.|$|R
5000|$|In 1993 Johnson {{performed}} {{the title role}} in Verdi's Aida at the Michigan Opera Theater, returned to the Mostly Mozart Festival to perform Beethoven's Ah! perfido under the baton of John Nelson at Lincoln Center, and sang both Ave Maria and The Lord's Prayer for the wedding of Donald Trump and Marla Maples. That same year she won the Young Concert Artists competition, which led to her New York recital debut at the 92nd Street Y on March 29, 1994. In his review of her performance, music critic Bernard Holland wrote [...] "Adding Ms. Johnson up, one arrives at a powerful voice, <b>trueness</b> <b>of</b> intonation, musicality, taste and an impressive endurance. In conglomerate these qualities certainly signal a future of some proportions, maybe even a new Isolde." ...|$|R
