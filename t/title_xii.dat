2500|$|Aside {{from the}} {{expectations}} placed on women {{by their own}} religions, society also holds certain biases against women of certain religions that causes them to have less success in the job market. [...] This is seen most often among Muslim women who express their religion by [...] wearing modest clothing and traditional female Muslim accessories such as henna and hijabs. This was proven by {{a study by the}} Bristol school of Sociology that showed that Muslim women were 70 percent more likely to be unsuccessful in looking for work than Christian and nonreligious women. [...] These numbers stem from discriminatory actions on various levels of society that often lead Muslim women to lose their jobs or have trouble finding jobs. For example, on the local level, a woman was fired from a Jiffy Lube for wearing her hijab to work because it apparently violated the company's [...] "no hat" [...] rule. The company suffered no repercussions for this action. [...] On the federal level, the court case Webb v Philadelphia ruled that an officer wearing her hijab with her uniform, which is a requirement for women in her religion, was in violation of the states' standard of neutrality and therefore could be terminated for her choice to wear it. This ruling makes this type of discrimination precedent for similar situations and makes it harder to traditional Muslim women to find and hold professional careers. There are laws against this type of discrimination, such as America's <b>Title</b> <b>XII</b> of their Civil Right's Act of 1964 which makes it illegal for businesses to discriminate against their employees [...] based on their sex, race, color, national origin, and religion, but even so this sort of religious and gender discrimination often intersect and lead to the feminization of poverty within certain communities.|$|E

However, TNA announced on the Friday before the event that due a torn meniscus, MVP was deemed medically unfit to compete and thus removed from the match.

On the following week's episode on June 26, MVP attempted to fire Bobby Roode {{only to be told}} by Board of Directors representative Earl Sullivan Armstrong that he was officially relieved of his duties as Director of Wrestling Operations and that his replacement was Kurt Angle.

On January 7, 2015, MVP and King along with new members Samoa Joe, Low Ki, and Roode's friend Eric Young all helped Lashley regain the championship from Roode. On the following night's tapings of the January 16, 2015 episode of Impact Wrestling, MVP presented the group as his [...] "family" [...] and officially christened them Beat Down Clan. Later that night, Low Ki defeated Austin Aries to win back the TNA X Division Championship, which he had lost to Aries the previous night, following which MVP attempted to present Lashley as the centerpiece of the Clan as well as a [...] "founding member" [...] (officially establishing the MVP-Lashley-King trio as the foundation of the BDC as a faction).

5000|$|The credit {{against the}} Federal tax {{may be reduced}} if the state has an {{outstanding}} advance (commonly called a “loan”). When states lack the funds to pay UI benefits, they may obtain loans from the federal government. To assure that these loans are repaid, and in accordance with <b>Title</b> <b>XII</b> of the Social Security Act, {{the federal government is}} entitled to recover those monies by reducing the FUTA credit it gives to employers, which is the equivalent of an overall increase in the FUTA tax. When a state has an outstanding loan balance on January 1 for two consecutive years, and the full amount of the loan is not repaid by November 10 of the second year, the FUTA credit will be reduced until the loan is repaid. This process is commonly called FUTA Credit Reduction and was designed as an involuntary repayment mechanism. The reduction schedule is 0.3% for the first year and an additional 0.3% for each succeeding year until the loan is repaid. From the third year onward, there may be additional reduction(s) in the FUTA tax credit (commonly dubbed [...] "add-ons"). For example, for taxable years 2012 and 2013, Virgin Islands had a [...] "2.7 add-on" [...] when its tax rate on total wages was below a national minimum. For taxable year 2014, Connecticut had a [...] "BCR add-on" [...] when its tax rate on the taxable portion of covered wages in the previous calendar year is less than the 5-year benefit cost ratio applicable for the taxable year.|$|E
