5000|$|<b>Timeshare</b> {{donation}} is {{a consumer}} relief strategy that allows <b>timeshare</b> owners a legitimate {{way out of}} their <b>timeshare</b> ownership. The concept of <b>timeshare</b> donation is less than ten years old, but gains popularity each year as the <b>timeshare</b> resale market continues to falter. In recent years, due to a severely depressed <b>timeshare</b> resale market owners looking to sell their <b>timeshare</b> have little success. <b>Timeshare</b> owners also face a myriad of unscrupulous <b>timeshare</b> listing companies looking for large up-front fees with the promise that their <b>timeshare</b> will soon be out of their name. [...] Typically the listing company cannot sell their <b>timeshare,</b> nor do they have an incentive because they can collect another listing fee after the original listing contract expires. For many <b>timeshare</b> owners, trying to sell their <b>timeshare</b> becomes a vicious cycle of broken promises, high fees, and little to no interest from buyers. According to the Florida Attorney General’s Office, <b>timeshare</b> owners are also especially vulnerable to <b>timeshare</b> resale scams. Ultimately, many owners look to simply give-away, or donate their <b>timeshare</b> to a willing party because their <b>timeshare</b> investment has become a liability.|$|R

The company decided to participate with eighty-seven other suppliers to win a contract with the European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN) for its accelerator. The first tender was unsuccessful, but a delegation from CERN visited all the European manufacturers, largely out of courtesy as they had a long history of choosing American suppliers.

40|$|M. A. (Geography) The <b>timeshare</b> {{industry}} {{is one of}} the least researched segments of tourism accommodation or lodging. In the international scholarship the existing writings are mostly focussed on marketing, consumer behaviour and management issues.

Outside of these areas only a limited amount of work has been done on <b>timeshare.</b> An important gap relates to the evolution and development of <b>timeshare</b> in particular countries and of the role of <b>timeshare</b> as part of tourism development.

40|$|The <b>timeshare</b> industry, {{also known}} as {{vacation}} ownership, is the fastest growing segment of the hospitality industry with sales totaling 9. 7 billion in 2008 (ARDA, 2010). The typical <b>timeshare</b> sales process is a 90 - 120 minute sales presentation conducted by a <b>timeshare</b> sales representative to customers. At {{the end of the}} sales presentation, the customers are given the option to either purchase a <b>timeshare</b> unit at a discounted price with first-day incentives or to purchase at a later date at the full price and without the extra incentives. This today-only sales pitch is perceived as an unsavory process by a many potential customers. This process, however, does not seem to discourage the 4. 7 million U. S. customers who have purchased a <b>timeshare</b> unit {{over the past three decades}} (ARDA, 2010). There is relatively little research on purchase intentions at the time of sale among <b>timeshare</b> owners. Most of the existing research has reported that consumers purchase <b>timeshares</b> based on the three primary consumer purchase themes of travel, money and value, and life experiences (Crotts 2 ̆ 6 Ragatz, 2002; Lawton, Weaver, 2 ̆ 6 Faulkner 1998; Sparks, Butcher 2 ̆ 6 Bradley, 2008; Sparks, Butcher 2 ̆ 6 Pan, 2007). Therefore, this study sought to answer the research question: Why do consumers purchase <b>timeshare</b> units? Using a grounded theory approach, this study used three phases of analysis to determine the reasons consumers purchase <b>timeshare</b> units. First, the content analysis of 2, 079 <b>timeshare</b> consumer documents collected over an 18 -month time period were analyzed. Sixteen <b>timeshare</b> purchase categories emerged from the data and were named using in vivo codes, terms drawn directly from the data. The second analysis phase incorporated data from 12 in-depth interviews with <b>timeshare</b> salespersons on their perceptions of why their customers purchased a <b>timeshare</b> unit. In the final phase of analysis, the theory was tested against eight interviews with customers and sales representatives during a <b>timeshare</b> sales presentation. Four major themes and 16 categories emerged in the open coding process. The major <b>timeshare</b> purchase themes identified were (1) the <b>timeshare</b> sales presentation and staff, (2) the <b>timeshare</b> resort facilities and accommodations, (3) travel vacation motivations, and (4) money, price, and value. Of the 16 <b>timeshare</b> purchase motivator categories, the <b>timeshare</b> salesperson emerged as the central <b>timeshare</b> sales purchase motivator. Other top categories included (a) First Day Incentives, (b) Liked Resort Accommodations, (c) Ease, Convenience, or Flexible, and (d) Affordable Price or Deal. The grounded theory process and the emergent theory are explained. Managers could apply this information to develop sales and marketing campaigns geared towards improving sales closure rates.

40|$|In {{this paper}} the {{question}} is addressed asking, “Is <b>Timeshare</b> Ownership an Investment Product? ” After some discussion, the conclusion is that the purchaser outlays funds for economic benefit, thus <b>timeshare</b> fits well within the definition of an investment product. The paper also adds to the literature in that it advances the discussion regarding {{the risks associated with}} <b>timeshare</b> and the methodology applied in <b>timeshare</b> valuation. As investment is based on the notion of risk and return, thus firstly the risks associated with <b>timeshare</b> are discussed. Following, an analysis is conducted from a consumer’s perspective considering the viability of investing in <b>timeshare</b> versus that of simply renting a holiday unit for one week per year. The notion that the purchase of <b>timeshare</b> can lock-in at least a portion of vocation expenses to today’s rates is tested. The case is based on real figures taken from an offer made on a particular <b>timeshare</b> resort from a popular <b>timeshare</b> location and tourist destination. The viability from an economic perspective of investing in these <b>timeshare</b> investments was not supported by the analysis. The scenario that a capital gain could make up the shortfall was considered, but it was demonstrated that this was not probable in the cases presented. Based on the cases discussed, there are three aspects highlighted in the paper as contributing to the costs of ownership of <b>timeshare</b> that are considered as factors that could be addressed to make <b>timeshare</b> ownership a more feasible purchase. They are the cost of sales, maintenance costs and exit costs. If the industry were able to take up the challenge of reducing these costs in particular, it is likely that investment in <b>timeshare</b> would be more feasible and attract a wider market. ...|$|R

50|$|The {{profitable}} <b>timesharing</b> business {{started to}} deteriorate in mid-1982, as some key <b>timesharing</b> clients moved their operations from <b>timesharing</b> to in-house Sharp APL. Around that time, IBM started offering smaller mainframe computers, {{such as the}} IBM 4300 series, which could be leased {{for less than the}} cost of using external services. Clients who did not depend on the network were the first to migrate to small mainframes. Initially, the presence of the IBM PC posed little threat to the <b>timesharing</b> industry as the computing horsepower and storage capacity offered by these small machines was insufficient. As a major slice of Sharp's business was buttressed by database business, this had the beneficial effect of delaying the eventual downslide.

50|$|However, {{the biggest}} {{complaint}} {{of all is}} the fact that <b>timeshare</b> reselling by the private owner is almost impossible to do. In most cases, an owner looking to sell literally cannot give the <b>timeshare</b> away. <b>Timeshare</b> resale companies have sprung up that actually charge the owner to assume his/her <b>timeshare</b> ownership, using the excuse that the resale company must assume the maintenance fees along with marketing fees, until that burden can be transferred to a new buyer.|$|R
50|$|<b>Timeshares</b> are {{generally}} treated as real property {{and can be}} resold to another party. However, <b>timeshares</b> do not appreciate in value, and therefore {{should not be considered}} a money-making investment. Additionally, as much as 50% or more (modest estimate) of the original purchase price of a <b>timeshare</b> from a developer or resort went towards marketing costs, sales commission, and other fees, which realistically can never be recouped by the owner. Most <b>timeshares</b> resell for a nominal price as low as $1, so the new owner only takes responsibility of maintenance and other recurring fees. Resale price can be considered a market price of the <b>timeshare.</b>|$|R
50|$|It is {{more than}} {{extremely}} likely that a new <b>timeshare</b> owner could have purchased the same product from an existing owner on the <b>timeshare</b> resale market for drastically less than what the buyer paid from the resort developer, simply by doing a computer search.

The new buyer usually pays only minimum real estate transfer fees and agrees {{to take over the}} maintenance fees, because the existing owner can't find a buyer for his/her <b>timeshare</b> without paying a resale company thousands of dollars to absorb it for resale. The reason for this anomaly is that the lion's share of the cost of a new <b>timeshare</b> are sales commissions and marketing overhead, and cannot be retrieved by the <b>timeshare</b> owner.|$|R
