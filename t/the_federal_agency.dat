5|$|Superfund {{sites are}} {{designated}} as {{being among the}} nation's worst areas with respect to toxic and hazardous waste. The Environmental Protection Agency is <b>the</b> <b>federal</b> <b>agency</b> that determines if a particular site is hazardous, prepares {{a course of action}} to reduce the hazard, and finds the parties responsible for the pollution. If a site is listed with the Superfund program, federal dollars are available for cleanup.|$|E
5|$|This section {{covers the}} actual management, or handling, of funds {{pertaining}} {{to a federal}} program, specifically on how federal assistance is distributed to recipients and how recipients manage the funds until disbursement. The actual transfer of funds, {{commonly referred to as}} “drawdowns”, is usually done electronically by requesting the funds to <b>the</b> <b>federal</b> <b>agency</b> via website or a network. The funds are automatically transferred from the US Department of Treasury to the recipient’s bank account. Federal assistance for program operations is provided to recipients usually by one of two methods, also called “funding techniques”: by either advances of funds or by reimbursement of funds.|$|E
5|$|This section {{establishes}} the fact that, although recipients may receive various federal awards during their lifespan, the individual federal grants are awarded for a specified time period, usually one year. Federal regulations prohibit {{the use of}} funds from a grant award outside its specified time frame unless authorized by a federal agency, and auditors should verify that the recipient expends its grant during that time only. For example, a surplus from a federal award that starts on January 1, 2006 and ends on December 31, 2006 cannot be used after December 31, because its lifespan has terminated. This surplus must be returned to <b>the</b> <b>federal</b> <b>agency</b> unless otherwise authorized.|$|E

5|$|Belgium {{has seven}} nuclear {{reactors}} that provide about 52% of its electricity. Belgian {{spent nuclear fuel}} was initially sent for reprocessing in France. In 1993, reprocessing was suspended following {{a resolution of the}} Belgian parliament; spent fuel is since being stored on the sites of the nuclear power plants. The deep disposal of high-level radioactive waste (HLW) has been studied in Belgium for more than 30 years. Boom Clay is studied as a reference host formation for HLW disposal. The Hades underground research laboratory (URL) is located at −223 m in the Boom Formation at the Mol site. The Belgian URL is operated by the Euridice Economic Interest Group, a joint organisation between SCK•CEN, the Belgian Nuclear Research Centre which initiated the research on waste disposal in Belgium in the 1970s and 1980s and ONDRAF/NIRAS, the Belgian agency for radioactive waste management. In Belgium, the regulatory body in charge of guidance and licensing approval is <b>the</b> <b>Federal</b> <b>Agency</b> of Nuclear Control, created in 2001.|$|E
5|$|Nerpa {{was laid}} {{down at the}} Komsomolsk-on-Amur {{shipyard}} in 1993, but its completion was delayed {{for nearly a decade}} {{due to a lack of}} funds caused by the economic crisis of the early 1990s. The partly constructed vessel was mothballed until 2004, when Rosprom (<b>the</b> <b>Federal</b> <b>Agency</b> for Industry) signed an agreement with the Indian government to complete the submarine and lease it to the Indian Navy. The vessel was intended to be completed by 2007, but underwent further delays. In 2007, it was transferred to the Vostok shipyard in the closed city of Bolshoy Kamen, Primorsky Krai, for fitting-out. It was launched in October 2008 for sea trials, following which it was due to be handed over to the Russian Defence Ministry. Reports in the Indian media suggest that the resumption of construction was underwritten with Indian funding.|$|E

It served {{as the basis for the}} preliminary drafting plan, which was prepared by the Planungsgesellschaft Bahnbau Deutsche Einheit ("Planning Corporation for German Unity Railway Construction") from early 1992 and confirmed by the ZHvDR at the end of 1992. At the same time, a national and environmental protection planning study was carried out with the participating federal states and <b>the</b> <b>Federal</b> <b>Agency</b> for Nature Conservation. Within the scope of a space sensitivity test, a large-scale corridor investigation was carried out on the scale of 1:100,000 to determine route options. Among other things, conflicts and risks in relation to spatial and environmental factors along with railway operations and economic aspects were taken into account.

25|$|The Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR), <b>the</b> <b>federal</b> <b>agency</b> {{responsible}} for funding health research, recommended in 2010 against funding a pan-Canadian trial of liberation therapy {{because there was}} a lack of evidence on the safety or efficacy of the procedure. It suggested a scientific expert working group made up of the principal investigators for the seven MS Society-sponsored studies. The health minister accepted the CIHR recommendation and said that Canada was not going to fund clinical trials. The expert panel was created by the end of 2010 together between the CIHR and the MS Society of Canada. It has been proposed that the creation of this expert panel was partly directed to cope with the high levels of social pressure the CCSVI theory had raised and at the same time try to maintain a scientific perspective in the funding and investigation of CCSVI. The main task of the panel was to monitor the results of the ongoing studies in the relationship between CCSVI and MS and recommend the funding of a clinical trial in case that there was evidence of a true relationship between the two. In 2011, the Canadian federal government announced that they would fund clinical trials of the procedure to widen the veins since CIHR considered that evidence of venous abnormalities in MS was enough for small treatment trials. It has been proposed that the recommendation to fund phase I and II trials instead of a big study was a compromise between the high levels of social and political pressure and the low level of evidence on the theory.|$|E
25|$|Emory University {{research}} is heavily {{funded by the}} United States Department of Health and Human Services's National Institutes of Health. <b>The</b> <b>federal</b> <b>agency</b> awarded the university nearly $300 million {{in the fiscal year}} of 2015. In 2015, Emory University was one of four institutions selected by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases for its seven-year, multimillion-dollar Tuberculosis Research Units (TBRU) program, which aims to drive innovation in tuberculosis research and reduce the global burden of the disease. In 2015, an Emory-led research consortium received a five-year, 15 million dollar grant from the National Institutes of Health (NIH) to research human immune responses to Varicella zoster virus and pneumococcal vaccination. The university also received a $9 million grant over five years from the NIH to support one of three national Centers for Collaborative Research in Fragile X syndrome. The grant is a renewal of Emory’s National Fragile X Research Center, continuously funded by the NIH for more than 10 years. In 2015, the university received a $8.9 million grant over five years from the NIH National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute(NHLBI) to better understand the role of reactive oxygen species and inflammation in blood vessel function and to explore new interventions and preventive approaches for atherosclerosis and aortic aneurysms. In 2015, the university received a $8 million grant over five years from the NIH to develop and validate mathematical models of how prior immunity affects recall immune responses to influenza viruses. The researchers will create and disseminate powerful, user-friendly modeling tools for use by the wider research community in developing more effective vaccines. In 2015, the university received a $3.6 million grant over five years from the NIH {{to examine the effects of}} maternal stress on brain function, development, and behavior in African-American infants, including the biochemical connection between the brain and the microbiome. In 2015, the university received a $3.5 million grant over five years from the NIH National Cancer Institute (NCI) for an Informatics Technology for Cancer Research award. Winship Cancer Institute and Emory School of Medicine researchers will develop software tools to help the cancer research community gain new insights from cancer imaging “big data” and develop new open-source cancer research applications. In 2015, the university received a $3.4 million grant from the NIH International Collaborations in Infectious Disease Research Program to support a partnership between the Emory Vaccine Center and the International Centre for Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology (ICGEB) in New Delhi, India to study dengue virus infection in India.|$|E
