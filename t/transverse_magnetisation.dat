5000|$|The {{first part}} of the pulse sequence, SS, {{achieves}} [...] "slice selection". A shaped pulse (shown here with a sinc modulation) causes a 90° nutation of longitudinal nuclear magnetization within a slab, or slice, creating transverse magnetization. The second part of the pulse sequence, PE, imparts a phase shift upon the slice-selected nuclear magnetization, varying with its location in the Y direction. The third part of the pulse sequence, another slice selection (of the same slice) uses another shaped pulse to cause a 180° rotation of transverse nuclear magnetization within the slice. This <b>transverse</b> <b>magnetisation</b> refocuses to form a spin echo at a time TE. During the spin echo, a frequency-encoding (FE) or readout gradient is applied, making the resonant frequency of the nuclear magnetization vary with its location in the X direction. The signal is sampled nFE times by the ADC during this period, as represented by the vertical lines. Typically nFE of between 128 and 512 samples are taken.|$|E
40|$|We {{report on}} {{longitudinal}} and <b>transverse</b> <b>magnetisation</b> measurements performed on single crystal samples of Gd 2 Ti 2 O 7 for {{a magnetic field}} applied along the [100] direction. The measurements reveal the presence of previously unreported phases in fields below 10 kOe in an addition to the higher-field-induced phases that are also seen for H//[111], [110], and [112]. The proposed H-T phase diagram for the [100] direction looks distinctly different {{from all the other}} directions studied previously. Comment: 4 pages, 5 figure...|$|E
40|$|We {{consider}} the non-equilibrium dynamics after a sudden quench {{of the magnetic}} field in the transverse field Ising chain starting from excited states of the pre-quench Hamiltonian. We prove that stationary values of local correlation functions can be described by the generalised Gibbs ensemble (GGE). Then we study the full time evo-lution of the <b>transverse</b> <b>magnetisation</b> by means of stationary phase methods. The equal time two-point longitudinal correlation function is analytically derived for a par-ticular class of excited states for quenches within the ferromagnetic phase, and studied numerically in general. The full time dependence of the entanglement entropy of a block of spins is also obtained analytically for the same class of states and for arbitrary quenches. a...|$|E
40|$|The {{phase diagram}} of Sr 3 Ru 2 O 7 {{contains}} a metamagnetic transition that bifurcates to enclose an anomalous phase with intriguing properties - a large resistivity with anisotropy that breaks the crystal-lattice symmetry. We propose {{that this is}} a magnetic analogue of the spatially inhomogeneous superconducting Fulde-Ferrel-Larkin-Ovchinnikov state. We show - through a Ginzburg-Landau expansion where the <b>magnetisation</b> <b>transverse</b> to the applied field can become spatially inhomogeneous - that a Stoner model with electronic band dispersion can reproduce this phase diagram and transport behaviour.

40|$|Using lyotropic liquid {{crystalline}} phases and self-assembly from colloidal suspensions of polystyrene latex spheres, well-ordered, nanostructured templates were prepared. The {{results of}} electrochemical deposition of magnetic {{metals and alloys}} in the voids of these templates are presented. This technique has enabled the creation of magnetic nanostructures with 3 D-achitectures on length scales 4 nm- 1 mum. Changes in coercive field, by more than {{an order of magnitude}} were found, dominated by the effects of domain wall pinning. Clear <b>transverse</b> <b>magnetisation</b> suggests Bloch type of the domain walls. The in-plane component of the magnetic field drives the magnetic hysteresis. The templated electrodeposition technique offers the potential of a low-cost preparation method for sub-micron patterned magnetic media...|$|E
40|$|We {{study the}} non-equilibrium time {{evolution}} of the average <b>transverse</b> <b>magnetisation</b> and end-to-end correlation functions of the random Ising quantum chain. Starting with fully magnetised states, either in the $x$ or $z$ direction, we compute numerically the average quantities. They show similar behaviour to the homogeneous chain, that is an algebraic decay in time toward a stationary state. During the time evolution, the spatial correlations, measured {{from one end to}} the other of the chain, are building up and finally at long time they reach a size-dependent constant depending on the distance from criticality. Analytical arguments are given which support the numerical results. Comment: 6 pages, 5 figures, accepted for publication in EPJ...|$|E
40|$|We {{present the}} results {{obtained}} on the magnetisation relaxation properties of an XX quantum chain in a transverse magnetic field. We first consider an initial thermal kink-like state where half of the chain is initially thermalized at a very high temperature $T_b$ while the remaining half, called the system, is put at a lower temperature $T_s$. From this initial state, we derive analytically the Green function associated to the dynamical behaviour of the <b>transverse</b> <b>magnetisation.</b> Depending on the strength of the magnetic field and on the temperature of the system, different regimes are obtained for the magnetic relaxation. In particular, with an initial droplet-like state, that is a cold subsystem of finite size in contact at both ends with an infinite temperature environnement, we derive analytically the behaviour of the time-dependent system magnetisation...|$|E
30|$|The bSSFP {{sequence}} is structurally {{very similar to}} the spoiled gradient echo sequence; however, as it does not spoil but instead re-focuses the <b>transverse</b> <b>magnetisation</b> {{at the end of each}} TR interval, it makes more efficient use of the available magnetisation. Within each TR all gradient dephasing is refocused (balanced), and by using RF pulses with alternating phases (i.e. the magnetisation is flipped back and forth), a highly coherent steady state can be achieved. Compared with the spoiled gradient echo sequence, the propagation of transverse coherence leads to a more complex contrast behaviour, and for short TR the contrast is proportional to the ratio T 2 /T 1. Balanced SSFP sequences use higher flip angles (about 70 °), which lead to a stronger signal, but also to higher specific absorption rate (SAR) values. Balanced SSFP sequences are susceptible to off-resonance and field inhomogeneities, which is manifested as so-called banding artefacts where one to several dark bands occur.|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} we show {{theoretically}} {{that when a}} magnetised blood bolus enters a cw NMR excitor coil of length Le at resonance and the signal from the T 2 -decaying, precessing <b>transverse</b> <b>magnetisation</b> of the flowing blood spins is subsequently detected by a detector coil of length L separated from the excitor coil by a distance !ll, then by recording cw NMR signals at three positions such as !ll = 0, 0. 5 and 1. 0 em one can eliminate the static tissue signal and measure non-invasively the steady component V 0 {{as well as the}} total vessel cross section, 3 accurately. The time dependent part of the cw NMR signal which depends on Vpul,e(1), is also dependent on V 0 non-linearly unless both Land Le are greater than 50 em and !ll is zero. Finally, methods of obtaining true Vpu,,e(l) from the cw NMR signal after applying proper correction due to the steady flow are discussed...|$|E
40|$|Conventional MRI {{sequences}} do {{not permit}} {{the distinction between the}} different pathological characteristics (oedema, demyelination, gliosis, axonal loss) of the multiple sclerosis plaque. Magnetisation transfer imaging and <b>transverse</b> <b>magnetisation</b> decay curve (tMDC) analysis may be more specific. These techniques have been applied to the optic nerves in 20 patients with optic neuritis and the results correlated with clinical and visual evoked potential (VEP) findings. tMDC analysis failed to identify separate intracellular and extracellular water compartments within the optic nerve but gave a measure of transverse relaxation time (T 2) without the confounding effects of CSF in the nerve sheath. Both T 2 and magnetisation transfer ratio (MTR) were abnormal after an episode of optic neuritis. T 2 did not correlate with visual function or with VEP latency or amplitude. There was a significant correlation between MTR reduction and prolongation of VEP latency: this increased latency may reflect an effect of myelin loss on MTR. Longer lesions were associated with worse visual outcome, implying that the overall extent of pathological involvement is likely to influence the degree of functional deficit...|$|E
40|$|The {{characteristics}} of <b>transverse</b> <b>magnetisation</b> decay of 120 longstanding lesions and 40 regions of normal-appearing white matter have been analysed in 40 patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) and 10 normal controls. Fifty lesions showed a biexponential decay {{in which two}} water compartments-one probably intracellular, the other extracellular-could be defined. There was a higher frequency of biexponential lesions in patients with a primary progressive course but {{no significant difference between}} benign and secondary progressive groups. Seventy lesions showed a monoexponential decay, of which 31 showed a T 2 of greater than 200 ms, implying that these lesions were predominantly composed of extracellular rather than intracellular water. The results imply that an expanded extracellular space within chronic MS brain lesions is a common finding at all levels of disability and disease course. In so far as an expanded extracellular space implies axonal loss, the results suggest that the latter occurs commonly in longstanding MS lesions. The lack of correlation with disability suggests a limited role for the technique in therapeutic monitoring...|$|E
40|$|Under fast MAS conditions, {{techniques}} for 1 H signal selection and suppression, which have originally {{been developed for}} solution-state NMR, become applicable to solids. In this work, we describe how WATERGATE and DANTE pulse sequences can be used under MAS to selectively excite or suppress peaks in 1 H solid-state spectra. As known from the liquid-state analogues, signal selection and/or suppression is supported by pulsed-field gradients which selectively dephase and rephase <b>transverse</b> <b>magnetisation.</b> Under MAS, the required field gradients are provided by a simple pair of coils which have been built into a standard fast-MAS probe. PFG-assisted techniques enable efficient selection or suppression of 1 H peaks in a single transient of the pulse sequence {{without the need for}} phase cycles. Therefore, these tools can readily be incorporated into solid-state MAS NMR experiments, which is demonstrated here for 1 H– 1 H double-quantum NMR spectra of supramolecular systems. In the examples presented here, the 1 H signals of interest are relatively weak and need to be observed despite the presence of the strong 1 H signal of long alkyl sidechains. PFG-assisted suppression of this strong perturbing signal is shown to be particularly useful for obtaining unambiguous results...|$|E
40|$|Magnetic {{nanoparticles}} and microparticles can {{be found}} in biological tissues {{for a variety of reasons}} including pathological deposition of biogenic particles, administration of synthetic particles for scientific or clinical reasons, and the inclusion of biogenic magnetic particles for the sensing of the geomagnetic field. In applied magnetic fields, the magnetisation of tissue protons can be manipulated with radiofrequency radiation such that the macroscopic magnetisation of the protons precesses freely in the plane perpendicular to the applied static field. The presence of magnetic particles within tissue enhances the rate of dephasing of proton precession with higher concentrations of particles resulting in higher dephasing rates. Magnetic resonance imaging instruments can be used to measure and image the rate of decay of spin echo recoverable proton <b>transverse</b> <b>magnetisation</b> (R 2) within tissues enabling the measurement and imaging of magnetic particle concentrations with the aid of suitable calibration curves. Applications include the non-invasive measurement of liver iron concentrations in iron-overload disorders and measurement and imaging of magnetic particle concentrations used in magnetic hyperthermia therapy. Future applications may include the tracking of magnetically labelled drugs or biomolecules and the measurement of fibrotic liver damage...|$|E
40|$|In hyperpolarised 3 He lung MRI with {{constant}} flip angles, the <b>transverse</b> <b>magnetisation</b> decays with each RF excitation imposing a k-space filter on the acquired data. For radial data acquired in an angularly-sequential order, this filter causes streaking, angular shading {{and loss of}} spatial resolution in the images. The main aim of this work was to reduce {{the effects of the}} RF depletion k-space filter in radial acquisitions. Two approaches are presented; (i) retrospective deconvolution of the k-space filter for sequentially-acquired data and (ii) golden angle acquisition order. Radial trajectories sample the centre of k-space with every projection, thereby self-tracking signal decay. The inverse of the signal decay function was used to retrospectively deconvolve RF depolarisation k-space filter effects and the method was demonstrated in 2 D radial imaging in phantoms and human lungs. A golden angle radial acquisition was shown to effectively suppress artefacts caused by the RF depletion k-space filter. In addition, the average flip angle per slice was calculated from the signal decay and the values were found to correspond with conventional flip angle maps, providing a means of flip angle self-calibration...|$|E
40|$|We {{study the}} non-equilibrium {{evolution}} of a one-dimensional quantum Ising chain with spatially disordered, time-dependent, transverse fields characterised by white noise correlation dynamics. We establish pre-thermalization in this model, showing that the quench dynamics of the on-site <b>transverse</b> <b>magnetisation</b> first approaches a metastable state unaffected by noise fluctuations, and then relaxes exponentially fast towards an infinite temperature state {{as a result of}} the noise. We also consider energy transport in the model, starting from an inhomogeneous state with two domain walls which separate regions characterised by spins with opposite transverse magnetization. We observe at intermediate time scales a phenomenology akin to Anderson localization: energy remains localised within the two domain walls, until the Markovian noise destroys coherence and accordingly disorder-induced localization, allowing the system to relax towards the late stages of its non-equilibrium dynamics. We benchmark our results with the simpler case of a noisy quantum Ising chain without disorder, and we find that the pre-thermal plateau is a generic property of weakly noisy spin chains, while the phenomenon of pre-thermal Anderson localisation is a specific feature arising from the competition of noise and disorder in the real-time transport properties of the system.

40|$|Residual {{magnetisation}} {{is one of}} {{the major}} sources of artefacts in single point imaging sequences with short repetition times. The unwanted signal is caused by non-dephased <b>transverse</b> <b>magnetisation</b> excited in preceding acquisition cycles. Therefore, the problem emerges mainly around the centre of k-space and has been solved in the past by additional spoiling gradients. In this work, unwanted residual magnetisation acquired with the SPRITE sequence was investigated and a new method for the suppression of residual magnetisation is presented. It is shown that residual magnetisation experiences a different phase encoding leading to residual images with a different FOV. A phase cycling filter is able to eliminate the unwanted signal. Furthermore, a description of all signal components that occur is presented using an operator notation. The notation is new in this field with respect to its completeness. That is, the signal description is based on an understanding of single point imaging sequences, such as SPRITE, by the use of an extended phase encode graph. A prominent in vivo example is that of sodium imaging in biological tissue where transverse relaxation times are such that unwanted coherences can occur and therefore residual magnetisation becomes a significant problem. For instance, sodium in biological tissue has two transverse relaxation times of approximately 3 ms and 15 ms at 4 T and this can result in significant artefacts if the encoding time is short and TR< 3 ms...|$|E
