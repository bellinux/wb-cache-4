5|$|Prey is {{obtained}} by hunting {{either on the}} ground or in the trees. During the non-breeding season the fossa hunts individually, but during the breeding season hunting parties may be seen, and these may be pairs or later on mothers and young. One member of the group scales a tree and chases the lemurs from tree to tree, forcing <b>them</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> ground where the other is easily able to capture them. The fossa is known to eviscerate its larger lemur prey, a trait that, along with its distinct scat, helps identify its kills. Long-term observations of the fossa's predation patterns on rainforest sifakas suggest that the fossa hunts in a subsection of their range until prey density is decreased, then moves on. The fossa has been reported to prey on domestic animals, such as goats and small calves, and especially chickens. Food taken in captivity includes amphibians, birds, insects, reptiles, and small- to medium-sized mammals.|$|E

The Forty Thieves enter the city hidden in oil barrels which are placed outside Ali's estate where they wait for nightfall. Before they can strike, Morgiana discovers the barrels and rolls <b>them</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> bottom of a hill where the dazed Forty Thieves are arrested (and later hung) by the city guards, although Black Coda escapes.|$|E
25|$|KSC {{finished}} {{fifth in}} their first season in the 2. Bundesliga after relegation, only two points behind third-place SSV Ulm 1846 which was promoted to the Bundesliga. However, a last place finish in a terrible 1999–2000 season played under dire financial circumstances dropped <b>them</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Regionalliga Süd (III). The club rebounded and {{on the strength of}} a first-place result in the Regionalliga made a prompt return to second division play. After four seasons of mediocre play that saw KSC narrowly avoid being sent further down, the team turned in a much-improved performance and earned a sixth-place result in 2005–06.|$|E

25|$|Ever since, the {{definition}} of the canon has been a collective endeavor that involved several generations of European architects, from Renaissance and Baroque periods, basing their theories both on the study of Vitruvius' writings and the observation of Roman ruins (the Greek ruins became available only after Greek Independence, 1821–23). What was added were rules {{for the use of the}} Architectural Orders, and the exact proportions of <b>them</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> most minute detail. Commentary on the appropriateness of the orders for temples devoted to particular deities (Vitruvius I.2.5) were elaborated by Renaissance theorists, with Doric characterized as bold and manly, Ionic as matronly, and Corinthian as maidenly.|$|E
25|$|The Wizards {{started off}} the 2016-17 {{season with a}} 2–8 record. However, they rebounded to touch the second seed, before a slump brought <b>them</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> fourth seed, {{finishing}} 49–33, behind the 51–31 Toronto Raptors at third, the 51–31 Cleveland Cavaliers at second, and the 53–29 Boston Celtics in first place. The Wizards won their division title {{for the first time}} since the 1978–79 season, also clinching home-field advantage {{for the first time since}} the 1978–79 season, and the team had their best record since the 1978–79 season. The Wizards played the fifth-seeded Atlanta Hawks in the first round of the Eastern Conference playoffs, defeating them in six games behind a 42 point game six performance from Wall and 31 from Beal; before losing to the Boston Celtics in a seven-game series.|$|E
25|$|The Badgers first road game of {{the season}} was a hot one as the game time {{temperature}} was 98 degrees. Arizona State's opening drive took <b>them</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Wisconsin 3-yard line but on fourth and two the Sun Devils went for it but failed. Both offenses struggled for most of the first quarter until the Sun Devils kicked a 34-yard field goal with 4:08 left in the first quarter. The Badgers then put a 10-play 73-yard drive together that took 5:22 and into the second quarter. The Badgers capped that nice drive with a 2-yard touchdown pass from QB Joel Stave to TE Jacob Pedersen. On the next drive, the Sun Devils had a three-and-out. Arizona State attempted to punt the ball but because of a bad snap, Wisconsin's DT Beau Allen recovered the ball in the end zone for a touchdown giving the Badgers a 14–3 lead. Arizona State answered right back with a 10-play 75-yard scoring drive capped by a 2-yard touchdown run by RB Marion Grice. The Sun Devils added a 19-yard field goal before the half cutting the Wisconsin lead to 14–13.|$|E

500|$|Slaton {{was also}} {{convinced}} that the murder notes were written in the basement, not in Frank's office. Slaton accepted the defense's argument that the notes were written on dated order pads signed by a former employee that were only kept in the basement. Slaton wrote that the employee signed an affidavit stating that, {{when he left the}} company in 1912, [...] "he personally packed up all of the duplicate orders... and sent <b>them</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> basement to be burned.

500|$|The group re-recorded {{the song}} for the Rio album {{a few months later}} at London's AIR Studios with {{producer}} Colin Thurston, who also recorded the hits [...] "Too Shy" [...] for Kajagoogoo, and [...] "I Want Candy" [...] for Bow Wow Wow. Andy Taylor remembers: [...] "He was a great organizer and arranger, we gave him far more ideas and music than the track actually needed, and he was important in the process of whittling <b>them</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> essential elements." [...] Thurston and the band decided to keep the demo's original electronic backing track and just re-record the other instruments and vocals.|$|E

2500|$|On 12 August Rundstedt {{took the}} stand before the IMT itself. His counsel, Dr Hans Laternser, took him over the same ground which had been covered before the Commission. He insisted that {{military}} law was [...] "always binding for us older leaders", and that officers who broke these laws were court-martialled. He stated: [...] "As senior soldier of the German Army, I will say this: we accused leaders were trained in the old soldierly traditions of decency and chivalry. We lived and acted according to them, and we endeavoured to hand <b>them</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> younger officers." [...] Cross-examined by the British prosecutor Peter Calvocoressi, he stuck to his position that the high command did not function as an organisation. Senior commanders discussed only operational matters, he said: political and strategic questions were decided by Hitler and the OKW. Rundstedt made a good impression as a witness. Calvocoressi later commented: [...] "He {{was not going to}} let on how much he and his colleagues had known or done. He did this well – or anyway successfully." ...|$|E

He became acting commander of the 24th Battery in June 1936. This appointment became substantive when he {{was promoted}} to major on 19 March 1937. [...] He joined the United Stevedoring Company, a subsidiary of P, in 1932. He worked on a project to improve the unloading of coal, which had been accomplished by shovelling it into baskets and hoisting <b>them</b> <b>down</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> wharf. He replaced these with clamshell buckets, which hoisted the coal directly onto railway trucks. In 1938, he went into business with his former boss at United Stevedoring, Captain Jack Williams, founding a general engineering company called Fleet Forge Pty Ltd.
