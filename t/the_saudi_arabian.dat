5|$|The Battle of Khafji was {{the first}} major ground {{engagement}} of the Gulf War. It took place in and around <b>the</b> <b>Saudi</b> <b>Arabian</b> city of Khafji, from 29 January to 1 February 1991 and marked the culmination of the Coalition's air campaign over Kuwait and Iraq, which had begun on 17 January 1991.|$|E
5|$|Crewe House {{was built}} in the late 18th century on the site of a house on Curzon Street owned by Edward Shepherd, a key builder and {{architect}} around Mayfair. It was bought by James Stuart-Wortley, 1st Baron Wharncliffe in 1818 and became known as Wharncliffe House. In 1899, it was purchased by Robert Crewe-Milnes, Earl Crewe, giving it its current name. The house is now part of <b>the</b> <b>Saudi</b> <b>Arabian</b> Embassy.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Saudi</b> <b>Arabian</b> {{government}} and other Gulf region governments strongly support the King of Bahrain. Although {{government officials and}} media often accuse the opposition of being influenced by Iran, a government-appointed commission found no evidence supporting the claim. Iran has historically claimed Bahrain as a province, but the claim was dropped after a UN 1970 survey found that most Bahraini people preferred independence over Iranian control.|$|E

5|$|During several {{independent}} {{field studies}} cracks and other ground deformations were observed {{on both the}} Egyptian and Saudi Arabian sides of the gulf. During a field survey that was done there in 1996, a series of cracks were discovered between 28°35' N and 29°05' N on <b>the</b> <b>Saudi</b> <b>Arabian</b> coast. A field investigation was also done in Egypt in 1996 by seismologist Yann Klinger and others along with the Egyptian Geological Survey and Mining Authority. The most dramatic ground ruptures found were north of Nuweiba along a coastal road.|$|E
5|$|Following the 1991 Gulf War, {{during which}} many U.S. Apaches {{operated}} from bases within Saudi territory, Saudi Arabia purchased twelve AH-64As for the Royal Saudi Land Force. It {{has been speculated}} that the Saudi purchase had motivated Israel to also procure the Apaches. In August 2006, <b>the</b> <b>Saudi</b> <b>Arabian</b> government began negotiations for Apache upgrades worth up to $400M, possibly remanufacturing their AH-64As to the AH-64D Longbow configuration. In September 2008, the U.S. Government approved the purchase of 12 AH-64Ds requested by Saudi Arabia. In October 2010, Saudi Arabia requested a further 70 AH-64Ds {{as part of a}} possible, massive arms deal.|$|E

5|$|By this time, Schwarzkopf {{commanded}} {{an international}} army of 750,000, comprising 500,000 U.S. troops and 250,000 troops from other nations, {{as well as}} thousands of main battle tanks, combat aircraft and six carrier battle groups. Most of the U.S. and allied forces, however, were not combat veterans, and Schwarzkopf and the other allied commanders wanted to fight cautiously to minimize casualties. Schwarzkopf's experience in the Middle East allowed him to understand the factors surrounding the conflict, including allied commanders, with greater ease. He had {{a good relationship with}} Saudi commander Khalid bin Sultan, who in turn helped Schwarzkopf win over <b>the</b> <b>Saudi</b> <b>Arabian</b> populace. In spite of the cooperation, he later said he considered the Arab troops to be the least effective of the war. Schwarzkopf also had an agreeable relationship with his deputy commander, Lieutenant General Cal Waller, who handled much of the administrative burden. Peter de la Billière, commander of the British contingent, and Michel Roquejeoffre, commander of the French contingent, also cooperated well with Schwarzkopf. The good relationship between the allied commanders meant their forces were able to cooperate effectively during the operation.|$|E
5|$|There is an {{impending}} real estate boom in Saudi Arabia, with increasing demand and rising prices {{due to high}} population growth and a short supply of housing, which may include a demand for high-end luxury units, {{such as those in}} Jeddah Tower. To boost growth, <b>the</b> <b>Saudi</b> <b>Arabian</b> government is going to invest US$67 billion (SR251 billion) in building 500,000homes throughout the country. According to Saudi officials, about 900 new homes are needed a day to meet the demand of the rapidly growing population, which has nearly quadrupled in the past four decades. Jeddah Tower is also an attempt to diversify Saudi Arabia's economy, which, holding a quarter of the world's oil reserves and being one of the founding OPEC nations, is currently largely dependent on its crude oil exportation, which accounts for nearly 75% of government revenues and 90% of exports. This generates enough income to support Saudi Arabia as a welfare state, which spends billions of dollars on job creation and housing for its lower income residents.|$|E
