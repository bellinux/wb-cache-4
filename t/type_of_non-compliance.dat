Assuming that an enforcement strategy, {{in order to be}} effective, has to fit the <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>non-compliance,</b> we integrate six different theoretical perspectives on compliance in order to develop enforcement strategies that can deal with the variety of factors causing compliance.

40|$|Patients who do {{not attend}} (DNA) for {{out-patient}} hospital appointments cause delays in the diagnosis and subsequent treatment of their own, and other patient's, illnesses, with potentially hazardous consequences. This also impacts upon waiting lists. Failure to attend {{is viewed as a}} specific <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>non-compliance</b> and social cognition theories have been applied to previous studies in an attempt to uncover the reasons why patients choose not to keep their appointments. Methods A case-control study was conducted throughout the X-ray departments of a District General type of NHS Trust, using telephone interview questionnaires based on the Health Belief Model, in an attempt to identify any significant differences between attenders and non-attenders, so that likely non-attenders could be targeted. Results Principal reasons for non-attendance were that the patient forgot or that they did not receive their appointment. The results differed from previous research, in that specific health beliefs were not the primary reasons for non-attendance. Departments that gave patients the opportunity to arrange their appointments for a mutually convenient time had exceptionally low DNA rates, as did those which had rigorous confirmation systems in place.

40|$|Motivated by a study about prompt {{coronary}} angiography in myocardial infarction, we propose {{a method to}} estimate the causal effect of a treatment in two-arm experimental studies with possible non-compliance in both treatment and control arms. The method {{is based on a}} causal model for repeated binary outcomes (before and after the treatment), which includes individual covariates and latent variables for the unobserved heterogeneity between subjects. Moreover, given the <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>non-compliance,</b> the model assumes the existence of three subpopulations of subjects: compliers, never-takers, and always-takers. The model is estimated by a two-step estimator: at the first step the probability that a subject belongs to one of the three subpopulations is estimated {{on the basis of the}} available covariates; at the second step the causal effects are estimated through a conditional logistic method, the implementation of which depends on the results from the first step. Standard errors for this estimator are computed on the basis of a sandwich formula. The application shows that prompt {{coronary angiography}} in patients with myocardial infarction may significantly decrease the risk of other events within the next two years, with a log-odds of about - 2. Given that non-compliance is significant for patients being given the treatment because of high risk conditions, classical estimators fail to detect, or at least underestimate, this effect...|$|E

40|$|SummaryBackgroundDigoxin {{is highly}} potent and efficacious for {{treatment}} of heart failure (HF) and/or atrial fibrillation (AF) yet compliance is often poor. AimsTo examine prevalence rates <b>of</b> <b>non-compliance</b> with digoxin; variations between clinical settings, <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>non-compliance</b> and methods <b>of</b> detection; and potential factors influencing non-compliance with digoxin. MethodsThis was a systematic review and meta-analysis of prospective observational studies <b>of</b> <b>non-compliance</b> with digoxin in patients with HF and/or AF, published in English. The studies were identified through these bibliographic databases: MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, IPA and Cochrane CENTRAL. Subgroup analysis examined the influence <b>of</b> clinical settings, <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>non-compliance</b> and methods <b>of</b> detection. ResultsTen studies met the inclusion criteria, comprising 1841 patients with HF and/or AF. The corresponding prevalence rates <b>of</b> <b>non-compliance</b> for outpatients, after hospital discharge and inpatients were 43. 1 % (interquartile range [IQR] 29 – 48 %), 25 % (95 % confidence interval [CI] 12 – 37 %) and 4. 5 %, respectively. In patients with HF and AF co-morbidities, the prevalence rate <b>of</b> <b>non-compliance</b> with digoxin was 38. 7 % (IQR 27 – 46 %); the corresponding prevalence rates of overdosing and underdosing were 33. 04 % (IQR 22 – 49 %) and 33. 8 % (95 % CI 25 – 42 %), respectively. Rates varied depending on the methods <b>of</b> detecting <b>non-compliance.</b> Regularity <b>of</b> prescribed dose, diuretic use, coronary artery bypass, implantable cardioverter-defibrillator, number of office visits and pill boxes demonstrated strong associations with non-compliance with digoxin. ConclusionsNon-compliance with digoxin is prevalent among patients with HF and/or AF. A {{better understanding of the}} factors influencing compliance and improved intervention strategies are necessary to increase digoxin compliance...|$|R
40|$|Despite {{improvements}} {{in the management of}} hypertension in the past several years, nearly 70 % of patients with hypertension are not adequately controlled. Today's physician treating hypertension is armed with numerous efficacious antihypertensive agents. Thus, one of the major contributors to the large number of uncontrolled hypertensive patients appears to be non-compliance with prescribed regimens. Non-compliance is a universal characteristic and can affect all patients. However, the major problem <b>of</b> <b>non-compliance</b> is that it remains largely unrecognised in clinical practice. Several <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>non-compliance</b> exist with the 'drug holiday' being the most common. Good communication with the patient and the entire health care team is critical in increasing patient compliance. Long-acting medications that provide good blood pressure control beyond the 24 -hour dosing period should be considered drugs of choice in non-compliant hypertensive patients.

40|$|Low {{compliance}} to prescribed medical interven-tions is an {{ever present}} and complex problem, especially {{for patients with}} a chronic illness. With increasing numbers of medications shown to do more good than harm when taken as prescibed, low compliance {{is a major problem}} in health care. Relevant studies were retrieved through compre-hensive searches of different database systems to enable a thorough assessment of the major issues in compliance to prescribed medical interven-tions. The term compliance is the main term used in this review because the majority of papers reviewed used this term. Three decades have passed since the first work-shop on compliance research. It is timely to pause and to reflect on the accumulated knowledge. The enormous amount of quantitative research undertaken is of variable methodological quality, with no gold standard for the measurement of compliance and it is often not clear which <b>type</b> <b>of</b> <b>non-compliance</b> is being studied. Many authors do not even feel the need to define adherence. Often absent in the research on compliance is the patient, although the concordance model points at the importance of the patient’s agreement and har-mony in the doctor–patient relationship. The backbone of the concordance model is the patient as a decision maker and a cornerstone is professional empathy. Recently, some qualitative research has identified important issues such as the quality of the doctor–patient relationship and patient health beliefs in this context. Because non-compliance remains a major health problem, more high quality studies are needed to assess these aspects and systematic reviews/meta-ana-lyses are required to study the effects of compli-ance in enhancing the effects of interventions...|$|E
40|$|Imposing benefit cuts to {{job seekers}} {{who do not}} comply with rules and {{requirements}} has become a commonly used enforcement device in unemployment insurance (UI) systems. This paper provides first estimates of how non-compliant job seekers react when confronted with a stricter enforcement regime. We exploit an administrative reform which induced a sharp and unanticipated increase in the probability of receiving a benefit cut {{in response to the}} failure of documenting job search effort. Our difference-in-difference framework uses as a control group job seekers with other <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>non-compliances,</b> whose enforcement rules stayed constant. We find that the probability of job finding within the three months following non-compliance detection increases by 5 p. p. in reaction to the reform. This effect is however purely driven by exits to unstable jobs. Increased enforcement strictness thus appears to pressure job seekers into accepting job matches of lower quality. Estimating the effects on post-unemployment earnings is work in progress...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose is}} to provide an {{analysis}} of the risk factors influencing non-compliance in UK organic farming. The paper uses a formal econometric model of risk analysis to provide empirical evidence on the determinants <b>of</b> <b>non-compliance</b> in organic farming. A panel of data from the archives of the largest control body in the UK for 2007 - 2009 is used, and specific analyses are performed for two <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>non-compliances.</b> A zero inflated count data model is used for the estimation, taking into account the fact that the occurrences <b>of</b> <b>non-compliance</b> are very sparse. Results show the existence of strong co-dependence of non-compliant behaviours (i. e. the occurrence of major and critical non-compliance increases the probability of occurrence of the minor one; similarly the probability of occurrence <b>of</b> major <b>non-compliance</b> increases when minor non-compliance occur). Besides, livestock production and farm size are relevant risk factors. Albeit highly representative, the findings are based on Soil Association data only and not on all UK organic farms. The paper provides practical indications for control bodies, concerning aspects that could be strengthened for more efficient risk-based inspections. The paper advocates the use of financial information like turnover or capital stock, and of data concerning the characteristics of the farmers, that could substantially improve the probability of detecting the most severe non-compliances. Certification is essential for organic farming, and an improvement of inspection procedures through a risk-based approach could add efficiency and effectiveness to the whole organic food system, with obvious advantages for consumers and the society as a whole. This paper provides for the first time empirical evidence concerning the implementation of the organic certification system in the UK...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: The {{growth of}} the Internet {{has led to an}} {{increase}} in the number of public services offered by U. K. government entities on their Web sites. A variety of consumers use e-government sites, and those individuals with disabilities are guaranteed the same access government sites under the U. K. ’s Disability Discrimination Act (DDA) of 1995. This law provides equality in access, and implements penalties for non-adherence to the law. Industry standards also exist which helps site developers to create better site accessibility. However, despite both standards and legal regulations, total openness of sites for people with disabilities is still not widespread. The purpose of this study is to examine the level of accessibility of a randomly selected sample of 130 members of the U. K. House of Commons. Each site was analyzed using an online software tool –Truwex- to determine if they met industry Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) levels 1. 0 and 2. 0 standards and DDA law. The results showed that the majority of the sites did not meet either guidelines or legal mandates. Many of the sites displayed similar precedents when it came to the <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>non-compliance,</b> and could easily improve compliance with minor changes...|$|R
40|$|With the {{introduction}} of a new welfare benefit system in 2005, Germany implemented quite strict benefit sanctions for welfare recipients aged younger than 25 years. For all <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>non-compliance</b> except for missing appointments, their basic cash benefit is withdrawn for three months. A second sanction <b>of</b> the same <b>type</b> within one year implies a complete benefit cut for three months. We analyze the impact of these sanctions on job search outcomes and on transitions out of the labor force. Our analysis is based on administrative data on a large inflow sample of young male jobseekers into welfare in West Germany. We estimate separate models for people living alone and people living with their family, as sanctioned welfare recipients living with other household members can partly rely on their support and might react less by increasing search intensity and lowering reservation wages. We estimate the parameters of multivariate duration models taking selection based on unobservables into account. Our results suggest that both the first and the second sanction increase the probability of finding a job, but that these jobs go along with lower earnings due to first but not the second sanction. Moreover, first sanctions significantly increase the transition rate out of the labor force of both groups of young men, while second sanctions amplify this effect only for young men living in single households...|$|R
40|$|Commitment to {{compliance}} {{may cause}} taxpayers to experience unnecessary compliance costs burden resulting in non-compliance behaviour. This study evaluates the tax compliance costs of corporate taxpayers and their {{compliance with the}} corporate income tax (CIT) reporting requirements under the Self-Assessment System (SAS) environment. Tax compliance costs, corporate characteristics, tax attitudinal aspects and the likely compliance behaviour of public listed companies (PLCs) are integrated into a single study, which represents a unique combination of research. A quantitative approach was adopted, whereby data was collected through a self-administered questionnaire survey method. Two <b>types</b> <b>of</b> respondents were utilised, namely corporate taxpayers and external tax professionals, for richness of data and {{as a measure of}} consistency. The mean CIT compliance costs estimate for the year of assessment 2009 is MYR 47, 126 per company, accounting for approximately MYR 0. 01 per sales turnover. The mean estimate of this study is 31. 5 percent lower when compared to the findings of similar Malaysian pre-SAS study. The aggregated total compliance costs is almost MYR 32 million representing 0. 11 percent of corporate tax revenue and 0. 01 percent of Malaysian gross domestic product (GDP). The magnitude of CIT compliance costs estimate is low compared to similar estimates in other countries. Nevertheless, the normal regressivity of tax compliance costs, in relation to company size, is evident which corroborates the findings of all existing studies. Major components of compliance costs relate to tax computation work (74 percent) and there is a heavy reliance on external sources (63 percent). Business size and estimated tax liability are the significant determinants for the magnitude of tax compliance costs burden for PLCs. The portion of tax incentives and psychological costs to the mean tax compliance costs incurred by large corporations are approximately seven and 18 percent, respectively. This study also provides empirical evidence in the context of linking between compliance burden of the tax system and compliance behaviour from the large corporate taxpayers’ perspective. Tax compliance costs burden appears {{to have an impact on}} the likelihood <b>of</b> <b>non-compliance</b> behaviour, though it is not statistically significant at the 10 percent level. The findings further reveal that the length of time companies have been operating, estimated tax liability and perceptions on complexity in the tax systems, are factors that significantly influence all <b>types</b> <b>of</b> <b>non-compliance,</b> namely under-reporting <b>of</b> income, over-claiming of expenses and overall non-compliance. The remaining corporate characteristics and attitudinal aspects examined, specifically business size, business sector, tax rate structure, tax deterrence sanction, tax law fairness and tax psychological costs, are significant determinants in at least one <b>type</b> <b>of</b> the <b>non-compliance</b> behaviour. This study adds to the growing body of international literature concerning taxpayer compliance costs burden, and to a lower extent, the link between tax compliance costs and tax compliance behaviour. Tax compliance costs and compliance behaviour are clearly important areas of research that have implications for both corporate taxpayers and policy makers. Findings from these research activities should initiate and lead to the progression of more effective and efficient tax policies and practices...|$|R
40|$|Regulatory {{commentators}} {{have identified the}} need for more responsive regulation to allow enforcement agencies to respond to different <b>types</b> and degrees <b>of</b> <b>non-compliance.</b> One tool considered to support responsive enforcement is the Enforceable Undertaking (EU). EUs are used extensively by Australian regulators in decisions that forego litigation in exchange for offenders promising to (amongst other things) correct behaviour and comply in the future.

EUs became an additional enforcement tool for the Fair Work Ombudsman (FWO) under the Fair Work Act 2009.

30|$|The paper {{begins by}} {{developing}} a simple theoretical model in which the obvious benefits <b>of</b> <b>non-compliance</b> for an employer are to be set against the costs <b>of</b> <b>non-compliance.</b> We model these as composed of the probability of getting caught, and the fine imposed if caught. However, alternative interpretations of the costs <b>of</b> <b>non-compliance</b> are possible, including peer effects. We model the costs <b>of</b> <b>non-compliance</b> {{as a function of}} the total short fall of the wage bill compared to full compliance, allowing for the possibility that employers adjust partially towards the minimum wage. The model predicts that employment will fall as the result of a minimum wage, but that a spread of wages below the minimum wage should be observed in response to the law. Employer responses to a minimum wage law depend on the level at which the minimum wage is set, relative to the existing wage. Wages will rise towards the minimum wage, and under certain conditions, the lowest wages will rise proportionately more than those close to the stipulated minimum.|$|R

40|$|The {{biological}} safety profession has historically functioned within an environment based on recommended practices rather than regulations, so summary data on compliance or noncompliance with recommended practices is largely {{absent from the}} professional literature. The absence of safety performance outcome data is unfortunate since the concept of biosafety containment {{is based on a}} combination of facility based controls and workplace practices, and persistent failures in either <b>type</b> <b>of</b> controls could ultimately result in injury or death. In addition, the number of laboratories requiring biosafety containment is likely to grow significantly in the coming years {{in the wake of the}} terrorist events of 2001. In this study, the outcomes of 768 biosafety level 2 (BSL- 2) safety surveys were analyzed for commonalities and trends. Items <b>of</b> <b>non-compliance</b> noted were classified as facility related or practice related. The most frequent item of noncompliance encountered was the failure to re-certify biosafety cabinetry. Not surprisingly, the preponderance of the other frequent items <b>of</b> <b>non-compliance</b> encountered were practice related, such as general housekeeping orderly, changes in compliance levels, as well as establish trends in the elements <b>of</b> items <b>of</b> <b>non-compliance</b> during the sequential survey period. The findings described in this study are significant because, for the first time, the outcomes of compliance with recommended biosafety practices can be characterized and thus used as the basis for focused interventions. Since biosafety is heavily reliant on adherence to specific safety practices, the ability to focus interventions on objectively identified practice-related items <b>of</b> <b>non-compliance</b> can assist in the reduction of worker risk in this area experiencing tremendous growth. The information described is also of heighten importance given the number of workplaces expected to involve potentially infectious agents in the coming years. ...|$|R
