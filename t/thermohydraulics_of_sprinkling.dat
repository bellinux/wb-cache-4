A series of tests was performed to assess the <b>thermohydraulics</b> <b>of</b> resistive transitions (quenches) of the superconducting magnets. These measurements provide the necessary foundation for describing the observed evolution of the helium in the cold mass and formulating a mathematical model based on energy conservation.

40|$|Considering {{the high}} {{interest}} {{shown in a}} number of Member States, the IAEA established in 2008 the Coordinated Research Project (CRP) on Heat Transfer Behaviour and Thermo-hydraulics Code Testing for SCWRs. The aim was to foster international collaboration in the R&D of SCWRs in support of Member States’ efforts and {{under the auspices of the}} IAEA nuclear Energy Department’s Technical Working Groups on Advanced Technologies for Light Water Reactors (TWG-LWR) and Heavy Water Reactors (TWG-HWR). The two key objectives of the CRP were to establish accurate databases on the <b>thermohydraulics</b> <b>of</b> supercritical pressure fluids and to test analysis methods for SCWR thermohydraulic behaviour to identify code development needs. In total, 16 institutes from nine Member States and two international organizations were involved in the CRP. The thermohydraulics phenomena investigated in the CRP included heat transfer and pressure loss characteristics of supercritical pressure fluids, development of new heat transfer prediction methods, critical flow during depressurization from supercritical conditions, flow stability and natural circulation in supercritical pressure systems. Two code testing benchmark exercises were performed for steady state heat transfer and flow stability in a heated channel. The CRP was completed with the planned outputs in 2012. This publication consists of the background and objectives, descriptions of current SCWR design concepts, and major technical achievements from the CRP tasks based on the results of R&D at participating institutes and through their close collaboration. It provides researchers and engineers with a comprehensive and reliable database, and the current status of prediction methods in the area <b>of</b> <b>thermohydraulics</b> <b>of</b> supercritical pressure fluids relevant to SCWRs.

40|$|Tortuous microchannels have {{attracted}} increasing interest due to great potential to enhance fluid mixing and heat transfer. While the fluid flow and heat transfer in wavy microchannels {{have been studied}} extensively in a numerical fashion, experimental studies are very limited due to the technical difficulties of making accurate measurements in micro-scale flows. This thesis provides insights into <b>thermohydraulics</b> <b>of</b> tortuous microchannels by developing experimental techniques and performing systematic visualisation and heat transfer experiments. The detailed flow patterns (including Dean vortices) and transition behaviours in wavy channels are successfully identified using Micro-Particle Image Velocimetry (micro-PIV) and 3 D reconstruction techniques. Conjugate heat transfer simulations are carried out to understand the complex thermal behaviour present in the current experimental design and to validate and compare with experimental results. The impact of tortuous geometry on flow and heat transfer in microchannels is studied systematically. The high quality experimental data provide {{a new perspective on}} flow behaviour and heat transfer performance in wavy microchannels. In addition, the stackability of channels on a plate is considered. The zigzag pathways are found to provide the greatest heat transfer intensification based on a plate structure. A significant component of the research in this thesis has been the development of experimental techniques to measure local heat transfer rates in microchannels. A two-dye laser induced fluorescence (LIF) technique using temperature sensitive particles (TSPs) is developed with promising characteristics for local temperature measurement and the capability for simultaneous measurement of temperature and velocity fields in microscale systems. The advanced experimental techniques developed in this thesis provide important tools for the investigation <b>of</b> <b>thermohydraulics</b> <b>of</b> various micro-devices in the field of engineering...|$|R

40|$|In {{preparation}} for the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) project, a 40 m-long prototype superconducting magnet string, representing a half-cell of the machine lattice, has been built and operated. The superconducting magnets which comprise this string normally operate in a pressurized static bath of superfluid helium at a pressure of 1 bar and at a temperature of 1. 9 K.

Once properly implemented, two-phase flow of saturated helium II presents overwhelming advantages over the previous solutions, which dictated its choice for cooling below 1. 9 K the long strings of superconducting magnets in the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), a 26. 7 km circumference particle collider now under construction at CERN, the European Laboratory for Particle Physics near Geneva (Switzerland).

40|$|Within the {{framework}} of the European Nuclear Reactor Integrated Simulation Project (NURISP), Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) software is validated for the simulation <b>of</b> the <b>thermohydraulics</b> <b>of</b> pressurized thermal shocks. A proposed validation experiment is the test series performed within the OECD ROSA V project in the Large Scale Test Facility (LSTF). The LSTF is a 1 : 48 volume-scaled model of a four-loop Westinghouse pressurized water reactor (PWR). ROSA V Test T 1 - 1 investigates temperature stratification under natural circulation conditions. This paper describes calculations which were performed with the ANSYS CFD software for emergency core cooling injection into one loop at single-phase flow conditions. Following the OECD-/NEA CFD Best Practice Guidelines (Mahaffy, 2007) the influence of grid resolution, discretisation schemes, and turbulence models (Shear Stress Transport and Reynolds Stress Model) on the mixing in the cold leg were investigated. A half-model was used for these simulations. The transient calculations were started from a steady-state solution at natural circulation conditions. The final calculations were obtained in a complete model of the downcomer. The results are in good agreement with data. ...|$|R
