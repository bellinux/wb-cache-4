In the 1640s there was a sharp fall in population, brought on by the plague epidemic which affected Keswick, Carlisle, Cockermouth and Crosthwaite and other areas in 1645–47.|$|E

The Spannocchi bank, which housed much of Borja's wealth, was said to have nearly crashed after the conclave due to the velocity of transactions.|$|E
5|$|Deities {{were present}} {{not only in}} the heavens, but also in the human body itself. They were {{responsible}} for maintaining the body's five viscera, guarding <b>the</b> <b>registers</b> <b>of</b> life, and regulating the souls. There were five internal deities that were particularly important in Lingbao Daoism. The Great Unity lived in the head, along with Lordling and White Prime, who could descend into the liver and lungs. The Director of Destinies lived in the heart and sexual organs, and finally, the Peach Child lived in the lower dantian. Normally these deities resided in the heavens, but they could be activated by scriptural recitations to descend into the body.|$|E

5|$|Once granted, {{a coat of}} arms {{becomes the}} {{hereditary}} and inheritable property of the owner and his descendants. However, this can only be so if the inheritor is a legitimate male-line descendent of the person originally granted with the arms. To establish the right to arms by descent, one {{must be able to}} prove that an ancestor had his arms recorded in <b>the</b> <b>registers</b> <b>of</b> the College. If there is a possibility of such an inheritance, one must first make contact with an officer-in-waiting at the College, who could then advise on the course of action and the cost of such a search. The research into a descent of arms requires details of paternal ancestry, which will involve the examination of genealogical records. The first step involve a search of the family name in the College's archives, as coats of arms and family name has no connection, the officer could prove, through this method, that there is in fact no descent. However, if a connection is found a genealogical research outside of the College's archives would then be undertaken to provide definitive evidence of descent from an armigerous individual.|$|E

25|$|It is of {{note that}} in 1767 the census divided the {{population}} into three religious categories: British and Protestant; Roman Catholic; and Jews. Being Protestant was explicitly recognized as being British, and the population was broken down into 567 British, 1460 Roman Catholics, and 783 Jews. By 1777, the census had become more complex in that it classified inhabitants as those of 'British Blood', 'Alien Blood', 'Natives', and 'Not natives'. The total number of civilians was 3201, of these 1832 were Roman Catholics, the rest were British Protestants. It is significant to note the appearance of this 'native' element in <b>the</b> <b>registers</b> <b>of</b> 1777, containing the implicit recognition {{of the birth of}} the Gibraltarian.|$|E

25|$|The next {{headmaster}} {{was appointed}} in 1312 as Hugh of Northampton as {{recorded in the}} Bishop's register for that year. He was appointed personally by the Bishop of Worcester, Archbishop of Canterbury, Lord Chancellor Walter Reynolds. The school continued to exist {{under the control of}} the city guilds through the centuries with various records of headmasters being appointed, again listed in <b>the</b> <b>registers</b> <b>of</b> the bishops of Worcester. One in particular was 'Sir Richard (Chaplain)', who was dismissed by the bishop of Worcester, Philip Morgan, in 1422 for taking money from the scholars for his own use. He was replaced the same year by Sir John Bredel. Sir Richard Pynnington was appointed in 1485 and is known to have given money to the Archbishop of Canterbury's fund , showing the strong connection of the school with the church.|$|E
500|$|The {{existence}} of the stone circle indicates that a pagan place of worship existed in the area since prehistory, and although no archaeological evidence exists of any pre-Conquest structure {{on the site of}} the present-day St.Mary's Church other than the stone circle itself, it is considered likely that a wooden church was built on the site by the Anglo-Saxons. The earliest evidence of there being a church in Chesham is in <b>the</b> <b>registers</b> <b>of</b> the Diocese of Lincoln, whose 1153 registers mention [...] "the church in Chesham". In 1257 Hugh deVere was granted the right to hold an annual three-day fair and a weekly market in Chesham by Henry III. The annual fair was to be held on [...] "the eve, the day and the morrow of the Feast of the Assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary", strongly suggesting that Chesham's church was already dedicated to Mary.|$|E
500|$|Peake died in 1619, {{probably}} in mid-October. Until relatively recently, {{it was believed}} that Peake died later. Erna Auerbach, Tudor Artists, London, 1954, p.148, put his death at around 1625, for example. The catalogue for The Age of Charles I exhibition at the Tate Gallery in 1972, p.89, suggested Peake was active as late as 1635. His will was made on 10 October 1619 and proved on the 16th. The date of his burial is unknown because the Great Fire of London later destroyed <b>the</b> <b>registers</b> <b>of</b> his parish church, St Sepulchre-without-Newgate. This was a time of several deaths in the artistic community. Nicholas Hilliard had died in January; Queen Anne, who had done so much to patronise the arts, in March; and the painter William Larkin, Peake’s neighbour, in April or May. Though James I reigned until 1625, art historian Roy Strong considers that the year 1619 [...] "can satisfactorily be accepted as the terminal date of Jacobean painting".|$|E

500|$|The university's {{statutes}} at {{this time}} were written in <b>the</b> <b>registers</b> <b>of</b> the chancellor and proctors. [...] The chancellor's register dated from 1315, and the contents had been confusingly rearranged by rebinding. The two proctors' registers, which dated from 1407 and 1477, were in better arrangement, but repealed statutes remained next to ones that were current. Twyne was first appointed to a 28-strong committee for revising the statutes in 1614, although nothing came of their work. He led {{efforts to improve the}} archives of Corpus Christi in 1627 and 1628, producing 30 volumes of manuscript transcriptions of title deeds. In 1630, Twyne was part of a new delegacy appointed by the new Chancellor of the University William Laud (who was also Archbishop of Canterbury) to revise the statutes. The other members were Robert Pink (Warden of New College), Thomas James (Bodley's Librarian, later replaced on the committee by Peter Turner), and Richard Zouch (Regius Professor of Civil Law). By 1631, an inventory of the university's archives had been made. Twyne, assisted by Zouch, carried out the bulk of the work in drafting new statutes, and it was reported to the university's governing body on 1 September 1633 that work was complete. [...] The Vice-Chancellor asked Turner to make a final revision, and requested that Twyne write a historical account of the previous attempts to reform the statutes as a preface. [...] To Twyne's intense displeasure, the preface that he hurriedly wrote was shortened and rewritten extensively by Turner.|$|E

2500|$|Modern {{linguistics}} {{has come}} to call the resulting variety [...] "Standard Modern Greek" [...] to distinguish it from the pure original Demotic of earlier literature and traditional vernacular speech.

[...] Indeed, Standard Modern Greek has incorporated {{a large amount of}} vocabulary from the learned tradition, especially through <b>the</b> <b>registers</b> <b>of</b> academic discourse, politics, technology and religion; together with these, it has incorporated a number of morphological features associated with their inflectional paradigms, as well as some phonological features not originally found in pure Demotic.|$|E

Sometimes these are twelve-tone complexes and sometimes smaller sets (what Josef Matthias Hauer called “tropes”).
