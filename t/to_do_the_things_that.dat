Garak also admits he killed Tolar {{in order to keep}} his work secret. Garak {{maintains}} that when the Romulans scan the wreckage and find the rod, any imperfections will be attributed to damage from the explosion, and thus the recording will implicate the Dominion as planned. Garak asserts that Sisko included him in the plan <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> Sisko was unwilling to do. Garak also states that Sisko can ease his conscience with the knowledge that the Alpha quadrant may have been saved at the cost of the life of one Romulan senator, one criminal and the self respect of one Starfleet officer, which he calls a bargain.|$|E

Both sides eventually agreed to a March 5 bout, with the vacant IBF Light Welterweight title on the line. Former champion Pernell Whitaker joined Judah's training camp to help him prepare for the match. Whitaker said: [...] "I don't train guys to be like me. I help guys <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> work for them. If I can {{teach you how to}} hit and not get hit, that's a blessing for you. Zab has the same abilities I have, but Zab still has to put it together and do it the way that Zab knows how to do it." [...] On March 5, 2011, Judah defeated Mabuza via technical knockout in the seventh round, at the Prudential Center in Newark, New Jersey, claiming the IBF title again after almost ten years.|$|E

On 20 February 2008 he announced the 2007–08 season {{would be his last}} as a player, although Bradford City would keep his registration, and instead he would join the club's coaching staff. Wetherall said: [...] "I was becoming increasingly frustrated at not being able <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>the</b> <b>things</b> <b>that</b> I {{used to be able to}} do.

[...] Bradford fans held a special day to celebrate Wetherall's career, when they took banners and wore fancy dress and laboratory coats during the club's 1–1 draw with Rotherham United on 22 March 2008. In his penultimate month as a footballer, Wetherall was also named the League Two fans' player of the month by the Professional Footballers' Association. He played his final game for Bradford against Wycombe Wanderers on 3 May 2008 in a 2–1 defeat.|$|E

[...] Philo taught that one does not forget God when one remembers one’s own nothingness and God’s exceeding greatness. Philo interpreted [...] to reprove those who look upon themselves as the cause of what they have received, telling them: [...] "Say not my own might, or the strength of my right hand has acquired me all this power, but remember always the Lord your God, who gives you the might to acquire power." [...] And Philo read [...] to address those who think that they deserve what they have received when it says, [...] "You do not enter into this land to possess it because of your righteousness, or because of the holiness of your heart; but, in the first place, because of the iniquity of these nations, since God has brought on them the destruction of wickedness; and in the second place, that He may establish the covenant that He swore to our Fathers." [...] Philo interpreted the term [...] "covenant" [...] figuratively to mean God’s graces.
