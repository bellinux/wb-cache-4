25|$|Coalitional {{psychology}} is {{an approach to}} explain political behaviors between different coalitions and the conditionality of these behaviors in evolutionary psychological perspective. This approach assumes that since human beings appeared on the earth, they have evolved to live in groups instead of living as individuals to achieve benefits such as more mating opportunities and increased status.

25|$|Many sports popular {{today were}} formalised by British Public schools and {{universities}} in the 19th century. These schools produced the civil servants and military and naval officers required to build and maintain the British empire, and team sports were considered a vital tool for training their students to <b>think</b> <b>and</b> <b>act</b> {{as part of a}} team. Former public schoolboys continued to pursue these activities, and founded organisations such as the Football Association (FA). Today's association of football with the working classes began in 1885 when the FA changed its rules to allow professional players.|$|E
25|$|Mathematics, {{which is}} {{classified}} as a formal science, has both similarities and differences with the empirical sciences (the natural and social sciences). It is similar to empirical sciences in that it involves an objective, careful and systematic study of an area of knowledge; it is different because of its method of verifying its knowledge, using a priori rather than empirical methods. The formal sciences, which also include statistics and logic, are vital to the empirical sciences. Major advances in formal science have often led to major advances in the empirical sciences. The formal sciences are essential {{in the formation of}} hypotheses, theories, and laws, both in discovering and describing how things work (natural sciences) and how people <b>think</b> <b>and</b> <b>act</b> (social sciences).|$|E
25|$|Dr. Elana Maryles Sztokman, in {{her book}} The Men's Section: Orthodox Jewish men in an Egalitarian World {{conducted}} research into the identities and tensions among men who belong to partnership minyans. She found that many Orthodox Jewish men choose to attend these settings due to dissatisfaction with {{the ways in which}} Orthodoxy socializes men into constructs of masculinites. Orthodoxy, according to the research, constructs a masculinity that is rooted in obedience, unquestioning performance, emotionlessless, conformity, and elitism. Men who attend partnership minyans are often disillusioned from those constructs and seek a space where they are welcome to <b>think</b> <b>and</b> <b>act</b> for themselves, to be warm and inclusive, to challenge socially-accepted conventions within Orthodox synagogues, and to act out a less exclusively-cerebral and more humanely emotional-spiritual variation of Jewish masculinity. This book, incidentally, won the 2012 National Jewish Book Council Award.|$|E

This {{does not mean}} that all religious practitioners actually <b>think</b> <b>and</b> <b>act</b> like homo religiosus.

2500|$|Video game {{developer}} Nathan Frost describes Portal as an [...] "exploration of {{a relationship}} with someone with narcissistic personality disorder". He adds {{that in order to}} fulfill her self-centered narcissistic desire to toy with someone, the player-character is trapped in the Enrichment Center, forced to do tricks for the computer. However, once the player-character becomes skilled enough to break the confines of the center, GLaDOS's secure amusement gives way to [...] "histrionic, bipolar deportment". He describes this as a parallel to how a real-life narcissist might attempt to secure the admiration of another person by empowering them in some ways, but limiting them in others. He adds that this works out well for the narcissist until the other person learns to <b>think</b> <b>and</b> <b>act</b> for themselves. He concludes by saying that a part of Portals resonance {{comes from the fact that}} using the portal gun to escape the center is a [...] "cogent metaphor for escaping an intimate relationship with someone diagnosably narcissistic". Grant Tavinor, author of The Art of Videogames, wrote that GLaDOS' actions and personality in Portal were [...] "in the best of science fiction traditions" [...] and describes her as [...] "insincere, malfunctioning, and probably insane". Wendy Despain, author of Writing for Video Games Genres: from FPS to RPG used Portal as an example of a [...] "modern classic" [...] video game and [...] "how they tell their stories". She called GLaDOS an [...] "endlessly cheerful and clearly insane computer" [...] and called her narrative [...] "simple". Emily Short, creator of a female artificial intelligence character in the video game Galatea, speculates that in GLaDOS's final remarks to Chell (“No one likes you, you know”), [...] "there is a hint that she’s talking about herself, not Chell; that she herself desires an emotional connection that she has never been able to achieve, because she also needs to survive, and all humans are a threat to her... learned that the humans view her as potentially threatening and essentially disposable, and so she has to see them the same way." ...|$|E
