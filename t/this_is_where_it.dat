25|$|A leg {{break is}} bowled by holding the cricket {{ball in the}} palm of the hand with the seam running across under all the fingers. As the ball is released, the wrist is rotated to the left and the ball flicked by the ring finger, giving the ball an {{anti-clockwise}} spin as seen from behind. When the ball bounces on the pitch, the spin causes it to deviate towards the left from the bowler's perspective; this is to the right from the batsman's point of view, or towards the off side of a right-handed batsman. The ball spins away from the leg side, and <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>where</b> <b>it</b> gets the name leg break, meaning it breaks away from the leg. The turn is mostly when the ball pitches.|$|E
25|$|Taylor {{built upon}} Heidegger’s work when he {{described}} {{human beings as}} constantly being engaged {{in the process of}} interpreting and re-interpreting themselves using their own unique perspectives based on their thoughts, feelings, and desires. According to Taylor, human beings make sense of their feelings by seeing “them as embodying a judgment about the object they bear on: ‘To experience fear is to experience some object as terrifying or dangerous; to experience shame is to experience some objects as shameful or humiliating” (Taylor: 47, as cited in Richardson et al.: 216). What Taylor is getting at is that Dasein's emotions provides him with a sense of situational understanding and are “affective modes of awareness” (as cited in Richardson et al.: 216). Psychologists practicing ontological hermeneutics in counseling write that this standpoint is in stark contrast to mainstream cognitive approaches which hold that emotions are merely byproducts of our cognitive awareness. Instead, Taylor is taking the cognitive-affective relation out of a linear mode of understanding (thoughts lead to emotions) and placing it phenomenologically in non-linear fashion (thoughts=emotions=interpreted knowledge, meaning they don’t necessarily happen in sequence). This affective mode of awareness serves as more than just knowledge about the world and/or about Dasein, where upon Taylor takes the theory to its logical conclusion: if Dasein's emotions reflect his judgments about the world around him, they also show what is important to him and why. For example, to experience love for another person subjectively informs Dasein that the relationship with that person is important to him. It is through such subjective experience that Dasein's world and his experiences become meaningful to him. Richardson et al. say that this contrast between Taylor’s theory and mainstream approaches has profound implications for conceptualizing human suffering as therapists. Taylor's argument is that emotions are not the mere result of cognitive processes, but subjective judgments about how human beings view their world around them and what is important to them, then it begs questions like what is human suffering, what causes human suffering, is all suffering bad, etc. Taylor, drawing on ontological hermeneutics, takes the phenomenon of human suffering out of the objective, scientific realm (where mainstream psychotherapy has currently placed it) and restores it to the subjective realm of embodied experience. Proponents of ontological hermeneutics state that <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>where</b> <b>it</b> rightfully belongs.|$|E
500|$|For example, {{in a radio}} {{broadcasting}} station the station's large power amplifier is the transmitter; and the broadcasting antenna is the interface between the power amplifier and the [...] "free space channel". The free space channel is the transmission medium; and the receiver's antenna is the interface between the free space channel and the receiver. Next, the radio receiver is the destination of the radio signal, and <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>where</b> <b>it</b> is converted from electricity to sound for people to listen to.|$|E

500|$|Amy Pond (Karen Gillan) {{is trying}} to get the Doctor's (Matt Smith) {{attention}} while he fixes the TARDIS. She discovers that her husband Rory (Arthur Darvill) is helping the Doctor by installing thermal couplings underneath the glass floor of the TARDIS. Rory and Amy then start a small argument about Amy cheating when she took her driving test, when the TARDIS suddenly shakes and the lights go out. The Doctor asks Rory if he dropped a thermal coupling, which Rory admits to and apologises for doing. Amy then apologises as well and, at the Doctor's confusion, explains that Rory was looking up her skirt through the glass floor when he dropped the thermal coupling. The Doctor then notes that they have landed through [...] "emergency materialisation" [...] which should have landed the TARDIS in the safest space available. The lights come on, revealing another TARDIS inside the control room— the TARDIS has materialised inside itself. The Doctor experimentally walks through the door of the TARDIS inside the control room and instantly walks back into the control room through the door of the outer TARDIS. The Doctor tells Rory and Amy that they are trapped in a [...] "space loop" [...] and that nothing can enter or exit the TARDIS ever again. Despite the Doctor's words, another Amy enters through the TARDIS door saying, [...] "Okay, kids, <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>where</b> <b>it</b> gets complicated." ...|$|E
500|$|Brangwyn Hall in Swansea {{was used}} as the museum. Haynes wanted the museum to feel [...] "massive and eerie", and coached Blackwood to [...] "live in the moment". The opening {{sequence}} featuring young Amelia is filmed from her height, and was inspired by Steven Spielberg films in which people would look at things in awe. During this scene Haynes played appropriate music to help Blackwood get into the mood, as he had done during similar scenes when directing [...] "The Pandorica Opens". The set was filled with things that would seem like typical exhibits in the daytime, but appeared spooky at night. The exhibits also included historical anomalies which were the result of history collapsing, such as penguins on the Nile. Though Blackwood appeared as the seven-year-old version of Amy in [...] "The Eleventh Hour", the episode marked the first time Gillan and Blackwood—who are actually cousins—acted together. Gillan initially found this [...] "weird", but she commented that they quickly got used to it. The two versions of Amy were purposely dressed in similar colours. The cold open ends with Amy telling her younger self [...] "Okay kid, <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>where</b> <b>it</b> gets complicated" [...] after she has been revealed in the Pandorica. Moffat, after viewing the rushes, ordered the sequence to be reshot as Gillan had said [...] "really complicated", which conveyed a different meaning. As they had run out of time filming in the museum, all of the shots looking into the Pandorica were filmed three weeks later in the Pandorica chamber set.|$|E

He suggested instead that the name derived from gwylfa, a watching place, noting its similarity with Brown Willy, the name of the highest hill on nearby Bodmin Moor, and suggested that a watch for beacon fires used to be kept here.
