The <b>teaching</b> <b>objective</b> {{of the school}} is to carry out a full Christian education by taking it as a starting point of the realism thomist and the pedagogy of scouting. It is a question of showing, by the practice, the benefits of the traditional scouting which joins with the wisdom of a philosophical thomist in to original reality, by the practice of manual work. Concerning pedagogy scouts compare some to the description given by the historian of scouting Jean-Jacques Gauthé in a newspaper article Le Monde on September 2, 1998 entitled [...] the Little Soldiers of scouting : [...] "Defense of the true scouting, since they estimate that this one was denatured by the Scouts de France ... defense of the true faith through the mass of saint Pie V ... dispute of the values resulting from the Revolution of 1789 ... constant references to the counter-revolution of which they relate to the topics ... the values which they defend are those of the [...] "ongoing beyond of oneself" [...] by demanding physical activities, virility sometimes resulting in a paramilitary style ... the testimony to form a Catholic elite is manifest" ...|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe present {{research}} aims {{to present the}} general framework of an affective teaching system (affective tutoring system - ATS) oriented to engineering education. ATS system is equipped with an emotional agent inspired by the psycho-pedagogical researches of control-value theory that try to estimate the student's emotion during a reusable learning object (RLO), having as a stimulus the ability evaluated by means of item response theory. To present a lesson the RLO model was improved, being organized in a matrix form with five columns and three rows. Each objective of teaching is assigned to a RLO array. The five columns cover a theoretical concept, its properties, relationships between concepts, {{the involvement of the}} human factor in these relationships and conclusions. The three lines cover the following aspects of teaching: theoretical teaching of the five concepts from the columns, teaching practical examples or typical experiment for each column, and on the last line specific exercises that must be solved for each column separately. The RLO matrix object with three rows and five columns has also, besides <b>teaching</b> <b>objective,</b> verification tests associated to each element in the array.

30|$|First, {{consistent}} with similar studies in other domains (e.g., van Driel et al. 1998), our model defines PCK as {{consisting of two}} content components. The first content component is knowledge of teaching objectives, content, and methods, although others have also referred to a narrower category of knowledge of instructional representations. The interdependence of teaching objectives, content, and methods represents the traditional European discourse on didactics (e.g., Bromme 1995; Hopmann and Riquarts 1995). A <b>teaching</b> <b>objective</b> for business and economics, for example, might be to teach students to weigh decisions by considering economic and ecological factors; content might refer {{to the area of}} sales; and an appropriate method might be a role-play. These may refer to a mid-term perspective (i.e., with respect to curriculum) and also to a short-term perspective (i.e., with respect to lesson planning). The second content component is knowledge of students’ learning process, also referred to as knowledge of learning difficulties, which includes awareness of common errors students make and their causes. Both content components are embedded in a broader context, which, for the vocational sector specifically, is characterized by a high heterogeneity (i.e., with respect to students’ prior knowledge), among other things (Kuhn 2014).|$|E

As popularization of higher education arrives in China, colleges continuously increase enrollment, which results in many problems, such as large differences in the quality of student pool and shortage of student resources. Hence, severe challenges are brought to college teaching management, teaching reform and sustainable development of colleges.
