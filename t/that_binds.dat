5|$|An enzyme {{inhibitor}} is a molecule <b>that</b> <b>binds</b> to an enzyme and decreases its activity. Since blocking an enzyme's activity can kill a pathogen or correct a metabolic imbalance, many drugs are {{enzyme inhibitor}}s. They {{are also used}} in pesticides. Not all molecules that bind to enzymes are inhibitors; enzyme activators bind to enzymes and increase their enzymatic activity, while enzyme substrates bind and are converted to products in the normal catalytic cycle of the enzyme.|$|E
5|$|Copper is {{essential}} in the aerobic respiration of all eukaryotes. In mitochondria, it is found in cytochrome c oxidase, which is the last protein in oxidative phosphorylation. Cytochrome c oxidase is the protein <b>that</b> <b>binds</b> the O2 between a copper and an iron; the protein transfers 8 electrons to the O2 molecule to reduce it to two molecules of water.|$|E

50|$|For example, if {{antibodies}} <b>that</b> <b>bind</b> the A {{blood group}} are added and agglutination occurs, {{the blood is}} either type A or type AB. To determine between type A or type AB, antibodies <b>that</b> <b>bind</b> the B group are added and if agglutination does not occur, the blood is type A. If agglutination does not occur with either antibodies <b>that</b> <b>bind</b> to type A or type B antigens, then neither antigen is present on the blood cells, which means the blood is type O.|$|R

5|$|Kulintang {{music has}} no set {{compositions}} {{due to its}} concept of rhythmic modes. A rhythmic mode (or designation or genre or pattern) {{is defined as a}} musical unit <b>that</b> <b>binds</b> together the entire five instrument ensemble. By adding together the various rhythms of each instrument, one could create music and by changing one of the rhythms, one could create different music. This is the basis of the rhythmic mode.|$|E
5|$|Once all {{results have}} {{returned}} to normal, zinc (usually {{in the form of}} a zinc acetate prescription called Galzin) may be used instead of chelators to maintain stable copper levels in the body. Zinc stimulates metallothionein, a protein in gut cells <b>that</b> <b>binds</b> copper and prevents their absorption and transport to the liver. Zinc therapy is continued unless symptoms recur or if the urinary excretion of copper increases.|$|E
5|$|The {{mechanism}} of prion replication {{has implications for}} designing drugs. Since the incubation period of prion diseases is so long, an effective drug {{does not need to}} eliminate all prions, but simply needs to slow down the rate of exponential growth. Models predict that {{the most effective way to}} achieve this, using a drug with the lowest possible dose, is to find a drug <b>that</b> <b>binds</b> to fibril ends and blocks them from growing any further.|$|E

5|$|The {{molecules}} {{bound and}} acted upon by enzymes are called substrates. Although enzymes can consist {{of hundreds of}} amino acids, it is usually {{only a small fraction}} of the residues that come in contact with the substrate, and an even smaller fraction—three to four residues on average—that are directly involved in catalysis. The region of the enzyme <b>that</b> <b>binds</b> the substrate and contains the catalytic residues is known as the active site.|$|E
5|$|Transfer RNA (tRNA) {{is a small}} RNA {{chain of}} about 80 {{nucleotides}} that transfers a specific amino acid to a growing polypeptide chain at the ribosomal site of protein synthesis during translation.

5|$|About 1 in 300 to 500 {{people have}} {{mutations}} in the LDLR gene that encodes the LDL receptor protein, which normally removes LDL from the circulation, or apolipoprotein B (ApoB), {{which is the}} part of LDL <b>that</b> <b>binds</b> with the receptor; mutations in other genes are rare. People who have one abnormal copy (are heterozygous) of the LDLR gene may develop cardiovascular disease prematurely at the age of 30 to 40. Having two abnormal copies (being homozygous) may cause severe cardiovascular disease in childhood. Heterozygous FH is a common genetic disorder, inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern, occurring in 1:500 people in most countries; homozygous FH is much rarer, occurring in 1 in a million births.|$|E
5|$|Fluorine is not {{essential}} for humans or other mammals; small amounts may be beneficial for bone strength, but {{this has not been}} definitively established. As there are many environmental sources of trace fluorine, the possibility of a fluorine deficiency could apply only to artificial diets. Natural organofluorines have been found in microorganisms and plants but not animals. The most common is fluoroacetate, which is used as a defense against herbivores by at least 40 plants in Africa, Australia and Brazil. Other examples include terminally fluorinated fatty acids, fluoroacetone, and 2-fluorocitrate. An enzyme <b>that</b> <b>binds</b> fluorine to carbon – adenosyl-fluoride synthase – was discovered in bacteria in 2002.|$|E
5|$|In glycolysis, {{hexokinase}} {{is directly}} inhibited by its product, glucose-6-phosphate, and pyruvate kinase is inhibited by ATP itself. The main control {{point for the}} glycolytic pathway is phosphofructokinase (PFK), which is allosterically inhibited by high concentrations of ATP and activated by high concentrations of AMP. The inhibition of PFK by ATP is unusual, since ATP is also a substrate in the reaction catalyzed by PFK; the active form of the enzyme is a tetramer that exists in two conformations, only one of which binds the second substrate fructose-6-phosphate (F6P). The protein has two binding sites for ATP– the active site is accessible in either protein conformation, but ATP binding to the inhibitor site stabilizes the conformation <b>that</b> <b>binds</b> F6P poorly. A number of other small molecules can compensate for the ATP-induced shift in equilibrium conformation and reactivate PFK, including cyclic AMP, ammonium ions, inorganic phosphate, and fructose-1,6- and -2,6-biphosphate.|$|E

5|$|The SOS {{response}} is {{the changes in}} gene expression in Escherichia coli and other bacteria in response to extensive DNA damage. The prokaryotic SOS system is regulated by two key proteins: LexA and RecA. The LexA homodimer is a transcriptional repressor <b>that</b> <b>binds</b> to operator sequences {{commonly referred to as}} SOS boxes. In Escherichia coli it is known that LexA regulates transcription of approximately 48 genes including the lexA and recA genes. The SOS {{response is}} known to be widespread in the Bacteria domain, but it is mostly absent in some bacterial phyla, like the Spirochetes.|$|E
5|$|Alison Young {{argues that}} Jackson entrenched section 2(1) of the Parliament Act 1911 by {{requiring}} {{that it only}} be overturned by adopting a specific manner and form (approval of the bill changing the 1911 Act by the House of Lords). She suggests that Lord Steyn and Baroness Hale would explain this result using a self-embracing view of sovereignty – that Parliament {{as a whole is}} sovereign and can therefore to bind later parliaments. The passing of the 1911 Act was from this perspective a redefinition of Parliament <b>that</b> <b>binds</b> the courts. However, she notes that Lord Hope, Lord Nicholls and Lord Carswell provide an alternative explanation for the decision: that the 1911 Act modified the rule of recognition defining valid legal documents. Under this view, the 1911 Parliament did not bind future Parliaments simply by passing the Parliament Act 1911, but by the legislation being recognised, in political fact, as valid; the courts were therefore altering the legal rule of recognition accordingly. This perspective allows the orthodox continuing view of parliamentary sovereignty (that every new parliament is sovereign) to be held while still explaining why future parliaments cannot modify section 2(1) of the 1911 Act.|$|E
5|$|Mups {{are members}} of a large family of low-molecular weight (~19kDa) {{proteins}} known as lipocalins. They have a characteristic structure of eight beta sheets arranged in an anti-parallel beta barrel open on one face, with alpha helices at both ends. Consequently, they form a characteristic glove shape, encompassing a cup-like pocket <b>that</b> <b>binds</b> small organic chemicals with high affinity. A number of these ligands bind to mouse Mups, including 2-sec-butyl-4,5-dihydrothiazole (abbreviated as SBT or DHT), 6-hydroxy-6-methyl-3-heptanone (HMH) and 2,3 dihydro-exo-brevicomin (DHB). These are all urine-specific chemicals that have been shown to act as pheromones—molecular signals excreted by one individual that trigger an innate behavioural response in another member of the same species. Mouse Mups have also been shown to function as pheromone stabilizers, providing a slow release mechanism that extends the potency of volatile pheromones in male urine scent marks. Given the diversity of Mups in rodents, it was originally thought that different Mups may have differently shaped binding pockets and therefore bind different pheromones. However, detailed studies found that most variable sites are located {{on the surface of the}} proteins, and appear to have little effect on ligand binding.|$|E

5|$|The 19S {{particle}} in eukaryotes {{consists of}} 19 individual proteins and is divisible into two subassemblies, a 9-subunit base <b>that</b> <b>binds</b> {{directly to the}} α ring of the 20S core particle, and a 10-subunit lid. Six of the nine base proteins are ATPase subunits from the AAA Family, and an evolutionary homolog of these ATPases exists in archaea, called PAN (Proteasome-Activating Nucleotidase). The association of the 19S and 20S particles requires the binding of ATP to the 19S ATPase subunits, and ATP hydrolysis {{is required for the}} assembled complex to degrade folded and ubiquitinated proteins. Note that only the step of substrate unfolding requires energy from ATP hydrolysis, while ATP-binding alone can support all the other steps required for protein degradation (e.g., complex assembly, gate opening, translocation, and proteolysis). In fact, ATP binding to the ATPases by itself supports the rapid degradation of unfolded proteins. However, while ATP hydrolysis is required for unfolding only, it is not yet clear whether this energy may be used in the coupling of some of these steps.|$|E
5|$|The primary {{mechanism}} for the diversification of venom {{is thought to be}} the duplication of gene coding for other tissues, followed by their expression in the venom glands. The proteins then evolved into various venom proteins through natural selection. This process, known as the birth-and-death model, is responsible for several of the protein recruitment events in snake venom. These duplications occurred in a variety of tissue types with a number of ancestral functions. Notable examples include 3FTx, ancestrally a neurotransmitter found in the brain, which has adapted into a neurotoxin <b>that</b> <b>binds</b> and blocks acetylcholine receptors. Another example is phospholipase A2 (PLA2) type IIA, ancestrally involved with inflammatory processes in normal tissue, which has evolved into venom capable of triggering lipase activity and tissue destruction. The change in function of PLA2, in particular, has been well documented; there is evidence of several separate gene duplication events, often associated with the origin of new snake species. Non-allelic homologous recombination (or recombination between DNA sequences that are similar, but not alleles) has been proposed as the mechanism of duplication of PLA2 genes in rattlesnakes, as an explanation for its rapid evolution. These venom proteins have also occasionally been recruited back into tissue genes. Protein recruitment events have occurred at different points in the evolutionary history of snakes. For example, the 3FTX protein family is absent in the viperid lineage, suggesting that it was recruited into snake venom after the viperid snakes branched off from the remaining colubroidae.|$|E
