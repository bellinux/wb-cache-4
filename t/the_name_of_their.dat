Robinson (1866-1942) and {{his wife}} Marion James Robinson (1873-1919) were wealthy {{residents}} of San Diego, California known for their impact on gardening and the cultivation of flowers, particularly begonias.

Rosecroft was <b>the</b> <b>name</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> estate in the Point Loma neighborhood of San Diego.

5|$|As {{a result}} of his {{business}} career, Romney and his wife had a net worth of between $190 and $250million, including their retirement account, worth between $20 and $100million. Most of that wealth has been held in blind trusts since 2003, some of it offshore. An additional blind trust, valued at $100million in 2012, exists in <b>the</b> <b>name</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> children. In 2010, Romney and his wife received about $22million in income, almost all of it from investments such as dividends, capital gains, and carried interest; and they paid about $3million in federal income taxes, for an effective tax rate of 14percent. For the years 1990–2010, their effective federal tax rates were above 13percent with an average rate of about 20percent.|$|E

5|$|At its {{inception}} {{the team was}} based out of Mok-dong, Seoul and named the Mando Winia. In 1998 the team took the name of Mando's parent company, Halla. After {{the collapse of the}} Korean Ice Hockey League in 2003 they were the only team to survive. They joined four Japanese teams to create the new Asia League Ice Hockey. In 2005 the team relocated and took <b>the</b> <b>name</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> new hometown as their own, playing all current home games out of the Anyang Sports Complex Arena. After two years of finishing in 5th place, they became the first non-Japanese team to finish first in the regular season in 2008–09. However, they failed to defeat the Nippon Paper Cranes in the semi-finals. In the following season Halla again finished in first and managed to win the semi-final and final series giving them their first play-off series win and first Asia League Championship.|$|E
5|$|Coddington {{and several}} others left the colony, {{establishing}} the settlement of Newport {{at the south end}} of the island. The freemen of Pocasset changed <b>the</b> <b>name</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> town to Portsmouth. They adopted a new government which provided for trial by jury and separation of church and state. The men who accompanied Coddington to Newport tended to be the strongest leaders; several became presidents or governors of the entire united colony after 1646, such as Coggeshall, Nicholas Easton, William Brenton, Jeremy Clarke, and Henry Bull. On 12 March 1640, the towns of Portsmouth and Newport agreed to re-unite peacefully. Coddington became governor of the island, and William Hutchinson was chosen as one of his assistants. The towns were to remain autonomous with laws made by the citizens.|$|E

5|$|Henry Henniger, the {{president}} of Kennywood Entertainment Company, wanted a large steel coaster in the late 1980s. The park had only built wooden roller coasters in the past. The park also had a very tight layout {{and they were not}} sure how to fit it into the park. On July 27, 1990, Kennywood announced <b>the</b> <b>name</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> new roller coaster would be Steel Phantom and it would use the same station as Laser Loop, which it replaced. The ride opened on May 10, 1991 as the fastest and steepest steel roller coaster in the world. The inversions were a vertical loop, a Boomerang, and a corkscrew. As a result of the inversions, riders experienced more-than-usual head banging. Shortly after its debut, a trim brake was added because the coaster was going faster than it should through the inversions and riders were experiencing pain in their necks.|$|E
5|$|In {{the week}} before the 2011 Indian Grand Prix, Force India {{announced}} that the Sahara Group had purchased a 42.5% stake in the team, valued at US$100million. The investment gave the Sahara Group and team principal Vijay Mallya an equal stake in the team, with team director Michiel Mol controlling the remaining 15% of the team. Under the terms of the sale, the Sahara Group became Force India's naming-rights sponsor. Mercedes GP also changed <b>the</b> <b>name</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> team, announcing that they were to become known as Mercedes AMG. The new name originates from AMG, Mercedes-Benz's performance and luxury road car brand.|$|E
5|$|The Iazyges, Quadi, Suebi and Marcomanni {{once again}} invaded Roman {{territory}} in 169. The Iazyges led an invasion into Alburnum, {{in an attempt}} to seize its gold mines. Marcus Claudius Fronto, a former general during the Parthian wars, then the governor of both Dacia and Upper Moesia, held them back for some time but was killed in battle in 170. The Quadi were the first to surrender, in 172. The known terms of the peace are that Marcus Aurelius installed a client king, Furtius, on their throne, and the Quadi were denied access to the Roman markets along the limes. The Marcomanni accepted a similar peace, but <b>the</b> <b>name</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> client-king is not known.|$|E

5|$|The Manche Ch'ol were {{a former}} Ch'ol-speaking Maya people inhabiting the extreme south {{of what is}} now the Petén Department of modern Guatemala, the area around Lake Izabal (also known as the Golfo Dulce), and {{southern}} Belize. The Manche Ch'ol took the name Manche from <b>the</b> <b>name</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> main settlement. They were the last group of eastern Cholan-speakers to remain independent and ethnically distinct. It is likely that they were descended from the inhabitants of Classic period (c. 250-900 AD) Maya cities in the southeastern Maya region, such as Nim Li Punit, Copán and Quiriguá.|$|E
5|$|On the January 2 {{episode of}} Raw, the Ladies in Pink turned their {{attention}} to backstage announcer Maria Kanellis, blaming her for Victoria's loss in a match. Victoria announced to Maria that they had a match scheduled that night and proceeded to attack her before the bell. Although Victoria seemed to have the advantage in the match, which included interference from Wilson and Chloe, Victoria was pinned after she attempted an offensive maneuver but missed and ran into the turnbuckle, allowing Maria to pin her. After the match, Candice Michelle, Wilson, and Victoria attacked Maria until Ashley Massaro ran down to the ring to assist Maria. The conflict between the Divas caused the Chairman, Vince McMahon, to make a Bra and Panties Gauntlet match at New Year's Revolution, which Massaro won when she eliminated Victoria by removing her shorts. The next night on Raw, the Ladies in Pink announced that they had changed <b>the</b> <b>name</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> alliance to Vince's Devils. The storyline rivalry with Massaro continued on the January 23 episode of Raw, when Victoria and Candice Michelle were defeated by Trish Stratus and Massaro in a tag team match. At the Royal Rumble on January 30, the three women were shown in backstage segments flirting with McMahon.|$|E
5|$|The {{national}} flag has {{a length of}} 2.20meters and a width of 1.47m, a ratio of 2 to 3. The field is split into three horizontal colored bands, a yellow band of one-half the flag's width, a blue band of one-quarter the width, and a red band of one-quarter the width. All three bands extend {{the full length of}} the flag. The flag is charged with the Ecuadorian coat of arms scaled to one-half the width of the flag and centered in the field. The coat of arms itself is constructed in a rectangle with proportions 12:10. The national standard has the same design as the {{national flag}}, but is square, with length 0.9m and width 0.9m. When used by military units and organizations, lettering can encircle the coat of arms with a diameter of 55 centimeters. The lettering must be 4cm in height, 3cm in width, gold-colored Roman font, embroidered with gold thread. The only other regulated size is a table flag (banderola) where the flag is 200mm wide and 300mm long. When manufacturing the national flag, sellers to the public must include <b>the</b> <b>name</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> company, along with the year of manufacture, by placing a 20 × 10mm tag on the reverse side of the flag on the sleeve.|$|E
