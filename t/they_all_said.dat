25|$|Some of the {{officials}} who fell victim to Lü Yi's abuses of power were the general Zhu Ju, the Imperial Chancellor Gu Yong, and the commandery administrators Diao Jia (刁嘉) and Zheng Zhou (鄭胄). In Zhu Ju's case, which happened sometime in the 230s, Lü Yi falsely accused him of embezzling military funds when some funds designated for Zhu Ju's army went missing. Zhu Ju, unable to explain himself, suffered in silence. The finance officer in his army also died under torture during interrogation. Later, another inspector discovered the real culprit and cleared Zhu Ju's name. As for Gu Yong, Lü Yi initially prepared {{to make a case}} against him for incompetence and ask Sun Quan to remove him from office. However, after an official Xie Gong (謝厷) pointed out that Pan Jun, the Minister of Ceremonies, would most likely become the next Imperial Chancellor if Gu Yong were to be removed from office, Lü Yi immediately dropped the case against Gu Yong because he knew that Pan Jun resented him and would take action against him if he became Imperial Chancellor. In Diao Jia's case, Lü Yi falsely accused him of defaming the imperial court, resulting in an angry Sun Quan ordering Diao Jia's arrest. During the interrogation, when Diao Jia's colleagues were asked whether they heard him defame the imperial court, <b>they</b> <b>all</b> <b>said</b> they did, because they feared retaliation from Lü Yi if they said no. Only Shi Yi said he did not, and he eventually managed to convince Sun Quan that Diao Jia was innocent. In Zheng Zhou's case, earlier on he had arrested and executed Lü Yi's retainer(s) for breaking the law, so Lü Yi bore a grudge against him and spoke ill of him in front of Sun Quan. Sun Quan, believing what Lü Yi said, turned furious and summoned Zheng Zhou to meet him. Pan Jun and Chen Biao spoke up for Zheng Zhou and succeeded in convincing Sun Quan to spare him.|$|E
2500|$|In 1980 the Mariel boatlift brought {{thousands}} of Cuban refugees to the United States. Many of these refugees were musicians, who were astonished {{to hear what}} sounded to them like Cuban music from the 1950s. It {{was as if the}} 60s never happened. Cuban conguero Daniel Ponce summarized this sentiment: [...] "When the Cubans arrived in New York, <b>they</b> <b>all</b> <b>said</b> 'Yuk! This is old music.' The music and the feelings and arrangements [...] changed." [...] In fundamental ways, salsa is the preservation of the late 1950s Cuban sound.|$|E
2500|$|Gilliam also {{positively}} recalled people's {{commitment to}} Ledger's memory: [...] "Everyone {{in the cast}} {{and everyone in the}} crew was determined that this film would be finished and everybody worked longer, harder and somehow we got through. It was really ... people's love for Heath that propelled this thing forward." [...] "All the actors already in the film had to change their schedules, and there wasn't a moment's hesitation. [...] <b>They</b> <b>all</b> <b>said,</b> 'We'll do what's necessary.' It's really a love letter to Heath by everybody involved. He was beloved by so many." ...|$|E

2500|$|On Friday morning, Capt. O’Byrne’s brother Peter, the Section Commander of Unit [...] "D" [...] and Volunteer Willie Bruen {{constructed}} a temporary coffin and buried Whelan’s body under a large heap of clinkers {{in the yard}} of the building outside the engine room. Although the yard was protected from direct fire, the bullets were still ricocheting off the windows and walls of Boland's Mill as Capt. O’Byrne read some prayers and <b>they</b> <b>all</b> <b>said</b> the Rosary. Peter Byrne wanted to leave a sign to indicate that a body {{was buried in the}} yard, but in the confusion and distress of the situation left a sign that read “I.H.S.” instead of the “R.I.P” he intended. Boland's Mill remained under sniper fire until the surrender of the Irish Volunteers on Sunday 30 April 1916.|$|E
2500|$|In late 2006, Scott {{announced}} {{a remake of}} the action thriller The Warriors (1979). [...] "The original Warriors was New York in the 1970s, and everything went upwards, everything went vertically. And now I'm making it a contemporary thing and doing it in L.A., so everything is horizontal. So my vision of The Warriors is Los Angeles in 2007 and the gangs, instead of being 30, {{are going to be}} 3,000 or 5,000," [...] he said. Scott met with actual gang members for research: [...] "I've met all the heads of all the different gangs, so I've already educated myself. <b>They</b> <b>all</b> <b>said,</b> 'Listen dude, if you get this on we'll sign a treaty and we'll all stand on the Long Beach Bridge. There'll be 150,000 members there. It'll look like the L.A. Marathon. Scott was simultaneously developing a drama project titled Emma's War about British foreign aid worker Emma McCune. Scott said in October 2006, [...] "It's been a difficult piece to crack. We had one writer aboard who did a pass at the script and didn't get it, but we've got someone else onboard now who I'm going to make live down there and smell it, touch it, feel it. There's nothing that can compare to that kind of first-hand experience." ...|$|E
2500|$|Sometime in the 230s, Lü Yi, the {{supervisor}} of the audit bureau, falsely accused Diao Jia (刁嘉), the Administrator of Jiangxia Commandery (江夏郡; around present-day Wuhan, Hubei), of defaming the imperial court. Sun Quan was so furious {{when he heard about}} it that he had Diao Jia arrested and imprisoned. During the interrogation, when Diao Jia's colleagues were asked whether they heard him defame the imperial court, <b>they</b> <b>all</b> <b>said</b> they did, because they feared retaliation from Lü Yi if they said no. Shi Yi, however, insisted that he did not hear Diao Jia say anything defamatory. As the investigation dragged on for days, the tone of the imperial edicts issued by Sun Quan on this issue became increasingly harsh and stern, to the point where Shi Yi's colleagues feared for his life. Shi Yi remained unfazed and told Sun Quan, [...] "The sword's blade is now on my neck. Why would I dare to conceal the truth, seek my own death, and end up becoming a disloyal ghost? I only hope that everyone will see the truth." [...] When he was questioned, he answered truthfully and gave consistent responses. Sun Quan eventually believed Shi Yi and spared Diao Jia. The Eastern Jin dynasty historian Xu Zhong (徐眾) praised Shi Yi for maintaining his integrity, standing by his moral principles, and showing moral courage in such a life-threatening situation.|$|E

2500|$|The {{album was}} arranged, rehearsed, and {{recorded}} in five months. Its recording location caused several disagreements within the group. Anderson and Wakeman wished to {{record in the}} countryside, Squire and Howe preferred to record in London, and White had no particular preference. Anderson expressed a wish to record in a forest at night under a tent with electrical generators buried into the ground so they would be inaudible, but [...] "when I suggested that, <b>they</b> <b>all</b> <b>said,</b> 'Jon, get a life!'" [...] Eddy Offord, {{who had worked with}} the group since 1970, assumed his role as their audio engineer and producer who shared production duties with the band. He tried to push Brian Lane, the band's manager, to record in the country, thinking [...] "some flowers and trees" [...] would lessen the tension within the band that the album had caused. A decision was made to stay in London and record at Morgan Studios in Willesden, partly {{due to the fact that}} the studio housed the country's first 24-track tape machine, produced by Ampex, which presented more recording opportunities, though Squire recalled the machine malfunctioned often. Roughly one month into rehearsals, the band took a break from recording, during which Anderson vacated to Marrakesh with his wife, and developed the lyrics during his stay there. Squire worked in the studio for as long as sixteen-hour days, seven days a week on the album.|$|E
2500|$|In an {{interview}} with Australian journalist Nick Milligan on 25 March 2011, Anderson explained, [...] "I was in Los Angeles in 1989 recording an album which the 'Bound For Glory' single came off and I was hanging around with the Gunners {{and a lot of}} other LA bad boy rock bands that we supposedly influenced. I realised then that apart from the fact that I was there to establish myself as a singer songwriter, there was still this great following for the band. I rang up the other members and said 'Let's reform. We've been apart for three years or more.' It was long enough for us to settle our differences and let all the wounds heal. I rang up each of the original members that were still interested and <b>they</b> <b>all</b> <b>said,</b> 'Yeah, let's get together.' So I said we should negotiate a deal where the band can come over and record in Los Angeles. But, of course, that was the year that our original drummer [...] "Digger" [...] Royall kicked his heroin habit. While he was recovering on methadone, cancer exploded through his body, quite sadly. That was the irony of it, because the cancer had been suppressed by the heroin addiction. Within months he was dead. That shook the band so badly on a personal level, because we had been so enthusiastic to reform. We didn't reform until '92. In '93, the word got around, because we had reformed with our existing drummer Paul DeMarco. The Gunners heard we were out playing again and said, 'We want you to do our support gigs throughout Australia.' We did those two Guns N' Roses raceways gigs - Eastern Creek in Sydney and the raceway down in Melbourne." ...|$|E

50|$|Furthermore, all of {{the nine}} factions on the House of Representatives special {{committee}} agreed that there were suspicious and possibly fraudulent transactions during the bailout period beginning in November 2008 and evidence of money laundering. <b>They</b> <b>all</b> then <b>said</b> <b>they</b> lacked the expertise to do more and called on the National Police and Corruption Eradication Commission (KPK) to take over.|$|R
