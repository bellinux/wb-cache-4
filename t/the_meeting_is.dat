Homer gives Smithers his last joint, and while Smithers is smoking it, Burns apparently drowns in his bathtub. For the meeting, Smithers and Homer make Mr. Burns into a marionette, and the movement of the marionette inadvertently gets Mr. Burns' heart working again. <b>The</b> <b>meeting</b> <b>is</b> a success, and another financial crisis at the power plant is avoided.|$|E

30|$|The {{amount of}} time spent in <b>the</b> <b>meetings</b> <b>was</b> {{slightly}} increased in all three companies, and the amount of <b>the</b> <b>meetings</b> <b>was</b> seen to be adequate, as seen in Figs. 2 and 3. According to <b>the</b> interviews, <b>the</b> <b>meetings</b> <b>were</b> also seen worth the time spent. The focus in <b>the</b> <b>meetings</b> <b>was</b> considered to be more on the work at hand, instead of financial and schedule information as had been earlier in <b>the</b> project <b>meetings.</b> This enabled more technical discussion. Especially in the two smaller companies, the teams felt that the regular and systematic <b>meetings</b> enhanced <b>the</b> visibility over the project, which sometimes seemed to proceed quite slowly.|$|R

When he returns from the interview, he reveals he has been invited to a separate meeting with Bubblegum at her castle.

5|$|At Goerdeler's insistence, Stauffenberg {{is ordered}} to assassinate both Hitler and SS head Himmler at the Führer's command bunker, the Wolf's Lair. At a final briefing, Colonel Mertz von Quirnheim instructs the {{committee}} {{members in the}} use of pencil detonators. Stauffenberg also persuades General Fellgiebel, who controls all communications at Wolf's Lair, to cut off communications after the bomb blast. On July15, 1944, Stauffenberg attends a strategy meeting at Wolf's Lair with the bomb in his briefcase, but with Himmler not present at the meeting, Stauffenberg does not get the go-ahead from the committee leaders, and by the time von Quirnheim defies the others and tells him to do it anyway, <b>the</b> <b>meeting</b> <b>is</b> over. Meanwhile, the Reserve Army is mobilized by Olbricht, unbeknownst to Fromm, to stand by. With no action taken, Stauffenberg safely extracts himself and the bomb from the bunker, and the Reserve Army is ordered to stand down, believing that the mobilization was a drill. Back in Berlin, Olbricht and Stauffenberg are threatened by Fromm that if they try to control the reserve army again he will personally have them arrested; Stauffenberg goes to the committee to protest their indecisiveness and condemns Goerdeler, who has been selected to be chancellor after the coup. When Goerdeler demands that Stauffenberg be relieved, Beck informs him that the SS has issued a warrant for his arrest, and that he must leave the country immediately.|$|E
5|$|On 25 May 1940, Leopold met senior {{representatives of}} his Government {{for a final}} time at the Kasteel van Wijnendale in West Flanders. <b>The</b> <b>meeting</b> <b>is</b> {{frequently}} cited as {{the start of the}} Royal Question and the moment of the decisive break between King and Government. Four ministers of the Government were present: Hubert Pierlot, Paul-Henri Spaak, Henri Denis and Arthur Vanderpoorten. By the time of the meeting, {{against the backdrop of the}} bloody Battle of the Lys, the Belgian government was preparing to continue the fight against Germany from exile in France. They urged the King to join them, following the examples of Queen Wilhelmina of the Netherlands and Charlotte, Grand Duchess of Luxembourg. The King rejected their arguments and hardened his own position. He refused to leave Belgian territory and his army in Flanders at any cost. The ministers suspected that Leopold's aides were already negotiating with the Germans. The meeting broke up with no agreement and the Belgian Government left for France.|$|E

5|$|Throughout this, Idelba {{has been}} {{secretly}} working on atomic physics {{and she and}} her fellow researchers have made some disturbing discoveries. They conclude that {{it would be possible to}} make a devastating weapon from nuclear chain reactions and fear that the military will try to create such bombs and restart the war. In order to prevent this, Idelba tries desperately to hide all evidence about her research and contacts concerned scientists in other parts of the world. The government learns of her work however and raids the Zawiyya to get hold of her papers, but Budur manages to hide them. Idelba eventually dies of radiation poisoning from the materials she was working with and leaves all her research to Budur, who keeps her secret and eventually manages to organize an international conference of scientists to discuss the nuclear issue. <b>The</b> <b>meeting</b> <b>is</b> held in Isfahan in Iran (one of the few Islamic nations which has prospered since the war) and scientists from all over the world attend. They agree that none of them will work on the creation of nuclear weapons for their respective countries, no matter what pressure they are put under by their governments and also start a new international scientific movement to break down barriers between cultures in a spirit of reconciliation and friendship (they even create a new scientific calendar to be used by the whole world, with its year zero set from the time of the conference).|$|E

Were this projector destroyed, all creatures would cease to function, and the Overlords would likely be removed whence they came. Having discovered {{the source of the}} Change Radiation - at Mount Silverstone - they set out with Deceptors to find and destroy the source, which would hopefully bring reality back to normal.|$|E

There is then a confirmation of suggestions already put forth in the narration of the 4th strophe. This episode then ends with two strophes of peroration, where Jupiter appeals to the benevolence of the gods concerning the sons of Lusus, with Jupiter's speech eventually settling the debate.|$|E
