5|$|Aphids: There {{are five}} species of aphids {{commonly}} found on apples: apple grain aphid, rosy apple aphid, apple aphid, spirea aphid and the woolly apple aphid. The aphid species {{can be identified}} by their color, <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>of</b> <b>year</b> when they are present and by differences in the cornicles, which are small paired projections {{from the rear of}} aphids. Aphids feed on foliage using needle-like mouth parts to suck out plant juices. When present in high numbers, certain species reduce tree growth and vigor.|$|E
5|$|The 1953 Pacific {{hurricane}} season {{was the least}} active season on record. The season officially began on May 15 in the northeast Pacific Ocean and on June 1 in the central northern Pacific. They ended on November 30. These dates conventionally delimit <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>of</b> <b>year</b> when most tropical cyclones form in northeast Pacific Ocean. Before the satellite age started in the 1960s, data prior to that time on Pacific hurricanes is extremely unreliable as most east Pacific storms are of no threat to land.|$|E

5|$|Tropical Storm Emmy turned {{more to the}} northwest, {{and passed}} about 135miles (220km) {{northeast}} of Barbuda on August 23. The rapid development of an unseasonable frontal low pressure system to the northeast of the storm turned Emmy sharply east-northeastward on August 25. Its eastward movement at such a low latitude for <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>of</b> <b>year</b> was unprecedented. The storm steadily intensified and Emmy attained hurricane status later on the 25th while located 270miles (430km) north of Barbuda.

5|$|An active trough of low {{pressure}} exited the East Coast of the United States on May 12, {{and by the}} following day it passed near Bermuda. Initially the trough was located only near the surface, though as cold air from behind it advanced eastward, the trough extended into the mid- to upper-levels of the atmosphere. By May 14 a closed {{low pressure}} area developed in seclusion from the westerlies. Continued cold air from behind the trough, about 12°F (7°C) colder than usual for <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>of</b> <b>year,</b> extended across the low in conjunction with warm upper levels and warm sea surface temperatures, resulting in large amounts of instability. The polar trough gradually weakened as the low organized, and on May 15 it developed into a subtropical depression while located about 300miles (480km) south of Bermuda.|$|E
5|$|As {{with other}} dwarf sphaeros, {{little is known}} about the ecology and {{behaviour}} of the Virgin Islands dwarf sphaero. Because of its high surface-area-to-volume ratio that results from its diminutive size, the species was thought to be susceptible to water loss, so it has been studied to understand how it survives in its semi-arid habitat. Unlike desert-dwelling lizards, the Virgin Islands dwarf sphaero lacks special adaptations to prevent desiccation and loses water at a rate similar to that of lizards from mesic habitats. From size differences alone, it loses water 70% faster than the larger and sympatric big-scaled least gecko. It survives instead by inhabiting humid microhabitats in its dry environment, by adjusting its reproductive cycle so that hatchlings emerge during <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>of</b> <b>year</b> with the highest precipitation, and by reducing activity during the driest parts of the day.|$|E

5|$|Camouflage is {{a common}} {{defensive}} mechanism in frogs. Most camouflaged frogs are nocturnal; during the day, they seek out {{a position where they}} can blend into the background and remain undetected. Some frogs have the , but this is usually restricted to a small range of colours. For example, White's tree frog (Litoria caerulea) varies between pale green and dull brown according to the temperature, and the Pacific tree frog (Pseudacris regilla) has green and brown morphs, plain or spotted, and changes colour depending on <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>of</b> <b>year</b> and general background colour. Features such as warts and skin folds are usually on ground-dwelling frogs, for whom smooth skin would not provide such effective camouflage. Certain frogs change colour between night and day, as light and moisture stimulate the pigment cells and cause them to expand or contract.|$|E
5|$|He {{opened his}} camp on 11 April 1936 (Easter Even). It was officially opened by Amy Johnson from Hull, {{who had been}} the first woman to fly solo from England to Australia. An {{advertisement}} costing £500 (2011:£) was placed in the Daily Express, announcing the opening of the camp and inviting the public to book for a week's holiday.

5|$|In {{the late}} 17th and 18th Centuries, {{equation}} clocks were made, which allowed {{the user to}} see or calculate apparent solar time, as would be shown by a sundial. Before {{the invention of the}} pendulum clock, sundials were the only accurate timepieces. When good clocks became available, they appeared inaccurate to people who were used to trusting sundials. The annual variation of the equation of time made a clock up to about 15 minutes fast or slow, relative to a sundial, depending on <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>of</b> <b>year.</b> Equation clocks satisfied the demand for clocks that always agreed with sundials. Several types of equation clock mechanism were devised. which can be seen in surviving examples, mostly in museums.|$|E

5|$|Several factors {{combine to}} create the dump months, most of them {{circumstances}} particular to the United States and Canada, the primary market for most major Hollywood releases. Both periods immediately follow <b>the</b> <b>times</b> <b>of</b> <b>year</b> in which <b>the</b> distributors concentrate films they expect {{to be the biggest}} critical and/or commercial successes, periods of increased spending on entertainment generally. While this often means that moviegoers have less disposable income afterwards, economics alone does not explain the dump months. The weather and competition from other forms of mass entertainment, especially professional sports, also play a part; the winter dump months are further affected by the Academy Awards eligibility rules.|$|R

5|$|The 1986–87 South-West Indian Ocean cyclone {{season was}} below average {{due to an}} ongoing El Niño and a weak monsoon that {{suppressed}} convection and storms. There were only five named storms tracked by the Météo-France office (MFR) on Réunion. The United States-based Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) followed four other storms in the basin, which is {{the waters of the}} Indian Ocean south of the equator and west of 90°E to the coast of Africa. The JTWC tracked a storm on August1 in the northeastern portion of the basin, unusual for <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>of</b> <b>year.</b> The first named storm was Severe Tropical Storm Alinina, which originated from the intertropical convergence zone east of Madagascar in the middle of January.

5|$|The wet, or rainy, {{season is}} <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>of</b> <b>year,</b> {{covering}} {{one or more}} months, {{when most of the}} average annual rainfall in a region falls. The term green season is also sometimes used as a euphemism by tourist authorities. Areas with wet seasons are dispersed across portions of the tropics and subtropics. Savanna climates and areas with monsoon regimes have wet summers and dry winters. Tropical rainforests technically do not have dry or wet seasons, since their rainfall is equally distributed through the year. Some areas with pronounced rainy seasons will see a break in rainfall mid-season when the intertropical convergence zone or monsoon trough move poleward of their location {{during the middle of the}} warm season. When the wet season occurs during the warm season, or summer, rain falls mainly during the late afternoon and early evening hours. The wet season is a time when air quality improves, freshwater quality improves, and vegetation grows significantly.|$|E
