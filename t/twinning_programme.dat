40|$|This paper {{contributes}} to recent interest in city twinning by urban theorists. It {{begins with a}} review of writing from across the social sciences which describes the institutional context and content of <b>twinning</b> <b>programmes,</b> as well as work which theorises how care and hospitality are key elements of twinning practices. Ethnographic research is then presented from the City of Manchester (UK) in order to consider {{the ways in which}} twinning is constituted through circuits, networks and webs of co-operation and competition involved in the transfer of policy and knowledge which can be strategic, uneven and at times ambivalent. In doing so, it is argued that the conflicts, tensions and contradictions bound up with twinning have much to offer theoretical and empirical understanding of territorial and relational urban politics. The paper concludes with theoretical, methodological and policy relevant insights. Â© 2012 Urban Studies Journal Limited...|$|R

40|$|Introduction: The Informatics for Health congress, 24 - 26 April 2017, in Manchester, UK, brought {{together}} the Medical Informatics Europe (MIE) conference and the Farr Institute International Conference. This {{special issue of}} the Journal of Innovation in Health Informatics contains 113 presentation abstracts and 149 poster abstracts from the congress. Discussion: The <b>twin</b> <b>programmes</b> of “Big Data” and “Digital Health” are not always joined up by coherent policy and investment priorities. Substantial global investment in health IT and data science has led to sound progress but highly variable outcomes. Society needs an approach that brings together the science {{and the practice of}} health informatics. The goal is multi-level Learning Health Systems that consume and intelligently act upon both patient data and organizational intervention outcomes. Conclusions: Informatics for Health demonstrated the art of the possible, seen in the breadth and depth of our contributions. We call upon policy makers, research funders and programme leaders to learn from this joined-up approach...|$|R
