5|$|The nebular {{hypothesis}} {{is the most}} widely accepted model {{in the field of}} cosmogony to explain the formation and evolution of <b>the</b> <b>Solar</b> System (as well as other planetary systems).

The theory was developed by Immanuel Kant and published in his Allgemeine Naturgeschichte und Theorie des Himmels ("Universal Natural History and Theory of the Heavens"), published in 1755. Originally applied to <b>the</b> <b>Solar</b> System, the process of planetary system formation is now thought to be at work throughout the Universe. The widely accepted modern variant of the nebular {{hypothesis is}} <b>the</b> <b>solar</b> nebular disk model (SNDM) or solar nebular model.

5|$|A recent {{modification}} of the Nice model has <b>the</b> <b>Solar</b> System begin with five giant planets, including an additional ice giant, in a chain of mean-motion resonances. About 400 million years after the formation of <b>the</b> <b>Solar</b> System the resonance chain is broken. Instead of being scattered into the disc, the ice giants first migrate outward several AU. This divergent migration eventually leads to a resonance crossing, destabilizing the orbits of the planets. The extra ice giant encounters Saturn and is scattered inward onto a Jupiter-crossing orbit and {{after a series of}} encounters is ejected from <b>the</b> <b>Solar</b> System. The remaining planets then continue their migration until the planetesimal disc is nearly depleted with small fractions remaining in various locations.|$|E

5|$|Among the {{remaining}} irregular moons, Sao and Laomedeia follow prograde orbits, whereas Halimede, Psamathe and Neso follow retrograde orbits.

Psamathe and Neso have the largest orbits of any natural satellites discovered in <b>the</b> <b>Solar</b> system to date. They take 25 years to orbit Neptune at an average of 125 times the distance between Earth and the Moon. Neptune has the largest Hill sphere in <b>the</b> <b>Solar</b> System, owing primarily to its large distance from the Sun; this allows it to retain control of such distant moons. Nevertheless, Jupiter's S/2003 J 2 orbits at the greatest percentage of the primary's Hill radius of all the moons in <b>the</b> <b>Solar</b> System on average, and the Jovian moons in the Carme and Pasiphae groups orbit at a greater percentage of their primary's Hill radius than Psamathe and Neso.|$|E

5|$|Analyses {{conducted}} contemporarily and independently by Bailey, Batygin and Brown; by Gomes, Deienno and Morbidelli; {{and later}} by Lai suggest that Planet Nine could be responsible for inducing the spin–orbit misalignment of <b>the</b> <b>Solar</b> System.
