He also watched hours of footage of previous episodes {{to get an idea of}} how to portray Declan, then making a statement to Declan fans reading: [...] "I'm sure that initially people will be quite confronted by a new face with the same character name – I'm not fooling myself about that. But hopefully people will come to accept it." [...] Mullally has compared the two versions of Declan saying [...] "One of the writers said to me in a meeting <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>day</b> <b>that</b> the changeover between James and me can be best described as James playing Declan as very strong, macho. He liked to get into things and was very proactive. [...] "The new Declan is more grown up, quite mature and savvy. He thinks with his head and knows what he wants and doesn't have to use brute force to get it." [...] During Rebecca's vision, Thomas Smith portrayed a six-year-old Declan.|$|E
2500|$|The {{selection}} of Greg Inglis by Queensland was disputed. The Queensland Rugby League selected him {{based on the}} fact that either Wavell State High School or Brisbane Norths was Inglis' first senior football, making him eligible for both states per the rules at the time. However Inglis had previously played for Hunter Sports High School in Newcastle, New South Wales, in the Arrive Alive Cup; considered to be a senior competition. Hunter Sports High coach Steve Dunn said [...] "there was some talk <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>day</b> <b>that</b> he was actually brought to Queensland before his 16th birthday but I was coach of the team. He played for us at 16, he's a Blue". The controversy led to the creation of the [...] "That's In Queensland" [...] viral video.|$|E
2500|$|The {{opening of}} 1915 saw growing {{division}} between Lloyd George and Kitchener over {{the supply of}} munitions for the army. Lloyd George considered that a munitions department, under his control, was essential to co-ordinate [...] "the nation's entire engineering capacity". Kitchener favoured the continuance of the current arrangement whereby munitions were sourced through contracts between the War Office and the country's armaments manufacturers. As so often, Asquith sought compromise through committee, establishing a group to [...] "consider the much vexed question of putting the contracts for munitions on a proper footing". This did little to dampen press criticism and, on 20 April, Asquith sought to challenge his detractors in a major speech at Newcastle; [...] "I saw a statement <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>day</b> <b>that</b> the operations of our army were being crippled by our failure to provide the necessary ammunition. There is not a word of truth in that statement." ...|$|E

2500|$|Emerson did {{not become}} an ardent {{abolitionist}} until 1844, though his journals show he was concerned with slavery beginning in his youth, even dreaming about helping to free slaves. In June 1856, shortly after Charles Sumner, a United States Senator, was beaten for his staunch abolitionist views, Emerson lamented that he himself was not as committed to the cause. He wrote, [...] "There are men who {{as soon as they}} are born take a bee-line to the axe of the inquisitor[...] [...] [...] Wonderful {{the way in which we}} are saved by this unfailing supply of the moral element". After Sumner's attack, Emerson began to speak out about slavery. [...] "I think we must get rid of slavery, or we must get rid of freedom", he said at a meeting at Concord that summer. Emerson used slavery as an example of a human injustice, especially in his role as a minister. In early 1838, provoked by the murder of an abolitionist publisher from Alton, Illinois named Elijah Parish Lovejoy, Emerson gave his first public antislavery address. As he said, [...] "It is but <b>the</b> <b>other</b> <b>day</b> <b>that</b> the brave Lovejoy gave his breast to the bullets of a mob, for the rights of free speech and opinion, and died when it was better not to live". John Quincy Adams said the mob-murder of Lovejoy [...] "sent a shock as of any earthquake throughout this continent". However, Emerson maintained that reform would be achieved through moral agreement rather than by militant action. By August 1, 1844, at a lecture in Concord, he stated more clearly his support for the abolitionist movement: [...] "We are indebted mainly to this movement, and to the continuers of it, for the popular discussion of every point of practical ethics".|$|E
