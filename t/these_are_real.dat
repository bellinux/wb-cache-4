500|$|In October 1961, the Bears—utilizing Shaughnessy's complex, {{shifting}} defensive alignments—stifled San Francisco 49ers coach Red Hickey's new shotgun formation, 31–0. Chicago {{had learned}} lessons against the Baltimore Colts who {{had attempted to}} use the shotgun the previous week. Shaughnessy explained his Chicago defensive scheme in November 1961:"We can adjust to fit three things. We have defenses to fit the [...] we face, the personnel we face and {{the situation in the}} game. Bill George calls the basic overall defense. Then Fred Williams calls the defense for the rush men. Richie Petitbon calls the defense for the backs. All of <b>these</b> <b>are</b> <b>real</b> bright boys, and they do a great job." ...|$|E
500|$|Part of Kavner's {{contract}} {{says that}} she will never have to promote The Simpsons on video and she rarely performs Marge's voice in public because she believes it [...] "destroys the illusion. People feel <b>these</b> <b>are</b> <b>real</b> people." [...] Kavner takes recording sessions seriously, and feels that voice acting is, [...] "a little more limiting than live acting. And I {{have nothing to do}} with my character's movement." [...] Nancy Cartwright, who voices Bart Simpson, said in her book My Life as a 10-Year-Old Boy that Kavner is [...] "a workhorse of an actor" [...] with [...] "extraordinary professionalism and quiet work ethic", and notes that she is rarely late for recording sessions.|$|E

500|$|Marge's {{voice is}} {{performed}} by Julie Kavner, who also does {{the voices of}} Marge's mother Jacqueline and her sisters Patty and Selma. Kavner {{had been part of}} the regular cast of The Tracey Ullman Show. Voices were needed for the shorts, so the producers decided to ask Kavner and fellow cast member Dan Castellaneta to voice Marge and Homer rather than hire more actors. Part of Kavner's contract says that she will never have to promote The Simpsons on video and she rarely performs Marge's voice in public because she believes it [...] "destroys the illusion. People feel <b>these</b> <b>are</b> <b>real</b> people." [...] Kavner takes recording sessions seriously and feels that voice acting is [...] "a little more limiting than live acting.

500|$|Swift {{uses her}} life {{experiences}} as an inspiration in her work. In her songs, Swift often addresses the [...] "anonymous crushes of {{her high school}} years" [...] and celebrities. Swift frequently criticizes ex-boyfriends, an aspect of her songwriting downplayed by The Village Voice: [...] "Being told What Songs Mean is like having a really pushy professor. And it imperils a true appreciation of Swift's talent, which is not confessional, but dramatic." [...] However, New York believes the media scrutiny over her decision to [...] "mine her personal life for music … is sexist, inasmuch as it's not asked of her male peers". The singer herself has said that not all her songs are factual {{and that they are}} sometimes based on observations. Aside from her liner note clues, Swift tries not to talk about song subjects specifically [...] "because <b>these</b> <b>are</b> <b>real</b> people. You try to give insight as to where you were coming from as a writer without completely throwing somebody under the bus".|$|E

[...] "This is utter nonsense. We have said this before and we say it again that these documents haven't been verified {{and no one knows}} if <b>these</b> <b>are</b> <b>real</b> KGB papers," [...] said CPI leader Manju Kumar Majumder, when the book was out, Academicians like J.

2500|$|Marsh then studied under Kenneth Hayes Miller and George Luks, {{and chose}} to do fewer {{commercial}} assignments. Miller, who taught at the Art Students League of New York, instructed Marsh on the basics of form and design, and encouraged Marsh to make himself known to the world. He looked at Marsh's early, awkward burlesque sketches and at his more conventional landscape watercolors and said, [...] "These awkward things are your work. <b>These</b> <b>are</b> <b>real.</b> Stick to these things and don't let anyone dissuade you!" [...] By {{the beginning of the}} 1930s Marsh began to express himself fully in his art. As late as 1944 Marsh wrote, “I still show him every picture I paint. I am a Miller student." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "The Manaus were {{neighbors of}} a large lake, & even several Great Lakes; because they are very {{frequent}} in a low country [...] subject to flooding. The Manaus pulled gold from the Yquiari & seized small flakes: <b>these</b> <b>are</b> <b>real</b> facts, which were used in exaggeration, giving rise to the fable {{of the city of}} Manoa & Golden Lake. If we find that there {{is still a long way}} from the small flakes of gold of the Manaus, to the [...] roofs of the town of Manoa, & that there is nonetheless far from the glitter of this metal, ripped from the waters of the Yquiari, to the fable of Parime gold; one cannot deny that on the one hand greed & concern of Europeans who wanted by any force to find what they were looking for, and on the other, clever liars & exaggerating Indians , interested in sending away the uncomfortable visitors, might alter & deface [...] to the point of making them unrecognizable. The history of the discoveries of the new world provides more than one example of similar metamorphoses." ...|$|E

[...] The report noted a published newspaper report regarding Martin's difficulties with the position change the Dolphins made with him days before he left the team and alleged harassment. The Miami Herald noted that the Dolphins were concerned about Martin's reaction to the move, and noted that [...] "It was clear Martin isn't thrilled about the move. [...] "You can approach this two different ways," [...] Martin said. [...] "You can go in the tank and be {{one of those guys who}} bitches and moans and is a cancer in the locker room, or you can be a guy who goes out there and can be a professional and plays as hard as I can."

60|$|The {{spectacles}} {{which were}} exhibited in such buildings as <b>these</b> <b>were</b> usually combats, either {{of men with}} men, or of men with wild beasts. <b>These</b> <b>were</b> <b>real</b> combats, in which either the men or the beasts were actually killed.

2500|$|Autism is {{classified}} by psychologists as a disorder, {{rather than the}} variation in functioning preferred by supporters of neurodiversity, with an attendant focus on the burden placed on society in caring for autistic individuals. Caring for autistic individuals {{has been compared to}} treating a patient with cancer, though extended over the duration of a normal lifespan. Autistic children have also been described as being held hostage to a psychiatric disorder. [...] Others have used the term [...] "mad child disease" [...] to describe autism, which some autistic individuals and their parents have found highly offensive. Margaret Somerville, founding director of the McGill Centre for Medicine, Ethics and Law, said that with activism there is a direct goal and it is sometimes necessary to sacrifice complexity and nuance to make a point, but some autistic activists don't believe desperation justifies the rhetoric. Bennett L. Leventhal said he understands concern about comparing autistic children to hostages but thinks the campaigns make the point that <b>these</b> <b>are</b> <b>real</b> diseases that will consume children if untreated. Autistic rights activists also reject terming the reported increase in autism diagnoses as an 'epidemic' since the word implies autism is a disease.|$|E

50|$|For {{many years}} a montane {{form of the}} {{subspecies}} was recognised, with differences in leaf shape and fruiting structure, {{but it was not}} known whether <b>these</b> <b>were</b> <b>real</b> morphological variations, or simply adaptations to the colder weather at high altitudes.

In other words, we buy and sell for others, with no personal interest in the sale; the bucket-shop is a pure gambling establishment, where men bet on what other men are going to do.

60|$|And {{the city}} itself is a curiosity. Any Indian city is that, {{but this one is}} not like any other that we saw. It is shut up in a lofty turreted wall; the main body of it is divided into six parts by {{perfectly}} straight streets that are more than a hundred feet wide; the blocks of houses exhibit a long frontage of the most taking architectural quaintnesses, the straight lines being broken everywhere by pretty little balconies, pillared and highly ornamented, and other cunning and cozy and inviting perches and projections, and many of the fronts are curiously pictured by the brush, and the whole of them have the soft rich tint of strawberry ice-cream. One cannot look down the far stretch of the chief street and persuade himself that <b>these</b> <b>are</b> <b>real</b> houses, and that it is all out of doors--the impression that it is an unreality, a picture, a scene in a theater, {{is the only one that}} will take hold.|$|E
60|$|The {{spectacles}} {{which were}} {{exhibited by the}} ancients in such buildings as <b>these</b> <b>were</b> <b>real</b> combats of beasts with one another, or of beasts with men, and sometimes of men with one another.
