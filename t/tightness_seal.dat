40|$|The paper {{considers}} a developed computational model {{to study a}} stress-strain state of the assembly unit components of a medium-speed diesel engine of new generation, type CH 26. 5 / 31, which comprises a cylinder head, a sleeve, a gasket, a block, two mounting studs and four power studs. The developed three-dimensional finite element model {{presented in this article}} allows us to take into consideration all the components that make up a gas joint, regardless of their geometric complexity. Its use enables us to estimate the cylinder head - gasket - sleeve <b>tightness</b> of <b>sealing</b> when applying the mounting, temperature, and gas loads, to define the stress and strain components of parts, as well as to study the gasket condition, including pressure distribution across its surface. Based on the results obtained in the study the finite element model of the cylinder head was modified considering a more detailed description of its geometry, thus reducing the principal tensile stresses. </p...|$|R

40|$|In {{fiscal year}} 1993, tests of an o-ring/tetraseal {{retainer}} designed {{to replace a}} gasket-type seal used in PUREX-type process jumper connectors encouraged the design of an improved seal block. This new seal block combines several parts into one unitized component called an integral seal block. This report summarizes development and leak testing of the new integral seal block. The integral seal block uses a standard o-ring nested in a groove to accomplish leak <b>tightness.</b> This <b>seal</b> block eliminates the need to machine acme threads into the lower skirt casting and seal retainers, eliminates tolerance stack-up, reduces parts inventory, and eliminates an unnecessary leak path in the jumper connector assembly. This report also includes test data on various types of o-ring materials subjected to heat and pressure. Materials tested included Viton, Kalrez, and fluorosilicone, with some incidental data on teflon coated silicone o-rings. Test experience clearly demonstrates the need to test each seal material for temperature and pressure in its intended application. Some materials advertised as being {open_quotes}better{close_quotes} at higher temperatures did not perform up to expectations. Inspection of the fluorosilicone and Kalrez seals after thermal testing indicates that {{they are much more}} susceptible to heat softening than Viton...|$|R

40|$|Hermetic sealing {{is a key}} {{requirement}} for the operation of solid oxide fuel cell (SOFC) stacks in a system environment. The sealant material has to withstand stresses due to mechanical loading, mismatch in thermal expansion coefficient and thermal gradients that arise during operation. Based on leakage tests performed at Forschungszentrum Julich {{it was obvious that}} stacks, having been operated successfully in a furnace, are not necessarily usable in a system, e. g. because of deviating pressure differences and temperature gradients. Thorough investigations including stack and stack dummy tests, and finite element modeling (FEM) were performed to get a comprehensive understanding of the various parameters, influencing the leak <b>tightness</b> of the <b>sealing</b> material. It was found that even small temperature differences especially in the area of gas and air manifolds can create excessively high tensile stresses. Based on initial FEM analyses, {{a better understanding of the}} problem has been obtained and a tool was developed that can assist in the design of more robust stacks. These investigations and modeling activities will be continued with a main focus on thermal cycling, which is the next step in the list of requirements. (C) 2010 Elsevier B. V.

40|$|A new {{strategy}} to improve silicon-based endodontic treatment tightness by dentine hydrophobization {{is presented in}} this work: root dentine was silanized to obtain a hydrophobic dentine-sealer interface that limits fluid penetration. This strategy {{was based on the}} grafting of aliphatic carbon chains on the dentine through a silanization with the silane end groups [octadecyltrichlorosilane (OTS) and octadecyltriethoxysilane]. Dentine surface was previously pretreated, applying ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid and sodium hypochlorite, to expose hydroxyl groups of collagen for the silane grafting. Collagen fibers exposure after pretreatment was visible with scanning electron microscopy, and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy showed their correct exposition for the silanization (amide I and II, with 1630, 1580, and 1538 cm⁻¹ peaks corresponding to the vibration of C=O and C [...] N bonds). The grafting of aliphatic carbon chains was confirmed by FTIR (peaks at 2952 and 2923 cm⁻¹ corresponding to the stretching of C [...] H bonds) and by the increasing of the water contact angle. The most efficient hydrophobization was obtained with OTS in ethyl acetate, with a water contact angle turning from 51 ° to 109 °. Gas and liquid permeability tests showed an increased <b>seal</b> <b>tightness</b> after silanization: the mean gas and water flows dropped from 2. 02 × 10 ⁻⁸ to 1. 62 × 10 ⁻⁸ mol s⁻¹ and from 10. 8 × 10 ⁻³ to 5. 4 × 10 ⁻³ µL min⁻¹, respectively. These results show clear evidences to turn hydrophilic dentine surface into a hydrophobic surface that may improve endodontic sealing. Copyright © 2013 Wiley Periodicals, Inc...|$|R
40|$|Process {{safety is}} a task of {{preventing}} leaks. Leak prevention is critical because pressure vessels and piping assets in chemical plants are fabricated from materials which have limited corrosion resistance. When corrosive compounds are processed in these assets, they may suffer degradation over time due to thinning, cracking, or loss of their material properties. This problem is partially controlled by applying a safety margin known called a corrosion allowance. The corrosion allowance is determined by predicting the asset?s expected corrosion rate and its service life. However, this fixed safety margin does not consider the inherent uncertainty in an individual asset?s degradation rate due to variability in the material?s corrosion resistance, the operating parameters of the process, and the inspection techniques {{used to measure the}} progression of corrosion damage over time. Consequently, deterministic analysis is not capable of precisely estimating an asset?s safe operating life during its design stage. One of the most likely areas for leakage to occur in process equipment is at the flange connections that join assets together. Risk analyses for planning inspections of fixed equipment and piping usually treat flanges as components of their parent asset. This thesis focuses on methods to improve prediction and control of corrosion and leakage at flange connections in particular. Flange connection <b>seal</b> <b>tightness</b> can be monitored through vibration-based Non-Destruction Testing (NDT). The data gathered from this monitoring can be used to update risk models for flange connection leakage. Hierarchical Bayesian Network methods of modeling risk are demonstrated in this thesis to be capable of predicting probability of seal failure based on the mean and variance of failure rates in a population of flange connections. This allows for prediction of the probabilities based on corrosion and leak events in the plant. The results of inspection techniques are used as inputs to this risk model, enabling probabilistic decision-making...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: APOLLONSOLAR’s New Industrial Cell Encapsulation (NICE) {{technology}} for the manufacturing of PV modules uses a ribbon of poly-isobutylene (PIB) {{around the perimeter of}} the module in order to seal the inside of the module from the outside atmosphere and provide environmental protection of the cells and interconnectors. The PIB sealing assures a very efficient and long term air/humidity tightness, allowing the establishment of an under pressure inside the module that is used to establish the electrical contact between solar cell busbars and interconnecting wires by pressure, thus avoiding the soldering of these contacts. High module fill factors and low series resistances have been regularly obtained with this type of electrical series connection by under pressure. In order to assure a module lifetime of at least 30 years it is therefore important to avoid degradation of the PIB sealing and associated losses of the under pressure inside the module. Although the gas and humidity tightness of NICE modules has been indirectly demonstrated by the positive degradation test results according to the IEC standard 61215, this work presents a method to directly measure gas leakage rates of the PIB sealing in contact with the materials typically found in NICE modules: Glass, metal sheet and metal sheet covered with an organic electrical insulation coating. With a newly designed experimental set up the long term gas and humidity <b>tightness</b> of different <b>sealing</b> materials was evaluated by monitoring the under pressure in the closed volume of the experimental set up, under different conditions: room temperature, temperature cycles between- 40 °C and + 85 °C, elevated temperatures of + 85 °C at 85 % relative humidity and over an extended time cycle. The obtained results are very encouraging in that no under pressure loss occurred for two out of three tested sealing materials...|$|R
40|$|Planar solid {{oxide fuel}} cells (SOFCs) {{are capable of}} {{achieving}} higher power density than tubular SOFC, but hermetic seals are required to prevent mixing of the fuel and oxidant, It is still a challenge to develop sealing materials that retain desirable physical properties, are chemically compatible with other fuel cell components at high temperature (e. g. 800 °C) {{in a wide range}} of oxygen partial pressure, and remain operational over thousands of hours. In most planar SOFCs stacks designs, the interconnect is sealed to the cell components. The seal between the metal interconnect and the ceramic SOFCs components presents a challenge. Design, development and implementation of reliable sealants may contribute to the destiny of SOFC electrical power-generation technology. Glass-ceramics, which can be prepared by controlled sintering and crystallization of glasses, possess superior mechanical properties and higher viscosity at the SOFC operating temperature than glasses. The application of a protective coating on the alloy surface has been proven as a practical and effective method to reduce corrosion rates and/or inhibit Cr volatilization and thus cathode poisoning. Though some coatings can be highly effective in reducing corrosion rates and reducing area specific resistance of metallic interconnects, their properties for blocking chromium diffusion are limited and need more research on advanced materials and new processing methods. Furthermore, in the complex contest of the SOFC stack, the interconnect/sealant interface plays a key role in the stack reliability, efficiency and durability that depends also on the gas <b>tightness</b> provided by <b>seals</b> during SOFC operation for thousands of hours. It is desirable that reactions between the sealant and the coating or the metallic interconnect are limited during SOFC relevant operating conditions, otherwise spallation and detachments at the interfaces can occur and determine leakage and SOFC degradation. Finally, different approaches are used in this work for the integration (i. e. joining) of ceramic and metallic components in solid oxide fuel cells (SOFCs) stacks, where dissimilar materials have to be joined and sealed for a reliable long-term operation. In particular, the thermo-mechanical compatibility of sealants with other stack components critically influence the reliability and the robustness of SOFCs device...|$|R
40|$|Oxygen {{transport}} membranes (OTM) are {{a promising}} option to supply oxygen for industrial {{processes such as}} syngas production or for high-efficinent carbon capture processes based on oxyfuel combustion. OTM´s consist of a gastight Mixed Ionic Electronic Conductor (MIEC), which possesses infinitive oxygen selectivity, implying a defect-free membrane. At the same time, the oxygen flux in such MIEC membranes increases with decreasing thickness. Typical {{state of the art}} membranes consist therefore of a thin membrane layer with a thickness less than 100 µm and a porous support for mechanical stability (asymmetric membrane). The support must show a low resistance against gas diffusion, requiring a sufficient high porosity in order not to limit the oxygen permeation. In the present study sequential tape casting is used for manufacturing thin, defect free, supported membranes. To achieve sufficient support porosity and low deflection after co-firing, different pore- forming agents were investigated. With regard to ensure chemical compatibility and to avoid thermal expansion mismatch between support and membrane, both were made from the same material. High performance perovskitic membrane materials were used, i. e. Ba 0. 5 Sr 0. 5 Co 0. 8 Fe 0. 2 O 3 -δ (BSCF) and La 0. 6 -xSr 0. 4 Co 0. 2 Fe 0. 8 O 3 -δ (LSCF). The oxygen flux trough the membrane can be further increased by pressurizing the outer feed gas, thus also increasing the driving force. The membrane must be able to withstand such pressure, which can be ensured by the usage of tube shaped membranes or flat sandwich membranes consisting of an inner supporting structure covered completely by a dense membrane layer. A cavity is implemented for efficient removal of the permeated oxygen. Such flat components were manufactured from asymmetric membranes in application relevant sizes of approx. 100 cm 2 by lamination. The laminates can be designed for 4 -End Mode, where the permeated oxygen is removed or reacts with a sweep gas. Also a 3 -End mode is possible, where permeated pure oxygen is removed by a partial vacuum. Both concepts require a sealing of the open support surface at the components’ edges. In this work, ceramic pastes with a high green density were developed to provide a sufficient densification and gas <b>tightness</b> of the <b>sealed</b> areas after sintering. For a reliable operation of the membrane components, concepts for the formation of ceramic to ceramic and ceramic to steel joints are needed. By using brazes and solders which can withstand oxidizing and reducing atmospheres at the same time, a broad range of applications can be covered. According to this requirement, a full ceramic joining, the connection by reactive air brazing with silver/copper oxide-braze, and the soldering with pure silver was investigated. All these techniques were applied in order to build a first short stack for 3 -End operation. Performance of the oxygen flux will be shown and bottlenecks for oxygen transport will be addressed. An outlook for improved membrane components will also be given...|$|R
40|$|Legislation {{introduced}} for Queensland and New South Wales Coal mines provides {{different levels}} of prescription regarding specification of mine seals – generally in relation to capacity to withstand overpressure. In Queensland, the Coal Mining Safety and Health Regulation (2001), Section 341 (d) places a further onus on the statutory ventilation officer to ‘ensure all ventilation control devices at the mine are properly constructed and maintained’ and that the ventilation officer ‘must ensure a ventilation control device mentioned in the regulation … and installed at the mine meets the design criteria stated’ for the ‘type of device’. There is limited or no prescription in regard to: • standards and methods for design; • standards and methods for testing of seals in the ‘lab’ and relating results to field conditions (albeit limited recognised standard test facilities exist); • standards and methods for testing of seals in the field; • requirement to consider specific product types {{in light of the}} particular application and specific locational environment; • site selection for the seal; • consideration of the operational environment of the seal; • consideration of potential water head applied to the seal; • control and state of the ground surrounding the seal; • testing/acceptance criteria for a given seal, identification of defects in installation eg filling voids, etc (other than generic product tests in regard to overpressure/leakage, {{which may or may not}} bear relevance to the specific coal mine application, environment and service duty); • seal leakage limits (although NSW uses the term ‘airtight’); • requirement for and systems to maintain the seal, whether at design rating or otherwise; • guidance in regard to criteria for decisions to repair or identify the need to replace seals; • acceptable and effective methods to complete repair of seals; and • need for methods to assess effectiveness of repair in regard to both leakage and overpressure rating. Based on the experience of the author, it appears that risk management and life cycle approach to seals has not been adopted to the same extent as for other aspects of operations. Further, because of the number of disciplines and personnel involved that may influence various factors affecting seal integrity, the opportunity for oversight or unclear allocation of responsibility is considerable. While suppliers can provide explosion or design rated seals, this should only be a starting point for application of the product in a coal mine. Application is often considered by mine planning staff (taking into consideration mine environment parameters such as water, control of gas, spontaneous combustion risk, etc) in conjunction with the colliery ventilation officer, and then construction completed by contractors under supervision of operational staff. After construction, seals often are managed by operational personnel with input from the ventilation officer. Input of the geotechnical engineer into pillar design, roadway opening size, ground support specification and most stable seal location is also required. The need for a customised design approach for each seal site is proposed in order to take into account the many and variable factors that may influence a site so that improved seal performance reliability and predictability can be developed. A program of quantitative as well as qualitative monitoring of performance and triggers for rectification or maintenance action is required, and would provide support to the aforementioned proposal. Many mines rely on visual/audible inspection and periodic bag sampling as the primary means of assessment. Other significant factors such as seal material properties, rib degradation, convergence, floor heave, effects of water on both structural integrity of the seal as well as the air <b>tightness</b> of the <b>seal</b> do not generally receive the same level of attention. Based on the above observations, the author has compiled a reference checklist in regard to the above matters, including aspects of and approaches to mine and pillar design, geotechnical modelling and data collection, civil engineering design, site evaluation and practical options available. It is apparent that while some research has in isolation examined issues such as overpressure resistance, leakage performance, seal materials, rib sealing, effects of longwall mining and assessment of seal construction and integrity, further research may be required to deliver answers to many of the issues identified above to assist the industry and service providers develop and improve standards...|$|R
