5|$|Philip began besieging Amphipolis in 357 BC; the Amphipolitans, abandoning their anti-Athenian policy, {{promptly}} {{appealed to}} Athens, offering {{to return to}} its control. However, during the siege, Philip {{sent a letter to}} Athens saying that he would hand over the city once he captured it (thus appearing to follow the same policy as he had in 359 BC). The Athenians, thus lulled, waited to see whether he would. The Athenians may also have been unable to send help to Amphipolis. During the summer months, strong northerly winds blew into the Aegean Sea, making it difficult for the Athenians to send ships north. Philip was to make repeated use of the Etesian winds, campaigning during <b>those</b> <b>months</b> (or in winter), when the Athenian navy would be unable to send assistance to his enemies.|$|E
5|$|More than 800,000 Varkaris {{travel to}} Pandharpur for the yatra on Shayani Ekadashi, the 11th {{day of the}} waxing moon in the lunar month of Ashadha. Both Shayani Ekadashi and Prabodhini Ekadashi (in the waxing half of Kartik), are {{associated}} with the mythology of Vishnu. Hindus believe that Vishnu falls asleep in Ksheersagar (a cosmic ocean of milk), while lying on the back of Shesha-nāga (the cosmic serpent). His sleep begins on Shayani Ekadashi (literally the 'sleeping 11th') and he finally awakens from his slumber, four months later, on Prabodhini Ekadashi. The celebrations in Ashadha and Kartik continue until the full-moon in <b>those</b> <b>months,</b> concluding with torchlight processions. Inscriptions dating to the 11thcentury mention the Ekadashi pilgrimages to Pandharpur. On Shayani Ekadashi and Prabodini Ekadashi, the chief minister or a minister of Maharashtra state performs ritual components of worship on behalf of the Government of Maharashtra. This form of worship is known as sarkari-mahapuja.|$|E

The {{city has a}} lengthy wet season that runs from May through February and a short dry season covering the remaining two months.

March and April are Belmopan's driest months with roughly 45mm of rainfall observed on average during <b>those</b> <b>months.</b> Like Belize City, these are somewhat unusual months for {{a city with a}} tropical monsoon climate to have its driest months of the year.

Average monthly temperatures are somewhat constant throughout the course of the year, ranging from 23°C to 28°C.|$|E
25|$|In England, the {{squadron}} went through an intensive training {{program with the}} Royal Air Force. On 17 October 1942, it was assigned Spitfire PR Mk XIs, and late in January 1943, it received its first A-20 Havoc. During <b>those</b> <b>months</b> {{the squadron}} participated in several maneuvers and became a very efficient organization. On 8 July, the unit was re-designated the 12th Reconnaissance Squadron (Fighter). A little later, on 13 July, a reorganization took place and the A-20s, gunners, liaison pilots, {{and most of the}} observers of the squadron were transferred to the 153rd Liaison Squadron. The 12th was then equipped with P-51 Mustangs and F-6 Reconnaissance Mustangs. Late in October, the 12th Squadron was transferred from the VIII Air Support Command to the IX Fighter Command. The unit became highly mobile and proficient at changing airfields on short notice. It would fly from eight English bases before moving to the Continent.|$|E
25|$|The {{friendship}} between Bacalbașa and Mille had soured over <b>those</b> <b>months,</b> and Toni soon left Adevărul for good. It {{is possible that}} this rift occurred because of Beldiman, who ceded his stock to Mille without even considering Bacalbașa for a successor. The issue was {{of interest to the}} entire socialist movement, since Adevărul vied for attention with the same niche of the working public. One of Stere's colleagues, the socialist N. Quinezu, denounced Anton Bacalbașa for being in a conflict of interest, for holding a PSDMR office while still working at Adevărul, and for vetoing funds for the PSDMR sheet Lumea Nouă. On September 25, 1894, Bacalbașa presented his resignation from the PSDMR Council. He also reconciled with Familia, where he published his sketch story La garda pieții ("Guarding the Marketplace", December 1894). Adevărul Literar went out of business on February 13, 1895, and Mille found himself expelled from the PSDMR after the Third Party Congress of April.|$|E
