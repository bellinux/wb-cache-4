In 1990, Nielsen appeared as a Frank Drebin character in advertisements in the United Kingdom for Red Rock Cider.|$|E
5|$|The {{development}} of perspective {{was part of}} a wider trend towards realism in the arts. Painters developed other techniques, studying light, shadow, and, famously in the case of Leonardo da Vinci, human anatomy.

Other notable artists include Sandro Botticelli, working for the Medici in Florence, Donatello, another Florentine, and Titian in Venice, among others.|$|E

5|$|A natural {{experiment}} permitted extensive study of attachment issues as researchers followed thousands of Romanian orphans adopted into Western families {{after the end}} of the Nicolae Ceau≈üescu regime. The English and Romanian Adoptees Study Team, led by Michael Rutter, followed some of the children into their teens, attempting <b>to</b> <b>unravel</b> the effects of poor attachment, adoption, new relationships, physical problems and medical issues associated with their early lives. Studies of these adoptees, whose initial conditions were shocking, yielded reason for optimism as many of the children developed quite well. Researchers noted that separation from familiar people is only one of many factors that help to determine the quality of development. Although higher rates of atypical insecure attachment patterns were found compared to native-born or early-adopted samples, 70% of later-adopted children exhibited no marked or severe attachment disorder behaviours.|$|E

Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) and Skinner are unaware of FBI Special Agent Diana Fowley's (Mimi Rogers) duplicity‚Äîshe is working for Cigarette Smoking Man (William B. Davis). Scully then travels to Africa <b>to</b> <b>unravel</b> the secrets of the alien artifacts, finding something that looks like a spaceship buried under the shoreline off the C√¥te d'Ivoire coast. The object may prove that life originated elsewhere, and all religion is based on the Navajo contact with alien life. Unsuccessful, Scully returns from Africa to revisit Mulder in Washington, D.C., but instead she finds out that he has disappeared. She contacts Kritschgau and Skinner to find her partner. Cigarette Smoking Man has taken Mulder to a place where all his problems seem to have disappeared. Fowley helps Scully locate Mulder, which leads to her death at the hands of Cigarette Smoking Man.|$|E

Over the coming decades, Richard and groups of nobles vied for power and control of policy towards France until Henry of Bolingbroke seized the throne {{with the support of}} parliament in 1399. Ruling as Henry IV, he exercised power through a royal council and parliament, while attempting to enforce political and religious conformity.

40|$|The {{study of}} Rous sarcoma virus (RSV) -infected rat cell clones offers a novel {{approach}} <b>to</b> <b>unravelling</b> the mechanisms controlling eukaryotic gene expression. RSV-transformed rat cell clones frequently contain duplicated proviral sequences immediately upstream of an intact provirus. This category of proviral rearrangement is not seen in cells that remain untransformed after RSV infection nor in subsequently segregating transformants. These results suggest that such rearrangements occur during or soon after proviral integration, and that they may favour early proviral expression...|$|R
