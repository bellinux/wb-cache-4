5|$|Hubble {{has helped}} resolve some long-standing {{problems}} in astronomy, {{as well as}} raising new questions. Some results have required new theories to explain them. Among its primary mission targets was to measure distances to Cepheid variable stars more accurately than ever before, and thus constrain the value of <b>the</b> <b>Hubble</b> constant, {{the measure of the}} rate at which the universe is expanding, which is also related to its age. Before the launch of HST, estimates of <b>the</b> <b>Hubble</b> constant typically had errors of up to 50%, but Hubble measurements of Cepheid variables in the Virgo Cluster and other distant galaxy clusters provided a measured value with an accuracy of ±10%, which is consistent with other more accurate measurements made since Hubble's launch using other techniques. The estimated age is now about 13.7 billion years, but before <b>the</b> <b>Hubble</b> Telescope scientists predicted an age ranging from 10 to 20 billion years.|$|E

5|$|In 2005, the {{diameter}} of Eris {{was measured to be}} , using images from <b>the</b> <b>Hubble</b> Space Telescope (HST). The size of an object is determined from its absolute magnitude (H) and the albedo (the amount of light it reflects). At a distance of 97AU, an object with a diameter of 3,000km would have an angular size of 40milliarcseconds, which is directly measurable with <b>the</b> <b>Hubble</b> Space Telescope. Although resolving such small objects is at the very limit of its capabilities, sophisticated image processing techniques such as deconvolution can be used to measure such angular sizes fairly accurately.|$|E

40|$|<b>The</b> <b>Hubble’s</b> {{constant}} {{is usually}} surmised to be a constant; but the experiments show a large spread and conflicting estimates. According to the plasma-redshift theory, <b>the</b> <b>Hubble’s</b> constant {{varies with the}} plasma densities {{along the line of}} sight. It varies then slightly with the direction and the distance to a supernova and a galaxy. The relation between the magnitudes of type Ia supernovae and their observed redshifts results in an Hubble’s constant with an average value in intergalactic space of 59. 44 km per s per Mpc. The standard deviation from this average value is only 0. 6 km per s per Mpc, but the standard deviation in a single measurement is about 8. 2 km per s per Mpc. These deviations do not include possible absolute calibration errors. The experiments show that <b>the</b> <b>Hubble’s</b> constant varies with the intrinsic redshifts of the Milky Way galaxy and the host galaxies for type Ia supernovae, and that it varies with the galactic latitude. These findings support the plasma-redshift theory and contradict the contemporary big-bang theory. Together with the previously reported absence of time dilation in type Ia supernovae measurements, these findings have profound consequences for the standard cosmological theory.

5|$|There are {{dynamical}} forces {{acting on}} the particles in the Universe which affect the expansion rate. Before 1998, {{it was expected that}} the rate of increase of <b>the</b> <b>Hubble</b> Constant would be decreasing as time went on due to the influence of gravitational interactions in the Universe, and thus there is an additional observable quantity in the Universe called the deceleration parameter which cosmologists expected to be directly related to the matter density of the Universe. In 1998, the deceleration parameter was measured by two different groups to be consistent with −1 but not zero, which implied that the present-day rate of increase of <b>the</b> <b>Hubble</b> Constant is increasing over time.|$|E

A wider but shallower survey was also made as part of the Great Observatories Origins Deep Survey. In 2004 a deeper image, known as <b>the</b> <b>Hubble</b> Ultra-Deep Field (HUDF), was constructed from a few months of light exposure.
