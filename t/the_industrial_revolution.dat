In other words, convergence with new technologies {{is expected}} to create new markets and jobs. <b>The</b> Fourth <b>Industrial</b> <b>Revolution</b> is defined as a technological revolution that fuses digital technology based on <b>the</b> Third <b>Industrial</b> <b>Revolution,</b> and physical and biological fields.|$|R

5|$|From the 18th century onwards, Shaw and Crompton's {{economy was}} closely tied {{with that of}} Britain's textile {{manufacture}} during <b>the</b> <b>Industrial</b> <b>Revolution,</b> particularly the cotton spinning sector.|$|E
5|$|Salford has {{a history}} of textile {{processing}} that pre-dates <b>the</b> <b>Industrial</b> <b>Revolution,</b> and as an old town had been developing for about 700years. Before the introduction of cotton there was a considerable trade in woollen goods and fustians. Other cottage industries prevalent at this time included clogging, cobbling, weaving and brewing. The changes to textile manufacture during <b>the</b> <b>Industrial</b> <b>Revolution</b> {{had a profound effect on}} both on population and urbanisation, as well as the socioeconomic and cultural conditions of Salford.|$|E

50|$|<b>The</b> Second <b>Industrial</b> <b>Revolution,</b> {{also known}} as the Technological Revolution, was a phase of rapid {{industrialization}} in the final third of the 19th century {{and the beginning of the}} 20th. <b>The</b> First <b>Industrial</b> <b>Revolution,</b> which ended in the early to mid 1800s, was punctuated by a slowdown in macroinventions before <b>the</b> Second <b>Industrial</b> <b>Revolution</b> in 1870. Though a number of its characteristic events can be traced to earlier innovations in manufacturing, such as the establishment of a machine tool industry, the development of methods for manufacturing interchangeable parts and the invention of the Bessemer Process to produce steel, <b>the</b> Second <b>Industrial</b> <b>Revolution</b> is generally dated between 1870 and 1914 up to the start of World War I.|$|R
5000|$|<b>The</b> Fourth <b>Industrial</b> <b>Revolution,</b> or 4IR, is <b>the</b> fourth major <b>industrial</b> era since <b>the</b> initial <b>Industrial</b> <b>Revolution</b> of <b>the</b> 18th century. <b>The</b> Fourth <b>Industrial</b> <b>Revolution</b> can be {{described}} as a range of new technologies that are fusing the physical, digital and biological worlds, and impacting all disciplines, economies and industries. Klaus Schwab has associated it with the [...] "second machine age"in terms of the effects of digitization and AI on the economy, but added a broader role for advances in biological technologies.|$|R
5|$|The family symbol in {{advertising}} may be observable before <b>the</b> <b>industrial</b> <b>revolution,</b> {{but it was}} not until after <b>the</b> <b>industrial</b> <b>revolution</b> that advertising boomed and the use of family images {{in advertising}} became prevalent. <b>The</b> <b>industrial</b> <b>revolution</b> changed advertising from informative flyers marking the availability of goods in 17th and 18th century Europe, whose audience were those within physical propinquity, to multimillion-dollar campaigns that attempted to instantly connect and persuade peoples from across the world. After <b>the</b> <b>industrial</b> <b>revolution,</b> large companies emerged as mass-producers, products became branded, and customers began establishing brand loyalties. Thus, persuading customers to purchase one brand rather than another became vital to advertising. An advertisement was responsible for making products and services salient in order to earn consumer attention in competitive industrial markets. During this period, not only did the immensity of the advertising industry drastically change, but so did its marketing strategies as it began to incorporate images and specify an audience. This change from largely informative to largely persuasive strategies and from general to specific audiences explains the increase in presence and usage of symbols, representations, and stereotypes in advertising—including those of the family.|$|E

50|$|Throughout the {{following}} chapters, Lind tries {{to show how}} not only Paterson, but the United States as a whole underwent three <b>industrial</b> <b>revolutions</b> and three republics: The First Republic started after the Revolutionary War and experienced <b>the</b> first <b>industrial</b> <b>revolution</b> in <b>the</b> early nineteenth century. The Second Republic started after the Civil War and experienced <b>the</b> second <b>industrial</b> <b>revolution</b> around <b>the</b> turn of the century, whereas the Third Republic began after the Great Depression and was already {{more than thirty years}} old when <b>the</b> third <b>industrial</b> <b>revolution</b> set in during the 1980s.|$|R

5|$|Before deindustrialisation in {{the late}} 20th century, Astley's economy was linked with the textile {{industry}} and coal mines which developed during <b>the</b> <b>Industrial</b> <b>Revolution.</b> Now the main concentration of employment is at the Chaddock Lane Industrial Estate {{on either side of}} the A572 road between Astley and the East Lancashire Road.|$|E
5|$|Before <b>the</b> <b>Industrial</b> <b>Revolution,</b> {{folklore}} {{often associated}} tuberculosis with vampires.

5|$|Coal lies {{under the}} area of mines opened in <b>the</b> <b>Industrial</b> <b>Revolution,</b> {{providing}} fuel for the cotton spinning and papermaking industries. By the mid-19th century, Radcliffe was an important mill town with cotton mills, bleachworks and a road, canal and railway network.|$|E

5|$|During <b>the</b> <b>Industrial</b> <b>Revolution</b> in Britain, Henry Cort began {{refining}} iron from {{pig iron}} to wrought iron (or bar iron) using innovative production systems. In 1783 he patented the puddling process for refining iron ore. It was later improved by others, including Joseph Hall.|$|E
5|$|Following the Napoleonic wars, Denmark lost Norway and was {{excluded}} from international trade {{for some years}} which caused a recession for Aarhus' trade-based economy that lasted until the 1830s. The economy turned around as <b>the</b> <b>industrial</b> <b>revolution</b> reached the city and factories with steam-driven machinery became more productive.|$|E
5|$|Greater Manchester {{is mainly}} urban, {{and is one}} of the most densely {{populated}} regions in Europe. In the second half of the 18thcentury, <b>the</b> <b>Industrial</b> <b>Revolution</b> played an important role in the growth and development of Manchester and its surrounding area, and industry continues to be a major part of the region's economy. There are few buildings surviving from before <b>the</b> <b>Industrial</b> <b>Revolution,</b> but many from the 19th and 20thcenturies. The bedrock consists mainly of Carboniferous sandstones, including millstone grit, which is a major source of building material for the region's churches. The superficial deposits are of boulder clay, which provides material for making bricks.|$|E

50|$|<b>The</b> First <b>Industrial</b> <b>Revolution</b> {{evolved into}} <b>the</b> Second <b>Industrial</b> <b>Revolution</b> in <b>the</b> {{transition}} years between 1840 and 1870, when technological and economic progress continued {{with the increasing}} adoption of steam transport (steam-powered railways, boats and ships), the large-scale manufacture of machine tools and {{the increasing use of}} machinery in steam-powered factories.|$|R
50|$|Many early textile centers {{developed}} {{as part of}} <b>the</b> American <b>Industrial</b> <b>Revolution.</b> Among them, <b>the</b> Blackstone Valley became {{a major contributor to}} <b>the</b> American <b>Industrial</b> <b>Revolution.</b> <b>The</b> town of Uxbridge, Massachusetts became an early textile center in the Blackstone Valley, which was known for the manufacture of cashmere wool and satinets.|$|R
5|$|In 1516, William IV, Duke of Bavaria, {{adopted the}} Reinheitsgebot (purity law), perhaps the oldest food-quality {{regulation}} {{still in use}} in the 21st century, according to which the only allowed ingredients of beer are water, hops and barley-malt. Beer produced before <b>the</b> <b>Industrial</b> <b>Revolution</b> continued to be made and sold on a domestic scale, although by the 7th century AD, beer was also being produced and sold by European monasteries. During <b>the</b> <b>Industrial</b> <b>Revolution,</b> the production of beer moved from artisanal manufacture to industrial manufacture, and domestic manufacture ceased to be significant {{by the end of}} the 19th century. The development of hydrometers and thermometers changed brewing by allowing the brewer more control of the process and greater knowledge of the results.|$|E
