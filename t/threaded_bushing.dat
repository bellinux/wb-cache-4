50|$|A {{threaded}} insert, {{also known}} as a <b>threaded</b> <b>bushing,</b> is a fastener element that is inserted into an object to add a threaded hole. They may be used to repair a stripped threaded hole, provide a durable threaded hole in a soft material, place a thread on a material too thin to accept it, mold or cast threads into a workpiece thereby eliminating a machining operation, or simplify changeover from unified to metric threads or vice versa.|$|E
40|$|Column length {{adjuster}} {{based on}} turnbuckle principle. Device consists of internally and externally <b>threaded</b> <b>bushing,</b> threaded housing and threaded rod. Housing attached to one part and threaded rod attached to {{other part of}} structure. Turning double <b>threaded</b> <b>bushing</b> contracts or extends rod in relation to housing. Once adjusted, bushing secured with jamnuts. Device used for axially loaded members requiring length adjustment during installation...|$|E
40|$|Flame-detector-rod holder {{is easily}} {{removed from the}} wall of a {{gas-fired}} furnance for maintenance or replacement of the detector rod without requiring shutdown of the furnace. The holder consists of an externally <b>threaded</b> outer <b>bushing,</b> a sleeve which is held inside the outer bushing with a set screw, and a detector rod assembly which screws into the sleeve...|$|R
5000|$|Differential {{adjusters}} - These adjusters {{attain a}} smaller motion than possible from one thread alone {{by using the}} difference between the motions of two nuts moving simultaneously along two different thread pitches on one axle. There are many commercially available versions of these at prices from many times that of the fine <b>threads</b> and <b>bushing</b> alone. With this solution backlash is often a problem as backlash from the two threads combines additively.|$|R
40|$|There was {{a similar}} density of {{honeydew}} threads on the flanks of the StArnaud Range and in southern Big Bush, and {{we suggest that}} the abundance of honeydew threads {{need not be a}} consideration in deciding which of the two areas is selected as a "mainland island". The abundance of honeydew threads/ha was highly variable, particularly along the St Arnaud Range, and this area tended to have more honeydew <b>threads</b> than Big <b>Bush.</b> The abundance of honeydew threads was not measured in the canopy. We may have underestimated the abundance of honeydew threads by a greater degree in Big Bush than StArnaud because the trees tended to be larger there. 1...|$|R
60|$|Each side built forts, facing {{across the}} gorge of a brook. An endless fusillade and {{shouting}} maintained {{the spirit of}} the warriors; and at night, even if the firing slackened, the pickets continued to exchange from either side volleys of songs and pungent pleasantries. Nearer hostilities were rendered difficult {{by the nature of the}} ground, where men must <b>thread</b> dense <b>bush</b> and clamber on the face of precipices. Apia was near enough; a man, if he had a dollar or two, could walk in before a battle and array himself in silk or velvet. Casualties were not common; there was nothing to cast gloom upon the camps, and no more danger than was required to give a spice to the perpetual firing. For the young warriors it was a period of admirable enjoyment. But the anxiety of Mataafa must have been great and growing. His force was now considerable. It was scarce likely he should ever have more. That he should be long able to supply them with ammunition seemed incredible; at the rates then or soon after current, hundreds of pounds sterling might be easily blown into the air by the skirmishers in the course of a few days. And in the meanwhile, on the mountain opposite, his outnumbered adversary held his ground unshaken.|$|R
60|$|Soon after Kwansakru we {{exchanged}} {{the ordinary}} path {{for a mere}} <b>thread</b> in the <b>bush,</b> leading to {{the southern end of}} Tebribi Hill. The name, according to Mr. Sam, means 'when you hear, it shakes,' signifying that the thunder reverberates from the heights owing to its steep side and gives it a tremulous motion. This abrupt, cliff-like side is the western, where the schistose gneiss is exposed for a thickness of 60 feet and more: the stone is talcose, puddinged in places with quartz pebbles, and everywhere showing laminations of black sand. The long oval mound of red clay, overgrown with trees, and rising 295 feet above sea-level, is all auriferous; but there are placers richer than their neighbours. Tebribi was the favourite washing-ground of the Apinto Wásás; but the old shafts were all neglected after the Dutch left, and no deep sinking was known within the memory of man until the last twelve years. I passed a pit on the western flank; the winch had been removed, and my people found it impracticable: we descended to it by cut steps and followed a cornice, mainly artificial, for a short distance to where its mouth opened. This hole had been sunk 70 to 80 feet deep in the talcose stone; {{and it would have been}} far easier and better to have driven galleries and adits into the face of the rock.|$|R
