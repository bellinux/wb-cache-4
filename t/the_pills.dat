40|$|In {{this paper}} we ask how the {{diffusion}} of oral contraception to young unmarried women affected the number and maternal characteristics of children born to these women. Using census data, we find that early pill access led {{to an increase in}} the share of children whose mothers were married, college-educated, and had professional occupations. <b>The</b> <b>pill's</b> effects on <b>the</b> average mother are different from <b>the</b> <b>pill's</b> effects on <b>the</b> average woman, and the effects of <b>the</b> <b>pill</b> on maternal characteristics are in some instances different from the effects of abortion. We investigate the mechanisms by which <b>the</b> <b>pill</b> led to these differential effects and find that access to <b>the</b> <b>pill</b> led to falls in short-term fertility rates for young women and led to decreases in lifetime fertility at the intensive and extensive margins. The impacts of <b>the</b> <b>pill</b> on household characteristics are thus associated with retiming of births, changes in the characteristics of potential mothers, changes in which women become mothers, and by reductions in completed family size. Finally, while <b>the</b> <b>pill</b> affected maternal characteristics differently than abortion, we find suggestive results that availability of <b>the</b> <b>pill</b> lowered abortions among young women. ...|$|R
5|$|After moving in, Moon began a {{prescribed}} course of Heminevrin (clomethiazole, a sedative) to alleviate his alcohol withdrawal symptoms. He {{wanted to get}} sober, but due to his fear of psychiatric hospitals {{he wanted to do}} it at home.

5|$|Players must guide a {{boy scout}} through a 43-room mansion {{in order to}} obtain 16 keys and a {{combination}} before running out of time. These unlock a safe containing <b>the</b> <b>pills</b> needed to save the mansion owner's life. It is necessary to jump onto platforms and evade enemies in order to progress. At the start of the game the player has three lives; a life is lost should the boy scout fall too far or come into contact with one of the mansion's servants or traps. Rooms contain doors that can be entered to move around the mansion, as well as push buttons and hazards. Pressing buttons can result in lifts being activated, platforms appearing or in an enemy appearing. One of the mansion's rooms is a corridor of eight doors with a large pair of eyes above them; this room acts as a maze. A tune is played continuously during play, but can be toggled on or off.|$|E

The Doctor and Donna separately infiltrate the offices of Adipose Industries, each unaware that the other is there. Donna hides out in a toilet cubicle until they close, the Doctor stays in a storage room. As they explore the building, they suddenly encounter each other through opposite windows in an office. They are confronted by Miss Foster, an alien who is using Britain's overweight population to create the Adipose babies for the Adiposian First Family. Miss Foster pursues the Doctor and Donna around the building, finally catching them in an office.

5|$|The {{music video}} begins with Clarkson {{sitting on a}} couch in an apartment's living room, holding a {{heart-shaped}} locket in her hand. The next scene shows Clarkson in the bathroom where she fixes {{her face in the}} mirror, she opens the medicine cabinet and tossing all <b>the</b> <b>pills</b> in the medicine cabinet over her shoulder and messing all the bathroom items on the floor, squirting the toothpaste into the sink. When she gets to a container of birth control pills, she turns on the water in the sink, snaps <b>the</b> <b>pills</b> out, and drops them down the drain. Clarkson then starts to take other items; she throws a container of makeup powder spray in the air and smears a container of facial mud mask on the wall. During the chorus, Clarkson and her band perform the song for a dancing crowd in a club. After the first chorus, Clarkson walks into a room full of closets. She cuts up dresses, rifling through the closets and pulling out clothes, destroying them and singing in a pile of them. After the second chorus, she walks into a bedroom and begins to tear the pillow on the bed, filling the room with feathers. The scenes of Clarkson singing with her band then alternate with a montage of her destroying the apartment, breaks the glass window from the door, breaks the vase, television, clock, fridge, lights, microwave, phone, furniture and the chair. Later, Clarkson takes a framed photo of her ex-boyfriend with another girl in the living room, before pushing a tall CD rack over. She then smashes the framed photo through a glass table, breaking it in half. Having decimated the apartment, Clarkson walks out the door and down the hallway with a hat on her head, just as her ex-boyfriend appears with his girlfriend, walking arm in arm. Clarkson hides her face as she walks away from them. The final scene shows the couple seeing their damaged apartment in shock and the scene of the locket swinging.|$|E

40|$|A pilled fabric image {{consists}} of sub-images of different frequency components, and the fabric texture and <b>the</b> <b>pilling</b> information are in different frequency bands.

A new approach for pilling evaluation based on the multi-scale two-dimensional dualtree complex wavelet transform (CWT) is {{presented in this paper}} to extract <b>the</b> <b>pilling</b> information from <b>pilled</b> fabric images. <b>The</b> CWT method can effectively decompose <b>the</b> <b>pilled</b> fabric image with six orientations at different scales and reconstruct fabric background texture and pilling sub-images. This study used an energy analysis method to search for an optimum image decomposition scale and dynamically discriminate pilling image from noise, fabric texture, fabric surface unevenness, and illuminative variation in <b>the</b> <b>pilled</b> fabric image. For pilling objective rating, six parameters were extracted from <b>the</b> <b>pilling</b> image to describe pill properties.
