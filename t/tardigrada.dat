25|$|The Ecdysozoa are protostomes, {{named after}} the common trait of growth by {{moulting}} or ecdysis. The largest animal phylum belongs here, the Arthropoda, including insects, spiders, crabs, and their kin. All these organisms have a body divided into repeating segments, typically with paired appendages. Two smaller phyla, the Onychophora and <b>Tardigrada,</b> are close relatives of the arthropods and share these traits. The ecdysozoans also include the Nematoda or roundworms, perhaps the second largest animal phylum. Roundworms are typically microscopic, and occur in nearly every environment where there is water. A number are important parasites. Smaller phyla related to them are the Nematomorpha or horsehair worms, and the Kinorhyncha, Priapulida, and Loricifera. These groups have a reduced coelom, called a pseudocoelom.|$|E
25|$|The affinities of tongue worms {{have long}} proved controversial. Historically, they were {{initially}} compared to various groups of parasitic worms. Once the arthropod-like {{nature of their}} cuticle was recognised, similarities were drawn with mites, particularly gall mites (Eriophyidae). Although gall mites are much smaller than tongue worms {{they also have a}} long, segmented body and only two pairs of legs. Later work drew comparisons with millipedes and centipedes (Myriapoda), with velvet worms (Onychophora) and water bears (<b>Tardigrada).</b> Some authors interpreted tongue worms as essentially intermediate between annelids and arthropods, while others suggested that they deserved a phylum of their own. Tongue worms grow by moulting, which suggests they belong to Ecdysozoa, while other work has identified the arthropod-like nature of their larvae, In general, there are two current alternative interpretations: pentastomids are highly modified and parasitic crustaceans, probably related to fish lice, or they are an ancient group of stem-arthropods, close to the origins of Arthropoda.|$|E

2500|$|The sloth's taxonomic {{suborder}} is Folivora, sometimes {{also called}} Phyllophaga (Owen, 1842) or <b>Tardigrada</b> (Latham and Davies, 1795). The first two names both mean [...] "leaf-eaters"; derived from Latin and Greek, respectively. Names {{for the animals}} used by tribes in Ecuador include ritto, rit, and ridette, mostly forms of the word [...] "sleep", [...] "eat", and [...] "dirty" [...] from Tagaeri tribe of Huaorani.|$|E
2500|$|Onychophora (from Ancient Greek, onyches, [...] "claws"; and pherein, [...] "to carry"), {{commonly}} known as velvet worms (due to their velvety texture and somewhat wormlike appearance) or more ambiguously as peripatus (after the first described genus, Peripatus), is a phylum of elongate, soft-bodied, many-legged panarthropods. In appearance they have variously been compared to worms with legs, caterpillars, and slugs. They prey upon smaller animals such as insects, which they catch by squirting an adhesive slime. Approximately 200 species have been described, although the true number of species is likely greater. The two extant families of velvet worms are Peripatidae and Peripatopsidae. They show a peculiar distribution, with the peripatids being predominantly equatorial and tropical, while the peripatopsids are all found south of the equator. It is the only phylum within animalia that is wholly endemic to terrestrial environments. Velvet worms are considered close relatives of the Arthropoda and <b>Tardigrada,</b> with which they form the taxon Panarthropoda. This makes them of palaeontological interest, as they can help reconstruct the ancestral arthropod. In modern zoology, they are particularly renowned for their curious mating behaviour and for bearing live young.|$|E

50|$|The Ecdysozoa {{include the}} {{following}} phyla: Arthropoda, Onychophora, <b>Tardigrada,</b> Kinorhyncha, Priapulida, Loricifera, Nematoda, and Nematomorpha. A few other groups, such as the gastrotrichs, have been considered possible members but lack the main characters of the group, and are now placed elsewhere. The Arthropoda, Onychophora, and <b>Tardigrada</b> have been grouped together as the Panarthropoda because they are distinguished by segmented body plans. Dunn et al. in 2008 suggested that the <b>tardigrada</b> could be grouped along with the nematodes, leaving Onychophora as the sister group to the arthropods.|$|E
