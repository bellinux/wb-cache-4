Two pieces of concept art were also displayed, one of Rocket Raccoon, and one featuring the entire team.

Based on material from the Mass-Observation Archive it argues that control over time is indicative of gender difference and that while largely the product of men and women's different positions vis-a-vis the labour market, there are also unconscious associations around gender and time which affect how successfully each sex manages to control time. Managing their time, like `reconciling' home and work, <b>is</b> felt <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>harder</b> <b>for</b> women than men because they <b>are</b> subject <b>to</b> the simultaneous but contradictory expectations <b>to</b> <b>be</b> both time-conscious and time-less.

40|$|Abstract. Subset sum or Knapsack {{problems}} of dimension n <b>are</b> known <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>hardest</b> <b>for</b> knapsacks of density close to 1. These problems are NP-hard for arbitrary n. One can solve such problems either by lattice basis reduction or by optimized birthday algorithms. Recently Becker, Coron, Joux [BCJ 10] present a birthday algorithm that follows Schroeppel, Shamir [SS 81], and Howgrave-Graham, Joux [HJ 10]. This algorithm solves 50 random knapsacks of dimension 80 and density close to 1 in roughly 15 {{hours on a}} 2. 67 GHz PC. We present an optimized lattice basis reduction algorithm that follows Schnorr, Euchner [SE 03] using pruning of Schnorr, Hörner [SH 95] that solves such random knapsacks of dimension 80 on average {{in less than a}} minute, and 50 such problems all together about 9. 4 times faster with less space than [BCJ 10] on another 2. 67 GHz PC...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. We {{introduce}} a highly structured family of hard satisfiable 3 -SAT formulas corresponding to an ordered spin-glass model from statistical physics. This model has provably “glassy ” behavior; that is, it has many local optima with large energy barriers between them, so that local search algorithms get stuck and have difficulty finding the true ground state, i. e., the unique satisfying assignment. We test the hardness of our formulas with two complete Davis-Putnam solvers, Satz and zChaff, and two incomplete solvers, WalkSAT and the recently introduced Survey Propagation algorithm SP. We compare our formulas to random XOR-SAT formulas and to two other generators of hard satisfiable instances, the minimum disagreement parity formulas of Crawford et al., and Hirsch’s hgen 2. For the complete solvers the running {{time of our}} formulas grows exponentially in √ n, and exceeds that of random XOR-SAT formulas for small problem sizes. More interestingly, our formulas appear <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>harder</b> <b>for</b> WalkSAT than any other known generator of satisfiable instances. ...|$|R
40|$|We {{generally}} {{assume that}} the modality (i. e., number of local optima) of a fitness landscape <b>is</b> related <b>to</b> the difficulty of finding the best point on that landscape by evolutionary computation (e. g., hillclimbers and genetic algorithms (GAs)). This thesis first examines the limits of modality by constructing a unimodal function and a maximally multimodal function. At such extremes our intuition breaks down. A fitness landscape consisting entirely of a single hill leading to the global optimum proves <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>harder</b> <b>for</b> hillclimbers than for GA crossover. A provably maximally multimodal function, in which half the points in the search space are local optima, can be easier than the unimodal, single hill problem for both hillclimbers and GAs. Exploring the more realistic intermediate range between the extremes of modality, local optima are constructed {{with varying degrees of}} "attraction" to evolutionary algorithms. To construct such optima, it <b>is</b> necessary first <b>to</b> define attraction for an a [...] ...|$|R
