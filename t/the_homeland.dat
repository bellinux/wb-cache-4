5000|$|The role of <b>the</b> <b>homelands</b> was {{expanded}} in 1959 {{with the passage}} of the Bantu Self-Government Act, which set out a plan called [...] "Separate Development". This enabled <b>the</b> <b>homelands</b> to establish themselves as self-governing, quasi-independent states. This plan was stepped up under Verwoerd's successor as prime minister, John Vorster, as part of his [...] "enlightened" [...] approach to apartheid. However, the true intention of this policy was to fulfill Verwoerd's original plan to make South Africa's blacks nationals of <b>the</b> <b>homelands</b> rather than of South Africa—thus removing the few rights they still had as citizens. <b>The</b> <b>homelands</b> were encouraged to opt for independence, as this would greatly reduce the number of black citizens of South Africa. The process was completed by <b>the</b> Black <b>Homelands</b> Citizenship Act of 1970, which formally designated all black South Africans as citizens of <b>the</b> <b>homelands,</b> even if they lived in [...] "white South Africa", and cancelled their South African citizenship.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the question of}} whether and how a study of {{the costs and benefits of}} <b>the</b> <b>homelands</b> might be conducted. It is concluded that cost benefit studies of different designs are possible. As others previously have established beyond reasonable doubt, there are positive health benefits from homelands living. Current policy statements by governments regarding centralization of services (and inevitably populations) are a threat to this improved health and, in the current parlance surrounding Aboriginal health, risk widening the health gap rather than closing it. Compiling this report has involved examining in some detail the evidence that exists on the benefits in particular but also <b>the</b> costs of <b>homelands</b> living. There is solid evidence on the health benefits of <b>the</b> <b>homelands.</b> <b>The</b> evidence on the costs of <b>the</b> <b>homelands</b> is not as solid but it does suggest that they are not large and may even involve cost savings to governments. Strangely too the extent to which equity figures as a consideration in debating <b>the</b> <b>homelands</b> is largely absent. The paper argues that it ought not to be. Research for this report has unearthed no evidence to support those current government policies which threaten the existence of <b>the</b> <b>homelands</b> movement. An interim moratorium on policy action on <b>the</b> <b>homelands</b> is proposed until findings are available from the sorts of studies suggested in this report. Only then, once good evidence in a cost benefit framework is available, ought policy decisions be made about the future of <b>the</b> <b>homelands</b> movement...|$|R

5|$|Initially {{reassigned to}} 10./JG 1 {{based in the}} Ruhr, he shot down his first Viermot (four-engined bomber), his 7th victory, on 26 February 1943.

Soon afterward, on 27 March, he was appointed StaKa of the newly reformed 7./JG 1, then in May 1943 he was promoted to Kommandeur of II/JG 11. Jagdgeschwader 11 was a new fighter wing, created in April 1943 by dividing Jagdgeschwader 1 (flying Fw 190s) in half and filling it out into a full wing with new Gruppen flying Me 109G-6 'gunboats', to increase <b>the</b> <b>homeland</b> protection.
