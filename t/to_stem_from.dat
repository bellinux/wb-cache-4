5|$|Born in Exeter around 1125, Baldwin {{was the son}} of Hugh d'Eu, Archdeacon of Totnes, and a {{woman of}} unknown name who later became a nun. Gervase of Canterbury's story that he was from an even humbler {{background}} has been shown by modern scholarship <b>to</b> <b>stem</b> <b>from</b> bias on the medieval chronicler's part. It is possible that he studied at Bologna in the 1150s with the future Pope Urban III. Robert Warelwast, who was Bishop of Exeter from 1138 to 1155, had sent Baldwin to Italy to study law. Baldwin was also said to have taught at Exeter, although this is not substantiated by any contemporary record. In 1150 or 1151 Pope Eugene III appointed him tutor to Eugene's nephew. By 1155 Baldwin seems to have returned to England, where he joined the household of Robert of Chichester, Bishop of Exeter.|$|E
5|$|Myths {{continued}} to grow about supposed beliefs in the redemptive powers of Hope, and in the 1970s a rumour began spread that after Israel defeated Egypt in the Six-Day War, the Egyptian government issued copies of it to its troops. There is no evidence this took place, and the story is likely <b>to</b> <b>stem</b> <b>from</b> {{the fact that in}} early 1974, shortly after the Yom Kippur War between Israel and Egypt, the image of Hope appeared on Jordanian postage stamps. Likewise, it is regularly claimed that Nelson Mandela kept a print of Hope in his cell on Robben Island, a claim {{for which there is no}} evidence.|$|E
5|$|Cockatoos {{are often}} very affectionate with their owner {{and at times}} other people but can demand {{a great deal of}} attention. Furthermore, their intense curiosity means they must be given a steady supply of objects to tinker with, chew, {{dismantle}} and destroy. Parrots in captivity may suffer from boredom, which can lead to stereotypic behaviour patterns, such as feather-plucking. Feather plucking is likely <b>to</b> <b>stem</b> <b>from</b> psychological rather than physical causes. Other major drawbacks include their painful bites, and their piercing screeches. The salmon-crested and white cockatoo species are particular offenders. All cockatoos have a fine powder on their feathers, which may induce allergies in certain people. In general, the smaller cockatoo species such as Goffin's and quieter Galah's cockatoos are much easier to keep as pets. The cockatiel {{is one of the most}} popular and easiest parrots to keep as a pet, and many colour mutations are available in aviculture.|$|E

25|$|Invertebrate fisheries: The main {{invertebrate}} fisheries are in {{the north}} west Hawaiian Islands for slipper and spiny lobster. This fishery started in 1977, peaked in the mid 1980s, and then declined. The decline is thought <b>to</b> <b>stem</b> <b>from</b> oceanographic changes. Some recovery has occurred since 1991, due to entry and harvest restrictions.|$|E

25|$|The {{environmental}} justice problems in North Carolina's agroindustrialization of swine production seem <b>to</b> <b>stem</b> <b>from</b> {{the history of}} the coastal region's economy, which has relied heavily on black and low-income populations to supply the necessary agricultural labor. The industry's shift from family-owned hog farms to factory hogging has contributed to the frequent targeting of these areas.|$|E
25|$|The {{reason for}} this {{uncertainty}} over casualties and the actual date of the massacre appears <b>to</b> <b>stem</b> <b>from</b> {{the fact that the}} incident was only reported and documented several years after its occurrence. The earliest documented mention of the Convincing Ground locality is in an entry of Edward Henty's diary dated 18 October 1835.|$|E
25|$|DMSO is {{marketed as}} an {{alternative}} medicine. Its popularity {{as an alternative}} cure is stated <b>to</b> <b>stem</b> <b>from</b> a 60 Minutes documentary featuring an early proponent. However, DMSO is an ingredient in some products listed by the U.S. FDA as fake cancer cures and the FDA has had a running battle with distributors. One such distributor is Mildred Miller, who promoted DMSO {{for a variety of}} disorders and was consequently convicted of Medicare fraud.|$|E

25|$|Understanding of the Akkadian Empire {{continues}} to be hampered {{by the fact that}} its capital Akkad has not yet been located, despite numerous attempts. Precise dating of archaeological sites is hindered by {{the fact that there are}} no clear distinctions between artifact assemblages thought <b>to</b> <b>stem</b> <b>from</b> the preceding Early Dynastic period, and those thought to be Akkadian. Likewise, material that is thought to be Akkadian {{continues to}} be in use into the Ur III period.|$|E
25|$|This style {{goes back}} to at least as the Heian period. The post has rings carved at the bottom, middle and top, and the {{hexagonal}} base and middle platform are carved with lotuses. The umbrella is simple and has neither warabite nor an ukebana. The yunoki seems <b>to</b> <b>stem</b> <b>from</b> a citron tree that used to stand near the lantern at Kasuga Shrine. This type of lantern became popular in tea house gardens during the Edo Period.|$|E
25|$|Batista's {{backstage}} problems {{continued at}} the 2006 SummerSlam pay-per-view commercial shoot. It {{was reported that}} Batista got into a real-life fistfight with Booker T. The incident was reported on WWE.com, with both men telling their sides of the story. The fight was believed <b>to</b> <b>stem</b> <b>from</b> the idea that Batista considered himself {{to be better than}} the rest of the roster due to his main event status and relatively quick climb to achieve it. It was said that wrestlers backstage were praising Booker for speaking his mind to Batista about his attitude.|$|E

25|$|In Florence, Artemisia {{appears to}} have enjoyed {{significant}} success. She {{was the first woman}} accepted into the Accademia delle Arti del Disegno (Academy of the Arts of Drawing). She maintained good relations with the most respected artists of her time, such as Cristofano Allori, and was able to garner the favors and the protection of influential people, starting with Cosimo II de' Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany and especially of the Grand Duchess, Christina of Lorraine. Her acquaintance with Galileo Galilei, evident from a letter she wrote to the scientist in 1635, appears <b>to</b> <b>stem</b> <b>from</b> her Florentine years.|$|E
25|$|Two {{variants}} (G6PD A− and G6PD Mediterranean) are {{the most}} common in human populations. G6PD A− has an occurrence of 10% of Africans and African-Americans while G6PD Mediterranean is prevalent in the Middle East. The known distribution of the mutated allele is largely limited to people of Mediterranean origins (Spaniards, Italians, Greeks, Armenians, Sephardi Jews and other Semitic peoples). Both variants are believed <b>to</b> <b>stem</b> <b>from</b> a strongly protective effect against Plasmodium falciparum and Plasmodium vivax malaria. It is particularly frequent in the Kurdish population, wherein approximately 1 in 2 males have the condition and the same rate of females are carriers. It is also common in African American, Saudi Arabian, Sardinian males, some African populations, and Asian groups.|$|E
25|$|Rather {{than have}} his ideas {{dismissed}} wholesale because of potential flaws {{in any one}} area, Velikovsky then chose to publish them {{as a series of}} book volumes, aimed at a lay audience, dealing separately with his proposals on ancient history, and with areas more relevant to the physical sciences. Velikovsky was a passionate Zionist, and this did steer the focus of his work, although its scope was considerably more far-reaching than this. The entire body of work could be said <b>to</b> <b>stem</b> <b>from</b> an attempt to solve the following problem: that to Velikovsky there appeared to be insufficient correlation in the written or archaeological records between Biblical history and what was known {{of the history of the}} area, in particular, Egypt.|$|E

25|$|The {{exact number}} of texts in the Kangyur is not fixed. Each editor takes {{responsibility}} for removing texts he considers spurious or adding new translations. Currently {{there are about}} 12 available Kangyurs. These include the Derge, Lhasa, Narthang, Cone, Peking, Urga, Phudrak and Stog Palace versions, each named after the physical location of its printing (or copying {{in the case of}} manuscripts editions). In addition, some canonical texts have been found in Tabo and Dunhuang which provide earlier exemplars to texts found in the Kangyur. The majority of extant Kangyur editions appear <b>to</b> <b>stem</b> <b>from</b> the so-called Old Narthang Kangyur, though the Phukdrak and Tawang editions are thought to lie outside of that textual lineage. The stemma of the Kangyur have been well researched in particular by Helmut Eimer and Paul Harrison.|$|E
25|$|In Ancient Greece, pacifism {{seems not}} to have existed except as a broad moral {{guideline}} against violence between individuals. No philosophical program of rejecting violence between states, or rejecting all forms of violence, seems to have existed. Aristophanes, in his play Lysistrata, creates the scenario of an Athenian woman's anti-war sex strike during the Peloponnesian War of 431–404 BC, and the play has gained an international reputation for its anti-war message. Nevertheless, it is both fictional and comical, and though it offers a pragmatic opposition to the destructiveness of war, its message seems <b>to</b> <b>stem</b> <b>from</b> frustration with the existing conflict (then in its twentieth year) rather than from a philosophical position against violence or war. Equally fictional is the nonviolent protest of Hegetorides of Thasos. Euripides also expressed strong anti-war ideas in his work, especially The Trojan Women.|$|E
25|$|Evolutionary {{psychology}} {{has been}} applied to explain criminal or otherwise immoral behavior as being adaptive or related to adaptive behaviors. Males are generally more aggressive than females, who are more selective of their partners because of the far greater effort they have to contribute to pregnancy and child-rearing, and this is hypothesized <b>to</b> <b>stem</b> <b>from</b> the more intense reproductive competition faced by them. Males of low status may be especially vulnerable to being childless. It may have been evolutionary advantageous to engage in highly risky and be violently aggressive behavior to increase their status and therefore reproductive success. This may explain why males are generally involved in more crimes, and why low status and being unmarried is associated with criminality. Furthermore, competition over females is argued to have been particularly intensive in late adolescence and young adulthood, which is theorized to explain why crime rates are particularly high during this period.|$|E
