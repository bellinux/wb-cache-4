5|$|Prosody is {{the study}} of the meter, rhythm, and {{intonation}} of a poem. Rhythm and meter are different, although closely related. Meter is the definitive pattern established for a verse (such as iambic pentameter), while rhythm is the actual sound that results from a line of poetry. Prosody also may be used more specifically to refer to <b>the</b> <b>scanning</b> of poetic lines to show meter.|$|E
30|$|From {{the above}} expressions, {{we can see}} that {{increasing}} <b>the</b> <b>scan</b> Window Size or Integration size increases <b>the</b> <b>scan</b> time and thus reduces <b>the</b> <b>Scan</b> Rate. However, increasing the Step Size decreases <b>the</b> <b>Scan</b> Rate.|$|R
40|$|An imager or sounder on satellites, {{such as the}} Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite (GOES), in {{geostationary}} orbit (GEO) has a scan mirror and motor in <b>the</b> <b>scan</b> cavity. <b>The</b> GEO orbit is 24 hours long. During part of the orbit, direct sunlight enters <b>the</b> <b>scan</b> aperture and adds heat to components in <b>the</b> <b>scan</b> cavity. Solar heating also increases <b>the</b> <b>scan</b> motor temperature. Overheating of <b>the</b> <b>scan</b> motor could reduce its reliability. For GOES-N to P, a radiator with a thermal louver rejects the solar heat absorbed to keep <b>the</b> <b>scan</b> cavity cool. A sunshield shields the radiator/louver from the Sun. This innovation uses phase change material (PCM) in <b>the</b> <b>scan</b> cavity to maintain the temperature stability of <b>the</b> <b>scan</b> mirror and motor. When sunlight enters <b>the</b> <b>scan</b> aperture, solar heating causes the PCM to melt. When sunlight stops entering <b>the</b> <b>scan</b> aperture, <b>the</b> PCM releases the thermal energy stored to keep the components in <b>the</b> <b>scan</b> cavity warm. It reduces the heater power required {{to make up the}} heat lost by radiation to space through the aperture. This is a major advantage when compared to a radiator/ louver. PCM is compact because it has a high solid-to-liquid enthalpy. Also, it could be spread out in <b>the</b> <b>scan</b> cavity. This is another advantage. Paraffin wax is a good PCM candidate, with high solid-to-liquid enthalpy, which is about 225 kJ/kg. For GOES-N to P, a radiator with a louver rejects the solar heat that enters the aperture to keep <b>the</b> <b>scan</b> cavity cool. For the remainder of the orbit, sunlight does not enter <b>the</b> <b>scan</b> aperture. However, <b>the</b> radiator/louver continues radiating heat to space because the louver effective emittance is about 0. 12, even if the louver is fully closed. This requires makeup heater power to maintain the temperature within the stability range...|$|R

They achieve this by a telephoto-like series of lenses, a four-layer retina and the ability to swivel their eyes and {{integrate}} images from different stages in the scan. The downside is that <b>the</b> <b>scanning</b> and integrating processes are relatively slow.|$|E
5|$|Alfred Eisenack's {{original}} {{description of}} the Chitinozoans placed them in three families, spanning seven genera, based on morphological grounds. Further genera were identified, at first on an annual basis, as time progressed. Since its publication in 1931, Eisenack's original classification has been much honed by these additional discoveries, as well as advances in microscopy. The advent of <b>the</b> <b>scanning</b> electron microscope in the 1970s allowed the improved detection of surface ornamentation which is hugely important in identification - as can be appreciated by {{a comparison of the}} images on this page. Even the light microscope image here is of far greater quality than could have been achieved earlier in the century, using poorly preserved specimens and less advanced microscopes.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>scanning</b> {{tunneling}} microscope is {{a device}} for viewing surfaces at the atomic level. It uses the quantum tunneling phenomenon, which allows particles {{to pass through}} a barrier that would normally be insurmountable. Electrons tunnel through the vacuum between two planar metal electrodes, on {{each of which is}} an adsorbed atom, providing a tunneling-current density that can be measured. Scanning one atom (taken as the tip) as it moves past the other (the sample) permits plotting of tip displacement versus lateral separation for a constant current. The calculation shows the extent to which scanning-tunneling-microscope images of an individual atom are visible. It confirms that for low bias, the microscope images the space-averaged dimensions of the electron orbitals across closely packed energy levels—the Fermi level local density of states.|$|E

5|$|The {{specific}} {{access method}} {{will depend on}} the skills and abilities of the user. With direct selection a body part, pointer, adapted mouse, joystick, or eye tracking could be used, whereas switch access scanning is often used for indirect selection. Unlike direct selection (e.g., typing on a keyboard, touching a screen), users of Target Scanning can only make selections when <b>the</b> <b>scanning</b> indicator (or cursor) of the electronic device is on the desired choice. Those who are unable to point typically calibrate their eyes to use eye gaze as a way to point and blocking as a way to select desired words and phrases. The speed and pattern of scanning, as well as the way items are selected, are individualized to the physical, visual and cognitive capabilities of the user.|$|E
25|$|There {{are several}} {{important}} modern developments. The {{atomic force microscope}} (AFM) and <b>the</b> <b>Scanning</b> Tunneling Microscope (STM) are two early versions of scanning probes that launched nanotechnology.

Although conceptually similar to <b>the</b> <b>scanning</b> confocal microscope developed by Marvin Minsky in 1961 and <b>the</b> <b>scanning</b> acoustic microscope (SAM) developed by Calvin Quate and coworkers in the 1970s, newer scanning probe microscopes have much higher resolution, since they are not limited by the wavelength of sound or light.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>scanning</b> {{tunneling}} microscope {{can remove}} SAM molecules {{in many different}} ways. The first is to remove them mechanically by dragging the tip across the substrate surface. This {{is not the most}} desired technique as these tips are expensive and dragging them causes a lot of wear and reduction of the tip quality. The second way is to degrade or desorb the SAM molecules by shooting them with an electron beam. <b>The</b> <b>scanning</b> tunneling microscope can also remove SAMs by field desorption and field enhanced surface diffusion.|$|E
40|$|Designing a scannable circuit is {{typically}} a two-step process.

When <b>the</b> <b>scan</b> path is considered during the synthesis of a circuit rather than after the synthesis, the overhead due to <b>the</b> <b>scan</b> path can be reduced. We present beneficial scan, a synthesis-for-scan technique that orders <b>the</b> <b>scan</b> path(s) during logic synthesis to maximize the amount of sharing that can take place between the functional and test logic and thereby minimize the area and performance overhead due to <b>the</b> <b>scan</b> path.
