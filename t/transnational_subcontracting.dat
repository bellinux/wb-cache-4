40|$|This paper {{suggests}} {{a need to}} pay closer {{attention to the fact}} that employment is increasingly stretched across several regulatory regimes. This may help explain why governments, which rely on national legislative frameworks, struggle to protect the interests of transnationally mobile low-skilled workers. By adopting a topological approach to state regulation and authority, the paper demonstrates how powerful actors have reconfigured employment in Sweden’s wild berry industry in a spatial sense by engaging transnational subcontractors. It argues that <b>transnational</b> <b>subcontracting</b> inserts distance into employment relationships, thereby creating precarious migrant workers whose simultaneous absence and presence in several regulatory regimes places them partly beyond the regulatory reach of any one nation-state or nationally based trade union. The paper also argues that the Swedish government’s response to precarious working conditions in the wild berry industry can be understood as a series of attempts aimed at bringing transnational employment relationships within its regulatory reach. Drawing on topological spatial vocabulary, it shows how these attempts are less about the movement of state infrastructure into transnational space than about the stretching and folding of space itself, in an attempt to establish a powerful Swedish presence across distance. On the other hand, the paper concludes that <b>transnational</b> <b>subcontracting</b> opens up a space which enables wild berry actors to circumvent regulations and, as such, it remains very difficult for the Swedish government to reach into employment relationships in this industry...|$|E
40|$|The authors {{identify}} the increasing diversity of policing provisions {{and the new}} "policing family," which includes diverse public (state-sponsored) policing providers {{as well as a}} number of private and civil-society providers. Collectively, these providers have posed major challenges for effective and coherent regimes of management and public accountability. The authors analyze these developments at the international level, explore the challenges for effective management and accountability, and consider some of the options for addressing these challenges. The analysis focuses on the "peace and stability operations" sector which encompasses many of the problems that arise in transnational commercial security (TCS) as a whole. Accountability is particularly elusive when it involves interactions and cooperation among TCS organizations, states, and non-state bodies. Drawing on this analysis, the chapter considers the "tangled web" of management and accountability sources regarding TCS operations. Challenges include the widespread lack of transparency in financial relations among contractors and companies, the obscure <b>transnational</b> <b>subcontracting</b> arrangements, and the ambiguous legal status of those working in TCS companies. In addressing these issues of management and accountability, the authors find promise in Cockayne's (2008) writings regarding the private military sector. Cockayne suggests that the focus should be on the creation of hybrid or multiplex forms of regulation that combine state, market, and normative regulatory power. Such mechanisms for accountability will involve state-based legislation and judicial action, as well as transnational political mobilization for norm-setting and interaction with the security industry in fostering changes in values, policies, and practices. Under such multiplex regimes, the governance role would include state bodies, processional associations, industry associations, accreditation bodies, labor unions, and businesses and financial institutions that fund and serve the needs of transnational security enterprises.

40|$|The EU {{regulatory}} regime and employers’ cross-border recruitment practices complicate unions’ ability to represent increasingly diverse and transnationally mobile workers. Even in institutional contexts where the industrial relations structure and labour law are favourable, {{such as the}} Netherlands, unions struggle with maintaining labour standards for these workers. This article analyses Dutch union efforts to represent hyper-mobile construction workers at the Eemshaven construction sites. It shows that the nexus of <b>subcontracting,</b> <b>transnational</b> mobility, legal insularity and employer anti-unionism complicate enforcement so that even well-resourced unions can, at best, improve employment conditions for a limited set of workers and only for a limited period of time...|$|R
40|$|The article {{examines}} the challenges garment workers in the U. S. face in asserting their rights {{in the global economy}} and investigates how transnational advocacy can be deployed to compensate for the inability of U. S. labor laws to respond to problems with international dimensions. Using a purely domestic U. S. legal framework, advocates can attack the problem of <b>transnational</b> corporations <b>subcontracting</b> in the U. S. Such efforts, however, will have limited effect because of the global nature of the garment industry. Most efforts to change the structure of the garment industry have occurred within the limitations of U. S. law, even while there has been a predominant failure of the U. S. legal system effectively to utilize a human rights framework. Women workers have formed the backbone of the U. S. garment industry throughout its history. The geographic location and racial composition of this workforce has varied as retailers and manufacturers have shifted location of production to lower their labor costs. During the 1800 s and early 1900 s, the industry was centered primarily in New York City with a large influx of White immigrants providing a vast supply of inexpensive labor...|$|R
40|$|This article argues, through {{analysing}} {{industrial relations}} at the Olkiluoto 3 nuclear power plant construction site in Finland, that national unionism is inappropriately structured for the transnational construction industry. Olkiluoto 3 is being built by a French/German consortium employing mostly posted migrants via transnational subcontractors from around Europe. Despite the strong Finnish unions, contractors successfully contested the right of Finnish actors to regulate the site, placing labour relations in a deregulated space between national systems. Although the posted migrants eventually self-organized, Finnish unions remained unresponsive, reluctant to act outside the normal Finnish social partnership industrial relations paradigm. The case illustrates how the nationally based structure of the labour movement is ill-suited to represent a pan-European labour force. construction, European Union, migration, Nordic model, posted workers, <b>subcontracting,</b> <b>transnational</b> union cooperation...|$|R
40|$|In {{the past}} decade, market {{globalization}} {{has not only}} been a threat for {{small and medium-sized enterprises}} (SMEs), but also an opportunity to expand their activities in many countries (Murphy and al., 1991). In fact, some of SMEs are worldwide leaders in their sectors (Simon, 1990; Entreprise, 1995). Moreover, few of these worldwide SME leaders started businesses directly on an international level (Christensen, 1991; Brush, 1992; McDougall and al., 1994). This suggests that these SMEs use many processes to overcome resource and competency constraints, which would otherwise impede the success of a transnational business in the new global environment (Barlett and Ghoshal, 1987; Fombrun and Wally, 1992). Some studies have identified co-operation {{as one of the most}} powerful means an SME operating across borders can use to overcome its constraints (Olleros and Macdonald, 1988; McDougall and al., 1994; Scully and Fawcett, 1994). To face the complexity, diversity, dynamism and change characterizing the global market, SMEs need to form strong and sustainable ties with other organizations (Forrest, 1990; Harry, 1990). These ties can be made with big, medium-sized or other small enterprises (Shutt and Whittington, 1987; Lorenzoni and Ornati, 1988; Stevens, 1992; DarrÃ©on and FaiÃ§al, 1993; Fernandez and NoÃ«l, 1994). The balance of power between partners is very important in this kind of inter-firm relationship. SMEs have fewer resources than their partners, and yet their owner-managers prefer autonomy. Then, how do SMEs reconcile the apparent contradictory necessity to cooperate due to resource constraints with their desire for autonomy? What is the ideal quantity of activities that can be devoted to the partnership without threatening the organization itself? The purpose of this paper is to examine propensity of <b>transnational</b> SMEs to <b>subcontract,</b> to outsource (prime contract) or to collaborate on an equivalent basis with other businesses. It is important therefore, to first review the literature related to small business networking. Second, a summary of the methodology and results will follow. Third, propositions will be stated followed by conclusions...|$|R
