500|$|The {{highways}} in {{the system}} range in length from the unsigned Business Spur Interstate 375 (BSI-375) at [...] and signed M-212 at [...] to I-75 at [...] Some <b>trunklines</b> in Michigan are maintained by MDOT but bear no signage along the route to indicate so. These unsigned <b>trunklines</b> are mostly segments of former highway designations that have been moved or decommissioned. They remain under state control until their respective city or county accepts jurisdiction of the roadway from the state.|$|R
5|$|M-20 {{is a state}} <b>trunkline</b> {{highway in}} the US state of Michigan that runs from New Era to Midland. It crosses through rural Lower Peninsula forest land between the two ends. The highway serves the college towns of Big Rapids and Mt. Pleasant, home of the main campuses of Ferris State University and Central Michigan University, both located near the <b>trunkline.</b>|$|E
5|$|M-203 is a north–south state <b>trunkline</b> {{highway in}} the Upper Peninsula of the US state of Michigan. It connects McLain State Park with US41 on each end in Hancock and Calumet. The <b>trunkline</b> has existed since {{commissioning}} in 1933 except {{a period of}} time when it was temporarily decommissioned.|$|E
5|$|OLD M-155 {{begins in}} front of the former state {{hospital}} on High Hillcrest Drive and runs north and northwesterly through a field and out of the property. The road passes some houses in the area as it curves onto Country Farm Road next to Sanatorium Lake, turning northward. From there, the <b>trunkline</b> follows Country Farm Road to Norton Road through Marion Township. The <b>trunkline</b> follows Norton Road east over the South Branch of the Shiawassee River and then northeasterly past a residential subdivision. OLD M-155 then turns due east on Mason Road, running along the Marion–Howell township line before crossing into the city of Howell next to I-96. There is no interchange for the unsigned <b>trunkline</b> as it crosses over the freeway. The <b>trunkline</b> runs through more residential subdivisions before it turns northward onto Michigan Avenue. After , the <b>trunkline</b> terminates at the intersection with BL I-96 (Grand River Avenue) in downtown Howell.|$|E
25|$|The {{primary means}} of {{transportation}} in Northern Michigan is by automobile. Northern Michigan is served by one Interstate, {{and a number of}} U.S. Highways and Michigan state <b>trunklines.</b>|$|R
50|$|It is {{an entry}} point to Russia {{for natural gas}} <b>trunklines</b> from Central Asia (Central Asia-Center gas {{pipeline}} system) as also for the Russian natural gas export lines Soyuz and Orenburg-Novopskov.|$|R
2500|$|Michigan is {{also home}} to the first snowplow. This winter {{maintenance}} started during World War I to keep [...] of strategic highways clear. In 1919 Michigan first signed the <b>trunklines,</b> the second state after Wisconsin to do so.|$|R
5|$|As {{part of the}} {{creation}} of the Capitol Loop, M-143 and Michigan Avenue in Lansing was partially transferred back to local control. The section between Cedar and Larch streets was retained as part of the new Capitol Loop and the remainder inside the city of Lansing was removed from the state <b>trunkline</b> highway system on October 13, 1989. At the time, M-143 in the City of East Lansing was not transferred, and MDOT removed the signage, creating an unsigned <b>trunkline.</b>|$|E
5|$|M-103 {{is a state}} <b>trunkline</b> highway entirely within St. Joseph County in {{the southwestern}} region of the U.S. state of Michigan. The <b>trunkline</b> runs between U.S. Highway 12 (US12) in Mottville and the Indiana state line along {{undivided}} highway near the St. Joseph River. With the connection to State Road 15 (SR15), it provides access to the Indiana Toll Road. The current highway is the second to carry the number; {{the first version of}} M-103 has been incorporated into the routing of US131.|$|E
5|$|M-11 {{is a state}} <b>trunkline</b> {{highway in}} the US state of Michigan in the Grand Rapids {{metropolitan}} area. The highway runs through the western and southern sides of the metro area, starting over the border in Ottawa County at an interchange with Interstate 96 (I-96). It runs through both rural woodlands and busy commercial areas before it terminates at another interchange with I-96 in Cascade Township. Locally known as Wilson Avenue and 28th Street, the <b>trunkline</b> is listed on the National Highway System, M-11 carries between 8,000 and 42,000vehicles on average each day.|$|E
5|$|Although M-n {{outside of}} Michigan could conceivably refer to other state, provincial, local, or {{national}} highways, local usage {{in those areas}} does not mimic the Michigan usage in most cases. In countries like the United Kingdom, M refers to motorways, analogous to freeways in the United States, whereas M-numbered designations in Michigan simply indicate state <b>trunklines</b> in general and may exist on any type of highway. M-numbered <b>trunklines</b> are designated along a variety of roads, including eight-lane freeways in urban areas, four-lane rural freeways and expressways, principal arterial highways, and two-lane highways in remote rural areas. The system also includes M-185 on Mackinac Island, a non-motorized road restricted to bicycles, horse-drawn carriages and pedestrians.|$|R
5|$|Since then, MDOT {{has used}} the <b>trunkline's</b> {{designation}} on maps and in brochures related to a 2013 reconstruction project on Michigan Avenue in East Lansing. Signage has also been erected, and the highway has been restored to the official state map in 2013.|$|R
5|$|Highways in {{the state}} {{maintained}} by MDOT range from two-lane rural highways up to 12-lane freeways. In addition to the Interstates, other <b>trunklines</b> are built to freeway standards. Sections of US10, US23, US31, US127 and US131 have been upgraded to freeway standards. All or part of several state <b>trunklines</b> are also freeways. In the Metro Detroit area, M-5, M-8 (Davison Freeway), M-10 (Lodge Freeway), M-14, M-39 (Southfield Freeway), M-53 (Van Dyke Freeway), and M-59 have such sections. In {{the rest of the}} state, M-6 near Grand Rapids, Conn. M-13 near Bay City, M-47 near Midland, M-60 near Jackson, and Bus. US131 near Kalamazoo are also freeways, for all or part of their respective lengths.

The <b>trunkline</b> was progressively scaled back to Flat Rock before being decommissioned in 1957.|$|E
5000|$|... #Caption: Diagram of {{a modern}} hybrid fiber-coaxial cable {{television}} system. At the regional headend, the TV channels are sent multiplexed on a light beam which travels through optical fiber <b>trunklines,</b> which fan out from distribution hubs to optical nodes in local communities. Here the light signal from the fiber is translated to a radio frequency electrical signal, which is distributed through coaxial cable to individual subscriber homes.|$|R
5|$|After heading east {{past the}} {{junction}} with I-69, the highway turns southeast as it heads through rural fields toward Eaton Rapids. Once {{it reaches the}} city, M-50 converges with M-99, and the two intersect M-188 {{on the south side}} of the Grand River. The two highways run south out of the city. Immediately prior to entering Jackson County, the two <b>trunklines</b> diverge with M-99 heading off to the southwest and M-50 to the southeast.|$|R
50|$|This type {{is used in}} {{channels}} that transmit data {{in the form of}} an analog signal in which the voltage or current is proportional to the amplitude of the signal, as in an audio signal. They are also used in <b>trunklines</b> that transmit multiple signals using frequency division multiplexing (FDM). Analog repeaters are composed of a linear amplifier, and may include electronic filters to compensate for frequency and phase distortion in the line.|$|R
