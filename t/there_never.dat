5|$|Whether {{the pyramid}} was {{finished}} or left unfinished is disputed among experts. The egyptologist Rainer Stadelmann {{believes that the}} pyramid was indeed finished, but others, such as Miroslav Verner, think that the building was left unfinished because of the pharaoh's premature death. In particular, no traces of outer cladding were found, which could hint that <b>there</b> <b>never</b> was one because the pyramid was not completed.|$|E
5|$|Rogers' {{expedition}} suffered further setbacks. An unidentified disease killed {{almost a}} hundred of his expedition members, while leaving the long-term residents nearly untouched. Two of the three navy vessels, having no orders to remain, left for New York. Ships sent to Havana to conciliate the Spanish governor <b>there</b> <b>never</b> arrived, their crew revolting and becoming pirates mid-voyage. Finally, the third naval vessel left in mid-September, its commander promising to return in three weeks—a promise {{he had no intention}} of keeping. Work on rebuilding the island's fortifications proceeded slowly, with the locals showing a disinclination to work.|$|E
5|$|The exact terms {{by which}} Libya gained Aouzou remain partly obscure, and are debated. The {{existence}} of a secret agreement between Tombalbaye and Gaddafi was revealed only in 1988, when the Libyan President exhibited an alleged copy of a letter in which Tombalbaye recognizes Libyan claims. Against this, scholars like Bernard Lanne have argued that <b>there</b> <b>never</b> was any sort of formal agreement, and that Tombalbaye had found it expedient {{not to mention the}} occupation of a part of his country. Libya was unable to exhibit the original copy of the agreement when the case of the Aouzou Strip was brought before the International Court of Justice (ICJ) in 1993.|$|E

5|$|While {{on their}} way to buy jawbreakers at the candy store, the Eds are stopped by Sarah who claims to have found her doll under her bed. Double D then confesses that he {{recently}} found his magnifying glass as well, proving that <b>there</b> <b>never</b> actually was a serial toucher. Despite this revelation, the Eds still decide to spend the money, without freeing Jonny. However, while they are enjoying their jawbreakers, Sarah rolls the tire in which Jonny is trapped in down a hill, knocking the three over. The jawbreakers fly out of their mouths and roll down the street, leaving the Eds to chase after them into the sunset.|$|E
25|$|<b>There</b> <b>never</b> {{again was}} such a {{large-scale}} slave rebellion. Napoleon reversed the French abolition of slavery in law, constitution, and practice, which had occurred between 1793 and 1801, and reinstated slavery in the French colonies in 1801–1803—which lasted until 1848.|$|E

25|$|The {{death penalty}} for {{adultery}} was strangulation, except {{in the case of}} a woman who was the daughter of a Kohain (Aaronic priestly caste), which was specifically mentioned by Scripture by the death penalty of burning (pouring molten lead down the throat). Ipso facto, <b>there</b> <b>never</b> was mentioned in Pharisaic or Rabbinic Judaism sources a punishment of stoning for adulterers as mentioned in John 8.|$|E
25|$|The Church of England {{was legally}} {{established}} in the colony in 1619, and the Bishop of London sent in 22 Anglican clergyman by 1624. In practice, establishment meant that local taxes were funneled through the local parish to handle the needs of local government, such as roads and poor relief, {{in addition to the}} salary of the minister. <b>There</b> <b>never</b> was a bishop in colonial Virginia, and in practice the local vestry, consisting of gentry laymen controlled the parish. By the 1740s, the Anglicans had about 70 parish priests around the colony.|$|E
25|$|Generally, {{the nobility}} grew from wealthier or more {{powerful}} {{members of the}} peasantry, those who were capable of assigning work or wealth to provide the requisite cavalrymen. In Finland, <b>there</b> <b>never</b> existed outright serfdom. Hence, nobility was basically a class of well-off citizens, not owners of other human beings. In the Middle Ages {{and much of the}} modern age, nobles and other wealthy men were landowners, as well as lords of villeins and servants. Members of the nobility utilized their economic power and sometimes also other powers to have smaller farmowners sell their lands to manor lords, so landowning centralized gradually more {{in the hands of the}} noble class.|$|E

25|$|The first {{scholarly}} book on Saunière's activities was {{by local}} historian and chief librarian of Carcassonne René Descadeillas, who sifted through the priest's account books and personal correspondence, {{as well as}} the records of Saunière's ecclesiastical trial lodged in the Carcassonne Bishopric - and concluded in his 1974 Mythologie du trésor de Rennes: histoire véritable de l'abbé Saunière, curé de Rennes-le-Château that <b>there</b> <b>never</b> was any treasure or mystery; all of the priest's wealth was generated from selling Masses and accepting donations. This conclusion was shared by the local priest and author Abbé Bruno de Monts, who himself contributed essential information during the 1980s and 1990s, as well as by other French authors like Jean-Jacques Bedu and more recently David Rossoni.|$|E
25|$|The Neo-Platonic {{interpretation}} of Plato prevailed until the beginning {{the nineteenth century}} when in 1804 Friedrich Schleiermacher published an introduction to his 1804 translation of Plato's dialogues and initiated a radical turn whose consequences are still felt today. Schleiermacher {{was convinced that the}} entire content of Plato's philosophy was contained in his dialogues. <b>There</b> <b>never</b> was, he insisted, any oral teaching that went beyond them. According to his conception, the genre of the dialogue is no literary replacement for Plato's philosophy, rather the literary form of the dialogue and the content of Plato's philosophy are inseparably bound together: Plato's way of philosophizing can by its nature only be represented as a literary dialogue. Therefore, unwritten doctrines with any philosophically relevant, special content that are not bound together into a literary dialogue must be excluded.|$|E
25|$|Chessick also {{acknowledged}} {{the dangers of}} relativism implicit in ontological hermeneutics. He acknowledges that the art and theory of interpretation is not bound by today's methods of science that aim to prevent nihilism and relativism. However, Bernstein {{has pointed out that}} <b>there</b> <b>never</b> could be any hard and fast rules or methods for interpretation because it does not aim to be a science. Gadamer states that the methods of the natural sciences are too impoverished to reveal many truths about human nature and likewise advocated for a hermeneutic approach. Others have made similar arguments for ontological hermeneutics. Chessick writes that the limitations preventing the natural sciences from uncovering certain truths about human nature is precisely why Dilthey initially advocated for a distinction between the natural and human sciences, paving the way for hermeneutics to become a method of inquiry.|$|E

25|$|Eidsberg Station {{grew up as}} a {{community}} hub and featured at various times a store, post office, telegraph, café, bakery and fuel station. However, <b>there</b> <b>never</b> grew up a village around station like many other of the stations in the area. The post office opened in 1885, {{and a year later}} a warehouse for Felleskjøpet was erected next to the station. A road was built from the station to Huseby in 1910. Eidsberg and Mysen were split into two municipalities in 1920. Unlike around Mysen Station, Eidsberg Station had never developed into a town. Some people called for the new municipal hall to be built next to the station so a new village could be built around them. This was not done and instead it was placed at Søndre Mysen. Despite efforts, only nine lots were sold around Eidsberg Station the following one and a half decade.|$|E
25|$|Thomas Sikes was Captain of Hook and Ladder Co. No. 1, and Eustance Gibson was Captain of Excelsior Fire Engine and Hose Co. No. 2. Both were Civil War veterans, {{well known}} and {{respected}} early settlers. Many of the volunteer personnel composed of well known early settlers, merchants and professional men, many of whose descendants are living in Huntington today. In 1876 a night-watchman was hired at $3 per month {{to look after the}} station at night and sound the alarm in case of a fire. This was the first paid employee of the fire department. In 1879 J.W. Verlander became the first Fire Chief, and J.M. Boone became chief in 1880 until 1895. In 1881, four Gamewell Fire Alarm Boxes were installed in the downtown area. These fire alarm boxes were maintained by the telephone company. The system kept growing, and in 1928 construction was completed on a new Gamewell Fire Alarm System and Fire Alarm Headquarters were placed in operation in 1929, and remained in service until 7:32AM November 1, 1986. The Gamewell Fire Alarm System served the City of Huntington faithfully for 105 years. <b>There</b> <b>never</b> was a loss of life or major disaster because of a system malfunction.|$|E
25|$|In 1763 Steuben {{had been}} {{formally}} {{introduced to the}} future French Minister of War, Claude Louis, Comte de Saint-Germain in Hamburg. They met again in Paris in 1777. The Count, fully realizing the potential of an officer with Prussian general staff training, introduced him to Benjamin Franklin. Franklin, however, was unable to offer Steuben a rank or pay in the American army. The Continental Congress had grown tired of foreign mercenaries coming to America and demanding a high rank and pay. Promoting these men over qualified American officers caused discontent in the ranks. Von Steuben {{would have to go}} to America strictly as a volunteer, and present himself to Congress. Steuben left these first meetings in disgust and returned to Prussia. Steuben found waiting for him allegations that he engaged in homosexual relationships with young men while in the service of Prince Josef Friedrich Wilhelm of Hohenzollern-Hechingen. The allegations were never proven, but Steuben knew they would stymie his chances at an officer's position in Europe. Threatened with prosecution for his alleged homosexuality, Steuben returned to Paris. Rumors followed him from Prussia to America that he was homosexual, but <b>there</b> <b>never</b> was an investigation of von Steuben and he received a Congressional pension after the war.|$|E
