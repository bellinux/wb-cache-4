The Duisburg Jewish community center {{is located on}} a park, the Garten der Erinnerung designed by Dani Karavan. The community center shares a similar concept <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>Page</b> Memorial in its likening to the open pages of a book, and symbolically the Torah of Moses. The Palmach Museum has an angular zig-zag plan positioned around the preservation of trees on the site. It is clad in a local sandstone that was found in excavations for the project. It was exhibited at the Venice Biennale.|$|E

The couple was presented as supposed family members of the administrator; however, he later indicated that they were not his family, and that the criminal organization had either confused them or simply targeted a random family to pressure to administrator to close the page. Valor por Tamaulipas responded by sending a message to the authorities in Tamaulipas and blamed them for the death of a person who died of a cardiac arrest after the couple was kidnapped; the administrator also accused the Tamaulipas authorities of protecting Los Zetas drug cartel.|$|E

25|$|At {{the core}} of the XPS print path is XPSDrv, the XPS-based printer driver which {{includes}} the filter pipeline. It contains a set of filters which are print processing modules and an XML-based configuration file to describe how the filters are loaded. Filters receive the spool file data as input, perform document processing, rendering and PDL post-processing, and then output PDL data for the printer to consume. Filters can perform a single function such as watermarking a page or doing color transformations or they can perform several print processing functions on specific document parts individually or collectively and then convert the spool file <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>page</b> description language supported by the printer.|$|E

Users can also import and export data as ics or csv files, or as an RSS feed. The website includes a plain-language event adding feature, which allows users to type phrases such as “Drinks with Richard, tomorrow, 7-9pm, Flute and Whistle”. The website then translates the phrase into an event, determining the location, time, date, and description. Users can add buddies and share calendars with them. 30 Boxes features a simple webtop, which summarizes daily appointments and to-do items. Users can also add applets <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>page,</b> such as Google search, Yahoo!

25|$|The {{client-side}} (Web browser) technologies used in Web 2.0 development include Ajax and JavaScript frameworks. Ajax programming uses JavaScript and the Document Object Model {{to update}} selected {{regions of the}} page area without undergoing a full page reload. To allow users to continue {{to interact with the}} page, communications such as data requests going to the server are separated from data coming back <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>page</b> (asynchronously). Otherwise, the user would have to routinely wait for the data to come back before they can do anything else on that page, just as a user has to wait for a page to complete the reload. This also increases overall performance of the site, as the sending of requests can complete quicker independent of blocking and queueing required to send data back to the client. The data fetched by an Ajax request is typically formatted in XML or JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) format, two widely used structured data formats. Since both of these formats are natively understood by JavaScript, a programmer can easily use them to transmit structured data in their Web application. When this data is received via Ajax, the JavaScript program then uses the Document Object Model (DOM) to dynamically update the Web page based on the new data, allowing for a rapid and interactive user experience. In short, using these techniques, Web designers can make their pages function like desktop applications. For example, Google Docs uses this technique to create a Web-based word processor.|$|E
500|$|Through several fliers {{issued in}} Ciudad Victoria, Tamaulipas, a drug {{trafficking}} organization offered a $600,000 peso (roughly US$46,000) reward to anyone {{that could give}} them information on the whereabouts of the administrator of Valor por Tamaulipas, or to identify any of his family members, whether they are his parents, brothers and sisters, children or wife. The flier included the phone number (834)-104-7370, which has the area code of Tamaulipas. The administrator responded by saying that [...] " [...] not playing at being a hero, [...] doing what [...] {{to do as a}} citizen." [...] He also thanked the visitors who contributed <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>page</b> and gave him support throughout the project, and asked the Mexican Armed Forces to continue their fight against organized crime. The administrator said, too, that he would continue to his crime reporting at Valor por Tamaulipas even if that might cost him his life. On its page the administrator stated that after hearing about the threat, his wife and children left to the United States for security reasons. He also asked his visitors to refrain from using their personal Facebook or Twitter accounts when uploading information <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>page</b> since that could put them at risk. He believes that the Mexican criminal organization known as Los Zetas or state officials working for them are probably responsible for this threat.|$|E
500|$|The Relative Index (or, as Dewey spelled it, [...] "Relativ Index") is an {{alphabetical}} index to the classification, for use both by classifiers {{but also by}} library users when seeking books by topic.
