40|$|Heart {{development}} is a crucial and conserved process that <b>is</b> related <b>to</b> the major type of human birth defects. Dorsal vessel, the Drosophila heart, has been regarded as an insightful system to identify new genes and study gene functions involved in heart development. Using heart-specific GFP transgenes, I did a genetic screen for cardiogenic genes on Drosophila chromosome II. Drosophila mutants that carry chromosome II deficiencies were tested for their phenotypes of heart development. Based on the screen results, chromosome regions containing genes required for heart development were identified. Fly strains with single gene mutations located within the defined deficiency regions were tested further. Seven genes have <b>been</b> identified <b>to</b> <b>be</b> involved in heart development. ^ The LIM homeodomain transcription factor gene tailup (<b>tup)</b> <b>was</b> further studied for its function in heart development. Based on this study, <b>tup</b> <b>is</b> expressed in cardioblasts and pericardial cells of the heart tube, {{as well as in}} associated lymph glands and alary muscles.

Differential expression of various genes involved in capsule formation and iron/copper homeostasis was observed between the wild-type and tup 1 H 99 strains. Furthermore, the H 99 tup 1 strain displayed pleiotropic effects which included sensitivity to sodium dodecyl sulfate, susceptibility to fluconazole, and attenuated virulence.

40|$|Streptavidin is {{sometimes}} {{used as the}} intended target to screen phage-displayed combinatorial peptide libraries for streptavidin-binding peptides (SBPs). More often in the biopanning system, however, streptavidin is just a commonly used anchoring molecule that can efficiently capture the biotinylated target. In this case, SBPs creeping into the biopanning results are not desired binders but target-unrelated peptides (TUP). Taking them as intended binders may mislead subsequent studies. Therefore, it <b>is</b> important <b>to</b> find if a peptide <b>is</b> likely <b>to</b> <b>be</b> an SBP when streptavidin is either the intended target or just the anchoring molecule.

In this report, we addressed these questions by investigating the GAL 1 promoter.

In fact, we show that it <b>is</b> <b>Tup</b> 1 that specifies Htz 1 deposition for the promoter nucleosome covering the transcription start site. This deposition occurs rapidly following transcriptional repression, and it correlates with a Tup 1 -independent transient recruitment of the SWR 1 complex.

To assess the role of the transcription regulator Tup 1 p in this phenotypic transition, both <b>TUP</b> 1 alleles <b>were</b> deleted in the mutant Δtup 1. Δtup 1 formed “fuzzy large” colonies made up of cells growing exclusively in the filamentous form. Δtup 1 cells did not undergo the white-opaque transition, but it did switch spontaneously, at high frequency (∼ 10 − 3), and unidirectionally through the following sequence of colony (and cellular) phenotypes: “fuzzy large” (primarily hyphae) → “fuzzy small” (primarily pseudohyphae) → “smooth” (primarily budding yeast) → “revertant fuzzy” (primarily pseudohyphae). Northern analysis of white-phase, opaque-phase, and hypha-associated genes demonstrated that Tup 1 p also plays a role in the regulation of select phase-specific genes and that each variant in the Δtup 1 switching lineage differs in the level of expression of one or more phase-specific and/or hypha-associated genes.

It is encoded by three genes, RNR 1, RNR 2 and RNR 3, {{each of which is}} inducible by agents that damage DNA or block DNA replication. To probe the signaling pathway mediating this DNA damage response, we have designed a general selection system for isolating spontaneous trans-acting mutations that alter RNR 3 expression using a chromosomal RNR 3 -URA 3 transcriptional fusion and an RNR 3 -lacZ reporter plasmid. Using this system, we have isolated 202 independent trans-acting crt (constitutive RNR 3 transcription) mutants that express high levels of RNR 3 in the absence of DNA damaging agents. Of these, 200 are recessive and fall into 9 complementation groups. In some crt groups, the expression of RNR 1 and RNR 2 are also elevated, suggesting that all three RNR genes share a common regulatory pathway. Mutations in most CRT genes confer additional phenotypes, among these are clumpiness, hydroxyurea sensitivity, temperature sensitivity and slow growth. Five of the CRT genes have been identified as previously cloned genes; CRT 4 <b>is</b> <b>TUP</b> 1, CRT 5 is POL 1 /CDC 17, CRT 6 is RNR 2, CRT 7 is RNR 1, and CRT 8 is SSN 6. crt 6 - 68 and crt 7 - 240 are the first ts alleles of RNR 2 and RNR 1, respectively, and arrest with a large budded, cdc terminal phenotype at the nonpermissive temperature.
