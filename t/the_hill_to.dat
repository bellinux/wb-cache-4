5|$|As one of {{the largest}} open spaces close to Manchester, the moor has a history of use for army {{manoeuvres}} and large public gatherings. In his book The Condition of the Working Class in England in 1844, Friedrich Engels referred to it as the Mons Sacer of Manchester. This was a reference to <b>the</b> <b>hill</b> <b>to</b> which the plebs (common citizens) of Rome withdrew en masse in 494 BC as an act of civil protest.|$|E
5|$|In 1876 Ferdinand de Rothschild {{began work}} on Waddesdon Manor, a short {{distance}} south of the Tramway's station at Waddesdon (later renamed Waddesdon Road). The top of Lodge Hill, a landmark, was levelled to provide a site and sloping drives were cut into <b>the</b> <b>hill</b> <b>to</b> provide access to the construction site. Transport of materials was by horse, but the contractors had to get enormous stone blocks up the hill. Rothschild's contractors built a line, known as the Winchendon Branch, which turned off the Tramway between Waddesdon and Westcott stations and ran south {{to the foot of}} Lodge Hill. From there a cable tram ran on narrow gauge rails up <b>the</b> <b>hill</b> <b>to</b> a gully close to the building site. Materials were hauled along the cable tramway in tubs by a steam-powered winch. The Winchendon Branch was hastily and cheaply built; after one of the Tramway's locomotives derailed there on 5 July 1876 Jones refused to allow his engines on it, and from then on materials were hauled along the branch by horses.|$|E

5|$|On {{reaching}} Jejuri, Khandoba {{was greeted}} by Mhalsa's fury and her strong protest of his second marriage. To avoid the quarrels of his wives, Khandoba gave {{the upper half of}} <b>the</b> <b>hill</b> <b>to</b> Mhalsa and the lower half to Banai. The idol of Mhalsa is placed with Khandoba in the main shrine at top of the hill at Jejuri. A separate shrine to Banai is situated halfway down the hill.|$|E
5|$|Advancing up {{the ridge}} {{they had just}} abandoned, Browne's {{battalion}} came under intense fire from Ruffin's emplaced infantry and artillery. Within a few salvoes, half the battalion was gone and, unable to continue, Browne's men scattered amongst the cover provided by the slope and returned fire. Despite his success, Ruffin could not descend <b>the</b> <b>hill</b> <b>to</b> brush away the remnants of Browne's battalion, as Dilkes's brigade had by now emerged from the wood and was forming up {{at the base of}} the slope.|$|E
5|$|Although {{supplies}} {{had been}} left in Aladdin's Cave—including fresh fruit—there were not the spare crampons he had expected. Without them he could not hope to descend the steep ice slope to the hut, and so he began to fashion his own, collecting nails from every available source and hammering them into wood from spare packing cases. Even when completed, a blizzard confined him to the cave, and only on 8 February was he able to begin the descent. Nearing the hut, he was spotted by three men working outside, who rushed up <b>the</b> <b>hill</b> <b>to</b> meet him.|$|E

5|$|American air, artillery, mortar, and {{tank fire}} now {{concentrated}} on Battle Mountain, and I and L Companies prepared another counterattack to retake it. This attack launched soon after, but made slow progress and at midnight it halted {{to wait for}} daylight. Shortly after dawn on August 22, I and L Companies resumed the attack. L Company moved up the mountain, with I Company supplying a base of fire. Three North Korean grenades wounded six of the troops, causing the rest to retreat without orders from their frustrated commander. They were eventually returned to the hill with some coercion. A few hours later, when a small North Korean force worked around its right flank, the company again withdrew back down <b>the</b> <b>hill</b> <b>to</b> I Company's position without orders.|$|E
5|$|Badami, also {{referred}} to as Vatapi, Vatapipura, Vatapinagari and Agastya Tirtha in historical texts, the capital of Chalukya dynasty in the 6th century, is at the exit point of a ravine between two steep mountain cliffs. Four cave temples in the escarpment of <b>the</b> <b>hill</b> <b>to</b> the south-east of the town were carved into the cliff's monolithic stone face. The escarpment is above a man made lake called Agastya Lake, created by an earthen dam faced with stone steps. To the west end of this cliff, at its lowest point, is the first cave temple. The largest and highest cave is Cave 3, which is further to the east on the northern face of the hill. The fourth cave, Cave 4, is a few steps down further east.|$|E
5|$|Believing the German {{attacks on}} 29 June {{indicated}} more counter-attacks {{for the following}} day, Dempsey reinforced the Odon bridgehead with a brigade of the 43rd division and pulled in its perimeter. The 159th Infantry Brigade of the 11th Armoured Division was placed {{under the command of}} the 15th (Scottish) Infantry Division and acceding to O’Connor’s wishes for additional infantry, Dempsey attached the newly arrived 53rd (Welsh) Infantry Division to VIII Corps; the lead brigade arrived near the Epsom start line during the night. To hold Hill 112, it was necessary hold Évrecy and Hill 113 for which there were insufficient troops and Dempsey ordered the 29th Armoured Brigade to abandon <b>the</b> <b>hill.</b> <b>To</b> hold the area between Rauray and the Odon, Dempsey withdrew the 29th Armoured Brigade north across the river after dark, ready for the expected German offensive.|$|E

5|$|Burnside's {{road system}} was {{completely}} bitumenised during the 1960s and 1970s through government-sponsored roadworks programmes. Plans were also laid out {{to replace the}} winding and dangerous Mount Barker Road. One of these proposals was the Burnside-Crafers Highway, which was strongly supported by council; it envisaged leaving Greenhill Road once reaching Hazelwood Park. It was then to pass through Hazelwood Park and Beaumont, wind around the hills of Waterfall Gully and then go over Eagle on <b>the</b> <b>Hill</b> <b>to</b> meet Crafers. The Burnside Council put much effort into this proposal, widening Linden Avenue (which runs north-west to south-east) {{in preparation for the}} highway. The proposal was eventually rejected in favour of upgrading Mount Barker Road and Linden Avenue remained a huge out-of-place road running through an otherwise peaceful suburb.|$|E
5|$|Mount Osmond {{is a small}} {{suburb of}} 2,497 people in the South Australian capital city of Adelaide. It {{is part of the}} City of Burnside local {{government}} area and located {{in the foothills of the}} Adelaide Hills, five kilometres south east of the city centre. The suburb is high on the hill of the same name, which is the last hill on the right when approaching Adelaide down the South Eastern Freeway before the road levels out onto the Adelaide Plains. It is bounded to the north by the suburb of Beaumont, to the north-east by Burnside, to the east by Waterfall Gully, to the south by Leawood Gardens/Eagle On <b>The</b> <b>Hill,</b> <b>to</b> the south-west by Urrbrae, to the west by Glen Osmond and to the north-west by St Georges.|$|E
5|$|Next to {{the older}} and much steeper stairs leading to the Aracoeli, Michelangelo devised a monumental wide-ramped stair (the cordonata), {{gradually}} ascending <b>the</b> <b>hill</b> <b>to</b> reach the high piazza, so that the Campidoglio resolutely turned its back on the Roman Forum that it had once commanded. It was built to be wide enough for horse riders to ascend the hill without dismounting. The railings are topped by the statues of two Egyptian lions in black basalt at their base and the marble renditions of Castor and Pollux at their top.|$|E

5|$|PA378 heads northward across <b>the</b> <b>Hill</b> <b>to</b> Hill Bridge, {{at which}} point it crosses back into Lehigh County. The route crosses over West Lehigh Street and intersects with the off-ramp to Main Street in Bethlehem. There was {{formerly}} a ramp to 2nd Avenue, but that has been closed and is only used by pedestrians. After this interchange, PA378 becomes a four-lane freeway and is named the Fred B. Rooney Highway. The highway continues northward through the city, crossing under West Broad Street and reaching a southbound interchange with North Street, which leads to Center City and Third Avenue. The freeway continues northward, crossing over and receiving an on-ramp from Union Boulevard.|$|E
5|$|Skanderbeg {{expected}} a reaction so {{he moved with}} 15,000 of his own men to defeat Ali Pasha's army. The two met in the Plain of Torvioll where they camped opposite of each other. The following day, 29 June, Ali {{came out of his}} camp and saw that Skanderbeg had positioned his forces {{at the bottom of a}} hill. Expecting a quick victory, Ali ordered all of his forces down <b>the</b> <b>hill</b> <b>to</b> attack and defeat Skanderbeg's army. Skanderbeg expected such a maneuver and had prepared his own stratagem. Once the opposing forces were engaged and the necessary positioning was achieved, Skanderbeg ordered his forces hidden in the forests behind the Turkish army to strike their rear. The result was devastating for the Ottomans, whose entire army was routed and its commander nearly killed.|$|E
5|$|The U.S. {{air strike}} and {{artillery}} bombardment pushed North Korean forces off the hill. After the strike, at 15:30, the infantry attacked {{up the hill}} unopposed and secured it by 16:30. The combined strength of E and F Companies on the hill was about 60 men. The artillery and the air strike killed and wounded an estimated 500 enemy troops on Hill 303, with survivors fleeing in complete disorder. Two of the massacre survivors making their way down <b>the</b> <b>hill</b> <b>to</b> meet the counterattacking force were fired upon before they could establish their identity, but not hit. American forces of the 5th Cavalry Regiment quickly discovered {{the bodies of the}} American prisoners with machine-gun wounds, hands still bound behind their backs.|$|E

5|$|The {{arrival of}} the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad and Romney Depot to Depot Valley brought {{residential}} development on the hilltops {{to the west and}} east of Valley. On September27, 1911, George Edward Harmison (1863–1916) conducted a public auction of Valley View farm's fields atop Yellow Banks overlooking the South Branch Potomac River. The land was located atop <b>the</b> <b>hill</b> <b>to</b> the west of Valley. Harmison subdivided the fields into lots, and the planned development was known as the Valley View Addition to Romney. Harmison sold 21 of the land lots at the auction, and several lots were sold privately. A free lot was given to J.H. Newhouse, and Harmison set aside two lots on a bluff for the site of a future hospital, which he planned to deed to any entity willing to build one.|$|E
5|$|The second {{aspect of}} the {{compensation}} system involves the start gate position. If the gate is changed at any point during a round after at least one athlete has jumped, then all subsequent athletes are individually penalised with a points deduction based on how many positions the gate was moved up, or awarded additional points for the gate being lowered. In variable wind conditions requiring either a higher or lower inrun speed than originally anticipated, {{it is not uncommon}} for many gate changes to be made as a round wears on. In the era prior to gate compensation, athletes who had jumped before a gate adjustment had to quickly make their way back up <b>the</b> <b>hill</b> <b>to</b> jump again, which was always logistically difficult to arrange due to time constraints.|$|E
5|$|The {{situation}} on the front was chaotic during the day September 1. The North Koreans at one place had crossed at the Kihang ferry, captured Agok, and scattered A Company, 9th Infantry at its positions from Agok northward. A Company withdrew to positions on the ridge line back of the river. From there at daylight the men could see North Korean soldiers {{on many of the}} ridges surrounding them, most of them moving east. After several hours, 2nd Platoon of A Company sent a patrol down <b>the</b> <b>hill</b> <b>to</b> Agok to obtain supplies abandoned there during the night, returning later with much needed water, rations, and ammunition.|$|E
