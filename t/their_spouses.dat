5|$|Many {{different}} {{sources of information}} can motivate discussion about HIV/AIDS among married couples. After hearing information about HIV/AIDS at local health facilities or during conversations with friends or family members, {{people are more likely}} to address the risk of HIV contraction with <b>their</b> <b>spouses.</b> In addition, women are more likely than men to mention the dangers of HIV/AIDS when they suspect that <b>their</b> <b>spouses</b> are engaging in extramarital sexual relations. According to a 2003 study by Eliya Msiyaphazi Zulu and Gloria Chepngeno, although higher levels of education do correspond to greater knowledge about HIV/AIDS, education levels do not significantly impact the likelihood that couples will discuss HIV-related prevention strategies.|$|E

40|$|Most {{studies of}} {{widowhood}} {{have focused on}} reactions {{during the first few}} years postloss. The authors investigated whether widowhood had more enduring effects using a nationally representative U. S. sample. Participants were 768 individuals who had lost <b>their</b> <b>spouse</b> (from a few months to 64 years) prior to data collection. Results indicated that the widowed continued to talk, think, and feel emotions about <b>their</b> lost <b>spouse</b> decades later. Twenty years postloss, the widowed thought about <b>their</b> <b>spouse</b> once every week or 2 and had a conversation about <b>their</b> <b>spouse</b> once a month on average. About 12. 6 years postloss, the widowed reported feeling upset between sometimes and rarely when they thought about <b>their</b> <b>spouse.</b> These findings add {{to an understanding of the}} time course of grief...|$|R
25|$|It is {{less common}} for women, {{especially}} in the U.S. and Canada, to combine <b>their</b> <b>spouse's</b> name with <b>their</b> own birth name. About 7% of American women hyphenate their name with <b>their</b> <b>spouse's</b> name upon marriage.|$|R
5|$|In his 1931 {{treatise}} On the Nightmare, Welsh psychoanalyst Ernest Jones {{asserted that}} vampires are symbolic of several unconscious drives and defence mechanisms. Emotions such as love, guilt, and hate fuel {{the idea of}} the return of the dead to the grave. Desiring a reunion with loved ones, mourners may project the idea that the recently dead must in return yearn the same. From this arises the belief that folkloric vampires and revenants visit relatives, particularly <b>their</b> <b>spouses,</b> first.|$|E

She testified at a Meese Commission hearing on pornography, while Attorney General Edwin Meese was serving socially conservative President Reagan. She had a political discourse with National Review writer David Frum and <b>their</b> <b>spouses</b> arranged by Christopher Hitchens.|$|E
5|$|Although {{couples are}} {{starting}} to use condoms during extramarital intercourse more frequently, condom use during marital sex is still viewed as inappropriate by many Malawians; in 2000, only 2.3% of people reported using condoms regularly during sexual intercourse with <b>their</b> <b>spouses.</b> Some people believe that condoms are only necessary during sex with high-risk partners such as sex workers, and that condom use during marital sex implies infidelity. Others believe that marital condom use violates the religious purposes of marriage: sexual pleasure and reproduction. In {{a study published in}} 2007 by Agnes M. Chimbiri, men claimed that they use condoms with their wives for the sake of avoiding unwanted pregnancies; on the other hand, they were more concerned about sexually transmitted infections when discussing condom use with extramarital sexual partners.|$|E

5|$|From 1898 to 1909, {{architect}} Frank Lloyd Wright {{lived and}} worked out of his home and studio in Oak Park, Illinois. In Oak Park, Wright had developed his concept of Prairie School architecture, designing houses primarily for local clients. In 1903, Wright began designing a home for Edwin Cheney, but quickly took a liking for Cheney's wife. Wright and Mamah Borthwick Cheney began an affair and separated from <b>their</b> <b>spouses</b> in 1909. They met up in Florence, Italy, in February 1910, where Wright made sketches of his future studio. He was particularly inspired by Michelozzo's Villa Medici in Fiesole because it was built into a hill, had commanding views of its surroundings, and featured gardens on two levels.|$|E
5|$|In June 2010, McCreery {{suggested}} {{reforms to}} the Order of Canada that would avert the awkwardness around appointing those in Canada's royal family as full {{members of the}} order: He theorized that the Queen, as the order's Sovereign, could simply appoint, on ministerial advice, anyone as an extra member, or the monarch could issue an ordinance allowing for her relations to be made regular members when approved. Similarly, McCreery proposed that a new division of the order could be established specifically for governors general, <b>their</b> <b>spouses,</b> {{and members of the}} Royal Family, a version of which was adopted in 2013.|$|E
5|$|The Presidential Inaugural Committee {{and members}} of the 111th U.S.Congress {{distributed}} invitations and color-coded tickets to both dignitaries and ordinary citizens for the reserved sections on or near the U.S.Capitol grounds to view the swearing-in ceremony. Invitations and tickets were sent to ambassadors and chiefs of diplomatic missions to the United States and <b>their</b> <b>spouses,</b> but not to other representatives of foreign countries, and invitations were distributed to U.S.politicians and an array of dignitaries across the spectrum of business and industry.

5|$|In 1839, Melbourne {{resigned}} after Radicals and Tories (both of whom Victoria detested) {{voted against}} {{a bill to}} suspend the constitution of Jamaica. The bill removed political power from plantation owners who were resisting measures associated with the abolition of slavery. The Queen commissioned a Tory, Sir Robert Peel, {{to form a new}} ministry. At the time, it was customary for the prime minister to appoint members of the Royal Household, who were usually his political allies and <b>their</b> <b>spouses.</b> Many of the Queen's ladies of the bedchamber were wives of Whigs, and Peel expected to replace them with wives of Tories. In {{what became known as the}} bedchamber crisis, Victoria, advised by Melbourne, objected to their removal. Peel refused to govern under the restrictions imposed by the Queen, and consequently resigned his commission, allowing Melbourne to return to office.|$|E
5|$|Johnson's wife Shelly {{is having}} breakfast with her lover Bobby Briggs; the two roleplay {{the idea of}} {{shooting}} Johnson, while they toy with Shelly's pistol. When Deputy Andy Brennan (Harry Goaz) arrives to enquire about Johnson, Briggs hides and Shelly attempts to make Johnson seem deeply involved in Laura's death and Renault's disappearance. Elsewhere, lovers Ed Hurley (Everett McGill) and Norma Jennings (Peggy Lipton) meet to discuss <b>their</b> <b>spouses.</b> Jennings' husband Hank (Chris Mulkey) has been released from prison, while Hurley's volatile wife Nadine is increasingly becoming mentally unwell. Jennings leaves, feeling {{that things are going}} nowhere, leaving Hurley crestfallen. Meanwhile, Audrey Horne (Sherilyn Fenn) is interviewed for a job at her father's department store and blackmails the interviewer into giving her a position at the shop's perfume counter—where Laura and Ronette Pulaski worked before their abduction.|$|E
50|$|For example, {{if someone}} were to entice <b>their</b> <b>spouse</b> to commit {{adultery}}, they might be blocked (or estopped) from divorcing <b>their</b> <b>spouse</b> on grounds of that adultery.

5|$|Marriages {{were highly}} ritualized, {{particularly}} for the wealthy, and included many important steps. The giving of betrothal gifts, known as bridewealth and dowry, were especially important. A lack of either was considered dishonorable and the woman would have been seen not as a wife, but as a concubine. Arranged marriages were normal, with the father's input on his offspring's spouse being considered {{more important than the}} mother's. Monogamous marriages were also normal, although nobles and high officials were wealthy enough to afford and support concubines as additional lovers. Under certain conditions dictated by custom, not law, both men and women were able to divorce <b>their</b> <b>spouses</b> and remarry. However, a woman who had been widowed continued to belong to her husband's family after his death. In order to remarry, the widow would have to be returned to her family in exchange for a ransom fee. Her children {{would not be allowed to}} go with her.|$|E

Shiv desperately attempts to convince Malhotra to perform a spinal decompression on his wife, but he disregards Shiv's research and refuses to proceed with surgery. Tara discusses Rajat's surgery with Ishita and decides not {{to go ahead with}} it, which further angers Malhotra. Ishita leaves to aid her ailing son. Tara realises that she is no longer Ishita's top priority, now that Ishita is married. Shiv and Tara make up and later that night dance together at Shiv's house, much to the amusement of his neighbours. They get upset thinking about <b>their</b> <b>spouses</b> and discuss what they meant to them, before falling asleep in the living room.|$|E
5|$|Twice Through the Heart {{is based}} on a 1992 poetry {{documentary}} of the same name that Kay had written for the BBC television series Words on Film. Kay was concerned by inequalities in how the legal system treats men and women who kill <b>their</b> <b>spouses</b> and, in particular, in how the law on provocation in the United Kingdom was then interpreted, allowing a defence to murder only in the context of what happened immediately before a homicide and excluding the battered woman defence which considers the broader context which may have involved years of violent abuse. She chose to base the poems on a specific true case, that of Amelia Rossiter, a woman in her sixties who refused to give evidence in court about the years of violence from her husband that eventually led to her stabbing him twice through the heart with a kitchen knife. By the time Kay's programme was broadcast, Rossiter had been freed, her conviction reduced to manslaughter after her plea of provocation was accepted.|$|E

30|$|When {{the number}} of {{preschool}} children increases, both husbands and wives report that they are less satisfied with <b>their</b> <b>spouse,</b> presumably due to the burden of child-rearing. When the husband’s labor income increases, both husbands and wives report {{that they are more}} satisfied with <b>their</b> <b>spouse.</b> This result is consistent with Lee and Ono (2008), who find that Japanese wives report higher marital happiness if they have higher household incomes.|$|R
5|$|At the {{investiture}} ceremony the Admonitions {{are read}} in turn by the prelate and {{chancellor of the}} order and several insignia are offered on a cushion to the Sovereign by Garter King of Arms, Black Rod, {{and the secretary of}} the order, in turn, so that the Sovereign may perform the ceremony of investiture. Two senior knights of the order assist the Sovereign in these ceremonies by placing the garter around the left leg of the new knight and by assisting the Sovereign in the fastening of the riband and Lesser George about the body of the new knight, and in the adjustment of the mantle and the collar. After the investiture ceremony at Windsor is concluded, a state luncheon is held in the Banqueting Room. This is attended by the royal family, by all the Companions of the Order and <b>their</b> <b>spouses,</b> and by the Officers of the Order. After the banquet all the knights and ladies of the order, together with the prelate, chancellor and other officers of the order, in their mantles and ceremonial robes, led by the Military Knights of Windsor, move in procession, watched by a great crowd of spectators, through the castle, down the hill, which is lined with troops, to Saint George's Chapel for a worship service, before which the formal installation of the new knights takes place.|$|E
