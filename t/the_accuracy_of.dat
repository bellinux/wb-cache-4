5|$|A {{challenge}} for future successful GWA {{study is to}} apply the findings {{in a way that}} accelerates drug and diagnostics development, including better integration of genetic studies into the drug-development process and a focus on the role of genetic variation in maintaining health as a blueprint for designing new drugs and diagnostics. Several studies have looked into the use of risk-SNP markers as a means of directly improving <b>the</b> <b>accuracy</b> <b>of</b> prognosis. Some have found that <b>the</b> <b>accuracy</b> <b>of</b> prognosis improves, while others report only minor benefits from this use. Generally, a problem with this direct approach is the small magnitudes of the effects observed. A small effect ultimately translates into a poor separation of cases and controls and thus only a small improvement of prognosis accuracy. An alternative application is therefore the potential for GWA studies to elucidate pathophysiology.|$|E

40|$|Naive Bayesian {{classifiers}} {{are typically}} learned from data, yet {{in this paper}} we address the construction of full and selective classifiers from information provided in the literature. We use a paper that reports on an epidemiological study in Classical Swine Fever, to build classifiers for discriminating between pig herds with and without the disease. We show that even without the original dataset, full as well as selective classifiers can be constructed. As in our case study we had the original dataset at our disposal, we were able to compare <b>the</b> <b>accuracies</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> constructed classifiers to those of the diagnostic rules reported in the paper under study; we found that <b>the</b> <b>accuracies</b> <b>of</b> our classifiers compared favourably to <b>the</b> <b>accuracies</b> <b>of</b> these rules. ...|$|R

40|$|Ninety seven {{eyes with}} {{anterior}} chamber implants and a best corrected visual acuity {{of at least}} 6 / 12 were studied, firstly, to compare <b>the</b> predictive <b>accuracies</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> commonly used formulas for intraocular lens (IOL) power calculation and, secondly, {{to determine the effect}} of optimising the 'A' constant on <b>the</b> predictive <b>accuracies</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> empirical Sanders-Retzlaff-Kraff (SRK) formulas. <b>The</b> <b>accuracies</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> empirical formulas (SRK and SRK II) were generally {{similar to those of the}} theoretical formulas (Binkhorst II and Colenbrander-Hoffer).

5|$|When skirmishing, light {{infantry}} {{fought in}} pairs, {{so that one}} soldier could cover the other while loading. Line regiments fired in volleys, but skirmishers fired at will, taking careful aim at targets. While some consideration was given to equipping light infantry with rifles, due to their improved accuracy, the expected difficulty and expense in obtaining sufficient rifled weapons resulted in the standard infantry musket being issued to most troops. <b>The</b> <b>accuracy</b> <b>of</b> the musket decreased at long range and, since the French chasseurs and voltigeurs also used muskets, {{it is likely that}} skirmishers' firefights took place at ranges of only 50 yards (or less). 10 yards provided <b>the</b> <b>accuracy</b> <b>of</b> point-blank range. Although the French infantry (and, earlier, the Americans) frequently used multi-shot and grapeshot in their muskets, the British light infantry used only standard ball ammunition.|$|E
5|$|After the Scilly naval {{disaster}} of 1707 where four ships ran aground due to navigational mistakes, the British government offered a large prize of £20,000, equivalent {{to millions of}} pounds today, for anyone who could determine longitude accurately.

5|$|In 1920, Albert Michelson and Francis Pease {{mounted a}} 6-meter {{interferometer}} {{on the front}} of the 2.5-meter telescope at Mount Wilson Observatory.

Nevertheless, carronades were used in the American Civil War.|$|E
40|$|Current {{procedures}} {{for determining the}} response of buried structures {{to the effects of}} the detonation of buried high explosives recommend decoupling the free-field stress analysis from the structure response analysis.

40|$|Age {{estimation}} {{has many}} useful applications, such as age-based face classification, finding lost children, surveillance monitoring, and face recognition invariant to age progression. Among many factors affecting age estimation accuracy, gender and facial expression can have negative effects. In our research, {{the effects of}} gender and facial expression on age estimation using support vector regression (SVR) method are investigated. Our research is novel in the following four ways. First, <b>the</b> <b>accuracies</b> <b>of</b> age estimation using a single-level local binary pattern (LBP) and a multilevel LBP (MLBP) are compared, and MLBP shows better performance as an extractor of texture features globally. Second, we compare <b>the</b> <b>accuracies</b> <b>of</b> age estimation using global features extracted by MLBP, local features extracted by Gabor filtering, and {{the combination of the}} two methods. Results show that the third approach is the most accurate.
