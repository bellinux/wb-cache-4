2500|$|<b>Tube</b> <b>sinking,</b> {{also known}} as free tube drawing, reduces the {{diameter}} of the tube without a mandrel inside the tube. The inner diameter (ID) is determined by the inner and outer diameter of the stock tube, the outer diameter of the final product, the length of the die landing, the amount of back tension, and the friction between the tube and the die. This type of drawing operation is the most economical, especially on thick-walled tubes and tubes smaller than [...] in diameter, but does not give the best surface finish. As the tube thickness increases the surface finish quality decreases. This process is often used for the tubing on low-cost lawn furniture.|$|E
2500|$|Rod {{drawing is}} the process that draws the tube with a mandrel inside the tube; the mandrel is drawn with the tube.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{investigation}} was to experimentally determine the performance characteristics of certain probe geometries and their respective locations in the <b>sink</b> <b>tube</b> of a pneumatic angular rate sensor. Sensor response was determined for various flow rates and angular velocities for each test condition.

40|$|Drawing {{processes}} {{apply to}} obtain the bimetallic tubes from the different metals and alloys, combined in the solid state, which significantly affects the specificity of this process. The manufacturing of bimetallic tubes by drawing process depends on many factors which include: preparation of the surface of materials joined in the solid state, the geometric parameters of the working tool, technological parameters of the drawing process (drawing speed, type of lubricant, the use of back pull etc.). Generally, the cold drawing process of producing the bimetallic tubes refers to metals which have high ductility (copper, aluminum, etc.). The <b>tube</b> <b>sinking</b> (tube drawing without a mandrel) of bimetallic tubes together with joining them at the interface of the two metal in the solid-state is applied for tubes of the diameter range between 6 to 20 mm and based on of the reducing {{the diameter of the}} tube. However, a slight increase of wall thickness ca. 0. 05 ÷ 0. 10 mm can appear, which is not dangerous phenomenon in case of producing the bimetallic tubes by joining in the solid-state.

40|$|A {{numerical}} {{investigation of}} a viscous incompressible fluid with constant properties within a vortex sink rate sensor is undertaken. A computer program was developed, for obtaining the numerical solution of the Navier-Stokes equations, assuming laminar flow, having general prescribed inlet conditions and axisymmetric boundary conditions. Computational results for various viscous flows and assorted boundary conditions have been obtained. In the vortex chamber, the radial momentum is conserved, whereas the axial momentum is negligible. In the sink region, the radial and tangential velocities, {{as well as the}} tangential vorticities, have significantly high values. In the <b>sink</b> <b>tube,</b> the radial momentum is negligible. The radial momentum within the vortex chamber is converted to the axial momentum in the <b>sink</b> <b>tube.</b> A change in the flow rate had an appreciable effect within the sensor and particularly near the <b>sink</b> <b>tube</b> entrance.

When applied to a source leaf, basipetal movement of 5, 6 -CF was observed after 3 h and the fluorochrome front was observed about 3 - 4 cm away from the point of application. The fluorochrome was taken up into the symplasm of the mesophyll and was loaded into the bundle sheath cells and then subsequently the vascular parenchyma and finally into the sieve <b>tubes.</b> In <b>sink</b> leaves, acropetal movement was observed after 3 h and the fluorochrome had moved approximately 3 cm away from the point of application.

Counterstaining with aniline blue demonstrates the presence of plasmodesmata and this suggests a potential symplasmic pathway from the mesophyll to the sieve tubes.

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedThis was a two-part numerical study using ANSYS Fluent to develop novel heat sink concepts from first principles. The {{objective of this}} research was to highlight geometric structures that incorporate the principles of the stack effect to improve the heat transfer capability of a heat sink under natural convection. The first part investigated the heat transfer/fluid flow characteristics of vertically aligned tubes. The gaps between tubes break up the thermal and velocity boundary layers and the moving fluid within a tube entrains the cooler ambient air surrounding the gap, thus increasing mass flow rate and average Nusselt number through each tube. The optimal gap-to-length ratio varies depending on the number of tubes in the system.

5000|$|Mercury relays {{consist of}} a {{vertical}} (usually glass) tube containing liquid mercury. They have isolated contacts {{at the bottom of}} the tube and partway up, usually in a side arm of the glass. The relay works by displacement. A pool of mercury fills the lower portion of the tube, but is insufficient to bridge the contacts. A magnetic slug of iron or steel is placed in the <b>tube,</b> where it <b>sinks</b> by gravity so as to displace the mercury. The displaced mercury rises in the tube, sufficiently to bridge the contacts and complete the circuit between them. Around the top part of the tube is placed the coil. When energised, this coil attracts the slug, lifting it upwards and out of the mercury pool. The mercury is no longer displaced, so flows downwards, away from the upper contact and the circuit opens. This allows for normally closed operation. For the more traditional normally open relay operation, the side contact is arranged somewhat higher up (or the volume of mercury is reduced) so that contact is not made when the iron slug is freely floating on the pool of mercury. The control coil is mounted below the rest level of the slug and when energised draws down the slug deeper into the pool displacing additional mercury thus raising the level to the previously uncovered side contact and closing the circuit.|$|R
