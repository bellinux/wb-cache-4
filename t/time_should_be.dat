5|$|All {{apprentices}} were to {{be educated}} in reading, writing and arithmetic {{for the first four}} years of their apprenticeship. The Act specified that this should be done every working day within usual working hours but did not state how much <b>time</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> set aside for it. Educational classes should be held {{in a part of the}} mill or factory designed for the purpose. Every Sunday, for one hour, apprentices {{were to be}} taught the Christian religion; every other Sunday, a divine service should be held in the factory, and every month the apprentices should visit a church. They should be prepared for confirmation in the Church of England between the ages of 14 and 18 and must be examined by a clergyman at least once a year. Male and female apprentices were to sleep separately and not more than two per bed.|$|E
25|$|Also, {{the change}} {{may not be}} {{relevant}} to the organization's needs. <b>Time</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> spent on the actual issues of the organization and its daily issues. To combat this challenge, a strategy must be built. The organization should determine what its problems are before entering into the transformation. Training should remain linked to business results {{so that it is}} easier for employees to connect the training with everyday issues.|$|E
25|$|Subependymal nodules are {{composed}} of abnormal, swollen glial cells and bizarre multinucleated cells which are indeterminate for glial or neuronal origin. Interposed neural tissue is not present. These nodules {{have a tendency to}} calcify as the patient ages. A nodule that markedly enhances and enlarges over <b>time</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> considered suspicious for transformation into a subependymal giant cell astrocytoma, which typically develops in the region of the foramen of Monro, in which case it is at risk of developing an obstructive hydrocephalus.|$|E

25|$|One early {{attempt at}} {{lengthening}} the playing <b>time</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> mentioned. At least one manufacturer {{in the early}} 1920s, World Records, produced records that played at a constant linear velocity, controlled by Noel Pemberton Billing's patented add-on governor device. As these were played from the outside to the inside, the rotational speed of the records increased as reproduction progressed. This action is similar (although in reverse) to that on the modern compact disc and the CLV version of its predecessor, the Philips Laser Disc.|$|E
25|$|TEMED (N, N, N, N-tetramethylethylenediamine) (C6H16N2; mW: 116.21) stabilizes free {{radicals}} and improves polymerization. The rate of polymerisation and {{the properties of}} the resulting gel depend on the concentrations of {{free radicals}}. Increasing the amount of free radicals results in a decrease in the average polymer chain length, an increase in gel turbidity and a decrease in gel elasticity. Decreasing the amount shows the reverse effect. The lowest catalytic concentrations that allow polymerisation in a reasonable period of <b>time</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> used. APS and TEMED are typically used at approximately equimolar concentrations in the range of 1 to 10 mM.|$|E
25|$|The OPERA {{experiment}} {{was designed to}} capture how neutrinos switch between different identities, but Autiero realized the equipment {{could be used to}} precisely measure neutrino speed too. An earlier result from the MINOS experiment at Fermilab demonstrated that the measurement was technically feasible. The principle of the OPERA neutrino velocity {{experiment was}} to compare travel time of neutrinos against travel time of light. The neutrinos in the experiment emerged at CERN and flew to the OPERA detector. The researchers divided this distance by the speed of light in vacuum to predict what the neutrino travel <b>time</b> <b>should</b> <b>be.</b> They compared this expected value to the measured travel time.|$|E

25|$|It {{was later}} {{claimed by the}} Keller group in Switzerland that {{particle}} tunneling does indeed occur in zero real time. Their tests involved tunneling electrons, where the group argued a relativistic prediction for tunneling <b>time</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> 500-600 attoseconds (an attosecond is one quintillionth (1018) of a second). All that could be measured was 24 attoseconds, which is the limit of the test accuracy. Again, though, other physicists believe that tunneling experiments in which particles appear to spend anomalously short times inside the barrier are in fact fully compatible with relativity, although there is disagreement about whether the explanation involves reshaping of the wave packet or other effects.|$|E
25|$|The mode of {{inheritance}} for A-T is autosomal recessive. Each {{parent is}} a carrier, {{meaning that they}} have one normal copy of the A-T gene (ATM) and one copy which is mutated. A-T occurs if a child inherits the mutated A-T gene from each parent, so in a family with two carrier parents, there is 1 chance in 4 that a child born to the parents will have the disorder. Prenatal diagnosis (and carrier detection) {{can be carried out}} in families if the errors (mutation) in an affected child’s two ATM genes have been identified. The process of getting this done can be complicated and, as it requires <b>time,</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> arranged before conception.|$|E
25|$|Horwitz summarises {{findings}} of SLA research, and applies to L2 teaching some principles of L2 acquisition honed from a vast body of relevant literature. Like Asher, Horwitz {{highlights the importance}} of naturalistic experience in L2, promoting listening and reading practice and stressing involvement in lifelike conversations. She explicitly suggests teaching practices based on these principles; ‘uch class <b>time</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> devoted to the development of listening and reading abilities’, and ‘eachers should assess student interests and supply appropriate…materials’. The ‘audio-lingual’ teaching practices {{used in the present study}} are based on principles explicated by Asher and Horwitz; listening featured heavily, closely followed by reading and speaking practice. The vocabulary items taught were deemed relevant for all learners, regardless of age, and, according to Pfeffer, they are among the most commonly used nouns in everyday German language.|$|E

25|$|One of Haider's main {{political}} struggles was the {{one against}} bilingualism in southern Carinthia, where an indigenous Slovene ethnic-linguistic community, known as the Carinthian Slovenes, lives. Already in the 1980s, Haider pursued a policy of segregation in schools, insisting on physically dividing the Slovene and German-speaking pupils in elementary schools in southern Carinthia. In December 2001, the Austrian Constitutional Court ruled that topographic road signs in all settlements in Carinthia which have had more than 10% of Slovene-speaking inhabitants {{over a longer period}} of <b>time,</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> written both in German and Slovene. Haider refused to carry out this decision, which has been reiterated by the Court several times thereafter, and publicly threatened to sue the president of the Constitutional Court. Instead of erecting hundreds of new bilingual signs, as ruled by the court, Haider ordered the removal of several existing ones, which triggered a wave of protest among the local Slovene minority, including acts of civil disobedience.|$|E
500|$|As these {{qualifying}} exams {{are extremely}} rigorous, support is usually available to people progressing through the exams. Often, employers provide paid on-the-job study time and paid attendance at seminars {{designed for the}} exams [...] Also, many companies that employ actuaries have automatic pay raises or promotions when exams are passed. As a result, actuarial students have strong incentives for devoting adequate study time during off-work hours. A common rule of thumb for exam students is that, for the Society of Actuaries examinations, roughly 400hours of study time are necessary for each four-hour exam [...] Thus, thousands of hours of study <b>time</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> anticipated over several years, assuming no failures [...]|$|E
500|$|The {{finished}} {{pilot was}} 28 minutes long, which {{was too long}} to air, as Parker and Stone {{did not realize that}} more <b>time</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> allowed for television commercials during the half-hour spot reserved for an episode on Comedy Central. In order to shorten the episode to 22 minutes, the creators cut out about ten minutes worth of material, and added back another three minutes, in order to tie up the changed storyline. For example, in the original pilot, Cartman farts fire because some older kids feed him hot tamales, while in the shortened version, he does so because of the alien probe implanted in him. Other scenes focused more heavily on the character Pip. The scene where he is introduced was later inserted into the fifth episode of the series, [...] "An Elephant Makes Love to a Pig", in its original, cutout animation form. The storyline additions were created with the use of computer animation, and all subsequent episodes of the series have been computer animated. While the creators' aim was for the computer animation to visually simulate the cardboard cutout animation, the techniques were not perfected until later in the series, and as a result, the two styles of animation are easily distinguishable in the pilot.|$|E

500|$|Donovan taught Lennon {{a guitar}} finger-picking {{technique}} that he {{passed on to}} Harrison. The technique was subsequently implemented by Lennon on the Beatles songs [...] "Julia" [...] and [...] "Dear Prudence". The latter was composed by Lennon to lure Prudence Farrow out of her intense meditation. Lennon later said: [...] "She'd been locked in for three weeks {{and was trying to}} reach God quicker than anyone else". Another inspiration was hearing for the first time Bob Dylan's newly released album, John Wesley Harding. The stay at the ashram {{turned out to be one}} of the group's most creative periods. According to Lennon he wrote some of the [...] "most miserable" [...] and some of his [...] "best songs" [...] while he was in Rishikesh. Both Lennon and McCartney often spent time composing rather than meditating, and even Starr wrote a song, [...] "Don't Pass Me By", which was his first solo composition. Plans were made for a concert in Delhi to feature the Beatles, the Beach Boys, Donovan, and Paul Horn. Harrison complained that more <b>time</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> spent on meditating, saying, [...] "We're not here to talk about music. We're here to meditate." [...] Lennon commented on Harrison's commitment to meditation by saying: [...] "The way George [...] is going, he'll be flying a magic carpet by the time he's forty." ...|$|E

2500|$|A {{familiar}} use of modular arithmetic {{is in the}} 12-hour clock, {{in which}} the day {{is divided into two}} 12-hour periods. If the time is 7:00 now, then 8 hours later it will be 3:00. Usual addition would suggest that the later <b>time</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> , {{but this is not the}} answer because clock time [...] "wraps around" [...] every 12 hours. Because the hour number starts over after it reaches 12, this is arithmetic modulo 12. According to the definition below, 12 is congruent not only to 12 itself, but also to 0, so the time called [...] "12:00" [...] could also be called [...] "0:00", since 12 is congruent to 0 modulo 12.|$|E
2500|$|Both the Joint Planning Staff and the Chiefs of Staff Committee {{failed to}} find any virtue in Churchill's revised plan. In a memo dated 8 June 1942, they restated their {{objections}} based mainly on insufficient air cover, this time compounded by the autumn and winter weather in which the operation {{was expected to be}} carried out. Weight was added to the argument by Vice Admiral Louis Mountbatten, the Chief of Combined Operations and a protégé of Churchill's, who unexpectedly wrote to the director of naval planning, saying that Jupiter was [...] "impractical" [...] and that no further <b>time</b> <b>should</b> <b>be</b> spent on the project. Mountbatten was already involved with Project Plough, a plan for the First Special Service Force, a joint American-Canadian commando unit, to be inserted by air into the Norwegian mountains; however, it seems that there was never any serious plan to link the two operations.|$|E

Nearly ten years before, in late 2002, as the BBC aired a damning documentary on British crimes committed during the rebellion and 6,000 depositions had been taken for the legal case, former district colonial officer John Nottingham had expressed concern that compensation be paid soon, since most victims were in their 80s and would soon pass away. He told the BBC: [...] "What went on in the Kenya camps and villages was brutal, savage torture.
