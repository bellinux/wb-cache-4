[...] "Hello Kitty" [...] {{was written by}} Lavigne, Chad Kroeger, David Hodges and Martin Johnson, while the song was produced by Kroeger and Hodges. Brandon Paddock and Kyle Moorman became assistants in its production. The song was engineered by John Hanes, musical mixed by Serban Ghenea and additional programming was held by Paddock and Moorman. Lavigne described the lyrics while talking to Digital Spy, [...] "'Hello Kitty' was such an interesting topic and subject [...] It was really exciting for me. I didn't want it to sound like anything I'd done before. I wanted it to sound over the top so I ended up hiring a new producer <b>to</b> <b>help</b> <b>me</b> <b>with</b> it." ...|$|E
2500|$|On December 16, 2013, Newsted {{expanded}} upon previous statements {{regarding his}} departure from Metallica and cited that his project with Echobrain was being discouraged by James Hetfield because Metallica's management at Q Prime {{wanted to go}} ahead with promoting Echobrain but was forced to drop it by Hetfield's demands with the quote [...] "other arrangements can be made". Jason was sure that Echobrain would not affect Metallica as it was the pedigree that it already needed. Newsted continues, “And so they had told me, pretty convincingly, ‘This is a great record, we’ve been playing it around the office, that’s all I’ve been hearing, it’s fantastic, this kid has a great voice. Let’s do something with this.’ That’s what they told me, and then James Hetfield heard about it and was not happy. He was, I think, pretty much out to put the kibosh on the whole thing because it would somehow affect Metallica in his eyes, because now the managers were interested in something I was doing {{that had nothing to do}} with him. ”The bassist sums up the situation as follows: “I have no idea what [...] was thinking, other than just protecting what he valued, just like he does; that's his thing. He protects what he loves, squeezes it too hard, like he said himself. Squeeze it too hard, protecting it too much. That's where I was coming from. The people that I had counted on for 15 years <b>to</b> <b>help</b> <b>me</b> <b>with</b> my career, help Metallica, take care of my money, do all of those things, told me, 'Your new project is fantastic, we'd like to help you with it.' James heard about it, the manager calls me back a couple of days later – 'Sorry we're not going to be able to help you with that Echobrain thing.'” ...|$|E

6000|$|... "By God, no!" [...] said he. [...] "I need no such advantage, sir. Courthon, {{be so good}} as <b>to</b> <b>help</b> <b>me</b> on <b>with</b> {{my boots}} again." [...] And there was a fresh delay whilst he resumed them.|$|R

6000|$|Newman {{answered}} nothing, but he detained {{the marquis}} {{as the latter}} was beginning gracefully to recede. [...] "It {{is a good time}} for me to thank you," [...] he said, [...] "for sticking so punctiliously to our bargain, for doing so much <b>to</b> <b>help</b> <b>me</b> on <b>with</b> your sister." ...|$|R

[...] "Got be praised! {{you seem}} unhurt, and are {{just in time}} <b>to</b> <b>help</b> <b>me</b> along <b>with</b> this Huron, on whom I blundered in the dark, and have disarmed and captured. Give him a kick or a push, if you please; for the fellow holds back like a hog." ...|$|R
40|$|I {{would like}} to thank Dr. Eric Sinzinger for his {{guidance}} on my dissertation and doctoral work. His dedication <b>to</b> <b>helping</b> <b>me</b> <b>with</b> my work <b>helped</b> keep <b>me</b> motivated and made my advancement through the doctoral program easier. A thanks is due to Dr. Karlene Hoo, she has given me great insight in what is expected of doctoral students and doctorates after graduation. I {{would like to}} thank Dr. Susan Mengel for her support and sharing of knowledge throughout my graduate program. I also owe thanks to Dr. Eun Youn for his help with support vector machines. Huge thanks go out to all the people that allowed me to take a picture of them for my image database. Finally, I need to thank AT&T, NASA and the Texas Tech University Department of Computer Science for funding my doctorate...|$|R

6000|$|How I {{longed for}} one hour of Hilda <b>to</b> <b>help</b> <b>me</b> out <b>with</b> her almost infallible instinct. I {{realised}} how feeble and fallacious was my own groping in the dark. Her knowledge of temperament would have revealed to her at once what I was trying to discover, like the police she despised, by the clumsy [...] "clues" [...] which so roused her sarcasm.|$|R
6000|$|... "Very good, Captain Maryon," [...] says Pordage, in a {{tremendous}} passion. [...] "Very good, sir. Be the consequences {{on your own}} head! Mr. Kitten, as it has come <b>to</b> this, <b>help</b> <b>me</b> on <b>with</b> it." ...|$|R
60|$|As for me, my {{mind was}} in a whirl. I was entirely without a plan, without the very {{beginnings}} of a plan, <b>to</b> <b>help</b> <b>me</b> cope <b>with</b> this appalling situation. I was crushed {{by a sense of}} the utter helplessness of my position. To denounce Sam was impossible; to explain my comparative innocence was equally out of the question. The suddenness of the onslaught had deprived me of the power of coherent thought. I was routed.|$|R

Uncle Tom and Aunt Sally ain't {{going to spend}} their golden wedding in the poorhouse--no, sir. They'll spend it {{in their own home}} with their old friends about them. But they're not to know {{anything}} about it till the very night. Do you s'pose any of the old furniture could be got back?" ...|$|R
40|$|First and foremost, I {{would like}} to express my {{gratitude}} to my thesis supervisor Prof. Harrick Vin. Harrick was instrumental in my building a foundation {{in the art of}} critical thinking. He followed through with insightful comments, continually urging me to stay focused and seek out the fundamental wisdom. Harrick’s brilliance, enthusiasm, and his yearning for excellence have inspired me to improve myself throughout my graduate student life. In addition <b>to</b> <b>helping</b> <b>me</b> <b>with</b> my academic matters, Harrick has been a well-wisher, a true friend and a guide; a lot of what I learnt about life in general is due to him. I {{would like to}} express my heartfelt thanks to Prof. Steve Keckler. Steve <b>helped</b> <b>me</b> <b>with</b> many technical problems that I {{would not have been able}} to get past on my own. He has been unfailingly kind to me and was always willing to teach me in spite of my innate petulance. Without Steve’s generous help, I would not have been able to finish this dissertation. I would also like to thank Dr. Raj Yavtkar of Intel Corporation. Raj was instrumental in initiating the work that eventually grew into my thesis. Raj’s extraordinary ability to strike the right balance betwee...|$|R
6000|$|... "Very, and {{therefore}} {{you are talking}} it now! Ermine, how shall I thank you? Not only {{for the sake of}} the ease of mind to my poor brother; but in the scenes we are going through, a drop of happiness is wanted as a stimulant. When I looked at the young couple at Bishopsworthy, I often felt as if another half-year of suspense was more than I could bear, and that I must ask you <b>to</b> <b>help</b> <b>me</b> through <b>with</b> at least a definite hope." ...|$|R
60|$|I was {{not quite}} {{prepared}} with an answer to this. I asked him <b>to</b> <b>help</b> <b>me</b> <b>with</b> a hint. No! Benjamin would take no active part in the matter. He was resigned to be employed in the capacity of passive instrument--and there all concession ended, so {{far as he was}} concerned.|$|E
6000|$|Lulu {{glared at}} him and said, in a voice of honey and aloes, [...] "I'm sure, papa dear, I don't ask very much of you, and when I do ask just this one little thing that I'm sure anybody else would be glad <b>to</b> <b>help</b> <b>me</b> <b>with</b> and me doing my very best to make you happy--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Come now," [...] she said, [...] "son Henry, unfold {{your arms}} from about my patient, {{though she is}} worth the pressing, and set thy hands at freedom <b>to</b> <b>help</b> <b>me</b> <b>with</b> what I want. Nay, I will not insist on your quitting her hand, if you will beat the palm gently, as the fingers unclose their clenched grasp." ...|$|E
60|$|To me Ella was a queen, {{a kindly}} queen, ever ready <b>to</b> <b>help</b> <b>me</b> out <b>with</b> my algebra. Everything she did seemed to <b>me</b> {{instinct}} <b>with</b> womanly grace. No doubt {{she read the}} worship in my eyes, but her attitude was that of an older sister. Cora, being nearer my own age, awed me not at all. On the contrary, we were more inclined to battle than to coo. Her coolness toward me, I soon discovered, was sustained by her growing interest in {{a young man from}} Cerro Gordo County.|$|R
60|$|LADY BRITOMART. My dear: we can't go on all {{our lives}} not {{mentioning}} him. Of course you were quite right not to open the subject until I asked you to; but you are old enough now {{to be taken into}} my confidence, and <b>to</b> <b>help</b> <b>me</b> <b>to</b> deal <b>with</b> him about the girls.|$|R
40|$|I {{would like}} to express my thanks to my {{research}} advisor, Brian Bergquist. His consultant and thorough guidance were necessary and greatly appreciated through the duration of this project. In addition, I {{would like to}} thank all my friends- Demi and Bryan- for advises and encouragement, my mother and father who provided me a great opportunity for studying in America and especially to Nghi <b>To</b> who <b>helped</b> <b>me</b> <b>with</b> my English writing. Lastly, I {{would like to thank}} all other friends I failed to mention the names for the constant support during the project...|$|R
60|$|I was now led, {{with the}} same {{precautions}} against noise, into the little bow-windowed dining-room of the cottage. The shutters were up, the lamp guiltily turned low; the beautiful Flora greeted me in a whisper; and when I was set down to table, the pair proceeded <b>to</b> <b>help</b> <b>me</b> <b>with</b> precautions that might have seemed excessive in the Ear of Dionysius.|$|E
6000|$|... "Not so, Ana. If one loves, one loves at once. Soon I {{shall be}} old {{and she will}} be fat and ugly, and how can one love then? Get well quickly, Ana, for I wish you <b>to</b> <b>help</b> <b>me</b> <b>with</b> my report to Pharaoh. I shall tell him that I think these Israelites are much oppressed {{and that he should}} make them amends and let them go." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, yes, Dorinda dear. At least, I'm worried over it. Jean loves music so, and she {{has never}} had anything, poor child, not even as much school as she ought to have had. I've had to keep her home so much <b>to</b> <b>help</b> <b>me</b> <b>with</b> the work. She {{has been such a}} good, patient little girl too, and her heart is set on music lessons." ...|$|E
6000|$|... “Entirely {{owing to}} you, Mrs. Archer, as I told {{you in the}} first letter I wrote to you after I got my promotion. You taught me to like study, and were always ready <b>to</b> <b>help</b> <b>me</b> on <b>with</b> my work, and it was entirely owing to my having learned so much, {{especially}} mathematics, that I was able {{to attract the attention}} of the officers and to get put on the quarter-deck. I have, I am happy to say, done very well, and I am sure of my step as soon as I have passed.|$|R

60|$|I glanced up, and behold! The sky was {{streaked}} with bright green trails. They radiated {{from a point}} halfway between the western horizon and the zenith, and within the shining clouds of the meteor a streaming movement had begun, so {{that it seemed to}} be pouring both westwardly and back toward the east, with a crackling sound, as though the whole heaven was stippled over with phantom pistol-shots. It seemed to me then as if the meteor was coming <b>to</b> <b>help</b> <b>me,</b> descending <b>with</b> those thousand pistols like a curtain to fend off this unmeaning foolishness of the sea.|$|R
