5|$|As {{described}} by quantum chromodynamics, <b>the</b> <b>strong</b> <b>interaction</b> <b>between</b> quarks is mediated by gluons, massless vector gauge bosons. Each gluon carries one color charge and one anticolor charge. In the standard framework of particle interactions (part {{of a more}} general formulation known as perturbation theory), gluons are constantly exchanged between quarks through a virtual emission and absorption process. When a gluon is transferred between quarks, a color change occurs in both; for example, if a red quark emits a red–antigreen gluon, it becomes green, and if a green quark absorbs a red–antigreen gluon, it becomes red. Therefore, while each quark's color constantly changes, their strong interaction is preserved.|$|E

The value of m for NBR-GO and NBR-rGO was 18.5 and 22.2 respectively, while that of EPDM-GO and EPDM-rGO compounds was 3.3 and 4.4 correspondently. Thus, the neat NBR compounds shows about 461 and 405 % higher interactions with GO and rGO fillers compared to the respective interactions in EPDM filled compounds.
