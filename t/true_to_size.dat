The existing temporal method for the ‘salmon’ life history produces {{an estimate of the}} harmonic mean Nb in the two sampled years. SALMONNb reads genotypic data in standard formats and computes yearly Nb values by combining information from pairwise comparisons of samples taken in 3 or more years.

Even though we found effects {{in the same direction as}} the original, they were substantively smaller; the original study would have had less than 33 % power to detect an effect of this magnitude. The influence of plausibility on the curse of knowledge in adults appears to be small enough that its impact on real-life perspective-taking may need to be reevaluated...|$|R
40|$|In der vorliegenden Arbeit wurde ein Simulator für die diagnostische und therapeutische ERCP entwickelt und mit den bereits vorhandenen Tübinger Simulatoren für den oberen und unteren Gastrointestinaltrakt in ein modular aufgebautes Gesamtsystem integriert. Das Gesamtsystem erlaubt die anatomieadäquate Simulation der Gastroskopie, Coloskopie, Bronchoskopie und der ERCP. Im Rahmen der therapeutischen Endoskopie können an Interventionen die Papillotomie, Polypektomie, Tumortherapie (APC, Ballondilatation, Stentimplantation), PEG-Implantation und Blutstillungsverfahren wie APC, Fibrinklebung, Clipverfahren und Endoloop systematisch wie in vivo trainiert werden. Das im Rahmen der Arbeit entwickelte ERCP-Modul besteht aus einem Mündungssystem und einem Gangsystem. Das erzielte Simulationsangebot umfaßt die Sondierung der Papille, die Kontrastmittelfüllung des biliopankreatischen Gangsystems und die Papillotomie. Für die diagnostische ERCP wurde eine nicht interventionsfähige Latexpapille hergestellt, die sich in der Erprobung als sehr stabil erwies und sich deshalb insbesondere für Anfängerkurse eignet. Die therapeutische ERCP wurde an einer Papille aus Hühnerherz simuliert und getestet, die bei der Applikation von HF-Strom die geforderten realitätsgetreuen Ergebnisse zeigt (präziser Schnitt mit scharfen Schnitträndern und gelb-braune Koagulationszone). Die Kontrastmittelinstillation konnte mit einem aus Latexschläuchen hergestellten biliopankreatischen Gangsystem angemessen simuliert werden. Die Röntgenaufnahmen liefern anatomieadäquate Bilder. Mit Latex wurde ein Material gefunden, das die Anforderungen an die realtitätsgetreue Simulation künstlicher Organe in hohem Maße erfüllt. Die mit Latex erstellten Organe sind abformgenau, die Latexsegmente entsprechen detailgetreu den anatomischen Vorgaben. Die durchgeführten Tests zeigen, daß sich Latex auch für die Herstellung sehr kleiner Organsegmente eignet und farbgetreue Organsegmente herstellbar sind. Die Simulation der HF-chirurgischen Effekte konnte mit der Entwicklung von Artitex Typ I und II gelöst werden. Im Rahmen der Arbeit konnte gezeigt werden, daß sich Artitex Typ I für die Simulation der Gewebekoagulation eignet, die bei der Tumortherapie im Vordergrund steht, Artitex Typ II für die Simulation der Gewebetrennung, die bei der Polypektomie gefordert ist. In {{this thesis}} a {{simulator}} for diagnostic and therapeutic ERCP was developed. It was {{integrated into a}} modular system with simulators for {{the upper and lower}} gastrointestinal tract previously developed at the University Hospital in Tübingen. The system allows an anatomy adequate simulation of gastroscopy, colonoscopy, bronchoscopy and ERCP. In the area of therapeutic endoscopy the following interventions can be trained in a realistic way: papillotomy, polypectomy, tumor therapy (APC, balloon dilatation, stent implantation), PEG and hemostatic procedures such as APC, injection techniques, clipping, and endoloop. The ERCP module developed {{in the course of this}} thesis consists of a papilla and a duct system. The available simulations are the cannulation of the papilla, instillation of contrast medium of the biliopancreatic system, and the papillotomy. A latex papilla not suitable for interventions was constructed for the diagnostic ERCP, it proved to be very resistant and is therefore especially suitable for beginners. The therapeutic ERCP was simulated and tested on a papilla build from the heart of a chicken, when applying HF-current it shows the wanted realistic results (a precise cut with sharp cut edges and yellow-brown coagulation area). The installation of contrast medium can be simulated adequately with the biliopancreatic system constructed from tubes made of latex. The X-rays show anatomy adequate images. With latex we found a material that meets the requirements of a realistic simulation of artificial organs to a great extend. The organs constructed from latex are <b>true</b> <b>to</b> <b>size,</b> the latex segments correspond accurately to the anatomic dimensions. The tests conducted show that latex is also suitable for the construction of very small organ segments and that color true organ segments can be constructed. The simulation of electrosurgical procedures can be solved with the development of Artitex Typ I and II. In the course of this thesis it was shown that Aritex Typ I is suitable for tissue coagulation, which is the focus of tumor therapy. Aritex Typ II is suitable for the simulation of tissue cutting, which is necessary for polypectomy...|$|E
5000|$|In the {{automotive}} industry, engine displacement is frequently encoded {{in the auto}} manufacturer's model names. For instance, Nissan's Teana 350JM is {{a car with a}} [...] displacement engine. Motorcycles are often labeled similarly. However, this can be misleading. For instance, the BMW 335i only has a 3.0-litre (twin-turbocharged) engine, the Bugatti Veyron 16.4 has an 8.0-litre (quad-turbocharged W16) engine, and the Lamborghini Gallardo LP560-4 has a 5.2-litre engine (with a maximum power output of 560 PS). Lexus hybrid vehicles (h) are marked higher than <b>true</b> engine <b>size</b> <b>to</b> signify the extra power from auxiliary systems.

30|$|Because {{we assumed}} {{heterogeneity}} across FWPs and sample characteristics, the random effects model seemed appropriate (Viechtbauer 2010). This model expects the <b>true</b> effect <b>sizes</b> <b>to</b> have different values in different studies, {{and to be}} random but normally distributed, taking on different values in different studies (Raudenbush 2009). We investigated {{the validity of the}} assumption of a random effects model using the Chi-squared statistic Q. It indicates whether all the observed heterogeneity was due to sampling error variance. We first transformed reported statistics such as means and standard deviations, F tests and standardized betas into correlations. As all betas were within the range from −  0.50 and 0.50, the transformation is appropriate (Peterson and Brown 2005). When studies reported multiple measurements referring to the same construct, the combined effect sizes were calculated using Hunter and Schmidt’s (2004) formula.|$|R

40|$|Objects appear {{enlarged}} {{in water}} {{by less than}} the 4 / 3 angular magnification. They usually appear beyond their optical distance and slightly enlarged in linear size, but not in accordance with size-distance invariance (SDI). We investigated whether misperceptions of angular size could explain the discrepancies. Twenty observers viewed targets of various sizes and distances within transparent tanks 40 cm long containing air or water. They judged distance by hidden reaching, and linear or angular size by adjusting {{the size of a}} target in air at a further distance. Matched distance was close to physical distance in air and optical distance in water. All size matches were close <b>to</b> <b>true</b> linear <b>size,</b> and were larger in water than in air. Angular size matches were much too small to explain departures from SDI. Size perception under water is best explained by incomplete adaptation to optical distortion, and by the use of various size cues...|$|R
