5|$|One {{of the key}} {{contributors}} to globalization was the <b>Triangular</b> <b>Trade</b> and how it connected the world. The <b>Triangular</b> <b>Trade</b> or Triangle Trade was a system used to connect three {{areas of the world}} through trade. Once traded, items and goods were shipped {{to other parts of the}} world, making the triangle trade a key to global trade. The Triangle Trade system was run by Europeans, increasing their global power.|$|E
5|$|Proto-globalization {{distinguished}} {{itself from}} modern globalization {{on the basis}} of expansionism, the method of managing global trade, and the level of information exchange. The period of proto-globalization is marked by such trade arrangements as the East India Company, the shift of hegemony to Western Europe, the rise of larger-scale conflicts between powerful nations such as the Thirty Year War, and a rise of new commodities—most particularly slave trade. The <b>Triangular</b> <b>Trade</b> made it possible for Europe to take advantage of resources within the western hemisphere. The transfer of plant and animal crops and epidemic diseases associated with Alfred Crosby's concept of The Columbian Exchange also {{played a central role in}} this process. Proto-globalization trade and communications involved a vast group including European, Muslim, Indian, Southeast Asian and Chinese merchants, particularly in the Indian Ocean region.|$|E
5|$|The African colonies enabled Brandenburg-Prussia to {{participate}} in the <b>Triangular</b> <b>trade,</b> yet it lacked its own trading post in the Caribbean Sea. In 1684, Brandenburg-Prussia was denied the purchase of the French islands Sainte Croix and Saint Vincent. In November 1685, after a failed attempt to purchase Saint Thomas from Denmark–Norway, a Brandenburg-Danish agreement was reached that allowed the Brandenburg African Company to rent part of Saint Thomas as a base for 30 years, while the sovereignty remained with Denmark and administration with the Danish West Indies and Guinean Company. The first Brandenburgian vessel arrived in 1686 with 450 Slaves from Großfriedrichsburg. Brandenburg-Prussia was allotted an area near the capital city Charlotte Amalie, called Brandenburgery, and other territories named Krum Bay and Bordeaux Estates further west. In 1688, 300 Europeans and several hundred slaves lived on the Brandenburgian estates. In November 1695, French forces looted the Brandenburgian (not the Danish) colony. In 1731, the Brandenburg-Prussian company on Saint Thomas (BAAC) became insolvent, and abandoned the island in 1735. Their last remains were sold by auction in 1738.|$|E
25|$|The {{historian}} Walter Rodney {{contends that}} it was a decline in the profitability of the <b>triangular</b> <b>trades</b> that made it possible for certain basic human sentiments to be asserted at the decision-making level in a number of European countries- Britain being the most crucial because it was the greatest carrier of African captives across the Atlantic. Rodney states that changes in productivity, technology, and patterns of exchange in Europe and the Americas informed the decision by the British to end their participation in the trade in 1807. In 1809 President James Madison outlawed the slave trade with the United States.|$|R

An appreciation of the yen against the dollar would also cause the yen to appreciate against the RMB and other currencies in East Asia with heavily managed exchange rate regimes.

40|$|Considering {{the purpose}} of {{conducting}} any foreign trade transaction, which is generally limited to obtaining a commercial advantage by attracting foreign contribution with the smallest costs and considering {{the role of the}} accounting information and the need to involve it in decision-making due to its increased credibility and relevance in the eyes of internal and external users, in what follows we intend to develop accounting models specific to <b>triangular</b> foreign <b>trade</b> transactions in relation to the transport contractual relations established between the partners involved in such operations, but only after we shall first analyze the fiscal issues that influence the entries into accounts of such commercial businesses. Thus, in order to achieve the goals set through the scientific approach that targeted the accounting information and management of <b>triangular</b> foreign <b>trade</b> transactions, the research methods used were based both on general and specific approaches, using in particular documentation, case study or benchmarking, an aspect that allowed us to conclude that the study made has also acquired an empirical nature, in addition to the descriptive one, materialized in the analysis carried out on tax and accounting information from the entities performing foreign trade, a research whose information support is based, in addition to the studied literature related to the investigated field, on the tax, customs and accounting laws specific to <b>triangular</b> foreign <b>trade</b> transactions, but also on the data collected from the entities under study. ...|$|R
5|$|Two years later, the Royal African Company was inaugurated, {{receiving}} from King Charles {{a monopoly}} {{of the trade}} to supply slaves to the British colonies of the Caribbean. From the outset, slavery was {{the basis of the}} British Empire in the West Indies. Until the abolition of its slave trade in 1807, Britain was responsible for the transportation of 3.5 million African slaves to the Americas, a third of all slaves transported across the Atlantic. To facilitate this trade, forts were established on the coast of West Africa, such as James Island, Accra and Bunce Island. In the British Caribbean, the percentage of the population of African descent rose from 25% in 1650 to around 80% in 1780, and in the Thirteen Colonies from 10% to 40% over the same period (the majority in the southern colonies). For the slave traders, the trade was extremely profitable, and became a major economic mainstay for such western British cities as Bristol and Liverpool, which formed the third corner of the <b>triangular</b> <b>trade</b> with Africa and the Americas. For the transported, harsh and unhygienic conditions on the slaving ships and poor diets meant that the average mortality rate during the Middle Passage was one in seven.|$|E
5|$|The {{maritime}} fur trade {{brought the}} Pacific Northwest coast into a vast, new international trade network, {{centered on the}} north Pacific Ocean, global in scope, and based on capitalism, but not, for the most part, on colonialism. A <b>triangular</b> <b>trade</b> network emerged linking the Pacific Northwest coast, China, the Hawaiian Islands (only recently discovered by the Western world), Britain, and the United States (especially New England). The trade had a major effect on the indigenous people of the Pacific Northwest coast, especially the Aleut, Sugpiaq, Tlingit, Haida, Nuu-chah-nulth, and Chinook peoples. A rapid increase of wealth occurred among the Northwest Coast natives, along with increased warfare, potlatching, slaving, and depopulation due to epidemic disease. However, the indigenous culture was not overwhelmed by rapid change, but actually flourished. For instance, the importance of totems and traditional nobility crests increased, and the Chinook Jargon, which remains a distinctive aspect of Pacific Northwest culture, was developed during this era. Native Hawaiian society was similarly affected by the sudden influx of Western wealth and technology, as well as epidemic diseases. The trade's effect on China and Europe was minimal, but for New England, the maritime fur trade and the significant profits it made helped revitalize the region, contributing to its transformation from an agrarian to an industrial society. The wealth generated by the maritime fur trade was invested in industrial development, especially textile manufacturing. The New England textile industry in turn had a large effect on slavery in the United States, increasing the demand for cotton and helping make possible {{the rapid expansion of}} the cotton plantation system across the Deep South.|$|E

5|$|Boston was {{an early}} port of the Atlantic <b>triangular</b> slave <b>trade</b> in the New England colonies, but was soon {{overtaken}} by Salem, Massachusetts and Newport, Rhode Island. Boston eventually became a center of the abolitionist movement. The city reacted strongly to the Fugitive Slave Act of 1850, contributing to President Franklin Pierce's attempt to make an example of Boston after the Anthony Burns Fugitive Slave Case.|$|R
5000|$|Lamport and Holt (L&H) traded {{with the}} Americas, India and South Africa. They used wooden sailing ships {{at first but}} in 1861 {{invested}} in two 1300-ton tramp steamers. The business expanded {{with the formation of}} a company called The Liverpool, Brazil and River Plate Steam Navigation Co., Ltd., which provided cargo, mail and passenger services from Liverpool, London, Glasgow in the UK and also from Antwerp in Belgium. According to National Museums Liverpool, [...] "In 1869 it pioneered the Brazil — New York coffee trade." [...] Despite a relaxation of Brazilian laws, foreign shipping companies were reluctant to work the coast of that country but L&H saw an opportunity from the 1860s and exploited it using their subsidiary company, initially providing a service between Rio de Janeiro and Rio Grande do Sul. By 1869, a <b>triangular</b> <b>trading</b> route had been established that carried British manufactured goods to Brazil, re-loaded there with coffee for New York, and collected wheat and raw materials from that port for the return voyage to Britain.|$|R
25|$|Following the European Protestant Reformation {{and with}} the {{encouragement}} of the Convention of Royal Burghs, the 14 incorporated trade crafts federated as the Trades House in 1605 to match the power and influence in the town council of the earlier Merchants' Guilds who established their Merchants House in the same year. Glasgow was subsequently raised {{to the status of}} Royal Burgh in 1611. Glasgow's substantial fortunes came from international trade, manufacturing and invention, starting in the 17th century with sugar, followed by tobacco, and then cotton and linen, products of the Atlantic <b>triangular</b> slave <b>trade.</b>|$|R

25|$|Shipping traffic between Africa, the Caribbean, and Europe {{began to}} soar in the 18th century, {{a model that}} was known as <b>triangular</b> <b>trade,</b> and was a rich target for piracy. Trade ships sailed from Europe to the African coast, trading {{manufactured}} goods and weapons in exchange for slaves. The traders would then sail to the Caribbean to sell the slaves, and return to Europe with goods such as sugar, tobacco and cocoa. Another <b>triangular</b> <b>trade</b> saw ships carry raw materials, preserved cod, and rum to Europe, where {{a portion of the}} cargo would be sold for manufactured goods, which (along with the remainder of the original load) were transported to the Caribbean, where they were exchanged for sugar and molasses, which (with some manufactured articles) were borne to New England. Ships in the <b>triangular</b> <b>trade</b> made money at each stop.|$|E

But this {{contact with the}} West will soon turn into his disfavor. <b>Triangular</b> <b>trade</b> had certainly enriched a tiny minority of indigenous brokers, but it had above all unbalanced the societal structure of the Vili country. The epidemics of trypanosomiasis, smallpox, the carriage {{on the back of}} men had drastically decreased the population of this people.|$|E
50|$|Passage du milieu (Middle Passage) is a 1999 {{docudrama}} {{directed by}} Guy Deslauriers about the trans-Atlantic voyage of black slaves from the West Coast of Africa to the Caribbean, {{a part of}} the <b>triangular</b> slave <b>trade</b> route called the Middle Passage. It portrays the transportation of slaves from Senegal to the sugar plantations of Martinique and the miserable and often fatal conditions on board the slave ship.

5000|$|Race {{legislation}} in the United States is defined as legislation seeking to direct relations between races or ethnic groups. It has had several historical phases in the United States, developing from the European colonization of the Americas, the <b>triangular</b> slave <b>trade,</b> and the American Indian Wars. The 1776 Declaration of Independence included the statement that [...] "all men are created equal," [...] which has ultimately inspired actions and legislation against slavery and racial discrimination. Such actions have led to passage of the 13th, 14th, and 15th Amendments to the United States Constitution.|$|R
50|$|Some {{international}} banks {{serve as}} market makers between currencies by narrowing their bid-ask spread {{more than the}} bid-ask spread of the implicit cross exchange rate. However, the bid and ask prices of the implicit cross exchange rate naturally discipline market makers. When banks' quoted exchange rates move out of alignment with cross exchange rates, any banks or traders who detect the discrepancy {{have an opportunity to}} earn arbitrage profits via a triangular arbitrage strategy. To execute a <b>triangular</b> arbitrage <b>trading</b> strategy, a bank would calculate cross exchange rates and compare them with exchange rates quoted by other banks to identify a pricing discrepancy.|$|R
25|$|The {{bedrock of}} the economy {{continued}} to be agriculture – especially dairy farming – and fishing; lumber and shipbuilding also became major industries. Slaves were introduced at this time, {{although there is no}} record of any law re-legalizing slave holding.

25|$|Trade with Southeast Asia was {{established}} by the 1st century AD, and may have much earlier origins. Later findings include 12th-century Ceylonese coins and 14th-century Chinese coins. Similar coins from Kotchina in Sumatra point to a <b>triangular</b> <b>trade</b> between Orissa, Ceylon and Sumatra. Trading was not without risks. The kings of Kalinga, Siam and Java had to periodically mount expeditions to put down Malay and Bugis pirates operating in the Strait of Malacca and throughout Maritime Southeast Asia.|$|E
25|$|The war {{involved}} privateering by both sides. Anson {{captured a}} valuable Manila galleon, {{but this was}} more than offset by the numerous Spanish privateering attacks on British shipping along the transatlantic <b>triangular</b> <b>trade</b> route. They seized hundreds of British ships, looting their goods and slaves, and operated with virtual impunity in the West Indies; they were also active in European waters. The Spanish convoys proved almost unstoppable. During the Austrian phase of the war, the British fleet attacked poorly protected French merchantmen instead.|$|E

5000|$|It was a family-managed enterprise, {{concentrating on}} sugar {{production}} and exports, {{transportation of goods}} to supply the colony, and slavery. Slaves were imported from west Africa, put {{to work on the}} plantations, and were objects of lucrative financial trading by the business leaders. The <b>triangular</b> shipping <b>trade</b> routes of the era ran as follows: British goods were shipped to West Africa, slaves were captured and shipped to Barbados and other West Indian islands for sale, and sugar and other export crops were shipped to Britain, with great profits on all three journey legs.

25|$|Another {{important}} {{venue for}} investment after 1674 (when the second West India Company was launched, after {{the bankruptcy of}} its predecessor) was the <b>triangular</b> slave <b>trade</b> and sugar trade, based on the plantations in recently acquired Suriname and Demerara (exchanged for New Amsterdam at the Treaty of Breda (1667)). This also gave a new impulse to the sugar refineries, which {{had been in a}} slump in 1680. This {{was one of the few}} boom sectors of the economy in this era: the slave population in Surinam quadrupled between 1682 and 1713, and the volume of sugar shipments rose from 3 to 15 million pounds per annum. This was in a period when the Dutch planters, unlike their English and French competitors, did not receive mercantilist protection.|$|R
25|$|Rum {{plays a part}} in {{the culture}} of most islands of the West Indies as well as in The Maritimes and Newfoundland. This {{beverage}} has famous associations with the Royal Navy (where it was mixed with water or beer to make grog) and piracy (where it was consumed as bumbo). Rum has also served as a popular medium of economic exchange, used to help fund enterprises such as slavery (see <b>Triangular</b> <b>trade),</b> organized crime, and military insurgencies (e.g., the American Revolution and Australia's Rum Rebellion).|$|E
25|$|The colony was amalgamated {{into the}} Dominion of New England in 1686, as King James II {{attempted}} to enforce royal {{authority over the}} autonomous colonies in British North America. After the Glorious Revolution of 1688, the colony regained its independence under the Royal Charter. Slaves were introduced at this time, {{although there is no}} record of any law legalizing slave-holding. The colony later prospered under the slave trade, distilling rum to sell in Africa as part of a profitable <b>triangular</b> <b>trade</b> in slaves and sugar with the Caribbean.|$|E
25|$|The Portuguese {{attempted}} to severely restrict colonial trade, meaning that Brazil was only allowed to export and import goods from Portugal and other Portuguese colonies. Brazil exported sugar, tobacco, cotton and native products and imported from Portugal wine, olive oil, textiles and luxury goods – the latter imported by Portugal from other European countries. Africa played {{an essential role}} as the supplier of slaves, and Brazilian slave traders in Africa frequently exchanged cachaça, a distilled spirit derived from sugarcane, and shells, for slaves. This comprised what {{is now known as}} the <b>Triangular</b> <b>trade</b> between Europe, Africa and the Americas during the colonial period.|$|E
50|$|Opened in 1996, the Gallery of Modern Art {{is housed}} in a neoclassical {{building}} in Royal Exchange Square {{in the heart of}} Glasgow city center. Built in 1778 as the townhouse of William Cunninghame of Lainshaw, a wealthy Glasgow Tobacco Lord who made his fortune through the <b>triangular</b> slave <b>trade,</b> the building has undergone a series of different uses. It was bought in 1817 by the Royal Bank of Scotland who later moved onto Buchanan Street; it then became the Royal Exchange. Reconstruction for this use was undertaken by David Hamilton between 1827 and 1832 and resulted in many additions to the building, namely the Corinthian pillars to the Queen Street facade, the cupola above and the large hall {{to the rear of the}} old house.|$|R
50|$|The trade {{proceeded}} {{in three}} steps, {{often called the}} <b>triangular</b> slave <b>trade.</b> The ships left Western Europe for Africa loaded with goods which were to be exchanged for slaves. Upon their arrival in Africa, the captains traded their merchandise for captive slaves. Weapons and gunpowder {{were the most important}} commodities but textiles, pearls and other manufactured goods, as well as rum, were also in high demand. The exchange could last from one week to several months. The second step was the crossing of the Atlantic. Africans were transported to Americas to be sold throughout the continent. The third step connected Americas to Europe. The slave traders brought back mostly agricultural products, produced by the slaves. The main product was sugar, followed by cotton, coffee, tobacco and rice.|$|R
5000|$|Previous {{scholars}} of documents {{found in the}} Cairo geniza had concentrated on texts written in Hebrew and Aramaic. Rustow chose to study those written in Arabic, which often appear [...] "in the margins and {{on the backs of}} such documents." [...] Her studies with colleagues have led to insights about the everday lives of the Jews of Cairo, such as that they [...] "imported sheep cheese from Sicily—it was deemed kosher—and filled containers at the bazaar with warm food in an early version of takeout." [...] There was a <b>triangular</b> Mediterranean <b>trade</b> route between Egypt, Tunisia and Sicily in the 11th century, and flax used to make linen fabric, and soap, were the main commodities. [...] "Everyone wore linen all the time," [...] according to Rustow.|$|R
25|$|The first {{recorded}} European visit {{was that of}} Giovanni da Verrazzano, who anchored in The Narrows in 1524. For the next hundred years, the region was visited sporadically by ships on fishing trips and slave raids. European colonization began after Henry Hudson's 1609 exploration of the region {{with the establishment of}} New Amsterdam, the capital of the Dutch province of New Netherland at the tip of Manhattan. The British colonial era saw a concerted effort to expand the port in the <b>triangular</b> <b>trade</b> between Europe, Africa, and North America with a concentration of wharves along the mouth of the East River. After the Battle of Brooklyn, the British controlled the harbor for the duration of American Revolutionary War, and prison ships housed thousands at Wallabout Bay.|$|E

50|$|The town {{experienced}} {{a period of}} growth when John Law formed the Perpetual Company of the Indies by absorbing other chartered companies (including the French East India Company), and chose Lorient as its operative base.

In 1732, the Company decided to transfer its sales headquarters from Nantes to Lorient, and asked architect Jacques Gabriel to raise new buildings out of dimension stones to host these new activities, and to embellish the L'Enclos domain. Sales began in 1734, peaking up to 25 million livres tournois. In 1769, the Company's monopoly ended with the scrapping of the company itself, {{under the influence of the}} physiocrats.|$|R
5000|$|The best-known <b>triangular</b> <b>trading</b> {{system is}} the transatlantic slave trade, that {{operated}} from the late 16th to early 19th centuries, carrying slaves, cash crops, and manufactured goods between West Africa, Caribbean or American colonies and the European colonial powers, with the northern colonies of British North America, especially New England, sometimes taking {{over the role of}} Europe. The use of African slaves was fundamental to growing colonial cash crops, which were exported to Europe. European goods, in turn, were used to purchase African slaves, who were then brought on the sea lane west from Africa to the Americas, the so-called Middle Passage. A classic example is the colonial molasses trade. Sugar (often in its liquid form, molasses) from the Caribbean was traded to Europe or New England, where it was distilled into rum. The profits from the sale of sugar were used to purchase manufactured goods, which were then shipped to West Africa, where they were bartered for slaves. The slaves were then brought back to the Caribbean to be sold to sugar planters. The profits from the sale of the slaves were then used to buy more sugar, which was shipped to Europe, restarting the cycle. The trip itself took five to twelve weeks.The first leg of the triangle was from a European port to Africa, in which ships carried supplies for sale and trade, such as copper, cloth, trinkets, slave beads, guns and ammunition. [...] When the ship arrived, its cargo would be sold or bartered for slaves. On the second leg, ships made the journey of the Middle Passage from Africa to the New World. Many slaves died of disease in the crowded holds of the slave ships. Once the ship reached the New World, enslaved survivors were sold in the Caribbean or the American colonies. The ships were then prepared to get them thoroughly cleaned, drained, and loaded with export goods for a return voyage, the third leg, to their home port, from the West Indies the main export cargoes were sugar, rum, and molasses; from Virginia, tobacco and hemp. The ship then returned to Europe to complete the triangle.|$|R

[...] The brothers also owned the Hare, a ship whose participation in the American slave trade is well documented. [...] Incredible profits were made by purchasing slaves in Africa with rum from the colonies, selling those slaves in the West Indies, using those profits to purchase molasses from those ports before buying more rum in the colonies, continuing the <b>triangular</b> cycle of <b>trade.</b>|$|R
