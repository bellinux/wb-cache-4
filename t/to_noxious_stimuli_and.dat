40|$|Pain is an {{unpleasant}} sensation experienced when tis-sues are damaged. Thus, pain sensation {{in some way}} protects body from imminent threat or injury. Periph-eral sensory nerves innervated to peripheral tissues initially respond to multiple forms of <b>noxious</b> or strong <b>stimuli,</b> such as heat, mechanical <b>and</b> chemical <b>stimuli.</b> In response to these stimuli, electrical signals for con-ducting the nociceptive neural signals through axons are generated. These action potentials are then con-veyed to specific areas in the spinal cord and in the brain. Sensory afferent fibers are heterogeneous in many aspects. For example, sensory nerves are classi-fied as Aα,-β,-δ and C-fibers according to their di-ameter and degree of myelination. It is widely ac-cepted that small sensory fibers tend to respond <b>to</b> vigorous or <b>noxious</b> <b>stimuli</b> <b>and</b> related <b>to</b> nociception. Thus these fibers are specifically called nociceptors. Most of nociceptors respond <b>to</b> <b>noxious</b> mechanical <b>stimuli</b> <b>and</b> heat. In addition, these sensory fibers also respond to chemical stimuli [Davis et al. (1993) ] such as capsaicin. Thus, nociceptors are considered poly-modal. Recent advance in research on ion channels in sensory neurons reveals molecular mechanisms under-lying how various types of stimuli can be transduced to neural signals transmitted to the brain for pain per-ception. In particular, electrophysiological studies on ion channels characterize biophysical properties of ion channels in sensory neurons. Furthermore, molecular biology leads to identification of genetic structures as well as molecular properties of ion channels in sensory neurons. These ion channels are expressed in axon terminals {{as well as in}} cell soma. When these channels are activated, inward currents or outward currents are generated, which will lead to depolarization or hyper-polarization of the membrane causing increased or decreased excitability of sensory neurons.

The present experiment {{examined the effects of}} ethnicity (African American vs. white) on experimental pain tolerance and adjustment to chronic pain. Methods: Three hundred thirty-seven (68 African American and 269 white) patients with chronic pain referred to a multidisciplinary treatment center participated in the study. In addition to completing a number of standardized questionnaires assessing adjustment to chronic pain, participants underwent a submaximal effort tourniquet procedure. This experimental pain procedure yields a measure of tolerance for a controlled <b>noxious</b> <b>stimulus</b> (ie, arm ischemia). Results: African American subjects reported higher levels of clinical pain as well as greater pain-related disability than white participants. In addition, substantial group differences were observed for ischemic pain tolerance, with African Americans demonstrating less tolerance than whites.

40|$|Somatostatin (SOM) is {{a widely}} {{distributed}} peptide in {{the central nervous system}} and exerts a variety of hormonal and neural actions. Although SOM is assumed {{to play an important role}} in spinal nociceptive processing, its exact function remains unclear. In fact, earlier pharmacological studies have provided results that support either a facilitatory or inhibitory role for SOM in nociception. In the current study, the effects of SOM were investigated using anesthetized cats. Specifically, the responses of rostrally projecting spinal dorsal horn neurons (RPSDH neurons) to different kinds of <b>noxious</b> <b>stimuli</b> (i. e., heat, mechanical <b>and</b> cold <b>stimuli)</b> <b>and</b> to the Aδ-and C-fiber activation of the sciatic nerve were studied.

40|$|Opioids are an {{extremely}} important part of medical practice, and for thousands of years, continued to provide relief from severe acute and chronic pain.

40|$|The lateral {{habenula}} (LHb) is a brain {{structure that}} participates in cognitive and emotional processing {{and has been}} implicated in several mental disorders.

In vivo, both LPO-glutamatergic and LPO-GABAergic inputs to the LHb are activated by aversive stimuli, and their predictive cues yet produce opposing behaviors when stimulated independently. These results support a model wherein the balanced response of converging LPO-glutamate and LPO-GABA are necessary for a normal response <b>to</b> <b>noxious</b> <b>stimuli,</b> <b>and</b> an imbalance in LPO→LHb glutamate or GABA results in the type of aberrant processing that may underlie mental disorders...|$|E

40|$|SummaryBackgroundHeightened {{nociceptive}} (pain) sensitivity is {{an adaptive}} response to tissue damage and serves {{to protect the}} site of injury. Multiple mediators of nociceptive sensitization {{have been identified in}} vertebrates, but the complexity of the vertebrate nervous system and tissue-repair responses has hindered identification of the precise roles of these factors. ResultsHere we establish a new model of nociceptive sensitization in Drosophila larvae, in which UV-induced tissue damage alters an aversive withdrawal behavior. We find that UV-treated larvae develop both thermal hyperalgesia, manifested as an exaggerated response <b>to</b> <b>noxious</b> thermal <b>stimuli,</b> <b>and</b> thermal allodynia, a responsiveness to subthreshold thermal stimuli that are not normally perceived as noxious. Allodynia is dependent upon a tumor necrosis factor (TNF) homolog, Eiger, released from apoptotic epidermal cells, and the TNF receptor, Wengen, expressed on nociceptive sensory neurons. ConclusionsThese results demonstrate that cytokine-mediated nociceptive sensitization is conserved across animal phyla and {{set the stage for a}} sophisticated genetic dissection of the cellular and molecular alterations responsible for development of nociceptive sensitization in sensory neurons...|$|R
40|$|Whether {{invertebrates}} {{are able}} {{or not to}} experience pain is a highly controversial issue.

The principle of argument-by-analogy can be then applied to these data: the behaviour displayed by invertebrates is {{compared with that of}} "higher" animals, its similarity denoting the former's capacity to have analogous experiences. Here, the author discusses some examples, extracted from the literature on crustacean decapods, that pinpoint their nature of "sentient" animals. This review, however, also shows that research is still scanty in the field. The studies that examine the potential links between stress responses and pain experience are few, and the several papers that help elucidate cognitive abilities in decapods have been limited to a few taxa and are not specifically directed to the question of "sentience".

Here we demonstrate that rats exposed to Lipopolysaccharide (LPS; 0. 05 mg/kg IP, Salmonella enteritidis) during postnatal day (PND) 3 and 5 displayed enhanced formalin-induced flinching but not licking following formalin injection at PND 22. This LPS-induced hyperalgesia was accompanied by distinct recruitment of supra-spinal regions involved in analgesia as indicated by significantly attenuated Fos-protein induction in the rostral dorsal periaqueductal grey (DPAG) as well as rostral and caudal axes of the ventrolateral PAG (VLPAG). Formalin injections were associated with increased Fos-protein labelling in lateral habenula (LHb) as compared to medial habenula (MHb), however the intensity of this labelling did not differ as a result of neonatal immune challenge.

The genetic bases of CIPA have remained long unknown. A few years ago, point mutations affecting both coding and noncoding regions of the neurotrophic tyrosine receptor kinase type 1 (NTRK 1) /nerve growth factor receptor gene have been detected in CIPA patients, demonstrating the implication of the nerve growth factor/ NTRK 1 pathway in the pathogenesis of the disease. We have previously shown that two CIPA mutations, the G 571 R and the R 774 P, inactivate the NTRK 1 receptor by interfering with the autophosphorylation process. We have extended our functional analysis to seven additional NTRK 1 mutations associated with CIPA recently reported by others. Through a combination of biochemical and biological assays, we have identified polymorphisms and pathogenic mutations.

In all paradigms, NAC was either equally or more effective than the other compounds examined. In light of the long history of therapeutic application of NAC, we suggest that use of this compound may be of interest in conditions where certain toxin-mediated forms of cell death and/or apoptosis contribute significantly to disease...|$|E

40|$|Prior {{work has}} shown that a high dose (20 [*]mg/kg) of {{systemic}} morphine, required to produce significant analgesia in the acute phase of a contusion injury, undermines the long-term health of treated subjects and increases lesion size. Moreover, a single dose of systemic morphine in the early stage of injury (24 [*]h post-injury) led to symptoms of neuropathic pain 3 weeks later, in the chronic phase. The present study examines the locus of the effects using intrathecal morphine administration. Subjects were treated with one of three doses (0, 30, or 90 [*]μg) of intrathecal morphine 24 [*]h after a moderate contusion injury. The 90 -μg dose produced significant analgesia when subjects were exposed <b>to</b> <b>noxious</b> <b>stimuli</b> (thermal <b>and</b> incremented shock) {{below the level of}} injury. Yet, despite analgesic efficacy, intrathecal morphine significantly attenuated the recovery of locomotor function and increased lesion size rostral to the injury site. A single dose of 30 or 90 [*]μg of intrathecal morphine also decreased weight gain, and more than doubled the incidence of mortality and autophagia when compared to vehicle-treated controls. Morphine {{is one of the most}} effective pharmacological agents for the treatment of neuropathic pain and, therefore, is indispensable for the spinally injured. Treatment can, however, adversely affect the recovery process. A morphine-induced attenuation of recovery may result from increases in immune cell activation and, subsequently, pro-inflammatory cytokine concentrations in the contused spinal cord...|$|R
