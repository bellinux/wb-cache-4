50|$|A first {{generation}} of hybrid grass appeared in the 1990s. Grass roots were allowed to intertwine {{with a mix of}} sand and synthetic fibres as they grew. Three main methods exist to insert synthetic fibres in the root zone. The first is to inject fibres in the sand with a <b>tufting</b> <b>machine.</b> This is the method used to create Desso GrassMaster. The industry-leading hybrid grass system has been rebranded as GrassMaster by Tarkett Sports.|$|E
40|$|Document code：B Abstract: Based on the {{analysis}} on the control requirements of artificial grass <b>tufting</b> <b>machine,</b> this thesis proposes an overall plan on control of CANopen bus. In the control system, {{on the basis of}} CoDeSys softPLC technology of fieldbus control system, LMC 20 enables the communication by making CANopen bus connect with ATV 71, OTB module and these underlying slave stations. The humanized operation interface realized by touch screens and user-friendly application which is developed through CoDeSys have been put into operation in factory. All of those implement the functions of signal acquisition and display, protection, control, etc...|$|E
40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy at Loughborough University. The presented work represents {{a continuation of the}} investigations into the possible application of miniature hydraulic actuation and control techniques to high speed reciprocating mechanisms in manipulative machinery. Earlier research in this area led to the design of knitting, sewing and <b>tufting</b> <b>machines</b> which employed actuators and rotary valves developed with the aim of exploiting some of the advantages that hydraulic mechanisms have over their mechanical equivalents.

50|$|Since the 18th century, {{the people}} from Genemuiden have been {{producing}} floor mats made of the bulrush that grows {{on the shores of}} the Zuiderzee. When the quality of the bulrush deteriorated in the 20th century, due to the change from salt water to fresh water (see Zuiderzee), the industry switched over to using coir imported from India to produce mats and carpets. In the sixties the first <b>tufting</b> <b>machines</b> were imported and currently Genemuiden is one of Europe's main production centres of tufted carpet and artificial grass.|$|R
30|$|Weaving and, to {{a lesser}} extent, {{knitting}} processes, produce waste that cannot easily be recycled. A common type of waste is selvedge, which is the semi-finished edge that is produced to stop the fabric from unravelling or fraying. The production of scarves produces long lengths of this material. Following a chance meeting, Johnsons of Elgin supplied samples of its scarf selvage to Turnberry Rug Works which, after some development work on the <b>tufting</b> <b>machines,</b> found {{it was able to}} use the selvage to manufacture rugs. Producing a rug using virgin cashmere would be a very expensive proposition; however, by using selvage, a luxurious product can be produced using material that would otherwise have been sold as waste. The rugs are currently in production and sold under the Ecochic brand.|$|R
40|$|Abstract：Recently, the {{tufted carpet}} pattern {{are getting more}} and more complex. However {{jacquard}} machine equipment is relatively backward and it has low degree of automation, which has caused a lot of labor and low efficiency. To solve these problems, the pattern forming principle of the <b>tufting</b> jacquard <b>machine</b> was studied and the design of automatic control system was put forward. So an embedded electronic jacquard machine controller based on ARM 7 was developed...|$|R
