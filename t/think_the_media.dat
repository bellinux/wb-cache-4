Everybody is so angry now." [...] Sublette speculated about the song's reception: [...] "Willie's smart. We talked about recording it in the '90s but we needed some kind of context.

He resigned a few weeks into the 2003 NFL season after making comments about the press coverage for quarterback Donovan McNabb that caused controversy and accusations of racism {{on the part of}} Limbaugh. His comment about McNabb was: [...] "I don't think he's been that good from the get-go. I think what we've had here is a little social concern in the NFL. I <b>think</b> <b>the</b> <b>media</b> has been very desirous that a black quarterback do well. They're interested in black coaches and black quarterbacks doing well.

[...] A sportswriter construed the comment as racist against himself and other sportswriters.

5000|$|Personally I liked The Lunch Box very much. But {{eventually}} the eighteen member jury supported The Good Road. Now I {{can say that}} some people from Bombay felt that the basic premise of The Lunch Box was wrong. Because the Dubbawalas never do such mistakes. Films are after all works of fiction, {{with the right to}} cinematic liberty! Although Lunch Box was my personal favourite, but as a chairman one should not impose his or her choice on others. And as you know this became suddenly a big controversy. And I <b>think</b> <b>the</b> <b>media</b> was again to some extent responsible for this decision. Because every day during the deliberation or the screenings, the media projected Lunch Box as the chosen one. It's my assumption, that the members probably thought, [...] "My God! If the media has already taken the decision then why we are here?" [...] It was a Chomskian 'manufacturing consent' - Lunch Box, Lunch Box, Lunch Box every day!! So the members, who are all very important people from the industry, had an opposite impulse. I don't know, but maybe that's the way it happened.|$|E

It has been both, but {{to concentrate on the}} bad instead of learning from the bad and repairing the bad and then looking to the good that is still out in front of us within our reach— We have a choice today. We can either let those scars crush us or redeem us. We must extend to those we disagree with— But, you are honest and have integrity! There were people on stage that not only took a great personal risk but also, one in particular, organized for our president - lead a prayer breakfast - is a Democrat. You <b>think</b> <b>the</b> <b>media</b> would tell you that [...] "This was only a bunch of tea partiers." [...] No, that person stood on the ... stage because of honor. And there is a lot we can disagree on but our values and our principles can unite us. We must discover them again. Recognize your place to the creator. Realize that he is our king. He is the one who guides and directs our life and protects us. I ask, not only if you would pray on your knees, but pray on your knees but with your door open for your children to see.|$|E

5000|$|After James Curley {{sold the}} paper to G. Bowie McCeney, McCeney served as editor for six months before {{appointing}} Gertrude Poe editor in 1939.

[...] "He McCeney hands me a copy the Leader with a grin and says, My career as an editor just ended. Yours is just beginning." [...] Poe served as the Leaders editor until 1980, while McCeney remained the papers publisher until 1978. In 1946 the papers name was changed to The News Leader, after merging with the Bowie Register and The College Park News, two other papers owned by McCeney. From 1939 until the late 1950s, the Leader was a [...] "one woman show," [...] with Poe serving as advertising salesperson, graphic designer, copywriter, proofreader, and distributor as well as editor. Under Poes leadership {{the focus of the}} paper shifted from national to local news, and increasingly catered to the local military population based at nearby Fort Meade.
