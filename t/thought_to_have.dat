5|$|Heterodontosaurus is the eponymous {{and best}} known {{member of the}} family Heterodontosauridae. This family is {{considered}} one of the most primitive or basal groups within the order of ornithischian dinosaurs. In spite of the large tusks, Heterodontosaurus is <b>thought</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> been herbivorous, or at least omnivorous. Though it was formerly <b>thought</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> been capable of quadrupedal locomotion, it is now <b>thought</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> been bipedal. Tooth replacement was sporadic and not continuous, unlike its relatives. At least four other heterodontosaurid genera are known from the same geological formations as Heterodontosaurus.|$|E
5|$|Leeds is <b>thought</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> {{been the}} site of the Roman town of Cambodunum, {{abandoned}} when the Romans left Britain in around 400AD. The first church in Leeds is <b>thought</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> been built around 600AD.|$|E
5|$|With its low-crowned teeth, Ferugliotherium {{may have}} been an {{insectivore}} or omnivore, like similar multituberculates such as Mesodma, which is <b>thought</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> eaten insects, other arthropods, seeds, and/or nuts. The wear on Ferugliotherium teeth suggests that the animal may have eaten some plant material. The high-crowned sudamericids are <b>thought</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> been herbivores feeding on abrasive vegetation, although their precise diet is not known. In the evolutionary history of gondwanatheres, hypsodont teeth are <b>thought</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> evolved from brachydont precursors. Gurovich hypothesizes that the anterior molariforms of sudamericids may have evolved from bladelike premolars as seen in Ferugliotherium.|$|E

50|$|Oncorhynchus kawamurae, {{the black}} kokanee, or kunimasu (国鱒 or クニマス) in Japanese, is a Japanese species of salmon which was <b>thought</b> <b>to</b> <b>had</b> gone extinct in 1940, but was {{discovered}} <b>to</b> still <b>have</b> a living population in 2010.|$|R
5|$|Although Mirza, Microcebus, and Allocebus form a clade within Cheirogaleidae, {{the three}} {{lineages}} are <b>thought</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> diverged during a narrow window of time, so the relationships within this clade {{are difficult to}} determine and may change with further research. All three are <b>thought</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> diverged at least 20mya (million years ago), although another estimate using mtDNA places the divergence between Mirza and Microcebus at 24.2mya. Divergence between the two recognized species of giant mouse lemur is estimated at 2.1mya.|$|E

5|$|Comets can loosely {{be divided}} into two categories: short-period and long-period—the latter being thought to {{originate}} in the Oort cloud. The two major categories of short-period comets are Jupiter-family comets (JFCs) and Halley-type comets. Halley-type comets, which are named after their prototype, Halley's Comet, are <b>thought</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> originated in the Oort cloud but to have been drawn into the inner Solar System by the gravity of the giant planets, whereas the JFCs are <b>thought</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> originated in the scattered disc. The centaurs are thought to be a dynamically intermediate stage between the scattered disc and the Jupiter family.|$|E

5|$|In {{the late}} 620s or early 630s, Cadwallon ap Cadfan, the British (Welsh) king of Gwynedd, became {{involved}} in a war with Edwin of Northumbria, the most powerful king in Britain at the time. Cadwallon apparently was initially unsuccessful, but he joined with Penda, who is <b>thought</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> been the lesser partner in their alliance, to defeat the Northumbrians in October 633 at the Battle of Hatfield Chase. Penda was probably not yet king of the Mercians, but he is <b>thought</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> become king soon afterwards, based on Bede's characterisation of his position. Edwin {{was killed in the}} battle, and one of his sons, Eadfrith, fell into Penda's hands.|$|E
