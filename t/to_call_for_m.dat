5000|$|On November 13, 2010, {{in a long}} New York Times {{article about}} Shuler, Campbell Robertson noted his use of a {{football}} analogy to describe the current situation of Congressional Democrats: “It’s no different than me as a quarterback,” he said. “I didn’t play very good. So what they’d do? They benched me.” Robertson noted that “Shuler has {{emerged as one of}} most prominent voices in the debate on the Democratic Party’s immediate future. He was among the first <b>to</b> <b>call</b> <b>for</b> <b>Ms.</b> Pelosi <b>to</b> step down from her leadership role in the new Congress and said he would run for minority leader himself if no alternative emerged (though he admitted that he would be an underdog).” According to Robertson, Shuler felt the Democratic leadership “has been too reflexively partisan” and <b>called</b> <b>for</b> “a more moderate approach.” ...|$|R

5000|$|His initial silence, {{and then}} self-contradictory public {{statements}} {{on the matter}} that were widely seen as deceptive, led <b>to</b> <b>calls</b> <b>for</b> his resignation. <b>Ming</b> Pao said that Chan must restore public confidence in him by [...] "coming up with some convincing evidence {{that he has no}} intention to deceive the public". The convenor of the Executive Council also questioned Chan's credibility and the impact of the unfolding scandal on the credibility of the government. Chan gave a pledge {{that he and his wife}} would not make further investments in the property market, and would divest their shares in Harvest Charm Development, the company at the centre of the controversy.|$|R
40|$|GRAVITAS is an X-ray observatory, {{designed}} and optimised {{to address the}} ESA Cosmic Vision theme of "Matter under extreme conditions". It was submitted as a response <b>to</b> the <b>call</b> <b>for</b> <b>M</b> 3 mission proposals. The concept centres around an X-ray telescope of unprecedented effective area, which will focus radiation emitted from close to the event horizon of black holes or the surface of neutron stars. To reveal the nature and behaviour of matter in the most extreme astrophysical environments, GRAVITAS targets a key feature in the X-ray spectra of compact objects: the iron Kalpha line at ~ 6. 5 keV. The energy, profile, and variability of this emission line, and {{the properties of the}} surrounding continuum emission, shaped by General Relativity (GR) effects, provide a unique probe of gravity in its strong field limit. Among its prime targets are hundreds of supermassive black holes in bright Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN), which form the perfect laboratory to help understand the physical processes behind black hole growth. Accretion plays a fundamental role in the shaping of galaxies throughout cosmic time, via the process of feedback. Modest (~sub-arcmin) spatial resolution would deliver the necessary sensitivity to extend high quality X-ray spectroscopy of AGN to cosmologically-relevant distances. Closer to home, ultra-high count rate capabilities and sub-millisecond time resolution enable the study of GR effects and the equation of state of dense matter in the brightest X-ray binaries in our own Galaxy, using multiple probes, such as the broad iron line, the shape of the disk continuum emission, quasi-periodic oscillations, reverberation mapping, and X-ray burst oscillations. Despite its breakthrough capabilities, all enabling technologies for GRAVITAS are already in a high state of readiness. It is based on ultra light-weight X-ray optics and a focal plane detector using silicon technology. Comment: Accepted for publication in Experimental Astronomy, 16 pages, 10 figure...|$|R
