Kevin Murphy wrote, [...] "Tinderbox romps and swoons {{with all the}} majesty of Dreamhouse", and added, [...] "it's a refreshing slant on the Banshees' disturbing perspective and restores their vivid shades to pop's pale palette." [...] Jon Savage also hailed the record in Spin magazine: [...] "Its scope, ease, and assurance make it a good collection for the Banshees to relaunch themselves into the international market this spring.

2500|$|Associate Professor of English at the University of Wisconsin-Stevens Point G. Christopher Williams {{discussed}} {{the relationship between}} GLaDOS and Chell. In response to a quote by designer Erik Wolpaw that read [...] "we wanted you to have this very intimate connection with this AI that changes and evolves over time, leading up to <b>the</b> <b>point</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> betray her and do the most intimate act {{you can do with}} someone—murdering them in cold blood", he at first noted that [...] "on the face of it, this description of intimacy seems nonsensical", but also noted that [...] "a changing and evolving relationship with someone in authority over you that eventually leads to betraying them by violating their rules—is one that is an altogether familiar one". He used the parent-child relationship as an example of this and cited a metaphor by psychologist Sigmund Freud which Williams said was about [...] "murdering a parent in an effort to describe how children eventually would attempt to get out from under the wing of their parents". He wrote [...] "nothing can be as intimate, perhaps, as loving someone enough to follow their rules and then needing to “kill them” in order to escape that “game,” which makes this game feel like something more like a really familiar relationship". He called her [...] "just one of many countless authorities that have explained to me the rules of a game, how to control myself, and then pushed me towards a particular goal of the computer’s design" [...] and that [...] "this is an experience that I have every time that I fire up my Xbox and describes the curiously intimate relationship between player and gaming system that emerges in single player gameplay". He further discussed that he had no idea that Chell's name was Chell or that she was a female because he recognized the character as himself. He wrote [...] "I cared about GlaDOS only because she was the one directing me. Oh, and then I really cared about her because she wanted to kill me".|$|E
6000|$|She {{had listened}} to this only staring, and she was silent after he had said it, so silent for some instants that while he {{considered}} her something seemed to fail him, much {{as if he had}} thrown out his foot for a step and not found the place to rest it. He jerked round to the window again, and then she answered, but without passion unless it was that of her weariness for something stupid and forgiven in him, [...] "Oh, the blind, the pitiful folly!"--to which, as it might perfectly have applied to her own behaviour, he returned nothing. She had moreover at once gone on. [...] "Have it then that there wasn't much to do--between your finding that you loathed me for another woman or discovering only, when it came to <b>the</b> <b>point,</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> loathed me quite enough for myself." ...|$|E
50|$|Castle <b>Points</b> = are <b>the</b> <b>points</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> obtain by {{constructing}} Royal Buildings. Increasing its number {{helps you}} open new land for your kingdom.|$|R
50|$|Alliance <b>Points</b> = are <b>the</b> <b>points</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> gain {{every time}} you do any action on your neighbors' kingdoms to create alliances. This helps unlock new {{buildings}} and items.|$|R
60|$|I {{am quite}} at ease on <b>the</b> <b>points</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> have {{expressed}} yourself as not at ease upon. Quite. I cannot too often {{say that if}} they were carried on weak shoulders they would break the bearer down. But in your mastering of them lies the mastery over the reader.|$|R
5000|$|... 3 = Mildly upset. Worried, {{bothered to}} <b>the</b> <b>point</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> notice it.|$|E
5000|$|... 6 = Feeling bad to <b>the</b> <b>point</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> {{begin to}} think {{something}} {{ought to be done}} about the way you feel.|$|E
5000|$|... 4 = Somewhat upset to <b>the</b> <b>point</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> cannot easily ignore an {{unpleasant}} thought. You {{can handle it}} OK but don't feel good.|$|E
6000|$|... "I am afraid, O'Grady, {{that just}} at present you are {{scarcely}} qualified to take {{command of the}} army; except only on <b>the</b> one <b>point,</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> thoroughly distrust <b>the</b> Spaniards.|$|R

6000|$|The {{sergeant}} {{grew more}} terrible than ever. [...] "That is not <b>the</b> <b>point.</b> <b>The</b> <b>point</b> is <b>that</b> <b>you</b> are committing {{what amounts to}} a theft, and there's the gaol for thieves." ...|$|R
5000|$|Penn {{often made}} <b>the</b> <b>point</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> can {{break the rules}} of an {{organization}} you do not belong to. Non-freemason members {{are not allowed to}} wear the Mason ring according to the Masonic rules, but these rules do not apply to non-Masons so they can wear the ring anyway.|$|E
5000|$|Songwriter Vincent Giarrusso {{said the}} band wanted the album to be {{markedly}} different from its predecessor. [...] "Leaves Me Blind had a desperate feel to it," [...] he said. [...] "With this new album {{we wanted to}} make <b>the</b> <b>point</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> can be subversive and confronting by softer means—that's even more powerful than being smacked over the head with drum rolls and guitars going the whole time." ...|$|E
5000|$|The Spectrum port {{received}} {{a much less}} positive reception. Reviews were at best mixed. All reviews criticise the 'awful' graphics and sound. Your Sinclair awarded the game 3/10 with the author claiming {{he had given up}} on the game in frustration. Sinclair User found the game similarly 'unfair' with 'unspeakably bad' graphics but said it had some 'neat twists' awarding an overall score of 2/5. ZX Computing was more positive, giving a rating of 'good'. Although acknowledging the 'dreadful' presentation and 'unplayable' key sequence, the reviewer claimed the game [...] "proves <b>the</b> <b>point</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> don't have to have great graphics for it to be addictive".|$|E
60|$|CHARTERIS (politely). I {{beg your}} pardon, my dear. I know I have {{a habit of}} repeating myself. <b>The</b> <b>point</b> is <b>that</b> <b>you</b> {{reserved}} your freedom to give me up when you pleased.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, if she didn't say it, let's forget her. Doesn't {{make any}} {{difference}} who said it, anyway. <b>The</b> <b>point</b> is <b>that</b> <b>you</b> believe it. God! To think you don't understand me any better than that! Money!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I think <b>that</b> <b>you</b> {{have been}} cruelly wronged," [...] Edgar answered, quietly, [...] "and <b>that</b> <b>the</b> four <b>points</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> demand are just and right. I wish you good fortune in obtaining them, and I trust {{that it will}} be done peacefully and without opposition." ...|$|R
5000|$|The shark costume {{was one of}} two prank {{additions}} to the sculpture performed by local artist Eric Hardtke, himself a sculptor who works in bronze and stone, and accomplices. The first was a 2009 addition next to the statue of a wave crashing down over the Kook, carrying a wire mesh outline of another surfer about to knock the Kook off his board. This wave still exists, since it was removed undamaged by city employees, and is stored at the ranch of Paul Ecke, a local grower of poinsettias. It is constructed of wood, paper, and chicken wire, and Hardtke stated that [...] "It was to make <b>the</b> <b>point</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> could make a better sculpture for less money.".|$|E
5000|$|Driving {{research}} into Non-Cooperative Target Recognition (NCTR) is the fratricide problem, which, according to Army Maj. Bill McKean, is that [...] "... our weapons can kill at a greater range {{than we can}} identify a target as friend or foe. Yet if you wait until you're close enough {{to be sure you}} are firing at an enemy, you've lost your advantage." [...] The procedural approach of more restrictive rules of engagement (ROE), according to McKean, [...] "What they found was, if you tighten the rules of engagement to <b>the</b> <b>point</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> reduce fratricide, the enemy begins inflicting greater casualties on you. [...] "Waiting until you're sure in combat could mean becoming a casualty yourself.". Technical approaches to fratricide prevention include: ...|$|E
5000|$|TouchArcade {{gave the}} game {{a rating of}} 3 out of 5 stars, writing, [...] "If you're looking for {{something}} that takes {{the mechanics of the}} original game and builds on them, this prequel has very little to offer you. On the other hand, if you're extremely interested in its story and world to <b>the</b> <b>point</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> would gladly play it again to get a few more details filled in, or you want some kind of pretense to run through the RPG portion of the game again at a much higher difficulty level, spend your dollar without guilt or worry. It might not be the follow-up to A Dark Room you would like, but it's highly likely nothing could be." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No," [...] and Jefferson smiled grimly, [...] "I don't quite {{think it}} does. <b>The</b> <b>point</b> is <b>that</b> <b>you</b> feel {{yourself}} responsible to them, though I don't {{see why you}} should. A man has to take his chances when he makes a bargain of the kind they did." ...|$|R
2500|$|... "According to the {{explicit}} decree of Bahá'u'lláh one must not turn {{aside from the}} advice of a competent doctor. It is imperative to consult one even if the patient himself be a well-known and eminent physician. In short, <b>the</b> <b>point</b> is <b>that</b> <b>you</b> should maintain your health by consulting a highly skilled physician." ...|$|R

50|$|He, once again, makes <b>the</b> <b>point</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> {{can compare}} these beings with a key, which they {{represent}} themselves, whereas nature is the lock. Professor Richard Dawkins then explains that a key has {{to fit a}} lock exactly, and demonstrates this with {{a model of a}} lock. He mentions that a key is something very improbable. However it is hard to measure the probability of such a key, therefore Dawkins takes a bicycle lock for illustration, where you can calculate how likely it is to open the lock, because there is a fixed number of dials with a fixed number of positions. In Dawkin's case we have 3 dials, with 6 positions each, so the probability that you open the lock by sheer luck is one to two hundred and sixteen.|$|E
5000|$|The {{album was}} well {{received}} by critics. Sounds praised the album on its release. Kevin Murphy wrote, [...] "Tinderbox romps and swoons {{with all the}} majesty of Dreamhouse", and added, [...] "it's a refreshing slant on the Banshees' disturbing perspective and restores their vivid shades to pop's pale palette." [...] Jon Savage also hailed the record in Spin magazine: [...] "Its scope, ease, and assurance make it a good collection for the Banshees to relaunch themselves into the international market this spring. Carruthers fits in to <b>the</b> <b>point</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> wouldn't {{know there was a}} change, and Budgie's drumming is superb. Apart from the singles [...] "Cities in Dust" [...] and [...] "Candyman" [...] (which perpetuates the Banshees' sinister view of childhood), the sparks fly on the crystal clear [...] "Cannons" [...] and the unsettling [...] "Parties Fall".|$|E
5000|$|Ian Cuthbertson from The Australian {{said that}} season two is [...] "still centred on four women, defined as losers at school, who win a motza on Oz Lotto". He called it [...] "soap as usual" [...] and {{questioned}} why something [...] "interesting" [...] {{was not done}} with their winnings, such a living abroad. While Debi Enker of The Age said that the biggest problem in the series was the [...] "relentlessly ham-fisted style". They fail to be subtle because [...] "every potential issue" [...] is predictable and [...] "everything is restated to <b>the</b> <b>point</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> want to scream at the screen". Enker added that they had [...] "tweaked" [...] characters and added [...] "new elements" [...] for season two, but it still lacked confidence. She concluded that Winners & Losers needed to remove the soap-style close-ups and [...] "tone down the caricatured aspects of its characters".|$|E
6000|$|... "Think of Ralph Kenzie and of {{what his}} life must be if you should die. Think of those {{children}} who will come, and of that first kiss of love found again which you must miss in death, whatever else it may have to give. Think of <b>the</b> knife's <b>point</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> would change for it, or the last sick rush down a mountain height of space. Think of your husband. Hark! I hear him calling you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I can't love {{order as}} much as I honour it. Set tastes aside. <b>The</b> <b>point</b> is, <b>that</b> if <b>you</b> are to hold together, Leonard, it must be by bearing and forbearing, and above all, to your elder brother.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, why not? Anyway, <b>the</b> <b>point</b> is <b>that</b> <b>you</b> have to {{work from}} the inside, with what we have, {{rather than from the}} outside, with foreign ideas. The shell ought not to be forced on the spirit. It can't be! The bright shell has to grow out of the spirit, and express it. That means waiting. If we keep after the city council for another ten years they MAY vote the bonds for a new school." ...|$|R
5000|$|Unexpected Cena {{videos were}} first {{uploaded}} to sites like YouTube, Vine and Twitter and became popular around {{the summer of}} 2015, but what started it was a video called [...] "John Cena Prank Call". leading to coverage of the meme in publications such as Sports Illustrated and Uproxx. Several comedy websites made lists about Unexpected Cena, such as an article published on the Smosh official site listing the twenty-two best videos of the meme and Dorkly's [...] "15 Reasons Why John Cena Became The Internet's Perfect Meme". The meme was very well-received from journalists, including one who wrote: [...] "the Internet knows how to preserve a joke's sanctity by not overexposing it to <b>the</b> <b>point</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> want to shoot yourself in the face". A video by the Fine Brothers showing several YouTube personalities reacting to clips of the meme was done {{as part of their}} YouTubers React series.|$|E
50|$|The Great Change - A black {{supremacist}} and extremist in Haiti {{creates a}} bomb with magic {{and nuclear power}} gathered from an African country. He calls it the Peace Bomb because the radioactivity will mutate everyone to look the same and have the same skin and therefore {{there would be no}} diversity and that also means no racism. He wants to use it, but it can easily be traced back to him through investigations. He uses trickery and makes the leaders of the world turn on each other, causing a total nuclear World War. He drops the Peace Bomb, {{but at the same time}} several other nuclear bombs have been dropped. The whole world starts to turn inside out. Forests pop out of nowhere, and then succeed. Children are born with magical powers, borders are smudged to <b>the</b> <b>point</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> walk out of your house in Texas and cross the street into Nigeria. Worlds are colliding.|$|E
5000|$|After “One,” and {{expressed}} most with “The Rising of the son,” Patrice coined a new genre for his music, termed “Sweggae.” He states, “I {{tried to find}} a common ground between all these things I love. Blues, Hip Hop, Dancehall, singer-songwriter music, Afro-Beat, Rock, philosophy, poetry, and the list is long. I didn't want it to sound like a mix but a style that in a very self explicatory way reflects these times that we're living in. Times in which it's getting hard to tell black from white. Times where cultures and genres are mixed to <b>the</b> <b>point</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> can't tell what's what anymore. I am a living symbol of these times. I am looking to create its soundtrack.” French newspaper, Le Monde, started using the genre [...] "sweggae" [...] and both they and Patrice describe it as music with reggae undertones with a more modernist take, reflective of someone who created his own culture out of many things.|$|E
500|$|Following {{the success}} of Bommarillu, Genelia {{played the role of}} the {{daughter}} of a local don, in the Tamil gangster film Chennai Kadhal alongside Boys co-star Bharath. Rediff.com criticized her commenting, [...] "Genelia stands up yet again to prove <b>the</b> <b>point</b> <b>that</b> if <b>you</b> are pretty and well dressed, {{you can get away with}} anything, without acting." [...] Shortly afterwards in 2007, Genelia played the role of sister of a notorious gangster in the blockbuster Telugu movie Dhee, set against a gang war backdrop.|$|R
6000|$|Anacreon {{talks to}} <b>the</b> <b>point</b> so well <b>that</b> <b>you</b> must forgive him, I think, for being Anacreontic, and take {{from his hands}} what is not defiled. The {{translation}} you send me does not 'smell of Anacreon,' nor please me. Where did you get it? Would this be at all fresher? ...|$|R
60|$|What's {{the use of}} {{thinking}} you can stop people drinking merely by cutting off whiskey and brandy? The only effect is to drive them to taking lemon sour and sarsaparilla and cherry pectoral and caroka cordial and things they wouldn't have touched before. So {{in the long run}} they drink more than ever. <b>The</b> <b>point</b> is <b>that</b> <b>you</b> can't prevent people having a good time, no matter how hard you try. If they can't have it with lager beer and brandy, they'll have it with plain soda and lemon pop, and so the whole gloomy scheme of the temperance people breaks down, anyway.|$|R
