5|$|<b>The</b> <b>singers</b> are {{accompanied}} by an instrumental group consisting of oboe, bassoon, violin, two violas and basso continuo. As {{in the case of}} <b>the</b> <b>singers,</b> the question arises as to whether Bach used one or more players per part. The oboe and the violin are given some important solos, suggesting that there may well have been only one of each. Ton Koopman, for example, uses one oboist and one violinist in his recording. The role of the violas is more to provide accompaniment, filling in harmonies and sometimes doubling vocal lines. The bassoon sometimes supports the continuo section, doubling its bass line, and sometimes plays an independent line.|$|E

5|$|All I Want Is You was {{eventually}} released on November 30, 2010, selling poorly at first. With {{the help of}} its subsequent singles, the album became sleeper hit on the Billboard 200 and sold 404,000 copies by September 2012. It also received positive reviews; critics found some of the music inconsistent but praised Miguel's singing/songwriting abilities while drawing comparisons to American recording artist Prince. Miguel toured in promotion of the album as a supporting act for <b>the</b> <b>singers</b> Usher and Trey Songz.|$|E
5000|$|The {{music was}} written by The Decemberists and the lyrics by Colin Meloy. It tells a story of two star-crossed lovers. <b>The</b> <b>singer</b> {{falls in love with}} a person who belongs to an {{opposing}} gang. At the end of <b>the</b> song, <b>the</b> <b>singer's</b> lover jumps in to defend <b>the</b> <b>singer,</b> who is confronting his lover's brother (<b>the</b> <b>singer's</b> [...] "sworn enemy") and is killed by the bullet intended for <b>the</b> <b>singer.</b>|$|R
5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>singer</b> borrows his father's car to {{take his}} beloved {{sweetheart}} out on a romantic date (on a rainy night). Coming upon a stalled car in <b>the</b> road, <b>the</b> <b>singer</b> swerves to <b>the</b> right to avoid it, losing control and crashing violently in the process. The crash renders both <b>the</b> <b>singer</b> and his girlfriend unconscious. <b>The</b> <b>singer</b> later regains consciousness and finds several people {{at the scene of}} the accident, but was still able to find his girlfriend, still lying unconscious. When <b>the</b> <b>singer</b> cradles his girlfriend lovingly in his arms, she regains partial consciousness, smiling and asking <b>the</b> <b>singer</b> to [...] "hold me, darling, for a little while." [...] <b>The</b> <b>singer</b> then gives his sweetheart what would be their [...] "last romantic kiss" [...] as she fades into death and enters the afterlife.|$|R

The Marias also attended the première of the film You, Me and Dupree in Leicester Square.|$|E
5|$|Over decades, Manne {{recorded}} additional albums, {{or sometimes}} just {{sat in on}} drums here and there, with renowned vocalists like Ella Fitzgerald, Mel Tormé, Peggy Lee, Frank Sinatra, Ernestine Anderson, Sarah Vaughan, Lena Horne, Blossom Dearie, and Nancy Wilson. Not all <b>the</b> <b>singers</b> Manne accompanied were even primarily jazz artists. Performers as diverse as Teresa Brewer, Leontyne Price, Tom Waits, and Barry Manilow included Manne in their recording sessions.|$|E
5000|$|The song {{focuses on}} man's fascination with fast cars and {{beautiful}} women, and certain [...] "similarities" [...] between the two, {{which is a}} common theme in old blues and rock and roll recordings. The narrator and his girlfriend are out for a leisure drive (in <b>the</b> <b>singer's</b> Corvette) when they stop at a convenience store to purchase beer and cigarettes. As <b>the</b> <b>singer</b> pays for his merchandise, the store clerk, supposedly noticing <b>the</b> <b>singer's</b> Corvette parked outside, tells <b>the</b> <b>singer</b> how he had one just like it in 1963 but it was taken away from him by [...] "the man down at the bank" [...] (supposedly the loan officer who repossessed his car). In the second verse, <b>the</b> <b>singer</b> offers <b>the</b> clerk his keys and offers {{him a chance to}} [...] "take her for a spin," [...] thinking the clerk is talking about his car. Clarifying <b>the</b> <b>singer's</b> misinterpretation, <b>the</b> clerk informs <b>the</b> <b>singer</b> that it's not the car he is talking about, but <b>the</b> <b>singer's</b> girlfriend, who is waiting out in the car.|$|R
50|$|In all {{versions}} of the song, the lyrics are addressed to a bluebird by <b>the</b> <b>singer.</b> <b>The</b> <b>singer</b> is in Kentucky, and his/her sweetheart is vainly pursuing musical stardom in New Orleans. <b>The</b> <b>singer</b> asks <b>the</b> bluebird to take a message to Martha/Michael, asking for the sweetheart to return.|$|R

5|$|The club {{performed}} the pre-game festivities {{for the final}} game of the 1984 World Series at Tiger Stadium, but their performance was overshadowed by scenes of violence and rioting after the game. Their tour bus was set upon by rioters, who vandalised it, while <b>the</b> <b>singers</b> fled to safety. A more favourable appearance occurred the following year when, under the direction of Patrick Gardner, the club undertook a 36-day tour across Europe, which culminated in another appearance at Llangollen, where they placed third.|$|E
5|$|The last operatic {{music to}} be heard in the old house had been the finale of Falstaff, {{conducted}} by Solti with <b>the</b> <b>singers</b> led by Bryn Terfel, in a joint opera and ballet farewell gala in July 1997. When the house reopened in December 1999, magnificently restored, Falstaff was the opera given on the opening night, conducted by Haitink, once more with Terfel in the title role.|$|E

But <b>the</b> <b>singer</b> has no doubt in wanting things to continue as they are, and implies that it is pleasurable enough to be [...] "used" [...] in that fashion that being [...] "used up" [...] completely would be welcome.|$|R
5000|$|... 80's Romance is a Torch {{song that}} conveys <b>the</b> <b>singer</b> and <b>the</b> lover not {{seeing each other}} like lovers should. <b>The</b> <b>singer</b> claims her [...] "heart is cold". This {{possibly}} means that <b>the</b> <b>singer</b> thinks her love has been denied by her lover, even though some other lyrics in the song conflict with that message.|$|R
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>singers</b> of {{the second}} era of the concerto delle donne were officially ladies-in-waiting of Duchess Margherita Gonzaga d'Este, but were hired {{primarily}} as singers. Peverara's musical abilities prompted the Duke to specifically ask his wife Margherita to bring Peverara from Mantua {{as part of her}} retinue. The new singers played instruments, including the lute, harp, and viol, but focused their energies on developing vocal virtuosity. This skill became highly prized in the mid-sixteenth century, beginning with basses like Brancaccio, {{but by the end of}} the century virtuosic bass singing went out of style, and higher voices came into vogue. The ladies' musical duties included performing with the duchess' balletto delle donne, a group of female dancers who frequently crossdressed. Despite their upper-class background, <b>the</b> <b>singers</b> would not have been welcomed into the court's inner circle had they not been such skilled performers. D'Arco belonged to the nobility, but a minor family only. Peverara was the daughter of a wealthy merchant, and Molza came from a prominent family of artists.|$|E
5|$|In 1606 Vincenzo's heir Francesco {{commissioned}} from Monteverdi {{the opera}} L'Orfeo, to a libretto by Alessandro Striggio, for the Carnival season of 1607. It was given two performances in February and March 1607; <b>the</b> <b>singers</b> included, {{in the title}} role, Rasi, who had sung in the first performance of Euridice witnessed by Vincenzo in 1600. This was followed in 1608 by the opera L'Arianna (libretto by Ottavio Rinuccini), intended for {{the celebration of the}} marriage of Francesco to Margherita of Savoy. All the music for this opera is lost apart from Ariadne's Lament, which became extremely popular. To this period also belongs the ballet entertainment Il ballo delle ingrate.|$|E
5|$|L'Orfeo is, in Redlich's analysis, {{the product}} of two musical epochs. It {{combines}} elements of the traditional madrigal style of the 16th century {{with those of the}} emerging Florentine mode, in particular the use of recitative and monodic singing as developed by the Camerata and their successors. In this new style, the text dominates the music; while sinfonias and instrumental ritornelli illustrate the action, the audience's attention is always drawn primarily to the words. <b>The</b> <b>singers</b> are required to do more than produce pleasant vocal sounds; they must represent their characters in depth and convey appropriate emotions.|$|E

5|$|Meyerbeer took {{particular}} care {{over the}} first London and Berlin productions. He travelled to London to check <b>the</b> <b>singers</b> and production for the original version, and requested that the German translation for Berlin be undertaken by the poet Ludwig Rellstab, strongly recommending that Taglioni and her father Fillipo be re-engaged, and that Ciceri's sets should be reproduced. Although Taglioni danced and the sets were retained, the translation was eventually carried out by Meyerbeer's friend Theodor Hell. Meyerbeer wrote additional ballet music for Taglioni for the Berlin production.|$|E
5|$|On July 14, it was {{announced}} that German fans had until July 28 to choose their top 30 songs from an extensive pool of 121 tracks; The German version was released on August 22. The German pool list contained almost every song Jackson released in his solo career. Notably expansions on the pool choice included: A larger option of tracks from Thriller 25 and the inclusion of 12 tracks from The Ultimate Collection. There were also 8 tracks included from <b>the</b> <b>singers</b> time in The Jackson 5/Jacksons; slightly more than the other versions. The German edition was also released in Switzerland on the same day.|$|E
5|$|The {{music hall}} and cabaret are famous Paris institutions. The Moulin Rouge was opened in 1889. It was highly visible {{because of its}} large red {{imitation}} windmill on its roof, and became {{the birthplace of the}} dance known as the French Cancan. It helped make famous <b>the</b> <b>singers</b> Mistinguett and Édith Piaf and the painter Toulouse-Lautrec, who made posters for the venue. In 1911, the dance hall Olympia Paris invented the grand staircase as a settling for its shows, competing with its great rival, the Folies Bergère. Its stars in the 1920s included the American singer and dancer Josephine Baker. Later, Olympia Paris presented Edith Piaf, Marlene Dietrich, Miles Davis, Judy Garland, and the Grateful Dead.|$|E

5|$|The {{new company}} {{made its debut}} at the Prince of Wales Theatre, Cardiff on 15 April 1946 with a double bill of Cavalleria Rusticana and Pagliacci. The {{orchestra}} was professional, mostly drawn {{from members of the}} BBC Welsh Orchestra; all <b>the</b> <b>singers</b> were amateurs, except for Tudor Davies, a tenor well known at Covent Garden and Sadler's Wells, who sang Canio in Pagliacci. During the week-long season the new company also staged Faust, with Davies in the title role. Although nearing {{the end of his career}} he was a considerable box-office draw, and the company played to full houses. Nevertheless, the expense of a professional orchestra and the hire of costumes and scenery outweighed the box-office receipts, and the season made a small loss. Finance remained a recurring problem over the succeeding decades.|$|E
5|$|The video {{opens with}} Williams singing the opening verses and dancing on a street. Beyoncé, wearing an apostolic-like gown {{to fit the}} theme of the track, appears at 90 seconds into the song to deliver her verse in a forest in front of a tree hung with paper lanterns. Rowland appears soon after in the same forest wearing a white crop top, smiling. <b>The</b> <b>singers</b> appear {{together}} in the video's last section when Williams, Beyoncé and Rowland sing and dance together at a street-party scene along with dancers who are shown waving their flags and playing drums. The choreography present in the video was noted to be traditional African.|$|E
5|$|With {{the obvious}} {{exception}} of Brancaccio, all <b>the</b> <b>singers</b> in the concerto were female sopranos. Although the music {{written for the}} concerto focused on high voices, {{there is no evidence}} that the ensemble used either castrati or falsettists. This fact is surprising, considering that castrati were shortly to become the biggest stars of a new art form, opera. In 1607, Monteverdi's Orfeo featured four castrato roles out of a cast of nine, showing the new dominance of this vocal type. It also contrasts with Margherita's father's court, where Guglielmo Gonzaga actively sought out eunuchs.|$|E
