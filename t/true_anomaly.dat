Moreover, Iorio stated that the modern ephemerides of the Solar System outer planets has provided even tighter constraints: no celestial body with a mass of 15 times that of Earth can exist closer than 1100–1300AU. [...] However, work by another group of astronomers using a more comprehensive model of the Solar System found that Iorio's conclusion was only partially correct. Their analysis of Cassini data on Saturn's orbital residuals found that observations were inconsistent with a planetary body with the orbit and mass {{similar to those of}} Batygin and Brown's Planet Nine having a <b>true</b> <b>anomaly</b> of −130° to −110° or −65° to 85°.

40|$|Analysis vs. {{analysis}} The {{volume of}} data available to the analyst for the forensic analysis of an intrusion or other form of successful attack is enormous.

Consequently, this paper discusses our research towards the development of visualization techniques to aid the analysis process. These techniques are geared towards incorporation of all intrusion detection and analysis data, including both the original log data as well as the results of other intrusion detection and analysis tools.

In terms of these variables, three necessary optimal conditions are derived for solving either the problem of minimum-fuel, fixed-time transfer or the problem of minimum-time transfer for a prescribed fuel consumption. In the special cases of fixed-time coplanar transfer and free-time non-coplanar transfer, the general optimal conditions are reduced to the classical optimal conditions in the published literature.

40|$|Abstract — Many popular {{database}} management systems provide snapshot isolation (SI) for concurrency control, either {{in addition to}} or in place of full serializability based on locking. Snapshot isolation was introduced in 1995 [2], with noted anomalies {{that can lead to}} serializability violations. Full serializability was provided in 2008 [4] and improved in 2009 [5] by aborting transactions in dangerous structures, which had been shown in 2005 [9] to be precursors to potential SI anomalies. This approach resulted in a runtime environment guaranteeing a serializable form of snapshot isolation (which we call SSI [4] or ESSI [5]) for arbitrary applications. But transactions in a dangerous structure frequently do not cause <b>true</b> <b>anomalies</b> so, as the authors point out, their method is conservative: it can cause unnecessary aborts. In the current paper, we demonstrate our PSSI algorithm to detect cycles in a snapshot isolation dependency graph and abort transactions to break the cycle. This algorithm provides a much more precise criterion to perform aborts. We have implemented our algorithm in an open source production database system (MySQL/InnoDB), and our performance study shows that PSSI throughput improves on ESSI, with significantly fewer aborts.

40|$|Why {{are perfect}} animals, hybrids, and monsters food for {{symbolic}} thought? DAN SPERBER Work on animal symbolism, {{in particular that}} of Mary Douglas, suggests that the symbolic value of some animals is grounded in taxonomic anomaly. Yet the work of ethno-zoologists tends to show that folk-taxonomies are consistent and devoid of <b>true</b> <b>anomalies.</b> This raises a first problem. Moreover, not only anomalous animals, but also exemplary animals often take on a symbolic value, thus raising a second problem. A solution to both problems is suggested, based on {{an examination of the}} cognitive organization of folk-taxonomies, and with illustrations drawn from Ethiopian, Biblical, and Western culture. Foreword (1995). Here is how this article came about. When working on what was to become Le Symbolisme en Général (1974; in English, Rethinking Symbolism, 1975 a), I wrote two sections, one on rhetoric, the other on animal symbolism, that I had initially intended for the book. Both, however, became too large, and were published as separate articles (Sperber 1975 b, c).

40|$|Finite {{eccentric}}ities in mass-transferring eccentric binary {{systems can}} be explained by taking into account mass-loss and mass-transfer processes that often occur in these systems. These processes can be treated as perturbations to the general two-body problem. The time-evolution equations for the semi-major axis and the eccentricity derived from perturbative methods are in general phase-dependent. The osculating semi-major axis and eccentricity change over the orbital timescale and they are not easy to implement in binary evolution codes like MESA. However, the secular orbital element evolution equations can be simplified averaging over the rapidly varying <b>true</b> <b>anomalies.</b> In this paper, we derive the secular time-evolution equations for the semi-major axis and the eccentricity for various mass-loss/transfer processes using either the adiabatic approximation or the assumption of delta-function mass-loss/transfer at periastron. We begin with the cases of isotropic and anisotropic wind mass-loss. We continue with conservative and non-conservative non-isotropic mass ejection/accretion (including RLOF) for both point-masses and extended bodies. We conclude with the case of phase-dependent mass accretion.

Meanwhile, the problem of indeterminacy in the scaling of the decomposed signals by the FICAA can be solved by the cumulative frequency method (CFM).
