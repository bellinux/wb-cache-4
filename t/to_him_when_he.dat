These paintings, completed in 1670, hung in London's Guildhall until it was bombed during World War II; today only two (those of Sir Matthew Hale and Sir Hugh Wyndham) remain in the Guildhall Art Gallery the remainder having been destroyed or dispersed.|$|E

5|$|In {{this new}} institution, Neto angers the nurse Ivan after {{reporting}} to the hospital's superior that the nurse overreacted while trying to calm a patient. The nurse has it out for him, and when Ivan sees Neto faking to take a pill, he injects the drug through a syringe. That night, Neto, after doping a nurse, goes to the hospital stockroom and asks the inmate Biu to set fire to a stack of drugs. When Ivan discovers this, Neto receives solitary confinement. After being released from solitary, Neto writes {{a letter to his}} father and silently gives it <b>to</b> <b>him</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> visits. After refusing to have his hair cut, Neto is locked in solitary once again. He sets fires to the cage and is rescued by the nurses. After reading the letter, Wilson takes him from the clinic. The films ends as Wilson cries while he and Neto are seem seated side by side curbside.|$|E
5|$|Shankly {{tried to}} keep busy in {{retirement}} and {{stay in touch with}} football. He worked for Radio City 96.7, a Liverpool station on which he presented his own chat show, once interviewing prime minister Harold Wilson, and was a pundit on its football coverage. He briefly took up advisory roles at Wrexham and then at Tranmere Rovers, helping former Liverpool captain Ron Yeats at the latter. In November 1976, the press speculated that Shankly would make a return to management as the successor to Dave Mackay at Derby County, but the position went to Colin Murphy instead. John Toshack recalled that Shankly was a great help <b>to</b> <b>him</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> went into management with Swansea City in 1978. Despite being in his sixties, Shankly kept himself fit and often took part in five-a-side football. If nothing else was available he would join teams of youngsters in kickabouts.|$|E
5|$|The fugitives {{arrive at}} Elizabeth's house, where she tends to Steve, {{in the late}} stages of his infection. One of Steve's pustules erupts in her face, killing him and infecting Elizabeth. At that moment, Mulder and the Marshals raid the house and arrest her, but find Paul missing. Meanwhile, Scully traces Torrance's package to Pinck Pharmaceuticals, a major drug developer. She also finds an insect {{in the body of}} another prisoner. Dr. Osbourne, who has become infected, reveals that his team works for Pinck and are researching a dilating enzyme {{produced}} by the insect. However, the insect has a parasitic life cycle that kills its hosts. Osbourne claims that the insect and its contagion were deliberately introduced into the prison by Pinck as an experiment. He tells Scully that since she was next <b>to</b> <b>him</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> became infected, she may have contracted the contagion as well.|$|E

5|$|Although {{nothing is}} known of any other claimants to the throne, {{it is likely that}} there were other {{surviving}} descendants of Cerdic (the supposed progenitor of all the kings of Wessex) who might have contended for the kingdom. Ecgberht died in 839, and his will, according to the account of it found in the will of his grandson, Alfred the Great, left land only to male members of his family, so that the estates should not be lost to the royal house through marriage. Ecgberht's wealth, acquired through conquest, was no doubt one reason for his ability to purchase the support of the southeastern church establishment; the thriftiness of his will indicates he understood the importance of personal wealth to a king. The kingship of Wessex had been frequently contested among different branches of the royal line, and it is a noteworthy achievement of Ecgberht's {{that he was able to}} ensure Æthelwulf's untroubled succession. In addition, Æthelwulf's experience of kingship, in the subkingdom formed from Ecgberht's southeastern conquests, would have been valuable <b>to</b> <b>him</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> took the throne.|$|E
5|$|Ricardo Antonio Chavira {{was cast}} as Gabrielle’s wealthy and condescending husband, Carlos Solis. Kyle Searles joined the cast as John Rowland, the Solis’ teenage {{gardener}} with whom Gabrielle {{is having an}} affair. Andrea Bowen was hired to play Susan's teenage daughter, Julie, while James Denton was cast as Susan's love interest and new neighbor, plumber Mike Delfino. Mark Moses was cast as Paul, Mary Alice's mysterious husband, and Cody Kasch as their troubled teenage son Zach. Michael Reilly Burke was cast as Bree's sexually dissatisfied husband, Rex Van de Kamp. The pilot also introduced several recurring cast members. Christine Estabrook appeared as nosy neighbor Martha Huber, a role originally intended for an Asian American actress. Doug Savant made his first appearance as Tom, Lynette's husband who is always away on business. Savant later became a series regular for the second season, a promise Cherry made <b>to</b> <b>him</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> signed on for the first season. Shawn Pyfrom and Joy Lauren each made their debut appearances as Andrew and Danielle Van de Kamp, Bree's defiant teenage children. Cherry stated that casting the two roles was difficult because of their limited involvement {{in the first few}} episodes of the series. Additionally, Brent Kinsman, Shane Kinsman, and Zane Huett were cast respectively as Preston, Porter, and Parker Scavo, Lynette and Tom's three sons.|$|E

Lawrence hated Wilson, fearing that he will take away his daughter some day. After arriving at the river, Wilson recalls many summers he spent here, along with Amelia and Frank Dodd. The three often discussed their future, with Wilson and Frank both wanting to become pilots, and Amelia wanting to dance on Broadway. Years later Amelia asks Wilson to do the honorable thing and marry her, but fears what her father will do <b>to</b> <b>him</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> found out.

25|$|The fall of Barcelona on 11 September 1714 to the Bourbon king Philip V militarily {{ended the}} Habsburg {{claim to the}} Spanish Crown, which became legal fact in the Treaty of Utrecht. Philip {{felt that he had}} been betrayed by the Catalan Courts, as it had {{initially}} sworn its loyalty <b>to</b> <b>him</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> had presided over it in 1701. In retaliation for the betrayal, the first Bourbon king introduced the Nueva Planta decrees that incorporated the territories of the Crown of Aragon, including Catalonia, as provinces under the Crown of Castile in 1716, terminating their separate institutions, laws and rights, within a united kingdom of Spain. During the second half of 18th century Catalonia started a successful process of proto-industrialization.|$|E

25|$|Navajo was an {{attractive}} choice for code use because few {{people outside the}} Navajo had learned to speak the language. Virtually no books in Navajo had been published. Outside of the language, the Navajo spoken code was not very complex by cryptographic standards. It would likely have been broken if a native speaker and trained cryptographers could have worked together effectively. The Japanese {{had an opportunity to}} attempt this when they captured Joe Kieyoomia in the Philippines in 1942 during the Bataan Death March. Kieyoomia, a Navajo sergeant in the U.S. Army, but not a code talker, was ordered to interpret the radio messages later in the war. However, since Kieyoomia had not participated in the code training, the messages made no sense <b>to</b> <b>him.</b> <b>When</b> <b>he</b> reported that he could not understand the messages, his captors tortured him. The Japanese Imperial Army and Navy never cracked the spoken code.|$|E
25|$|Although it {{received}} some funds from Jews in New York, the journal's financial survival was precarious from the start. However, many volunteers helped by selling {{the paper on}} street corners and in workshops. During this time, Rocker was especially concerned with combating the influence of Marxism and historical materialism in London's Jewish labor movement. In all, the Arbeter Fraint published twenty-five essays by Rocker on the topic, the first ever critical examination of Marxism in Yiddish, according to William J. Fishman. Arbeter Fraints unsound financial footing also meant Rocker rarely received the small salary promised <b>to</b> <b>him</b> <b>when</b> <b>he</b> took over the journal and he depended financially on Witkop. Despite Rocker's sacrifices, however, the paper was forced to cease publication for lack of funds. In November 1899, the prominent American anarchist Emma Goldman visited London and Rocker met {{her for the first}} time. After hearing of the Arbeter Fraints situation she held three lectures to raise funds, but that was not enough.|$|E
25|$|Relations between 'Ali and Muhammad ibn 'Ubaydallah, {{the former}} {{governor}} for Ya'qub ibn al-Layth, had remained poor since the incident at Tustar. In an attempt to free himself from 'Ali, Muhammad wrote to Ankalay, {{the son of the}} Zanj leader, and asked that the district under his control be removed from 'Ali's jurisdiction and assigned directly to him. This deal angered 'Ali, and in retaliation he requested that Muhammad's tax revenues be transferred <b>to</b> <b>him.</b> <b>When</b> <b>he</b> received the Zanj leader's approval, he demanded the money from Muhammad, but the latter delayed payment. 'Ali used the delay as a pretext to attack Muhammad, and set out for Ramhurmuz where he way staying. Lacking the means to face 'Ali, Muhammad decided to flee, and Ramhurmuz was ransacked by 'Ali's troops. A panicked Muhammad decided to request a reconciliation with 'Ali, which the Zanj leader assented to. Muhammad then turned over his tax revenues to 'Ali, who in turn forwarded the money to al-Mukhtarah and agreed to keep his distance from the areas under Muhammad's control.|$|E
