500|$|Trescothick {{was not as}} {{successful}} in domestic cricket in 1995, although there were still some highlights including an innings of 151 against Northamptonshire (a third of his season's total), and a hat-trick, including the wicket of century-maker Adam Gilchrist, for Somerset against Young Australia. Trescothick's England Under-19 form was still excellent, averaging 74.62 with the bat in six matches. His Under-19 team mates would often mock him for wearing an England blazer after his matches; Trescothick would reply by saying that [...] "it might be <b>the</b> <b>closest</b> <b>I</b> get to playing for England".|$|E
500|$|The {{following}} {{match was}} against the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) at Lord's. The MCC fielded seven players who would represent England in the Tests, and were almost a full strength Test team, while Australia fielded their first-choice team. Bradman chose Barnes and Morris as his preferred opening pair, while Brown continued out of position in the middle order. Barring one change in the bowling department, the same team lined up in the First Test, with the top six batsmen in the same position. For players on both sides, {{it was a chance}} to gain a psychological advantage ahead of the Tests. Australia won the toss and batted and Morris fell with the score at 1/11. Barnes added 160 for the next wicket with Bradman before falling for 81 with the score at 2/171. Bradman's men went on to amass 552 and bowled out the hosts for 189 and 205 to win by an innings; Barnes caught John Deighton and Jack Robertson and took 0/15 from four overs. [...] During the match, Barnes again gained attention for placing himself extremely close to the batsman when fielding at short leg, with one foot {{on the edge of the}} cut strip. [...] According to retired Australian Test batsman Jack Fingleton, himself a former fielder in the leg trap, [...] " [...] was <b>the</b> <b>closest</b> <b>I</b> have ever seen any fieldsman on the leg side". Bradman had suggested Barnes do so when leading English batsman Len Hutton was playing, in an attempt to distract or intimidate him. Barnes later claimed he was at little risk as Hutton was reluctant to hook Australia's pace bowlers towards him and preferred to duck bowling aimed at his upper body. He said Hutton often talked pessimistically to teammates and that the Australians would benefit if they dampened Hutton's confidence. Although Hutton top-scored in both innings, scoring 52 and 64, Barnes said the batsman's eyes betrayed discomfort. The theatrical Barnes also decided to test the umpire's patience by hovering his foot over the pitch, as though he were about to place it down on the batting surface, which {{was against the}} laws of cricket. Umpire Frank Chester, who was also known for his flamboyance and penchant for making himself visible, at one point held up proceedings momentarily when Barnes feigned to put his foot on the surface as the bowler was preparing to deliver the ball.|$|E

However, Kemp stated the hardest thing he had to do in the series was not to be shot at in Afghanistan, but to interview the families of the dead men, stating: [...] "I'm not ashamed to say I bawled my eyes out." ...|$|E
2500|$|Several of Holt's friends {{confronted him}} {{about the dangers of}} his hobby, {{including}} his press secretary, Tony Eggleton, to whom he responded [...] "look Tony, what are the odds of a prime minister being drowned or taken by a shark?". On 20 May 1967, Holt had a close call while diving at Cheviot Beach on the Mornington Peninsula, where he became distressed and called for help. Pulled ashore by his diving companions, he remained conscious but turned purple and vomited a large amount of seawater. Holt attributed the incident to a leaking snorkel, and supposedly remarked [...] "that's <b>the</b> <b>closest</b> <b>I</b> have ever been to drowning in my life!". A few months later, on 5 August, he was spearfishing at Dunk Island on the Great Barrier Reef. He spent 25 minutes chasing a large coral trout, but eventually had to abandon the pursuit due to extreme shortness of breath.|$|E
