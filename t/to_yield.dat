5|$|Fourteen radioisotopes {{have been}} characterized. The most stable are 15O with a {{half-life}} of 122.24seconds and 14O with a half-life of 70.606seconds. All {{of the remaining}} radioactive isotopes have half-lives that are less than 27s {{and the majority of}} these have half-lives that are less than 83milliseconds. The most common decay mode of the isotopes lighter than 16O is β+ decay <b>to</b> <b>yield</b> nitrogen, and the most common mode for the isotopes heavier than 18O is beta decay <b>to</b> <b>yield</b> fluorine.|$|E
5|$|The C-term-EH catalyzes the {{addition}} of water to an epoxide <b>to</b> <b>yield</b> a vicinal diol (reaction 1). The Nterm-phos hydrolyzes phosphate monoesters, such as lipid phosphates, <b>to</b> <b>yield</b> alcohols and phosphoric acid (reaction 2). The C-term-EH hydrolyzes one important class of lipid signaling molecules that includes many epoxyeicosatrienoic acids (EETs) that have vasoactive, anti-inflammatory and analgesic properties.|$|E

25|$|<b>Yield</b> <b>to</b> worst (YTW): when a bond is callable, puttable, exchangeable, or {{has other}} features, the <b>yield</b> <b>to</b> worst {{is the lowest}} <b>yield</b> of <b>yield</b> <b>to</b> maturity, <b>yield</b> <b>to</b> call, <b>yield</b> <b>to</b> put, and others.|$|R

25|$|The {{interest}} payment ("coupon payment") {{divided by the}} current price of the bond is called the current yield (this is the nominal yield multiplied by the par value and divided by the price).

5|$|Beryllium {{production}} saw a {{rapid increase}} during World War II, {{due to the}} rising demand for hard beryllium-copper alloys and phosphors for fluorescent lights. Most early fluorescent lamps used zinc orthosilicate with varying content of beryllium to emit greenish light. Small additions of magnesium tungstate improved the blue part of the spectrum <b>to</b> <b>yield</b> an acceptable white light. Halophosphate-based phosphors replaced beryllium-based phosphors after beryllium {{was found to be}} toxic.|$|E

5|$|Electron {{holography}} is an {{imaging technique}} that photographically records the electron interference pattern of an object, {{which is then}} reconstructed <b>to</b> <b>yield</b> a greatly magnified image of the original object. This technique was developed to enable greater resolution in electron microscopy than is possible using conventional imaging techniques. The resolution of conventional electron microscopy is not limited by electron wavelength, but by the large aberrations of electron lenses.|$|E
5|$|Fructose, {{or fruit}} sugar, occurs {{naturally}} in fruits, some root vegetables, cane sugar and honey {{and is the}} sweetest of the sugars.

40|$|The {{objective}} of investigation was <b>to</b> analyse oil <b>yield</b> components and their relations by simple coefficient correlations {{as well as}} direct and indirect effects <b>to</b> oil <b>yield</b> by path analysis. Twenty-four sunflower hybrids {{were included in the}} investigation and their seven traits (plant height, head diameter, 1000 seed weight, hec- tolitar mass, grain yield, oil content and oil yield). Very strong positive correlation was estimated between grain yield and oil yield, strong positive correlation between hectolitar mass and oil yield, and middle corre- lation among oil yield and: 1000 seed weight, plaint height and oil content. There was no correlation between grain yields and oil content. Grain yield showed the strongest effect <b>to</b> oil <b>yield.</b> Oil content had lower effect <b>to</b> oil <b>yield.</b> Other traits showed no significant effect <b>to</b> oil <b>yield,</b> and their effect <b>to</b> oil <b>yield</b> was covered by indirect effect of grain yield...|$|R

5|$|The {{production}} of the metals itself is difficult due to their reactivity. The formation of oxides, nitrides and carbides must be avoided <b>to</b> <b>yield</b> workable metals; this is normally achieved by the Kroll process.
