5|$|When Wright left Raymond {{set up his}} own office, he advertised {{himself as}} a {{specialist}} in reinforced concrete. He was aware of its textural properties from Cass Gilbert, its structural ones from Wright, and its benefits in relation to earthquake proofing. His first major independent project in 1921 was to design Hoshi Pharmaceutical School, {{which was one of}} the first reinforced concrete buildings in Tokyo. Raymond used precast concrete to form decorative elements for the building, such as window mullions. In a partially successful experiment, he used wooden formwork to imprint a texture onto the concrete (but he chose <b>to</b> <b>cover</b> <b>it</b> <b>up).</b>|$|E
5|$|An evil sorcerer named Zarok plotted to {{take over}} the kingdom of Gallowmere with his undead army. It is told in legend that the champion, Sir Daniel Fortesque, led the King of Gallowmere's army to victory and managed to kill Zarok before he succumbed to his mortal wounds. In reality however, Dan was in fact struck down by the first arrow fired in the battle, with the king {{choosing}} <b>to</b> <b>cover</b> <b>it</b> <b>up</b> and declare Dan a hero. Zarok, meanwhile, went into hiding. 100 years later, Zarok reappears, casting a spell over Gallowmere to awaken his undead army and steal the souls of the living. However, in the process, he unwittingly revives the corpse of Dan, who has over time become a skeletal corpse, missing his jaw and the eye he lost in the battle of Gallowmere. Having been unable to ascend to the Hall of Heroes, Dan uses this opportunity to defeat Zarok, save Gallowmere and earn his place as a true hero.|$|E
5|$|As a {{token of}} respect, {{prosecutor}} Klavier Gavin, Kristoph's brother and Apollo's rival, invites him and Trucy to attend a concert for his band, the Gavinners. During a guest performance by the diva Lamiroir, her manager Romein LeTouse is shot and killed in her dressing room. When Machi Tobaye, Lamiroir's pianist, is accused for the killing, Apollo, through an extensive investigation, discovers that Machi {{and one of the}} Gavinners, Detective Daryan Crescend, conspired to smuggle contraband into the country, and that Letouse, in reality an undercover Interpol agent, was murdered <b>to</b> <b>cover</b> <b>it</b> <b>up.</b> The case nearly falls apart {{due to a lack of}} decisive evidence, but Apollo is able to squeeze a confession out of Daryan by threatening to have Machi testify.|$|E

5|$|Diagnosis and {{treatment}} cost patients money, and the player can change hospital policy, including {{the amount of}} diagnosis patients require. This can be set to over 100 per cent to force patients to have further unnecessary diagnoses. Other policies include when staff can go on breaks and whether they can leave rooms, and loans can be taken out. From time to time, events such as emergencies (in which patients arrive and must be cured within a time limit or they will die), and epidemics (in which a disease spreads rapidly) occur. During the latter, the player can attempt <b>to</b> <b>cover</b> <b>it</b> <b>up</b> by curing all affected patients before a health inspector turns up. If the player fails, {{he or she is}} fined and must face a damaged reputation, a statistic that shows how well the hospital is doing and affects the flow of patients. VIPs may also occasionally ask to tour the hospital; if impressed, the player is granted a cash bonus, a reputation increase, or both. There is an advisor who keeps the player informed about what is going on. Rats may infest the hospital, and the player is able to shoot them with the cursor.|$|E
5|$|Shortly after Skinner arrives home he is met by Mulder, {{who tells}} {{him about the}} case {{and the fact that}} someone is going to great lengths <b>to</b> <b>cover</b> <b>it</b> <b>up.</b> Mulder reveals that Detective Thomas was killed, which shocks Skinner. Mulder tells Skinner that Scully is {{undergoing}} tests regarding her cancer. Later that night Skinner meets with The Smoking Man, who is accompanied by Thomas' murderer, the Gray Haired Man (Morris Panych). Skinner is angry that Thomas was killed and wants to end their arrangement, which The Smoking Man refuses to allow. Mulder calls Skinner, telling him about the woman's body being burned and the blood evidence being tampered with. Mulder tells Skinner that he is trying to match the bullet that killed Thomas to a gun issued to a federal agent or local officer. Skinner searches his drawer and realizes that his gun was missing and must have been the one used for the murder. Skinner, realizing he has been set up, calls The Smoking Man, who confirms that Thomas was killed with Skinner's gun and that by going to the police Skinner would end up implicating himself in the murder. The Smoking Man refuses to provide any details on what he is covering up.|$|E

However, by March 1966, the Governor's approval rating fell to 56%, due to Burn's alleged dishonesty, lack of integrity, and showing favoritism. In that same [...] "confidential" [...] poll Robert High surprisingly led Haydon Burns by 34%-28.5%, while Scott Kelly received 18.5% and 19% were left undecided. Due to the [...] "stunning" [...] results this poll conducted by Haydon Burns' campaign managers, they attempted <b>to</b> <b>cover</b> <b>up</b> <b>it</b> <b>up.</b> By the end of November, the three major Democratic candidates in 1964 all announced their intention to run for Governor in 1966, which were incumbent Governor Haydon Burns, Mayor of Miami Robert King, and State Senator Scott Kelly.

His motive for the murder was that he, Relia and Millford, Strickland's secretary, were blackmailing the owner, Mr. Crandell. What the blackmail was for is never explained. When Strickland found out he came to investigate, so Melton killed him. Millford then sent down the former clients to use as decoys for the police, but Melton killed Relia and Millford <b>to</b> <b>cover</b> <b>it</b> all <b>up.</b> He attempts to escape through a window, but is caught by a booby trap previously set by Freddie.|$|R

25|$|The {{connection}} between the break-in and the re-election committee was highlighted by media coverage—in particular, investigative coverage by The Washington Post, Time, and The New York Times. The coverage dramatically increased publicity and consequent political repercussions. Relying heavily upon anonymous sources, Post reporters Bob Woodward and Carl Bernstein uncovered information suggesting that knowledge of the break-in, and attempts <b>to</b> <b>cover</b> <b>it</b> <b>up,</b> led deeply into {{the upper reaches of}} the Justice Department, FBI, CIA, and the White House.

Eight years later a British Columbia man flying out of Vancouver on WestJet with a Ragged Ass Road T-shirt was told by a flight attendant <b>to</b> either <b>cover</b> <b>it</b> <b>up</b> or turn <b>it</b> inside out {{for the duration of the}} flight since the airline was [...] "family-friendly". He chose the former option, but when the incident made national news, WestJet apologized. When it did so, it posted to its Instagram account a photo of a Ragged Ass Road sign that had been on the office wall of its chief executive officer, Gregg Saretsky, for two years. Yellowknife city officials made it a point to meet with WestJet officials to come to a common understanding: the T-shirts are a tourist draw.|$|R

It {{really was a}} [...] "bouncer," [...] as every one said; and I assure you that two small persons could sit on it side by side. It seemed to have absorbed all the goodness of the little garden, and all the sunshine that shone down on it, and lay there a great round, golden ball, full of rich suggestions of pumpkin-pies for weeks to come. Robby {{was so proud of}} his mammoth vegetable that he took every one to see it, and, when frosts began <b>to</b> nip, <b>covered</b> <b>it</b> <b>up</b> each night with an old bedquilt, tucking it round as if the pumpkin was a well-beloved baby. The day it was gathered he would let no one touch it but himself, and nearly broke his back tugging it to the barn in his little wheelbarrow, with Dick and Dolly harnessed in front to give a heave up the path. His mother promised him that the Thanksgiving-pies should be made from it, and hinted vaguely that she had a plan in her head which would cover the prize pumpkin and its owner with glory.|$|R
50|$|The {{argument}} {{was a result}} of differences of opinion as {{to the future of the}} British helicopter industry. Westland Helicopters, Britain's last helicopter manufacturer, was to be the subject of a rescue bid. While the Defence Secretary Heseltine favoured a European solution, integrating Westland and British Aerospace (BAe) with Italian (Agusta) and French companies, the Prime Minister and the Trade and Industry Secretary Leon Brittan wanted to see Westland merge with Sikorsky, an American company. Heseltine refused to accept Thatcher's choice and suggested she had lied about it. She had leaked a confidential letter, then tried <b>to</b> <b>cover</b> that <b>up.</b> <b>It</b> resulted in resignations in January 1986 by Heseltine and Brittan. The episode embarrassed the Conservative government of Margaret Thatcher in 1986 and damaged her reputation.|$|R

25|$|In July 2003, Bianca is {{raped by}} Michael. She internalizes her rage and only tells Maggie, but {{eventually}} the entire town of Pine Valley learns the truth, which brings Bianca and her estranged mother closer. Michael is charged with rape but, to the town's outrage, he is acquitted. When Bianca discovers she is pregnant {{as a result of}} rape, Kendall, who had so often scorned Bianca in their past, unconditionally supports her sister and does not give an opinion on Bianca's choices. Michael disappears and Kendall announces she has married her sister's rapist, who shortly turns up dead with Kendall having become the primary suspect in his murder. When Bianca tells Kendall she is keeping her baby, also inspired by Kendall being part of her life, Kendall helps her sister and, with Maggie and Lena's help, aids her in hiding her pregnancy from everyone, including Erica. Kendall announces she is pregnant by Michael, which is also used by her lawyers to help avoid a murder charge and Bianca helps Kendall fake the pregnancy. Bianca and Kendall's ruse is aided by Dr. David Hayward, Ryan Lavery, Lena, Maggie, Reggie Montgomery, and Jackson. The truth eventually comes out that Bianca is the killer but blocked it out and that Kendall, with Reggie's help, worked <b>to</b> <b>cover</b> <b>it</b> <b>up</b> in an effort to protect Bianca; Bianca shot Michael in self-defense but the trauma of her rape led to her repressing the memory. After hearing Bianca's confession, the judge presiding over the case leans hard on the prosecution not to file any charges against her.|$|E

An individual given to such wanton denudation would simply be at a disadvantage with his decently covered fellows, would fall behind in the race of life, and perish with his kind.

2500|$|Nick Cook, an {{aviation}} investigative journalist for Jane's Information Group and researcher of Billion Dollar Secret {{and author of}} The Hunt for Zero Point claims to have uncovered documentary evidence that top-secret US Defense Industry technology has been developed by government-backed Defense Industry programs, beginning in the 1940s using research conducted by Nazi scientists during WWII and recovered by Allied Military Intelligence, then taken to the U.S. and developed further with the collaboration of the same former German scientists at top-secret facilities established at White Sands, New Mexico, and later at Area 51, allegedly resulting in production of real-world prototype operational supersonic craft actually tested and used in clandestine military exercises, with other developments incorporated later into spy aircraft tasked with overflying hostile countries: the UFO story that evidence of alien technology is being suppressed and removed or destroyed was generated and then promoted by the CIA, beginning 1947, as false-lead disinformation <b>to</b> <b>cover</b> <b>it</b> all <b>up</b> {{for the sake of}} National Security, particularly during the Cold War, at a time when (his investigations found) the Soviet Union too was developing its own top-secret high-tech UFO craft. Cook's conclusions, alleging suppression of evidence of advanced human technology instead of alien, together with what he presents as declassified top-secret documents and blueprints, and his interviews of various experts (some of doubtful reliability), was developed and broadcast as a feature documentary on British television in 2005 as [...] "UFOs: The Secret Evidence" [...] and in the US in 2006 as a two-part episode on the History Channel's UFO Files, retitled [...] "An Alien History of Planet Earth", with an added introduction by actor William Shatner.

500|$|One of {{the wealthiest}} stars in Hollywood, Grant owned houses in Beverly Hills, Malibu, and Palm Springs. He was immaculate in his {{personal}} grooming, and Edith Head, the renowned Hollywood costume designer, appreciated his [...] "meticulous" [...] attention to detail and considered him {{to have had the}} greatest fashion sense of any actor she had worked with. McCann attests his [...] "almost obsessive maintenance" [...] with tanning, which deepened the older he got, to Douglas Fairbanks, who also had a major influence on his refined sense of dress. [...] McCann notes that because Grant came from a working-class background and was not well educated, he made a particular effort {{over the course of his}} career to mix with high society and absorb their knowledge, manners and etiquette <b>to</b> compensate and <b>cover</b> <b>it</b> <b>up.</b> His image was meticulously crafted from the early days in Hollywood, where he would frequently sunbathe and avoid being photographed smoking, despite smoking two packs a day at the time. Grant quit smoking in the early 1950s through hypnotherapy. He remained health conscious, staying very trim and athletic even into his late career, though Grant admitted he [...] "never crook a finger to keep fit". He confessed that he did [...] "everything in moderation. Except making love".|$|R

500|$|Rather than {{enforce the}} {{violated}} regulations more strictly {{and clean up}} the river, the city chose <b>to</b> <b>cover</b> <b>it</b> <b>up</b> entirely. Between 1917 and 1922, the last [...] of river, including a small gorge, was buried in a flume under the Getty Square neighborhood, an effort to halt the river's frequent floods and quarantine its unsanitary water, and open up some space for further development. That same decade, the county parks commission proposed the Saw Mill River Parkway along the river, just as the 1922 Bronx River Parkway follows the Bronx River, and to add a sewer line along the river to prevent contamination of Yonkers' water supply. Construction began in 1929 and continued throughout the Great Depression. By 1940, the parkway had reached the river's headwaters at Chappaqua, where World War II temporarily halted construction. In 1954, it was complete. The parkway's construction, along {{with that of the}} New York State Thruway later in the decade, required some adjustment of the river's course in some areas.|$|E
