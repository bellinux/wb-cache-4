500|$|Fifth Air Force {{commander}} Lieutenant General George Kenney {{later recalled}} that Colonel David W. [...] "Photo" [...] Hutchison, {{who had been}} the air task force commander at Marilinan and had moved over to Nadzab to take charge of air activities there, was told to work out the problem with Vasey: [...] "I didn't care how it was done but I wanted a good forward airdrome about a hundred miles further up the Markham Valley. Photo Hutchison and Vasey were a natural team. <b>They</b> <b>both</b> <b>knew</b> what I wanted and Vasey not only believed that the air force could perform miracles but that the 7th Division and the Fifth Air Force working together could do anything." ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{addition}} to Wieland, two more German soldiers, {{who had been}} formerly raised in Palestinian Templer communities, {{were assigned to the}} unit. <b>They</b> <b>both</b> <b>knew</b> the region quite well, and belonged to the [...] Brandenburg division: Werner Frank,whose job was to man the radio, was born in Haifa, had joined the Hitler Youth there in 1934, and had become a Brandenburger in 1940; and Friedrich Deininger, born in Waldheim. Deininger had assisted the Palestinian Arab forces during the Palestinian uprising and, as a result, had been imprisoned at Bat Yam..|$|E
2500|$|Estoppel by {{convention}} as {{understood in}} English law (also known as estoppel by agreement) occurs where two parties negotiates or operates a contract {{based on a}} shared assumption or mutual understanding of a legal effect (or interpretation) of that contract, they are bound by that belief, assumption or understanding if (i) <b>they</b> <b>both</b> <b>knew</b> the other operated under the same, and (ii) they both regulated their subsequent dealings on the same. [...] It {{has been said that}} estoppel by convention is not truly an estoppel but merely an instance of estoppel by representation, promissory estoppel or proprietary estoppel, though the first of the three is its most frequent manifestation.|$|E
5000|$|Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times {{gave the}} film 3 stars (out of 4); saying Foster and Howard [...] "are {{perfectly}} modulated {{in the kinds}} of scenes difficult for actors to play, where <b>they</b> <b>both</b> <b>know</b> more than they're saying, and <b>they</b> <b>both</b> <b>know</b> it." ...|$|R

2500|$|Orlando Brown portrayed Edward [...] "Eddie" [...] Thomas, Aged 14â€“17. He is Raven's male best friend. He is an {{aspiring}} rapper, {{and is a}} guard on the school basketball team. He is like a [...] "big brother" [...] to Cory Baxter and was commonly portrayed as playful, ambitious, loyal, girl crazy and quick to jump to conclusions. Occasionally, he says [...] "Told ya! Told ya twice!" [...] after he tells Raven not {{to do something that}} <b>they</b> <b>both</b> <b>knew</b> she would do. Another common catchphrase of his is [...] "Holla!" [...] after he finishes talking to his friends or girls that he likes. His parents are divorced, which is mentioned several times throughout the series. It is also said that he has a little brother. In one episode, Eddie and Raven not only start to develop romantic feelings for each other but they also kiss on the lips at two separate times; however, {{by the end of the}} episode, they decide to remain friends (though its strongly implied they're still interested in one another). Eddie has appeared in every episode except Juicer Consequences.|$|E
2500|$|On another front, Robertson {{had agreed}} to perform with his cover band in a battle of the bands at Nathan Phillips Square for the Second Harvest food bank. The band broke up and he forgot about the gig. When he {{received}} a phone call a week before the show, asking him to confirm the gig, he improvised that the name of the band had changed to [...] "Barenaked Ladies", recalling the name from the Dylan concert. He then called Page and asked if he wanted to do the gig; Page reportedly could not believe Robertson had given that name. They arranged three rehearsals and missed them all. The two played the show on October 1, 1988, but instead of competing, they played while the other bands set up, playing every song they could think of that <b>they</b> <b>both</b> <b>knew.</b> The show went well and they were invited to open a show for another well-known local band, The Razorbacks, at the Horseshoe Tavern the coming weekend. They set up three more rehearsals, and again missed them all; they proceeded to improvise their set once again. This would set a precedent for an element of Barenaked Ladies concerts which still almost always contain some improvised raps or songs, as well as general improvised banter.|$|E
2500|$|Rescue workers did {{not proceed}} further {{through the rubble}} past {{the back end of}} the {{telehandler}} because it was unsafe, instead choosing to blast a new tunnel across from the main decline to the side tunnel, aiming to come {{out in front of the}} telehandler. On 29 April they began blasting a new tunnel, detonating at least six large explosive charges to form the tunnel. The blasts dislodged rock inside the cage of the telehandler, which Webb and Russell attempted to clear, although as the blasts came closer, rock was dislodged faster than they could clear it. Russell recorded the date and time of each blast on his clothing, so that if they died as a result of the blasting, the rescuers would know that they had been alive prior to a particular blast. Both Webb and Russell also wrote letters to their families on their clothing. The two men sang [...] "The Gambler" [...] by Kenny Rogers (the only song <b>they</b> <b>both</b> <b>knew)</b> in order to keep up their spirits, as they waited for successive blasts to occur in the tunnel. At about 5.45PM on 30 April two rescuers, Pat Ball the underground manager and Steve Saltmarsh, mine foreman, breached safety protocols by entering the 925 level, to the rockfall and yelled out. Webb and Russell began yelling [...] "We're in here!" [...] and this was how the rescuers found out they were alive.|$|E

6000|$|Ferdinand laughed, in {{the midst}} of his vexation. 'Confound them both!' said he, looking at his watch. 'I want to get away. Why the deuce can't they come together! <b>They</b> <b>both</b> <b>know</b> what <b>they</b> want and mean to do. Look at them!' ...|$|R

60|$|So {{presently}} <b>they</b> <b>both</b> <b>knew</b> {{that they}} were blocked out of one another's houses {{for some time to}} come, and Dr. Gallagher walked forward and told Mr. Smith, who had never studied Greek, about Champlain crossing the rock divide.|$|E
