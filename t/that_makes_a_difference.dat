A battery-assisted passive (BAP) has a small battery on board and is activated when {{in the presence of}} an RFID reader. A passive tag is cheaper and smaller because it has no battery; instead, the tag uses the radio energy transmitted by the reader. However, to operate a passive tag, it must be illuminated with a power level roughly a thousand times stronger than for signal transmission. <b>That</b> <b>makes</b> <b>a</b> <b>difference</b> in interference and in exposure to radiation.|$|E

[...] The work of Felix Hausdorff and Stefan Banach had implied {{that the problem of}} measure has a positive solution if [...] or [...] and a negative solution (because of the Banach–Tarski paradox) in all other cases. Von Neumann's work argued that the [...] "problem is essentially group-theoretic in character": the existence of a measure could be determined by looking at the properties of the transformation group of the given space. The positive solution for spaces of dimension at most two, and the negative solution for higher dimensions, {{comes from the fact that}} the Euclidean group is a solvable group for dimension at most two, and is not solvable for higher dimensions. [...] "Thus, according to von Neumann, it is the change of group <b>that</b> <b>makes</b> <b>a</b> <b>difference,</b> not the change of space." ...|$|E

[...] Rollins' season was {{characterized}} by a strong first half, and a [...] "sophomore jinx" [...] at the plate that plagued him {{in the second half of}} the season. For his performance in the early months of the season, he earned his second consecutive selection to the MLB All-Star game, in doing so becoming the first Phillie and first MLB shortstop ever to reach the game in each of his first two seasons. After the all-star game, however, he struggled at the plate, striking out frequently and chasing many high pitches that were out of the strike zone. Ultimately, Rollins finished the season among the NL leaders in defensive statistics – he compiled a [...]980 fielding percentage (second in NL), 695 total chances (third in NL), 504 assists (fourth in NL), and 226 putouts (fifth in NL). Meanwhile, offensively, he regressed from his 2001 campaign, posting a [...]245 batting average with 11 home runs, but still leading the NL with 10 triples; he stole 31 bases, 15 fewer than he did in 2001. After the season, he participated in the Major League Baseball Japan All-Star Series.|$|E
