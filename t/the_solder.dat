5|$|Ingestion of {{metallic}} lead, such {{as small}} lead fishing lures, increases blood lead levels {{and can be}} fatal. Ingestion of lead-contaminated food is also a threat. Ceramic glaze often contains lead, and dishes that have been improperly fired can leach the metal into food, potentially causing severe poisoning. In some places, <b>the</b> <b>solder</b> in cans used for food contains lead. When manufacturing medical instruments and hardware, solder containing lead may be present.

Bullets lodged in the body rarely cause significant levels of lead, but bullets lodged in the joints are the exception, as they deteriorate and release lead into the body over time.|$|E

Purpose of the work: {{development of}} methods for estimating the permissible level of macroflaws in <b>the</b> <b>soldered</b> joints of <b>the</b> microelectronic device elements.

40|$|Residual stress {{distribution}} in soldered structure of Kovar alloy and Al 2 O 3 ceramics was determined using XRD analyses.
