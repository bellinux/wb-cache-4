5|$|Earlier, {{his family}} had become {{concerned}} in August when he called them <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>he</b> had dropped the course, but was remaining there. By September, he routinely skipped his classes at the institute and attended lectures at Iman University, which intelligence officials from the United States suspected to have links to terrorism.|$|E
5|$|At the school, the {{principal}} tells the legless man’s janitor guise {{that she was}} very worried when he did not show up that morning. Trevor, a bully who had earlier tormented Quinton, sees partially through the beggar's forms for a moment. Trevor later shows up at Quinton’s home <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>he</b> is sorry and says he thinks he knows who killed his father.|$|E
5|$|In Vienna Brand {{was given}} a German {{passport}} {{in the name of}} Eugen Band. He cabled the Jewish Agency in Istanbul <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>he</b> was on his way, and arrived by German diplomatic plane on 19 May. Paul Rose writes that Brand had no idea at this point that the deportations to Auschwitz had already begun.|$|E

5|$|Reich {{lost his}} {{position}} at the New School in May 1941 after writing to its director, Alvin Johnson, <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>he</b> had saved several lives in secret experiments with the accumulator. Johnson was aware of Reich's claims that he could cure cancer, and told him the New School was not an appropriate institution for the work. Reich was also evicted from Kessel Street after his neighbours complained about the animal experiments. His supporters, including Walter Briehl, gave him $14,000 to buy a house, and he settled into 9906 69th Avenue.|$|E
5|$|After some time, Neto's {{parents and}} sister visit him, and are deceived by {{the doctor who}} says Neto {{requires}} months of treatment. Neto begs his parents to take him with them and they refuse. Days later, Neto tries to escape but is captured and receives electric shock treatment. Suddenly, in another day, his father visits him <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>he</b> and Meire are missing him; Neto asks to leave the place and Wilson takes him away. At home, his mother asks a downcast Neto {{if he wants to}} return to school or to work as a salesman; he decides to work. The mother of one of his friends forbids Neto to see him, and he discovers Leninha is a married woman. Then, he becomes distressed to the point of leaving a client {{in the midst of a}} sale. To unwind, Neto goes to a party at night, where he mixes Coca-Cola and cachaça. Drunk, he carries his friend Bel to the bathroom and they start to kiss each other. However, he goes berserk and starts to damage the place. The police are called and send him to another psychiatric hospital.|$|E
5|$|They {{argued that}} Bamber had then set about {{arranging}} {{the scene to}} make it appear that Sheila was the killer. He discovered that she could not have reached the trigger with the silencer attached, so he removed it and returned it to the gun cupboard, then placed a Bible next to her body to introduce a religious theme. He removed the kitchen phone from its hook, left the house via a kitchen window, perhaps after showering, and banged the window from the outside so that the catch dropped back into position. He had then cycled on his mother's bicycle. Shortly after 3am, he had telephoned Mugford, then the police at 3:26am <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>he</b> had just received a frantic call from his father. To create a delay before the bodies were discovered, he had not called 999, had driven slowly to the farmhouse, and had told police that his sister was familiar with guns, so that they would be reluctant to enter.|$|E

5|$|Towards {{the end of}} the tour, Hammond fell seriously ill; {{according}} to him, a mosquito stung him in the groin area, close to a strain he had suffered, causing blood poisoning. Playing against Jamaica, he moved awkwardly and his team-mates observed him to be in pain. He missed the remaining matches of the tour, and none of the doctors he saw were able to help. On the journey home, during which no doctor was available, his condition worsened, confining him to his cabin with a severe fever for most of the trip. The day after his arrival home, in April 1926, Hammond had the first of 12operations at the nursing home to which he was taken. His condition worsened {{to the point where the}} doctors believed he would die; they considered amputating his leg, a suggestion vetoed by his mother out of concern for his career. Hammond later claimed that his illness remained a mystery to those treating him. A visit from Warner encouraged Hammond to believe recovery was possible, and he began a slow return to health about a month after his return to England. By July, he could watch Gloucestershire playing in Bristol, though he missed the entire 1926 season. No official announcement about Hammond's illness was made, other than <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>he</b> was in a nursing home. Although the cause of the illness was never made clear, David Foot has argued that it was syphilis or a related sexually transmitted disease. He has also suggested that its treatment, which in the days before antibiotics probably involved mercury, adversely affected Hammond's subsequent character and personality, leading to moody and depressive behaviour. Rumours of this nature circulated among his contemporaries for many years before Foot published his theory. That winter, Hammond coached in South Africa, where it was felt the climate might aid his recovery.|$|E
25|$|In December 2014, Muhammadu Buhari went on {{the record}} <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>he</b> would abolish, scrap or ban {{the office of the}} First Lady if he was elected as President, saying that it was unconstitutional.|$|E
25|$|Dutt wired home <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>he</b> had {{got the job}} of a {{telephone}} operator at a Lever Brothers factory in Calcutta. But soon he got disenchanted by the job and left it. He later joined his parents in Bombay in 1944.|$|E

25|$|After briefly {{arguing over}} {{who was going}} to kill the {{remaining}} child, Andersen proceeded to stab Sørstrønen once in the neck, also severing her carotid artery, while Kristiansen was holding her arms and legs. The two men then covered the bodies with vegetation, and stuffed their bodies between the slab rocks before throwing the girls' blood-soaked swimsuits in the muddy waters of the lake. After walking back towards the neighborhood of Eg, in which they lived, the two men planned to feign an alibi for the time of the murders. Kristiansen was <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>he</b> was in his workshop, while Andersen was <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>he</b> was jogging. Later in the day, the two met up at Kristiansens house, where they called up two other friends, in an attempt to bolster their alibi.|$|E
25|$|Whether Abu Bakr {{actually}} intended a full-out imperial conquest {{or not is}} hard <b>to</b> <b>say.</b> <b>He</b> did, however, set {{in motion}} a historical trajectory (continued later on by Umar and Uthman) that in just a few short decades would lead to one of the largest empires in history, beginning with a confrontation with the Sassanid Empire under the general Khalid ibn al-Walid.|$|E
25|$|Vigilante groups, {{consisting}} of radical nationalists, and Neo-Nazis, lure men or boys to meetings, accuse them of being gay, humiliate and beat them, and post videos {{of the proceedings}} on social media. For example, in September 2013 a video showed the rape of an Uzbek migrant in Russia who was threatened {{with a gun and}} forced <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>he</b> was gay. A few investigations were launched, but have not yet resulted in effective prosecution.|$|E

25|$|At {{the time}} of his death, Cody's once-great fortune had dwindled to less than $100,000 (approximately $ today). He left his burial {{arrangements}} to his wife. She said that he had always said he wanted to be buried on Lookout Mountain, which was corroborated by their daughter Irma, Cody's sisters, and family friends. But other family members joined the people of Cody <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>he</b> should be buried in the town he founded.|$|E
25|$|The French {{seaside resort}} of Cancale in Brittany is {{noted for its}} oysters, which also date from Roman times. Sergius Orata of the Roman Republic is {{considered}} the first major merchant and cultivator of oysters. Using his considerable knowledge of hydraulics, he built a sophisticated cultivation system, including channels and locks, to control the tides. He was so famous for this, the Romans used <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>he</b> could breed oysters {{on the roof of}} his house.|$|E
25|$|During {{the year}} Van Gogh {{stayed at the}} asylum, the {{prolific}} output of paintings he had begun in Arles continued. During this period, he produced some of the best-known works of his career, including the Irises from May 1889, now in the J. Paul Getty Museum, and the blue self-portrait from September, 1889, in the Musée d'Orsay. The Starry Night was painted mid-June by around 18 June, the date {{he wrote to his}} brother Theo <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>he</b> had a new study of a starry sky.|$|E

25|$|This insurrection can {{seen as a}} {{consequence}} of the willful disturbance by count Albert of the precarious internal relations of the Frisian territories. Elevating the Vetkopers inherently made Schieringers his enemies. Then he aggravated the situation by starting to feudalise Oostergo and Westergo, that is <b>to</b> <b>say,</b> <b>he</b> enfeoffed Vetkopers with the lordly rights in a lot of villages, not caring whether or not those villages already had headlings, which in the Frisian state of things was more or less the same as a village lord.|$|E
25|$|Vic {{wanted to}} become a boxer at the age of 5 and dreamed of {{becoming}} a world champion in the professionals. His father told him there was no professional boxing in Armenia (or any Soviet countries; this changed when the Union fell in 1991) and instead wanted Vic to follow in his footsteps and take up wrestling. Vic also wrestled as a kid, but always continued <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>he</b> would become a world champion someday. He eventually left wrestling in pursuit of his dream to become a world boxing champion.|$|E
25|$|By this point, Andrew {{was also}} {{presenting}} {{six days a}} week – including cover shifts on the afternoon show, weekday evenings, The Friday Session, Saturday afternoons, and throughout the bank holiday schedules. On 14 July 2005, Andrew received a call <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>he</b> was needed on-air as The Mailbox was being evacuated because of a bomb scare. Andrew found himself broadcasting late into the night on BBC WM with the then-editor Keith Beech arriving an hour later to co-present. It later transcribed that BBC Radio 5 Live had crossed to WM for rolling coverage.|$|E
