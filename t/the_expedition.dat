5|$|A last-minute gift of £4,000 from Shackleton's cousin William Bell {{still left}} <b>the</b> <b>expedition</b> {{far short of}} the {{required}} £30,000, but enabled Nimrods refit to be finished. Fundraising continued in Australia after the ship arrived there; a further £5,000 was provided as a gift from the Government of Australia, and the New Zealand Government gave £1,000. By these means, and with other smaller loans and donations, the £30,000 was raised, although by the end of <b>the</b> <b>expedition</b> total costs had risen, by Shackleton's estimate, to £45,000.|$|E

More than 4,000 men on more than 90 transports (mainly fishing boats and coastal traders), escorted by six colonial guard ships, descended on Canso, where <b>the</b> <b>expedition</b> waited for the ice to clear from Gabarus Bay, the site just south of Louisbourg that had been chosen for the troop landing.

Although initially planning to travel independently, they decided to join a Norwegian expedition led by Hagbord Ekerold and accompanied by Swiss mountaineer and glaciologist Paul Louis Mercanton. <b>The</b> <b>expedition</b> set sail from Bratvaag aboard two ships in August 1921, and upon arriving at Jan Mayen they became {{the first team to}} successfully climb the Beerenberg. During <b>the</b> <b>expedition,</b> Lethbridge was also able to explore his growing interest in archaeology by excavating at an abandoned Eskimo settlement.

5|$|Fifield (Sean Harris) is a {{geologist}} on the Prometheus. After waking up, he rejects friendly overtures from Millburn and casts doubt on Shaw and Holloway's mission hypothesis.

When <b>the</b> <b>expedition</b> encounters a decapitated Engineer, Fifield abandons his research and leaves the group with Millburn following. They become lost, failing to rendezvous {{with the rest of}} <b>the</b> <b>expedition</b> who has left because of the storm, and find a mound of Engineer corpses and a hidden room containing the thawed, mutating black liquid. They also encounter Hammerpedes: extraterrestrial, eel-like creatures which attack them. Fifield decapitates one, and its corrosive blood melts his helmet. The deformed and mutated Fifield returns to the Prometheus, where he attacks the crew and murders several members before he is killed.|$|E
