40|$|The {{imagined}} {{support of}} benevolent supernatural agents attenuates anxiety and risk perception. Here, we extend these findings to judgments {{of the threat}} posed by a potentially violent adversary. Conceptual representations of bodily size and strength summarize factors that determine the relative threat posed by foes. The proximity of allies moderates <b>the</b> <b>envisioned</b> physical formidability of adversaries, suggesting that cues of access to supernatural allies will reduce <b>the</b> <b>envisioned</b> physical formidability of a threatening target. Across two studies, subtle cues of both supernatural and earthly social support reduced <b>the</b> <b>envisioned</b> physical formidability of a violent criminal. These manipulations had no effect on the perceived likelihood of encountering non-conflictual physical danger, raising the possibility that imagined supernatural support leads participants to view themselves not as shielded from encountering perilous situations, but as protected should perils arise...|$|R
