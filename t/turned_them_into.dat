Star defenceman King Clancy was sold to Toronto for an {{unprecedented}} $35,000 and two players on October 11, 1930. The team fell into last place {{for the first time}} since 1898. In 1931, a potential deal arose with the owners of Chicago Stadium, including grain magnate James E. Norris, who wanted to move the team to Chicago, but the deal was vetoed by Chicago Black Hawks owner Frederic McLaughlin who did not want another team in his territory. Norris bought the bankrupt Detroit Falcons instead and <b>turned</b> <b>them</b> <b>into</b> the Detroit Red Wings.|$|E
5|$|Cooper {{took over}} as {{production}} head after Selznick's departure and oversaw two hits starring Hepburn: Morning Glory (1933), for which she won her first Oscar, and Little Women (1933), director Cukor's second collaboration with the actress. Among the studio's in-house productions, the latter was the biggest box-office success of the decade. Ginger Rogers had already made several minor films for RKO when Cooper signed her to a seven-year contract and cast her in the big-budget musical Flying Down to Rio (1933). Rogers was paired with Astaire, making his movie debut. Billed fourth and fifth respectively, the picture <b>turned</b> <b>them</b> <b>into</b> stars. Hermes Pan, assistant to the film's dance director, {{would become one of}} Hollywood's leading choreographers through his subsequent work with Astaire.|$|E

Eidos Interactive, whose release of Tomb Raider had <b>turned</b> <b>them</b> <b>into</b> a publishing giant, agreed to market and publish the port. The port was announced in December 1997, along with Eidos' exclusivity deal for North America and Europe at the time. To help the product stand out in stores, Eidos chose a triangular shape for the cover and box. They agreed on a contract price of $1.8 million, making initial sales forecasts of 100,000 units based on that outlay. The PC version was released in North America and Europe on June 25, 1998; the port was not released in Japan. Within one month, sales of the port exceeded the initial forecasts. The PC version would end up providing the source code for subsequent ports.|$|E

25|$|There {{were many}} herds and flocks. The flocks were {{committed}} to a shepherd, who gave receipt for them and took them out to pasture. The Code fixed his wage. He was responsible for all care, must restore ox for ox, sheep for sheep and must breed them satisfactorily. Any dishonest use of the flock had to be repaid tenfold, but loss due to disease or wild beasts fell upon the owner. The shepherd made good all loss due to his own neglect. If he let the flock feed on a field of crops, he had to pay damages fourfold; if he <b>turned</b> <b>them</b> <b>into</b> standing crops when {{they ought to have}} been folded, he paid twelvefold.|$|E
25|$|Homological {{methods and}} sheaf theory {{had already been}} {{introduced}} in algebraic geometry by Jean-Pierre Serre and others, after sheaves had been defined by Jean Leray. Grothendieck took them {{to a higher level}} of abstraction and <b>turned</b> <b>them</b> <b>into</b> a key organising principle of his theory. He shifted attention from the study of individual varieties to the relative point of view (pairs of varieties related by a morphism), allowing a broad generalization of many classical theorems. The first major application was the relative version of Serre's theorem showing that the cohomology of a coherent sheaf on a complete variety is finite-dimensional; Grothendieck's theorem shows that the higher direct images of coherent sheaves under a proper map are coherent; this reduces to Serre's theorem over a one-point space.|$|E

25|$|Nevertheless, {{details of}} how the Pythia {{operated}} are missing as authors from the classical period (6th to 4th centuries BC) treat the process as common knowledge with no need to explain. Those who discussed the oracle in any detail are from 1st century BC to 4th century AD and give conflicting stories. One of the main stories claimed that the Pythia delivered oracles in a frenzied state induced by vapours rising from a chasm in the rock, and that she spoke gibberish which priests interpreted as the enigmatic prophecies and <b>turned</b> <b>them</b> <b>into</b> poetic dactylic hexameters preserved in Greek literature. This idea, however, has been challenged by scholars such as Joseph Fontenrose and Lisa Maurizio, who argue that the ancient sources uniformly represent the Pythia speaking intelligibly, and giving prophecies in her own voice. Herodotus, writing in the fifth century BC describes the Pythia speaking in dactylic hexameters.|$|E
25|$|Shoshone {{was then}} taken further downriver, making the run over Celilo Falls, itself always {{reckoned}} a hazardous stretch, on June 28, 1870. Once below Celilo, she ran as a cattle boat between the upper Cascades and The Dalles. Later {{she was taken}} over the Cascades {{and down to the}} Willamette River, where she was sold to the Willamette River Transportation Company. The W.R.T. Co. then hauled Shoshone up around Willamette Falls, and ran her on the upper Willamette and also on the Yamhill River. There, perhaps surprisingly for a boat that had run Hells Canyon, she struck a rock near Salem, Oregon in the fall of 1874 and sank. Efforts to raise her failed, although her machinery was salvaged, and later installed in Champion. In January 1875, rising water lifted her free, and washed her down river to Lincoln. There a farmer salvaged her cabins, hauled them ashore, and <b>turned</b> <b>them</b> <b>into</b> a chicken coops.|$|E
25|$|Other notable {{films on}} which he worked during the early 1940s include: the {{original}} screenplay for very successful Buck Privates, a 1940 slapstick comedy starring Bud Abbott and Lou Costello, and which <b>turned</b> <b>them</b> <b>into</b> legitimate movie stars; the original screenplay for another Abbott and Costello vehicle, also in 1941, In the Navy, which also stars Dick Powell; one {{of a team of}} screenwriters for the 1941 musical comedy, Navy Blues, which stars Ann Sheridan, Jack Oakie, Jack Haley, and Martha Raye; one of three screenwriters for the 1942 war film, Captains of the Clouds, starring James Cagney and Dennis Morgan, and directed by Michael Curtiz; and the original screenplay for Raoul Walsh's 1942 Academy Award nominated Desperate Journey, starring Errol Flynn and Ronald Reagan. In 1943, according to the American Film Institute database, Horman made contributions to the screenplay for the Howard Hawks' film Air Force. The screenplay credit went to Dudley Nichols, who was nominated for an Academy Award. In 1944 he co-authored the screenplay for Dark Waters, a film noir starring Merle Oberon, Franchot Tone and Thomas Mitchell, based on the novel of the same name by Frank and Marian Cockrell. In August 1944, Horman signed a contract with Universal Studios, after having co-written, along with Bart Lytton and Edmund Joseph, the screenplay for the popular Universal musical, Bowery to Broadway, directed by Charles Lamont. His first film written specifically for Universal, was an adaptation of the James Roland novel, This Way Out, late in 1944, titled The Suspect, for which he received good reviews. The film was directed by Robert Siodmak, and starred Charles Laughton and Ella Raines. His next film at Universal saw him once again writing for Abbott & Costello. Released in early 1945, Here Come the Co-Eds was co-written by John Grant, from a story by Edmund Hartmann, and directed by Jean Yarbrough.|$|E

500|$|After the war, Babunski's Chetniks were {{dispatched}} to Kosovo and Macedonia, reinforcing the 50,000 soldiers {{that had been}} deployed to quell the armed uprisings there. Babunski's force of 250 men helped the authorities suppress resistance in the towns of Bitola and Tikveš, targeting locals sympathetic to the Bulgarian komitas, and committing several atrocities in the process. Forces under his command also committed several atrocities in Albania. Chetnik bands, including those of Babunski, are also said to have enslaved locals and <b>turned</b> <b>them</b> <b>into</b> forced labourers for {{the armed forces of}} the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes. By the summer of 1919, the authorities had decided that paramilitary formations such as Babunski's were not [...] "furthering the state's aims in the region".
