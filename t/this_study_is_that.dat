One issue with <b>this</b> <b>study</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> there was significant attrition of patients, with significantly larger numbers of dropouts from the TSF groups than from the others.|$|E
500|$|Misuse, problem use, abuse, {{and heavy}} {{use of alcohol}} refer to {{improper}} use of alcohol which may cause physical, social, or moral harm to the drinker. Moderate use is defined by The Dietary Guidelines for Americans as {{no more than two}} alcoholic beverages a day for men and no more than one alcoholic beverage a day for women. Some drinkers may drink more than 600 ml of alcohol per day during a heavy drinking period. The National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism (NIAAA) defines binge drinking as the amount of alcohol leading to a blood alcohol content (BAC) of 0.08, which, for most adults, would be reached by consuming five drinks for men or four for women over a two-hour period. According to the NIAAA, men may be at risk for alcohol-related problems if their alcohol consumption exceeds 14 standard drinks per week or 4 drinks per day, and women may be at risk if they have more than 7 standard drinks per week or 3 drinks per day. It defines a standard drink as one 12-ounce bottle of beer, one 5-ounce glass of wine, or 1.5ounces of distilled spirits. Despite this risk, a 2014 report in the National Survey on Drug Use and Health found that only 10% of either [...] "heavy drinkers" [...] or [...] "binge drinkers" [...] defined according to the above criteria also met the criteria for alcohol dependence, while only 1.3% of non-binge drinkers met the criteria. An inference drawn from <b>this</b> <b>study</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> evidence-based policy strategies and clinical preventive services may effectively reduce binge drinking without requiring addiction treatment in most cases.|$|E

30|$|A {{limitation}} of <b>this</b> <b>study</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> cone-beam computed tomography {{was not used}} to examine discision and piezocision cuts. Although cone-beam computed tomography is a reliable method in three-dimensional imaging, we did not prefer it to not give the patients extra radiation doses. Another {{limitation of}} <b>this</b> <b>study</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> disc saw may damage alveolar soft tissues, so the operator must consider it.|$|R
30|$|The most {{important}} finding of <b>this</b> <b>study</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> repairs performed with non-absorbable braided sutures resulted in less separation than with absorbable monofilament sutures when {{subjected to a}} loading protocol.|$|R
30|$|The primary {{finding of}} <b>this</b> <b>study</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> {{augmented}} EMG activity was observed during VH exercise, which {{was accompanied by}} muscle deoxygenation. These finding supports our hypothesis that VH during exercise enhances EMG responses.|$|R
2500|$|An {{important}} {{consequence of}} <b>this</b> <b>study</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> {{if we can}} find an affine transformation [...] such that [...] is a constant times the unit matrix, then we obtain a fixed-point that is invariant to affine transformations (Lindeberg 1994 section 15.4; Lindeberg and Garding 1997).

2500|$|The reduced size {{of brain}} {{structures}} associated with memory and attention was also noted through {{magnetic resonance imaging}} (MRI), a process used to produce images of the brain for observation. [...] For example, those with prenantal meth exposure had, on average, a smaller hippocampus (a brain structure involved in many things, including memory) than control participants. This reduction in size was correlated with poorer sustained attention (decreased ability {{to focus on a}} single task for a period of time) and delayed verbal memory (memory of words read or heard). The conclusion from <b>this</b> <b>study</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> prenatal meth exposure can be neurotoxic to the developing fetus brain.|$|E
2500|$|According to the NIAAA {{definition}} of [...] "heavy drinkers", men {{may be at}} risk for alcohol-related problems if their alcohol consumption exceeds 14 standard drinks per week or 4 drinks per day, and women {{may be at risk}} if they have more than 7 standard drinks per week or 3 drinks per day.

30|$|The most {{significant}} finding of <b>this</b> <b>study</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> the lever sign test {{is a new}} test with higher sensitivity than the Lachman test which can be applied easily both under anaesthesia and without anaesthesia.|$|R
30|$|The most {{important}} findings in <b>this</b> <b>study</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> longer duration of anesthesia affected {{the duration of}} postoperative hospital stay in morbidly obese patients. In addition, patients with BMI ≥  50 may experience longer durations of hospitalization after surgery.|$|R
30|$|The {{strength}} of <b>this</b> <b>study</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> it provided quantitative data on when patients returned to work, {{and the nature}} of work performed after hip and knee arthroplasty. It also provided patient perspectives on what influenced their RTW.|$|R
5000|$|One {{of the key}} {{conclusions}} of <b>this</b> <b>study</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> [...] "Effective management of the consequences ofcatastrophes {{would appear to be}} a more significant factor than whether catastrophe insurance hedges the economic impact of the catastrophe".|$|E
50|$|One of {{the major}} {{advantages}} of <b>this</b> <b>study</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> it has been conducted very consistently {{over a long period}} of time. Experimentation over several decades allows for the occurrence of natural events, such as El Niño droughts, which are important facilitators of natural disturbance that could affect fragmentation.|$|E
50|$|A notable {{limitation}} of <b>this</b> <b>study</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> the researchers examined young adults, {{rather than the}} population at-large. According to the researchers, young adults in Japan are more active participants in a more global, Americanized culture than the older generations. This could explain the commonalities found between young adults in Japan and the US.|$|E
30|$|One of the {{limitations}} of <b>this</b> <b>study</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> the left ventricular function was assessed on only short axis slices in echocardiography, because remodeling and dilation mainly occur on the apical part of the ventricle after anterior myocardial infarction.|$|R
30|$|The null {{hypotheses}} for <b>this</b> <b>study</b> <b>were</b> <b>that</b> (1) there <b>is</b> {{no significant}} difference about occurrence of canine displacement in subjects with dental agenesis compared with a control group and (2) hypodontia {{does not have a}} role in maxillary canine impaction.|$|R
30|$|This {{prospective}} and randomized {{study reported}} {{the effect of}} LP-PRP, HA {{and the use of}} oral NSAID on osteoarthritis of the knee. The most important finding of <b>this</b> <b>study</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> a single course of LP-PRP resulted in clinical efficacy (a reduction of pain and an improvement in physical function) in patients with early osteoarthritis at the 52 -week follow-up. Another important result of <b>this</b> <b>study</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> a single dose of LP-PRP had a superior clinical effect over a single dose of HA and the use of oral NSAID. In this sense, the response to LP-PRP in all the clinical scores (pain, stiffness and physical function) was better than the response to HA and NSAID.|$|R
50|$|Electrophoretic studies did not link Chrysocyon {{with any}} of the other living canids studied. One {{conclusion}} of <b>this</b> <b>study</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> the maned wolf is the only species among the large South American canids that survived the late Pleistocene extinction. Fossils of the maned wolf from the Holocene and the late Pleistocene have been excavated from the Brazilian Highlands.|$|E
50|$|One {{important}} implication from <b>this</b> <b>study</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> {{countries can}} be clustered {{according to their}} preference for power. Besides this, some of their differences {{can be explained by}} the influence of the following factors: the predominant religion or philosophy, an established tradition of democracy, the long-term existence of a middle class, and the proportion of immigrants in each country.|$|E

30|$|The {{hypothesis}} for <b>this</b> <b>study</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> 3 D DIC {{would be}} as accurate as LVDT’s in determining longitudinal strain in het human Achilles tendon and that 3 D DIC would enable a full field multi-directional strain analysis of the tendon tissue.|$|R
30|$|The main {{findings}} of <b>this</b> <b>study</b> <b>are</b> <b>that</b> GR expression <b>is</b> upregulated in T lymphocytes during septic shock regardless of steroid treatment and that GR binding capacity is decreased in neutrophils after the inflammatory phase {{in patients who}} have been treated with steroids.|$|R
50|$|A {{recent study}} has {{investigated}} {{the role of}} mPRβ in regulating in vitro maturation (IVM) of pig cumulus-oocyte complexes (COCs). This study suggests that the mPRβ is a molecule related to cumulus expansion and it might function by regulation of exocytosis. The conclusion of <b>this</b> <b>study</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> mPRβ might {{play an important role}} on the function of the protein.|$|E
50|$|Another study, Song Recognition among Preschool-Age Children: An Investigation of Words and Music {{investigated}} {{relationships between}} words and pitch and melody recognition. The {{study found that}} preschool children more accurately recognized songs performed without texts when they had heard them performed previously with texts. Another conclusion from <b>this</b> <b>study</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> district melodies were more easily recognized than similar melodies, regardless if the melodies had text.|$|E
50|$|One of {{the more}} {{significant}} findings to emerge from <b>this</b> <b>study</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> the students were motivated to reading and by this means improved their foreign language skills {{during the process of}} this research. They experienced a different atmosphere of practicing language. They did similar assignments as they did before but this time for a more realistic purpose and in a more authentic environment.|$|E
30|$|The {{hypothesis}} of <b>this</b> <b>study</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> early treatment with MSCs in a murine model of acid-induced lung injury might exert short- and long-term beneficial effects by modulation of the inflammatory response and {{that lack of}} PTX 3 in MSCs might reduce their efficacy.|$|R
2500|$|As {{a result}} of this controversy, the ATOC program {{conducted}} a $6 million study {{of the effects of the}} acoustic transmissions on a variety of marine mammals. [...] After six years of study the official, formal conclusion from <b>this</b> <b>study</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> the ATOC transmissions have [...] "no significant biological impact".|$|R
30|$|The {{most obvious}} finding of <b>this</b> <b>study</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> both THA groups with near perfect PROMs could not achieve a top walking speed of healthy controls. This reconfirms the ceiling effects of PROMs and {{highlights}} the importance for the need of other metrics to detect differences in performance following hip arthroplasty.|$|R
5000|$|The loss of {{the short}} arm of {{chromosome}} 1, the part of chromosome 1 that C1orf123 is located on, cause and parathyroid gland tumorigenesis resulting in hyperparathyroidism. 60% of the tumors tested showed an alteration on either 1p or the MEN1 locus or both. The conclusion of <b>this</b> <b>study</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> the short arm of chromosome 1 contains at least two different tumor suppressor genes involved in parathyroid tumorigenesis.|$|E
50|$|The main {{limitation}} of <b>this</b> <b>study</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> it is a self-report measure {{which means that}} answers and results may be biased. Another limitation is that one version is filled out by a child and depending on the age and maturity of the child they may have trouble recognizing the frequency or severity of both external and internal symptom presentation. The parent may also be limited in recognizing the internal symptoms of their child's anxiety.|$|E
5000|$|An {{important}} {{consequence of}} <b>this</b> <b>study</b> <b>is</b> <b>that</b> {{if we can}} find an affine transformation [...] such that [...] is a constant times the unit matrix, then we obtain a fixed-point that is invariant to affine transformations (Lindeberg 1994 section 15.4; Lindeberg and Garding 1997).

30|$|The aim of our <b>study</b> <b>was</b> {{to assess}} the {{effectiveness}} of fascia iliaca compartment block (FICB) for prevention of perioperative delirium in hip surgery patients who were at intermediate or high risk for this complication. The main hypothesis tested in <b>this</b> <b>study</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> FICB prophylaxis reduces delirium incidence in hip fracture patients.|$|R
30|$|The {{limitation}} of <b>this</b> <b>study</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> we included the implants <b>that</b> <b>were</b> not loaded. Potential limitations can arise from smoking or nonsmoking, differentiation of the sinus septa, or the systemic {{disease of the}} patients. Thus, for future studies, evaluation of the prognosis after loading and clinical outcomes by prognosis factor is necessary.|$|R
5|$|Another {{finding of}} <b>this</b> <b>study</b> <b>was</b> <b>that</b> Aetosauroides lies outside Stagonolepididae. If this {{phylogeny}} is correct, Stagonolepididae and Aetosauria {{would not be}} equivalent groupings, and Aetosauroides {{would be the first}} non-stagonolepidid aetosaur. The following cladogram simplified after an analysis presented by Julia B. Desojo, Martin D. Ezcurra and Edio E. Kischlat (2012).|$|R
