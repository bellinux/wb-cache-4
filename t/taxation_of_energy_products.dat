40|$|The use {{of energy}} {{taxation}} {{as an instrument}} in environmental policy has increased drastically {{over the past decade}} or so. Against this backdrop, the objective of this report is to map the use of energy related taxation at the EU level and in cental Member States, and to understand the driving forces and barriers governing the use of these instruments. In so doing, the study focuses on political processes at both the national and supranational level that influence the use and evolution of energy taxation. The report first gives a brief introduction to the negotiations on <b>taxation</b> <b>of</b> <b>energy</b> <b>products</b> in the EU. It then focuses on the levels of taxation in the Member States, esepecially the taxation of electricity production and consumption for industries and households. Country profiles are provided for all Member States, allowing for easy comparison and in-depth studies of domestic energy taxation systems.

Next chapter competition duties on mineral oils focuses on the development of tax rates on mineral oils, the mobility of the tax base and the related variability in rates over time and between countries.

40|$|The European Commission {{is going}} to discuss a {{revision}} of Directive 2003 / 96 / EC, restructuring the Community framework for the <b>taxation</b> <b>of</b> <b>energy</b> <b>products</b> and electricity. The first proposals include a new energy taxation system, where the current energy tax {{is divided into two}} components - an energy component and a CO 2 component. This article first presents theoretical concepts regarding environmental and CO 2 taxation; then it concentrates on current national systems of CO 2 taxation in European Union Member States with a focus on the energy and transport sectors. After making an overview of CO 2 taxation, the article focuses on a comparison of national systems of CO 2 taxation and indicates similarities in the taxes in their application in both the energy and transport sectors. The authors deal with all taxes that have their current tax base based on CO 2 emissions or have CO 2 emissions as one part of their tax base. The analysis is provided for a period until the end of 2009. Finally, the results of the comparison of CO 2 taxation are discussed. The article also includes a brief overview of existing ex-post analysis of CO 2 taxation in the Nordic countries of the European Union. transport, taxation, European Union, energy, comparison, CO 2 emissions...|$|E

New energy taxes are imposed on electricity, solid fuels and natural gas, with term of initiation on 1 st January 2008. This paper discusses impact of new energy taxation on sectors NACE in the Czech Republic, particularly on prices of production. I have created the simple short-term price model for the Czech Republic, {{which is based on}} input-output methodology by Leontief. The paper is divided into six parts. The first part is introduction, where are formulated both the main target of the paper and two hypotheses for testing. The theoretical problems, which are connected with the impact of taxation and tax incidence, are discussed in the second part. The third part describes possibilities of analysing and modelling in the area of changes of tax system and tax rates. In the fourth part I describe the methodology and then I am creating the short-term price model for the Czech Republic. The next part consists of the main results, emerged from the price model and the two hypothesis testing, with focus on energy intensive sectors of NACE.

40|$|Mechanisms {{of global}} changes on energy markets are reviewed.

This evolves despite availability <b>of</b> <b>energy</b> resources and fluctuating real prices <b>of</b> fossil <b>energy.</b> The valorization evolves when the higher costs <b>of</b> <b>energy</b> resources are outweighed by even higher value <b>of</b> <b>energy</b> <b>products</b> as perceived and purchased by customers. The valorization on energy markets is expressed as electrification, entry <b>of</b> variable renewable <b>energy</b> technologies and distributed energy systems for local energy production and consumption.

40|$|The {{concern on}} climate change and on the {{limitations}} of fossil fuels is leading to the promotion <b>of</b> renewable-based <b>energy</b> options. However, the assessment <b>of</b> the <b>energy</b> profitability <b>of</b> a technology is still a controversial topic, espe-cially when renewable-based systems are compared with non-renewable ones and when the depletion of the stocks of available resources is not accounted properly.

A set of life cycle-based indicators is proposed in order to establish a more reliable approach to the assessment <b>of</b> <b>energy</b> <b>products</b> which decouples the different contributions given by renewable and non-renewable resources. The proposed set of indicators has been quantified for different groups <b>of</b> <b>energy</b> <b>products</b> and compared with an en-ergy indicator frequently used (i. e. EROI).
