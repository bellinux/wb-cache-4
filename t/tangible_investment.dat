40|$|This master thesis {{deals with}} lease {{financing}} {{as one of}} the possible forms to acquire <b>tangible</b> <b>investment</b> goods. Furthermore other possibilities such as credit, hire purchase and cash purchase are evaluated. Based on the offers and other conditions proposed by companies, the objective of our investigation is to judge advantages and disadvantages of the individual financing products and choose the best option for enterprisers. The car was chosen {{as an example of the}} <b>tangible</b> <b>investment</b> good. This thesis is divided into two sections. The first theoretical part is focused on the particular possibilities of the financing of the <b>tangible</b> <b>investment</b> good and their tax and law aspects as well as their advantages and disadvantages. The second practical part is based on analysis of the leasing and credit products from following institutions: UniCredit Leasing CZ, a. s., CSOB Leasing, a. s., Credium, a. s. and Commercial Bank, a. s. The conditions and services provided by these companies are compared at the beginning. Calculations are performed for the particular car. The comparison is made from the point of view of all financial costs as well as discounted costs. Finally, all products are compared and evaluated not only according to their financial aspects but also according to other offered conditions and services...|$|E
40|$|The {{traditional}} categorisation of expenditures {{evident in}} many firms’ charts of accounts and financial statements does not identify and measure expenditures on intangible investment separately from <b>tangible</b> <b>investment</b> and operating expenditures. This {{contrasts with the}} accounting for <b>tangible</b> <b>investment,</b> which separately accounts for all expenditures as assets unless the future benefits are consumed in a single accounting period. Further, in searching for better ways to account for intangibles, regulators and researchers {{have focused on the}} accounting choice problem relating to the existence and recognisability of intangible assets. In this paper, we argue that identifying and separately reporting the expenditures on intangible investment is the logical first step in accounting for intangible investments. Learning about the firm’s categories of value driving (and sometimes potentially value destroying) expenditures has important implications for understanding aspects of the value chain, performance measurement, valuation, corporate governance and the external audit...|$|E
40|$|The paper {{discusses}} {{the link between}} financing R&D and <b>tangible</b> <b>investment,</b> firm size, and corporate governance. Mechanisms of corporate governance, such {{as the presence of}} large shareholders or stakeholders, may reduce agency and specificity problems and improve access to external finance. High ownership concentration, cross-shareholdings of industrial firms, and banks as blockholders are main features of the German system of corporate governance. This network-orientation is often seen as alleviating agency problems and providing sufficient finance for risky long-term investment such as R&D. However, no empirical evidence has been presented yet supporting this claim. Therefore, we base our empirical analysis on a panel data set of 106 large and medium-sized German companies, which reported R&D investment throughout the period 1987 to 1993. We find evidence that R&D and <b>tangible</b> <b>investment</b> of owner-controlled firms is constrained by the availability of internal and external funds. No such liquidity constraints are found for manager-controlled firms. Further, for these firms we observe a significant negative impact of firm size and market concentration on R&D investment, rejecting the Neo-Schumpeter hypotheses.

40|$|The {{relation}} between a firm’s stock return and its intangible assets is derived under the intangible-asset-augmented q-theory framework.

Two features of intangible assets, adjustment costs and investment-specific-technological-change, are crucial to the improved model performance. Second, higher R&D intensity, defined as the ratio of R&D expenditure to intangible assets, leads to lower stock returns. Third, the q-theory augmented with intangible investments gives a more reasonable estimate of adjustment costs of <b>tangible</b> <b>investments</b> than the conventional q-theory does. Fourth, the magnitude of adjustment costs of R&D investments {{is estimated to be}} larger than that of <b>tangible</b> <b>investments...</b>|$|R

However, to date, no {{studies have examined}} interdependence processes within the relationship as a mechanism underlying this association. The present research investigates the role of planned <b>tangible</b> <b>investments</b> as a mediator between social class and relationship quality. Across two studies, we test this hypothesis correlationally (Study 1) and experimentally (Study 2). As predicted, lower-class individuals reported fewer planned <b>tangible</b> <b>investments,</b> which in turn were associated with lower relationship satisfaction and commitment (Studies 1 and 2), as well as overall satisfaction with life (Study 2).

In particular, GTIS-enhanced TFP affects the probability of exporting in foreign markets characterized by more stringent environmental regulation.

40|$|This paper uses a new {{cross-country}} cross-industry dataset {{on investment}} in {{tangible and intangible assets}} for 18 European {{countries and the}} US. We set out a framework for measuring intangible investment and capital stocks and their effect on output, inputs and total factor productivity. The analysis provides evidence on the diffusion of intangible investment across Europe and the US over the years 2000 - 2013 and offers growth accounting evidence before and after the Great Recession in 2008 - 2009. Our major findings are the following. First, <b>tangible</b> <b>investment</b> fell massively during the Great Recession and has hardly recovered, whereas intangible investment has been relatively resilient and recovered fast in the US but lagged behind in the EU. Second, the sources of growth analysis including only national account intangibles (software, R&D, mineral exploration and artistic originals), suggest that capital deepening is the main driver of growth, with tangibles and intangibles accounting for 80 % and 20 % in the EU while both account for 50 % in the US, over 2000 - 2013. Extending the asset boundary to the intangible assets not included in the national accounts (Corrado, Hulten and Sichel (2005)) makes capital deepening increases. The contribution of tangibles is reduced both in the EU and the US (60 % and 40 % respectively) while intangibles account for a larger share (40 % in EU and 60 % in the US). Then, our analysis shows that since the Great Recession, the slowdown in labour productivity growth has been driven by a decline in TFP growth with relatively a minor role for tangible and intangible capital. Finally, we document a significant correlation between stricter employment protection rules and less government investment in R&D, and a lower ratio of intangible to <b>tangible</b> <b>investment...</b>|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Nowadays, {{almost any}} kind of {{enterprise}} is facing the challenge of information- and communication technology (ICT) investment issues. However, taking the appropriate ICT-investment decisions is often beyond the Small and Midsize Enterprises ’ (SME) decision-makers. Current research struggles with an easy-to-use methodology that helps identifying the technologies able to provide a real value-added to the enterprise. At this aim, the present paper intends {{to fill the gap}} by proposing a decision-support tool for Chief Information Officers of SMEs. By focusing intentionally and exclusively on information systems (IS), this tool gives <b>tangible</b> <b>investment</b> recommendations based on both the enterprise’s current level of IS-acquisition and its respective financial return. Finally, we plan to offer a benchmark "cockpit " able to compare the results of each enterprise with its competitors in order to identify necessary steps towards an optimal level of technology implementation. 1...|$|E

40|$|Following the {{approach}} of Corrado, Hulten, and Sichel (2005, 2006), we measure intangible investment and examine the contribution of intangible capital to economic growth in Japan.

40|$|In {{response}} to technological change, U. S. corporations have been investing more in intangible capital. This transformation is empirically {{associated with lower}} leverage and greater cash holdings, and commonly explained as a precautionary {{response to}} reduced debt capacity. We model how firms' payout and cash holding policies are affected by this shift. Our insight is {{that the creation of}} intangibles is largely achieved by human capital investment and requires lower upfront outlays. Firms can self-finance the retention of human capital by granting deferred equity compensation. Interestingly, retaining cash and repurchasing shares enhances the value of unvested equity, thereby facilitating retention and reducing equity dilution. Our empirical evidence confirms that firms with higher intangible investment have lower upfront investment needs. They make similar payouts as <b>tangible</b> <b>investment</b> firms, suggesting they are not on average more financially constrained. They also tend to grant more deferred equity and prioritize repurchases over dividends in particular when their stock volatility is high, in line with our model's predictions...|$|E
40|$|This report studies various {{categories}} of intangible investment {{in tandem with}} micro-level data available for research purposes at Statistics Finland. Already at the firm level the amount of intangible investment exceeds that of <b>tangible</b> <b>investment,</b> and taking it into account changes our understanding of many key measures : for example the adjusted value added of the business sector is nearly ten per cent higher than the unadjusted one. R&D is roughly one-third of business sector intangible investment, but the share of software and in-house programming is almost as large. Investments in relation to advertising and marketing are also quite sizable. Categories of intangible investments are interrelated : for example internal R&D is not only related to external purchases of R&D inputs but also to employee training, software investment and programming, as well as advertising and marketing. The approach of this report, based on an extensive mass-imputation of the various missing firm-level values, seems like a promising avenue for further research. intangible capital, firm investment, national accounts...|$|E
