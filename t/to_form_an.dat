5|$|A turn-of-the-20th-century {{apartment}} construction boom {{allowed the}} expansion of Chicago's African American ghetto southward, and the original inhabitants mostly left the area.

Some white Protestants left <b>to</b> <b>form</b> <b>an</b> exclusive residential community in the South Shore community area. In 1906 they formed the South Shore Country Club, which excluded Blacks and Jews from membership.|$|E

In 1929, the club played its first international encounter, against Portuguese club Vitória de Setúbal, winning 3–1 in a match played at the Presidente Antônio Carlos Stadium. The ground had opened earlier that year, and would be the club's home for the following two decades.|$|E

The workpiece and the electrode melts forming a pool of molten metal (weld pool) that cools to form a joint. As the weld is laid, the flux coating of the electrode disintegrates, giving off vapors that serve as a shielding gas and providing a layer of slag, both of which protect the weld area from atmospheric contamination.|$|E

5|$|At {{the end of}} May 1945, the {{division}} was pulled out of Germany and returned to England. It was initially intended {{to send them to}} India <b>to</b> <b>form</b> <b>an</b> airborne corps with the 44th Indian Airborne Division. The division’s advance party, formed around the 5th Parachute Brigade, had already arrived in India. Following the Japanese surrender, all these plans changed. The post-war British Army only needed one airborne division, and the 6th Airborne was chosen to remain on strength. Reinforced by the 2nd Parachute Brigade, {{the division}} was sent to the Middle East as the Imperial Strategic Reserve.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} the war in Europe, it {{had been}} planned to send the {{division}} to Burma <b>to</b> <b>form</b> <b>an</b> airborne corps with the 44th Indian Airborne Division. However, the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, and the Japanese surrender, ended the war and changed British plans. The 6th Airborne Division was nominated to be the Imperial Strategic Reserve. Together with a Royal Air Force troop-carrier formation, they were to be located in the Middle East as a quick reaction peace keeping force for the British Empire. Initially No. 283 Wing RAF had two squadrons of transport aircraft, 620 and 644, available to provide troop transport.|$|E
5|$|At their 2007 meeting, the BCHL {{board of}} {{governors}} rejected moving the Williams Lake TimberWolves to Dawson Creek, but then voted to allow the move if the Burnaby Express (who was also seeking relocation) moved to Fort St. John. However, the Society {{was not able to}} recruit sufficient support in Fort St. John <b>to</b> <b>form</b> <b>an</b> ownership group and the Burnaby Express re-arranged its management and ownership so that it could stay in Burnaby. The Williams Lake TimberWolves, after one year of dormancy, relocated to Wenatchee, Washington. Efforts at relocating an Alberta Junior Hockey League team were also unsuccessful as no team expressed interest in moving at that time.|$|E

This would significantly extend the definition beyond the ICD-10 and DSM-IV-TR definitions because those definitions are limited to situations where the child has no attachment or no attachment to a specified attachment figure.|$|E
5|$|Crystalline solids {{cohesion}} {{is obtained}} by a metallic or chemical bond which is formed between the constituent atoms. Chemical bonds can be grouped into two types consisting of ionic and covalent. <b>To</b> <b>form</b> <b>an</b> ionic bond, either a valence or bonding electron separates from one atom and becomes attached to another atom to form oppositely charged ions. The bonding in the static position {{is when the}} ions occupy an equilibrium position where the resulting force between them is zero. When the ions are exerted in tension force, the inter-ionic spacing increases creating an electrostatic attractive force, while a repulsing force under compressive force between the atomic nuclei is dominant.|$|E
