5|$|As {{in the oil}} sector, India's {{state-owned}} companies {{account for}} the bulk of natural gas production. ONGC and Oil India Ltd. (OIL) are the leading companies with respect to production volume, whilst some foreign companies take part in upstream developments in joint-ventures and production sharing contracts (PSCs). Reliance Industries, a privately owned Indian company, will also have a bigger role in <b>the</b> <b>natural</b> <b>gas</b> sector {{as a result of a}} large natural gas find in 2002 in the Krishna Godavari basin.|$|E
5|$|As with electricity, <b>the</b> <b>natural</b> <b>gas</b> {{distribution}} network is also now all-island, with a pipeline linking Gormanston, County Meath, and Ballyclare, County Antrim completed in 2007. Most of Ireland's gas comes through interconnectors between Twynholm in Scotland and Ballylumford, County Antrim and Loughshinny, County Dublin. A decreasing supply {{is coming from}} the Kinsale gas field off the County Cork coast and the Corrib Gas Field off the coast of County Mayo has yet to come on-line. The County Mayo field is facing some localised opposition over a controversial decision to refine the gas onshore.|$|E
5|$|The Great Recession and {{the turmoil}} {{caused by the}} Arab Spring have {{depressed}} Jordan's GDP growth, damaging trade, industry, construction and tourism. Tourist arrivals have dropped sharply since 2011. Jordan's finances have also been severely strained by 32 attacks on <b>the</b> <b>natural</b> <b>gas</b> pipeline in Sinai supplying Jordan from Egypt by Islamic State affiliates, causing it to substitute more expensive heavy-fuel oils to generate electricity. In November 2012, the government cut subsidies on fuel, increasing its price. The decision, which was later revoked, caused large scale protests to break out across the country.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThis paper {{presents}} {{the application of}} a sociotechnical modeling framework to capture regional dependencies in <b>the</b> international <b>natural</b> <b>gas</b> market in context with the global energy marketplace at large. Soft systems methods were used to produce conceptual models of flow and interaction in order to inform the design of analytical models. First, this research project captured and analyzed <b>the</b> flows of <b>natural</b> <b>gas</b> in international markets by developing a conceptual model of <b>the</b> global <b>natural</b> <b>gas</b> infrastructure and future growth options at the regional level. Policies, players, infrastructure, and markets all exist at the global, regional, and national level to make up <b>the</b> present-day <b>natural</b> <b>gas</b> landscape. Second, <b>the</b> research team worked to model <b>the</b> overall global <b>natural</b> <b>gas</b> sociotechnical enterprise and its future growth options to understand the regional versus global interdependencies and their likely effect on <b>the</b> changing <b>natural</b> <b>gas</b> landscape. <b>The</b> results capture emerging trends in the system that may not be obvious without a systemic analysis and capture gaps in existing predictive models of system performance...|$|R
30|$|The {{sensitivity}} {{analysis of the}} influencing factors on the total consumption and consumption structure of <b>natural</b> <b>gas</b> in different scenarios indicates that economic development still {{plays a major role}} in promoting <b>the</b> growth of <b>natural</b> <b>gas</b> consumption. In addition, the accelerating urbanization process impacts obviously on the demand for urban gas, while <b>the</b> promotion of <b>natural</b> <b>gas</b> utilization technology can effectively reduce <b>the</b> total <b>natural</b> <b>gas</b> consumption.|$|R
5|$|A {{government}} inquiry {{was undertaken}} {{to determine the}} future use of the pipelines, and took evidence from the various stakeholders, most of whom presented the case that favored their companies or industry. The inquiry concluded that the pipelines should be sold for continued use in transporting petroleum. An auction for the pipelines was announced in 1946, {{which was designed to}} give preference to bidders who intended to use them for moving petroleum. 16 bids were received, with the highest cash bidders being companies hoping to use the pipelines for natural gas. Assessing the different bids proved difficult and the discussions became enmeshed in national politics, with companies seeking support from various Washington politicians. Meanwhile, a threatened national coal strike raised concerns over the availability of natural gas, strengthening the arguments of <b>the</b> <b>natural</b> <b>gas</b> lobby.|$|E
5|$|Gabriel initiates {{a second}} {{broadcast}} by showing a simulated {{explosion of the}} U.S. Capitol building, causing a public panic. Farrell guesses that his next target is likely the power grid, and the two drive to a utility superstation in West Virginia. They find {{a team led by}} Mai taking over the station. McClane manages to kill all of them, including Mai. He obtains video footage of Gabriel which he relays to the FBI. Enraged over Mai's death, Gabriel seizes control of <b>the</b> <b>natural</b> <b>gas</b> distribution system and redirects all of the gas into the station. McClane and Farrell escape before the station explodes, leaving much of the eastern seaboard of the United States and Canada without power.|$|E
5|$|In 1985, Kenneth Lay merged <b>the</b> <b>natural</b> <b>gas</b> {{pipeline}} {{companies of}} Houston Natural Gas and InterNorth to form Enron. In the early 1990s, {{he helped to}} initiate the selling of electricity at market prices, and soon after, the United States Congress approved legislation deregulating the sale of natural gas. The resulting markets {{made it possible for}} traders such as Enron to sell energy at higher prices, thereby significantly increasing its revenue. After producers and local governments decried the resultant price volatility and asked for increased regulation, strong lobbying on the part of Enron and others prevented such regulation.|$|E
50|$|Of {{the lower}} 48 US states, those with <b>the</b> most <b>natural</b> <b>gas</b> {{pipeline}} running through them are Texas (58,588 miles), Louisiana (18,900), Oklahoma (18,539), Kansas (15,386), Illinois (11,900) and California (11,770). The states with <b>the</b> least <b>natural</b> <b>gas</b> pipeline are Vermont and New Hampshire.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> raw <b>natural</b> <b>gas</b> {{feedstock}} from a {{gas well}} {{or a group}} of wells is cooled to lower the gas temperature to below its hydrocarbon dew point at the feedstock pressure. This condenses {{a large part of the}} gas condensate hydrocarbons. The feedstock mixture of gas, liquid condensate and water is then routed to a high pressure separator vessel where the water and <b>the</b> raw <b>natural</b> <b>gas</b> are separated and removed. <b>The</b> raw <b>natural</b> <b>gas</b> from <b>the</b> high pressure separator is sent to the main gas compressor.|$|R
30|$|<b>The</b> world’s <b>natural</b> <b>gas</b> {{reserves}} are equal to 186.6 trillion cubic meters (6588.8 trillion cubic feet) of <b>natural</b> <b>gas</b> at <b>the</b> end of 2016. According to [7], the total {{figure of the}} Middle East region proven <b>natural</b> <b>gas</b> reserves is equal to 87.2 trillion cubic meters, which are 46.7 % of global <b>natural</b> <b>gas</b> reserves. <b>The</b> per-capital <b>natural</b> <b>gas</b> resource in this region is 193777 cubic meters. The reserves/production ratio is 124.5. <b>The</b> proven <b>natural</b> <b>gas</b> reserve in 1980 was about 25.6 trillion cubic meters. It {{has been more than}} tripled to 87.2 trillion cubic meters in 2016. The similar pattern also applies to oil reserve in this region.|$|R
5|$|A more {{progressive}} extraction process involves directly reducing manganese ore {{in a heap}} leach. This is done by percolating natural gas through {{the bottom of the}} heap; <b>the</b> <b>natural</b> <b>gas</b> provides the heat (needs to be at least 850°C) and the reducing agent (carbon monoxide). This reduces all of the manganese ore to manganese oxide (MnO), which is a leachable form. The ore then travels through a grinding circuit to reduce the particle size of the ore to between 150–250 μm, increasing the surface area to aid leaching. The ore is then added to a leach tank of sulfuric acid and ferrous iron (Fe2+) in a 1.6:1 ratio. The iron reacts with the manganese dioxide to form iron hydroxide and elemental manganese. This process yields approximately 92% recovery of the manganese. For further purification, the manganese can then be sent to an electrowinning facility.|$|E
5|$|Helium was {{discovered}} in 1868 by French astronomer Pierre Janssen, who first detected the substance as an unknown yellow spectral line signature in light from a solar eclipse. In 1903, large reserves of helium were found in <b>the</b> <b>natural</b> <b>gas</b> fields of the United States, which {{is by far the}} largest supplier of the gas. The substance is used in cryogenics, in deep-sea breathing systems, to cool superconducting magnets, in helium dating, for inflating balloons, for providing lift in airships, and as a protective gas for industrial uses such as arc welding and growing silicon wafers. Inhaling a small volume of the gas temporarily changes the timbre and quality of the human voice. The behavior of liquid helium-4's two fluid phases, helium I and helium II, is important to researchers studying quantum mechanics and the phenomenon of superfluidity in particular, and to those looking at the effects that temperatures near absolute zero have on matter, such as with superconductivity.|$|E
25|$|Natural {{gas flowing}} in the {{distribution}} lines and at <b>the</b> <b>natural</b> <b>gas</b> well head are often used to power natural gas powered engines. These engines rotate compressors to facilitate <b>the</b> <b>natural</b> <b>gas</b> transmission. These compressors are required in the mid-stream line to pressurize and to re-pressurize <b>the</b> <b>natural</b> <b>gas</b> in the transmission line as the gas travels. <b>The</b> <b>natural</b> <b>gas</b> transmission lines extend to <b>the</b> <b>natural</b> <b>gas</b> processing plant or unit which removes the higher molecular weighted natural gas hydrocarbons to produce a British thermal unit (BTU) value between 950 and 1050BTUs. The processed natural gas may then be used for residential, commercial and industrial uses.|$|E
50|$|On {{the present-day}} {{territory}} of Romania, <b>the</b> first <b>natural</b> <b>gas</b> deposit {{was discovered in}} 1908, in Sărmăşel, Mureş County (then in Austria-Hungary), further to geological researches on potassium salts. A prodigious period followed for the gas distribution business and the year 1941 marks the construction of <b>the</b> first <b>natural</b> <b>gas</b> pipeline from Măneşti to Bucharest, while the following year a main pipeline is built for <b>the</b> transportation of <b>natural</b> <b>gas</b> from Transylvania to the capital city.|$|R
25|$|<b>Natural</b> <b>gas</b> {{was first}} {{discovered}} in the United States in 1626, when the French explorers found Native Americans setting gas on fire that leaked into Lake Erie. In 1816, the U.S. first lighted the streets of Baltimore, Maryland. Then in 1821, <b>the</b> first successful <b>natural</b> <b>gas</b> well was dug in Fredonia, New York, which allowed for <b>the</b> American <b>natural</b> <b>gas</b> distribution company to be built there in 1858. And then in 1836, <b>the</b> first city-owned <b>natural</b> <b>gas</b> distribution company was created in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. While during <b>the</b> 1800s, <b>natural</b> <b>gas</b> was used mainly for lighting streets and homes, the creation of pipelines in the 1900s allowed for extensive use of it in home appliances, manufacturing plants, and boilers.|$|R
50|$|Natural-gas {{condensate}} is a low-density {{mixture of}} hydrocarbon liquids that are present as gaseous components in <b>the</b> raw <b>natural</b> <b>gas</b> produced from many <b>natural</b> <b>gas</b> fields. Some gas species within <b>the</b> raw <b>natural</b> <b>gas</b> will condense to a liquid state if {{the temperature is}} reduced to below the hydrocarbon dew point temperature at a set pressure.|$|R
25|$|Often mid-stream {{and well}} head gases require removal {{of many of}} the various {{hydrocarbon}} species contained within <b>the</b> <b>natural</b> <b>gas.</b> Some of these gases include heptane, pentane, propane and other hydrocarbons with molecular weights above Methane (CH4) to produce a natural gas fuel which is used to operate <b>the</b> <b>natural</b> <b>gas</b> engines for further pressurized transmission. Typically, natural gas compressors require 950 to 1050BTU per cubic foot to operate at <b>the</b> <b>natural</b> <b>gas</b> engines rotational name plate specifications.|$|E

40|$|In 1997, the Comisi 3 n Reguladora de Energ of Mexico {{implemented}} a netback rule for linking <b>the</b> Mexican <b>natural</b> <b>gas</b> price to <b>the</b> Texas price. At the time, the Texas price reflected a reasonably competitive market. Since that time, {{there have been}} dramatic increases in <b>the</b> demand for <b>natural</b> <b>gas</b> and there are various bottlenecks in <b>the</b> supply of <b>natural</b> <b>gas.</b> As a result, <b>the</b> price of <b>natural</b> <b>gas</b> in Texas now reflects the quasi-rents created by these bottlenecks. We address the optimality of the netback rule {{when the price of}} gas at the Texas market reflects the quasi-rents created by bottlenecks in <b>the</b> supply of <b>natural</b> <b>gas</b> to <b>the</b> United States pipeline system. In this paper, it is shown that it is optimal for the Mexican government to use the netback rule based on the Texas price of gas to set <b>the</b> price of <b>natural</b> <b>gas</b> in Mexico even though the Texas market cannot be considered a competitive market, and the Texas price for <b>natural</b> <b>gas</b> reflects quasi-rents created by various bottlenecks...|$|R
30|$|It {{is worth}} {{mentioning}} that <b>the</b> steady-state <b>natural</b> <b>gas</b> flow model (21)–(22) would neglect built-in storage capabilities of pipelines (i.e., line pack) and slow travelling speeds of <b>natural</b> <b>gas</b> flows, {{as compared to}} the transient gas flow model [6].
