5|$|As Anderson {{remained}} {{throughout her}} life evasive about <b>the</b> <b>details</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> {{life as a}} commercial writer, {{it is not known}} when she began writing commercially under pseudonyms, what those pseudonyms were, or, indeed, how much she wrote. She revealed only that she began writing for magazines and newspapers out of commercial necessity, and rarely under her own name. Although she achieved success later in this field, she sometimes stated that, as her writing improved, her pieces were more frequently turned down for publication. In her thirties, she began to write for commercial radio. Beginning with half-hour slots, Anderson gradually became interested in the technique of crafting radio plays, and began submitting some of her better work to the ABC under her own name. She later ascribed her fondness for writing the expansive dialogue in her novels to her early experience writing radio plays.|$|E
5|$|Following her election, Collins {{donated the}} surplus $242,000 from her {{campaign}} coffers {{to the state}} Democratic Party. When Collins' husband was named state treasurer for the party– at an annual salary of $59,900– the state press charged that the move was a plot to funnel Collins' campaign funds into her personal account. (The previous Democratic state treasurer had received no salary during his tenure.) Following the media criticism, Dr. Collins resigned his post as treasurer. All of the involved individuals insisted that Governor Collins had not been briefed on <b>the</b> <b>details</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> husband's appointment. The media's criticism of Collins continued {{as many of the}} appointments to her executive cabinet went to what they characterized as inexperienced personnel who had held key positions in her past campaigns. When newly appointed Insurance Commissioner Gilbert McCarty approved a 17% rate increase requested by Blue Cross Blue Shield– a request that his predecessor had denied a few days earlier– Collins quickly countermanded the approval pending a public hearing on the matter.|$|E
5|$|From 1999 to 2001 a 40-year-old {{homemaker}} named Debbie Swenson perpetrated a ruse {{under the}} identity Kaycee Nicole, a 19-year-old woman in Kansas who shared <b>the</b> <b>details</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> battles with leukemia online. The Guardian newspaper reported {{that millions of}} Internet users read the fictional blog, as well as Swenson's own blog, in which she posed as Kaycee Nicole's mother, describing the trials of living with an intelligent and optimistic daughter who was dying. On May 16, 2001, Kaycee Nicole's death of an aneurysm was announced, shocking her readers and causing them intense grief. Soon however, Swenson caused skepticism in online communities. Although many cards and gifts had been previously sent, she refused to accept more. People began to learn that no one named Kaycee Nicole lived in Kansas, had been enrolled in schools, or admitted to local hospitals, and no obituary had been printed. The photo representing the girl {{was found to be}} that of a basketball player from Gracemont, Oklahoma, who was alive. After repeated questioning, Swenson posted that she had woven the stories of three cancer patients to create the character of Kaycee Nicole, who had never existed.|$|E

5|$|Jane's legal husband, who {{was still}} living in London, {{attempted}} to blackmail her in 1838 by publishing <b>the</b> <b>details</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> marital status in Barnard Gregory's The Satirist. Johnson published the notice after learning that she was living with a Mr. Hogg. He was mistaken as to the identity of her lover, however, and attempted to blackmail James Hogg, a Member of Parliament for Beverly. After James Hogg prepared to bring a libel suit, Johnson quickly disappeared. Although one journalist initially planned to publish the correct identities of the parties involved, at Mary Shelley's request Leigh Hunt convinced him not to publish the story. Johnson died in Hammersmith in 1840, ensuring {{an end to the}} matter. Though they were now free to marry, Jane and Thomas declined to marry in order not {{to draw attention to the}} fact that they had been unmarried for so long.|$|E
5|$|Loke had her keel {{laid down}} in March 1867 and was {{launched}} on 4 September 1869. She was commissioned on 22 October 1871 {{at the cost of}} 1,200,428 Swedish krona. The delay in construction may have been due to manufacturing difficulties by the British supplier of her armor plate. Generally the monitors were kept in reserve for most of the year; only being commissioned for two to four months during the summer and fall. Loke made only seven cruises, the last in late 1880, and was not commissioned afterwards. Funds were requested to rebuild her in 1903 and 1908, but they were refused. She was decommissioned on 21 August 1908 and advertised for sale. <b>The</b> <b>details</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> fate are unknown, but presumably she was sold and scrapped.|$|E
5|$|Research for {{the film}} was done through {{available}} sources, such as online information and newspaper archives. Kom's videos {{played a key role}} in the research. The writer also had several telephone and email conversations with her regarding her biography. In her interactions with Quadras and Kumar, Kom was forthcoming when it came to <b>the</b> <b>details</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> life, and had significant input in the screenplay. However, Quadras revealed that his biggest challenge was to make the film authentic and cinematic yet not documentary-like, so he wrote the film in a manner that showed the struggles Kom went through as a female sportsperson who had to confront opposition from her father, politics and making a comeback after a long career break. The film only shows the period from her early struggles and her comeback after motherhood. Her fifth World Boxing Championship win and the London Olympics were left out because of the contract that permitted a depiction of Kom's life up to 2008. The contract {{for the film}} was signed at that time when Kom had not even qualified for the London Olympics.|$|E

5|$|The poems {{were written}} during {{a short period}} while the poet lived in Germany. Although they {{individually}} deal {{with a variety of}} themes, as a series they focus on the poet's longing for the company of his friend Coleridge, who had stayed in England, and on his increasing impatience with his sister Dorothy, who had travelled with him abroad. Wordsworth examines the poet's unrequited love for the idealised character of Lucy, an English girl who has died young. The idea of her death weighs heavily on the poet throughout the series, imbuing it with a melancholic, elegiac tone. Whether Lucy was based on a real woman or was a figment of the poet's imagination has long been a matter of debate among scholars. Generally reticent about the poems, Wordsworth never revealed <b>the</b> <b>details</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> origin or identity. Some scholars speculate that Lucy is based on his sister Dorothy, while others see her as a fictitious or hybrid character. Most critics agree that she is essentially a literary device upon whom he could project, meditate and reflect.|$|E

25|$|Occasionally, {{commentators}} {{have questioned the}} overall authenticity of her biography, but documents relating to her career were deposited in the Musée de l'Armée in 1906, and the twentieth century saw a series of document-based historical studies which clarified <b>the</b> <b>details</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> biography.

25|$|In November 2016, Fox News anchor Megyn Kelly {{wrote in}} her book about <b>the</b> <b>details</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> sexual abuse {{allegations}} against Ailes. According to Kelly, when she first joined Fox News, Ailes would have meetings with her, during which he would make sexual remarks. He also tried to kiss her several times during a closed-door meeting, but {{she was able to}} get away and leave the office. After that incident in 2006, Kelly says that Ailes did not sexually harass her again. Then, in 2016, when Gretchen Carlson first made her sexual abuse allegations, Fox pressured Kelly to defend Ailes, which she refused to do.|$|E

Using the work of F. M. Alexander, meditation, and Yuasa's theory of cultivation as my main sources, I develop a detailed psychophysical model and a framework for conceptualising the inner training process. I also suggest some principles with which a trainee might guide and support a process of change...|$|R

25|$|Many of <b>the</b> <b>details</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> {{life are}} disputed, {{including}} her parentage. Although she is {{treated in the}} sagas as a historical person, even her historicity {{is a matter of}} some debate. What details of her life are known come largely from Icelandic sources, which generally asserted that the Icelandic settlers had fled from Harald's tyranny. While the historicity of sources as the Landnámabók is disputed, the perception that Harald had exiled or driven out many of their ancestors led to an attitude among Icelanders generally hostile to Erik and Gunnhild. Scholars such as Gwyn Jones therefore regard some of the episodes reported in them as suspect.|$|E
25|$|For years, Bond and Mellman {{maintained}} a meticulous backstory for their characters, one made official on the Kiki and Herb MySpace page and their official website. This involved the characters meeting as {{children in a}} mental institution before becoming a jazz act in the fifties, beginning a long and chequered career mixing periods of success and misfortune. The shows were supposedly part of their comeback trail, and they would perform songs supposedly from throughout their career (which were actually anachronistic covers). Between songs Kiki would tell anecdotes from her life, including her friendships with Billie Holiday and Grace Kelly, and <b>the</b> <b>details</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> various relationships, whilst drinking heavily and often having on-stage rages and breakdowns.|$|E
25|$|Although {{there are}} some biographical facts about Campbell that are solidly documented, most of <b>the</b> <b>details</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> life, {{including}} incidents about her capture and adoption by the Lenape tribe, have {{come down to the}} present day through oral family traditions and written records of those traditions. Although the following contain examples of conflicting information some of which must obviously be incorrect, we may safely assume that some true information is preserved in the individual family traditions. A stemmatic analysis of this, and other, traditional material, by cataloging different lines of familial descent and their accompanying traditions could possibly bring to light or clarify many incidents in Mary Campbell's life which are now unknown or not well understood by interested researchers.|$|E

In particular, he was taken by <b>the</b> <b>detail</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> wearing curlers in her hair under her wimple. Hammerstein asked if he could incorporate their dialogue into the song, and they allowed him to do so because [...] "if you tell a story in a song, it's so much better." [...] When writing the lyric, Hammerstein knew he needed adjectives for the nuns to describe Maria. He admitted that his vocabulary was never big, but the simple adjectives he used to describe Maria's character proved a success.|$|R
