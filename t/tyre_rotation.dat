40|$|AbstractAn {{electromagnetic}} (EM) {{power generator}} having 46 Hz resonance frequency {{is designed to}} scavenge mechanical vibrations occurring in tyres due to tyre-road contact. The major innovation {{is the use of}} FR 4 as a structural spring material as well as utilizing a spacer and stopper mechanism increasing the shock resistance by limiting the maximum deflection. The novel magnet assembly and spacer design provide high power density. The tangential acceleration waveforms of typical <b>tyre</b> <b>rotation</b> is used as an input in the experiments and 0. 4 mW power is obtained over a 100 Ω load resistance for 15 g peak-to-peak amplitude at 22, 83 Hz, corresponding to about 150 kph vehicle speed. Maximum acceleration is limited with the shaker, larger power values are expected in actual operation. The performance is obtained off-resonance and superior to resonant Silicon MEMS based scavengers...|$|E
40|$|Tyre/road {{interaction}} is recognised {{as the main}} source of interior and exterior noise for velocities over the 40 km/h. In this paper, a three-dimensional (3 D) elemental approach has been adopted to predict the stochastic tyre vibration and hence the interior and exterior noise due to this kind of excitation. The road excitation has been modelled from the spectral density of a common road profile, supposing the road to be an isotropic surface. A linear Winkler bedding connects the 3 D model of the tyre with the ground. The exterior noise has been evaluated by an elemental calculation of the radiation matrix of the tyre deformed by the static load on a concrete road. The noise inside the vehicle has also been calculated, using the transfer functions from the force transmitted to the hub and the noise inside the vehicle, which have been computed by a FEM model of a common car body. The simple formulation allows much quicker calculation than traditional nonlinear approaches, and appears to give results consistent with available measurements, although the effects of <b>tyre</b> <b>rotation</b> and of the nonlinearities in the contact model are yet to be quantified, and the method requires further experimental validation before practical application...|$|E

"Wrinklewall" [...] slicks are now {{specifically}} designed for the special requirements of drag racing, being constructed {{in such a way}} as to allow the sidewall to be twisted by the torque applied at launch, softening the initial start and thus reducing the chances of breaking traction. As speed builds, the centrifugal force generated by the <b>tyre's</b> <b>rotation</b> [...] "unwraps" [...] the sidewall, returning the energy to the car's acceleration. Additionally, it causes the tyres to expand radially, increasing their diameter and effectively creating a taller gear ratio, allowing a higher top speed with the same transmission gearing.|$|R
40|$|Road {{traffic noise}} is {{becoming}} an increasingly big problem in densely populated areas. One of the main contributions comes from the tyre/road interaction. For the interior noise, to which the occupants of the vehicle are exposed, tyre/road noise {{is also an important}} source, especially at lower frequencies. The vibrations of the tyre up to 500 Hz are transmitted via structural transmission paths to the interior effectively, thus causing acoustic noise. In this frequency range tyre/road noise is dominated by vibrational mechanisms. One of the aspects that has {{to be taken into account}} when modelling tyre vibrations is the effect of rotation. Recently a Finite Element (FE) based methodology has been presented for the modeling of rotating tyres at frequencies up to 500 Hz. A modal approach is used to determine the response of a rotating tyre. In order to solve the contact problem the unit impulse response functions (Green’s functions) of the <b>tyre</b> including <b>rotation</b> are needed. In the present paper an analytical expression of the Green’s functions including rotation based on this methodology is derived. It is shown that the frequency shift due to rotation is correctly predicted by the derived Green’s functions...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Longitudinal {{and lateral}} forces acting on tyres {{are known to}} be closely related to {{tractive}} ability, braking characteristics, handling stability and manoeuvrability of ground vehicles. However, it is not feasible in the operating vehicles to measure the tyre forces directly because of the high cost of sensors, the limitations in sensor technology, interference with <b>tyre</b> <b>rotation</b> and the harsh environ-ment. Another approach is the indirect monitoring technique that can estimate the tyre forces based on remote sensor outputs and vehicle dynamics models. In this paper, in order to develop tyre force-monitoring systems, a monitoring model is proposed utilizing not only the yawing motion but also the roll motion. Based on the monitoring model, a monitoring system is designed to estimate the lateral tyre force acting on each tyre. The monitoring system is constructed {{on the basis of a}} new scaled Kalman lter with model error compensator (SKFMEC) technique that is developed in this study to improve the robustness performance of Kalman lter methods. The SKFMEC technique adopts both the well-conditioned observer and the model error compensator concepts. Tyre force estimation performance of the monitoring system is evaluated in the MATLAB simulations where true tyre force data are generated from a 14 -degree-of-freedom vehicle model with the combined-slip ‘magic formula ’ tyre model...|$|E
40|$|In this thesis, the Finite Element (FE) Analysis of {{aircraft}} tyres is presented. The modelling and simulations of detailed construction of tyre enable tyre manufacturers to evaluate new designs and development before a prototype is fabricated, and aim {{to reduce the}} research costs and efforts to optimise the current tyre design of tyres. The material properties is key in the FE modelling and analysis, a number of sample from the rubber compounds and reinforcement were used to characterise the elastic, hyperelastic and viscoelastic behaviour of material. In this research, two aircraft tyres were employed for correlation study {{to a number of}} design checks and standard tests such as profile growth, sidewall deformation, footprint, contact pressure, and load-deformation data. The burst simulation was carried out to investigate when and where the failure in tyre occurs and compares it with what happens in real-world burst test as an important procedure in tyre safety certification by aviation authorities. As a result, the virtual testing would shorten the design procedure by checking the design parameters in advance of tyre prototyping. Moreover, the FE parameters such as mesh size and tyre geometry are investigated for optimisation of the runtime and accuracy and improvements in the FE results. A number of simulations were run to determine generated forces and moments across the contact patch using a steady-state approach in presence of air as the tyre inflator to obtain a higher accuracy in prediction of the vertical stiffness and footprint area. In addition, the tyre was freely rolled on the runway using an explicit approach to investigate the energy dissipation and heat build-up per <b>tyre</b> <b>rotation</b> due to the tyre viscoelasticity. Finally, TAIS (Tyre Analysis Interface System) development is explained in response to the design requirements from Dunlop Aircraft Tyres...|$|E
40|$|The mining {{industry}} commonly uses {{qualitative risk analysis}} methods to analyse hazards and business risks. These methods suffer {{from a number of}} limitations. The use of language required to describe risk events creates inherent subjectiveness. Assumptions, resultant model uncertainty and natural or statistical variability make scenario comparisons difficult. This thesis demonstrates how quantitative risk analysis, as an alternative can be successfully used to overcome these shortfalls. An industry survey confirmed the infrequent application of quantitative methods across the {{mining industry}}. Given the high risk/cost nature of the industry, adopting a more data focussed management approach would benefit many mine management functions. The value of quantitative risk analysis was successfully illustrated by an earthmover tyre management case study. A holistic summary of issues, considerations and variables around optimal tyre asset, technical and operational tyre management was developed. Tyre performance data was analysed using ‘grouped failure analysis’. Grouped failure analysis was found to provide more representative tyre data statistics as it does not assume that tyres enter service in ‘as good as new’ or equal condition when rotated across different vehicle positions throughout their lifecycle. This is a significant improvement as wear characteristics are now reflected more accurately for subsequent tyre life cycle modelling and decision making. Three decision making models simulating <b>tyre</b> <b>rotation</b> using Weibull analysis were developed. Rotation intervals optimising tyre operating cost, tyre demand and tyre wear were calculated. These are fundamental drivers of successful tyre management and the methods developed in this thesis have direct application to tyre management. There are no qualitative methods currently available capable of delivering such decision-making ability. Given the ongoing mining boom, quantitative risk analysis approaches to better manage the scarce and expensive earthmover tyre supply, or any other engineering asset will become increasingly important...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{shows that}} the {{eigenfrequencies}} of a deformed tyre exhibit a mutual repulsion behaviour if the rotation velocity is increased. This phenomenon is known as frequency loci veering and is induced by the a-periodicity resulting from the tyre deformation due to {{the weight of the}} car. The corresponding eigenmodes interact in the transition zones and finally interchange. This is not the case for the undeformed tyre, where {{it is well known that}} rotation splits the eigenfrequencies around the eigenfrequencies of the non-rotating tyre. The change in eigenfrequencies is linearly related to the rotation velocity and is determined by the circumferential wavenumber and tyre radius only. For the undeformed tyre no modal interaction occurs as a consequence of rotation. Furthermore, modal interaction increases as tyre load increases and decreases as material damping increases. In previous work a methodology to model tyre vibrations has been developed, exploiting a modal base determined in a standard FE package and including rotational effects by a coordinate transformation. Major advantages of this approach are that the complex build-up of a tyre is retained and that the large (nonlinear) deformations and small (linear) vibrations are treated separately. In the present paper, the effects of deformation on the eigenfrequencies of a <b>rotation</b> <b>tyre</b> are examined using this methodology. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R
