5|$|In February 2016, in {{response}} to the spread of the Zika virus, the Obama administration requested that Congress appropriate $1.9billion to fight the spread of the disease. Congress did not initially take action, leaving Burwell to direct the Department of Health and Human Services to reprogram $589million in funds previously designated as part of the response to Ebola, to fight the spread of the Zika virus. Of the initial Zika funding, the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) received $222million to lead the domestic fight against the virus with the National Institutes of Health and the Biomedical Advanced Research and Development Authority splitting $152million for the domestic effort. In response to Congressional complaints that the money was not being spent fast enough, Burwell informed Congress that without further funding the CDC's funding to fight Zika would be depleted by September30, 2016. After Burwell moved funding from other HHS programs, Congress finally appropriated $1.1billion to fight the spread of Zika in the United States. By the end of September 2016, the United States reported 23,000 cases in the territory of Puerto Rico, 3,000 cases in the states, and 21babies born in the United States with microcephaly <b>testing</b> <b>positive</b> for Zika.|$|E
5|$|On September 22, 2011, Dugard {{filed suit}} in US District Court for the Northern District of California accusing the United States of failing to monitor Phillip {{when he was a}} federal parolee. Dugard alleged in her lawsuit against the federal {{government}} that parole officials should have returned Garrido to prison for any number of parole violations that preceded her abduction, including <b>testing</b> <b>positive</b> for drugs and alcohol. Her lawsuit was rejected by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit on March 15, 2016. The court ruled in a 2–1 decision that Dugard had not been victimized by Garrido {{at the time he was}} placed under federal parole supervision, and there was no way to anticipate she would become his victim. As a result, federal authorities in California had no duty to protect her or other members of the general public from him. In a dissenting opinion, Chief District Court Judge William Smith said the majority had improperly analyzed Dugard's case, and said there was good reason to hold the government liable.|$|E

5|$|The initial squad was {{selected}} for the British team on 14 July; however, the final team was not confirmed until {{the outcome of a}} courtcase involving Dwain Chambers. Under the rules of the BOA, Chambers had been banned from future Games after <b>testing</b> <b>positive</b> for the steroid THG in 2003. His appeal to overturn that ban, {{on the grounds that it}} was an unfair restraint of trade, failed and he was omitted from the squad. The team included former Olympic medal winners Marlon Devonish and Kelly Sotherton, as well as former Olympic individual finalists Joanne Pavey, Paula Radcliffe, Helen Clitheroe and Tasha Danvers. Women's marathon world record holder Paula Radcliffe faced a battle to be fit for the Games due to a stress fracture in her left thigh.

5|$|In April 2009, the IOC {{announced}} that six athletes had tested positive during the 2008 Summer Olympics, without mentioning names or sports. Later, rumours emerged that the athletes included two cyclists, {{one of them}} a medal winner. The Italian National Olympic Committee (CONI) then confirmed that a male Italian cyclist had tested positive for Continuous erythropoietin receptor activator (CERA) during the men's road race, without identifying him. The next day, on 29 April 2009, the Committee confirmed that Davide Rebellin was an involved athlete. Rebellin's agent sent a request for the analysis of the B sample. On 8 July 2009, Rebellin, along with Stefan Schumacher, were confirmed as having tested positive. Schumacher was already serving a ban after <b>testing</b> <b>positive</b> in the 2008 Tour de France, but faces further punishment, and Rebellin subsequently had his medal removed by the UCI and the IOC. On 27 November, Rebellin returned his silver medal to CONI, per their and the UCI's request. Per UCI regulations, Cancellara and Kolobnev were moved up to second and third in the official results, but did not initially receive new medals. On December 18, 2010, Cancellara received the same physical medal initially given to Rebellin, in a ceremony held in his hometown of Ittigen, Switzerland. The medal originally given to Cancellara will in turn be given to Kolobnev.|$|E
5|$|Snowboarding is a {{sport that}} has been contested at the Winter Olympic Games since the 1998 Winter Olympics in Nagano, Japan. Snowboarding was one of five new sports or {{disciplines}} added to the Winter Olympic programme between 1992 and 2002, and {{was the only one}} not to have been a previous medal or demonstration event. In 1998, four events, two for men and two for women, were held in two specialities: the giant slalom, a downhill event similar to giant slalom skiing; and the half-pipe, in which competitors perform tricks while going from one side of a semi-circular ditch to the other. Canadian Ross Rebagliati won the men's giant slalom and became the first athlete to win a gold medal in snowboarding. Rebagliati was briefly stripped of his medal by the International Olympic Committee (IOC) after <b>testing</b> <b>positive</b> for marijuana. However, the IOC's decision was reverted following an appeal from the Canadian Olympic Association. For the 2002 Winter Olympics, the giant slalom was dropped in favour of the parallel giant slalom, an event that involves head-to-head racing. In 2006, a third event, the snowboard cross, was held for the first time. In this event, competitors race against each other down a course with jumps, beams and other obstacles.|$|E
