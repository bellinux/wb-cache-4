[...] When asked if the children suffered before dying, Carver replied by stating that [...] "If so, not for very long". Under Connecticut law at the time, the 20-year-old Lanza was old enough to carry a long gun, such as a rifle or shotgun, but too young to own or carry handguns.|$|E

5000|$|Samberg {{was born}} in Berkeley, California, as David A. J. Samberg, but changed his first name to Andy at age five. His mother, Marjorie [...] "Margi" [...] (née Marrow), is an {{elementary}} school teacher, and his father, Joe, is a photographer. He has two sisters, Johanna and Darrow. He is Jewish, and has described himself as [...] "not particularly religious." [...] His maternal grandfather, industrial psychologist and philanthropist Alfred J. Marrow, served as the executive chair of the American Jewish Congress. Samberg is a third cousin of U.S. Senator Tammy Baldwin, as their maternal grandfathers were first cousins. Samberg discovered Saturday Night Live as a child, while sneaking past his parents to watch professional wrestling on television. He was obsessed with the show and his devotion to comedy was frustrating to teachers who felt he was distracted from his schoolwork. Samberg graduated from Berkeley High School in 1996, where he became interested in creative writing and has stated that [...] "classes were <b>the</b> <b>ones</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> put all my effort into... that's what I cared about and that's what I ended up doing." [...] He attended college at University of California, Santa Cruz {{for two years before}} transferring to New York University's Tisch School of the Arts, where he graduated in 2000.|$|E

5000|$|According {{to several}} {{witnesses}} Schrepfer had a cheerful dinner with {{friends on the}} evening October 7, 1774 that lasted until 1:00 AM and involved lots of punch. Schrepfer and five of his associates - including lawyer Hoffmann and Karl von Sachsen's chamberlains Hans Rudolph von Bischoffswerder and Christian Friedrich von Hopfgarten - agreed to have a stroll to the Rosenthal forest {{on the edge of}} town at 5:00 in the morning, when it was still very dark. After he woke at 4:00 Schrepfer wrote several farewell letters of which a few transcripts are kept at the Leipzig city archives. The letter to DuBosc says (translated from German): [...] "My beloved friend.

5000|$|Roberts {{then gave}} an {{interview}} to Rolling Stone in which she discussed [...] "Sticks + Stones" [...] and her advocacy against bullying to that point where Roberts stated she was [...] "sick" [...] of an image driven society. In the past Roberts had pushed for a ban on under 18's using tanning beds which followed through after backing from the health secretary Andy Burnham and even saw her talk to British parliament. Then with bullying she took a similar stance saying bullying [...] "doesn't need to happen" [...] stating that the British laws are failing to combat the issue with Roberts noting [...] "People are still scared to go to school, kids are threatening to kill themselves; it's disgusting that it persists. So, again, I'm giving a voice to a cause, to hopefully affect change." [...] Roberts then started communications with the education secretary Michael Gove to help raise awareness of the issue. On her official website Roberts explained her progression to help eradicate bullying, she said:"The internet has really highlighted this issue. It shows us {{how easy it is}} for people to pass judgement on others and it also shows us that people now have a place for expression.

5000|$|Regarding the album's lyrical content, James Graham {{remarked that}} [...] "All {{the songs are}} just pretty much about what's {{happened}} to us, people that I know, and where we live. ... I never really tell anyone what the songs are about because my favorite songs are <b>the</b> <b>ones</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> don't really know the exact meanings to either; I have my own perceptions of those songs and can relate it back to myself. So, it's just something that I always said, that I would keep what the songs are all about to myself." [...] In a 2014 track-by-track interview about the album with Drowned in Sound, Graham remarked that opening track [...] "Cold Days from the Birdhouse" [...] {{was one of the}} last songs written for the album, but was originally set to be a B-side, which he claimed is [...] "a terrifying thought as 'Cold Days' is one of the most popular songs and has been the song that's introduced so many people to our music." [...] First single [...] "That Summer, at Home I Had Become the Invisible Boy", whose title is a reference to the film Stand by Me, was the first song the band had ever written, and was inspired by [...] "some pretty bad things" [...] that happened to the band members and people close to them. The song has also been one of the band's most enduring songs, having been played at every live performance since it was written. The accordion featured in many of the songs on the album, including [...] "Walking for Two Hours" [...] and [...] "I'm Taking the Train Home", was found by guitarist Andy MacFarlane in the attic of his house. Graham stated in 2014 that the accordion is [...] "unfortunately now broken." [...] "Last Year's Rain Didn't Fall Quite So Hard" [...] was inspired by Animal Collective's 2004 album Sung Tongs, with MacFarlane and Graham creating melodies and vocals to loop, a writing and recording method the band had never tried before. [...] "Talking with Fireworks / Here, It Never Snowed" [...] is referred to the band as [...] "Loud/Quiet" [...] on their setlists; and when performed live, Graham provides extra cymbal crashes, sometimes even playing the cymbal with his head.|$|E

40|$|Introduction I {{will talk}} here about three {{problems}} that have bothered me {{for a number of}} years, during which time I have experimented with a variety of solutions and encouraged others to work on them. I have raised each of them separately both in full and in passing in various contexts, but thought it would be worthwhile on this occasion to bring them to your attention side by side. In this talk I will explain the problems, together with some things that have been tried in the past and some new ideas for their solution. Types of conceptual problems. A conceptual problem is not one which is formulated in precise technical terms and which calls for a definite answer. For this reason, there are no clear-cut criteria for their solution, but one can bring some criteria to bear. These will vary from case to case. There are three general types of conceptual problems in mathematics of which <b>the</b> <b>ones</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> will discuss today are examples. These are: 1 ffi<...|$|E
40|$|Avala (a 21 va 21 la 21) is a {{previously}} undocumented Angkuic lect that I had recorded on April 30, 2014 in Bangliu 邦六, Manghuai Township 芒怀乡, Yun County 云县, Yunnan, China. Avala is practically extinct, {{and there is}} only one elderly man in the entire village cluster who remembers any words from the language – 83 -year-old Chen Zhifang 陈织芳. Chen is hard of hearing and has lost most of his teeth; hence elicitation was difficult, resulting in inconsistent speech as well. Fortunately, of the 30 or so words I managed to elicit from him, he also remembered the autonym. Chen claims he does not remember any more words in Avala other than <b>the</b> <b>ones</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> have elicited from him. Locals in Manghuai Township reported more ethnic Bulang residing in Niuquan 牛圈, Maolan Township 茂兰镇, Yun County, but it is unknown whether they speak Avala (Bulang) or not.
