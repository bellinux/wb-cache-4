5|$|On 29 May 2003, Qantas Flight 1737 from Melbourne to Launceston Airport was {{subjected}} to an attempted hijacking shortly after takeoff. The hijacker, a passenger named David Robinson, intended to fly the aircraft into the Walls of Jerusalem National Park, located in central Tasmania. <b>The</b> <b>flight</b> <b>attendants</b> and passengers successfully subdued and restrained the hijacker, and the aircraft returned to Melbourne.|$|E
5|$|Twenty dots {{arranged}} {{in the shape}} of an aircraft serves as the logo of the airline. The airline uses a two tone blue livery on a white background with the belly of the aircraft painted in Indigo with the logo in white. <b>The</b> <b>flight</b> <b>attendants</b> wear a single-piece navy-blue tunic with a cap and a thin indigo belt designed by fashion designer Rajesh Pratap Singh and make-up artist Ambika Pillai. The airline has the tagline on-time focusing on punctuality.|$|E
5|$|CeeCee Lyles {{was one of}} <b>the</b> <b>flight</b> <b>attendants</b> on board. In 2003, {{a statue}} of Lyles was {{unveiled}} {{in her hometown of}} Fort Pierce, Florida, which has since gained national recognition as one of the many monuments to the attacks. On August 9, 2007, a portion of U.S.219 in Somerset County, near the Flight 93 National Memorial, was co-signed as the Flight 93 Memorial Highway. At the National September 11 Memorial, the names of the 40 victims of Flight 93 are inscribed on Panels S-67 and S-68 at the South Pool.|$|E

5|$|When an Indian American {{passenger}} reveals {{himself as}} an American, one of the terrorists murders him and throws his body off the aircraft {{in front of the}} Pakistani negotiators. The terrorists try to locate a radio engineer among the passengers by ordering Neerja to make an announcement over the intercom. When Emran Ali (Shashi Bhushan), a Pakistani radio engineer, begins to stand up, Neerja signals for him to sit down. The terrorists have <b>the</b> <b>flight</b> <b>attendants</b> collect all passports to identify the American passengers and hold them hostage; Neerja and her colleagues collect the passports, disposing of any American passports by throwing them down trash chutes or hiding them under seats. Dejected over not finding any American passports, the hijackers locate a British passenger and hold him hostage.|$|E
25|$|Air France uniforms {{denote the}} ranks for <b>the</b> <b>flight</b> <b>attendants.</b> Two silver sleeve stripes denote a Chief Purser. One silver sleeve stripe denote a Purser.

25|$|On May 30, 2007, it was {{announced}} that <b>the</b> <b>flight</b> <b>attendants</b> narrowly agreed to concessions and became the last major work group at Northwest to agree to new contract terms. The deal was approved by a vote of 2,966 to 2,862. Union leaders said that 90.5 percent of eligible voters cast ballots. The new contract would provide Northwest with $1957million in annual cuts through 2011.|$|E

50|$|<b>The</b> <b>flight</b> <b>attendant’s</b> {{behavior}} exemplifies spontaneously emergent work feelings, {{which is}} the second defining characteristic of bounded emotionality Seven Defining Characteristics. This characteristic holds that an employee’s emotions should not be dictated by the administration of an organization nor should it be “appointed for the organization’s benefit;” nevertheless, in this example organizational rules mandate that <b>the</b> <b>flight</b> <b>attendant</b> adheres to this standardized set of emotions.|$|R
50|$|In November 2005 the PFAA {{agreed to}} {{temporary}} concessions which reduced <b>the</b> average <b>flight</b> <b>attendant's</b> hourly pay by approximately 21% and total compensation by approximately 30%. The company proposed additional cost-cutting measures which would outsource to foreign nationals up {{a third of}} <b>the</b> <b>flight</b> <b>attendant</b> positions and dramatically reduce the compensation and benefits of those who remain.|$|R
25|$|In November 2014 Air Canada pilots voted by a {{majority}} of 84% in favour of a 10-year contract that allows the country’s biggest passenger carrier to use arbitration or mediation to resolve disputes. A year later, <b>the</b> <b>flight</b> <b>attendants</b> also approved a 10-year agreement, apparently by a narrow (unstated) margin, with wage increases, increased job security and improvements to working conditions, according to Michel Cournoyer, the head of CUPE's Air Canada unit.|$|E
25|$|Negotiations with attendants {{had been}} ongoing and {{contentious}} for several years. <b>The</b> <b>flight</b> <b>attendants</b> {{were unable to}} strike during negotiations because of a court injunction and the refusal of the mediation board to release them from bargaining which would have allowed the setting of a strike deadline. The attendants had been working under imposed pay cuts and work rules since July 2006 when a previous tentative agreement was rejected by 55 percent of the voting members.|$|E
25|$|On July 7, 1983, Air Florida Flight 8 with 47 {{people on}} board was flying from Fort Lauderdale International Airport to Tampa International Airport. One of the {{passengers}} handed a note to one of <b>the</b> <b>flight</b> <b>attendants,</b> {{saying that he had}} a bomb and telling them to fly the plane to Havana, Cuba. He revealed a small athletic bag, which he opened and inside was an apparent explosive device. The airplane was diverted to Havana-José Martí International Airport and the hijacker was taken into custody by Cuban authorities.|$|E
50|$|Geoffrey and <b>the</b> <b>flight</b> <b>attendant</b> go on {{a search}} for the {{supposed}} seaplane that could have been used to pick up the jewels from the surface. They find that a pilot named Joe King has flown a plane with Rodine out to sea to retrieve the jewels. When they later meet the strange woman from <b>the</b> beach, <b>the</b> <b>flight</b> <b>attendant</b> identifies her as one Irene Trilling, who was also a passenger on <b>the</b> same <b>flight</b> as <b>the</b> man pretending to be Mr. Rodine.|$|R
50|$|Following <b>the</b> <b>flight</b> <b>attendant's</b> dismissal, <b>the</b> airline {{contacted}} {{him over}} a dozen times, pressuring him to tell the South Korean transport authorities that he had voluntarily resigned. Two members of the supposedly independent investigative team assigned to the incident were former Korean Air employees. According to <b>the</b> <b>flight</b> <b>attendant,</b> Korean Air officials were present at the investigation and were allowed to ask him questions. He believed that the government investigation would be unjust, and instead reported the incident directly to the media, initiating a public furor.|$|R
50|$|FAMRI, or <b>the</b> <b>Flight</b> <b>Attendant</b> Medical Research Institute is a {{non-profit}} research funding body. It was created {{as part of}} the settlement of a class action lawsuit brought against the tobacco industry on behalf of non-smoking <b>flight</b> <b>attendants.</b>|$|R
25|$|The {{incident}} was largely met with disbelief and {{laughter from the}} passengers and some of <b>the</b> <b>flight</b> <b>attendants,</b> as {{they thought it was}} an exercise. Passengers described two of the hijackers as calm and with a good comprehension of Swedish, while one was clearly nervous and did not understand Swedish. The hijackers calmly answered questions regarding the action and stated that they intended to have the ambassador's murderer released. They then started making references to the Munich massacre ten days earlier and hinted that a similar situation could arise in the aircraft. Passengers described the hijackers as generally friendly.|$|E
25|$|After the {{aircraft}} stopped, the crew saw fire outside and began evacuation. When the emergency exits were opened, {{one of the}} right middle exit slides (R3) deflated after being punctured by debris from {{the aircraft}}, while one of the left slides (L2) failed to deploy at all for unknown reasons. The two rear left exits remained closed due to the fire. A number of passengers were forced to jump from the aircraft to exit. The actions of <b>the</b> <b>flight</b> <b>attendants,</b> who ensured {{that all of the}} passengers quickly evacuated, contributed to the safe escape of all passengers. The first officer was the last to leave the plane, which was evacuated within the required 90second time frame.|$|E
25|$|Thirty-one {{people on}} board were killed, {{including}} both the pilots. Three of the survivors were not injured, including <b>the</b> <b>flight</b> <b>attendants.</b> Some of the survivors were able to free themselves and each other and {{walk out of the}} fuselage. Most were hanging in their seat belts, wedged in by the wreckage. The fire departments in Ängelholm and Vejbystrand arrived at the scene eleven minutes after the crash and started freeing the survivors. The airport's rescue service was on the scene seventeen minutes after the accident. Nine people were seriously injured and were brought to the field hospital at the air base. The survivors were generally seated in the aft of the cabin. One of the passengers had brought their cat along in a cage on the flight, and it survived the accident.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>flight</b> <b>attendant,</b> during <b>the</b> crash sequence, shouted brace {{position}} commands {{and once}} the aircraft stopped, immediately evacuated the aircraft {{with the assistance of}} an off-duty <b>flight</b> <b>attendant.</b> Some passengers could not be extricated and required rescue from the Fire Services.|$|R
50|$|In {{the second}} story, the unnamed Cop 663 is {{similarly}} {{dealing with a}} breakup, {{this time with a}} <b>flight</b> <b>attendant.</b> He meets Faye, the new girl at the snack bar. She secretly falls for him. <b>The</b> <b>flight</b> <b>attendant</b> waits for <b>the</b> cop around the snack bar, and finds out he is on his day off. She leaves a letter for the snack bar owner to give to the cop. Everyone in the snack bar reads the letter, which is assumed to be <b>the</b> <b>flight</b> <b>attendant's</b> way of telling the cop that their relationship is over. The envelope also has a spare set of keys to the cop's apartment.|$|R
5000|$|Above the {{passenger}} seats are Passenger Service Units (PSU). These typically contain reading lights, air vents, and a <b>flight</b> <b>attendant</b> call light. On most narrowbody aircraft (and some Airbus A300s and A310s), <b>the</b> <b>flight</b> <b>attendant</b> call button and the buttons {{to control the}} reading lights are located directly on the PSU, while on most widebody aircraft, <b>the</b> <b>flight</b> <b>attendant</b> call button and the reading light control buttons are usually part of the in-flight entertainment system. The units frequently have small [...] "Fasten Seat Belt" [...] and [...] "No Smoking" [...] illuminated signage and may also contain a speaker for the cabin public address system.|$|R
25|$|Passenger {{accounts}} the {{day after}} the crash detailed how the approach appeared to have been going normally, with <b>the</b> <b>flight</b> <b>attendants</b> having made the passengers ready for landing, when the crash occurred suddenly and without warning. The pilot did not report an emergency to the tower. There were conflicting reports over what caused the crash, suggesting that the landing was disrupted after the aircraft was hit by a downdraft, or struck by lightning. The pilot said that the aircraft was struck by lightning. Officials refused to comment on the reports of a lightning strike, although subsequent research proved that was not true. No aircraft has had an accident caused by lighting since 1971. The airport was not fitted with equipment such as a Doppler radar, used to detect wind shear.|$|E
25|$|The fate {{of most of}} the unreturned {{passengers}} has {{not been}} confirmed. They were educated, upper-class people; Song Yeong-in of the National Intelligence Service once commented that they were probably retained by North Korea specifically for their propaganda value. In 1992, Oh Kil-nam claimed that the two flight attendants as well as Hwang and Gim were employed making propaganda broadcasts to the South; he also said he heard from his daughter that the captain and first officer were working for the Korean People's Air Force. The mother of one of <b>the</b> <b>flight</b> <b>attendants,</b> Seong Gyeong-hui, was allowed to visit the North to see her daughter as part of the family reunions agreed to in the June 15th North–South Joint Declaration; during their meeting, she claimed that she and the other flight attendant Jeong Gyeong-suk remained friends and were living in the same town.|$|E
25|$|During the descent, Captain Cronin ordered Flight Engineer Thomas to tell <b>the</b> <b>flight</b> <b>attendants</b> {{to prepare}} for an {{emergency}} landing, but Thomas was unable to contact them through the intercom. He asked the captain for permission {{to go down to}} find out what was happening, and Cronin agreed. Thomas saw severe damage immediately upon leaving the cockpit; the aircraft's skin was peeled off in some areas on the upper deck, revealing the frames and stringers. As he went down to the lower deck, the magnitude of the damage became apparent as he saw the large hole in the side of the cabin. Thomas returned to the cockpit and reported that a large section of fuselage was open aft of the Number 1 exit door. He concluded that it was probably a bomb and that, considering the damage, it would be unwise to exceed the airplane's stall speed by more than a small margin.|$|E

40|$|The public's {{perceptions}} {{and expectations of}} <b>flight</b> <b>attendants</b> and <b>the</b> airline industry are highly skewed and far from reality. As {{a microcosm of the}} real world it mirrors society. Racism exists, terrorism is a constant concern, and <b>the</b> female <b>flight</b> <b>attendant</b> is still a victim of sexist attitudes and practices. Through the use of installation, photography, audio, and video I will explore these issues in depth offering a rare view into the behind the scenes world of <b>the</b> <b>flight</b> <b>attendant...</b>|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> first <b>flight</b> <b>attendant</b> uniforms were {{designed}} to be durable, practical, and inspire confidence in passengers. In the 1930s, <b>the</b> first female <b>flight</b> <b>attendants</b> dressed in uniforms resembling nurses'outfits. <b>The</b> first female <b>flight</b> <b>attendants</b> for United Airlines wore green berets, green capes and nurse's shoes. Other airlines, such as Eastern Air Lines, actually dressed female <b>flight</b> <b>attendants</b> in nurses' uniforms. Both male and female <b>flight</b> <b>attendants</b> for Hawaiian Airlines wear aloha shirts as their uniform.|$|R
25|$|By 1983 {{the fleet}} {{included}} seven aircraft, two Boeing 727-100s (the second was registered C2-RN7) and five Boeing 737-200s (C2-RN5, 'RN6, 'RN8 and 'RN9 having {{been added to}} the fleet); since the entire population of Nauru at this time was about 8,000, the airline was in the extraordinary position of having seating capacity equal to 10% of the Nauruan population. The airline also had a bad reputation for cancelling flights at the whim of its government owners, including using the Boeing 727s for low-level searches for Nauruan fisherman lost at sea while relatives on board were served alcohol by <b>the</b> <b>flight</b> <b>attendants.</b> From this high point (at least in terms of fleet numbers) the airline gradually contracted in size, leasing some aircraft and selling others. Five years later in 1988 the fleet consisted of three Boeing 737-200s with the one remaining 727-100 leased out to Trans Australia Airlines. At this time the airline was badly affected by an industrial dispute with its pilots and was operating without a set timetable, a situation that lasted for several months.|$|E
500|$|Roswell met fellow voice actor Hal Rayle in 1986, {{and they}} married in 1987.

They moved from Los Angeles to Denver, Colorado, in June 1994 to raise their adopted {{daughter}} Spenser, {{who was born in}} 1993. Between March and November every year, when episodes of The Simpsons were being recorded, Roswell had to fly back to Los Angeles twice a week to attend the table reads and the recording sessions. In an article about her and her husband's move, Ricky Lopes of Rocky Mountain News wrote: [...] "When The Simpsons is taping, she goes to Los Angeles every Friday morning for the first reading, flies back that afternoon, flies back Sunday to tape the show Monday and flies back home that night." [...] Maggie Roswell said she [...] "got the idea for the way Helen Lovejoy says 'B-bye, b-bye, b-bye,' to everyone when they leave the church from the way <b>the</b> <b>flight</b> <b>attendants</b> say it when you get off the plane." ...|$|E
