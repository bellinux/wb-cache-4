It was well received by fans and music critics, who viewed it as a comeback for Scott-Heron.|$|E

5|$|Suicide is {{the act of}} {{intentionally}} causing one's own death. Risk {{factors include}} mental disorders such as depression, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia, personality disorders, and substance abuse, including alcoholism and use of benzodiazepines. Other suicides are impulsive acts due to stress such as from financial difficulties, <b>troubles</b> <b>with</b> relationships, or from bullying. Those who have previously attempted suicide are at higher risk for future attempts. Suicide prevention efforts include limiting access to methods of suicide, such as firearms, drugs, and poisons, treating mental disorders and substance misuse, proper media reporting of suicide, and improving economic conditions. Although crisis hotlines are common, {{there is little evidence}} for their effectiveness.|$|E

5|$|After the merger, {{the company}} began working on Enclave, a medieval fantasy, multiplayer-only video game {{inspired}} by Team Fortress. The game also became the company's first project with international appeal, enabling Starbreeze to partner with various publishers including Swing Entertainment, Conspiracy Entertainment, and Vivendi. However, Swing Entertainment faced bankruptcy at that time, and decided to turn the game into a single-player action-adventure video game {{with the goal of}} sending it to market as soon as possible. The game was released in 2002, and Starbreeze had to lay off staff after its release. Enclave II was also in development. The sequel was said to feature a more elaborate story, 28 different maps, 10 playable characters, and an improved fighting system. However, these features were axed when Starbreeze got into legal <b>troubles</b> <b>with</b> the publisher, resulting in the game's cancellation. Another game, , was successfully released with help from publisher TDK Mediactive. However its sequel was shifted to another developer. Starbreeze attempted to acquire another studio, Rock Solid Games, but the agreement between the two fell apart and brought both companies financial problems.|$|E

5|$|In 677 or 678, Wilfrid and Ecgfrith quarrelled, and Wilfrid was {{expelled}} from his see. Abbess Hilda of Whitby was a leader in a faction of the Northumbrian church that disliked Wilfrid, and her close ties with Theodore helped to undermine Wilfrid's position in Northumbria. Another contributory factor in Wilfrid's expulsion was his encouragement of Æthelthryth's entry into a nunnery; he had personally given her the veil, the ceremony of entering a nunnery, on her retirement to Ely Abbey. Æthelthryth had donated the lands Wilfrid used to found Hexham Abbey, and the historian N. J. Higham argues {{that they had been}} part of the queen's dower lands, which, when Ecgfrith remarried, his new queen wanted to recover. The historian Eric John feels that Wilfrid's close ties with the Mercian kingdom also contributed to his <b>troubles</b> <b>with</b> Egfrith, although John points out that these ties were necessary for Wilfrid's monastic foundations, some of which were in Mercia. Wilfrid not only lost his diocese, he lost control of his monasteries as well.|$|E
5|$|The King of Fighters series {{director}} Toyohisa Tanabe {{asserted that}} the Art of Fighting and Fatal Fury fighters were added specifically for adults, and the newer KOF characters were aimed to appeal to younger and newer audiences.

SNK artist C.A.C Yamasaki commented that although the lead programmer thought the game would not sell well, he believed it would eventually become popular. Ten people arrived at the first location test, but larger numbers came to subsequent tests. The SNK staff also had <b>troubles</b> <b>with</b> advertising the game {{due to a lack}} of money and some of their ads were noted to be of a poor quality.|$|E
