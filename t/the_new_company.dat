5|$|<b>The</b> <b>new</b> <b>company</b> {{made its}} debut at the Prince of Wales Theatre, Cardiff on 15 April 1946 with a double bill of Cavalleria Rusticana and Pagliacci. The {{orchestra}} was professional, mostly drawn {{from members of the}} BBC Welsh Orchestra; all the singers were amateurs, except for Tudor Davies, a tenor well known at Covent Garden and Sadler's Wells, who sang Canio in Pagliacci. During the week-long season <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>company</b> also staged Faust, with Davies in the title role. Although nearing {{the end of his career}} he was a considerable box-office draw, and the company played to full houses. Nevertheless, the expense of a professional orchestra and the hire of costumes and scenery outweighed the box-office receipts, and the season made a small loss. Finance remained a recurring problem over the succeeding decades.|$|E

40|$|In {{conducting}} {{this study}} I {{want to give}} more clarity about <b>the</b> <b>New</b> <b>Companies</b> Act and how it compares to the Current Companies Act. According to the study and <b>the</b> results, <b>the</b> <b>New</b> <b>Companies</b> Act gives more protection to, specifically the shareholders and <b>the</b> creditors. <b>The</b> <b>New</b> <b>Companies</b> Act is much wider in some instances and gives more clarity. On the other hand the {{are still a lot}} of aspects that needs to be addressed. In this study I took a look at Sections 38, 226 and 85 of the Current Companies Act and then I compared it to Sections 44, 45, and 48 of <b>the</b> <b>New</b> <b>Companies</b> Act. With all the changes that have been brought to <b>the</b> <b>New</b> <b>Companies</b> Act it now, puts South African Law in line with the International standards of Company Law.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to do critical analysis if <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>Companies</b> Act, with specific reference capital maintenance rules. Furthermore, this study will compare the current <b>Companies</b> Act with <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>Companies</b> Act, with a specific focus on sections 44, 45 and 48 of <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>Companies</b> Act and their comparison to sections 38, 85 and 226 of the current Companies Act. The next objective is to establish what impact <b>the</b> <b>new</b> piece of legislation will have on South African companies and whether the deficiencies in the current Companies Act have been addressed by <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>Companies</b> Act. <b>The</b> final objective is to establish whether this new piece of legislation gives adequate protection for the shareholders of a company. This study will focus on certain aspects of capital maintenance and excludes a comprehensive study of the capital maintenance rules, as the focus will be on certain sections in the current Companies Act and also <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>Companies</b> Act. This study will focus on the comparison between <b>the</b> <b>new</b> and current <b>Companies</b> Act. Furthermore, the focus will also be on the protection of the creditors of a company when analysing the different sections of the current <b>companies</b> act and <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>companies</b> act.

5|$|After {{the release}} of Shoulder Arms, Chaplin {{requested}} more money from First National, which was refused. Frustrated with their lack of concern for quality, and worried about rumours of a possible merger between the company and Famous Players-Lasky, Chaplin joined forces with Douglas Fairbanks, Mary Pickford, and D. W. Griffith {{to form a new}} distribution company – United Artists, established in January 1919. The arrangement was revolutionary in the film industry, as it enabled the four partners – all creative artists – to personally fund their pictures and have complete control. Chaplin was eager to start with <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>company</b> and offered to buy out his contract with First National. They declined this and insisted that he complete the final six films he owed them.|$|E
5|$|Although not a {{director}} or significant shareholder of <b>the</b> <b>new</b> <b>company,</b> Pearson continued {{to promote the}} project {{over the next few}} years and use his influence to help the company raise the £1 million of capital needed for the construction of the line. He issued a pamphlet, A twenty minutes letter to the citizens of London, in favour of the Metropolitan Railway and City Station, encouraging investment and he even persuaded the City of London to invest on the basis that the railway would alleviate the City's congestion problems. Once the railway was in operation, the City sold its shares at a profit. By 1860, the funds had been collected and the final route decided. Work on the railway started; taking less than three years to excavate through some of the worst slums of Victorian London and under some of the busiest streets.|$|E
5|$|Amtrak's {{decision}} to discontinue the NP trains caused consternation in Montana. Mike Mansfield (D-Montana), then Senate Majority Leader, {{pointed out that}} the Empire Builder bypassed Montana's major population centers, and had no difficulty in making his displeasure felt. <b>The</b> <b>new</b> <b>company</b> reacted to the pressure and announced a resumption of service over the ex-Northern Pacific, to begin on June 14. This service took the form of an unnamed section of the Empire Builder running separately between Minneapolis and Spokane, Washington. Mansfield's intervention earned the train the nickname “Mike Mansfield Limited”. The Northern Pacific route, which included the Yellowstone River, Homestake Pass and Bitterroot Mountains, was praised for its scenery. Amtrak considered the route one of the company's six most beautiful. The train also provided a convenient connection to Yellowstone National Park at Livingston, Montana.|$|E

However, the ministry stated that the authority could not hinder the merger, because by the time new contracts were awarded in 1995, helicopter operators from foreign countries would also be allowed to bid.

Bruce had now fixed his main hopes on the discovery of oil, but scientific expeditions in 1919 and 1920 failed to provide evidence of its presence, although substantial new deposits of coal and iron ore were discovered. Thereafter Bruce was too ill to continue with his involvement. <b>The</b> <b>new</b> <b>company</b> had expended most of its capital on these prospecting ventures, and although it continued to exist, under various ownerships, until 1952, there is no record of profitable extraction.
