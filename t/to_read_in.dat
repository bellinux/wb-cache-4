40|$|Abstract The aim of {{this study}} is to {{investigate}} attitudes <b>to</b> leisure-time <b>reading</b> among pupils <b>in</b> grade 5. A subsidiary aim is to examine whether there is a difference between how boys and girls relate <b>to</b> <b>reading</b> books. The method used in the study is questionnaires and a focus group interview. The result shows a clear difference between boys’ and girls’ <b>reading</b> habits <b>in</b> leisure time. The girls devote more time in general than the boys <b>to</b> leisure-time <b>reading,</b> but sports activities and the computer are two phenomena that the pupils choose <b>in</b> preference <b>to</b> <b>reading.</b> <b>In</b> the study one can see a link between reading literature relatively frequently in leisure time and having a positive attitude <b>to</b> <b>reading</b> <b>in</b> school, which applies to both sexes. The pupils who seldom or never <b>read</b> <b>in</b> their leisure time are also more negatively disposed <b>to</b> <b>reading</b> <b>in</b> school, which applies chiefly to the boys...|$|R

5000|$|Historically, patronymics were {{composed}} in Swedish fashion: the father's {{name and the}} suffix -n for genitive plus the word poika for sons, tytär for daughters. For example, Tuomas Abrahaminpoika (<b>to</b> be <b>read</b> <b>in</b> English as [...] "Tuomas, Abraham's son") and Martta Heikintytär (<b>to</b> be <b>read</b> <b>in</b> English as [...] "Martta, Heikki's daughter").|$|R
5|$|Norio Tsukudani based Himegoto on {{an earlier}} four-panel manga she drew for fun during her time as a student. At that time, the main {{characters}} {{that make up the}} student council were instead members of the drama club. However, Tsukudani decided to change this when developing Himegoto to be serialized in Ichijinsha's Waai! magazine, and she decided {{it would be easier to}} manage a cross-dressing character if he was in the student council. Before creating Himegoto, Tsukudani read various works of fiction that featured cross-dressing boys, but many of them featured the boys being paired with other boys. When she proposed the idea of Himegoto, she wanted to pair a cross-dressing boy with girls, which Tsukudani herself wanted <b>to</b> <b>read.</b> <b>In</b> this way, she thought that a variety of different people would enjoy it.|$|E
5|$|The whole {{dramatic}} {{moral of}} Coriolanus {{is that those}} who have little shall have less, and {{that those who have}} much shall take all that others have left. The people are poor; therefore they ought to be starved. They are slaves; therefore they ought to be beaten. They work hard; therefore they ought to be treated like beasts of burden. They are ignorant; therefore they ought not to be allowed to feel that they want food, or clothing, or rest, that they are enslaved, oppressed, and miserable. This is the logic of the imagination and the passions; which seek to aggrandise what excites admiration and to heap contempt on misery, to raise power into tyranny, and to make tyranny absolute; to thrust down that which is low still lower, and to make wretches desperate: to exalt magistrates into kings, kings into gods; to degrade subjects to the rank of slaves, and slaves to the condition of brutes. The history of mankind is a romance, a mask, a tragedy, constructed upon the principles of poetical justice; it is a noble or royal hunt, in which what is sport to the few is death to the many, and in which the spectators halloo and encourage the strong to set upon the weak, and cry havoc in the chase though they do not share in the spoil. We may depend upon it that what men delight <b>to</b> <b>read</b> <b>in</b> books, they will put in practice in reality.|$|E

25|$|In school, {{students}} are asked to complete many tasks and activities, many of which involve handwriting. Many children with CP have the capacity to learn and write in the school environment.

25|$|Typefaces with serifs {{are often}} {{considered}} easier <b>to</b> <b>read</b> <b>in</b> long passages than those without. Studies {{on the matter}} are ambiguous, suggesting that most of this effect {{is due to the}} greater familiarity of serif typefaces. As a general rule, printed works such as newspapers and books almost always use serif typefaces, at least for the text body. Web sites do not have to specify a font and can simply respect the browser settings of the user. But of those web sites that do specify a font, most use modern sans serif fonts, because it is commonly believed that, in contrast to the case for printed material, sans serif fonts are easier than serif fonts to read on the low-resolution computer screen.|$|E
25|$|When Vinea {{was still}} an infant, the Iovanakis moved from Giurgiu to Bucharest, capital of the Romanian Kingdom, where, in 1905, they had another son, Nicolae. In his childhood, Ioan trained himself <b>to</b> <b>read</b> <b>in</b> both Romanian and French, also {{speaking}} good Latin and German; he much later taught himself English. While attending primary school at Sfânta Vineri Institute from 1902, he also discovered his talent for the piano, and later took private lessons alongside Clara Haskil and Jacques G. Costin, who remained his friends for life. From 1910, when he enlisted at Saint Sava National College, Vinea applied himself to philology, covering modern French literature—then Symbolism, which became his main focus. He had the older Symbolist Adrian Maniu for a school tutor.|$|E

25|$|Chad's eschatological {{consciousness}} {{and its effect}} on others is brought to life in a reminiscence attributed to Trumbert, who was one of his students at Lastingham. Chad used to break off reading whenever a gale sprang up and call on God to have pity on humanity. If the storm intensified, he would shut his book altogether and prostrate himself in prayer. During prolonged storms or thunderstorms he would go into the church itself to pray and sing psalms until calm returned. His monks obviously regarded this as an extreme reaction even to English weather and asked him to explain. Chad explained that storms are sent by God to remind humans of the day of judgement and to humble their pride. The typically Celtic Christian involvement with nature was not like the modern romantic preoccupation but a determination <b>to</b> <b>read</b> <b>in</b> it the mind of God, particularly in relation to the last things.|$|E
25|$|Early Braille {{education}} {{is crucial to}} literacy for a blind or low-vision child. A study conducted {{in the state of}} Washington found that people who learned braille at an early age did just as well, if not better than their sighted peers in several areas, including vocabulary and comprehension. In the preliminary adult study, while evaluating the correlation between adult literacy skills and employment, it was found that 44% of the participants who had learned <b>to</b> <b>read</b> <b>in</b> Braille were unemployed, compared to the 77% unemployment rate of those who had learned to read using print. Currently, among the estimated 85,000 blind adults in the United States, 90% of those who are braille-literate are employed. Among adults who do not know braille, only 33% are employed. Statistically, history has proven that braille reading proficiency provides an essential skill set that allows blind or low-vision children to compete with their sighted peers in a school environment and later in life as they enter the workforce.|$|E
25|$|In 2005, Pi Beta Phi began a {{partnership}} with a reading awareness program called Read Across America. Commenced by the National Education Association in early March 1998, Read Across America was created to stimulate reading motivation and awareness.

A celebration of reading is head annually on March 2 in honor of the birthday of well-known and beloved children's book author, Dr. Seuss. Pi Beta Phi chapters across the country hold special literacy events and gatherings at their respective campuses that support and celebrate their partnership with Read Across America. Pi Beta Phi is also actively involved in and supports many other literacy programs such as First Book, Speed Read, Champions Are Readers, and Arrow In The Arctic, to name a few. Several philanthropic events and book drives are held at Pi Beta Phi chapters at colleges across the country to help promote literacy and get kids excited about reading.|$|E
