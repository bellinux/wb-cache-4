5|$|Andjar's toneels were {{generally}} based on day-to-day experiences, {{rather than the}} tales of princes and ancient wars which were standard at the time.

However, he considered the conflict in these works to have been poorly developed. Andjar believed that the Padangsche Opera's performances influenced other troupes in West Sumatra <b>to</b> <b>adapt</b> <b>the</b> toneel format, which later spread throughout the Indies.|$|E
