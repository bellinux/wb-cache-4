Drawing from an analysis of over 300 newspaper and magazine articles, this article argues that while this media coverage varies in its diagnosis of <b>the</b> <b>scandals,</b> it is rooted in a common set of taken-for-granted assumptions as to the nature, form, and operation of financial markets. These various points of complementarity suggest that the coverage of <b>the</b> <b>scandals</b> is less significant as an exercise in collective sense-making than as a re-investment in a particular market discourse, a form of financial intelligibility germane to <b>the</b> <b>scandals</b> themselves and instructive vis-à-vis the future study of corporate and white-collar crime.
