5|$|In {{the wake}} of remarks against India in Western media, Jessica Valenti, writing in The Nation, argued that such rapes are also common in the United States, but US {{commentators}} exhibit a double standard in denying or minimising their systemic nature while simultaneously attacking India for an alleged rape culture. Author and activist Eve Ensler, who organised One Billion Rising, a global campaign to end violence against women and girls, said that the gang rape and murder {{was a turning point}} in India and around the world. Ensler said that she had travelled to India {{at the time of the}} rape and murder and that after having worked every day of my life for the last 15 years on sexual violence, I have never seen anything like that, where sexual violence broke through the consciousness and was on the front page, nine articles in every paper every day, in the centre of every discourse, in the centre of the college students' discussions, in the centre of any restaurant you went in. And I think what's happened in India, India is really leading the way for the world. It's really broken through. They are actually fast-tracking laws. <b>They</b> <b>are</b> <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> sexual education. <b>They</b> <b>are</b> <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> the bases of patriarchy and masculinity and how all that leads to sexual violence.|$|E

Movement of this reflected normal limb is then performed so that it looks to the patient as though they are performing movement with the affected limb (although it will be pain free due to the fact it is a normal limb being reflected).|$|E

25|$|In 2011, the Institute for Public Policy Research, a UK {{think tank}} {{associated}} with the Labour Party, advocated a job creation program - with compulsory takeup, on pain of loss of benefits - for the long-term unemployed only. The Labour Party under Ed Miliband subsequently went into the 2015 general election with a promise to implement an even more limited Job Guarantee (specifically, part time jobs with guaranteed training included for long-term unemployed youth) if elected; however, they lost the election. This is still Labour Party policy - however, <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> universal basic income as a possible alternative policy.|$|E
500|$|The museum's display items {{feature the}} arm of a Slitheen (Raxacoricofallapatorian) from [...] "Aliens of London", which Rose recognises, and {{something}} that the Doctor refers to as [...] "An old friend, well, enemy... "– a Cyberman head (from Revenge of the Cybermen, but the label on its display case references The Invasion). A reference book, Doctor Who: The Visual Dictionary, describes the exhibit behind the Doctor's and Rose's heads when <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> the Cyberman's helmet as the decayed head of a Sea Devil from the Jon Pertwee serial The Sea Devils.|$|E
500|$|Other {{reviews of}} the book's {{illustrations}} were positive. Beier writes highly of the illustrations and states that Dyer's paintings of the dogs' faces are priceless, particularly in the scenes where <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> {{each other through the}} fence and those where they are in their owners' arms. Similarly, the Kirkus reviewer calls the illustrations charming and writes that they [...] "have all the clever details that are Dyer's signature touch", noting specifically the lavender frames of Miss Violet's eyeglasses and the inclusion of the dogs' names on their collars. Fletcher suggests that, apart from the [...] "ominous grays and greens" [...] in the illustrations of the forest scenes with the bear, the pastel-colored illustrations in the book are evocative of 1940s picture postcards, which she considers [...] "just right for such jolly capers".|$|E

500|$|There is no {{wheelchair}} {{access to}} the southbound platform; the ramp to the northbound platform is steeper than 1 in 12, making it unsuitable for wheelchair users, {{and there is a}} large height difference from the train doors to the platform. In 2011 the government announced a £37.5 million scheme to improve stations under an [...] "Access For All Mid-Tier programme", of which £1,023,000 was to go towards building new ramps at Nailsea and Backwell. The works were due to start in 2013, but were delayed until 2014 due to a need to repair subsidence on the embankment and wait for works on the car park to be completed. However, due to the delays the funding was withdrawn. Further funding was secured in 2015, but plans for ramps were shelved entirely in 2016 due to fears of further subsidence. Great Western Railway have stated <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> installing lifts instead.|$|E
500|$|The {{two girls}} gaze out wistfully {{from beneath the}} outstretched arms of Mrs. Mason. The hats that the {{children}} wear are drawn {{in such a way}} that they form halos around their heads, a touch Blake also uses in Songs of Innocence and of Experience to indicate the innate and divine visionary capacity of the child (see for example [...] "The Ecchoing Green" [...] and [...] "The Little oy Found"). The children’s eyes are open – <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> what a fine morning it is and longing to take part in it. They cannot participate, however, for they are under the suffocating influence of Mrs. Mason. In contrast to the children’s halo-like hats Mrs. Mason wears a large cumbrous bonnet. Her eyes are downcast to such an extent that they appear to be shut. Blake often draws Urizen's eyes in this way to signify the blindness of his rational and materialist ‘Single vision.’ See for example plates 1, 9 and 22 of The Book of Urizen and plate 11 of For Children: The Gates of Paradise where Urizenic 'Aged Ignorance,’ wearing large spectacles, blindly clips the wings of a child thus preventing its imaginative flight in the morning sunrise. Ironically then, Mrs. Mason is the only individual in the illustration who is not seeing what a fine morning it is. She looks down at the hard factual earth, ignoring the infinite and holy life around her. (emphasis Mitchell's) ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{association}} of Photorealism to Trompe L'oeil is a wrongly attributed comparison, {{an error in}} observation or interpretation made by many critics of the 1970s and 1980s. [...] Trompe L'oeil paintings attempt to [...] "fool the eye" [...] and make the viewer think he is seeing an actual object, not a painted one. When observing a Photorealist painting, the viewer is always aware that <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> a painting.|$|E

2500|$|Justice Souter wrote a dissent {{joined by}} Justice Stevens, Justice Ginsburg and Justice Breyer, saying {{that despite the}} fact that Ashcroft and Mueller had conceded that an officer could be subject to Bivens {{liability}} as a supervisor on grounds other than respondeat superior, [...] "(t)he court apparently rejects this concession and ... does away with supervisory liability under Bivens. The majority then misapplies the pleading standard under Bell Atlantic Corp. v. Twombly, 550 U.S. 544 (2007), to conclude that the complaint fails to state a claim." [...] Souter {{goes on to say that}} the main fallacy in the majority’s position is because <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> Iqbal's allegations in isolation and not as a unit. Furthermore, Iqbal is alleging not only that Ashcroft and Mueller allowed the discrimination policy, but that they created it.|$|E
2500|$|Released in 1915, The Birth of a Nation {{has been}} {{credited}} as groundbreaking among its contemporaries for its innovative {{application of the}} medium of film. According to the film historian Kevin Brownlow, the film was [...] "astounding in its time" [...] and initiated [...] "so many advances in film-making technique that it was rendered obsolete within a few years". The content of the work, however, has received widespread criticism for its blatantly racist and fantastical depictions of scenes that are presented onscreen as if in documentary form. [...] Film critic Roger Ebert writes: Certainly The Birth of a Nation (1915) presents a challenge for modern audiences. Unaccustomed to silent films and uninterested in film history, they find it quaint and not to their taste. Those evolved enough to understand what <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> find the early and wartime scenes brilliant, but cringe during the postwar and Reconstruction scenes, which are racist in the ham-handed way of an old minstrel show or a vile comic pamphlet. Mary Pickford said: [...] "Birth of a Nation was the first picture that really made people take the motion picture industry seriously".|$|E
