5|$|The film's visual style {{includes}} abrupt cuts, rapid camera movement, extensive superimposition, dim lighting, {{and shapes}} and forms in twisted and disoriented angles. Filmed {{with a budget}} of only $97 ($ in today's dollars), it includes a combination of close-ups of live actors and long shots of miniature sets, which were made from such items as cardboard, paper cubes, <b>tin</b> <b>cans,</b> cigar boxes, and toy trains. With no access to Hollywood studios or equipment, most of the filming {{took place in the}} filmmakers' residences, with walls painted black for use as a background.|$|E
5|$|Webs are {{typically}} established in low-growing dune plants and other vegetation {{such as the}} native Pingao (Desmoschoenus spiralis) or the introduced marram grass (Ammophila arenaria). They may also build their webs under driftwood, stones, or other debris such as empty <b>tin</b> <b>cans</b> or bottles. Webs are almost always constructed over open sand and near the ground so as to catch crawling insects for food. Spiders inhabiting dune grasses construct their webs in open spaces between the grass tufts, while spiders inhabiting areas of shrubbery do so {{on the underside of}} a plant overhanging open sand. It has been found that these patches of open sand are necessary for katipo to build their webs as plants that envelop sand dunes in dense cover, such as exotic plants like kikuyu or buffalo grass, create an environment unsuitable for web construction. The katipo therefore prefers to spin its web amongst pingao plants as this plants growth pattern leaves patches of sand between each plant. The wind can then blow insects and other prey through these gaps and into the web. Marram grass has been extensively planted in New Zealand to help stabilise sand dunes and has largely replaced pingao in many areas. Because marram grass grows in a very tight formation only leaving small gaps between tuffs, this makes it difficult for the katipo to construct a suitable web for capturing prey.|$|E

5|$|A film studio set {{was created}} by photographing several reel spools with strips of film {{dangling}} {{against a background of}} blinking lights. The casting office {{was created by}} silhouetting strips of cardboard against a white background. To portray the mental anguish of the protagonist, strips of paper were cut into the shape of twisted trees, which were silhouetted against a background of moving shadows and set in motion with an electric fan. To create a scene {{near the end of the}} film, when the protagonist starts becoming delirious, the camera moves through a maze of different sized cubes, with geometric designs inside them, all placed on a flat, shiny service. The heaven setting was also a miniature set created from paper cubes, <b>tin</b> <b>cans,</b> cigar boxes, toy trains, and a motorized Erector Set. No still photos were taken for the film, but illustrations showing prism and kaleidoscope effects have been made by enlarging frames of negative. The paper prints were considerably softer than the movie print in order to avoid graininess. The final film was edited to a one-reel length of 1,200 feet of film strip, featuring about 150 scenes. Florey said it featured the same number of angles as full-length feature films of the time. Although the film was carefully edited to be synchronized with Rhapsody in Blue, much of the original lyrical quality has been lost in shortened and modified versions of the film.|$|E

25|$|Early <b>tin</b> <b>cans</b> were sealed by {{soldering}} with a tin-lead alloy, {{which could}} lead to lead poisoning. Infamously, in the 1845 Arctic expedition of Sir John Franklin, crew members suffered from severe lead poisoning, thought to be caused by eating tin canned food. More recent research suggests the lead poisoning was {{more likely to have been}} caused by the water pipe system on the two ships.|$|E
25|$|The primary {{building}} block of polycarbonates, bisphenol A (BPA), is an estrogen-like endocrine disruptor that may leach into food.

50|$|<b>Tin</b> <b>can</b> {{building}} in New Mexico {{originated in the}} early 1980s {{as a response to}} the massive amounts of trash being discarded and the wasteful nature of common building practices. <b>Tin</b> <b>can</b> construction was an attempt to utilize a readily available resource that was normally sent to landfills or recycling centers. This led to various experiments in <b>tin</b> <b>can</b> building, including space-filler between wooden frames in traditional house styles and creating domes and archways using cans and cement. Within time, more simplified and practical methods were developed, such as the earthship <b>tin</b> <b>can</b> wall. The main person behind these efforts was Mike Reynolds, also creator of the earthship building method.|$|R
50|$|<b>Tin</b> <b>Can</b> Island Port {{was built}} in 1981 and opened in 1997.

25|$|Strong magnets {{are used}} to {{separate}} out ferrous metals, such as iron, steel, and <b>tin</b> <b>cans.</b> Non-ferrous metals are ejected by magnetic eddy currents in which a rotating magnetic field induces an electric current around the aluminum cans, which in turn creates a magnetic eddy current inside the cans. This magnetic eddy current is repulsed by a large magnetic field, and the cans are ejected {{from the rest of}} the recyclate stream.|$|E
25|$|Other {{materials}} were also scavenged, such as Klim cans; <b>tin</b> <b>cans</b> that had originally held powdered milk {{supplied by the}} Red Cross for the prisoners. The metal in the cans could be fashioned into various tools and items, for example scoops and lamps, fueled by fat skimmed off soup served at the camp and collected in tiny tin vessels, with wicks made from old and worn clothing. The main use of the Klim tins, however, was for the extensive ventilation ducting in all three tunnels.|$|E
25|$|By this time, {{the strike}} had {{severely}} affected the nation. A half million workers {{were laid off}} as companies lacked steel to keep plants running. The number of railroad cars loaded in the week ending July 7, 1952, was the lowest since records had been kept, and many railroads began to suffer financial difficulty. California growers faced a loss of $200 million because {{there was not enough}} tin to make <b>tin</b> <b>cans</b> for their crops. On July 22, the United States Army shut down its largest shell-making plant {{due to a lack of}} steel.|$|E
