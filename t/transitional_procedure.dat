40|$|Most {{optimization}} {{problems in}} the field of fluid mechanics can be classified as either topology or shape optimization. Although topology and shape have been considered mutually exclusive optimization methods since their inception, it is conceivable that they will find choicest solutions in tandem, with shape optimization refining a solution found by topology. However, linking the topology optimization problem to that of shape is not trivial and, to the authors' knowledge, has yet to be formally attempted. This paper pro- poses a novel <b>transitional</b> <b>procedure</b> that post-processes 2 D adjoint topology solutions,fitting the interface between the solid and fluid topological domains to create a parameterized solution which can be used as either a CAD-compatible representation of the interface or a source for grid generation from which a shape optimization loop can be initialized. The interface to be fit can be extracted from any topological field with distinct fluid and solid domains, meaning that the proposed transition process is independent of the topology approach utilized. To conveniently describe the interface between the solid and fluid topological domains, the topology optimization process employed in this paper is ltered using the level set method. The interface is fit with non-uniform rational B-spline (NURBS) curves through application of sensitivitiesgarnered from the solution of an auxiliary inverse design problem which aims at reducing the difference between signed-distance fields generated about both the NURBS curve being optimized and the section of interface being fit. The geometry defined by the fit NURBS curves is then (optionally) used to build a boundary-fitted grid on which a shape optimization loop is performed. The parameterized result of the topology to shape transition process is compared to that of shape optimization in 2 D cases with internal, incompressible fluid flows...|$|E

These crafts could gain unique utility from {{the ability to}} fly to remote locations, land, then walk to perform close quarters inspection of the area. This thesis presents a novel hexapod-quadcopter design with multicopter flight hardware directly embedded in the hexapod legs. The robot was assembled from custom designed 3 D printed structural components. Software was developed for the walking and flying locomotion methods as well as <b>transitional</b> <b>procedures</b> necessary to switch between these two modes.

40|$|International audienceThis study investigates {{when and}} how French-learning {{children}} acquire the main grammatical constraint on the noun category, i. e. the obligatory use of a preceding determiner. Spontaneous speech samples coming from the corpora of twenty children in each of three age groups, 1; 8, 2; 6, 3; 3, were transcribed and coded with respect to morphosyntactic, lexical and length properties of nouns. Results indicate that noun grammaticalization is a gradual process which involves early <b>transitional</b> <b>procedures,</b> {{as well as an}} increasing diversity in the content and contexts of determiner use. In support of prosodic hypotheses, noun length effects (in favor of monosyllabic nouns) mostly occurred at 1; 8. Animacy effects supporting the lexical hypothesis (in favor of inanimate nouns) occurred at 2; 6 and 3; 3. We suggest that noun grammaticalization is influenced by both prosodic and lexical factors. Prosodic influences predominate in the first steps of the developmental process, while lexical influences emerge in later steps...|$|R
40|$|Beliefs, emotions, and {{perception}} of socioemotional climate were analyzed in people affected and unaffected by past political violence in Chile (N = 1278). Compared with unaffected people, affected people reported {{a more positive}} attitude toward <b>transitional</b> justice <b>procedure,</b> were better informed, {{were more likely to}} reject an attitude of forgetting about the past, regarded institutional apologies as less sincere and effective, judged the current social climate as less positive, reported higher negative emotions related to the past, and showed less purpose in life. No differences were found for forgiveness or for outcomes of the <b>transitional</b> justice <b>procedures</b> or Truth Commissions, such as documentation of the truth or creation of an inclusive collective memory. Across groups, a negative view of forgiveness and a positive view of Truth Commissions dominated the picture. However, compared with nonvictims, victims also reported more pride and were more likely to endorse Universalist values, and this suggested that victims were subject, simultaneously, to a long-term negative impact of past events and a process of posttraumatic growth...|$|R

40|$|International Criminal Tribunals are {{certainly}} the most outstanding among the resurgence of International Tribunals because they appeared just after serious humanitarian crises (ex-Yugoslavia and Rwanda) before leading to a permanent Tribunal (the International Criminal Court) which coexists {{with other types of}} Tribunals. For a long time, this heterogeneous whole has been looking for its own model of justice and this has led to some poor management. Furthermore, although the wish to punish the main criminals for humanitarian crimes exists, it has to be reconciled with international political necessities, and it is impossible to forget the first goal of the international community, which is to prevent the crimes the international criminal tribunals are in charge of judging.

40|$|The {{international}} community is increasingly interested in promoting post-conflict reconciliation {{in a variety of}} forms, with trials and truth commissions featured most prominently. The contemporary academic discussion over transitional justice (and the practice of transitional justice itself) is largely focused on whether and how these types of large-scale national transitional justice mechanisms contribute to reconciliation. This article examines the promise and reality of the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia (ICTY) to contribute to national reconciliation. Ultimately, the ability of state-wide policies to contribute to reconciliation rests on the active participation of local level actors. This requires political backing {{at the state and local}} level beyond that of just the {{international community}}. More attention needs to be paid to domestic cultural factors in the initial decision to implement state-wide <b>transitional</b> justice <b>procedures,</b> and bottom-up mechanisms must be built into any large scale approach to reconciliation...|$|R
40|$|The underrepresentation of Asian {{states as}} {{parties to the}} Rome Statute has {{elicited}} concerns that the region is significantly falling behind in developing and enforcing international criminal justice. This view accords significance to ratification of the Rome Statute as the primary measure of a country’s willingness {{to give effect to}} the norms protected by international criminal law. However, the development of international criminal justice mechanisms and substantive law has not entirely escaped Southeast Asia, which has seen the adoption of a spectrum of approaches to international criminal justice, including the establishment of international(ised) criminal institutions, Rome Statute ratifications, and the adoption of domestic legislation addressing international crimes – as well as other <b>transitional</b> justice <b>procedures.</b> This thesis identifies the laws and institutions for prosecuting international crimes in Southeast Asia and considers the arguments presented by different actors to influence states’ approaches toward international criminal justice. It suggests that a linear account of these developments as deriving from externally driven norm diffusion is incomplete. Instead, drawing particularly on the experiences of Cambodia, the Philippines and Indonesia, this thesis argues that states, international organisations and non-state actors in Southeast Asia have engaged in a process of localisation leading to the adaptation of the international criminal justice norm. The development of mechanisms for prosecuting international crimes across Southeast Asia challenges assumptions about the temporal progression of norm diffusion, spatial designations between ‘local’ and ‘international’ ideas and actors, and the direction in which ideas and influences evolve across the world. This thesis makes significant and original contributions to knowledge by applying a ‘localisation’ framework to analyse debates about international criminal justice, including with reference to three case studies, and by extending and updating earlier surveys of international criminal laws in Southeast Asian states...|$|R
40|$|Understanding {{the normal}} {{development}} of the human gut microbiome is of great interest. This is mainly due to possibilities for predicting and preventing disease and developing probiotic treatments. Escherichia coli (E. coli) {{is one of the}} first organisms to colonize the infant gut, and is used as an indicator organism for changes in the population structure microbiome as a whole. In order to more accurately map the {{development of the}} infant gut microbiome, and to prepare for large scale studies in the future, a novel methodology was tested where fragments of the E. coli house-keeping genes malate dehydrogenase (mdh) and tryptophan synthase alpha subunit (trpa) were amplified from fecal samples taken over the course of the first year of life of a healthy human infant, and sequenced using Pacific Biosciences Single molecule real time (SMRT) sequencing with sample multiplexing. Strains were phylogenetically categorized using database sequences for known reference strains. In this study, eleven distinct mdh alleles and eight distinct trpA alleles were observed in the infant during the sampling period. In theory, this indicates that at least eleven unique E. coli strains were observed to be colonizing the infant over the study period. This is many more than previous studies have observed and is possibly due to the large number of samples from a single infant that were analyzed. All alleles have been previously recorded in the MLST databases for both the mdh and trpA alleles. However, it was only possible to match four of the mdh and trpA alleles with each other, using common occurrence in the sequencing data, and thus postulate that they occur on the same genome and represent a unique strain. Of the strains that were identified, we observed populations dynamics with some strains having a dominant position in the E. coli population during distinct time periods, separated by transitional periods with higher strain diversity. Some of these shifts in strain composition correlated with environmental factors, such as travel or changes in diet. The procedure successfully allowed for the mapping of the development of the infant gut microbiome with a much higher resolution than previous studies, and allowed for the temporal pinpointing of when changes in E. coli strain composition occurs and how strain composition fluctuates in <b>transitional</b> periods. The <b>procedure</b> can easily be adapted to map and compare the development of the early gut microbiome of multiple infants, although further optimization of the procedure would be desirable to improve the signal to noise ratio...|$|R
