5|$|Astronomers did not observe {{large amounts}} of water {{following}} the collisions, and later impact studies found that fragmentation and destruction of the cometary fragments in an 'airburst' probably occurred at much higher altitudes than previously expected, with even the largest fragments being destroyed when the pressure reached , well above the expected depth of the water layer. The smaller fragments were probably destroyed before <b>they</b> <b>even</b> reached the cloud layer.|$|E
5|$|Longren {{obtained}} {{space in}} Topeka {{for a small}} factory and {{enlisted the help of}} his brother Ereanius and his friend William Janicke, a fellow mechanic. Together the three men began working on Longren's design for a new airplane, despite having no prior aviation experience or professional assistance. The trio built the prototype in complete secrecy, wishing to forestall publicity of any potential failures; <b>they</b> <b>even</b> disassembled the craft and transported it discreetly in boxes to its first flight trial.|$|E

5|$|There {{has been}} {{increasing}} recognition {{of the extent to}} which birds engage in play. Juvenile common ravens are among the most playful of bird species. They have been observed to slide down snowbanks, apparently purely for fun. <b>They</b> <b>even</b> engage in games with other species, such as playing catch-me-if-you-can with wolves, otters and dogs. Common ravens are known for spectacular aerobatic displays, such as flying in loops or interlocking talons with each other in flight.|$|E

5|$|A complex courting ritual {{performed}} underwater characterises the crested and marbled newts. Males are territorial and use leks, or courtship arenas, small {{patches of}} clear ground where they display and attract females. When they encounter other males, {{they use the}} same postures as described below for courting to impress their counterpart. Occasionally, <b>they</b> <b>even</b> bite each other; marbled newts seem more aggressive than crested newts. Males also frequently disturb the courting of other males and try to guide the female away from their rival. Pheromones are used to attract females, and once a male has found one he will pursue her and position {{himself in front of}} her. After this first orientation phase, courtship proceeds with display and spermatophore transfer.|$|E

5|$|At Elizabeth's first {{interrogation}} session, the Japanese {{told her}} that some ships had been sunk in the harbour {{and they wanted to}} know the location of a large amount of money. She claimed no knowledge of the matter but was repeatedly interrogated and beaten. At various times, the Kempeitai forced Elizabeth to kneel on some angled bars of wood on the floor. They stripped her topless and tied her to the wood so she could not go either forwards or backwards. Then they applied electric shocks to her. <b>They</b> <b>even</b> brought in her husband to let him see her being tortured. After nine months in captivity, Elizabeth had lost half her body weight.|$|E

She explains to him what has happened, and turns {{on the evening news}} to show him the interview with his rescuer. However, watching Dees speak, Black quickly realises he is the bomber. The FBI locate Dees' home, but his electronic surveillance had alerted him long before, and he has escaped before <b>they</b> <b>even</b> arrive. However, as Black sits in his car, he receives a call from Dees, who has booby-trapped the car. The FBI are able to monitor this call with Dees' equipment. Dees tells Black that they will both soon be famous, letting Black know that he has a remote detonator for the car's explosives. Before he can use it, he is killed by a police marksman.|$|E
5|$|Bradford City {{became the}} first league {{football}} team from the county, before <b>they</b> <b>even</b> had a team or played a game. They and Chelsea, who were elected to the league two years later, share {{the distinction of being}} the only clubs to join the league without having played a competitive fixture. A summer archery contest, which had been organised {{to raise money for the}} rugby league club, was used to finance the new club, and Manningham's colours of claret and amber were adopted as Bradford City's kit, but with Manningham's hoops changed to stripes.|$|E

5|$|During the Permian, the dragonflies Odonata {{were the}} {{dominant}} aerial predator and probably dominated terrestrial insect predation as well. True Odonata {{appeared in the}} Permian and all are amphibian. Their prototypes are the oldest winged fossils, {{go back to the}} Devonian, and are different from other wings in every way. Their prototypes may have had the beginnings of many modern attributes even by late Carboniferous and it is possible that <b>they</b> <b>even</b> captured small vertebrates, for some species had a wing span of 71cm. The earliest beetle-like species during the Permian had pointed, leather like forewings with cells and pits. Hemiptera, or true bugs had appeared in the form of Arctiniscytina and Paraknightia having forewings with unusual venation, possibly diverging from Blattoptera.|$|E
5|$|Firefighters began {{experiencing}} {{problems before}} <b>they</b> <b>even</b> reached the fire. By the time firefighters reached the 11th floor {{the building had}} lost power after {{the heat from the}} blaze damaged electrical cables. The emergency generator never began producing electricity, and despite efforts to restore power the building was without electricity for the entirety of the event. This forced firefighters to work in darkness and without the aid of elevators. In addition, the transformers that provided power to the neighboring Girard Trust Building were in the basement of One Meridian Plaza. The transformers were eventually shut down due to water accumulation in the basement and firefighters directing water streams from that building had to do so without the aid of elevators.|$|E
5|$|Her first {{partner was}} Roberto Fernández Beyró, {{with whom she}} had a {{relationship}} from 1941 to 1944: The relationship ended when Fernandez Beyró asked her to give up her career. Two years later, during the filming of Maria Rosa (1946), she met the Spanish actor Alberto Closas, whom she married in 1950. They formed an artistic partnership as well as being a married couple and worked on films and plays together. In 1953, Bence returned from working abroad to discover Closas was having an affair, and decided to end the marriage. Bence maintained a good relationship with Closas {{for the rest of his}} life; <b>they</b> <b>even</b> worked together again and she mourned his death in 1994.|$|E

In 1917, Vizzini was sentenced to 20 years in first instance for fraud, corruption and murder, but he was absolved thanks to powerful friends who exonerated him. He made his fortune {{on the black market}} during World War I, and expanded his activities to the sulphur mines. As a representative of a consortium of sulphur mine operators, Vizzini participated in high-level meetings in Rome and London concerning government subsidies and tariffs, next to such men as Guido Donegani of Montecatini chemical industries and , Finance minister during Benito Mussolini’s fascist regime.|$|E

The annual bake sale also suffers– without Marge's marshmallow squares, the Springfield Park Commission fails to raise enough money to pay for a statue of Abraham Lincoln. Instead they purchase one of Jimmy Carter. The townspeople are enraged by this, and riot. When Marge is released from jail, the townspeople welcome her back and apologize for suspecting her. <b>They</b> <b>even</b> unveil a statue for Marge, though it is just the Carter statue with Marge's hair added to it.

By July 16, an {{armistice}} was signed at the Arbol de La Paz (a large ceiba tree) in Santiago de Cuba by U.S. and Spanish forces ending hostilities in Cuba and its waters. The United States then directed its undivided military resources to Puerto Rico. Two {{leaders of the}} Puerto Rican section of the Cuban Revolutionary Party, Dr. Julio J. Henna and Roberto H. Todd, had written to U.S. President McKinley asking that Puerto Rico be included in whatever intervention was planned for Cuba as early as March 10. <b>They</b> <b>even</b> provided the U.S. government with information about the Spanish military presence on the island.|$|E
5|$|Since archaeoastronomers {{disagree}} {{so widely}} on {{the characterization of}} the discipline, <b>they</b> <b>even</b> dispute its name. All three major international scholarly associations relate archaeoastronomy {{to the study of}} culture, using the term Astronomy in Culture or a translation. Michael Hoskin sees {{an important part of the}} discipline as fact-collecting, rather than theorizing, and proposed to label this aspect of the discipline Archaeotopography. Ruggles and Saunders proposed Cultural Astronomy as a unifying term for the various methods of studying folk astronomies. Others have argued that astronomy is an inaccurate term, what are being studied are cosmologies and people who object to the use of logos have suggested adopting the Spanish cosmovisión.|$|E
5|$|There are {{texts in}} which Isis travels {{in the wider}} world. She moves among {{ordinary}} humans who are unaware of her identity, and she even appeals to these people for help. This is another unusual circumstance, for in Egyptian myth, gods and humans are normally separate. As {{in the first phase}} of the myth, she often has the aid of other deities, who protect her son in her absence. According to one magical spell, seven minor scorpion deities travel with and guard Isis as she seeks help for Horus. <b>They</b> <b>even</b> take revenge on a wealthy woman who has refused to help Isis by stinging the woman's son, making it necessary for Isis to heal the blameless child. This story conveys a moral message that the poor can be more virtuous than the wealthy and illustrates Isis's fair and compassionate nature.|$|E
