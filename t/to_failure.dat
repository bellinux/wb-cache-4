5|$|A {{third major}} {{criticism}} of the Act {{is that it was}} poorly administered. The Act purposefully brought together competing interests (labor and business, big business and small business, etc.) in a coalition to support passage of the legislation, but these competing interests soon fought one another over the Act's implementation. As a consequence, NRA collapsed due <b>to</b> <b>failure</b> of leadership and confusion about its goals. By the end of 1934, NRA leaders had practically abandoned the progressive interventionist policy which motivated the Act's passage, and were supporting free-market philosophies—contributing to the collapse of almost all industry codes.|$|E
5|$|Another {{study has}} implicated EFS in the Chediak-Higashi {{syndrome}} (CHS). This rare and severe autosomal recessive disorder associated with partial albinism, peripheral neuropathy, mild coagulation defects and propensity to recurrent bacterial and fungal infections, caused by incomplete phagocytosis due <b>to</b> <b>failure</b> in phagolysosome formation. This work identified a direct interaction in vitro and in vivo between EFS and LYST (lysosomal trafficking regulator, aka CHS1 - Chediak-Higashi syndrome 1), a large protein that regulates the intracellular trafficking of proteins through endosomes that is mutated in CHS. These results may imply {{the role of}} EFS as a disease progression modifier, although further testing and establishment of mechanism is necessary.|$|E

5|$|In {{addition}} to its scientific results, Hubble has also {{made significant contributions to}} aerospace engineering, in particular the performance of systems in low Earth orbit. These insights result from Hubble's long lifetime on orbit, extensive instrumentation, and return of assemblies to the Earth where they can be studied in detail. In particular, Hubble has contributed to studies of the behavior of graphite composite structures in vacuum, optical contamination from residual gas and human servicing, radiation damage to electronics and sensors, and the long term behavior of multi-layer insulation. One lesson learned was that gyros assembled using pressurized oxygen to deliver suspension fluid were prone <b>to</b> <b>failure</b> due to electric wire corrosion. Gyros are now assembled using pressurized nitrogen.|$|E

5|$|The campaign's {{ultimate}} limitation was {{the poor}} formulation of military strategy. The types of targets selected from one operation {{to the next}} differed radically and no sustained pressure was put on any one type of British target.

5|$|The {{first two}} attacks had been {{successful}} and as Allied commanders began {{to believe that}} a breakthrough was possible further attacks were made at Poelcappelle on 9 October and at Passchendaele on 12 October despite heavy rain that turned the ground into a muddy quagmire. Both attacks were ultimately doomed <b>to</b> <b>failure,</b> with heavy casualties, as the attacks foundered in the mud and as the battle petered out, it was decided {{that it was time for}} the Australians to be withdrawn from the line. This was completed by 14 November 1917. Over the course of the eight weeks they had been involved in the fighting around Ypres, they had suffered 38,000 casualties.|$|E
5|$|The {{relevance}} of primary implant stability decreases gradually with regrowth of bone tissue around the implant {{in the first}} weeks after surgery, leading to secondary stability. Secondary stability {{is different from the}} initial stabilization, because it results from the ongoing process of bone regrowth into the implant (osseointegration). When this healing process is complete, the initial mechanical stability becomes biological stability. Primary stability is critical to implantation success until bone regrowth maximizes mechanical and biological support of the implant. Regrowth usually occurs during the 3–4 weeks after implantation. Insufficient primary stability, or high initial implant mobility, can lead <b>to</b> <b>failure.</b>|$|E

5|$|During {{trials of}} the first submarines, the {{propulsion}} system {{was found to be}} prone <b>to</b> <b>failure</b> for a variety of reasons. Most failures were attributed to the fifteen-tank diesel fuel system: the tanks were designed to fill with salt water as they were emptied to maintain neutral buoyancy, but water would regularly enter the engines due to a combination of poor design, gravity separation of the fuel and water being insufficient, and operator error resulting from poor training. Problems were also caused by bacterial contamination of the diesel fuel, which, along with the salt water, would cause the fuel pumps to rust and other components to seize. The fuel-related issues were solved by installing coalescers, improving training and operational procedures, and adding biocides to the fuel.|$|E
5|$|Having {{failed to}} defeat the RAF, the Luftwaffe adopted a {{different}} and clearer strategy of strategic bombing known as The Blitz. However, as with the campaign against the RAF, the types of targets differed radically and no sustained pressure was put under any one type of British target. Disputes among the OKL staff revolved more around tactics than strategy. This method condemned the offensive over Britain <b>to</b> <b>failure</b> before it had even begun. The end result of the air campaign against Britain in 1940 and 1941 was a decisive failure to end the war. As Hitler committed Germany to ever increasing military adventures, the Wehrmacht became increasingly overstretched {{and was unable to}} cope with a multi-front war. By 1944, the Allies were ready to launch Operation Overlord, the invasion of Western Europe. The Battle of Britain ensured that the Western Allies had a base from which to launch the campaign and {{that there would be a}} Western Allied presence on the battlefield to meet the Soviet Red Army in central Europe at the end of the war in May 1945.|$|E

40|$|Two major {{objectives}} of multipath routing schemes are congestion avoidance and resilience <b>to</b> <b>failures.</b> However, focusing on each objective alone severely deteriorates {{the quality of}} the other. More specifically, when multipath routing is employed for congestion avoidance, the traffic is distributed among several different paths, each potentially prone <b>to</b> network <b>failures.</b> Since any path failure results in the failure of the entire transmission, a "naive " use of multipath routing for load balancing may largely increase the vulnerability of the connections <b>to</b> network <b>failures.</b> On the other hand, when multipath routing is employed in order to improve the resilience <b>to</b> <b>failures,</b> most of the corresponding schemes focus on the establishment of pairs of disjoint paths. However, in many cases, this restrictive requirement may lead to the selection of poor routing paths that were not designed to transfer large volumes of data; thus, their employment may dramatically increase the congestion state of the network. In this work we establish efficient multipath routing schemes that incorporate the two fundamental {{objectives of}} congestion avoidance and resilience <b>to</b> <b>failures.</b> <b>To</b> the best of our knowledge, we are the first to relax the common requirement of disjoint paths that solely considers full (100 %) protection <b>to</b> single <b>failures,</b> into a weaker requirement that can accommodate any degree (0 %- 100 %) of protection i. e., any desired probability to survive a network failure. We incorporate this new concept in several polynomial schemes that enhance survivability while considering the resilience-congestion tradeoff. Then, we turn to consider the major weakness of multipath routing schemes that solely balance the network's load, namely, increased vulnerability <b>to</b> <b>failures.</b> Specifically, we establish a multipath routing scheme that minimizes the congestion state of the network while satisfying some essential reliability requirements. As the corresponding problem is shown to be intractable, we establish an efficient -optimal approximation scheme. ...|$|R

The church was later renamed to Masland Methodist church in 1925. Hoover stayed at the Rajang basin for another 31 years until his death from malaria in 1935 at Kuching general hospital. The construction of Lau King Howe Hospital was completed in 1936 to accommodate the growing population of Sibu. The hospital served Sibu people for 58 years until 1994 when a new hospital was constructed in Sibu.|$|E

5|$|The Rolls-Royce Mermaid {{propulsor}} pods {{fitted to}} QM2 {{have proven to}} be prone <b>to</b> <b>failure.</b> The failures had been so frequent and extensive that Carnival Corp. (USA), by way of its Cunard Line division, has taken Rolls-Royce Corp. (UK) to court in the United States in January 2009. The former placed claim that the Mermaid pod propulsion systems fitted to Cunard Line's flagship Queen Mary 2 are inherently defective in design. Cunard contends that Rolls Royce knew about the design deficiencies and deliberately conspired to mislead, deceive and defraud in the course of winning the contract. The Achilles’ heel of the design has been the motors' massive thrust bearings, which have continued to show a tendency to fail even after numerous attempts at redesign. In January 2011 Carnival Corporation was awarded US$24 million (approx. UK£15 million at the time of verdict) by the United States court due to the repeated failure of the propulsors.|$|E
