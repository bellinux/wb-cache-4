25|$|A notable {{example of}} {{applying}} π-π interactions in supramolecular assembly is {{the synthesis of}} catenane. The major challenge for the synthesis of catenane is <b>to</b> <b>interlock</b> molecules in a controlled fashion. Stoddart and co-workers developed a series of systems utilizing the strong π-π interactions between electron-rich benzene derivatives and electron-poor pyridinium rings. Catanene was synthesized by reacting bis(pyridinium) (A), bisparaphenylene-34-crown-10 (B), and 1, 4-bis(bromomethyl)benzene C (Fig. 2). The π-π interaction between A and B directed {{the formation of an}} interlocked template intermediate that was further cyclized by substitution reaction with compound C to generate the catenane product.|$|E

25|$|Basal Ichthyopterygia, {{like their}} land-dwelling ancestors, still had {{vertebrae}} that possessed {{a full set}} of processes that allowed them <b>to</b> <b>interlock</b> and articulate, forming a vertebral column supporting the weight of the body. As ichthyosaurs were fully aquatic, their bodies were supported by the Archimedes force exerted by the water; in other words, they were buoyant. Therefore, the vertebral processes had lost much of their function. Early ichthyosaurs proper had rear dorsal vertebrae that had become disc-shaped, like those of typical fishes. With more derived species, the front dorsals also became discs. Gradually, most processes were lost, including those for rib attachment. The vertebral bodies became much shorter. The front and rear sides of the discs were hollowed out, resulting in a so-called amphicoelous condition. A transverse cross-section of such a vertebra has an hourglass shape. This morphology is unique within the Amniota and makes discerning ichthyosaur vertebrae from those of other marine reptiles easy. The only process that kept its function was the spine at the top, serving as an attachment for the dorsal muscles. However, even the spine became a simple structure. The neural arch, of which it was an outgrowth, typically no longer fused to the vertebral centre.|$|E

500|$|During {{the second}} phase, after {{determining}} {{that the proposed}} weight of the monument was too great for the old foundation to safely bear, {{the thickness of the}} walls atop the unfinished stump was reduced and the foundation was strengthened by adding a large unreinforced concrete slab below the perimeter of the old foundation to increase the monument's load bearing area two and one half times. The slab was [...] thick, with an outer perimeter [...] square, an inner perimeter [...] square, with undisturbed loam inside the inner perimeter except for the water well. The area {{at the base of the}} second phase foundation is [...] The strengthened foundation (old foundation and concrete slab) has a total depth of [...] below the bottom of the lowest course of marble blocks (now below ground), and [...] below the entry lobby floor. Casey reported that nowhere did the load exceed [...] and did not exceed [...] near the outer perimeter. To properly distribute the load from the shaft to slab, about half by volume of the outer periphery of the old rubble foundation below its top step was removed. A continuous sloping unreinforced concrete buttress encircles what remains. The buttress is [...] square at its base, [...] square at its top, and [...] high. The perimeter of the original top step of the old rubble foundation rests on the larger top of the concrete buttress. Its slope (lower external angle from the vertical) is 49°. This buttress rests in a depression (triangular cross-section) on the top surface of the concrete slab. The slab was constructed by digging pairs of [...] wide drifts on opposite sides of the monument's center line to keep the monument properly balanced. The drifts were filled with unreinforced concrete with depressions or dowel stones on their sides <b>to</b> <b>interlock</b> the sections. An earthen terrace [...] wide with its top at the base of the walls and steep sides was constructed in 1880–81 over the reinforced foundation while the rest of the monument was being constructed. During 1887–88, a knoll was constructed around the terrace tapering out roughly [...] onto the surrounding terrain. This earthen terrace and knoll serves as an additional buttress for the foundation. The weight of the foundation is , including earth and gneiss rubble above the concrete foundation that is within its outer perimeter.|$|E
