5|$|Most {{bivalves}} adopt a sedentary or even sessile lifestyle, often spending <b>their</b> <b>whole</b> <b>lives</b> in {{the area}} in which they first settled as juveniles. The majority of bivalves are infaunal, living under the seabed, buried in soft substrates such as sand, silt, mud, gravel, or coral fragments. Many of these live in the intertidal zone where the sediment remains damp even when the tide is out. When buried in the sediment, burrowing bivalves are protected from the pounding of waves, desiccation, and overheating during low tide, and variations in salinity caused by rainwater. They are also {{out of the reach of}} many predators. Their general strategy is to extend their siphons to the surface for feeding and respiration during high tide, but to descend to greater depths or keep their shell tightly shut when the tide goes out. They use their muscular foot to dig into the substrate. To do this, the animal relaxes its adductor muscles and opens its shell wide to anchor itself in position while it extends its foot downwards into the substrate. Then it dilates the tip of its foot, retracts the adductor muscles to close the shell, shortens its foot and draws itself downwards. This series of actions is repeated to dig deeper.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, we have {{observed}} an interesting phenomenon in superscalar architectures with aggressive hardware mechanisms (such as register renaming and reorder buffers) : {{a significant number}} of program variables are "short-lived" in the sense that <b>their</b> <b>whole</b> <b>live</b> ranges occur entirely within the reorder buffer. Therefore, upon completion, the values of these short-lived variables {{do not need to be}} written (committed) back to the register files. Based on this observation, we have proposed a compile-time analysis method (called short-live-range analysis) and a simple architecture feature to avoid the useless commit of these short-lived variables. Furthermore, we propose a compiler mechanism to directly assign these variables to the reorder buffer (instead of the register file), thus decreasing the total requirements on the register file. We have implemented our scheme and our simulation results show: (1) the shortlive -range analysis and the proposed architecture feature can be succes [...] ...|$|R

25|$|Cavalry {{and battle}} {{exercises}} (often in forms of tournaments) became {{the lifestyle of}} the nobility, as it already was in feudal Western Europe. Usually, a lord was himself one of the soldiers, being the commander of his military retinue, a heavily equipped, constantly exercised mounted warrior, often with destrier, and pursuing the royal grant of knighthood which was a valued title and formed an upper level of the nobility (the uppermost was the circle of royal councillors). Some lesser noblemen remained squires, armigers for <b>their</b> <b>whole</b> <b>lives.</b> Sometimes a nobleman was himself the only soldier that his manor provided for the cavalry and possibly with less-than-adequate equipment. In some cases, some impoverished nobles provided a cavalryman together (it was actually unavoidable if a manor of lesser gentry was divided between several heirs, as the Swedish inheritance law provided, contrary to the primogeniture inheritances of French countries). It was also possible to have the obligation fulfilled by a paid employee - no particular condition required the lord {{himself to be a}} soldier (as evidenced by lord Bo Jonsson Grip, fiefholder of most of Finland, never becoming a soldier himself), it was just the evolving lifestyle of the noble class.|$|E
25|$|Studies {{show that}} {{according}} to their skeletal remains, most people who lived there were immigrants from diverse backgrounds. They lacked the chemical markers and osteological markers they would have {{if they had been}} living there <b>their</b> <b>whole</b> <b>lives.</b> Instead, there was bone damage from various species of water parasites indigenous to different areas of Peru. There were also varying osteological stressors and varying chemical densities suggesting varying long term diets characteristic of specific regions that were spaced apart. These diets are composed of varying levels of maize, potatoes, grains, legumes, and fish, but the overall most recent short-term diet for these people composed of less fish and more corn. This suggests that several of the immigrants were from more coastal areas and moved to Machu Picchu where corn was a larger portion of food intake. The skeletal remains found at Machu Picchu are also unique in their level of natural bone damage from laborious activities. Most people found at the site had lower levels of arthritis and bone fractures found in most sites of the Inca Empire. Inca individuals that have arthritis and bone fractures are typically those who performed heavy physical labor (such as the Mit'a) and/or served in the Inca military.|$|E

They become immortals in death along with even more fame and has as well achieved their goal from the beginning. They die in the name of their love when they really die in the name of fame. A status of nobility higher than us and pity for the tragedy that is their relationship. The tragedy is Antony and Cleopatra's own happy ending as death was a small price to pay to become real gods. They proved that the only death that could touch them were by their own hand, further increasing that godly power they received from the people. Now they are apart from those they watched, now they are above them, and now they will be worshipped as gods.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Very few {{research}} has been undertaken to explore how the people, whose rights to drive have been deprived <b>whole</b> <b>their</b> rest <b>lives,</b> travel to fulfill their needs for economic and social activities. In October 2001, the Taiwan Constitutional Court pointed out that to suspend drivers licenses <b>whole</b> <b>their</b> rest <b>lives</b> does not violate the Constitution. Driving is a necessity of living for modern people. Has the lifetime driver license suspension (LDLS) has deprived the rights of living, working, and moving freedom, and kicked those illegal drivers out of the road? This study investigated the travel behaviors of 244 drivers with LDLS and showed about 85 % of the punished drivers are still driving on the road. Most of them replied that LDLS has significantly changed their lives. And the impact of LDLS {{is much greater than}} criminal punishment, civil compensation, and moral condemnation.

40|$|Modern superscalar {{processors}} use advanced {{features like}} dynamic scheduling and speculative execution to exploit fine-grain parallelism. In {{order to support}} these features, they use complex hardware mechanisms like reorder buffers, instructions windows and renaming buffers. In this thesis, we have made an observation {{about the use of}} these mechanisms: a significant number of program variables are short-lived in the sense that <b>their</b> <b>whole</b> <b>live</b> ranges occur entirely within the reorder buffer. Therefore, the values produced by these short-lived variables {{do not need to be}} written back (committed) to the register file. Based on this observation, we have proposed a compiler analysis, which we call short-live-range analysis, and a simple architecture feature to avoid the useless commits of the values generated by these short-lived variables. Moreover, we have proposed a new register allocation scheme to assign these variables to the locations provided for register renaming (rather than to the register file), thus decreasing the register pressure. We have implemented his hardware/software codesign scheme using the McCAT testbed and the simulation results show: (1) the short-live-range analysis and the proposed architecture feature can be successfully used to avoid the useless commit of instructions to the register files; (2) the above mechanism can reduce the number of write ports to the register files without affecting performance; (3) the allocation of short-lived variables to the locations provided by the register files without affecting performance; (3) the allocation of short-lived variables to the locations provided by the register renaming mechanism can significantly reduce the introduction of spill code and improve the overall performance...|$|R

40|$|Uncertainty, mobility, and {{opportunity}} {{are some of}} the concepts used to describe people’s jobs in today’s flexible and rapidly-changing society. The working conditions of the past, when people tended to spend <b>their</b> <b>whole</b> working <b>lives</b> with the same or-ganization, have been progressively replaced with a scenario of great instability and in-security that may also, however, depending on the situation, offer more opportunities for personal initiative and independence. This duality is typical of a society that, after an era of open-ended employment, now comes to be known as a society of jobs to distin-guish it from the so-called society of work of the past. Greater economic energy and flexibility have certainly created conditions that enable organizations to be more com-petitive, as well as offering more opportunities for employees, but these changes have given rise to a greater uncertainty, instability and risk for the workers, which mean a subsequent increase in their levels of stress and anxiety.

50|$|The family factor, {{especially}} for married women, {{is one of}} the reasons that leads to more mobile inclination for women than men in job market. The stereotype forces married women to undertake more family responsibilities than men, so women have no choice but to relocate workplaces for fulfilling the family needs. Compared with men who have more freedom to decide their workplaces, to move frequently in working system is obvious a disadvantage for women to improve their positions or to earn more income. On the other hand, men are more willing to relocate workplaces when their wives have better income, but not their wives’ careers themselves, which means the power in family can also be transferred through women create more economic value than their husbands. This is the progress for women to develop their careers in recent years. Another source describes the variety of women’s careers in their lifetime as “snake-like”, meaning they move from job to job through <b>their</b> <b>whole</b> career <b>lives</b> flexibly.
