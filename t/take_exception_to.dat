She called it [...] "dangerous to say that biologists should have a monopoly on truth and ethics." ...|$|E

500|$|In March 1896 Marthinus Theunis Steyn, {{the young}} lawyer Kruger had {{encountered}} {{on the ship}} to England two decades earlier, became President of the Orange Free State. They quickly won each other's confidence; each man's memoirs would describe the other in glowing terms. Chamberlain began to <b>take</b> <b>exception</b> <b>to</b> the South African Republic's diplomatic actions, such as joining the Geneva Convention, which he said breached Article IV of the London Convention (which forbade extraterritorial dealings except vis-a-vis the Orange Free State). Chamberlain asserted that the Transvaal was still under British suzerainty, a claim Kruger called [...] "nonsensical". Kruger and Steyn concluded a treaty of trade and friendship in Bloemfontein in March 1897, along with a fresh military alliance binding each republic to defend the other's independence. Two months later Sir Alfred Milner became the new High Commissioner and Governor in Cape Town.|$|E

[...] Ernest received a deputation of Göttingen citizens, who, fearing student unrest, applauded the dismissals. However, he was widely criticised in Europe, especially in Britain. In the House of Commons, MP Colonel Thomas Perronet Thompson proposed to Parliament that if the as-yet-childless Queen Victoria died, making Ernest the British King, Parliament should declare that King Ernest had forfeited all rights to the British Throne by his actions.|$|E
500|$|Efforts at {{improvement}} {{before the}} bombing had in some respects made matters worse, cutting off the area north of the Arndale Centre– the exterior of which was widely unloved– {{from the rest of}} the city centre. A large building nearby, now redeveloped as The Printworks and formerly occupied by the Daily Mirror newspaper, had been unoccupied since 1987. Many locals therefore considered that [...] "the bomb was the best thing that ever happened to Manchester", as it cleared the way for redevelopment of the dysfunctional city centre, a view also expressed in 2007 by Terry Rooney, MP for Bradford North. The leader of the Liberal Democrat opposition on Manchester City Council, Simon Ashley, responded that [...] "I <b>take</b> <b>exception</b> <b>to</b> his [...] comments about the IRA bomb. No one who was in the city on that day, who lost their jobs or was scared witless or injured by the blast, would say the bomb was the best thing to happen to Manchester". [...] Sir Gerald Kaufman, MP for Manchester Gorton, stated that the bomb provided the opportunity for redeveloping Manchester city centre, although it was not fully exploited. [...] "The bomb was obviously bad but from a redevelopment point of view, it was a lost opportunity. While the area around St Ann's Square and Deansgate is not disagreeable, if you compare it with Birmingham and its exciting development, we've got nothing to touch that in Manchester". Howard Bernstein, chief executive of Manchester City Council, has been quoted as saying [...] "people say the bomb turned out to be a great thing for Manchester. That's rubbish." [...] There was already substantial regeneration and redevelopment taking place in the city centre {{before the bombing}}, in support of the Manchester bid for the 2000 Summer Olympics, its second Olympic bid. Tom Bloxham, chairman of property development group Urban Splash and of the Arts Council England (North West), agreed with Bernstein that the bomb attack was not the trigger for the large-scale redevelopment that has taken place in Manchester since the early 1990s: ...|$|E

2500|$|Academics such as Diamond (2005) Wirthlin (2009) <b>take</b> <b>exception</b> <b>to</b> {{the role}} of [...] "hot lesbian" [...] in advertisements, and what has turned {{lesbianism}} into a commodity. As Diamond (2005) states, [...] "media representations signal a new appreciation and celebration of women's sexual freedom and diversity. On the other hand {{this is not necessarily}} the case...by portraying it as a fashionable 'add on' to otherwise conventional heterosexuality" [...] (p.105). They argue that women view these advertisements and images as a true reflection of {{what it is to be}} lesbian, thus making it much harder for real lesbians to acknowledge their sexuality. Furthermore, Wirthlin (2009) points out that, [...] "In order to resist this we must first recognize the ubiquitous presence of [...] "fad" [...] lesbian images and then problematize their use in popular culture. Next, there needs to be an active resistance against these images through counterculture advertisements and the performative act of resistance, such as through the act of writing as oneself, by utilizing multiple voices and subjectivities" [...] (p.113). In both academics view, lesbian or bi-sexual women must be sure of what media means to them, and call into question things that do not appear [...] "authentic". Lesbians must also be educated on the topic of the [...] "hot lesbian", and ensure they do not fall into the [...] "heteronormative appropriation" [...] of advertising's effects.|$|E
2500|$|Mate is {{traditionally}} drunk {{in a particular}} social setting, such as family gatherings or with friends. The same gourd (cuia) and straw (bomba/bombilla) are used by everyone drinking. One person (known in Portuguese as the preparador, cevador, or patrão, and in Spanish as the cebador) assumes the task of server. Typically, the cebador fills the gourd and drinks the mate completely {{to ensure that it}} is free of particulate matter and of good quality. In some places, passing the first brew of mate to another drinker is considered bad manners, as it may be too cold or too strong; for this reason, the first brew is often called mate del zonzo (mate of the fool). The cebador possibly drinks the second filling, as well, if he or she deems it too cold or bitter. The cebador subsequently refills the gourd and passes it to the drinker to his or her right, who likewise drinks it all (there is not much; the mate is full of yerba, with room for little water), and returns it without thanking the server; a final gracias (thank you) implies that the drinker has had enough. The only exception to this order is if a new guest joins the group; in this case the new arrival receives the next mate, and then the cebador resumes the order of serving, and the new arrival will receive his or hers depending on his placement in the group. When no more tea remains, the straw makes a loud sucking noise, which is not considered rude. The ritual proceeds around the circle in this mode until the mate becomes lavado (washed out), typically after the gourd has been filled about 10 times or more depending on the yerba used (well-aged yerba mate is typically more potent, so provides a greater number of refills) and the ability of the cebador. When one has had one's fill of mate, he or she politely thanks the cebador, passing the mate back at the same time. It is impolite for anyone but the cebador to move the bombilla or otherwise mess with the mate; the cebador may <b>take</b> <b>exception</b> <b>to</b> this and not offer it to the offender again. When someone takes too long, others in the roda (Spanish: ronda; English: [...] "round") will likely politely warn him or her by saying [...] "bring the talking gourd" [...] (cuia de conversar); an Argentine equivalent, especially among young people, being no es un micrófono ("it's not a microphone"), an allusion to the drinkers holding the mate for too long, as if they were using it as a microphone to deliver a lecture.|$|E
