5|$|Although the U.S. {{administration}} has denied that devaluing their currency {{was part of}} their objectives for implementing quantitative easing, the practice can act to devalue a country's currency in two indirect ways. Firstly, it can encourage speculators to bet that <b>the</b> <b>currency</b> will decline in value. Secondly, the large increase in the domestic money supply will lower domestic interest rates, often they will become much lower than interest rates in countries not practising quantitative easing. This creates the conditions for a carry trade, where market participants can engage in a form of arbitrage, borrowing in <b>the</b> <b>currency</b> of the country practising quantitative easing, and lending {{in a country with}} a relatively high rate of interest. Because they are effectively selling <b>the</b> <b>currency</b> being used for quantitative easing on the international markets, this can increase the supply of <b>the</b> <b>currency</b> and hence push down its value. By October 2010 expectations in the markets were high that the United States, UK, and Japan would soon embark on a second round of QE, with the prospects for the Eurozone to join them less certain.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{constructs}} {{a search}} model of currency interdependence, and {{uses it to}} examine how in dollarized economies <b>the</b> foreign <b>currency</b> reacts to various shocks to <b>the</b> domestic <b>currency.</b> Currency interdependence is generated by allowing sellers {{to take into account}} their outside option of trading with <b>the</b> domestic <b>currency</b> while bargaining with buyers holding <b>the</b> foreign <b>currency.</b> <b>The</b> shocks consist in movements in the domestic interest rate, domestic inflation and <b>the</b> domestic <b>currency’s</b> market power. We show that if the purchasing power of <b>the</b> domestic <b>currency</b> is low, any shock that increases its value, such as a higher domestic interest rate, translates into a depreciation of <b>the</b> foreign <b>currency.</b> However, <b>the</b> result is opposite when the purchasing power of <b>the</b> domestic <b>currency</b> is high. We show that when money is indivisible these shocks can drive in or out <b>the</b> foreign <b>currency.</b> When money is divisible, this currency substitution effect is more limited. We use our results to discuss the opportunity of various de-dollarization policies and show that some can be counterproductive...|$|R

25|$|Currencies are traded {{against one}} another in pairs. Each {{currency}} pair thus constitutes an individual trading product and is traditionally noted XXXYYY or XXX/YYY, where XXX and YYY are the ISO 4217 international three-letter code of <b>the</b> <b>currencies</b> involved. <b>The</b> first <b>currency</b> (XXX) is <b>the</b> base <b>currency</b> that is quoted relative to <b>the</b> second <b>currency</b> (YYY), called <b>the</b> counter <b>currency</b> (or quote <b>currency).</b> For instance, <b>the</b> quotation EURUSD (EUR/USD) 1.5465 {{is the price of}} the Euro expressed in US dollars, meaning 1 euro = 1.5465 dollars. The market convention is to quote most exchange rates against the USD with the US dollar as <b>the</b> base <b>currency</b> (e.g. USDJPY, USDCAD, USDCHF).

5|$|In March 1948 Rau became {{chairman}} of the German Economic Commission (Deutsche Wirtschaftskommission or DWK), which during this period became the centralised administrative organisation for the Soviet Occupation Zone and the predecessor of the future East German government. The organisation existed {{during a time of}} very difficult challenges coming from different sides. A particularly momentous event during this time was <b>the</b> <b>currency</b> reform of 1948. On 20June 1948 the western German zones introduced a new currency, leaving the eastern zone to use the old common currency. In order to avoid inflation, the DWK under Rau's leadership, was forced to follow quickly with its own reform and issued an own currency too. In doing so, the DWK also exploited <b>the</b> <b>currency</b> reform to redistribute capital by using different exchange rates for private and state-run companies. The disagreement, which of the two new currencies should be used in Berlin, triggered the Berlin Blockade by the USSR and the western airborne supply of West Berlin.|$|E
