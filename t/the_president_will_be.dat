After Zartan announces that Cobra will replace the Joes as the premier U.S. special forces unit, Lady Jaye deduces that someone is impersonating the President, and Roadblock leads them to General Joseph Colton (Bruce Willis), who provides them with weapons, and helps them infiltrate a fundraising event that <b>the</b> <b>President</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> attending. Lady Jaye steals a sample of the President's DNA and confirms that he is Zartan.

A presidential 21-gun salute is also given to the President during this time by a select battery from the Singapore Artillery. It is customary that the President speaks to {{some members of the}} Guard-of-honor contingents as he passes by. After the inspection ends, the President will return to the podium before the Guard-of-honor contingents presents a Feu-de-Joie led by the Parade Commander.|$|E

50|$|According to a The Washington Quarterly article {{written by}} Ian Bremmer and Samuel Charap in 2006-2007, {{at the start}} of his presidency, Vladimir Putin {{announced}} that he would consolidate political powers in Russia into the so-called power vertical. However, despite being considered successful by many, this controversial endeavour partially backfired and led to the increasing factionalism within <b>the</b> <b>president's</b> inner circle. Although other institutions now became largely irrelevant, disputes and clashes between Kremlin factions, rather than <b>the</b> <b>president's</b> <b>will,</b> <b>are</b> getting more and more important in determining major policy outcomes, Bremmer and Charap write.|$|R

2500|$|It {{is legally}} unclear whether {{removal of a}} {{government}} {{with the consent of}} the President would constitute a coup, as that term is usually understood. According to the Constitution of Fiji, under certain conditions if a state of emergency is declared, <b>the</b> <b>President</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> able to legally appoint an interim government. However, it is uncertain that the President chose of his free will to remove the Prime Minister, rather than simply appearing to accede {{to the demands of the}} military. In 2007, following the [...] military coup, six Australian and New Zealand judges resigned from the court. They were replaced by two Malaysian judges, [...] "with more appointments from Asia expected to follow soon". The legality of the actions of the military was subject to review by a High Court in 2008 and the Court of Appeals in 2009, the consensus of legal opinion was that the actions of the Fijian military constituted an illegal act. Given that one of the grievances of the military was the alleged leniency of the treatment of the perpetrators of the 2000 coup, the irony of the situation has provoked comment from a number of observers.|$|E

[...] Commenting on his personal experience of observing about 10 polling stations, he said [...] "my general point is that in principle what happened yesterday were normal elections and in technical sense they worked well." [...] He also said, [...] "And there's one specific aspect that is also problematic: the executive branch has made the election so that they almost chose this Parliament [...] And this is a problem. [...] Government forces have been blended with the party base.

This party political interference, and this is my own opinion, is the big problem. I will say the election was made in a Russian style — I can't say whether democratic or not — I can't analyze it in this aspect". Commenting a statement by the host that [...] "the president had a formal right to head the list of one of the parties" [...] he said [...] "I also think so. You didn't do it against your law.
