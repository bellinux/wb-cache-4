5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>Cuban</b> <b>government's</b> main tactic was {{to deploy}} {{thousands}} of troops against small groups of rebels, forming progressively constricting rings of encirclement.

They were to [...] "comb the brush, elbow to elbow" [...] until they had completely cleared the hills of anticommunist rebels.

People who qualified for the aid would receive 4.4lbs (2kg) of rice and peas if they lived in western Cuba and 6.6lbs (3kg) if they lived in eastern Cuba per month until July 1999. The United Nations World Food Program provided $20.5million in aid for both the effects of the drought and Georges. By December, <b>the</b> <b>Cuban</b> <b>Government</b> requested $90million to help recover from the hurricane and drought. By this time, about $40million had already been set aside for the same reason. The Cuban Red Cross supplied shelter for more than 92,000 residents and supplied them with hygiene kits, food, water, and other relief materials.|$|E
5|$|In late May, a {{tropical}} disturbance gradually {{developed over the}} northwestern portion of the Caribbean.

Reconnaissance Aircraft confirmed the existence of the tropical depression later that day. Early on June 3, it is estimated the depression intensified into Tropical Storm Alberto while located about 150miles (240km) north-northwest of the western tip of Cuba, based on a ship report of 45mph (75km/h) winds about 115miles (185km) south of its center.

5|$|Like {{many other}} Latin American intellectuals, Vargas Llosa was {{initially}} {{a supporter of}} the Cuban revolutionary government of Fidel Castro. He studied Marxism in depth as a university student and was later persuaded by communist ideals after the success of the Cuban Revolution. Gradually, Vargas Llosa came to believe that socialism was incompatible with what he considered to be general liberties and freedoms. The official rupture between the writer and the policies of <b>the</b> <b>Cuban</b> <b>government</b> occurred with the so-called 'Padilla Affair', when the Castro regime imprisoned the poet Heberto Padilla for a month in 1971. Vargas Llosa, along with other intellectuals of the time, wrote to Castro protesting the Cuban political system and its imprisonment of the artist. Vargas Llosa has identified himself with liberalism rather than extreme left-wing political ideologies ever since. Since he relinquished his earlier leftism, he has opposed both left- and right-wing authoritarian regimes.|$|E

5|$|Noriega began {{supplying}} {{weapons to}} the M-19 rebel group in Colombia in 1981.

A 1990 book discussing Noriega's administration stated that he had sold 5000 Panamanian passports to <b>the</b> <b>Cuban</b> <b>government</b> for use by its intelligence services. Noriega's direct involvement in moving weapons and drugs declined in the early 1980s; instead, he invested in legal businesses, and used these as a cover for money laundering operations, much of which were related to the drug trade. The U.S. intelligence service believed Noriega to have amassed a personal fortune in European banks {{as a result of his}} illegal activities, as well as owning two homes in Panama and one in France.|$|E
5|$|Strong wind gusts downed nearly 1,500power {{lines and}} knocked over 28 large high tension wire towers at {{a power plant}} in Mariel.
