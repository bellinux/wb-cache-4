25|$|Prior to playing, the timpanist must {{clear the}} heads by {{equalizing}} the tension at each tuning screw. This is done so every spot is tuned to {{exactly the same}} pitch. When the head is clear, the timpani will produce an in-tune sound. If the head is not clear, the pitch will rise or fall after the initial impact of a stroke, and the drum will produce different pitches at different dynamic levels. Timpanists are required to have a well-developed sense of relative pitch and must develop techniques <b>to</b> <b>tune</b> <b>in</b> an undetectable manner and accurately {{in the middle of}} a performance. Tuning is often tested with a light tap from a finger, which produces a near-silent note.|$|E
25|$|The Town of Ocean City has an {{emergency}} advisory radio system broadcast on two FM frequencies. WPSB-LP is broadcast at 99.5 FM from the Public Safety Radio Tower at 65th Street while WWOP-LP is broadcast at 100.3 FM from a tower near Ocean Pines. The system {{is meant to}} inform the public of emergency conditions such as severe weather and broadcasts 24-hour community information during non-emergency situations. The studios are located at the Ocean City Public Safety Building on 65th Street. Signs throughout Ocean City advise motorists of the station, with flashing lights advising them <b>to</b> <b>tune</b> <b>in</b> for emergency information. The emergency advisory radio system was launched on August 25, 2014 through a $55,000 grant through the Hazard Mitigation Grant Program from the Maryland Emergency Management Agency and sponsored by the Federal Emergency Management Agency.|$|E

25|$|In 2000, EMAP {{launched}} Kerrang! as {{a digital}} radio station, across the United Kingdom. This was principally a 'jukebox' station, playing a back-to-back sequence {{of rock and}} alternative music. On 10 June 2004, Kerrang! 105.2 was launched as a regional radio station in Birmingham with an advertising campaign by London-based creative agency ODD. The radio {{had a number of}} specialist programmes dedicated to the many subgenres of rock music. The radio output included interviews with those affecting popular culture and society as well as those involved with music. It stopped broadcasting on FM as of 14 June 2013 and once again became a digital station, with listeners able <b>to</b> <b>tune</b> <b>in</b> on DAB or the Kerrang! Radio app. With this broadcasting change came a move in Kerrang! Radio's offices from Birmingham to London. Absolute Radio is now broadcasting on its FM frequency.|$|E
25|$|Until {{the late}} 19th century, timpani were hand-tuned; that is, {{there was a}} {{sequence}} of screws with T-shaped handles, called taps, which altered {{the tension in the}} head when turned by players. Thus, tuning was a relatively slow operation, and composers had to allow a reasonable amount of time for players to change notes if they were called <b>to</b> <b>tune</b> <b>in</b> the middle of a work. The first 'machine' timpani, with a single tuning handle, was developed in 1812. The first pedal timpani originated in Dresden in the 1870s and are called Dresden timpani for this reason. However, since vellum was used for the heads of the drums, automated solutions were difficult to implement since the tension would vary unpredictably across the drum. This could be compensated for by hand-tuning, but not easily by a pedal drum. Mechanisms continued to improve in the early 20th century.|$|E
25|$|In the {{immediate}} post-war era the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) was inundated with requests {{to set up}} new television stations. Worrying about congestion of {{the limited number of}} channels available, the FCC put a moratorium on all new licenses in 1948 while considering the problem. A solution was immediately forthcoming; rapid development of radio receiver electronics during the war had opened a wide band of higher frequencies to practical use, and the FCC set aside a large section of these new UHF bands for television broadcast. At the time, black and white television broadcasting was still in its infancy in the U.S., and the FCC started to look at ways of using this newly available bandwidth for color broadcasts. Since no existing television would be able <b>to</b> <b>tune</b> <b>in</b> these stations, they were free to pick an incompatible system and allow the older VHF channels to die off over time.|$|E

500|$|During Thanksgiving week 1962, a five-part color episode called [...] "The Journey". {{was filmed}} in the High Sierra.

The voyagers face many perils before being rescued by the Royal Canadian Mounted Police. Richard Simmons, star of another Jack Wrather property, Sergeant Preston of the Yukon, made an appearance, while Lassie star Jon Provost performed whitewater stunts. Lassie sponsor Campbell's Soup objected to multi-part episodes, believing viewers would not want <b>to</b> <b>tune</b> <b>in</b> week after week {{to find out what happened}} from one segment to the next, but three of the five segments of [...] "The Journey" [...] hit the Nielsen top ten for the weeks in which they aired.

[...] Roshne B, writing for The New Indian Express, praised Susheela's vocal performance in [...] "Rajavin Paarvai", saying that listening to the song [...] "evokes a sense of nostalgia among music lovers, even today". Gopal Ethiraj, writing for the Asian Tribune, noted that [...] "Pudhiya Vaanam" [...] was one of several songs written by Vaali for Ramachadran that [...] "helped the latter galvanize masses". This view was also shared by B. Kolappan of The Hindu. Uma S.

Despite this, he felt that Dwight's subplot [...] "was successful in that it strayed true to the office dynamic", and that the actual viewing of the Glee episode was a [...] "highlight" [...] because it showcased the characters [...] "fall into some really fun (and familiar tropes." [...] Bonnie Stiernberg of Paste magazine awarded the episode an 8.4 out of 10, and called it [...] "a solid episode".

5000|$|Until the 1970s it was {{traditional}} to play {{a single}} tune {{for the duration of}} a contra dance (about 5 to 10 minutes). Since then, contra dance musicians have typically played <b>tunes</b> <b>in</b> sets of two or three related (and sometimes contrasting) tunes, though single-tune dances are again becoming popular with some northeastern bands. In the Celtic repertoires it is common to change keys with each tune. A set might start with a <b>tune</b> <b>in</b> G, switch <b>to</b> a <b>tune</b> <b>in</b> D, and end with a <b>tune</b> <b>in</b> Bm. Here, D is related to G as its dominant (5th), while D and Bm share a key signature of two sharps. In the old-time tradition the musicians will either play the same tune for the whole dance, or switch <b>to</b> <b>tunes</b> <b>in</b> the same key. This is because the tunings of the five-string banjo are key-specific. An old-time band might play a set of <b>tunes</b> <b>in</b> D, then use the time between dances to retune for a set of <b>tunes</b> <b>in</b> A. (Fiddlers also may take this opportunity to retune; tune- or key-specific fiddle tunings are uncommon in American Anglo-Celtic traditions other than old-time.) ...|$|R

Wright also praised Agyeman for [...] "effortlessly" [...] portraying Martha and her evil cloned counterpart. A fan of the Sontarans, Wright reacted positively to their return and redesign. Ben Rawson-Jones of Digital Spy rated the episode four stars out of five. Rawson-Jones felt the narrative was well plotted and paced, and felt Helen Raynor's writing had improved from [...] "Daleks in Manhattan". Rawson-Jones also praised the reintroductions of UNIT, Martha, Donna's family and the Sontarans, the interaction between Donna and Martha, and Christopher Ryan's portrayal of Staal, but felt Skorr's voice was [...] "distinctly lacklustre." [...] The episode's direction by Douglas Mackinnon also received criticism, particularly the scenes in the clone room.

Total Sci-Fi Online rated the episode 7/10, and expressed the wish that [...] "Safe" [...] {{could have been used}} as the series' pilot. [...] "The central premise has more pull, it draws together various plot strands going back to the pilot, meaningfully involves several seemingly incidental characters and events from the past, and zips along at a better pace. It’s a shame it took this long to reach this part of the puzzle, where a few of the pieces at last click satisfyingly into place". Erin Dougherty of Cinema Blend thought the episode [...] "was actually well thought out, well written, and not confusing at all. Plus, the characters seemed to be complete.
