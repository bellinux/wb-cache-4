5|$|Squads {{from the}} larger group broke off and moved up the hill toward coal pit number three. One squad took up a {{position}} at the pit number three coal shed; another, at the pump house. A warning party was sent ahead of the squads into Chinatown. They warned the Chinese they had one hour <b>to</b> <b>pack</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> leave town. After only 30 minutes, the first gunshots were fired by the squad at the pump house, followed by a volley from those at the coal shed. Lor Sun Kit, a Chinese laborer, was shot {{and fell to the}} ground. As the group at coal pit number three rejoined them, the crowd pressed on toward Chinatown, some men firing their weapons as they went. The smaller group of white miners at the plank bridge divided itself into squads and surrounded Chinatown. One squad stayed at the plank bridge to cut off any Chinese escape.|$|E
25|$|On 28 April 1975, North Vietnamese forces fought {{their way}} into the {{outskirts}} of the capital. Later that afternoon, as President Minh finished his acceptance speech, in which he called for an immediate cease-fire and peace talks, a formation of five A-37s, captured from the Republic of Vietnam Air Force, bombed Tân Sơn Nhứt. As Biên Hòa fell, General Nguyễn Văn Toàn, the III Corps commander, fled to Saigon, saying that most of the top ARVN leadership had virtually resigned themselves to defeat. The inauguration of Minh had served as a signal to South Vietnamese officers who would not compromise with the communists. They began <b>to</b> <b>pack</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> leave, or commit suicide to avoid capture.|$|E
25|$|Meanwhile, Daryl (Norman Reedus) {{has been}} forced to travel with the Claimers, led by Joe (Jeff Kober). Daryl gets into a {{confrontation}} with Len (Marcus Hester) over a claim on who shot, and thus owns, a rabbit, and Joe informs Daryl of the rules, then splits the rabbit's meat between then. That night, when they rest, Len sneaks his half of the rabbit into Daryl's bag, and feigns the next morning that Daryl took it. Joe, however, reports he saw Len frame Daryl, and drags him away to beat him up. Joe returns alone and instructs the others <b>to</b> <b>pack</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> move out. As they walk away, Daryl's sees Len's dead body, an arrow struck through his head. They come across the train tracks and discover the candy wrapped left behind by Rick.|$|E

25|$|In 1802 Napoleon {{built the}} Ourcq canal which brought 70,000 {{cubic meters of}} water a day to Paris, while the Seine river {{received}} up to 100,000 cubic meters of wastewater per day. The Paris cholera epidemic of 1832 sharpened the public awareness of the necessity for some sort of drainage system to deal with sewage and waste water in a better and healthier way. Between 1865 and 1920 Eugene Belgrand lead the development of a large scale system for water supply and waste water management. Between these years approximately 600 kilometres of aqueducts were built to bring in potable spring water, which freed the poor quality water to be used for flushing streets and sewers. By 1894 laws were passed which made drainage mandatory. The treatment of Paris sewage, though, was left to natural devices as 5,000 hectares of land were used to spread the waste out to be naturally purified. Further, the lack of sewage treatment left Parisian sewage pollution to become concentrated downstream in the town of Clichy, effectively forcing residents <b>to</b> <b>pack</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> move elsewhere.|$|E

Without women such as her, though, the mainland will be left with not only a weaker economy, but an even greater pool of frustrated leftover men." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{inauguration of}} Minh {{served as a}} signal to South Vietnamese {{officers}} who [...] "would make no compromise with the communists", and {{were responsible for the}} torture and imprisonment of many NLF agents and their sympathizers. They began <b>to</b> <b>pack</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> {{try to find a way}} out of the country. The aerial evacuation of U.S. personnel and civilians proceeded since 1 April from Tan Son Nhut. At 10:51 on 29 April Operation Frequent Wind, the U.S. helicopter evacuation of military and embassy personnel, U.S. civilians, and South Vietnamese citizens thought to be at risk of communist reprisal was put into implementation as the city descended into pandemonium.|$|E

Along the way, he accidentally bumps his head, making him lose his memory.

500|$|A {{civilian}} {{exodus from}} the city had begun well before the British fleet arrived in the harbor. The arrival the previous February of the first Continental Army troops in the city had prompted some people <b>to</b> <b>pack</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> leave, including Loyalists who were specifically targeted by the army and Patriots. [...] The capture of Long Island only accelerated the abandonment of the city. During the Continental Army's occupation of the city, many abandoned buildings were appropriated for the army's use. [...] When the British arrived in the city, the property of Patriots was confiscated for the British army's use. Despite this, housing and other demands of the military occupation significantly strained the city's available building stock.|$|E
2500|$|The next morning, Dwyer went to {{his press}} conference as planned. Appearing nervous and agitated, he again professed his innocence and began reading from a 21 page {{prepared}} text later described as a [...] "rambling polemic about the criminal justice system". It singled out former Governor Thornburgh, Acting U.S. Attorney West, agents in the FBI, Judge Muir, and others for tarnishing the justice system and ruining him. Dwyer spoke out {{against the death penalty}} and expressed regret for voting in favor of it {{while he was in the}} Pennsylvania assembly. This speech lasted nearly 30 minutes, and approximately halfway into it, with no apparent end in sight, some of the gathered press began <b>to</b> <b>pack</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> leave. Dwyer spotted this and interrupted himself to say, [...] "Those of you who are putting your cameras away, I think you ought to stay because we're not, we're not finished yet." ...|$|E
30|$|One of {{the mothers}} linked {{transport}} problems with isolation “I think transport problem is significant, {{it is hard to}} get out and about,—I suppose there is isolation”. (FG 1) This view was supported by four practitioners who spoke of the importance of having cars for “getting out to other people”. Public transport was seen as a possible barrier—“If it is just an effort if you have baby and a toddler <b>and</b> have <b>to</b> <b>pack</b> <b>up</b> a pram <b>and</b> wait an hour for a bus to go somewhere. Then you can only do limited shopping, you have to carry it home” (FG 1). Another practitioner felt that there was an expectation that people have cars. She had similar concerns regarding the effort <b>to</b> <b>pack</b> <b>up</b> “babies <b>and</b> kids” and take them out.|$|R

2500|$|Meanwhile, Hook {{comes to}} see Gold about the chaos {{going on around}} Storybrooke, and Gold says {{that as long as}} he has his heart, he is immune to the curse. As Gold prepares <b>to</b> <b>pack</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> leave town, he tells Hook to grab Henry and meet him and Belle at the town line, since he will not use his magic to bring Henry to him. When he reached New York City, Gold would make sure they would never {{remember}} any what happened in Storybrooke but explain that the town was destroyed. Hook heads to the Mayor’s office to see Henry and tells him to come with him. Henry, affected by the curse, calls Hook a dirty pirate and says he did not like him before and likes him less now that he’s with his mother, Emma, and asks him to leave. Hook uses the potion that Gold gave him to break the spell and he heads in, but Henry has spread marbles all around and Hook goes down, allowing Henry to flee for his safety. [...] Hook chases him but is confronted by Will, who initiates a fist-fight. Hook knocks out Will, but the delay allows Henry to escape.|$|E
2500|$|Brother Rabbit, Brother Bear, and Preacher Fox {{are forced}} <b>to</b> <b>pack</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> leave their Southern {{settings}} after the bank mortgages {{their home and}} sells it {{to a man who}} turns it into a brothel. The trio moves to Harlem, [...] "home to every black man". When they arrive, Rabbit, Bear, and Fox find that it is not all that it is made out to be. They encounter a con man named Simple Savior, a phony revolutionary leader who claims to be the cousin of [...] "Black Jesus", and that he gives his followers [...] "the strength to kill whites". In a flashy stage performance in his [...] "church", Savior acts out being brutalized by symbols of black oppression—represented by images of John Wayne, Elvis Presley, and Richard Nixon, before asking his parishioners for [...] "donations". Rabbit and his friends quickly realize Savior's [...] "revolution" [...] is merely a money making scam. Rabbit openly steals {{a large portion of the}} donation money, prompting Savior to try to have him killed. After Rabbit tricks his would-be murderers (in a paraphrasing of the story of Br'er Rabbit and the briar patch), he and Bear kill Savior. This allows Rabbit to take over Savior's racket, putting him in line to become the head of all organized crime in Harlem. Rabbit lays out his plan to keep all organized crime money in Harlem. But first, he has to get rid of a few other opponents. Savior's former partners tell Rabbit they will join him but only if he can kill his opponents, otherwise they will kill him instead.|$|E

Ivanova has finally come around to the idea, and is holding a stuffed bear in a baseball outfit. Sheridan examines it and initially laughs when seeing it is named Ba-bear-lon 5.
