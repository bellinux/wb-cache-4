5|$|From the {{distance}} of our times, Diefenbaker's role as a prairie populist who tried <b>to</b> <b>revolutionize</b> the Conservative Party begins to loom larger than his personal idiosyncrasies. The difficulties he faced {{in the form of}} significant historical dilemmas seem less easy to resolve than Liberals and hostile journalists opined at the time. If Diefenbaker defies rehabilitation, he can at least be appreciated. He stood for a fascinating and still relevant combination of individual and egalitarian values... But his contemporaries were also right in seeing some kind of disorder near the centre of his personality and his prime-ministership. The problems of leadership, authority, power, ego, and a mad time in history overwhelmed the prairie politician with the odd name.|$|E
5|$|Gaga grew up {{listening}} to artists such as the Beatles, Stevie Wonder, Queen, Bruce Springsteen, Pink Floyd, Mariah Carey, The Grateful Dead, Led Zeppelin, Whitney Houston, Elton John, Blondie, and Garbage, who have all influenced her music. Gaga's musical inspiration varies from dance-pop singers like Madonna and Michael Jackson to glam rock artists like David Bowie and Freddie Mercury, as well as the theatrics of the pop artist Andy Warhol and her own performance roots in musical theater. The singer has been compared to Madonna, who has said that she sees herself reflected in Gaga. Gaga says that she wants <b>to</b> <b>revolutionize</b> pop music like Madonna. Gaga has also cited heavy metal bands as an influence, including Iron Maiden and Black Sabbath. She credits Beyoncé as a key inspiration to pursue a musical career.|$|E

5|$|In September 1940, Rabi {{became a}} member of the Scientific Advisory Committee of the U.S. Army's Ballistic Research Laboratory. That month, the British Tizard Mission brought a number of new {{technologies}} to the United States, including a cavity magnetron, a high-powered device that generates microwaves using the interaction of a stream of electrons with a magnetic field. This device, which promised <b>to</b> <b>revolutionize</b> radar, demolished any thoughts the Americans had entertained about their technological leadership. Alfred Lee Loomis of the National Defense Research Committee decided to establish a new laboratory at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) to develop this radar technology. The name Radiation Laboratory was chosen as both unremarkable and a tribute to the Berkeley Radiation Laboratory. Loomis recruited Lee DuBridge to run it.|$|E
25|$|He tried <b>to</b> <b>revolutionize</b> the {{ranching}} {{industry by}} shipping refrigerated meat to Chicago by railroad, thus bypassing the Chicago stockyards. He built a meat-packing plant {{for this purpose}} in Medora, the town he founded in 1883 and named for his wife.|$|E
25|$|In the 1950s, a new {{standardized}} steel Intermodal {{container based}} on specifications from the United States Department of Defense began <b>to</b> <b>revolutionize</b> freight transportation.

25|$|Stähelin {{had used}} a similar screen to {{discover}} the nonmyelotoxic immunosuppressant ovalicin. Applying the revised screen led {{to the discovery of}} the potent biological activity of ciclosporin on January 31, 1972.

25|$|Harris led two {{professional}} lives: as {{the editor}} and journalist known as Joe Harris, he supported {{a vision of the}} New South with the editor Henry W. Grady (1880–1889), stressing regional and racial reconciliation after the Reconstruction era. As Joel Chandler Harris, fiction writer and folklorist, he wrote many 'Brer Rabbit' stories from the African-American oral tradition and helped <b>to</b> <b>revolutionize</b> literature in the process.|$|E
25|$|Piaget wanted <b>to</b> <b>revolutionize</b> the way {{research}} was conducted. Although he started researching with his colleagues using a traditional method of data collection, {{he was not}} fully satisfied with the results and wanted to keep trying {{to find new ways}} of researching using a combination of data, which included naturalistic observation, psychometrics, and the psychiatric clinical examination, {{in order to have a}} less guided form of research that would produce more empirically valid results.|$|E
25|$|Alongside the {{prominent}} poet George Topîrceanu, a poet of an equal importance was Tudor Arghezi {{who was the}} first <b>to</b> <b>revolutionize</b> the poetry in the last 50 years. One should not neglect the poems of George Bacovia a symbolist poet of neurosis and despair and those of Ion Barbu a brilliant mathematician who wrote a series of very successful cryptic poems. Tristan Tzara and Marcel Janco, founders of the Dadaist movement, were also of Romanian origin.|$|E

These pellets, diluted with water, will form all that is necessary to support life. The professor looks forward confidently <b>to</b> <b>revolutionizing</b> the present food system." ...|$|R
60|$|But {{now we must}} go back {{three centuries}} in our story to tell of a great teacher who came near <b>to</b> <b>revolutionizing</b> the {{religious}} thought and feeling of all Asia. This was Gautama Buddha, who taught his disciples at Benares in India {{about the same time}} that Isaiah was prophesying among the Jews in Babylon and Heraclitus was carrying on his speculative enquiries into the nature of things at Ephesus. All these men were in the world at the same time, in the sixth century B.C.--unaware of one another.|$|R
50|$|In {{addition}} <b>to</b> <b>revolutionizing</b> orthopaedic {{patient care}} through academic research, Saleh's medical device innovations {{have also made}} an impact {{in the field of}} arthroplasty. Working with orthopaedic colleagues, Saleh developed the VEGA knee which was debuted by Aesculap (a B. Braun Melsungen company)in 2012. In addition to its posterior-stabilized kinematics, the VEGA knee features a 7-layer AS coating to minimize wear and low-profile box to preserve more of the patient's native bone. The VEGA's variety of different implant sizes allow each patient to receive a customized fit, and its dual-purpose instruments and simple design decrease surgery time, thereby lowering the risk of infection.|$|R
25|$|In April 1997, Martha Palmer and Marc Light {{organized}} a workshop entitled Tagging with Lexical Semantics: Why, What, and How? {{in conjunction with}} the Conference on Applied Natural Language Processing. At the time, there was a clear recognition that manually annotated corpora had revolutionized other areas of NLP, such as part-of-speech tagging and parsing, and that corpus-driven approaches had the potential <b>to</b> <b>revolutionize</b> automatic semantic analysis as well. Kilgarriff recalled that there was “a high degree of consensus that the ﬁeld needed evaluation,” and several practical proposals by Resnik and Yarowsky kicked off a discussion that {{led to the creation of}} the Senseval evaluation exercises.|$|E
25|$|While all of {{this was}} happening, the open source and {{developer}} communities set to work <b>to</b> <b>revolutionize</b> what could be done with JavaScript. This community effort was sparked in 2005 when Jesse James Garrett released a white paper in which he coined the term Ajax, and described a set of technologies, of which JavaScript was the backbone, used to create web applications where data can be loaded in the background, avoiding the need for full page reloads and leading to more dynamic applications. This resulted in a renaissance period of JavaScript usage spearheaded by open source libraries and the communities that formed around them, with libraries such as Prototype, jQuery, Dojo Toolkit, MooTools, and others being released.|$|E
25|$|The Johns Hopkins University (commonly {{referred}} to as Johns Hopkins, JHU, or simply Hopkins) is an American private research university in Baltimore, Maryland. Founded in 1876, the university was named for its first benefactor, the American entrepreneur, abolitionist, and philanthropist Johns Hopkins. His $7 million bequest—of which half financed the establishment of Johns Hopkins Hospital—was the largest philanthropic gift {{in the history of}} the United States at that time. Daniel Coit Gilman, who was inaugurated as the institution's first president on February 22, 1876, led the university <b>to</b> <b>revolutionize</b> higher education in the U.S. by integrating teaching and research. Adopting the concept of a graduate school from Germany's ancient Heidelberg University, Johns Hopkins University is considered the first research university in the United States.|$|E

40|$|Emerging {{technologies}} can {{be described}} in a number of ways. These are technologies in the developmental stage of production, perhaps not yet fully exploited by firms. For many of these, basic research may still be taking place and the projections of potential applications remain just that – projected aspirations and hopes. When we look back to the histories of various technologies now embedded in society – from vaccines to computers, electricity to enhanced foods, we see historical trajectories that have led to numerous life and societal changes – from reduced mortality <b>to</b> <b>revolutionized</b> working conditions. These histories also remind us that once upon a time, these technologies may not always have been greeted with excitement and anticipation...|$|R
25|$|In their model, {{a country}} starts as a nondemocratic {{society in which}} a small rich group {{controls}} most of the wealth and rules the poor majority. As the ruling class, the rich receive taxation from the economy's output and they decide on the taxation rate as {{the only means of}} extraction. The poor majority can either take what is offered to them by the rich after they tax the output (the economy's output after tax divided by the population size), or they can choose <b>to</b> <b>revolutionize</b> against the ruling class, which comes with a certain cost. In a revolution, the poor's ultimate payoff is the benefit of the revolution minus the cost of the revolution. Under that circumstance, the payoff of the rich ruling class is split between, when the poor revolutionizes, the punishment for the ruling class and when the poor acquiesces, the taxation income.|$|E
25|$|Initially, {{vocational}} education in Singapore carried a negative stigma and was {{looked down upon}} as a dead-end option for underachieving students. In the 1960s, it was considered less than socially desirable educational option as {{vocational education}} was perceived that these schools were for low achieving students. Societal prejudice against less academically inclined students and vocational educational was regarded low quality and typically {{out of step with}} the changing needs of employers. The perception of technical and vocational education in Singapore are slowly changing as parents are starting to realize that there are alternative choices for decent employment outcomes as the greater Singaporean society values vocational and technical skills highly and sees them as crucial to the country’s economic development. Vocational education has been an important part of Singapore’s unique economic planning since 1992, where it began to transform and change the perception of vocational education and decided to transform and preposition it so that it was not seen as a place of last resort for underachieving pupils. Vocational schools such as the Institute of Technical Education were intended <b>to</b> <b>revolutionize</b> vocational education and portray the institution as a world-class example of the importance of vocational skills being translated to a 21st-century knowledge-based economy. Since 1995, enrollment in vocational schools has doubled, now making up 65% of the cohort who go on to post-secondary education (ages 16–18), with 25% accepted into the ITE and another 40% attending polytechnic universities.|$|E
