25|$|Again and again, {{revert to}} your old principles—seek peace and ensue it; leave America, {{if she has}} taxable matter in her, to tax herself. I am not here going into the distinctions of rights, nor {{attempting}} to mark their boundaries. I do not enter into these metaphysical distinctions; I hate the very sound of them. Leave the Americans as they anciently stood, and these distinctions, born of our unhappy contest, will die along with it... Be content to bind America by laws of trade; you have always done it... Do not burthen them with taxes... But if intemperately, unwisely, fatally, you sophisticate and poison the very source of government by urging subtle deductions, and consequences odious to <b>those</b> <b>you</b> govern, from the unlimited and illimitable nature of supreme sovereignty, you will teach them by these means to call that sovereignty itself in question... If that sovereignty and their freedom cannot be reconciled, which will they take? They will cast your sovereignty in your face. No body of men will be argued into slavery.|$|E
500|$|Fred Patton of Animation World Magazine {{described}} the anime as [...] "delightfully witty {{and even an}} educational window onto what Japanese high school life is really like." [...] Chris Beveridge of Anime on DVD, stated that [...] "There's a lot to laugh with here and a cast of characters that grow quickly on you as you start finding <b>those</b> <b>you</b> favor and <b>those</b> <b>you</b> don't." [...] Andrew Shelton from Anime Meta explains that [...] "The character of the girls is extremely well brought out. The superb observation, and ability to capture expression, makes the anime incredibly fun to watch in addition to meeting the story requirements. The action, and very rich comedy, are also wonderfully represented. There is just so much meaning, and charm, {{in even the most}} minor of expressions." [...] The reviewers of THEM Anime and Anime News Network felt that fans who had already graduated high school would feel nostalgic at times while watching Azumanga Daioh.|$|E

[...] "While [...] "Civil War II" [...] may have initiated this rift, we've {{known for some}} time that Kamala would eventually need to separate herself from her idols. Her journey centers around self-discovery and identity, and a part of that exploration includes separating yourself from <b>those</b> <b>you</b> put on pedestals. The rift between Carol and Kamala doesn't really have to do with right and wrong. It has to do with growing up and realizing that you perceive the world differently from even the ones you love," [...] Amanat elaborated.|$|E

Modern {{technology}} but in an old style. We heard it {{and we were just}} like, ‘That’s a freakin' franchise! You could make three of those!'" [...] Dante Harper was hired to rewrite the script, aimed for [...] "having a gory-but-funny Shaun of the Dead vibe." [...] McKay said inspirations included Sam Raimi's early horror comedy films like Army of Darkness but also [...] "John Carpenter's movies, which we all love [...] we're all hugely influenced by the first Matrix—obviously a really big one—also the Bourne Supremacy movies and the way Oliver Wood shot <b>those.</b> <b>You</b> kind of throw in all those, mix 'em up in a pot and that's what you get." [...] Wirkola also credited Quentin Tarantino for influencing him [...] "in many ways" [...] and singled out Peter Jackson's Braindead for having been [...] "a game-changer" [...] for him.|$|E
500|$|Either/Or portrays two life views. Each life view {{is written}} and {{represented}} by a fictional pseudonymous author, with the prose of the work reflecting and depending on the life view being discussed. For example, the aesthetic life view is written in short essay form, with poetic imagery and allusions, discussing aesthetic topics such as music, seduction, drama, and beauty. The ethical life view is written as two long letters, with a more argumentative and restrained prose, discussing moral responsibility, critical reflection, and marriage. The views of the book are not neatly summarized, but are expressed as lived experiences embodied by the pseudonymous authors. The book's central concern is the primal question asked by Aristotle, [...] "How should we live?" [...] His book was certainly informed by Epictetus; [...] "Consider first, man, what the matter is, and what your own nature is able to bear. If you would be a wrestler, consider your shoulders, your back, your thighs; for different persons are made for different things. Do {{you think that you}} can act as you do and be a philosopher, that you can eat, drink, be angry, be discontented, as you are now? You must watch, you must labor, you must get the better of certain appetites, must quit your acquaintances, be despised by your servant, be laughed at by <b>those</b> <b>you</b> meet; come off worse than others in everything—in offices, in honors, before tribunals. When you have fully considered all these things, approach, if you please—that is, if, by parting with them, you have a mind to purchase serenity, freedom, and tranquillity. If not, do not come hither; do not, like children, be now a philosopher, then a publican, then an orator, and then one of Caesar’s officers. These things are not consistent. You must be one man, either good or bad. You must cultivate either your own reason or else externals; apply yourself either to things within or without you—that is, be either a philosopher or one of the mob." [...] His motto comes from Plutarch, [...] "The deceived is wiser than one not deceived." ...|$|E

[...] None worked for pay, and all depended on God to supply their material needs. To live at Shiloh meant to [...] "be {{in a constant state}} of readiness for the 'Holy Spirit's latest,' as Sandford put it. This meant no settling into ruts of any kind. [...] It meant being ready to do any job, especially <b>those</b> <b>you</b> were least adept at....It meant being open to last-minute changes in schedule." [...] There was a typical schedule: one or two hours of private devotions in the morning, breakfast and kitchen chores, prayer at 9 AM, classes until noon, lunch before personal household or office duties. [...] But the schedule might be interrupted at any moment by some special request for prayer. [...] "God's work could not be crammed into a human schedule, and fussy ideas about order were not appropriate." ...|$|E
2500|$|Haarmann was insistent {{that none}} of the skulls found in the Leine River had belonged to his victims, and that the {{forensic}} identification of the skull of Robert Witzel was mistaken, as he had almost invariably smashed his victims' skulls to pieces. The exceptions being those of his earliest victims—killed several years prior to his arrest—and that of his last victim, Erich de Vries. Although insistent {{that none of}} his murders had been premeditated, investigators discovered much circumstantial evidence suggesting that several murders had been planned hours or days in advance, and that Haarmann had both concocted explanations for his victims' disappearances and dissuaded acquaintances of his victims from filing missing persons' reports with Hanover police. Investigators also noted that Haarmann would only confess to murders for which there existed evidence against him; on one occasion, Haarmann had stated: [...] "There are some [...] you don't know about, but it's not <b>those</b> <b>you</b> think." ...|$|E
