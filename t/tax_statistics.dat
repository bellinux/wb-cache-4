In 1846, a provision was passed by the legislature to allow a [...] "local option" [...] to whether grant or deny these licenses. This meant the citizens of the towns could vote on whether to allow or disallow these establishments. In 1850, town selectmen became authorized to approve business license to sell small beer or cider, but not strong beer. In 1852, several more laws were passed which started Vermont's prohibition era. In 1853, the legislature passed the Vermont Prevention of Traffic in Intoxicating Liquors for the Purpose of Drinking law.|$|E

40|$|With {{the data}} of the de facto {{anonymised}} Income <b>Tax</b> <b>Statistics</b> 1998 (FAST 98), the German official statistics are {{for the first time}} publishing microdata from the field of fiscal statistics. The scientific community can use these data to analyse politically-relevant questions on the fiscal and transfer system at their own workplace, subject to the premises of article 16 subsection 6 of the Law on Statistics for Federal Purposes, on the basis of "real" assessment data. Passing on individual data to the scientific community is only possible in a de facto anonymised form. This form may impair possibilities for scientific analysis possibilities. So that anonymised data can nevertheless be used by the scientific community, anonymisation must meet two equal challenges: It must firstly guarantee adequate protection of the individual items of data, and secondly it must optimally conserve the possibilities for analysis of the anonymised data. In order to achieve the right balance between these two goals, the Statistical Offices have involved potential scientific users in the anonymisation work in a research project. In the article entitled "De facto anonymised microdata file on income <b>tax</b> <b>statistics</b> 1998 ", in addition to the anonymisation concept the framework conditions of the project are explained and the analysis possibilities of income <b>tax</b> <b>statistics</b> demonstrated. ...|$|E

40|$|A large {{literature}} has documented top income share series based on income <b>tax</b> <b>statistics</b> using the common methodology established by Piketty (2001, 2003). The disappearance of capital {{income from the}} income tax base in many countries poses a major challenge to the comparability of these series both over time and between countries. First, we extend the existing German series including capital gains to 2010, and the series excluding capital gains to 2008. Second, we derive three homogeneous series by simulating legislative definitions of capital income prevailing in Germany between 2001 and 2010. For both simulation and the exclusion of capital gains, we employ a rich data set containing the tax files of all income taxpayers. Third, we construct a composite measure of stock dividends and interest income tax flows {{as a proxy for}} capital income missing in the data since 2009. We find that the drop in top income shares obtained from income <b>tax</b> <b>statistics</b> in the crisis year 2009 is largely attributable to the exclusion of capital income from the income tax base.

40|$|The {{literature}} indicates {{there is}} a shortage of professors of accounting. For some researchers this lack is related to the high price paid to obtain an advanced degree in this area. According to the American Accounting Association (AAA), graduate programs need to be more attractive, less stressful and less expensive for students. Therefore, the objective of this study is to map the characteristics of the selection process, the courses offered and the requirements to obtain a master’s degree in accounting from universities located in English-speaking. This study can be classified as descriptive, with a theoretical-conceptual nature and a qualitative approach. We rely on secondary sources and apply inductive logic. The main results are that in the United States, 71 % of the programs require candidates to have knowledge of accounting, finance, economics, <b>taxes,</b> <b>statistics</b> and mathematics; 75 % of Australian universities require a minimum score on the TOEFL for foreign students, 20 % have a minimum GPA and 10 % require taking the GMAT; and no Canadian university requires a letter of recommendation. Regarding the purpose of the courses, 88 % of the institutions that offer master programs in accounting focus on improved professional qualification of accountants. In Australia, 30 % of the programs last 18 months, while in Canada this figure is 66 % and in New Zealand, 50 % of the programs last at least two years. With respect to the graduation requirements, 82 % of the universities require between 4 and 9 mandatory disciplines. In conclusion, the master programs in the United States and United Kingdom are relatively more demanding with respect to the degree requirements than in the other countries investigated...|$|R
40|$|Altinn is a Norwegian portal {{for public}} {{reporting}} over the internet. The application {{can be seen}} as the “flagship” for how the use of IT is supposed to ease reporting to the government for businesses, organizations, and regular citizens in Norway. The Altinn platform is considered an important step on the way to around-the-clock governance and is the result of cooperation between the Norwegian Directorate for <b>Taxes,</b> <b>Statistics</b> Norway and The Brønnøysund Register Centre amongst others. As a flagship Altinn has been a visible target and the system has endured a lot of criticism – especially for a frustrating use experience and the lack of ease of use. This thesis is an attempt at analyzing problems in the user experience and finding improvements for these problems. This is done from several angles; I look for improvements in findability, usability and accessibility. I have conducted a heuristic evaluation and conducted a WAI preliminary review of the user interface. The heuristic evaluation revealed a range of points to improve. The thesis presents possible solutions for better finding and administration of forms; use of attachments; improvements in the help-system, error handling; and saving of forms. In addition there have been suggested improvements in the information architecture of the forms. After analysis of the Altinn-system it is clear that the application does not comply with guidelines for web accessibility. Even basic guidelines are not met, and the system does therefore not pass the WCAG-test to receive even an “A”-rating. When the system fails at this level it means that many people will not be able to use Altinn. People with disabilities, such as blindness, will for example not be able to use the application. The thesis presents a comprehensive list of errors and possible solutions to the problems so that Altinn may comply with WCAG guidelines...|$|R
