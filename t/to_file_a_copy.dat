Congress enacted legislation requiring that the Secretaries of the Navy, Interior, and War should put every contract made by them, or by officers appointed it, in writing and should have them signed with the names of the contractors, and also <b>to</b> <b>file</b> <b>a</b> <b>copy</b> in a [...] "Returns Office" [...] of Department of the Interior within 30 days. The officers making such contracts were to swear to them, and penalties were prescribed for violations of the law. The quartermaster-general of the Army convinced Congress that the law could not be then enforced, so congress enacted legislation on July 17 delaying its enforcement until the beginning of 1863.|$|E

50|$|In Haeger v. Goodyear Tire & Rubber Co., 793 F.3d 1122 (9th Cir. 2015), Smith, {{writing for}} a divided panel, {{held that the}} {{district}} court did not abuse its discretion in using its inherent authority to sanction defendant and its counsel for concealing information in a product liability suit by awarding fees and costs and requiring the manufacturer <b>to</b> <b>file</b> <b>a</b> <b>copy</b> of the sanctions order in any related case. Smith held that a court’s inherent investigatory power concerning fraud on the court is not limited by overlapping statutes or rules, and while the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure provide one avenue to sanction a party for discovery non-compliance, {{it is not the}} exclusive avenue. Defendant had failed to disclose multiple responsive product tests, instead representing that they did not exist, and settled with plaintiff while withholding the tests. Judge Watford, dissenting, would have held that the sanctions awarded exceeded what was demonstrably necessary to compensate the plaintiff for the discovery non-compliance under Miller v. City of Los Angeles, 661 F.3d 1024 (9th Cir. 2011). Rehearing en banc was denied, 813 F.3d 1233, and petitions for certiorari have been filed.|$|E

40|$|We {{consider}} {{the production of}} a pair of like-sign charged Higgs bosons in $e^-e^-$ collisions at the NLC within the context of several electroweak models with extended symmetry breaking sectors. We find that the rate for this process, which proceeds through $W^-W^-$ fusion, is a very sensitive probe of the nature of these extended Higgs sectors and that the corresponding cross sections can vary by as much as several orders of magnitude at NLC energies.

40|$|The {{rates and}} {{corresponding}} jet distributions for the decay Z→ bb̅g {{and the process}} e^+e^-→ tt̅g may be sensitive to anomalous dipole-like couplings of heavy quarks to the photon and Z. In the b-quark case, after updating our previous analysis on the constraints imposed by current experiments on Zbb̅ anomalous couplings, we show that the variation of these couplings within their presently allowed ranges leads to rather minor modifications to the Standard Model expectations for Z→ bb̅g observables. In the t-quark case, significant deviations from the Standard Model predictions for tt̅g production at the Next Linear Collider are possible.

40|$|We {{calculate}} the electromagnetic and axial nuclear {{moments of the}} deuteron and triton {{as a function of}} their radius using a relativistic two-nucleon and three-nucleon model formulated on the light-cone. The results also provide an estimate of the nuclear binding corrections to helicity-dependent deep inelastic scattering sum rules. At large nucleon radius, the moments are given by the usual non-relativistic formulae modified by finite binding effects. At small radius, the moments take the canonical values given by the generalization of the Drell-Hearn-Gerasimov sum rule. In addition, as R [...] > 0, the constituent helicities become completely disoriented, and the Gamow-Teller matrix element vanishes. Thus, in the pointlike limit MR [...] > 0, the moments of a spin-one bound states coincide with the canonical couplings of elementary spin-one bosons of the Standard Model, mu=e/M, Q=-e/M^ 2, and g_A= 0.
