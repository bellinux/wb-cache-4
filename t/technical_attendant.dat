40|$|Accident and {{incident}} {{reports have}} indicated that flight attendants have numerous opportunities to provide the flight-deck crew with operational information that may prevent or essen the severity of a potential problem. Additionally, as carrier fleets transition from three person to two person flight-deck crews, the reliance upon the cabin crew for the transfer of this information may increase further. Recent research (Chute & Wiener, 1996) indicates that light attendants do not feel confident {{in their ability to}} describe mechanical parts or malfunctions of the aircraft, and the lack of flight <b>attendant</b> <b>technical</b> training has been referenced in a number of recent reports (National Transportation Safety Board, 1992; Transportation Safety Board of Canada, 1995; Chute & Wiener, 1996). The present study explored both flight <b>attendant</b> <b>technical</b> knowledge and flight attendant and dot expectations of flight <b>attendant</b> <b>technical</b> knowledge. To assess the technical knowledge if cabin crewmembers, 177 current flight attendants from two U. S. carriers voluntarily :ompleted a 13 -item technical quiz. To investigate expectations of flight <b>attendant</b> <b>technical</b> knowledge, 181 pilots and a second sample of 96 flight attendants, from the same two airlines, completed surveys designed to capture each group's expectations of operational knowledge required of flight attendants. Analyses revealed several discrepancies between the present level of flight attendants...|$|R

In addition, we describe the <b>attendant</b> <b>technical</b> infrastructure. The knowledge-enhanced authoring tool allows cultural experts to specify intertextual relationships between works of art which may be represented in different media such as text, audio, image, or moving pictures. The result of the authoring process is a multimedia document with ontological markup. “Intertextual cultural threads ” are thus, encoded in multimedia documents that can be viewed in browser environments supporting “EMMOs ” (Enhanced Multimedia Meta Objects) ...|$|R
40|$|High Peak to Average Power Ratio (PAPR) of the {{transmitted}} {{signal is}} a critical problem in multicarrier modulation systems (MCM) such as Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM), and Multi-Carrier Code Division Multiple Access (MC CDMA) systems, due to large number of subcarriers. High PAPR leads to reduced resolution, and battery life. It also deteriorates system performance. This paper focuses on review of different PAPR reduction techniques with <b>attendant</b> <b>technical</b> issues as well as criteria for selection of PAPR reduction technique. To reduce PAPR the constraints are low power consumption, and low Bit Error Rate (BER). Spectral bandwidth is improved by better spectral characteristics, and low complexity/cost.

5000|$|One of her {{pedagogical}} {{devices to}} achieve this was to practice works in different keys, or cross-handed, even simultaneously cross-handed in different keys. Then, upon returning to the correct key, hand positions, and tempo, many of the previous problems in technique had been overcome. Another important device—used especially in the correct tempo of the piece, no matter how fast—is what she calls [...] "outlining": skipping notes provided that the basic rhythm and body dynamics of motion were maintained. (Her term [...] "basic rhythm" [...] is explored below.) The pianist uses these techniques to establish the musical content as firmly in the mind as possible, replacing note-to-note <b>technical</b> concentration—and the <b>attendant</b> note-to-note musical attention—with accomplishment of the larger musical phrase.|$|R
40|$|Purpose. Development of new charts of capacitance-resistance {{defense of}} {{high-voltage}} capacitors of powerful capacity stores of energy (CSE) from emergency large impulsive currents (LIC) at the electric hasp {{of one of}} condensers of such CSE {{on the stage of}} their charge or discharge. Methodology. Electrophysics bases of the technique of high-voltage and large pulsed currents, and also scientific and technical bases of planning of devices of high-voltage impulse technique. Results. Two new charts of capacitance-resistance defense of high-voltage impulsive capacitors are offered for powerful CSE of one- and multimodule execution from emergency LIC, being based on the use of high-voltage permanent graphite-ceramic resistors of type of TVO- 60 a face value from 24 to 100 Ohm, set on the high-voltage conclusions of all of condensers of CSE. One of the developed capacitance-resistance charts of defense of condensers for powerful one-module CSE passed practical approbation. Originality. It is shown that application of the developed charts of capacitance-resistance defense of high-voltage condensers of powerful CSE is provided by frequent limitation of amplitude of emergency LIC, flowing through broken through an electric discharge condenser of CSE on the stage of his charge or discharge. Such limitation emergency LIC is prevented by explosion destruction of the damaged condenser of high-voltage CSE. Practical value. The use of the developed charts of capacitance-resistance defense of high-voltage capacitors from emergency LIC allows substantially to promote functional safety of powerful CSE of one- and multi-module execution and provide the safe terms of labour for a scientific and <b>technical</b> personnel, <b>attendant</b> similar CSE...|$|R
5000|$|The 1916 anti-Russian rioting in Turkistan {{led to the}} Basmachi {{movement}} {{which received}} some support from the Afghan government. The Basachi rebels used parts of Afghanistan as a safe haven but following the Bolshevik Revolution of 1917 Lenin and other communist party leaders made efforts to gain support from minorities including the considerable Muslim population of their country. In the wake of World War I, the Bolsheviks were occupied with the Russian Civil War and other domestic issues so the perceved threat of Russia was lessened {{compared to that of}} British Imperialism. In 1919, the British invaded for a third time during the Third Anglo-Afghan war and Soviet Russia indirectly supported Afghanistan by becoming the first country to establish diplomatic relations with Afghanistan in 1919 and by recognizing its borders. A British attempt to assassinate the Afghan premier, Amanullah Khan, in June 1920 led to Afghanistan quickly signing a draft of an Afghan-Soviet nonaggression pact which was formalized in 1921. The treaty provided for Afghan transit rights through the Soviet Union and formed the basis of friendly relations during the 1920s. Early Soviet assistance included financial aid, aircraft and <b>attendant</b> <b>technical</b> personnel, and telegraph operators. During Amanullah Khan's visit to Moscow in 1928 he was greeted as a close friend of the still diplomatically isolated Soviet Union.|$|R

40|$|High-frequency {{continuous}} {{measurements of}} the partial pressure of CO 2 (p CO 2) are crucial for constraining the spatiotemporal dynamics of CO 2 emissions from inland water systems. However, direct measurements of p CO 2 are scarce, and no systematic comparisons have been conducted on the suitability of the widely used measurement systems for continuous underway or long-term deployment in various field conditions. We compared spray- and marble-type equilibrators and a membrane-enclosed CO 2 sensor to assess their suitability for continuous long-term or underway p CO 2 measurements in an urbanized river system in Korea. Both equilibrators had a shorter response time compared with the membrane-enclosed sensor, and could capture large spatial variations of p CO 2 during a transect study along a highly urbanized river reach. The membrane-enclosed sensor based on passive equilibration provided comparable underway measurements along the river sections where p CO 2 varied within the sensor detection range. When deployed in a eutrophic river site, the membrane-enclosed sensor was able to detect large diel variations in p CO 2. However, biofouling on the membrane could reduce {{the accuracy of the}} measurement during long deployments exceeding several days. The overall results suggest that the fast response of the equilibrator systems facilitates capturing large spatial variations in p CO 2 during short underway measurements. However, the <b>attendant</b> <b>technical</b> challenges of these systems, such as clogging and desiccant maintenance, have to be addressed carefully to enable their long-term deployment. The membrane-enclosed sensor would be suitable as an alternative tool for long-term continuous measurements if membrane biofouling could be overcome by appropriate antifouling measures such as copper mesh coverings...|$|R
