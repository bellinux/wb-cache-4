50|$|Research {{has shown}} that the <b>tongue-tie</b> does not {{restrict}} the animal's breathing. However, research has also shown that the <b>tongue-tie</b> does not provide a respiratory benefit in healthy animals (as some trainers believe it prevents the horse's tongue from coming up, and therefore allows for free air intake). Other studies have shown that it does help prevent dorsal displacement of the soft palate, but success rate is low.|$|E
5000|$|Successful {{treatments}} {{have shown}} that causes are functional rather than physical: that is, most lisps are caused by errors in tongue placement within the mouth rather than caused by any injury or congenital deformity to the mouth. The most frequently discussed of these problems is tongue thrust in which the tongue protrudes beyond the front teeth. This protrusion affects speech as well as swallowing {{and can lead to}} lisping. Ankyloglossia or <b>tongue-tie</b> can also be responsible for lisps in children. However it is unclear whether these deficiencies are caused by the <b>tongue-tie</b> itself or the muscle weakness following the correction of the <b>tongue-tie.</b> [...] Overbites and underbites may also contribute to non-lingual lisping. Temporary lisps can be caused by dental work, dental appliances such as dentures or retainers or by swollen or bruised tongues.|$|E

50|$|Sometimes, a baby's {{tongue is}} {{stuck to the}} bottom of the mouth by a band of tissue, which means the baby can't open his or her mouth wide enough to get a good latch.

If the baby isn't latching on well and doesn't seem to be gaining weight mothers are advised to contact the pediatrician or nurse to ask about this. Fortunately, it's a very simple fix.

50|$|Wallace and Clark {{also studied}} {{breastfeeding}} difficulties in infants with ankyloglossia. They followed 10 infants with ankyloglossia who underwent surgical tongue tie division. Eight {{of the ten}} mothers experienced poor infant latching onto the breast, 6/10 experienced sore nipples and 5/10 experienced continual feeding cycles; 3/10 mothers were exclusively breastfeeding. Following a <b>tongue-tie</b> division, 4/10 mothers noted immediate improvements in breastfeeding, 3/10 mothers did not notice any improvements and 6/10 mothers continued breastfeeding {{for at least four}} months after the surgery. The study concluded that <b>tongue-tie</b> division may be a possible benefit for infants experiencing breastfeeding difficulties due to ankyloglossia and further investigation is warranted. The limitations of this study include the small sample size and {{the fact that there was}} not a control group. In addition, the conclusions were based on subjective parent report as opposed to objective measures.|$|E
50|$|Ankyloglossia, {{also known}} as <b>tongue-tie,</b> is a {{congenital}} oral anomaly that may decrease mobility of the tongue tip and is caused by an unusually short, thick lingual frenulum, a membrane connecting {{the underside of the}} tongue {{to the floor of the}} mouth.

50|$|Messner and Lalakea studied {{speech in}} {{children}} with ankyloglossia. They noted that the phonemes likely to be affected due to ankyloglossia include sibilants and lingual sounds such as 'r'. In addition, the authors also state that it is uncertain as to which patients will have a speech disorder that {{can be linked to}} ankyloglossia and {{that there is no way}} to predict at a young age which patients will need treatment. The authors studied 30 children from one to 12 years of age with ankyloglossia, all of whom underwent frenuloplasty. Fifteen children underwent speech evaluation before and after surgery. Eleven patients were found to have abnormal articulation before surgery and nine of these patients were found to have improved articulation after surgery. Based on the findings, the authors concluded that it is possible for children with ankyloglossia to have normal speech in spite of decreased tongue mobility. However, according to their study, a large percentage of children with ankyloglossia will have articulation deficits that can be linked to <b>tongue-tie</b> and these deficits may be improved with surgery. The authors also note that ankyloglossia does not cause a delay in speech or language, but at the most, problems with enunciation. Limitations of the study include a small sample size as well as a lack of blinding of the speech-language pathologists who evaluated the subjectsâ speech.|$|E
40|$|Context: <b>Tongue-tie</b> (more {{formally}} {{known as}} ankyloglossia) is a congenital anomaly {{characterized by an}} abnormally short lingual frenulum, which may restrict mobility of the tongue tip impairing its ability to fulfill its functions. The clinical significance of ankyloglossia is varied; rarely symptomatic {{to a host of}} problems including infant feeding difficulties, speech disorders, malocclusions, and others. Aims: The need {{of this study was to}} evaluate the occurrence and severity of <b>tongue-tie</b> and its association with the type of malocclusions in two populations and also to correlate the various malocclusion traits with the grades of <b>tongue-tie.</b> Subjects and Methods: A total of 700 school children in the age group of 9 - 17 years were examined for the presence of <b>tongue-tie,</b> 350 from regular schools and 350 from special schools. The presence was evaluated, measured, and graded into Grades I-V according to Kotlowâ²s method. The malocclusion was assessed according to Angleâ²s classification. Severity of crowding was assessed by Littleâ²s irregularity index in each case. Various other malocclusion traits were visually assessed, in relation to the positions of the teeth. Statistical Analysis Used: Spearmanâ²s rank correlation method was used to test the relationship between type of malocclusions, grades of <b>tongue-tie</b> and severity of crowding. Significance was considered at the (P < 0. 05) level. Results: Statistically significant differences were seen between grades of <b>tongue-tie</b> and Angleâ²s types of malocclusion and Spearmanâ²s correlation between them showed negative correlation. The Spearmanâ²s correlation showed a negative correlation between <b>tongue-tie</b> grades and severity of crowding. Conclusions: As the grade of <b>tongue-tie</b> increased, its association with Classes I and II malocclusion decreased. The lower grades of <b>tongue-tie</b> are associated with increased lower incisor crowding. Shorter, tight frenulums are more associated with maxillary constriction, anterior open bite, and spacing of the lower anteriors...|$|E
40|$|Ankyloglossia (or <b>tongue-tie)</b> is a {{relatively}} uncommon congenital anomaly defined by an abnormally short lingual frenulum. Associations between <b>tongue-tie</b> and breastfeeding problems in infants have been inconsistent, and are a longstanding source of controversy in the medical community. Definitions of ankyloglossia vary, and management suggestions are not based on randomized controlled trials. Surgical correction involves cutting the lingual frenulum (frenotomy). Based on current available evidence, frenotomy cannot be recommended. If, however, the association between significant <b>tongue-tie</b> and major breastfeeding problems is clearly identified and surgical intervention is deemed necessary, frenotomy should be performed by a clinician experienced with the procedure and with appropriate analgesia. More definitive recommendations regarding the management of <b>tongue-tie</b> in infants await appropriately designed trials...|$|E
40|$|Background: <b>Tongue-tie</b> is {{a common}} {{condition}} that often adversely affects breastfeeding. There is research that suggests that frenulotomy can improve breastfeeding {{but there is also}} evidence of lack of professional knowledge on <b>tongue-tie.</b> Methods: This was a qualitative interview study with GPs, midwives, health visitors and nine mothers to explore facilitators and barriers to receiving a diagnosis of and treatment for <b>tongue-tie.</b> Findings: Mothers told a common story of having to push for support, experiencing diagnostic and treatment delays and suffering ongoing distress, which threatened their ability to establish breastfeeding. Mothers also described feeling vulnerable in the neonatal period, and witnessing a variation in professional knowledge about <b>tongue-tie.</b> Conclusions: Variable professional knowledge, conflicting advice, and a delayed diagnosis can lead to a difficult patient pathway. Assessment for <b>tongue-tie</b> should be considered when approaching infants with feeding difficulties. Frenulotomy should also be considered and services made available where findings suggest the cause is structural and breastfeeding support has not helped...|$|E
40|$|Background: <b>Tongue-tie</b> is {{a common}} but often {{neglected}} condition. The indications and the techniques for its division are still controversial.

For small infants, a parent sits opposite the doctor, with their knees in contact, the infant lies supine with his/her head towards the doctor. The tongue is lifted superiorly with the doctor's middle fi nger or middle and index fi ngers. The doctor uses the other hand to divide the <b>tongue-tie</b> {{with a pair of}} blunt-tipped scissors. In a cooperative child with teeth and relatively thin membrane, a sitting position is used.

40|$|Objective: The {{purposes}} of this study were: (1) to determine whether breast-fed infants with <b>tongue-tie</b> have decreased rates of breast-feeding at 1 week and 1 month of age, (2) to determine the prevalence of <b>tongue-tie,</b> and (3) to test the usefulness of the Assessment Tool for Lingual Frenulum Function (ATLFF) in assessing the severity of <b>tongue-tie</b> in breast-feeding newborns. Methods: A case-control design was used. All infants in the Regions Hospital newborn nursery were examined for <b>tongue-tie.</b> Tongue-tied babies were examined using the ATLFF. Two breast-feeding babies with normal tongues were identified and matched for each case. Mothers were interviewed when the babies were 1 week and 1 month old. Results: The prevalence of <b>tongue-tie</b> was 4. 2 %. Forty-nine tongue-tied and 98 control infants were enrolled. Tongue-tied babies were 3 times as likely as control babies to be bottle fed only at 1 week [risk ratio (RR), 3. 11; 95 % confidence interval (CI), 1. 21, 8. 03) By 1 month, tongue-tied babies were as likely as controls to be bottle fed only. (RR, 1. 00; 95 % CI, 0. 55, 1. 82) Twelve of the tongue-tied infants had ATLFF scores of âPerfect, â none had scores of âAcceptable, â and 6 had scores of âFunction Im-paired. â The remaining 31 infants had scores that fell into none of these categories.

40|$|Aims Currently {{there is}} debate {{on how best}} to manage young infants with <b>tongue-tie</b> who have {{breastfeeding}} problems. One of the challenges is the subjectivity of the outcome variables used to assess efficacy of <b>tongue-tie</b> division. This structured review documents how the argument has evolved. It proposes how best to assess, inform and manage mothers and their babies who present with <b>tongueâtie</b> related breastfeeding problems. Methods Databases were searched for relevant papers including Pubmed, Medline, and the Cochrane Library. Professionals in the field were personally contacted regarding the provision of additional data. Inclusion criteria were: infants less than 3 months old with <b>tongue-tie</b> and/or feeding problems. The exclusion criteria were infants with oral anomalies and neuromuscular disorders. Results There is wide variation in prevalence rates reported in different series, from 0. 02 to 10. 7 %. The most comprehensive clinical assessment is the Hazelbaker Assessment Tool for lingual frenulum function. The most recently published systematic review of the effect of <b>tongue-tie</b> release on breastfeeding concludes that there were a limited number of studies with quality evidence. There have been 316 infants enrolled in frenotomy RCTs across five studies. No major complications from surgical division were reported. The complications of frenotomy may be minimised with a check list before embarking on the procedure. Conclusions Good assessment and selection are important because 50 % of breastfeeding babies with ankyloglossia will not encounter any problems. We recommend 2 to 3 weeks as reasonable timing for intervention. Frenotomy appears to improve breastfeeding in infants with <b>tongue-tie,</b> but the placebo effect is difficult to quantify. Complications are rare, but it is important that it is carried out by a trained professional...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background About 3 % {{of infants}} {{are born with}} a <b>tongue-tie</b> which may lead to {{breastfeeding}} problems such as ineffective latch, painful attachment or poor weight gain. The Hazelbaker Assessment Tool for Lingual Frenulum Function (HATLFF) has been developed to give a quantitative assessment of the <b>tongue-tie</b> and recommendation about frenotomy (release of the frenulum). The {{aim of this study}} was to assess the inter-rater reliability of the HATLFF. Methods Fifty-eight infants referred to the Breastfeeding Education and Support Services (BESS) at The Royal Women's Hospital for assessment of <b>tongue-tie</b> and 25 control infants were assessed by two clinicians independently. Results The Appearance items received kappas between about 0. 4 to 0. 6, which represents "moderate" reliability. The first three Function items (lateralization, lift and extension of tongue) had kappa values over 0. 65 which indicates "substantial" agreement. The four Function items relating to infant sucking (spread, cupping, peristalsis and snapback) received low kappa values with insignificant p values. There was 96 % agreement between the two assessors on the recommendation for frenotomy (kappa 0. 92, excellent agreement). The study found that the Function Score can be more simply assessed using only the first three function items (ie not scoring the sucking items), with a cut-off of â¤ 4 for recommendation of frenotomy.

40|$|Objective: To {{determine}} whether, {{in infants}} with a <b>tongue-tie</b> and a feeding problem, the current medical treatment (referral to a lactation consultant) or immediate division works best and enables the infants to feed normally. Methods: Between March and July 2002, all the {{babies in the}} district of Southampton with tongue-ties were followed in order to see if they had any feeding problems. If they developed problems, the mothers gave written consent and were enrolled in an ethics committee approved, randomized, controlled trial, comparing 48 h of intensive lactation consultant support (control) with immediate division. Results: A total of 201 babies had <b>tongue-tie,</b> of whom 88 had breast-feeding or bottle-feeding problems. Thirty-one were not enrolled, so 57 were randomized. Of the 29 controls, one improved (3 %) and breast-fed for 8 months, but 28 did not. At 48 h, these 28 were offered division, which all accepted, and 27 improved (96 %) and fed normally. Of the 28 babies who had immediate division, 27 improved and fed normally but one remained on a nipple shield (P < 0. 001). Twenty-four mothers breast-fed for 4 months (24 / 40, 60 %). Overall, division of the <b>tongue-tie</b> babies resulted in improved feeding in 54 / 57 (95 %) babies.
