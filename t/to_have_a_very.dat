5|$|Before the 1980s, the {{prognosis}} or expected outcome of DPB was poor, especially in cases with superinfection (the {{emergence of a}} new viral or bacterial infection, in addition to the currently occurring infection) by P.aeruginosa. DPB continued <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> high mortality rate before generalized antibiotic treatment and oxygen therapy were beginning to be used routinely in the effort to manage symptoms. Around 1985, when long-term treatment with the antibiotic erythromycin became the standard for managing DPB, {{the prognosis}} significantly improved. In 1990, the association of DPB with HLA was initially asserted.|$|E
5|$|Cinematographer Roger Deakins {{discussed}} {{the look of}} the film with the Coens during pre-production. They told him that they wanted some parts of the film to have a real and contemporary feeling and other parts, like the dream sequences, <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> stylized look. Bill and Jacqui Landrum did all of the choreography for the film. For his dance sequence, Jack Kehler went through three three-hour rehearsals. The Coen brothers offered him three to four choices of classical music for him to pick from and he chose Modest Mussorgsky's Pictures at an Exhibition. At each rehearsal, he went through each phase of the piece.|$|E
5|$|Lead singer Smith {{revealed}} that the band will explore a new direction on their next album, pursuing a new, rawer sound. Before January 2009, Editors had written around eighteen new songs for the new album {{and they have been}} described as some of the most synthetic, raw and anthemic songs they have written to date. In October the band went to the studio to record some demos. The band spent the first week of April recording the album and on 8 April, they released a short video with information about the recording process. It announced that Mark 'Flood' Ellis would be the producer for the album. Earlier on in the year, the sound of the album was said <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> electric feel; the band often using the Terminator theme song as a reference.|$|E

5|$|Since Manchester United's first {{competitive}} match, 903 {{players have}} made a competitive first-team appearance for the club. Many of these players have spent only {{a short period of}} their career at Manchester United before seeking opportunities in other teams; some players had their careers cut short by injury, while others left for other reasons. Jimmy Davis was {{killed in a car accident}} in 2003 having made one first team appearance, the first Manchester United player to die during his career since the Munich air disaster, which claimed the lives of many of the Busby Babes, including Geoff Bent. The First and Second World Wars also disrupted the careers of footballers across the United Kingdom. Peter Beardsley only played one match for Manchester United but went on <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> successful career at Newcastle United, Liverpool and several other clubs; he also won 59 caps for the England national team.|$|E
5|$|The first dreadnoughts tended <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> light {{secondary}} armament {{intended to}} protect them from torpedo boats. Dreadnought carried 12-pounder guns; each of her twenty-two 12-pounders could fire at least 15 rounds a minute at any torpedo boat making an attack. The South Carolinas and other early American dreadnoughts were similarly equipped. At this stage, torpedo boats were expected to attack separately from any fleet actions. Therefore, {{there was no need to}} armour the secondary gun armament, or to protect the crews from the blast effects of the main guns. In this context, the light guns tended to be mounted in unarmoured positions high on the ship to minimize weight and maximize field of fire.|$|E
5|$|The two-colored bolete is an edible mushroom, {{although}} some {{may have an}} allergic reaction after ingestion that results in stomach upset. The mushroom has a very mild to no taste although it is said <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> distinctive taste {{like that of the}} king bolete. It can be cooked several ways, and the varying color of the cap can be used to determine if the mushroom is ready to be eaten. If the cap is a lighter red, then it is less mature and is in a stage where it is often larva infested or it can be soft fleshed, in some cases both. The cap should have a dark brick red color when safe to eat. Drying the two-colored bolete is a good method for storage. It is important to note the time it takes for the two-colored bolete to bruise when identifying it for consumption; the mushroom should take several minutes to bruise compared to the instant bruising of Boletus sensibilis, which is poisonous and has many of the same visual characteristics of the two-colored bolete.|$|E

40|$|Optimal {{searches}} for a fixed object are discussed and the rigorous analytical results of discrete search theory are presented. They {{show that the}} totally optimal, the uniformly optimal, the locally optimal, and the fastest searches are identical under not too restrictive assumptions. The mathematical formalism is illustrated by an Earth-approaching asteroid search and optimal {{searches for}} such objects are explicitly constructed. The approximation that Earth-approaching asteroids are fixed is equivalent <b>to</b> <b>having</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> high (~ 100 square degrees/hr) search rate. Generalizations to other types of astronomical search are briefly mentioned...|$|R
5|$|Xi Telescopii is an {{irregular}} variable star that ranges between magnitudes 4.89 and 4.94. Located 1079 light-years distant, it {{is a red}} giant of spectral type M2III that has a diameter around 5.6 times the Sun's, and a luminosity around 2973 {{times that of the}} Sun. Another irregular variable, RX Telescopii is a red supergiant that varies between magnitudes 6.45 and 7.47, just visible to the unaided eye under good viewing conditions. BL Telescopii is an Algol-like eclipsing binary system that varies between apparent magnitudes 7.09 and 9.08 over a period of just over 778 days (2 years 48 days). The primary is a yellow supergiant that is itself intrinsically variable. Dipping from its baseline magnitude of 9.6 to 16.5, RS Telescopii is a rare R Coronae Borealis variable—an extremely hydrogen-deficient supergiant thought to have arisen {{as the result of the}} merger of two white dwarfs; fewer than 100 have been discovered as of 2012. The dimming is thought to be caused by carbon dust expelled by the star. As of 2012, four dimmings have been observed. PV Telescopii is a class B-type (blue) extreme helium star that is the prototype of a class of variables known as PV Telescopii variables. First discovered in 1952, it was found <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> low level of hydrogen. One theory of its origin is that it is the result of a merger between a helium- and a carbon-oxygen white dwarf. If the combined mass does not exceed the Chandrasekhar limit, the former will accrete onto the latter star and ignite to form a supergiant. Later this will become an extreme helium star before cooling to become a white dwarf.|$|E

50|$|After {{moving to}} Australia from Hong Kong {{at the age}} of 2, To started {{swimming}} {{at the age of}} 5 at his local pool. He was originally scared of the water, but by age 12, had made rapid progress through his primary school swimming program. Growing up, <b>To</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> successful junior career, winning medals at both the 2009 Australian Youth Olympic Festival in Sydney and the 2008 Commonwealth Youth Games in Pune. In 2009, he came into the swimming spotlight when he broke Ian Thorpe's decade-old Australian record in the 16 years 200m individual medley, swimming a time of 2:04.31.|$|R

25|$|As {{mentioned}} above, a refractive cornea is only useful out of water; in water, {{there is}} little difference in refractive index between the vitreous fluid and the surrounding water. Hence creatures that {{have returned to the}} water – penguins and seals, for example – lose their highly curved cornea and return to lens-based vision. An alternative solution, borne by some divers, is <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> strongly focusing cornea.|$|E

25|$|Microelectronic {{components}} {{are created by}} chemically fabricating wafers of semiconductors such as silicon (at higher frequencies, compound semiconductors like gallium arsenide and indium phosphide) to obtain the desired transport of electronic charge and control of current. The field of microelectronics involves {{a significant amount of}} chemistry and material science and requires the electronic engineer working in the field <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> good working knowledge of the effects of quantum mechanics.|$|E
25|$|Consider a {{heat engine}} working between two {{temperatures}} TH and Ta. With Ta we have ambient temperature in mind, but, in principle {{it may also}} be some other low temperature. The heat engine is in thermal contact with two heat reservoirs which are supposed <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> large heat capacity so that their temperatures do not change significantly if heat QH is removed from the hot reservoir and Qa is added to the lower reservoir. Under normal operation TH > Ta and QH, Qa, and W are all positive.|$|E
25|$|A {{scientific}} {{paper in}} which Swaminathan {{and his team}} claimed to have produced a mutant breed of wheat by gamma irradiation of a Mexican variety (Sonora 64) resulting in Sharbati Sonora claimed <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> high lysine content led to a major controversy. The case was discussed as {{a classic example of}} scientific misdemeanor and was claimed to be an error made by the laboratory assistant. The episode was also compounded by the suicide of an agricultural scientist. Recent workers have studied it as part of a systemic problem in Indian agriculture research.|$|E

25|$|Although the {{reflectivity}} {{of water}} is very low at low and medium angles of incident light, it becomes very high at high angles of incident light {{such as those that}} occur on the illuminated side of Earth near the terminator (early morning, late afternoon, and near the poles). However, as mentioned above, waviness causes an appreciable reduction. Because light specularly reflected from water does not usually reach the viewer, water is usually considered <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> low albedo in spite of its high reflectivity at high angles of incident light.|$|E
25|$|Burns {{taught at}} Erasmus High School in Brooklyn for two years. While Burns enjoyed the {{educational}} field, she generally found {{the experience to}} be frustrating and wanted to continue her own studies. In 1906, at age twenty-seven, she moved to Germany to resume her studies in language. In Germany, Burns studied at the Universities of Bonn and Berlin from 1906 to 1909. Burns later moved to the United Kingdom, where she enrolled at Oxford University to study English. Burns was fortunate enough <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> extensive educational background because her father, Edwards Burns, supported her and financed her international education.|$|E
25|$|Prior {{animal studies}} have shown {{ingestion}} of melamine may lead to kidney stones, cancer or reproductive damage. One 1945 study suggested the chemical increased urine output when fed to dogs in large amounts. The chemical is known <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> low toxicity in rodents. The U.S. FDA knows of no studies of melamine involving felines and, if melamine is responsible, the increased sensitivity of cats is a mystery to officials. One hypothesis is the poisoned cat foods might have higher concentrations of melamine than the dog foods. Melamine can be detected in blood or urine tests.|$|E
