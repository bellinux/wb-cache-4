40|$|Effects {{of various}} factors {{affecting}} {{the rate of}} Carbon Nanotubes (CNTs) produced in a Swirled Floating Catalyst Chemical Vapour Deposition (SFCCVD) reactor were investigated. This study was performed in a vertical silica <b>tube</b> <b>plug</b> flow reactor developed by Iyuke at this University. Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) images revealed that both Single–Walled and Multi–Walled Carbon Nanotubes were produced continuously by this method. Experimental results also showed that pyrolysis/reaction temperature, acetylene flow rate, hydrogen flow rate and ratio of acetylene to hydrogen flow rate affect the rate of production of carbon nanotubes. Maximum production rate of 0. 31 g/min was obtained at operating conditions of acetylene flow rate of 370 ml/min, hydrogen flow rate of 180 ml/min and pyrolysis temperature of 1000 oC. It is worth mentioning that {{to the best of}} our knowledge such CNTs production rate and technique have not been reported in the open literature...|$|E
40|$|Two internet-based sonic performances, Letters and Bridges (between Leicester and Mexico City), and Migratory Dreams (between London and Bogotá), were {{developed}} by the artist with the leading question of what the 'in-between' space (Bhaba 1994; Ortega 2008) sounds like {{in the context of}} migration. Drawing on a Deep Listening (Oliveros 2005) practice, the artist undertook pre-performance workshops as a way to engage participants in the possibilities of travelling in time and space, and expressing through voice and other sounds feelings that arise when they migrate. The sharing of these sounds through the Internet in real time opened the idea of territory and allowed participants to express feelings towards place, identity and belonging, and to create mixed-reality narratives, within a supportive sound space free from geographical and cultural constraints. High quality bi-directional streaming audio software such as SoundJack and <b>Tube</b> <b>Plug</b> were used, adapted to the performance needs. This paper describes the process of the creation of each performance, considering its sonic, narrative, mediatised and performative aspects, offering a reflection on new auditoriums created for migrants' expression of their experiences in the 'in-between'. It argues that this specific approach helps migrants to expand their sense of space and develop an awareness of their multidimensional condition through sound...|$|E
40|$|The phloem {{provides}} {{a network of}} sieve tubes for long-distance translocation of photosynthates. For over a century, structural proteins in sieve tubes have presented a conundrum since they presumably increase the hydraulic resist-ance of the tubes while no potential function other than sieve tube or wound sealing {{in the case of}} injury has been suggested. Here we summarize and critically evaluate current speculations regarding the roles of these proteins. Our understanding suffers from the suggestive power of images; what looks like a sieve <b>tube</b> <b>plug</b> on micrographs may not actually impede translocation very much. Recent reports of an involvement of SEOR (sieve element occlusion-related) proteins, a class of P-proteins, in the sealing of injured sieve tubes are inconclusive; various lines of evidence suggest that, in neither intact nor injured plants, are SEORs determinative of translocation stoppage. Similarly, the popular notion that P-proteins serve in the defence against phloem sap-feeding insects is unsupported by empirical facts; it is conceivable that in functional sieve tubes, aphids actually could benefit from inducing a plug. The idea that rising cytosolic Ca 2 + generally triggers sieve tube blockage by P-proteins appears widely accepted, despite lacking experimental support. Even in forisomes, P-protein assemblages restricted to one single plant family and the only Ca 2 +-responsive P-proteins known, the available evidence does not unequivocally suggest that plug formation is the cause rather than a consequence of translocation stoppage. We conclude that the physiological roles of structura...|$|E

40|$|Regeneration, the {{replacement}} of lost or damaged body parts, and biomineralisation, the biologically controlled formation of minerals, are important and widespread abilities in the animal kingdom. Both phenomena have a complex evolutionary history; thus their study benefits from investigations in diverse animals. Spirobranchus (formerly Pomatoceros) lamarcki is a small tube-dwelling polychaete worm of the serpulid family. Serpulids have evolved a novel head appendage, the operculum, which functions as a defensive <b>tube</b> <b>plug</b> and regenerates readily when lost. In S. lamarcki, {{the end of the}} operculum is reinforced by a calcareous plate; thus, the operculum is a good system in which to study both regeneration and biomineralisation. This thesis explores several aspects of these important processes in the adult operculum. First, a time course of normal regeneration is established. Next, cell proliferation patterns are described, suggesting a combination of proliferation-dependent and proliferation-independent elements in opercular regeneration. The formation of the calcareous opercular plate is examined using both microscopic observations of whole opercular plates and X-ray diffraction analysis of isolated plate mineral, revealing a large shift in mineralogy over the course of regeneration. Histochemical study of alkaline phosphatase enzyme activity indicates the importance of these enzymes in the operculum, although their precise functions are as yet unclear. Finally, a preliminary survey of three opercular transcriptomic datasets is presented, with a broad sampling of gene families with regeneration- or biomineralisation-related roles in other animals. The opercular transcriptome constitutes the first biomineralisation transcriptome from any annelid, {{and one of the first}} transcriptomic datasets related to annelid regeneration. Many of the candidate genes examined here display interesting behaviour and suggest targets for further investigation. The work presented here establishes the S. lamarcki operculum as a promising model system in the field of evolutionary developmental biology...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the effects of}} various circulating water flow rate assumptions on the results from analyzing the performance impact of <b>tube</b> <b>plugging</b> in a condenser. The tube-side water’s flow rate has a strong influence in the results of condenser calculations. Affecting flow rate is the pressure drop of the circulating water. This paper advocates accounting for flow rate variations. The equations to account for tube-side pressure drops in the circulating water system are presented, as foundation for this accounting. The purposes of the paper are to present the development of key equations, to demonstrate application of the method of analysis, and to support the assertion that circulating water flow assumptions (as <b>tube</b> <b>plugging</b> varies) are important. The dependence of flow on <b>tube</b> <b>plugging</b> is calculated by accounting for the hydraulic balance between the tube-side circuit’s pressure drop and the pressure head provided by the circulating water pump. Of principal interest is the condenser’s shell side pressure. Comparisons of condenser performance are shown for several different assumptions about flow rate. Example plots are used to illustrate the effects of alternative modeling assumptions. Two models are used. The first is a submodel of a condenser and circulating water pump, along with supply and receiver reservoirs and associated piping. The second is a fossil steam turbine Rankine cycle that includes a condenser and circulating water pump. The method of calculation of the condenser’s shell-side equilibrium pressure closely follows the standard published by the Heat Exchange Institute.

40|$|Forisomes are {{contractile}} protein {{bodies that}} appear to control flux rates in the phloem of faboid legumes by reversibly <b>plugging</b> the sieve <b>tubes.</b> <b>Plugging</b> is triggered by Ca 2 + which induces an anisotropic deformation of forisomes, consisting of a longitudinal contraction and a radial expansion. By conventional light microscopy and confocal laser-scanning microscopy, the three-dimensional geometry of the forisome–sieve element–sieve plate complex in intact sieve tubes of leaflets of Vicia faba L. was reconstructed. Forisomes were mostly located close to sieve plates, and occasionally were observed drifting unrestrainedly along the sieve element, suggesting {{that they might be}} utilized as internal markers of flow direction. The diameter of forisomes in the resting state correlated with the diameter of their sieve elements, supporting the idea that radial expansion of forisomes is the geometric basis of reversible sieve <b>tube</b> <b>plugging.</b> Comparison of the present results regarding forisome geometry in situ with previously published data on forisome reactivity in vitro makes it questionable, however, whether forisomes are capable of completely sealing sieve tubes in V. faba leaves...|$|R

40|$|Aphids, which {{constitute}} one of {{the most}} important groups of agricultural pests, ingest nutrients from sieve tubes, the photoassimilate transport conduits in plants. Aphids are able to successfully puncture sieve tubes with their piercing mouthparts (stylets) and ingest phloem sap without eliciting the sieve tubes' normal occlusion response to injury. Occlusion mechanisms are calcium-triggered and may be prevented by chemical constituents in aphid saliva injected into sieve tubes before and during feeding. We recorded aphid feeding behavior with the electrical penetration graph (EPG) technique and then experimentally induced sieve <b>tube</b> <b>plugging.</b> Initiation of sieve tube occlusion caused a change in aphid behavior from phloem sap ingestion to secretion of watery saliva. Direct proof of "unplugging" properties of aphid saliva was provided by the effect of aphid saliva on forisomes. Forisomes are proteinaceous inclusions in sieve tubes of legumes that show calcium-regulated changes in conformation between a contracted state (below calcium threshold) that does not occlude the sieve tubes and a dispersed state (above calcium threshold) that occludes the sieve tubes. We demonstrated in vitro that aphid saliva induces dispersed forisomes to revert back to the nonplugging contracted state. Labeling Western-blotted saliva proteins with 45 Ca 2 + or ruthenium red inferred the presence of calcium-binding domains. These results demonstrate that aphid saliva has the ability to prevent sieve <b>tube</b> <b>plugging</b> by molecular interactions between salivary proteins and calcium. This provides aphids with access to a continuous flow of phloem sap and is a critical adaptation instrumental in the evolutionary success of aphids...|$|R

30|$|Rice {{varieties}} {{have different}} mechanisms {{of resistance to}} BPH, classed as antixenosis, antibiosis and tolerance (Alam and Cohen 1998; Painter 1951). Antibiosis is the most commonly studied mechanism (Cohen et al. 1997; Du et al. 2009; Qiu et al. 2010). BPH behavior (host-searching, feeding, mating) is most obviously affected by resistant varieties through antibiosis. After infestation by BPH the rice plant activates its own stress response for defense, including secretion of insect-toxic compounds, activation of expression of genes producing metabolic inhibitors, and formation of physical barrier (such as cuticle thickening, and callose deposition) to prevent continuous feeding by BPH (Cheng et al. 2013). Hao et al.

40|$|Abstract: A {{variety of}} {{degradation}} modes {{can affect the}} integrity of both heat exchanger (HX) and balance of plant tubing, resulting in expensive repairs, <b>tube</b> <b>plugging</b> or replacement of tube bundles. One key component for ensuring tube integrity is inspection and monitoring for detection and characterization of the degradation. Inservice inspection of HX and balance of plant tubing is usually carried out using eddy current (EC) bobbin coils, which are adequate {{for the detection of}} volumetric degradations. However, detection and quantification of additional modes of degradation such as pitting, intergranular attack (IGA), axial cracking and circumferential cracking require specialized probes. The need for timely, reliable detection and characterization of these modes of degradation is especially critical in Nuclear Generating Stations. Transmit-receive single-pass array probes, developed by AECL, offer high defect detectability in conjunction with fast and reliable inspection capabilities. They have strong directional properties, permitting probe optimization for circumferential or axial crack detection. Compared to impedance probes, they offer improved performance in the presence of variable lift-off. This EC technology can help resolve critical detection issues at susceptible areas, such as the rolled-joint transitions at the tubesheet, U-bends and tube-support intersections. This paper provides an overview of the operating principles and the capabilities of advanced ET inspection technology available for HX tube inspection. Examples of recent application of this technology in Nuclea...|$|R
