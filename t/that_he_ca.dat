40|$|The grapho-linguistic {{approach}} to teaching reading involves the labeling of self-initiated graphic images reinforced by the copying of the written labels, which helps the child to understand the transference of meaning from the object to its name to its written name. The best time to start labeling strategies is when the child draws recognizable images and demonstrates horizontality. A child who is actively trying to learn the signs attached to objects is demonstrating that he has discovered the symbolic function cf the written word. After proving successful in Washington, D. C., the grapho-linguistic {{approach to}} teaching reading now appears to hold the greatest promise for laying a good reading foundation based on the following factors: (1) drawing comes as naturally to a child as walking, talking, and playing; (2) the child invests his drawings with meaning; (3) the child who is helped to realize <b>that</b> <b>he</b> <b>ca...</b>|$|E

5000|$|Valtat {{suffered}} from tuberculosis, {{and he spent}} many autumn/winter seasons along the Mediterranean coast in Banyuls, Antheor and Saint-Tropez. Beginning in 1900, Valtat made several journeys by bicycle to visit Auguste Renoir at the Maison de la Poste in Cagnes. There, Valtat made several portrait drawings of Renoir on which he based a subsequent woodcut, and the two artists collaborated on a sculpture of Cézanne. Another friend of Valtat was Paul Signac, whom he visited often, traveling in a small Bollée motorcar <b>that</b> <b>he</b> acquired <b>ca.</b> 1904 from Signac {{in exchange for his}} painting Women at the Seashore. During his time spent near the Mediterranean, Valtat intensified his use of color and began to express his Fauvist tendencies, particularly in painting seascapes. Art historian Natalie Henderson Lee identifies Valtat as a [...] "proto-Fauve", although he remained somewhat apart from the Fauve group, and never adopted their extreme boldness in the treatment of form and color.|$|R

2500|$|Little {{is known}} about the life of Aert van den Bossche. It is {{believed}} <b>that</b> <b>he</b> was born <b>ca.</b> 1455 or earlier. [...] He was possibly originally from Bruges although he or his ancestors may have come from the town of 's-Hertogenbosch. [...] This can possibly be concluded from the fact that in Brussels where he was active from the 1490s he was recorded in 1499 as 'Aert van Panhedel alias van den Bossche, schilder' (painter). The town of 's-Hertogenbosch is colloquially referred to as Den Bosch (hence van den Bossche would mean [...] "from 's-Hertogenbosch') and his name could therefore indicate he was originally from there. This assumption is further confirmed by the fact <b>that</b> when <b>he</b> registered in the Bruges Guild of Saint Luke he signed with the name 'Harnoult van den Boske'. [...] It is also known that Aert's father, the painter Yanne van den Bossche, had received some orders from the Brussels [...] guild as well. Aert van den Bossche had a son Gielis, a.k.a. Gielis Panhedel, who signed Gilken van den Booeske and was an accomplished painter.|$|R
40|$|Background: Endometriosis is {{frequently}} {{associated with high}} levels of CA 125. This marker is therefore not useful for discriminating ovarian endometrioma from ovarian malignancy. The aim {{of this study was to}} establish a panel of complementary biomarkers that could be helpful in the differential diagnosis between ovarian endometriosis or other ovarian benign masses and ovarian cancer. Methods: Blood samples from 50 healthy women, 17 patients with benign ovarian tumors, 57 patients with ovarian endometrioma and 39 patients with ovarian cancer were analyzed and serum values were measured for the following biomarkers: <b>CA</b> 125, <b>HE</b> 4 and <b>CA</b> 72 - 4. Results: Serum CA 125 concentration was elevated in both patients with ovarian endometriosis and ovarian cancer but not in patients with other benign ovarian masses. HE 4 was never increased in patients with endometriosis or benign masses whereas it was significantly higher in all patients with ovarian cancer (p < 0. 05). A marked difference in CA 72 - 4 values was observed between women with ovarian cancer (67 %) and those with endometriosis (p < 0. 05). Conclusions: The results of the study suggest <b>that</b> <b>HE</b> 4 and <b>CA</b> 72 - 4 determination is the best approach to confirm the benign nature of ovarian endometrioma in women with high CA 125 levels...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE: The {{identification}} of novel biomarkers {{led to the}} development of the ROMA algorithm incorporating both <b>HE</b> 4 and <b>CA</b> 125 to predict malignancy in women with a pelvic mass. An ultrasound based prediction model (LR 2) developed by the International Ovarian Tumor Analysis (IOTA) study offers better diagnostic performance than CA 125 alone. In this study we compared the diagnostic accuracy between LR 2 and ROMA. METHODS: This study included women with a pelvic mass scheduled for surgery and enrolled in a previous prospective diagnostic accuracy study. Experienced ultrasound examiners, general gynecologists and trainees supervised by one of the experts performed the preoperative transvaginal ultrasound examinations. Serum biomarkers were taken prior to surgery. Accuracy of LR 2 and ROMA was estimated at completion of this study and did not form part of the decision making process. Final outcome was histology of removed tissues and surgical stage if relevant. RESULTS: In total 360 women were evaluated. 216 women had benign disease and 144 a malignancy. Overall test performance of LR 2 (AUC 0. 952) with 94 % sensitivity and 82 % specificity was significantly better than ROMA (AUC 0. 893) with 84 % sensitivity and 80 % specificity. Difference in AUC was 0. 059 (95 % CI: 0. 026 - 0. 091; P-value 0. 0004). Similar results were obtained when stratified for menopausal status. CONCLUSION: LR 2 shows better diagnostic performance than ROMA for the characterization of a pelvic mass in both pre- and postmenopausal women. These findings suggest <b>that</b> <b>HE</b> 4 and <b>CA</b> 125 may not play an important role in the diagnosis of ovarian cancer if good quality ultrasonography is available. status: publishe...|$|R
