Tjhung It is explained that a correlated <b>tapped</b> <b>delay</b> <b>line</b> <b>model</b> {{needs to be}} assumed for transmission performance estimation using Rake combining, even though the propagation channel itself can be characterised as a wide sense stationary uncorrelated scattering channel. Fading correlation between different tap gains can be computed by {{taking into account the}} transmit and receive chip pulse shaping filters. A simple example, showing how correlation affects performance estimation in Rake combining, is presented, assuming a two-path Rayleigh fading propagation channel. Problem: In mobile wireless communications, owing to reflection by obstacles such as buildings, there are many propagation paths between a transmitter and a receiver. If the time delays of multipaths cannot be neglected, the propagation channel is called a frequency selective channel. Assuming a wide sense stationary uncorrelated scattering (WSSUS) channel, the equivalent lowpass impulse response of the propagation channel at time t, owing to an excitation at time t – τ, can be expressed as [1] where Ω(τ) = Σ m= 0 E[|ξc,m(t) | 2]δ(τ – τc,m) is the power delay profile of the propagation channel (seen when the measurement bandwidth is infinite). The tap gain correlation ρl,n can be computed using where Γl = ∫ – ∞ Ω(τ) |hf(lTc – τ) | 2 dτ is the variance of the lth tap gain. if the overall transmit and receive chip filter impulse response is given, ρl,n of the <b>tapped</b> <b>delay</b> <b>line</b> <b>model</b> can be computed using eqn. 6 for the arbitrary power delay profile Ω(τ) of the propagation channel.

30|$|This paper {{presents}} a propagation channel simulator for polarized bidirectional wideband propagation channels. The generic channel model {{implemented in the}} simulator {{is a set of}} rays described by geometrical and propagation features such as the delay, 3 D direction at the base station and mobile station and the polarization matrix. Thus, most of the wideband channel <b>models</b> including <b>tapped</b> <b>delay</b> <b>line</b> <b>models,</b> <b>tap</b> directional models, scatterer or geometrical models, ray-tracing or ray-launching results can be simulated. The simulator is composed of two major parts: firstly the channel complex impulse responses (CIR) generation and secondly the channel filtering. CIRs (or CIR matrices for MIMO configurations) are processed by specifying a propagation model, an antenna array configuration, a mobile direction, and a spatial sampling factor. For each sensor, independent arbitrary 3 D vectorial antenna patterns can be defined. The channel filtering is based on the overlap-and-add method. The time-efficiency and parameterization of this method are discussed with realistic simulation setups. The global processing time for the CIR generation and the channel filtering is also evaluated for realistic configuration. A simulation example based on a bidirectional wideband channel model in urban environments illustrates the usefulness of the simulator.|$|R

40|$|Future mobile {{communication}} systems are facing an {{increased demand for}} heterogeneous broadband services and applications. It is generally expected that the deployment of smart antennas will increase the overall system capacity and performance [Nos]. Smart antennas will not only increase the antenna gain, but also reduce interference and delay spread by means of spatial filtering and thus enhance {{the properties of the}} mobile radio channel. In the Integrated Broadband Mobile System (IBMS) [Bro], smart antennas are used in the micro-cellular environment to effectively improve the radio channel properties and enable more bandwidth-efficient higher modulation techniques. Therefore, reliable channel models are needed to obtain realistic estimates of the increased system capacity and performance. Several vector channel models have been worked out to demonstrate these effects. A vector channel model provides a time-varying vector impulse response that consists of the set of impulse responses between the transmitter and each of the antenna array outputs. The choice of a statistical modeling approach seems to be most promising. These statistical models can be divided into models based on simple geometric assumptions for a typical scattering-scenario [Lib] and directional <b>tapped</b> <b>delay</b> <b>line</b> <b>models</b> that rely on some clustering of scattered waves [Mar].

40|$|Abstract — Broadband fixed {{wireless}} access (BFWA) has been recognised as an effective first kilometre solution for delivering broadband services to residential and business customers. The large bandwidths available above 20 GHz make radio systems with very high capacities possible. Users can be offered bit rates {{in the order of}} several hundred Mbit/s. Such radio links can, in many cases, be an alternative to optical fibre in terms of capacity. This article presents a time dynamic channel model for BFWA operating above 20 GHz.

40|$|In this thesis, we {{consider}} multicarrier spread-spectrum multiple access systems. In the first work, a subspace-based linear minimum mean-squared error (MMSE) multiuser detection scheme is proposed for a multicarrier direct-sequence code-division multiple-access (MC-DS-CDMA) system. Typically, a MC-DS-CDMA system employs a band-limited chip waveform. The band-limited {{nature of the}} chip waveform causes problem in applying standard subspace techniques because no non-null noise subspace can be formed. It is shown that channel and timing information needed {{for the construction of}} the linear MMSE detector can be identified by a multiple-signal-classification-like algorithm based on a finite-length truncation approximation of the chip waveform. In practice, since perturbed versions of the subspaces assumed in the finite-length truncation approximation are actually observed, and because of the band-limited property of the chip waveform, the accuracy of the channel estimation and, hence, the performance of the MMSE detector are degraded. This effect is investigated. In the second work, MC-DS-CDMA systems in frequency-selective fading channels are investigated. A consistent channel model is used for each system. The <b>tapped</b> <b>delay</b> <b>line</b> channel <b>model</b> with uniformly spaced, uncorrelated taps is investigated to model a complex Gaussian, wide-sense stationary, uncorrelated scattering channel. An approximate average bit error rate expression is obtained for the receiver with RAKE fingers on each subcarrier branch, whose outputs are combined according to the maximum signal-to-noise ratio criterion. In the third work, {{we consider}} multiuser communications in an additive white Gaussian noise channel in the presence of significant Doppler shifts. It is well-known that the time asynchrony between users in a DS-CDMA system allows for interference suppression. Similarly, the different Doppler shifts of received signals from a multi-user channel can be exploited in the frequency domain to achieve interference suppression. In this work, we show that this can be achieved with MC-CDMA. The relationship between the interference suppression capability and the Doppler shifts is studied in terms of signal-to-interference ratio. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—The {{problem of}} initial {{acquisition}} of the channel parameters of a wideband CDMA signal received in a multipath fading environment with multiaccess interference is considered. Since the signal is wideband, the fading is frequency selective and the parameters of interest are the (complex) gains and delays in the corresponding <b>tapped</b> <b>delay</b> <b>line</b> <b>model</b> for the channel. The scenario considered is one where a single new user is to be acquired on the reverse link by the base station, and where the channel parameters of the interfering users are known. Following a minimum mean squared error (MMSE) strategy for suppressing the multiaccess interference, the parameter estimation problem is posed in a maximum likelihood framework. To reduce complexity, the solution is implemented in two stages: first, the estimated tap delays are restricted to be at chip spacings; second, the number of taps is reduced by allowing for arbitrary spacing between them. The performance of the proposed techniques is studied through numerical simulations. It is shown that significant gains {{can be obtained by}} exploiting the structure of the interference and acquiring the channel parameters jointly.

The exact analysis approach involves finding the probability density functions (pdf's) for the per-user multi-user interference and the inter-symbol interference from the desired user. These probability density functions are derived from the pdf's of each contributing factor to the interference, including the empirical cross-correlation function pdf. The characteristic functions of the per-user multi-user interference and the inter-symbol interference are found from the pdf's, and the characteristic function of the total interference is given by the product of the inter-symbol interference characteristic function and the K - 1 multi-user interference characteristic functions. The average probability of error is calculated using the characteristic function of the total interference. Conclusions on the performance of the selection diversity algorithm and the power control algorithm are drawn, based on the results...|$|E
40|$|A mobile channel {{simulator}} {{can be constructed}} either in the time domain using a tapped delay line filter or in the frequency domain using the time variant transfer function of the channel. Transfer function modelling has many advantages over impulse response modelling. Although the transfer function channel model has been envisaged by several researchers {{as an alternative to}} the commonly employed <b>tapped</b> <b>delay</b> <b>line</b> <b>model,</b> so far it has not been implemented. In this work, {{channel simulator}}s for single carrier and multicarrier OFDM system based on time variant transfer function of the channel have been designed and implemented using DSP techniques in SIMULINK. For a single carrier system, the simulator was based on Bello's transfer function channel model. Bello speculated that about 10 Βτ(_MAX) frequency domain branches might result in a very good approximation of the channel (where в is the signal bandwidth and τ(_MAX) is the maximum excess delay of the multi-path channel). The simulation results showed that 10 Bτ(_MAX) branches gave close agreement with the tapped delay line model(where Be is the coherence bandwidth). This number is π times higher than the previously speculated 10 Bτ(_MAX). For multicarrier OFDM system, the simulator was based on the physical (PHY) layer standard for IEEE 802. 16 - 2004 Wireless Metropolitan Area Network (WirelessMAN) and employed measured channel transfer functions at the 2. 5 GHz and 3. 5 GHz bands in the simulations. The channel was implemented in the frequency domain by carrying out point wise multiplication of the spectrum of OFDM time The simulator was employed to study BER performance of rate 1 / 2 and rate 3 / 4 coded systems with QPSK and 16 -QAM constellations under a variety of measured channel transfer functions. The performance over the frequency selective channel mainly depended upon the frequency domain fading and the channel coding rate. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|E

If the X values were from the outputs of a <b>tapped</b> <b>delay</b> <b>line,</b> then the combination of <b>tapped</b> <b>delay</b> <b>line</b> and ALC would comprise an adaptive filter. However, the X values could be the values of an array of pixels.
