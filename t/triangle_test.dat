40|$|The fingerprint-copy attack aims {{to confuse}} camera {{identification}} based on sensor pattern noise. However, the <b>triangle</b> <b>test</b> {{shows that the}} forged images undergone fingerprint-copy attack would share a non-PRNU (Photo-response nonuniformity) component with every stolen image, and thus can detect fingerprint-copy attack. In this paper, we propose an improved fingerprint-copy attack scheme. Our main idea is to superimpose the estimated fingerprint into the target image dispersedly, via employing a block-wise method and using the stolen images randomly and partly. We also develop a practical method to determine {{the strength of the}} superimposed fingerprint based on objective image quality. In such a way, the impact of non-PRNU component on the <b>triangle</b> <b>test</b> is reduced, and our improved fingerprint-copy attack is difficultly detected. The experiments evaluated on 2, 900 images from 4 cameras show that our scheme can effectively fool camera identification, and significantly degrade the performance of the <b>triangle</b> <b>test</b> simultaneously...|$|E

40|$|Both the <b>triangle</b> <b>test</b> and 2 -AFC are {{commonly}} used discrimination tests used in research and industry. The 2 -AFC is statistically {{more powerful than the}} <b>triangle</b> <b>test,</b> but can only be used when the quality and direction of difference is known (i. e. one sample is sweeter). By allowing subjects to define their own criteria for use in the 2 -AFC, it has been suggested, but not proven, that the 2 -AFC procedure can be used when the sensory difference between two samples is not known or easily defined. This modified 2 -AFC procedure is called the Subject Defined 2 -AFC (SD- 2 -AFC). This study compares the SD- 2 -AFC to the triangle and conventional 2 -AFC (2 -AFC) under a number of realistic conditions. Four food systems, different in the magnitude and quality of sensory difference, were examined. Results demonstrated that, in conditions where the 2 -AFC could have been used, the SD- 2 -AFC did not perform as well as either the 2 -AFC or triangle tests. In conditions where the 2 -AFC could not have been used, the SD- 2 -AFC did not perform as well as the <b>triangle</b> <b>test.</b> The failure of the SD- 2 -AFC was due to subjects inverting their criteria (i. e., picking 'less sweet' instead of 'sweet'). Inverted subjects performed lower than expected, whereas noninverted subjects performed better than the 2 -AFC or triangle tests. These results were explained in terms of signal detection theory...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} the {{research}} was the evaluation of efficiency of anaerobic ability (power), anaerobic endurance, anaerobic fatigue and the restitution of the pulse rate of alpine skiing students through the slalom simulator. In addition, {{the aim of the}} research was the correlation of the special tests of alpine skiing on dry ground (octagon test) and in snow (<b>triangle</b> <b>test</b> and slalom test) with the target of determining ability levels. Methods: The 20 people sample was composed by two teams of male and female who took the course for advanced (n = 7) aged 23 ± 1. 40 years and for beginners course (n = 13) aged 20 ± 1. 49 years. For the evaluation process two special tests were used, on the ground and in snow. The ground test was completed in the slalom simulator for 40 seconds. The second ground test was the octagon bouncing (40 cm each side) x 3. The snow test was the Haczkiewicz test (<b>triangle</b> <b>test)</b> and the slalom (7 gates), where the time of a try was measured. Results: The best efficiency in anaerobic power was made by the advanced males and females, while in the anaerobic endurance by the beginners males and females. The best performance in the dexterity tests in snow on the triangle and slalom test was made by the advanced males and beginners females respectively. Conclusions: The significant correlation between the results of anaerobic performance in the slalom simulator and the <b>triangle</b> <b>test</b> in snow confirms the means of diagnosing skill and fitness on dry ground and snow respectively. There is a significant correlation between snow test results and there is no correlation with the octagon test.

40|$|The {{objective}} of this experiment {{was to determine whether}} converting from raw milk cheese production to pasteurized milk cheese production would have a positive or negative business impact for Valley Ford Cheese Company, based on consumer acceptance. The project began by making two batches of Estero Gold cheese, one with raw milk and one with pasteurized milk. The raw milk cheese was produced at Valley Ford Cheese Company, with the milk provided from its usual source, Mountain View Jersey Dairy, composed of 100 % Jersey cows. The pasteurized cheese was produced at the Cal Poly Creamery, with the milk provided from the Cal Poly Dairy. The two cheeses were then aged for 6 months in a controlled environment of 50 degrees Fahrenheit and 88 % humidity. Upon completion of the required aging period, sensory was conducted with 48 random college students. It was important to recognize that none of the participants had prior experience in the area of cheese evaluation. The participants were asked to complete the two sensory tests. 1) The preference test provided two random samples (one pasteurized cheese and one raw cheese) to determine which one they preferred. 2) The <b>Triangle</b> <b>test</b> asked the participants sample three cheeses, two being the same and one different, and determine the odd sample. The results of the study found that 41 out of 48 participants successfully determined the odd sample in the <b>triangle</b> <b>test,</b> and 34 out of 46 preferred the pasteurized milk sample over the raw milk sample. The resulting data indicated a significant preference in pasteurized milk cheese over raw milk cheese and a difference in taste as indicated by the <b>triangle</b> <b>test.</b> In conclusion, on the basis of purely sensory attributes, Valley Ford Cheese Company would not suffer a business setback by the conversion of raw milk cheese production to pasteurized milk cheese production and should consider this change...|$|E
40|$|For {{depth of}} field (DOF) rasterization, it is often desired to have an {{efficient}} tile versus <b>triangle</b> <b>test,</b> which can conservatively compute which samples on the lens that need to execute the sample-in-triangle test. We present a novel test for this, which is optimal {{in the sense that}} the region on the lens cannot be further reduced. Our test is based on removing half-space regions of the (u, v) -space on the lens, from where the triangle definitely cannot be seen through a tile of pixels. We find the intersection of all such regions exactly, and the resulting region can be used to reduce the number of sample-in-triangle tests that need to be performed. Our main contribution is that the theory we develop provides a limit for how efficient a practical tile versus defocused <b>triangle</b> <b>test</b> ever can become. To verify our work, we also develop a conceptual implementation for DOF rasterization based on our new theory. We show that the number of arithmetic operations involved in the rasterization process can be reduced. More importantly, with a tile test, multi-sampling anti-aliasing can be used which may reduce shader executions and the related memory bandwidth usage substantially. In general, this can be translated to a performance increase and/or power savings...|$|E

The treatments {{consisted of the}} addition of: 1) 156 ppm sodium nitrite, 2) 40 ppm sodium nitrite and. 26 % potassium sorbate, and 3). 26 % potassium sorbate. Sensory evaluations utilized <b>triangle</b> <b>tests,</b> hedonic evaluations, and magnitude estimations of flavor and texture. Color was rated with a Gardner color difference meter. Rancidity levels were ascertained by the 2 -thio-barbituric acid (TBA) <b>test.</b> In the <b>triangle</b> <b>tests,</b> panelists were able to differentiate between nitrite and nitrite-sorbate frankfurters, {{as well as between}} nitrite and sorbate-treated frankfurters, but not between nitrite-sorbate and sorbate frankfurters. On the hedonic scale of 1 to 9 for frankfurter flavor, all treat-ments were rated as 5, neither like nor dislike. In the magnitude estimation tests for flavor, no differences were found among any of the treatments. However, in color tests under normal light-ing, the nitrite-treated frankfurters were judged to have twice the amount of typical frankfurter color as did the nitrite-sorbate and sorbate frankfurters. From magnitude estimation tests of texture, {{it was found that the}} inclusion of nitrite at either the 40 or 156 ppm level in frankfurters had improved texture over the ones without nitrite. Gardner color difference meter scores corresponded to the panelists evaluation for <b>triangle</b> <b>tests</b> on color. There were no differences in lightness (L) and yellowness (b) values; however, nitrite frankfurters had highest a values, the most red color. The nitrite frankfurters had low TBA values throughout the study (<. 5 mg/kg sample). The samples with sorbate or nitrite-sorbate exhibited significantly higher TBA values than the samples with nitrite only after 4 and 6 weeks storage at 4 C, possibly due to the oxidation promotion by sorbate.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{evaluate}} the sensory characteristics and consumer acceptability of quality protein maize (QPM) in rural Tanzania. Due to the malnutrition problem facing consumers in developing countries, QPM which has almost double the amount of tryptophan and lysine, has been identified as a possible solution to this problem. To know whether consumers will accept QPM, it is vital that its sensory attributes and consumer acceptance tests are carried out. Sensory characteristics were determined using home use testing and central location methods by use of stiff porridge. Three districts were visited and 120 consumers participated in home use testing, whereas 30 respondents participated in the central location testing. At the central location, <b>triangle</b> <b>test</b> was also undertaken to find out if a difference exists between QPM and conventional maize. Additionally, acceptability of QPM was tested using BDM method. Consumer characteristics of QPM were highly appreciated for stiff porridge, a major maize product in East Africa. This was observed both in home use and sensory location testing. Likewise, consumers were willing to pay more for QPM than for conventional maize in all evaluation criteria used. <b>Triangle</b> <b>test</b> showed a significant difference between QPM and conventional maize.

40|$|This {{research}} project fully defines and evaluates {{a new approach}} in sensory omission testing, based on the same-different test (ASTM E 2139 - 05 2011) and the Thurstonian measure d′. The applications of this new approach were investigated to fully characterise sweet and savoury flavour models and to investigate interactions between flavour compounds. Panels of naïve assessors {{conducted a series of}} omission tests using both a strawberry (9 volatiles) and a savoury (10 volatiles) flavour model. Using the Thurstonian d′ as a measure of the sensitivity of the discrimination test, results showed that the new approach using the same-different test was more sensitive compared to the more traditional approach using the triangle test: the d′ values obtained using the same-different test were 1. 2 to 3. 5 times higher than the d′ values obtained using the <b>triangle</b> <b>test.</b> It was hypothesised that the evaluation of three samples in the <b>triangle</b> <b>test</b> generated additional noise related to carry-over, sensory fatigue and memory effects. In particular, the <b>triangle</b> <b>test</b> requires that the three successive stimulus sensations are stored into memory until the discrimination test has been completed. The same-different approach was then successfully applied to (i) determine the relative importance of individual volatiles in ortho- and retronasal flavours (ii) assess interactions between volatiles in mixtures, and (iii) investigate interactions between congruent tastes and aromas in flavours. Results showed that cis- 3 -hexen- 1 -ol, 4 -hydroxy- 2, 5 -dimethyl- 3 -furanone and ethyl butanoate {{play a key role in}} the strawberry flavour, while sulfur compounds play a major role in the savoury flavour. For both the sweet and the savoury flavours, orthonasal perception was more sensitive to the removal of individual volatiles and this was attributed to different efficiency in delivery to the olfactory receptors. The same-different approach highlighted synergistic, suppressive and blending interactions between volatiles within flavour mixtures. In particular, the presence of 4 -hydroxy- 2, 5 -dimethyl- 3 -furanone increased the assessor sensitivity to the removal of other individual volatiles in the savoury flavour. Cross-modal interactions were highlighted within the strawberry flavour, particularly where congruency between taste and aroma could be identified. The omission approach brings a novel contribution to sensory science as it allows further analyses and a deeper understanding of flavour. This study pioneers the use of the Thurstonian d′ for omission experiments, enabling the relative importance of the individual components of flavour perception to be determined...|$|E
