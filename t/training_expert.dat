30|$|Although it {{has been}} speculated that mammogram {{expertise}} involves holistic strategies (Kundel et al., 2007), direct tests of holistic processing strategies in radiology {{have yet to be}} conducted. To investigate a possible link between holistic perception and mammogram expertise, we tested the effects of inversion on a group of experienced radiologists (>[*] 5  years of radiology experience) and radiology residents (<[*] 5  years of radiology experience). On average, an experienced mammographer evaluates between 1000 and 15, 000 images per year (Evans et al., 2013) compared to resident radiologists, who see fewer than 300 cases during the course of their clinical <b>training.</b> <b>Expert</b> mammographers and residents have likely received similar formal mammography training, but it is the experts, with their extended experience, who exhibit evidence of rapid detection (Evans et al., 2013; Kundel & Nodine, 1975).|$|E
