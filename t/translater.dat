5000|$|The Romuléon was {{translated}} into French beginning in 1460 by Jean Miélot, an author {{in the service of}} Philip the Good, Duke of Burgundy. [...] Miélot was assigned the role ‘de <b>translater,</b> escrier et historier les livres de Monseigneur’ (‘to translate, write out and [...] "historiate" [...] (either to narrate or adorn) the books of my Lord,’ i.e., the duke). [...] His Latin source was a work, also called the Romuleon, compiled in Florence between 1361 and 1364, by Benvenuto da Imola. [...] The preface of this Latin work states that the compilation was taken up at the request of Gomez Albornoz, the governor of Bologna. [...] This source in turn was based on a number of classical texts, including [...] Livy’s Ab Urbe Condita and the Lives of Suetonius.

As to the nature of production, {{there is no shortage of}} common points: anglophone hypertrophy, at the expense of literatures in African languages ​​of non-European origin; predominance of English authors from South Africa and Nigeria; over- representation of four authors (Brink, Breytenbach, Coetzee, Gordimer), this "white quartet" nevertheless occupying more space in French (half of the South African titles published) than in German (a fifth). The colonial history explains another major difference between the two cultures regarding the translation of African literature: since 1945, nearly four times more titles were translated into German than into French, some 611 titles against 165, all original languages ​​combined. Reason being that no African authors write in German, while several write in French. Paradoxically, in French, the rise of Negritude in the 1950 s penalized African literatures not of French origin, at the same time as it created in Germany around the <b>translater</b> Jahn Janheinz a tradition whose translational benefits would later extend to all literatures of Africa, once over the crisis of the disenchantment following some African Independences...|$|E
40|$|The {{relation}} between Bruno Schulz and the Netherlands {{can be described}} from a twofold perspective. On the one hand, attention can {{be paid to the}} way Bruno Schulz incorporated into his work various realia related to the Low Countries. In view of Schulz's well-known fascination with "exotic toponyms", it should be stated that the Netherlands never occupied a privileged place in Schulz's geographic imagination. The only significant reference to the Low Countries in his prose (i. e., the "fertilized birds' eggs from ( [...] .) Holland incubated by enormous Belgian hens", as we read in 'The Birds') seems to stem from the author's desire to "mythologize reality" rather than being inspired by any kind of reliable knowledge about Belgian or Dutch poultry. On the other hand, a more fruitful approach would be to investigate the way Schulz and his works have {{made their way to the}} Netherlands. First of all, particular attention should be paid to the publishing history of Schulz's work in the Low Countries. His prose was introduced in the Dutch-speaking area relatively late, in the beginning of the 1970 s, when the first Dutch edition of Sklepy cynamonowe (De kaneelwinkels) appeared. This translation was far from a commercial success and received relatively little attention in the literary press. Morever, some literary critics pointed out major deficiencies in the translation. Therefore, throughout the 1970 s, Schulz remained a relatively unknown writer, whose work was published in low, mainly bibliophilic editions. Schulz's prose entered a next stage in the beginning of the 1980 s, when the first Dutch edition of Sanatorium pod Klepsydrąwas launched (followed by a new edition of De kaneelwinkels). These publications received more critical acclaim and also drew attention to Schulzâs activities as a graphic artist. The 1990 s saw the consolidation of Schulz's position in the literary system of the Low Countries. Apart from being incorporated into several anthologies, Schulz's stories were also gathered in an edition of his complete works (the <b>translater</b> of which was awarded the most prestigious Dutch translation award). Schulz's prominent position in the Dutch literary system is also exemplified by the fact that his work is often implicitly or explicitly referred to in the works of mainstream Dutch and Flemish authors (both fictional and essayistic). Moreover, it should be noted that literary critics sometimes use Schulz as a point of reference when discussing contemporary Dutch literature. This does not mean, however, that Schulz's position in the Netherlands is restricted to the typical role of a writers' writer. During the past couple of years, his work has gained growing interest among film makers, theater groups and graphical artists alike. Its most remarkable manifestation is the Utrecht-based Bruno Schulz Institute, which has been called into being by the local artist Sabine Vess. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|La réforme de la Recherche et de l’Université en France peut avoir des conséquences fâcheuses sur la sociologie historique comparée du politique qui s’y est développée depuis les années 1970. La relecture des principaux fondements théoriques {{permet de}} rappeler les objectifs de l’exercice comparatif : partager, voire forger un vocabulaire, en excluant que ce dernier puisse {{identifier}} un dénominateur commun ou conduire à une explication causale.

Mutualiser des interrogations sans en attendre des réponses unitaires. Les <b>translater</b> de l’analyse d’une société à celle d’une autre. Montrer que les continuités sont par définition des discontinuités. Reprendre à nouveaux frais la question de l’« historicité propre » des sociétés, dont le rapport à l’Ailleurs et à l’Autre est un élément constitutif et qui est indissociable de leur extraversion fondamentale. Ne pas déduire de cette « historicité propre » des sociétés que les « trajectoires du politique » sont des parallèles destinées à ne pas se rejoindre, et refuser de substituer à la vieille idée de l’incommensurabilité des « cultures » ou des « civilisations » le nouveau préjugé de l’incommensurabilité de ces trajectoires historiques. Rappeler en conséquence que la comparaison ne peut pas être à sens unique et que l’historicité des sociétés européennes gagne à être mesurée à l’aune des sociétés africaines ou asiatiques autant que l’inverse. En bref, il s’agit de comparer pour singulariser, et de singulariser pour universaliser. Comparative Politics in France. A tentative Academic Autobiography - The undergoing government-led {{reforms of the}} Higher Education and Research system in France may negatively affect those fields of historical sociology and comparative politics that have developed since the early 1970 s, and are nowadays gaining grounds within the wider international scientific community. A fresh reading of the masterworks that provided its theoretical cornerstones (those of Weber, Gramsci, Foucault, Deleuze, Bourdieu and historians like Michel de Certeau and Paul Veyne) {{reminds us of the}} main ambitions of the whole comparative exercise: crafting and sharing an analytical glossary, rooted in the confrontation of various research experiences without expecting it to become either a common denominator or the first step towards any linear causal explanation. To put it another way, its strategic goals could be listed as follows: instead of entities, comparing practices, processes, and therefore historical periods that by definition are contingent, ambivalent, and fragmentary. Gathering and sharing common questions without expecting common answers. Conveying those questions raised from the analysis of one peculiar society to the study of another one. Demonstrating that continuities, that lie at the roots of the historical and political sociology's approach of things political, are actually discontinuities. Reassessing in a creative manner the issue of the “autonomous historicity” of both European and non-Western societies, by recalling to mind the fact that their relationship to the Other and to the Elsewhere is one of its key constituents, and hence that it cannot be dissociated from their fundamental “extraversion”. Acknowledging that this “autonomous historicity” argument does not lead to assuming that the various trajectories of those political societies are parallel and never merge. In the same way, this acknowledgement should not mean the revival of the old idea of the incommensurability of “cultures” or “civilisations”. This latter point should therefore remind us that comparison should not be only a one way process, and that European societies' historicity should also be assessed by comparing it with African and Asian societies as much as the opposite. To put it in a nutshell, the whole exercise is to make comparisons to mark out, and to mark out to universalize. By doing so, we can deepen our understanding both of how democracy was transplanted in non-Western societies and of the paradoxes of this process on a “long duration” scale...|$|E
40|$|During {{nineteenth century}} China, {{particularly}} the period spanning the 1820 s to the 1860 s, four {{different versions of}} the Bible （the entirety of the Old and New Testaments） were translated and published by missionaries living in China. The linguistic problems facing these <b>translaters</b> were many and complex. In this paper I will consider the debate on the use of Shangdi （上帝） 〔Shang Te〕 and Shen （神） 〔Shin〕 in Bible translations found in the Chinese Repository （中国叢報）. The Chinese Repository was published from 1832 until 1851. Its aim was to inform readers about interesting facts regarding China. The argument about the use of terms is taken up in the last of three volumes. In this paper I will clarify the dispute between British missionaries and American missionaries about the difference of opinion regarding the translation of the word “God” into Chinese. A Bible translation committee of five missionaries was organized in Shanghai in 1843. The main point of the dispute was regarding the choice of one word that might best describe the concept of God in Chinese. In 1848, details about the most appropriate term were still being debated by Walter Henry Medhurst （麥都思 1796 － 1857 ） and William Jones Boone （文惠廉 1811 － 1864 ）. Medhurst believed that Shangdi could be used for translating God. In contrast, Boon rejected Medhurst’s use of Shangdi, and advocated the use of Shen instead. The Chinese Repository provided a place where Medhurst and Boone discussed their theories, predictions, and other aspects of rendering the Bible into Chinese. Each of them was well educated and deeply versed in the Chinese language. They were both dedicated to finding the most appropriate Chinese vocabulary to use in translating the abstract notion of God. The use of Shangdi or Shen became a burning issue for these two men. My aim here is to investigate the circumstances surrounding the missionaries’ decisions for choosing these terms [...] 研究ノー...|$|R
40|$|The intralingual {{translation}} or rewording of a Bible text into Non-standard Afrikaans: {{the artistic}} and creative aspects behind it People who are proficient {{in a language}} {{to the extent that}} they can communicate confi dently and comfortably in it, are not always aware of the technical points and artistic aspects which need to be considered when translating/interpreting/ transmutating from one language into another. These manifest in the following situations: (a) texts of which the original has been recorded in Standard Afrikaans, but which should be received by the variety user in his or her own dialect/code in order to be better understood; and the reverse, (b) original texts of the variety user which exist as spoken texts in the source language/code/dialect only, and have to be translated into the standard language so that other speakers of this language can also access them. It is sometimes thought that anybody who is proficient in a specific language, be it the standard language or a variety thereof, can translate from one into the other. In this process, however, a treasure of creativity, art and knowledge is overlooked, thus diminishing the enjoyment of reading a text. If, on the contrary, the art behind the translation of a text is comprehended, enjoyment when reading the translation is enhanced. Because language is descriptive, the reader who is exposed to a translation of the text will be introduced to the idiomatic use of the source language and thus obtain a view into the world, culture, habits and traditions of the variety user. The research reported in this article was directed by the following: the translation of a part of the Bible into Non-standard Afrikaans should be considered a rewording (intralingual translation) and not a translation (interlingual translation) or adaptation (intersemiotic translation). Intralingual translation recognizes the aspects of creativity and art to introduce and discuss the defence of this claim to the broader academic society. If a text cannot be identified as an intralingual translation the artistic and creative elements underpinning it cannot be recognized or appreciated. Intralingual translation attempts to give configuration to the creativity and verbal art of the original variety of e. g. Afrikaans, even though it has never been recorded before. Something of the creativity and artistic principles involved in intralingual translation manifests in the attempts of the <b>translater</b> to transpose the text from Standard Afrikaans into the variety. It requires an artistic approach to transpose a text from Standard Afrikaans into a code of Afrikaans in such a way that it will read as a text with which the varietal speaker will be able to identify. According to Munday (2004 : 24) it is essential that the transposer has the ability to use both codes of a language like a mother tongue speaker, with knowledge of and insight into the cultural background, humour and customs of both codes. With knowledge of both codes the transposer does not merely reset the text into readable format, but also recreates those elements that are not apparent in words. The claim made above has been approached from three points of view, viz. the reality that very few texts have been recorded in Non-standard Afrikaans, Jakobson's theory that the signs in the source text must be replaced with signs of equivalent value or meaning in the target text; and some findings by Du Plessis (2006) that it is important that the intralingual translation takes place on three levels, namely: the language level, the geographic level and the religious level. After a short theoretical-technical discussion, an intralingual translation of a part from the Bible in Standard Afrikaans into Tsotsi-Afrikaans is presented. This is followed by a discussion of the creative, technical and artistic aspects involved in the specific intralingual translation. Die oorsetting van ’n Bybelteks na Niestandaardafrikaans: die kunssinnigheids- en kreatiewe aspekte daaragter Die oorsetting van 'n teks (soos 'n Bybelgedeelte) na Niestandaardafrikaans moet beskou word as 'n transponering (intratalige vertaling) daarvan en nie as 'n getroue en presiese vertaling (intertalige vertaling) of ook nie 'n aanpassing (intersemiotiese vertaling) nie, omdat die term transponering erkenning gee aan die kunssinnige- en kreatiwiteitsaspekte van die oorsetting. Hierdie uitgangspunt is vanuit drie gesigspunte benader: vanuit Jakobson se teorie, vanuit Du Plessis (2006) se beskouing van transponering en vanuit 'n eie transponering van die outeur waarmee sekere kunssinnige- en kreatiwiteitsbeginsels geïllustreer kon word. Na 'n kort teoretiestegniese bespreking word 'n transponering van 'n Bybelgedeelte uit Standaardafrikaans na Tsotsi-Afrikaans aangebied. Daarna vind 'n bespreking van die kreatiwiteits-, tegniese en kunsaspekte van die betrokke transponering plaas...|$|E
