5|$|A 1994 {{community-based}} {{study indicated}} that two out of every 100,000 people suffered from SCSFLS, while a 2004 emergency room-based study indicated five per 100,000. SCSFLS generally affects the young and middle aged; the average age for onset is 42.3 years, but onset can range from ages 22 to 61. In an 11-year study women {{were found to be}} <b>twice</b> <b>as</b> <b>likely</b> to be affected as men.|$|E
5|$|SCSFLS afflicts 5 out {{of every}} 100,000 people. On average, the {{condition}} is developed {{at the age of}} 42, and women are <b>twice</b> <b>as</b> <b>likely</b> as men to develop the condition. Some people with SCSFLS chronically leak cerebrospinal fluid despite repeated attempts at patching, leading to long-term disability due to pain. SCSFLS was first described by German neurologist Georg Schaltenbrand in 1938 and by American physician Henry Woltman of the Mayo Clinic in the 1950s.|$|E
5|$|In the United States, gout is <b>twice</b> <b>as</b> <b>likely</b> {{in males}} of African descent {{than those of}} European descent. Rates are high among Pacific Islanders and the Māori, but the disease is rare in {{aboriginal}} Australians, despite a higher mean uric acid serum concentration in the latter group. It has become common in China, Polynesia and urban sub-Saharan Africa. Some studies found that attacks of gout occur more frequently in the spring. This {{has been attributed to}} seasonal changes in diet, alcohol consumption, physical activity and temperature.|$|E
50|$|Roughly 13 {{percent of}} the {{transgender}} community reports having participated in the sex industry, {{according to data from}} the National Transgender Discrimination Survey. Transgender women and other transfeminine individuals are <b>twice</b> <b>as</b> more <b>likely</b> to participate in the sex trade than transmasculine people, but transgender men and transmasculine people compromise about a quarter of all transgender sex workers. These statistics reveal that more transmasculine people participate in the sex industry more than previously expected, especially given that many of the resources and discussions about transgender sex workers focus primarily on transgender women. Other statistics such as lack of family support, job loss due to being transgender, and homelessness were higher among transgender people who had participated in the sex trade compared to those who had not.|$|R
30|$|As {{shown in}} Figure  7, those {{unemployed}} {{for more than}} six months are about half <b>as</b> <b>likely</b> to find a job as those who have been unemployed for less than six months. Yet, the share of long-term unemployed increased sharply during the Great Recession and remains <b>twice</b> <b>as</b> high as before the recession.|$|R
5000|$|Gender is {{correlated}} with the prevalence of certain mental disorders, including depression, anxiety and somatic complaints. Major depression is <b>twice</b> <b>as</b> common in women. The lifetime prevalence rate of alcohol dependence is more than <b>twice</b> <b>as</b> high in men, and men are {{more than three times}} <b>as</b> <b>likely</b> to be diagnosed with antisocial personality disorder. [...] There are no marked gender differences in the diagnosis rates of disorders like schizophrenia and bipolar disorder.|$|R
5|$|The {{deaths of}} {{brothers}} Christopher Arepa and Cru Omeka Kahui (20 March 2006 – 18 June 2006), two New Zealand infants from a Māori family {{who died in}} Auckland's Starship Children's Hospital after being admitted with serious head injuries, highlighted the fact that Māori children are more than <b>twice</b> <b>as</b> <b>likely</b> to die {{as a result of}} abuse than non-Māori and that New Zealand ranks fifth highest among OECD nations for child deaths due to maltreatment according to a 2003 UNICEF report.|$|E
5|$|Based on {{combined}} {{data from}} SAMHSA's 2004–2005 National Surveys on Drug Use & Health, {{the rate of}} past-year alcohol dependence or abuse among persons aged 12 or older varied by level of alcohol use: 44.7% of past month heavy drinkers, 18.5% binge drinkers, 3.8% past month non-binge drinkers, and 1.3% {{of those who did}} not drink alcohol in the past month met the criteria for alcohol dependence or abuse in the past year. Males had higher rates than females for all measures of drinking in the past month: any alcohol use (57.5% vs. 45%), binge drinking (30.8% vs. 15.1%), and heavy alcohol use (10.5% vs. 3.3%), and males were <b>twice</b> <b>as</b> <b>likely</b> as females to have met the criteria for alcohol dependence or abuse in the past year (10.5% vs. 5.1%).|$|E
5|$|Rotavirus A, which {{accounts}} for more than 90% of rotavirus gastroenteritis in humans, is endemic worldwide. Each year rotavirus causes millions of cases of diarrhoea in developing countries, almost 2million of which result in hospitalisation. In 2013, an estimated 215,000 children younger than five died from rotavirus, 90 percent of whom were in developing countries. Almost every child has been infected with rotavirus by age five. Rotavirus is the leading single cause of severe diarrhoea among infants and children, is responsible for {{about a third of the}} cases requiring hospitalisation, and causes 37% of deaths attributable to diarrhoea and 5% of all deaths in children younger than five. Boys are <b>twice</b> <b>as</b> <b>likely</b> as girls to be admitted to hospital for rotavirus.|$|E
50|$|In 2001 Bangladeshis had {{the highest}} rates of {{illnesses}} in the UK of any ethnic group. They were more likely to suffer from medical conditions, fevers and headaches. The men were three times <b>as</b> <b>likely</b> to visit their doctor than men in the general population. The age-standardised rates for both genders of Bangladeshis were <b>twice</b> <b>as</b> large as the White British. And taking account of the different structures of age groups, Bangladeshis also {{had the highest}} rates of people with disabilities.|$|R

I never see him without a skirmish, as you know, and yet I'm fond of him. But I should be <b>twice</b> <b>as</b> fond, and half <b>as</b> <b>likely</b> to skirmish, if he'd drop the habits of authority. Then I believe he'd have some real {{influence}} over me; there's something beautiful about him, I know that quite well." ...|$|R

5|$|Further complicating {{this picture}} are {{repetition}} patterns. There {{are two types}} of repetition in Rapanui words: double syllables within roots, as in mamari, and grammatical reduplication of disyllables, as seen in rongorongo. In the Rapanui lexicon, double syllables as in mamari are 50% more likely than chance can explain. However, in the rongorongo texts, analogous double AA glyphs are only 8% more likely than chance. Similarly, in the Rapanui lexicon reduplicated disyllables such as rongorongo are seven times as common as chance, constituting a quarter of the vocabulary, whereas, in rongorongo texts, ABAB sequences are only <b>twice</b> <b>as</b> <b>likely</b> as chance, and 10% of the vocabulary. If rongorongo is a phonetic script, therefore, this discrepancy needs to be explained. Pozdniakov suggests that perhaps there was a 'reduplicator' glyph, or that modifications of glyphs, such as facing heads to the left rather than to the right, may have indicated repetition.|$|E
25|$|Current {{research}} shows that tobacco smokers who are exposed to residential radon are <b>twice</b> <b>as</b> <b>likely</b> to develop lung cancer as non-smokers.

25|$|The {{data show}} that the Kohanim were more than <b>twice</b> <b>as</b> <b>likely</b> to belong to Haplogroup J than the average non-Cohen Jew. Of those who did belong to Haplogroup J, the Kohanim were more than <b>twice</b> <b>as</b> <b>likely</b> to have an STR pattern close to the CMH-6, {{suggesting}} a much more recent common ancestry {{for most of them}} compared to an average non-Kohen Jew of Haplogroup J.|$|E
50|$|Note that, in this decision, Experience, {{the highest}} ranked Criterion, is about <b>twice</b> <b>as</b> {{important}} in reaching the goal as the second-highest ranked Criterion, Charisma.

50|$|It {{has been}} seen that general {{educators}} provide 98.7% of their teaching time doing whole class interactions. Students with disabilities {{have been known to}} require a significant more amount of individual attention with the classroom teacher. Children with disabilities spend <b>twice</b> <b>as</b> much time in whole-class activities as in one-to-one activities due to the amount of whole-class teaching, yet these students are half <b>as</b> <b>likely</b> to engage in whole-class learning activities such as writing, reading and participating showing that whole group activities do not address the needs of students with disabilities as much as individual work would.|$|R
