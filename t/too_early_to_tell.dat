5|$|Development of the {{sandwich}} began in 2001 {{in response to}} several major factors. After an overall sales decline of 17% coupled with a profit decline of 29%, Burger King {{held a series of}} consumer tests that showed the company's customer base was looking for a wider variety of options when making purchases. Additional survey results revealed that a lack of newer products was discouraging consumers from visiting the chain. Furthermore, the company was seeking to counter the threat to its sales by newer fast casual restaurants that had begun to bite into sales. By July 2002, the chain had sold nearly fifty million of {{the sandwich}}es, eventually displacing the BK Broiler's initial launch figures as the company's best selling product introduction. The successful introduction of the Chicken Whopper {{was one of the few}} noted positive highlights of the company during negotiations for the sale of Burger King by its owner Diageo to a group of investors led by the TPG Capital; Chicago-based consulting firm Technomic Inc. president Ron Paul was quoted that he was encouraged by recent product changes at Burger King such as the new Chicken Whopper, but he said it's <b>too</b> <b>early</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> whether the changes have been successful. Despite the Chicken Whopper's initial success, just over a year after the Chicken Whopper's introduction enthusiasm for the product was waning; Burger King's largest franchisee, Carrols Corporation, was complaining that the product line was a failure, describing the sandwich as a pedestrian product with a great name. As of November 2013, the Chicken Whopper is the current grilled chicken sandwich sold by Burger King in the Middle East.|$|E

500|$|A {{mandatory}} three-day mini-camp {{was held}} in early May. Hines Ward, Aaron Smith and Troy Polamalu attended the camp, but did not fully participate because of injuries. First round draft pick, Rashard Mendenhall was welcomed by Steelers current running back Willie Parker. Parker was [...] "surprised" [...] {{when he heard a}} running back was selected in the first round, but hoped to work with Mendenhall like Jerome Bettis worked with Parker during his rookie season. During the mini-camp, the offense experimented with formations using Parker and Mendenhall in the backfield simultaneously. Receiver Hines Ward took a similar approach to Parker's in welcoming second round draft pick Limas Sweed. As with other receivers in the past, Ward was [...] "very hands-on with Sweed throughout the weekend". Coach Mike Tomlin called the new draft picks [...] "humble", adding that he liked their [...] "spirit and attitude"; however, it was <b>too</b> <b>early</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> how well they will ultimately perform.|$|E

40|$|Fusion {{power has}} the {{potential}} to produce clean and safe energy that can contribute significantly to the worlds energy system. The road to this promising energy resource has been long, but with one of the biggest projects in the scientific area that is now on going, a fusion project called ITER, {{the end of the road}} is ahead of us. Experiments with a new reactor wall are now in progress at the fusion test reactor JET in Oxford, England.   The experiment is a pre study of a possible reactor wall for the new fusion reactor ITER in Cadarache in Provence-Alpes-Côte-d'Azur, France. The ITER like reactor wall (ILW) contains Beryllium and has theoretically favourable properties for achieving better reactor conditions, compared to the old Carbon based wall (CW). One reason for changing the wall is to decrease the fuel dilution, i. e. amount of particles that the reactor wall contributes to the fusion plasma. This is an important factor to minimize; 1 % of fuel dilution with Carbon will cause a loss in power up to 12 %, while the corresponding value for Beryllium is 8 %. For Deuterium fuelled plasmas at JET, the fuel dilution can be quantified by the ratio of the Deuterium and electron densities, nd/ne. In this work, nd/ne is estimated using data from the neutron emission spectrometer TOFOR, along with measurements of the electron density (ne) and temperature (Te). In this report it is investigated how sensitive these fuel dilution measurements are to uncertainties in the measurements of ne and Te. The fuel dilution measurements changed relatively in a span of 10 % to 23 % when changing Te and ne with 10 % in the fuel dilution model. To determine the differences in fuel dilution between the Carbon and ITER like reactor wall, a comparison has to be made between the old reactor wall and the new ILW. To do this, similar plasma scenarios need to be represented during fusion discharges with both walls. In this report, JET’s database is searched through using different search criteria, in order to enable a fair comparison between the walls. The comparison showed a tendency of lower fuel dilution, i. e. cleaner plasmas, for discharges with the ILW, but the data points are quite scattered and the ILW discharges have, in general, a lower temperature than the CW discharges, which makes the comparison difficult. Therefore, it is <b>too</b> <b>early</b> <b>to</b> definitely <b>tell</b> anything about a possible improvement of the fuel dilution levels after the installation of the ILW...|$|R
