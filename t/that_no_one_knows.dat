500|$|The story, {{told from}} an unnamed third-person narrator, {{takes place in}} Hungary at an {{unspecified}} date. The opening passages describe a centuries-long rivalry between two wealthy families: the Metzengersteins and the Berlifitzings. The bitter enmity between the two families is so old <b>that</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>knows</b> how far back it dates. The narrator states that its origin appears to rely on an [...] "ancient" [...] prophecy: [...] "A lofty name shall have a fearful fall when, as the rider over his horse, the mortality of Metzengerstein shall triumph over the immortality of Berlifitzing." ...|$|E

The NAP-CHT also says that women and girls {{are the most common}} victims of human trafficking. Randy Hoback, MP for Prince Albert, Saskatchewan, said that the goals of the action plan included [...] "enhancing the response of law enforcement and the justice system to cases of missing and murdered Aboriginal women and girls and supporting culturally appropriate victim's services." [...] The NAP-CHT document states that there had been 25 human-trafficking-specific convictions in Canada prior to April 2012, and that 41 people had been victims of those 25 crimes.|$|E

[...] Jon Wertheim wrote in Sports Illustrated 100 years after the event, [...] "The statistics for the Detroit players had been crossed out and nullified. Every Detroit player, that is, except one: Ty Cobb. It takes something less than a detective {{to arrive at the}} conclusion that at some point Johnson (or someone in the league office, anyway) realized the error and decided to conceal it." ...|$|E

500|$|Otis Phillips Lord, {{an elderly}} {{judge on the}} Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court from Salem, in 1872 or 1873 became an {{acquaintance}} of Dickinson's. After the death of Lord's wife in 1877, his friendship with Dickinson probably became a late-life romance, though as their letters were destroyed, this is surmised. Dickinson found a kindred soul in Lord, {{especially in terms of}} shared literary interests; the few letters which survived contain multiple quotations of Shakespeare's work, including the plays Othello, Antony and Cleopatra, Hamlet and King Lear. In 1880 he gave her Cowden Clarke's Complete Concordance to Shakespeare (1877). Dickinson wrote that [...] "While others go to Church, I go to mine, for are you not my Church, and have we not a Hymn <b>that</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>knows</b> but us?" [...] She referred to him as [...] "My lovely Salem" [...] and they wrote to each other religiously every Sunday. Dickinson looked forward to this day greatly; a surviving fragment of a letter written by her states that [...] "Tuesday is a deeply depressed Day".|$|E
500|$|The {{fact that}} the novel's title character, the President, is never named gives him a mythological dimension, rather than the {{personality}} of a specific Guatemalan dictator. Literary scholar Kevin Bauman notes that readers are not let {{into the mind of}} the President; instead his appearance is [...] "continually re-evaluated, re-defined, and, ultimately, re-constructed according to his perception by others, similar to Asturias's own novelistic (re)vision of Estrada Cabrera's regime". According to literary critic Hughes Davies, the President [...] "represents political corruption but his presentation as an evil deity who is worshiped in terms that mockingly echo religious ritual elevates him to a mythical plane" [...] and he is [...] "an inverted image of both the Christian and Mayan deities since he is the source only of death". The dictator also has an element of mystery about himit seems <b>that</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>knows</b> where he is because he occupies several houses {{on the outskirts of the}} town. Mystery also surrounds the questions of when and how he sleeps. In the novel, rumors abound that he sleeps beside the telephone with a whip in his hand while others claim that he never sleeps at all.|$|E
500|$|Meeting with Mulder and Scully, Shannon tearfully {{tells them}} that Ausbury {{and the other}} Satanists {{repeatedly}} raped and impregnated her {{as part of their}} rituals, sacrificing her babies. When the agents confront Ausbury with the accusations, he is shocked, and denies them. Shannon stays after school to make up her assignment of dissecting the pig. Mrs. Paddock takes her bracelet and uses it as part of a spell that causes Shannon to slit her wrists. When Ausbury learns that the other faculty members plan to use Shannon as a scapegoat, he admits the sect's existence to Mulder. He confirms that rituals did happen while Shannon was present, but said that exposure to sensational media coverage led her to [...] "remember" [...] the sexual abuse. Meanwhile, Scully researches Mrs. Paddock and finds <b>that</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>knows</b> anything about her or her background. During a sudden power outage, Mrs. Paddock steals Scully's pen and uses it to impersonate her in a call to Mulder, pretending to be in trouble. Mulder handcuffs Ausbury in the basement to prevent his possible escape, then leaves to help Scully. Soon after, a giant snake appears, controlled by Mrs. Paddock, and devours Ausbury.|$|E

500|$|Madonna {{released}} her eighth studio album, Music, in September 2000. It featured elements from the electronica-inspired Ray of Light era, and like its predecessor, received acclaim from critics. Collaborating with French producer Mirwais Ahmadzaï, Madonna commented: [...] "I love {{to work with}} the weirdos <b>that</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>knows</b> about—the people who have raw talent and who are making music unlike anyone else out there. Music is the future of sound." [...] Stephen Thomas Erlewine from AllMusic felt that [...] "Music blows by in a kaleidoscopic rush of color, technique, style and substance. It has so many depth and layers that it's easily as self-aware and earnest as Ray of Light." [...] The album took the number-one position in more than 20 countries worldwide and sold four million copies in the first ten days. In the U.S., Music debuted at the top, and became her first number-one album in eleven years since Like a Prayer. It produced three singles: the Hot 100 number-one [...] "Music", [...] "Don't Tell Me", and [...] "What It Feels Like for a Girl". The music video of [...] "What It Feels Like for a Girl" [...] depicted Madonna committing acts of crime and vandalism, and was banned by MTV and VH1.|$|E
500|$|By {{the end of}} the leg, {{the band}} members were having trouble {{adjusting}} to their newfound fame as virtually every concert on the tour was sold out and Mother's Milk approached 500,000 units sold. Spin reported that following a show in Atlanta, Flea invited a woman to his hotel room for sexual intercourse, but locked himself in the bathroom upon arriving because all he could think of were his wife and daughter. Kiedis ended a two-year long relationship with actress Ione Skye, and Frusciante, looking back on the tour years later, admitted, [...] "I was totally abusing the situation [...] partying and screwing a bunch of girls. At 19, I might have looked like a stud but I was a weakling inside. I wasn't proud of who I was then." [...] Shortly before {{the end of the}} North American leg, the band filmed a performance at the Long Beach Arena, which was released as Psychedelic Sexfunk Live from Heaven in 1990. A concert at the San Francisco Civic Auditorium on New Year's Eve 1989 attracted over 10,000 attendees and was considered by band photographer Tony Woolliscroft to be [...] "the biggest [...] I had seen them play at that point. It gave me a handle on how hard the band had worked in the USA in the years prior to this." [...] The tour continued in the United Kingdom, where the band was receiving less attention; Kiedis complained after several shows there, [...] "We're huge in the States and it's sort of frustrating and confusing <b>that</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>knows</b> who we are here." [...] It was not until after their return from the UK that [...] "Taste the Pain" [...] was released as a single and subsequently charted at number twenty-nine there. In March 1990, the band was asked to perform on MTV's coverage of Spring break in Florida. At the event, Flea and Smith attempted to engage the audience by jumping from the stage; the situation got out of hand, and the two were alleged to have sexually assaulted and verbally abused a female audience member. They were arrested several days later on charges of battery, disorderly conduct and solicitation to commit a lascivious act, but released on $2,000 bail. Smith and Flea's arrest worsened Kiedis' impending charge in Virginia from the [...] "Positive Mental Octopus" [...] tour, for which the vocalist was ultimately convicted of sexual battery and indecent exposure and sentenced to pay a fine of $1,000 per charge.|$|E

[...] Jeffrey {{is a man}} [...] "of strict integrity ... is firm without violence, friendly without weakness—a critic and even-tempered, a casuist and an honest man—and amidst the toils of his profession and the distractions of the world, retains the gaiety, the unpretending carelessness and simplicity of youth."

2500|$|Deuteronomy is {{a series}} of speeches by Moses on the plains of Moab {{opposite}} Jericho. Also referred to as Mishneh Torah in Hebrew (a repeat of the Torah) the essential gist of the entire book is a rebuke to the Children of Israel to not worship idolatry, to not follow in the ways of Cana'an, and to cleave to God. Moses proclaims the Law (Deuteronomy 12–26), gives instruction concerning covenant renewal at Shechem (Deuteronomy 27–28) and gives Israel new laws (the [...] "Deuteronomic Code"). At {{the end of the book}} (Deuteronomy 34) Moses is allowed to see the promised land from a mountain, and then dies. The text emphasises <b>that</b> <b>no</b> <b>one</b> <b>knows</b> where Moses was finally buried (34:6).

2500|$|In the {{following}} weeks, Murphy became enveloped with the incident {{and wrote a}} radio documentary called Object in the Woods, featuring his experiences and interviews he had conducted that night. Shortly before the documentary would have aired, he received an unexpected visit at the station from two men in black suits identifying themselves as government officials.

A week after the visit, an agitated Murphy aired a censored version of the documentary, which he claimed in its introduction had to be edited due to some interviewees requesting their statements be removed from the broadcast in fear of getting in trouble with the police and Army. The new version contained nothing revealing, and did not mention an object at all.
