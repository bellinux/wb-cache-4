5|$|Before 2009, members {{received}} the same salary as members of their national parliament. However, from 2009 a new members statute came into force, after years of attempts, which gave all members an equal monthly pay, of 8,020.53 euro each in 2014, subject to a European Union tax and which can also be taxed nationally. MEPs {{are entitled to a}} pension, paid by Parliament, from the age of 63. Members are also entitled to allowances for office costs and subsistence, and travelling expenses, based on actual cost. Besides their pay, members are granted a number of privileges and immunities. To ensure their free movement to and from the Parliament, they are accorded by their own states the facilities accorded to senior officials travelling abroad and, by other state governments, the status of visiting foreign representatives. When in their own state, <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> immunities accorded to national parliamentarians, and, in other states, they have immunity from detention and legal proceedings. However, immunity cannot be claimed when a member is found committing a criminal offence and the Parliament also has the right to strip a member of their immunity.|$|E

Like insulin, it is administered by subcutaneous injection. The most frequent and severe adverse effect of pramlintide is nausea, which occurs mostly {{at the beginning of}} treatment and gradually reduces. Typical reductions in A1C values are 0.5–1.0%.|$|E
25|$|Interestingly, if 0# {{holds in}} V, {{then there is}} a closed {{unbounded}} class of ordinals that are indiscernible in L. While some of these are not even initial ordinals in V, <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> large cardinal properties weaker than 0# in L. Furthermore, any strictly increasing class function from the class of indiscernibles to itself can be extended in a unique way to an elementary embedding of L into L. This gives L a nice structure of repeating segments.|$|E

60|$|The {{largest of}} the polar bears was all of eight feet long, and {{correspondingly}} heavy. To lift him on the sledge was no easy task, and with the others, <b>the</b> hunters found <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> game the dogs could drag over the ice and snow.|$|R
500|$|.....We felt {{because it}} was 20 years earlier, these are much younger Spartans. They aren't quite as {{experienced}} as Master Chief, and we looked a lot at combat infantry going into actual wars, and typically {{at the beginning of}} a war, especially the Vietnam War, if you look at the infantry, they're all loaded up. <b>They</b> <b>have</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> backpacks on, <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> belts on, every single bit of armor is there, and they're carrying around lots of armor. At the end of the war, they've lost it all and just carry what they need. This is all they have. So if you look at our Spartans, they have more pieces of armor on going into the war. They have more markings on there, more pieces of armor. They've still got the belts on, they're still carrying around everything.|$|E
500|$|Schur {{said of the}} episode's plot, [...] "They're very {{confused}} because in Venezuela the government is so powerful; their parks department travels with military escorts and motorcades and stuff. <b>They</b> <b>have</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> {{money in the world}} because of their oil and they (don't understand) why Pawnee's parks department is so rinky-dink." [...] A fan of Parks and Recreation since its inception, Armisen said he laughed as soon as he read the script, and found it even funnier during the table read with the cast. After working with Armisen, Rashida Jones described him as [...] "one of the funniest people on the planet".|$|E
500|$|As an {{openly gay}} man {{throughout}} his career, Sylvester {{came to be}} seen as a spokesman for the gay community. He informed a journalist that [...] "I realize that gay people have put me on a pedestal and I love it. After all, of all the oppressed minorities, they just have to be the most oppressed. <b>They</b> <b>have</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> hassles of finding something or someone to identify with [...] and they chose me. I like being around gay people and they've proven to be some of my closest friends and most loyal audiences." [...] Elsewhere, he nevertheless remarked that he felt his career had [...] "transcended the gay movement. I mean, my sexuality has nothing to do with my music. When I'm fucking I'm not thinking about singing and vice versa." [...] He was openly critical of what he perceived as divisive tendencies within the gay community itself, noting that [...] "I get this conformist shit from queens all the time. They always want to read me. They always want me to do it their way. I am not going to conform to the gay lifestyle as they see it and that's for sure". He was particularly critical of [...] "clones" [...] gay men who dressed alike with boots, boot-cut jeans, checked shirts and handlebar mustaches [...] stating that all too often they judged those gay people who were flamboyant or extravagant.|$|E

50|$|In the 1950s vedettes of Cuban origin appeared, like Blanquita Amaro Amelia Vargas and Rosita Fornés. <b>They</b> <b>had</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> glitz, {{grace and}} glamor that {{characterized}} the era, and shared the stage with local stars like Nélida Roca.|$|R

60|$|But {{the dogs}} were observant, and {{suddenly}} they stopped, turning their heads and looking back at their master out of eyes that were wistful and questioning.

6000|$|... "I mean to go {{to prison}} {{directly}} the session is over," [...] said Miss Klegg. [...] "Wild horses--not if <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> mounted police in London--shan't keep me out." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Well, I will!" [...] she said, and {{the shadow}} lifted itself from their wedding feast, and {{they sat down}} and made merry as if <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> {{money in the world}} to spend.

5000|$|Morrison {{explains}} {{the song in}} Q Magazine as: [...] "The song is about when people used to sing on the streets: It came from America, where <b>they</b> <b>had</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> doo-wop groups.
