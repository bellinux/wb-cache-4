40|$|AbstractThis paper {{deals with}} two possibilities, which enable the {{investigation}} of the machining quality of parts made of fibre reinforced polymers. Finishing operations like milling or drilling are necessary in actual production processes. Such operations mostly cause damages like fraying, delamination or splintering at the machining surface. The one dimensional maximum method and the <b>three</b> <b>dimensional</b> damage <b>analysis</b> are two tools, which allow a reliable comparison between different experiments with, for example, varied process parameters. Therefore the one dimensional maximum method (1 D-MM) only needs a calliper or microscope with measuring feature and can be accomplished in nearly every environment. The <b>three</b> <b>dimensional</b> damage <b>analysis</b> (3 D-DA) requires high end measuring equipment but provides more information. Both procedures distinguish the occurring damages in fraying, delamination and splintering, what enables the optimized enhancement of the process. Such measurement methods are the necessary basis for every development or investigation in this field and should be understood as an approach for standardization...|$|R

40|$|Objectives: Traditional {{methods of}} {{assessing}} joint {{range of motion}} (ROM) involve specialized tools {{that may not be}} widely available to clinicians. This study assesses {{the reliability and validity of}} a custom Smartphone application for assessing hip joint range of motion. Design: Intra-tester reliability with concurrent validity. Methods: Passive hip joint range of motion was recorded for seven different movements in 20 males on two separate occasions. Data from a Smartphone, bubble inclinometer and a <b>three</b> <b>dimensional</b> motion <b>analysis</b> (3 DMA) system were collected simultaneously. Intraclass correlation coefficients (ICCs), coefficients of variation (CV) and standard error of measurement (SEM) were used to assess reliability. To assess validity of the Smartphone application and the bubble inclinometer against the <b>three</b> <b>dimensional</b> motion <b>analysis</b> system, intraclass correlation coefficients and fixed and proportional biases were used. Results: The Smartphone demonstrated good to excellent reliability (ICCs. >. 0. 75) for four out of the seven movements, and moderate to good reliability for the remaining three movements (ICC. =. 0. 63 - 0. 68). Additionally, the Smartphone application displayed comparable reliability to the bubble inclinometer. The Smartphone application displayed excellent validity when compared to the <b>three</b> <b>dimensional</b> motion <b>analysis</b> system for all movements (ICCs. >. 0. 88) except one, which displayed moderate to good validity (ICC. =. 0. 71). Conclusions: Smartphones are portable and widely available tools that are mostly reliable and valid for assessing passive hip range of motion, with potential for large-scale use when a bubble inclinometer is not available. However, caution must be taken in its implementation as some movement axes demonstrated only moderate reliability. © 2014 Sports Medicine Australia...|$|R
