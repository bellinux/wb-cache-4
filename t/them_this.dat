5|$|Autolink has {{traditionally}} owned a large pool of autoracks. These have been {{operated by the}} Norwegian State Railways, and subsequently their subsidiary CargoNet. On 31 January 2007, Autolink bought 40% of the private railway company Ofotbanen, {{and at the same}} time signed a haulage contract with <b>them.</b> <b>This</b> made Autolink Ofotbanen's largest customer, and second largest owner. In March, Autolink ordered additional 70new autoracks for NOK175 million.|$|E
5|$|Besides {{the legal}} {{services}} rendered by Don Felipe to the impoverished, Agoncillo {{and her daughters}} observed every Thursday as a day of charity, when a queue of needy people seeking alms would form in the Agoncillo driveway. No one ever left their house empty-handed. Agoncillo would hand them a bag of rice {{in addition to the}} money she gave <b>them.</b> <b>This</b> practice lasted until the couple retired.|$|E
5|$|Colbert {{received}} a chilly reception from the audience. His jokes were often met with silence and muttering, although {{some in the}} audience, such as Scalia, laughed heartily as Colbert teased <b>them.</b> <b>This</b> was {{in stark contrast to}} the warm reception accorded to a skit featuring Bush and his look-alike, Steve Bridges, which immediately preceded Colbert's monologue.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{shall see}} <b>'em</b> <b>this</b> {{afternoon}} an' {{now that the}} business of the land is settled, will advise them to take a little pleasure trip." ...|$|R

60|$|Both {{excellent}} {{stories and}} perfectly new. Your Joe swears {{that he never}} heard either--never a word or syllable of either--after he laughed at <b>'em</b> <b>this</b> blessed day.|$|R
5|$|Guinea pigs also {{practice}} alloparental care, {{in which}} a female may adopt the pup or pups of another. This might take place if the original parents die or are for some reason separated from <b>them.</b> <b>This</b> behavior is common, and is seen in many other animal species such as the elephant.|$|E
5|$|However, {{some members}} of the Indian freedom {{struggle}} such as Nehru felt that Sastri was too sympathetic to the British rulers, and too co-operative with <b>them.</b> <b>This</b> was especially apparent at the Round table conferences where Sastri and his party member agreed to the unfair proposals of the British.|$|E
5|$|In 2006, the {{majority}} Labor government made sweeping {{changes to the}} education system, shutting down 23 schools across the territory. These {{were made in the}} face of sustained public opposition, and since then, there have been campaigns from opposition parties and the community to re-open some of <b>them.</b> <b>This</b> included the 2008 election, where it was a major topic.|$|E
6000|$|... "We had a slat of hot roasted {{ones with}} nice butter on <b>'em,</b> <b>this</b> mornin'," [...] Plums continued, {{as if it}} were his purpose to {{increase}} the detective's hunger.|$|R
6000|$|... "I reckon they're goin' {{to bring}} their siege-guns with <b>'em</b> <b>this</b> time. It looks to me much as if a big crowd was gatherin' {{in the rear of}} the line." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I'll read <b>'em</b> <b>this</b> very night, Mr. Crewe," [...] he said solemnly; [...] "this {{meeting you}} is a {{particular}} pleasure, and I have heard in many quarters of these measures." ...|$|R
5|$|Military members {{adjusting}} to Loring had many facilities available to <b>them.</b> <b>This</b> included the Family Service Center, the Family Services Lending Closet, and the Corey Center.|$|E
5|$|Since Johor {{could not}} have ceded Singapore island and the islets in its {{vicinity}} to the British if it lacked title to <b>them,</b> <b>this</b> was evidence that the United Kingdom recognised the prior and continuing sovereignty of the Johor Sultanate over all islands {{in and around the}} Singapore Strait.|$|E
5|$|Stafford blames Arab nationalists, most {{prominently}} Rashid Ali al-Gaylani and Bakr Sidqi. According to him, Iraqi Army officers despised the Assyrians, and Sidqi {{in particular was}} vocal of his hate for <b>them.</b> <b>This</b> view was also shared by British officials who recommended to Faysal not {{to send him to}} the north during the crisis.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh," [...] I said. That was all. Why shouldn't {{they put}} <b>them</b> up <b>this</b> year? I didn't care if they'd put <b>them</b> up <b>this</b> year or a {{thousand}} years ago.|$|R
6000|$|... "Ate 'em up!" [...] Shorty screamed. [...] "A whole sack! An' them geezers dyin' {{for want}} of <b>'em!</b> <b>This</b> for you! An' this! An' this! An' this! You swine! You hog!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Boys! Did {{they play}} a joke on yer? They wouldn't be above it, sir--they are as full of <b>'em</b> <b>this</b> term as ever, sir. How did you git out o' the building--down that rope?" ...|$|R
5|$|The Lord Nelsons were {{notoriously}} {{difficult for}} inexperienced crews to fire properly, {{due to their}} long firebox, and specific crews who had proven experience in firing the locomotives were therefore allocated to <b>them.</b> <b>This</b> {{was due to the}} relatively few locomotives in the class for crews to train on. The LMS Royal Scot Class was loosely based on this design.|$|E
5|$|The Southern Railway {{continued}} its 1923 naming policy for express passenger locomotives with this class. As several public schools were {{located on the}} Southern Railway network, the locomotives were named after <b>them.</b> <b>This</b> was another marketing success for both railway and schools concerned, continuing {{in the tradition of}} the N15 King Arthur and Lord Nelson classes.|$|E
5|$|The Student and Instructor {{models were}} also {{introduced}} in the late 1960s. They were designed to teach the piano in the classroom. By connecting the output {{of a network of}} student models, the teacher could listen to each student in isolation on the instructor model, and send an audio backing track to <b>them.</b> <b>This</b> allowed the teacher to monitor individual students' progress.|$|E
6000|$|... "'Yes, sir, we've shook {{on the lot}} of <b>'em</b> <b>this</b> time,' said old Joe Clarke. 'If we {{get this}} fox it's worth while 'aving 'im skinned an' stuffed, for 'e's a curiosity 'e is.' ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Wyandotté know so. When did red warriors ever {{travel on}} their path like hogs in drove? One red-man there, as Great Spirit make him; {{by his side}} two red-men as paint make <b>'em.</b> <b>This</b> soon told on trail." ...|$|R
5|$|The {{film was}} an early example of efforts to move beyond theater {{blocking}} conventions. During the police raid, depth was demonstrated by having action take place in both the foreground and the background, and by allowing actors to move between <b>them.</b> <b>This</b> cinematography technique improved the realism and pacing of the scene.|$|E
5|$|Thrips develop {{resistance}} to insecticides easily {{and there is}} constant research on how to control <b>them.</b> <b>This</b> makes thrips ideal as models for testing the effectiveness of new pesticides and methods.|$|E
5|$|After Burebista's death, {{the empire}} {{he had created}} {{dissolved}} into smaller kingdoms. From the reign of Tiberius to Domitian, Dacian activity was reduced into a defensive state. The Romans abandoned plans of mounting an invasion against Dacia. In 86 AD, however, the king Decebalus successfully re-united the Dacian kingdom under his control. Domitian attempted a hasty invasion against the Dacians which ended in disaster. A second invasion later brought peace between Rome and Dacia for nearly a decade, until in 98 AD Trajan became emperor. Trajan also pursued two conquests of Dacia, the first in 101–102 AD which concluded in a Roman victory. Decebalus was forced to agree to harsh terms of peace, but did not honour <b>them.</b> <b>This</b> sparked a second invasion of Dacia in 106 AD which ended {{the independence of the}} Dacian kingdom, and brought about its break-up.|$|E
6000|$|... 'I expect so. We mostly do--even when we're grown. But bein' Frankie, he took {{good care}} {{to find out}} {{beforehand}} what his fortune might be. Had I rightly ought to tell <b>'em</b> <b>this</b> piece?' Simon turned to Puck, who nodded.|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't see why I am keeping {{these old}} slippers," [...] he murmured, half to himself. [...] "I haven't worn <b>'em</b> <b>this</b> term. Guess I'll turn 'em over to Pop Swingly. He {{might get a}} little good out of 'em." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Can't {{say about}} that," [...] said Mike, {{shaking his head}} a little. [...] "I 'spects we'll git good 'nough craps for what we do for <b>'em.</b> <b>This</b> ain't the kind of farm your lords and ladies has got. It's ramshackle, you know." ...|$|R
5|$|After all, {{young people}} are always searching for the beauty in love. They want their love to be beautiful. If they give in to weakness, {{following}} the models of behavior that can rightly be considered a 'scandal in the contemporary world' (and these are, unfortunately, widely diffused models), {{in the depths of}} their hearts they still desire a beautiful and pure love. This is as true of boys as it is of girls. Ultimately, they know that only God can give <b>them</b> <b>this</b> love. As a result, they are willing to follow Christ, without caring about the sacrifices this may entail.|$|E
5|$|Agouti {{species are}} one of the few animal groups that can break open the large {{capsules}} of the Brazil nut fruit. Too many seeds are inside to be consumed in one meal, so the agouti carries some off and caches <b>them.</b> <b>This</b> helps dispersal of the seeds as any that the agouti fails to retrieve are distant from the parent tree when they germinate. Other nut-bearing trees tend to bear a glut of fruits in the autumn. These are too numerous to be eaten in one meal and squirrels gather and store the surplus in crevices and hollow trees. In desert regions, seeds are often available only for short periods. The kangaroo rat collects all it can find and stores them in larder chambers in its burrow.|$|E
5|$|Ahmad Karimi-Hakkak of the University of Maryland {{discusses}} how {{one aspect}} of Kiarostami's cinematic style {{is that he is}} able to capture essences of Persian poetry and create poetic imagery within the landscape of his films. In Where Is the Friend's Home? and The Wind Will Carry Us, classical Persian poetry is directly quoted in the film, highlighting the artistic link and intimate connection between <b>them.</b> <b>This</b> in turn reflects on the connection between the past and present, between continuity and change.|$|E
6000|$|... "By no manner o' means; I'll {{eat this}} 'un!" [...] replied the harpooner, commencing {{to eat the}} bad egg with {{apparent}} relish.

5000|$|As the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee {{received}} more publicity and {{presence in the}} media, reporters gave <b>them</b> nicknames. <b>This</b> is how SNCC (pronounced [...] "snick") came to be. One reporter referred to <b>them</b> as <b>this</b> in his article, and from then on, the organization was SNCC.|$|R
2500|$|Most poker authors {{recommend}} a tight-aggressive approach to playing Texas hold <b>'em.</b> <b>This</b> strategy involves playing relatively few hands (tight), but betting and raising often {{with those that}} one does play (aggressive). [...] Although this strategy is often recommended, some professional players successfully employ other strategies as well.|$|R
