5|$|Because he {{was unable}} to afford {{university}} tuition, Truman had <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> <b>going</b> to the costless United States Military Academy at West Point, but he was refused an appointment because of poor eyesight. He enlisted in the Missouri Army National Guard in 1905, serving until 1911 in a Kansas City-based artillery battery and attaining the rank of corporal. At his induction, his eyesight had been an unacceptable 20/50 in the right eye and 20/400 in the left (past the standard for legal blindness). The second time he took the test, he passed by secretly memorizing the eye chart.|$|E
25|$|At {{the end of}} 1873 {{he started}} the {{practice}} of Christianity, when his devotee Shambu Charan Mallik read the Bible to him. Ramakrishna said that for several days he was filled with Christian thoughts and no longer <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> <b>going</b> to the Kali temple. Ramakrishna described a vision in which {{a picture of the}} Madonna and Child became alive and he had a vision in which Jesus merged with his body. In his own room amongst other divine pictures was one of Christ, and he burnt incense before it morning and evening. There was also a picture showing Jesus Christ saving St Peter from drowning in the water.|$|E
25|$|Seven more {{errors in}} nine more chances {{followed}} that day, a debacle that McGraw would not soon forget. After the team opened with no wins in six contests, Kenney {{and the other}} members of the ownership of the team—in the face of attendance that had dwindled to nearly nothing—were forced to overhaul the team. McGraw was given his release from the team, but Kenney also loaned him $70 and wished him luck if he wanted to try to catch on with another squad. McGraw could not bear the <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> <b>going</b> home a failure, as both his father and Mary Goddard had urged him to stay home and take a regular job, instead of chasing his dream of being a ballplayer. McGraw was resolute in his determination to make a name for himself as a professional baseball player, even if that meant struggling along in poverty for a time.|$|E

25|$|Like his renowned British tenor {{predecessors}} Sims Reeves and Edward Lloyd, Coates had a famously protective wife. Moore {{refers to}} Coates' home life as serene, with an adorable spouse, sons and daughters; but he thought, despite Coates's good humour, {{he was not}} a happy person because he {{was too much of a}} worrier. Coates developed financial headaches, too. He wasted a good deal of money in a legal case that he launched against the Performing Right Society, in which he argued that he should not have to pay a royalty to perform music in public which had been brought to him in manuscript, and which therefore, by agreeing to sing it, Coates had encouraged the publishers to publish. He lost the case, and it preyed on his mind and finances for long after, though he refused offers of financial support from other singers. In his last years he <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> <b>going</b> back on the stage and started to slim, but he was seized with anaemia and became permanently confined to bed, frustrated at being unable to assist his country as the Second World War took hold. In July 1940, Gerald Moore presented a half-hour broadcast in tribute to their work together, and received a last letter from him in friendship and gratitude.|$|E
500|$|Judge Green {{was born}} on April 2, 1923 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. His father, Robert Lewis Green, {{had come to the}} United States from St. Thomas island in the U.S. Virgin Islands. Green {{attended}} West Philadelphia High School, graduating in 1941. He initially had [...] "no <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> <b>going</b> to college," [...] intending instead to go immediately to work. [...] From 1941 to 1942 he worked in a Philadelphia restaurant and at a drug manufacturing company. In 1942 he took a job with the United States Army Signal Corps.|$|E
500|$|Early in August, FitzRoy {{discussed}} this position with Beaufort, {{who had a}} scientific network of friends at the University of Cambridge. At Beaufort's request, mathematics lecturer George Peacock wrote from London to Professor John Stevens Henslow about this [...] "rare opportunity for a naturalist", saying that an [...] "offer {{has been made to}} me to recommend a proper person to go out as a naturalist with this expedition", and suggesting the Reverend Leonard Jenyns. Though Jenyns nearly accepted, and even packed his clothes, he had concerns about his obligations as vicar of Swaffham Bulbeck and his health, so declined. Henslow briefly <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> <b>going,</b> but his wife [...] "looked so miserable" [...] that he quickly dropped the idea. Both recommended the 22-year-old Charles Darwin who had just completed the ordinary Bachelor of Arts degree which was a prerequisite for his intended career as a parson, and was on a geology field trip with Adam Sedgwick.|$|E
6000|$|... "A {{treasure}} hunt! Just the thing!" [...] Dick had said, and {{his brothers}} agreed with him. The lads were filled with excitement over the prospect, and {{for the time being}} all <b>thoughts</b> <b>of</b> <b>going</b> to college were thrust aside.|$|R

6000|$|The {{young man}} in {{spectacles}} in the meanwhile retired; Tancred had bowed and murmured his compliments: and his host, drawing his chair a little from the table, continued: 'Lord Eskdale tells me that you have some <b>thoughts</b> <b>of</b> <b>going</b> to Jerusalem.' ...|$|R
2500|$|In {{the early}} days {{settlers}} found at hand a convenient substitute for stone in the hardwoods, and in Sydney sandstone was so plentiful and so easily worked that no one <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> <b>going</b> afield to explore for something better, and even today [...] freestone, as the sandstone is often called, is nearly everywhere employed by architects and builders.|$|E
2500|$|In time Victoria was happiest {{living at}} her remote lodge, writing from Balmoral in 1873 [...] "Felt quite lost in my big sitting room, after the snug little {{one at the}} Glassalt." [...] In 1874 again from Glassalt: [...] "Working, reading & writing, after coming home. Dinner as usual, then Beatrice played on the piano. Cannot bear the <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> <b>going</b> away & not {{returning}} for another year!", and in 1877: [...] "We left with regret the dear little Glassalt Shiel at half past 12. The house at Balmoral felt so cold & large, after the snug warm Shiel." ...|$|E
2500|$|The first rail {{presence}} at the site was in January 1882 when the Lynn & Fakenham Railway began services to King's Lynn. Later in the year, the line to North Walsham was opened (linking King's Lynn with Great Yarmouth). William Marriott noted in his reminiscences that {{he had given up}} on the <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> <b>going</b> to America because he was offered a permanent post and salary to stay with the contractors Messrs Wilkinson & Jarvis. William first visited the works when the foundations had been laid. He also noted the framework for the houses in Melton Street were up. In December 1882 the Norwich line was opened. The growth of this new network was rapid. The buildings are known to have opened in 1883. As a result, the works grew to employ over 1000 people and the village population grew from 118 in 1881 to 1,157 in 1911.|$|E
60|$|February 15.--Rheumatism {{returns with}} the snow. I had <b>thoughts</b> <b>of</b> <b>going</b> to Abbotsford on Saturday, {{but if this}} lasts, it will not do; and, sooth to speak, it ought not to do; though it would do me much {{pleasure}} if it would do.|$|R
60|$|All <b>thoughts</b> <b>of</b> <b>going</b> {{to school}} that morning were {{abandoned}} by the five boys. They talked the situation over, and determined {{to go down the}} road and await the arrival of the constable, Andy Prime having said that Hickson would come by ten o'clock.|$|R
60|$|When {{the train}} {{stopped at the}} next station I had given up all <b>thoughts</b> <b>of</b> <b>going</b> back.

2500|$|In 1551 Philip [...] {{received}} all {{the minor}} orders, and was ordained deacon, and finally priest (on 23 May). He <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> <b>going</b> to India as a missionary, but was dissuaded by his friends who {{saw that there}} was abundant work to be done in Rome. Accordingly, he settled down, with some companions, at the Hospital of San Girolamo della Carità, and while there tentatively began, in 1556, the institute with which his name is more especially connected, that of the Oratory. The scheme at first {{was no more than a}} series of evening meetings in a hall (the Oratory), at which there were prayers, hymns, and readings from Scripture, the church fathers, and the Martyrology, followed by a lecture, or by discussion of some religious question proposed for consideration. The musical selections (settings of scenes from sacred history) were called oratorios. Giovanni Palestrina was one of Philip’s followers, and composed music for the services. The scheme was developed, and the members of the society undertook various kinds of mission work throughout Rome, notably the preaching of sermons in different churches every evening, a completely new idea at that time. He also spent much of his time hearing confessions, and effected many conversions in this way. [...] Philip [...] sometimes led “excursions” to other churches, often with music and a picnic on the way.|$|E
2500|$|The name Pet Sounds was Love's invention, {{according}} to himself, Brian, and Jardine. Brian {{explained that the}} album was named [...] "after the dogs... That was the whole idea", and that the title was a [...] "tribute" [...] to Spector by matching his initials (PS), but could not recall who <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> <b>going</b> to the zoo. Love recounted: [...] "We {{were standing in the}} hallway in one of the recording studios, either Western or Columbia, and we didn't have a title.... We had taken pictures at the zoo and... there were animal sounds on the record, and we were thinking, well, it's our favorite music of that time, so I said, 'Why don't we call it Pet Sounds?'" [...] Brian has also credited Carl for the title, while Carl said with uncertainty that it might have come from Brian: [...] "The idea he [...] had was that everybody has these sounds that they love, and this was a collection of his 'pet sounds.' It was hard to think of a name for the album, because you sure couldn't call it Shut Down Vol. 3.. It was just so much more than a record; it had such a spiritual quality. It wasn't going in and doing another top ten. It had so much more meaning than that." ...|$|E
2500|$|The veteran Garth McKenzie and debutant Alan Thomson {{departed}} from line and length {{with the new}} ball and Geoff Boycott (37) and Brian Luckhurst (74) added 92 for the first wicket. In the increasing gloom Boycott tried to square-cut a long hop from Johnny Gleeson and edged it to Rodney Marsh, providing the keeper with {{the first of his}} 355 victims in Test cricket. Alan Knott came in as nightwatchman and was bounced by Thomson in the poor light, Jack Fingleton claiming that 'He can be excused. he doesn't know where he is bowling.'. In the morning – the first Sunday's play at the Gabba – Knott took his score to 73, joined by John Edrich (79) and Basil d'Oliveira (57) as they slowly batted into the fourth afternoon with the crowd giving them a slow hand-clap. The Monday was a rest day with three and a half inches of rain falling, but the wicket was covered, so there would be no danger of a gluepot as in the 1950–51 Brisbane Test. The following day Colin Cowdrey (28) overtook Wally Hammond's record of 7,249 runs to become the most prolific Test batsmen, which earned him an ovation from the crowd. The [...] "Golden Arm" [...] of Doug Walters was able to both swing the ball and produce line and length to dismiss Knott, take the last two wickets and return figures of 3/12, but the other bowlers suffered; McKenzie 2/90, Thomson 1/136, Gleeson 2/92 and Jenner 1/86. Rod Marsh had been brought in as wicket-keeper because of his superior batting skills and took four catches, but dropped three as he fumbled the ball and was dubbed [...] "Iron Gloves" [...] by the press. England overtook the Australian total to finish with 464, the third highest Test innings without a century at the time, to give them a lead of 31 runs. The Australian selector Neil Harvey commented that Ray Illingworth [...] "gave up any <b>thought</b> <b>of</b> <b>going</b> for a win when he lost the toss", and most of the commentators agreed.|$|E
