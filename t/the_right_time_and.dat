25|$|The {{accuracy}} of the story recounted by Forkel has often been questioned, and indeed may have been embellished by Bach's enthusiastic biographer. However Goldberg {{was known as a}} virtuoso performer at the time, was in the employ of Keyserlingk at <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>time,</b> <b>and</b> was also most likely in Leipzig, based on the similarity of the cantatas he composed to those by Bach; a teacher-student relationship has been suggested by many scholars on the similarity of the cantatas alone.|$|E

25|$|Palmerston {{was a great}} orator. His {{language}} was relatively unstudied and his delivery somewhat embarrassed, but he generally found words to say the right thing at <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>time</b> <b>and</b> to address the House of Commons in the language best adapted to the capacity and the temper of his audience. An attempt {{was made by the}} Duke of Wellington in September 1830 to induce Palmerston to re-enter the cabinet, but he refused to do so without Lord Lansdowne and Lord Grey, two notable Whigs. This can be said to be the point in 1830, when his party allegiance changed.|$|E
25|$|In episode 1, Kat, Alfie and Tommy {{arrive in}} the Irish town of Redwater, where Kat is almost {{immediately}} convinced that Andrew Kelly (Peter Campion) is her son, while Andrew's grandmother, Agnes Byrne (Fionnula Flanagan) is suspicious of her. Alfie warns Kat to wait for <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>time</b> <b>and</b> make friends first, but Kat confides in Agnes's husband, Lance Byrne (Ian McElhinney), that her son was taken away from her in 1983 and she believes he is in Redwater. Lance tells Agnes this, and Agnes immediately says Kat should not be told the truth as it would unravel everything they have built. Kat visits the Byrnes' farm and talks to Andrew about his life, but then Lance warns him to give the Moons a wide berth. Kat then admits to Alfie that she is scared of seeing how disappointed her son would be in her. Lance tells the local priest, Dermott Dolan (Oisín Stack), that Kat is his real mother. It is revealed that Iris Dolan (Orla Hannon) lost a baby in London and brought Dermott back as her own, and her husband, Peter Dolan (Stanley Townsend) does not know the truth. The next day, Dermott murders Lance by drowning him.|$|E

In episode 5, Agnes tells Dermott to keep Kat away from the christening of Bernie Kelly's (Susan Ateh) baby, but Dermott says Kat has made him feel welcome and invited him to meet his {{brothers}} in Spain, so Agnes reveals that Dermott has a twin sister. Dermott confronts Kat over this, {{who said she was}} waiting for <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>time</b> <b>and</b> insists there is nothing else that Dermott does not know. In episode 6, Bernie, a local garda, asks Kat about the last time she saw Lance and Kat wonders if she suspects something happened, but Bernie denies this. Meanwhile, Kat is unaware that Alfie is having an operation on his brain tumour. Alfie asks Dermott to find Kat and bring her to the hospital, as it means they are unable to go back to Spain. Bernie works out that Dermott was involved in Lance's death, and sees him on the beach with Kat. Kat tells Dermott that Bernie was asking about him. He sees the garda arriving so takes Kat in a boat, saying they will try to find the whale that was recently seen off the coast. Bernie shouts at him to stop and calls the coastguard. Kat asks Dermott if he did something to Lance. Dermott then accidentally crashes the boat into a rock and Kat is thrown into the water and then cut by the propellor. Dermott gets Kat out of the sea but there is nobody around to help. Meanwhile, Alfie has his operation but loses his pulse and the medical staff start to resuscitate.|$|E

25|$|Following a brief hiatus, Janet {{returns to}} the team {{as a member of}} the Avengers Unity Squad. In {{addition}} to serving on the roster, she privately funds the team in order to avoid the problems that would come with government sponsorship. During the events of Inhumanity, Janet {{returns to the}} Microverse to rescue a family who has been pulled there through a newly awakened Inhuman's powers. There she confronts Gouzar once more, before returning to normal space. In the Avengers Unity Squad's fight with the Horsemen of Death, the Wasp defeats both the resurrected Banshee and Sentry, utilizing both her ability to grow to giant size as well as her ability to control insect life. After the team is defeated and the Earth destroyed, Wasp is the last surviving human and begins a romance with Havok (Alex Summers) with whom she has a daughter named Katie. Years later on Planet X, she is captured when she and Havok destroy a tachyon dam preventing time travel to their era. They are able to undo the destruction of Earth by forming an alliance with Kang and projecting their minds back into their past selves (physical time-travel still being impossible) but Kang takes their daughter to a place outside of time to 'protect' her from the changes in history, Kang subsequently attempts to use Katie as a hostage to force Havok to stop attacking him when he tries to take the Celestial power for himself, departing with Katie as his prisoner. Although Alex is left disfigured after the battle, he and Janet remain together. They are contacted by Immortus informing them that Immortus can return their daughter to them if they take action at <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>time</b> <b>and</b> place to conceive her, but he also warns them about the imminent threat posed by the Red Skull.|$|E

500|$|Marsden {{found that}} the Kreutz sungrazers could be split into two groups, with {{slightly}} different orbital elements, implying that the family resulted from fragmentations at more than one perihelion.

[...] This meant it was realistic to presume that they were two parts of the same comet which had broken up one orbit ago. [...] By far the best candidate for the progenitor comet was that seen in 1106 (Great Comet of 1106): Ikeya–Seki's derived orbital period gave a previous perihelion almost exactly at <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>time,</b> <b>and</b> while the Great Comet of 1882's derived orbit implied a previous perihelion a few decades later, it would only require a small error in the orbital elements to bring it into agreement.|$|E

500|$|In 1928 Whale {{was offered}} the {{opportunity}} to direct two private performances of R.C. Sherriff's then-unknown play Journey's End for the Incorporated Stage Society, a theatre society that mounted private Sunday performances of plays. Set over a four-day period in March 1918 in the trenches at Saint-Quentin, France, Journey's End gives {{a glimpse into the}} experiences of the officers of a British infantry company in World War I. The key conflict is between Capt. Stanhope, the company commander, and Lt. Raleigh, the brother of Stanhope's fiancée. Whale offered the part of Stanhope to the then barely known Laurence Olivier. Olivier initially declined the role, but after meeting the playwright agreed to take it on. Maurice Evans was cast as Raleigh. The play was well received and transferred to the Savoy Theatre in London's West End, opening on 21 January 1929. A young Colin Clive was now in the lead role, Olivier having accepted an offer {{to take the lead in}} a production of Beau Geste. [...] The play was a tremendous success, with critics uniform and effusive in their praise and with audiences sometimes sitting in stunned silence following its conclusion only to burst into thunderous ovations. As Whale biographer James Curtis wrote, the play [...] "managed to coalesce, at <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>time</b> <b>and</b> in the right manner, the impressions of a whole generation of men who were in the war and who had found it impossible, through words or deeds, to adequately express to their friends and families what the trenches had been like". After three weeks at the Savoy, Journey's End transferred to the Prince of Wales Theatre, where it ran for the next two years.|$|E
