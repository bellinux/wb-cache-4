The coral {{does not need to}} be sterilised when it comes new out of the package, but if I reuse it to form a new culture with different animals from the previous culture, in between the tap water and the salt water washes (see “Setting up”), I sometimes pour boiling water over it to kill off any previous life forms, that I may not want in my new tank.
