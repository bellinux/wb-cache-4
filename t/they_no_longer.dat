5|$|Campbell died in 1971 {{at the age}} of 61 in Mountainside, New Jersey.

5|$|The 42nd Infantry Division Murska and Detachment Ormozki {{were cut}} off north of Zagreb, and those {{elements}} that did not disperse to their homes withdrew into the Ivanšćica and Kalnik mountains. Leaders of a Slovene nationalist movement announced that <b>they</b> <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> recognised the Yugoslav government, and began to call for Slovene soldiers to cease fighting and return home, compounding the effect of Ustaše propaganda on Croat military personnel and accelerating the disintegration of Yugoslav forces.|$|E

5|$|Thorkildsen's {{relationship}} with the Norwegian hurdler Christina Vukicevic generated some unwanted publicity on his part. When Thorkildsen and Vukicevic won the King's Cup {{for men and women}} respectively at the 2006 Norwegian championships, Thorkildsen left the stadium to avoid photographers, whom he had shown the finger the previous day. In March 2011 Vukicevic and Thorkildsen announced in the Norwegian media that <b>they</b> <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> were a couple.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the success}} of International Velvet, and the heavy touring that followed, the band were pleased {{to return to the}} Monnow Valley Studio to record a third studio album. On the {{recommendation}} of TommyD, the band had been recording sample tracks onto a DPS12 hard disk recorder in their tour bus while on an American tour and they returned to Monnow Valley to record them properly. The band felt less pressure on them for the new album, due to {{the success of}} International Velvet and because <b>they</b> <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> feared being dropped by the label.|$|E

5|$|Starting {{from the}} release of Stage 2, changes {{were made to the}} hunter classes.

The ability's cooldown time decreases when the hunters deal enough damage to the monster. Starting from Stage 2, the health of all hunters regenerate if they manage to avoid damage, and <b>they</b> <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> have to rely on the Medic class.|$|E
5|$|Teeth of Brachytarsomys mahajambaensis {{have been}} found at the sites of Antsingiavo, Belobaka, and Ambatomainty in northwestern Madagascar, which are late Pleistocene (126,000 to 10,000 years ago) and Holocene (less than 10,000 years ago) in age. Brachytarsomys is a rare element of the rodent fauna, which is {{dominated}} by multiple species of Eliurus and Macrotarsomys. Modern Brachytarsomys are large rats that live in trees and eat fruits at middle to high altitudes. The modern, dry environment in northwestern Madagascar is decidedly inhospitable to these animals, and <b>they</b> <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> occur there; the former presence of B.mahajambaensis could indicate that the region was more humid in the past.|$|E
5|$|The {{historian}} N. J. Higham {{speculates that}} Gregory had {{originally intended to}} send the British slave boys as missionaries, until in 596 he received news that Liudhard had died, thus opening the way for more serious missionary activity. Higham argues {{that it was the}} lack of any bishop in Britain which allowed Gregory to send Augustine, with orders to be consecrated as a bishop if needed. Another consideration was that cooperation would be more easily obtained from the Frankish royal courts if <b>they</b> <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> had their own bishop and agent in place.|$|E

5|$|As Germany's {{military}} and economic situation grew steadily worse, on 25 August 1943 Reichsführer-SS Heinrich Himmler took over the post of interior minister, replacing Wilhelm Frick. Intensive air raids on Berlin and other cities took {{the lives of thousands}} of people. Göring's Luftwaffe attempted to retaliate with air raids on London in early 1944, but <b>they</b> <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> had sufficient aircraft to make much of an impact. While Goebbels' propaganda in this period indicated that a huge retaliation was in the offing, the V-1 flying bombs, launched on British targets beginning in mid-June 1944, had little effect, with only around 20 per cent reaching their intended targets. To boost morale, Goebbels continued to publish propaganda to the effect that further improvements to these weapons would have a decisive impact on the outcome of the war. Meanwhile, in the Normandy landings of 6 June 1944, the Allies successfully gained a foothold in France.|$|E
5|$|At 11:00 the {{security}} situation at the Air America compound was deteriorating as General Carey {{did not wish to}} risk his Marines by extending his perimeter to cover the Air America compound (LZ 40), so all Air America helicopters from this time operated out of the tennis courts in the DAO Annex (LZ 35). This move created fuel problems for Air America as <b>they</b> <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> had access to the fuel supplies in their compound and at least initially they were refused fuel by the ships of TF76. According to US Naval Archives, at 12:30 an Air America Bell 205 landed Air Vice Marshal Nguyễn Cao Kỳ, Madame Kỳ, Dorothy Martin (wife of Ambassador Martin) and others on the USS Denver; contemporary reports state and photos show that Marshal Kỳ piloted his own UH-1H Huey to the USS Midway.|$|E
5|$|In May 1942, Gens secured German {{permission}} for {{residents of the}} ghetto to sell belongings or property they left with gentiles outside the ghetto. The proceeds were to be split half and half between the Jewish owners and the Germans. In practice, the Germans often kept {{more than half the}} value, but it still allowed ghetto residents to receive some value for property <b>they</b> <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> controlled. Then in October 1942, the Germans allowed the Jewish ghetto police to retrieve Jewish property left with others outside the ghetto and bring it back to the ghetto. In the same month Gens set up a program to collect, repair, and redistribute winter clothing. The clothes were donated by ghetto residents, repaired in workshops in the ghetto, and then given to the poor and needy. The effort was credited with helping many of the poorest residents survive the winter of 1942–1943.|$|E

5|$|In late 1999, Runnels {{arranged}} the Terri Invitational Tournament, a best-of-five series, between Edge and Christian and The Hardy Boyz, with the winner receiving her managerial {{services and the}} sum of $100,000. The Hardy Boyz won the tournament, which culminated in a ladder match at No Mercy (with the prize money suspended above the ring in a bag). Runnels spent {{the next few months}} as their manager until she was injured when Bubba Ray Dudley powerbombed her through a table. She returned on February 27 at No Way Out and cost the Hardy Boyz a match. She then became the manager of Edge and Christian, and the storyline originally called for her to come between the duo, resulting in them becoming singles wrestlers with Runnels managing Christian. The storyline, however, was rewritten, and on an episode of SmackDown!, Edge and Christian—who would now continue wrestling as a tag team—revealed <b>they</b> <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> wanted Runnels's services. She, therefore, slapped Edge, who responded by spearing her.|$|E
5|$|It {{is unknown}} how much support there was for {{persecution}} within the aristocracy. After Gallienus's peace, Christians reached high ranks in Roman government. Diocletian appointed several Christians to those positions himself, {{and his wife}} and daughter may have been sympathetic to the church. There were many individuals willing to be martyrs, and many provincials willing to ignore any persecutory edicts from the emperors as well. Even Constantius was known to have disapproved of persecutory policies. The lower classes demonstrated little of the enthusiasm they had shown for earlier persecutions. <b>They</b> <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> believed the slanderous accusations that were popular in the 1st and 2nd centuries. Perhaps, as the historian Timothy Barnes has suggested, the long-established Church had become another accepted part of their lives.|$|E
5|$|Madzimbamuto petitioned for {{the right}} to appeal against his {{detention}} to the Privy Council in London; the Rhodesian Appellate Division ruled that he had no right to do so, but the Privy Council considered his case anyway. It ruled in his favour on 23 July 1968, deciding that orders for detention made by the Rhodesian government were invalid regardless of whether they were under the 1961 or 1965 constitution, and that Madzimbamuto was illegally detained. Harry Elinder Davies, one of the Rhodesian judges, announced on 8 August that the Rhodesian courts would not consider this ruling binding as <b>they</b> <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> accepted the Privy Council as part of the Rhodesian judicial hierarchy. Justice JR Dendy Young resigned in protest at Davies's ruling on 12 August and four days later became Chief Justice of Botswana. Madzimbamuto would remain in prison until 1974.|$|E
