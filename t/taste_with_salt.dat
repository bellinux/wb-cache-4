50|$|In {{northern}} Mexico and in American Tex-Mex cuisine, refried {{beans are}} usually prepared with pinto beans, {{but many other}} varieties of bean are used {{in other parts of}} Mexico, such as black, Peruano, or red (kidney) beans. The raw beans can be cooked when dry or soaked overnight, then stewed, drained of most of the remaining liquid, and converted into a paste with a masher (such as a potato masher), or pressed through a fine mesh sieve (to remove the skins). Some of the drained liquid, or chicken or vegetable stock, is added if the consistency is too dry. The paste is then baked or fried, usually with onion and garlic in a small amount of lard, vegetable oil, bacon drippings or butter and seasoned to <b>taste</b> <b>with</b> <b>salt</b> and spices. Lard is generally used more often in Mexico, and it has a large effect on flavor. Epazote is a common herb used to add a special and unique flavor. It is also a carminative, which means it reduces the gas associated with beans.|$|E
40|$|We run sensory test <b>with</b> SOYA-NO-SHIO, natural <b>salt</b> {{preserving}} the minerals of sea water of La Perouse Strait. Our {{study showed that}} SOYA-NO-SHIO gave little bitter taste {{in spite of its}} amount of sea water minerals including magnesium. SOYA-NO-SHIO gave less salty taste than did refined salt or ISHIGAKI-NO-SHIO, when compared at similar levels of sodium chloride contained. No significant correlation was observed between menstruation and sensitivity of <b>taste</b> <b>with</b> <b>salts.</b> Our results are in compatible with an idea that SOYA-NO-SHIO is natural <b>salt</b> <b>with</b> well-balanced <b>tastes</b> not only good for food seasoning, but also useful with its amount of sea water minerals including potassium and magnesium for prevention or treatment of hypertension...|$|R

50|$|Tostones (also {{known as}} banana peze in Haiti, tachinos or chatinos in Cuba, platanos verdes fritos or fritos verdes in the Dominican Republic and patacones in Nicaragua, Colombia, Costa Rica, Ecuador, Honduras, Panama, Peru and Venezuela) are twice-fried {{plantain}} patties, often {{served as a}} side, appetizer, or snack. Plantains are sliced in 4 cm long pieces and fried in oil. The segments are then removed and individually smashed down either with a bottle's bottom side, or with a tostonera, to about half their original height. Finally, the pieces are fried again and then seasoned to <b>taste,</b> often <b>with</b> <b>salt.</b> In some countries, such as Haiti, Cuba, Puerto Rico and the Dominican Republic, the tostones are dipped in creole sauce from chicken, pork, beef, or shrimp before eating. In some South American countries, the name tostones is used to describe this food when prepared at home and also plantain chips (mentioned above), which are typically purchased from a store. In western Venezuela, much of Colombia and the Peruvian Amazon, patacones are very popular. Plantains are again sliced in long pieces and fried in oil, then {{they are used to}} make sandwiches with pork, beef, chicken, vegetables and ketchup. They can be made with unripe patacon verde or ripe patacon amarillo plantains. Tostones in the Dominican Republic are once-fried and are thicker than chips.
