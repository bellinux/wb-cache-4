5|$|Strongly {{affected}} by the deindustrialization {{that took place in}} other Rust Belt cities, Utica suffered a major reduction in manufacturing activity {{during the second half of}} the 20thcentury. The 1954 opening of the New York State Thruway (which bypassed the city) and declines in activity on the Erie Canal and railroads throughout <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States</b> <b>also</b> contributed to a poor local economy. During the 1980s and 1990s, major employers such as General Electric and Lockheed Martin began to close plants in Utica and Syracuse.|$|E

5|$|The NBC radio crew {{aboard the}} lead bomber made its live {{broadcast}} coast-to-coast as the bombers flew by the Rex.

Eaker exploited a trust of Americans in radio broadcasts and in photography, particular to that era, to bolster the credibility of Air Corps claims that air power was essential in defending the western hemisphere. In addition to the Rex episode, the May 1938 maneuvers conducted a well-publicized mock attack on New York City, and arranged the first voluntary blackout in <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States,</b> <b>also</b> planned by Eaker, during a mock raid on Farmingdale, New York, on 16 May.|$|E
5|$|The {{third phase}} of the {{campaign}} was heavily favored by U.S. commanders, because it allowed them to destroy rather than just threaten Hanoiâ€™s nascent industrial infrastructures. Furthermore, the new targets approved by the Johnson administration enabled U.S. airpower to be used against the primary war-making capabilities of North Vietnam, by striking at military targets that were previously denied to the fighter-bombers of the U.S. Navy and Air Force. Thus, in 1967 <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States</b> <b>also</b> introduced more aircraft into the operation equipped with new technology, which gave American air units the assets to make a significant difference. However, as American bombers moved closer to Hanoi and Hai Phong, they were aggressively challenged by North Vietnamese MiG fighters.|$|E

5|$|Both Germany and the United States have {{developed}} several other rounds. These include the German DM12 multi-purpose anti-tank projectile (MPAT), {{based on the}} technology in a high explosive anti-tank (HEAT) warhead. However, {{it has been found}} that the DM12's armor-killing abilities are limited by the lack of blast and fragmentation effects, and that the round is less valuable against lightly armored targets. <b>The</b> <b>United</b> <b>States</b> <b>also</b> has a MPAT type projectile, known as the M830. This was later developed into the M830A1, which allows the M1 Abrams to use the round against helicopters. The M1 Abrams can use the M1028 canister round, which is an anti-personnel/anti-helicopter munition, packed with over 1,000 tungsten balls. The United States Armed Forces accepted a new demolition round, called the M908 Obstacle Defeating Round, based on the M830A1 MPAT, but with the proximity fuse replaced by a hardened nose cap. The cap allows the round to impact and embed itself in concrete, then exploding inside the target and causing more damage.|$|E
5|$|In the European Union, animal {{sources are}} governed by Council Directive 86/609/EEC, which {{requires}} lab animals to be specially bred, unless the animal has been lawfully imported {{and is not a}} wild animal or a stray. The latter requirement may also be exempted by special arrangement. In 2010 the Directive was revised with EU Directive 2010/63/EU. In the UK, most animals used in experiments are bred for the purpose under the 1988 Animal Protection Act, but wild-caught primates may be used if exceptional and specific justification can be established. <b>The</b> <b>United</b> <b>States</b> <b>also</b> allows the use of wild-caught primates; between 1995 and 1999, 1,580 wild baboons were imported into the U.S. Over half the primates imported between 1995 and 2000 were handled by Charles River Laboratories, or by Covance, which is the single largest importer of primates into the U.S.|$|E
5|$|Temperature is {{a measure}} of the kinetic energy of a sample of matter. Temperature is the unique {{physical}} property that determines the direction of heat flow between two objects placed in thermal contact. If no heat flow occurs, the two objects have the same temperature; otherwise heat flows from the hotter object to the colder object. Temperature, within meteorology, is measured with thermometers exposed to the air but sheltered from direct solar exposure. In most of the world, the degree Celsius scale is used for most temperature measuring purposes. However, the United States is the last major country in which the degree Fahrenheit temperature scale is used by most lay people, industry, popular meteorology, and government. Despite this, METAR reports from <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States</b> <b>also</b> report the temperature (and dewpoint, see below) in degrees Celsius.|$|E
