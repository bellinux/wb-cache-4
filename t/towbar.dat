25|$|Apart {{from being}} the easiest Munro, Càrn Aosda also has the {{reputation}} as {{being one of the}} most despoiled, with the mountain having snow fences, ski tow supports, huts and vehicle tracks right up to the summit as part of the Glenshee ski centre. The mountain has four pistes on its slopes, there is a run for beginners plus two for intermediate level on the easier slopes which go south from the summit into Butchart’s Corrie. There is a piste ranked as difficult on the steeper slopes of the eastern shoulder. There are also three <b>towbar</b> lifts on the southern slopes to service the ski runs one of which goes past the 900 metre mark to just a few metres from the summit.|$|E
50|$|Brakes - Dollies have {{mechanical}} brakes which automatically {{lock the}} dolly wheels when the <b>towbar</b> {{is in the}} parked (vertical) orientation, and automatically release the dolly wheels when the <b>towbar</b> is in the towing (horizontal) orientation. No explicit manual locking/unlocking action by the operator is needed.|$|E

5000|$|Another use is in {{pushback}} bars {{used for}} large aircraft. In this device, shear pins are frequently used {{to connect the}} [...] "head" [...] of the <b>towbar</b> - the portion that attaches to the aircraft - to the main shaft of the <b>towbar.</b> In this way, {{the failure of the}} shear pin will physically separate the aircraft and the tractor. The design may be such that the shear pin will have several different causes of failure - <b>towbar</b> rotation about its long axis, sudden braking or acceleration, excessive steering force, etc. - all of which could otherwise be extremely damaging to the aircraft.|$|E

5000|$|Manufacturers of {{electric}} TBL tugs offer models capable of moving any aircraft from the smallest single-engine type to narrow-body airliners, military cargo and airline-sized business jets. Just as specialized <b>towbars</b> {{are required for}} a wide range of aircraft, many TBL tugs use adapters which enable the movement of many unique aircraft. The majority of aircraft do not require adapters and can be moved without any special adjustments to the tug. This is in contrast to conventional tugs which often use so-called [...] "universal" [...] <b>towbars</b> which must be adjustable to suit many aircraft types. Electric TBL tugs are gaining popularity among general aviation operators and FBOs as an alternative to gas or diesel-powered conventional tugs. Being electric rather than internal combustion-powered, electric tugs are low-emission which is a major advantage for environmentally-conscious operators; this also enables the tug to be safely operated inside a closed hangar.|$|R
50|$|The above {{alternatives}} {{were eliminated}} {{in favour of}} a substantial redesign of the indigenous platform, due to concerns about the Australian market preference for high towing capacity, large interior size and local employment. Specific factors included, for example: research at the time indicated that 69% of Falcons were fitted with <b>towbars</b> and the perception that rear-wheel drive cars were better at towing; {{the fact that the}} import models had limited body style options (sedan only or sedan and wagon) and no capability to use a V8 engine.|$|R

50|$|AERO Specialties, Inc. is a {{manufacturer}} and international distributor {{of new and}} refurbished aircraft ground support equipment (GSE). AERO Specialties was founded in 1987 by President Matt Sheehan to supply GSE products to corporate, fixed-base operator (FBO), commercial, military, and general aviation customers globally. AERO Specialties manufactures aircraft diesel-electric hybrid ground power units (GPUs), lavatory, potable water, cleaning, and oxygen/nitrogen servicing carts, as well as aircraft <b>towbars</b> and heads. AERO Specialties is an authorized U.S. distributor for Eagle Tugs, Tug Technologies, TLD, Unitron, Clyde Machines, Powervamp, and Stinar.|$|R
50|$|Once the aircraft's speed has slowed, {{reverse thrust}} {{is shut down}} to prevent the {{reversed}} airflow from throwing debris {{in front of the}} engine intakes where it can be ingested, causing foreign object damage. If circumstances require it, reverse thrust can be used all the way to a stop, or even to provide thrust to push the aircraft backward, though aircraft tugs or <b>towbars</b> are more commonly used for that purpose. When reverse thrust is used to push an aircraft back from the gate, the maneuver is called a powerback. Some manufacturers warn against the use of this procedure during icy conditions as using reverse thrust on snow- or slush-covered ground can cause slush, water, and runway deicers to become airborne and adhere to wing surfaces.|$|R
5000|$|... 1977 - Mr. Stanley {{died in a}} {{plane crash}} on July 16, 1977. This started the {{close-out}} of contracts id, brought to an end an era in the history of the Corporation, and contracts in the aerospace industry. On July 21, 1990, he was inducted into the National Aviation Hall of Fame. 1981- Stanley Aviation was acquired by Flight Refuelling Limited, currently known as Cobham plc. A new group of products of aircraft fuel system and components were developed and sold. 1986 - Stanley Aviation's name was kept, and the firm acquired two companies: Stang Manufacturing, Inc. and K&V Manufacturing to develop and sell aviation ground support equipment. This included engine shipping and handling equipment, aircraft <b>towbars</b> and special aircraft tooling.|$|R
50|$|Conventional tugs use a tow bar {{to connect}} the tug to the nose landing gear of the aircraft. The tow bar is fixed {{laterally}} at the nose landing gear, but may move slightly vertically for height adjustment. At the end that attaches to the tug, the tow bar may pivot freely laterally and vertically. In this manner the tow bar acts as a large lever to rotate the nose landing gear. Each aircraft type has a unique tow fitting so the <b>towbar</b> also acts as an adapter between the standard-sized tow pin on the tug and the type-specific fitting on the aircraft's landing gear. The tow bar must be long enough to place the tug far away enough to avoid hitting the aircraft and to provide sufficient leverage to facilitate turns. On heavy tow bars for large aircraft the <b>towbar</b> rides on its own wheels when not connected to an aircraft. The wheels are attached to a hydraulic jacking mechanism which can lift the <b>towbar</b> to the correct height to mate to both the airplane and the tug, and once this is accomplished the same mechanism is used in reverse to raise the tow bar wheels from the ground during the pushback process. The tow bar can be connected at the front or {{the rear of the}} tractor, depending on whether the aircraft will be pushed or pulled. The <b>towbar</b> has a shear pin which prevents the aircraft from being mishandled by the tug; when overstressed the shear pin will snap, disconnecting the bar from the nose gear to prevent damage to the aircraft and tug.Towbarless tractors do not use a towbar; they scoop up the nose landing gear and lift it off the ground, allowing the tug to maneuver the aircraft. This allows better control of the aircraft and higher speeds; it may also eliminate the need to have a worker in the cockpit to apply the aircraft's brakes. The main advantage of a towbarless tug is simplicity; {{there is no need to}} maintain multiple towbars. The physical action and coordination required by the tug operator to move an aircraft with a TBL tug is simpler and easier to learn than with a tug and <b>towbar.</b> By connecting the tug directly to the aircraft's landing gear tug operators have better control and responsiveness when maneuvering. This is most advantageous in general aviation settings where operators are often required to move more types of aircraft more often into more confined spaces than their airline counterparts.|$|E
50|$|AERO Specialties {{provided}} GSE to all FBOs (Avitat, Landmark Aviation, and Million Air) at Vancouver International Airport (YVR) {{during the}} 2010 Vancouver Winter Olympics to meet increased aircraft traffic demands from athletes, fans and organizers. AERO Specialties supplied approximately 40 {{pieces of equipment}} including Eagle TT-series pushback tractors, TLD and JetGo GPUs, and AERO brand towbars, <b>towbar</b> heads, lavatory and potable water carts.|$|E
50|$|Motorcycle sidecars {{were popular}} {{at the end}} of the 1950s, so the Model 120 was {{provided}} with a purpose built sidecar chassis, connected by a three point mounting which provided minimal alignment problems. The sidecar wheel was interchangeable with the motorcycle wheels and had swinging arm suspension with an Armstrong shock absorber. A trailer with a <b>towbar</b> was also provided as an option.|$|E
5000|$|Of {{the many}} cars fitted with <b>towbars,</b> most {{are likely to}} have fitted towing {{electrics}} which are ‘hidden’ from the car. This electrical installation is commonly called ‘By-pass electrics’. This system is used to protect the car's lighting systems from potential damage if wiring in a trailer should malfunction. It is a tried and tested system in very wide use. Bypass systems are found both in [...] "universal" [...] (non-vehicle-specific) systems and in dedicated and OEM systems. Since the early 2000s, vehicle technology has moved forward introducing CANbus network systems which allowed the interaction of different systems, and also the detection of a trailer or caravan. In some cases, the manufacturers have not only designed automobiles to sense the presence of a trailer, but they have also created enhanced new features within the systems connected to the network. This actually makes it important that these particular vehicles can [...] "see" [...] the trailer or caravan. A few of these new features are for safety and stability, but most are merely convenience things like automatically switching off the rear fog light and parking sensors. The main new safety feature, appearing now on some cars, is the Trailer Stability Program which automatically turns on when a trailer detected in the network through the dedicated sensors.|$|R
50|$|While O'Reilly and Celine wait {{by their}} car, Jackson takes Robert {{into the woods}} to execute him. Before he can, Celine decks O'Reilly, runs into the woods, and knocks Jackson out with a shovel. As Robert and Celine drive away, O'Reilly grabs the <b>towbar</b> and rides along. As she points her gun, Robert and Celine jump from the car, and it careens off a cliff, with the money still inside.|$|E
50|$|A {{tow hitch}} (or tow bar) is a device {{attached}} to the chassis of a vehicle for towing, or a <b>towbar</b> to an aircraft nose gear. It can {{take the form of}} a tow ball to allow swiveling and articulation of a trailer, or a tow pin, or a tow hook with a trailer loop, often used for large or agricultural vehicles where slack in the pivot pin allows similar movements. Another category is the towing pintle used on military vehicles worldwide.|$|E
5000|$|The company {{planned to}} offer rear-wheel drive models, but instead all models {{incorporate}} all wheel drive. The standard AWD has [...] {{on both the}} front and rear motors, while the performance edition has [...] front and [...] rear.

At the [...] towing speed limit in California, a Model X may have 70% of the [...] EPA-registered range when pulling a [...] travel trailer.|$|E
5000|$|Nowadays some {{vehicles}} are being fitted with CANbus networks, {{and some of}} these use the CANbus to connect the tow bar electrics to various safety systems and controls. For vehicles that use the CANbus to activate towing-related safety systems, a wiring kit that can interact appropriately must be used. Without such a <b>towbar</b> wiring kit the vehicle can not detect the presence of a trailer and can therefore not activate safety features such as Trailer stability program which can electronically control a snaking trailer or caravan.|$|E

50|$|Portable {{beaching}} gear could be attached by ground crew {{so that the}} aircraft could be pulled up on land. The gear consisted {{of a pair of}} two-wheeled struts that could be attached to either side of the fuselage, below the wing, with a two- or four-wheel trolley and <b>towbar</b> attached under the rear of the hull. A standard stocked anchor was stowed in the forward compartment alongside the anchor winch. Depending on the operating area, a number of different kinds of anchor could be carried to cope with different anchorages. Another means of direction control on the water was by application of the rudder and aileron flight controls. The ailerons would cause asymmetric lift from the airflow and, ultimately, drop a float into the water to cause drag on that wing. The pilots could vary engine power to control the direction and speed of the aircraft on the water. In adverse combinations of tide, wind, and destination, this could be very difficult.|$|E
5000|$|Boom - use an {{adjustable}} boom with a winch to recover vehicles from a ditch, over an embankment, or any place the vehicle cannot be safely reach backing-up. Some booms are fixed, some heavy pivoting A-frames, others hydraulic-powered telescoping tubes. In the past boom trucks used a [...] "hook and chain" [...] system where chains are looped around the vehicle frame or axle, then lifted by a boom winch. A <b>towbar</b> with heavy rubberized mats connects {{the truck and}} vehicle, {{so it can be}} towed on its other axle. [...] "Slings" [...] and [...] "belt lifts" [...] are an evolution, with rubber straps replacing part of the chains. Slings are not used much today because they can scratch the bumpers of cars. But they are sometimes used for towing vehicles that have been in an accident or have {{one or two of the}} front or rear wheels missing or for pickup trucks and other vehicles that have steel bumpers. Cars equipped with all-wheel drive cannot be towed with a sling, since it can cause problems with the car's drivetrain.|$|E
5000|$|There were plans, not {{put into}} practice, {{to use the}} Arado Ar 234 jet bomber to launch V-1s either by towing them aloft or by {{launching}} them from a [...] "piggy back" [...] position (in {{the manner of the}} Mistel, but in reverse) atop the aircraft. In the latter configuration, a pilot-controlled, hydraulically operated dorsal trapeze mechanism would elevate the missile on the trapeze's launch cradle some eight feet clear of the 234's upper fuselage. This was necessary to avoid damaging the mother craft's fuselage and tail surfaces when the pulsejet ignited, as well as to ensure a [...] "clean" [...] airflow for the Argus motor's intake. A somewhat less ambitious project undertaken was the adaptation of the missile as a [...] "flying fuel tank" [...] (Deichselschlepp) for the Messerschmitt Me 262 jet fighter, which was initially test-towed behind an He 177A Greif bomber. The pulsejet, internal systems and warhead of the missile were removed, leaving only the wings and basic fuselage, now containing a single large fuel tank. A small cylindrical module, similar in shape to a finless dart, was placed atop the vertical stabilizer {{at the rear of the}} tank, acting as a centre of gravity balance and attachment point for a variety of equipment sets. A rigid tow-bar with a pitch pivot at the forward end connected the flying tank to the Me 262. The operational procedure for this unusual configuration saw the tank resting on a wheeled trolley for take-off. The trolley was dropped once the combination was airborne, and explosive bolts separated the <b>towbar</b> from the fighter upon exhaustion of the tank's fuel supply. A number of test flights were conducted in 1944 with this set-up, but inflight [...] "porpoising" [...] of the tank, with the instability transferred to the fighter, meant the system was too unreliable to be used. An identical utilisation of the V-1 flying tank for the Ar 234 bomber was also investigated, with the same conclusions reached. Some of the [...] "flying fuel tanks" [...] used in trials utilised a cumbersome fixed and spatted undercarriage arrangement, which (along with being pointless) merely increased the drag and stability problems already inherent in the design.|$|E
