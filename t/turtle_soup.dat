5|$|Davies {{travelled}} to United Recording Studios in Los Angeles, California on 11 April 1969, {{to produce}} American pop band The Turtles' LP <b>Turtle</b> <b>Soup</b> with engineer Chuck Britz. While in Los Angeles, Davies helped negotiate {{an end to}} the concert ban placed on the Kinks by the American Federation of Musicians in 1965. Although neither the Kinks nor the union gave a specific reason for the ban, {{at the time it was}} widely attributed to their rowdy on-stage behaviour. After negotiations with Davies, the Federation relented, opening up an opportunity for the group to return to touring in America. Once the main sessions for the Turtles LP were completed, Davies returned to England. While Davies was abroad, the other members of the band had been rehearsing and practising for the upcoming album, as well as lead guitarist Dave Davies' solo album, nicknamed A Hole in the Sock of. When Ray returned, the Kinks regrouped at his house in Borehamwood, Hertfordshire, to rehearse the upcoming album Arthur.|$|E

Banquets were often held in the ballroom for esteemed figures and international royalty. On February 11, 1899, Oscar of the Waldorf hosted a lavish dinner reception which the New York Herald Tribune cited as the city's costliest dinner at the time. Some $250 was spent per guest, with bluepoint oysters, green <b>turtle</b> <b>soup,</b> lobster, ruddy duck and blue raspberries. Two months later, 120 sailors of the cruiser Raleigh were given a banquet, during which the gallery was decorated with silk banners and flags. One article that year claimed that {{at any one time}} the hotel had $7 million worth of valuables locked in the safe, testament to the wealth of its guests. In 1909, banquets, attended by hundreds, were organized for Arctic explorer Frederick Cook in September and Elbert Henry Gary, a founder of US Steel, the following month.|$|E

Its bar, Vieux Carré (French Quarter), served New Orleans cocktails including Bourbon-based drinks, daiquiris, and house infusions.

The mock <b>turtle</b> <b>soup</b> has an Alice in Wonderland theme, where a fob watch formed of freeze-dried beef stock covered with gold leaf is dropped into a tea cup and has a beef stock [...] "tea" [...] poured over it that dissolves the gold and the watch. A plate of ox tongue and vegetables is served alongside it to place into the soup. Toast sandwiches are served as a side dish. It had been developed for an appearance on Heston's Feasts, and was afterwards added to the menu at the restaurant. Dishes are served with additional sensory inputs, such as [...] "Sounds of the Sea", a plate of seafood served with a seafood foam {{on top of a}} [...] "beach" [...] of tapioca, breadcrumbs and eel. Alongside the dish, diners are given an iPod to listen to crashing waves whilst they eat.

500|$|With a {{telephone}} {{in every room}} and first-class room service, the hotel was designed specifically to cater {{to the needs of}} socially prominent [...] "wealthy upper crust" [...] of New York and distinguished foreign visitors to the city. The hotel became, according to author Sean Dennis Cashman, [...] "a successful symbol of the opulence and achievement of the Astor family". It was the first hotel to offer complete electricity and private bathrooms. Founding proprietor Boldt, whose motto was [...] "the guest is always right", became wealthy and prominent internationally, if not so much a popular celebrity as his famous employee, Oscar Tschirky, known as [...] "Oscar of the Waldorf", maître d'hôtel from the hotel's inauguration in 1893 until his retirement in 1943. Tschirky had arrived in the United States from Switzerland ten years prior to applying for the position at the new Waldorf and over the years grew to possess a great knowledge of cuisine. He authored The Cookbook by Oscar of The Waldorf (1896), a 900-page book featuring all of the popular recipes of the day, including his own, for which he garnered great acclaim, such as Waldorf salad, Eggs Benedict and Thousand Island dressing, which remain popular worldwide today. James Remington McCarthy wrote in his book Peacock Alley that Oscar gained renown among the general public as an artist who [...] "composed sonatas in soups, symphonies in salads, minuets in sauces, lyrics in entrees". In 1902 Tschirky published Serving a Course Dinner by Oscar of the Waldorf-Astoria, a booklet that explains the intricacies of being a caterer to the American and international elite. Tschirky had an excellent memory and an encyclopedic memory of the culinary preferences of many of the guests, which further added to his popularity. In 1937, for instance, he recalled the opening night and notable people present at the old Waldorf, a guest at the old building known to the public as Buffalo Bill, and spoke at length about the planning for the Panama Canal that took place at the Waldorf-Astoria.The Waldorf gained significant renown internationally for its fundraising dinners and balls, regularly attracting notables of the day such as Andrew Carnegie, who became a fixture. Banquets were often held in the ballroom for esteemed figures and international royalty. The Waldorf Astoria was influential in advancing the status of women, who were admitted singly without escorts. George Boldt's wife, Louise Kehrer Boldt, was influential in evolving the idea of the grand urban hotel as a social center, particularly in making it appealing to women as a venue for social events. On February 11, 1899, Oscar hosted a lavish dinner reception that the New York Herald Tribune cited as the city's costliest dinner at the time. Some $250 was spent per guest, with bluepoint oysters, green <b>turtle</b> <b>soup,</b> lobster, ruddy duck and blue raspberries. One article that year claimed that at any one time the hotel had $7 million worth of valuables locked in the safe, testament to the wealth of its guests. In 1902 a lavish dinner was organized for Prince Henry of Prussia, and in 1909 banquets, attended by hundreds, were organized for Arctic explorer Frederick Cook in September and Elbert Henry Gary, a founder of US Steel, the following month.|$|E
5000|$|The {{significant}} improvements to world records at the Chinese Games, {{and the strength}} in depth of the times, attracted international consternation of the results at the national event. The sudden emergence of the runners, the large improvements to world records, and the sudden disappearance of runners from the international scene led to accusations of doping. American distance runner Mary Slaney said the performances would [...] "ruin the sport" [...] and head of USA Track and Field Ollan Cassell said [...] "If these suspicions aren't cleared up, it's a big problem". Ma's coach, Ma Junren, attributed his athletes success to hard training, <b>turtle</b> shell <b>soup</b> and cordyceps sinensis (a caterpillar fungus). His coaching career endured significant criticism in 2000 when six of his athletes tested positive for erythropoietin, a banned blood-boosting product. Ma Liyan's performances, and those by others in her group, remain listed as among the fastest women's times in long-distance running, but that legacy has been tempered by scepticism around {{the circumstances of the}} results.|$|R

Notes from the interrogation of Hitler's personal aides about his daily routine in 1944 reveal that after midnight Eva Braun would [...] "direct that there should be another light snack of <b>turtle</b> <b>soup,</b> sandwiches, and sausages"; however, <b>turtle</b> <b>soup</b> was one of Braun's favourite dishes and the interrogation notes do not indicate if Hitler shared the supper.

Like E. L. Doctorow's Ragtime, the novel combines fact with fiction. Historical figures such as Lincoln Steffens, Jacob Riis, Anthony Comstock, and J. Pierpont Morgan appear briefly in the novel and interact with the fictional characters. Carr includes period details, such as descriptions of [...] "sumptuous meals of <b>turtle</b> <b>soup</b> au clair, Creole eggs, broiled squab, saddle of lamb a la Colbert and 'a liter of smooth, dark Wurzburger (beer) that had a head as thick as whipped cream'".|$|E
