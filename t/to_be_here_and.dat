He was provided with many subjects to paint {{as he came}} to know the farmers of the area, who were amazed by Kirchner's gramophone. Kirchner writes {{of the people of}} Davos: [...] "The people who live here are proud. The hard work, which is done with great love, the way they treat animals (you very seldom see an animal being mishandled) entitle them to be proud. In most cases, work here has reached the ideal standard of being done with love. You can see it in the movements of their hands. And that, in turn, ennobles the facial expression and imbues all personal contacts with a great delicacy. This is a country in which democracy has become reality. Here a man’s word still counts, and you need have no fears about sleeping with your doors open. I am so happy to be allowed <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>here,</b> <b>and</b> through hard work I should like to thank the people for the kindness they have shown me". Kirchner began writing critiques of his own art under the pseudonym of Louis de Marsalle in order to control public opinion of him and free himself of dependence upon the art critics of the day.|$|E

40|$|A queue {{control system}} <b>is</b> {{developed}} <b>to</b> control the queue in businesses and in servicing counters. By using queue control system, {{the company or}} service provider will <b>be</b> able <b>to</b> control the queue of the customers and ensure the provision of a better service. Due to the increase of the demand from people for a better service, {{it is more likely}} that a queue control system <b>is</b> required <b>to</b> <b>be</b> allocated at all time for all companies. However, looking the queue control systems currently available in the market, most of them are big in size <b>and</b> unable <b>to</b> <b>be</b> moved <b>here</b> <b>and</b> there. These portable queue systems <b>are</b> mainly connected <b>to</b> big screen or static panel at the entrance for customers to obtain their numbers. This will cause problem in moving counters such as ticketing counters outdoor or servicing counters in a shopping mall. Hence, there is a demand for the portable queue control system which <b>is</b> able <b>to</b> <b>be</b> moved <b>here</b> <b>and</b> there. The purpose of this project <b>is</b> <b>to</b> develop a portable queue control system which <b>is</b> able <b>to</b> fulfill the request discussed above. Looking alike as the normal queue control system, portable queue control system is a small-sized system which can <b>be</b> used <b>to</b> control queue during outdoor events. Unlike static queue control system, portable queue control system <b>is</b> able <b>to</b> function in small range using 9 V battery and <b>is</b> convenient <b>to</b> <b>be</b> carried <b>here</b> <b>and</b> there. In this simple system, one push button will be allocated at the display panel, allowing customer to input their arrivals, and a push button will <b>be</b> used <b>to</b> allow the counters to call for the next customer <b>to</b> <b>be</b> served. The display panel and the counters will be communicating with each other via XBEE wireless communication. For further enhancement, the system will <b>be</b> able <b>to</b> control the absence of more customers and sound notification which will call out the customer number and counter number <b>is</b> able <b>to</b> <b>be</b> installed. Besides that, duplication of the display can be made and the multi segments which are big in size can be used...|$|R
