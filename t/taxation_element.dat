40|$|The {{trends of}} {{development}} and increment of individual trees, {{as well as the}} productivity of beech coppice stands in the region of Crni Vrh were studied. The trees in the category of 20 % of the largest-diameter trees in the stand were analyzed by the standard dendrometric analysis, the productivity was assessed based on the values of the major <b>taxation</b> <b>elements</b> measured at the sample plots. The results of these analyses, combined with the results reported by other authors, who studied beech coppice forests at the same locality but from different aspects, enable the real and comprehensive assessment of the state of these stands. On this basis, the aim of long-term management (conversion into a high silvicultural form) and the actual silvicultural measure (high selection thinning) were defined...|$|R
40|$|This final thesis {{deals with}} {{comparison}} of labor taxation in selected {{countries of the}} European Union: countries of Visegrad 4 and Germany. One of the essential goals was to find labor taxation for determined income levels and comparison of total labor taxation between selected countries. Next goal was to implement elements of most optimized labor taxation to Czech tax system. The first two chapters represent description of labor taxation: of personal income tax and social contributions in selected countries. Third chapter analyzes labor taxation for determined levels of income for every each country. Fourth chapter deals with the comparison of the labor taxation between selected countries and reflects differences of tax systems. Last fifth chapter analyses implementation of labor <b>taxation</b> <b>elements</b> of other examined country to the Czech tax system...|$|R
40|$|The Government’s {{clean energy}} strategy, to {{commence}} from 1 July 2012, departs {{from the former}} Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme (CPRS) {{in a number of}} ways. One key departure is the Carbon Farming Initiative (CFI). The CFI signals a change in approach to land use issues from the previous CPRS, as the Government has decided agriculture and other land-based activities will not be covered by the carbon pricing mechanism. Rather, changes in land use will be incentivised by way of the CFI. The CFI also goes well beyond the forestry-based activities included in the CPRS to cover many and varied project types. This article explores the tax implications of key elements of the CFI. It describes the link between the CFI and the carbon price that forms the basis for the inclusion of units issued under the CFI in the taxation rules. It also outlines the key operation and <b>taxation</b> <b>elements</b> of the revised clean energy scheme and highlights key departures from the CPRS...|$|R
40|$|A common {{criticism}} of the minerals resource rent tax (MRRT) {{was that it would}} ‘kill the goose that laid the golden egg’ for the Australian economy. Mining companies, their industry associations, and the Liberal–National Coalition all argued the MRRT would reduce Australia's attractiveness for mining investment, and lead to ‘capital flight’ as resource firms shifted towards lower-taxing competitors. To evaluate this claim, it is necessary to compare Australia's resource policy regime – including, but not limited to, its <b>taxation</b> <b>elements</b> – against those of its principal competitors. This article undertakes such an evaluation by comparing Australian resource policies with those of nine of its major mineral and energy competitor countries. This survey reveals that Australia's comparatively high mining tax rates are partially offset by its ‘non-interventionist’ approach to resource policy, and that it has retained good rankings on international political risk surveys. There is some evidence of short-term market response to the mining tax, but there is little evidence of sustained capital flight occurring due to the MRRT. These data collectively suggest that the MRRT did not significantly undermine Australia's attractiveness for international mining investment, despite widespread perceptions to the contrary...|$|R
40|$|One of the {{principal}} determinants of an asset 2 ̆ 7 s return is its liquidity-the ease with which the asset can be bought and sold. Liquid assets yield a lower return than do otherwise comparable illiquid assets. This Article demonstrates that an income tax alters the tradeoff between asset liquidity and yield because: high yields from illiquid assets are taxed; imputed transaction services income from liquidity is untaxed; and illiquidity costs are only sometimes deductible. As a result, assets have more liquidity {{and the price of}} liquidity in terms of yield is higher than {{it would be in the}} absence of an income tax. These distortions foster an excessively large financial sector, which exists in large part to create (tax-favored) liquidity. The tax wedge between liquidity and yield also creates clientele effects, in which low-rate taxpayers, such as nonprofit institutions, hold illiquid assets regardless of their liquidity needs. The liquidity/yield tax distortion also offers a new perspective on fundamental questions in federal income tax, such as the desirability of the realization requirement, preferential capital gains tax rates, and corporate <b>taxation.</b> These <b>elements</b> of the income tax mitigate or even negate the pro-liquidity tax bias identified in this Article...|$|R
40|$|<b>Taxation,</b> an {{essential}} <b>element</b> of an efficient public finance system, {{is the best}} way for collecting income to achive the public expenditures programs and, in the same time, a way to redistribute the income, in order to get rid of poverty and to ensure social equity. Studies on the topic of international taxation, in its traditional meaning, were addressed to the problems regarding the international taxation effects on trade and investments, unequitable and discriminatory taxation, also the means of preventing such cases, international fiscal evasion, all these aspects being comprised into the area of fiscal competition. The present concept of international taxation, meant to cross states borders, in order to redistribute the income or to achive other objectives with international implications, such as fight against poverty, maintaining world peace or environment protection, is a quite recent one. international taxation; fiscal competition; mandatory; pigouvian taxes. ...|$|R
40|$|Courses in <b>taxation</b> {{generally}} cover <b>elements</b> {{pertaining to}} the quantitative, legal and expository aspects, all of which rely on the understanding and interpretation of complex tax statutes, which in turn involve both language and content complexities. This study is on students pursuing taxation courses at the tertiary level in Malaysia, where the medium of instruction is in English, which is neither the students' mother tongue nor their first language. As tax statutes and reference materials on taxation in Malaysia are mainly in English, and taxation courses are taught and assessed in English, a reasonably high level of English language skills is essential {{to cope with the}} legal and expository aspects. The study reveals {{that a majority of the}} students agreed that they encountered difficulties in terms of language complexity rather than content complexity, particularly in relation to understanding textbooks and examination questions. In terms of content complexity, less than one third agreed that they encountered difficulties in understanding textbooks and lectures / tutorials...|$|R

40|$|To uphold public confidence, {{businesses}} {{have been active}} in formulating ethical policies to regulate the behaviour of their members. It is generally accepted that the educational preparation of business people is critical for the effective implementation of such policies. Since taxation {{is an area that}} could have a potential impact on human behaviour, it is pertinent that <b>taxation</b> courses include <b>elements</b> of ethics to sensitize students to ethical issues in this area. The {{purpose of this study is}} to ascertain the current state of ethics teaching in the tax curriculum in New Zealand tertiary institutions. It looks at the coverage of ethics, the time devoted to the subject, the teaching mode and resources, areas covered, types of assessment used, expected outcomes, and the constraints. Research results indicated that there was limited coverage in this area as the existing curriculum is subject to a number of constraints. The findings have provided evidence to suggest that there is a need to strengthen the ethics component in the taxation curriculum in New Zealand tertiary institutions.

40|$|Tax reliefs are optional, {{but a very}} {{important}} <b>element</b> of the <b>taxation</b> system. This <b>element</b> is used for different purposes by a country’s government institutions. Tax reliefs are a form of tax expenditure that helps to reduce budget revenues. Tax reliefs influence individual and corporate financial behaviour and can have positive or negative effects on {{the economic and social}} factors. In the last few years, expansion of tax relief has attracted worldwide attention because of the fact that, after the global financial crisis, many countries are still suffering from fiscal deficits, and expansion of tax relief has not contributed to solving this problem. Tax reliefs are presupposed to be a fiscal policy tool of significance in various subsystems of public finances. The main aim {{of this article is to}} examine the impact of personal income tax reliefs on Lithuanian public finances. To achieve this aim, statistical information was systemized; Monte Carlo method was used to group data by horizontal rows and logical links analysed, which helped to evaluate the influence of tax reliefs on public finances. In the simulations, the Monte Carlo method helped to simulate random samples, which were then examined by adapting the conclusions of the theory of probability and mathematical statistics methods...|$|R
40|$|In {{evaluating}} such {{a complex}} phenomenon as tax system {{one has to}} resolve some problems. The largest one {{is that there has}} not been created a method for evaluating tax system that would be acceptable to most of the tax theorists and practitioners: it is difficult to define clearly measurable parameters for ever changing criteria of tax system evaluation. Having systematized the suggestions for evaluating tax system contained in specialized literature, there has come to light three methods of essentially different contents: 1) classical principles of taxation with their characteristic indices, 2) V. Tanzi's qualification diagnostic indicators, 3) J. B. S. Gill's diagnostic indicators. Every one of these methods allows us to evaluate different aspects of tax system. Generalized evaluation as to the application of these methods is as follows: 1) the analysis of tax system according to classical principles of taxation allows us to evaluate in quantitative terms the implementation of each principle, however such an autonomous, unrelated to the totality, examination of the principles limits comparative analysis of tax systems and does not provide us with a possibility to evaluate an entire tax system; 2) answers according to V. Tanzi's qualification diagnostic indicators give us a generalized evaluation of tax system, however this (as well as any other) qualitative evaluation has quite some subjectivity; 3) the analysis according to J. B. S. Gill's diagnostic indicators is purposefully orientated to reveal aspects limiting the collection of state revenue through <b>taxation,</b> all the <b>elements</b> of tax system only being examined through the prism of tax collection, ignoring other principles of taxation; 4) only a combination of all the three groups of methods and this only replenished with some specific evaluations would be a suitable methodological basis for exhaustive and objective evaluation of tax system's efficiency by way of their comparison and diagnosis of shortcomings, so {{that as a result of}} such examination we would be able to propose well-founded decisions aimed at reforming tax system and increasing its efficiency...|$|R
