5|$|In 1999, Croatia sued Yugoslavia {{before the}} International Court of Justice (ICJ), {{claiming}} genocide {{had been committed}} in Vukovar. Following Serbia and Montenegro's dissolution in 2006, this suit was passed on to Serbia. In February 2015, the ICJ ruled that the battle and ensuing massacre did not constitute genocide, but affirmed <b>that</b> <b>serious</b> crimes had been committed by the JNA and Serb paramilitaries.|$|E
5|$|Tropical Storm Gert struck {{just south}} of where Category 3 Hurricane Emily had struck, and where Tropical Storm Bret hit in late June. As a result, there were {{concerns}} <b>that</b> <b>serious</b> flooding and mudslides would result due to saturated ground. As a precaution, about 1,000people were evacuated from low-lying residences and businesses near the towns of Naranjos Amatlán and Tamiahua in Veracruz, and about 6,000 throughout Tamaulipas.|$|E
5|$|Also in March 1941, 91 Squadron moved in, {{equipped}} with Spitfires. Additional dispersals and fighter pens {{as well as}} three new blister hangars were built during 1941. Typhoons were based at Lympne from March 1942 to February 1944 {{to counter the threat}} posed by the Luftwaffe's newly introduced Focke-Wulf Fw 190s and a runway was extended across Otterpool Lane to accommodate the Typhoons. In November 1944, Lympne was downgraded to Emergency Landing Ground status. Consideration was given to building four runways at Lympne, with the longest being , but it was noted <b>that</b> <b>serious</b> demolition work would be required and a number of roads would need to be closed.|$|E

5|$|By {{the first}} decade of the 20th century, a number of {{business}} entities had formed themselves into trusts, which dominated their industries. Trusts often sought to purchase or otherwise neutralize their competitors, allowing the conglomerates to raise prices to high levels. In 1890, Congress had passed the Sherman Anti-Trust Act, but it was not until the Theodore Roosevelt administration (1901–09) <b>that</b> <b>serious</b> efforts were made to break up or control the trusts. The dominant force in the oil industry was Standard Oil, controlled by John D. Rockefeller. Modern-day Exxon, Mobil, Atlantic Richfield, Chevron, Sohio, Amoco and Continental Oil all trace their ancestry to various parts of Standard Oil.|$|E
5|$|During {{this time}} the church at Llanbadarn Fawr {{gradually}} declined, as the population of Aberystwyth dramatically outgrew the original settlement, {{and more and more}} chapels of ease became independent parish churches. By the mid-nineteenth century the fabric of the church had also deteriorated to such an extent <b>that</b> <b>serious</b> remedial work was deemed necessary. Unfortunately, although necessary, this work also swept away much of the detail of the interior of the church. Today, apart from the Celtic crosses and the baptismal font there is nothing mediaeval or even early modern; most of what is visible today is nineteenth century, apart from the structure of the church, and some earlier monuments.|$|E
5|$|In February 2015, at the {{conclusion}} of the Croatia–Serbia genocide case, the International Court of Justice (ICJ) dismissed a Serbian lawsuit which alleged that Operation Storm constituted genocide, ruling that Croatia did not have the specific intent to exterminate the country's Serb minority, though it reaffirmed <b>that</b> <b>serious</b> crimes against Serb civilians had taken place. The court also found that the HV left accessible escape routes for civilians. According to the judgement, Serb civilians fleeing their homes, as well as those remaining in UN protected areas, were subject to various forms of harassment by both the HV and Croatian civilians. On 8 August, a refugee column was shelled.|$|E

5|$|Despite {{these small}} reforms, the 18th century ended with {{continuous}} and unrestrained {{attacks on the}} Court. Although complaints had been common {{since the time of}} Elizabeth I, the problems had become more unrestrained, {{at the same time as}} politically neutral law reformers first arose in any great number. Many critics were barristers of the common law, ignorant of the court's workings, but some, such as Sir Samuel Romilly, had trained as a Chancery advocate and were well aware of the Chancery's procedure. The success of the Code Napoleon and the writings of Jeremy Bentham are seen by academic Duncan Kerly to have had much to do with the criticism, and the growing wealth of the country and increasing international trade meant it was crucial that there be a functioning court system for matters of equity. While the upper classes had been struggling with the Court for centuries, and regarded it as a necessary evil, the growing middle and merchant classes were more demanding. With increasing court backlogs, it was clear to many law reformers and politicians <b>that</b> <b>serious</b> reform was needed.|$|E
5|$|Some {{had said}} that the {{database}} might lead to self-fulfilling prophecies, where children from difficult backgrounds were treated as potential delinquents. The government was accused of using the public's response {{to the death of}} Victoria Climbié to force through the unpopular proposal and to curb civil liberties. There were concerns that the database would undermine child protection and parents, weakening the power of parents to look after children, and would 'do more harm than good'. The sheer size of the database could have meant <b>that</b> <b>serious</b> cases would be overlooked due to the abundance of minor incidents. There were doubts towards the government’s estimate {{of the cost of the}} database. The information commissioner estimates it at £1bn, which Hodge said was 'absurd', and others raised concerns over the cost, noting that government projects tend to go over-budget. Some questioned children’s ability to give informed consent in their own right. Mary Marsh, chief executive of the NSPCC, wanted the database to cover the whole of the United Kingdom, not just England and Wales, saying 'the information held would be only partial and potentially worse than useless'. On 27 June 2006, a child protection conference, 'Children: Over Surveilled, Under Protected', held at the London School of Economics, reached the conclusion that the database would do nothing to prevent child abuse, and that it would undermine parents' ability to look after their children.|$|E

Newport County's matches against Barnet on 3 September and Morecambe on 10 December were abandoned at half-time because the pitch was waterlogged and the English Football League stepped in to help identify the problem.|$|E
