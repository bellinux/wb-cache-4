25|$|IM and ID DNA {{delivery}} initiate immune responses differently. In the skin, keratinocytes, fibroblasts and Langerhans cells take up {{and express}} antigens and {{are responsible for}} inducing a primary antibody response. <b>Transfected</b> Langerhans cells migrate out of the skin (within 12 hours) to the draining lymph node where they prime secondary B- and T-cell responses. In skeletal muscle striated muscle cells are most frequently <b>transfected,</b> but seem to be unimportant in immune response. Instead, IM inoculated DNA “washes” into the draining lymph node within minutes, where distal dendritic cells are <b>transfected</b> and then initiate an immune response. <b>Transfected</b> myocytes seem {{to act as a}} “reservoir” of antigen for trafficking professional APCs.|$|E
25|$|When {{a cancer}} bladder cell line, T24P, {{which does not}} express H19 was <b>transfected</b> with a DNA {{construct}} expressing the H19 gene {{under the control of}} the cytomegalovirus promoter, many changes were seen in the resulting cells when compared to both the original T24P cell line and a H19-antisense DNA construct <b>transfected</b> T24P cell line. While there was no difference in proliferation in 10% FCS (normal condition) between the 3 cell lines, when grown in 0.1% FCS (starved serum), the H19-transfected cells maintained their rate of growth while both the control and the antisense H19 <b>transfected</b> cells decreased their rate of proliferation by approximately 50%.|$|E
25|$|Studies using {{chimeric}} mice {{have shown}} that antigen is presented by bone-marrow derived cells, which include dendritic cells, macrophages and specialised B-cells called professional antigen presenting cells (APC). After gene gun inoculation to the skin, <b>transfected</b> Langerhans cells migrate to the draining lymph node to present antigens. After IM and ID injections, dendritic cells present antigen in the draining lymph node and <b>transfected</b> macrophages {{have been found in}} the peripheral blood.|$|E
40|$|Rescue of {{wild-type}} markers from <b>transfecting</b> phage DNA in cómpetent Haemophilus influenzae cells by superinfection with temperature-sensitive phage (marker rescue) {{is approximately}} linearly {{dependent upon the}} concentration of <b>transfecting</b> DNA. The amount of marker rescue with a constant amount of <b>transfecting</b> DNA increases with increasing multiplicities of superinfecting phage up to about 4, and then decreases at higher multiplicities. Host restriction of <b>transfecting</b> DNA does not affect marker rescue. The frequency of wild-type recombinants from marker rescue {{is much greater than}} that from multiple infection with whole phages, and is comparable to that obtained with two mutant-transfecting DNAs. The amount of marker rescue decreases exponentially with time between entrance of the <b>transfecting</b> DNA and superinfection, and the rate of decrease is independent of map position of the rescued marker. Marker rescue is drastically reduced in the recombination-defective strains, rec 1 and rec 2...|$|R
40|$|Sperm and {{trophoblast}} {{are among}} the few nucleated human cells that do not express HLA class I antigens. DNA methylation, which is proposed to be a tight mechanism of regulation, {{may be necessary to}} turn off these genes. We have investigated the transfectability of HLA class I genes and of the genes for the T-cell differentiation antigens Leu- 1 (CD 5) and Leu- 2 (CD 8) in mouse L cells by using human sperm cells and choriocarcinoma cell lines, tumors of trophoblastic origin, as sources of DNA. It was found that DNA from one choriocarcinoma line (JAR) does not <b>transfect</b> genes for HLA, Leu- 1, or Leu- 2 and that DNA from two other choriocarcinoma lines (BeWo and Ima) <b>transfects</b> only some of the surface markers. Sperm DNA <b>transfects</b> genes for all the surface antigens tested except Leu- 1. DNA from control cells and from the line SCH <b>transfects</b> all the markers studied. Southern blots show that all cell types contain apparently intact genes encoding HLA, Leu- 1, and Leu- 2 and reveal differences in the DNA methylation patterns of genes from different sources of DNA. We treated JAR (the cell line with the lowest <b>transfecting</b> ability) with 5 -azacytidine and obtained demethylation of its DNA. This demethylated DNA <b>transfects</b> genes for both HLA class I antigens and Leu- 2. Further culture of JAR cells in the absence of 5 -azacytidine results in remethylation of their DNA and decreased ability to <b>transfect</b> these surface antigens. These findings indicate that DNA methylation affects the efficiency of transfection of surface antigen genes in L cells...|$|R

25|$|Initially, the DNA of {{interest}} {{needs to be}} isolated to provide a DNA segment of suitable size. Subsequently, a ligation procedure is used where the amplified fragment is inserted into a vector (piece of DNA). The vector (which is frequently circular) is linearised using restriction enzymes, and incubated with the fragment {{of interest}} under appropriate conditions with an enzyme called DNA ligase. Following ligation the vector with the insert of interest is <b>transfected</b> into cells. A number of alternative techniques are available, such as chemical sensitivation of cells, electroporation, optical injection and biolistics. Finally, the <b>transfected</b> cells are cultured. As the aforementioned procedures are of particularly low efficiency, {{there is a need}} to identify the cells that have been successfully <b>transfected</b> with the vector construct containing the desired insertion sequence in the required orientation. Modern cloning vectors include selectable antibiotic resistance markers, which allow only cells in which the vector has been <b>transfected,</b> to grow. Additionally, the cloning vectors may contain colour selection markers, which provide blue/white screening (alpha-factor complementation) on X-gal medium. Nevertheless, these selection steps do not absolutely guarantee that the DNA insert is present in the cells obtained. Further investigation of the resulting colonies must be required to confirm that cloning was successful. This may be accomplished by means of PCR, restriction fragment analysis and/or DNA sequencing.|$|E

40|$|DNA duplexes with {{or without}} {{mismatches}} and {{with or without}} adenine-methylated GATC sequences were prepared from separated strands of bacteriophage lambda DNA and used to <b>transfect</b> Escherichia coli. Unmethylated heteroduplexes containing one or more repairable mismatches <b>transfect</b> cells with a functioning mismatch repair system less efficiently than they <b>transfect</b> cells deficient in mismatch repair. No difference is observed when the duplexes contain no mismatch or a poorly repaired mismatch or when the heteroduplexes are fully or hemimethylated. These results and the phenotypes of E. coli dam mutants suggest that the E. coli mismatch repair system may introduce double-strand breaks in unmethylated DNA at or near repairable mismatches...|$|R
50|$|HEK 293 {{cells are}} {{straightforward}} {{to grow in}} culture and to <b>transfect.</b> They {{have been used as}} hosts for gene expression. Typically, these experiments involve <b>transfecting</b> in a gene (or combination of genes) of interest, and then analyzing the expressed protein. The widespread use of this cell line is due to its transfectability by the various techniques, including calcium phosphate method, achieving efficiencies approaching 100%.|$|R
25|$|The λ-red recombineering {{system was}} {{published}} in 2000 and allows for insertion, deletion, or mutations to E. coli genes. In this system, the red operon from bacteriophage λ is <b>transfected</b> into E. coli cells to facilitate incorporation of linear target DNA into the E. coli genome. The bacteriophage λ-red operon consists of the exo, bet, and gam genes which, together, are responsible for recombineering. Phage λ exonuclease (exo) degrades <b>transfected</b> linear target DNA from the 5’ end. Beta binds to the resulting single stranded 3’ end and incorporates it into the target DNA to form the recombinant DNA. Phage λ gamma is necessary to inhibit E. coli nuclease activity and protect the transformed linear DNA in vivo.|$|E

25|$|Once {{the fusion}} {{proteins}} and controls {{have been designed}} and generated in their appropriate expression system, the plasmids must be <b>transfected</b> into the cells to be studied. After transfection, one must wait, typically about eight hours, to allow time for the fusion proteins to interact and their linked fluorescent reporter protein fragments to associate and fluoresce.|$|E
25|$|Saturation {{analysis}} {{is used in}} various types of tissues, such as fractions of partially purified plasma from tissue homogenates, cells <b>transfected</b> with cloned receptors, and cells that are either in culture or isolated prior to analysis. Saturation binding analysis can determine receptor affinity and density. It requires that the concentration chosen must be determined empirically for a new ligand.|$|E
25|$|Densin-180 {{is another}} {{important}} synaptic protein found to interact with CNKSR2. It is known to bind at its C-terminal PDZ domain. In <b>transfected</b> cells, no association could be found between PSD95 and Densin-180 without the presence of CNKSR2. This brings it into a complex with CamKII and β-catenin, and further to the binding partners of CNKSR2 suggest that CNKSR2 may {{have a role in}} dendritic branching.|$|E
40|$|Strains of Bacillus subtilis 168 {{lysogenic}} for bacteriophage phi 105 transfer with {{deoxyribonucleic acid}} (DNA) isolated from bacteriophage SPO 2 {{at a higher}} efficiency than non-lysogenic strains. This enhancement of transfection was {{not the result of}} recombination between bacteriophages SPO 2 and phi 105. Superinfection marker rescue increased transfection with DNA from bacteriophage phi 105 occurred simultaneously with the addition of the <b>transfecting</b> DNA. Again, this enhancement of transfection was not the result of recombination but rather a protection of the <b>transfecting</b> DNA by the superinfecting bacteriophage. The ability of the superinfecting bacteriophage to protect the <b>transfecting</b> DNA from inactivation was maximal when the bacteria were just becoming competent. Bacteriophage phi 1 cannot replicate after the transfection of competent bacteria lacking a functional DNA replication system, whereas bacteriophage phi 1 was able to replicate after infection of competent bacteria grown under comparable conditions. These observations support the hypothesis that GAPase and an inducible repair system {{play an important role in}} the development of competence...|$|R

40|$|DNA was {{extracted}} from T 5 and BF 23 phage carrying amber mutations in genes A 2, A 1, or D 9 and tested {{for its ability}} to <b>transfect</b> su minus spheroplasts. DNA from T 5 am 231, defective in gene A 2, <b>transfects</b> Escherichia coli su minus recB minus spheroplasts with an efficiency of 16 % of that of wild-type T 5 DNA, whereas DNA from T 5 am 16 d or BF 23 am 57, both defective in gene A 1 or its equivalent, <b>transfects</b> E. coli su minus recB minus spheroplasts with an efficiency of 1. 4 % of that of wild-type T 5 DNA, provided E. coli su+ bacteria is used as the indicator in all cases. More than 95 % of the progeny from the am 231, am 16 d, and am 57 DNA that <b>transfects</b> su minus recB minus spheroplasts is still amber mutant. From these efficiencies of transfection we conclude that the product of gene A 2 functions mainly in the mechanism of transfer of phage DNA to intact host cells, and that this function is not essential for transfection of spheroplasts. We also conclude that gene A 1 controls functions in addition to DNA transfer, in agreement with previous studies which show that mutations in gene A 1 have a pleiotropic effect. Apparently, the absence of these additional functions controlled by gene A 1 leads to a high frequency of abortive infection. DNA from amber mutants defective in either gene A 1 or A 2 does not appreciably <b>transfect</b> su minus rec+ spheroplasts, indicating that the products of these two genes may both be needed to protect T 5 DNA from the very active rec BC nuclease in spheroplasts...|$|R

40|$|Branched polyethylenimine (PEI) chains with {{an average}} {{molecular}} mass of 2 kDa (PEI 2) have been covalently attached to gold nanoparticles (GNPs), and the potency of the resulting PEI 2 –GNPs conjugates as vectors for the delivery of plasmid DNA into monkey kidney (COS- 7) cells {{in the presence of}} serum in vitro has been systematically investigated. The transfection efficiencies vary {{as a function of the}} PEI/gold molar ratio in the conjugates, with the best one (PEI 2 –GNPII) being 12 times more potent than the unmodified polycation. This potency can be further doubled by adding amphiphilic N-dodecyl–PEI 2 during complex formation with DNA. The resulting ternary complexes are at least 1 order of magnitude more efficient than the 25 -kDa PEI, one of the premier polycationic gene-delivery vectors. Importantly, although unmodified PEI 2 <b>transfects</b> just 4 % of the cells, PEI 2 –GNPII <b>transfects</b> 25 %, and the PEI 2 –GNPII/dodecyl–PEI 2 ternary complex <b>transfects</b> 50 % of the cells.

25|$|The final known {{associated}} gene is EFHC1, {{which is}} poorly understood. EFHC1 has three DM10 domains (themselves of unknown function) and an EF hand motif, {{which is known}} to bind intracellular calcium. EFHC1 is expressed in many tissues, including the brain, where it is localized to the soma and dendrites of neurons, particularly the hippocampal CA1 region, pyramidal neurons in the cerebral cortex, and Purkinje cells in the cerebellum. There are 5 mutations in EFHC1 associated with JME; D210N, F229L, D253Y, P77T and R221H. The last two mutations were originally detected as a pair in the same individual. EFHC1 seems {{to be involved in}} programmed cell death as EFHC1 <b>transfected</b> cells have a higher rate of apoptosis. This rate is decreased by the double mutations P77T + R221H. Wild-type EFHC1 increased the R-type calcium channel currents in <b>transfected</b> cells. This stimulation is decreased by JME associated mutations. Because of this, programmed cell death is decreased and the pruning of unwanted neurons may be hampered. As with some other loci, mutations in EFHC1 is not a common loci for JME. More recently, R221H has been found without P77T in one JME kindred.|$|E
25|$|Plasmids are {{engineered}} {{to produce a}} protein product in which the DNA-binding domain (BD) fragment is fused onto a protein while another plasmid is {{engineered to}} produce a protein product in which the activation domain (AD) fragment is fused onto another protein. The protein fused to the BD may {{be referred to as}} the bait protein, and is typically a known protein the investigator is using to identify new binding partners. The protein fused to the AD may be referred to as the prey protein and can be either a single known protein or a library of known or unknown proteins. In this context, a library may consist of a collection of protein-encoding sequences that represent all the proteins expressed in a particular organism or tissue, or may be generated by synthesising random DNA sequences. Regardless of the source, they are subsequently incorporated into the protein-encoding sequence of a plasmid, which is then <b>transfected</b> into the cells chosen for the screening method. This technique, when using a library, assumes that each cell is <b>transfected</b> with no more than a single plasmid and that, therefore, each cell ultimately expresses no more than a single member from the protein library.|$|E
