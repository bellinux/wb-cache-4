50|$|In {{all cases}} the {{anisotropic}} material, for example, a <b>thermosetting</b> <b>resin</b> containing conductive particles, is first deposited {{on the base}} substrate. This may be done using a lamination process for ACF, or either a dispense or printing process for ACP. The device or secondary substrate is then placed in position over the base substrate and {{the two sides are}} pressed together to mount the secondary substrate or device to the base substrate. In many cases this mounting process is done with no heat or a minimal amount of heat that is just sufficient to cause the anisotropic material to become slightly tacky. In the case of using a <b>thermosetting</b> <b>resin</b> containing conductive particles, the particles are trapped between prominent points, such as electrodes, between the substrate and the component, thereby creating an electrical connection therebetween. Other particles are insulated by the <b>thermosetting</b> <b>resin.</b> In some cases this mounting step is skipped and the two sides go directly to the bonding portion of the process. In high volume manufacturing, however, this would lead to inefficiencies in the manufacturing process, so direct bonding is usually done only in the lab or in small scale manufacturing.|$|E

5000|$|Similar {{to other}} formaldehyde-based <b>thermoset</b> <b>resins,</b> thermal {{behavior}} of the polymer {{is a function of}} the CH2O/ADN ratio employed in the synthesis. [...] Melting point was found to increase with increasing synthesis CH2O/ADN ratio, along with apparent increase in cross-linking, and reduction in crystallinity. Additionally, spectral features of 1H-NMR of nylon 1,6 samples were found to trend with CH2O/ADN synthesis ratio as well. Collectively, these properties parallel those of other formaldehyde-based <b>thermoset</b> <b>resins,</b> and it is interesting that nylon 1,6 is a rare example of a polyamide <b>thermoset</b> <b>resin</b> rather than a thermoplastic material.|$|R

40|$|In {{our efforts}} {{to create a more}} {{sustainable}} society, several researchers have tried to prepare composites from renewable materials in recent years. The use of natural fibres for reinforcement of composites has been relatively well studied. To date, most studies of natural fibre-reinforced composites have either involved the use of conventional <b>thermoset</b> <b>resins</b> or thermoplastic biopolymers. While there are currently several thermoplastic polymers on the market that are produced from renewable resources, thermosets are inevitably produced from petroleum resources. The development of biobased <b>thermoset</b> <b>resins</b> is therefore of considerable importance. Such resins could be used in future for composite applications, for coating applications or in adhesives. This thesis describes the development of biobased <b>thermoset</b> <b>resins</b> for composite applications. <b>Thermoset</b> <b>resins</b> were synthesised from both epoxidised soybean oils as well as from lactic acid. These resins have been characterised neat as well as together with various reinforcements. The main objective has been to study these biobased resins together with natural fibres for reinforcement, though to some extent nano-reinforcements and glass fibres have also been used as reinforcements. Natural fibre-reinforced composites were prepared from several different biobased <b>thermoset</b> <b>resins.</b> Resins based on soybean oil as well as a resin based on lactic acid were evaluated. The soybean resins were prepared by introducing acrylate or methacrylate groups into the molecules of soybean oil. The second type of <b>thermoset</b> <b>resin</b> used was based on lactic acid. This resin consists of star-shaped methacrylated oligomers of lactic acid. Natural fibres were impregnated by several impregnation techniques. Composites were prepared from the biobased resins together with various natural fibres, such as flax and hemp fibres. The resulting composites were evaluated by tensile testing, flexural testing, impact testing, DMTA and SEM. The results show that composites prepared from biobased resin have relatively good mechanical properties and can be used for indoor applications such as furniture and construction elements...|$|R

40|$|International audienceWe {{present a}} method to improve the impact damage {{tolerance}} of <b>thermoset</b> <b>resin</b> matrix composites by exploiting thermoplastic material impact resistance properties. Two configurations of thermoplastic/thermoset multilayer composites are considered: (a) thermoplastic material is used on sample surface as shock absorber and (b) thermoplastic film is inserted in between thermoset layers to act as interlayer. We aim at increasing adhesion strength between thermoplastic and <b>thermoset</b> <b>resin</b> matrix. We show that mode I critical strain energy release rate, determined by the wedge double cantilever beam fracture test, increases significantly when a third amorphous polymer interlayer compatible with both thermoplastic and <b>thermoset</b> <b>resin</b> is inserted. The analysis of scanning electron microscope fracture surfaces helps us to clarify the adhesion mechanism involved. The high adhesion between thermoplastic and <b>thermoset</b> <b>resins</b> obtained with this method, together with the ability of thermoplastics to dissipate the impact damage in the first plies ensure the reliability of this stacked configuration. Finally, we show that these multilayer composite significantly increases the impact resistance of composite materials...|$|R
