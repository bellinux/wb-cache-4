25|$|Medicine in the monasteries was {{concentrated}} on assisting {{the individual to}} return to normal health. Being able to identify symptoms and remedies was the primary focus. In some instances identifying the symptoms led the monastic clergy <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> into consideration {{the cause of the}} illness in order to implement a solution. Research and experimental processes were continuously being implemented in monasteries to be able to successfully fulfill their duties to God to take care of all God's people.|$|E
25|$|The canal {{was a very}} {{efficient}} way of moving large amounts of heavy goods cheaply and with minimal labor. But White and Hazard had single-handedly spurred canal construction {{up and down the}} East Coast by taming the Lehigh River with navigations in less than two years, and four years ahead of promises to investors. Unfortunately, the northern canals would freeze in the winter, and their towpaths were muddy in spring and late fall. This made it impractical for a burgeoning mill town that needed year-round freight transportation, but if LC Co. was putting monies into railroads, other businessmen were going <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> a hard careful look. With steamboat tugs proven on the Merrimack and Middlesex Canal themselves, and news of railroads building in Europe and now, the United States, investors would need to adopt new techniques sooner or miss opportunities.|$|E
25|$|After the funeral, Kōichi, Shige and Keizō leave immediately, {{with only}} Noriko not returning. After they leave, Kyōko is angry {{with them and}} voices her {{complaints}} to Noriko about her siblings by deriding them over being selfish to their family. She believes that Kōichi, Shige and Keizō don't care {{how hard it was}} for their father when he lost their mother. Kyōko believes that strangers and even Noriko would've been more respectful towards her. Noriko responds that while she understands Kyoko's disappointment with her siblings, she also explains that everyone has their own life to lead and that the drift between parents and children is inevitable. She convinces Kyoko not to be too harsh on her siblings because one day she too will understand how hard it is for them <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> time from both their families and their own lives.|$|E

When a colleague is stuck in an elevator with his feet dangling out of the doors, Ling asks, [...] "Does this mean I'm going <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> the stairs?" [...] She is impatient in getting what she wants, for example snapping at a judge to [...] "hurry up" [...] as he read a verdict. [...] She frequently announces that she is uninterested in proceedings that don't affect her personally. As her co-counsel questions a witness in court, Ling objects to the judge, [...] "I'm bored! As {{an officer of the}} court, I have a duty to be open and forthright. I think the witness is tedious and I'm concerned for the jury's attention span." ...|$|E
500|$|Unlike the {{majority}} of his contemporaries, Simpson was open about the use of drugs in professional cycling. In 1960, interviewed by Chris Brasher for The Observer newspaper, Simpson spoke about his understanding of how riders could beat him, saying: [...] "I know from the way they ride the next day they are taking dope. I don't want <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> it– I have too much respect for my body." [...] Two years before his death, Simpson hinted in the newspaper, The People, at drug-taking in races, although he implied that he himself was not involved. Asked about drugs by Eamonn Andrews on the BBC Home Service radio network, Simpson did not deny taking them; however, he said that a rider who frequently took drugs might get to the top but would not stay there.|$|E
500|$|After {{touring the}} {{disaster}} area, Florida Governor Reubin Askew noted, [...] "I think we're going <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> a long, {{close look at}} some of the construction [...] Some of the structures simply won't be able to be built back in the exact location where they were." [...] Governor Askew recruited 400 National Guard troops to prevent looting following the storm. He also requested the initial declaration of five counties along the Florida panhandle as national disaster areas, and stated that he would consider adding two more counties. The declaration would make residents in the counties recognized as disaster areas eligible to receive federal aid. Immediately following the storm, the mayor of Panama City criticized the state of Florida for failing to provide sufficient post-storm aid. Despite the destruction, the storm reportedly had some economic benefits; in the midst of rebuilding and recovery, business grew, especially in and around Panama City, and people began to move into the area. In at least one instance, the hurricane and its associated storm surge had a lasting effect on local geography, breaching Crooked Island in Bay County to create an inlet [...] wide referred to as Eloise Inlet. Eloise provided a comprehensive base of information on beach and dune erosion along the Florida panhandle, which aided in the programming of certain erosion prediction numerical models. In 1995, reports from the aftermath of Hurricane Opal created a more extensive collection of data.|$|E

2500|$|In {{spite of}} Romani's {{contract}} deadlines, no progress towards {{the preparation of}} the libretto for Beatrice took place in November. Bellini announced that he would arrive in Venice in early December, but after the 10th, he became preoccupied with rehearsals for his stagings of Norma. [...] However, the lack of any verses—for an opera which was supposed to be given its premiere {{in the second half of}} February—caused him <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> action against Romani. He lodged a complaint with the governor of Venice who then contacted the governor of Milan, who then had his police contact Romani. The librettist finally arrived in Venice on 1 January 1833. He holed up to write Bellini's libretto, but, at the same time, Donizetti was equally incensed at delays in receiving a libretto from Romani for an opera which was to be Parisina.|$|E

2500|$|Pershing {{wrote in}} his {{autobiography}} that [...] "The bodies [...] were publicly buried in the same grave with a dead pig." [...] This treatment was used against captured juramentado so that the Moro would believe they would be going to hell. Pershing added that [...] "it was not pleasant [...] <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> such measures". [...] Historians {{do not believe that}} Pershing was directly involved with such incidents, or that he personally gave such orders to his subordinates. [...] Letters and memoirs from soldiers describing events similar to this do not have credible evidence of Pershing having been personally involved. [...] Similarly, the claim made by Donald Trump during his presidential campaign in February 2016 that Pershing executed 49 [...] "Muslim terrorists" [...] with bullets dipped in pig's blood, then let the 50th go free to spread the word about the religious atrocity, which Trump alluded to again while serving as president in August 2017, has been repeatedly debunked by historians, who find no evidence that such an incident occurred.|$|E
2500|$|Bellini's {{expectation}} that Romani's good will would be demonstrated promptly, {{turned out to}} be a mistake. [...] The librettist had vastly over-committed himself: by the time that Cristina became Beatrice, he had made commitments to Mercadante for an October opera; also to Carlo Coccia for an opera for La Scala on 14 February 1833; and further, to Luigi Majocchi for a Parma production on 26 February; to Mercadante for La Scala on 10 March; and to Donizetti for Florence on 17 March. Nothing happened in November; Bellini announced that he would arrive in Venice in early December and after 10th, he became preoccupied with rehearsals for Norma. [...] However, the lack of any verses—for an opera which was supposed to be staged in the second half of February—caused him <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> action against Romani.

2500|$|Game Six {{as always}} {{the regular season}} game of all games. Possibly the toughest and deepest rivalry in the league, ever {{certainly}} {{of the last decade}} sporting 16 shamrock bowl appearances between them in the past ten years, with 5 appearances against each other at the big stage, the Rebels currently winning the ShamrockBowl shootout 3-2, they took the lead in last year's final when they narrowly defeated the Vikings to become champions taking the lead by one point in the fourth quarter thanks to a touchdown by Sam Hodgins... very similar in every sense to the Vikings dramatic 1 point victory over Leylstad thanks to a fourth-quarter touchdown by Adrian Garvey in 2010. While this game was no bowl it still had significant meaning. Both teams at this stage were undefeated at 5-0 and the winner was sure to go on and top their division to secure a home semi final, the loser would be almost guaranteed <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> the hard route to the semi's being forced to play another game and then face an away semi final against most likely the Belfast Trojans (who also managed to go undefeated in the reg season in the northern division).|$|E
