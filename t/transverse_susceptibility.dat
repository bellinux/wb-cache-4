40|$|A novel {{resonant}} method {{based on}} a tunnel-diode oscillator (TDO) is used to study the dynamic <b>transverse</b> <b>susceptibility</b> in a Fe nanoparticle system. The magnetic system consists of an aggregate of nanometer-size core (Au) -shell (Fe) structure, synthesized by reverse micelle methods. Static and dynamic magnetization measurements carried out in order to characterize the system reveal a superparamagnetic behavior at high temperature. The field-dependent <b>transverse</b> <b>susceptibility</b> at radio-frequencies (RF), for different temperatures reveals distinct peak structure at characteristics fields (H_k, H_c) which changes with temperature.

Computer simulations are an invaluable tool in the development and testing of models of these media. Presented here are several computer simulations of particulate recording media, based on models of their microscopic behaviour. The simulations were used to probe the macroscopic behaviour of the systems and relate this to the microscopic models used. The four areas covered are: Time dependence in magnetic systems. A refinement of an established model of a perpendicular thin film. Results have been obtained for the logarithmic time dependence of the magnetisation together with the temperature dependence of both the remanent magnetisation and the viscosity coefficient.
