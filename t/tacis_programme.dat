However, progress in EU-Belarus relations stalled in 1996 after serious setbacks to the development of democracy, and the Drazdy conflict. The EU did not recognize the 1996 constitution, which replaced the 1994 constitution. The Council of the European Union decided against Belarus in 1997: The PCA was not concluded, nor was its trade-related part; Belarusian membership in the Council of Europe was not supported; bilateral relations at the ministerial level were suspended and EU technical assistance programs were frozen.|$|E

50|$|The {{many foreign}} {{advisers}} from, principally, the United States, the United Kingdom and Sweden were often {{under contract to}} the international financial institutions and bilateral or multilateral technical assistance programmes. They favoured free trade and exchange rate convertibility rather than trade protection and capital controls, which might have checked capital flight. They tended to support privatization without prior industrial restructuring; an exception was {{to be found in}} Eastern Germany where the Treuhand (Trust Agency) prepared state-owned enterprises for the market at considerable cost to the government. Western technical assistance programmes were established by European Union - through the Phare and <b>TACIS</b> <b>programmes</b> - and other donors (including the US AID, the UK Know-how Fund and UNDP) and by the IMF, the World Bank, EBRD and KfW, which also advanced loans for stabilization, structural adjustment, industrial restructuring and social protection.

40|$|How do {{economic}} policies and institutions affect job reallocation processes and their consequences for productivity growth? This paper studies the extreme case of economic system change and alternative transitional {{policies in the}} former Soviet Republics of Russia and Ukraine. Exploiting annual industrial census data from 1985 to 2000, we find that Soviet Russia displayed job flow behavior quite different from market economies, with very low rates of job reallocation that bore little relationship to relative productivity across firms and sectors. Since liberalization began, the pace, heterogeneity, and productivity effects of job flows have increased substantially. The increases occurred more quickly in rapidly reforming Russia than in “gradualist ” Ukraine, as did the estimated effects of privatization and competitive pressures from product and labor markets on excess job reallocation and on the productivity-enhancing effects of job flows. We thank Natalia Akhmina, Serhiy Biletsky, and Alexander Scherbakov for help with the data, and Dietrich Earnhart, John Haltiwanger, Joanne Lowery, Mark Schaffer, Almos Telegdy, and participants in an IZA-WDI Confer ence in Manuel Antonio and in workshops in Kalamazoo and Riga for valuable comments on earlier drafts.

Initially, the TACIS was only a kind of support given {{within the framework of}} technical assistance. However, in the course of twelve years of its functioning, it became a complex system of cooperation of different East European and Central Asian countries with the European Communities, inclusive of political cooperation. In 1991. 1999 the aid under the <b>TACIS</b> <b>programme</b> was granted to the East European and Central Asian countries as support to different areas (defined by the Council Regulation No. 99 / 2000) in the following proportions: nuclear safety and environment protection (20 %), restructuring of the stateowned industry sector and development of the private sector (14 %), reform of the government administration, reforms of the social security system and the education system (15 %), agriculture and food supply (8 %), energy (9 %), transportation (7 %), telecommunications (1 %), consulting and small projects (6 %), other such as society democratization programmes (6 %), servicing and coordinating the utilization of the <b>TACIS</b> <b>programme</b> funds (14 %). Apart fromthe above-mentionedmain assistance areas, also regional cooperation programmes, with special regard to transborder regional cooperation and twin-cities programmes, were financed under the <b>TACIS</b> <b>programme.</b> Also, under the impact of the Tshernobyl nuclear plant failure, programmes for nuclear safety improvement in this region of the world were financed within the framework of TACIS.

40|$|Nuclear Safety in Europe {{is one of}} the EU's primary concerns, {{therefore}} the EU decided to take a prominent role to help the New Independent States and countries of Central and Eastern Europe {{to ensure the safety of}} their nuclear reactors. The EU <b>TACIS</b> and PHARE <b>programmes</b> in nuclear safety have been undertaken since 1991. The European Commission's Directorate General External Relations (EC DG RELEX) and Directorate General EuropeAid Co-operation Office (EC DG AIDCO), are responsible for programming and management of implementation of TACIS projects. DG Enlargement (EC DG ELARG) is responsible for programming PHARE programmes, but implementation of most projects has been deconcentrated and decentralised to the Beneficiary Countries. In these activities the TSSTP Unit at the JRC/IE in Petten, The Netherlands, is the technical and scientific adviser of above mentioned EC Directorates General. Several PHARE projects aiming at improving nuclear safety have been successfully implemented for a number of plants from Central and Eastern Europe. In some cases major safety issues have been addressed by means of multi-country projects and results have been disseminated to the rest of the nuclear community. Although a lot of information has been exchanged at a bilateral level, further effort is needed to collect the project results in a systematic way and make them available by means of the internet. At present the TSSTP Unit is implementing two projects for dissemination of PHARE project results. This activity will take a better advantage of today's communication technologies and ensure the management of the acquired knowledge through preservation and user-friendly access and retrieval of the project results. The paper provides an outline of the TSSTP Unit relevant knowledge preservation initiative, a description of the web-based informatics platform used to support the dissemination of PHARE project results, and summarizes the results from the major PHARE Nuclear Safety projects.

Thermal-Hydraulic (T-H) related projects have also been executed to enhance nuclear safety of European Union (EU) candidate countries and countries from the former Soviet Union. These have been financed in the past via the PHARE and <b>TACIS</b> nuclear safety <b>programmes</b> which are now {{coming to an end}} and are now substituted by new EU financial instruments such as IPA and INSC. All the information is being currently gathered in specific databases. The EURATOM research framework programmes have financed in the past many multipartner projects in the T-H field for both experimental and for code validation purposes which have been performed either directly by the Joint Research Centre (JRC) of the European Commission (EC) or indirectly by multi-partner projects. The current direct research activity in the field of T-H is mainly performed by two units of the JRC: the Safety of Present Nuclear Reactors (SPNR) and Safety of Future Nuclear Reactors (SFNR) units, both located in the JRC Institute for Energy (IE) based in the Netherlands. The main activities are performed within the European Union's Seventh Research Framework Programme in specific actions such as POS, NUSAC, CAPTURE, AMA, FANGS which involve several tasks such as: performing T-H calculations for Generation IV (GEN-IV) reactors, drafting EUR reports on specific topics, delivering training, performing dissemination of results, hosting and co-sponsoring conferences, seminars, etc. In the past, the JRC located in Ispra, Italy has performed extensive experimental research on the T-H facilities, now dismantled.

The first is tasked with identifying the most important challenges currently hampering spatial integration within the region and between the region and its surroundings as well as with pinpointing the most important elements for a spatial strategy or vision with a time horizon up to the year 2030. The intention here is to approve the Long Term Perspective (LTP) at the VASAB Ministerial Conference in September 2009. The second policy paper with DG Regio in the lead has as its aim to coordinate the efforts of various actors in the Baltic Sea Region so that by working together they promote a more balanced development of the region. The Strategy will be presented to the European Council in June 2009 and will feature as one of the main priorities of the Swedish EU Presidency {{during the second half of}} 2009. The ongoing EU level debate, launched by the European Commission's Green Paper (October 2008) on Territorial Cohesion is also connected to this process.

40|$|The purpose {{with this}} essay {{was to examine}} how the European Union is working to {{transfer}} norms to states they {{signed an agreement with}} and provide support for in frame of the Barcelona process and the <b>Tacis</b> <b>programme.</b> The theory which we used was Ian Manners (PhD in Political Science) theory of "the EU as a unique normative power". The aim was to examine whether the EU - which Manners mean - has had a normative power to influence states to change. We used a qualitative approach {{through the use of a}} multiple case study and qualitative text and content analysis. The States which formed the basis of our study were within the Barcelona Process; Morocco and Tunisia as well as Azerbaijan and Armenia funded by the <b>Tacis</b> <b>programme.</b> To this end, we were to answer the following questions: Can we identify transfer of norms in the written bilateral agreements with these states, and are there any normative demands? Can we on the basis of our study answer whether the EU holds a normative power to influence these countries to change, in accordance with the normative theory? The agreements that we studied was the bilateral agreements that the EU signed with these States. In order to make Manners five norms (peace, freedom, democracy, rule of law and human rights), which he argues that EU is based on measurable; we used the Freedom House freedom index, and also by a historical study the development of the country. The results we found were the following; in all the studied bilateral agreements we found clear - but to varying degrees - the transfer of norms. Although it differs in degree of regulatory requirements and also in the formulation of how the country is committed to abide by and comply with the normative requirements differ according to the agreements, we can find the so-called "carrot and stick relationship" that Manners believes that the EU use in the transfer of norms. Three of the states that we investigated under the Freedom House freedom index did not developed in a democratic way did, and the positive steps taken cannot be directly traced back to the EU's efforts. It may also be due to other States or other forces influence. We can’t, through our study confirm that Manners is right in these states but we can’t either rule out the possibility that the EU through the written agreements has changed the norms of the state in question, although progress seems to go very slowly...|$|E

In these programmes, EC-Joint Research Center (JRC) is the Technical & Scientific adviser of above mentioned EC Directorates. During the years of Tacis assistance activities in nuclear safety quite a few programs were dedicated to the Reactor Pressure Vessel (RPV) embrittlement issue. The ageing of the RPV was of special concern due to the faster than expected neutron irradiation embrittlement of the core region weld of the VVER 440 NPPs and some shortcomings of the RPV surveillance program in VVER 1000 NPPs. Most of the Tacis ageing projects were so far dedicated to studying the RPV embrittelement and integrity issue. In this paper highlights from some completed Tacis projects on the RPV embrittelment and integrity issue have been selected and briefly described.

40|$|This thesis {{provides}} {{an examination of}} the key determinants of industrial company failure in the UK and Russia, for the 1990 s. For the UK, some new empirical evidence, presented for the 1990 s recession period, is based on binary logit analyses of a cross-section and unbalanced panel of large quoted companies, using accounting-based indicators. Conventional for cross sectional studies empirical design of modelling the failure determinants separately for various risk-horizons, prior to the event of insolvency, is extended here by allowing for unanticipated changes in the nominal interest rate and in the real exchange rate, and also by controlling for the firm's age effect. We find that cross sectional models, conditioned on changes in overall economic conditions, dominate simpler models, utilising financial inputs alone, for comparisons of ex ante, out-of sample classificatory accuracy. Thus, the UK data suggest that for the years before and during the 1990 s recession, shifts in the real exchange rate and rises in the nominal interest rate magnified dramatically the risk of failure of highly geared firms. The estimates from the fixed effects models indicate substantial unobserved heterogeneity across members of the panel and reveal that failing UK companies were less liquid, lacked profitability, and had declining net worth. For Russia, the evidence from binary logit is bootstrap-based and controlled by comparison with a similar random sample drawn for the UK over the recession years 1990 - 91. The Russian data uncover that, unlike in the UK, gearing and liquidity did not appear to explain enterprise liquidation in the mid- 1990 s, while lower profitability and smaller size were the key determinants of failure risk.

40|$|Since 1991, the European Commission¿s <b>TACIS</b> <b>programme</b> {{has been}} an {{instrument}} for providing Technical Assistance to the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) {{for the promotion of}} the economic reform and recovery of ex-Soviet countries. In the field of Nuclear Safety, the program aims at transferring Western safety culture, know how and technology and is facilitating the sharing of experience by the implementation of projects in areas like On Site Assistance, Design Safety, Regulatory Authorities, Safeguards and Waste. More than ¿ 1. 1 billion have been allocated to the Nuclear Safety programmes in the Beneficiary countries Russia, Ukraine, Armenia and Kazakhstan since their beginning. The European Commission Directorate General (DG) External Relations (DG-RELEX) is responsible for the strategy and the indicative multi-annual programs, the DG Europe Aid Co-operation Office (DG-AIDCO) {{is in charge of the}} annual action programs through which the individual assistance projects are identified and implemented. The DG Joint Research Centre (DG-JRC) is the Technical & Scientific adviser of the above-mentioned EC Directorates. In the field of Nuclear Power Plant (NPP) fire safety, TACIS projects include supplies of passive and active fire protection equipment to NPPs under the On-site Assistance Projects, studies under the Design Safety Projects as well as support to Regulatory Bodies. This paper presents an overview of the projects, carried out over a decade. Furthermore, the paper describes the background, objectives and achieved results of a number of representative projects in more detail. It also illustrates some of the difficulties experienced in meeting the needs and expectations of the Beneficiary side respecting at the same time all the legal and financial rules of the TACIS program. Finally, the paper summarizes some lessons learnt as well as issues that remain open. JRC. F. 5 -Safety of present nuclear reactor...|$|E

40|$|Large {{quantities}} of {{spent nuclear fuel}} (SNF) and radioactive waste coming from the nuclear submarines and other nuclear powered ships have been accumulated in the former naval base at Andreeva Bay (Kola Peninsula, Murmansk Region). The Andreeva Bay site accumulating approximately 22, 000 spent nuclear fuel assemblies is currently considered the largest storage facility in North-West of Russia. Nowadays storage conditions do not meet safety requirements and prospectively pose serious environmental and proliferation issues. In the beginning of year 2000, the control over the storage site {{was transferred to the}} State Corporation for Atomic Energy “Rosatom”. It was soon realised that the engineering infrastructure was almost completely inoperable and needed restoration and replacement. In addition, most documentation of nuclear material characteristics was missing and some Spent Fuel Assemblies (SFA) are likely to be damaged to some extent. Starting in 2002 after the G 8 Global Partnership summit in Kananaskis, a considerable number of international cooperation projects are running to remediate the Andreeva Bay infrastructure, aiming at the safe removal of SFA for reprocessing. The Andreeva Bay programme is supported by international donors from (a) United Kingdom Department for Energy and Climate Change (DECC), (b) Northern Dimension Environmental Partnership Fund (the EBRD), (c) Italy (Ministry of Economic Development of the Italian Republic), (d) Norway (Norwegian Radiation Protection Authority - NRPA and Finnmark county governor), (e) Sweden (Swedish Radiation Safety Authority - SSM) and (f) European Commission (<b>TACIS</b> <b>Programme</b> – Technical Assistance to the Community of Independent States). In agreement with all the stakeholders the European Commission identified three areas for development and funding: (i) nuclear materials automated accounting and control system (NMAA&CS), (ii) gamma scanning unit for nuclear materials characterization prior to SNF transportation and (iii) provision of canisters for the safe transportation of spent fuel assemblies. The paper starts with a brief introduction to the Andreeva Bay programme, its overall objective, organisation and contributions from all stakeholders. The paper then details the contributions and progress of the projects funded by the European Commission in the field of Nuclear Material Accountancy and Control. JRC. E. 8 -Nuclear securit...|$|E
40|$|Since 1995 {{with the}} {{ratification}} {{and enforcement of}} the Non Proliferation Treaty in the Republic of Kazakhstan, the Kazakhstan Atomic Energy Committee (KAEC) {{is responsible for the}} implementation of the State System for Accountancy and Control (SSAC). In the SSAC, data on nuclear material inventories are periodically collected on individual nuclear facilities and stored into the KAEC data base, from which reports are prepared for the IAEA in accordance with the Safeguards Agreement between IAEA and Kazakhstan. Corresponding to the Agreement on Nuclear Safety between Euratom and Kazakhstan a programme on Nuclear Safeguards under TACIS (Technical Assistance for the Commonwealth of Independent States) was launched that should enhance the effectiveness of the present state system. After evaluating the different nuclear facilities in Kazakhstan with KAEC, the following facilities have been identified with a need for enhancing safeguards in methodology and instrumentation: -	the Ulba Fuel Fabrication Plant in Ust-Kamenogorsk -	the research reactors of the Nuclear National Center at the Alatau and Baikal- 1 sites. Mainly, in the first facility, the Ulba plant, a scanning system for accurate, near-real time monitoring of the level and density in multiple tanks have been provided for an enhanced follow-up of the process and in particular the nuclear material flow. The automatic fusion of the data with analysis and interpretation is addressed in a future subsequent project for near real time accountancy at Ulba. Additionally, at the identified facilities a review camera station enhanced the surveillance and complemented the physical protection of the research reactors. Finally, the <b>TACIS</b> <b>programme</b> provided the beneficiary KAEC via the Nuclear Technology Safety Center with informatics equipment and data architecture for modernising the data collection and analysis of the nuclear material accountancy and control. Moreover with the expanding Kazak nuclear activities in particular the new nuclear power plant under design and construction, and the increasing tasks of KAEC also in the safety field, an automatic system for the analysis can help substantially KAEC in its reporting to IAEA under its future Additional Protocol agreement on all nuclear material and its transfers.
