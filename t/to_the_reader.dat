Grey had the force and the power and could have {{destroyed}} the towns on the island in half a day, and would have done so if they had resisted in any way. In the diary, September 12th and 13th are omitted. Those were the days when the British troops were ravaging the island from Edgartown to Gay Head.|$|E
5|$|June Kim, {{the author}} and {{illustrator}} for 12 Days, primarily drew the artwork in the realism style, although she occasionally rendered characters as super-deformed versions of themselves. While the cover art incorporates red and silver coloring, the artwork primarily appears in black and white, with occasional gray shading. Kim used pen and ink as the artistic medium, then toned her art with the software application ComicStudio. For the narrative, she explores the characters' pasts through dreams, and periodic, nonlinear flashbacks. Several character traits, such as Jackie's chocolate allergy, are presented <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>reader</b> through inference rather than exposition. Additionally, Kim uses a brief, untranslated Korean song alongside the predominantly English text.|$|E
5|$|The Wrongs of Woman usually uses third-person narration, {{although}} large {{sections of}} Maria's and Jemima's tales are in first-person narrative. The narrator often relates Maria's feelings <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>reader</b> through the new technique of free indirect discourse, which blurs {{the line between the}} third-person narrator and the first-person dialogue of a text. Wollstonecraft juxtaposes the events of the novel with both Maria's own retelling of them and her innermost feelings. The first-person stories allow Maria and Jemima to address each other as equals: their stories of suffering, while still allowing each character to retain an individualized sense of self, are a levelling and bonding force between the two.|$|E

5|$|The codex {{consists}} of parchment, originally in double sheets, {{which may have}} measured about 40 by 70cm. The whole codex consists, with a few exceptions, of quires of eight leaves, a format popular throughout the Middle Ages. Each line of the text has some twelve to fourteen Greek uncial letters, arranged in four columns (48 lines per column) with carefully chosen line breaks and slightly ragged right edges. When opened, the eight columns thus presented <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>reader</b> have much the same appearance as the succession of columns in a papyrus roll. The poetical books of the Old Testament are written stichometrically, in only two columns per page. The codex has almost 4,000,000 uncial letters.|$|E
5|$|The first {{character}} introduced <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>reader</b> is a {{girl named}} Lola, who shares a college dormitory room with five other girls, including the narrator. Lola records her experiences in a diary, relating her efforts {{to escape from the}} totalitarian world of school and society. She rides the buses at night and has brutish, anonymous sex with men returning home from factory work. She also has an affair with the gym teacher, and soon joins the Communist Party. This first part of the book ends when Lola is found dead, hanging in the closet; she has left her diary in the narrator's suitcase.|$|E
5|$|In 1973, the {{publishing}} company Robert Hale brought out Valiente's second book, An ABC of Witchcraft, {{in which she}} provided an encyclopaedic overview of various topics related to Wicca and esotericism. In 1975, Hale published Valiente's Natural Magic, a discussion of what she {{believed to be the}} magical usages and associations of the weather, stones, plants, and other elements of the natural world. In 1978 Hale then published Witchcraft for Tomorrow, in which Valiente proclaimed her belief that Wicca was ideal for the dawning Age of Aquarius and espoused James Lovelock's Gaia hypothesis. It also explained <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>reader</b> how they could initiate themselves into Wicca and establish their own coven. In 1978 she offered a book of poetry to Hale, although they declined to publish it, believing that there would not be sufficient market for such a publication. In 1982 she then submitted a book of short stories, The Witch Ball, to Hale, but again they declined to publish it.|$|E

5|$|In {{contrast}} to the individualistic Roark, Peter Keating is a conformist who bases his choices on what others want. Introduced <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>reader</b> as Roark's classmate in architecture school, Keating does not {{really want to be}} an architect. He loves painting, but his mother steers him toward architecture instead. In this as in all his decisions, Keating does what others expect rather than follow his personal interests. He becomes a social climber, focused on improving his career and social standing using a combination of personal manipulation and conformity to popular styles. He follows a similar path in his private life: He chooses a loveless marriage to Dominique instead of marrying the woman he loveswho lacks Dominique's beauty and social connections. By middle age, Keating's career is in decline and he is unhappy with his path, but it is too late for him to change.|$|E

5|$|Narayan's {{greatest}} {{achievement was}} making India {{accessible to the}} outside world through his literature. He is {{regarded as one of the}} three leading English language Indian fiction writers, along with Raja Rao and Mulk Raj Anand. He gave his readers something to look forward to with Malgudi and its residents and is considered to be one of the best novelists India has ever produced. He brought small-town India to his audience in a manner that was both believable and experiential. Malgudi was not just a fictional town in India, but one teeming with characters, each with their own idiosyncrasies and attitudes, making the situation as familiar <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>reader</b> as if it were their own backyard. In 2014, Google commemorated Narayan's 108th birthday by featuring a doodle showing him behind a copy of Malgudi Days.|$|E

5|$|Richardson's Pamela, the {{prototype}} for the sentimental novel, is a didactic love {{story with a}} happy ending, written at a time women were beginning {{to have the right}} to choose husbands and yet were restricted by social conventions. Austen attempted Richardson's epistolary style, but found the flexibility of narrative more conducive to her realism, a realism in which each conversation and gesture carries a weight of significance. The narrative style utilises free indirect speech – she was the first English novelist to do so extensively – through which she had the ability to present a character's thoughts directly <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>reader</b> and yet still retain narrative control. The style allows an author to vary discourse between the narrator's voice and values and those of the characters.|$|E
5|$|The Financial Times {{poll was}} the result of over 10,000 {{respondents}} to nearly 23000 electronic questionnaires of alumni from 155 qualifying business schools. The survey began in July 2006 and all internationally accredited programs that are at least five years old and that have produced at least 30 graduates {{in each of the last}} three years were solicited. 113 of the 155 had at least 20 respondents and at least a 20 percent response rate. The questionnaire used twenty criteria in three main areas. The poll actually presents all twenty criteria <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>reader.</b> Eight criteria are based on alumni responses; eleven criteria are based on business school responses, and the final criterion is based on a research index produced by the Financial Times. The survey responses are audited by KPMG.|$|E
5|$|The Years of Rice and Salt is an {{alternate}} history novel written by science fiction author Kim Stanley Robinson {{and published in}} 2002. The novel explores how world history {{might have been different}} if the Black Death plague had killed 99% of Europe's population, instead of a third. Divided into ten parts, the story spans hundreds of years, from the army of the Muslim conqueror Timur to the 21st century, with Europe being re-populated by Muslim pioneers, the indigenous peoples of the Americas forming a league to resist Chinese and Muslim invaders, and a 67-year-long world war being fought primarily between Muslim states and the Chinese and their allies. While the ten parts take place in different times and places, they are connected by a group of characters that are reincarnated into each time but are identified <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>reader</b> by the first letter of their name being consistent in each life.|$|E

5|$|The novel {{has eight}} chapters, narrated {{by each of}} the three main {{characters}} in turn. Davidson narrates chapters 1, 4, and 7; Selver narrates chapters 2, 6, and 8; and Lyubov narrates chapters 3 and 5. This alternation emphasizes both the differences between the characters and their isolation within their societies. Lyubov and Davidson's chapters are narrated from a limited omniscient point of view, making their chapters seem like internal monologues. Davidson's belief in the inferiority of the Athsheans and his adversarial attitude towards the planet are directly presented <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>reader,</b> along with Lyubov's struggle to do his job dispassionately while following his personal morality. In contrast, Selver's chapters are written from a truly omniscient point of view, allowing Le Guin to give the reader information about the planet and its people. Selver has no extensive monologues; instead, several other Athsheans also feature prominently in his chapters.|$|E
