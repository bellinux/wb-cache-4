2500|$|Several Iraqi leaders, Lebanese arms {{merchant}} Sarkis Soghanalian {{and others}} have claimed that Saddam financed Chirac's party.

We have now grasped {{the reality of the}} situation. If the trickery continues, we will be forced to unmask them, all of them, before the French public." [...] France armed Saddam and it was Iraq's largest trade partner throughout Saddam's rule. Seized documents show how French officials and businessmen close to Chirac, including Charles Pasqua, his former interior minister, personally benefitted from the deals with Saddam.|$|E
