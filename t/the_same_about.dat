5|$|The {{belief that}} certain animals cannot rise if pushed over has {{historical}} antecedents, though cattle {{have never been}} so classified. Julius Caesar recorded a belief that a European elk (moose) had no knee joints and could not get up if it fell. Pliny said <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>about</b> the hind legs of an animal he called the achlis, which Pliny's 19th-century translators Bostock and Riley said was merely {{another name for the}} elk. They also noted that Pliny's belief about the jointless back legs of the achlis (elk) was false.|$|E
5|$|The film also explores father-son relationships, {{not only}} between Michael Sullivan and his son, but between Sullivan and his boss, John Rooney, and between Rooney and Connor. Sullivan {{simultaneously}} idolizes and fears Rooney, and Sullivan's son feels <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>about</b> his own father. Rooney's son, Connor, {{has none of}} Sullivan's redeeming qualities, and Rooney is conflicted about whom to protect: his biological son or his surrogate son. Connor is jealous of his father's relationship with Sullivan, which fuels his actions, ultimately causing a domino effect that drives the film.|$|E

25|$|IM6, IM7, etc. are {{trade names}} for {{particular}} graphite {{produced by the}} Hexcel Corporation. These numbers are not industry standards nor an indication of quality, especially since other companies use the designations to refer to graphite not made by Hexcel. At best, they allow you to compare {{the quality of the}} material used to build different rods by the same manufacturer: an IM7 rod would use better graphite than an IM6 rod if both are made by the same manufacturer. It is more difficult to say <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>about</b> rods from two different companies, since they could be made from material from completely different manufacturers.|$|E
25|$|The {{first edition}} of this book {{prompted}} many curious letters from irate readers. The most violent letters came from Reichians, furious because the book considered orgonomy alongside such (to them) outlandish cults as dianetics. Dianeticians, of course, felt <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>about</b> orgonomy. I heard from homeopaths who were insulted to find themselves in company with such frauds as osteopathy and chiropractic, and one chiropractor in Kentucky “pitied” me because I had turned my spine on God’s greatest gift to suffering humanity. Several admirers of Dr. Bates favored me with letters so badly typed that I suspect the writers were in urgent need of strong spectacles. Oddly enough, most of these correspondents objected to one chapter only, thinking all the others excellent.|$|E

25|$|An {{official}} campaign, The Golden Gift, {{was released}} as a download on Microsoft's website. The campaign follows {{the adventures of}} Brokk and Eitri, the dwarves who appeared in the initial campaign. The plot unfolds with both dwarves planning to create a giant golden boar as an offering to the Norse god Freyr. While working separately, Brokk is approached by Skult (also from Fall of the Trident) who warns him that Eitri is making preparations to create the boar without his brother, of which Eitri is also told <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>about</b> Brokk. As both brothers race to complete the boar in the great forge, Skult steals the finished piece and holds it in Loki's fortress. The brothers eventually assault the base, and the boar is retrieved and successfully offered to Freyr.|$|E

500|$|Foraker was {{initially}} {{convinced of the}} guilt of the men, but reconsidered after evidence obtained in a private investigation by progressive organizations was presented to him (the black attorney presenting it was denied an audience with Roosevelt). [...] According to Roosevelt biographer Edmund Morris, [...] "Foraker had a passion for racial justice." [...] Recalling Foraker's desire, as a soldier, to see slavery abolished and the black man given the same {{civil and political rights}} as the white man, Morris explains, [...] "Senator Foraker merely felt <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>about</b> the Constitution in 1906 as Private Foraker had felt in 1862." [...] In addition to his desire to see justice done, Foraker also saw political advantage in opposing Roosevelt over the Brownsville issue; he might boost his own presidential ambitions for 1908 by making both Roosevelt and his designated heir apparent, Secretary of War William Howard Taft, look bad.|$|E

500|$|Though Jervis {{clearly had}} a strong impact during the Napoleonic Wars and {{afterwards}} {{on the development of}} the Navy, surprisingly few contemporary biographies of Jervis are available, and those are seriously lacking in breadth and thoroughness. The most recent work related to Jervis is The Remaking of the English Navy by Admiral St. Vincent: The Great Unclaimed Naval Revolution by Charles Arthur, 1986, but this focused more on Jervis's reforms to the docks, and less to other parts of his life. Evelyn Berkman's Nelson's Dear Lord: Portrait of St. Vincent (1962), as the bibliographer Eugene Rasor points out, is merely an [...] "effort" [...] to create a biography. The same bibliographer says much <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>about</b> William Milbourne James's [...] "Old Oak": The Life of John Jervis, Earl St. Vincent (1950) and Owen Sherrard's A life of Lord St. Vincent (1933), pointing to both as mediocre.

It officially premiered on Vevo on April 30, 2010. On working with Williams {{and the new}} looks she developed in the video, Aguilera stated, [...] "...someone with {{that much of a}} catalog under his belt and success as a video maker, he's like a legend. So again entering into the collaborating factor, I didn't know what to expect ... and he's probably thinking <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>about</b> me. And when we walked away from working with each other, it was just a love connection. I wanted to maintain and keep consistent with the look of the album packaging and book, and I really wanted to keep all that in line, and so he really paid attention, and I think it's really iconic and classic. We totally made magic together on a creative level, it was absolutely amazing. He really got in and listened to where my music was at".|$|E

Randy, however, ignores her, and starts performing tween wave music at the local bowling alley under the name [...] "Steamy Ray Vaughn", with defecation {{as part of the}} act. During a duet with a woman billing herself as [...] "Steamy Nicks", Sharon catches Randy at the bowling alley, resulting in an argument. She excoriates him for the various schemes and fads that he has often briefly taken with over the years, such as getting into fights at baseball games, playing World of Warcraft, and becoming a celebrity chef, but Randy reveals that he is unhappy, and has been for a long time. The two agree that while they are both unhappy, they do not feel <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>about</b> each other any more. Two old farmers, who previously watched Randy perform, overhear the argument and break into the Marshes' home to steal Randy's underwear, believing that they are acting humanely on its behalf.|$|E

Burt loves Kurt, and openly accepts his son after Kurt tells him that he is gay in the show's fourth episode, [...] "Preggers". Murphy took the scene verbatim from his own experience of coming out to his father. He called the father-son relationship [...] "One of the stories that we really love on the show", and one that is [...] "very personal" [...] to him, as he wishes his own father had acted more like Burt. During the first season, Kurt has cause to wonder whether his father truly accepts him. Colfer offered the insight that his character is [...] "more concerned with being OK in his dad's eyes than with anyone else", and said that the bond between them would continue to strengthen as the series progressed. From O'Malley's point of view, [...] "There's a lot at stake in their relationship and [...] trying to show other people how it can be, in a positive way. I'm not saying hey, let's go to Greenwich Village and be in the parade. This is very very difficult, but he loves his son." ...|$|E
500|$|The hearing {{took six}} days, {{finishing}} on 18 February 2008, with the judgment being made public on 17 March 2008. Mills was eventually awarded {{a lump sum}} of £16.5m, together with assets of £7.8m, which included the properties she owned at the time. The total was £24.3million (nearly $50 million in US currency,) plus payments of £35,000 per annum, for a nanny and school costs for their daughter. In his judgment, Justice Bennett [...] stated: [...] "The husband's evidence was, in my judgment, balanced. He expressed himself moderately though at times with justifiable irritation, if not anger. He was consistent, accurate and honest. But I regret {{to have to say}} I cannot say <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>about</b> the wife's evidence. Having watched and listened to her give evidence, having studied the documents, and having given in her favour every allowance for the enormous strain she must have been under (and in conducting her own case) I am driven to the conclusion that much of her evidence, both written and oral, was not just inconsistent and inaccurate but also less than candid. Overall, she was a less than impressive witness." [...] Regarding her career, the judge said: [...] "I find that, far from the husband dictating to and restricting the wife's career and charitable activities, he did the exact opposite. He encouraged it and lent his support, name and reputation to her business and charitable activities. The facts as I find them do not in any way support her claim." [...] In anger at the judgment, Mills threw a pitcher of water on the head of Fiona Shackleton, McCartney's solicitor, in the courtroom.|$|E
