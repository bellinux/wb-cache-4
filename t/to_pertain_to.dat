5|$|Originally, {{the rocks}} in which Carnotaurus was found were {{assigned}} to {{the upper part of the}} Gorro Frigio Formation, which was considered to be approximately 100 million years old (Albian or Cenomanian stage). Later they were realized <b>to</b> <b>pertain</b> <b>to</b> the much younger La Colonia Formation, dating 72 to 69.9 million years ago (Late Cretaceous, Lower Maastrichtian stage). Thus, Carnotaurus was the latest South American abelisaurid known. By the Late Cretaceous, South America was already isolated from both Africa and North America.|$|E

5|$|In a 1980 article, Argentine {{zoologist}} Elio Massoia {{recognized the}} resemblance between Winge's Hesperomys molitor and Hershkovitz's Holochilus magnus, and {{recommended that the}} former be reclassified as a species of Holochilus, Holochilus molitor. When American zoologists Voss and Carleton restudied Winge's material in a 1993 paper, {{they were unable to}} find any consistent differences between the two and accordingly considered them <b>to</b> <b>pertain</b> <b>to</b> the same species. In addition, they reviewed the differences between this species and other Holochilus and concluded that these were significant enough to place the former in a distinct genus, which they named Lundomys after Lund, who had collected the original material. Since then, the species has been known as Lundomys molitor.|$|E
5|$|No Apatosaurus skull was {{mentioned}} in literature until the 1970s when John Stanton McIntosh and David Berman redescribed the skulls of Diplodocus and Apatosaurus. They found that {{though he never}} published his opinion, Holland was almost certainly correct, that Apatosaurus had a Diplodocus-like skull. According to them, many skulls long thought <b>to</b> <b>pertain</b> <b>to</b> Diplodocus might instead be those of Apatosaurus. They reassigned multiple skulls to Apatosaurus based on associated and closely associated vertebrae. Even though they supported Holland, {{it was noted that}} Apatosaurus might have possessed a Camarasaurus-like skull, based on a disarticulated Camarasaurus-like tooth found at the precise site where an Apatosaurus specimen was found years before. On October20, 1979, after the publications by McIntosh and Berman, the first true skull of Apatosaurus was mounted on a skeleton in a museum, that of the Carnegie. In 1998 it was suggested that the Felch Quarry skull that Marsh had included in his 1896 skeletal restoration instead belonged to Brachiosaurus. In 2011 the first specimen of Apatosaurus where a skull was found articulated with its cervical vertebrae was described. This specimen, CMCVP7180, was found to differ in both skull and neck features from A.louisae, but shared many features of the cervical vertebrae with A.ajax. Another well-preserved skull is Brigham Young University specimen 17096, a well-preserved skull and skeleton, with a preserved braincase. The specimen was found in Cactus Park Quarry in western Colorado.|$|E

In winter quarters, they are rarely found on the open seashore, preferring {{estuaries}} and lakes. They cross deserts and mountains but avoid the open ocean on migration. But stray birds, often blown off course by hurricanes, have been seen in the Caribbean. In Colombian territory it has been recorded first on February 22, 1997, on the San Andrés Island, where they might have been swept by Hurricane Marco which passed nearby in November 1996. Since then, there have also been a few observations likely <b>to</b> <b>pertain</b> <b>to</b> this species on the South American mainland, e.g. at Calamar.|$|E

500|$|The {{roof was}} {{originally}} covered with sheet lead and adorning the roof are stone warriors and other figures, {{similar to those}} of Raby, Alnwick and the gates of York. Originally there were four figures on each corner turret and bartizan; only five have survived. Between the central towers once stood a sculpture of a knight in combat with a serpent (of which only fragments survive), believed <b>to</b> <b>pertain</b> <b>to</b> the tale of the Lambton Worm. The parapet is also machicolated (except on the north façade) and continued between the central towers by a carved-foliage arch (originally with cusping which fell in 1882), instead of corbels. Another feature of the roof was shallow stone [...] on the battlements which fed scalding oil or water into the machiocaltions as a means of defence. In a small chamber in each turret or bastion, a brazier was kept burning to bring the liquids to a suitable temperature.|$|E

2500|$|The Basilica of St. Ursula in Cologne {{holds the}} alleged relics of Ursula and her 11,000 companions.

[...] The Goldene Kammer (Golden Chamber), a 17th-century chapel attached to the Basilica of St. Ursula, contains sculptures of their heads and torsos, [...] "some of the heads encased in silver, others covered with stuff of gold and caps of cloth of gold and velvet; loose bones thickly texture the upper walls." [...] The peculiarities of the relics themselves have thrown doubt upon the historicity of Ursula and her 11,000 maidens. When skeletons of little children ranging in age from two months to seven years were found buried with one of the sacred virgins in 1183, Hermann Joseph, a Praemonstratensian canon at Steinfeld, explained that they were distant relatives of the eleven thousand. A surgeon of eminence was once banished from Cologne for suggesting that, among the collection of bones which are said <b>to</b> <b>pertain</b> <b>to</b> the heads, there were several belonging to full-grown mastiffs.

40|$|This {{paper is}} a general course on the {{analysis}} of stability and bifurcation for dissipative systems.

Stability and non-bifurcation criteria are given for the generalized standard models of plasticity in the light of Hill's discussions. The second main issue <b>to</b> be addressed <b>pertains</b> <b>to</b> the stability analysis for a solid with internal damage or multiple cracks. In brittle fracture or brittle damage, the evolving equations for the crack lengths or for the damage papaneters are time-independent as in plasticity and leads to similar mathematical considerations on stability and bifurcation analysis...|$|R
