25|$|A 1996 {{report from}} the European Commission {{predicted}} that Kent and Nord-Pas de Calais had to face increased traffic volumes due to general growth of cross-Channel traffic and traffic attracted by the tunnel. In Kent, a high-speed rail line to London would <b>transfer</b> <b>traffic</b> from road to rail. Kent's regional development would benefit from the tunnel, but being so close to London restricts the benefits. Gains are in the traditional industries and are largely dependent {{on the development of}} Ashford International passenger station, without which Kent would be totally dependent on London's expansion. Nord-Pas-de-Calais enjoys a strong internal symbolic effect of the Tunnel which results in significant gains in manufacturing.|$|E
25|$|Speaking at {{the first}} Gatwick Airport Consultative Committee (Gatcom) meeting since GIP's {{takeover}} of the airport (held on 28 January 2010 at Crawley's Arora Hotel), Gatwick's chairman Sir David Rowlands ruled out building a second runway for the foreseeable future, citing {{the high cost of}} the associated planning application – estimated to be between £100million and £200million – as the main reason for the new owners' lack of interest. At that meeting, Gatwick chief executive Stewart Wingate stressed GIP's preference for increasing the existing runway's capacity and confirmed GIP's plans to request an increase in the current limit on the permitted number of take-offs and landings. However, in 2012, Gatwick's new owners reversed their initial lack of interest in building a second runway at the airport for the foreseeable future. On 3 December 2012, chief executive Stewart Wingate argued in front of the House of Commons Transport Select Committee that allowing Gatwick to add a second runway to relieve the growing airport capacity shortage in the South East of England once the agreement with West Sussex County Council preventing it from doing so had expired in 2019 served the interests of the 12million people living in its catchment area better than building a third runway at Heathrow or a new four-runway hub airport in the Thames Estuary. In support of his argument, Wingate stated that expanding Heathrow or building a new hub in the Thames Estuary was more environmentally damaging, more expensive, less practical and risked negating the benefits of ending common ownership of Gatwick, Heathrow and Stansted by the erstwhile BAA. Wingate contrasted this with the greater range of flights and improved connectivity including to hitherto un-/underserved emerging markets that would result from a second runway at Gatwick by the mid-2020s as this would enable it to compete with Heathrow on an equal footing to increase consumer choice and reduce fares. In this context, Wingate also accused his counterpart at Heathrow, Colin Matthews, of overstating the importance of <b>transfer</b> <b>traffic</b> by pointing to research by the International Air Transport Association (IATA). This counts the number of air travel bookings made by passengers passing through the IATA-designated London area airports and shows that only 7% of these passengers actually change flights there. Wingate believes this to be a more accurate measure of the share of passengers accounted for by <b>transfer</b> <b>traffic</b> at these airports than the more widely used alternative based on survey data collated by the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA). The CAA survey data relies on the number of passengers changing flights at these airports as reported by the airlines to the airport authorities and shows that fewer than 20% of all passengers actually change flights there.|$|E

Brighton-Franklin express service ended by 1959, and the Franklin Avenue Line became a full-time shuttle in 1963.

50|$|The routes the CAA had awarded BA's {{independent}} rivals {{included the}} most profitable former British Caledonian short haul routes that had generated {{a substantial amount of}} <b>transfer</b> <b>traffic</b> for that airline's Gatwick-based scheduled operation, such as London Gatwick — Paris Charles de Gaulle and Gatwick—Brussels. It also included a number of British Caledonian's loss-making domestic routes, such as Gatwick—Glasgow, Gatwick—Edinburgh and Gatwick—Manchester, which were important feeder services for that airline's profitable long haul routes.|$|E
50|$|The {{resulting}} {{network of}} domestic, European and intercontinental long-haul scheduled services from Gatwick was a motley collection of routes. This {{made it difficult}} to develop profitable streams of <b>transfer</b> <b>traffic</b> using Gatwick as a hub. Therefore, it was a challenge to persuade people to fly to Gatwick from relatively minor places like Genoa or Jersey in order to make an onward connection at the airport to secondary places in Africa or South America, and an even greater challenge to do this profitably.|$|E
50|$|These {{bilateral}} restrictions seriously impeded BCal's {{efforts to}} successfully build {{a network of}} short-haul, European feeder services that was essential to provide sufficient <b>transfer</b> <b>traffic</b> for its long-haul routes from Gatwick. Furthermore, these restrictions {{made it difficult to}} offer its passengers a more frequent service on certain long-haul routes that could have attracted more high-yield business traffic. It also left the airline with an incomplete network, which resulted in a weak route structure. This, in turn, constituted a major competitive disadvantage.|$|E
5|$|The {{early history}} of Marylebone is tied into the Great Central Railway (GCR)'s Great Central Main Line (GCML) {{extension}} into London. When Sir Edward Watkin became chairman of the Manchester, Sheffield and Lincolnshire Railway (MS) in 1864, the line was not particularly lucrative as it had no direct connection to London. Watkin was unhappy about <b>transferring</b> <b>traffic</b> to the Great Northern Railway, and when he became chairman of the Metropolitan Railway in 1872, he decided to build a dedicated line between the MS and Central London.|$|R
50|$|Historically, Fidonet <b>traffic</b> was <b>transferred</b> mainly over serial (RS-232) modem {{connections}} {{which might}} not have an error correction layer. These dial-up-oriented protocols for <b>transferring</b> Fidonet <b>traffic</b> like EMSI or Zmodem had to implement error-recovery. When the members of Fidonet started to use TCP/IP to <b>transfer</b> Fidonet <b>traffic,</b> this error-recovery overhead became unnecessary. Assuming that the connection is reliable {{makes it possible to}} eliminate error-checking and unnecessary synchronization steps, achieving both ease of implementation and improved performance. The major advantage of binkp vs EMSI and Zmodem is achieved over connections with large delays and low bandwidth.|$|R

50|$|The Wismar-Karower railway, which {{crossed the}} main line at Blankenberg station, was opened on 14 November 1887. It had its own railway station, which at times was {{designated}} as Blankenberg Ost (east). Blankenberg thus became a small railway junction. Above all, the station served to <b>transfer</b> <b>traffic</b> towards Sternberg, Brüel, Warin and Neukloster. In 1939, for example, seven to eight pairs of trains ran on the branch line, which usually provided connections between passenger trains on the branch line and express trains on {{the main line}}.|$|E
50|$|A short stub {{remained}} {{after this}} date, extending northwards from Lowfield Junction, the line's southern {{connection with the}} Great Central Railway's Doncaster-Sheffield line just west of Conisbrough station. This section ran to sidings serving a limestone quarry operated by the Steetley Dolomite company. It saw its last main line traffic in July 1975, although it continued {{to be used as}} a link by the National Coal Board to <b>transfer</b> <b>traffic</b> between Cadeby Colliery and Denaby Main Colliery, where the N.C.B. had wagon repair facilities, until the collieries closed in 1986.|$|E

When (C-D) fails, the traffic that comes from failure (A-D) will be rerouted by C.

50|$|The most fitting {{description}} for {{the resulting}} network of domestic, European and intercontinental long haul scheduled services from Gatwick was a motley collection of routes resembling a rag bag.
