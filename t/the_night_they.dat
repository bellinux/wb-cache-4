5|$|According {{to another}} legend, two Parmars from Malwa, named Govinddas and Madhavdas, took up their haunt among the rush grass {{that covered the}} {{neighbourhood}} of the Rudra Mahalaya, and lived by plunder. There they found the foundations of a temple and Shiva linga, and said that in <b>the</b> <b>night</b> <b>they</b> had seen heavenly beings. This was told to Siddharaj {{and led to the}} erection or completion of the temple.|$|E

The first team of dogs would haul a train of two sledges, which collectively carried half {{the weight of the}} party's supplies. The remaining supplies were put on the third sledge, towed by the second dog team.|$|E

5|$|The flotilla's second {{success was}} the night of 19/20 December 1941, again in the North Sea off the Dutch coast, when two boats engaged two R boats and one E boat.

Both Hichens and {{the commander of the}} other boat received a MID for this action.|$|E
5|$|In {{the final}} two episodes, it is {{revealed}} that Wirt and Greg are actually two boys from the modern era. Wirt and Greg's strange appearance {{stems from the fact}} that <b>the</b> <b>night</b> <b>they</b> entered the Unknown was Halloween. Wirt, attempting to take back an embarrassing poetry tape he made for a girl he likes, had followed her to a graveyard scary story gathering before a police officer scared him and Greg into jumping over the cemetery's garden wall. On the other side of the wall, they landed on train tracks where Greg was almost hit by a train. Wirt pushed them both off a hill into a lake/river in an attempt to save him, knocking them both unconscious in the process and sending them to a Limbo-like realm between life and death.|$|E

5|$|The Mobile Column in the south, {{consisting}} of the Imperial Camel Brigade, the 11th Light Horse, and the mounted City of London Yeomanry Regiments (less two squadrons), advanced from Ferdan and the Ballah railhead to attack the German and Ottoman left flank, working through Bir El Mageibra, Bir El Aweidia and Hod El Bayud. They found Mageibra evacuated on 5 August. After camping there for <b>the</b> <b>night,</b> <b>they</b> fought strong hostile forces between Bayud and Mageibra the following day, but could make no impression. Some days later, on 8 August, the Mobile Column did succeed in getting round the Ottoman flank, but {{was too weak to}} have any effect and retired to Bir Bayud.|$|E
5|$|The {{pursuit of}} the Russian troops continued. On 7 February 1807, the French arrived outside the village of Eylau, as night was falling. In some confusion, the Imperial coach rumbled into the village, {{although}} the Emperor was setting up his camp a few kilometers away. The Russian patrol in the village chased off the coach driver and his men and plundered the Emperor's belongings; in turn, the Imperial escort chased them off. More and more men were sent into the engagement, {{and in the end}} the French took the village when the Russians withdrew. Both sides lost 4,000 men in the contest for the village and the Emperor's nightshirt. Settling for <b>the</b> <b>night,</b> <b>they</b> prepared to engage the next day.|$|E

At the end of <b>the</b> <b>night,</b> <b>they</b> decide their next date will be in Pawnee, and Leslie feels pressure to make their date equally exciting. While talking later with Ann (Rashida Jones), Leslie decides to host a dinner party at her home with all her interesting friends. She invites Mark (Paul Schneider), Tom (Aziz Ansari) and Ron (Nick Offerman), specifically excludes Jerry (Jim O'Heir), and asks Andy (Chris Pratt) to work as the waiter. Andy agrees, even though he hates Justin, Ann's former crush, and Mark, her current boyfriend.|$|E
5|$|Amy and Rory {{discover}} that the wounded Doctor had told his earlier self to create a diversion, allowing him to rig the Pandorica to fly into the TARDIS explosion. The Doctor postulates that enough of the original universe still exists in the Pandorica to completely restore it via the exploding TARDIS. After a tearful farewell to Amy, Rory, and River where he instructs Amy to focus on her family and Rory to restore them in the new universe, the Doctor engages the Pandorica and flies it into the exploding TARDIS. A second Big Bang occurs. The Doctor comes to consciousness and begins witnessing events in his life in reverse as {{the cracks in the}} universe close.

5|$|Approximately {{two weeks}} after {{violence}} broke out in Benghazi, Owumi {{received a call from}} his teammate Moustapha Niang, who said that Elturki would attempt to help the two players escape the country. Elturki had arranged for a car to take them to an Egyptian refugee camp in Sallum, following Al-Nasr coach Sherif Azmy. Owumi passed through several rebel checkpoints and arrived at the Egyptian border in 12 hours. Both Owumi and Niang, due to their appearance, were suspected of being foreign mercenaries fighting for Gaddafi and were subject to harsher treatment. Without proper immigration papers, Owumi was held in Sallum for three days. He was arrested and then imprisoned in solitary confinement for two hours. When he was removed, he had to sleep outside for three days. Owumi and Niang finally escaped the camp in the middle of <b>the</b> <b>night.</b> <b>They</b> bribed the driver of a bus, which only allowed Egyptian citizens, to help them leave. At around this time, Owumi received a call from Azmy, who wanted to meet him in his home in Alexandria. As a result, he convinced the driver, who was headed to Cairo, to lead them to another bus to Alexandria.|$|E

5|$|Chambers and {{his second}} in command, Captain Charles Spragg, {{immediately}} set about constructing a defensive trench across the post, and strengthening its other defences. But by now the Turks, from the 72nd Infantry Regiment, about 1,000-strong, had managed to use the terrain and darkness to close in on the position. At 22:00 Chambers reported that the position was under attack and surrounded, and at 23:35 the telephone line to headquarters was cut by the Turks. The area in front of No.3 Post was in a gully {{and out of sight}} to the defenders, so they had to climb on the trench parapet to engage the Turks. This tactic worked well, and they broke up the Turkish assault, causing the attackers some casualties. The Turks did not withdraw far, and crept up {{to the edge of the}} New Zealanders' trench during <b>the</b> <b>night.</b> <b>They</b> then threw hand grenades into the New Zealanders' position. At the same time, small arms fire from the surrounding Turkish positions pinned the New Zealanders down.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the retreat}} from Pyongtaek, the {{scattered}} 1st Battalion, 34th Infantry retreated to Chonan, where {{the rest of}} the 34th Infantry Regiment was located. L Company of the 3rd Battalion, 34th Infantry was ordered to probe north of the city and meet the advancing elements of the North Korean 4th Infantry Division which was advancing following its two victories. Dean telegraphed the command from Taejon, ordering the rest of 3rd Battalion, 34th Infantry to move up behind L Company. Former regimental commander Lovless moved north to join L Company, along with newly arrived Colonel Robert R. Martin, a friend of Dean's. Around 18:00, Dean ordered Martin to take command of the 34th Infantry Regiment from Lovless. The next morning, July 8, Dean and Walker arrived to see the outcome of the Battle of Chonan which had begun in <b>the</b> <b>night.</b> <b>They</b> discovered Martin had been killed and the regiment again defeated and fleeing in disarray. He ordered it back to the Kum River. Dean ordered {{the rest of the}} 21st Infantry to conduct one final delaying action, and in the Battle of Chochiwon from July 10–12 it delayed the North Koreans before being defeated and forced back to the Kum River.|$|E
5|$|Indiana militia leaders {{learned of}} Morgan's capture of Brandenburg, ten {{miles south of}} Corydon, and his intent to cross into Indiana in a {{dispatch}} from Regular Army commanders in Louisville. All the roads Morgan would likely take northward intersected at Corydon. Emergency requests for reinforcements were sent out from the town in all directions. New Albany leaders sent word promising to send a thousand men. Other companies around Harrison County immediately began to gather and advance to Corydon. Three companies of the 6th Regiment Indiana Legion based in Mauckport and totaling about one hundred men moved to Morvin's Landing, the north {{bank of the river}} opposite Brandenburg, to contest the crossing. A thirty-man company of the 8th Regiment of the Indiana Legion based in Leavenworth and under the command of Capt. G.W. Lyon, was transported to Morvin's landing by the Lady Pike during <b>the</b> <b>night.</b> <b>They</b> brought with them their town's ceremonial 8-pound cannon which they deployed and camouflaged on a small bluff in front of an abandoned log cabin.|$|E
50|$|At the Battle of the Teutoburg Forest, over {{a period}} of 3 days, an {{alliance}} of Germanic tribes wore down and eventually annihilated 3 Roman legions (about 16,000 to 20,000 men).

On <b>the</b> second <b>night,</b> <b>they</b> marched at <b>night</b> in an attempt to break through the encircling Germanic forces, but the Germans had already built a wall in their way, and when combat resumed the following day, the Romans were defeated.|$|R

In these stories, the ukuku redeems itself by defeating a condenado, a cursed soul, and becoming an exemplary farmer.|$|E
5|$|When Allen {{and his men}} landed above St. John and scouted the situation, {{they learned}} that a column of 200 or more regulars was approaching. Rather than attempt an ambush on those troops, which {{significantly}} outnumbered his tired company, Allen withdrew {{to the other side}} of the river, where the men collapsed with exhaustion and slept without sentries through <b>the</b> <b>night.</b> <b>They</b> were awakened when British sentries discovered them and began firing grapeshot at them from across the river. The Boys, in a panic, piled into their bateaux and rowed with all speed upriver. When the expedition returned to Ticonderoga two days later, some of the men were greatly disappointed that they had nothing to show for the effort and risks they took. The capture of Fort Ticonderoga and Crown Point proved to be crucial in the Revolutionary War because it secured protection from the British to the North and provided vital cannon for the colonial army; some even speculate that if the attempts to capture the two forts had been unsuccessful, the colonists might not have won the war.|$|E
5|$|Yellow-bellied marmots are diurnal, and {{are less}} active during <b>the</b> <b>night.</b> <b>They</b> are omnivores, but {{generally}} eat {{a wide variety of}} plants, as they are generalist herbivores.They mostly feed on grass, grains, leaves, flowers, legumes, bird eggs, and insects. Occasionally, they are also known to eat fruits and bark of fruit trees. In food choice experiments, yellow-bellied marmots are known to reject plants containing defensive compounds. Due to this, they consume flowers of lupinus, larkspur, and columbine, but avoid their shoots containing toxic compounds. Their food choice depends upon the fatty acid and protein concentrations, which are well present in cinquefoil, cow-parsnip, and leaves of dandelion, which are also present in their diet. In late summer, however, grasses, forbs, and seeds make up most of their diet. They also like to feed on alfalfa and clover. They drink less water, as their plant diet mostly serves their water requirements.|$|E
