5|$|Although the {{scientific}} discipline of astronomy has made tremendous strides {{in understanding the}} nature of the Universe and its contents, there remain some important unanswered questions.

5|$|In 1933, the {{government}} brought the UERL and the Metropolitan Railway {{together as a}} single organisation, the London Passenger Transport Board. The London Underground has since passed {{through a series of}} administrations, expanding further by <b>the</b> <b>construction</b> <b>of</b> <b>new</b> extensions and through the acquisition of existing main line routes, culminating in its current form as part of Transport for London, the capital's current transport administration, controlled by the Greater London Authority.|$|E
5|$|Increased federal {{spending}} {{as a result}} of the New Deal in the 1930s led to <b>the</b> <b>construction</b> <b>of</b> <b>new</b> government buildings, memorials, and museums in Washington. World War II further increased government activity, adding to the number of federal employees in the capital; by 1950, the District's population reached its peak of 802,178 residents.|$|E
50|$|However, <b>the</b> <b>construction</b> <b>of</b> <b>newer</b> comparably sized venues in El Paso and Tucson, {{combined}} with New Mexico's gross receipts tax on concerts and special events, {{has led to}} a significant {{decline in the number of}} events scheduled at the arena.|$|R
50|$|The {{school has}} been {{expanded}} greatly {{in the last five}} years with <b>the</b> <b>construction</b> <b>of</b> a <b>new</b> sixth form centre and the conversion of Penrhos House, originally the sixth form common room, into a Music block, as well as <b>the</b> <b>construction</b> <b>of</b> a <b>new</b> Learning Resources Centre.|$|R
50|$|On January 4, 2004, Nave de Alvalade {{sold out}} {{for the last time}} with a futsal game because, {{together}} with the old stadium, it would be demolished after <b>the</b> <b>construction</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>new</b> José Alvalade Stadium which did not contemplate <b>the</b> <b>construction</b> <b>of</b> a <b>new</b> For <b>the</b> modalities.|$|R
5|$|Much of the {{modernisation}} {{in recent}} years has centred around the Underground's rolling stock, with large scale renewals and refurbishments of existing fleets, in particular on Lines A and H. Along with this came <b>the</b> <b>construction</b> <b>of</b> <b>new</b> underground workshops and storage areas on lines A, H and E, as well as the expansion of the existing facilities on Lines B and D.|$|E
5|$|Structure 5C-45 is {{the east}} {{range of a}} palace complex that also {{incorporates}} 5C-46 (the south range) and 5C-47 (the west range). This structure was remodelled in the Terminal Classic with the closing of some doorways, addition of some benches and <b>the</b> <b>construction</b> <b>of</b> <b>new</b> sections with multiple doorways. Although Tikal was completely abandoned soon afterwards, this continuation in complex construction activity indicated that the elite residents were still inhabiting the palace at this time.|$|E
5|$|The house {{closed as}} a hostel in 2007, after the London Borough of Hillingdon chose to replace its {{temporary}} accommodation with affordable permanent housing, {{in light of}} a directive from the Government for all local authorities {{to reduce the number}} of families in temporary housing by half by 2010. Highgrove, together with six other buildings was put forward to be sold for redevelopment, with the proceeds to be invested in <b>the</b> <b>construction</b> <b>of</b> <b>new</b> housing.|$|E

5|$|The school's new {{location}} was bounded {{on the south}} by North Avenue, and on the west by Cherry Street. Peters sold five adjoining acres of land to the state for $10,000. This land was situated on what was then Atlanta's northern city limits. The act that created the school had also appropriated $65,000 towards <b>the</b> <b>construction</b> <b>of</b> <b>new</b> buildings.|$|E
5|$|A workhouse {{was built}} in Lurgan and opened in 1841 under the stipulations of the Poor Law which stated that each Poor Law Union would build a workhouse to give relief to the {{increasing}} numbers of destitute poor. In 1821 the population of Lurgan was 2,715, this increased to 4,677 by 1841. There {{were a couple of}} reasons for this large growth in population. Firstly the opportunities provided by the booming linen industry led many to abandon their meagre living in rural areas and migrate to Lurgan in the hope of gaining employment. Secondly the ever-expanding town gave tradesmen the opportunity to secure work in <b>the</b> <b>construction</b> <b>of</b> <b>new</b> buildings such as Brownlow House.|$|E

5|$|As hoped by the {{original}} promoters, {{the opening of the}} line stimulated <b>the</b> <b>construction</b> <b>of</b> <b>new</b> areas of private and public residential development throughout the 1930s, although large areas remain as parks and playing fields. The St. Helier Estate was completed in 1936. The opening of the Wimbledon to Sutton line and the C led the population of the parish of Morden, previously the most rural of the areas through which the lines passed, to increase from 1,355 in 1921 to 12,618 in 1931 and 35,417 in 1951.|$|E
5|$|As {{part of this}} scheme, in 1283 Edward ordered <b>the</b> <b>construction</b> <b>of</b> <b>new</b> castles and walled towns {{across the}} {{occupied}} territories, in part to encourage substantial migration to the region from England. Amongst these were the future World Heritage sites of Caernarfon Castle and its walled town, overlooking the River Seiont; Conwy Castle and its walled town, controlling a crossing point over the River Conwy; and Harlech Castle, protecting a sea port and newly established English town. Plans were probably made to establish a castle and walled settlement near the strategically important town of Llanfaes on Anglesey – the future Beaumaris – but were postponed due to {{the costs of the}} other projects.|$|E
5|$|By the 19th century, Leicester Square {{was known}} as an {{entertainment}} venue, with many amusements peculiar to the era, including Wyld's Great Globe, which was built for The Great Exhibition of 1851 and housed a giant scale map of the Earth. <b>The</b> <b>construction</b> <b>of</b> <b>New</b> Coventry Street {{made it easier for}} traffic to access the square, resulting in private residences being replaced by shops, museums and exhibition centres. Savile House at No.5–6, built in 1683 for Thomas Bruce, 2nd Earl of Ailesbury, had become a museum by this time, and was ultimately destroyed by fire in 1865. It was rebuilt as the Empire Theatre.|$|E

5|$|Chicago {{initially}} {{led the way}} in skyscraper design, {{with many}} constructed {{in the center of the}} financial district during the late 1880s and early 1890s. Sometimes termed the products of the Chicago school of architecture, these skyscrapers attempted to balance aesthetic concerns with practical commercial design, producing large, square palazzo-styled buildings hosting shops and restaurants on the ground level and containing rentable offices on the upper floors. In contrast, New York's skyscrapers were frequently narrower towers which, more eclectic in style, were often criticized for their lack of elegance. In 1892, Chicago banned <b>the</b> <b>construction</b> <b>of</b> <b>new</b> skyscrapers taller than , leaving the development of taller buildings to New York.|$|E
5|$|Flood waters {{from the}} Murchison River {{finally began to}} recede on 17 March; however, it took several weeks for the river to return to its normal level. Although Emma had only minor effects in Carnarvon, the town enacted a A$14million ($10million USD) flood {{protection}} plan {{in the wake of}} the storm. The plan would lead to <b>the</b> <b>construction</b> <b>of</b> <b>new</b> levees in areas surrounding the town and keep flood waters within Nicol Bay Flats. Additionally, four sections of the North West Coastal Highway were set to be upgraded for similar reasons. Due to the combined effects of Cyclones Clare, Darryl, Jim, Emma, Kate and Glenda, gold production in Australia fell by 8 percent, resulting in earnings losses of A$130million.|$|E
5|$|From {{the start}} of the 18th century onwards, the garden went through major changes as it fell into neglect. It was painted in 1747 by Canaletto during a period of transition, as Westminster was being {{transformed}} by <b>the</b> <b>construction</b> <b>of</b> <b>new</b> buildings and roads. By {{the start of}} the 19th century it had been redeveloped as the site for a row of townhouses, some of which were occupied by prime ministers seeking homes near the government buildings nearby. The last remnants of the Privy Garden were destroyed in 1938 during the construction of government offices which now house the Ministry of Defence's headquarters building.|$|E
