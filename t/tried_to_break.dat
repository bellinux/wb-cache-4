5|$|A {{little before}} 16:00, Ney noted an {{apparent}} exodus from Wellington's centre. He mistook {{the movement of}} casualties to the rear for {{the beginnings of a}} retreat, and sought to exploit it. Following the defeat of d'Erlon's Corps, Ney had few infantry reserves left, as most of the infantry had been committed either to the futile Hougoumont attack or to the defence of the French right. Ney therefore <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>break</b> Wellington's centre with cavalry alone.|$|E
5|$|Turner met Johnny Stompanato {{during the}} spring of 1957, shortly after ending her {{marriage}} to Barker. After she discovered his ties to the Los Angeles underworld (in particular, his association with gangster Mickey Cohen), she <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>break</b> off the affair out of fear of bad publicity. Stompanato was not easily deterred, however, and {{over the course of the}} following year, they carried on a relationship filled with violent arguments, physical abuse, and repeated reconciliations.|$|E
5|$|At {{the same}} time, 1st Battalion, 7th Marines (1/7) also <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>break</b> the Chinese {{blockade}} at Hill 1419 on 1 December. Despite being badly reduced by combat, hunger and frostbite, the PVA 59th Division sent {{in its last}} five platoons and refused to yield. As night approached, 1/7 finally captured the peak and started to march through the hills {{on the east side}} of the road. Relying on the element of surprise, they managed to destroy several Chinese positions along the road. On the morning of 2 December, a joint attack by Fox Company and 1/7 secured the Toktong Pass, thus opening the road between Yudam-ni and Hagaru-ri.|$|E

5|$|However, it {{has often}} been the case that league players have joined Andover after {{retiring}} from professional football. One of the most notable of these in modern times is Matt Crossley, who ended his career with the Lions after playing more than 100 matches for Wycombe Wanderers. After leaving Andover in 2001, Crossley later became assistant manager at Woking where he gained notoriety in December 2006 after he headbutted an opposing player who had <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>break</b> up a fight. Maurice Evans is another former professional who, after briefly taking over as Andover's player-manager in 1967, went on to lead Reading to the Fourth Division championship, and Oxford United to Milk Cup victory.|$|E
5|$|In 1962 he {{investigated}} the mysterious death of Enrico Mattei, the powerful president of Italy's state-owned {{oil and gas}} conglomerate ENI who died in suspicious circumstances {{in a plane crash}} on October 27, 1962. During his controversial tenure of ENI, Mattei had made many enemies. He <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>break</b> the oligopoly of the 'Seven Sisters' (a term Mattei coined to refer to the dominant oil companies of the mid-20th century), and brokered an oil import deal with the Soviet Union {{in the middle of the}} Cold War over intense protests from NATO and the U.S. in 1959, while supporting independence movements against colonial powers such as Algeria.|$|E
5|$|Per {{traditional}} accounts, some Brahmins of Varanasi {{were still}} not satisfied, and sent two thieves {{to steal the}} manuscript. The thieves <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>break</b> into the Ashram of Tulsidas, but were confronted by two guards with bows and arrows, of dark and fair complexion. The thieves {{had a change of}} heart and came to Tulsidas in the morning to ask who the two guards were. Believing that the two guards could be none other than Rama and Lakshmana, Tulsidas was aggrieved to know that they were guarding his home at night. He sent the manuscript of Ramcahritmanas to his friend Rai Todar Mal, the finance minister of Akbar, and donated all his money. The thieves were reformed and became devotees of Rama.|$|E

5|$|The 1947 {{season was}} another strong one for Speedie. In {{a game against}} the Buffalo Bills, he tied a {{professional}} football record by catching a throw from Graham and running 99 yards for a touchdown. He finished the season as the league leader in receptions and receiving yards as the Browns won another championship. His 67 catches and 1,146 receiving yards, in fact, were the second-best in pro football history after Don Hutson of the Green Bay Packers, who caught for 1,211 yards in 1940. Speedie was named by news outlets as a first-team All-Pro. Speedie's success in 1947 came as he, Graham and Lavelli gelled as a passing and receiving unit, having studied hours of tape and worked on their technique and coordination. Speedie studied how defensive backs moved their feet and <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>break</b> into the open by exploiting mis-steps. They experimented with screen passes and made modifications to common receiving routes to exploit the weaknesses of defenses.|$|E
5|$|The Egyptians {{proceeded}} {{to clear the}} bunkers. They utilized flamethrower teams, which had a visible psychological impact on the fort's garrison. At one point, the Egyptians, {{with the help of}} a wounded Israeli prisoner, managed to secure a bunker by convincing the panicked Israelis inside to come out and surrender. Soon after losing contact with the fort, the Israelis attempted to reach it once more. By this time, Malhov was dead. A group of tanks from Baluza advanced to Lahtzanit, but the Sa'iqa company occupying the firing ramp managed to destroy two tanks, forcing the remainder to retreat. Another group of tanks and half-tracks <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>break</b> through the southern isolation force, but were ambushed and withdrew after losing a tank.|$|E
5|$|In 1960, Kinne was {{associated}} with two mysterious deaths. On March 19 of that year, her husband, James Kinne, was found {{shot in the head}} with the couple's two-year-old daughter playing nearby. Sharon Kinne claimed that the little girl, who had often been allowed to play with her father's guns, had accidentally shot him, and police were initially unable to disprove this theory. The case was closed as an accidental death and remained that way until the evening of May 27, when the body of twenty-three-year-old Patricia Jones, a local file clerk, was found by Kinne and a boyfriend in a secluded area. Investigation showed that Jones had been the wife of another of Kinne's boyfriends, and that Jones's husband had <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>break</b> off his affair with Kinne shortly before Patricia Jones went missing. When Kinne admitted to having been the last person to speak to Patricia Jones, she was charged with Jones's death and, upon further investigation of his death, with the murder of James Kinne.|$|E

5|$|In spring 829, Michael II sent a new fleet to Sicily under Theodotus, who {{was well}} acquainted with the island, having already served as its strategos in the past. After landing, Theodotus marched his army to Enna, where the Arabs were {{continuing}} the siege. He was defeated in the subsequent battle, but {{was able to find}} refuge in the fortress with most of his men. The Muslims now became so confident of victory that they struck their first coins on the island, in the name of Ziyadat Allah and Muhammad ibn Abu'l-Jawari, who however died a short while after and was replaced by Zubayr ibn Gawth. Shortly after that, Theodotus managed to reverse the situation: he led a sally that routed a Muslim raiding party and then defeated the main Muslim army on the next day, killing 1,000 men and pursuing the rest up to the Muslims' fortified encampment, which he placed under siege. The Muslims <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>break</b> out in a night sortie, but Theodotus was expecting such a move and routed them in an ambush.|$|E
5|$|The N.W.O.B.H.M. Encyclopedia by Malc Macmillan lists {{more than}} 500 {{recording}} bands {{established in the}} decade between 1975 and 1985 and related to the movement. Probably as many bands launched in the same period, but never emerged from their local club scene, or recorded nothing more than demo tapes or limited pressings of self-produced singles. The disinterest of record labels, poor management of bands, internal struggles and musical choices that turned off much of their original fan base, resulted in most groups disbanding and disappearing {{by the end of}} the decade. A few of the best known groups, such as Praying Mantis in Japan and Saxon, Demon and Tokyo Blade in mainland Europe, survived in foreign markets. Some others, namely Raven, Girlschool and Grim Reaper, <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>break</b> through in the US market signing with American labels, but their attempts were unsuccessful. Two of the more popular bands of the movement, however, went on to considerable, lasting success. Iron Maiden has since become one of the most commercially successful and influential heavy metal bands of all time, even after adopting a more progressive style. Def Leppard became even more successful, targeting the American mainstream rock market with their more refined hard rock sound.|$|E
5|$|When {{the second}} assault began, the Turks <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>break</b> {{through the gate}} with their lances. After heavy casualties, the attackers retreated and Murad held {{for the next two}} days a council of all his generals. An {{immediate}} precaution was to guard the camp against another surprise attack, which was responded to by placing a force of men, under the command of Prince Mehmed, where the first attack had taken place. Moisi Arianit Golemi feigned an attack with about 500 horsemen: the alarm was given and the Turks prepared for his attack. Meanwhile, Skanderbeg and his forces moved around the camp and broke in where least expected. Before an organized counterattack could be made, Skanderbeg retreated from the camp. The attacks made by Skanderbeg caused the Turks to aim some of their cannons towards the expected guerrilla forces, instead of the fortress. A large force of Turkish cavalry was sent out, which Skanderbeg followed up to the mouth of the Ishëm River, until they turned back to Krujë.|$|E

5|$|On {{the same}} day, the 12th Tank Corps and 264th Rifle Division came under heavy {{pressure}} from German tank counterattacks, and on 27 August army commander Prokofy Romanenko, fearing a breakthrough from the south, ordered the 15th Corps to concentrate {{in the forests}} north of Novogryn, in readiness to counterattack if a German breakthrough was made. However, {{by the end of}} the day, the Soviet lines had held and the 15th was not needed in that sector. That night, it was relocated from the Myzin area to the Pakom area, where, together with the 61st Army's 12th Guards Rifle Division, it was to break German resistance near Leonovo, then develop the breakthrough towards Ukolitsa into the rear of the German troops defending against the 154th and 264th Rifle Divisions and the 12th Corps at Bogdanovsky and Goskovo. On the afternoon of 28 August, the corps attacked after a 30-minute artillery bombardment and airstrikes, but was immediately stalled by an anti-tank ditch protected by minefields and artillery. During the night, sappers and motorized infantry managed to create passages through the ditch, but when the offensive was resumed the next morning, the 15th had advanced only 200 to 300 meters before it was stopped by a second anti-tank ditch. During the day it <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>break</b> through, but could not cross the ditch.|$|E
