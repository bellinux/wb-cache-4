5|$|The one {{exception}} to the compactness of <b>the</b> <b>quartet</b> comes in the minuet. The minuet's first half is a standard 12 measures, but the second half is an unusually long 44 measures and involves harmonic excursions deep into the flat-side keys. The trio echoes the first and fourth movements by commencing with a B upbeat leading to an E.|$|E

50|$|The Blackwood Brothers {{formed a}} {{partnership}} with <b>the</b> Statesmen <b>Quartet</b> to tour as a team in the 1950s, {{and they were the}} dominant act on the white gospel circuit during this time. This dominance lasted for about a decade until the rise of gospel television shows in the late 1960s began to give competing groups wider exposure. The Stateswood team also started independent record label Skylite Records. At one time, the Skyline roster included The Blackwood Brothers, J.D.

5|$|Misterioso was {{released}} in 1958 by Riverside Records to a mixed critical reaction; reviewers complimented Monk's performance but were critical of Griffin, whose playing they felt was out of place with <b>the</b> <b>quartet.</b> The album was remastered and reissued in 1989 and 2012 by Original Jazz Classics, and has since received retrospective acclaim from critics, some of whom viewed Griffin's playing as the record's highlight.|$|E

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>quartet</b> did {{not compete}} {{again as a}} unit {{following}} the Moscow Olympics, as Tonelli retired from swimming immediately after the Games. Australia came third in the 1984 Olympics in the medley relay as the Americans returned to the Olympic fold, with only Evans and Kerry of the original four swimming in the final, while Brooks swam in the heats. Evans and Kerry both retired after the 1984 Olympics, and after Brooks retired in 1986, {{the last of the}} Quietly Confident Quartet had departed the Australian swimming scene.|$|E
5|$|Although the prequel/sequel to Superstar Saga, the game's plot is {{completely}} unrelated {{to that of}} its predecessor with more emphasis on the time-traveling theme, which involves the protagonists traveling in between {{the past and present}} of the Mushroom Kingdom. The adventure follows Mario, Baby Mario, Luigi, and Baby Luigi while they search for Princess Peach, who has been abducted by an alien species only known as the Shroobs. The gameplay centers on the co-operation between <b>the</b> <b>quartet,</b> who must use their specific qualities and skills to solve puzzles to progress through and features multiple role-playing game elements, but with a turn-based battle system focused on timing accuracy. The game is considerably darker in tone than its predecessor, especially in its plot and themes.|$|E
5|$|Australia's {{prospects}} improved after Sweden was disqualified in {{the morning}} heats. Tonelli, the eldest swimmer in <b>the</b> <b>quartet</b> {{at the age of}} 23, convened the team as its de facto leader. He asked his teammates to commit to swimming their legs in a certain time; Kerry vowed to complete the backstroke in 57s, Evans the breaststroke in 63s flat, Tonelli the butterfly in 54s and Brooks promised to anchor the team in 49.8s, even though he had never gone faster than 51s. Tonelli named the foursome the Quietly Confident Quartet, and they exhibited a calm self-belief as they lined up for the race.|$|E

5|$|Barely Real is the 1992 {{extended}} play (EP) by the American indie {{rock band}} Codeine. After releasing their previous album Frigid Stars LP in 1990, the group accepted {{an invitation from}} <b>the</b> <b>quartet</b> Bastro to tour in Europe in 1991. Following the tour the group was invited to record a single for Sub Pop Singles Club and attempted to record their follow-up album The White Birch in 1992. The recording sessions proved to be disastrous for the group since it found themselves often with unusable tracks over several different studios. As Codeine could not record enough material for a full-length album, they decided to release what tracks they had as an EP.|$|E
5|$|Federer was {{the first}} to come to {{prominence}} after winning Wimbledon in 2003 and established himself as the world No. 1 by the beginning of 2004. Nadal followed in 2005 after a French Open triumph including a win over Federer, and they occupied the top two places in the ATP rankings for 211 consecutive weeks from July 2005 to August 2009. Djokovic, from 2007, and later Murray, from 2008, increasingly challenged Federer and Nadal's dominance with seasonal consistency. Djokovic captured three of the four major tournaments in 2011, and in 2012 <b>the</b> <b>quartet</b> won one Major tournament apiece. In 2011, Nadal declared that his and Federer's period of joint dominance had ended, owing to the ascent of other players, notably Djokovic and later Murray.|$|E
5|$|Following the lyrics, {{the second}} video starts with <b>the</b> <b>quartet</b> {{in the front}} of the aeroplane, with Spencer as the captain. The video {{continues}} with all of the members as stewards walking up and down the plane, with a cameo appearance from Sister Mary McArthur, who was invited to take part after the band saw her lip sync video. Later in the video each member of the band is seen dancing in front of the flags of selected countries that are all participating in the Eurovision Song Contest 2007, in addition to the flag of the European Union.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>quartet's</b> {{repertoire}} {{was based}} around {{the works of}} Haydn, Mozart and Beethoven, but many contemporary composers also benefited from <b>the</b> <b>quartet's</b> support, including Arnold Schoenberg.|$|R
50|$|Maguire became {{leader of}} <b>the</b> Allegri <b>Quartet</b> in <b>the</b> 1970s, with David Roth, Patrick Ireland and Bruno Schrecker. <b>The</b> <b>quartet's</b> {{recordings}} included <b>the</b> String <b>Quartet</b> No. 2 of Alexander Goehr and <b>the</b> <b>Quartets</b> Nos 3 & 4 of Frank Bridge.

5|$|Further medal {{success was}} {{anticipated}} at the 1998 Olympics in Nagano, which were attended by 24 Australian athletes. Zali Steggall, who months earlier {{had become the}} first Australian woman to win a World Cup event and was ranked sixth in the world, won the country's first individual medal with a bronze in slalom skiing. Her time of 1m 32.67s was only 0.27s behind the gold medallist. Marshall, the world champion in 1997 and 1999, and Jacqui Cooper—ranked second in the world—were expected {{to do well in}} the aerials, but both crashed and failed to make the final. Bradbury, Nizielski and Kieran Hansen, three of <b>the</b> <b>quartet</b> that won Australia's maiden medal in 1994, returned but finished last, in eighth place.|$|E
5|$|In 1964 {{the pianist}} {{reformed}} his quintet with Konitz and Marsh for a two-month engagement at the Half Note and more performances in Canada. <b>The</b> <b>quartet,</b> missing Konitz, played in Toronto {{again in the}} following year. Tristano played on occasion at the Half Note Club until the mid-1960s, and toured Europe in 1965. His European tour was mainly as a solo pianist, and the playing was {{in the style of}} his The New Tristano recordings. He performed with Ind and others in concerts in the UK in 1968; they were well received, and Tristano returned the following year. His last public performance in the US was in 1968.|$|E
5|$|In 1990, Corr and her {{siblings}} formed a quartet called The Corrs.

John Hughes noticed <b>the</b> <b>quartet</b> when they auditioned for the movie, and agreed to become their manager. The Corrs signed with Atlantic Records in 1995 and travelled to North America to record their debut album Forgiven, Not Forgotten. The album featured six instrumental selections among its Celtic-influenced tracks. When released, it was successful in Ireland, Australia, Japan, and Spain. The album reached platinum status in the United Kingdom and Australia, and quadruple platinum in Ireland, which made {{it one of the}} most popular debuts by an Irish group.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>quartet's</b> mentors have {{included}} Walter Levin, <b>the</b> Alban Berg <b>Quartet,</b> <b>the</b> Juilliard String <b>Quartet</b> and <b>the</b> Emerson String <b>Quartet.</b> <b>The</b> prize of the German Music Competition (1995) and first prize at the ARD Music Competition (1996) and the Premio Paolo Borciani (1997) {{paved the way}} to an international career.|$|R
