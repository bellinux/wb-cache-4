In the proposed modelling methods, the wind speed has two components: a long and medium term-component, described by an available spectral characteristic in the low frequency range, and a non-stationary <b>turbulence</b> <b>component,</b> which is “attached” to the medium and long-term component. Two procedures for <b>turbulence</b> <b>component</b> generation, using some shaping filters, are proposed.

40|$|A flight {{assessment}} {{has been}} made of a system for measuring the three components of atmospheric turbulence in the frequency range associated with airplane motions (0 to approximately 0. 5 Hz). Results of the assessment indicate acceptable accuracy of the resulting time histories and power spectra. Small residual errors at the airplane short period and Dutch roll frequencies (0. 5 and 0. 25 Hz, respectively), as determined from in-flight maneuvers in smooth air, would not be detectable on the power spectra. However, errors at approximately 0. 25 Hz can be present in the time history of the lateral <b>turbulence</b> <b>component,</b> particularly at the higher altitudes where airplane yawing motions are large. An assessment of the quantities comprising the vertical <b>turbulence</b> <b>component</b> leads {{to the conclusion that the}} vertical component is essentially accurate to zero frequency...|$|E

40|$|Recent {{analysis}} of the magnetic correlation function of solar wind fluctuations at 1 AU suggests the existence of two-component structure near the proton-cyclotron scale. Here we use two-and-one-half dimensional and three-dimensional compressible MHD models to look for two-component structure adjacent the proton-cyclotron scale. Our MHD system incorporates both Hall and Finite Larmor Radius (FLR) terms. We find that strong spectral anisotropies appear adjacent the proton-cyclotron scales depending on selections of initial condition and plasma beta. These anisotropies are enhancements on top of related anisotropies that appear in standard MHD turbulence {{in the presence of}} a mean magnetic field and are suggestive of one <b>turbulence</b> <b>component</b> along the inertial scales and another component adjacent the dissipative scales. We compute the relative strengths of linear and nonlinear accelerations on the velocity and magnetic fields to gauge the relative influence of terms that drive the system with wave-like (linear) versus turbulent (nonlinear) dynamics...|$|E
40|$|This {{paper is}} {{concerned}} with the generic form of space–time correlations of instantaneous velocity fluctuations in turbulent shear flows. The study has as its basis the Kovasznay–Corrsin conjecture modified to account for inhomogeneities. Details of the modifications were dictated by comparison with direct numerical simulations of turbulent channel flow. For example, analysis of the simulations shows that the space–time correlations at optimal delay depict, when appropriately normalized, a form independent of <b>turbulence</b> <b>component.</b> It is also evident that the half width of the correlation grows, in the outer region of the layer, like Vn 11, while the Lagrangian time scale grows like Vn, where 2,n, 3 and V is the mean convection velocity. The resulting generic form for the space–time correlation captures these effects well and brings to light a Reynolds number effect that is most evident in the tail of the correlations at nonoptimal delay...|$|E
40|$|Literature on {{turbulence}} is very wide, providing several {{models for}} the power spectral density function of the single-point turbulence components, for the two-point coherence function of the same <b>turbulence</b> <b>component</b> and for the single-point coherence function of different turbulence components. On the other hand, no suitable and simple model seems to be available for representing the two-point coherence function of different turbulence components, in particular of the longitudinal and vertical turbulence components, which would be useful for modelling buffeting actions on bridges. The Proper Orthogonal Decomposition provides efficient tools to formulate {{a new model of}} the turbulence field based on principal components. Furthermore, it suggests physical principles and defines mathematical rules to establish an appropriate model of the two-point coherence function of the longitudinal and vertical components, completing the statistical model of turbulence.

This evaluation is needed to obtain estimates of wind turbine performance and to identify hazards to the machine from the <b>turbulence</b> <b>component</b> of the atmosphere. These estimates allow for more detailed project planning and for preliminary financing arrangements to be secured. The site evaluation process can occur in two stages: (1) utilizing existing nearby data, and (2) establishing and monitoring an onsite measurement program. Since step (2) requires a period of at least 1 yr or more from the time a potential site has been identified, step (1) is often an essential stage in the preliminary evaluation process.

Differences in the functional forms of response exceedance curves and probability densities also were shown to depend primarily on this same coefficient of variation. Criteria were established for the validity of the local stationary assumption that is required in the derivations of the exceedance curves and probability density functions. These criteria are shown to depend on the relative time scale of the fluctuations in the variance, the fluctuations in the turbulence itself, and on the nominal duration of the relevant aircraft impulse response function. Metrics that can be generated from turbulence recordings for testing the validity of the local stationary assumption were developed...|$|E

30|$|Extracting {{maximum power}} at below rated wind speed is an {{important}} component of efficiently harnessing wind power. Selection of the right control strategy is therefore important to ensure that the system performs optimally. The objective is to design robust controllers that maximize the energy extracted from the wind while reducing transient loads on the drive train. To achieve the above objective, nonlinear controllers such as SMC and ISMC are adapted initially to control a single mass model of the WT of 600  kW machine. Those controllers are found to give weak performance particularly in the presence of input torque disturbance of more than 3  kNm. In this work, a nonlinear AFISMC with MNR wind speed estimator has been developed. The proposed controller is a combination of fuzzy technique, and the ISMC where the discontinuity in ISMC is smoothed by using hyperbolic tangent function, and the sliding gain is adapted using a fuzzy technique which makes the controller more robust. Compared to SMC and ISMC, the proposed AFISMC is found to be more robust in achieving the above objectives in the presence of input torque disturbance varying from 2 to 10  kNm. To prove the efficiency of the proposed AFISMC control, the simulation has been conducted for different wind speed profiles with different <b>turbulence</b> <b>component.</b>|$|E
40|$|Purpose - Turbulent {{mixing of}} two co-axial jets having a low annular to core area ratio is {{enhanced}} by employing a chute mixer directing part of the annular stream at 10 degrees towards the core region. Aims to present results from measurements of time-averaged and fluctuating components of velocity under cold flow conditions, Design/methodology/approach - Experiments were conducted at a bypass ratio of 0. 47 which is a typical value for low bypass turbofan engines. Contours of time-averaged velocity and streamwise and transverse turbulence intensities were obtained by making detailed measurements close to the chutes. Distributions of time-averaged velocity and turbulence intensity were obtained at different axial locations downstream of the chute mixer. Total and static pressure measurements were also performed. Findings - The high velocity annular stream was found to quickly diffuse after entering through the chutes and mix with the core stream due to high turbulence generation. A strong transverse <b>turbulence</b> <b>component</b> enhanced the mixing of the streams. With {{the aid of the}} chute mixer, nearly complete mixing is achieved over a length of 5 duct radii.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} an optimal control structure for variable speed, fixed pitch wind turbine. The control objective {{results from the}} optimization criterion that includes two contradictory demands: maximization of the energy captured from the wind and minimization of {{the damage caused by}} mechanical fatigue. We admit, as a modeling assumption, that wind speed has two components: a slowly varying component, named seasonal and a rapidly varying component, named turbulence. Hence, two control structures, which should function simultaneously, are identified in the optimal control problem. The first optimization structure aims to maximize the wind turbine energetic efficiency by maintaining operational point on optimal regime characteristics (ORC). According to the slowly varying seasonal component of wind speed, a control loop adjusts system operating point in order to maintain it on ORC. In the second optimization structure, the system is considered to be operating on “static” optimal point assured by the above mentioned control loop, with the <b>turbulence</b> <b>component</b> being the input variable. The second control loop aims dynamic optimization that implies the minimization of the tip speed ratio variations around its optimal value, while minimizing the torque variations, thus the mechanical stress. Mathematically, this objective is defined as an integral criterion, belonging to linear quadratic optimization...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—Turbulence of the {{incoming}} wind field {{is of paramount importance}} to the dynamic response of civil engineering structures. Hence reliable stochastic models of the turbulence should be available from which time series can be generated for dynamic response and structural safety analysis. In the paper an empirical cross spectral density function for the along-wind <b>turbulence</b> <b>component</b> over the wind field area is taken as the starting point. The spectrum is spatially discretized in terms of a Hermitian cross-spectral density matrix for the turbulence state vector which turns out not to be positive definite. Since the succeeding state space and ARMA modelling of the turbulence rely on the positive definiteness of the cross-spectral density matrix, the problem with the non-positive definiteness of such matrices is at first addressed and suitable treatments regarding it are proposed. From the adjusted positive definite cross-spectral density matrix a frequency response matrix is constructed which determines the turbulence vector as a linear filtration of Gaussian white noise. Finally, an accurate state space modelling method is proposed which allows selection of an appropriate model order, and estimation of a state space model for the vector turbulence process incorporating its phase spectrum in one stage, and its results are compared with a conventional ARMA modelling method.

The streamwise <b>turbulence</b> <b>component</b> was measured over a Reynolds number range from 7. 6 × 104 to 8. 3 × 106, covering the smooth to fully rough regimes. The experiments were conducted in the Princeton/ONR Superpipe facility that uses compressed air at pressures up to 200 atm as the working fluid. For Reynolds numbers less than about 8 × 105 the surface was hydraulically-smooth, and the results agreed closely with the smooth-wall turbulence intensity and spectral data obtained by Morrison et al. [10] and Zhao & Smits [14]. An assessment was performed of probe resolution and {{results indicate that the}} turbulence statistics of the large-scale motions were unaffected by the sensing wire length even at high Reynolds numbers. Transitionally-rough and fully-rough data showed deviation from the smooth-wall data as roughness effects became more prominent. In particular, the outer peak in the turbulence intensity observed at high Reynolds numbers in smooth pipe flow decreased in magnitude or stayed constant for transitionally rough and fully rough flow. The two-point azimuthal correlations were found to be consistent with the presence of very large scale coherent regions of low-wavenumber, low-momentum fluid observed in previous studies of wall-bounded flows.
