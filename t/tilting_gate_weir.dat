40|$|Downstream fish passage {{facilities}} at the Holyoke Project were modified {{to enhance the}} passage of Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) smolts. A pier extension was installed adjacent to the Holyoke Dam bascule gate, the opening of an experimental weir inserted in the bascule gate was {{moved closer to the}} Hadley Falls Station intakes, and above-water lighting was added. An intake rack overlay was in place at both Hadley Falls Station units {{during the first half of}} this evaluation; the Unit 2 overlay was removed during the second half. Radiotagged, hatchery-reared Atlantic salmon smolts were released upstream of the Project and downstream passage routes were monitored. All releases were conducted after flashboards had been installed on the crest of the dam, closing that passage route. Overall, 63 % of the radiotagged smolts that approached Hadley Falls Station passed over the bascule <b>gate</b> <b>weir</b> and 37 % passed through the turbines. These results were comparable to results obtained in a 1992 evaluation, when a floating guide wall was present upstream of the intakes. Two-thirds of the radiotagged smolts that passed through the turbines at Hadley Falls Station did so through Unit 1. Removal of the Unit 2 intake rack overlay did not affect the proportion of radiotagged smolts passing through the turbines. Combining data from 1992 and 1995, a statistically significant but weak negative relationship between flow through the station and the proportion of radiotagged smolts passing over the bascule gate/weir was found. The louver/bypass system in the Holyoky Canal passed 91 % of the radiotagged smolts entering the canal back to the Hadley Falls Station tailrace. Above-water lighting installed upstream of the canal gatehouse appeared to have raised the proportion of radiotagged smolts entering the canal. When the results of passage through the bascule <b>gate</b> <b>weir</b> and the louver/bypass system were combined, 74 % of the radiotagged smolts passed through downstream passage facilities.

40|$|Today, {{retention}} reservoirs {{along the}} Demer River in Belgium {{are controlled by}} means of adjustable <b>gated</b> <b>weirs</b> based on fixed rules. To improve the regulation of these weirs, this paper investigates a method for real-time flood control. Because of the excessive calculation time of detailed hydrodynamic models, a conceptual model was used. This model combines the Model Predictive Control (MPC) technique with a Genetic Algorithm (GA). For several scenarios, MPC controls the future state of the river network by changing {{the positions of the}} adjustable weirs. The GA generates these positions. Damage functions depending on water levels, were introduced to evaluate the efficiency of each scenario, based on flood damage minimization. The influence of the most important parameters of the MPC-GA-algorithm is investigated by means of a sensitivity analysis.

40|$|Determining factors {{responsible}} for {{increases in the}} mortality of freshwater fish larvae are important {{for the conservation of}} recruitment processes and for the long-term sustainability of freshwater fish populations. To assess the impact of one such process, Murray cod (Maccullochella peelii peelii Mitchell) and golden perch (Macquaria ambigua Richardson) larvae were arranged into treatment and control groups and passed through different configurations (overshot and undershot) of a low-level weir. Passage through an undershot weir resulted in the death of 95 +/- 1 % golden perch and 52 +/- 13 % Murray cod. By comparison, mortality was significantly lower in the overshot treatment and both controls. The relatively large number of undershot weirs within the known distribution of these species could impact upon recruitment over a large scale. It is therefore recommended that water management authorities consider the potential threats of operating undershot <b>gated</b> <b>weirs</b> on the survival of larval fish until further research determines appropriate mitigatory measures for these and other species...|$|R

5000|$|Under {{steady state}} flow {{conditions}} (e.g. no flood wave), {{open channel flow}} can be subdivided into three types of flow: uniform flow, gradually varying flow, and rapidly varying flow. Uniform flow describes a situation where flow depth does not change with distance along the channel. This can only occur in a smooth channel that does not experience any changes in flow, channel geometry, roughness or channel slope. During uniform flow, the flow depth is known as normal depth (yn). This depth {{is analogous to the}} terminal velocity of an object in free fall, where gravity and frictional forces are in balance (Moglen, 2013).

Examples of this include the backwater behind an in-stream structure (e.g. dam, sluice <b>gate,</b> <b>weir,</b> etc.), when there is a constriction in the channel, and when there is a minor change in channel slope. Rapidly varied flow occurs when the change in flow depth per change in flow distance is significant.
