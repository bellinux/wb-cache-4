500|$|Despite {{receiving}} generally favorable {{reviews from}} the critics, the country-rock style of Sweetheart of the Rodeo {{was such a}} radical departure from the band's previous sound that large sections of the group's counterculture following were alienated by its contents, resulting in the lowest sales of any Byrds album up to that point. Barry Gifford, in the August 1968 edition of Rolling Stone magazine, said of the album: [...] "The new Byrds do not sound like Buck Owens & his Buckaroos. They aren't that good. The material they've chosen to record, or rather, the way they perform the material, is simple, relaxed and folky. It's not pretentious, it's pretty. The musician-ship is excellent." [...] Gifford added that [...] "The Byrds have made an interesting album. It's really very uninvolved and not a difficult record to listen to. It ought to make the 'Easy-Listening' charts. 'Bringing it all back home' has never been an easy thing to do." [...] Rolling Stone praised the album in its September 1968 issue, with Jon Landau writing: [...] "The Byrds, in doing country as country, show just how powerful and relevant unadorned country music is to the music of today." [...] Landau added that [...] "they leave just enough rock in the drums <b>to</b> <b>let</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> that they can still play rock & roll." [...] In a 1969 article for The New York Times, Robert Christgau described Sweetheart of the Rodeo as [...] "a bittersweet tribute to country music".|$|E
500|$|McCormack {{received}} his breakthrough role in 1998 {{when he was}} cast as gay lawyer Will Truman on the NBC sitcom Will & Grace. McCormack said that when the part came along, he was convinced he was right for the role. [...] "At {{the end of the}} audition, Max Mutchnick, co-creator and executive producer of the show said 'That was perfect. Just <b>to</b> <b>let</b> <b>you</b> <b>know,</b> you never have to be more gay than that.'" [...] He explained that when he first read the script, [...] "what hit me immediately was that this was me. I mean, sexual orientation aside, Will was so much like me. He's a great host, he's relatively funny and he has great friends and he's a good friend to them... the gay issue just wasn't really a big thing." [...] The show debuted on September 21, 1998, and was watched by almost 8.6million American viewers. Will & Grace quickly developed a loyal audience, with the show and McCormack receiving strong reviews. John Carman of the San Francisco Chronicle commented that McCormack and costar Debra Messing (who played Will's best friend Grace Adler) worked [...] "nicely" [...] together. Kay McFadden of The Seattle Times also praised McCormack, Messing, and the supporting cast as [...] "very funny". For this performance, he earned four Emmy Award nominations (2000, 2001, 2003, 2005), one of which resulted in a win (2001), for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Comedy Series. In addition, he received five Golden Globe Award nominations.|$|E

500|$|Two main {{charges were}} brought to the House of Commons against Marlborough: first, an {{assertion}} that over nine years he had illegally received more than £63,000 from the bread and transport contractors in the Netherlands; second, that he had taken 2.5% from the pay of the foreign troops in English pay, amounting to £280,000. Despite Marlborough's refutations (claiming ancient precedent for the first allegation, and, for the second, producing a warrant signed by the Queen in 1702 authorising him to make the deductions in lieu of secret-service money for the war), the findings were enough for Harley to persuade the Queen to release her Captain-General. On 29 December 1711 (O.S.), before the charges had been examined, Anne, who owed to him the success and glory of her reign, sent her letter of dismissal: [...] "I am sorry for your own sake the reasons are become so public which makes it necessary for me <b>to</b> <b>let</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> you have render'd it impracticable for you to continue yet longer in my service". The Tory dominated Parliament concluded by a substantial majority that, [...] "the taking of several sums of money annually by the Duke of Marlborough from the contractor for foraging the bread and wagons... was unwarrantable and illegal", and that the 2.5% deducted from the pay of foreign troops [...] "is public money and ought to be accounted for". When his successor, the Duke of Ormonde, left London for The Hague to take command of British forces he went, noted Bishop Burnet, with [...] "the same allowances that had been lately voted criminal in the Duke of Marlborough".|$|E
500|$|The band's overall {{low profile}} in 2008 was {{initially}} {{thought to be}} due to them spending time working on their second album. However, in December 2008, Delorentos explained in their MySpace blog that a potential record deal had fallen through due to the prospective label encountering financial problems. Added to this, the collapse of Pinnacle, their distribution company, denied the band a chance to release their album in the United Kingdom. Their blog entry stated that [...] "these are strange times for everyone, and for us in the music industry {{there has been a lot}} of uncertainty. It just happened that our opportunity coincided with this extraordinary time." [...] After performing a number of shows with fellow Dubliners Director, Delorentos announced their break-up on 17 February 2009. The split came about after Yourell decided to leave the band due to his desire to [...] "do other things". A MySpace entry stated: [...] "It's with a very heavy heart that we have <b>to</b> <b>let</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> that Ronan has decided to leave the band. He feels its best for him to move on and do other things. The three of us will still be making music and will let you know about what happens next". However, they still planned to record their second album, believed to be titled You Can Make Sound, in March 2009 – it would contain all the songs they had written in the previous year – and play [...] "a gig or two" [...] as part of a farewell tour. The band's farewell tour includes shows in Whelan's in Dublin and Cyprus Avenue in Cork. Reaction to the split was generally one of shock – The Kinetiks were amongst the neighbouring bands they had influenced, Jacqui Carroll attributed her discovery of Irish music to an early Delorentos show, whilst blogger UnaRocks, John Walshe of State, Jonnie Craig and others had recently been championing the band's sound. On 22 April 2009, the band announced they would not split after all, citing a newfound excitement for recording as their reason. Yourell later explained that the band signing away their independent stance only to be let down by their record company had [...] "knocked us out of our stride" [...] and had led to him considering his future.|$|E

2500|$|The Battle of France began {{less than}} two months after Reynaud came to office. France was badly mauled by the initial attack in early May 1940, and Paris was threatened. On 15 May, five days after the {{invasion}} began, Reynaud contacted Churchill and famously remarked, [...] "We have been defeated... we are beaten; we have lost the battle....

[...] Indeed, such was the situation regarding equipment and morale that Reynaud received a postcard found on the body of an officer who had committed suicide in Le Mans.

[...] Schoolboy Q further commented on the album as he {{compared}} it to past releases including 2012's Habits & Contradictions and his independent debut, Setbacks. The rapper stated that the major difference between the three projects is that he wasn't forced to compromise on Oxymoron: [...] "It's me. This album is really me. It's my life. Habits & Contradictions and Setbacks was more like—I compromised a little bit also with them projects. 'Hands on the Wheel' was like I really was like 'I'mma go to radio with this'…I made this project the way I wanted it to make. I wanted it to sound [...] So, this album is crazy. It's my best work.

Drop songs every month <b>to</b> <b>let</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> I'm really in the studio perfecting things." [...] In addition to losing the need to compromise, Schoolboy Q hinted Oxymoron may boast a [...] "more comfortable Q." [...] While speaking exclusively with HipHopDX earlier in the year, the rapper shared a few words of advice for his fellow emcees as he touched on his increased comparability with music: [...] "I feel like all rappers, the more comfortable you are, the better your raps are gon' be. When I was in the studios , I wrote the verse, and I wasn't comfortable, but I just did it anyway. The more comfortable you are with your music, the iller you gon' get. You feel confident and comfortable in your voice and find yourself." [...] In September 2013, Schoolboy Q discussed how gang history would be included in his album: [...] "I've never said this in an interview," [...] Schoolboy Q {{said in an interview with}} Life+Times: [...] "This album is about me taking care of my daughter and Crip history from 1969 to present." ...|$|E
2500|$|In November 2013, Schoolboy Q {{expressed}} he {{felt there}} were no more gangsta rappers.

[...] Conscious rappers never like to be called conscious rappers and a lyrical rapper never like to be a party rapper. I'm a gangsta rapper, that's who I am. I happen to make fun records at the same time, that's what I do. I joke, I bag on niggas, my personality is like that, but I am a gangsta rapper and that's what I'm gonna bring to the table." [...] During the interview, Schoolboy Q then added that gangsta rappers are nowhere to be found today: [...] "There's no more gangsta rappers. It's just trap music now. So I wanna get that old feeling back that I do naturally. I'm not necessarily trying to bring gangsta rap back. I'm just trying <b>to</b> <b>let</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> it's still here and I'm a part of it. I feel like I'm the only one out of the coast that's doing this gangsta rap shit the way that it used to be done...how niggas used to put detail in their music, not just going to the club and turning up." [...] Schoolboy Q said {{that he is going to}} bring that style in Oxymoron: [...] "I'm just telling my story and what I grew up around and what I seen and what I did and I wanna put that in the light instead of everybody just smiling. Like Eminem said, 'Whatever happened to wildin' out and being violent? / Whatever happened to catchin a good-ol' fashioned passionate ass-whoopin' and getting your shoes coat and your hat tooken?' [...] "I'm one of them niggas," [...] Schoolboy Q continued. [...] "Whatever happened to that? I don't want niggas to get beat up or no shit like that, but at the end of the day, that is a part of life and I like that type of music. That's what pushed West Coast music to where it was at like when Dre, Snoop and all them...Dogg Pound.
