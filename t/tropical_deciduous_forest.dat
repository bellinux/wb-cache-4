5|$|Geastrum triplex is a {{saprobic}} fungus: it derives {{nutrients from}} decomposing organic matter. The fruit bodies are usually found growing singly or more commonly in groups in hardwood forests where much humus has accumulated; in Mexico, {{they have been}} collected in <b>tropical</b> <b>deciduous</b> <b>forest.</b> Fruit bodies are often found around well-rotted tree stumps; they are initially almost buried in the loose duff, but emerge during maturity as the downward curling of the rays exposes the spore sac. Old fruit bodies are persistent, and may survive the winter to be found the following spring or summer. A Dutch study reported a propensity for G.triplex to grow on soil made calcium-rich from washed-out chalk of crushed shells on bicycling paths. It is described as common in North America and Europe. One author states it is commonly found under beech trees.|$|E

2500|$|Colleen Kelly {{and colleagues}} have used congeneric species pairs to examine storage {{dynamics}} where species similarity {{is a natural}} outcome of relatedness and not dependent on researcher-based estimates. [...] Initial studies were of 12 species of trees coexisting in a <b>tropical</b> <b>deciduous</b> <b>forest</b> at the Chamela Biological Station in Jalisco, Mexico. For each of the 12 species they examined age structure (calculated from size and species-specific growth rate), and found that recruitment of young trees varies from year to year. [...] Grouping the species into 6 congeneric pairs, the locally rarer species of each pair unanimously had a more irregular age distributions than the more common species. This finding strongly suggests that between closely competing tree species, the rarer species experiences stronger recruitment fluctuation than the commoner species. Such difference in recruitment fluctuation, combined with evidence of greater competitive ability in the rarer species of each pair, indicates a difference in covariance between the environment and competition between rare and common species. Since species-specific environmental response and buffered population growth can be naturally assumed, their finding strongly suggests that the storage effect operates in this <b>tropical</b> <b>deciduous</b> <b>forest</b> so as to maintain the coexistence between different tree species. [...] Further work with these species {{has shown that the}} storage dynamic is a pairwise, competitive relationship, between congeneric species pairs, and possibly extending as successively nested pairs within a genus.|$|E

30|$|Productivity {{is higher}} in the Nilgiri landscape, whereas the low {{rainfall}} in the Sathyamangalam landscape {{has resulted in the}} domination of tropical dry thorn forests. The higher fuel loads in the <b>tropical</b> <b>deciduous</b> <b>forests</b> in the Nilgiri landscape could be driving the frequent fires in the Nilgiri landscape, as the mean fire-return interval is seven times more frequent than for the Sathyamangalam landscape.

A few high elevation grassland patches (Sukumar et al. 1995) are also distributed in the Sathyamangalam landscape. The higher dead fuel loads in the tropical dry thorn forests in the Sathyamangalam landscape could be due to the higher biotic pressures in the forests (Reddy et al. 2012).|$|R
