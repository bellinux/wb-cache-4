40|$|Today, many <b>teachware</b> {{management}} and e-learning systems are still {{based on the}} ordinary file-system. This stands in conflict with typical requirements found in <b>teachware</b> applications: multiple views on and adaptivity of the course material, support of reuse, low redundancy. In this paper, we present a fragmentation-based generic approach to the loss-less storage of XML <b>teachware</b> documents which supports the efficient retrieval and reconstruction of <b>teachware</b> modules and {{can be adapted to}} the particularities of the individual application domain. The storage model is based on a general meta-modeling architecture for <b>teachware</b> that addresses the similarities of different domains of application {{while at the same time}} allowing to meet the specific needs of a particular domain. The <b>teachware</b> data model serves as a platform for the specification of fragmentation strategies suitable to the specific application domain and even the individual user profile. ...|$|E

Furthermore, explanations of a teacher during a lecture implicitly form a document that may be useful beyond the boundaries of the lecture. In this paper we describe how documents created during a lecture can be recorded and how these recordings can be made available on a server in the Internet. The presented scheme allows them to be linked to additional multimedia documents, making a Computer Based Training unit. Thus, our scheme enables the efficient use of <b>teachware</b> in synchronous as well as in asynchronous teaching scenarios...|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} we propose a meta-modeling {{approach}} to adaptive knowledge management. It extends previous work by introducing an application-specific layer which allows to specify metamodels for different types of application such as <b>teachware</b> or business information. These models focus on the conceptual content structure of knowledge modules and their modular composition. They facilitate their managing, exchanging and dynamical composition to personalized information spaces. We further introduce the concept of view specifications which allow the adaptation of knowledge modules to the individual user. As an instance of our generic framework we discuss a teachware-specific meta-model and its binding to the XML based Learning Material Markup Language LMML. 1 Introduction Today, business information, <b>teachware</b> or knowledge in general is frequently provided on an intranet or on the internet in a variety of formats that is more or less unstructured and can essentially only be acces [...] ...|$|E

40|$|Various {{forms of}} {{education}} and training, based on the classical Computer Based Training (CBT), have become well established within companies and in higher education.

A relatively recent development which has not yet gained widespread acceptance is the use of the World Wide Web (WWW) as a basis and platform for distributed computer assisted teaching and learning. In addition to the advantages outlined with regard to classical CBT, the WWW offers the two advantages of world wide availablity as well as ease of promptly updating courses, but also adds many possibilities of collaborative learning.

40|$|Abstract — This paper {{describes}} {{the development of}} an intelligent computer-assisted language learning (ICALL: Intelligent Computer Aided Language Learning) system for learning Arabic, especially, the advanced method of feedback and the approach for analysing learner’s answer. The corrective feedback is undoubtedly the attribute generally associated with the ICALL and the interactive language learning environment, it forms the essential component to evaluate the quality of a <b>teachware.</b> As it is the case for other concepts, several traditions converge to lead to the concept of feedback in ICALL: we talk about feedback {{in the area of the}} technology, the area of information and communication and other fields. After a brief presentation of the general denomination of this word, we show what the theories of learning languages say on the feedback and the correction of errors produced by learners. We will study aspects of feedback specific to the field of ICALL by describing our language learning environment called @rabLearn which is based on the use of NLP (Natural Language Processing) tools such as our Morphological analyser [7, 8] and we seek to know in what ways analysis of learner’s answers by the computer improve the quality of the feedback...|$|E

Reflections on the changing pedagogical use of computer algebra systems: assistance for doing or learnin© 2001 Dr. Robyn Una Pierce. At a time of transition, when the increasing availability and affordability of Computer Algebra Systems (CAS) presents mathematics educators with new challenges, this thesis explores two facets of students’ abilities and understanding that impact on the use of CAS in teaching and learning mathematics. In this thesis, these are called ‘Algebraic Insight’ and ‘Effective Use of CAS’. A framework is presented and described for each construct and then the frameworks are explored {{within the context of a}} course in introductory calculus, taught by the researcher to a class of 21 undergraduate tertiary students. Algebraic Insight is the subset of Symbol Sense required when using CAS for the mathematical solution phase of problem solving. The framework breaks Algebraic Insight into two aspects: ability to Link Representations (symbolic, numeric, graphical); and Algebraic Expectation, the cognitive skill required to monitor symbolic work (comparable to arithmetic estimation for monitoring numeric work). The framework of Effective Use of CAS is also divided into two aspects: Technical, using syntax and program features; and Personal, the willingness to use CAS in a judicious manner. Open Acces...|$|E
40|$|For the {{universities}} of the emergent countries, {{and those of}} Cameroon in particular, the fight to reach a durable development requires to know the needed scientific and technical information for their development, {{how to get it}} and to spread it out among partners in the country. Obviously, the complete answer to these preoccupations lies well beyond the framework of this project, but a projection, partial but highly significant, can nevertheless be obtained if one concentrates one‚s efforts on a specific technological field : in the present study, we shall treat of antennas for telecommunications systems. This subject is highly suitable as example and potential incubator for future achievements. The ultimate goal is to design and carry out the fabrication of a system of satellite communications adapted to the financial resources and to the development needs of {{the universities}} of the South. First of all, we will review {{the state of the art}} in satellite communication systems, both for already operating ones and also for new systems, still under development. Then we will determine which system of satellite telecommunications has a receiver and communication fees with affordable costs : our choice will be made on Worldspace satellite system, which was actually designed for developing countries. We will also review the status of planar antenna and low noise amplifier technology, and then explicit the basic challenge involved in our thesis project. One of the aims of this project is to use local wood as dielectric in SSFIP type antennas. Before using a material as dielectric in an antenna design, it must be characterized. Before carrying the characterization of local wood species, we will begin by reviewing some commonly used dielectric measurement techniques. Then we will carry out a series of measurements to characterize the species of wood growing in the Cameroonian forest. At the end of the series of measurements and according to the dielectric losses observed, we will select the species of wood best suited to make a good substrate for a microstrip antenna. Next, we will design, manufacture and test low cost antennas. These antennas must satisfy not only technical criteria compatible with those of the telecommunications system chosen but, even most importantly, it must meet socioeconomic criteria : the antennas must be manufactured with low cost and locally available materials, making use of simple technological processes. Once we have found the wood species that exhibits the lowest dielectric losses, we will simulate, and then manufacture the SSFIP type antenna with wood as substrate and aluminium as conducting element. Then we will measure its characteristics and check whether they are compatible with those of a Worldspace receiver. The signal received from the satellite by the antenna is very weak. It will be important to strengthen the received signal with a low noise amplifier (LNA) before connecting the antenna to the receiver. Thus the antenna and the LNA constitute an active antenna and form what we call here the radiofrequency (RF) front-end. We will design, manufacture and measure the LNA characteristics. A simple manufacturing process must be used to realize these antennas, because later on they must be manufactured locally in Cameroon : this is a determining challenge to ensure the economic independence, which is essential in our thesis project. Afterwards we will join the LNA to the planar antenna and connect the active antenna obtained in this manner to a commercial Worldspace receiver. Finally, we will perform receiving tests of the Worldspace radio station with the system designed. In parallel, our project includes a second goal, which presents an equivalent significance. We will use existing Matlab codes to develop an online course to teach antenna theory. In addition, at the end of the project and when the Cameroonian local manufacture would have started, we will put all algorithms used for the antenna design on the web site in a multi-media applet, together with a complete documentation of all the manufacturing technologies used. The courses that already exist in Lausanne and Yaounde, relating to the description of other types of antennas will be added, thus leading to a complete <b>teachware</b> that would ensure the durability and the dissemination of the results obtained, and would provide an invaluable tool for teaching and training...|$|E
