5|$|Charing Cross was {{a central}} staging post for coaches, but the {{congested}} narrow road was a frequent scene of accidents; here, a bonfire has caused the Salisbury Flying Coach to overturn. Festive bonfires were usual but risky: a house fire lights <b>the</b> <b>sky</b> <b>in</b> the distance. A link-boy blows on the flame of his torch, street-urchins are playing with the fire, and one of their fireworks is falling in at the coach window.|$|E

Reading through the manual, Bart discovers {{that he and the}} rest of his family have special powers. Later, Bart uses his Bartman powers to stop Jimbo, Kearney, and Dolph from {{stealing}} from the Natural History Museum, Homer uses his ability to become a huge ball and win an eating contest, Lisa uses her powers of meditation to stop a deforestation project, and Marge uses her powers to influence crowds to stop the release of Grand Theft Scratchy in Springfield, although Lisa points out it is ironic she used violence to stop a violent game.|$|E
5|$|In 1998, Labonte {{was asked}} to leave the band due to {{personal}} and artistic differences. He had ideas for a side project while {{a member of the}} band, and went on to form All That Remains. The band looked for a replacement vocalist and eventually recruited Milford, MA native Brian Fair of the pioneering metalcore band Overcast. The band had been friends with Fair for years. After a US Summer tour with Shai Hulud, Overcast disbanded and the band asked Fair if he would like to join Shadows Fall. While on tour Shadows Fall was signed to Century Media Records. The band recorded its second studio album Of One Blood with Fair on vocals in 2000, and the release included re-recorded songs from Somber Eyes to <b>the</b> <b>Sky.</b> <b>In</b> 2001, David Germain decided to leave the band due to alcoholism, and was replaced by former Stigmata and Burning Human drummer Jason Bittner.|$|E

5|$|Meanwhile, Le Verrier {{by letter}} urged Berlin Observatory {{astronomer}} Johann Gottfried Galle to search with the observatory's refractor. Heinrich d'Arrest, {{a student at}} the observatory, suggested to Galle that they could compare a recently drawn chart of <b>the</b> <b>sky</b> <b>in</b> the region of Le Verrier's predicted location with the current sky to seek the displacement characteristic of a planet, as opposed to a fixed star. On the evening of 23 September 1846, the day Galle received the letter, he discovered Neptune within 1° of where Le Verrier had predicted it to be, about 12° from Adams' prediction. Challis later realised that he had observed the planet twice, on 4 and 12 August, but did not recognise it as a planet because he lacked an up-to-date star map and was distracted by his concurrent work on comet observations.|$|E
5|$|Miyazaki co-founded Studio Ghibli in 1985. He {{directed}} several {{films with}} Ghibli, including Castle in <b>the</b> <b>Sky</b> <b>in</b> 1986, My Neighbor Totoro in 1988, Kiki's Delivery Service in 1989, and Porco Rosso in 1992. The films {{were met with}} commercial and critical success in Japan. Miyazaki's film Princess Mononoke was the first animated film to win the Japan Academy Prize for Picture of the Year, and briefly became the highest-grossing film in Japan following its release in 1997; its distribution to the Western world greatly increased Ghibli's popularity and influence outside Japan. His 2001 film Spirited Away became the highest-grossing film in Japanese history, winning the Academy Award for Best Animated Feature at the 75th Academy Awards and considered among the greatest animation films of all time. Miyazaki's later films—Howl's Moving Castle, Ponyo, and The Wind Rises—also enjoyed critical and commercial success. Following the release of The Wind Rises, Miyazaki announced his retirement from feature films, however he returned {{to work on a}} new feature film in 2016.|$|E
5|$|The Crusader army under Goffredo {{is laying}} siege to Jerusalem, where the Saracen king Argante is {{confined}} with his troops. With Goffredo are his brother Eustazio, his daughter Almirena, and the knight Rinaldo. As Goffredo sings {{of the coming}} victory, Rinaldo declares his love for Almirena, and Goffredo confirms {{that she will be}} Rinaldo's bride when Jerusalem falls. Almirena urges Rinaldo to fight boldly and assure victory. As she departs, a herald announces the approach of Argante from the city. Eustazio surmises that the king fears defeat; this seems to be confirmed when Argante, after a grandiose entrance, requests a three-day truce to which Goffredo graciously assents. After Goffredo leaves, Argante ponders his love for Armida, the Queen of Damascus who is also a powerful sorceress, and considers the help her powers might bring him. As he muses, Armida arrives from <b>the</b> <b>sky</b> <b>in</b> a fiery chariot. She has divined that the Saracens' only chance of victory lies in vanquishing Rinaldo, and has the power, she claims, to achieve this.|$|E

5|$|The axial tilt of the Earth is {{approximately}} 23.439281° with {{the axis of}} its orbit plane, always pointing towards the Celestial Poles. Due to Earth's axial tilt, the amount of sunlight reaching any given point on the surface varies {{over the course of}} the year. This causes the seasonal change in climate, with summer in the Northern Hemisphere occurring when the Tropic of Cancer is facing the Sun, and winter taking place when the Tropic of Capricorn in the Southern Hemisphere faces the Sun. During the summer, the day lasts longer, and the Sun climbs higher in <b>the</b> <b>sky.</b> <b>In</b> winter, the climate becomes cooler and the days shorter. In northern temperate latitudes, the Sun rises north of true east during the summer solstice, and sets north of true west, reversing in the winter. The Sun rises south of true east in the summer for the southern temperate zone and sets south of true west.|$|E

As she sings the song; {{by the end of the}} second chorus, black projectile smoke is scene falling from <b>the</b> <b>sky</b> <b>in</b> the distance and hits parts of the abandoned city. As more smoke falls and black leaves con-stellate, Koda collapses and sings the bridge on the ground. When the bridge section ends, rocks start levitating and the smoke rises, forming a black Dust devil in the distance. As more dust devil's form, they become large and closely devour Koda.|$|E
5|$|The temple's inner {{chambers}} {{centered on}} the sanctuary of the temple's primary god, which typically lay along the axis near {{the back of the}} temple building, and in pyramid temples directly against the pyramid base. The sanctuary was the focus of temple ritual, the place where the divine presence manifested most strongly. The form in which it manifested itself varied. In Aten temples and traditional solar shrines, the object of ritual was the sun itself or a benben stone representing the sun, worshipped in a court open to <b>the</b> <b>sky.</b> <b>In</b> many mortuary temples, the inner areas contained statues of the deceased pharaoh, or a false door where his ba was believed to appear to receive offerings.|$|E

5|$|The video {{introduces}} a sober, contemplative side of Madonna, revealing a mature mysticism. It {{begins with the}} camera skimming along a cracked, desiccated desert floor, and within seconds Madonna appears, hovering just above {{the ground in the}} distance. Her hands are covered with mehndi and an enigmatic symbol on one palm. In the video she slowly gestures and sways her arms toward <b>the</b> <b>sky</b> <b>in</b> the video, desperately pleading to her cold lover cited in the song. At one point Madonna falls, and as she hits the ground, she transforms into a flock of large, dark birds. Later, she transforms into a black dog. Three Madonnas also appear walking and crawling amid the desert throughout the video. As the song progresses, the sky darkens, and Madonna levitates from the ground. Her form then changes to a shiny black liquid, which runs along the desert floor and appears to be absorbed by the tattooed hands of another Madonna, who is curled up on the crenellated ground. The video ends with a desperate and melancholy Madonna.|$|E
5|$|William Herschel was {{the first}} {{astronomer}} to attempt to determine the distribution of stars in the sky. During the 1780s he established a series of gauges in 600 directions and counted the stars observed along each line of sight. From this he deduced {{that the number of}} stars steadily increased toward one side of <b>the</b> <b>sky,</b> <b>in</b> the direction of the Milky Way core. His son John Herschel repeated this study in the southern hemisphere and found a corresponding increase in the same direction. In addition to his other accomplishments, William Herschel is also noted for his discovery that some stars do not merely lie along the same line of sight, but are also physical companions that form binary star systems.|$|E
