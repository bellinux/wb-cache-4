5|$|The {{regular season}} home-opener was another {{victory for the}} team, as they {{defeated}} Nicholls State 85–62on November 13. Early in the game, Melquan Bolding hit <b>the</b> <b>floor</b> <b>on</b> a hard foul during a breakaway. After a few minutes, he recovered {{and went on to}} lead the team with 25points. Saunders scored 17points with 19 rebounds, his first of a long streak of double-doubles. This game was also the second and final game of B.J. Monteiro's 2-game suspension following allegations of participating in a robbery. Three days later, it was announced that Bolding had fractured his wrist when he was fouled, and would be unable to play for 4–6weeks.|$|E

5|$|Although {{rain fell}} on Saturday morning, the track had dried by {{the start of}} the final free {{practice}} session. Lewis Hamilton again set the fastest time with 1:25.624, less than two-tenths of a second in front of teammate Rosberg, with Sebastian Vettel in third position close behind. The fastest times had been set on the super-soft tyre compound. However, Mercedes's advantage over Ferrari proved more significant, up to seven-tenths of a second on the harder soft compound, the tyre most likely {{to be used in the}} race. Toro Rosso confirmed their good pace for the weekend with fourth and sixth place for Carlos Sainz and Max Verstappen respectively, being about half a second quicker than their sister team, Red Bull Racing. A major incident occurred just seconds after the beginning of the practice session, when Rio Haryanto and Romain Grosjean collided in the pit lane. Both cars needed to equip new front wings and Haas also changed <b>the</b> <b>floor</b> <b>on</b> Grosjean's car. Haryanto was later issued a three-place grid penalty for the incident, as well as two penalty points added to his licence.|$|E

She regained her national champion title on the beam and defended her national title on the uneven bars for the fourth consecutive year, scoring a 17.050 in preliminaries and a 17.100 in finals, the highest recorded score for any American gymnast at any event since the advent of the new Code of Points. In June, Liukin competed in the U.S. Olympic Trials in Philadelphia, finishing second behind Johnson and earning a berth on the American team for Beijing.|$|E
5|$|In Garrard's November 5, 1798, State of the Commonwealth address, he {{encouraged}} the General Assembly to declare its {{views on the}} Alien and Sedition Acts. Breckinridge was chosen as chairman of a three-person committee {{to carry out the}} governor's charge. The resolutions that the committee brought to <b>the</b> <b>floor</b> <b>on</b> November 10 became known as the Kentucky Resolutions. The first seven were exactly as Jefferson had written them, but Breckinridge modified the last two, eliminating Jefferson's suggestion of nullifying the unpopular acts. During the debate on the House floor, Breckinridge endorsed nullification if Congress would not repeal the acts after a majority of states declared their opposition to them. Federalist William Murray led opposition to the resolutions in the House but was the only dissenting vote on five of the nine; John Pope led similarly unsuccessful Federalist opposition in the Senate. Upon concurrence of both houses, Garrard signed the resolutions.|$|E

5|$|Popping as an {{umbrella}} term also includes gliding. Gliding is a lower body dance performed {{with little to}} no movements in the chest or arms. In gliding a dancer appears {{as if they are}} drifting across <b>the</b> <b>floor</b> <b>on</b> ice. Opposite from gliding is tutting, an upper body dance that uses the arms, hands, and wrists to form right angles and create geometric box-like shapes. Tutting can be done primarily with the fingers rather than the arms. This method is called finger tutting. In both variations the movements are intricate, linear, and form 90° or 45° angles. In practice, tutting looks like the characters on the art of ancient Egypt, hence the name—a reference to King Tut.|$|E
5|$|The prison {{reformer}} John Howard travelled {{around the}} country in the 1770s inspecting jails, and presented his research in The State of the Prisons in England and Wales (1777). In a jail owned by the Bishop of Ely, Howard wrote, prisoners had ten years earlier been kept chained to <b>the</b> <b>floor</b> <b>on</b> their backs, with spiked collars round their necks and iron bars over their legs. The Duke of Portland had a one-room cellar in Chesterfield that housed four prisoners, with no straw or heat, which had not been cleaned for months. Lord Arundel owned a jail in Penzance, where Howard found a debtor in a room 11ftx11ft and 6ft high, with a small window. The door of the room had not been opened for four weeks.|$|E
5|$|The show's title {{character}} is {{portrayed in the}} two pilots by Pal, the MGM film Lassie. Thereafter, five of his male descendants played the role. His son Lassie Junior performed through the Jeff years and first two Timmy years before retiring in 1959 to battle cancer. Though he recovered, Lassie Junior never worked the show again. His son Spook was rushed into the series while his brother Baby was in training for the role. Spook was inadequately prepared and never became comfortable on the set after an overhead light crashed to <b>the</b> <b>floor</b> <b>on</b> his first day. Weatherwax, however, coaxed a natural and seemingly confident performance from the frightened dog, and some regard Spook's portrayal as Weatherwax's finest work. Spook played the role {{in the spring and}} fall of 1960. Baby, son of Lassie Junior and brother to Spook, worked the show for six years. He appeared in the last Timmy years, and two of the Forest Service seasons. Baby died at eight years of age, the only Lassie not to live at least seventeen years. He was followed in the role by Mire who played Lassie for five years. He portrayed the fictional collie in the syndicated seasons.|$|E

25|$|Since its inception, Chachachá {{music had}} a close {{relationship}} with the dancer's steps. The well-known name Chachachá came into being {{with the help of the}} dancers at the Silver Star Club in Havana. When the dance was coupled to the rhythm of the music, it became evident that the dancer's feet were making a peculiar sound as they grazed <b>the</b> <b>floor</b> <b>on</b> three successive beats. It was like an onomatopoeia that sounded as: Chachachá. From this peculiar sound, a music genre was born which motivated people from around the world to dance at its catchy rhythm.|$|E

Above this he alternated male and female prophets, with Jonah over the altar. On the highest section, Michelangelo painted nine stories from the Book of Genesis. He was originally commissioned to paint only 12 figures, the Apostles. He turned down the commission because he saw himself as a sculptor, not a painter. The Pope offered to allow Michelangelo to paint biblical scenes of his own choice as a compromise. After the work was finished, {{there were more than}} 300. His figures showed the creation, Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden, and the Great Flood.|$|E

25|$|The match {{started with}} the first two {{competitors}} in the ring, the two wrestlers who are next in the rotation were on the apron and the remaining eight wrestlers were on <b>the</b> <b>floor</b> <b>on</b> their respective sides of the ring. The first elimination came at 6:14 when Volador Jr. pinned Luciferno, giving the tecnico side a six-on-five advantage. At 10:15 Bárbaro Cavernario pinned Titán to even the sides. At one point Dragon Lee and Mephisto collided mid ring, allowing Hechicero to pin Dragon Lee while Volador Jr. pinned Mephisto {{at the same time}} for a double elimination. Late in the match Volador Jr. and Carístico bumped into each other during the match and started to argue and push each other around despite being on the same team. The argument was broken up by Místico to allow the match to continue. In the final minutes of the elimination match Volador Jr., Euforia and Ángel de Oro were all in the ring at the same time for the final segment of the match. Euforia forced Volador Jr. to submit, followed by Ángel de Oro quickly pinning Euforia to win the match and become a three time Rey del Aire winner.|$|E
25|$|Field of Empty Chairs: 168 empty chairs hand-crafted from glass, bronze, {{and stone}} {{represent}} {{those who lost}} their lives, with a name etched in the glass base of each. They sit on {{the site where the}} Murrah Building once stood. The chairs represent the empty chairs at the dinner tables of the victims' families. The chairs are arranged in nine rows to symbolize the nine floors of the building; each person's chair is on the row (or <b>the</b> <b>floor)</b> <b>on</b> which the person worked or was located when the bomb went off. The chairs are also grouped according to the blast pattern, with the most chairs nearest the most heavily damaged portion of the building. The westernmost column of five chairs represents the five people who died but were not in the Murrah Building (two in the Water Resources Board building, one in the Athenian Building, one outside near the building, and one rescuer). The 19 smaller chairs represent the children killed in the bombing. Three unborn children died along with their mothers, and they are listed on their mothers' chairs beneath their mothers' names.|$|E
25|$|The {{first leg}} of United's quarter-final against Roma was played at the Stadio Olimpico on 1 April 2008. Ryan Giggs started the match on the bench, which meant that Rio Ferdinand was handed the {{captaincy}} and Park Ji-sung was given his first Champions League appearance of the season, while Michael Carrick {{was able to take}} his position in the midfield three despite having missed the team's training session the day before. The match started fairly evenly, but it was Roma who had the first meaningful attempt on goal, with Christian Panucci heading just over from a corner. On the half hour, United's defence suffered a major setback as Nemanja Vidić fell awkwardly after jumping for a header. His place in central defence was taken by John O'Shea. Nevertheless, with just five minutes of the half remaining, the ball broke to Paul Scholes on the right hand side of the Roma penalty area. With his options limited, he played a ball at head-height into the centre of the penalty area, where Cristiano Ronaldo, who had just run full speed from near the centre circle, was ready to power a header past Roma keeper Doni. Buoyed by the cushion of the away goal, United started the second half confidently, prising a desperate Roma side apart with crisp passing along <b>the</b> <b>floor.</b> <b>On</b> the hour mark, in response to a header on goal by Mirko Vučinić that brought about a world class save from Edwin van der Sar, Alex Ferguson called for his team to adopt a more conservative formation, bringing on Owen Hargreaves to replace Anderson. United seemed more comfortable playing in a 4–4–2 formation, and the change paid immediate dividends, as Rooney pounced on Doni's mishandling of Park's header to poke the ball home for 2–0. The Reds continued to threaten, but were forced to defend well to prevent Roma from taking any goals with them to Old Trafford. The match finished 2–0, putting United in a comfortable position going into the second leg on 9 April.|$|E

500|$|Divine became {{increasingly}} known for outlandish stunts onstage, each {{time trying to}} outdo {{what he had done}} before. At one performance in London's Hippodrome coinciding with American Independence Day, Divine rose up from <b>the</b> <b>floor</b> <b>on</b> a hydraulic lift, draped in the American flag, and declared: [...] "I'm here representing Freedom, Liberty, Family Values, and the fucking American Way of Life." [...] When he performed at the London Gay Pride parade, he sang on the roof of a hired pleasure boat that floated down the Thames past Jubilee Gardens. At a performance Divine gave at the Hippodrome {{in the last year of}} his life, he appeared onstage riding an infant elephant which had been hired for the occasion. Divine was nevertheless not happy with being known primarily for his drag act, and told an interviewer that [...] "my favorite part of drag is getting out of it. Drag is my work clothes. I only put it on when someone pays me to", a view he echoed to his friends.|$|E
500|$|Lyrically, {{the song}} is {{about a woman who}} teaches her partner how to love her in the right way, {{throughout}} which she uses sexual references. MTV News' Jocelyn Vena concluded that song has [...] "sassy" [...] lyrics, but its melody is soft enough and makes you forget that [...] "the track is actually kind of dirty". Chris Coplan of Consequence of Sound stated that during the interpretation of the lyrics, Rihanna is proud and sexual and her confidence comes from elsewhere. Rihanna reveals her sex fantasies through singing the lyrics: [...] "I'mma do it do it do it/On the bed on <b>the</b> <b>floor</b> <b>on</b> the couch/Only cause your lips say make it to my mouth/Just because I can't kiss back/Doesn't mean you can't kiss that", which were described as the [...] "nastiest" [...] on the song by Brad Wete of Complex. As the song continues further, Rihanna is [...] "not-so-subtly" [...] instructing her lover within the lines [...] "It’s your turn now / Watch and learn now / Watch and learn how / If you learn how / I'll stay".|$|E
