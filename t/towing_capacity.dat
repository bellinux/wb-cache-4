The Eagle station wagon remained in production for one model year after Chrysler acquired AMC in 1987.|$|E
25|$|In 2000, he {{announced}} that the company would achieve a 25% improvement in fuel efficiency in the company's light truck fleet, including SUVs, by mid-decade. That commitment proved to be impractical, given consumer preference for heavy <b>towing</b> <b>capacity</b> and large, powerful engines in their trucks; the company announced in 2003 that competitive market conditions and technological and cost challenges would prevent it from achieving the goal. Ford terminated its ongoing electric vehicle program as impractical and unaffordable from a profitable business standpoint. Some environmentalists questioned Bill Ford and the Company's commitment to environmental concerns, and others pointed to Ford Motor Company's continued marketing of the fuel-thirsty SUVs as evidence of an other-than-green corporate agenda. Ford's position {{is that for the}} company to remain profitable and competitive (and remain in business), it must supply what customers demand. During 2006, there was an unexpectedly large swing in consumer demand away from pickups and SUVs to smaller cars and crossover vehicles, due to rapid increases in gasoline prices, and Ford Motor Company was largely unprepared for such a sudden shift in demand.|$|E

500|$|Due to the {{cessation}} of production of these tanks, {{and the absence of}} spare parts being made, it was decided that the summer campaign of 1941 was to be their last. The fighting in Russia exposed the vehicle's unsuitability for cold weather operations and general unreliability. This weakness, in addition to their thin armour and inadequate firepower, resulted in the 6th Panzer Division being reequipped with German tanks on its withdrawal from Russia in April 1942. All 26 remaining Panzer 35(t)s still in working condition in 1942 were sold to Romania.

50|$|GCWR {{primarily}} {{includes the}} powertrain's capabilities. Any of the powertrain's components, or combinations of, may create the weakest {{link in the}} powertrain. Mechanically, the differential gear ratio {{is not necessarily a}} weak link, but rather a ratio of power reduction or increase to the wheels depending on the ratio. A differential ratio of 3.42:1 will cause the engine and transmission to work harder than if the ratio was 4.10:1 with the same amount of weight hauled or towed. The tow vehicle will still move the weight regardless of the differential gear ratio. But a lower transmission gear may have to be used move the weight, therefore increasing engine RPM, and fuel cost, and may increase additional stress on the engine and/or transmission, therefore increasing the risk of premature wear and breakdowns. It may be noted that two identical vehicles with the only mechanical difference being the gear ratio will have different GCWRs and maximum <b>towing</b> <b>capacities.</b>|$|R

40|$|The {{behaviour}} {{of saturated}} soft clays subjected to cyclic Loading is of considerable {{importance in the}} design of railway subgrades. Soft clays can be extensively found in many coastal regions of Australia up to significant depths, including the coastal belt and the central part of NSW. These soft clay deposits are characterized by very <b>tow</b> bearing <b>capacity</b> and excessive settlement. The increase in generated excess pore pressures due to heavy freight trains significantly reduces the bearing capacity and causes serious damage to the rail infrastructure such as clay pumping underneath tracks and excessive subsidence. The use of prefabricated vertical drains (PVDs) is one of the popular methods for soft ground improvement. In this paper, the behaviour of soft clay subjected to cyclic toads is investigated using large-scale triaxial tests. Cyclic triaxial tests on rebounded soft clay samples with vertical drains have been carried out using a large-scale triaxial apparatus designed and built at the University of Wollongong. The improvement gained by drained compression using PVDS is presented and discussed in terms of the pore pressure ratio. An attempt is also made to modes such behaviour numerically in CRISP finite element code...|$|R

It was accompanied by a totally new aluminum intake manifold with improved flow keeping the Holley 2300 two-barrel carburetor. These improvements made the 1977 American Rally the best-performing model of its series, even surpassing the high compression 1972 model. Despite this, advertised horsepower and torque ratings were the same as the year before. The power increase allowed the use of a new 3.07:1 rear differential gear ratio for better economy and top speed without losing acceleration and <b>towing</b> <b>capacity.</b> The front high-back bucket seats obtained new patterns {{and for the first time}} since 1972 reclining mechanism (as standard equipment), three-point front seatbelts with double retractable mechanism were added, a new VAM-designed digital tachometer took the place of the conventional analog unit in the midyear. In the exterior, the largest novelty of the year was the application of the new Gremlin front clip. New decals covering only the front fenders in their top sides started near the doors all the way to the marker lights, between the lights and stripe was a [...] "Rally 4.6" [...] sticker. Like the three luxury versions of the line for the year, the 1977 American Rally was the first unit of its series to offer the original factory air conditioning system as an option.
