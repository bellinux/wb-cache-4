5|$|Another {{economic}} measure, {{closely related}} <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>energy</b> payback time, is the energy returned on energy invested (EROEI) or energy {{return on investment}} (EROI), which is the ratio of electricity generated divided by the energy required to build and maintain the equipment. (This {{is not the same}} as the economic return on investment (ROI), which varies according to local energy prices, subsidies available and metering techniques.) With expected lifetimes of 30 years, the EROEI of PV systems are in the range of 10 to 30, thus generating enough energy over their lifetimes to reproduce themselves many times (6-31 reproductions) depending on what type of material, balance of system (BOS), and the geographic location of the system.|$|E

For example, in the Epipaleolithic of the Levant, between c. 14,500 and 11,500 BP, both waterfowl and migratory birds were eaten. Archaeologists have studied the return in terms of energy from captured food compared <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>energy</b> expended to capture it; birds provide a smaller return than larger game such as deer, but better than many plant materials. For example waterfowl captured in a drive can yield a return of around 2,000 kcal/hour, whereas an antelope can yield as much as 31,000 kcal/hour, and wild rye around 1,000 kcal/hour.|$|E

5|$|General {{relativity}} is {{the geometric}} theory of gravitation published by Albert Einstein in 1915 {{and the current}} description of gravitation in modern physics. It {{is the basis of}} current cosmological models of the Universe. General relativity generalizes special relativity and Newton's law of universal gravitation, providing a unified description of gravity as a geometric property of space and time, or spacetime. In particular, the curvature of spacetime is directly related <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>energy</b> and momentum of whatever matter and radiation are present. The relation is specified by the Einstein field equations, a system of partial differential equations. In general relativity, the distribution of matter and energy determines the geometry of spacetime, which in turn describes the acceleration of matter. Therefore, solutions of the Einstein field equations describe the evolution of the Universe. Combined with measurements of the amount, type, and distribution of matter in the Universe, the equations of general relativity describe the evolution of the Universe over time.|$|E
5|$|In {{contrast}} {{to the belief that}} an extraterrestrial civilization would want to establish an empire, Ćirković proposes that an extraterrestrial civilization would maintain equilibrium rather than expand outward. In such an equilibrium, a civilization would only colonize a small number of stars, aiming to maximize efficiency rather than to expand massive and unsustainable imperial structures. This contrasts with the classic Kardashev Type III civilization, which has access <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>energy</b> output of an entire galaxy and is not subject to any limits on its future expansion. According to this view, advanced civilizations may not resemble the classic examples in science fiction, but might more closely reflect the small, independent Greek city-states, with an emphasis on cultural rather than territorial growth.|$|E
5|$|It is {{possible}} to design linear analogue mechanical filters using mechanical components which filter mechanical vibrations or acoustic waves. While there are few applications for such devices in mechanics per se, {{they can be used}} in electronics with the addition of transducers to convert to and from the electrical domain. Indeed, some of the earliest ideas for filters were acoustic resonators because the electronics technology was poorly understood at the time. In principle, the design of such filters can be achieved entirely in terms of the electronic counterparts of mechanical quantities, with kinetic energy, potential energy and heat energy corresponding <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>energy</b> in inductors, capacitors and resistors respectively.|$|E
40|$|Increasing <b>the</b> <b>energy</b> {{efficiency}} of manufacturing plants {{will reduce the}} production costs and environmental impact. In order to analyse and improve <b>the</b> <b>energy</b> {{efficiency of}} manufacturing plants, however, we need models <b>to</b> evaluate <b>the</b> <b>energy</b> footprints of <b>the</b> plants. A key challenge of estimating plant-level footprints is that systemic methods of connecting information on the product, machine and plant levels are not available. Thus, we propose methods to parameterise product-level elements and to model machine-level factors based on those elements. From the machine-level models, the proposed approach performs simulation experiments and provides <b>the</b> <b>energy</b> footprints in closed-form equations for the plant level. We also suggest that the resulting model can be combined with probabilistic techniques <b>to</b> benchmark <b>the</b> <b>energy</b> efficiency of plants at the industry level.

5|$|Molten salt can be {{employed}} as a thermal energy storage method to retain thermal energy collected by a solar tower or solar trough of a concentrated solar power plant, {{so that it can}} be used to generate electricity in bad weather or at night. It was demonstrated in the Solar Two project from 1995–1999. The system is predicted to have an annual efficiency of 99%, a reference <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>energy</b> retained by storing heat before turning it into electricity, versus converting heat directly into electricity. The molten salt mixtures vary. The most extended mixture contains sodium nitrate, potassium nitrate and calcium nitrate.

5|$|Seyfert's Sextet is a {{group of}} six galaxies, four of which are {{interacting}} gravitationally and two of which simply appear {{to be a part of}} the group despite their greater distance. The gravitationally bound cluster lies at a distance of 190 million light-years from Earth and is approximately 100,000 light-years across, making Seyfert's Sextet one of the densest galaxy group known. Astronomers predict that the four interacting galaxies will eventually merge to form a large elliptical galaxy. The radio source 3C 326 was originally though to emanate from a giant elliptical galaxy. However, in 1990, it was shown that the source is instead a brighter, smaller galaxy a few arcseconds north. This object, designated 3C 326 N, has enough gas for star formation, but is being inhibited due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>energy</b> from the radio galaxy nucleus.|$|E
40|$|A {{particular}} type of surface chemical reaction resulted in direct charge ejection.

They organized fairs, parties, and social gatherings. Unlike many middle-class women activists, the operatives found considerable support from working-class men who welcomed them into their reform organizations and advocated for their treatment as equals.|$|E

5|$|Mitochondria divide by binary fission, {{similar to}} {{bacterial}} cell division. The regulation of this division differs between eukaryotes. In many single-celled eukaryotes, their growth and division {{is linked to}} the cell cycle. For example, a single mitochondrion may divide synchronously with the nucleus. This division and segregation process must be tightly controlled so that each daughter cell receives at least one mitochondrion. In other eukaryotes (in mammals for example), mitochondria may replicate their DNA and divide mainly in response <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>energy</b> needs of the cell, rather than in phase with the cell cycle. When the energy needs of a cell are high, mitochondria grow and divide. When the energy use is low, mitochondria are destroyed or become inactive. In such examples, and in contrast to the situation in many single celled eukaryotes, mitochondria are apparently randomly distributed to the daughter cells during the division of the cytoplasm. Understanding of mitochondrial dynamics, which is described as the balance between mitochondrial fusion and fission, has revealed that functional and structural alterations in mitochondrial morphology are important factors in pathologies associated with several disease conditions.|$|E

5|$|The {{intertropical}} {{convergence zone}} spawned a tropical depression on October31 a short distance to south of easternmost Cuba. The system tracked northward and crossed over eastern Cuba, and the system initially had characteristics of an extratropical cyclone. It eventually acquired tropical features and intensified into Tropical Storm Greta on November1. A high pressure area east of the Mid-Atlantic states caused the depression {{to turn to the}} south on November2 and loop to the southeast. Later that day the depression intensified into Tropical Storm Greta to the northeast of the Bahamas. It attained hurricane status on November4 while maintaining a large size (in fact, becoming one of the largest tropical cyclones known in the Atlantic basin); such strengthening is unusual in storms moving in a southeast trajectory. Greta turned to the east and later northeast, reaching its peak of 100mph (155km/h) late on November4 due <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>energy</b> transfer between levels of the atmosphere. Cooler waters caused subsequent weakening and gradual loss of tropical characteristics, and Greta transitioned into an extratropical storm on November6, dissipating the next day.|$|E
