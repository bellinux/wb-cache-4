40|$|The {{domain wall}} motion in a {{magnetic}} nanowire is examined theoretically in the regime where the domain wall driving force is weak and its competition against disorders is assisted by <b>thermal</b> <b>agitations.</b> Two types of driving forces are considered; magnetic field and current. While the field induces the domain wall motion through the Zeeman energy, the current induces the domain wall motion by generating the spin transfer torque, of which effects in this regime remain controversial. The spin transfer torque has two mutually orthogonal vector components, the adiabatic spin transfer torque and the nonadiabatic spin transfer torque. We investigate separate {{effects of the}} two components on the domain wall depinning rate in one-dimensional systems and on the domain wall creep velocity in two-dimensional systems, both below the Walker breakdown threshold. In addition to the leading order contribution coming from the field and/or the nonadiabatic spin transfer torque, {{we find that the}} adiabatic spin transfer torque generates corrections, which can be of relevance for an unambiguous analysis of experimental results. For instance, it is demonstrated that the neglect of the corrections in experimental analysis may lead to incorrect evaluation of the nonadiabaticity parameter.

Computational methods for conventional {{overall heat transfer coefficient}} (U) and fluid to particle heat transfer coefficient (hfp) were found unsuitable in high viscosity fluids. A methodology for evaluating an apparent heat transfer coefficient (hap) between retort medium and particle, and an apparent overall heat transfer coefficient Ua between retort medium and can fluid was proposed. Use of h ap and Ua concepts permitted direct predictions of particle temperature and lethality based on retort temperature. An L- 16 orthogonal experimental design of experiments was carried out to select system factors that significantly affected hap and U a values for particles in high viscosity non-Newtonian and Newtonian fluids. Experiments using central composite rotatable design and full factorial design were carried out to study the effects of selected significant factors on hap and Ua. Using all data obtained, dimensionless correlations were developed for the prediction of hap and Ua values. The developed correlations showed a good agreement with the experimental data. More precise predictions were achieved with trained artificial neural network (ANN) models. The results of ANN models could be compiled using algebraic equations and were included so that hap and Ua values could be predicted without actually using the ANN software. A flow visualization study was conducted to better understand the heat transfer behavior in high viscosity fluids. Results showed that in particulate high viscosity fluids, the particle liquid relative movement was very weak, implying that the heat transfer between them could converge to conduction-conduction rather than convection-conduction, which results in erroneous and unusually large hfp values...|$|R

Using a common garden experimental design involving eight wild populations of Salvelinus fontinalis (brook trout), we studied how effective population size (Ne), divergence (QST, km), and environmental dissimilarity (pH, temperature) may influence hybridization outcomes for fitness related traits under moderate climate warming. Additionally, we looked at the ability of six of these populations to tolerate acute thermal warming, and whether or not this tolerance could be altered by hybridizing populations. Critical thermal maximum (CTmax) assays were conducted on juveniles from each population to assess <b>thermal</b> tolerance, and <b>agitation</b> temperature (a behavioural metric quantifying temperature at the onset of refugia-seeking behaviour) was recorded for assessing behavioural changes to elevated temperatures. Gametes were collected from different-sized, isolated populations of brook trout, and crossed in the lab. Fitness-related traits were compared between pure and F 1 hybrid crosses via common garden experimental design. We had the unique opportunity to jointly investigate how these factors influence multiple metrics of hybrid fitness in wild, isolated, and varyingly-sized populations of a vertebrate species inhabiting a relatively undisturbed environment. Although population size and environmental dissimilarity were found to significantly affect hybrid fitness, these relationships were biologically weak. Although significant differences in CTmax were found between populations, this difference was at most 0. 68 °C (29. 11 - 29. 79 °C), and no effect of hybridization was seen despite varying thermal regimes between these populations’ wild streams. These results will provide guidance to small population and captive-breeding conservation programs, as the lack of a strong relationship between hybridization and fitness encourages population-specific approach to genetic rescue projects. Additionally, this study highlights the level to which thermal tolerance is conserved between isolated populations of a vertebrate species, in the face of climate warming...|$|R

Evaluation of heat transfer coefficients (overall, U and fluid to particle, hfp) associated with canned liquid/particle mixtures, while they are subjected to free axial motion is difficult because of the problems involved with attaching temperature measuring devices to liquid and particles without affecting their normal motion. A new methodology was developed to evaluate U and hfp in Newtonian liquids. The methodology involved first correlating U and hfp {{as a function of}} input variables for cans in fixed axial mode of rotation in which both particle and fluid temperatures were measured using thin wire thermocouples. Subsequently, only liquid temperatures were measured in cans using wireless sensors in the free axial mode, and hfp values were empirically computed from the developed correlations and the measured temperatures. An L- 16 orthogonal experimental design of experiment was carried out to select system and product parameters that significantly influence hfp and U for particles in the Newtonian liquid. With significant parameters selected, a response surface methodology and two full factorial experimental designs were used to relate U and hfp to process variables in each mode of rotation (fixed and free axial modes). Dimensionless correlations were then developed using the evaluated data for heat transfer coefficients (U and hfp), in canned high viscosity Newtonian liquids (with and without particles) using stepwise multiple non-linear-regressions of significant dimensionless groups. In free axial mode, combining the natural and forced convection, Nu = A 1 (GrxPr) A 2 + A 3 (Re) A 4 (Pr) A 5 FrA 6 (rhop/rhop 1) A 7 (e/ 100 -e) A 8 (dp/Dc) A 9 (Kp/K 1) A 10 yielded a higher R 2 (0. 93) than using a pure forced convection model when particles were present in the can.

Silica particles of different morphology were used as a carrier material for protein immobilisation and fatty acids coating was performed using supercritical carbon dioxide (CO 2) as a processing media. The melting behaviour of saturated fatty acids (lauric, myristic, palmitic and stearic acid) and pluronics (F- 38, F- 68, F- 77, F- 127 and F- 108) were studied under pressurised CO 2 to identify the coating parameters. These excipients showed a melting point depression {{in the range of}} 10 to 20 °C in pressurised CO 2. In the case of fatty acids the decrease in melting point was inversely proportional to the carbon chain length and directly related to the polarity of carbonyl group. Whereas, melting point depression for all pluronics was similar and was attributed to the high cohesive energy density of these polymers. This phenomenon was used to encapsulate the thermolabile protein molecules in pressurised CO 2 at low temperatures. The stability of bovine haemoglobin (bHb) was studied by ultraviolet-visible and circular dichroism spectroscopy. <b>Thermal,</b> storage and <b>agitation</b> stability were studied to identify the processing parameters for the storage, adsorption and desorption processes. Three morphologically different silica particles were studied as potential inorganic carrier for the protein. The particles were characterised by nitrogen adsorption and scanning electron microscopy and the maximum protein adsorption and kinetics was determined at pH 6. The bHb adsorption on silica was found to be irreversible, hence application of pluronics as a displacer was also studied. Finally, the bHb adsorbed particles were coated with fatty acids by supercritical fluid processing and solvent evaporation methods. The highest bHb release was obtained from SFP (Syloid FP- 244) silica in comparison to other silica particles in pH 6. 8 phosphate buffer. SFP based formulation also showed a trend in the protein release which was dependent on the solubility of fatty acids in the release media. The highest release was obtained from myristic acid coated solid core drug delivery system (SCDDS) followed by palmitic and stearic acid. Lauric acid coated SFP formulations led to changes in protein conformations, hence omitted from these studies. The release studies of myristic acid based SCDDS in simulated gastric and intestinal fluids showed that fatty acid coating provided enteric properties to the formulation. It can be concluded from these studies that SCDDS prepared using mesoporous silica as core and fatty acids as coating material can be an effective drug delivery system for the oral delivery of biomolecules...|$|R
