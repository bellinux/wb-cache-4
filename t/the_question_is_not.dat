500|$|When Alberta and Saskatchewan {{were made}} provinces in 1905, the federal {{government}} retained control over their lands and natural resources, which made the new provinces unique in Canada. [...] The Rutherford government acquiesced to this state of affairs; because the terms of confederation had been drawn up by the Liberal government of Sir Wilfrid Laurier, it was natural for the provincial Liberal Party to cast itself as their defender. [...] In this capacity, Rutherford pointed to the $375,000 per year that the provincial government received from {{the federal government}} as compensation. [...] In 1910, however, Liberal MLA Alwyn Bramley-Moore (who was a staunch provincial rights advocate and who many years later would be called [...] "Alberta's first separatist" [...] by the Edmonton Journal) moved a resolution calling on the Sifton government to [...] "take such steps as may be deemed necessary to acquire the control of all such natural resources as are of purely local concern". [...] Sifton responded that it was already the intention of his government to begin negotiations with the federal government to this end. [...] He asserted [...] "I have always believed... that we should administer our mines and timber.

500|$|Realizing that Congress {{might not}} pass {{legislation}} for a coin to commemorate a film industry celebration, the organizers sought a historical event {{with a major}} anniversary to occur in 1923, which could be honored both at the fair and on the coin. [...] The obvious candidate was the Boston Tea Party of 1773, but according to numismatists Anthony Swiatek and Walter Breen in their volume on U.S. commemorative coins, that episode [...] "could not be tortured into even the vaguest relevance to California, let alone to Los Angeles". On December18, 1922, California Congressman Walter Franklin Lineberger introduced a bill to strike a half dollar in commemoration of the centennial of the Monroe Doctrine, with the Los Angeles Clearing House (an association of banks) given the exclusive right to purchase the pieces from the government at face value. [...] Lineberger claimed that Monroe's declaration had kept California, then owned by Mexico, {{out of the hands}} of European powers. [...] The bill was questioned in the House of Representatives by Michigan Congressman Louis Cramton, and in the Senate by Vermont's Frank Greene, who stated, [...] "it seems to me that <b>the</b> <b>question</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> one of selling a coin at a particular value or a particular place. The question is whether the United States government is going to go on from year to year submitting its coinage to this—well—harlotry."

2500|$|In other words, whereas McGrew {{argues that}} anthropologists {{must focus on}} {{behaviors}} like communication and tool-use {{because they have no}} access to the mind, Holloway argues that human language and tool-use, including the earliest stone tools in the fossil record 2.6 million years ago, are highly suggestive of cognitive differences between humans and non-humans, and that such cognitive differences in turn explain human evolution. For Holloway, <b>the</b> <b>question</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> whether other primates communicate, learn or make tools, but the way they do these things. [...] "Washing potatoes in the ocean ... stripping branches of leaves to get termites," [...] and other examples of primate tool-use and learning [...] "are iconic, and there is no feedback from the environment to the animal." [...] Human tools, however, express an independence from natural form that manifests symbolic thinking. [...] "In the preparation of the stick for termite-eating, the relation between product and raw material is iconic. [...] In the making of a stone tool, in contrast, there is no necessary relation between the form of the final product and the original material." ...|$|E
2500|$|Sandiford appealed {{against this}} decision, {{but it was}} again {{rejected}} at the High Court in April 2013, by a three-judge panel, chaired by Master of the Rolls Lord Dyson. By then Sandiford's first line of appeal against her death sentence had been rejected, and she required £6,000 towards her legal costs for {{the next stage of}} her appeal. In his summing up on 22 April Lord Dyson said that it was [...] "most unfortunate" [...] Sandiford required [...] "relatively speaking ... very small sum indeed" [...] for her legal costs, but that this [...] "cannot affect the principle that we have had to consider and it cannot affect our decision. It may be that other means may be found to secure the relatively small sum {{in the course of the}} next few days." [...] The judges published their reasons for rejecting the appeal on 22 May. In the written judgement, Lord Dyson said that Sandiford had argued the Foreign Secretary's position was [...] "unlawful" [...] but that the High Court had been [...] "right to conclude" [...] it was not. [...] "As the Secretary of State concedes, it would be possible to produce a policy under which funds for legal representation were made available to British nationals in certain defined circumstances...But <b>the</b> <b>question</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> whether the Secretary of State could produce a different policy which many would regard as fairer and more reasonable and humane than the present policy.

2500|$|On 13 September 2010, the U.S. version adopted its [...] "shuffle format". Ten {{questions}} are asked in round one, each assigned one of ten different money amounts. The dollar values are randomised {{at the beginning}} of the game. The contestant is then shown the original order of difficulty for the ten questions as well as their categories, and those are then randomised as well. This means that the difficulty of <b>the</b> <b>question</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> tied to its value. The dollar values for each question remain hidden until a contestant either provides a correct answer or chooses to [...] "jump" [...] their question. In this format, the value of each question answered correctly is added to the contestant's bank, for a maximum total of $68,600. A contestant who completes the round successfully can walk at any subsequent point with all the money in their bank, or can walk before the round is completed with half that amount (e.g., a contestant who banked $30,000 would leave with $15,000). Contestants who give an incorrect answer at any point in the round leave with $1,000. After completing round one, the contestant moves on to a second round of gameplay (the [...] "Classic Millionaire" [...] round), in which four non-categorised {{questions are}} played for set non-cumulative values and a correct answer augments the contestant's winnings to that point, as in the older formats. The contestant is now allowed to walk away with all the money in their bank; an incorrect answer drops their winnings to $25,000. The shuffle format was replaced with a modified version of the original format (with only 14 questions) for the fourteenth syndicated season; the values of the last four questions remain unchanged.|$|E
