5|$|In his memoirs, Ismay {{recalled}} {{that he never}} solved the puzzle of how to convey his very genuine concerns of the time to <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>people.</b> A thrown sticky bomb simply would not reliably stick to a vertical surface. However, the bomb would stick if it was thrown onto {{the top of a}} tank where the plates were more or less horizontal – and thinner – but this reduced the throwing range to twenty yards at the most – getting that close would only be possible in an ambush or in street fighting.|$|E

Using his {{background}} with Air Force projects, Mueller sought Webb's permission to bring in skilled Air Force program managers. He proposed Minuteman program director Colonel Samuel C. Phillips as Apollo program director in OMSF. Webb agreed, and so did AFSC chief General Bernard Schriever. Phillips in turn agreed and brought with him 42 mid-grade officers and eventually 124 more junior officers. Ultimately, over 400 experienced military officers worked on Apollo and other NASA programs during the 1960s.|$|E

25|$|Hotels {{use this}} system in largely the same way, to {{calculate}} the rates, rooms and restrictions on sales in order to best maximize their return. These systems measure constrained and unconstrained demand along with pace to gauge which restrictions to implement, e.g. length of stay, non-refundable rate, or close to arrival. Yield management teams in the hotel industry have evolved tremendously over the last 10 years and in this global economy targeting the right distribution channels, controlling costs, and having the right market mix {{plays an important role}} in yield management.

25|$|Information Assurance (IA) is {{the process}} of getting the right {{information}} to <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>people</b> at the right time. IA adds business benefit through the use of Information Risk Management, Trust Management, Resilience, appropriate Architecture, system safety, and security, which increases the utility of information to authorized users and reduces the utility of information to those unauthorized. It is strongly related to the field of information security, and also with business continuity. IA relates more to the business level and strategic risk management of information and related systems, rather than the creation and application of security controls. Therefore, in addition to defending against malicious hackers and code (e.g., viruses), IA practitioners consider corporate governance issues such as privacy, regulatory and standards compliance, auditing, business continuity, and disaster recovery as they relate to information systems. Further, while information security draws primarily from computer science, IA is an interdisciplinary field requiring expertise in business, accounting, user experience, fraud examination, forensic science, management science, systems engineering, security engineering, and criminology, in addition to computer science. Therefore, IA is best thought of as a superset of information security (i.e. umbrella term), and as the business outcome of Information Risk Management.|$|E

Minister for Community Development, Youth and Sports Vivian Balakrishnan defended the policy, arguing that it reduced bureaucracy and left jobs to <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>people.</b> However, the MOE agreed to play {{a more active role}} in special education, with increased funding and teacher training. The MOE also introduced more satellite classes in mainstream schools and helped special schools set targets for learning outcomes, such as O-Level passes. In 2014 Phua also spoke out during the second reading of the Remote Gambling Bill, calling for a complete ban on remote gambling.|$|E
500|$|Alfredson has {{described}} the casting process as {{the most difficult part}} of making the film. He had particular concerns about the interaction between the two leads, and the fact that those who had read the book would have a preconceived notion of how the characters were supposed to look. He wanted the actors to look innocent, and be able to interact in front of the camera. They were supposed to be [...] "mirror images of each other. She is everything he isn't. Dark, strong, brave, and a girl. (...) Like two sides of the same coin." [...] On another occasion, Alfredson stated that [...] "asting is 70 percent of the job; it's not about picking <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>people</b> to make the roles. It is about creating chords, how a B and A minor interact together, and are played together." [...] In the end, Alfredson expressed satisfaction with the result, and has frequently lauded Hedebrant and Leandersson for being [...] "extremely intelligent", [...] "incredibly wise", and [...] "unprecedentedly fantastic." ...|$|E

500|$|When her {{brother-in-law}} was elected as Pope Leo X, she {{took advantage of}} the situation to increase her income and provide additional funds to her son. [...] By 1514, she noted that the Pope was running low on funds, but continued to act in her family's interest. [...] She spent a year lobbying for her son-in-law to get the position of Depositor-General of the Vatican, giving her family direct access to Vatican treasuries. [...] The Medicis began to have public disputes about which of the family members and clients should get the most powerful and influential positions. [...] Alfonsina was working so that her son would have sole authority in Florence, while others, led by Lucrezia, wanted a more distributed government. [...] Alfonsina even encouraged Lorenzo to interfere in elections in Florence, to get <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>people</b> elected. [...] She regularly reminded him to reward families that had been loyal to the Medicis and Orsinis for a long time.

500|$|The New York Times {{reported}} that in contrast to previous statements {{about the number of}} firings related to the scandal [...] "new internal documents show that the real number of people removed from their jobs is much smaller still: at most, three". The Department of Veterans Affairs did not dispute this number, but said that disciplinary action is being taken against over 100 other employees. Congressional Republicans were outraged. Representative Jeff Miller said. [...] "“Rather than disciplining bad employees, V.A. often just transfers them to other V.A. facilities or puts them on paid leave for months on end," [...] and [...] "“Everyone knows accountability is a major problem at the department." [...] Miller said that he would introduce new legislation to hasten the firing process. Raymond Kelley, legislative director for Veterans of Foreign Wars, said that “The government firing system is so cumbersome bad employees can continue to be paid for years,” and “We need to show them you can no longer hide just because you have a government job, unclog the middle management that appears {{to be part of the}} problem and get <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>people</b> in those positions.” ...|$|E

500|$|The 100-page {{screenplay}} detailed plot {{developments and}} many of the visual traits, but very little dialogue was scripted, so the actors were asked to improvise their lines. Noé explained this approach: [...] "For me, directing actors is just finding <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>people</b> and putting them in the right mood on the set and letting them go. ... I think the energy has to come on the set at the very last minute." [...] Locations were used in Kabukichō and other parts of Shinjuku. Since much of the film was set in neighbourhoods known for gambling and prostitution, the producers made agreements with the Yakuza crime syndicates before filming some of the on-location scenes. Criminal organisations were not involved in the actual production. Studio scenes set in Tokyo were filmed at Toho Studios. More scenes than originally planned had to be filmed in the studio because of the many complicated crane arrangements. Some of the overhead sequences took a full day to arrange and film. The scenes where Oscar is alive were mostly shot on location, but the crane shots were exclusively taken in the studio; this included revisits to some of the previous locations, which were replicated as large indoor sets. Other shots were taken from helicopters flying over the city. Much attention was paid to the continuity of the geography, and filming was overseen by a supervisor from the visual-effects team.|$|E
500|$|In October 2016, it was {{reported}} that Disney was developing a live-action adaptation of Aladdin with Guy Ritchie signed on to direct the film. John August is writing the script, which will reportedly retain the musical elements of the original film, while Dan Lin is attached as producer. Lin revealed that they are looking for a diverse cast. In April 2017, Will Smith entered talks to play the Genie. The following month, Jade Thirlwall entered talks to portray the role of Jasmine. Alan Menken said filming is slated to begin August 2017. Production had originally been scheduled to begin in July, but was delayed due to Disney having trouble finding <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>people</b> to play Aladdin and Jasmine. British actress Naomi Scott and Indian actress Tara Sutaria were being considered to play Jasmine. For the role of Aladdin, British actors Riz Ahmed and Dev Patel were initially considered, but it was later decided that a newcomer should be cast in the role. In July 2017, it was announced that Egyptian-Canadian actor Mena Massoud has been cast as Aladdin, Naomi Scott has been cast as Jasmine, and Will Smith has been cast as the Genie. At the 2017 D23 Expo, Alan Menken announced that he would be co-writing new songs for the film with Academy Award winners [...] Pasek and Paul (La La Land) while Vanessa Taylor (Game of Thrones) would re-write the script. In August 2017, Marwan Kenzari, Nasim Pedrad, and Numan Acar joined the cast as Jafar, Dalia, and Hakim, respectively. The following month, Billy Magnussen and Navid Negahban were cast as Prince Anders and the Sultan, respectively. Filming began on September 6, 2017 at Longcross Studios. The film is scheduled for release on May 24, 2019.|$|E
