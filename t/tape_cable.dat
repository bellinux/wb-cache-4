5000|$|Bolger's first {{generation}} of [...] "chine log instant boats" [...] for home building {{was followed by a}} generation of [...] "stitch and glue" [...] (aka [...] "tack and tape") boats. This technique was made possible by the evolution of glues and the massification of polyester and epoxy resins combined with fiberglass tape. The new technique basically did away with the chine logs and mechanical fasteners and all the problems associated with their use (mainly the limitation of shape in the design phase, the carpentry challenge in the construction phase and damp/rot in the medium to long term). Instead of using a chine to join the precut panels, in stitch and glue, the preshaped panels are wrapped around bulkheads and/or frames {{in the same way as}} before. However, the panels are only temporarily held in place using nails, duct <b>tape,</b> <b>cable</b> ties, masking tape, wire or other mechanical means, while the seams are filled (both inside and outside the hull) with a resin and filler paste covered in one or more layers of fiberglass cloth or tape which in turn is saturated in resin. Once the resin hardens, the mechanical joint is stronger than the joined plywood and therefore structurally sound. Payson again popularised the technique in his book Build the New Instant Boats (1984, 160 pages, 8" [...] × 11", 110 illustrations - Also still in print). In this book Payson introduces what he termed [...] "Tack and tape" [...] to the greater American public. The book includes plans for Gypsy (15' sail/oar/outboard), Nymph (7'9" [...] dinghy with sail option), Diablo (15' motor boat for up to 25 HP outboard) as well as 8 more [...] "traditional instant boats" [...] using the chine log method: 16' Lug-rigger Windsprint, 6'5" [...] Tortoise, 8' Skimmer, Dynamite Sailboard, 16'June Bug, Madeline a 19'6" [...] Pedal-driven sidewheeler and the 23'6" [...] Light Schooner.

A new experimental device has been designed and built to measure critical current of YBCO tapes and TSTC {{as a function of}} magnetic field and temperature. The probe allows controlling the temperature between 4. 2 K and 80 K within +/- 1 K in liquid and gaseous helium ambient, and {{can be used in a}} 2 T magnet facility at MIT-PSFC and a 14 T magnet facility at NHMFL-FSU. Its current leads are designed to carry up to 5 kA. The device consists in a 0. 9 m long, 25 x 38 mm rectangular vacuum-insulated canister. The superconducting sample and a superconducting current return lead fit inside the canister, in such a way that the Lorentz force and torque produced by the external magnetic field is cancelled. The sample temperature is controlled in a 200 mm long area inside the canister where critical current measurements are performed. Critical current measurements were performed on a single YBCO tape at self-field at temperatures between 20 K and 70 K. The results are similar to data provided by the superconductor's manufacturer. The temperature reached the set point in approximately 10 minutes, and was controlled within +/- 1 K. Results of heating power required and difference between set point temperature and measured temperature as functions of set point temperature are presented for two temperature control methods. by Franco Julio Mangiarotti.

50|$|Coaxial cable conducts {{electrical}} signal using an inner conductor (usually a solid copper, stranded copper or copper plated steel wire) {{surrounded by an}} insulating layer and all enclosed by a shield, typically one to four layers of woven metallic braid and metallic <b>tape.</b> The <b>cable</b> is protected by an outer insulating jacket. Normally, the shield is kept at ground potential and a signal carrying voltage {{is applied to the}} center conductor. The advantage of coaxial design is that electric and magnetic fields are restricted to the dielectric with little leakage outside the shield. Conversely, electric and magnetic fields outside the cable are largely kept from interfering with signals inside the cable. Larger diameter cables and cables with multiple shields have less leakage. This property makes coaxial cable a good choice for carrying weak signals that cannot tolerate interference from the environment or for stronger {{electrical signal}}s that must not be allowed to radiate or couple into adjacent structures or circuits.|$|R

50|$|Permanent and expeditionary {{land based}} systems usually consist of two arresting engines located {{on either side}} of the runway.

The two most common methods used by land based arresting engines to apply the braking force are the rotary friction brake and the rotary hydraulic (water twister) systems. The rotary friction brake is simply a hydraulic pump coupled to the reel which applies a graduated pressure to multi-disc brakes mounted on the reel. The rotary hydraulic system is a turbine inside a water/glycol filled housing coupled to the reel. The turbulence generated in the water/glycol mixture by the turbine during the arrestment provides the resistance to slow the reel and stop the aircraft.

40|$|The recent {{development}} of REBCO superconducting <b>tapes,</b> <b>cabling</b> methods and joint concepts {{could be a}} revolutionary development for magnetic fusion. REBCO has significantly better performance at high magnetic fields than traditional low temperature superconductors (LTS), and can be operated at a higher temperature than LTS for reduced thermodynamic cost of cooling. Use of REBCO superconductors in the magnet systems of tokamaks allows building demountable toroidal field (TF) coils, greatly simplifying reactor construction and maintenance. A demountable TF coil system with REBCO superconductors for a fusion reactor has been conceptually designed. The coil system operates at 20 K, with a maximum magnetic field of 20 T. The magnets are divided into two coil segments and can be detached and remounted to allow the internal components of the reactor to be removed vertically as one piece. Operating at 20 T and 20 K, the stress {{in most of the}} coils is acceptable (less than 2 / 3 the yield strength and less than 1 / 2 the ultimate tensile strength of the structural materials). The strain in the superconductors is lower than the reversible degradation limit. The electrical resistance in each conductor joint is 10 n [Omega]. The total heat generation in the reactor superconducting TF magnets is approximately 1. 9 MW, of which about 25 % is nuclear heating and 75 % joint heating. 71 MW of electricity are required for cooling the coils at 20 K, about 7 % of the electric energy the reactor generates. The expected time to warm-up the magnets from the operation temperature to room temperature is 7 days, and approximately the same for cool-down back to the operation temperature. The analysis of the conceptual magnet design is encouraging, as no insuperable problems have been identified. This conceptual design {{can be used as a}} starting point for a full engineering design of demountable fusion reactors magnets. by Franco Julio Mangiarotti. Thesis: Ph.
