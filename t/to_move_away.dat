5|$|A small {{fraction}} of the contaminated spray was thrown back into the air as the base surge. Unlike the Wilson cloud, a meteorological phenomenon in clean air, the base surge was a heavy fog bank of radioactive mist that rolled across all the target ships, coating their surfaces with fission products. When the mist in the base surge evaporated, the base surge became invisible but continued <b>to</b> <b>move</b> <b>away,</b> contaminating ships several miles from the detonation point.|$|E
5|$|Deptford {{experienced}} {{economic decline}} in the 20th century with {{the closing of the}} docks, and the damage caused by the bombing during the Second World War - a V-2 rocket destroyed a Woolworths store (now New Cross Gate), killing 160 people. High unemployment caused some of the population <b>to</b> <b>move</b> <b>away</b> as the riverside industries closed down in the late 1960s and early 1970s. The local council have developed plans with private companies to regenerate the riverside area, and the town centre.|$|E

5|$|Smuts's {{religious}} observance was unsurprising in one who whose moral outlook was based exclusively upon Biblical teachings {{and who was}} destined for a future in the Church. Yet, though religion continued to serve in this central role, his studies at Stellenbosch, with their decidedly scientific bias, led Smuts towards a more critical examination of his faith. From this time onwards Smuts was, by gradual degrees, to start <b>to</b> <b>move</b> <b>away</b> from the uncompromisingly Calvinist outlook within {{which he had been}} raised.|$|E
5000|$|The strongest {{criticisms of}} Fini from the Right are related <b>to</b> <b>moves</b> <b>away</b> from the {{traditional}} policies of the party. Apart from the [...] "Social Right" [...] area of his traditional rival Pino Rauti, the right-wing intellectual Marcello Veneziani accused Fini of having lost any connection to right-wing thought (whether traditional, nostalgic, modern or conservative) and of representing an [...] "astral" [...] right, with no similarity to any other European right-wing group.|$|R

5|$|Starting in the 1960s and {{following}} the construction of highways that made commuting easier, residents began <b>to</b> <b>move</b> <b>away</b> from downtown in favor of new housing subdivisions to the north. After strip commercial interests began to move downtown, the city worked to designate several areas as historic districts in the 1970s and 80s to preserve the architectural character of the city. The Meridian Historic Districts and Landmarks Commission was created in 1979, and the Meridian Main Street program was founded in 1985.|$|E
5|$|After {{the success}} of the first two Broken Sword games on the PlayStation, Sony {{contacted}} Revolution Software to develop a game to be released initially on the console. Revolution wanted <b>to</b> <b>move</b> <b>away</b> from the style of its previous projects, making a game with a secret agent theme and set in an action environment. Director Charles Cecil stated that the game was inspired by crime films such as Pulp Fiction and The Usual Suspects. The game engine was written specifically for the title. It was released to average reviews from critics, who praised the game's story, puzzles and graphics, but criticized its controls, action scenes and animation.|$|E
5|$|In April 2007, Portsmouth F.C. {{announced}} plans <b>to</b> <b>move</b> <b>away</b> from Fratton Park {{to a new}} stadium situated {{on a piece of}} reclaimed land beside the Historic Dockyard, nicknamed Portsmouth Dockland Stadium. The £600 million mixed-use development, designed by architects Herzog & de Meuron, would also include 1500 harbourside apartments as well as shops and offices. The scheme attracted criticism due to its large size and location, with some officials saying that it would interfere with harbour operations. The £600 million project for a new stadium was rejected by the city council due to the financial crisis of 2008.|$|E

5|$|The lack {{of record}} company support {{frustrated}} {{the band and}} led the band to self-produce their next album, The Beacon Street Collection, in a home-made studio, causing them <b>to</b> <b>move</b> <b>away</b> from the slick pop sound desired by Interscope and towards a more punk style. Their independence shocked their record company representative Tony Ferguson and the album sold over 100,000 copies in 1995, the year of its release, over {{three times as many}} as No Doubt sold. To capitalize on this success, Interscope offered the band extensive help with their third album, Tragic Kingdom, under the division Trauma Records to which the band was signed.|$|E
5|$|When the {{organization}} {{became aware that}} a certain person wanted to hold a reunion with Ojeda Ríos, they would discuss and analize it before approving the meeting, with the Commander issuing {{a report of the}} topics discussed afterwards. According to the briefing that followed his reunion with bishop González Nieves, it was established that the religious leader tried to convince him <b>to</b> <b>move</b> <b>away</b> from armed conflict and to abandon clandestine activities. However, Ojeda Ríos responded by replying that, despite respecting the motives behind these suggestions, he declined. He extended an offer of his own to the bishop to join the efforts of the EPB, which was turned down as well.|$|E

5|$|Zieten had by {{this time}} brought up his 1st Brigade, but had become {{concerned}} {{at the sight of}} stragglers and casualties from the Nassau units on Wellington's left and from the Prussian 15th Brigade. These troops appeared to be withdrawing and Zieten, fearing that his own troops would be caught up in a general retreat, was starting <b>to</b> <b>move</b> <b>away</b> from Wellington's flank and towards the Prussian main body near Plancenoit. Zieten had also received a direct order from Blücher to support Bülow, which Zieten obeyed and marched to Bülow's aid.|$|E
5|$|After Dieppe the {{headquarters}} staff changed again. Lovat {{was promoted to}} brigadier and given command of the 1st Special Service Brigade. Mills-Roberts was promoted and sent to North Africa to take over command of No. 6 Commando. They were replaced by Robert Dawson as the CO and Ronald Menday as 2IC. Other changes included moving to a new base in Falmouth {{and the formation of}} a heavy weapons troop in each commando. The new troop with mortar and Vickers machine gun sections provided the heavy weapons needed for their new role as assault infantry. By now the Commandos had started <b>to</b> <b>move</b> <b>away</b> from smaller raiding operations. They were formed into units intended to spearhead future Allied landing operations. To assist in this they were given the organic fire support weapons, that had been absent when they were a raiding force.|$|E
