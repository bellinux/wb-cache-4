25|$|The {{citizens}} of the cotton States, as a whole, are poor. They work little, and that little, badly; they earn little, they sell little; they buy little, and they have little – very little – of the common comforts and consolations of civilized life. Their destitution is not material only; it is intellectual and it is moral... They were neither generous nor hospitable and <b>their</b> <b>talk</b> was not that of evenly courageous men.|$|E

Voicetracking purposes are handled either by internal methods or through their Premium Choice format menus, the latter of which is geared towards small and medium-market stations with air talent selected from stations in larger markets.|$|E

25|$|Both Gheorghiu-Dej and Drăghici opposed de-Stalinization, but <b>their</b> <b>talk</b> of {{national}} communism and socialist patriotism signaled Romania's emancipation from the Soviet Union. Drăghici still had important assignments after Gheorghiu-Dej's death, but was bitterly opposed to emerging communist leader Nicolae Ceaușescu. Ceaușescu used his {{influence in the}} party to incriminate Drăghici of all publicly known Securitate crimes, then deposed him. Drăghici was not brought to justice, but lived in anonymity in the Bucharest area from 1968 to 1989. He lived his final years in Hungary, with his family, despite Romanian efforts to have him extradited. Shortly before his death, a trial held in absentia convicted him of incitement to murder.|$|E
25|$|During {{this time}} Bunyan, whilst on his travels as a tinker, {{happened}} to be in Bedford and pass a group of women who were talking about spiritual matters on their doorstep. The women were in fact some of the founding members of the Bedford Free Church or Meeting and Bunyan, who had been attending the parish church of Elstow, was so impressed by <b>their</b> <b>talk</b> that he joined their church. At that time the nonconformist group was meeting in St John's church in Bedford under the leadership of former Royalist army officer John Gifford. At the instigation of other members of the congregation Bunyan began to preach, both in the church and to groups of people in the surrounding countryside. In 1656, having by this time moved his family to St Cuthbert's Street in Bedford, he published his first book, Gospel Truths Opened, which was inspired by a dispute with Quakers.|$|E
25|$|On 26 May 2012, Adam, C-P and Jeffball of DC949 gave a {{presentation}} at the LayerOne hacker conference detailing how {{they were able to}} achieve an automated solution with an accuracy rate of 99.1%. Their tactic was to use techniques from machine learning, a subfield of artificial intelligence, to analyse the audio version of reCAPTCHA which is available for the visually impaired. Google released a new version of reCAPTCHA just hours before <b>their</b> <b>talk,</b> making major changes to both the audio and visual versions of their service. In this release, the audio version was increased in length from 8 seconds to 30 seconds, and is much more difficult to understand, both for humans as well as bots. In response to this update and the following one, the members of DC949 released two more versions of Stiltwalker which beat reCAPTCHA with an accuracy of 60.95% and 59.4% respectively. After each successive break, Google updated reCAPTCHA within a few days. According to DC949, they often reverted to features that had been previously hacked.|$|E

With Bukovsky, [...] "The Patriarch" [...] as he was called in the published version of her article, she discussed the position {{of those who had}} gained political asylum in Britain (Ahmed Zakayev, Alexander Litvinenko), and the attitudes of the UK government of Tony Blair and of the European Parliament to the situation in Chechnya.

500|$|... {{a mysterious}} girl {{dressed like a}} nun, and , a mysterious gentleman who is somehow {{attached}} to the church where Yuko first appears, are having a reunion in a church during Christmas time. Despite her attire, Yuko is not affiliated with the church. She always appears generally out of nowhere, and disappears just as quickly in various places throughout the story to talk with Hiro or other characters and give them advice. Yuko and Yu reminisce about the past and remember events {{of the previous year}} around the same time {{at the beginning of the}} first chapter of the story. Yuko hints of events that are revealed throughout Ef: A Fairy Tale of the Two. After the conclusion of the first chapter, the story cycles back to the prologue and the talk between Yuko and Yu. Yuko ends with her talk about the events in the first chapter. At the end of the second chapter, the story shifts again to the scene with Yuko and Yu. Yuko finishes her talk on the events from the second chapter and says that she misses talking to Hiro, Kyosuke, and their friends. <b>Their</b> <b>talk</b> ends with allusions to the continuation of the story, Ef: The Latter Tale.|$|E
500|$|Handlen {{felt that}} the {{character}} development of Carl Grimes was more stable than similar developments in the episode; [...] "Using Carl to both resolve the episode’s plot, and making him semi-responsible for Dale’s death, has a satisfying neatness, {{and serves as a}} reminder that for all <b>their</b> <b>talk,</b> Rick and the group have no idea what impact their choices will make." [...] Likewise, Jackson and Ryan Rigley of MTV noticed the darker transition of the character; [...] "Carl's moral compass has greatly shifted since being shot and seeing the walking corpse of his friend, Sophia," [...] asserted Rigley. Jackson concluded {{that it was one of}} the episode highlights, writing, [...] "He awakened from his coma talking about the beautiful doe, but ever since the dead body of Sophia limped its way out of that barn door, he's become colder and harder. When Carol sees him at Sophia’s gravesite, she tries to comfort him with talk of heaven, and he calls her an idiot. He's looking to emulate the men leading the group—the different kinds of toughness displayed by his father, Shane and Daryl. And he finds the chance to test his own bravery, playing near a zombie stuck in the mud by the creek, keeping the discovery to himself." [...] Jackson commented on Carl's reaction to the death of Dale, saying that despite a gradual change to a dark nature, he [...] "realizes [...] that he's still very much a kid".|$|E

2500|$|<b>Their</b> <b>talk</b> {{turned to}} religion, and Darwin said [...] "I {{never gave up}} Christianity until I was forty years of age." [...] He agreed that Christianity was [...] "not {{supported}} by the evidence", but he had reached this conclusion only slowly. Aveling recorded this discussion, and published it in 1883 as a penny pamphlet. Francis Darwin thought it gave [...] "quite fairly his impressions of my father's views, but took issue with any suggestion of similar religious views, saying [...] "My father's replies implied his preference for the unaggressive attitude of an Agnostic. Dr. Aveling seems to regard the absence of aggressiveness in my father's views as distinguishing them in an unessential manner from his own. But, in my judgment, it is precisely differences of this kind which distinguish him so completely from the class of thinkers to which Dr. Aveling belongs." ...|$|E

When his father reveals what happened to Marble, he regains the ability to understand his feelings and knows that he loves Mori.|$|E
2500|$|As David Mitchell says at {{the start}} of the programme, [...] "the rules are very simple". The panel is made up of four players. In the game each of the panellists is given a subject on which they give a short lecture. Most of the lecture is {{composed}} of lies, but during the course of the speech the lecturer must try to smuggle five true statements past the rest of the panel. The challenging panellists must buzz in when they believe that what the lecturer is saying is true. They must state what they believe the fact was. If it was true, the challenger is awarded one point. If it was a lie, then they are deducted one point. One point is given to the lecturer for each truth they smuggle successfully without it being detected at the end of the lecture. The winner is the panellist with the most points. A perfect score is 20 points (by hiding all five of their truths, and spotting the five truths in all three of the other players' routines without making any wrong challenges), plus additional points for [...] "unintentional" [...] truths revealed during the monologue. However, nobody has reached this score yet, and in fact many contests have been amusingly low scoring, with most panellists having a negative number of points due to high number of guesses. On occasion, panellists have included more than five truths during in <b>their</b> <b>talk,</b> often unintentionally, although Jo Brand included an extra fact about Henry VIII as she thought it was so fantastic.|$|E
