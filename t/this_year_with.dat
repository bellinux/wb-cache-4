And then Mack (Brown) and I will sit down and discuss the possibility of an emergency situation as we've done in the past; one year Tony Jeffrey worked as quarterback for us because he had played quarterback in high school. So we'll sit down and look at some different options as to which way we would go. It would certainly be somebody that we think can run the offense and have a limited package for those guys. I don't think we'll need an emergency quarterback, but we'll certainly have a third guy ready.|$|E
25|$|The Irish's {{first game}} of the season came on the road against the No.23 ranked Pittsburgh Panthers. The Panthers were led by their first-year head coach Dave Wannstedt and junior quarterback and two-year starter, Tyler Palko. At Notre Dame, the {{previous}} season, Palko became the first quarterback to throw five touchdown passes against the Irish in the Panthers 41-38 win. Palko started the scoring <b>this</b> <b>year</b> <b>with</b> a 39-yard touchdown pass to Greg Lee, however Brady Quinn and the Irish answered with a 51-yard touchdown pass to Darius Walker. The Panthers completed the first quarter scoring with a 49-yard field goal by Josh Cummings to take a 10-7 lead into the second quarter. In the second quarter, the Irish took control. The quarter began with a 2-yard touchdown run by Walker. Later, Rashon Powers-Neal scored on his own 2-yard run, and, after a fumble on the kickoff return, less than a minute later Quinn threw a 19-yard touchdown pass to Jeff Samardzija, the first touchdown catch of his career, to give the Irish a 28-10 lead. Cummings hit a 23-yard field goal to cut the Irish lead to 15, but late in the half Powers-Neal ran for a 9-yard touchdown, giving the Irish a 35-13 lead at halftime.|$|E
25|$|In {{yet another}} {{improbable}} comeback on September 6, the Cardinals won a critical {{game against the}} Pittsburgh Pirates, 9-6, with two outs and two strikes against Matt Carpenter in the ninth, trailing 5-6.

Jhonny Peralta made it back-to-back with his seventh home run of the year, ending the five-home run night for the Redbirds and a 9-6 win after Seung Hwan Oh got his 16th save. Molina {{in the first inning}} hit a grand slam, seventh <b>this</b> <b>year,</b> <b>with</b> Matt Adams adding his 14th homer in the third inning for a 5-0 lead. The Pirates stormed back to take the lead after scoring one in the third, one in the fourth, and four in the fifth inning. Mike Mayers got his first major league win in relief with a scoreless eighth inning, keeping the team just one run behind. His debut on July 24 {{was one of the worst}} in MLB history, but this night he was perfect. Carpenter's home run was the first pinch-hit blast of his career, but the 15th by the team this season setting a new MLB record. The previous Major League high had been 14, set by the 2001 Arizona Diamondbacks and 2001 San Francisco Giants. Eight different Cardinals have contributed a pinch-hit homer this season.|$|E

40|$|Iowa has {{experienced}} two consecutive <b>years</b> <b>with</b> conditions very favorable for stalk rot development. Some producers have been realizing this {{over the last}} few weeks as they struggle to harvest fields that lodged due to stalk rot.

According to Iowa Agricultural Statistics reports, about 19 percent of the acreage has moderate to severe lodging <b>this</b> <b>year</b> compared <b>with</b> last <b>year</b> when about 39 percent of the acres was reported to have moderate to severe lodging.

I remember how I used to feel watching TV and seeing Sara Rue on Popular because she was an inspiration to me. It's funny because what I love about Lauren is that she's unapologetic and she's confident and she's making Puck work for it and she's not just looking for a roll in the hay. I think that they are very sweet together, there is this vulnerability when they are both such bad asses and you put them together and I think there is something really special there. What I appreciate about Lauren is that she's like I don't need to give it to you, you're going to work for it, and I think that's a great message to send to young girls. I think that he is smitten and she is probably a little smitten too but I think she has enough self esteem not to give everything up for the charming cute boy that's kind of after her." [...] Kevin Fallon, a writer for The Atlantic, reacted favorably to the casting of Fink: [...] "Glee hit the trifecta <b>this</b> <b>year</b> <b>with</b> its three major cast additions. First there were Darren Criss—who's exploded with popularity—and Chord Overstreet. Now there's Ashley Fink's Lauren.
