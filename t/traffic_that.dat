5|$|M-64 is {{maintained}} by the Michigan Department of Transportation (MDOT) like all other state trunkline highways. As a part of these responsibilities, the department tracks the volume of <b>traffic</b> <b>that</b> uses the highway. These traffic counts are expressed using a metric called annual average daily traffic (AADT). This number {{is an expression of}} the <b>traffic</b> <b>that</b> uses a segment of roadway for any average day of the year. In 2009, MDOT's surveys showed that the highest AADT along M-64 was 3,333vehicles daily on the Ontonagon River Bridge; the lowest traffic was between US2 and the Gogebic–Ontonagon county line at 418vehicles per day. The only segments of the trunkline that have been included on the National Highway System (NHS) are the US2 and M-28 concurrencies. The NHS is a network of roads important to the country's defense, economy and mobility.|$|E

MDOT's surveys in 2010 showed that between 1,392and 1,986vehicles used the highway per day.|$|E

5|$|Bristol Bridge, {{the only}} way of {{crossing}} the river without using a ferry, was rebuilt between 1764 and 1768. The earlier medieval bridge was too narrow and congested to cope with the amount of <b>traffic</b> <b>that</b> needed to use it. A toll was charged to pay for the works, and when, in 1793, the toll was extended for a further period of time the Bristol Bridge Riot ensued. Eleven people were killed and 45 injured, {{making it one of the}} worst riots of the 18th century.|$|E
5|$|Debates ensued {{over the}} fate of the Marysvale branch line. The mines {{at the end of the}} line had long closed; the last train to {{traverse}} the entire length of the line passed through in 1970. Still, farmers and industry in the Sevier and Sanpete Valleys generated enough <b>traffic</b> <b>that</b> the line broke even most years. However, this line was severely damaged, with several washed-out bridges and railroad tracks draping over the sides of newly created cliffs. The railroad determined that at best it would take years to recover the cost of rebuilding the line.|$|E
5|$|However, this winding route {{proved to}} be too {{dangerous}} and difficult for the explosion of vehicle <b>traffic</b> <b>that</b> occurred after World War II. Alvinston was originally reliant on the Canada Southern Railroad, which {{was taken over by}} the Michigan Central Railway and that by New York Central. However, by 1960 the use of the rails had declined so much that service was stopped. The tracks were lifted two years later.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: In {{this paper}} {{the issue of}} human trafficking, in {{particular}} the trafficking of women and girls, across national and international borders will be discussed with a literature review to identify {{the extent of the}} problem. There are many facets associated with human <b>trafficking</b> <b>that</b> will be acknowledged but not addressed. The problem of human trafficking will identify geographical areas and specific countries that are both source, transit and destination countries for human <b>trafficking,</b> <b>that</b> include <b>trafficking</b> for prostitution purposes. In addition, the literature review will identify that race, ethnicity, socioeconomic, cultural and religious factors support human trafficking.

5|$|In 2007, the Times Union of Albany {{received}} {{letters from}} readers requesting {{that all of}} NY149 be widened from two to four lanes. The letters were forwarded to NYSDOT, who responded that although the route was an important recreational route between New York and Vermont, the amount of <b>traffic</b> <b>that</b> the route carries was not high enough to warrant a four-lane divided highway. Additionally, the state {{would also have to}} take a significant number of properties along the roadway in order to widen it, which would affect the character of the area.|$|E

5|$|The next {{interchange}} for the M-5 freeway {{connects to}} Grand River Avenue and 10 Mile Road. This {{section of the}} freeway bypasses residential areas of Farmington Hills. Further east, M-5 crosses into Farmington where it bypasses the downtown area of the suburb. Past 9Mile Road, the freeway ends at the intersection with Grand River Avenue, and M-5 follows Grand River southeasterly as a boulevard, a type of divided street. <b>Traffic</b> <b>that</b> wishes to make left turns must use a Michigan left maneuver along {{this section of the}} highway. Additionally, <b>traffic</b> <b>that</b> needs to change sides of the street must use crossovers in the median to perform a U-turn. Once again running through suburban Farmington Hills, the trunkline passes Botsford Hospital before intersecting 8Mile Road. This intersection marks the place where M-5 crosses into Wayne County, and the western terminus of the M-102 designation on 8Mile Road. Grand River Avenue runs through the northern section of Redford Township in Wayne County and crosses into Detroit at the intersection with 7Mile Road and 5Points Street.|$|E
5|$|At {{the time}} the {{business}} loop was still under state control, it was maintained by the Michigan Department of Transportation (MDOT) as {{a segment of the}} State Trunkline Highway System. As a part of these maintenance responsibilities, the department tracked the volume of <b>traffic</b> <b>that</b> used Bus. US41. These volumes were expressed using a metric called annual average daily traffic, which is a statistical calculation of the average daily number of vehicles on a segment of roadway. In the department's last survey, conducted in 2004, there were 10,272vehicles per day using Washington Street between Lincoln Avenue and Front Street, the lowest traffic count for the trunkline. The highest volume was 19,036vehicles between McClellan and Lincoln Avenues, while the Front Street section received 16,309vehicles on an average day. The former business loop has not been listed on the National Highway System, a network of roads important to the country's economy, defense, and mobility.|$|E

5|$|Before the Dumbarton and San Mateo-Hayward Bridges {{were built}} across the San Francisco Bay in the 1920s, San Francisco was bottled {{up at the}} north end of a long peninsula, with driving south on El Camino Real towards San Jose as the only {{reasonable}} alternative to the ferries for crossing the bay. The first of several highways built as an alternate to El Camino Real was the Skyline Boulevard, which was added to the state highway system in 1919. A second route, the Bay Shore Highway (Route 68), became a state highway in 1923, but only from the San Francisco city limits into San Mateo County, where the Dumbarton Bridge would begin. Just prior to the start of construction on the Dumbarton Bridge, San Francisco Supervisor Richard J. Welch noted that the Bay Shore Highway would need to be built all the way to San Jose as an escape valve for the additional <b>traffic</b> <b>that</b> the bridge would attract.|$|E
5|$|Conn. M-13 is {{maintained}} by MDOT like other state highways in Michigan.

These volumes are expressed using a metric called annual average daily traffic, which is a statistical calculation of the average daily number of vehicles on a segment of roadway. MDOT's surveys in 2010 showed that the traffic levels along Conn. M-13 were 13,939vehicles daily south of the Wilder Road and 7,031vehicles per day north of that interchange. The only section of the freeway that has been listed on the National Highway System (NHS) is from the southern terminus to the Wilder Road interchange.
