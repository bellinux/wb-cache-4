5|$|Like the Septuagint, the Greek {{translation}} of the Hebrew Bible that predated the Imperial era, Jewish literature in Greek under the Empire was written mainly for Jews who spoke Greek.

The Sibylline Oracles and the Wisdom of Solomon are other examples of Jewish literature in Greek from this general period.|$|E

5|$|According to some later accounts, {{before the}} {{eruption}} of the Peloponnesian War (431 BC404 BC), Pericles, some of his closest associates (including <b>the</b> <b>philosopher</b> Anaxagoras and sculptor Phidias) and Aspasia faced a series of personal and legal attacks.

The historical nature of the accounts about these events is disputed, and apparently no harm came to her as a result.|$|E
