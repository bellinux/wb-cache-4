5|$|At the time, the EC {{viewed the}} {{agreement}} {{as a method}} of defusing the crisis and failed to attribute the lull which coincided with the Brioni Agreement to a shift in Serbian strategy instead. The EC delegation's failure to respond to Jović's departure before the plenary meeting and the EC foreign ministers' declaration of 10 July indicating the EC would withdraw from mediation if the Brioni Agreement was not implemented only encouraged Serbia which, unlike Slovenia, Croatia, or the Yugoslav federation, had nothing to lose if the EC pulled out. In the end, the EC took credit for a rapid resolution of the armed conflict in Slovenia without realising that its diplomatic efforts {{had little to do with}} <b>the</b> <b>situation</b> <b>on</b> the ground.|$|E
5|$|Drusus {{had little}} time to mourn or {{celebrate}} {{the death of his}} grandfather or the ascendance of Tiberius: the legions in the Rhine and Illyricum were in mutiny. They had not received the bonuses promised to them by Augustus, and when it became clear a response from Tiberius was not forthcoming, they revolted. On 17 or 18 September, Drusus was sent to deal with the troops in Illyricum, and a delegation was sent to confer proconsular imperium maius upon Germanicus, who dealt with <b>the</b> <b>situation</b> <b>on</b> the Rhine. Drusus did not require proconsular powers because he was consul designate.|$|E
5|$|Elizabeth {{believed}} that her daughter's mere presence would help calm the opposition. Accompanied by Garai and a modest following, she and Mary {{set out for}} Đakovo. However, Elizabeth had seriously misjudged <b>the</b> <b>situation.</b> <b>On</b> 25 July 1386, they were ambushed en route and attacked by John Horvat in Gorjani. Their small entourage failed to fight off the attackers. Garai was killed by the rebels and his head was sent to Charles's widow Margaret, while the queens were imprisoned in the bishop of Zagreb's castle of Gomnec. Elizabeth took all blame for the rebellion and begged the attackers to spare her daughter's life.|$|E

5|$|General Krueger was gravely {{concerned}} about the seriousness of <b>the</b> <b>situation</b> <b>on</b> Los Negros. In response to urgent request from General Chase, Krueger arranged with Admiral Barbey for {{the movement of the}} rest of the 1st Cavalry Division to be expedited. At Krueger's request, the 2ndSquadron, 7th Cavalry would travel in the three APDs. Other units would arrive on 6 and 9March instead of 9 and 16March. Krueger realised that Hyane harbour was too small to support the entire division, but there were good beaches around Salami Plantation on the western shore of Los Negros. In order to use them, and to permit a shore-to-shore operation against Manus from Los Negros, Seeadler Harbour would have to be opened up.|$|E
5|$|In 1993, Croatia {{launched}} several small-scale {{military operations}} against the RSK to seize significant local objectives and capture international attention; it was worried <b>the</b> <b>situation</b> <b>on</b> the ground might become permanent. In response, the RSK military retrieved their weapons from the UN/RSK-controlled storage sites, reversing {{the only major}} success of UNPROFOR. In March 1995, the UNPROFOR mission was terminated following the efforts of U.S. Ambassador Richard Holbrooke; the United Nations Confidence Restoration Operation was deployed to Croatia with a new mandate. Later that year, most of the territory controlled by the RSK was captured by the HV during Operations Flash and Storm, which was foreseen by Babić when he opposed the Vance plan in 1991. The rest of the RSK-held areas were regained by Croatia following the Erdut Agreement negotiated between Croatian and Serbian authorities on 12 November 1995 during peace talks that also produced the Dayton Agreement.|$|E
5|$|In late July 1918, Bulgarian {{commander-in-chief}} Nikola Zhekov sent German Field Marshal Paul von Hindenburg {{a message}} regarding a rumored Entente offensive, and detailed Bulgaria's inability to adequately defend the Vardar {{portion of the}} front. Zhekov requested that Germany immediately reinforce the Balkan Front, hinting that Austria-Hungary would also be required to strengthen its positions in Albania. On 17 August, Hindenburg pledged to provide Bulgaria with support once <b>the</b> <b>situation</b> <b>on</b> other front permits it. Hindenburg's reluctance to support Bulgaria was also manifested by the early September redeployment of the last German Jäger battalion stationed in Macedonia back into Germany.|$|E

5|$|In the {{afternoon}} of 7 April, Trifunović again pressed Petrović to order a withdrawal from the border. Petrović accepted that this might become necessary if <b>the</b> <b>situation</b> <b>on</b> the immediate right flank of the 7th Army deteriorated further, but the idea was opposed by the Slovene {{chief of staff of}} the headquarters of the 1st Army Group, Armijski đeneral Leon Rupnik, who suggested that Trifunović, a Serb, should personally lead night attacks to push the Germans back. At 19:30, the Yugoslav Supreme Command advised Petrović that he had approval to withdraw endangered units on the right wing of the 7th Army. Morale in the 7th Army had started to decline due to fifth column elements encouraging soldiers to stop resisting the enemy.|$|E
5|$|In {{the second}} half of 1944, <b>the</b> <b>situation</b> <b>on</b> all fronts rapidly worsened for the Axis forces. Soviet, Bulgarian and Partisan armies had liberated the whole eastern part of Yugoslavia and Partisan forces in Bosnia pressed their attacks on even larger Axis garrisons. In a {{surprise}} attack on 20 September, they captured the city of Banja Luka and the ZNDH's airbase at Zaluzani airfield, including 11 unserviceable aircraft. In the total confusion during the attack on the airfield, a number of ZNDH crews managed to take off and escape at the last moment, some even starting their take off runs when barely clear of open hangar doors, using suppressing fire provided by their machine-gun turrets, whilst others took off under heavy Partisan fire. The city and airbase were re-taken several days later in a heavy counter-attack by NDH and German troops.|$|E

5|$|On Nørregade, another {{fire started}} at a brewery Wednesday evening – {{possibly}} between 10 p.m. and 11 p.m. Just {{prior to that}} the original fire had reached Gammeltorv, where people fought to keep the fire back. For that reason, help was sent late {{to deal with the}} new fire. Around midnight the wind shifted to the west, and <b>the</b> <b>situation</b> <b>on</b> Nørregade turned critical as the fire was driven towards the street along a wide front. At first people sought to keep the fire on the western side of Nørregade, but nevertheless it spread to the eastern side during the night. Simultaneously, the fire moved from present day Nørre Voldgade towards Nørreport (North Gate).|$|E
5|$|The Mura {{sector was}} quiet on 9 April. The 42nd Infantry Division Murska took the 39th Infantry Regiment under command, but the 105th Infantry Regiment and 341st Reserve Regiment began to {{disintegrate}} due to desertions. Due to <b>the</b> <b>situation</b> <b>on</b> the right {{flank of the}} 42nd Infantry Division Murska, 4th Army headquarters ordered it and Detachment Ormozki {{to withdraw from the}} Drava to behind the Bednja to conform to the line being held by the 27th Infantry Division Savska on its immediate right flank.|$|E
5|$|The TSQ-81 antenna only {{received}} {{minor damage}} during the attack, and the U.S. suffered no casualties.

At around 20:20, Sullivan gave the U.S. commander at Lima Site 85 the authority to direct air strikes against targets on the lower slopes of the mountain, {{on the basis that}} the situation had become critical. About 20 minutes later, the 33-man North Vietnamese platoon began climbing up towards the U.S. facility at Lima Site 85. At 21:15 Sullivan considering evacuating all U.S. personnel from the facility at first light. However, officers of the Seventh Air Force contacted the U.S. Embassy in Laos and indicated that evacuation should only occur as the last resort, when <b>the</b> <b>situation</b> <b>on</b> top of Phou Pha Thu was no longer under their control.|$|E

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>situation</b> <b>on</b> the Muslim {{left wing}} which Yazid {{commanded}} was considerably more serious. Whilst the Muslim right wing enjoyed {{assistance from the}} mobile guard, the left wing did not and the numerical advantage the Byzantines enjoyed caused the Muslim positions to be overrun, with soldiers retreating towards base camps. Here the Byzantines had broken through the corps. The testudo formation that Gregory's army had adopted moved slowly but also had a good defense. Yazid used his cavalry regiment to counterattack but was repulsed. Despite stiff resistance, the warriors of Yazid on the left flank finally fell back to their camps {{and for a moment}} Vahan's plan appeared to be succeeding. The centre of the Muslim army was pinned down and its flanks had been pushed back. However, neither flank had broken, though their morale was severely damaged.|$|E

5|$|<b>The</b> <b>situation</b> <b>on</b> {{the front}} was chaotic {{during the day}} September 1. The North Koreans at one place had crossed at the Kihang ferry, {{captured}} Agok, and scattered A Company, 9th Infantry at its positions from Agok northward. A Company withdrew to positions on the ridge line back of the river. From there at daylight the men could see North Korean soldiers {{on many of the}} ridges surrounding them, most of them moving east. After several hours, 2nd Platoon of A Company sent a patrol down the hill to Agok to obtain supplies abandoned there during the night, returning later with much needed water, rations, and ammunition.|$|E
5|$|US Marines {{conducted}} an amphibious landing at Cape Torokina, {{on the western}} coast of Bougainville, north of Empress Augusta Bay, in November 1943. After an initial counter-attack that was repulsed, the Marines {{had been replaced by}} a garrison of US Army troops who began consolidating their position around Torokina, establishing a strong perimeter. In March 1944, the Japanese launched a heavy counter-attack, which was turned back with many casualties. After this, <b>the</b> <b>situation</b> <b>on</b> Bougainville became largely static, as the Japanese focused primarily on subsistence, and the US forces chose to adopt a mostly defensive posture aimed at maintaining the perimeter around Torokina.|$|E
