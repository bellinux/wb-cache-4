The first pit {{stops at the}} front began by lap 18, when Maldonado made a pit stop from seventh. While Massa passed Daniil Kvyat for seventh place on lap 21, Sebastian Vettel was stuck in 16th behind the McLaren of Fernando Alonso, who was told to save fuel, a problem that also afflicted his {{teammate}} Jenson Button. By lap 23 however, Vettel had gone past Alonso and the two Toro Rosso cars of Verstappen and Sainz <b>to</b> <b>move</b> <b>up</b> into 13th.|$|E

5|$|A {{collaboration}} between the Welland Rivers Trust, the Wild Trout Trust and the Environment Agency {{has resulted in the}} construction of a rock ramp, to allow migrating sea trout to pass up the river beyond the weir on the Maxey Cut, which was acting as a barrier. Some 300 tons of rock, with 50 tons of finer material forming a top layer, were used to create the ramp. The finer material ensures that water mainly flows over the ramp, rather than through it. The ramp also enables young eels or elvers <b>to</b> <b>move</b> <b>up</b> the river, and provides habitat for stone loach and bullheads.|$|E
5|$|As a {{consequence}} of the race, Webber's third-place finish allowed him to increase his lead in the World Drivers' Championship. Alonso's victory allowed him <b>to</b> <b>move</b> <b>up</b> into second place, eleven points behind Webber. Hamilton's retirement meant that he slipped to third place, nine points behind Alonso. Vettel's second-place finish resulted in him moving into fourth place ahead of Button. In the World Constructors' Championship, Red Bull's strong finish allowed them to draw further ahead of McLaren who were now twenty-four points behind. Ferrari remained in third on 319 points, forty points behind McLaren. Mercedes increased their points advantage over Renault to thirty-five with four races remaining in the season.|$|E
5|$|Austria's Alexander Wurz {{drove through}} the field in his Williams from 19th at the start to finish third by taking one pitstop, {{completing}} 40 laps on super soft tires. By finishing third Wurz, recorded his third career podium, in the race that marked ten years since his debut race in F1. Nick Heidfeld finished in second place after trailing Hamilton {{for the majority of}} the race. The safety car deployments also allowed Heikki Kovalainen <b>to</b> <b>move</b> <b>up</b> to fourth after starting at the back of the grid. The race was the first time in the 2007 season where a driver from a team other than Ferrari or McLaren made the podium.|$|E

5|$|Following Mangini's departure, New York {{hoped to}} lure former Pittsburgh Steelers head coach Bill Cowher out of retirement, {{suggesting}} that Cowher might be given control of football operations {{in addition to}} serving as coach. However, Cowher decided to remain retired for the season. On January 20, 2009, the Jets offered the position to Baltimore Ravens defensive coordinator Rex Ryan, who accepted. Tannenbaum engineered a draft-day trade with Cleveland, which enabled New York <b>to</b> <b>move</b> <b>up</b> and select highly regarded USC quarterback Mark Sanchez.|$|E

However, this schedule conflicted {{with the release of}} The Men Who Stare at Goats, another Clooney film. The film was eventually released on December 4 in fifteen theaters spanning twelve markets, broadening in the next week to 72 theaters and going into wide release on December 23, 2009. It was released in other countries beginning in early 2010.|$|E
5|$|Gil de Ferran won {{the pole}} {{position}} and maintained his lead throughout the race's first half.

Hélio Castroneves took over the lead after de Ferran made a pit stop for fuel and held it for 15 laps before he retired with a mechanical issue. Fernández and Tony Kanaan held the first position {{over the next seven}} laps. Andretti moved into first place on the 71st lap and maintained the position to win the race.|$|E

5|$|Given {{the size}} of the Austrian force {{approaching}} him, Ney planned to withdraw to Winterthur. Before he could implement this action, the over-all commander of the forward line, Jean Victor Tharreau, had galloped to his position and said he would support Ney by sending Jean-de-Dieu Soult's division; Ney understood this to mean he was to make a stand along the entire outpost line, and {{that he would not be}} isolated. His small force would receive reinforcements from Soult's division. Consequently, Ney directed the weakest brigade, under the command of Gazan, <b>to</b> <b>move</b> <b>up</b> a long valley toward Frauenfeld, and another brigade, under the command of Roget, to take the right, preventing any Austrian flanking manoeuvre.|$|E
5|$|In either 469 or 466 BC, the Persians began {{assembling}} a large army and navy {{for a major}} offensive against the Greeks. Gathering near the Eurymedon, {{it is possible that}} the expedition aimed <b>to</b> <b>move</b> <b>up</b> the coast of Asia Minor, capturing each city in turn. This would bring the Asiatic Greek regions back under Persian control, and give the Persians naval bases from which to launch further expeditions into the Aegean. Hearing of the Persian preparations, the Athenian general Cimon took 200 triremes and sailed to Phaselis in Pamphylia, which eventually agreed to join the Delian League. This effectively blocked the Persian strategy at its first objective.|$|E

Roosevelt issued a public {{statement}} calling for {{an expansion of the}} Air Corps in anticipation of the coming of World War II and the needs of the United States in defending the Western Hemisphere, that Army policy was reversed. Gen. George C. Marshall, who was soon <b>to</b> <b>move</b> <b>up</b> from head of the War Plans Division to be the Army's chief of staff, received personal instruction on the capabilities and strengths of long-range bombers from new Air Corps chief Gen.

5|$|The {{hydrodynamic}} wind {{within the}} upper {{portion of a}} planet's atmosphere allows light chemical elements such as hydrogen <b>to</b> <b>move</b> <b>up</b> to the exobase, the lower limit of the exosphere, where the gases can then reach escape velocity, entering outer space without impacting other particles of gas. This type of gas loss from a planet into space is known as planetary wind. Such a process over geologic time causes water-rich planets such as the Earth to evolve into planets like Venus. Additionally, planets with hotter lower atmospheres could accelerate the loss rate of hydrogen.|$|E
5|$|Analysis of the jaw {{structure}} of Carnotaurus by Mazzetta and colleagues (1998, 2004, 2009) {{suggests that the}} animal was capable of quick bites, but not strong ones. Quick bites {{are more important than}} strong bites when capturing small prey, as shown by studies of modern-day crocodiles. These researchers also noted a high degree of flexibility (kinesis) within the skull and especially the lower jaw, somewhat similar to modern snakes. Elasticity of the jaw would have allowed Carnotaurus to swallow small prey items whole. In addition, the front part of the lower jaw was hinged, and thus able <b>to</b> <b>move</b> <b>up</b> and down. When pressed downwards, the teeth would have projected forward, allowing Carnotaurus to spike small prey items; when the teeth were curved upwards, the now backward projecting teeth would have hindered the caught prey from escaping. Mazzetta and colleagues also found that the skull was able to withstand forces that appear when tugging on large prey items. Carnotaurus may therefore have fed mainly on relatively small prey, but also was able to hunt large dinosaurs.|$|E
5|$|As an amateur, Cotto {{represented}} Puerto Rico in {{the lightweight}} and light welterweight divisions at various international events, including the 1999 Pan American Games, the 2000 Olympics, and the 1998 Junior World Championships; {{the latter in}} which he won a lightweight silver medal. Having begun his professional career in 2001, Cotto defeated Kelson Pinto for the WBO light welterweight title in 2004. He made six successful defenses before vacating the title <b>to</b> <b>move</b> <b>up</b> in weight. In his first welterweight fight, in 2006, Cotto defeated Carlos Quintana for the vacant WBA title. He successfully defended it four times before a career first loss to Antonio Margarito in 2008. The following year, Cotto won the vacant WBO welterweight title and defended it once before losing it to Manny Pacquiao in the same year.|$|E
