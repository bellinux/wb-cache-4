5|$|In 2011, Kalam was criticised {{by civil}} groups over his {{stand on the}} Koodankulam Nuclear Power Plant; he {{supported}} {{the establishment of the}} nuclear power plant and was accused of not speaking with the local people. The protesters were hostile to his visit as <b>they</b> <b>saw</b> <b>him</b> as a pro-nuclear scientist and were unimpressed by the assurances he provided regarding the safety features of the plant.|$|E
5|$|In their 2004 {{study of}} lynching, Peter Ehrenhaus and A. Susan Owen compare the lynching to a blood sacrifice, arguing Waco {{residents}} {{felt a sense}} of collective righteousness after Washington's death, as <b>they</b> <b>saw</b> <b>him</b> as the presence of evil in the community. Bernstein compares the public brutality of the lynch mob to the medieval English practice of hanging, drawing, and quartering people convicted of high treason.|$|E
5|$|Madden {{said that}} {{challenges}} of filming in India included the street noise, {{as well as}} the people's curiosity and hospitality when <b>they</b> <b>saw</b> <b>him</b> producing a camera. The cast and crew were well received by the locals, as was the director who, along with the cast, was invited by Arvind Singh Mewar, the Maharaja of Udaipur, to attend his lavish Diwali celebrations and firework display, as well as attend a royal wedding held at the Rambagh Palace Hotel in Jaipur. Chris Gill was the editor of the picture.|$|E

5|$|Many of {{the clergy}} who served under him in Armagh {{recommended}} that the Pope appoint Conwell to head the diocese permanently. Some opposed him, accusing him of being frequently absent from his parish to visit France and Scotland. The British government also objected, favoring Patrick Curtis instead, as <b>they</b> <b>saw</b> <b>him</b> as more friendly to their interests. The Vatican agreed, and Pope Pius VII appointed Curtis to Armagh, offering Conwell instead a choice of the sees of Philadelphia or Madras; Conwell chose Philadelphia. Now more than 70 years old, he was ordained bishop in London on September 24, 1819, by Bishop William Poynter, the Vicar Apostolic of the London District, assisted by Fathers James Bramston and Joseph Francis Carpue.|$|E
5|$|The {{day after}} Nixon's {{election}} as President in November 1968, he asked Chotiner what job he would like, and Chotiner {{indicated that he}} wanted to be chairman of the Republican National Committee (RNC), but was told that was impossible. However, Mitchell and soon-to-be White House Chief of Staff H.R. Haldeman wished to see Chotiner given a position outside the White House, as <b>they</b> <b>saw</b> <b>him</b> as a rival. Accordingly, they proposed that Chotiner be made RNC executive director, to wield the real power with the chairman as figurehead. A reluctant Nixon, who was worried about Chotiner's hatchet-man reputation, finally agreed, and Chotiner wrapped up his affairs in California.|$|E
25|$|Given his {{departure}} from radicalism, and {{his attempts to}} have former fellow travellers prosecuted, it is unsurprising that less successful contemporaries who kept the faith attacked Southey. <b>They</b> <b>saw</b> <b>him</b> as selling out for money and respectability.|$|E
5000|$|Davis {{has three}} children: Jack, Catherine and Jensen, as {{mentioned}} in the Garfield: The Movie DVD commentary. Davis's three children said that the CG version of Garfield looked [...] "evil" [...] when <b>they</b> first <b>saw</b> <b>him.</b>|$|R

25|$|The Jin Shu {{mentioned}} that Chen Shou fell sick during the filial mourning period after his father's death. Some guests who visited his home expressed disapproval when <b>they</b> <b>saw</b> <b>him</b> being served medicine by his servants, {{because he was}} expected to lead an austere life during that period. His fellow townsfolk criticised him when they heard about it.|$|E
25|$|The ghost hypnotized them, {{and they}} {{wandered into the}} mire, fell through the ice, and were sucked into the thick bog.

25|$|The moves {{allowed the}} 76ers to make Iguodala the unquestioned {{leader of the}} team, and {{evaluate}} whether <b>they</b> <b>saw</b> <b>him</b> as a franchise player.

They would stumble out to an eight-game losing streak with Iverson deactivated; however, {{they were able to}} finish the season on a high note, going 30–29 {{for the remainder of the}} season. They finished the year 35–47.|$|E

25|$|Griffin {{started as}} a singer on radio at age 19, {{appearing}} on San Francisco Sketchbook, a nationally syndicated program based at KFRC. Griffin was overweight as an adolescent and a young man, which disappointed some radio fans when <b>they</b> <b>saw</b> <b>him</b> in person. He wrote years later in his autobiography that originally there was a deliberate effort to keep the public from finding out how he looked. Embarrassed by the weight issue, Griffin resolved to change his appearance, losing 80 pounds in four months.|$|E
25|$|The two {{vehicles}} {{with the group}} of whites pulled off the freeway and into the motel parking lot. The group said they believed that Anderson was trying to steal a vehicle because <b>they</b> <b>saw</b> <b>him</b> trying to break into one. The vehicle was Anderson's own; {{he had lost his}} keys. The group repeatedly beat Anderson and robbed him, the district attorney said, citing reports from witnesses. Video from a motel security camera shows the perpetrators entering and leaving the picture frame; it did not capture the beating. One witness reported that one of the perpetrators yelled, “white power,” when returning to his truck after the beating.|$|E
25|$|After his {{fingerprints}} {{were found}} at the crime scene, Guede was extradited from Germany; he had said on the Internet that {{he knew he was}} a suspect and wanted to clear his name. Guede opted for a fast-track trial, held in closed session with no reporters present. He told the court that he had gone to Via della Pergola7 on a date arranged with Kercher, after meeting her the previous evening. Two neighbours of Guede's, foreign female students who were with him at a nightclub on that evening, told police the only girl <b>they</b> <b>saw</b> <b>him</b> talking to had long blonde hair. Guede said Kercher had let him in the cottage around 9pm. Sollecito's lawyers said a glass fragment from the window found beside a shoe-print of Guede's {{at the scene of the}} crime was proof that Guede had broken in.|$|E

25|$|When {{the girls}} {{found out that}} Charles was coming to the DiLaurentis {{household}} (for his birthday), they plan on catching him as he is set to meet with Jason. However, the plan backfires when the police appeared. Rosewood High ultimately bans the girls from their prom and graduation after an incident at Aria's photo gallery contest. Hanna discovers that the company who gave her a scholarship is affiliated with Radley (and Mr. DiLaurentis). She and Spencer decided to return {{the money to the}} company, where they meet Rhys Matthews, whom they later suspected to be Charles. The girls also became suspicious of Aria's friend Clark, believing that he may be working for Charles when <b>they</b> <b>saw</b> <b>him</b> following Rhys into a warehouse. Despite being banned, the girls head over to the prom when they discover that Alison was meeting Charles there. Subsequently, Charles kidnaps Alison at the prom; the girls began searching for her, along with Ezra, Toby, Caleb, Sara, Mona, and Clark (who is revealed to be an undercover agent).|$|E
25|$|Witnesses {{who came}} forward {{said that on}} the evening of 30 November, they had seen an {{individual}} resembling the dead man lying on his back in the same spot and position near the Crippled Children's Home where the corpse was later found. A couple who saw him at around 7pm noted that <b>they</b> <b>saw</b> <b>him</b> extend his right arm to its fullest extent and then drop it limply. Another couple who saw him from 7:30pm to 8pm, during which time the street lights had come on, recounted that they did not see him move during the half an hour in which he was in view, although they did have the impression that his position had changed. Although they commented between themselves that he must be dead because he was not reacting to the mosquitoes, they had thought it more likely that he was drunk or asleep, and thus did not investigate further. One of the witnesses told the police she observed a man looking down at the sleeping man {{from the top of the}} steps that lead to the beach. Witnesses said the body was in the same position when the police viewed it.|$|E
25|$|Since 1964, {{there had}} been a growing civil rights {{campaign}} in Northern Ireland. The Northern Ireland Civil Rights Association sought to end discrimination against Catholics by the unionist government of Northern Ireland. In March and April 1966, Irish republicans held parades throughout Ireland to mark the 50th anniversary of the Easter Rising. On 8 March, a group of Irish Republican Army (IRA) volunteers, acting on their own initiative, planted a bomb that destroyed Nelson's Pillar in Dublin. At the time, the IRA was weak and not engaged in armed action, but some unionists feared that it was about to be revived and launch another campaign in Northern Ireland. In April, Ulster loyalists led by Ian Paisley, a Protestant fundamentalist preacher, founded the Ulster Constitution Defence Committee (UCDC). It set up a paramilitary-style wing called the Ulster Protestant Volunteers (UPV). The 'Paisleyites' set out to stymie {{the civil rights movement and}} oust Terence O'Neill, Prime Minister of Northern Ireland. Although O'Neill was a unionist, <b>they</b> <b>saw</b> <b>him</b> as being too 'soft' on the civil rights movement and too friendly with the Republic of Ireland. There was to be much overlap in membership between the UCDC/UPV and the UVF.|$|E

25|$|According to many historians, most of Jesus' teachings were intelligible and {{acceptable}} {{in terms of}} Second Temple Judaism; what set Christians apart from Jews was their faith in Christ as the resurrected messiah. The belief in a resurrected Messiah is unacceptable to Jews today and to Rabbinic Judaism, and Jewish authorities have long used this fact to explain the break between Judaism and Christianity. Recent work by historians paints a more complex portrait of late Second Temple Judaism and early Christianity. Some historians have suggested that, before his death, Jesus forged among his believers such certainty that the Kingdom of God and {{the resurrection of the}} dead was at hand, that with few exceptions (John 20: 24-29) when <b>they</b> <b>saw</b> <b>him</b> shortly after his execution, they had no doubt that he had been resurrected, and that the restoration of the Kingdom and resurrection of the dead was at hand. These specific beliefs were compatible with Second Temple Judaism. In the following years the restoration of the Kingdom as Jews expected it failed to occur. Some Christians believed instead that Christ, rather than being the Jewish messiah, was God made flesh, who died for the sins of humanity, and that faith in Jesus Christ offered everlasting life (see Christology).|$|E
500|$|As {{the defence}} closed, the Daily Chronicle {{considered}} [...] "the obvious doubts which tainted the accusations of the defendants... {{they and the}} Prince's flunkeys all contradicted each other on material points".
