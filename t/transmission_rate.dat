40|$|Abstract Background Since the {{detection}} of MRSA CC 398 in pigs in 2004, it has emerged in livestock worldwide. MRSA CC 398 {{has been found in}} people in contact with livestock and thus has become a public health issue. Data from a large-scale longitudinal study in two Danish and four Dutch pig herds were used to quantify MRSA CC 398 <b>transmission</b> <b>rates</b> within pig herds and to identify factors affecting transmission between pigs. Results Sows and their offspring were sampled at varying intervals during a production cycle. Overall MRSA prevalence of sows increased from 33 % before farrowing to 77 % before weaning. Overall MRSA prevalence of piglets was[*]>[*] 60 % during the entire study period. The recurrent finding of MRSA in the majority of individuals indicates true colonization or might be the result of contamination. <b>Transmission</b> <b>rates</b> were estimated using a Susceptible-Infectious-Susceptible (SIS -) model, which resulted in values of the reproduction ratio (R 0) varying from 0. 24 to 8. 08. <b>Transmission</b> <b>rates</b> were higher in pigs treated with tetracyclins and β-lactams compared to untreated pigs implying a selective advantage of MRSA CC 398 when these antimicrobials are used. Furthermore, <b>transmission</b> <b>rates</b> were higher in pre-weaning pigs compared to post-weaning pigs which might be explained by an age-related susceptibility or the presence of the sow as a primary source of MRSA CC 398. Finally, <b>transmission</b> <b>rates</b> increased with the relative increase of the infection pressure within the pen compared to the total infection pressure, implying that within-pen transmission is a more important route compared to between-pen transmission and transmission through environmental exposure. Conclusion Our results indicate that MRSA CC 398 is able to spread and persist in pig herds, resulting in an endemic situation. <b>Transmission</b> <b>rates</b> are affected by the use of selective antimicrobials and by the age of pigs. </p...|$|R
