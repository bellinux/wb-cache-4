5000|$|Drawing on {{observations}} {{based in}} typological cross-linguistic comparisons of languages , linguists in the relational grammar (RG) tradition (e.g. [...] observed that particular thematic relations and theta roles map on to particular {{positions in the}} sentence. For example, in unmarked situations agents map to subject positions, themes onto object position, and goals onto indirect objects. In RG, this is encoded in the Universal Alignment Hypothesis (or UAH), where the thematic relations are mapped directly into argument position based on the following hierarchy: Agent < Theme < Experiencer < Others. Mark Baker adopted this idea into GB theory {{in the form of}} the Uniformity of Theta Assignment Hypothesis (or UTAH) [...] UTAH explains how identical <b>thematic</b> <b>relationships</b> between items are shown by identical structural relationships.

40|$|Recent studies {{assessing}} {{the role of}} associative/event-based (thematic) and categorical (taxonomic) relations {{in the organization of}} object representations suggest that <b>thematic</b> <b>relationships</b> may influence the perceived similarity of manipulable artifacts. At the same time, evidence suggests that action knowledge is an important component of manipulable artifact representations. However, the role that action plays in processing <b>thematic</b> <b>relationships</b> between objects is unclear. In this study, we assessed healthy and left hemisphere stroke participants to explore three questions: 1. Do participants favor thematic relations involving action (Th+A, e. g., wine bottle – corkscrew), <b>thematic</b> <b>relationships</b> without action (Th-A, e. g., wine bottle – cheese), or taxonomic relationships (Tax, e. g., wine bottle – water bottle) when choosing between them in an association judgment task? 2. Do the underlying constructs of event, action, and categorical relatedness implicitly determine the choices that participants make? 3. Does degraded action knowledge and/or damage to temporo-parietal cortex (a region of the brain associated with action representations) reduce the influence of action on the choice task? Experiment 1 showed that explicit ratings of event, action, and categorical relatedness differentially predicted healthy participants’ choices, with action relatedness determining choices between Th+A and Th-A associations above and beyond event and categorical ratings. Experiment 2 focused more specifically on these Th+A vs. Th-A choices and demonstrated that participants with left temporo-parietal lesions, a brain region known to be involved in sensorimotor processing, were less likely than controls, and tended to be less likely than patients with lesions sparing that region, to implicitly use action knowledge in determining their choices. We conclude that action knowledge plays a critical role in processing of thematic relations for manipulable artifacts...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: In this paper, {{the number}} of {{associative}} concepts is focused on, and action concept associations analyzed, {{in order to find}} out the effects of <b>thematic</b> <b>relationships</b> between concepts during the creative design process. To elucidate the mechanism of the thinking process in creative design, a series of experiments were carried out. Design tasks were selected for two different kinds of concept synthesis, with a high or a low number of associations. Protocol analysis was adopted to analyze how designers conceive other concepts during the design process. Ten design concepts by five subjects were evaluated by nine evaluators from two angles: sense and originality. Nouns, adjectives, and verbs were extracted from the protocols of each subject and divided into seven categories of associative concepts. All subjects except one subject showed higher creativity in Task B, which had a high number of associative concepts, than in Task A, with a low number of associative concepts. Given this, associating many action concepts with connect concepts in <b>thematic</b> <b>relationships</b> leads to design creativity...|$|E
40|$|Spatial and {{temporal}} data are critical components in many applications. This {{is especially true}} in analytical applications ranging from scientific discovery to national security and criminal investigation.

40|$|A Noun Phrase {{must have}} some kind of {{thematic}} role in order to be interpreted in a sentence. These thematic roles are considered to be assigned by a predicate with an argument structure in the Government and Binding framework, which is assumed in this dissertation. An argument structure specifies what thematic roles a predicate has to assign. This dissertation is concerned with how such <b>thematic</b> <b>relationships</b> can be related to structural relationships. It is argued by Baker (1988) that identical <b>thematic</b> <b>relationships</b> between items must be represented by identical structural relationships. This direct correlation between <b>thematic</b> <b>relationships</b> and structural relationships is a simple and ideal tool for a child acquiring a language. Whenever two items which are thematically related appear, their structural relationship is the same anywhere. ^ Baker 2 ̆ 7 s claim argues for the Unaccusative Hypothesis of Relational Grammar, which claims that the subjects of some non-agentive verbs originate in the object position. The claim also argues against lexical derivation of complex predicates. This is because the thematic relationship in a clause must be maintained even when the clause is embedded as a complement clause. As a consequence, Baker 2 ̆ 7 s claim argues that the affixation of complex predicates takes place in syntax. ^ We will argue that there is a syntactic operation called Incorporation in Japanese, which observes the structural relationships between theta-related items. The types of incorporation in Japanese that we discuss are Noun Incorporation and Verb Incorporation. We further argue, considering the interaction among complex predicates, that Incorporation can take place at different levels. Some cases of Incorporation take place in the mapping from S-structure to D-structure, and other instances of incorporation take place at the level of Phonological Form (PF). ...|$|E

40|$|In the {{symbolic}} approach to Natural Language Processing (NLP), a system can only parse grammatically well constructed sentences. Within such a context, several linguistic phenomena, e. g. the thematic pattern {{relationships between the}} sentence constituents, can be accounted for (these pattern relationships are explained by a rule-based linguistic theory called thematic theory). An alternative approach to NLP is a parallel distributed processing model, which has the benefits of learning and generalization. McClelland and Kawamoto (1986) and Waltz and Pollack (1985) proposed connectionist NLP models in which semantic microfeature representations of the words are used, in order {{to account for the}} relationship patterns between words in a sentence. In this paper, an adaptation of these connectionist systems is presented. Here, the microfeatures are based on <b>thematic</b> <b>relationships</b> between the words in the Portuguese sentences. However, will the output of such connectionist system account for the relationship patterns between the words in a sentence in a way which is comparable to that provided by the rulebased approach?

Specifically, a formal and <b>thematic</b> <b>relationship</b> between these two texts is shaped first by a movement from origins to loss, as developed in Voyage de noces, and then by an inverse movement from loss to recovery as outlined in Dora Bruder.

For some cultural psychologists categorization means that we can organize the objects that surround us because of their taxonomic relationship or because of their <b>thematic</b> <b>relationship</b> (Li, Zhang & Nisbett, 2004). Taxonomic categorization (category-based classification) is {{based on the idea that}} objects share similarities in their perceptual properties, whereas thematic categorization (relationship-based classification) is based on the idea that objects share causal, spatial, and temporal relationships (Markham & Hutchinson, 1984). For example, if people would be presented with three words: dog – cat – bone, and asked which two go together, dog – cat would be an example of taxonomic classification; dog – bone would be an example of relational categorization. In their study Markham and Hutchinson (1984) presented word triplets to children of different ages and asked them to indicate which of the two words go together.
