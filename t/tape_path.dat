40|$|The {{purpose of}} the thesis is to {{determine}} an “activation gradient” able to develop the generative energy of a process of participated planning in conditions of indeterminateness. The research {{is based on a}} critical re-reading of four personal experiences and an intuition: the margin of energy, i. e. the funding element of participated processes, may express itself at its best along specific trajectories. The ex post analysis of those experiences evidences that the “institutionalisation” of the process drained off their generative energy. Involvement and sharing produced compromises that alienated the project from its authors, whilst its institutionalisation made participation red tape. Which the reasons of this ineffectiveness? This is a Khunian “anomaly”, unexplainable through existing theories: it requires a new paradigm. This anomaly brings in indeterminateness as the “planning engine” that stimulates innovation and involvement, favouring the activation of self-regenerating free spaces and processes. The “activation gradient” was then introduced to measure the paths of creative energy within an interactive process. The indeterminateness of the project, preventing an excess of compromises, avoids civic alienation whilst keeping alive participation through a longer dialectic process. Keeping margins means the continuity of involvement even when facing red <b>tape</b> <b>paths,</b> through the use of self-organisational practises giving life to structural subjects as “embryos of civitas ”...|$|R
5000|$|U-matic {{was named}} after {{the shape of the}} <b>tape</b> <b>path</b> when it was {{threaded}} around the helical scan video head drum, which resembled the letter U. Betamax used a similar type of [...] "B-load" [...] as well. Recording time was limited to one hour.|$|E
50|$|The <b>tape</b> <b>path</b> then {{carries the}} tape around the {{spinning}} head drum, wrapping it {{around a little}} more than 180 degrees (called the omega transport system) in a helical fashion, assisted by the slanted tape guides. The head rotates constantly at approximately 1800 rpm in NTSC machines, exactly 1500 in PAL, each complete rotation corresponding to one frame of video.|$|E
5000|$|Chopin's poesie sonore {{aesthetics}} {{included a}} deliberate cultivation of a barbarian approach in production, using raw or crude sound manipulations {{to explore the}} area betweendistortion and intelligibility. He avoided high-quality, professional recording machines, preferring to use very basic equipment and bricolage methods, such as sticking matchsticks in the erase heads of a second-hand tape recorder, or manually interfering with the <b>tape</b> <b>path</b> [...]|$|E
50|$|An early {{method used}} to get a higher data rate than the {{prevailing}} linear method was transverse scan. In this method a spinning disk, with the tape heads embedded in the outer edge, is placed perpendicular to the <b>path</b> of the <b>tape.</b> This method is used in Ampex's DCRsi instrumentation data recorders and the old Ampex quadruplex videotape system. Another early method was arcuate scan. In this method, the heads are {{on the face of}} a spinning disk which is laid flat against the <b>tape.</b> The <b>path</b> of the <b>tape</b> heads makes an arc.|$|R
50|$|The above {{describes}} a typical transport system; however, manufacturers engineered many alternative designs. For example, some designs used a horizontal transport deck where the operator simply set the tape reel {{in the supply}} reel bay, {{closed the door and}} pressed the load button, then a vacuum system would draw the <b>tape</b> along the <b>path</b> and onto a take-up hub within the mechanism. Some designs eliminated the vacuum columns in favor of a microprocessor-controlled direct drive design.|$|R
50|$|The Tunnel of Love is a 1958 {{romantic comedy}} film {{based on the}} Broadway hit by Peter De Vries and Joseph Fields. The film follows a married {{suburban}} couple who for reasons unknown, are unable to conceive a child and soon endure endless red <b>tape</b> on a <b>path</b> of adopting a child. The film is the first directorial effort from Gene Kelly in {{which he did not}} also star. Doris Day received a nomination for the Golden Globe Award for Best Actress - Motion Picture Musical or Comedy.|$|R
50|$|Improvements {{in quality}} and economy, and the {{invention}} of the flying erase-head, allowed new video and audio material to be recorded over the material already recorded on an existing magnetic tape and was introduced into the linear editing technique. If a scene closer {{to the beginning of the}} video tape needed to be changed in length, all later scenes would need to be recorded onto the video tape again in sequence. In addition, sources could be played back simultaneously through a vision mixer (video switcher) to create more complex transitions between scenes. A popular 1970-80s system for doing that was the U-matic equipment (named for the U-shaped <b>tape</b> <b>path).</b> That system used two tape players and one tape recorder, and edits were done by automatically having the machines back up, then speed up together in synchrony, so the edit didn't roll or glitch. Later, 1980-90's came the smaller beta equipment (named for the B-shaped <b>tape</b> <b>path),</b> and more complex controllers, some of which did the synchronizing electronically.|$|E
50|$|The {{machines}} played continuously {{using an}} auto-reverse mechanism. As the tape reaches one end, the reverse mechanism activates and changes the drive direction. The tape head {{moves to the}} other side and the mechanism shifts pinch rollers. The design does not require the head to turn over; instead, the entire head changes position to play the tape at {{the other side of the}} <b>tape</b> <b>path.</b>|$|E
5000|$|The format {{was called}} [...] "M" [...] {{due to the}} shape of the {{threading}} path of the tape around the helical scan video head drum, which resembles a letter M. (This is also how the U-matic format got its name, for its U-shaped <b>tape</b> <b>path</b> in the VCR.) VHS also uses the same M-shaped tape threading path as M; it was carried over to M from VHS.|$|E
5000|$|The SPPS {{began with}} The Tut Tapes. Tut Taylor, {{also known as}} [...] "Tutbro" [...] has been {{recording}} Americana string bands since the 1950s. His endeavor started {{as a way to}} learn the music but it became much more. Over the years, he used many tape recorders, and his collection of <b>tapes</b> became a <b>path</b> through history. Taylor's massive collection of over 500 tape recordings needed to be saved, as it represented a half a century of acoustic music. This collection consists of over 500 reel to reel and cassette tapes of Tut Taylor and various figures in the American music scene.|$|R
2500|$|In 1991 Manu Lehtinen had {{the name}} and logo ready for Deuteronomium, but it wasn't until 1993 when he formed the band with his brother Jarno. While Deuteronomium means the fifth Book of the Hebrew Bible, Deuteronomy, Manu Lehtinen chose the name because he thought that [...] "it looked cool, is hard to spell, {{so it was a}} perfect name for a metal band!" [...] In the {{beginning}} their style was more straightforward death metal and grindcore with Vengeance Rising, Mortification, Cannibal Corpse and Carcass as their influences. They were soon joined by guitarists Miika Partala and Tapio Laakso. Miika Partala immediately proved to be a talented guitarist. They played their first gig on December 3, 1993. After that Deuteronomium recorded their first demo <b>tape</b> titled <b>Paths</b> of Righteousness which became popular in certain circles. between 1993 and 1994 Jarno Lehtinen and Tapio Laakso left the band. They were replaced by Kalle Paju (guitar) and Ali Hassinen (drums). After some gigs Deuteronomium lost their rehearsal place. The band went on a hiatus.|$|R
40|$|We {{examined}} organic contamination by Fourier transform infrared micro spectroscopic (micro FTIR) {{measurements of}} carbonaceous chondrite samples. Carbonaceous chondrites, Tagish Lake (C 2), Murchison (CM 2) and Moss (CO 3), and some mineral powder samples pressed on aluminum plates were measured by micro FTIR {{before and after}} storage in several containers with silicone rubber mat. During storage, samples did not touch directly anything except the holding aluminum plates. The carbonaceous chondrites containing hydrous minerals (Tagish Lake and Murchison) pressed on aluminum plates and measured by transmission-reflection micro FTIR measurements {{were found to be}} contaminated during storage after only one day, as revealed by an increase of approximately 2965 /cm and approximately 1260 /cm peaks. The Moss meteorite which contains no hydrous minerals, did not show an increase of these peaks, indicating no organic contamination. This difference is probably related to the differing mineralogy and physical properties (including porosity and permeability) of these chondrites. Hydrous minerals such as antigorite, muscovite, montmorillonite and silica gel showed organic contamination by the same infrared measurements, while anhydrous materials such as SiO 2 and KBr showed no contamination. These results indicate importance of surface OH groups for the organic contamination. Organic contamination was found on silica gel samples pressed on aluminum plates when they were stored within containers including silicone rubber, silicone grease or adhesive <b>tape.</b> Long <b>path</b> gas cell FTIR measurements for silicone rubber indicated methylsiloxane oligomers were released from the silicone rubber. In-situ heating infrared measurements on the contaminated antigorite and Tagish Lake showed decrease of the 1262 /cm (Si-CH 3) and 2963 /cm (CH 3) peaks from room temperature to 200 - 300 C indicating desorption of volatile contaminants. These results indicate that careful preparation and storage are essential for FTIR measurements on precious astromaterial samples such as meteorites, IDPs and samples returned from comets, asteroids and Mars. Every possible contamination source should be evaluated before anything is done to these samples...|$|R
50|$|The {{cartridges}} have {{an audible}} pause {{due to the}} presence of a length of metallic foil, which a sensor detects and signals the end of the tape and acts as a splice for the loop. The foil passes across a pair of electrical contacts which are in the <b>tape</b> <b>path.</b> Contact of the foil closes an electrical circuit that engages a solenoid which mechanically shifts the tape head {{to the level of the}} next track.|$|E
50|$|The {{vacuum system}} {{provided}} a physical buffer between the precision {{movements of the}} capstan and the large movements of the reels by storing a short length of tape in the vacuum column under relatively low tension. The vacuum columns were chambers open at one end, the openings being {{in line with the}} <b>tape</b> <b>path</b> before and after the capstan and roller assemblies. The amount of tape in the column was controlled by four optical or vacuum sensors {{on the sides of the}} columns. The control electronics kept the curve of the tape loop between the two inner sensors, cueing the supply reel to feed more or the take-up reel to take more as necessary. The outer two sensors, at the very top and bottom of the columns, served to sense malfunctions in the feed mechanism during operation, prompting the control electronics to shut off all operation of the tape transport and vacuum system to prevent damaging the tape. Because of the tension provided by the vacuum columns and the design of the <b>tape</b> <b>path,</b> tape was usually kept in sufficient contact with the relatively high-friction coating on the capstan that a pinch roller was not used.|$|E
50|$|High-frequency flutter, above 100 Hz, can {{sometimes}} result from tape vibrating {{as it passes}} over a head (or other non-rotating element in the <b>tape</b> <b>path),</b> {{as a result of}} rapidly interacting stretching in the tape and stick-slip at the head. This is termed 'scrape flutter'. It adds a roughness to the sound that is not typical of wow & flutter, and damping devices or heavy rollers are sometimes employed on professional tape machines to reduce or prevent it. Scrape flutter measurement requires special techniques, often using a 10 kHz tone.|$|E
40|$|Overview This testset {{consists}} of 23 terms which have experienced word sense change {{during the past}} centuries. The main changes for each term were found using Wikipedia, dictionary. com and the Oxford English Dictionary. We consider major changes in usage as well as changes to sense. In cases where multiple (fine-grained) senses were available, we opted to accept the widest sense. E. g. for the term rock we consider a music sense without any distinction between different types of rock music, because our dataset is unlikely to have fine-grained sense differentiations. If a clear time point cannot be pinpointed, we choose the earliest possible. For comparison purposes we also chose a set of 11 terms that have experienced minimal change during the investigated period, i. e., stable terms. Supplementary material 1. testset. txt Contains {{a list of all}} terms and the different change types for each term with a short description of the sense and change. 2. Files of the kind "TERM. txt" The header tells us the term, which clustering coefficient was used, which similarity threshold and which similarity measure. A path starts with "Path:". A unit starts with "UNIT:" and the numbers following indicate 1. the number of years that the unit spans, and then a list of all years that the internal clusters stem from. E. g., UNIT: 83 1785, 1787, 1790, 1793, 1798, 1801, 1823, 1867, spanns 83 years and {{consists of}} clusters from year 1785, 1787, 1790 etc. Indentation shows the tree structure, more indentation means lower level branch in the tree. As an example, in AEROPLANE. txt unit UNIT: 23 1908, 1909, 1910, 1911, 1914, 1918, 1930, 1908 is the root node and the unit is related to UNIT: 27 1916, 1919, 1924, 1932, 1942, 1916. Interesting findings The longest units and paths are found for stable terms, e. g., newspaper. These are statistically significantly longer than the average units and paths for terms that later evolve. Newspaper has a unit that spans 145 years and the first path spans from 1852 - 2007. FLIGHT. txt For the term flight we find that the first unit captures a name, Flight & Robson who were organ builders. The second unit (it its own path) represents the flight over a hurdle: UNIT: 28 1868, 1869, 1870, 1877, 1885, 1889, 1890, 1892, 1893, 1894, 1895 There is a unit (it its own path) that represents the flight of a cricket ball: UNIT: 29 1938, 1957, 1966 Finally, the last path represents flight as in a means of transportation, in particular for holidays, starting with UNIT: 19 1962, 1970, 1973, 1980 TAPE. txt The first <b>path</b> for <b>tape</b> is a <b>path</b> related to sowing tape. Then there is a second path starting with UNIT: 38 1970, 1974, 2007 that takes up the musical <b>tape.</b> The last <b>path</b> end in the same units that the second path ends in, also related to the musical tape. The music tape and the sowing tape should be related because of their shape, but we cannot find any relation as there are few or no overlapping terms...|$|R
50|$|The adapter is mechanical, {{although}} early examples were motorized, with a battery. It has {{an internal}} hub {{to engage with}} the VCR mechanism in {{the location of a}} normal full-size tape hub, driving the gearing on the VHS-C cassette. Also, when a VHS-C cassette is inserted into the adapter, a small swing-arm pulls the tape out of the miniature cassette to span the standard <b>tape</b> <b>path</b> distance between the guide rollers of a full-size tape. This allows the tape from the miniature cassette to use the same loading mechanism as that from the standard cassette.|$|E
5000|$|Cassette demagnetizers of the [...] "cassette" [...] type {{physically}} {{resemble a}} cassette tape shell but contain circuitry to demagnetize the tape {{heads of the}} tape deck. Another type of demagnetizer, the [...] "wand" [...] type can demagnetize anything that it is brought into contact with, including the tape heads and capstans. Nakamichi manufactured a [...] "wand" [...] type demagnetizer in the 1980s. This design had the advantage {{that it could be}} used to demagnetize other metal parts of the <b>tape</b> <b>path</b> (not just the actual record/playback heads) however it required careful use (to avoid increasing the magnetization of the heads) and if used too close to actual cassette tapes could inadvertently act as a [...] "bulk eraser".|$|E
5000|$|Dokorder was a {{brand of}} tape {{recorder}} from Japanese electronics company , located in Ōta, Tokyo (not related to the Onkyo audio company of Osaka, neither to Denon) that included a four-reel transport system called [...] "Dub-A-Tape" [...] capable of feeding two different tapes through the same tape head assembly and, in the process, recording a duplicate of a tape. (The master and blank tapes passed through the same capstan, but through different tape head areas, yielding a Y-shaped <b>tape</b> <b>path</b> reflected in the slots built into the head assembly. Denki Onkyo also supplied a consumer and semi-pro line of reel to reel recorders (including 4 track multitracks) that competed with Tascam/Teac and Sony but ultimately its products {{were found to be}} less durable than the competition.|$|E
5000|$|Tape motion on many systems was bidirectional, i.e. tape {{could be}} read either forward or {{backward}} {{at the request of}} the controlling computer. Because the supply vacuum column kept a small, constant tension in the reverse direction, the capstan could feed backwards without the tape bunching up or jumping out of path. Unlike most audio tape systems, the capstan and head assemblies were always in contact with the tape, even during fast forward and reverse operations, only moving the head assembly away from the <b>tape</b> <b>path</b> during high-speed rewind. On some units, manufacturers installed a [...] "fast search" [...] capability which could move the tape quickly a certain number of blocks, then bring the tape to a halt and go back to read the requested data at normal speed.|$|E
5000|$|To load a tape, an {{operator}} would remove the protective ring (frequently called a [...] "tape seal belt" [...] because its {{purpose was to}} prevent humidity and dust on the media) from {{the outside of the}} tape reel and install the tape on the supply hub, then thread the tape leader through the various roller assemblies and onto the take-up reel, installing three or four winds of tape to provide enough friction for the take-up motor to be able to pull the tape. The operator then initiated an automatic sequence, often by a single press of a button, that would start the vacuum system, then move the tape forward until the beginning-of-tape (BOT) foil strip was detected by an optical sensor in the <b>tape</b> <b>path.</b> The control electronics would then indicate to the controlling computer that the unit was ready for operation.|$|E
50|$|The PXL-2000 {{has several}} weak points. The most common fault is a decayed drive belt, common to most tape {{mechanisms}} of the 1980s, and fogged blue filters. The blue filter is a glass optical component that is fitted behind the lens to prevent infrared light {{from reaching the}} CCD and producing miscoloured images. They tend to become fogged in stored PXLs, possibly {{as a result of}} outgassing from the plastic components of the camera. This issue can be fixed by disassembling the camera, removing the blue filter, and cleaning it with a window cleaning solution like Windex. Many PXL-2000 cameras have also suffered damage from leaking electrolyte from old batteries, but this is usually not serious and can be easily repaired. Cameras left with tapes inserted {{for long periods of time}} may also need the <b>tape</b> <b>path</b> to be cleaned and a pinch wheel replacement.|$|E
50|$|In {{terms of}} video quality, Video8 and Beta-II offer similar {{performance}} in their standard-play modes. In terms of audio, Video8 generally outperforms its older rivals. Standard VHS and Beta audio is recorded along a narrow linear track {{at the edge}} of the tape, where it is vulnerable to damage. Coupled with the slow horizontal tape speed, the sound was comparable with that of a low-quality audio cassette. By contrast, all Video8 machines used audio frequency modulation (AFM) to record sound along the same helical <b>tape</b> <b>path</b> as that of the video signal. This meant that Video8's standard audio was of a far higher quality than that of its rivals, although linear audio did have the advantage that (unlike either AFM system) it could be re-recorded without disturbing the video. (Betamax and VHS Hi-Fi rarely appeared on camcorders, except on the high-end models.) Video8 later included true stereo, but the limitations of camcorder microphones at the time meant that there was little practical difference between the two AFM systems for camcorder usage. In general, Video8 comfortably outperforms non-HiFi VHS/Beta.|$|E
5000|$|The loop of tape in the duplicator's bin usually {{will have}} a segment of clear leader spliced in between the {{beginning}} and end of the tape loop (with some duplicators using a metal foil splice instead). This clear leader splice is read by an optical sensor (or in the case of a foil splice, coming in contact with electrical contacts in the <b>tape</b> <b>path)</b> in the loop bin duplicator, which triggers a cue tone that is recorded to the reel of pancake tape. This cue tone is read by the loader, and engages it, for cassettes, to stop and cut the tape from the pancake and either splice it to the leader in the C-0 cassette shell, or for 8-tracks, to disengage winding to an internal cartridge reel on the [...] "sidewinder" [...] mechanism and then cut the tape (a process for both types of media called [...] "de-spooling"), with the winding resuming to a new reel afterwards. In fact, part of this de-spooling tone (also known as a [...] "tailor tone" [...] or [...] "trigger tone") can be heard at the leader splice or foil splice of some previously recorded audio cassettes and 8-tracks respectively, as a very low-frequency arpeggiated rumbling of about 20 Hertz, sounding similar to how [...] "motorboating" [...] sounds with a radio or audio amplifier affected by such, but as an actual higher-frequency tone when played back at a higher speed (as it was when recorded to the tape at high speed during duplication).|$|E
5000|$|With vinyl records, {{there will}} be some loss in {{fidelity}} on each playing of the disc. This is due to the wear of the stylus in contact with the record surface. A good quality stylus, matched with a correctly set up pick-up arm, should cause minimal surface wear. Magnetic tapes, both analog and digital, wear from friction between the tape and the heads, guides, {{and other parts of the}} tape transport as the tape slides over them. The brown residue deposited on swabs during cleaning of a tape machine's <b>tape</b> <b>path</b> is actually particles of magnetic coating shed from tapes. Tapes can also suffer creasing, stretching, and frilling of the edges of the plastic tape base, particularly from low-quality or out-of-alignment tape decks. When a CD is played, there is no physical contact involved, and the data is read optically using a laser beam. Therefore, no such media deterioration takes place, and the CD will, with proper care, sound exactly the same every time it is played (discounting aging of the player and CD itself); however, this is a benefit of the optical system, not of digital recording, and the Laserdisc format enjoys the same non-contact benefit with analog optical signals. Recordable CDs slowly degrade with time, called disc rot, even if they are not played, and are stored properly. [...] A new compact disc was released called M-DISC which is said to last 1000 years. These discs are recordable and have a layer developed from stone. They come in CD, DVD and Blu-ray formats and various storage sizes. They can be used for music movies and data for computers etc.|$|E
40|$|The {{reduction}} of lateral tape motion (LTM) in tape drives {{is a key}} requirement for improved performance of tape drives since read/write errors are likely to occur if lateral tape motion exceeds {{ten percent of the}} track width of the recorded magnetic signal. Lateral tape motion is a function of <b>tape</b> <b>path</b> and tape properties, mechanical design parameters such as speed and tension, and friction between tape and <b>tape</b> <b>path</b> components. This investigation deals with the effect of friction on LTM for a tape moving over the surface of a cylindrical guide. The effect of friction and mechanical design parameters on LTM is investigated numerically. The equation of motion for a moving tape on a cylindrical guide surface is determined and the effects of friction and design parameters are examined by calculating the ratio of LTM before and after a cylindrical guide. Keeping the tape velocity and guide radius constant, attenuation of the LTM signal is seen to occur for all frequency components of the signal. Attenuation of LTM is found to increase with increasing friction and roller radius. Increasing tape tension reduces LTM while keeping the friction coefficient constant. 1...|$|E
40|$|The {{friction}} coefficient between a magnetic tape and a guide in a <b>tape</b> <b>path</b> can be minimized by creating micro dimples on the guide surface with laser surface texturing. The dimples enhance {{the formation of}} an air bearing and reduce the {{friction coefficient}} between the tape and the guide due to the increased spacing. A model is presented to optimize the geometry of the surface texturing parameters to maximize the average air bearing pressure and minimize the tape/guide friction coefficient...|$|E
40|$|The {{rapid growth}} of {{computing}} and information technology has enabled pervasive access to the World Wide Web. Over 280 EB of digital data has been generated {{from around the world}} and flowing in the digital universe; as a result, the need for data storage has grown rapidly. A variety of information storage solutions such as hard disk drive (HDD) products that are common information storages for personal computing are available in the market. Modern magnetic tape data storage in terms of its capacity and reliability has been employed as an ideal solution for enterprise-level storage of archival data with applications that include financial records, satellite images, and consumer databases. In magnetic tape technology, the thin, flexible media is transported between the supply and take up packs at a prescribed speed and tension, and over guides and the read/write head. As the tape is transported, in-plane vibration of axially moving tape, known as lateral tape motion (LTM), arises from excitation sources such as the run out of tape pack and impacts between the tape and the flanges on guides or packs. LTM has been identified as a major factor that degrades recording accuracy. Limiting the LTM is the one of the keys that enables the multi-terabytes data storage, and flanged roller guides are commonly implemented in modern tape drives. However, for higher recording density, thinner media is desirable. Reducing the thickness of media can significantly decrease its stiffness and increase the likelihood of damage to media edges by adjacent mechanical components on the guiding path. To avoid this, alternative tape guiding and actuation are required, and many advanced guiding mechanisms without the use of flanged guides have been developed to reduce lateral tape motion in industry and academia. The transverse force (tension) applied to the travelling tape is another key element of LTM dynamics and is controlled using the dynamics of tape pack driving sources in the modern tape drive products in using an open loop control logic. However, the developing advanced guiding and actuation technologies influence the tension irregularly and the current tension control algorithm is not able to handle the irregular changes of tension. An active tension control is required to feasibly advance LTM actuations. This thesis is motivated by the need for future engineering advances in guiding and actuation technologies for magnetic tape. Advanced guiding and actuation technologies have been developed to enable the active tension (transverse force) actuation of axially moving tape. An advanced tension actuation technology of axially moving media with dynamic <b>tape</b> <b>path</b> alternation using a novel rotary guider is considered in this thesis, and its effectiveness and technical feasibility is analysed in the context of actuating travelling tape tension. The specific issues addressed in this thesis are listed below. Development of linear magnetic tape transport system with an advanced active tension actuation. • A homemade linear magnetic tape transport system is developed. • The footsteps of development including technical design details of hardware and software are described. • A tape transport system that enables an actuation of travelling tape tension with dynamic <b>tape</b> <b>path</b> alternation using a novel rotary guider was purposely developed. • The tension is regulated actuating the amount of surface friction force between the tape and the rotary guider by altering the <b>tape</b> <b>path</b> dynamically rotating the rotary guider based on the feedback from strain gauge based tension sensor. Experimental studies of travelling tape tension shift phenomena with fixed <b>tape</b> <b>path.</b> • Parameter studies are carried to investigate the transitions of travelling tape tension during the tape transport process with the fixed angle of rotary guider (fixed <b>tape</b> <b>path)</b> in the travelling speed of tape and the angle of rotary guider. • Through experimental studies, it is found that the tension gradually increases as the tape is transported and the state of change in tension is heavily relay on the dynamics of tape pack driving source. • The angle of rotary guider shifts the level of tension. Generally, higher rotation angle of the rotary guider and the travelling speed of tape apply greater tension to the tape. Transverse force regulation with dynamic <b>tape</b> <b>path</b> alternation. • The effectiveness of tension regulation with dynamic <b>tape</b> <b>path</b> alternation using the rotary guider is investigated through experimental studies. • A closed loop control algorism of rotary guider controller is developed in order to control the operations of the rotary guider and implemented to the tape transport system. • The developed controller has a significant influence to the transition of tension. • The travelling tape tension is successfully regulated as targeted with the designed controller. It can be concluded that the rotary guider with a closed loop control algorism has an ability to actuate the travelling tape tension without relying on the dynamics of tape pack driving sources to control the tension...|$|E
40|$|Many of {{the recent}} {{improvements}} in the capacity of data cartridge systems have been achieved {{through the use of}} narrower tracks, higher linear densities and continuous servo tracking with multi-channel heads. These changes have produced new tribological problems at the head/tape interface. It is crucial that the tribology of such systems is understood and this will continue since increasing storage capacities and faster transfer rates are constantly being sought. Chemical changes in the surface of single and dual layer MP tape have been correlated to signal performance. An accelerated tape tester, consisting of a custom made cycler ("loop tester"), was used to ascertain if results could be produced that were representative of a real tape drive system. A second set of experiments used a modified tape drive (Georgens cycler), which allowed the effects of the tape transport system on the tape surface to be studied. To isolate any effects on the tape surface due to the head/tape interface, read/write heads were not fitted to the cycler. Two further sets of experiments were conducted which included a head in the <b>tape</b> <b>path.</b> This allowed the effects of the head/tape interface on the physical and chemical properties of the head and tape surfaces to be investigated. It was during the final set of experiments that the effect on the head/tape interface, of an energised MR element, was investigated. The effect of operating each cycler at extreme relative humidity and temperature was investigated through the use of an environmental chamber. Extensive use was made of surface specific analytical techniques such as XPS, AFM, AES, and SEM to study the physical and chemical changes that occur at the head/tape interface. Results showed that cycling improved the signal performance of all the tapes tested. The data cartridge drive belt had an effect on the chemical properties of the tape surface on which it was in contact. Also binder degradation occurred for each tape and appeared to be greater at higher humidity. Lubricant was generally seen to migrate to the tape surface with cycling. Any surface changes likely to affect signal output occurred at the head surface rather than the tape...|$|E
