5|$|Tourism and {{deforestation}} in <b>the</b> <b>surroundings</b> {{have taken}} a heavy toll on the lake, adversely affecting its water quality, reducing the water levels and destroying the fish population. As part of conservation measures, the government is undertaking de-silting, de-weeding, water treatment, and afforestation as well as mass awareness programme.|$|E

5|$|A short {{distance}} past the Street Road intersection, PA 232 passes into Solebury Township and crosses the Pidcock Creek. The road continues through {{a mix of}} farms and woods with some residential areas. As the route approaches Aquetong Road, <b>the</b> <b>surroundings</b> become more forested and the road parallels Dark Hollow Run, briefly passing through farm fields. The road enters the borough of New Hope, where it terminates at a junction with Main Street (PA 32).|$|E
5|$|After the {{destruction}} by fire of the Palace of Whitehall in 1698, <b>the</b> <b>surroundings</b> of the Privy Garden changed dramatically. Most {{of the palace}} buildings had been burned down in the 1698 fire; others were torn down as {{the last vestiges of}} the old Tudor and Stuart Palace were removed. With the demise of the Privy Gallery, the Privy Garden was extended north to include the Pebble Court behind the Banqueting House.|$|E
5|$|Camouflage is an {{important}} defense strategy enabled by changes in body shape, colour and markings. Some lepidopterans blend with <b>the</b> <b>surroundings,</b> making them difficult to be spotted by predators. Caterpillars can be shades of green that match their host plant. Others resemble inedible objects, such as twigs or leaves. The larvae of some species, such as the common Mormon and the western tiger swallowtail look like bird droppings.|$|E

5|$|Cylinders {{should not}} be left {{standing}} unattended unless secured {{so that they can}} not fall in reasonably foreseeable circumstances as an impact could damage the cylinder valve mechanism, and conceivably fracture the valve at the neck threads. This is more likely with taper thread valves, and when it happens most of the energy of the compressed gas is released within a second, and can accelerate the cylinder to speeds which can cause severe injury or damage to <b>the</b> <b>surroundings.</b>|$|E
5|$|During heavy rains, it {{was much}} more {{difficult}} to track insurgents by air, negating Portugal's air superiority, and Portuguese troops and vehicles found movement during rain storms difficult. In contrast, the insurgent troops, with lighter equipment, were able to flee into the bush (the mato) amongst an ethnically similar populace into which they could melt away. Furthermore, the FRELIMO forces were able to forage food from <b>the</b> <b>surroundings</b> and local villages, and were thus not hampered by long supply lines.|$|E
5|$|From {{this point}} {{west to the}} highway's end on Long Island Sound, CR101 follows a mostly east–west {{alignment}} through Sands Point. Along this last stretch, the route passes {{to the south of}} Sands Point County Park and north past Sands Point Golf Club as <b>the</b> <b>surroundings</b> around the route become increasingly forested and undeveloped. At Tibbits Lane, the route turns to the northwest and continues to the road's end at a dead end on the southern shore of Long Island Sound.|$|E

5|$|Government {{authorities}} {{wanted to}} destroy {{the last vestiges of}} these Nazi landmarks. The construction of the buildings in the area around the Führerbunker was a strategy for ensuring <b>the</b> <b>surroundings</b> remained anonymous and unremarkable.

5|$|Hygiene {{is a set}} of {{practices}} to avoid infection or food spoilage by eliminating microorganisms from <b>the</b> <b>surroundings.</b> As microorganisms, in particular bacteria, are found virtually everywhere, harmful microorganisms may be reduced to acceptable levels rather than actually eliminated. In food preparation, microorganisms are reduced by preservation methods such as cooking, cleanliness of utensils, short storage periods, or by low temperatures. If complete sterility is needed, as with surgical equipment, an autoclave is used to kill microorganisms with heat and pressure.|$|E
5|$|In the {{automotive}} field, Cluj-Napoca hosts two {{stages in the}} National Rally Championship. Raliul Clujului is held in June; the Avram Iancu Rally, held in September, has been officially organised since 1975, though there were several years when it was not held. The latter rally begins in Cipariu Square and runs across <b>the</b> <b>surroundings</b> of the city.|$|E
30|$|Location {{awareness}} is increasingly important.

5|$|MS172 {{begins at}} an {{intersection}} with US72 near Burnsville {{in the western}} part of Tishomingo County. The route heads to the north of US72 as a two-lane undivided road before soon turning east-southeast at an intersection with County Road982. From this point, the road heads through woodland with some farm fields and homes. Several miles later, the route turns more east and <b>the</b> <b>surroundings</b> become more developed as it becomes Quitman Street and reaches an intersection with MS25 on the western edge of Iuka.|$|E
5|$|NY73 {{begins at}} {{a traffic light}} along NY86 near {{the eastern end of}} the village of Lake Placid in the town of North Elba. The highway heads towards the southwest, passing homes as Sentinel Road. At the {{intersection}} with Mill Pond Road, NY73 passes a small pond, crossing over an associated creek. For that short time, the highway takes on a more southerly direction, mainly to the southeast. <b>The</b> <b>surroundings</b> of the highway remain the same as NY73 leaves Lake Placid via Cascade Road.|$|E

5|$|Pietro Boyesen (1819–1882) was a Danish {{photographer}} who {{spent most of}} his professional life in Rome. Boyesen had a talent for composition and characterization. In contrast to the boring studio portraits which were so common at the time, Boyesen would have his subjects pose outdoors in intimate Roman settings. By playing with the subjects clothes and their relationship to <b>the</b> <b>surroundings,</b> Boyesen would produce works presenting a somewhat timid but intimate charm.|$|E
5|$|The {{volcanic}} activity still continues, dropping volcanic ash on <b>the</b> <b>surroundings.</b> Earlier eruptions built the white sands highlands in the region. The most recent eruption started on May 2, 2017. On September 13, 2016 {{a team of}} experts from Bristol University and the Sakurajima Volcano Research Centre in Japan suggested that the volcano could have a major eruption within 30 years.|$|E
5|$|Tropical {{cyclones}} {{are areas}} of relatively low {{pressure in the}} troposphere, with the largest pressure perturbations occurring at low altitudes near the surface. On Earth, the pressures recorded at the centers of tropical cyclones are among the lowest ever observed at sea level. The environment {{near the center of}} tropical cyclones is warmer than <b>the</b> <b>surroundings</b> at all altitudes, thus they are characterized as “warm core” systems.|$|E
