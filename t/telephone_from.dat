The {{following}} year Colonel Frederick Schermbrucker's youngest daughter Gertrude Mary Schermbrucker, described as an attractive and sociable woman, arrived to stay at the house Coghlan shared with his sister and mother. Coghlan married Gertrude in Wynberg, a southern suburb of Cape Town, on 10 January 1899. Around this time Coghlan's friend Percy Ross Frames invited him to join him in Bulawayo, one of the main settlements in Rhodesia, as Matabeleland, Mashonaland and the adjoining areas were now collectively called. Coghlan was receptive to the idea, but was compelled to stay in Kimberley by the outbreak of the Second Boer War in October 1899. Kimberley was besieged by Boer forces, cut off by rail and <b>telephone,</b> <b>from</b> 14 October until its relief by General John French on 15 February 1900.|$|E

Han survived an aerial bombardment by Japanese planes in Xining while he was being directed via <b>telephone</b> <b>from</b> Ma Bufang, who hid in an air raid shelter in a military barracks.

50|$|Because we use so many {{different}} <b>telephones,</b> <b>from</b> so {{many different}} locations, device or location-based recording methods fall short.

Though the resident governor general's wife, Princess Alice, Countess of Athlone, could do little to add her personal touch to Rideau Hall, due to rationing and scarce supplies, she put many of the other royal ladies to work making clothing for those who had lost their homes in the Blitz. It was then in 1940 that the governor general's office in the East Block of Parliament Hill was closed and moved to Rideau Hall and, in December of the following year, Winston Churchill arrived at the hall, where he presided over British Cabinet meetings via <b>telephone</b> <b>from</b> his bed.|$|E
