5|$|Long before England existed, {{this area}} was at <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> primeval sea. The most notable of the fossils {{uncovered}} is that of an ichthyosaur from Caldecotte, now {{on display in the}} central library.|$|E
5|$|On 20 March 1966, {{four months}} before the 1966 FIFA World Cup in England, the trophy was stolen during a public {{exhibition}} at Westminster Central Hall.

5|$|Phenomena {{associated}} with eclipses include shadow bands (also known as flying shadows), which {{are similar to}} shadows on <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> swimming pool. They only occur just prior to and after totality, when a narrow solar crescent acts as an anisotropic light source.|$|E

5|$|The ride is {{considered}} to be a terrain roller coaster, meaning the ride experiences various elevation changes. Unlike most roller coasters, the ride's second drop is longer than the first. It drops through Thunderbolt's structure, which is located at <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> hill in a ravine.|$|E

5|$|Østhorn has two platforms, {{each with}} a wooden shed. The sheds are {{designed}} by Arne Henriksen in a minimalist and standardised style with constructions of wood and steel. Østhorn serves the residential areas Korsvoll and Nordberg. The station is located at <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> small hill named Havnabakken, where local residents toboggan at winter's time.|$|E
5|$|After {{graduating from}} high school, Vlasic played college {{football}} at the University of Iowa. For four years, {{he served as a}} backup to Chuck Long, now a member of the College Football Hall of Fame. During his junior year, as the backup quarterback, he also served as the holder for field goal kicks. After placekicker Rob Houghtlin won a 12-10 game against the University of Michigan thanks to a last second field goal, a mob tore down the goalpost, which injured four fans including Vlasic, who was at <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> pile of fans.|$|E

5|$|Four {{hundred million}} years ago, California lay at <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> large sea; {{underwater}} volcanoes deposited lava and minerals (including gold) onto the sea floor. By tectonic forces these minerals and rocks came {{to the surface of}} the Sierra Nevada, and eroded. Water carried the exposed gold downstream and deposited it in quiet gravel beds along the sides of old rivers and streams. The forty-niners first focused their efforts on these deposits of gold.|$|E
5|$|In November 2004, the 10th Earl of Shaftesbury {{went missing}} while in France, {{prompting}} an international police investigation. His remains {{were found at}} <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> remote ravine {{in the foothills of}} the French Alps five months after his death. Investigations revealed that he was murdered by his brother-in-law during an argument regarding a divorce from his wife, Jamila M'Barek, both of whom were convicted of his murder.|$|E
5|$|Located in <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> narrow valley, the Nine Stones circle has a {{diameter}} of 9.1 metres by 7.8 metres (29 feet 10 inches by 25 feet 11 inches). It consists of nine irregularly spaced sarsen megaliths, with a small opening on its northern side. Two of the stones on the north-western side of the monument are considerably larger than the other seven. This architectural feature has parallels with various stone circles in south-western Scotland, and was potentially a deliberate choice of the circle's builders, to whom it may have had symbolic meaning.|$|E

5|$|On Tuesday, April 29, Black went to Lee's {{residence}} at 11a.m. looking for evidence, {{and found a}} blood-smeared shirt at <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> burn barrel. The blood was smeared {{high up on the}} armpits and the shirt smelled unused, suggesting to the police that it was a plant. The detectives, suspicious of Frank due to his nervous behavior throughout his interviews, believed that Frank had arranged the plant.|$|E
5|$|The Great Plains cover most of {{the western}} two-thirds of South Dakota. West of the Missouri River the {{landscape}} becomes more arid and rugged, consisting of rolling hills, plains, ravines, and steep flat-topped hills called buttes. In the south, east of the Black Hills, lie the South Dakota Badlands. Erosion from the Black Hills, marine skeletons which fell to <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> large shallow sea that once covered the area, and volcanic material all contribute to the geology of this area.|$|E
5|$|The Pine Bush {{is home to}} bog {{bluegrass}} (Poa paludigena), {{a federal}} species of concern, {{as well as the}} rare red-rooted flatsedge (Cyperus erythrorhizos), Houghton's umbrella-sedge (Cyperus houghtonii), and Schweinitz's flatsedge (Cyperus schweinitzii). Bog bluegrass occurs at <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> ravine in the Pine Bush and is {{the only place in the}} New York Bight watershed where this plant appears. Bayard's malaxis (Malaxis bayardii) is a rare orchid that occurs in the Pine Bush as well.|$|E

5|$|The {{death of}} an {{individual}} – signified by the tolling of the bell – is thus a treasure buried at <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> mine: only of value if it is given to someone who makes good use of it. In this he refers {{to the work of}} Augustine of Hippo, specifically On Christian Doctrine, in which Augustine describes the knowledge of pagans as gold and silver: something that can be involved in Christian purposes if appropriated properly. Donne, twisting this idea, is arguing that the {{death of an}}y individual is something others can learn from, should they understand it properly.|$|E
5|$|The {{skull of}} RAM 14000 is almost complete, {{with the left}} side only lacking {{a piece of the}} maxilla. However, the skull was split down the middle by erosion, {{possibly}} when it was resting on <b>the</b> <b>bottom</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> river bed. The two sides are displaced slightly, with some bones of the right being moved off the main block, also by erosion. After reconstruction, the skull viewed from the side resembles other juvenile lambeosaurines found, being roughly a trapezoid in shape.|$|E
