Despite not touring and receiving virtually no press or label interest in Canada and the USA, Annihilator {{has become one}} of the biggest selling Canadian Metal band of all-time, yet the majority of their sales have been generated from Asia and Europe. Most of Annihilator's discography is hard to find in the band's home country of Canada. Waters has been quoted as saying: [...] "I live a few blocks from the Ottawa Citizen newspaper. One day, a few years ago (2005) I contacted the Entertainment editor by email and introduced myself, gave him links <b>to</b> <b>our</b> <b>web</b> site and info, and asked if he might spare a few minutes to talk with me about the band, as I live a few minutes walking from his office. He told me to mail him a CD and he would consider reviewing it. He didn't. It actually made me a bit sad, as I have been waving the flag for Canadian metal and Canadian music for over 21 years abroad and also have sold more than any other metal band from this fine land. Yet I could not even get a review or interview with our nation's capital newspaper, when local artists with no deal and no CD releases, were actually getting full page or front page stories. The last thing I needed was coverage in Ottawa but I thought, out of principle, I should try. Shot down in flames! Ha!" ...|$|E

40|$|To combine {{social and}} {{content-based}} filtering techniques for image data, {{we have developed}} a new approach that uses clustering of images based on both content and social information. In this paper, we propose a visual interface that makes use of this clustering technique to explain the filtering results. The items in the database are laid out on a 2 dimensional map according to content-based similarity. A technique called "dynamic filtering" shows relationship between the items based on social similarity. The social and content-based clusters are visualized as landmarks on the map to enhance comprehensibility of the map. Visualization of both social and content-based spaces on a map combines their own advantages on information browsing: specialization of filtering results in the content-based space and serendipitous information discovery in the social space.
