5|$|After Reagan's {{military}} buildup, the Soviet Union did {{not respond}} by further building its military because the enormous military expenses, along with inefficient planned manufacturing and collectivized agriculture, were already a heavy burden for <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> <b>economy.</b> At the same time, Saudi Arabia increased oil production, even as other non-OPEC nations were increasing production. These developments contributed to the 1980s oil glut, which affected the Soviet Union, as oil was {{the main source of}} Soviet export revenues. Issues with command economics, oil price decreases and large military expenditures gradually brought <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> <b>economy</b> to stagnation.|$|E
5|$|During the Khrushchev era, {{especially}} from 1956 through 1962, the Soviet Union attempted to implement major wage reforms intended to move Soviet industrial workers {{away from the}} mindset of overfulfilling quotas that had characterised <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> <b>economy</b> during the preceding Stalinist period and toward a more efficient financial incentive.|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} the {{comparatively}} youthful Mikhail Gorbachev became General Secretary in 1985, <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> <b>economy</b> was stagnant and faced a sharp fall in foreign currency earnings {{as a result of}} the downward slide in oil prices in the 1980s.

5|$|In December 1981, Poland's Wojciech Jaruzelski {{reacted to}} the crisis by {{imposing}} a period of martial law. Reagan imposed economic sanctions on Poland in response.

5|$|Average wage {{rates in}} the Soviet Union were {{published}} relatively rarely. Some academics in the West believed this was because the Soviet government wanted to conceal low average earnings. Alec Nove wrote in 1966 (when wage statistics were published {{for the first time}} since the Second World War) that the lack of transparency surrounding average wages was intended to prevent Soviet workers from discovering the huge disparities that existed between wages in different sectors of <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> <b>economy.</b>|$|E
5|$|During 1928–1973, the Soviet Union {{was growing}} {{economically}} {{at a pace}} that would eventually catch up with the United States and Western Europe. This was true despite the advantage the United States had — the USSR was hampered by the effects of World War II, which had left most of Western USSR in ruins. In 1973, the process of catching up {{with the rest of the}} West came to an abrupt end, and 1973 was seen by some scholars as the start of the Era of Stagnation. The beginning of the stagnation coincided with a financial crisis in Western Europe and the U.S. By the early 1970s, the Soviet Union had the world's second largest industrial capacity, and produced more steel, oil, pig-iron, cement and tractors than any other country. Before 1973, <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> <b>economy</b> was expanding at faster rate than that of the American economy (albeit by a very small margin). The USSR also kept a steady pace with the economies of Western Europe. Between 1964 and 1973, <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> <b>economy</b> stood at roughly half the output per head of Western Europe and a little more than one third that of the U.S.|$|E

5|$|Ryzhkov {{was born}} in the city of Dzerzhynsk, Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic in 1929. After graduating in the 1950s he started work in the 1970s and began his {{political}} career in local industry, working his way up through the hierarchy of Soviet industrial ministries. In 1979 Ryzhkov was appointed First Deputy Chairman of the State Planning Committee. Following Nikolai Tikhonov's resignation as Chairman of the Council of Ministers, Ryzhkov was voted into office in his place. During his tenure, he supported Mikhail Gorbachev's 1980s reform of <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> <b>economy.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{political}} corruption which had grown considerably during Brezhnev's tenure {{had become a}} major problem to the Soviet Union's economic development by the 1980s. In response, Andropov initiated a nationwide anti-corruption campaign. Andropov believed that <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> <b>economy</b> could possibly recover if the government were able to increase social discipline amongst workers. Brezhnev was seen as very vain and self-obsessed, but was praised for leading the Soviet Union into an unprecedented age of stability and domestic calm.|$|E

Tikhonov began his political career in local industry, and worked his way up the hierarchy of Soviet industrial ministries. He was appointed deputy chairman of the Gosplan in 1963. After Alexei Kosygin's resignation Tikhonov was voted into office as Chairman of the Council of Ministers. In this position, he refrained from taking effective measures to reform <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> <b>economy,</b> a need which was strongly evidenced during the earlymid-1980s. He retired from active politics in 1989 as a pensioner. Tikhonov died on 1 June 1997.|$|E

5|$|The {{collective}} leadership {{first set}} out to stabilize the Soviet Union and calm Soviet society, a task which {{they were able to}} accomplish. In addition, they attempted to speed up economic growth, which had slowed considerably during Khrushchev's last years as ruler. In 1965, Kosygin initiated several reforms to decentralize <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> <b>economy.</b> After initial success in creating economic growth, hard-liners within the Party halted the reforms, fearing that they would weaken the Party's prestige and power. No other radical economic reforms were carried out during the Brezhnev era, and economic growth began to stagnate in the early-to-mid-1970s. By Brezhnev's death in 1982, Soviet economic growth had, according to several historians, nearly come to a standstill.|$|E
5|$|Trotsky and his {{supporters}} had been organised since 1923 as the Left Opposition. They opposed the bureaucratisation of the Soviet Union, which they analysed as being partly caused by the poverty and isolation of <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> <b>economy.</b> Stalin's theory of socialism in one country was developed in 1924 as an opposition to Trotsky's Theory of Permanent Revolution, which argued that capitalism was a world system and required a world revolution in order {{to replace it with}} socialism. Prior to 1924, the Bolsheviks' international perspective had been guided by Trotsky's position. Trotsky argued that Stalin's theory represented the interests of bureaucratic elements in direct opposition to the working class.|$|E
5|$|Until {{the early}} 1980s, the United States had {{relied on the}} {{qualitative}} superiority of its weapons to essentially frighten the Soviets, but the gap had been narrowed. Although the Soviet Union did not accelerate military spending after President Reagan's military buildup, their large military expenses, in combination with collectivized agriculture and inefficient planned manufacturing, were a heavy burden for <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> <b>economy.</b> At the same time, Saudi Arabia increased oil production, {{which resulted in a}} drop of oil prices in 1985 to one-third of the previous level; oil was the main source of Soviet export revenues. These factors contributed to a stagnant Soviet economy during Gorbachev's tenure.|$|E
40|$|This paper argues {{against using}} the forced savings concept to explain saving {{behavior}} of Soviet consumers. It discusses reasons for consumers {{in a traditional}} <b>Soviet</b> <b>economy</b> to save less {{than their counterparts in}} market economies at similar economic development stages. These reasons include low variability of life cycle income, large state subsidies to major consumption items, ability of retirees to compensate for low money income by acquiring goods at state-controlled prices through standing in queues, and limited choice of financial instruments. When transition to a market economy occurs or is expected to occur, consumers tend to increase their savings. The way to deal with <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> system's inefficiencies is to liberalize currently controlled prices and to implement other market reforms, which would result in lifting official restrictions on already existing market forces. Market reforms, in turn, will help achieve financial stability. <b>The</b> <b>Soviet</b> <b>economy's</b> problem is not excessive saving but rather the excessive role of the state.

50|$|In {{the later}} years of <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> Union, Mikhail Gorbachev relaxed {{restrictions}} {{on private property}} and introduced initial market reforms. Privatization shifted Russia from <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> planned <b>economy</b> towards a market economy, and resulted in a dramatic rise {{in the level of}} economic inequality and a collapse in GDP and industrial output.|$|R

5|$|When Nikolai Ryzhkov was {{replaced}} as premier by Valentin Pavlov, the Council of Ministers was dissolved {{and replaced by}} the Cabinet of Ministers, while the chairmanship {{was replaced}} by the office of Prime Minister of the Soviet Union. After the failed August Coup of 1991, and the revelation {{that the majority of the}} cabinet members supported the coup, the Cabinet of Ministers was dissolved and replaced by the Committee on the Operational Management of <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> <b>economy</b> in 1991. The Operational Management Committee was renamed the Inter-Republican Economic Committee, and was later replaced by the Interstate Economic Committee (IEC), the IEC was also officially known as the Economic Community.|$|E
5|$|A First Deputy Premier {{was usually}} given {{responsibility}} over one specific area. For example, Kirill Mazurov {{was responsible for}} industry, and Dmitry Polyansky was agriculture. However, after Polyansky's departure in 1973 Mazurov was left the sole First Deputy Premier until Tikhonov was appointed in 1976. An officeholder could also be responsible for coordinating the activities of ministries and state committees and other subordinate bodies of the Council of Ministers. To do this the First Deputy Premier had to give these bodies guidance in an expeditious manner to ensure the implementation of plans for {{economic and social development}} and to check if the orders and decisions of the Council of Ministers were being followed. If the Premier could not perform his duties one of the First Deputy Premiers would take on the role of acting Premier until the Premier's return. During the late 1970s, when the health of Premier Alexei Kosygin deteriorated, Nikolai Tikhonov, the First Deputy Premier, acted on his behalf during his absence. When Tikhonov took command of <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> <b>economy,</b> Kosygin served in a standby role. At a Central Committee plenum in June 1980, the Soviet economic development plan was outlined by Tikhonov, and not Kosygin.|$|E
5|$|Kosygin {{initiated}} the 1973 Soviet economic reform {{to enhance the}} powers and functions of the regional planners by establishing associations. The reform was never fully implemented; indeed, members of the Soviet leadership complained that the reform had not even begun {{by the time of}} the 1979 reform. The 1979 Soviet economic reform was initiated to improve the then-stagnating Soviet economy. The reform's goal was to increase the powers of the central ministries by centralising <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> <b>economy</b> to an even greater extent. This reform was also never fully implemented, and when Kosygin died in 1980 it was practically abandoned by his successor, Nikolai Tikhonov. Tikhonov told the Soviet people at the 26th Party Congress that the reform was to be implemented, or at least parts of it, during the Eleventh Five-Year Plan (1981–1985). Despite this, the reform never came to fruition. The reform is seen by several Sovietologists as the last major pre-perestroika reform initiative put forward by the Soviet government.|$|E

5|$|Tension between {{central and}} local {{government}} heightened in {{the final years of}} the Soviet Union's existence. On May 5, 1990, the New Armenian Army (NAA), a defense force envisioned to serve as a separate entity from the Soviet Union's military, was created. A celebration was planned for May 28, the anniversary of the creation of the first Armenian republic. However, on May 27 hostilities broke out between the NAA and the MVD troops based in Yerevan, resulting in the deaths of five Armenians in a shootout at the railway station. Witnesses claimed that the MVD had used an excessive amount of force in the firefight and insisted that it had instigated the fighting. Further firefights between Armenian militiamen and the MVD in nearby Sovetashen (now Nubarashen) resulted in the deaths of twenty-seven people and an indefinite cancellation of the May28 celebration. Armenia declared its sovereignty over Soviet laws on August 23, 1990. The reason Armenia's decision to break away from the Soviet Union largely stemmed from Moscow's intransigence on Karabakh, mishandling of the earthquake relief effort, and the shortcomings of <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> <b>economy.</b>|$|E
5|$|Though these {{measures}} were established to counter {{many of the}} irrationalities in the Soviet economic system, the reform {{did not try to}} change the existing system radically; it instead tried to improve it gradually. Success was ultimately mixed, and Soviet analyses on why the reform failed to reach its full potential have never given any definitive answers. The key factors are agreed upon, however, with blame being put on the combination of the recentralisation of the economy with the decentralisation of enterprise autonomy, creating several administrative obstacles. Additionally, instead of creating a market which in turn would establish a pricing system, administrators were given the responsibility for overhauling the pricing system themselves. Because of this, the market-like system failed to materialise. To make matters worse, the reform was contradictory at best. In retrospect, however, the Eighth Five-Year Plan as a whole is considered {{to be one of the}} most successful periods for <b>the</b> <b>Soviet</b> <b>economy,</b> and the most successful for consumer production.|$|E
