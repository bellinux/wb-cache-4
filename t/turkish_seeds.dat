40|$|Oil content, {{fatty acid}} {{composition}} {{and the distribution}} of vitamin-E-active compounds of selected <b>Turkish</b> <b>seeds</b> that are typically by-products of the food processing industries (linseed, apricot, pear, fennel, peanut, apple, cotton, quince and chufa), were determined. The oil content of the samples ranged from 16. 9 to 53. 4 g/ 100 g. The dominating fatty acids were oleic acid (apricot seed oil, peanut oil, and chufa seed oil) in the range of 52. 5 to 68. 4 g/ 100 g and linoleic acid (pear seed oil, apple seed oil, cottonseed oil and quince seed oil) with 48. 1 to 56. 3  g/ 100  g, while in linseed oil mainly α-linolenic acid (53. 2 g/ 100 g) and in fennel seed oil mainly 18 : 1 fatty acids (80. 5 g/ 100 g) with petroselinic acid predominating. The total content of vitamin-E-active compounds ranged from 20. 1 (fennel seed oil) to 96 mg/ 100 g (apple seed oil). The predominant isomers were established as α- and γ-tocopherol...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 1983 A {{comparative}} intraspecific karyotype {{analysis was}} performed on European black pine (Pinus nigra Am.) seed sources (countries) by examining root tip meristemic cells of young seedlings (two weeks old). By a combination of Feulgen and Aceto-carmine staining methods, metaphase chromosomes range (12. 93 ± 1. 33) seedlings from two to three seed collections each of French, Austrian, Yugoslavian, Greek and <b>Turkish</b> <b>seed</b> sources were studied. Variables including chromosome number, short arm length (SL), long arm length (LL), total chromosome length (TL), arm ratio (AR), relative chromosome length (RL), centromere index (CI), morphological index (MI), and secondary constriction and satellite occurrences for each cell were measured. The chromosome number was 2 n = 24 for all seed sources. However, aneuploidy 2 n = 18 was observed in one seedling {{of each of the}} Yugoslavian and Greek seed sources. Analyses of variances for the means of chromosonial variables (F-tests were conducted for the variables SL, LL, TL, CI and MI) indicated that there were significant (P <. 05 or P <. 01) differences among the seed sources. Chromosomes XI and XII were especially variable among seed sources, with significant (p <. 01) variation found for SL, LL, TL, AR, CI and MI. The frequency of secondary constriction occurrences was relatively higher on the long arms of chromosomes and on the longer chromosomes. At low frequency, satellite occurrences were only observed in the Yugoslavian and Greek seed sources, especially on their longer chromosomes. French and Austrian seed sources had only one submetacentric chromosome (chromosome-XII) while the others had two (chromosome-XI and XII). By integrating all the variables measured on all haploid chromosomes, a cluster analysis of the seed collections was performed. Seed sources from Austria and France appear clustered close together, as did Greece and Yugoslavia. The <b>Turkish</b> <b>seed</b> source, however, was the least similar to any of the other sources. Seed collections generally clustered within seed sources...|$|R

40|$|The main {{objectives}} of the project were: satisfy the increasing farmers' demand for higher quality seed and increase possibilities for seed export. These objectives needed the re-organization and strengthening of the <b>Turkish</b> <b>seed</b> registration and certification system. In accordance with the objectives, the major activities were staff training, supply of specific equipment and integration to the OECD seed scheme. Agricultural engineers from all Provincial Directorates of MARA, from the Regional Seed Testing and Certification Stations, from the Seed Certification and Test Directorate and from the Seed Registration and Certification Center were trained for field inspection (Distinctness, Uniformity and Stability; Value for Cultivation and Use; Post-Control; Plot Tests [...] .), seed registration, sampling, certification and electrophoresis techniques. Six international study tours and training courses were proposed and 15 participants took advantage of them; six national study tours and training courses were also organized, {{with a total of}} 126 participants. The project purchased equipment for the office (US$ 7, 000), the electrophoretic tests (US$ 35, 227) and field trials (US$ 20, 071). The <b>Turkish</b> <b>seed</b> registration and certification system did not meet OECD/EC requirements. Training in seed activities of the agricultural engineers, and the modification of the seed registration (DUS tests in conformity with OECD/EC requirements) and certification regulations allowed the integration of the Turkish system into the OECD/EC scheme. In past years, plant breeding, seed production and distribution were controlled by the state. At present, all these services are gradually transferred to the private sector, with the exception of varieties registration and seed control and certification. The private sector has begun producing quite large amounts of sunflower, maize, soya and sugarbeet seeds, and the amount of seed exported to EC countries is increasing. The private sector is quite capable of seed production following the national guidelines and rules, and also applying the OECD/EC standards and norms for exportation. In the future, field inspections will be {{an essential part of the}} system. The field inspectors must have the official descriptions of varieties available, and reference collections must be at disposal for training purpose. Work has already begun following the recommendations concerning the organization of the system. French-style organization is favoured, and a Turkish-French cooperation project is planned. This will give Turkey the possibility of working in harmony with Europe, and the control system will be more effective...|$|R
40|$|The {{samples of}} the hazelnut, peanut, pistachio, almond, walnut, chestnut, pumpkin seed and {{sunflower}} seed were collected from Turkey. The fatty acid compositions of <b>Turkish</b> nut and <b>seed</b> oils were analyzed by Gas Chromatography (GC) were determined. The antioxidant activity of the samples was assessed by 1, 1 -diphenyl- 2 -picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) radical scavenging capacity assay toward BHT and Vitamin C. Retinol and a -tocopherol were analyzed using High-Pressure Liquid Chromatography with UV Detector (HPLC-UV). The antimicrobial and antifungal activities of <b>Turkish</b> nut and <b>seeds</b> were evaluated using the disk diffusion method toward 9 bacteria and 5 yeasts. The nut and seeds showed strong antimicrobial activity against the test organisms. Spectroscopic determination of minerals (Calcium, magnesium, potassium, sodium, iron, copper, manganese, selenium, zinc, chromium, aluminum) of nuts and seeds was performed with inductively coupled plasma-atomic emission spectrometer (ICP-AES). The calorie values of samples were measured using a Bomb Calorimeter. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{occurrence}} of harmful aflatoxins from agricultural products varies with geographic location, farming practices and processing. To date, no data was reported from Saudi Arabia on mycotoxin content of nuts and edible seeds. Forty samples of edible nuts and dried seeds were randomly collected from different locations in Al-Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. Fungi were detected by seed-plate and dilutions plate method and were cultured on glucose-Czapek's agar, sucrose-Czapek's agar and starch yeast agar. Purified fungal isolates were identified morphologically. Mycotoxins were extractedusing chloroform and detected by thin layer chromatography. Bacterial analysis was done using {{total plate count}} method. There was a predominance of A. niger and A. flavus in all medium types. Aflatoxin B 1 (8. 5 µg mL - 1) was detected in peanuts containing A. flavus. Aflatoxin B 1 (1. 7 µg mL - 1) and B 2 (1. 7 µg mL - 1) was detected in sunflower seeds containing A. terreus. T 2 toxin (2. 8 mg mL - 1) was detected in pumpkinseeds containing Stachybotrys chartarum and DAS (2. 4 µg mL - 1) was detected in a salted peanut sample containing Trichthecium roseum. Four nut samples showed contamination with bacteria. <b>Turkish</b> pine <b>seeds</b> and American walnut had total plate counts of 12 x 10. Pakistani pine seeds and Iranian salted pistachio had TPC of 3 x 10. Listeria monocytogenes was isolated from American walnut samples.
