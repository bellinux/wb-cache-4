In this paper we study the limitations due to the finite size of the simulation volume.

Here, we extend the same analysis and estimate the effect on skewness and kurtosis in the perturbative regime. We also test the analytical predictions from the earlier work as well as those presented in this paper. We find good agreement between the analytical models and simulations for the two point correlation function and skewness. We also discuss the effect of a finite box size on relative velocity statistics and find the effects for these quantities scale in a manner that retains the dependence on the averaged correlation function.

40|$|SummaryObjectivesLeptospirosis is {{a serious}} {{neglected}} disease in the Pacific. Because sensitive and specific laboratory tests are largely unavailable, the burden of disease and epidemiological data are often unreliable and do not allow informed disease prioritization and efficient control. We report the use of serum spotted on filter paper to improve the surveillance of leptospirosis in remote and resource-limited settings. MethodsA total of 172 acute-phase serum samples collected from patients with suspected dengue at Yap State Hospital, Federated States of Micronesia, were spotted on filter paper and sent by regular mail to the Institut Louis Malardé, French Polynesia. Real-time PCR protocols for dengue and leptospirosis confirmation were performed on all specimens. ResultsA total of five leptospirosis infections were detected amongst the patients with suspected dengue. ConclusionsThis study confirms the use of filter paper as a convenient tool to improve leptospirosis surveillance capacity in remote areas.

40|$|N-Body {{simulations}} are a {{very important}} tool {{in the study of}} formation of large scale structures. Much of the progress in understanding the physics of high redshift universe and comparison with observations {{would not have been possible}} without N-Body simulations. Given the importance of <b>this</b> <b>tool,</b> it <b>is</b> <b>essential</b> to understand its limitations as ignoring the limitations can easily lead to interesting but unreliable results. In this paper we study the limitations arising out of the finite size of simulation volume. This finite size implies that modes larger than the size of the simulation volume are ignored and a truncated power spectrum is simulated. If the simulation volume is large enough then the mass in collapsed haloes expected from the full power spectrum and from the truncated power spectrum should match. We propose a quantitative measure based on this approach that allows us to compute the minimum box size for an N-Body simulation. We find that the required box size for simulations of LCDM model at high redshifts is much larger than is typically used. We can also use this approach to quantify the effect of perturbations at large scales for power law models and we find that if we fix the scale of non-linearity, the required box size becomes very large as the index becomes small. The appropriate box size computed using this approach is also an appropriate choice for the transition scale when tools like MAP (Tormen and Bertschinger, 1996) that add the contribution of the missing power are used.

Much of the progress in understanding the physics of galaxy formation and comparison with observations {{would not have been possible}} without N-Body simulations. Given the importance of <b>this</b> <b>tool,</b> it <b>is</b> <b>essential</b> to understand its limitations as ignoring these can easily lead to interesting but unreliable results. In this paper we study the limitations due to the finite size of the simulation volume. We explicitly construct the correction term arising due to a finite box size and study its generic features for clustering of matter and also on mass functions. We show that the correction to mass function is maximum near the scale of non-linearity, as a corollary we show that the correction to the number density of haloes of a given mass changes sign at this scale; the number of haloes at small masses is over estimated in simulations. This over estimate results from a delay in mergers that lead to formation of more massive haloes. The same technique can be used to study corrections to other physical quantities. The corrections are typically small if the scale of non-linearity is much smaller than the box-size. However, there are some cases of physical interest in which the relative correction term is of order unity even though a simulation box much larger than the scale of non-linearity is used. Within the context of the concordance model, our analysis suggests that it is very difficult for present day simulations to resolve mass scales smaller than 10 2 M ⊙ accurately and the level of difficulty increases as we go to even smaller masses, though this constraint does not apply to multi-scale simulations...|$|R
40|$|Supplementary feeding {{is one of}} {{the most}} common {{techniques}} used to alleviate threats to scavengers species related to the quality and availability of food resources. Because supplementary feeding may have undesired effects, the management of supplementary sites should be optimized from an ecological and conservation perspective. We installed high-resolution videocameras at six Spanish feeding stations recording more that 7500 h of observations at 105 feeding events. We analyzed food preferences in the four European vulture species (Eurasian griffon vulture Gyps fulvus, Egyptian vulture Neophron percnopterus, bearded vulture Gypaetus barbatus and cinereous vulture Aegypius monachus) as they relate to the characteristics of the food remains and carcasses provided at feeding sites. Our results suggest that carrion features (format, scattering, prey species, biomass and items) influence differential selection between species and age-classes. At a species level, large inputs of unscattered carrion increased the abundance of actively feeding griffon vultures. The ratio of the abundance of bearded vultures, Egyptian vultures and cinereous vultures with respect to griffon vultures was favored when less biomass was supplied and when the food provided was not presented as whole carcasses. Thus, using medium-size ungulates (i. e. sheep and goats) presented as small, abundant and scattered pieces favors the consumption of the resource by the most endangered species. Our findings can be used to optimize the supplementary provisioning of vultures in cases where <b>this</b> conservation <b>tool</b> <b>is</b> considered <b>essential</b> for managing targeted species or population groups...|$|R

40|$|Introduction: Persistent microalbuminuria is the {{earliest}} indicator of {{chronic kidney disease}} (CKD) in patients with diabetes and hypertension. Patients with microalbuminuria have high risk for target organ damage resulting in stroke, retinopathy and adverse CV events. Objective: To determine the prevalence of Microalbuminuria among hypertensive patients at Muhimbili Hospital – Dar es Salaam. Methodology: This was a cross-sectional descriptive epidemiological study which comprised of a sample size of 341 hypertensives (mean age of 53. 1 years with SD ± 1. 58) from August 2012 to January 2013. Data was collected using a structured questionnaire. Variables that were entered in the equation were duration of diabetes mellitus (DM), type of DM, history of smoking, history of alcohol drinking and duration of drinking and BMI. In all participants urine albuminuria was measured in spot urine sample using initially urine dipstick, and if normoalbuminuria on dipstick, urine samples were further tested for microalbuminuria using microalbumin 2 - 1 combo strips to assess the albumin creatinine ratio. Other laboratory blood tests included lipid profile and random blood glucose measurements Results: The prevalence of microalbuminuria in hypertensives attending the Cardiac clinic at Muhimbili National Hospital {{was found to be}} 24 % within the study group. The prevalence of microalbuminuria in males and females were found to be 27. 4 % and 21. 6 % respectively. The prevalence of microalbuminuria was noted to be higher among males but was not statistically different (p= 0. 421). Age group of greater than 61 years comprised of 24. 5 % of the microalbuminurics among the different age groups with the mean age of 53. 1 years with SD± 1. 586, but statistically, no significant difference was seen. p= 0. 518. Cigarette smoking, alcohol consumption, BMI or lipid levels were statistically not associated with the occurrence of microalbuminuria among hypertensive patients. Conclusion: This study showed that the prevalence of microalbuminuria was 24 % among hypertensive patients seen at the cardiac clinic at the MNH. When any form of albuminuria was considered the prevalence was almost 100 %. Almost all patients seen in this study had a form of proteinuria, either macro or micro which showed that majority of patients has already progressed to some form of albuminuria. This suggests that microalbuminuria screening should be aggressively used as a screening tool to pick up early evidences of microalbuminuria in hypertensive patients. There were no statistically significantly factors associated with the occurrence of microalbuminuria among the hypertensive patients Recommendations: Microalbuminuria is regarded as {{the earliest}} marker of capillary endothelial damage and therefore an important predictor of capillary injury in hypertensive patients; hence vigorous screening of <b>this</b> relatively inexpensive <b>tool</b> <b>is</b> <b>essential</b> which <b>is</b> underperformed at our centre. It is hence important that in every hypertensive patient, this inexpensive test for urine albumin be measures routinely at every outpatient clinic at Muhimbili Hosp so as to detected early those at an in increased risk of vascular and cardiac morbidity and mortality and appropriate measures for its prevention or delay taken early...|$|R
