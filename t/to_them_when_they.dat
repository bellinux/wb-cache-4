The fur has two layers, which helps {{protect them from the}} cold water. They have long tails covered with scales rather than hair, and to aid them in swimming, are {{slightly}} flattened vertically, which is a shape that is unique <b>to</b> <b>them.</b> <b>When</b> <b>they</b> walk on land, their tails drag on the ground, which makes their tracks easy to recognize.|$|E

25|$|Vadstena Abbey {{also had}} {{international}} fame as the motherhouse {{of all the}} monasteries of the Bridgettine Order, such as Reval, Nådendal, Bergen and Danzig. It kept in contact with other monasteries, performed inspections of them and sent both nuns and monks <b>to</b> <b>them</b> <b>when</b> <b>they</b> were lacking in members. In 1406, for example, an English delegation arrived asking for members {{in order to establish}} a Bridgettine monastery in England, and in 1415, four nuns, three female novices, one monk and one priest left the abbey under great celebrations for the foundation of what became the famed Syon Abbey.|$|E
25|$|Recently emerged {{individual}} young wasps {{have black}} or brown eyes, while older individuals have pink eyes and grow wings to fly. When workers are first born, they often huddle {{together in a}} corner to avoid aggressive acts from other workers. Workers do not perform dominance actions until they are around 17 days old. Also, the emerging young B. petiolata body sizes increase from January through March, which {{is the end of}} adult emergence. Since worker production extends until the end of January, workers arising this month were bigger in size than those born in the earlier part of the season, around November and December. Variations in reproductive capacity and body size of the female young are due to changes in the amount of food given <b>to</b> <b>them</b> <b>when</b> <b>they</b> were larvae.|$|E

25|$|When the Cuman-Kipchaks swore oaths it {{was done}} with swords in the hands that touched {{the body of a}} dog cut in two. The Italian Franciscan monk, traveler, and {{historian}}, John of Plano Carpini, says that when the Hungarian prince married the Cuman princess, ten Cumans swore over a dog cut in half with a sword that they would defend the Kingdom of Hungary. The Christian writer and historian of the crusades, Jean de Joinville (c. 1224–c. 1317), mentions that when the Cumans and Byzantines made an alliance, the Cumans made a dog pass between both sides and cut it with a sword, obliging the Byzantines to do the same; the Cumans said that both they and the Byzantines should be cut in pieces if they failed each other. Joinville described a Cuman noble's funeral: he was buried seated on a chair whilst his best horse and best sergeant were placed beside him alive. Prior to this the sergeant was given a large sum of money by the Cuman leaders for the purpose of handing it back <b>to</b> <b>them</b> <b>when</b> <b>they</b> too would come into the afterlife. The Cuman khan also gave a letter of recommendation to the sergeant, which was addressed to the first king of the Cumans, in which the present king testified to the sergeant's good character. After these proceedings a huge mound was raised above the tomb. Cumans were buried in their warrior outfits. Wolves were greatly respected by the Cuman-Kipchaks, and they would sometimes howl along with them in commune. The personal bodyguard of the khan were called Bori (wolf in Turkic). Like other nomadic nations, the Cuman-Kipchaks initiated blood bonds (with the purpose of symbolically cementing a bond) by the drinking or mixing of each other's blood.|$|E

500|$|The {{month after}} the plan took effect, the Canadian {{government}} announced that the country's sex industry {{would no longer be}} allowed to employ foreign workers because of the risks of exploitation, abuse, and trafficking in that environment. As part of this policy, the Department of Citizenship and Immigration Canada stopped issuing new temporary work permits for foreigners seeking work with escort agencies, massage parlours, and strip clubs. Jason Kenney, Minister of Citizenship and Immigration, said that he hoped that the NAP-CHT would be strengthened by this new policy, and said that its purpose was to protect foreigners [...] "from what they might not know will happen <b>to</b> <b>them</b> <b>when</b> <b>they</b> get to Canada." [...] That November, Status of Women Canada sought to support the NAP-CHT by soliciting the public for proposals of how to best support community organizations that serve female victims of sex traffickingthe most common victims of this form of trafficking. In late 2012, Smith launched the Joy Smith Foundation as a follow-up to the NAP-CHT; this nonpartisan, apolitical foundation is dedicated to raising awareness about human trafficking and providing support to human trafficking victims with counselling, housing, and clothing.|$|E

The 66-year-old scorer had toured with the MCC since 1907–08 and devised the famous Ferguson Charts which gave greater detail than other scorecards, noting each ball bowled by from which bowler to which batsman. He also invented the radial scoring chart which shows the directions in which a batsman scored his runs.|$|E

[...] The fact that Hasan had [...] "certain communications" [...] with the subject of a Joint Terrorism Task Force investigation was revealed in an FBI press release made on November 9, 2009, and reporting by the media immediately revealed that the subject was Awlaki and the communications were e-mails.

They came to make peace, {{at the request of the}} Danish Kings, whose brother they intended to return. When an equal number -they were sixteen- of Danish magnates met them at the stipulated place, peace was sworn by mutual oaths and the brother of the kings was returned. The Kings themselves at this time were not at home but had marched with an army toward Westarfolda, an area in the extreme northwest of their kingdom across the northern tip of Britain, whose princes and people refused to submit <b>to</b> <b>them.</b> <b>When</b> <b>they</b> returned after conquering the Britons and received their brother, who had been sent from the emperor, the sons of king Godofrid were assisted by not a few of the Danish nobles who for some time after leaving their homeland had been in exile with the Swedes. Since hosts of their countrymen joined the sons of Godofrid from all over the land of the Danes, they easily drove the kings from the kingdom after a battle".|$|E
