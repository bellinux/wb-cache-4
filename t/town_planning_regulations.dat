After a long period of planning, which was suited for the use of automobiles, nowadays the deficiencies both in the urban structure and social sphere are very obvious. Modern planning is striving to prescribe guidelines for urban design and thus create a continuity of cityscape and emphasize the pedestrian character of the area, particularly in central city zones.

40|$|The most {{challenging}} processes {{to be investigated}} further which are occurring in residential areas, suburbs in the largest Belarusian cities have been determined and systematized in the paper. The paper considers modern processes of transformation and development of residential areas on the studied territories; ongoing changes in the typology of dwellings and inhabitant composition of the suburban zones; problems pertaining to infrastructure development of suburban territories; preservation and improvement of recreational and ecological functions of the suburban zones in the largest cities. The paper presents a hypothesis on the possibility to modernize an urbanized region while using digital technologies and it also provides architectural and artistic characteristics of the residential environment. The main research methods are the following: field surveys; analysis of statistical data, project and regulatory documentation. So it has been revealed {{that it is necessary}} to carry out a detailed study of inhabitant composition in the settlements in order to determine their actual requirements in schools, kindergartens, and other facilities of public services. Development of <b>town</b> <b>planning</b> <b>regulations</b> taking into account actual typology of residential buildings and inhabitant composition is required for organization of suburban areas in the largest Belarusian cities. Current transformation processes of traditional settlement in the suburban zones of large cities are in need to have new requirements to their infrastructure development. It is necessary to improve a monitoring system and respond to population requirements and emerging problems. Nowadays there are conditions for formation of active population communities on the suburban territories. It is necessary to execute a coordinated development of all forms and types of suburban zones in the largest cities. The paper recommends to form, develop and preserve landscape and recreational areas in order to ensure an efficient recreational and ecological functions of the suburban zones. </p...|$|E

40|$|Ideas about green {{cities have}} been around for centuries, however it seems that these ideas have been sidetracked by a strange mixture of opposites: neoclassical {{economics}} and <b>town</b> <b>planning</b> <b>regulations.</b> On the one hand contemporary economics has divorced itself from ecology and on the other, town planning regulation, originally based on garden city ideas, has helped to facilitate cities where 'nature' is idealised, 'packaged and confined to parks and gardens. This paper suggests {{there needs to be a}} creative tension between the economic and ecological dimensions if a city is to emerge. If a vision for Greener City is going to be realised then we need to place this quest within the historical context of those who have struggled with this tension, from writers such as Morris, Ruskin, Howard, Geddes, Mumford, Jacobs, Schneider and McHarg. This lineage has attempted to resolve the contradictions of the industrial city- how to be human and green- or the need for an 'organic" process that sees nature and the city as indivisible. But it seems the modern city (ecosystem), particularly those based on the sprawl based model of Los Angeles, are neither human nor green, and seem to be heading towards collapse ecologically, economically and socially. The contemporary urban ecology movement, which is now a dominant feature of present urban discussions around the world (at both a professional and activist level) is part of this historical lineage in trying to resolve these issues, but now the stakes are much higher. Thus it is important to examine our attitudes to the city and how they are influenced by urban philosophers such as those listed above. But often we have been influenced by anti-urban writers who leading urban greening programs that become tokenistic and excuses for people to try and hide urban problems rather than solve them, eg urban sprawl, traffic and waste water. In this paper we will then show how the tension in these traditions has influenced urban form and the potential for greening, before providing some insights from contemporary physics, ecological economics and ecological design as a basis for the way forward...|$|E

30|$|The poor {{road network}} {{and the absence of}} proper {{drainage}} facilities account for the poor harmony in rain water collection and the high level of flooding that the city registers in the rainy season. The municipality must make efforts towards infrastructural provision especially with regards to roads, gutters, and drains in Mabeta, New Town, Motowo, and Church Street and implement clean up campaigns to ensure that these structures are cleaned up and maintained on a regular basis. The indiscriminate building of houses in violation of <b>town</b> <b>planning</b> rules and <b>regulations</b> must be checked. Those built too close to the Jenguele River must be demolished and no more houses should be built along floodplains or hillslopes with landslide histories, especially on the Mabeta hills. Neither should any other type of landed property be located in disaster-prone areas. The invasion and occupation of vacant risky sites should be stopped; streams such as the Jenguele should be maintained and their channels kept wide enough to facilitate the quick evacuation of run-off waters through monthly clean-up campaigns. Projects for the upgrading of occupied floodplains and corresponding resettlement schemes should be prepared. Those that were started in 2001 in Bonadikombo should be completed and resettlement carried out there.|$|R
