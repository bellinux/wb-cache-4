2500|$|After emancipation, Wright’s mother {{moved with}} her son from Dalton to Cuthbert, Georgia. He {{attended}} the Storrs School. The school had a reputation among freedmen as a place for their children to be educated. While visiting the school, retired Union General Oliver Otis Howard asked what message he should take to the North. The young Wright reportedly told him, [...] "Sir, <b>tell</b> <b>them</b> <b>we</b> are rising." [...] That exchange inspired a once-famous poem by John Greenleaf Whittier.|$|E
2500|$|One of Richard Jr's {{daughter}}s, Dr. Ruth Wright Hayre, {{also earned}} a Ph.D. at the University of Pennsylvania. They {{were the first}} African-American father and daughter to do so. Dr. Ruth Wright Hayre became the first full-time African-American teacher in the Philadelphia public-school system. She served as a senior high-school principal and as the first female president of the Philadelphia Board of Education. At the age of 80, she established the [...] "Tell Them We Are Rising" [...] program, promising to pay college tuition for 116 sixth-graders in two poor North Philadelphia schools if they completed high school. Her story was chronicled in her book <b>Tell</b> <b>Them</b> <b>We</b> Are Rising: A Memoir of Faith in Education, published in 1997, the year before she died.|$|E
6000|$|Cheyne smiled grimly at the consternation of {{his enemies}} when the telegrams were laid before him. [...] "They think we're on the war-path. <b>Tell</b> <b>'em</b> <b>we</b> don't feel like {{fighting}} just now, Milsom. <b>Tell</b> <b>'em</b> what we're going for. I guess you and Miss Kinzey had better come along, though it isn't likely I shall do any {{business on the}} road. <b>Tell</b> <b>'em</b> the truth--for once." ...|$|R

2500|$|The witness {{tampering}} {{charges were}} based on text messages Ravi sent to Wei, in which he tried to persuade her not to contradict what he had told police. In these messages, Ravi said [...] "Did you <b>tell</b> <b>them</b> <b>we</b> did it on purpose?", and [...] "Because I said we were just messing around with the camera." [...] Wei responded [...] "Omg dharun why didnt u talk to me first i told them everything". According to a prosecution expert witness, Ravi deleted almost 100 text messages between him and Wei and another high school friend, whom he had invited to view Clementi's second encounter with his guest. A key aspect of the prosecution's evidence tampering charge was Ravi's deletion of two potentially incriminating postings: one on Twitter on September 19 in which he wrote that his roommate was [...] "making out with a dude. Yay", and one on September 21 in which he told his iChat followers [...] "dare you to video chat me" [...] {{during the time of}} Clementi's tryst. He replaced the latter post with one that said [...] "don't you dare video chat me" [...] {{at the time of the}} tryst, stating that the first message was a draft. Ravi was charged with third and fourth degree invasion of privacy.|$|E

5000|$|He then further {{elaborated}} by saying, “I {{went for}} a curry with the CEO of Sega in Japan and Europe and he made me an offer on a napkin, I kept <b>telling</b> <b>them</b> <b>we</b> were not for sale. I told them {{they would have to}} double the offer for me to even discuss it with Paul and Oliver Collyer.” ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Better, but sore enough t' {{let me know}} dis ain't no dream," [...] {{returned}} the younger lad. [...] "Say!" [...] he exploded abruptly.

5000|$|In Greece, {{the series}} has become quite popular. It {{has become so}} popular that Bishop Anthimos of Thessaloniki and the Golden Dawn party {{condemned}} the show and urged Greeks not to watch it. [...] "No one should watch Muhteşem Yüzyıl, The Magnificent Century," [...] Anthimos said.

[...] "Is {{this language}} {{to a free}} and noble maiden?--Sweet lady, give me once but the least hint that you wish it, and their 'must go' shall {{be put to the}} trial.

6000|$|But {{the captain}} shook his head. [...] "It {{would be a}} {{dangerous}} thing," [...] he said, [...] "to put into any port {{on the west coast}} of South America with our present cargo on board.

60|$|Our weary, doomed {{drifting}} went on. The little settlements, wherever {{water and}} soil permitted, were from twenty to fifty miles apart. Between stretched the barrenness {{of sand and}} alkali and drought. And at every settlement our peaceful attempts to buy food were vain. They denied us harshly, {{and wanted to know}} who of us had sold them food when we drove them from Missouri. It was useless on our part to <b>tell</b> <b>them</b> <b>we</b> were from Arkansas. From Arkansas we truly were, but they insisted on our being Missourians.|$|E
60|$|I smile even at {{this late}} day when I think of what a simple I showed myself to be while setting about the task, for on {{summoning}} my comrades I was ashamed to <b>tell</b> <b>them</b> <b>we</b> were to work like drovers and farmers rather than as soldiers, therefore led each to understand we were bent on some secret mission to an island near by. And when one and another speculated as to the possible danger to be encountered, or of the opportunities of showing ourselves worthy to be called soldiers, I nursed such fancies until they believed we were going as an independent company to slaughter or to capture whole squads of trained, red-coated soldiers.|$|E

6000|$|... "I {{wonder what}} the Pooles will do when Mr. Basswood <b>tells</b> <b>them</b> what <b>we</b> think, that it is Mr. Wilbur Poole," [...] came from Dave. [...] "Perhaps they will send some of the sanitarium {{authorities}} up to try to catch him." ...|$|R
