5|$|When Joey and Chandler (Matt LeBlanc and Matthew Perry) {{correctly}} {{identify the}} contents of Rachel's (Jennifer Aniston) shopping bag, Monica (Courteney Cox) suggests a trivia contest to see who knows more about whom: the men or the women. They place a $100 bet on the outcome and Ross (David Schwimmer) puts together some questions and plays as host. Meanwhile, Phoebe (Lisa Kudrow) has agreed to be a surrogate mother for her brother Frank (Giovanni Ribisi) and his older wife Alice (Debra Jo Rupp), but is concerned that <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>paying</b> $16,000 for the IVF procedure which only has a 25% chance of success, and is helpless to influence the results.|$|E
25|$|In many countries, {{it is not}} {{feasible}} for banks to lend at fixed rates for very long terms; in these cases, the only feasible type of mortgage for banks to offer may be adjustable rate mortgages (barring some form of government intervention). For example, the mortgage industry of the United Kingdom has traditionally been dominated by building societies. Since funds raised by UK building societies {{must be at least}} 50% deposits, lenders prefer variable-rate mortgages to fixed-rate mortgages to reduce potential interest rate risks between what they charging in mortgage interest and what <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>paying</b> in interest for deposits and other funding sources.|$|E
25|$|Economist Paul McCulley {{described}} how Minsky's hypothesis translates to the subprime mortgage crisis. McCulley illustrated {{the three types}} of borrowing categories using an analogy from the mortgage market: a hedge borrower would have a traditional mortgage loan and is paying back both the principal and interest; the speculative borrower would have an interest-only loan, meaning <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>paying</b> back only the interest and must refinance later to pay back the principal; and the ponzi borrower would have a negative amortization loan, meaning the payments do not cover the interest amount and the principal is actually increasing. Lenders only provided funds to ponzi borrowers due to a belief that housing values would continue to increase.|$|E

25|$|Most service {{stations}} allow the customer to pump the fuel before paying; {{this is particularly}} {{the case in the}} smaller towns and cities in New Zealand. In recent years some {{service stations}} have required customers to purchase their fuel first. It is quite common for customers to hand the cash to the attendant on the forecourt if <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>paying</b> for a set amount of fuel and have no change. Some supermarkets have their own forecourts which are unmanned and payment is pay at the pump only. Customers at the supermarket will receive a discount voucher which offers discounted fuel at their forecourt. The amount of discount varies depending on the amount spent on groceries at the supermarket, but normally starts at 4 cents a liter.|$|E
25|$|Opponents of VSU {{note that}} not all {{economic}} benefits are maximised individually (i.e., there are beneficial externalities). For example, student unions have frequently subsidised food outlets on campus, arguing that people get utility from bars crowded with fun-seeking university students – an environment that might {{not exist in the}} absence of subsidy. Proponents respond that students who don't make use of the crowded outlet are paying for others' food and drink. Another more serious example relates to advocacy provided by students associations. Many students face difficult personal and financial problems whilst studying. Advocacy services are not used by 100% of students, yet all students pay for the service to be available. Some students argue that <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>paying</b> for other students to use the advocacy service even though they have not needed to use it.|$|E
25|$|Raising {{the price}} of carbon will achieve four goals. First, it will provide signals to {{consumers}} about what goods and services are high-carbon ones and should therefore be used more sparingly. Second, it will provide signals to producers about which inputs use more carbon (such as coal and oil) and which use less or none (such as natural gas or nuclear power), thereby inducing firms to substitute low-carbon inputs. Third, it will give market incentives for inventors and innovators to develop and introduce low-carbon products and processes that can replace {{the current generation of}} technologies. Fourth, and most important, a high carbon price will economize on the information that is required to do all three of these tasks. Through the market mechanism, a high carbon price will raise {{the price of}} products according to their carbon content. Ethical consumers today, hoping to minimize their “carbon footprint,” have little chance of making an accurate calculation of the relative carbon use in, say, driving 250 miles as compared with flying 250 miles. A harmonized carbon tax would raise the price of a good proportionately to exactly the amount of CO2 that is emitted in all the stages of production that are involved in producing that good. If 0.01 of a ton of carbon emissions results from the wheat growing and the milling and the trucking and the baking of a loaf of bread, then a tax of $30 per ton carbon will raise the price of bread by $0.30. The “carbon footprint” is automatically calculated by the price system. Consumers would still not know how much of the price is due to carbon emissions, but they could make their decisions confident that <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>paying</b> for the social cost of their carbon footprint.|$|E

500|$|In many {{neurolinguistics}} experiments, subjects do {{not simply}} sit {{and listen to}} or watch stimuli, but also are instructed to perform some sort of task {{in response to the}} stimuli. [...] Subjects perform these tasks while recordings (electrophysiological or hemodynamic) are being taken, usually {{in order to ensure that}} <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>paying</b> attention to the stimuli. At least one study has suggested that the task the subject does has an effect on the brain responses and the results of the experiment.|$|E
500|$|The {{arguments}} for light rail were mainly {{related to the}} environment, urban development and reduction in road congestion. Light rail is estimated to increase {{the use of public}} transport from Fana, reducing both local and global pollution. The roads do not have capacity for further growth, and any increase in public transport would need to be taken along the light rail routes on buses—this would give higher operating costs for public transport or higher investment costs for roads. Around the stations, high-density commercial and residential centers can be established. Opponents of the project argued that it is unfair that public transport be funded by car drivers through toll roads. Protests from people in northern and western areas of the city have risen, since <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>paying</b> for the system but will not receive the benefits. Another issue has been speed: the line to Nesttun has 15 stops in , giving an average speed of [...] For people living south of Nesttun, this will give a longer travel time to the city center than with direct buses that do not make intermediate stops.|$|E

In 2004 over 70% of African American smokers preferred menthol cigarettes, compared with 30% of white smokers. This unique social phenomenon was principally occasioned by the tobacco industry's manipulation of the burgeoning black, urban, segregated, consumer market in cities at that time.

2500|$|Germany's DEAL project which {{includes}} over 60 major research institutions, including Göttingen University, {{has announced that}} all of its members are cancelling their contracts with Elsevier, effective January 1, 2017.

2500|$|An {{art model}} poses for any visual artist {{as part of}} the {{creative}} process, providing a visual reference for the human figure in a work of art. However, more than being simply the subject of art, models are often thought of as muses, a source of inspiration without whom the art would not exist. The most common types of art works that use models are figure drawing, figure painting, sculpture and photography, but almost any medium may be used. Art models are often paid professionals with skill and experience but are rarely employed full-time, and artists may also rely on friends and family to pose. Paid art models are usually anonymous and unacknowledged subjects of the work. Models are most frequently employed for art classes or by informal groups of artists that gather to share the expense of a model. Models are also employed privately by professional artists. [...] Although commercial motives dominate over aesthetics in illustration, its artwork commonly employs models. For example, Norman Rockwell used his friends and neighbors as models for both his commercial and fine art work. An individual who is having their own portrait painted or sculpted is usually called a [...] "sitter" [...] rather than a model, since <b>they</b> <b>are</b> <b>paying</b> to have the work done rather than being paid to pose.|$|E
