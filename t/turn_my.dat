500|$|While Vitalogy {{had shifted}} away from the earlier albums' {{accessible}} compositions and polished production, No Code represented a deliberate break from Tens stadium sound, favoring experimental ballads and noisy garage rock songs.

Irons lends a tribal drum sound on the songs [...] "Who You Are" [...] and [...] "In My Tree".
