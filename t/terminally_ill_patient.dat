40|$|Background: Continuity of care {{is one of}} {{the core}} values of good medical care for <b>terminally</b> <b>ill</b> <b>patients.</b> The {{availability}} of one's own general practitioner (GP) out of hours is regarded as important for personal continuity. Few data are available about the extent of out-of-hours care given by GPs to their <b>terminally</b> <b>ill</b> <b>patients.</b> Aim: The objective {{of this study was to}} determine to which level GPs are available out of hours for their own <b>terminally</b> <b>ill</b> <b>patients</b> and to elicit what factors are relevant to this availability. Design and setting: The research questions were investigated using a cross-sectional study of Dutch GPs. A questionnaire was sent to a random sample of 691 Dutch GPs. Results: The response rate was 47 % (n = 327). Of the respondents, 86 % was willing to provide out-of-hours care for their own <b>terminally</b> <b>ill</b> <b>patients.</b> These figures are higher than reported in previous studies. This study shows that out-of-hours availability correlates most strongly with the GPs' perception of duties of care. Availability is negatively influenced if the GP is in a salaried job, if he or she works in a city based practice, or if home is far from the practice. A correlation between age, sex, and experience of GPs and availability for out-of-hours care for their <b>terminally</b> <b>ill</b> <b>patients</b> was not confirmed. Conclusions: The reported out-of-hours availability of GPs for <b>terminally</b> <b>ill</b> <b>patients</b> is still high. GPs' perception of their duty of care might change in the next generations, and the increasing number of salaried GPs, living far from their practice, might threaten out-of-hours availability for <b>terminally</b> <b>ill</b> <b>patients.</b> GPs' perception of their duty of care might change in the next generations, and the increasing number of salaried GPs living far from their practice might threaten out-of-hours availability for <b>terminally</b> <b>ill</b> <b>patients...</b>|$|R

2500|$|The leading Defence counsel Sir Frederick Geoffrey Lawrence, QC, {{had been}} briefed by the Medical Defence Union with the {{additional}} task of obtaining a ruling on whether medical treatments that might shorten {{the life of a}} <b>terminally</b> <b>ill</b> <b>patient</b> were legal. Lawrence, a [...] "specialist in real estate and divorce cases [...] a relative stranger in criminal court", who was defending his first murder trial, convinced the jury that {{there was no evidence that}} a murder had been committed, much less that a murder had been committed by Adams. He emphasised that the indictment was based mainly on testimonies from the nurses who tended Morrell – and that none of the witnesses' evidence matched the others'. Then, on the second day of the trial, he produced notebooks written by the nurses, detailing Adams' treatment of Morrell. The prosecution claimed never to have seen these notebooks (even though they are recorded in pretrial lists of evidence). These differed from the nurses' recollection of events, and showed that smaller quantities of drugs were given to the patient than the prosecution had thought, based on Adams' prescriptions. Furthermore, the prosecution's two expert medical witnesses gave differing opinions: Arthur Douthwaite was prepared to say that murder had definitely been committed (though he changed his mind in the middle of his testimony regarding the exact date), but Michael Ashby was more reticent. The defence witness and physician John Harman was adamant that Adams's treatment, though unusual, was not reckless. Finally, the prosecution was wrong-footed by the defence not calling the loquacious Adams to give evidence, and thereby avoiding him [...] "chatting himself to the gallows". This was unexpected, shocking the prosecution and the press, and even surprising the judge.|$|E

40|$|Individuals are {{increasingly}} looking to spiritual traditions and philosophies for guidance, and comfort. Spirituality {{is a fundamental}} and potentially significant element of dying (Reed, 1987). There {{is a need to}} understand the human experience associated with terminal illness and dying. Nurses put a priority on physical and psychological needs due to the patients' condition and may not address spiritual needs. It is important to know how <b>terminally</b> <b>ill</b> <b>patients</b> perceive spirituality, and whether spiritual needs are met. The purpose of this descriptive study is to identify perceptions of spiritual needs of <b>terminally</b> <b>ill</b> <b>patients</b> and to determine if those needs are being met. This is a replication study of Reed's (1987) study on spirituality and <b>terminally</b> <b>ill</b> <b>patients.</b> The Framework of Systemic Organization (Friedemann, 1995) provides rational for the study.

Background <b>Terminally</b> <b>ill</b> <b>patients</b> can experience many concerns. These concerns can affect the choices these patients make in their life and illnesses and it can affect {{the overall quality of}} life. Therefore it is necessary to gain insight in these concerns. Aim and research questions The propose of this research was to gain insight in the concerns that <b>terminally</b> <b>ill</b> <b>patients</b> experience. This description can possibly provide a lead for caretakers, so they can anticipate and open the discussion on these concerns with patients and other caretakers. The research question was: Which concerns experience <b>terminally</b> <b>ill</b> <b>patients</b> and how do patients deal with these concerns? Method A qualitative descriptive design was used. To collect data 11 semi structured interviews were held. The study population were <b>terminally</b> <b>ill</b> hospice <b>patients.</b> Data was analyzed by using open, selective and axial coding. Results The concerns that respondents experienced were described in theme`s: don`t want to be a burden on others, physical limitations of the illness, dying itself, legacy for family and friends and the world, staying in control over their own life, significance of death for themselves and others. The way patients cope with their concerns is divers. The respondents seem to search for a way of coping that fits their own concerns and situation best. Conclusion It seems that the concerns that <b>terminally</b> <b>ill</b> <b>patients</b> experience are very divers. And many different factors seem to have influence on these concerns. How patients cope with their concerns is individually determined. Recommendations It is recommended to set up a larger qualitative study at the concerns of <b>terminally</b> <b>ill</b> <b>patients.</b> With this study patients and their concerns can be researched during their disease...|$|R

40|$|Background: An advance {{directive}} (AD) is {{a written}} or verbal document that legally stipulates a person’s health care preference {{while they are}} competent to make decisions for themselves and is used to guide decisions on lifesustaining treatment {{in the event that}} they become incapacitated. AD can {{take the form of a}} living will, a limitation of care document, a do-not-resuscitate order, or an appointment of a surrogate by durable power of attorney. The completion rate of AD varies from region to region, and it is influenced by multiple factors. The objectives of this study were to determine the proportion of <b>terminally</b> <b>ill</b> <b>patients</b> with AD and to identify the factors that influence the completion of AD amongst <b>terminally</b> <b>ill</b> <b>patients</b> at a tertiary hospital in Kenya. Methods: The study was a retrospective survey. All available records of <b>terminally</b> <b>ill</b> <b>patients</b> seen at Aga Khan University Hospital, Nairobi, between July 2010 and December 2015, and that met the inclusion criteria were included in the study. Results: In total, 216 records of <b>terminally</b> <b>ill</b> <b>patients</b> were analyzed: 89 records were of patients that had AD and 127 records were of patients that did not have AD. The proportion of <b>terminally</b> <b>ill</b> <b>patients</b> that had completed AD was 41. 2 %. The factors that were associated with the completion of AD on bivariate analysis were history of ICU admission, history of endotracheal intubation, functional status of the patient, the medical specialty taking care of the patient, patient’s caregiver discussing the AD with the patient, and a palliative specialist review. On multivariate regression analysis, discussion of AD with a caregiver and patient’s functional impairment were the factors with statistically significant association with completion of AD. Conclusions: The proportion of <b>terminally</b> <b>ill</b> <b>patients</b> that had AD in their medical records was significant. However, most <b>terminally</b> <b>ill</b> <b>patients</b> did not have AD. Our data, perhaps the first on the subject in East Africa, suggest that most of the factors associated with AD completion mirrored those seen in other regions of the world. Discussion between patient and their physician and patient’s functional impairment were the factors independently associated with completion of AD. Therefore, physicians need to be aware of the importance of discussions of AD with their patients...|$|R
