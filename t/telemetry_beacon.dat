50|$|The first amateur {{satellites}} contained <b>telemetry</b> <b>beacons.</b> Since 1965, most OSCARs carry {{a linear}} transponder for two-way communications in real time. Some satellites have {{a bulletin board}} for store-and-forward digital communications, or a digipeater for direct packet radio connections.|$|R
5000|$|An amateur radio {{frequency}} in the 70-centimeter band was {{used during the}} satellite's operation. Intermittent continuous wave and AX.25 <b>telemetry</b> <b>beacons</b> were sent at one watt with the call sign K5USL.

40|$|ITC/USA 2012 Conference Proceedings / The Forty-Eighth Annual International Telemetering Conference and Technical Exhibition / October 22 - 25, 2012 / Town and Country Resort & Convention Center, San Diego, CaliforniaCurrently many {{airborne}} platforms (missiles, targets, and projectiles) contain multiple {{instrumentation systems}} {{to cover the}} functions of GPS and either <b>telemetry,</b> <b>beacon</b> tracking and/or flight termination. Most of these platforms are not very large, so mounting of various antennas to support these functions are physically close to each other. As a result, unwanted interference (in the form of RF coupling between them) is unavoidable. This paper will discuss the design considerations involved to minimize this interference {{as well as some}} lessons learned with its implementation...|$|E

The techniques developed are unique and innovative in the field of space communication. It outlines the objectives; the system requirements; the system layout; the theory of operation; software; communication protocols, including equipment specifications and other major aspects of the system.

40|$|International Telemetering Conference Proceedings / October 25 - 28, 1999 / Riviera Hotel and Convention Center, Las Vegas, NevadaInstrumentation antennas {{installed}} on missiles and airborne targets {{are required to}} be tested and certified prior to flight. The antenna coupler {{is a means of}} certifying that the antenna is in proper working condition prior to deployment, as damage to the antennas may have occurred during transportation or installation. This coupler also provides a low cost means to evaluate and monitor the antenna throughout the various stages of design and assembly. These antennas can contain arrays for <b>telemetry,</b> <b>beacon</b> tracking, global positioning systems and flight termination. A failure by any one of these arrays could result in the loss of data or improper operation of the flight vehicle. Description of the design and function of antenna couplers will be discussed...|$|E
50|$|Beacons {{are also}} used in both {{geostationary}} and inclined orbit satellites. Any satellite will emit one or more beacons (normally on a fixed frequency) whose purpose is twofold; as well as containing modulated station keeping information (<b>telemetry),</b> the <b>beacon</b> {{is also used to}} locate the satellite (determine its azimuth and elevation) in the sky.|$|R
50|$|On October 4, 1957, America {{was shaken}} by the launch by the Soviet Union of the first {{artificial}} satellite, Sputnik I. The U.S. Air Force and the CIA assembled a highly secret <b>Telemetry</b> and <b>Beacon</b> Analysis Committee (TABAC) to analyze the signals recorded from the launch at Tyuratam and those heard {{all over the world}} from Sputnik. From his work in Jam Session, Duckett was asked to be a leader in the TABAC effort. It required about 18 months to calibrate the signals and understand how they related to the launch vehicle characteristics. The payoff, however, was significant; for the next two decades this provided the U.S a major window into the operation of Soviet missiles.|$|R
50|$|Instrumentation {{included}} a <b>beacon</b> <b>telemetry</b> system {{that provided a}} tracking signal, monitored spacecraft skin temperature between -120 and +16 C, and measured the internal pressure of the spacecraft between 0.00005 mm of mercury and 0.5 mm of mercury, especially during the initial inflation stages. The system consisted of two beacon assemblies powered by solar cell panels and had a minimum power output of 45 mW at 136.02 MHz and 136.17 MHz.|$|R
40|$|Free space optical {{communication}} techniques {{have been the}} subject of numerous investigations in recent years, with multiple missions expected to fly in the near future. Existing methods require high pointing accuracies, drastically driving up overall system cost. Recent developments in LED-based visible light communication (VLC) and past in-orbit experiments have convinced us that the technology has reached a critical level of maturity. On these premises, we propose a new {{optical communication}} system utilizing a VLC downlink and a high throughput, omnidirectional photovoltaic cell receiver system. By performing error-correction via deep learning methods and by utilizing phase-delay interference, the system is able to deliver data rates that match those of traditional laser-based solutions. A prototype of the proposed system has been constructed, demonstrating the scheme to be a feasible alternative to laser-based methods. This creates an opportunity for the full scale development of optical communication techniques on small spacecraft as a backup <b>telemetry</b> <b>beacon</b> or as a high throughput link...|$|E
40|$|A new {{deep space}} {{transponder}} {{is being developed}} by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory for NASA. The Spacecraft Transponding Modem (STM) implements the standard transponder functions and the channel service functions that have previously resided in spacecraft Command/Data Subsystems. The STM uses custom ASICs, MMICs, and MCMs to reduce the active device parts count to 70, mass to I kg, and volume to 524 cc. The first STMs will be flown on missions launching in the 2003 time frame. The STM tracks an X-band uplink signal and provides both X-band and Ka-band downlinks, either coherent or non-coherent with the uplink. A NASA standard Command Detector Unit is integrated into the STM, along with a codeblock processor and a hardware command decoder. The decoded command codeblocks are output to the spacecraft command/data subsystem. Virtual Channel 0 (VC- 0) (hardware) commands are processed and output as critical controller (CRC) commands. Downlink telemetry is received from the spacecraft data subsystem as telemetry frames. The STM provides the following downlink coding options: the standard CCSDS (7 - 1 / 2) convolutional coding, ReedSolomon coding with interleave depths one and five, (15 - 1 / 6) convolutional coding, and Turbo coding with rates 1 / 3 and 1 / 6. The downlink symbol rates can be linearly ramped to match the G/T curve of the receiving station, providing up to a 1 dB increase in data return. Data rates range from 5 bits per second (bps) to 24 Mbps, with three modulation modes provided: modulated subcarrier (3 different frequencies provided), biphase-L modulated direct on carrier, and Offset QPSK. Also, the capability to generate one of four non-harmonically related <b>telemetry</b> <b>beacon</b> tones is provided, {{to allow for a}} simple spacecraft status monitoring scheme for cruise phases of missions. Three ranging modes are provided: standard turn around ranging, regenerative pseudo-noise (PN) ranging, and Differential One-way Ranging (DOR) tones. The regenerative ranging provides the capability of increasing the ground received ranging SNR by up to 30 dB. Two different avionics interfaces to the command/data subsystem's data bus are provided: a MIL STD 1553 B bus or an industry standard PCI interface. Digital interfaces provide the capability to control antenna selection (e. g., switching between high gain and low gain antennas) and antenna pointing (for future steered Ka-band antennas) ...|$|E
50|$|The {{spacecraft}} uses {{a measuring}} tape as an antenna {{to communicate with}} ground stations. CSSWE was first heard <b>beaconing</b> <b>telemetry</b> packets by amateur radio operator call sign DK3WN almost exactly two hours after deployment from the PPOD, overcoming its first major hurdle. The spacecraft completed science commissioning and was commanded into full science mode 22 days later on October 5. Full mission success occurred on January 5, 2013 {{after three months of}} science data. The CSSWE mission ended in December 2014 due to battery degradation.|$|R
5000|$|The Small Deep Space Transponder is a {{transponder}} {{designed by}} JPL specifically for deep space probes. [...] It unifies {{a number of}} communication functions - receiver, command detector, <b>telemetry</b> modulator, exciters, <b>beacon</b> tone generator, and control functions - into one 3-kg package. The SDST is designed to handle X band uplink and both X band and Ka band downlink. JPL estimates that performing the same functions with separate units (as was done previously) requires over twice the mass and 4 or 5 individual subassemblies.|$|R
40|$|NASA's Solar-TErrestrial Relations Observatory mission, {{launched}} in 2006 October, {{consists of two}} nearly identical spacecraft in heliocentric orbits and currently 1380 of heliolongitude apart. Instrumentation on both spacecraft monitor solar wind plasma and magnetic field parameters, energetic particles, radio flux, and provide EUV and visible-light imaging of the corona, as well as novel, visible-light images of the ecliptic heliosphere. In addition to higher-resolution telemetry that enables {{a broad range of}} research into the propagation of disturbances in the inner heliosphere, a low-bandwidth, space weather <b>beacon</b> <b>telemetry</b> stream provides near-realtime information on each of these measurement types...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{describe}} autonomous ground operation system for CUTE-I {{in order to}} reduce the fatigue of ground operator in the first place. The system consists of 1) remote ground station controller, 2) autonomous <b>beacon</b> <b>telemetry</b> analyzer, 3) operation scheduler, 4) data broadcasting system, and so on. From the result of autonomous operation of CUTE-I we found out the issues of the system. Therefore we propose the next autonomous ground operation system for our next satellite Cute- 1. 7 + APD in order to solve the found issues in the second place. Moreover we describe autonomous distributed ground station system under low baud rate communication in the third place. 1.

40|$|A patent {{disclosure}} document discusses a photonic {{method for}} connecting a spacecraft with a launch vehicle upper-stage telemetry {{system as a}} means for monitoring a spacecraft fs health and status during and right after separation and deployment. This method also provides an efficient opto-coupled capability for prelaunch built-in-test (BIT) on the ground to enable more efficient and timely integration, preflight checkout, and a means to obviate any local EMI (electromagnetic interference) during integration and test. Additional utility can be envisioned for BIT on other platforms, such as the International Space Station (ISS). The photonic telemetry system implements an optical free-space link with a divergent laser transmitter beam spoiled over a significant cone angle to accommodate changes in spacecraft position without having to angle track it during deployment. Since the spacecraft may lose attitude control and tumble during deployment, the transmitted laser beam interrogates any one of several low-profile meso-scale retro-reflective spatial light modulators (SLMs) deployed over the surface of the spacecraft. The return signal beam, modulated by the SLMs, contains health, status, and attitude information received back at the launch vehicle. Very compact low-power opto-coupler technology already exists for the received signal (requiring relatively low bandwidths, e. g.,. 200 kbps) to enable transfer to a forward pass RF relay from the launch vehicle to TDRSS (Tracking and Data Relay Satellite System) or another recipient. The link would be active during separation and post-separation to monitor spacecraft health, status, attitude, or other data inventories until attitude recovery and ground control can be re-established. An optical link would not interfere with the existing upper stage <b>telemetry</b> and <b>beacon</b> systems, thus meeting launch vehicle EMI environmental constraints...|$|R
40|$|Seafloor {{deformation}} {{is intrinsically}} related to tectonic processes, which potentially may evolve into geohazards, including earthquakes and tsunamis. The nascent scientific field of seafloor geodesy {{provides a way}} to monitor crustal deformation at high resolution comparable to the satellite-based GPS technique upon which terrestrial geodesy is largely based. The measurements extract information on stress and elastic strain stored in the oceanic crust. Horizontal seafloor displacement {{can be obtained by}} acoustic/GPS combination to provide absolute positioning or by long-term acoustic <b>telemetry</b> between different <b>beacons</b> fixed on the seafloor. The GeoSEA (Geodetic Earthquake Observatory on the SEAfloor) array uses acoustic telemetry for relative positioning at mm-scale resolution. The transponders within an array intercommunicate via acoustic signals for a period of up to 3. 5 years. The seafloor acoustic transponders are mounted on ∼ 4 m high tripod steel frames to ensure clear line-of-sight between the stations. The transponders also include high-precision pressure sensors to monitor vertical movements and dual-axis inclinometers in order to measure their level as well as any tilt of the seafloor. Sound velocity sensor measurements are used to correct for water sound speed variations. A further component of the network is GeoSURF, a self-steering autonomous surface vehicle (Wave Glider), which monitors system health and is able to upload the seafloor data to the sea surface and to transfer it via satellite. The GeoSEA array is capable of both continuously monitoring horizontal and vertical ground displacement rates along submarine fault zones and characterizing their behavior (locked or aseismically creeping). Seafloor transponders are currently installed along the Siliviri segment of the North Anatolian Fault offshore Istanbul for measurements of strain build-up along the fault. The first 18 month of baseline ranging were analyzed by a joint-least square inversion and forward modeling for across-fault baseline changes. The initial results of the long-term observation period preclude fault-displacement at rates larger than a few millimeters-per-year, suggesting a locked state for the Istanbul-Siliviri segment, indicating that this portion of the fault is accumulating stress rather than continuously creeping at a slip-rate higher than 10 mm/yr during the observation period. In addition, three arrays are currently deployed on the marine forearc and outer rise of the South American subduction system around 21 ◦S. This segment of the Nazca-South American plate boundary has last ruptured in an earthquake in 1877 and was identified as a seismic gap prior to the 2014 Iquique/Pisagua earthquake (Mw= 8. 1). The southern portion of the segment remains unbroken by a recent earthquake...|$|R
