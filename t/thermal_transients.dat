40|$|To {{ensure the}} highest quality & {{long-term}} reliability of LED components {{it is necessary to}} examine LED dice that have sustained mechanical damage during the manufacturing process. This paper has demonstrated that detection of die crack in mass manufactured LEDs can be achieved by measuring Temperature Sensitive Parameters (TSPs) during final testing.

Evaluations conducted at lab scale shows that <b>thermal</b> <b>transient</b> behaviour of cracked die is significantly different than that of an undamaged die.

The thermal expansions of the shafts cause changes of the distribution of stresses and strains, whose effects can give rise to the separation or the contact between portions of the surfaces of transverse cracks.
