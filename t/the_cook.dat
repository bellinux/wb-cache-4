5|$|In 1991, the Government of <b>the</b> <b>Cook</b> Islands {{identified}} {{the lack of}} funding for sport facilities as a key reason why the nation has not succeeded at international competitions. It believed that investing in sporting infrastructure would enable the nation to be more globally competitive. Netball was not recognised as an Olympic sport until 1995.

Most netball courts are owned by the local village or club. With the exception of National Auditorium, all courts are outside.
