5|$|From early on, ascetics {{have played}} a major role in the Swaminarayan sect. They {{contribute}} towards growth and development of the movement, encouraging people to follow a pious and religious life. Tradition maintains that Swaminarayan initiated 500 ascetics as paramhansas in a single night. Paramhansa is a title of honour sometimes applied to Hindu spiritual teachers who are regarded as having attained enlightenment. Paramhansas were <b>the</b> <b>highest</b> <b>order</b> of sannyasi in the sect.

During formal dinners he often said nothing at all except for the occasional cascade of dramatic rhetoric.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to propose the {{accurate}} and simple reliability based design method adjusting the distribution shapes by means of <b>high</b> <b>order</b> moment. In this paper, we propose <b>the</b> <b>high</b> <b>order</b> moment standardizing method, and define a reliability index using the proposed method. Firstly, <b>the</b> <b>high</b> <b>order</b> moment standardizing method, which is able to treat random variables handly, is proposed by using <b>the</b> <b>high</b> <b>order</b> mement, and <b>the</b> proposed method is evolved into the third order moment standardizing mehtod concretely. <b>The</b> <b>high</b> <b>order</b> moment standardizing function is defined in the form of a series with undetermined coefficients. The coefficients are determined by using the information of <b>the</b> <b>high</b> <b>order</b> moments of random variables. Secondly, the reliability index based on the proposed method is defined. The reliability index is composed of <b>the</b> <b>high</b> <b>order</b> moments, which are offered by a finite number of data in the same manner as a mean or a standard deviation.

The evolution of <b>the</b> <b>higher</b> <b>order</b> terms with respect to <b>the</b> <b>higher</b> <b>order</b> time variables can be described through {{the introduction of a}} linearized KdV hierarchy. This allows one to give an expression of <b>the</b> <b>higher</b> <b>order</b> time derivatives that appear in the right hand member of the perturbative expansion equations, to show that overall <b>the</b> <b>higher</b> <b>order</b> terms do not produce any secularity and to prove that the formal expansion contains only bounded terms. ...|$|R
