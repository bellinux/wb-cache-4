5|$|The {{etymology}} of {{the title}} ("commander") suggests that voivodes had significant military duties. They were <b>the</b> <b>supreme</b> <b>leader</b> of the troops recruited in the counties under their jurisdiction. Although law obliged noblemen {{to fight in the}} king's army, Transylvanian nobles fought under the command of the voivode. Furthermore, the voivodes had their own private retinue, formed primarily by armed noblemen. Their right to raise an army under their own flag was confirmed by legislation in 1498.|$|E
5|$|The second {{large-scale}} {{campaign is}} dated to 943, when Igor was <b>the</b> <b>supreme</b> <b>leader</b> of the Rus', {{according to the}} Primary Chronicle. During the 943 expedition, the Rus' rowed up the Kura River, deep into the Caucasus, defeated the forces of Marzuban bin Muhammad, and captured Bardha'a, the capital of Arran. The Rus' allowed the local people to retain their religion in exchange for recognition of their overlordship; {{it is possible that}} the Rus' intended to settle permanently there. According to ibn Miskawaih, the local people broke the peace by stone-throwing and other abuse directed against the Rus', who then demanded that the inhabitants evacuate the city. This ultimatum was rejected, and the Rus' began killing people and holding many for ransom. The slaughter was briefly interrupted for negotiations, which soon broke down. The Rus' stayed in Bardha'a for several months, using it as a base for plundering the adjacent areas, and amassed substantial spoils.|$|E
