5|$|At the camp, Theo and Kee meet a Romanian woman, Marichka, who {{provides}} {{a room where}} Kee gives birth to a baby girl. The next day, Syd finds them in their room, and informs Theo and Kee that war has broken out between the British Army and the refugees, including the Fishes. Having learned {{that they have a}} bounty on their heads, Syd attempts to capture them, but Marichka and Theo fight him off and escape. Amidst the fighting, the Fishes capture Kee and the baby. Theo tracks them to an apartment under heavy fire where he confronts Luke, who is then killed by a tank shell, and escorts Kee and <b>the</b> <b>baby</b> <b>out.</b> Awed by the baby, the combatants temporarily stop fighting; staring at the screaming baby, they allow the group to leave. Marichka leads Theo, Kee, and the baby to a boat in a sewer, and Theo rows away whilst Marichka stays behind.|$|E
500|$|Although {{they came}} to {{learn a great deal}} about the game, neither Kotok nor McCarthy were known as chess players. Mikhail Botvinnik, three times world chess champion, wrote in his book Computers, Chess and Long-Range Planning that the Kotok–McCarthy program's [...] "rule for rejecting moves was so {{constituted}} that the machine threw <b>the</b> <b>baby</b> <b>out</b> with the bath water." [...] The program drew criticism from Richard Greenblatt, who later wrote Mac Hack, which beat a person in tournament play, and more recently, from Hans Berliner, when he looked back on it in 2005. During the Cold War, Kotok-McCarthy played (and lost to) the best Russian chess program in the first match between computer programs.|$|E
500|$|... "Suddenly {{she sat up}} in her bed {{and looked}} {{from one to the}} other of us with wide, frightened eyes," [...] wrote Eagar. [...] "She cried out suddenly, 'I'm dying! I'm dying!' She was coaxed to lie down again, but {{remained}} agitated. [...] "The child turned to me, and said anxiously, 'Send a telegram to mama.'" [...] Eagar promised it would be done. [...] "She added, 'immediately.' ... We continued to fan the feeble spark of life, but moment by moment it declined. She began to talk to her cousins, and seemed to imagine she was playing with them. She asked for little Anastasie and I brought the wee thing into the room. The dying eyes rested on her for a moment, and Anastasie said, 'Poor cousin Ella! Poor Princess Elizabeth!' I took <b>the</b> <b>baby</b> <b>out</b> of the room." [...] Doctors told Alexandra that the child's mother should be notified, but the telegram did not arrive until the following morning, when Elisabeth had already died. An autopsy following her death confirmed that she had died of virulent typhoid, although it was rumored she had eaten from a poisoned dish intended for the Tsar.|$|E
50|$|The {{foundling}} hospitals {{had been}} {{started as a}} reform to save the numerous infants who were being abandoned {{in the streets of}} Paris. Infant mortality at that date was extremely high - about 50 percent, in large part because families sent their infants to be wet nursed. The mortality rate in the foundling hospitals, which also sent <b>the</b> <b>babies</b> <b>out</b> to be wet nursed, proved worse, however, and most of the infants sent there likely perished.|$|R
50|$|In most cases, such {{feedback}} loops {{culminate in}} counter-signals being released that suppress or break the loop. Childbirth contractions stop when <b>the</b> <b>baby</b> is <b>out</b> of <b>the</b> mother's body. Chemicals {{break down the}} blood clot. Lactation stops when <b>the</b> <b>baby</b> no longer nurses.|$|R

2500|$|She returns {{once her}} treatment's {{completed}} and apologizes for what she's put Patrick through. Robin asks him {{if they can}} fix their relationship. Patrick assures her that she's {{the center of their}} family's life. He says that though what they've gone through {{is not going to be}} his favorite chapter of the 'Robin & Patrick saga', there's nothing to fix because what happened was beyond her control. They finally get a chance to really talk. Patrick reassures Robin of how invested he is in their life together. The two say [...] "I love you" [...] to each other and they go home together where Robin reunites with Emma with whom she can now bond. For a while, Robin's so attached to Emma that she actually contemplates not going back to work. Even Maxie notices and comments about how before Robin didn't even want to touch Emma, but now Patrick can't pry <b>the</b> <b>baby</b> <b>out</b> of her hands.|$|E
2500|$|Bindusara {{was the son}} of {{the first}} Mauryan emperor Chandragupta Maurya and his queen Durdhara. During his reign, the empire {{expanded}} southwards. According to the Rajavalikatha, a Jain work, the original name of this emperor was Simhasena. According to a legend mentioned in the Jain texts, Chandragupta's Guru and advisor Chanakya used to feed the emperor small doses of poison with his food to build his immunity against possible assassination attempts by his enemies. One day, Chandragupta, not knowing about the poison, shared his food with his pregnant wife, who was 7days away from delivery. The queen collapsed and died within few minutes. Chanakya entered the room at the very moment she collapsed, and, in order to save the child in the womb, he immediately cut open the dead queen's belly and took <b>the</b> <b>baby</b> <b>out.</b> By that time a drop of poison had already reached the baby and touched its head, due to which the child got a permanent blueish spot (a [...] "bindu") on his forehead. Thus, the newborn was named [...] "Bindusara".|$|E
2500|$|Zelena and Hook {{are both}} {{chained to the}} wall in Emma’s basement, as Zelena thinks Emma is {{preparing}} a spell to take her magic. Emma says she’s giving her dark magic to Zelena. Hook asks why keep it a secret, and {{she says that she}} did this because she knew he would want to stop her. She says the dark magic must be put into a vessel, and then Emma will cut her down. Emma says that’s why she needed <b>the</b> <b>baby</b> <b>out.</b> She reminds him that Zelena killed Marian and Neal, but Hook says that it’s still [...] "cold-blooded murder." [...] Hook says Merlin must have a better solution, but she says that he can’t help them anymore. Hook asks what happened to Merlin, and he asks her again why she’s really doing this. Mary asks David and Regina how Emma can use Zelena to end dark magic, but they can't figure it out. Regina says no one hurts her sister except for her and tells them she’s going to show Emma what dark magic is really like. Mary Margaret and David argue with Regina over going to war with Emma. Regina says Emma gave her the dagger because they knew {{she was the only one}} who could act. Emma comes out and says when she’s done with Zelena, they will all be better off. Regina says that his is not right, but Emma says she knows Regina will be happier when Zelena is gone. Emma uses Excalibur to freeze them, while putting up a magic barrier around the house.|$|E

In her oral testimony, which lasted 4 minutes, she stated:I volunteered at the al-Addan {{hospital}} with twelve other women who wanted to help as well. I was the youngest volunteer. The other women were from twenty to thirty years old. While I was there I saw the Iraqi soldiers come into the hospital with guns.

She put the soup tureen away in the pantry. Then she sat down to think things over.|$|E

60|$|Julius came in shortly after, {{but before}} {{he had heard the}} tale of Fanny Reynolds, Anne had {{returned}} to say that neither child nor nurse had been at the Hall, nor passed the large gate that morning. It was growing rather alarming. The other servants said Emma had taken <b>the</b> <b>baby</b> <b>out</b> as usual in the morning, but had not returned to dinner, and they too had supposed her at the Hall. None of the dependants of the Hall in the cottages round knew anything of her, but at last Dilemma Hornblower imparted that she had seen my lady's baby's green cloak atop of a tax-cart going towards Wil'sbro'.|$|E

Well, sir, John did not say nothing, but he took <b>the</b> <b>baby</b> <b>out</b> of her arms and gave it to me, and then he upped and took the poor young creature--she were no great weight, sir--and carried her into the house, and laid her on the bed, as it might be by the window there.|$|E
60|$|Miss Prism. Lady Bracknell, I admit {{with shame}} that I do not know. I only wish I did. The plain {{facts of the}} case are these. On the morning of the day you mention, a day that is for ever branded on my memory, I {{prepared}} as usual to take <b>the</b> <b>baby</b> <b>out</b> in its perambulator. I had also with me a somewhat old, but capacious hand-bag in which I had intended to place the manuscript of a work of fiction that I had written during my few unoccupied hours. In a moment of mental abstraction, for which I never can forgive myself, I deposited the manuscript in the basinette, and placed the baby in the hand-bag.|$|E

60|$|In Carol's own {{twenty-four hours}} a day she got up, dressed the baby, had breakfast, talked to Oscarina about the day's shopping, put the baby on the porch to play, went to the butcher's to choose between steak and pork chops, bathed the baby, nailed up a shelf, had dinner, put the baby to bed for a nap, paid the iceman, read for an hour, took <b>the</b> <b>baby</b> <b>out</b> for a walk, called on Vida, had supper, put the baby to bed, darned socks, listened to Kennicott's yawning comment on what a fool Dr. McGanum was to try to use that cheap X-ray outfit of his on an epithelioma, {{repaired}} a frock, drowsily heard Kennicott stoke the furnace, tried to read a page of Thorstein Veblen--and the day was gone.|$|E
60|$|The {{next few}} days passed without incident. Mildred settled down in her new surroundings. When Philip hurried off after breakfast she had the whole morning to do the housework. They ate very simply, but she liked {{to take a long}} time to buy the few things they needed; she could not be bothered to cook {{anything}} for her dinner, but made herself some cocoa and ate bread and butter; then she took <b>the</b> <b>baby</b> <b>out</b> in the gocart, and when she came in spent the rest of the afternoon in idleness. She was tired out, and it suited her to do so little. She made friends with Philip's forbidding landlady over the rent, which he left with Mildred to pay, and within a week was able to tell him more about his neighbours than he had learned in a year.|$|E
60|$|The days {{began to}} go by in a sunny, still, midsummer monotony. She pushed <b>the</b> <b>baby</b> <b>out</b> in its carriage, and saw the summer {{boarders}} walking or driving through the streets; she returned the visits that the neighbors paid her; indoors she helped her mother about the housework. An image of her maiden life reinstated itself. At times it seemed {{almost as if she}} had dreamed her marriage. When she looked at her baby in these moods, she thought she was dreaming yet. A young wife suddenly parted for the first time from her husband, in whose intense possession she has lost her individual existence, and devolving upon her old separate personality, must have strong fancies, strange sensations. Marcia's marriage had been full of such shocks and storms as might well have left her dazed in their entire cessation.|$|E

6000|$|... "Oh! Bobby, {{how could}} you ever think that! Well, I put <b>the</b> <b>baby</b> <b>out</b> to board with a family {{of the name of}} Twitter. Now it seems, all unbeknown to me, Mrs Twitter is a great helper at the George Yard Ragged Schools, where our Hetty has often seen her; but as we've bin used never to speak about the work there, as your father didn't like it, of course I know'd nothin' about Mrs Twitter bein' given to goin' there. Well, it seems she's very free with her money and gives a good deal away to poor people." [...] (She's not the only one, thought the boy.)

6000|$|Somehow, all {{his money}} seemed to fade away in Home drafts and the {{crushing}} Exchange, and {{the tone of the}} Home letters changed and grew querulous.

Then Dicky, whose heart yearned to his wife and the little son he had never seen--which, again, is a feeling no boy is entitled to--enlarged the draft and wrote queer half-boy, half-man letters, saying that life was not so enjoyable after all and would the little wife wait yet a little longer? But the little wife, however much she approved of money, objected to waiting, and there was a strange, hard sort of ring in her letters that Dicky didn't understand. How could he, poor boy? ...|$|E
60|$|In a {{few weeks}} they began to set out on their return home, which they reached one hot day, eight months after they had all left. The king was greatly beloved by his people, and crowds lined the roads, {{shouting}} and waving their hats as the procession passed along. On {{the steps of the}} palace stood the queen, with a splendid golden cushion in her arms, and on the cushion the most beautiful boy that ever was seen, wrapped about in a cloud of lace. In a moment Kostieï's words rushed into the king's mind, and he began to weep bitterly, to the surprise of everybody, who had expected him nearly to die of joy at the sight of his son. But try as he would and work as hard as he might he could never forget his promise, and every time he let <b>the</b> <b>baby</b> <b>out</b> of his sight he thought that he had seen it for the last time.|$|E
