5|$|Cnidarians were {{formerly}} grouped with ctenophores in the phylum Coelenterata, but increasing {{awareness of}} their differences caused them <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>placed</b> <b>in</b> separate phyla.

Staurozoa have recently been recognised as a class in their own right rather than a sub-group of Scyphozoa, and the parasitic Myxozoa and Polypodiozoa were only firmly recognized as cnidarians in 2007.|$|E

5|$|In a {{molecular}} analysis of Boletaceae phylogeny, the brawny bolete was most {{closely related to}} Boletus luteocupreus; these two species formed a clade that was sister to B.luridus.

This indicated that the brawny bolete and its relatives needed <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>placed</b> <b>in</b> a new genus. It was made the type species of the new genus Imperator, becoming Imperator torosus, in 2015.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} {{there were}} servants quarters and spaces {{on the ground}} floor, and a library in the north room on the second floor, {{as well as a}} sitting room over the octagonal drawing room. According to Repton, the design should allow ground floor rooms where the garden is visible and directly accessible, meaning that servants quarters needed <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>placed</b> <b>in</b> their own wing, but without prominence so as to maintain the hierarchy. In the south-east corner of the building there was a gothic loggia which was glazed in the 19th century to create a conservatory, some time after the conservatory in the American Garden was removed.|$|E
