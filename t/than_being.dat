5|$|In the Modern Age and Renaissance, European herbals diversified and innovated, {{and came}} to rely more on direct {{observation}} <b>than</b> <b>being</b> mere adaptations of traditional models. Typical examples from the period are the fully illustrated De Historia Stirpium Commentarii Insignes by Leonhart Fuchs (1542, with over 400 plants), the astrologically themed Complete Herbal by Nicholas Culpeper (1653), and the Curious Herbal by Elizabeth Blackwell (1737).|$|E

5|$|The {{foundation}} of the Fourth International was therefore spurred {{in part by a}} desire to form a stronger political current, rather <b>than</b> <b>being</b> seen as the communist opposition to the Comintern and the Soviet Union.

5|$|A {{closer look}} into the {{behavior}} of Cornu aspersum, shows {{that it is not}} the mechanical action of the dart that increases paternity in sperm donors but instead the mucus that coats the dart. The mucus carries an allohormone that is transferred into the recipient snail’s hemolymph when the dart is stabbed. This allohormone reconfigures the female component of the reproductive system in the receiving individual: the bursa copulax (sperm digestion organ) is closed off, and the copulatory canal (leading to the sperm storage) is opened. This reconfiguration allows more sperm to access the sperm storage area and fertilize eggs, rather <b>than</b> <b>being</b> digested. Ultimately this increases the shooter’s paternity.|$|E
