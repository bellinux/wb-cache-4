5|$|In {{the gold}} rush of 1893, miners in Kalgoorlie {{discarded}} a pyritic material as <b>they</b> <b>searched</b> for pure gold, and {{it was used to}} fill in potholes and build sidewalks. In 1896, that tailing was discovered to be calaverite, a telluride of gold, and it sparked a second gold rush that included mining the streets.|$|E

Making their way inside, <b>they</b> <b>searched</b> for the queen's bedchamber.

Infuriated, the rest surged towards the breach and streamed inside.|$|E
5|$|Enlightenment {{philosophy}} {{had developed}} Western Europeans’ interest in Greece, or rather in an idealised Ancient Greece, {{the linchpin of}} Antiquity, as it was perceived and taught. The Enlightenment philosophers, for whom the notions of Nature and Reason were so important, believed that these had been the fundamental values of Classical Athens. The Ancient Greek democracies, and above all Athens, became models to emulate. There <b>they</b> <b>searched</b> for answers to the political and philosophical problems of their time. Works {{such as those of}} Abbé Barthélemy, Voyage du Jeune Anacharsis (1788), served to fix definitively the image that Europe had of the Aegean.|$|E

5|$|Even {{before the}} Bern disputation, Zwingli was {{canvassing}} for {{an alliance of}} reformed cities. Once Bern officially accepted the Reformation, a new alliance, das Christliche Burgrecht (the Christian Civic Union) was created. The first meetings were held in Bern between representatives of Bern, Constance, and Zurich on 5–6 January 1528. Other cities, including Basel, Biel, Mülhausen, Schaffhausen, and St Gallen, eventually joined the alliance. The Five (Catholic) States felt encircled and isolated, so <b>they</b> <b>searched</b> for outside allies. After two months of negotiations, the Five States formed die Christliche Vereinigung (the Christian Alliance) with Ferdinand of Austria on 22 April 1529.|$|E
5|$|On August 21, 1864, the {{soldiers}} began traveling up Fishing Creek. For the next week, <b>they</b> <b>searched</b> the northern portion of Columbia County for deserters and draft evaders. They {{were unable to}} find any, but on August 28 they arrested 100 local citizens. Most were released, although some were taken to Fort Mifflin. The soldiers continued heading into the northernmost reaches of the Fishing Creek watershed. Unable to find any evidence of a conspiracy, they returned to Bloomsburg and remained in the county until December 1864. The last of the prisoners were released from Fort Mifflin several months after their arrest.|$|E
5|$|The bombing had {{destroyed}} the north {{wing of the}} school. During the search, rescuers found an additional 500pounds (230kg) of dynamite which had failed to detonate in the south wing. The search was halted to allow the Michigan State Police to disarm the devices, and they found an alarm clock timed to go off at 8:45a.m. Investigators speculated that the initial explosion may have caused a short circuit in {{the second set of}} bombs, preventing them from detonating. <b>They</b> <b>searched</b> the building and then returned to the recovery work.|$|E

5|$|The first {{mission of}} 1946 was Operation Hebron on 8January. This time the {{objective}} was the cordon and {{search of the}} town of Rishon LeZion by the 3rd Parachute Brigade and the police, during which fifty-five suspects were taken into custody. For the rest of the month, the brigade was involved in several smaller operations. In Operation Pigeon on 30January, <b>they</b> <b>searched</b> the Shapira district of Tel Aviv.|$|E
5|$|Upon {{receiving}} notification, the OAEP {{sent two}} officers to investigate, {{who met the}} doctors and patients at the hospital shortly after noon on 18 February. After questioning the scrapyard owner, <b>they</b> <b>searched</b> for the cylindrical metal pieces initially suspected to be the radiation source, but found {{that they were not}} radioactive. They then headed to the scrapyard, and noted abnormally high levels of radiation as they approached, late in the evening. At the scrapyard entrance they measured radiation at an equivalent dose of 1 millisievert per hour (mSv/h) and decided to request additional assistance.|$|E

Julia's daughter, Victoria Elizabeth, born in the Elmswood Nursing Home on 19June 1945, was {{subsequently}} given up for adoption to a Norwegian Salvation Army Captain and his wife (Peder and Margaret Pedersen) after intense pressure from the Stanley family. John Lennon was informed by his Aunt Harriet of her existence in 1964. John was so overcome by emotion, wanting to find his sister, that he placed an ad in the paper, and hired detectives to look for her. <b>They</b> <b>searched</b> Norway for Victoria, and came up empty handed, and John died never having found or knowing her.|$|E

5|$|In 1863, the German chemists Ferdinand Reich and Hieronymous Theodor Richter were testing ores {{from the}} mines around Freiberg, Saxony. They {{dissolved}} the minerals pyrite, arsenopyrite, galena and sphalerite in hydrochloric acid and distilled raw zinc chloride. Reich, who was color-blind, employed Richter {{as an assistant}} for detecting the colored spectral lines. Knowing that ores from that region sometimes contain thallium, <b>they</b> <b>searched</b> for the green thallium emission spectrum lines. Instead, they found a bright blue line. Because that blue line did not match any known element, they hypothesized a new element was present in the minerals. They named the element indium, from the indigo color seen in its spectrum, after the Latin indicum, meaning 'of India'.|$|E
5|$|In 1943, a British {{mission was}} sent to the United States to assist the American Manhattan Project in {{developing}} atomic bombs. First to arrive at the Los Alamos Laboratory were Frisch and Titterton, on 13 December 1943. The two shared an office at first, but were soon working on different projects. Titterton worked in collaboration with the American physicist Boyce McDaniel in Robert R. Wilson's P-1 (Cyclotron) Group. Together, <b>they</b> <b>searched</b> for delays between nuclear fission and the emission of prompt neutrons. A sizeable delay could make a nuclear chain reaction impractical. They calculated that most were emitted in less than 1 nanosecond; subsequent experiments demonstrated that fission took less than a nanosecond too.|$|E
5|$|On 5 August, Pash {{received}} a secret message from Washington, D.C., {{reporting that the}} French physicist Frédéric Joliot-Curie had been sighted at his holiday home at L'Arcouest in Brittany. Joliot-Curie {{was at the top}} of Alsos's wanted list, so Pash and CIC Special Agent Gerry Beatson set out to investigate in the wake of the advancing U.S. Third Army. <b>They</b> <b>searched</b> the University of Rennes and found some documents there on 9 August. On 11 August they reached the homes of Joliot-Curie, Francis Perrin, and Pierre Auger in the L'Arcouest area. Joliot-Curie was not home, but German snipers fired on them, and they had to wait until 12 August before they could search the house.|$|E

5|$|The 4th Cruiser Squadron was tasked {{to protect}} Allied {{merchant}} shipping from commerce raiders in the Caribbean {{and along the}} East Coast of North America and Craddock dispersed his ships shortly before the war began on 4 August 1914 in a futile search for the two German warships known {{to be in the}} area. In the early evening of 6 August, Bristol spotted the German light cruiser , but failed to inflict any significant damage before engine problems allowed the German ship to disengage behind her own smoke. Later in the month, Bristol began patrolling off the northern coast of Brazil in an unsuccessful attempt to find the German ships. The ship was detached to continue to patrol the Brazilian coast and did not join Craddock's ships as <b>they</b> <b>searched</b> for the East Asia Squadron off the Chilean coast in October.|$|E
5|$|The Bratvaag {{left the}} island to {{continue}} its scheduled hunting and observations, {{with the intent of}} coming back later to see if the ice had melted further and uncovered more artifacts. Further discoveries were made by the M/K Isbjørn of Tromsø, Norway, a sealing sloop chartered by news reporters to waylay the Bratvaag. Unsuccessful in this, the reporters and the Isbjørn crew made instead for Kvitøya, landing on the island on September 5 in fine weather and finding even less ice than the Bratvaag had. After photographing the area, <b>they</b> <b>searched</b> for and found Frankel's body, and additional artifacts, including a tin box containing Strindberg's photographic film, his logbook and maps. The crews of both ships turned over their finds to a scientific commission of the Swedish and Norwegian governments in Tromsø on September 2 and 16, respectively. The bodies of the three explorers were transported to Stockholm, arriving on October 5.|$|E
5|$|By that stage, Vann was {{frustrated}} by the Civil Guard soldiers of Task Force B, because {{they appeared to be}} in no hurry to reach Ap Bac, as <b>they</b> <b>searched</b> one house at a time while marching up from the southwest flank of the battlefield. In his final effort to defeat the Viet Cong, Vann flew into Tan Hiep and asked Cao to deploy an airborne battalion {{on the east side of}} Ap Bac, the most logical retreat route for the Viet Cong. Vann hoped to trap the Viet Cong inside the hamlets by blocking their retreat routes on all sides, and annihilate them using an elite battalion of South Vietnamese paratroopers. To Vann's disappointment, Cao strongly opposed the idea and decided to drop one of his airborne battalions behind the M113 formation on the west side instead. Vann accused Cao of wanting to let the Viet Cong escape in order to avoid further South Vietnamese casualties. However, Cao argued that a surrounded and well-entrenched enemy would fight more fiercely than a retreating one, so he wanted the Viet Cong units inside the hamlets of Ap Bac and Ap Tan Thoi to expose themselves by retreating through the eastern side of the battlefield, where he could destroy them with artillery and air power. Cao had also lost confidence in Vann, because Cao felt Vann had placed the lives of many South Vietnamese soldiers at risk to save the lives of a handful of Americans. Major-General Tran Thien Khiem, Chief of the ARVN Joint General Staff, was present during the argument. He did not object to Cao's plan because it was consistent with President Diem's objective to save Vietnamese lives through the Rural Revolutionary Development and Chieu Hoi Programs, which encouraged Viet Cong fighters to join the South Vietnamese military.|$|E

5|$|Palace {{turned to}} former Manchester United captain Steve Bruce as their {{manager for the}} 2001–02 season. A good start gave the club hope for a {{promotion}} challenge, but Bruce then tried to walk out on the club after only four months in charge after being approached by Birmingham City to become their new manager. Palace put Bruce on gardening leave while <b>they</b> <b>searched</b> for a new manager. The club eventually allowed Bruce to join Birmingham, and he was replaced by Trevor Francis, ironically his predecessor at the Midlands club Under Francis, Palace finished mid-table for two successive seasons, and Francis left {{to be replaced by}} long-serving coach Steve Kember. Kember guided Palace to victories in their opening three games of the 2003–04 Division One campaign, which put Palace {{at the top of the}} table, but he was sacked in November after a terrible loss of form saw them slip towards the bottom three. Caretaker player-manager Kit Symons, was put in charge of first-team duties for a month and oversaw an improvement in form before the appointment of Iain Dowie as manager was made. Dowie, a former Palace player, transformed the club from relegation candidates at Christmas into play-off contenders in April, where they overcame West Ham United in the Play-off Final at the Millennium Stadium in Cardiff on Saturday 29 May 2004. A goal from captain Neil Shipperley was enough for them to win the match 1–0, and with it a return to the Premiership. Palace once again could not maintain their seat at the top table, however, and again dropped down a division in spite of the 21 Premiership goals struck by Andrew Johnson, the second highest goalscorer in the division. Palace now held the unwanted distinction of being the only team to have been relegated from the Premier League four times.|$|E
