Selena takes a sip of water before she leaves the restaurant, crying.|$|E
5|$|Welles {{later said}} that casting {{character}} actor Gino Corrado {{in the small}} part of <b>the</b> <b>waiter</b> at the El Rancho broke his heart. Corrado had appeared in many Hollywood films, often as a waiter, and Welles wanted all of the actors to be new to films.|$|E

It's {{a great thing}} to be easily {{distinguishable}} from <b>the</b> <b>waiters,</b> when <b>the</b> <b>waiters</b> are so often disappointed 'remittance men' of good English family, or the scions of Continental nobility. We mustn't ask everything." ...|$|R
5000|$|Late at night, a deaf {{old man is}} {{the sole}} patron in a cafe. Nearby, two <b>waiters,</b> one young, <b>the</b> other older, talk about him. When the old man orders another brandy, <b>the</b> young <b>waiter</b> purposefully overfills his glass. <b>The</b> <b>waiters</b> {{speculate}} about <b>the</b> old man's recent suicide attempt. <b>The</b> young <b>waiter</b> wants <b>the</b> patron to go home, and complains that he never gets to bed before three o'clock, while <b>the</b> older <b>waiter</b> is more understanding of the old man's plight. Again the old man asks for another brandy, {{but this time the}} young man tells him the cafe is closed. After he leaves, <b>the</b> <b>waiters</b> resume their discussion. <b>The</b> young <b>waiter</b> wants to hurry home to his wife; <b>the</b> older <b>waiter</b> is more thoughtful. He muses on youth, observes that he is now one [...] "of those who like to stay late in the cafe," [...] likening himself to the old man. He mentions the importance to some people of having [...] "a clean, well-lighted place" [...] in which they can spend time. After <b>the</b> young <b>waiter</b> leaves, <b>the</b> older <b>waiter</b> reflects on <b>the</b> emptiness of his own life and returns to his home and his insomnia.|$|R
5000|$|In 2016 <b>the</b> <b>Waiters</b> were {{temporarily}} {{suspended by}} Cornell's Office of the Judicial Administrator for possible {{violations of the}} Campus Code of Conduct.

5|$|A remorseful Leslie (Amy Poehler) tells a {{group of}} Recreation Center {{teachers}} the Pawnee budget has been cut by $1,000, and five of their classes {{will have to be}} cut, but exactly which classes has not yet been determined. Later, Leslie and Justin Anderson (Justin Theroux), who have been dating for weeks, have another excellent date in Indianapolis. At the end of the night, they decide their next date will be in Pawnee, and Leslie feels pressure to make their date equally exciting. While talking later with Ann (Rashida Jones), Leslie decides to host a dinner party at her home with all her interesting friends. She invites Mark (Paul Schneider), Tom (Aziz Ansari) and Ron (Nick Offerman), specifically excludes Jerry (Jim O'Heir), and asks Andy (Chris Pratt) to work as <b>the</b> <b>waiter.</b> Andy agrees, even though he hates Justin, Ann's former crush, and Mark, her current boyfriend.|$|E
5|$|The video {{begins with}} Swift {{entering}} the coffee shop. As she sits down, she notices that couple, opposite {{where she is}} sitting, is arguing, reminding Swift about her parents arguing when she was very young. Then <b>the</b> <b>waiter</b> (Toby Hemingway) comes by, just to take Swift's order, who looks up and she infatuates him, resulting in a romantic relationship between the two. They are seen moving in together and unpacking boxes. After some time of dating, he proposes to her on a rowboat and she cheerfully accepts. Later, the two are seen arguing, resulting in Swift running away from the house, crying, just like she did {{when she was younger}} as she saw her parents arguing. The boyfriend follows her, and the two reconcile the relationship. They get married and have two sons. In the end, time returns to when Swift was ordering her food at the coffee shop. Throughout the video, there are some scenes of Swift singing the verses of the song while walking barefoot on a green pasture amongst photos of her and her family. The photos are hanging on a white string in between two large trees. Swift is seen with her hair loose and wearing a white dress with a thin belt around the waist.|$|E

25|$|It {{was also}} {{around this time}} in Forth Worth when Short did one of his amazing acts of marksmanship. While dining in a restaurant, <b>the</b> <b>waiter</b> handed him {{a glass of milk}} that had a small fly {{treading}} on the surface.

25|$|The {{friends are}} {{presented}} with their bill. Schaunard's purse has gone missing {{and no one else}} has enough money to pay. The sly Musetta has the entire bill charged to Alcindoro. The sound of a military band is heard, and the friends leave. Alcindoro returns with the repaired shoe seeking Musetta. <b>The</b> <b>waiter</b> hands him the bill and, dumbfounded, Alcindoro sinks into a chair.|$|E
25|$|If ice {{is added}} after pouring {{it into the}} cup, this results in the {{formation}} of an aesthetically unpleasant layer {{on the surface of the}} drink, because the ice causes the oils to solidify. If water is added first, the ethanol causes the fat to emulsify, leading to the characteristic milky color. To avoid the precipitation of the anise (instead of emulsion), drinkers prefer not to reuse an arak-filled glass. In restaurants, when a bottle of arak is ordered, <b>the</b> <b>waiter</b> will usually bring a number of glasses along with it for this reason.|$|E

25|$|Wait staff trays are {{typically}} large circular disks used to serve drinks and/or food {{to people in}} restaurants, bars, and other hospitality industry businesses. <b>The</b> <b>waiter</b> or waitress carries the tray with the open palm of one hand placed underneath, in about {{the center of the}} tray, relying on dry friction between the hand and the smooth metal or plastic undersurface of the tray to retain control of the tray. Occasionally, the tray may slide from the waitperson's hand, and the contents crash to the floor. In a May 2012 survey of food industry servers, those responding revealed nearly 25 percent of staff that work or have worked in the hospitality industry have suffered an injury {{as a result of a}} toppled serving tray. Of those people questioned, 23 percent had burned or cut themselves while trying to serve drinks or food from a serving tray.|$|E
25|$|Jerry and Charlie O'Connell {{left the}} series to pursue film careers, and because Jerry was denied an {{executive}} producer credit on the series. When he left, they informed Charlie {{that they would}} no longer require him either. The brothers leaving the show upset many fans and Tracy Tormé was asked {{what could be done}} to win them back. This resulted in an unsuccessful effort to bring back some popular previously recurring characters. The producers negotiated with John Novak (Ross J. Kelly, the ambulance-chasing lawyer), Alex Bruhanski (Pavel Kurlienko, the taxi driver) and Lester Barrie (Elston Diggs <b>the</b> <b>waiter</b> at the Chandler Hotel) for their return in season five. Zoe McLellan (Logan St. Clair) was scheduled to appear again and Jason Gaffney (Conrad Bennish, Jr) from season one was confirmed for four episodes including the season finale. However, none of these guest stars appeared. Why Bennish didn't appear in the fifth season {{is one of the biggest}} behind-the-scenes mysteries of the show.|$|E
25|$|Poirot observes {{his fellow}} {{passengers}} in the funicular. There is a friendly American tourist called Mr Schwartz, a beautiful but melancholy woman, a distinguished-looking man {{reading a book}} in German and three criminal types playing cards. Arriving at the hotel, they find it somewhat in chaos as it is only just opening {{at the start of}} the season. To Poirot, the hotel manager seems in too much of a nervous panic; the only efficient person is Gustave, <b>the</b> <b>waiter.</b> Talking to the manager and then to Schwartz again, Poirot learns that the beautiful woman is a Madame Grandier, who comes each year on the anniversary of her husband's death in the area, and that the distinguished-looking man is Dr Lutz, a Jewish refugee from the Nazis in Vienna. Poirot introduces himself to Schwartz as Monsieur Poirier, a silk merchant from Lyon. The next morning, when delivering coffee to his room, Gustave tells Poirot that in fact he is M. Drouet, a police inspector. They are now cut off in the hotel as the funicular has been damaged during the night, probably by sabotage. Poirot and Gustave discuss who Marrascaud could be among the guests and staff, which includes Jacques, the cook's husband. Poirot is intrigued as to why a rendezvous has been arranged in such an isolated place.|$|E

6000|$|At the call, {{not only}} his own waiter, but two other idle waiters {{belonging}} to a quite different row of tables, rushed towards him with obsequious alacrity, {{which is not the}} general characteristic of <b>the</b> <b>waiters</b> in <b>the</b> Cafe Umberto. The young man muttered something and one of <b>the</b> <b>waiters</b> walking rapidly to the nearest door called out into the Galleria: [...] "Pasquale! O! Pasquale!" ...|$|R
500|$|... "Salah Paham" [...] (meaning [...] "Misunderstanding") follows Kari Boengsoe, a gambir merchant, {{who travels}} to Singapore after turning a tidy profit. When his escort leaves, Kari {{goes to a}} nearby {{restaurant}} for dinner. <b>The</b> <b>waiter</b> asks him, [...] "Kari apa?", to which Kari replies {{that he wants to}} eat. This exchange is repeated several times until <b>the</b> <b>waiter</b> asks [...] "Kari ajam? Kari kambing?" [...] Kari and <b>the</b> <b>waiter</b> begin fighting, and the police are called. When they arrive, they realize the source of the confusion, explain it, and leave. Shortly afterwards, the incident is repeated when Kari and <b>the</b> <b>waiter</b> have a misunderstanding over an ice cube. According to Balai Pustaka, [...] "Salah Paham" [...] was previously published. However, Ernst Kratz, in his bibliography of literature published in Indonesian magazines, does not note any publication.|$|E
500|$|... "Episode14", {{also known}} as [...] "Lonely Souls", is the seventh episode of the second season of the American mystery {{television}} series Twin Peaks.

500|$|She has [...] "lost count" [...] of {{the times}} she has been {{physically}} attacked by activists.

On another occasion, an activist dumped a dead raccoon on her plate at a restaurant; she told <b>the</b> <b>waiter</b> to remove it. She and Vogue publisher Ron Galotti once retaliated for a protest outside the Condé Nast offices during the company's annual Christmas party by sending down a plate of roast beef.|$|E
6000|$|And in the {{delirium}} of the moment, I {{began to}} indulge in foolish golden visions of the counts and countesses to whom Harry might introduce me; and every instant I expected to hear <b>the</b> <b>waiters</b> addressing some gentleman as [...] "My Lord," [...] or [...] "four Grace." [...] But if there were really any lords present, <b>the</b> <b>waiters</b> omitted their titles, {{at least in my}} hearing.|$|R
60|$|It {{is hard to}} astonish <b>the</b> <b>waiters</b> at a New York restaurant, {{but when}} the cat {{performed}} this feat there was a squeal of surprise all round <b>the</b> room. <b>Waiters</b> rushed to and fro, futile but energetic. The cat, having secured a strong strategic position {{on the top of}} a large oil-painting which hung on the far wall, was expressing loud disapproval of the efforts of one of <b>the</b> <b>waiters</b> to drive it from its post with a walking-stick. The young man, seeing these manoeuvres, uttered a wrathful shout, and rushed to the rescue.|$|R

500|$|In 1998, Boxtree UK {{published}} a Babylon 5 cookbook, officially licensed from Warner Bros. Presented as if written {{around the year}} 2260, the time {{when most of the}} Babylon 5 series takes place, the book contains many recipes for the various foods mentioned and seen throughout the series. Included are recipes for Narn-style spoo and Centauri-style spoo, both using currently available ingredients, with sea scallops taking the place of spoo. Straczynski claims that while dining in a restaurant prior to the 1996 Hugo award ceremony, [...] "a fan had <b>the</b> <b>waiter</b> bring over a tray of food, christened spoo".|$|E
500|$|The video {{begins at}} a formal party in which Spears {{seems to be}} looking for someone. The opening shot of her was {{inspired}} by the scene of Jennifer Love Hewitt walking into the party in Can't Hardly Wait (1998). Her boyfriend (Bradshaw) talks with two people next to her. He persuades her to smile to avoid embarrassment from the guests then verbally abuses her and grabs her face, after which she leaves to the restroom, where she wipes away a tear and puts on her fragrance Radiance. She comes back to the party and catches her boyfriend flirting with another woman; Spears tells her [...] "So you're not working the street corner tonight I see?", making her boyfriend angry. He apologizes to the other woman for his girlfriend's remark then grabs Spears by the arm and carries her outside the building. After he slaps her, one of the waiters of the party (Trawick) wearing a leather jacket punches her boyfriend several times. <b>The</b> <b>waiter</b> asks Spears if she is okay, and after she kicks her boyfriend in the crotch goodbye, she replies [...] "Now I'm okay." [...] She and <b>the</b> <b>waiter</b> climb on his motorcycle and leave the scene. When they get to his house, it is revealed by a newspaper that he is a criminal. She opens one of the lockers in his house and finds a gun, after which the couple kisses. This is followed by scenes of them having sex.|$|E
500|$|Julia Louis-Dreyfus guest-starred as Gloria in the episode. In the DVD audio {{commentary}} for the episode, current show runner Al Jean {{stated that}} working with Louis-Dreyfus was [...] "an absolute pleasure", stating that [...] "not only was she funny but you'd give her, like, one suggestion, and she'd do three great things with it." [...] <b>The</b> <b>waiter</b> in the Chinese restaurant was portrayed by actor George Takei. Dan Castellaneta, who plays Homer among several characters on the show, supplied the voice for Woody Allen, who {{is seen in}} a writing room for fortune cookies, wondering what he's doing there. The delivery boy was portrayed by Karl Wiedergott, a voice actor who usually fill in for the male actors on The Simpsons {{when they are not}} available for the table read. Jean described him as [...] "versatile" [...] and [...] "very talented".|$|E
60|$|They {{seemed to}} know Peggy at Rector's. Paul, <b>the</b> head <b>waiter,</b> beamed upon her paternally. One or two men turned and looked after her as she passed. <b>The</b> <b>waiters</b> smiled slight but {{friendly}} smiles. Rutherford, intent on her, noticed none of these things.|$|R
60|$|Bazzard returned, {{accompanied}} by two waiters—an immovable waiter, and a flying waiter; {{and the three}} brought in with them as much fog as gave a new roar to the fire. <b>The</b> flying <b>waiter,</b> who had brought everything on his shoulders, laid the cloth with amazing rapidity and dexterity; while <b>the</b> immovable <b>waiter,</b> who had brought nothing, found fault with him. <b>The</b> flying <b>waiter</b> then highly polished all the glasses he had brought, and <b>the</b> immovable <b>waiter</b> looked through them. <b>The</b> flying <b>waiter</b> then flew across Holborn for the soup, and flew back again, and then took another flight for the made-dish, and flew back again, and then took another flight for the joint and poultry, and flew back again, and between whiles took supplementary flights for {{a great variety of}} articles, as it was discovered from time to time that <b>the</b> immovable <b>waiter</b> had forgotten them all. But let <b>the</b> flying <b>waiter</b> cleave <b>the</b> air as he might, he was always reproached on his return by <b>the</b> immovable <b>waiter</b> for bringing fog with him, and being out of breath. At the conclusion of the repast, by which time <b>the</b> flying <b>waiter</b> was severely blown, <b>the</b> immovable <b>waiter</b> gathered up <b>the</b> tablecloth under his arm with a grand air, and having sternly (not to say with indignation) looked on at <b>the</b> flying <b>waiter</b> while he set the clean glasses round, directed a valedictory glance towards Mr. Grewgious, conveying: ‘Let it be clearly understood between us that the reward is mine, and that Nil is the claim of this slave,’ and pushed <b>the</b> flying <b>waiter</b> before him out of the room.|$|R
