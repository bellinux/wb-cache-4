50|$|Papers {{released}} by The National Archives, London, November 2007, show that Crookshank, with Harold Macmillan, led a faction within the Cabinet of Sir Winston Churchill's government, who opposed what they {{perceived to be}} an attempt to bounce the Cabinet into <b>a</b> premature decision <b>to</b> <b>authorise</b> <b>a</b> British thermonuclear bomb programme in July 1954.|$|R

50|$|Kokkina was {{regarded}} by Grivas {{as a major}} coastal beachhead for Turkey to land weapons in Cyprus, {{with the aim of}} arming the Turkish Cypriots.

50|$|The {{success of}} Ben Hur {{encouraged}} Siegel <b>to</b> <b>authorise</b> <b>a</b> series of remakes at MGM such as The Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse, Cimarron and Mutiny on the Bounty.

5000|$|Since {{responsibility}} for drawing federal and provincial electoral boundaries was {{handed over to}} independent agencies, this problem has largely been eliminated at these levels of government. Manitoba was the first province <b>to</b> <b>authorise</b> <b>a</b> non-partisan group <b>to</b> define constituency boundaries in the 1950s.

25|$|The Carlton route, as sanctioned to the Company, was {{for single}} line with passing loops, {{a type of}} {{construction}} not favoured by the Corporation, and during {{the construction of the}} various routes within the city, endeavours had always been made to have property demolished in order to widen the roadways, making them suitable for double track. A new Bill was therefore introduced by the Corporation <b>to</b> <b>authorise</b> <b>a</b> double line <b>to</b> Carlton, but owing to the dissolution of Parliament it was not passed until 1910.|$|R
25|$|In July 2008, Hilary Benn, {{the then}} Secretary of State for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs, refused <b>to</b> <b>authorise</b> <b>a</b> badger cull {{because of the}} practicalities and cost of a cull and the scale and length of time {{required}} to implement it, with no guarantee of success {{and the potential for}} making the disease worse.

The calls of the party for members of the military to resist orders ("If you must shoot, don't shoot the workers") caused the new Attorney General, Douglas Hogg, with the overt encouragement of the Home Secretary, William Joynson Hicks, <b>to</b> <b>authorise</b> <b>a</b> fresh prosecution under the Incitement to Mutiny Act.|$|R

50|$|The {{policy of}} {{diverting}} V-1 impacts away from central London was initially controversial. The War Cabinet refused <b>to</b> <b>authorise</b> <b>a</b> {{measure that would}} increase casualties in any area, even if it reduced casualties elsewhere by greater amounts. It was thought that Churchill would reverse this decision later (he was then away at a conference); but the delay in starting the reports to Germans might be fatal to the deception. So Sir Findlater Stewart of Home Defence Executive took responsibility for starting the deception programme immediately, and his action was approved by Churchill when he returned.|$|R
5000|$|A further {{bill was}} {{presented}} to Parliament in 1759, <b>to</b> <b>authorise</b> <b>an</b> extension of the navigation for a further 4.5 mi up to Godalming. It was not successful, but an Act of Parliament was obtained in the following year. John Smeaton and then Richard Steadman acted as engineers. The work involved the construction of another four locks, and the project cost £6,450. The Godalming Navigation opened for trade in 1763, and was managed by Commissioners, who formed a separate legal entity to {{those responsible for the}} navigation below Guildford.|$|R
5000|$|After a {{long and}} bitter {{political}} struggle, the parliamentary majority of the local [...] "Responsibles" [...] caused the British Governor <b>to</b> <b>authorise</b> <b>a</b> Bill for self-government to be drafted. Griffith flatly refused to draft it, and took a strategic [...] "leave of absence" [...] to London. As the Attorney General was required for such a bill, Griffith's disappearance caused a serious hitch. However parliament sent for Mr Jacobs, who had long been Griffith's long-suffering right-hand man, and who was consequently very happy to travel from Grahamstown to draft the bill, outmanoeuvring the hated attorney general.|$|R
5000|$|Borges was {{reluctant}} <b>to</b> <b>authorise</b> <b>a</b> translation.

50|$|Both {{parties were}} urged to honour their commitments, attain an {{effective}} ceasefire immediately and {{to reach a}} peace settlement, demanding that all military operations cease. After extending the stationing of UNAVEM II, the Council declared its readiness <b>to</b> <b>authorise</b> <b>an</b> increase in the peacekeeping mission to its previous level of 350 military observers, 126 police observers and 14 military medical staff with an appropriate number of international and local civilian staff. Any actions which hindered the delivery of humanitarian assistance and endangered the lives of humanitarian workers was condemned, while the international community was urged to provide assistance in this regard.|$|R
50|$|Sancho's {{policy of}} {{intervention}} in Occitania was opposed by a faction of Aragonese feudatories led by his nephew, Ferdinand, abbot of Montearagón, and {{by those who}} wished {{to make peace with}} the Papacy. Ferdinand even encouraged local rebellions in Huesca, Jaca and Zaragoza. In two bulls dated 28 and 29 December 1217, Pope Honorius III threatened to excommunicate James and Sancho, respectively, and <b>to</b> <b>authorise</b> <b>a</b> crusade against their realm if they did not abandon Raymond VI's cause. Under pressure from several sides and apparently unwilling to abandon the Toulousain alliance, Sancho stepped down as regent.|$|R

It demonstrates that when deciding whether <b>to</b> <b>authorise</b> <b>a</b> surrogacy arrangement, there is often a conflict between the enforcement statutory provisions, and the welfare of the child who will bear the burden of any refusal to grant a parental order. As a result, courts have been forced to interpret the legislation in an innovative manner in order to achieve justice for the child...|$|R

Further concessions were obtained by the other two canal companies by threats to resurrect the plans on two subsequent occasions.|$|R

The debt ceiling is also a limitation on the federal government's ability to finance government operations, and the failure of Congress <b>to</b> <b>authorise</b> <b>an</b> increase in the debt ceiling has resulted in crises, especially in recent years.
