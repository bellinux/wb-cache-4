5000|$|Blowoff valves {{are used}} to prevent {{compressor}} surge, a phenomenon that readily occurs when lifting off the throttle of an unvented, turbocharged engine. The sound produced is called turbo flutter ( [...] the slang term ' choo-choo' is sometimes used [...] ). When the throttle plate on a turbocharged engine closes, the high pressure air in the intake system is trapped by the throttle and a pressure wave is forced back into the compressor. The compressor wheel slows rapidly and can sometimes stall, and the driver will notice a fluttering air sound. The effect is similar to how planes' wings stall if not enough air is flowing past them. The rapid slowing or stalling stresses the <b>turbo</b> <b>compressor</b> and can impart severe turbo lag depending on how fast the driver accelerates immediately after the surge event and how much psi the turbocharger is set up for.|$|E

40|$|<b>Turbo</b> <b>compressors</b> can {{generate}} tonal noise in a frequency range of 1000 to 5000 Hz, which may cause nuisance {{in the environment}} where the machine is installed. The cause of this tonal noise is {{the interaction between the}} flow and the rotating blades inside the compressor. The noise is transmitted from the compressor into the pipe system at both suction and discharge sides. Then it is radiated from the pipe walls to the environment. As this noise source can’t be avoided, if necessary a silencer can be installed between the compressor and the pipe system. The silencer blocks the transmission of the noise. The most common type of silencer for this application is the so-called absorption type. However, due to high flow velocities and vibrations, the absorption material may deteriorate and be blown away. A sturdier silencer type has been developed based on rigid acoustic resonators. In this paper the development process is described.

30|$|Natural gas is an {{important}} non-renewable energy source. It {{is used as a}} fuel source in domestic cooking, in industrial processes as raw material, for generating electricity in power plants and in transport vehicles. To transport gas to consumers requires a gas pipeline network that includes several pipes of same or different diameters, valves and compressor stations. When gas is transported through the pipeline network, the pressure of the gas is lost due to friction of gas molecules with pipe wall and irregular elevation terrain. Normally, 3 % of the total gas supplied through the pipeline network is consumed in natural gas-run turbine compressors (Carter 1996). Pipelines are used for transporting huge amounts of natural gas, and therefore, this loss is immense. A very small percentage of fuel savings in turbines will result in huge currency savings. Upgrading pipeline transport performance by reducing consumption of natural gas in turbines used for running compressors is henceforth a critical issue (Arya and Honwad 2015). The other extremely intriguing issue is a multiobjective problem of minimizing fuel usage in <b>turbo</b> <b>compressors</b> and maximizing the gas delivery at the delivery station. The paper addresses the multiobjective optimization model for achieving the maximum throughput at minimum fuel consumption.|$|R
40|$|Gas {{compression}} in {{a positive}} displacement (PD) type piston engine, or piston compressor, has long been modeled as a quasi-static {{process in which the}} piston is assumed to move infinitely slow inside a cylinder. The gas compression mechanism is therefore regarded as being governed by the basic thermodynamic principles. Energy transfer is accomplished quasi-statically with a piston reducing the volume a little at a time, small perturbation, while increasing gas pressure simultaneously. This is in direct contrast to a dynamic type gas compressor such as <b>turbo</b> <b>compressor</b> that achieves energy transfer by initially imparting kinetic energy to the gas and then converting that kinetic energy to gas pressure. Is the quasi-static hypothesis still valid today with the quantum leaps made in piston speeds since the Watt’s days? Moreover, exactly how is the work done by the moving piston converted to gas pressure? This paper attempts to answer these questions by applying the classic shock tube theory to the transient dynamic process of high speed piston compression. The results reveal that the nature of the compression is in essence a dynamic process by actions of a pair of moving shock waves triggered by fast piston movement. A transient dynamic stage of a piston compression consists of a rotor with incident shock wave (ISW) compression and a stator with reflected shock wave (RSW) compression during a finite time interval; or a stage cycle of ?t. The resulting energy transfer process is thus similar to that of a <b>turbo</b> <b>compressor</b> characterized by initially imparting kinetic energy to the gas through ISW action and then converting the kinetic energy to pressure by RSW reaction...|$|E

The silencers usually contain resonators with slits, perforates and cavities. The purpose of the work reported is to develop acoustic models for these resonators where relevant effects such as the effect of realistic mean flow on losses and possibly 3 D effects are considered. An experimental campaign has been undertaken where the two-port matrices and transmission loss of four sample resonators has been measured without flow and for two different mean flow speeds (M= 0. 05 & M= 0. 1) using two source location technique. Models for the four resonators have been developed using a 1 D linear acoustic code (SIDLAB) and a FEM code (COMSOL Multi-physics). Different models, from the literature, for including the effect of mean flow on the acoustic losses at slits and perforates have been discussed. Correct modeling of acoustic losses for resonators with complicated geometry is important for the simulation and development of new and improved silencers, and the present work contributes to this understanding.

This might be the OEM checking the feasibility of a proposed compressor layout or it might be the user judging one of his machines which causes troubles in operation. API 617 suggests a stability level I or level II analysis. The shortcoming of the level I analysis is that it considers only the global cross-coupling stiffness of the entire stages neglecting the actual seal design of a compressor. Thus the damping of a machine is always decreasing with increasing load which is not reflecting the true stability behavior of modern <b>turbo</b> <b>compressors.</b> On the other hand a level II analysis requires detailed insight into the machine design which might not be defined at that time or which is not known to the user.

This tutorial derives the used stability criterion and explains the effect of the circumferential speed of the gas in the seal gap on the rotordynamic behavior.
