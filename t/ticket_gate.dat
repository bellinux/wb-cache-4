500|$|Public outrage from Montreal {{poured in}} about what {{residents}} felt was excessive punishment. Many Québécois regarded the suspension as the English minority further attempting to subjugate the French majority and {{an attempt to}} humiliate French Canadians by [...] "excessively punishing their favorite player". Campbell, who received death threats, stated {{that he would not}} back down and announced his intention to attend the Canadiens' next home game against the Red Wings on March 17, despite advice that he not do so. Hundreds of demonstrators gathered in the Montreal Forum lobby two hours before the game. Attempts to [...] "crash the gate" [...] by these fans without tickets were denied by police. They then began to gather at Cabot Square across from the Forum. The crowd of demonstrators grew to 6,000. Some carried signs that denounced Campbell, and others had signs reading, among other things, [...] "Vive Richard" [...] (Long live Richard), [...] "No Richard, no Cup", and [...] "Our national sport destroyed". The crowd, originally described as [...] "jovial", turned [...] "surly" [...] after police intervened at the <b>ticket</b> <b>gate.</b> After the mood turned foul, some members of the crowd began smashing windows and throwing ice chunks at passing streetcars.|$|E
