5|$|Once {{the athlete}} has taken flight, {{characteristics}} {{similar to that}} of a glider come into force. Ski flyers are able to cover such tremendous distances and land safely primarily due to <b>the</b> <b>skis</b> they use, which are substantially wider and longer than their cross-country or Alpine skiing counterparts. Each ski is first attached securely {{at the front of the}} boot, which has an exaggerated forward slant; the heel is then attached to a wedge on the ski using a hinged binding peg or strap with a maximum length of , allowing the athlete to lean forward into their preferred aerodynamic position and spread <b>the</b> <b>skis</b> wide apart. Much like aircraft wings, <b>the</b> <b>skis</b> are flexible to an extent, resulting in them bending and vibrating significantly upon takeoff. Maintaining stability in the air is paramount: a loss of balance, or a differential pressure under <b>the</b> <b>skis,</b> can lead to disaster (see list of ski flying accidents). A few athletes have a natural tendency to drift over to one side of the hill, invariably shortening their jump distance.|$|E
5|$|If {{conditions}} are normal {{and a green}} light is shown, the athlete's coach – who is situated in a coaches' section lower down the inrun with a flag in hand – gives them the final signal to go; coaches may sometimes have to whistle or give a shouted confirmation in low-visibility conditions. Once given this signal, the athlete must commit to their jump within ten seconds or else risk disqualification: {{they are not allowed}} to exit the gate from whence they came. To begin descending the inrun, they drop down from the gate to a crouching position. Speed is rapidly picked up within seconds via built-in tracks, made from porcelain or ceramic, into which <b>the</b> <b>skis</b> are slotted. The athlete's streamlined crouch minimises air resistance along the inrun, and a further effort is made to reduce friction by not allowing <b>the</b> <b>skis</b> (which have wax applied to them) to bump too much against the sides of the tracks. Speed is measured from the table using a speed gun.|$|E
5|$|It {{was during}} this time that the entire sport of ski jumping {{underwent}} a significant transition in technique. Until the early 1990s nearly all athletes used the parallel style (or Däscher technique), in which <b>the</b> <b>skis</b> are held close together and parallel to each other. This had been the norm since the 1950s, with Matti Nykänen creating {{a variation in the}} 1980s with <b>the</b> <b>skis</b> pointed diagonally off to the side in a crude attempt to increase surface area, which yielded more distance. However, this came largely at the expense of stability and balance, akin to 'walking a tightrope' in mid-air and leaving athletes {{at the mercy of the}} elements. Akimoto, Findeisen, Berg, and Goldberger's accidents were all caused by unpredictable gusts of wind that made them lose control at the highest and fastest stage of their jumps, exacerbated by an outdated technique ill-suited to the new extremes of ski flying, as well as the prevalence of older hills featuring very steep slopes.|$|E
50|$|At the 1936 Winter Olympics, {{the venue}} hosted <b>the</b> <b>ski</b> jumping event and <b>the</b> <b>ski</b> jumping {{part of the}} Nordic {{combined}} event. The outrun of <b>the</b> <b>ski</b> jump formed <b>the</b> <b>ski</b> stadium which held the opening and closing ceremonies and the start / finish area of <b>the</b> cross-country <b>skiing</b> competitions.|$|R
50|$|Okurayama and Miyanomori {{would serve}} as <b>the</b> <b>ski</b> jumping venues for <b>the</b> <b>ski</b> jumping and <b>the</b> <b>ski</b> jumping portion of the Nordic {{combined}} events when Sapporo hosted the FIS Nordic World Ski Championships in 2007. It has been on <b>the</b> <b>Ski</b> Jumping World Cup circuit on an almost annual basis since 1980.|$|R
5|$|Events under <b>the</b> <b>Ski</b> Flying World Cup {{have several}} {{differences}} to <b>the</b> <b>Ski</b> Flying World Championships. The latter is an isolated tournament, or one-off event, {{in the same}} vein as <b>the</b> <b>Ski</b> Jumping World Championships and Winter Olympics, whereas <b>the</b> <b>Ski</b> Flying World Cup is part of <b>the</b> overall <b>Ski</b> Jumping World Cup season, and uses the same points system. These points contribute towards both Ski Flying and Ski Jumping World Cup standings; the former being effectively a 'mini season' within the latter. However, a feature shared with <b>the</b> <b>Ski</b> Flying World Championships is that the starting order switches over from <b>the</b> <b>Ski</b> Jumping World Cup standings to <b>the</b> <b>Ski</b> Flying World Cup standings after the first competition of the latter, and remains that way for all subsequent events.|$|R
5|$|The underpowered engines {{made the}} fighter sluggish, and the hydro-skis {{were not as}} {{successful}} as hoped; they created violent vibration during takeoff and landing, despite the shock-absorbing oleo legs they were extended on. Work on <b>the</b> <b>skis</b> and legs improved this situation somewhat, but {{they were unable to}} resolve the sluggish performance. The Sea Dart proved incapable of supersonic speed in level flight with the J34 engines; not helping was its pre-area rule shape, which meant higher transonic drag.|$|E
5|$|However, {{there is}} {{a fine line between}} {{aggressiveness}} and over-aggressiveness at takeoff. One of the most common mistakes made by athletes, including those at world class level, is to raise the ski tips too much during the transition. This excessive angle of attack causes <b>the</b> <b>skis</b> to act more as a spoiler than an efficient aerodynamic device, resulting in more height than distance; a flight curve that is too steep or shallow is unfavourable. In a well-executed jump, athletes will spend several seconds longer in the air than in ski jumping – up to five seconds more – which requires a different level of skill in order to sustain flight for a longer period, and showcases how the role of aerodynamics is magnified in ski flying. Not all athletes who excel in ski jumping are able do so in ski flying (see the section on specialists), and it can be difficult for them to hone their skills in the latter due to the hills being off-limits when competitions are not staged.|$|E
5|$|The {{ultimate}} {{aim is to}} land on, or ideally surpass, a line marked {{across the}} hill called the 'K-point', 'critical point', or 'calculation line'. In order to attain the most points from the style judges, athletes strive for a 'Telemark' landing: instead of landing with simply both feet together (a 'two-footed' landing), one foot is planted clearly {{in front of the}} other (without sliding <b>the</b> <b>skis),</b> both feet held no more than four ski widths' apart, and the body held stable with a straight back and arms outstretched. This pose must be maintained until the 'outrun' – a line at the very end of the hill, where the slope has fully flattened out – is reached. The exact placement of landing is measured between the athlete's front and back feet. Failing to make a Telemark landing results in a loss of style points. Considerably more points are lost if a landing fails before the outrun line, such as falling over or touching the ground with any part of the body except the feet. However, when the hill begins to flatten out, it becomes increasingly difficult to make a Telemark landing.|$|E
50|$|In waterskiing, a bevel is the {{transition}} {{area between the}} side of <b>the</b> <b>ski</b> and <b>the</b> bottom of <b>the</b> <b>ski.</b> Beginners tend to prefer sharp bevels, which allow <b>the</b> <b>ski</b> to glide on the water surface.|$|R

50|$|Carving {{is based}} on the shape of <b>the</b> <b>ski</b> itself; when <b>the</b> <b>ski</b> is rotated onto its edge, the pattern cut into its side causes it to bend into an arc. The contact between the arc of <b>the</b> <b>ski</b> edges and <b>the</b> snow {{naturally}} causes <b>the</b> <b>ski</b> to tend to move along that arc, slowing the skier and changing their direction of motion.|$|R
25|$|In {{the case}} of {{snowmobile}} racing, the yellow flag is displayed at or before {{the point of the}} hazard. When a snowmobile racer crosses the yellow flag, the race will continue, however, <b>the</b> <b>skis</b> and track of the snowmobile must remain on the ground.|$|E
25|$|Sit-skis are {{designed}} for wheelchair users or other skiers with a form of paraplegia. The first sit-ski was built in 1967 by Josef Shrall from the Bavaria region of Germany. Early sit-skis used in para-alpine skiing had two wide skis, brakes, and were custom built to fit the specific skier. The weight of the ski prevented skiers from skiing moguls or steep slopes. Sit-ski development continued into the 1980s, with a more modern version demonstrated in Engelberg, Switzerland in 1987 at a workshop hosted by the Swiss Association of Paraplegics. As the technology advanced, a chair was developed that could be attached to <b>the</b> <b>skis</b> which were used by able-bodied skiers. They are now made from fibreglass and polyester, and the weight has been dramatically reduced, allowing skiers to ski on steeper slopes and compete in the moguls. Current sit-skis include seat-belts. As skis for able-bodied skiers have evolved to specialise for the event, <b>the</b> <b>skis</b> that sit-skiers use have also changed.|$|E
25|$|In 1955, Stroukoff, under {{contract}} from the USAF, produced a single YC-123E, designed {{to be able to}} take off from any surface, and also equipped with BLC. The new aircraft also featured Stroukoff's Pantobase system, combining a ski system with a sealed fuselage and wing mounted floats, while retaining its normal landing gear. <b>The</b> <b>skis</b> worked both on snow and water, and the system effectively allowed the aircraft to land on water, land, snow or ice.|$|E
40|$|AbstractBased on {{the actual}} {{measurement}} on <b>the</b> <b>ski</b> deflection, ski-snow contacting pressure, boot-ski load, turn radius, snow groove geometry in a carved turn and the bending stiffness distribution of <b>the</b> <b>ski,</b> mutual relations have been investigated to elucidate the ski-snow interaction mechanism. Boot-ski load and the contacting pressure distribution on the running surface satisfy force equilibrium and moment equilibrium. The deflection of <b>the</b> <b>ski</b> is related with the moment distribution and bending stiffness distribution of <b>the</b> <b>ski.</b> <b>The</b> pattern of the pressure distribution changed with the bending stiffness distribution of <b>the</b> <b>ski</b> on <b>the</b> same hardness of the snow in the measurement...|$|R
40|$|Recently, various {{goods for}} a ski have been {{developed}} and attached to <b>the</b> <b>ski</b> for improving a skiing characteristic.

25|$|Petrov became {{commander}} of the 3rd Squadron of the 68th Fighter Aviation Regiment in the Winter War. He made several victory claims during the war. On 17 February 1940, on Lake Muola-Jarvi, pilot N. Kosichkin was shot down and crash landed on the ice. Petrov landed and strapped Kosichkin to <b>the</b> <b>skis</b> of his I-15bis under Finnish fire. When Petrov landed at his base, there were about 100 holes in the fuselage of his plane. On 7 April 1940, Petrov was awarded the title Hero of the Soviet Union and the Order of Lenin, becoming the first person born in Karelia to receive the distinction.|$|E
25|$|Skiers in this {{classification}} {{compete with}} two skis and two ski poles in both para-Alpine and para-Nordic skiing. During training, skiers may use prosthesis, cants, wedges, ski-bras, outriggers or short skis. For skiers using a prosthesis, a special skiing prosthesis is used {{and they may}} also require the user of outriggers. The nature of their disability will dictate the type of equipment required. Ski bras are devices clamped to the tips of skis, which result in <b>the</b> <b>skis</b> being attached to each other. Outriggers are forearm crutches with a miniature ski on a rocker at the base. Cants are wedges that sit under the binding that are intended to more evenly distribute weight. They are customised for {{the specific needs of}} the skier. The ski boot for below the knee amputees often has the prosthetic built into it, though for all competitors in this class, FIS rules for para-Alpine ski boots and binding heights are modified for this class from rules applied to able bodied competitor's equipment. In the Biathlon, athletes with amputations can use a rifle support while shooting.|$|E
25|$|LW1 {{classified}} skiers use outriggers, and two skis or one ski with a prosthesis. International Ski Federation {{rules for}} ski boots and binding heights are modified for this class {{and are not}} the same rules used for able-bodied skiers. Skiers in this class are allowed to use ski-tips in competition, using a setup sometimes called a Four Track. In training, they may use additional equipment. For example, skiers with cerebral palsy may use cants, wedges, ski-bras, outriggers or short skis depending on the nature of their disability. Skiers with an amputation may use a prosthesis. As skiers in this classification improve, they require less use of this equipment. Ski bras are devices clamped to the tips of skis, which result in <b>the</b> <b>skis</b> being attached to each other. Outriggers are forearm crutches with a miniature ski on a rocker at the base. Cants are wedges that sit under the binding that are intended to more evenly distribute weight, and are customised for the specific needs of the skier.

50|$|The {{solution}} to the turning problem had already long been used in <b>the</b> <b>ski</b> industry, <b>the</b> used of spring steel edges.

500|$|The {{aircraft}} {{was to be}} a delta-winged fighter with a watertight hull and twin retractable hydro-skis for takeoff and landing.

500|$|The classic {{style is}} often used on {{prepared}} trails (pistes) that have pairs of parallel grooves (tracks) cut into the snow. It {{is also the most}} usual technique where no tracks have been prepared. With this technique, each ski is pushed forward from the other stationary ski in a striding and gliding motion, alternating foot to foot. With the [...] "diagonal stride" [...] variant the poles are planted alternately {{on the opposite side of}} the forward-striding foot; with the [...] "kick-double-pole" [...] variant the poles are planted simultaneously with every other stride. At times, especially with gentle descents, double poling is the sole means of propulsion. On uphill terrain, techniques include the [...] "side step" [...] for steep slopes, moving <b>the</b> <b>skis</b> perpendicular to the fall line, the [...] "herringbone" [...] for moderate slopes, where the skier takes alternating steps with <b>the</b> <b>skis</b> splayed outwards, and, for gentle slopes, the skier uses the diagonal technique with shorter strides and greater arm force on the poles.|$|E
500|$|In classic {{cross-country}} skiing <b>the</b> <b>skis</b> remain parallel, as the skier strides straight ahead. The undersides of <b>the</b> <b>skis</b> have a grip {{section in the}} middle treated with a special ski wax that provides friction when the foot is still, yet glides when the foot is in motion, {{while the rest of}} the ski bottom has a glide wax. Classic events occur on courses with tracks set by a grooming machine at precise intervals and with carefully planned curvature. Both poles may be used simultaneously ("double-poling") or with alternating foot and arm extended (as with running or walking) with the pole pushing on the side opposite of the extended, sliding ski. In classic skiing the alternating technique is used for the [...] "diagonal stride"—the predominant classic sub-technique. In diagonal-stride legs move like in ordinary walking, but with longer and more powerful steps. Diagonal is useful on level ground and on gentle uphill slopes. Uphill steps are shorter and more frequent. With double-poling both poles are used simultaneously for thrust, which may be augmented with striding. Double-poling is useful on level ground and on gentle downhill slopes. On steep uphills fishbone technique can be used.|$|E
5|$|Ski flying events {{outside of}} the World Championships are a regular feature on <b>the</b> <b>Ski</b> Jumping World Cup calendar, usually {{occurring}} on two or three hills only.
