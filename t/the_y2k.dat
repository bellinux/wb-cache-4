5|$|On a computer, if {{the result}} of an {{addition}} is too large to store, an arithmetic overflow occurs, resulting in an incorrect answer. Unanticipated arithmetic overflow is a fairly common cause of program errors.

One especially notable such error was <b>the</b> <b>Y2K</b> bug, where overflow errors due to using a 2-digit format for years caused significant computer problems in 2000.|$|E

By 2000, 80% of U.S. banks offered e-banking. Customer use grew slowly. At Bank of America, for example, it took 10 years to acquire 2 million e-banking customers.
