25|$|Proposals for {{a railway}} to Brevik were first put forward in 1875, {{but not until}} 4 July 1891 did Parliament pass {{legislation}} to build the line. The main proponent for the line was Brevik Municipality, while Eidanger Municipality was less eager. Brevik therefore agreed <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>for</b> <b>all</b> expropriations for the right-of-way within Eidanger. However, Eidanger Municipality wanted {{a branch of the}} Brevik Line to Eidangerfjorden somewhere south of Nystrand, but this was never fulfilled.|$|E

25|$|Most of {{the railway}} would {{be located in}} the former Eidanger Municipality. Eidanger Municipal Council was not {{particularly}} interested in the railway, and was not willing to pay for expropriation in their own municipality. Thus Brevik Municipality was forced <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>for</b> <b>all</b> expropriation along the line and limited their support for the entire project to NOK16,000. Brevik Municipal Council passed the plans and their financing on 31 March 1893. However, there was not community consensus as to the location of Brevik Station, with large camps each preferring Strømtangen and Setretangen. The municipal council voted in favor of Strømtangen on 25 June.|$|E
25|$|New York State Route990L (NY990L) is a {{reference}} route in Chenango County, New York, in the United States. The western terminus {{of the route}} is at an intersection with NY12 {{in the city of}} Norwich. Its eastern terminus is at a junction with NY23 in the town of Norwich. NY990L is one of four reference routes in New York that has been erroneously signed as a touring route. The highway is known as East Main Street in the city of Norwich and as East River Road in the town of Norwich. Both roads were designated state arterial highways in 1954, requiring the state <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>for</b> <b>all</b> maintenance on the roads.|$|E
25|$|The Richard E. Jacobs Group had {{constructed}} Society Center for Society National Bank. The 57-story skyscraper, Cleveland's tallest building, opened in January 1992. In February 1996, KeyCorp leased eight floors in the McDonald Investment Center and three floors at Society Center, but agreed <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>for</b> <b>all</b> the operational costs at Society Center. On March 8, 1996, the Jacobs Group acquired the Cleveland Trust Company Building for $10. KeyCorp {{agreed to the}} extremely low purchase price because it had assumed control of Society Center. Society Center was renamed Key Tower on March 20, With all banking operations now centralized in Key Tower, the Cleveland Trust Company Building and the Cleveland Trust Tower were no longer needed.

25|$|In fall 2003, Nadeau began {{discussions with}} MB2 Motorsports boss Jay Frye about a {{long-term}} comeback. Frye gave Nadeau a test at Concord Speedway, {{where he was}} unable to feel his car's brake pedal. He also suffered a loss of stamina during this test. Because of the effects of his accident, Nadeau had to learn to walk. He also experienced slurred speech. He undertook physical therapy five times during the week. This was later reduced to three when his condition improved. While Nadeau received a small financial settlement from NASCAR, it was not enough <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>for</b> <b>all</b> of his rehabilitation, so he sold his large house near Lake Norman and moved to Davidson, North Carolina. He also suffered from depression caused by the loss of his racing career.|$|E
25|$|To ensure {{every single}} {{operation}} showed a clear profit {{on a full}} costing basis, i.e. inclusive of all overhead costs, the company required each operation to be budgeted in detail before deciding whether to accept it. The managing director's authorisation was required to dispense with this rule in exceptional cases where the risk of accepting a contract that was only marginally profitable, i.e. excluding overheads, was outweighed by {{the risk of having}} an aircraft sit idly on the ground. An immediate financial analysis that compared actual costs and revenues with their budgets followed the completion of each flight, thereby instantly gauging that flight's profitability and validating the effectiveness of the firm's pricing policy. A policy of requiring aircraft commanders <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>for</b> <b>all</b> operating expenses other than fuel in cash proved to be an effective method to exercise instant cost control over fees and charges incurred for products and services supplied by third parties, such as ground handling fees, technical support services and catering supplies.|$|E
25|$|The largest {{departure}} made by Galactic Civilizations II {{from other}} 4X games is its economic system, {{which is very}} different from the systems used in most strategy games. Typically, 4X strategy games receive money based on a tax rate or based on the income of specific tiles in use by a city or planet. Civilization IV uses this system, and most other 4X strategy games use a variant of it. These incomes are increased by economic structures and sometimes by population, and the profit made off this economic income is used to pay maintenance fees and rush-build units. Galactic Civilizations II adds another layer of complexity by requiring that the income of an empire is used <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>for</b> <b>all</b> forms of production. In order to produce one unit of product, be it research or manufacturing, the player must pay credits (usually in denominations of a Billion Credits, or BC). It is therefore critical that the player balances the economic income of their empire with their industrial output, and not just with the maintenance of their empire. If the player does not have the economy required to support an industrial planet, then they will have to spend at a deficit, and if the player does not correct their economy, they will eventually go broke. This stands in stark contrast to the Civilization series, where industrial output has nothing to do with the player's economic income.|$|E

500|$|The {{most famous}} of the {{disagreements}} concerns the level of increased rent Everton were asked to pay.

500|$|One {{of the key}} {{aspects of}} any charter party is the freight rate, or the price {{specified}} for carriage of cargo. [...] The freight rate of a tanker charter party is specified in one of four ways: by a lump sum rate, by rate per ton, by a time charter equivalent rate, or by Worldscale rate. In a lump sum rate arrangement, a fixed price is negotiated for the delivery of a specified cargo, and the ship's owner/operator is responsible <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>for</b> <b>all</b> port costs and other voyage expenses. [...] Rate per ton arrangements are used mostly in chemical tanker chartering, and differ from lump sum rates in that port costs and voyage expenses are generally paid by the charterer. Time charter arrangements specify a daily rate, and port costs and voyage expenses are also generally paid by the charterer.|$|E

500|$|Around {{this same}} time, the thirty-two year-old Phips {{had made his}} way to England, where he gained an {{audience}} with Narborough and Charles II. [...] By any measure, this was a remarkable achievement for a poor New Englander like Phips, but it also seems clear that he must have been at {{the right place at the}} right time. His reputation for finding sunken ships may have preceded him, and he seems to have had demonstrable gains to show, as one letter writer mentions his 'late successful returns.' Perhaps he delivered the King's portion of these returns to Whitehall in person? [...] In any case, a reckless plan was concocted, probably by Narborough, whereby this New England native, despite having no background in the English navy, would be assigned as the commander of a 20-gun frigate, HMS Rose of Algiers for a treasure hunt, but given no other financial backing. He and his crew would be required <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>for</b> <b>all</b> other expenses of the voyage, including food and diving equipment, and give a deposit of £100. Of the treasure they found, 35% would go to the King, and the rest would be divided among the otherwise unpaid crew.|$|E

500|$|The British and Americans {{exchanged}} nuclear {{information but}} did not initially combine their efforts. Britain rebuffed attempts by Bush and Conant in 1941 to strengthen cooperation with its own project, codenamed Tube Alloys, because it was reluctant to share its technological lead and help the United States develop its own atomic bomb. An American scientist who brought a personal letter from Roosevelt to Churchill offering <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>for</b> <b>all</b> research and development in an Anglo-American project was poorly treated, and Churchill did not reply to the letter. The United States as a result decided as early as April 1942 that if its offer was rejected, they should proceed alone. The British, who had made significant contributions early in the war, {{did not have the}} resources to carry through such a research program while fighting for their survival. As a result, Tube Alloys soon fell behind its American counterpart. and on 30 July 1942, Sir John Anderson, the minister responsible for Tube Alloys, advised Churchill that: [...] "We must face the fact that... pioneering work... is a dwindling asset and that, unless we capitalise it quickly, we shall be outstripped. We now have a real contribution to make to a 'merger.' Soon we shall have little or none." [...] That month Churchill and Roosevelt made an informal, unwritten agreement for atomic collaboration.|$|E

500|$|Sidney Lynne and John Hefferin {{purchased}} {{the house for}} $469,900 in 2004 after it had been unoccupied {{for more than a}} year. By then, the structure had developed leaks and displayed cracks along the foundation, walls and ceiling. In 2006, a falling tree caused stones to break away, damaging the house's main gas line. The couple spent $200,000 over four years to reinforce the walls. Lynne and Hefferin also constructed exterior stairs and an underground retaining wall. However, the renovation process was not completed, as they were unable <b>to</b> <b>pay</b> <b>for</b> <b>all</b> repairs required by the city, which had issued $20,000 in fines on the property. The couple also struggled to pay for costly landslide prevention efforts, rising property taxes and high heating bills. Canterbury Castle was listed for sale in the summer of 2008 for $2million. Lynne invited local interior design students and contractors to upgrade the house's interior, without success. The couple left the house in January 2009, and ownership was turned over to JPMorgan Chase. Lynne began a [...] "one-woman crusade" [...] to save the castle, seeking assistance from Portland City Commissioner Randy Leonard and from home improvement expert and This Old House host Bob Vila. In February 2009, the city's bureau of development services found that unstable soil and the risk of stones separating from sheeting underneath posed a landslide risk. The property had missing stones and thick cracks several feet long, which presented hazards to residents and the street below. Rumors of demolition began to surface in March 2009.|$|E
