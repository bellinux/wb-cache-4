Instead, the note supported the state court who had applied the law as the Supreme Court had in the past.|$|E

However, the season featured Cyclone Fantala, which became the strongest tropical cyclone on record in the basin in terms of 10-minute sustained winds at 250km/h (155mph).|$|E
5|$|In 1965 Hornchurch Urban District was {{abolished}} and {{its former}} area was transferred from Essex to Greater London, {{to be combined}} {{with that of the}} Municipal Borough of Romford in order to form the present-day London Borough of Havering.

5|$|Beginning around 1238, {{the castle}} was {{expanded}} to the east, north, and north-west. The work lasted through {{the reign of}} HenryIII and into that of EdwardI, interrupted occasionally by civil unrest. New creations included a new defensive perimeter, studded with towers, while on the west, north, and east sides, where the wall was not defended by the river, a defensive ditch was dug. The eastern extension took the castle beyond <b>the</b> <b>bounds</b> of the old Roman settlement, marked by the city wall which had been incorporated into the castle's defences. The Tower had long been a symbol of oppression, despised by Londoners, and Henry's building programme was unpopular. So when the gatehouse collapsed in 1240, the locals celebrated the setback. The expansion caused disruption locally and £166 was paid to St Katherine's Hospital and the prior of Holy Trinity in compensation.|$|E
5|$|Despite his severe manner Stevenson was {{extremely}} sociable, {{and he was}} often the centre of a lively crowd at the bar of the Garrick Club, {{of which he was}} a member. His home on the Sussex coast was called Truncheons, sometimes taken to reflect his authoritarian views, but the area had been known by that name for many years before his arrival. Following his retirement Stevenson called for the restoration of the death penalty for all murders, and made frequent guest appearances on television until his health and eyesight began to fail. Among the programmes he took part in was Granada Television's six-part series <b>The</b> <b>Bounds</b> of Freedom, broadcast in 1979.|$|E

5|$|Following {{the issues}} with the {{publishing}} of Killing Time, there was increased oversight by Roddenberry's staff regarding the novels published by Pocket Books. This was delegated to Arnold, and would later cause confusion for Pocket Books as comments would be sent back and it was sometimes unclear whether they were from Roddenberry or Arnold. These comments rejected plot developments in the novels where they were stepping out of <b>the</b> <b>bounds</b> set by the television series. Rumours subsequently spread {{that there was an}} alternative version of the manuscript with more explicit Kirk/Spock slash details, something that Van Hise later denied.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Able in 1951 was {{initially}} {{thought to be}} the earliest forming major hurricane– a tropical cyclone with winds exceeding – however following post-storm analysis it was determined that Able only reached Category 1strength which made Hurricane Alma of 1966 the new record holder; as it became a major hurricane on June8. Though it developed within <b>the</b> <b>bounds</b> of the Atlantic hurricane season, Hurricane Audrey in 1957 became the earliest developing Category4 hurricane on record after it reached the intensity on June27. However, reanalysis from 1956 to 1960 by NOAA downgraded Audrey to a Category 3, making Hurricane Dennis of 2005 the earliest Category 4 on record on July 8, 2005. The earliest-forming Category5 hurricane, Emily, reached the highest intensity on the Saffir–Simpson hurricane wind scale on July17, 2005.|$|E
5|$|In 1876, Frederick Law Olmsted {{was hired}} to survey the Bronx and map out streets based on the local geography. Olmsted noted {{the natural beauty of}} the Van Cortlandt estate, {{comparing}} it to Central Park which he designed, and recommended the city purchase the property. The land was part of a proposed greenbelt across the Bronx, consisting of parks and parkways that would align more with existing geography than a grid system similar to the Commissioners' Plan of 1811 in Manhattan. That grid had given rise to Central Park, a park with mostly artificial features within <b>the</b> <b>bounds</b> of the grid. However, in 1877, the city declined to act upon his plan.|$|E

Larger still is El Gordo, or officially ACT-CL J0102-4915, whose discovery was announced in 2012. Located around 7.2 billion light years away, it is composed of two subclusters in the process of colliding, resulting in the spewing out of hot gas, seen in X-rays and infrared images.|$|E
5|$|Newer {{styles of}} play have {{recently}} emerged, pushing <b>the</b> <b>bounds</b> {{of what the}} gandingan was traditionally used for. One type of play called kulndet requires players to perform highly dense, complicated rhythmic patterns upon the gandingan. This type of play unlike the olden (kamamatuan) style of gandingan playing requires assistants to hold the gongs to avoid long suspensions of sound. Because of the strenuous type of play, male musicians usually perform this style during contests held at weddings where players would demonstrate their virtuosity, considered a sign of masculinity, on the gandingan. During a gandingan contest, two expert gandingan players (pagagandings) would play a particular piece several times in rotation with each other. This type of play {{is said to have}} evolved from the spread of virtousic style on the agung.|$|E
5|$|On 24 July 1944, the {{battalion}} was gazetted as an Australian Imperial Force unit, {{meaning that it}} could be sent outside of <b>the</b> <b>bounds</b> imposed upon Militia units as set out in the Defence Act (1903). Shortly afterwards, they received orders that they would be withdrawn back to Australia in preparation for employment in combat elsewhere in the Pacific theatre. In early August 1944, Lieutenant Colonel Philip Parbury took over command of {{the battalion}}, relieving Major Bernard Callinan who had been acting in the role after Brock was taken ill and later died in December 1943. On 8 August the battalion embarked to return to Australia. Upon arrival, the men were given a brief period of leave before the battalion concentrated at Strathpine, Queensland, where they received reinforcements and undertook further training. They remained there for four months before departing for Bougainville on 6 December 1944, under the command of Lieutenant Colonel Joseph Kelly.|$|E

5|$|Roguelike games create random tile-based levels, monster encounters, and {{treasure}} through procedural generation on each new game. Preferably roguelikes {{adhering to the}} Berlin Interpretation use ASCII-based graphics. They may include pre-determined levels as well, such as a town level common to the Moria family where the player can buy and sell equipment. Generated layouts typically incorporate rooms connected by corridors, {{some of which may}} be preset to some degree (e.g., monster lairs or treasuries). Open areas or natural features, such as rivers, may occur, though these are considered against the Berlin Interpretation. While early roguelikes would have levels confined to <b>the</b> <b>bounds</b> of the terminal screen, other roguelikes enabled a much larger level size, only a portion shown to the player as they moved around it.|$|E
5|$|The 'Beating of the bounds' is {{an ancient}} annual custom first carried out in 1612, which revives the {{traditional}} checking of the sea boundaries awarded to Poole by the Cinque Port of Winchelsea in 1364. The Admiral of the Port of Poole (the mayor) and other dignitaries, {{and members of the}} public sail {{from the mouth of the}} River Frome to Old Harry Rocks to confirm the Mayor's authority over the water boundaries of the harbour and check for any encroachments. As there are no physical landmarks that can be beaten at sea, traditionally children from Poole were encouraged to remember <b>the</b> <b>bounds</b> of their town by taking part in the 'Pins and Points' ceremony involving the beating of a boy and pricking of a girl's hand with a needle. In modern times, the acts have been symbolically carried out.|$|E

Hurricane Juan caused considerable destruction to Nova Scotia, particularly Halifax, as a Category2 hurricane, the first hurricane of significant strength to hit the province since 1893. Additionally, Hurricanes Claudette and Erika struck Texas and Mexico, respectively, as minimal hurricanes.|$|E
