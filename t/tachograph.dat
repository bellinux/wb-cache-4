5|$|Evidence was {{presented}} by the prosecution to suggest that Morgan continued to use the vehicle while Figard's body lay in the cab, and that the lorry was parked outside his house over the Christmas period. Farrer said Morgan bought a spade, axe and hacksaw {{with the intention of}} dismembering the body, but changed his mind, instead making an overnight delivery run to dispose of it. After removing a fuse from his lorry's <b>tachograph</b> to conceal the journey, he drove to Worcestershire. Discrepancies were subsequently found in his travel records for 29 December 1995 because he forgot to replace the fuse following the trip. DNA tests on spots of blood found in the cab matched Figard, while a blood-soaked mattress was found in Morgan's garage. Several items belonging to Figard, including photographs and a toilet bag, were recovered from his house. Some of her clothing was found close to a warehouse he had visited the night the body was dumped. Morgan gave two bottles of Pascal Chretien that Figard had brought to England as Christmas presents to two garage attendants who worked at a Shell station opposite his house.|$|E
25|$|The <b>tachograph</b> was {{a device}} that {{monitors}} speed and driving and rest times. One {{of the way to}} record the information is the old method using a paper chart (analogue <b>tachograph).</b> The chart recorder is an electromechanical device that records an electrical or mechanical input trend onto a piece of paper (the chart). Chart recorders may record several inputs using different color pens and may record onto strip charts or circular charts. The <b>tachograph</b> is a device fitted to a vehicle that automatically records its speed and distance, together with the driver's activity selected from a choice of modes. The drive mode is activated automatically when the vehicle is in motion.|$|E
25|$|Provided {{that road}} safety is not jeopardised, and to enable a driver {{to reach a}} {{suitable}} stopping place, {{a departure from the}} EU rules may be permitted to the extent necessary {{to ensure the safety of}} persons, the vehicle or its load. Drivers must note all the reasons for doing so on the back of their <b>tachograph</b> record sheets (if using an analogue <b>tachograph)</b> or on a printout or temporary sheet (if using a digital <b>tachograph)</b> at the latest on reaching the suitable stopping place (see relevant sections covering manual entries). Repeated and regular occurrences, however, might indicate to enforcement officers that employers were not in fact scheduling work to enable compliance with the applicable rules.|$|E
50|$|Digital <b>tachographs</b> make {{tampering}} {{much more}} difficult by sending signals in an encrypted manner. EU regulation 1360/2002 makes digital <b>tachographs</b> mandatory for all vehicles described in the above section Regulations and manufactured after 1 August 2005. Digital <b>tachographs</b> have been required as of 1 May 2006 for all new vehicles for which EWG regulation VO(EWG)3820/85 applies, as {{was published in the}} official newsletter of the European Union L102 from 11 April 2006.|$|R
50|$|EEC {{regulation}} 3821/85 from 20 December 1985 made <b>tachographs</b> mandatory {{throughout the}} EEC as of 29 September 1986.(Regulation 1463/70 amended by regulation 2828/77 made <b>tachographs</b> mandatory by 1 July 1979, reference to these regulations {{can be found}} in regulation 3821/85).|$|R
50|$|Today {{operators}} see <b>tachographs</b> as levellers—devices {{which prevent}} unfair competition from companies who force their drivers to work excessive hours. Trade unions and drivers also now favour <b>tachographs</b> {{for this reason}} and records are often used in tribunals as proof when claiming for unpaid work.|$|R
25|$|The <b>Tachograph</b> is a {{recording}} device that combines {{the functions of}} a clock and a speedometer. A controller (device) is a device used to measure and regulate {{the speed of a}} machine, such as a motor (Greek: tele = far away (distant), tacho = speed, graphein = write). A <b>tachograph</b> is a card with a device fitted to a vehicle that automatically records its speed and distance, together with the driver's activity selected from a choice of modes.|$|E
25|$|In {{order to}} be allowed to drive professionally (against salary) a special skill {{certificate}} is needed. A special education is needed to get it, which covers things like the driving time rules, the <b>tachograph,</b> load securing, passenger safety (buses) etc. This education is around six weeks long.|$|E
25|$|Truck drivers {{also use}} {{flashing}} headlights to warn drivers in the oncoming lane(s) {{of a police}} patrol down the road. Though not official, two consecutive flashes indicate a police patrol, whereas a rapid series of flashing indicates DMV or other law-enforcement agency that only controls truck drivers. During the day time, the latter is sometimes accompanied by the signaling driver making a circle with both hands (as if holding a <b>tachograph</b> ring).|$|E

50|$|FInally, {{some of the}} {{advantages}} of <b>tachographs</b> apply primarily to drivers who can rely upon the support of a trade union. Any assistance that <b>tachographs</b> provide to a driver engaged in a dispute with an employer may not be as useful if the driver cannot settle the claim {{due to a lack of}} trade union support, or due to other non-technical obstacles.|$|R

50|$|When {{the use of}} <b>tachographs</b> {{was imposed}} by the European Union on its member states in the 1980s, governments and {{operating}} companies were opposed {{on the grounds that}} <b>tachographs</b> were expensive and unnecessary, and contributed nothing to road safety. Domestic hours regulations were replaced by European regulations which were complicated. Opponents claimed that it was doubtful whether strict enforcement of these regulations would reduce driver fatigue since they were not based on scientific evidence.|$|R

5000|$|A <b>tachograph</b> system {{comprises}} a {{sender unit}} mounted {{to the vehicle}} gearbox, the <b>tachograph</b> head and a recording medium. <b>Tachograph</b> heads are of either analogue or digital types. All relevant vehicles manufactured in the EU since 1 May 2006 must be fitted with digital <b>tachograph</b> heads. The recording medium for analogue heads are wax coated paper discs, and for digital heads there are two recording mediums: internal memory (which can be read out with one {{of a variety of}} download devices into a so-called [...]ddd file) and digital driver cards containing a microchip with flash memory. Digital driver cards store data in a format that can later also be read out as a [...]ddd file.

50|$|An {{approved}} <b>tachograph</b> is {{the required}} instrument {{by which the}} activity of drivers subject to the EU or AETR drivers’ hours rules, the vehicle’s speed and distance, and the time are recorded. There are two main types of <b>tachograph</b> - analogue and digital.|$|E

50|$|Apart from {{enforcing}} regulations, <b>tachographs</b> {{are often}} used in Germany to investigate and punish speeding.

Also, after an accident, the discs are often examined with a microscope to discover the events that took place at a collision site.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Tachographs</b> can be {{tampered}} with in various ways, such as slightly twisting the marker, blocking {{the path of}} the arm with a piece of rubber or foam, short-circuiting the unit for short periods, intentionally preventing the detection of gear movement with a magnet, or interrupting the (older analogue) <b>tachograph's</b> power supply with a blown fuse to stop operation completely thus recording no information whatsoever. There is also [...] "forgetting to insert" [...] the chart when beginning duty. Unauthorized changing of the discs (and then discarding one of the two, so that some activities are [...] "forgotten") is well known throughout Europe. [...] "Ghosting" [...] is another common trick when false driver information is entered onto a second chart to give the appearance that there is a second driver present in the cab for long distance runs that cannot be completed within a single driver's daily driving period.|$|R
