50|$|The Poona Dam is an earth-fill {{embankment}} dam with a <b>toe</b> <b>drain</b> with an un-gated spillway across {{a tributary of}} the South Maroochy River that is located in the South East region of Queensland, Australia. The main purpose of the dam is for storage of potable water for the Sunshine Coast region. The impounded reservoir is also called Poona Dam.|$|E
5000|$|... == Flood control == Flood {{control is}} {{the main purpose of}} the Yolo Bypass. When there is too much water flowing into the Sacramento River, it is {{released}} into the Yolo Bypass at the Fremont Weir. The levee at the weir is about 33.5 feet tall, nearly 12 feet shorter than that on either side. When the water reaches the 12 foot mark it starts to flow out into the Yolo Basin. As water recedes, the basin is drained through the <b>Toe</b> <b>Drain,</b> a riparian channel located {{on the east side of}} the bypass. The water will eventually drain out into the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta just above Rio Vista. The Yolo Bypass can hold approximately four times the flow of the Sacramento River. This flood management relieves pressure on the surrounding river levee systems and reduces the risk of urban flooding in nearby cities, such as Sacramento or Davis.|$|E

40|$|Many {{embankment}} dams on {{soil and}} fractured rock foundations have failed {{due to the}} formation of pipe-shaped discharge channels or conduits at or near the contact with the foundation material. Piping within a dam structure may be defined as soil or embankment particles eroding along unseen conduits or pipes through a dam or its foundation by seeping water. Teton Dam {{is a good example of}} an embankment failure caused by piping. Ochoco Dam represents a good example of a dam that had piping problems but those problems were identified and rectified before a disaster occurred. Agency Valley Dam has several characteristics that are favorable to piping. An evaluation of Agency Valley Dam is undertaken to determine the potential for piping. A field investigation using drill holes and test pits acquired samples that were analyzed based on filter criteria. Seepage analysis provided phreatic water surface data and gradients at contacts within the dam and its foundation. A review of construction documents led to information about the condition of the outlet works tunnel. Visual inspection of the dam and <b>toe</b> <b>drains</b> yielded an overall condition of the dam. Evaluation of Agency Valley Dam show that the dam is functioning properly and the potential for piping under current conditions is very low...|$|R
40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. Landfill covers are designed as impermeable caps on top of waste containment facilities {{after the completion of}} landfill operations. Geocomposite drain (GD) materials consist of a geonet or geospacer (as a drainage core) sandwiched between non-woven geotextiles that act as separators and filters. GD provides a drainage function as part of the cover system. The stability performance of landfill cover system is largely controlled by the interface shear strength mobilised between the elements of the cover. If a GD is used, the interface shear strength properties between the upper surface of the GD and the overlying soil may govern stability of the system. It is not uncommon for fine grained materials to be used as cover soils. In these cases, understanding soil softening issues at the soil interface with the non-woven geotextile is important. Such softening can be caused by capillary break behaviour and build-up of water pressures from the <b>toe</b> of the <b>drain</b> upwards into the cover soil. The interaction processes to allow water flow into a GD core through the soil-geotextile interface is very complex, and have been defined herein as Capillary Related Interface Breakthrough (CRIB). The infiltration test using small column on CRIB conditions for GD in contact with fine grained soils confirmed the development of capillary break at the interface. The effect of water build-up on the interface leads to soil softening in fine grained soils layer and reduce the interface shear strength hence potential instability of the system. Two series of fine grained soil/GD interface shear strength tests conducted to determine the interface shear strength behaviour for a range of soil water contents. The soil softening at the interface due to soaked behaviour show a reduction in interface shear strength and this aspect should be emphasized in design specifications and construction control. Comparison on the main behaviour using field measurements on the trial landfill cover at Bletchley were conducted to increase confidence in the understanding of the implications for design of cover systems...|$|R
40|$|A {{section of}} California 2 Ì† 7 s Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta levees was {{analyzed}} {{to develop a}} remedial design. The levee section that was evaluated was provided by Kleinfelder, along with the corresponding soils report. The soils report was utilized {{in order to create}} a general cross-section that was modeled using the GEO-Slope program. From the initial analysis of the levee section, three remedial designs were created. These designs include: a seepage berm, cutoff wall, and <b>toe</b> <b>drain.</b> The remedial designs were based off of the U. S. Army Corps of Engineers Design and Construction of Levees, prepared in April 2000, see Appendix A. It was determined that the seepage berm was the best choice for this particular levee section due to the cost and ease of construction and available space to install the berm. The cutoff wall was determined to be too expensive and difficult to construct due to the depth required to remediate the failure mode(s). If space is not available, a <b>toe</b> <b>drain</b> is recommended as the design solution...|$|E

In this study a centrifuge model that has been designed to investigate the impact of animal burrows on the performance of an existing earthen structure is described. The proposed methodology simulates animal burrows in an earthen structure by introducing cylindricalshaped openings inside a pre-designed model. A homogenous levee with 1 : 1 side slopes and a horizontal <b>toe</b> <b>drain</b> was chosen for this preliminary investigation. The steps taken to construct the model and the effect of the adopted burrow simulation technique on the model performance are discussed.

40|$|The {{objectives}} {{of this study}} were to estimate the influence of roots on the drainage facilities associated with the levees along the middle Rio Grande (MRG), and to suggest an appropriate drainage design. This study consists of three research elements: (1) GIS-based analysis in estimating root distribution along levees, (2) a bench-top experiment, and (3) evaluating a drainage designs using a numerical model. First, tree crown sizes were measured on GIS-based aerial photography to estimate root distributions. The results were compared with vegetation maps that were created based on field observations. The GIS-based measurements and field measurements showed similar values if the site was covered with a simple vegetation community. Simple canopy shapes improved the precision of the measurements. However, the GIS-based measurement was not accurate for a site with complex vegetation coverage. The bench-top experiment was conducted {{to evaluate the effectiveness of}} two types of geosynthetics as root barriers. A geotextile and a geocomposite were tested in v clear columns filled with soil and/or gravel to simulate six different drainage designs. Two New Mexican plants, Rio Grande cottonwood (Populus deltoides ssp. wislizeni) and coyote willow (Salix exigua), were selected, and planted in columns. The results showed roots of both species could penetrate through the geotextile and geocomposite. Also, root growth was not affected by the types of root barriers nor drainage material. For the last study element, HYDRUS- 2 D was applied to understand the soil water movement in the levee. The typical <b>toe</b> <b>drain</b> and the geocomposite edge drain were considered, and the models were run under the ambient condition (unsaturated) and the flood condition (saturated). As a result, the functions of both drainage designs were close to identical under the ambient condition since it did not result in drainage. In contrast, under the flood condition, the geocomposite edge drain could remove excess water more efficiently than the conventional <b>toe</b> <b>drain.</b> Civil EngineeringMastersUniversity of New Mexico.

40|$|A site {{inspection}} of an embankment on the West Coast Main Line (UK) revealed a general de-terioration of the embankment, significant {{movement of the}} trackside services and waterlogging and bulging along the embankment toe. The medium-height embankment, with side slopes at about 30 degrees to the hori-zontal, was constructed on natural sidelong ground and the site had been an area of previous instability (for-mer ash and slag tip). Site investigation, ground monitoring and analytical modelling indicated that the em-bankment was at limiting equilibrium and that recent progressive movement was occurring along a rotational slip surface located within the embankment core (ash and slag materials overlying reworked glacial till). The upgrade works comprised the installation of a row of stabilizing piles along the mid-height of the embank-ment side slope (facilitating Green Zone working); regrading to prevent shallower slips near the embankment crest and the installation of a <b>toe</b> <b>drain</b> that discharged to a nearby stream...|$|E
40|$|The {{design and}} {{assessment}} of the slope stability of small embankment dams is usually not carried out using slope stability calculations but rather by the comparison of proposed or existing dam slopes with those recommended by technical standards or guidelines. Practical experience shows {{that in many cases}} the slopes of small dams are steeper than those recommended. However, most of such steeper slopes at existing dams do not exhibit any visible signs of instability, defects or sliding. For the dam owner and also for dam stability engineers, the safety of the slope, expressed e. g. via a factor of safety, is crucial. The aim {{of this study is to}} evaluate the safety margin provided by recommended slopes. The factor of safety was evaluated for several dam shape and layout variants via the shear strength reduction method using PLAXIS software. The study covers various dam geometries, dam core and shoulder positions and parameter values of utilised soils. Three load cases were considered: one with a steady state seepage condition and two with different reservoir water level drawdown velocities â€“ standard and critical. As numerous older small dams lack a drainage system, variants with and without a <b>toe</b> <b>drain</b> were assessed.

40|$|AbstractThe earth-fill dam of Zhiguli Hydropower Plant {{is located}} between the {{building}} of the hydropower plant and the concrete spillway dam. To collect seepage water {{in the body of the}} earth-fill dam throughout its entire length, inside a stone <b>toe</b> <b>drain,</b> there is a gallery made of reinforced concrete. In order to estimate the technical state, signs of structural deformation, cracks, chips and corrosive wear, a survey of the reinforced concrete structures of the drainage gallery with discharge outlets in the earth-fill dam has been conducted, the main results of which are presented in this paper. As a result of this survey, the areas and the value of subsidence of the reinforced concrete structures of the drainage gallery have been identified. The slope of the drainage gallery and the amount of sediment in it has been defined. Besides, the area along the route of discharge outlets has been examined, and the state of the coastline has been evaluated.

Four baffle types (one horizontal ramp and three different vertical slot designs) set in two configurations were tested at three velocity regimes (velocity range around baffles, 0. 28 â€“ 2. 52 m/s). In general, faster velocities (0. 76 â€“ 1. 07 m/s) cued fish to swim upstream sooner (100 s). Among the baffle types, the percentage of successful passage was variable, and no statistically significant pattern was detected. The tail-beat frequency of fish significantly increased in the high-velocity (to 2. 52 m/s) regions of the flume adjacent to the energy-dissipating baffles, where sturgeon were able to pass by swimming in bursts, followed by a resting and recovery period in slower water.

40|$|The {{rehabilitation}} of small dams often requires the reduction or control of groundwater seepage through or under earthen dams. The slurry trench method {{is well known}} for creating impermeable groundwater barriers and has been used for decades to create economical and positive cutoff walls in the core or foundation soils beneath dams and dikes of many types and sizes. This paper examines three innovative modifications of the slurry trench method and their applications in the {{rehabilitation of}} three small dams. Case histories of each dam and slurry trench method are described. The slurry trench technique uses an engineered fluid for support of trench walls. Usually the fluid is bentonite slurry that coats the trench walls and permanently blocks the free flow of water. If, however, the fluid is degradable, a permeable backfill, such as sand or gravel can be backfilled in the trench to create a permeable zone such as a <b>toe</b> <b>drain</b> or chimney drain. This method is known as the bio-polymer trench drain method and has been used {{for more than a decade}} in the waste remediation industry to collect contaminated groundwater, and more recently in the rehabilitation of dams.

40|$|AbstractA {{series of}} dynamic {{centrifuge}} model tests {{was conducted in}} order to evaluate some factors affecting the seismic performance of hillside embankments consisting of sandy or silty soils and resting on stiff base slope. The effects of seepage water elevation in embankments, <b>toe</b> <b>drain,</b> embankment height, base slope inclination, soil compaction, and fill materials on the seismic behaviour of embankments were investigated. The test results showed that: (1) the seepage water {{was one of the}} most important factors for earthquake-induced embankment failure; (2) the seismic performance of both the smaller and higher embankments was remarkably improved by installing the toe drain; (3) larger base slope inclination produced larger earthquake-induced deformation of embankments; (4) well-compacted embankments were not vulnerable to earthquake-induced damage; and (5) the seismic performance of well-compacted embankments consisting of well-graded silty soils with large fines content was higher than that of poorly graded sands under otherwise the same condition. In some tests, as observed during past strong earthquakes, delayed flow failure occurred due possibly to the multiple effects of upward seepage associated with the redistribution of excess pore water pressures generated during main shaking, continued small vibration after main shaking, and driving static shear stresses caused by the embankment weight. A series of triaxial compression and cyclic triaxial liquefaction tests was also conducted to evaluate undrained behaviour of the fill materials. The correlation between the model and laboratory element test results was presented...|$|E
40|$|Despite {{widespread}} bench-terracing {{soil erosion}} remains {{a major problem}} in Java's uplands. To elucidate the causes for this lack of impact, runoff and erosion processes were studied at a variety of spatial scales within a volcanic catchment in West Java. Research indicated that soil loss occurs via rain splash and wash of rainfall-detached sediment by shallow overland flow from the terrace riser and bed, and via runoff entrainment of sediment deposited in the central terrace <b>toe</b> <b>drain.</b> The terrace erosion and sediment transport mode (TEST) was developed to physically describe these processes, as a function of vegetation and soil surface cover where appropriate, yet use as few parameters as possible. Runoff generation was described by the spatially variable infiltration model (SVIM) and a two parameter rainfall depth-intensity distribution was assumed to derive a simple analytical expression for storm runoff depth. In a similar manner expressions were derived for effective rainfall kinetic energy to predict rainfall-driven transport using a newly developed model, and for effective runoff rate to predict flow-driven transport using GUEST model theory. The model and its components were tested using measured runoff and soil loss from 31 sections of terrace beds or risers and from six terrace units during two seasons. The model generally performed satisfactorily and provides a useful new tool for assessing the impacts of soil conservation measures on bench terrace runoff and soil loss.

40|$|Earthen dams are {{constructed}} to store {{water for the}} purposes of human consumption, food production, electricity production, industrial use and flood protection. Failure of Earthen dams may be due to hydraulic failure, structural failure or seepage failure. Hydraulic failure may be due to overtopping, erosion of the upstream/downstream surface/toe and piping. Structural failures can occur in either the embankment or the appurtenances. Failure of a spillway, lake drain, or other appurtenance may lead to failure of the embankment. Cracking, settlement, and slides are the more common signs of structural failure of embankments. Seepage Failure occurs due to the uncontrolled seepage in both velocity and quantity. Water permeating slowly through the dam and progressively erode the soil in the embankment or the foundation toward the reservoir. Eventually with increased seepage flow rate the direct connection is made to the reservoir causing the piping. Piping may occur through the dam or the foundation causing dam failure. Seepage problems in large dams should be addressed in proper way on time to prevent before it becomes a massive disaster.
