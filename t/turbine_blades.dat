40|$|Abstract. <b>Turbine</b> <b>blade</b> {{is one of}} the {{critical}} parts of the aero engine and usually has complex structures. The main {{purpose of this paper is}} to present a virtual cutting based method for aero engine <b>turbine</b> <b>blade</b> reverse modeling from its cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) images. Based on the <b>turbine</b> <b>blade</b> CBCT images, an improved Marching Cube algorithm was used to construct a 3 D mesh model of the <b>turbine</b> <b>blade.</b> Then, cutting tools of parallel planes, concentric cylinders, concentric cones or revolved free form surfaces were used to cut the <b>turbine</b> <b>blade</b> mesh model to get the profile curves. After the profile curves were constructed by curve fitting and joining, the lofting geometric modeling technique was used to generate the <b>turbine</b> <b>blade</b> airfoil surface working in parallel flow, cylindrical flow, conical flow and revolved free form flow respectively. A set of computer simulating <b>turbine</b> <b>blade</b> CBCT images (512 × 512 × 512) was used to test the presented method and the testing results showed that the method was feasible and convenient...|$|R

5|$|The {{principal}} damage {{sustained by}} aircraft flying into a {{volcanic ash cloud}} is abrasion to forward-facing surfaces, such as the windshield and leading edges of the wings, and accumulation of ash into surface openings, including engines. Abrasion of windshields and landing lights will reduce visibility forcing pilots to rely on their instruments. However, some instruments may provide incorrect readings as sensors (e.g., pitot tubes) can become blocked with ash. Ingestion of ash into engines causes abrasion damage to compressor fan blades. The ash erodes sharp blades in the compressor, reducing its efficiency. The ash melts in the combustion chamber to form molten glass. The ash then solidifies on <b>turbine</b> <b>blades,</b> blocking air flow and causing the engine to stall.|$|E
5|$|The Victor B.1 was {{powered by}} an {{arrangement}} of four Armstrong Siddeley Sapphire turbojet engines. The engines were embedded in pairs into the aircraft's wing root; {{because of the high}} mounted position of the wing, the tail had to adopt a high mounting to maintain clearance of the jet turbulence, however the airbrakes were ideally situated {{to take advantage of this}} phenomenon. Difficulties were encountered with the Sapphires when stationed in tropical environments; several engines were destroyed by the <b>turbine</b> <b>blades</b> striking the outer engine casing. The Victor B.2 adopted the newer Rolls-Royce Conway turbofan; the Conway at one point held the distinction of being the most powerful non-afterburning engine outside of the Soviet Union, and were significantly more powerful than the preceding Sapphire engines employed upon on the B.1.|$|E
5|$|The cost {{has reduced}} as wind turbine {{technology}} has improved. There are now longer and lighter wind <b>turbine</b> <b>blades,</b> improvements in turbine performance and increased power generation efficiency. Also, wind project capital and maintenance costs {{have continued to}} decline. For example, the wind industry in the USA in early 2014 were able to produce more power at lower cost by using taller wind turbines with longer blades, capturing the faster winds at higher elevations. This has opened up new opportunities and in Indiana, Michigan, and Ohio, the price of power from wind turbines built 300feet to 400feet above the ground can now compete with conventional fossil fuels like coal. Prices have fallen to about 4 cents per kilowatt-hour in some cases and utilities have been {{increasing the amount of}} wind energy in their portfolio, saying it is their cheapest option.|$|E

5|$|Cobalt-based {{superalloys}} consume {{most of the}} produced cobalt. The {{temperature stability}} of these alloys makes them suitable for <b>turbine</b> <b>blades</b> for gas turbines and jet aircraft engines, though nickel-based single crystal alloys surpass them in performance. Cobalt-based alloys are also corrosion and wear-resistant, making them (along with titanium) useful in medical orthopedic implants that do not wear down over time. The development of wear-resistant cobalt alloys started {{in the first decade}} of the 20th century with the stellite alloys, containing chromium with varying quantities of tungsten and carbon. Alloys with chromium and tungsten carbides are very hard and wear resistant. Special cobalt-chromium-molybdenum alloys like Vitallium are used for prosthetic parts (hip and knee replacements). Cobalt alloys are also used for dental prosthetics as a useful substitute for nickel, which may be allergenic. Some high speed steels also contain cobalt for increased heat and wear-resistance. The special alloys of aluminium, nickel, cobalt and iron, known as Alnico, and of samarium and cobalt (samarium-cobalt magnet) are used in permanent magnets. It is also alloyed with 95% platinum for jewelry, yielding an alloy suitable for fine casting and is also slightly magnetic.|$|E

40|$|During the Space Shuttle Main Engines (SSM) HPFtP/AT {{development}} program, engine hot fire testing {{resulted in}} <b>turbine</b> <b>blade</b> fatigue cracks. The cracks were noted {{after only a}} few tests and a several hundred seconds versus the design goal of 60 tests and > 30, 000 seconds. Subsequent investigation attributed the distress to excessive steady and dynamic loads. To address these excessive <b>turbine</b> <b>blade</b> loads, Pratt & Whitney Liquid Space Propulsion engineers designed and developed retrofitable <b>turbine</b> <b>blade</b> to blade platform featherseal dampers. Since incorporation of these dampers, along with other <b>turbine</b> <b>blade</b> system improvements, there has been no observed SSME HPFTP/AT <b>turbine</b> <b>blade</b> fatigue cracking. The high time HPFTP/AT blade now has accumulated 32 starts and 19, 200 seconds hot fire test time. Figure # 1 illustrates the HPFTP/AT <b>turbine</b> <b>blade</b> platform featherseal dampers. The approached selected was to improve the <b>turbine</b> <b>blade</b> structural capability while simultaneously reducing loads. To achieve this goal, the featherseal dampers were designed to seal the blade to blade platform gap and damp the dynamic motions. Sealing improves the steady stress margins by increasing turbine efficiency and improving <b>turbine</b> <b>blade</b> attachment thermal conditioning. Load reduction was achieved through damping. Thin Haynes 188 sheet metal was selected based on its material properties (hydrogen resistance, elongation, tensile strengths, etc.). The 36, 000 rpm wheel speed of the rotor result in a normal load of 120 #/blade. The featherseals then act as micro-slip dampers during actual SSME operation. After initial design and analysis (prior to full engine testing), the featherseal dampers were tested in P&W's spin rig facility in West Palm Beach, Florida. Both dynamic strain gages and <b>turbine</b> <b>blade</b> tip displacement measurements were utilized to quantify the featherseal damper effectiveness. Full speed (36, 000 rpm), room temperature rig testing verified the elimination of fundamental mode (i. e, modes 1 & 2) resonant response. The reduction in <b>turbine</b> <b>blade</b> dynamic response is shown for a typical <b>turbine</b> <b>blade.</b> This paper discusses the design and verification of these dampers. The numerous benefits associated with this design concept warrants consideration in existing and future turbomachinery applications...|$|R

Therefore, the profile measurement of <b>turbine</b> <b>blade</b> is an essential issue in the blade machining processing, however, it is difficult and particular to establish the profile measurement of <b>turbine</b> <b>blade</b> because of its complicated shapes and space angles of the blades, and the specific stringent environmental requirements need a more appropriate measurement method to the <b>Turbine</b> <b>Blade</b> profile measurement.
