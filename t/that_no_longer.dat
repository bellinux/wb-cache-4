5|$|In the {{beginning}} of the twentieth century the fraternity system continued to expand at such a rapid pace that university newspapers questioned if the increase in the number of fraternities would ever end. Many fraternity chapters were founded during this time <b>that</b> <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> exist at the university, such Alpha Chi Rho, Theta Nu Epsilon, and Delta Chi. Other chapters that are still active were founded at this time as well, such as Theta Chi and Phi Sigma Kappa.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 1960s, Lichtenstein {{reproduced}} masterpieces by Cézanne, Mondrian and Picasso before embarking on the Brushstroke series in 1965. The Brushstrokes were contemporaneous with abstract painting <b>that</b> <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> emphasized the gestural aspect, with non-demonstrative modes carrying the day. Lichtenstein was identified with some such modes by critics {{and found himself}} linked to both Frank Stella and Kenneth Noland. Brushstrokes was the first element of the Brushstrokes series.|$|E

Although the precise {{environmental}} background of the Lagoa Santa fossil assemblage remains unclear, they may have been deposited in a period of climatic cooling that led to higher local diversity.|$|E
5|$|There {{have been}} at least thirty-two {{counties}} established by Texas law <b>that</b> <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> exist.

5|$|Again about 1505 the {{rebuilding}} {{of the church of}} San Pietro in Oliveto began, a commission probably won by Sanmicheli. Note that the reliefs are the only figurative works there, in addition to the fine carvings on pilasters and frames of the chapels, a specialism of the Sanmicheli <b>that</b> <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> met contemporary tastes. The ultimate answer from Gasparo not long in coming: with the ark of Sant'Apollonio of 1508, he established once and for all his artistic superiority, which was by then certainly much more preferred by the Brescian clientele.|$|E

5|$|John of Tours or John de Villula (died1122) was {{a medieval}} Bishop of Wells in England who moved the diocese seat to Bath. He {{was a native}} of Tours and was King William I of England's doctor before {{becoming}} a bishop. After his consecration as bishop, he was either given or purchased Bath Abbey, a rich monastery, and then moved the headquarters of the diocese from Wells, to the abbey. He rebuilt the church at Bath, building a large cathedral <b>that</b> <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> survives. He gave a large library to his cathedral and received the right to hold a fair in Bath. Not noted for his scholarship, he died suddenly in 1122.|$|E
5|$|On February 13, it was {{announced}} that the Amaury Sport Organisation would not invite Astana to any of their races that season, which included the Tour de France, Paris–Nice, and numerous one-day races. The decision was made because of the doping perpetrated by Astana in its previous seasons; chief among these scandals was the blood doping perpetrated by Alexander Vinokourov in the 2007 Tour de France. The team reacted with surprise and disappointment, particularly since the ban seemed to punish a team <b>that</b> <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> existed, and as a result Contador {{would not be able to}} defend his Tour de France championship.|$|E
5|$|The Lapidary is {{an open-air}} museum of {{primarily}} stone artworks, both originals and copies, which formerly decorated buildings <b>that</b> <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> exist. Some are {{set into the}} walls around a 1969 terrace, while others are freestanding at various locations in the park. For example, in {{the walls of the}} terrace there are fragments of five carved heads from the keystones over windows, supposed to be from the Old City Hall of Berlin in Spandauer Straße and attributed to Georg Gottfried Weiyhenmeyer; two allegorical reliefs; 17th- and 18th-century building signs; a late Gothic vault keystone; and a 16th-century sandstone relief from the Stadtschloß.|$|E

5|$|The {{introduction}} of the TRIM command resolves this problem for operating systems that support it like Windows 7, Mac OS (latest releases of Snow Leopard, Lion, and Mountain Lion, patched in some cases), FreeBSD since version 8.1, and Linux since version 2.6.33 of the Linux kernel mainline. When a file is permanently deleted or the drive is formatted, the OS sends the TRIM command along with the LBAs <b>that</b> <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> contain valid data. This informs the SSD that the LBAs in use can be erased and reused. This reduces the LBAs needing to be moved during garbage collection. The result is the SSD will have more free space enabling lower write amplification and higher performance.|$|E
5|$|Lefebvre was {{increasingly}} criticized by influential {{members of his}} large religious congregation who considered him to be out-of-step with modern Church leaders and the demand of the bishops' conferences, particularly in France, for modernization and reforms. An Extraordinary General Chapter of the Holy Ghost Fathers was convened in Rome in September 1968 to debate {{the direction of the}} congregation after the changes of the Second Vatican Council. The first action of the chapter was to name several moderators to lead the chapter's sessions instead of Lefebvre. Lefebvre then handed in his resignation as Superior General to Pope Paul VI. He would later say that it had become impossible for him to remain superior of an institute <b>that</b> <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> wanted or listened to him.|$|E
5|$|On 2 January an {{emergency}} meeting {{was held at}} the Independence Palace in Saigon between President Thiệu, the Joint General Staff, and General Dong. At the meeting, Dong presented a plan for the relief of Phước Long that would have utilized either an infantry division or the Airborne Division. The plan was turned down for three reasons: first, there were simply no reserve forces of sufficient size available anywhere in the country for the task; second, with all overland routes in enemy hands, all movements and logistics would have to depend entirely on airlift, a capability <b>that</b> <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> existed; and third, despite advantageous defensive positions, the forces at Phước Long could not hold off two communist divisions long enough for any relief effort to succeed. The decision was then reached. Phước Long City and province would be surrendered to North Vietnamese forces as a matter of expediency, since it was considered to be strategically less important than Tây Ninh, Pleiku, or Huế – economically, politically, and demographically.|$|E

5|$|One of Berhtwald's letters {{has been}} preserved, sent to Forthhere, Bishop of Sherborne, and asking Forthhere to intercede with Beorwold, the Abbot of Glastonbury, to ransom a slave. Another letter, this one {{addressed}} to Berhtwald, from Waldhere, Bishop of London, also survives. The main {{interest in the}} second letter {{is that it is}} the oldest surviving letter close surviving in Western Europe. This second letter also relates that Waldhere and Berhtwald had attended a synod which can be dated to sometime between 703 and 705, where the kingdom of Wessex was threatened with excommunication. A charter witnessed by Berhtwald which mentions a supposed 706 council, numbered 54 by Sawyer, is now known to be a fake, although the witness list may be based on a legitimate 8th century charter <b>that</b> <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> survives. Likewise, a charter with Berhtwald as a witness and relating to the 716 Council of Clofesho is also known to be a 9th-century forgery, although again it may have been based on actual documents from the council.|$|E
5|$|Residual lead in soil {{contributes}} to lead exposure in urban areas. It has been {{thought that the}} more polluted an area is with various contaminants, {{the more likely it}} is to contain lead. However, this is not always the case, as there are several other reasons for lead contamination in soil. Lead content in soil may be caused by broken-down lead paint, residues from lead-containing gasoline, used engine oil, or pesticides used in the past, contaminated landfills, or from nearby industries such as foundries or smelters. Although leaded soil is less of a problem in countries <b>that</b> <b>no</b> <b>longer</b> have leaded gasoline, it remains prevalent, raising concerns about the safety of urban agriculture; eating food grown in contaminated soil can present a lead hazard.|$|E
