40|$|Abstract—This paper {{proposes a}} control method {{to absorb the}} landing force or the ground {{reaction}} force for a stable dynamic walking of a humanoid robot. Humanoid robot may become unstable during walking due to the impulsive contact force of the sudden landing of its foot. Therefore, a control method to decrease the landing force is required. In this paper, time-domain passivity control approach is applied for this purpose. Ground and {{the foot of the}} robot are modeled as two one-port network systems that are connected, and exchange energy with each other. The time-domain passivity controller with admittance causality is implemented, which has the landing force as input and foot’s position <b>to</b> <b>trim</b> <b>off</b> the force as output. The proposed landing force controller can enhance the stability of the walking robot from simple computation. The small-sized humanoid robot, HanSaRam-VII that has 27 DOFs, is developed to verify the proposed scheme through dynamic walking experiments.

40|$|This paper briefs on an {{overview}} of recent progress and development in humanoid robot, HanSaRam se-ries. HanSaRam (HSR) is a humanoid robot under-going continual design and development in the Robot Intelligence Technology (RIT) Laboratory at KAIST since 2000. Currently HSR-VI, the latest version de-veloped in 2004, is under experiment for on-line walk-ing. In this paper, a method to reduce the landing impact/contact force is proposed for a stable dynamic walking. Humanoid robot might become unstable dur-ing the walking due to the impulsive contact force from the sudden landing of its foot. Therefore a new con-trol method to decrease the landing impact force has been required. In this paper, {{the ground and the}} foot of the robot are modeled as two one-port network sys-tems which are connected and exchange energy with each other. In addition, the time domain passivity controller, which has the landing impact force as in-put and foot’s position <b>to</b> <b>trim</b> <b>off</b> the force as out-put, is implemented.

40|$|Abstract — In this paper, {{a method}} to reduce the landing impact force is {{proposed}} for a stable dynamic walking of a humanoid robot. To measure the meaningful landing impact force, a novel foot mechanism, which uses FSRs (Force Sensing Resistors), is introduced as well. Humanoid robot might become unstable during the walking due to the impulsive contact force from the sudden landing of its foot. Therefore a new control method to decrease the landing impact force has been required. In this paper, time domain passivity control approach is applied for this purpose. Ground and {{the foot of the}} robot are modeled as two one-port network systems which are connected and exchanging energy each other. And, the time domain passivity controller which has the landing impact force as input and foot’s position <b>to</b> <b>trim</b> <b>off</b> the force as output, is implemented.

40|$|Abstract—Next-generation {{sequencing}} (NGS) {{data are}} {{a rapidly growing}} example of big data {{and a source of}} new knowl-edge in science. However, sequencing errors remain unavoidable and reduce the quality of NGS data. Error correction, therefore, is a critical step in the successful utilization of NGS data, including de novo genome assembly and DNA resequencing. Since NGS throughput doubles approximately every five months and the length of NGS records (i. e., reads) is increasing, improvements in efficiency and effectiveness of computational strategies are needed. In this study, we aim to improve the performance of CloudRS, an open-source MapReduce application designed to correct sequencing errors in NGS data. We introduce the read-message (RM) diagram to represent the set of messages, i. e., the key-value pairs generated on each read. We also present the Gradient-number Votes (GNV) scheme in order <b>to</b> <b>trim</b> <b>off</b> portions of the RM diagram, thereby reducing the total size of messages associated with each read. Experimental results show that the GNV scheme successfully reduce execution time and improve the quality of the de novo genome assembly.

By 16 January, officials warned that further rains from the storm could renew floods to regions still recovering from destructive ones earlier in the month.

On 18 January, the 1,000 relief workers brought into the region after the floods were placed on standby to protect their well-being as the storm moved through. After Katrina stalled and turned away from Queensland on 19 January, the cyclone watch area was revised to encompass areas between Cardwell and Mackay. A strong wind warning was also put in effect from Cairns to Bowen. The following day, these advisories were discontinued as the storm no longer posed a threat to land.|$|R
40|$|This article {{discusses}} {{the application of}} laser to trim the outer surface from tree-ring increment cores in preparation for dendrochemistry of certain metals. A source of contamination specific to dendrochemistry of metals is metal constituents, such as iron, tungsten, chromium, nickel, and cobalt, coming off tools used to collect and process cores and adhering to the sample surface. One method to eliminate this contamination is <b>to</b> <b>trim</b> <b>off</b> the outer surface of cores using laser. To test this application of laser, three tree-ring increment cores were collected from each of three trees. For each tree, one core was trimmed using a CO 2 laser, one core was trimmed using a stainless steel razor blade, and one core was left untrimmed. The resultant cores were measured for metals using acid dissolution inductively coupled plasma mass spectroscopy. Trimmed cores had on average one-third the content of iron, tungsten, and chromium than that of untrimmed cores. Laser-trimmed cores had less of these metals than razor-trimmed cores. Razor-trimmed cores also had measurable nickel, but laser-trimmed cores had no nickel. Laser trimming is an ideal solution to potential contamination of cores with metals from increment borers without imparting other contamination from tools such as razor blades...|$|E
40|$|A plough is {{typically}} used by fine binders to trim a textblock to produce smooth, even edges. A book {{is placed in}} the press of the plough and a blade is drawn perpendicular to the book {{along the length of the}} textblock, slicing through it a few sheets at a time. For conservation purposes, a plough (or guillotine) is used <b>to</b> <b>trim</b> <b>off</b> the damaged spine of adhesive-bound books in preparation for rebinding using the double fan adhesive method (DFA). The DFA method deposits tiny amounts of glue on either side of individual pages, essentially tipping them to each other, therefore a smoothly trimmed spine edge is crucial for this binding’s success and mechanical stability. A DFA bound book has a very strong and flexible textblock that will remain more resilient than commercial adhesive bindings which are prone to failing, especially under heavy use. Hybrid or general collections labs that rebind large quantities of books using the DFA method will typically invest in a guillotine or plough which can cost hundreds or thousands of dollars. Working in a primarily special collections lab, the only opportunity I have to perform this type of rebinding is when one of our reference books becomes damaged and/or the original binding has failed. Therefore, I could not justify spending hundreds of dollars for a piece of equipment that may be used only a few times per year, regardless of how handy it would be. There are many book binders and book artists that have created their own makeshift ploughs using various materials and equipment combined with specialized blades, some of which may be purchased (see References below) ...|$|E
40|$|In {{the current}} {{economic}} climate the circumstances and the environment for companies constantly change and organizations which in the future want to be competitive have to adapt to these new conditions and market requirement else {{they are forced to}} be out of business. Seeing the rapid change in telecom sector with flat sales in many countries during 2008, 2009 and 2010 Ericsson decided to do a major re organization in 2010. Ericsson management set out to restructure the company <b>to</b> <b>trim</b> <b>off</b> fat and to help the company function as a leaner and more productive entity by assigning transformational leaders that can help company cope with the changing market conditions with focus on business performance, growth, new market segments and getting more close to customer. As a result of that change Ericsson Saudi Arabia that was known as Market Unit Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (MU KSA) part of 23 Market Units across the globe transformed to Customer Unit Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (CU KSA) part of Region Middle East (RMEA) with new Head and management team. By 2009 - 2010 Ericsson CU KSA was facing issues like flat sales, operators were cautious to spend more money since revenues were declining, emergence of Chinese players in the marker resulted in dramatic culture shift in industry where business models and ways of working changed and Ericsson in Saudi Arabia was having direct impact on revenue and market share. During 2008, 2009 and 2010 Ericsson in Saudi Arabia lost local market share from 60 % to 50 % and a complete overhaul was inevitable. One of the primary objectives of this study will be to determine the relationship of transformational leadership to organizational performance by analyzing data collected from Ericsson Saudi Arabia. It will be analyzed if new management in Ericsson Saudi Arabia has the capabilities of transformational leadership. Later I’ll try to establish correlation of transformational leadership towards strategic management, Organizational culture and Employee Motivation & Commitment {{to see if there is}} any significant impact of these that will help overcome existing market challenges explore new opportunities and redefine strategies while resulting in positive business growth and performance. For the purpose of research a study a mix of qualitative and quantitative approach was chosen. Questionnaire surveys were used as part of quantitative research. Interview surveys together with Sales reports and balanced score cards were used as part of qualitative research. A total of 48 questionnaire surveys along with 8 interviews form different members of management in CU KSA were conducted. Data analysis tool function in Excel was used to figure out mean, median and standard deviation for Transformational leadership attributes. Data analysis tool was also used to calculate correlation coefficient factor between transformational leadership with strategic management, organizational culture and business performance. It was discovered after analysis conducted using interview and survey results that Ericsson CU KSA Head and Management fulfill the criterion of transformational leadership having strong presence of transformational leadership attributes namely vision, Inspirational, role model, support for personal growth, trust and consideration for followers needs. It was also discovered that transformational leadership has a strong correlation towards strategic management, organizational culture, employee Motivation and business performance. Data collected from Interviews, Sales reports and Balanced Score Card supported the data analysis of questionnaire. This means that if companies want to experience growth in their business especially in these days of tough competition, there should be focus on making sure the leadership is transformational with strong emphasis on process of Strategic Management, fostering organization culture and boosting employee motivation & commitment that will lead towards positive Business Performance...|$|E

5000|$|Some hurdles {{facing the}} {{widespread}} adoption of recycled timber: sometimes {{the ends of}} wall studs need <b>to</b> be <b>trimmed</b> <b>off</b> <b>to</b> stop decay and cracking, thus resulting in a shorter piece of wood; this trimming may result in pieces of wood that do not meet building codes. Though the price may be less than for new wood, the process of selecting usable pieces of salvaged wood, pulling out nails, and refinishing for a new use can be laborious and time-consuming. Demolition must happen {{in such a way}} as to preserve as much of the timber as possible in a building, which means more time spent dismantling a building rather than just tearing it down quickly. The trade in recycled timber is not well-established everywhere, so a reliable supply of usable wood may be hard to come by for builders. There may be a stigma associated with using [...] "used" [...] or [...] "cheap" [...] wood that is perceived to be of not as high quality as [...] "new" [...] wood. Not all pieces of wood in a dismantled building will fit in a new building, and it may be cheaper and easier, from a design and labor perspective, to simply get new wood (ex: wood from a 6-foot (1.8 m) deck being used in a 7-foot (2.1 m) deck). Of course, none of these issues are insurmountable, and they are issues of convenience and logistics rather than structural integrity, but many builders find it easier and less time-consuming to simply get new wood in standard uniform sizes.|$|R
