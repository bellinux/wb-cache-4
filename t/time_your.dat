5|$|Adomnán in his Life of Saint Columba {{offers a}} longer account, which Abbot Ségéne {{had heard from}} Oswald himself. Oswald, he says, {{had a vision of}} Columba the night before the battle, in which he was toldBe strong and act manfully. Behold, I will be with thee. This coming night go out from your camp into battle, for the Lord has granted me that at this <b>time</b> <b>your</b> foes shall be put to flight and Cadwallon your enemy shall be {{delivered}} into your hands and you shall return victorious after battle and reign happily. Oswald described his vision to his council and all agreed that they would be baptised and accept Christianity after the battle. In the battle that followed, the British were routed despite their superior numbers; Cadwallon himself was killed.|$|E

"When I sent a ship to the Southern Barbarian {{countries}} {{several years}} ago, upon {{the advice of}} Mukai Shōgen, I also dispatched the Southern Barbarian named Sotelo, who had resided for several years in Edo.

[...] (18 October 1620, quoted in Gonoi, p.234).|$|E
500|$|The {{majority}} of the album consists of vintage funk, soul, and jazz samples. Commenting on the album and its use of samples, Pitchfork s Jeff Weiss claims that both Nas and his producers found inspiration for the album's production through the music of their childhood: [...] "The loops rummage through their parent's collection: Donald Byrd, Joe Chambers, Ahmad Jamal, Parliament, Michael Jackson. Nas invites his rolling stone father, Olu Dara to blow the trumpet coda on [...] "Life's a Bitch". Jazz rap fusion had been done well prior, but rarely with such subtlety. Nas didn't {{need to make the}} connection explicit—he allowed you to understand what jazz was like the first <b>time</b> <b>your</b> parents and grandparents heard it." [...] Similarly, journalist Ben Yew comments on the album's nostalgic sounds, [...] "The production, accentuated by infectious organ loop, vocal sample, and synthesizer-like pads in the background, places your mind in a cheerful, reminiscent, mood." ...|$|E

500|$|Travel America stated: [...] "To {{linger in}} the sumptuous salons of the Waldorf-Astoria is to step back in <b>time.</b> <b>Your</b> trip down memory lane is a {{flashback}} to the glamor days of the 1930s, when this Art Deco masterpiece was the tallest hotel {{in the world and}} the epicenter of elite society. A legendary limestone landmark occupying a whole block of prime real estate in midtown Manhattan, it's still a prestigious address that embodies luxury and power in the richest city on earth." [...] The hotel was designed by architects Schultze and Weaver and constructed at 301 Park Avenue, just north of Grand Central Terminal. That area was developed by building atop the existing railroad tracks leading to the station, with buildings like the Waldorf Astoria utilizing [...] "air rights" [...] to the space above the tracks. The new building opened on October 1, 1931. The 47-story [...] hotel was the tallest and largest hotel in the world, and remained so for a number of years.|$|E
500|$|Chris True, {{also from}} AllMusic, {{selected}} the song as a standout track on her Greatest Hits 87-97 album. Jason Lipshutz from Billboard listed [...] "Breathe" [...] at four on their [...] "Kylie Minogue Primer: The Top 10 Past Hits You Need to Know" [...] stating [...] "'Breathe’ {{is the obvious}} stand out, sounding almost like a Nine Inch Nails throwaway in its opening seconds and morphing into a silky, sexy defence of Minogue's experimental side." [...] Louis Virtel from The Backlot listed [...] "Breathe" [...] at number14 on their [...] "Kylie Minogue’s 50 Best Songs, in Honor of Her Birthday" [...] and said [...] "'Breathe' would be a meditative masterpiece if it weren't so confrontational, deadpan, and sexually domineering. Impossible Princess unassuming heart stopper trips into unexpected carnality in its choruses, assuring you 'It won’t be long now' {{as you try to}} <b>time</b> <b>your</b> hyperventilation." [...] According to Tom Parker, who provided the special edition album notes for Impossible Princess, [...] " [...] is a seductive electronic groove, with a hypnotic subtlety and timelessness befitting the theme inward contemplating and resolve." [...] Larry Flick from Billboard said that [...] "Breathe" [...] is a [...] "user-friendly jam" [...] which is [...] "largely due to its big-beat electronic groove and ear-tickling pop chorus." ...|$|E

2500|$|After having reluctantly {{given up}} the chase, the Essex and the St Louis {{returned}} to Cairo to replenish and begin ammunition runs, and were relieved by two other vessels which took up guarding Fort Holt. In the days following, Porter used a buoy to float towards the Confederate positions a challenge: [...] "Hollins: Why don't you accursed, cowardly rebels bring out your gunboats and fight us. Porter." [...] Confederate Captain Miller sent his reply in the same medium: [...] "Sir: The ironclad steamer Grampus will meet the Essex at any point and <b>time</b> <b>your</b> Honor may appoint and show you that the power is in our hands. An early reply will be agreeable." [...] The ships would meet in the coming weeks, however the Confederate vessels proved speedier than the Union ironclads. Porter's later account of the engagement was syndicated in the New York Times, where it was well received for their [...] "lucid and graphic manner".|$|E
2500|$|Sheppard {{was willing}} to take a sabbatical from his church mission in the East End in order to tour Australia in 1962-63. His many friends at Lord's wanted him to captain the Fourth and Fifth Tests against Pakistan in 1962, but Sheppard had not played serious cricket for years. He made 112 for the Gentlemen and was chosen for the tour, but Ted Dexter was {{confirmed}} as captain {{for the remainder of the}} home series and the forthcoming tour of Australia. Sheppard agreed to tour and [...] "the presence in the pulpit of David Sheppard...filled the Anglican cathedral of every state capital from Perth to Brisbane" [...] Sheppard made 0 and 113 in the victorious Second Test at Melbourne, but dropped two catches and was dropped himself when he was on a pair in the second innings. He ran out his captain Ted Dexter, took a risky single for the winning run and was run out by Bill Lawry so that Ken Barrington had to come out to see Colin Cowdrey make the winning single. Although he held some good catches on the tour [...] "the ones I dropped were at such vital moments", Richie Benaud and Bill Lawry in the Second Test and Neil Harvey in the Fourth Test off Trueman, who told him [...] "The only <b>time</b> <b>your</b> hands are together are on Sunday". This is a story that increased with the telling, another version being [...] "Pretend it's Sunday Reverend, and keep your hands together", or that it was Sheppard who said [...] "Sorry Fred, I should have kept my hands together". One couple in Australia asked Mrs Sheppard if the Reverend could christen their baby, but she advised them not to as he was bound to drop it.|$|E
