5|$|One of Chamberlin's {{challenges}} {{was working}} with the Australians. Their decentralized mode of planning was entirely different from the <b>top-down</b> <b>approach</b> used by GHQ, and Chamberlin found this a source of frustration, as {{it was difficult to}} extract information from them. Nonetheless, he established a good working relationship with the Australian Deputy Chief of the General Staff, Lieutenant General Frank Berryman.|$|E
5|$|The Soviets and an American {{group of}} architects each devised {{separate}} outlines for rebuilding {{the town of}} Spitak. Following an invitation by the Soviets for a critique of their plan, the American's proposal was ultimately accepted as the way forward. The new plan would deviate from Soviet styles that {{were found to be}} rigid and outdated, and would mirror characteristics of the local culture. For many years following World War II the Soviets practiced a methodical <b>top-down</b> <b>approach</b> to urban planning and building, constructing a large number of uniformly built row style apartment units, and the Soviets plan for rebuilding Spitak did not diverge from that approach. The Soviet's grid plan road scheme was found to {{not take into account the}} hillside at the new city's location, and the American's plan included finer details of how commercial centers and government facilities were grouped together in an open and communal style.|$|E

In general, the mechanical-physical <b>top-down</b> <b>approaches</b> {{can be distinguished}} from chemical-physical bottom-up <b>approaches.</b> In <b>top-down</b> <b>approaches,</b> ENM are made from larger materials through milling; in bottom-up approaches, ENM are synthesized from atoms, ions, or molecules in a chemical reaction. Milling operations are used for metallic or ceramic ENM with a relatively wide particle size distribution. Chemical-physical approaches have the advantage that the form {{and size of the}} particles can be better controlled. Possible reactions are precipitation and flame-, plasma-, or gas-phase synthesis.|$|R

25|$|In the {{bottom-up}} approach, we {{calculate the}} smaller values of fib first, then build larger values from them. This method also uses O(n) time since {{it contains a}} loop that repeats n − 1 times, but it only takes constant (O(1)) space, {{in contrast to the}} <b>top-down</b> <b>approach</b> which requires O(n) space to store the map.|$|E

In this <b>top-down</b> <b>approach,</b> the government influences the acquisition of languages and their respective functions within the speech community through the education system. Language planning aims to facilitate effective communication within the speech community, which {{can result in a}} language shift or language assimilation. The goals of language planning are very much dependent on the political and social forces present in Singapore during two distinct periods: Colonisation by the British and the Post-Independence period after 1965.|$|E

50|$|<b>Top-down</b> <b>approaches</b> {{emphasize}} {{planning and}} a complete understanding of the system. It is inherent that no coding can begin until a sufficient level of detail has been reached {{in the design of}} at least some part of the system. <b>Top-down</b> <b>approaches</b> are implemented by attaching the stubs in place of the module. This, however, delays testing of the ultimate functional units of a system until significant design is complete. Bottom-up emphasizes coding and early testing, which can begin as soon as the first module has been specified. This approach, however, runs the risk that modules may be coded without having a clear idea of how they link {{to other parts of the}} system, and that such linking may not be as easy as first thought. Re-usability of code is one of the main benefits of the bottom-up approach.|$|R
25|$|The <b>top-down</b> <b>approach</b> anticipates nanodevices {{that must}} be built piece by piece in stages, much as {{manufactured}} items are made. Scanning probe microscopy is an important technique both for characterization and synthesis of nanomaterials. Atomic force microscopes and scanning tunneling microscopes {{can be used to}} look at surfaces and to move atoms around. By designing different tips for these microscopes, they can be used for carving out structures on surfaces and to help guide self-assembling structures. By using, for example, feature-oriented scanning approach, atoms or molecules can be moved around on a surface with scanning probe microscopy techniques. At present, it is expensive and time-consuming for mass production but very suitable for laboratory experimentation.|$|E

25|$|American {{efforts to}} promote {{democracy}} {{in the region are}} generally characterized by top-down and bottom-up democratization strategies, which can be pursued simultaneously. The former <b>top-down</b> <b>approach</b> involves putting rhetorical and diplomatic pressure on regimes to reform and can {{go so far as to}} involve direct American military engagement installing democratic government (as is the case in Iraq following the 2003 invasion). The U.S. government generally pursues the latter bottom-up approach by funding international organizations that help strengthen the bases for gradual democratic transition (the rule of law, accountable government institutions and expanded political competition) in the MENA region by offering technical assistance and training to political parties and electoral management bodies, engaging with civil society, producing assessments and polls, and promoting female political participation. Some have criticized American democracy promotion in MENA for ineffectiveness, a lack of consistency, taking a one-size-fits-all approach and using democracy to justify military intervention abroad. Moreover, It's said that US democracy promotion had been accompanied by heavy costs for US and considerable damage to the target countries.|$|E

40|$|Ferroelectric {{materials}} are of {{growing interest in}} international research and development. Special attention is drawn to the integration of ferroelectric materials in non-volatile random access memory cells (FeRAMs). For future high-density FeRAMs, the scaling {{of the size of}} ferroelectric structures needs to be understood in order to elucidate possible limitations to memory densities. Various experimental studies were carried out in order to investigate scaling effects of ferroelectric nanograins on Si-wafers [1 - 4]. A major drawback of <b>top-down</b> <b>approaches</b> is the difficulty to achieve ferroelectric structures with lateral dimensions well below 50 nm. In addition, erosive <b>top-down</b> <b>approaches</b> [1, 3] inevitably induce damage to the fabricated capacitors as ferroelectricity is a nature of the crystal lattice. Hence, it becomes hard to distinguish between real intrinsic ferroelectric properties and the impact of production steps. To overcome these drawbacks, we present a straightforward “bottom-up ” method, using artificial TiO 2 dot templates on commonly used Si/SiO 2 /TiO 2 /Pt(111) substrates to promote nucleation and grain growth of PbTiO 3 (PT) crystallites prepared by a chemical solution deposition (CSD) technique [5]...|$|R

Moreover, projects often even miss out on their actual purpose. A group of researchers associated with the Australian National University, call for the foundation of so-called [...] "National Implementing Entities" [...] (NIE) in each country, that would become responsible for [...] "the implementation of sub-national projects".

2500|$|Deng's first reforms {{began in}} agriculture, a sector long {{neglected}} by the Communist Party. By the late 1970s, food supplies and production {{had become so}} deficient that government officials were warning that China was about to repeat the [...] "disaster of 1959", the famines which killed tens of millions during the Great Leap Forward. Deng responded by decollectivizing agriculture and emphasizing the household-responsibility system, which divided {{the land of the}} People's communes into private plots. Under the new policy, peasants were able to exercise formal control of their land as long as they sold a contracted portion of their crops to the government. This move increased agricultural production by 25 percent between 1975 and 1985, setting a precedent for privatizing other parts of the economy. The bottom-up approach of the reforms promoted by Deng, in contrast to the <b>top-down</b> <b>approach</b> of the Perestroika in the former Soviet Union, is considered an important factor contributing to the success of China’s economic transition.|$|E
