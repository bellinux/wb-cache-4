Although I could not decipher their meaning, it was impossible for me <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> as having been entirely accidental. The feeling is constantly growing on me that I had been the first to hear the greeting of one planet to another.|$|E

25|$|The real {{numbers are}} uniquely {{specified}} by the above properties. More precisely, given any two Dedekind-complete ordered fields ℝ1 and ℝ2, there exists a unique field isomorphism from ℝ1 to ℝ2, allowing us <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> as essentially the same mathematical object.|$|E

I suppose {{by this time}} they're at their old game of plundering and slaying on the frontier. It's naught to them which side they fight on; scalps and plunder is all they care for." ...|$|R

25|$|In addition, as hand axes can be recycled, resharpened and remade, {{they could}} have been used for varied tasks. For this reason it is {{misleading}} <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> as axes, {{they could have}} been used for tasks such as digging, cutting, scraping, chopping, piercing and hammering. In addition, and given their mass, they may be used as a lithic core to obtain flakes that could be used as knives or transformed for specialized uses through retouching.|$|E
25|$|In December 2005, Aaron Gillego, a {{columnist}} for The Advocate, criticized the series for having never cast an Asian man in the then-13 years of its existence, opining that Asian women have been cast on the show because heterosexual men have been socialized by the media <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> as exotic beauties or sex objects, but that Asian men have been largely invisible in popular media. As of 2017, an Asian man has never been cast in the 25 years of the show's existence.|$|E
500|$|T'Pol's {{analysis}} {{shows that the}} Xindi probe which attacked Earth (in [...] "The Expanse") contained kemocite. Archer then tells Gralik that Degra will use the kemocite to build a weapon, but the Arboreal denies any knowledge of the plan. Back on Enterprise, Commander Tucker also learns that the kemocite {{is the key to}} Reptilian rifle technology. Archer approves his idea to reverse engineer a rifle, but Tucker unknowingly triggers a self-destruct sequence and the weapon is beamed into space. Archer then decides not to destroy the kemocite mining complex as he doesn't want the Xindi <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> as aggressors.|$|E

500|$|Elsewhere, barmaid Clara Oswin Oswald investigates a {{disturbance}} outside the tavern she works at and finds the Doctor walking by. He attempts to leave discreetly, but Clara follows {{him to a}} coach. Not wishing {{to become involved in}} matters, the Doctor instructs Strax to bring him a memory worm that will erase the last hour of Clara's memories with just a touch. Before they can do so, they are surrounded by snowmen created from snow with psychic properties who attack the group. The Doctor realises that Clara's thoughts are creating the snowmen and ends the threat by instructing her <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> melting. Clara cautions the Doctor that if he wipes her memory, she will forget {{how to deal with the}} snowmen. The Doctor reluctantly allows her to go and ascends a staircase to the sky to return to the TARDIS. Clara follows him and knocks on the door, but she hides and flees down the staircase when the Doctor answers. Clara returns to her other job as governess for the children of Captain Latimer. She learns that Latimer's daughter has been having horrible dreams about their previous governess returning from the dead. Clara realises that the pond that contains the old governess' body is the only thing still frozen around them. She attempts to track down the Doctor but instead attracts the attention of Jenny, who takes her to see Vastra. Vastra tells Clara she gets only one word to impress the Doctor with if she wants his help. Clara chooses the word [...] "Pond", which shocks the Doctor and arouses his interest.|$|E
500|$|Gene Seymour of Newsday {{gave the}} film {{three out of}} four stars, saying [...] "And as pop flies go, Cars is pretty to watch, even as it loops, drifts and, at times, looks as if it's just hanging in midair." [...] Colin Covert of the Star Tribune gave the film a {{positive}} review, saying [...] "It takes everything that's made Pixar shorthand for animation excellence -- strong characters, tight pacing, spot-on voice casting, a warm sense of humor and visuals that are pure, pixilated bliss -- and carries them to the next stage." [...] Bill Muller of The Arizona Republic gave the film four out of five stars, saying [...] "The truest measure of the movie is that eventually we forget we're watching a bunch of vehicles with faces and start <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> as individual characters. It's quite an accomplishment, and perhaps one only possible by Pixar." [...] Kenneth Turan of the Los Angeles Times gave the film four out of five stars, saying [...] "What's surprising about this supremely engaging film is the source of its curb appeal: It has heart." [...] Stephen Hunter of The Washington Post gave the film a positive review, saying [...] "It's the latest concoction from the geniuses at Pixar, probably the most inventive of the Computer Generated Imagery shop -- and the film's great fun, if well under the level of the first Toy Story." [...] Jessica Reaves of the Chicago Tribune gave the film {{two and a half stars}} out of four, saying [...] "While it's a technically perfect movie, its tone is too manic, its characters too jaded and, in the end, its story too empty to stand up to expectations." [...] James Berardinelli of ReelViews gave the film {{three out of four}} stars, saying [...] "While Cars may cross the finish line ahead of any of 2006's other animated films, it's several laps behind its Pixar siblings." ...|$|E
2500|$|As tangent vectors to {{a general}} {{manifold}} at a point {{can be defined as}} derivations at that point, it is natural <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> as directional derivatives.

60|$|The {{diversion}} {{accomplished the}} purpose. Emmeline did not faint, and succeeded in plunging, with Cassy, into {{a part of}} the labyrinth of swamp, so deep and dark that it was perfectly hopeless for Legree <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> following <b>them,</b> without assistance.|$|R

6000|$|... "Oh no. My sister {{tells me}} I am always angry {{with people who}} do not say just what I like. But I hope I am not given <b>to</b> <b>think</b> ill <b>of</b> <b>them.</b> In the end I am usually obliged <b>to</b> <b>think</b> ill <b>of</b> myself for being so impatient." ...|$|R
2500|$|Lincoln contrasted {{his support}} for the Declaration with {{opposing}} statements made by the Southern politician John C. Calhoun and Senator John Pettit of Indiana, who called the Declaration [...] "a self-evident lie." [...] Lincoln said that Chief Justice Roger Taney (in his Dred Scott decision) and Stephen Douglas were opposing Thomas Jefferson's self-evident truth, dehumanizing blacks and preparing the public mind <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> as only property. Lincoln thought slavery had to be treated as a wrong, and kept from growing. As Lincoln said: ...|$|E
2500|$|Mark Hollis' lyrics {{reflect his}} {{religious}} and spiritual outlook. Though {{he acknowledges that}} his lyrics are religious, he says they are not based on a specific creed, preferring <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> as [...] "humanitarian." [...] "I Believe in You" [...] {{has been described as}} an [...] "anti-heroin song." [...] When asked whether the lyrics are based on personal experience, Hollis replied, [...] "No, not at all. But, you know, I met people who got totally fucked up on it. Within rock music there's so much fucking glorification of it, and it is a wicked, horrible thing." ...|$|E
2500|$|The term {{sound effect}} ranges {{back to the}} early days of radio. In its Year Book 1931 the BBC {{published}} a major article about [...] "The Use of Sound Effects". It considers sounds effect deeply linked with broadcasting and states: [...] "It would be a great mistake <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> as anologous to punctuation marks and accents in print. They should never be inserted into a programme already existing. The author of a broadcast play or broadcast construction ought to have used Sound Effects as bricks with which to build, treating them as of equal value with speech and music." [...] It lists six [...] "totally different primary genres of Sound Effect": ...|$|E

2500|$|Some {{effective}} {{anger management}} techniques include relaxation techniques, monitored breathing exercises, cognitive restructuring and imagery (e.g. Stosny's Healing imagery Explain oneself emphatically what {{and why it}} makes you respond angrily Apply kindness and compassion to self Love oneself Solving the co-morbid problems phases), problem solving, [...] improving communication strategies and interpersonal skills (DEAR MAN & GIVE). Below are specific types of anger management treatment approaches supported by empirical studies. [...] Several of the studies examined used self-report, which some psychologists feel could be a limitation for results. People do not want others <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>them</b> as angry individuals, so their answers could be changed to fit how society wants them to behave.|$|E

5000|$|Although Buffy is {{back with}} the Watchers' Council, which pays its Watchers (including Giles) and appears to have financially {{supported}} other Slayers such as Kendra, no one appears <b>to</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> asking <b>them</b> <b>to</b> put Buffy on their payroll. This may be because Kendra was a one-off, or the show's creators wanted Buffy more grounded; to face financial crisis with no true 'happy ending'.|$|R
