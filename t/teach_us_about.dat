Scully stated that the scene was included because it [...] "was {{a chance to get}} the world's smartest man and the world's stupidest man in the same place". In the scene, Hawking tells Homer [...] "Your theory of a donut-shaped universe is intriguing... I may have to steal it." [...] In his book What's science ever done for us?: what The Simpsons can <b>teach</b> <b>us</b> <b>about</b> physics, robots, life and the universe, Paul Halpern wrote that in mathematics, a [...] "donut-shape", the three-dimensional generalization of a ring, is referred to as a torus.

[...] {{at the beginning of}} Halpern's section on [...] "Mechanical Plots". Halpern describes Lisa's efforts to build a perpetual-motion machine while bored during the teachers strike, and comments that though it is absurd in reality to order someone to obey the laws of thermodynamics, he acknowledges that [...] "physicists sometimes don't know the proper arena within which certain laws apply". In the July 26, 2007 issue of Nature, the scientific journal's editorial staff listed [...] "The PTA Disbands" [...] among [...] "The Top Ten science moments in The Simpsons", writing: [...] "Lisa gets so bored by a lack of schooling she builds a perpetual motion machine.

Lee then begins shoving a The Thing action figure into the Batmobile, effectively destroying it. This scene pokes fun at the DC vs. Marvel rivalry (Batman's Batmobile of DC Comics and The Thing a property of Marvel Comics). Another scene in the episode references Danish physicist Niels Bohr. In his book What's Science Ever Done For Us: What the Simpsons Can <b>Teach</b> <b>Us</b> <b>About</b> Physics, Robots, Life, and the Universe, Paul Halpern wrote [...] "In the episode , one of Homer's favorite TV shows is preempted by the program The Boring World of Niels Bohr. Homer is so upset that he clutches an ice-cream sandwich, aims it at the screen like it's a remote control, squeezes out its contents, and splatters Bohr's image. In contrast to Homer's reaction, most physicists heap nothing but accolades upon Bohr, whose revolutionary ideas shaped the modern concept of the atom." ...|$|E

500|$|The episode also {{features}} an environmentalism theme. This theme {{is present in}} the nuclear power plant's polluting of Lake Springfield, which causes the fish of the lake to become mutated. University of the Sciences in Philadelphia physics and mathematics professor Paul Halpern discussed the episode in his book What's Science Ever Done for Us?: What the Simpsons Can <b>Teach</b> <b>Us</b> <b>About</b> Physics, Robots, Life, and the Universe. He comments: [...] "Considering the fact that [...] natural selection takes generations and that successful varieties must sustain a survival advantage over others, the only way Mr. Burns can prove his assertion [...] is by tracking Blinky over time to see if the third eye allows the mutant fish to find food more quickly or dodge predators." [...] Mark Meister and Phyllis M. Japp discuss the environmental theme of the episode in their book Enviropop: Studies in Environmental Rhetoric and Popular Culture. The authors think human pollution is characterized in the episode as an improvement on nature, and human progress is viewed as an [...] "integral" [...] part of human evolution. They add: [...] "These references articulate specific criticism of current environmental regulations, specifically the lax enforcement of the regulations concerning the dumping, safe storage, and disposal of nuclear waste. Furthermore, this episode condemns the manipulation of political and economic power to disguise ecological accountability and to shift blame for environmental problems." [...] The authors also say the episode comments on the lack of adherence to safety standards for the plant, and criticizes the [...] "apathetic acceptance" [...] of unforced environmental inspections. In addition, they comment that the episode [...] "explicitly criticizes media spin-doctors who distort the impacts of ecological degradation caused by wealthy corporations such as the nuclear power plant." ...|$|E

2500|$|Gee's {{current work}} in the field of new literacies has seen him shift in his {{research}} focus somewhat from studying language-in-use to examining the D/iscourses of a range of new social practices—with a particular emphasis on video games and learning. Gee applies many key concepts from his previous research to studying video games. For example, Gee continues to argue that if we take reading to mean gaining understanding (instead of simply decoding letter sounds and words), one {{needs to be able to}} recognize or produce meanings inherent to any one semiotic domain in order to be literate in that domain. As such, and as Gee sets out in his text What Video Games Have to <b>Teach</b> <b>Us</b> <b>About</b> Learning and Literacy, one can be literate in the semiotic domain of video games if he or she “can recognize (the equivalent of “reading”) and/or produce (the equivalent of “writing”) meanings” in the video game domain. Therefore, because new literacies are multiple and attached to social and cultural practices, Gee explains that people need to (1) be literate in many different [...] semiotic domains, and (2) be able to become literate in other *new* semiotic domains throughout their lives. This theoretical orientation aligns with {{work in the}} broad field of [...] "new literacies" [...] research—by colleagues such as Colin Lankshear, Michele Knobel, Henry Jenkins, Kevin Leander, Rebecca Black, Kurt Squire, and Constance Steinkuehler, among others.|$|E

60|$|Well, we will go: but not, I think, to-day. Indeed I {{hardly know}} how we could get as far as Reading; {{for all the world}} is in the hay-field, and even the old horse must go thither too, and take his turn at the hay-cart. Well, the rocks have been where they are for many a year, and they will wait our leisure patiently enough: but Midsummer and the hay- field will not wait. Let us take what God gives when He sends it, and learn the lesson that lies nearest to us. After all, it is more to my old mind, and perhaps to your young mind too, to look at things which are young and fresh and living, rather than things which are old and worn and dead. Let us leave the old stones, and the old bones, and the old shells, the wrecks of ancient worlds which have gone down into the kingdom of death, to teach us their grand lessons some other day; and let us look now at the world of light and life and beauty, which begins here at the open door, and {{stretches}} away over the hay-fields, over the woods, over the southern moors, over sunny France, and sunnier Spain, and over the tropic seas, down to the equator, and the palm-groves of the eternal summer.

France can teach us how to levy village and city taxes which distribute the burden with a nearer approach to perfect fairness than is the case in any other land; and she can teach us the wisest and surest system of collecting them that exists. She can teach us how to elect a President in a sane way; and also how to do it without throwing the country into earthquakes and convulsions that cripple and embarrass business, stir up party hatred in the hearts of men, and make peaceful people wish the term extended to thirty years. France can teach us--but enough of that part of the question. And what else can France teach us? She can teach us all the fine arts--and does. She throws open her hospitable art academies, and says to us, [...] "Come"--and we come, troops and troops of our young and gifted; and she sets over us the ablest masters in the world and bearing the greatest names; and she, teaches us all that we are capable of learning, and persuades us and encourages us with prizes and honors, much as if we were somehow children of her own; and when this noble education is finished and we are ready to carry it home and spread its gracious ministries abroad over our nation, and we come with homage and gratitude and ask France for the bill--there is nothing to pay. And in return for this imperial generosity, what does America do? She charges a duty on French works of art! ...|$|E
50|$|It {{might seem}} ironic that Nietzsche’s {{answer to the}} death of God is itself religious. Seung confesses that this is the last thing he {{expected}} to discover when he embarked on his work. But Nietzsche’s Dionysian religion, unlike the Judeo-Christian religious tradition which preceded it, is a naturalized form of religion. It repudiates the metaphysical view of human agency that girds the Judeo-Christian tradition, substituting a naturalized vision of the self and {{of what it means to}} be human. Seung, however, issues a final warning against taking Zarathustra’s Dionysian transformation for the end of Zarathustra’s travails. At the end of Zarathustra, it appears that the hero’s Faustian self might make a resurgence. Seung explains this by contending that part of what it means to be human, at least at this stage in human history according to Nietzsche, is to be torn between what our Western tradition <b>teaches</b> <b>us</b> <b>about</b> ourselves and what science <b>teaches</b> <b>us</b> <b>about</b> ourselves.|$|R
