5000|$|The {{main reason}} is that the {{factories}} in which they are produced are now capable of better machining and assembly. For example, it is easier to hold tighter tolerances now, and the average surface finish of a new cylinder wall has improved. Manufacturers decades ago were capable of such accuracy and precision, but not with as low a unit cost or with as much ease. Therefore, the average engine made today resembles, in some technical respects, the top-end custom work of back then. For some equipment, break-in is now done at the factory, obviating end-user break-in. This is advantageous for several reasons. It is a selling point with customers who don't want <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>worry</b> about break-in and want full performance [...] "right out of the box". And it also aligns with the fact that compliance rates are always uncertain in the hands of end users. As with medical compliance or regulatory compliance, an authority can give all the instructions it wants, but {{there is no guarantee that}} the end user will follow them.|$|E
50|$|Generally speaking, wakeboard {{specific}} {{boats are}} V-drive boats. This means {{they are an}} inboard boat with the engine placed backwards {{in the rear of}} the boat. This is done to keep more weight in the back of the boat and make the wake larger. Some wakeboard specific boat models are direct drive boats where the engine is in the middle of the boat. Most wakeboard boats will have several features that help to create large wakes. These include ballast, hydrofoil, and hull technology. Ballast is a simple term for weight. When wakeboard boats have ballast tanks, it means that they have room for extra weight to weigh the boat down for larger wakes. For example. If the rider is surfing on the starboard side of the stern. Then you want to activate the starboard ballast in order to give the rider a surf-able wave. All these key features would not be anything if it was not for cruise control. Cruise control innovated wake boarding. Throttles on v drive boats are extremely sensitive and it is hard to get to the desired speed of the rider. When cruise control is set the driver can push the throttle all the way down and the boat will not go any faster than the desired speed. It locks the engine in at that rpm. Cruise control is also very safe because when pulling a rider there is a lot <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>worry</b> about. Cruise control minuses one less worry allowing for a fun wakeboard run.|$|E

40|$|From an application's {{point of}} view it is {{desirable}} <b>to</b> not <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>worry</b> {{about the details of}} security, but only to state the kind of security required for distributed applications. The Open Distributed Processing (ODP) framework has identified a set of security functions, but not how these should be applied within the framework. It is also not clear how to apply the various concepts developed within the ODP framework to real systems. This paper makes an attempt to model distributed applications, using an OSI distributed management application as an example, into the ODP framework. More specifically it is shown how a distributed application is modelled in the Engineering Viewpoint and how security services can be provided transparently by the implementation platform.

40|$|NASA {{has been}} {{interested}} in wireless communications for many years, especially when the crew size of the International Space Station (ISS) was reduced to two members. NASA began a study {{to find ways to}} improve crew efficiency to make sure the ISS could be maintained with limited crew capacity and still be a valuable research testbed in Low-Earth Orbit (LEO). Currently the ISS audio system requires astronauts to be tethered to the audio system, specifically a device called the Audio Terminal Unit (ATU). Wireless communications would remove the tether and allow astronauts to freely float from experiment <b>to</b> experiment without <b>having</b> <b>to</b> <b>worry</b> about moving and reconnecting the associated cabling or finding the space equivalent of an extension cord. A wireless communication system would also improve safety and reduce system susceptibility to Electromagnetic Interference (EMI). Safety would be improved because a crewmember could quickly escape a fire while maintaining communications with the ground and other crewmembers at any location. In addition, it would allow the crew to overcome the volume limitations of the ISS ATU. This is especially important to the Portable Breathing Apparatus (PBA). The next generation of space vehicles and habitats also demand wireless attention. Orion will carry up to six crewmembers in a relatively small cabin. Yet, wireless could become a driving factor to reduce launch weight and increase habitable volume. Six crewmembers, each tethered to a panel, could result in a wiring mess even in nominal operations. In addition to Orion, research is being conducted to determine if Bluetooth is appropriate for Lunar Habitat applications...|$|R
