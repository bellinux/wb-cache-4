5|$|After {{the end of}} the war, Pillau was ceded to Italy as a war {{prize in}} 1920. Renamed Bari, she was {{commissioned}} in the Regia Marina (Royal Navy) in January 1924. She was modified and rebuilt several <b>times</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> next two decades. In the early years of World War II, she provided gunfire support to Italian troops in several engagements in the Mediterranean. In 1943, she was slated to become an anti-aircraft defense ship, but while awaiting conversion, she was sunk by USAAF bombers in Livorno in June 1943. The wreck was partially scrapped by the Germans in 1944, and ultimately raised for scrapping in January 1948.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{studies the}} mean {{first passage time}} (or exit time, or escape <b>time)</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> non-fluctuating {{potential}} barrier for a system driven only by a dichotomous noise.

In the case that <b>the</b> particles escape <b>over</b> <b>the</b> potential barrier, a resonant activation phenomenon for the mean first passage <b>time</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> potential barrier is obtained...|$|R

5|$|Braithwaite {{was taken}} to Enfield Police Station and interviewed by Det Sgt Dermot McDermott and Detective Constable Colin Biggar.

He was interviewed eight <b>times</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> first two days, and with a lawyer present four times on the third. During the first 30 hours of his detention he had nothing to eat, and said in court – as did several other suspects – that the heat in the cells was oppressive, making it difficult to breathe.|$|E

It was then rescheduled to the preceding Wednesday, in the 9 pm slot. The series lost two million viewers over two weeks and ITV pulled episode four from the schedules on the morning before it was due for broadcast, replacing it with It Shouldn't Happen on a TV Soap, a bloopers programme, which returned ITV's ratings to above the five million mark.|$|E
5|$|Excavations {{under the}} {{supervision}} of the Deutsches Archäologisches Institut Kairo (DAIK) in 2001 and 2004 revealed that the tomb had been erected and completed in a great hurry. The building works took place in a single phase; the walls were plastered roughly; and the monument had collapsed several <b>times</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> centuries. During the Middle Kingdom, Peribsen's tomb was restored at least twice together with the tomb of Djer, which was thought to be that of Osiris.|$|E

Even though the magazine tried to ban the topic numerous <b>times</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> decades since, readers kept sending in curious examples. These included the U.S. Navy spokesman put up to answer journalists' questions about the Guantanamo Bay detention camp, one Lieutenant Mike Kafka; authors of the book The Imperial Animal Lionel Tiger and Robin Fox; and the UK Association of Chief Police Officers' spokesman on knife crime, Alfred Hitchcock.|$|E
5|$|Gilbert and Sullivan {{disagreed}} several <b>times</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> {{choice of}} a subject. After both Princess Ida and Ruddigore, which were less successful than the seven other operas from H.M.S. Pinafore to The Gondoliers, Sullivan asked to leave the partnership, saying that he found Gilbert's plots repetitive and that the operas were not artistically satisfying to him. While the two artists worked out their differences, Carte kept the Savoy open with revivals of their earlier works. On each occasion, after a few months' pause, Gilbert responded with a libretto that met Sullivan's objections, and the partnership was able to continue successfully.|$|E

5|$|Medina {{surrendered}} peacefully to Roger I of Sicily {{after a short}} siege in 1091, and Malta {{was subsequently}} incorporated into the County and later the Kingdom of Sicily, being dominated by a succession of feudal lords. The fortifications of Mdina were rebuilt and modified a number of <b>times</b> <b>over</b> <b>the</b> following centuries. A castle known as the Castellu di la Chitati or the castrum civitas {{was built on the}} southeast corner of the city near the main entrance, probably on the site of an earlier Byzantine fort. The city withstood a siege by Hafsid invaders in 1429.|$|E
