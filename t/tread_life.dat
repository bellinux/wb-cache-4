The high back bucket seats were still available on the two-door models. The hood release was moved to inside, for increased security. Radial tires were also a new option, and offered longer <b>tread</b> <b>life</b> and better road manners. The standard engine remained as the 250 CID inline-six for all models, except the station wagons and Sport which used the 302-2V.

5000|$|High-performance {{tires are}} {{designed}} for use at higher speeds, and more often, a more [...] "sporty" [...] driving style.

50|$|However, {{the white}} rubber {{did not offer}} {{sufficient}} endurance, so carbon black {{was added to the}} rubber to greatly increase <b>tread</b> <b>life.</b> Using carbon black only in the tread produced tires with inner and outer sidewalls of white rubber, which is where whitewall tires came from.|$|E

50|$|Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company {{developed}} a fibrous material, five times stronger than steel, for NASA {{to use in}} parachute shrouds to soft-land the Viking Lander spacecraft on the Martian surface. Recognizing the durability of the material, Goodyear expanded the technology {{and went on to}} produce a new radial tire with a <b>tread</b> <b>life</b> expected to be 10000 mi greater than conventional radials.|$|E
50|$|BFGoodrich {{produced}} the first radial tires in the United States in 1965. This innovation made tires even safer as the radial type tire have longer <b>tread</b> <b>life</b> and permit better absorption of road bumps. The company patented an early sort of run-flat tire two years later, in 1967. This technology enables {{the vehicle to}} continue to be driven in emergencies by avoiding that the tire becomes flat instantly.|$|E
50|$|This {{ability to}} {{fine-tune}} ball-jointed suspension allows manufacturers {{to make the}} automobile more stable and easier to steer, compared to the older kingpin style suspension. It may also be quieter and more comfortable, because lateral and fore and aft compliance in the suspension can be introduced in controlled amounts at the control arm inner pivots without compromising {{the integrity of the}} steering axis pivots, which are now ball joints instead of a king pin and trunnions. The smoother ride may also increase tire <b>tread</b> <b>life,</b> since the ball-joint suspension allows better control of suspension geometry and so can provide better tire-to-road contact.|$|E

5000|$|Radial tire {{construction}} utilizes body ply cords {{extending from the}} beads and across the tread so that the cords are laid at approximately right angles to the centerline of the tread, and parallel to each other, as well as stabilizer belts directly beneath the tread. The belts may be cord or steel. The advantages of this construction include longer <b>tread</b> <b>life,</b> better steering control, fewer blowouts, improved fuel economy, and lower rolling resistance. Disadvantages of the radial tire are a harder ride at low speeds on rough roads and {{in the context of}} off-roading, decreased [...] "self-cleaning" [...] ability and lower grip ability at low speeds.|$|E
50|$|Early {{automobile}} tires {{were made}} of pure natural rubber with various chemicals mixed into the tread compounds to make them wear better. The best of these was zinc oxide, a pure white substance that increased traction and also made the entire tire white. However, the white rubber did not offer sufficient endurance, so carbon black {{was added to the}} rubber to greatly increase <b>tread</b> <b>life.</b> Using carbon black only in the tread produced tires with inner and outer sidewalls of white rubber. Later, entirely black tires became available, the still extant white sidewalls being covered with a somewhat thin, black colored layer of rubber. Should a black sidewall tire have been severely scuffed against a curb, the underlying white rubber would be revealed; it is in a similar manner that raised white letter (RWL) tires are made.|$|E
50|$|The first {{radial tyres}} for cars {{appeared}} in 1943, but motorcyclists waited forty more years for this technology {{to come to}} motorcycles. These were the 1983 Pirelli MP7 radials, introduced on the European version of the 1984 Honda VF1000R, a limited edition exotic motorcycle that showcased {{a number of new}} technologies including carbon fibre reinforced bodywork and air-adjustable anti-dive front forks. The new radial tyres had to provide race-replica handling for the very heavy 524 lb dry weight chassis, up to a top speed of 150 mph, making it the fastest production motorcycle of its day. The MP7 radials came to the US market in 1985. Radial construction uses textile or steel belts arranged at 90 degrees to the direction of travel, along with a layer of belts running around the tyre's circumference, with motorcycle radials deviating from the true radial design by adding belts running at angles to the radial belts, in the manner of bias-ply tyres, allowing the grip, durability, feel, and other characteristics to be adjusted to suit the tyre's design. The benefit of radial tyres is that the tyres run cooler yet maintain great flexibility, allowing engineers to coax significant increases in both grip and <b>tread</b> <b>life,</b> without compromise, under a broader range of conditions than bias-ply tyres.|$|E

See both these cases in one person, even that goodly beloved David. When the Lord did rebuke him for sin, then he cries, O blood guiltiness, O 'cast me not away from thy presence' (Psa 51:11). But when he at another time knew himself guiltless, though then also sorely afflicted, behold with what boldness he turns his face unto God; 'O Lord, my God,' saith he, 'if I have done this; if there be iniquity in my hands; if I have rewarded evil unto him that was at peace with me; [yea, I have delivered him that without cause is mine enemy] let the enemy persecute my soul, and take it; yea, let him <b>tread</b> down my <b>life</b> upon the earth, and lay mine honour in the dust.
