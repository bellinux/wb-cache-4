5|$|Gaudí complemented this organic {{vision of}} {{architecture}} {{with a unique}} spatial vision {{that allowed him to}} conceive his designs in three dimensions, unlike the flat design of <b>traditional</b> <b>architecture.</b> He used to say that he had acquired this spatial sense as a boy by looking at the drawings his father made of the boilers and stills he produced. Because of this spatial conception, Gaudí always preferred to work with casts and scale models or even improvise on-site as a work progressed. Reluctant to draw plans, only on rare occasions did he sketch his works—in fact, only when required by authorities.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{argues that}} {{essentially}} Nader Ardalan {{has tried to}} enrich contemporary architecture of his time with his understanding of <b>traditional</b> Islamic <b>architecture.</b> Consequently, this paper pays attention to Nader Ardalan’s works and thought.

This article particularly concludes that despite the rise of technology of construction and modification of context and eco-social forces which are apparent over the three decades of design, the principles of <b>traditional</b> Islamic <b>architecture</b> can be identified conceptually within Ardalan’s projects to differing degrees...|$|R

This paper is {{a synthesis of}} the image of the appearances for Japanese/Korean and Japanese/Taiwanese <b>traditional</b> <b>architectures</b> through the their subjects' cognitive structure. The images for all architectures in this research were mainly in modesty-order, strictness-hardness, and looseness-softness. The members which strongly influenced on the image are roof and column/wall with various layouts, shapes and colors. The common image in those architectures is modesty and order, representing harmony of nature. Japanese subjectives are represented as to be stricter and harder than Korean or Taiwanese. On the other hand, Korean or Taiwanese as to be looser and softer than Japanese, which was considered as related with the idea of their high level at that period...|$|R

25|$|In {{the first}} years of the Turkish Republic, founded in 1923, Turkish {{architecture}} was influenced by Ottoman architecture, in particular during the First National Architectural Movement. However, from the 1930s, architectural styles started to differ from <b>traditional</b> <b>architecture,</b> also as a result of an increasing number of foreign architects being invited to work in the country, mostly from Germany and Austria. The Second World War was a period of isolation, during which the Second National Architectural Movement emerged. Similar to Fascist architecture, the movement aimed to create modern but nationalistic architecture.|$|E

25|$|Several Acehnese architects have {{attempted}} to modernize the <b>traditional</b> <b>architecture</b> of Aceh. One attempt is to replicate the roof canopy of the Cakra Donya bell (an ancient relic in Aceh) into the auditorium of the State Museum of Aceh. This reinterpretation of the Cakra Donya roof was completed by Wim Sutrisno, a local architect. The Cakra Donya roof style has become popular in Aceh {{and can be found}} decorating the gates to hotels or bus shelter roofs. The gable roof has also been reinterpreted in many buildings, often with double gable screens, complete with a protruding wooden screen.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the prime}} {{examples}} of early western architecture was the Rokumeikan, a large two-story building in Tokyo, completed in 1883, which {{was to become a}} controversial symbol of Westernisation in the Meiji period. Commissioned for the housing of foreign guests by the Foreign Minister Inoue Kaoru, it was designed by Josiah Conder, a prominent foreign government advisors in Meiji Japan (o-yatoi gaikokujin). The Ryōunkaku was Japan's first western-style skyscraper, constructed in 1890 in Asakusa. However <b>traditional</b> <b>architecture</b> was still employed for new buildings, such as the Kyūden of Tokyo Imperial Palace, albeit with token western elements such as a spouting water fountain in the gardens.|$|E

[...] He dismissed them, declaring his intention to hire [...] "the very best contemporary architect in the world to design our library".|$|E

500|$|Upon {{his return}} to Moscow, Lissitzky {{attended}} the Polytechnic Institute of Riga, which had been evacuated to Moscow because of the war, and worked for the architectural firms of Boris Velikovsky and Roman Klein. [...] During this work, he took an active and passionate interest in Jewish culture which, after {{the downfall of the}} openly antisemitic Tsarist regime, was experiencing a renaissance. The new Provisional Government repealed a decree that prohibited the printing of Hebrew letters and that barred Jews from citizenship. Thus Lissitzky soon devoted himself to Jewish art, exhibiting works by local Jewish artists, traveling to Mahilyow to study the <b>traditional</b> <b>architecture</b> and ornaments of old synagogues, and illustrating many Yiddish children's books. These books were Lissitzky's first major foray in book design, a field that he would greatly innovate during his career.|$|E
