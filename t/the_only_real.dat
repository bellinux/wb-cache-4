5|$|NESCo were {{represented}} by Craig Henderson and Sydney Turner. The NESCo representatives argued {{that although the}} company already supplied around 85% of the North East region, {{a great deal more}} generating capacity would need to be built to meet the demand for years to come, and that the mid-Durham area was the best place to erect a new station. Henderson claimed <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>real</b> opposition to the scheme was that it would interfere with the amenities of Durham. John Hacking, chief engineer of the Central Electricity Board, backed NESCo because if the scheme were declined, and consent and new arrangements had to be made, they would have no new plant in operation until after 1948.|$|E
5|$|On 18 March 1970, taking {{advantage}} of a visit by Sihanouk to Moscow and Beijing, the prince was deposed by the National Assembly, who promptly announced the creation of the Khmer Republic. The real power, however, fell into the hands of Lon Nol. The general promptly issued an ultimatum to the North Vietnamese, ordering them out of the country, but <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>real</b> result was that the Cambodian Army led a bloody pogrom against ethnic Vietnamese in the eastern provinces.|$|E
5|$|The {{location}} of Nemausus (Nîmes) was somewhat inconvenient {{when it came}} to providing a water supply. Plains lie to the city's south and east, where any sources of water would be at too low an altitude to be able to flow to the city, while the hills to the west made a water supply route too difficult from an engineering point of view. <b>The</b> <b>only</b> <b>real</b> alternative was to look to the north and in particular to the area around Ucetia (Uzès), where there are natural springs.|$|E

5|$|By 1169 Coutances held a canonry in Rouen Cathedral. During the 1170s a {{group of}} royal clerks rose to prominence, among them Coutances, Walter Map, Ralph Diceto, John of Oxford, Richard of Ilchester, and Geoffrey Ridel. Coutances was the {{chaplain}} to Henry the Young King, eldest living son of King Henry, but when the younger Henry rebelled against his father in 1173, Coutances returned to King Henry's service. He became Archdeacon of Oxford, perhaps by 1173, certainly by 14 March 1176. He was named vice-chancellor when Ralph de Warneville became Chancellor of England, which occurred in 1173. In 1176 and 1177, King Henry sent Coutances on diplomatic missions to Flanders and the French royal court. Arnulf, the Bishop of Lisieux, alleged that Henry allowed Coutances to use all the administrative machinery of Normandy to drive Arnulf from his diocese, so that Coutances might become bishop there. This happened in early 1178, but <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>real</b> evidence for this effort on Coutances' part comes from Arnulf's correspondence, and as Coutances was back in England by July 1178, {{it does not appear}} that the attempt was a sustained one.|$|E
5|$|Design {{work on the}} Type 34-class destroyers {{began in}} 1932, around the time that Weimar Germany renounced the {{armament}} limitations of the Versailles Treaty that had ended World War I. Initial designs were for large ships {{more powerful than the}} French and Polish destroyers then in service, but the design grew as the Kriegsmarine now expected it to serve as a small cruiser. The design work appears to have been rushed and not well-thought out as the short forecastle and lack of flare at the bow compromised the ships' seakeeping ability and their stability was inadequate. <b>The</b> <b>only</b> <b>real</b> innovative part of the design, the high-pressure boilers, were an over-complicated design that received almost no shipboard testing before being installed in the Type 34s and frequently broke down throughout the life of the ships.|$|E
5|$|Fitzgibbons {{argues that}} it was not {{impossible}} for Cromwell's body to have been substituted before his posthumous execution. One proposition is that Sergeant Norfolke, who exhumed the bodies from the abbey, found the tombs of Cromwell and Ireton empty, prompting the government to sanction an exhumation of two other graves. This has been put forward because Bradshaw's body arrived at the Red Lion Inn at Holborn a day after Cromwell and Ireton, prompting rumour that he was <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>real</b> body to be hanged at Tyburn. An alternative theory is that Cromwell's friends bribed the guards attending Cromwell's body, “privately interring him in a small paddock near Holborn”, so that when the sledges dragged the bodies to the gallows, Cromwell's body was already buried. The faces on the three bodies, although heavily shrouded, were clearly visible; and since no witnesses expressed any doubt that the bodies were those of Cromwell and Ireton, there is no evidence supporting this theory.|$|E

5|$|Inmates were {{permitted}} {{out into the}} yard on Saturdays and Sundays and on holidays for a maximum of 5 hours. Inmates who worked seven days a week in the kitchen were rewarded with short yard breaks during the weekdays. Badly behaved prisoners were liable to having their yard access rights taken away from them on weekends. The prisoners of Alcatraz {{were permitted}} to play games such as baseball, softball and other sports at these times and intellectual games such as chess. Because of the small size of the yard and the diamond at the end of it, a section of the wall behind the first base had to be padded to cushion the impact of inmates overrunning it. Inmates were provided gloves, bats, and balls, but no sport uniforms. In 1938, there were four amateur teams, the Bees, Oaks, Oilers, and Seals, named after Minor League clubs, and four league teams named after Major League clubs, the Cardinals, Cubs, Giants, and Tigers. Many of the inmates used weekends in the yards to converse with each other and discuss crime, <b>the</b> <b>only</b> <b>real</b> opportunities they had during the week for a durable conversation.|$|E
5|$|The three {{language}} formula was {{not strictly}} enforced either in South or Hindi-speaking areas. The changes to public services exams were impractical and not well received by government officials. <b>The</b> <b>only</b> <b>real</b> concession {{to the south}} was the assurance that the Official Languages Act would be modified. However, any effort {{to follow through with}} that pledge received stiff resistance. In April 1965, a meeting of a cabinet sub-committee comprising Gulzari lal Nanda, A. K. Sen, Satyanarayan Sinha, Mahavir Tyagi, M. C. Chagla and S. K. Patil and but no southern members debated the issue and could not come to any agreement. The sub-committee recommended the continuation of English and Hindi as joint link languages and was not in favour of either quota system or use of regional languages in public services exams. They drafted an amendment to Official Languages Act incorporating Nehru's assurances explicitly. This Bill guaranteeing the use of English in inter-state and state-Union communications as long as desired by Non-Hindi states was approved for discussion by the Speaker on 25 August. But it was withdrawn after a bitter debate citing inopportune time due to the ongoing Punjabi Suba movement and Kashmir crisis at that time.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>only</b> <b>real</b> {{threat of}} a black {{rebellion}} in Southern Rhodesia during the war occurred in May 1916, immediately after the Company instructed native commissioners in Matabeleland to start recruiting for the Rhodesia Native Regiment. Company officials attempted {{to make clear that}} the RNR comprised volunteers only, and most Matabele chiefs were not unreceptive to the idea—some, including Chief Ndiweni, attempted to encourage enlistment by sending their own sons off to war—but rumours spread in some quarters that black men were going to be involuntarily conscripted wholesale into the unit. Chief Maduna, in Insiza district, briefly threatened insurrection, issuing rifles to 100 men, but he backed down after a few weeks after it became self-evident that conscription was not happening. Some attempted to dissuade potential RNR recruits from signing up, including a black man in Bulawayo who was fined £4 in July 1915 for spreading a false rumour around the city that the British East Africa Transport Corps' black Southern Rhodesian drivers had had their throats cut by the Germans. Matthew Zwimba, founder of the syncretist Church of the White Bird in Mashonaland, received six months' hard labour the following year for advising black men not to join the RNR {{on the grounds that the}} British had, he said, committed crimes against God in 1913.|$|E
