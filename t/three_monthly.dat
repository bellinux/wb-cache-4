5|$|With the {{withdrawal}} of the battalion serving in Singapore as part of the Far East Strategic Reserve, 1973 finally saw all units of the regiment stationed in Australia for the first time. Thus began a period of peace-time soldiering of a sort not before seen in the regiment. The end of National Service significantly diminished the strength of the Army, and at this time the government directed that the number of battalions in the regiment be reduced to six, which was achieved by linking 2 and 4 RAR, 5 and 7 RAR, and 8 and 9 RAR. The strength of units and resources were also reduced, with a shift in strategic and tactical concepts from forward defence to defence of continental Australia. Regardless, from September 1973 the battalions of the regiment provided a company on <b>three</b> <b>monthly</b> rotations to Rifle Company Butterworth in Malaysia as part of the Five Power Defence Arrangements. Meanwhile, the 10th Independent Rifle Company, Royal Australian Regiment (10 IRC) was raised on 23 May 1974 to provide an opposing force for units training at the Jungle Training Centre at Canungra.|$|E

500|$|Three more {{magazines}} began {{publication in}} 1950, all in digest format. [...] The first was Fantasy Fiction, which produced two issues. [...] It included some respectable reprinted material from 1930s issues of Argosy, {{but none of}} the new stories were memorable. [...] In October 1950, Raymond Palmer, who had left Ziff-Davis to become a publisher in his own right, launched Imagination. [...] A serious accident in the summer forced him to turn most of the editing work over to Bea Mahaffey, and after two issues he sold the magazine to William Hamling, who kept it going until 1958. [...] The final magazine of the decade was Worlds Beyond, edited by Damon Knight, which appeared in December 1950, and lasted for <b>three</b> <b>monthly</b> issues; the publisher, Hillman Periodicals, decided to scrap the magazine only days after the first issue went on sale. [...] All three issues featured quality work, and many of the stories have been reprinted frequently; Willam Tenn's [...] "Null-P" [...] and C.M. Kornbluth's [...] "The Mindworm" [...] being perhaps the best-known. [...] Knight included material by non-genre writers such as Graham Greene and Rudyard Kipling, along with genre names such as Katherine MacLean and Lester del Rey. [...] Ashley suggests that had Knight been allowed to continue, the magazine would have been a significant contribution to 1950s science fiction.|$|E
500|$|Lowell's {{earliest}} poems {{were published}} without remuneration in the Southern Literary Messenger in 1840. He {{was inspired to}} new efforts towards self-support and joined with his friend Robert Carter in founding the literary journal The Pioneer. The periodical was distinguished {{by the fact that}} most of its content was new rather than material that had been previously published elsewhere, and by the inclusion of very serious criticism, which covered not only literature but also art and music. Lowell wrote that it would [...] "furnish the intelligent and reflecting portion of the Reading Public with a rational substitute for the enormous quantity of thrice-diluted trash, in the shape of namby-pamby love tales and sketches, which is monthly poured out to them by many of our popular Magazines." [...] William Wetmore Story noted the journal's higher taste, writing that [...] "it took some stand & appealled to a higher intellectual Standard than our [...] milk or watery namby-pamby Mags with which we are overrun". The first issue of the journal included the first appearance of [...] "The Tell-Tale Heart" [...] by Edgar Allan Poe. Lowell was treated for an eye disease in New York shortly after the first issue, and in his absence Carter did a poor job of managing the journal. The magazine ceased publication after <b>three</b> <b>monthly</b> numbers beginning in January 1843, leaving Lowell $1,800 in debt. Poe mourned the journal's demise, calling it [...] "a most severe blow to the causeâ€”the cause of a Pure Taste".|$|E
