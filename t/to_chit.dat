5000|$|Pratyaksha {{refers to}} the faculties of {{perception}} with which are connected thoughts (Chinta), imagination (Kalpana) and volition (Praytna), which four together as Chetas illuminate the Manas, the ordinary mental equipment of the individual, and give awareness or consciousness (Chetna). [...] There are four types of valid perceptions - a) Indriya pratyaksha or sense perception, b) Manas pratyaksha or mental perception, c) Svavedana pratyaksha or self-consciousness, and d) Yoga pratyaksha or super normal intuition. In sense perception, which is an indeterminate perception the chittashakti (intelligence-energy) acts as the substratum of the senses. Mental perception arises when chittashakti, {{with the aid of}} Buddhi, reflects upon objects of senses, and is a determinate perception.

40|$|Objectives: We {{investigated}} whether plasma chitotriosidase {{activity is}} related to Obstructive Sleep Apnea (OSA) conditions and is correlated with biochemical variables present in the EPISONO database. This is the first study conducted in an epidemiological and nutritional transition country using subjects from the EPISONO population-based cross-sectional study. Design and methods: Chitotriosidase (CHIT) activity was determined by fluorimetric assay. OSA classification was defined as an apnea-hypopnea index. the correlations were investigated using a multiple regression linear model and statistical criteria, with CHIT {{as the dependent variable}} and correlated variables (from the EPISONO database) as independent variables, to access the contribution of each one to the variation in CHIT activity. Results: No significant difference was observed when comparing the mean CHIT activities of different apnea groups. the prevalence of the CHIT 1 24 -bp duplication from patients with severe apnea was higher than in controls. in a multiple regression linear model, CHIT concentration was positively associated with age, creatine and testosterone. Age was the strongest predictor of CHIT variation, followed by gender, waist circumference and TNF alpha. levels. the whole regression model explained 14 % of the CHIT variation. Conclusion: Many variables are related <b>to</b> <b>CHIT</b> activity and show evidence of the multifactor and potentially synergistic character of this enzyme. in this study, we found that age, gender, TNF alpha, Hcy, sleep efficiency and waist circumference were responsible for approximately 14 % of CHIT variation.

40|$|Acetic acid acts as {{a signal}} molecule, {{strongly}} enhancing xanthone biosynthesis in Hypericum perforatum root cultures. This activity is specific, {{as demonstrated by the}} comparison with other short-chain monocarboxylic acids. We have recently demonstrated that Hypericum perforatum root cultures constitutively produce xanthones at higher levels than the root of the plant and that they respond to chitosan (CHIT) elicitation with a noteworthy increase in xanthone production. In the present study, CHIT was administered to H. perforatum root cultures using three different elicitation protocols, and the increase in xanthone production was evaluated. The best results (550 % xanthone increase) were obtained by subjecting the roots to a single elicitation with 200 mg l- 1 CHIT and maintaining the elicitor in the culture medium for 7 days. To discriminate the effect of CHIT from that of the solvent, control experiments were performed by administering AcOH alone at the same concentration used for CHIT solubilization. Unexpectedly, AcOH caused an increase in xanthone production comparable to that observed in response <b>to</b> <b>CHIT.</b> Feeding experiments with 13 C-labeled AcOH demonstrated that this compound was not incorporated into the xanthone skeleton. Other short-chain monocarboxylic acids (i. e., propionic and butyric acid) have little or no effect on the production of xanthones. These results indicate that AcOH {{acts as a}} specific signal molecule, able to greatly enhance xanthone biosynthesis in H. perforatum root cultures...|$|E
40|$|Chitinases are slow-reacting but {{important}} enzymes {{as they are}} anticipated to have diverse applications. The role of a chitin-binding domain (ChBD) in enhancing the quality of binding is essential information for purposeful engineering of chitinases. The idea of making hybrid chiti-nases by fusing a known ChBD to a chitinase, which natur-ally lacks ChBD is of interest especially for bio-controlling purposes. Therefore, in the present study, the ChBD of Serratia marcescens chitinase B was selected and fused to the fungal chitinase, Trichoderma atroviride Chit 42. Both Chit 42 and chemric Chit 42 (ChC) showed similar activity towards colloidal chitin with specificity constants of 0. 83 and 1. 07 min 21, respectively, same optimum temperatures (408 C), and similar optimum pH (4 and 4. 5, respectively). In the presence of insoluble chitin, ChC showed higher ac-tivity (70 %) and obtained a remarkably higher binding constant (700 times). Spectroscopic studies indicated that chimerization of Chit 42 caused some structural changes, {{which resulted in a}} reduction of a-helix in ChC structure. Chemical and thermal stability studies suggested that ChC had a more stable structure than Chit 42. Hill analysis of the binding data revealed mixed-cooperativity with positive cooperativity governing at ChC concentrations below 0. 5 and above 2 mM in the presence of insoluble chitin. It is suggested that the addition of the ChBD <b>to</b> <b>Chit</b> 42 affords structural changes which enhance the binding ability of ChC to insoluble chitin, improving its catalytic efficiency and increasing its thermal and chemical stability...|$|E
40|$|Chitotriosidase (CHIT 1) is a {{chitinase}} that is secreted by activated macrophages. Plasma chitotriosidase activity {{reflects the}} presence of lipid-laden macrophages in patients with Gaucher disease. CHIT 1 activity can be conveniently measured using fluorogenic 4 -methylumbelliferyl (4 MU) -chitotrioside or 4 MU-chitobioside as the substrate, however, nonsaturating concentrations have to be used because of apparent substrate inhibition. Saturating substrate concentrations can, however, be used with the newly designed substrate 4 MU-deoxychitobioside. We studied {{the impact of a}} known polymorphism, G 102 S, on the catalytic properties of CHIT 1. The G 102 S allele was found to be common in type I Gaucher disease patients in the Netherlands (similar to 24 % of alleles). The catalytic efficiency of recombinant Ser 102 CHIT 1 was similar to 70 % that of wild-type Gly 102 CHIT 1 when measured with 4 MU-chitotrioside at a nonsaturating concentration. However, the activity was normal with 4 MU-deoxychitobioside as the substrate at saturating concentrations, consistent with predictions from molecular dynamics simulations. In conclusion, interpretation of CHIT 1 activity measurements with 4 MU-chitotrioside with respect <b>to</b> <b>CHIT</b> 1 protein concentrations depends on {{the presence of}} Ser 102 CHIT 1 in an individual, complicating estimation of the body burden of storage macrophages.

40|$|Hypericum perforatum L. (Hypericaceae), {{popularly known}} as St. John’s wort, is a {{medicinal}} plant widely used in folk medicine [1]. It is known mainly for its antidepressant activity, and nowadays St. John’s wort preparations {{are among the most}} widely prescribed drugs for depression in many European countries [2]. Since the secondary metabolites responsible for the antidepressant activity (e. g. hyperforins and hypericins) are mainly accumulated in leaves and flowers, the chemical composition and the medicinal properties of aerial parts have been extensively investigated [3]. Differently the root has been poorly studied and only recently it has been recognized as an attractive source of bioactive secondary metabolites [4]. We have recently demonstrated that H. perforatum root cultures constitutively produce xanthones at higher levels than the root of the plant and that they respond to chitosan (CHIT) elicitation with a significant increase in xanthone production [5]. Xanthones are a wide and structurally diverse group of polyphenols produced by a restricted number of plants, fungi, lichens, and bacteria with multiple bioactivities [6]. In the present study, CHIT was administered to H. perforatum root cultures using three different elicitation protocols, and the increase in xanthone production was evaluated through HPLC. The best results (550 % xanthone increase) were obtained by subjecting the roots to a single elicitation with 200 mg l- 1 CHIT and maintaining the elicitor in the culture medium for 1 week.

40|$|This {{article is}} Part I {{of a set}} of papers {{addressing}} mixing in a highly stratified estuary. Measurements of interfacial turbulence were made in Columbia River estuary under conditions of moderate river flow and neap tides. A flux correlation method was used to determine buoyancy fluxes, and fits to theoretical velocity and temperature variance spectra were used to measure turbulent kinetic and potential energy dissipation rates. At the measurement site in the interior of the estuary, mixing {{along the top of the}} salt wedge is found to occur only on ebb, during periods when the internal Froude number is supercritical. The wedge cannot, therefore, be in a quasiequilibrium state, and vertical mixing plays a dominant role in its ebb retreat. The turbulent Froude number FrT, which represents the ratio of effects of shear and stratification on the mixing, was found to be close to FrTap 1 during mixing episodes. This suggests an interplay between shear and buoyancy effects that corresponds to a condition of maximum mixing efficiency Gamma. Gamma is measured using both direct calculations of the buoyancy and dissipation terms in the turbulent kinetic energy (TKE) balance (this estimate of Gamma is referred to as Gammad), and by estimating the buoyancy term B by its relationship <b>to</b> <b>chiT,</b> the dissipation of temperature variance (this estimate of Gamma is referred to as Gammad). Averages over several mixing events give Gamma 0 ap 0. 22 and Gammadap 0. 36. Sources of bias in these measurements result from (1) approximations to the full TKE and available potential energy (APE) balances, (2) empirical constants used in fits of measured spectra in inertial subranges, (3) frame motion, and (4) high-pass filtering. The sign of the biases suggest that 0. 22 3 ̆c Gamma 3 ̆c 0. 36. Flood-ebb asymmetry in mixing also results in a time dependent force balance (discussed further by Kay and Jay, 2003). This asymmetry is analyzed using a new method to determine profiles of the momentum balance during ebb mixing events...|$|E
40|$|Mycoparasitism of fungal plant {{pathogens}} by Trichoderma {{species is}} a complex process that involves the production and coordinated secretion of cell-wall degrading enzymes. Genes implicated in mycoparasitism by Trichoderma atroviride contain motifs in the promoter region, designated MYRE 1 -MYRE 4, that are proposed to act as binding sites for a global inducer of the mycoparasitic response. The aim of our study was to establish whether these motifs also were present in Trichoderma hamatum and whether {{the presence of these}} motifs could predict co-expression when T. hamatum was confronted by a pathogen. Using a combination of targeted, degenerate and inverse PCR, homologues of the mycoparasitism-related genes ech 42 (chit 42), prb 1 and lam 1. 3 (xbg 1. 3 - 110), which encode an endochitinase, proteinase, and β- 1, 3 -glucanase, respectively, were cloned and sequenced from T. hamatum. Alignment of the promoter regions of the three genes revealed identical regions in the chit 42 and prb 1 promoters, which were 6 – 9 base pairs in length and conserved in position. Specifically, the regulator y motifs MYRE 1 -MYRE 4 were fully conserved, together with a fifth motif, identified by this research. A substrate assay designed to investigate the response of these genes from T. harzianum and T. hamatum to a simple carbon source (glycerol) showed that, in contrast <b>to</b> <b>chit</b> 42 and prb 1, xbg 1. 3 - 110 was not expressed. Further comparison of the expression patterns of these three genes between T. harzianum and T. hamatum using the glycerol substrate assay showed that no chit 42 or prb 1 expression could be detected in T. harzianum when it was grown under the same conditions as T. hamatum. This showed that the response of these genes to glycerol was species specific and that a single expression pattern for these genes was not common to all Trichoderma species. Confrontation assays were used to investigate the response of the three T. hamatum genes to the more complex substrate posed by the fungal pathogen Sclerotinia sclerotiorum. Once again gene expression analysis showed that both chit 42 and prb 1 were co-expressed and moderately induced during confrontation against Sclerotinia sclerotiorum. Although xbg 1. 3 - 110 previously had been implicated in mycoparasitism by T. harzianum, this study detected no xbg 1. 3 - 110 expression during confrontation between T. hamatum and S. sclerotiorum. These findings show that the MYRE 1 -MYRE 4 together with MYRE 5 are present in two species of Trichoderma, T. atroviride and T. hamatum and that the presence of these motifs could predict co-expression in response to two carbon sources...|$|E
