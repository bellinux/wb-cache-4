25|$|In the mid-1980s, {{controversy}} {{erupted in}} the cable programming world as United States media companies that owned pay television channels began scrambling their programming and charging fees to home satellite dish owners who accessed the same satellite signals <b>that</b> <b>cable</b> operators received. Many satellite dish owners faced {{the prospect of having}} to purchase descrambling equipment at a cost of hundreds of dollars, as well as having to pay monthly or annual subscription fees to cable programming providers. Fees for home dish owners were often higher than fees paid by cable subscribers, despite dish owners being responsible for acquiring and servicing their own equipment.|$|E

[...] Lovensheimer writes that Billis is more defined by class than by sexuality, evidenced by the Seabee's assumption, on learning <b>that</b> <b>Cable</b> went to college in New Jersey, that it was Rutgers (the state's flagship public university), rather than Ivy League Princeton, and by his delight on learning that the rescue operation for him had cost $600,000 when his uncle had {{told him he would}} never be worth a dime.|$|E

40|$|Transmission network {{development}} plans {{have led to}} protests throughout Germany. Many studies present underground cables {{as a means to}} increase public agreement to transmission line construction. This paper investigates this thesis reporting results of a Contingent Valuation study conducted in late 2012 in four regions of Germany, which are affected by transmission line development in different ways. In an analysis of 1. 003 household responses a majority of households favours underground cables (about 60 %). Willingness-to-pay, however, relativizes this result. Almost 50 % of households voting for underground cables are not willing to accept an increase in electricity prices to finance cable projects (free riders). The fact that positive willingness-to-pay does not correlate positively with increasing lengths of underground cables in 60 % of cases underlines <b>that</b> <b>cables</b> are not supported unconditionally. All-in-all, the thesis <b>that</b> <b>cables</b> increase acceptance of grid development has to be rejected based on the WTP-evaluation presented in this paper...|$|R

Under a $100,000-per-episode shared or second window syndication agreement <b>that</b> <b>cable</b> channel USA Network made with NBC, USA Network was allowed to broadcast episodes out of primetime a week after their premiere on NBC. The season is also under a regular off-network syndication deal at USA Networks and Bravo. The two channels teamed up late 2004 to pay $2 million per episode for the syndication rights to the series, allowing USA Network to air episodes during the week, and Bravo to air episodes at the weekend. In 2007, Fox Television Stations, a group of Fox Broadcasting Company owned-and-operated stations, entered a syndication deal to broadcast episodes {{as part of its}} daytime schedule. From late 2009, MyNetworkTV will broadcast Law & Order: Criminal Intent, including episodes from season one, having changed their business model from a network broadcaster to a syndication programming service.

500|$|At {{the heart}} of this scene is Cable's song [...] "You've Got to Be Carefully Taught", in which Cable realizes the sources of his own racism. [...] Its frank lyrics made it perhaps the most {{controversial}} element of the show. Michener recalled in his memoirs that a delegation of New Englanders had approached him after a New Haven tryout and urged him to recommend the song's removal to Rodgers and Hammerstein. [...] When Michener told Hammerstein, he laughed and replied, [...] "That's what the show is about!" [...] Boston drama critic Elliot Norton, after seeing the show in tryouts, strongly recommended its removal, or at least <b>that</b> <b>Cable</b> sing it less [...] "briskly", as there was much bigotry in Boston; Logan replied that that was all the more reason for leaving it unaltered. Several New York reviewers expressed discomfort with the song; Wolcott Gibbs wrote of [...] "something called 'You've Got to Be Taught', a poem in praise of tolerance that somehow I found a little embarrassing" [...] while John Mason Brown opined that he was [...] "somewhat distressed by the dragged-in didacticism of such a plea for tolerance as 'You've Got to Be Taught'". After the Broadway opening, Hammerstein received a large number of letters concerning [...] "You've Got to Be Carefully Taught". [...] Judging by the letters that remain among his papers in the Library of Congress, the reaction was mixed. One correspondent wrote [...] "What can I say to a man who writes, 'You've got to be taught to hate and fear?'... Now that I know you, I feel that my informants didn't praise you enough." [...] Nevertheless, another wrote, [...] "I feel the inclusion of the song particularly in the album and to some extent in the show itself is not helpful to the cause of brotherhood, your intent to the contrary notwithstanding".|$|E
