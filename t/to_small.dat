40|$|Aim : The {{purpose of}} this study was to examine acute muscle damage after {{different}} sequences of an upper-body resistance exercise session. Methods : Twelve untrained men completed two sessions (three sets; 80 % one repetition maximum; two min passive rest between sets) of the same exercises in opposite sequences (larger <b>to</b> <b>smaller</b> vs. <b>smaller</b> <b>to</b> larger muscle group exercises). For each session, serum creatine kinase (CK) concentrations were measured before exercise (pre) and 24, 48 hours after each sequence (24 P, 48 P). Results: Within sequence (larger <b>to</b> <b>smaller</b> muscle-group exercises), significant differences in CK concentrations were demonstrated between most time points (P 0. 05). Conclusion: These results suggest that muscle damage was similar between sequences (larger <b>to</b> <b>smaller</b> vs. <b>smaller</b> <b>to</b> larger muscle-group exercises) ...|$|R

5|$|A natural bobtail can {{be found}} in some members of the breed, which is not a {{mutation}} of the T-box gene, and so is allowed under conformation show rules. Health-related research on the breed has been limited, with no major studies conducted in Britain. However, it has been included in studies outside the UK, including by the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals (OFA) in the United States. The King Charles Spaniel has a number of eye and respiratory system disorders common to brachycephalic dogs, and endocrine and metabolic diseases common <b>to</b> <b>small</b> breeds, as well as specific breed-associated health conditions. The average lifespan is 10 to 12 years, and the breed should be able to reproduce naturally.|$|E

5|$|According to the report, {{the average}} annual {{transfers}} from the national government to the municipalities for {{water supply and sanitation}} (including solid waste) were about US$278m between 1998 and 2001. 86% of that funding was allocated through the SGP as defined in Law 715.

Nevertheless, many municipalities use funding through SGP dedicated for water supply and sanitation for other purposes.|$|E

5|$|As a mother, Lady Rosebery was {{presented}} with a dilemma: she was in fact already practically a mother to her husband who had no great feeling for a proximity <b>to</b> <b>small</b> babies. This was particularly evident in June 1880 when shortly {{after the birth of}} their first child Sybil, Rosebery wished to visit Germany for three months, to take a cure at a German spa (he was recovering from what is now thought to have been a nervous breakdown). His wife dutifully accompanied him. However, Rosebery, clearly aware of his wife's frustrated maternal instincts, reported that Hannah savoured every detail of the daily letters from London concerning the baby, and that she never complained at the forced separation.|$|E

5|$|As in all arthropods, the chelicerate {{body has}} a very small coelom {{restricted}} <b>to</b> <b>small</b> areas round the reproductive and excretory systems. The main body cavity is a hemocoel that runs most {{of the length of}} the body and through which blood flows, driven by a tubular heart that collects blood from the rear and pumps it forward. Although arteries direct the blood to specific parts of the body, they have open ends rather than joining directly to veins, and chelicerates therefore have open circulatory systems as is typical for arthropods.|$|E

There may have been additional unconfirmed tropical cyclones during the season.
