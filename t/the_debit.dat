5|$|The Puerto Rico Department of the Family {{currently}} {{provides the}} benefits to each participating family through a debit card, which replaced the physical cheques in the early 2000s. The monthly benefit is deposited through an electronic benefit transfer (EBT) system into a government-designated personal bank account, which can be accessed at any time with <b>the</b> <b>debit</b> card to withdraw cash or to make food purchases from authorized retailers. Since September 2001, 75% of each family’s monthly benefit has been designated exclusively for making direct food and grocery purchases, while the remaining 25% can be withdrawn as a cash benefit. The EBT debit card system has improved the program’s payment accuracy rate to 96.4% in 2003, 4 years ahead of its 2007 goal of 95% accuracy.|$|E

25|$|The {{influence}} of the European financial crisis, and continued latency in the Portuguese economy did not escape the election campaign. The unemployment rate in the Azores had grown to 15.6%, which was above the national rate (15.0%), and 5.9% greater than {{the same time in}} 2011. It was predicted that the unemployment rate would reach 16% by 2013. The region is heavily dependent on the public sector-driven economy, and the Government has not reduced, but actually hired more people to the Regional Secretaries (through public competition or through unemployment support programs). These activities have actually hidden the real increase in the unemployment rate, while measures to curtail the rise in public spending and implement austerity measures to reduce <b>the</b> <b>debit</b> did not occur.|$|E
25|$|At the {{beginning}} of the 13th century, when the Fourth Crusade and its aftermath temporarily disrupted Venice's relations with the Byzantine Empire, Genoa expanded its influence north of Imbros, into the Black Sea and Crimea. An extensive network of mercantile routes and associated ports promoted expansion of Byzantine culture, its goods and services - including scholars and craftsmen schooled in ancient Classical traditions - into Italy, France, Greece, Monaco, Russia, Tunisia, Turkey and Ukraine. The Renaissance's renewal of European culture was spawned in part by the rapid influx of exiles from Constantinople {{at the close of the}} 15th century. Not all the trade exchanges were as beneficial however: in <b>the</b> <b>debit</b> column can be recorded the 1347 European import of the plague via a Genoese trading post in the Black Sea. High mortality precipitated a weakening in the balance of maritime powers, leading to political strife with Venice and outright war. After a failing alliance with France against Barbary pirates, Genoa became a satellite of Spain; a native son and heir to its vital maritime tradition, Christopher Columbus, sponsored the discovery of the Americas in 1492.|$|E
2500|$|There {{are five}} {{fundamental}} elements within accounting. These elements are as follows: Assets, Liabilities, Equity (or Capital), Income (or Revenue) and Expenses. The five accounting elements are all affected {{in either a}} positive or negative way. A credit transaction does not always dictate a positive value or increase in a transaction and similarly, a debit does not always indicate a negative value or decrease in a transaction. An asset account {{is often referred to}} as a [...] "debit account" [...] due to the account's standard increasing attribute on <b>the</b> <b>debit</b> side. When an asset (e.g. an espresso machine) has been acquired in a business, the transaction will affect <b>the</b> <b>debit</b> side of that asset account illustrated below: ...|$|E

2500|$|The [...] "X" [...] in <b>the</b> <b>debit</b> column {{denotes the}} {{increasing}} {{effect of a}} transaction on the asset account balance (total debits less total credits), because a debit to an asset account is an increase. The asset account above {{has been added to}} by a debit value X, i.e. the balance has increased by £X or $X. Likewise, in the liability account below, the X in the credit column denotes the increasing effect on the liability account balance (total credits less total debits), because a credit to a liability account is an increase.|$|E

Target Financial Services also oversees GiftCard balances. Target launched its PIN-x debit card, the Target Check Card, which was later re-branded the Target Debit Card. The Target Debit Card withdraws funds from the customer's existing checking account, and allows for up to $40 [...] "cash back". <b>The</b> <b>debit</b> card allows guests to save five percent of each purchase.|$|E

2500|$|At {{the end of}} any {{financial}} period (say {{at the end of}} the quarter or the year), the total debits and the total credits for each account may be different and this difference of the two sides is called the balance.

2500|$|In {{addition}} to his translation projects, Convorbiri Literare hosted his original works, beginning with the autobiographical piece [...] "A Marquise's Pastel" [...] (September 1868). In January 1871, still independent of party politics, the journal was reorganized as a cultural monthly. Pogor {{was assigned to the}} editorial committee, a triumvirate also grouping Maiorescu and Negruzzi. He and Maiorescu resigned soon after, alleging that Negruzzi had failed to consult them about the editorial policy, possibly because of a polemical review inserted by Ștefan Vârgolici. This did not imply that they would cease to write for Convorbiri. Also that year, the magazine published a poem by Pogor's deceased father, newly discovered in the family archive. In October, when Junimea finally liquidated its publishing venture, Pogor was asked {{to take care of the}} debts and return <b>the</b> <b>debit.</b> Without Negruzzi's knowledge, the enterprise was purchased by the Jewish businessman Herșcu Goldner.|$|E
2500|$|On <b>the</b> <b>debit</b> side, {{political}} {{democracy in the}} Western sense {{was more or less}} nonexistent. [...] Even before Tunisia became a one-party state, it adopted a constitution vesting almost dictatorial powers in the presidency. [...] Civil liberties were subject to [...] "the limits prescribed by law," [...] per the constitution. [...] The media were expected to practice self-censorship, and opponents were frequently imprisoned. [...] Bourguiba became the focus of a personality cult in which he was extolled as the [...] "Supreme Warrior" [...] of the nation. [...] In 1975, Bourguiba was proclaimed president for life, though his health was increasingly poor. [...] Although he was prevailed upon to legalize opposition parties in 1981, Tunisia remained {{for all intents and purposes}} a one-party state. [...] The Destourian Socialist Party, in alliance with the trade unions, swept all of the seats in parliament. [...] The opposition was disgusted; it boycotted the next elections, in 1986.|$|E

50|$|This {{approach}} is {{also called the}} American approach. Under this approach transactions are recorded based on the accounting equation, i.e., Assets = Liabilities + Capital. The accounting equation is a statement of equality between <b>the</b> <b>debits</b> and <b>the</b> credits. <b>The</b> rules of <b>debit</b> and credit depend {{on the nature of}} an account. For the purpose of the accounting equation approach, all the accounts are classified into the following five types: assets, liabilities, income/revenues, expenses, or capital gains/losses.|$|R
2500|$|Transport for London [...] started {{accepting}} contactless debit {{and credit}} cards on London Buses on 13 December 2012, {{with the aim of}} expanding the new system to other transport modes by 2013. [...] Transport for London further expanded the use of contactless cards to the Underground, Tram and the Docklands Railway from September 2014. [...] It is reported that TfL's long-term aim is to stop handling money and collecting fares altogether. [...] The same requirement to touch in and out on underground services applies to contactless cards. [...] The same price capping that applies to the use of Oyster cards applies to the use of contactless cards (provided the same card is used for the day's journeys). [...] The fare paid every day is settled with the bank and appears on <b>the</b> <b>debit</b> or credit card statement. Detailed usage data is written to Transport for London's systems and is available for customers who register their contactless cards with Transport for London. Unlike an Oyster card, a contactless card does not store credit (beyond the holder's credit limit) and there is no need or facility to add credit to the card.|$|E
