If he does perform <b>the</b> <b>prayer,</b> he will be pardoned.

5|$|During {{their stay}} in mosques, these jamaats conduct a daily gasht, which {{involves}} visiting local neighbourhoods, preferably {{with the help}} of a guide. They invite people to attend the Maghrib prayer at their mosque and those who attend are delivered a sermon after <b>the</b> <b>prayers,</b> which essentially outlines the Six Principles. They urge the attendees to spend time in tabligh for self reformation and the propagation of Islam. Also the regular activities like eating, sleeping etc. are also carried out in the mosques.|$|E
5|$|Kinberg's wife Alice was {{a strong}} feminist, and during the 1980s {{he and his wife}} {{supported}} a number of changes to the liturgy and ritual. These included allowing women to read from the Torah and lead <b>the</b> <b>prayers,</b> and changing prayers to be more gender inclusive - for example, using gender-neutral terms and pronouns for God, and adding references to the Biblical matriarchs in prayers like the Amidah, which traditionally only mentioned the Biblical patriarchs. While most congregation members approved of these changes, a minority resisted them.|$|E
5|$|On the {{occasion}} of the 2nd Islamic Summit held at Lahore on 22 February 1974, thirty-nine heads of Muslim states offered their Friday prayers in the Badshahi Mosque, including, among others, Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto of Pakistan, Faisal of Saudi Arabia, Muammar Gaddafi, Yasser Arafat, and Sabah III Al-Salim Al-Sabah of Kuwait. <b>The</b> <b>prayers</b> were led by Mawlānā Abdul Qadir Azad, the then khatib of the mosque.|$|E

5|$|According to Hardorff, {{the theory}} is {{discounted}} by most academics. He suggests that Marquis may have made errors due {{to the use of}} sign language, which, he claims, cannot convey the nuances of language. In his book, Wooden Leg unambiguously relates a tale of mass suicide. He discusses possible causes of the suicides at length. It puzzled him because the idea of suicide to avoid capture was unknown to the Indians. Attributing the soldier's suicides to the effects of whisky was a common theory among the Indians, although Wooden Leg believed <b>the</b> <b>prayers</b> of medicine men to have been the cause. Wooden Leg's only taste of whisky up to the time of the battle had been a mouthful– which he immediately spat out– that he took from a captured bottle. In later life, Wooden Leg changed his mind and subscribed to the whisky theory after experiencing the effects of alcohol first-hand.|$|E
5|$|During the Sun Dance, {{which is}} practiced by many Plains Indian tribes, the eagle is {{represented}} in several ways. The eagle nest {{is represented by the}} fork of the lodge where the dance is held. A whistle made from the wing bone of an eagle is used {{during the course of the}} dance. Also during the dance, a medicine man may direct his fan, which is made of eagle feathers, to people who seek to be healed. The medicine man touches the fan to the center pole and then to the patient, in order to transmit power from the pole to the patient. The fan is then held up toward the sky, so that the eagle may carry <b>the</b> <b>prayers</b> for the sick to the Creator.|$|E
5000|$|Meninger {{began to}} offer {{instruction}} on <b>The</b> <b>Prayer</b> of <b>the</b> Cloud to priests {{who came to}} the monastery for retreats. <b>The</b> <b>prayer</b> was well received and, as word got out, more people wanted to learn <b>the</b> <b>prayer,</b> so Fr. Keating began to offer workshops to the lay community in Spencer. Another monk at the abbey, Basil Pennington, also began to teach <b>The</b> <b>Prayer</b> of <b>the</b> Cloud to priests and sisters at retreats away from St. Joseph's. At one retreat, someone suggested that the name of <b>the</b> <b>prayer</b> be changed to Centering Prayer, alluding to Thomas Merton's description of contemplative prayer as prayer that is [...] "centered entirely on the presence of God...His will...His love...and Faith by which alone we can know the presence of God." [...] From then on, <b>the</b> <b>prayer</b> was called Centering Prayer.|$|R

5|$|Each {{of these}} priests, either as secular clergy, or as previously, {{members of a}} {{religious}} order, is obligated to say the “Holy Office” every day. To this end, cathedrals normally {{have a number of}} small chapels used for private devotion or for small groups. In England there is a strong tradition that each chapel should face the east. For this reason the transepts of English cathedrals are longer than those in most other countries, and there is often a second transept, as at Salisbury. This arrangement permits a greater number of eastward-facing chapels. That part of the main interior which is furthest to the east and reserved for <b>the</b> <b>prayers</b> of the clergy is the presbytery.|$|E
5|$|Gordianus {{had been}} Roman emperor {{for six years}} when Philip, with his son Philip, succeeded him. It is {{reported}} that he, being a Christian, desired, {{on the day of}} the last paschal vigil, to share with the multitude in <b>the</b> <b>prayers</b> of the Church, but that he was not permitted to enter, by him who then presided, until he had made confession and had numbered himself among those who were reckoned as transgressors and who occupied the place of penance. For if he had not done this, he would never have been received by him, on account of the many crimes which he had committed. It is said that he obeyed readily, manifesting in his conduct a genuine and pious fear of God.|$|E
5|$|It has {{intricate}} carvings, with inscriptions in Quranic script. The mosque, in a walled enclosure, {{is made of}} interlocking coral blocks {{with its}} hypostyle roof supported by cut-coral columns. With three entrances, the mosque has two prayer halls surrounded by antechambers on three sides. Its vaulted, decorated ceiling is indented in steps. Local master carpenters, known as maavadikaleyge, fashioned the mosque's woodwork, roof and interior, and its wall panels and ceilings have many culturally-significant examples of traditional Maldivian woodcarving and lacquerwork. The mihrab, with a mimbar (pulpit) at one end, is a large chamber. The main building, used for daily prayers, {{is divided into three}} sections: the mihtab (used by the imam to lead <b>the</b> <b>prayers),</b> the medhu miskiy (the mosque's central area) and the fahu miskiy (the rear of the mosque). A long, carved 13th-century panel memorializes the introduction of Islam to Maldives.|$|E

50|$|Beloved God <b>Prayer</b> is <b>the</b> name of {{a prayer}} {{composed}} by Meher Baba on August 25, 1959. <b>The</b> <b>prayer</b> {{is one of three}} frequently recited at some gatherings of Baba followers as well as some individuals, along with <b>the</b> <b>Prayer</b> of Repentance and <b>the</b> Parvardigar <b>Prayer.</b> <b>The</b> three <b>prayers</b> are repeated morning and evening at Meher Baba's samadhi in Ahmednagar, India.|$|R
5|$|Living a worldly {{life during}} the day, he {{reportedly}} spent his evenings in vigils and prayer, putting into practice {{the writings of}} two authors—Marcus Eremita and Diadochos of Photiki—that were {{given to him by}} his spiritual father. It was during this time that Symeon had his first experience of God as divine light, as he described later in one of his Discourses (Disc. 22.2–4). He attributed the experience to <b>the</b> <b>prayers</b> of Symeon the Studite. In spite of the experience, the young Symeon confessed that he still fell into worldly ways of living. Direct personal experience of God was to become one of Symeon's central teachings in his writings, and to the monks who followed him.|$|E
5|$|Commemorations are for {{individuals}} or events {{which have been}} noteworthy {{in the life of}} the Church and in the history of Lutheranism in particular. These days do not take precedence over any other festival day, and if there is a conflict between a commemoration and a festival of any other rank, the commemoration is generally transferred to the next open weekday. If a commemoration falls on a Sunday where the color of the day is green, the collect for which that individual or event belong to could be said before the daily collect/prayer of the day or in place of it. For example, if September 13 fell on a Sunday and there was a desire to commemorate St. John Chrysostom, the pastor would recite the common of theologians and then the prayer of the day or the common of theologians on its own. The person may also be mentioned by name in <b>the</b> <b>prayers</b> of the faithful in addition to recitation of the applicable collect. Finally, their lives might be summarized or their teachings related to the day's lessons in some way.|$|E
5|$|The party {{continues}} {{to travel to}} the Scaraba desert, the Deep Darkness swamp and a forgotten underworld where dinosaurs live. When the Sound Stone is eventually filled, Ness visits Magicant, a surreal location in his mind where he fights his personal dark side. Upon returning to Eagleland, Ness and his party use the Phase Distorter to travel back in time to fight Giygas, transferring their souls into robots. The group discovers a device that contains the alien, but it is being guarded by Pokey, who is revealed to have been helping Giygas all along. After defeating him in a fight, Pokey turns the device off, releasing Giygas and forcing the group to fight the monster. During the fight, Paula reaches out to the inhabitants of Earth, who pray for the children's safety. <b>The</b> <b>prayers</b> manage to exploit Giygas' fatal weakness — human emotions — and defeat the alien, eradicating him from all of existence. In a post-credits scene, Ness, whose life has returned to normal following Giygas' defeat, receives a note from Pokey, who challenges Ness to come and find him.|$|E

5|$|James {{asserted}} {{his authority}} not only over the nobility but also upon the Church and lamented that King David I's benevolence towards the Church proved costly to his successors {{and that he}} was 'a sair sanct to the croun'. James also considered that the monastic institutions in particular needed improvement and that they should return to being strictly ordered communities. Part of James's solution was to create an assembly of overseeing abbots and followed this up by establishing a Carthusian priory at Perth to provide other religious houses with an example of internal conduct. He also sought to influence Church attitudes to his policies by having his own clerics appointed to the bishoprics of Dunblane, Dunkeld, Glasgow and Moray. In March 1425, James's parliament directed that all bishops must instruct their clerics to offer up prayers for the king and his family; a year later, parliament toughened up this edict insisting that <b>the</b> <b>prayers</b> be given at every mass under sanction of a fine and severe rebuke. This same parliament legislated that every person in Scotland should 'be governed under the king's laws and statutes of this realm only'. From this, laws were enacted in 1426 to restrict the actions of prelates whether it was to regulate their need to travel to the Roman Curia or their ability to purchase additional ecclesiastical positions while there. In James's parliament of July 1427, it is evident that statute being enacted had the purpose of reducing the powers of the church jurisdiction.|$|E
25|$|By {{the second}} and third centuries, such Church Fathers as Clement of Alexandria, Origen, and Tertullian wrote of the {{practice}} of Morning and Evening Prayer, and of <b>the</b> <b>prayers</b> at the third, sixth and ninth hours. <b>The</b> <b>prayers</b> could be prayed individually or in groups.|$|E
25|$|A {{distinction}} must be {{made between}} <b>the</b> <b>prayers</b> of the Roman Canon itself and {{the order in which}} they are now found. <b>The</b> <b>prayers,</b> or at least some of them, {{can be traced back to}} a very early date from occasional references in letters of the Church Fathers: <b>the</b> <b>prayers</b> beginning Te igitur, Memento Domine and Quam oblationem were already in use, even if not with quite the same wording as now, by the year 400; the Communicantes, the Hanc igitur, and the post-consecration Memento etiam and Nobis quoque were added in the 5th century.|$|E
