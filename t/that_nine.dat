5|$|No primary {{airports}} {{had been}} built in Helgeland by the mid-1960s. The coastal parts of the region, such as at Brønnøysund, were without highways and railways. Although Widerøe operated a seaplane route, it remained a summer-only service. Travel time to Sandnessjøen, where the closest hospital was located, took five hours. A committee, led by Erik Himle and later Preben Munthe, was appointed in 1962 to consider additional airports in Norway. The Sud Aviation Caravelle jet aircraft {{was about to be}} phased into use on the main domestic routes by Scandinavian Airlines System and the committee recommended in 1964 <b>that</b> <b>nine</b> new airports be built which could serve jetliners, including an airport in Sandnesssjøen.|$|E

Although several later exchanges were made, the lack of progress saw the British Government inform the Australian Prime Minister on 14 November 1944 that no further communications would be made on the loss of Centaur.|$|E

5|$|The Alexandrian texts were {{incorporated}} {{into the body of}} classical Greek literature that was preserved, catalogued and studied by scholars of the Hellenistic period.

In the end, sixty-one orations attributed to Demosthenes survived till the present day (some however are pseudonymous). Friedrich Blass, a German classical scholar, believes <b>that</b> <b>nine</b> more speeches were recorded by the orator, but they are not extant. Modern editions of these speeches are based on four manuscripts of the tenth and eleventh centuriesAD.|$|E

The Year Zero alternate reality game expanded upon the album's fictional storyline by using media such as websites, pre-recorded phone messages, and murals. However, disputes arose between Reznor and Universal Music Group, the parent company of Interscope Records, over overseas pricing of the album. In October 2007, Reznor announced <b>that</b> <b>Nine</b> Inch Nails had fulfilled its contractual commitments to Interscope, effectively ending the band's relationship with the label; thus Year Zero was the last Nine Inch Nails studio album released on the Interscope label.|$|E

5|$|A committee, led by Erik Himle {{and later}} Preben Munthe, was {{appointed}} in 1962 to consider additional airports in Norway. The Sud Aviation Caravelle {{was about to}} the phased into use on the main domestic routes and the committee recommended in 1964 <b>that</b> <b>nine</b> new airports be built which could serve jetliners, including one airport in Florø. Widerøe came with an alternative proposal and suggested that a network of smaller airports be built instead, which could be served using short take-off and landing aircraft, which were being developed at the time. Smaller airports could be built and operated at lower cost than larger airports, but both airports and airlines would need subsidies to operate. Håkon Kyllingmark was appointed Minister of Transport and Communications in 1965 and was a proponent of the STOLport proposal. The political rationale was that, despite that the total operating costs would rise, it would provide better services to rural areas and thus keep up their population.|$|E
5|$|In 2012, a study {{conducted}} by , UC Davis, US Forest Service, and the Hoopa Tribe showed that fishers in California were exposed to and killed by anticoagulant rodenticides associated with marijuana cultivation. In this study, 79% of fishers that were tested in California were exposed to an average of 1.61 different anticoagulant rodenticides and four fishers died directly attributed to these toxicants. A 2015 follow-up study building on this data determined that the trend of exposure and mortality from these toxicants increased to 85%, that California fishers were now exposed to an average of 1.73 different anticoagulant rodenticides, and <b>that</b> <b>nine</b> more fishers died, bringing the total to 13. The extent of marijuana cultivation within fishers' home ranges was highlighted in a 2013 study focusing on fisher survival and impacts from marijuana cultivation within the Sierra National Forest. Research showed that fishers had an average of 5.3 individual grow sites within their home range. One fisher had 16 individual grow sites within its territory.|$|E
