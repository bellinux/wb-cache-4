5|$|At {{the start}} of the 13th century, the Kingdom of England formed part of the Angevin empire {{spreading}} across Western Europe. Henry was named after his grandfather, Henry II, who had built up <b>this</b> <b>vast</b> network of lands stretching from Scotland and Wales, through England, across the English Channel to the territories of Normandy, Brittany, Maine and Anjou in north-west France, onto Poitou and Gascony in the south-west. For many years the French Crown was relatively weak, enabling first Henry II, and then his sons Richard and John, to dominate France.|$|E
5|$|The Cumans, a Turkic tribe {{approached}} the Danube Delta shortly after 1064–1065, and from 1068 {{the entire territory}} between the Aral Sea and the lower Danube were controlled by them. But <b>this</b> <b>vast</b> territory was never politically united by a strong central power. The different Cuman groups were under independent rulers or khans who meddled in the political life of the surrounding areas, such as the Rus’ principalities and the Byzantine Empire. In attacking the Byzantine Empire, the Cumans were also assisted by the Vlachs living in the Balkan Mountains (now in Bulgaria) who showed them the mountain paths where no imperial guard was set up.|$|E

25|$|Much of 19th-century geology {{revolved}} around {{the question of the}} Earth's exact age. Estimates varied from a few hundred thousand to billions of years. By the early 20th century, radiometric dating allowed the Earth's age to be estimated at two billion years. The awareness of <b>this</b> <b>vast</b> amount of time opened the door to new theories about the processes that shaped the planet.|$|E
25|$|In 1882, Pyotr Tchaikovsky {{edited the}} liturgical works of Bortniansky, which were {{published}} in ten volumes. While Bortniansky wrote operas and instrumental compositions, it is his sacred choral works that are performed most often today. <b>This</b> <b>vast</b> body of work remains central not only to understanding 18th-century Orthodox sacred music, but also served as inspiration to his fellow Ukrainian composers in the 19th century.|$|E

25|$|By World War II, Fort Monroe {{served as}} {{headquarters}} for {{an array of}} coast artillery guns ranging from 3-inch rapid fire guns to 16-inch guns capable of firing a 2,000 pound projectile 25 miles.

25|$|The {{greater part}} of what is the {{territory}} of today's Brazil had been claimed as Spanish when exploration began with the navigation of the length of the Amazon River in 1541–42 by Francisco de Orellana. Many Spanish expeditions explored large parts of <b>this</b> <b>vast</b> region, especially those close to Spanish settlements. During the 16th and 17th centuries, Spanish soldiers, missionaries and adventurers also established pioneering communities, primarily in Paraná, Santa Catarina, and São Paulo, and forts on the northeastern coast threatened by the French and Dutch.|$|E

25|$|The {{climate of}} <b>this</b> <b>vast</b> region varies {{considerably}} from area to area from tropical monsoon {{in the south}} to temperate in the north. The variety is influenced by not only the altitude, but also by factors such as proximity to the sea coast and the seasonal impact of the monsoons. Southern parts are mostly hot in summers and receive rain during monsoon periods. The northern belt of Indo-Gangetic plains also is hot in summer, but cooler in winter. The mountainous north is colder and receives snowfall at higher altitudes of Himalayan ranges.|$|E
25|$|In the mid-1930s, Moses {{oversaw the}} {{conversion}} of a vast Queens tidal marsh garbage dump into the fairgrounds that hosted the 1939/1940 World's Fair. Called Flushing Meadows Park, it was Moses' grandest park scheme. He envisioned <b>this</b> <b>vast</b> park, comprising some 1,300acres(5km2) of land, easily accessible from Manhattan, as a major recreational playground for New Yorkers. When the 1939/1940 World's Fair ended in financial failure, Moses {{did not have the}} available funds to complete work on his project. He saw the 1964/1965 Fair as a means to finish what the earlier fair had begun.|$|E
25|$|The {{subsequent}} {{balance of}} power was short-lived, though. In the 550s BC the Persians revolted against the Medes and gained control of their empire, {{and over the next}} few decades annexed to it the realms of Lydia in Anatolia, Damascus, Babylonia, and Egypt, as well as consolidating their control over the Iranian plateau nearly as far as India. <b>This</b> <b>vast</b> kingdom was divided up into various satrapies and governed roughly according to the Assyrian model, but with a far lighter hand. Around this time Zoroastrianism became the predominant religion in Persia.|$|E
50|$|Little {{non-agricultural}} development {{occurred during}} these years outside Beit Eshel. While Gvulot and Revivim each had over 100 members, only a few actually lived on the sites—12-14 in Gvulot and about 25 in Revivim.

To the west of <b>this</b> <b>vast</b> area was Belmont's Francis I Renaissance-style Grand Hall and foyer which exited onto Ledge Road. The monumental Gothic rooms with their huge stained-glass windows were emblazoned with the Belmont coat of arms. The room's original damask, blood red in colour, has long since been replaced with the same fabric in gold.|$|E
25|$|The cannonade and {{bombardment}} commenced at 14:30, {{and continued}} without intermission till sunset. The attack was renewed on the following, and on every succeeding day until the 9th, {{when it was}} resolved at a council of war, for sufficient reasons, to return immediately to Spain. In the course of these attacks 3732 mortar shells and 3833 rounds of shot were discharged by the Spaniards, and the Algerines returned 399 mortar shells and 11,284 rounds of shot. <b>This</b> <b>vast</b> expenditure of ammunition produced no corresponding effect on either side: the town was repeatedly set on fire, but the flames were soon subdued.|$|E
25|$|The {{climate in}} Mar del Plata {{and along the}} coast of Buenos Aires Province display the same {{temperature}} range as Bordeaux with similar (high) precipitation. Further inland, summers gain a few degrees while winter nights become somewhat colder in the flat southern Pampas. Adding to the variety of climates and soils in the area, there are low mountain areas (generally below 1,000 metres or 3,000ft.), valleys and rivers. Major wineries (like Trapiche) have made investments in the area and production is likely to increase significantly, but most of the potential in <b>this</b> <b>vast</b> area is untapped.|$|E

5000|$|In a {{collection}} of essays published after his death entitled God the Known and God the Unknown, Samuel Butler argued for the existence of a single, corporeal God and argued that belief in an incorporeal deity was essentially the same thing as atheism.

He later changed his views and decided that God was composed not only of all living things but all nonliving things as well. He argued, however, that [...] "...some vaster Person may loom... out behind our God, and... stand in relation to him as he to us. And behind <b>this</b> <b>vaster</b> and more unknown God there may be yet another, and another, and another." ...|$|R
