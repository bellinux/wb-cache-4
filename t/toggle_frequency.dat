40|$|Furst, Eric M. Directed {{self-assembly}} is {{a promising}} route to nanomanufacture materials with advanced phononic, photonic, mechanical and/or catalytic properties. In directed self- assembly, colloidal matter (proteins, polymers, nanoparticles, etc.) spontaneously form ordered structures either directly through typical colloidal forces and/or indirectly via an external field, {{such as a}} macroscopic flow or electromagnetic field. The external field modifies the interactions between constituent particles, {{making it possible to}} cre- ate structures and phases that are otherwise unobtainable {{in the absence of the}} field. If the pairwise interaction potential is too strong or applied too quickly, kinetic bot- tlenecks can halt the structural transitions in glassy, non-equilbrium states. In this thesis, we demonstrate the ability to circumvent arrested states by using suspensions of superparamagentic particles exposed to toggled magnetic fields, i. e. potentials that are cycled on and off at a fixed frequency and duty cycle. In the presence of a magnetic field, the suspension forms a percolated network, which is a kinetically arrested state. In a toggled magnetic field, the network coarsens and detaches from the edges of the sample cell and self-assembles into 250 mm sized domains, which is the predicted structure when the energetics of the suspension are minimized. We identify the optimal <b>toggle</b> <b>frequency</b> = 0. 66 Hz, for self-assembling aggregates in the minimum amount of time, on the order of 500 seconds. Deviations to higher or lower frequencies cause the self-assembly time to increase exponentially. Even though the network is composed of solid magnetic particles, it deforms like a fluid over time scales much longer than the <b>toggle</b> <b>frequency.</b> Modulating the <b>toggle</b> <b>frequency</b> changes the effective viscosity of the network from a viscous, Newtonian fluid for frequency = 0. 66 - 1. 5 Hz to a Bingham fluid for frequency greater than 2 Hz. The deformation of the network proceeds via a Rayleigh-Plateau instability that has a characteristic wavelength. We show that it is possible to suppress the instability and control the size and spacing of the domains by confining the suspension on length scales commensurate with the instability wavelength. In addition to characterizing the deformation and evolution of the percolated network, we also study the microstructure using optical microscopy and small-angle light scattering. For the suspension to evolve into its thermodynamically predicted state, a body-centered tetragonal crystal, it is necessary to properly balance the time scale of the <b>toggle</b> <b>frequency</b> and particle relaxation during the field-off half-period of the toggle cycle. If this balance is not met, the structure remains pinned in a non- equilibrium state. The results of this thesis broaden the pathways for self-assembling thermody- namically predicted structures. Directed self-assembly with toggled fields modulate particle-particle interactions via an external field instead of fine-tuning the interactions, which often lead to kinetically arrested states. Overall, the toggled field approach pro- vides an exciting opportunity to tailor the properties of advanced materials by building ordered structures.

40|$|ABSTRACT — Advanced {{circuits}} {{based on}} metamorphic HEMT (MHEMT) technologies on 4 ” GaAs substrates for both millimeter-wave, and mixed-signal applications are presented. Extrinsic cut-off frequencies of ft = 293 GHz and fmax = 337 GHz were achieved for a 70 nm gate length metamorphic HEMT technology. The MMIC process obtains high yield on transistor and circuit level. Single-stage low-noise amplifiers demonstrate a small signal gain of 13 dB and a noise figure of 2. 8 dB at 94 GHz. An amplifier MMIC developed for D-Band operation features {{a gain of}} 15 dB at 160 GHz. The achieved results are comparable to state-of-the-art InP-based HEMT technologies. In order to realize 80 Gbit/s digital circuits, a process with 100 nm gate length enhancement type HEMTs with a transit frequency of 200 GHz is used. Three metalization layers are available for interconnects. The parasitic capacitance of the interconnects is kept low by using BCB and plated air bridge technology.

40|$|AbstractVitesse has {{received}} a $ 6 m DARPA contract to develop InP ICs for military communications, in collaboration with BAE Systems and the University of Illinois Urbana Champaign (UIUC). It will develop advanced manufacturing processes and communication ICs using its sub-micron VIP- 2 InP HBT technology. The initial 18 -month contract contains option phases, which, if implemented, would bring {{the total value of}} the contract to more than $ 15 m. The contract allows Vitesse to enhance the capabilities of its VIP- 2 process, selected for its ability to enhance speed, power, performance, circuit reliability and production-worthy manufacturing practices required for the DARPA specification. InP technology allows direct digital synthesis of high-frequency signals, simplifying the system design and reducing the number of discrete components required in advanced satellite, aircraft and terrestrial communication systems. Vitesse will collaborate with BAE Systems on the design of communications circuits; initially, these are for direct digital frequency synthesis (DDFS) for electronic warfare and radar applications. UIUC will focus on research for the next-generation transistor structures meant to further extend circuit performance and applications. A factor of two improvements in critical performance parameters has already been attained in early VIP- 2 experiments at 0. 45 μ. Further scaling is planned, incorporating UIUC’s findings, the ultimate goal to shrink device geometry to 0. 25 μ. This will result in static flip-flop <b>toggle</b> <b>frequencies</b> of 150 GHz.

40|$|Abstract. Over {{the life}} of a modern computer, the energy cost of running the system can exceed the cost of the {{original}} hardware purchase. This has driven the community to attempt to understand and minimize energy costs wherever possible. Towards these ends, we present an automated, fine-grained approach to selecting per-loop processor clock frequencies. The clock frequency selection criteria is established through a combination of lightweight static analysis and runtime tracing that automatically acquires application signatures- characterizations of the patterns of execution of each loop in an application. This application characterization is matched with a series of benchmark loops, which have been run on the target system and exercise it various ways. These benchmarks are intended to form a covering set, a machine characterization of the expected power consumption and performance traits of the machine over the space of execution patterns and clock frequencies. The frequency that confers the best power-delay product to the benchmark that most closely resembles each application loop is the one chosen for that loop. The application’s frequency management strategy is then permanently integrated into the compiled executable via static binary instrumentation. This process is lightweight, only has to be done once per application (and the benchmarks just once per machine), and thus is much less laborious than running every application loop at every possible frequency on the machine to see what the optimal frequencies would be. Unlike most frequency management schemes, we <b>toggle</b> <b>frequencies</b> very frequently, potentially at every loop entry and exit, saving as much as 10 % of the energy bill in the process. The set of tools that implement this scheme is fully automated, built on top of freely available open source software, and uses an inexpensive power measurement apparatus. We use these tools to show a measured, system-wide energy savings of up to 7. 6 % o...|$|R

Extrinsic cut-off frequencies of f(ind t) = 293 GHz and f(ind max) = 337 GHz were achieved for the 70 nm gate length depletion type MHEMT technology. The MMIC process features high yield on transistor and circuit levels. Single-stage low-noise amplifiers demonstrate a small signal gain of 12 dB and a noise figure of 2. 2 dB at 94 GHz. An amplifier MMIC developed for D-band operation exhibits a gain of 15 dB from 155 to 160 GHz. The achieved results are equivalent to state-of-the-art InP-based HEMT technologies.

40|$|Power {{density in}} {{high-performance}} processors {{continues to increase}} with technology generations as scaling of current, clock speed, and device density outpaces the downscaling of supply voltage and thermal ability of packages to dissipate heat. Power density is characterized by localized chip hot spots that can reach critical temperatures and cause failure. Previous architectural approaches to power density have used global clock gating, fetch <b>toggling,</b> dynamic <b>frequency</b> scaling, or resource duplication to either prevent heating or relieve overheated resources in a superscalar processor. Previous approaches also evaluate design technologies where power density {{is not a major}} problem and most applications do not overheat the processor. Future processors, however, are likely to be chip multiprocessors (CMPs) with simultaneously-multithreaded (SMT) cores. SMT CMPs pose unique challenges and opportunities for power density. SMT and CMP increase throughput and thus on-chip heat, but also provide natural granularities for managing power-density. This paper is the first work to leverage SMT and CMP to address power density. We propose heat-and-run SMT thread assignment to increase processor-resource utilization before cooling becomes necessary by co-scheduling threads that use complementary resources. We propose heat-and-run CMP thread migration to migrate threads away from overheated cores and assign them to free SMT contexts on alternate cores, leveraging availability of SMT contexts on alternate CMP cores to maintain throughput while allowing overheated cores to cool. We show that our proposal has an average of 9 % and up to 34 % higher throughput than a previous superscalar technique running the same number of threads...|$|R
40|$|A {{new time}} series {{bootstrap}} scheme, the time <b>frequency</b> <b>toggle</b> (TFT) -bootstrap, is proposed. Its basic {{idea is to}} bootstrap the Fourier coefficients of the observed time series, and then to back-transform them to obtain a bootstrap sample in the time domain. Related previous proposals, such as the "surrogate data" approach, resampled only the phase of the Fourier coefficients and thus had only limited validity. By contrast, we show that the appropriate resampling of phase and magnitude, in addition to some smoothing of Fourier coefficients, yields a bootstrap scheme that mimics the correct second-order moment structure for a large class of time series processes. As a main result we obtain a functional limit theorem for the TFT-bootstrap {{under a variety of}} popular ways of frequency domain bootstrapping. Possible applications of the TFT-bootstrap naturally arise in change-point analysis and unit-root testing where statistics are frequently based on functionals of partial sums. Finally, a small simulation study explores the potential of the TFT-bootstrap for small samples showing that for the discussed tests in change-point analysis as well as unit-root testing, it yields better results than the corresponding asymptotic tests if measured by size and power.

40|$|Abstract: Design of a fast-locking {{phase-locked loop}} (PLL) {{is one of}} the major {{challenges}} in today’s wireless communications. A recently reported digitally controlled oscillator (DCO) -based all-digital PLL (ADPLL) can achieve an ultrashort settling time of 10 ms. This study describes a new DCO tuning word (OTW) presetting technique for the ADPLL to further reduce its settling time. Estimating the required OTW is the most crucial issue for presetting. Two methods are proposed here to estimate the required OTW. One method is using a foreground calibration block to eliminate the effect of DCO gain (KDCO) estimation error (1 K) and then directly calculating the required OTW for the process/voltage/temperature calibration (PVT-calibration) mode of the ADPLL. The other method is using a new counter-based mode switching controller (CB-MSC) to estimate the required OTW for the acquisition mode and tracking mode. This method is based on the ADPLL’s inherent characteristic of <b>frequency</b> <b>toggling</b> and is independent of loop parameters. Furthermore, our proposed presetting technique can be used with the dynamic loop bandwidth control technique together. The ADPLL with the proposed OTW estimating and presetting block is designed using very-high-speed integrated circuit hardware description language and simulated in ModelSim environment. Simulation results demonstrate that a minimum settling time of 2. 9 ms is achieved and the improvement is about 40 – 50 % on average compared with the ADPLL without our techniques. ...|$|R
