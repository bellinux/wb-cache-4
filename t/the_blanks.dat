40|$|Abstract. Machining {{experiments}} of fine-blanking {{with negative}} clearance show that <b>the</b> <b>blanking</b> force {{is very different}} from ordinary blanking in different blanking stages. Studying on <b>the</b> <b>blanking</b> force size of fine-blanking with negative clearance in different blanking stages is a very important significance for studying die wear and analyzing the state of material stress-strain. Firstly, numerical simulation and stress state analysis of the fine-blanking with negative clearance are carried out, with DEFORM-metal forming finite element analysis software. Afterward the relationship curve of blanking force and stroke are measured, and <b>the</b> <b>blanking</b> force with different blanking stages of fine-blanking with negative clearance is analyzed by the simulation and the experiment. The analysis result shows that <b>the</b> simulation <b>blanking</b> force is bigger than the experimental result (error about 15 %), but <b>the</b> <b>blanking</b> force variation tendency is accordant. while the punch pushes down within 0. 1 mm, <b>the</b> <b>blanking</b> force changes quickly. The metal sheet will enter into the state of plastic deformation after <b>the</b> <b>blanking</b> force reaching maximum value. Along with the punch continues to move down, the area of shear zone is decrescent so that <b>the</b> <b>blanking</b> force inches down, and <b>the</b> <b>blanking</b> force reaches a certain value in <b>the</b> place of <b>blanking</b> allowance value finally. With punch pushing the metal sheet to enter the plastic state and punch downward the place of the allowance value, the metal sheet sustained <b>the</b> big <b>blanking</b> force all <b>the</b> time as well as the deformation zone material keeps the plastic deformation. The research result provides theoretic reference and the experimental data for the practice application of fine-blanking with negative clearance, and has instructive significance and reference value to mould design...|$|R

40|$|Tailor-welded blanks made of dissimilar, uniform or {{non-uniform}} thickness {{materials have}} potential applications in automobile industries. Compared {{to the base}} metal, the formability of tailor-welded blank is less due {{to the presence of}} weld area and strength mismatch between component blanks. Most sheet metals used to produce tailor-welded blanks have anisotropy induced during pre-processing stage due to large deformation.

Bowie provided a number of matte paintings to enhance the scale of certain key shots in the film, including the crashed rocket, the Westminster Abbey set and the shot of Quatermass walking away from the Abbey at the climax of the movie. Partly because of the concerns raised by the BBFC and partly on account of the low budget, Val Guest kept the creature largely off-screen for much of the film, feeling that audiences' imaginations would fill in <b>the</b> <b>blanks</b> more effectively than he and the special effects team could deliver on-screen. For the climactic scenes at Westminster Abbey, however, Bowie created a monster from tripe and rubber and photographed it against a model of the Abbey.

Michael Carreras felt something was missing when he viewed the first cut of this scene: he said, [...] "There was this great glob of something hanging about on the scaffolding. And they had put in the best music they could and put the best effects on it, but it meant nothing as far as I was concerned… absolutely nothing at all". An eye was added to the model of the monster and a human scream added to the soundtrack to give the creature some semblance of humanity in its final moments.
