40|$|In the {{management}} of large enterprises, <b>quality</b> <b>control</b> has been implemented since it was successfully introduced to Japanese manufacturing following the Second World War. It began with the Ishikawa fshbone graphic which was a practical advance on the Porphery tree that captured the logic of Aristotelian ontology. The fshbone suited a strategic focus on a fnal objective, with a tributary hierarchy demarcated by goals and targets; {{it was like a}} logic River system that could be contrasted with contradictories, uncertainties and consistencies. Graphical representation of the totality of these contrasts takes the structure of a sphere. Spherical logic provides <b>total</b> fishbone <b>quality</b> <b>control</b> for the <b>quality</b> <b>control</b> of complex governance and administrative matters. In an age of globalisation, science and technology, lawmakers and administrators must upgrade their precision and effectiveness to manage an increasingly complex and dynamic real world. This is a practice-focused paper that poses and demonstrates improved frameworks, concepts and structures for operational effectiveness of government and administration. Now, optimal civilisation can be designed for sustainability with collective intelligence aids such as eGanges, which is a <b>total</b> fshbone <b>quality</b> <b>control</b> system. The capacity of eGanges accommodates information as large and as complex as required, and processes the inherent combinatorial options of pro tem possibilities as well as data retrieval of information about potential and expectations for change or adaptation, at its precise point of relevance. User-friendly eGanges applets can be accessed online by the public. A draft application of eGanges is used to illustrate <b>total</b> fshbone <b>quality</b> <b>control</b> in governance. The application shows the detail of requirements for <b>quality</b> <b>controlled</b> home insulation, to give effect to a recent government-funded home insulation scheme in Australia. The problems which arose from the scheme, common knowledge established by the media, namely installer deaths and home destruction by fire, indicated a lack of <b>quality</b> <b>control</b> in the formulation and implementation of the scheme. The scheme was to give effect to a policy of reducing the use of coal-produced domestic electricity. A sound legal ontology of home insulation was required for the scheme, to optimise its effectiveness, avoid negligence, risks, and unnecessary costs of exploitative entrepreneurs. 14 page(s...|$|R

The term quality circles was most accessibly defined by Professor Kaoru Ishikawa in his 1988 handbook, [...] "What is <b>Total</b> <b>Quality</b> <b>Control?</b> The Japanese Way" [...] and circulated throughout Japanese industry by the Union of Japanese Scientists and Engineers (JUSE) in 1960. The first company in Japan to introduce Quality Circles was the Nippon Wireless and Telegraph Company in 1962. By the end of that year there were 36 companies registered with JUSE by 1978 the movement had grown to an estimated 1 million Circles involving some 10 million Japanese workers. Contrary to some people's opinion this movement had nothing whatever to do with Dr. W.

He graduated from Tokyo Imperial University(currently, Tokyo University) in 1948. After graduating from Tokyo University, Ishikawa joined the Department of Transportation (currently Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport and Tourism) and became acquainted with Morinoske Kajima, forth president of Kajima Corporation. Morinoske Kajima noticed his potential early on and they became close. In 1955, Dr. Ishikawa joined Kajima as a director. Dr. Ishikawa was convinced that nuclear energy was required to satisfy future energy demands in Japan and created a department for nuclear energy in Kajima soon after joining. In addition, he led many successful construction projects such as Kasumigaseki Building, the first skyscraper in Japan. In 1978, he took office as the seventh president of Kajima and swiftly introduced TQC (<b>Total</b> <b>Quality</b> <b>Control)</b> and promoted positive reforms in the company. He became chairman of Kajima in 1984 and in 1986, was awarded by the Government of Japan with Medals of Honor (Japan) with Blue Ribbon (藍綬褒章).|$|E

If double (64 -bit) precision is not used throughout, it is customary to use the conservation of the <b>total</b> energy for <b>quality</b> <b>control</b> (e.g. Gaburov et al. [2009]). However, as shown in Appendix B, the relative energy error is {{much smaller than the}} typical relative force error, simply because it is an average over many force errors. Even worse, the computation of the total energy, required for measuring its error, typically incurs a larger error. Thus, any measured non-conservation of the total energy is dominated by measurement error rather than true non-conservation due to acceleration errors.|$|R
