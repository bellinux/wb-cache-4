5|$|In both paintings, Saint Francis of Assisi kneels by a rock as he {{receives}} the stigmata {{that were to}} stay on his body until his death. The composition is tonally similar to Giotto's 1295–1300 Saint Francis Receiving the Stigmata, but more grounded in earthly reality. <b>The</b> <b>design</b> <b>is</b> a mostly faithful representation of the original Franciscan texts, but differs in that Francis does not lean forward towards Christ.|$|E
5|$|In {{market and}} brand focused companies, design {{management}} focuses mainly on brand design management, including corporate brand management and product brand management. Focusing on the brand {{as the core}} for design decisions results in a strong focus on the brand experience, customer touch points, reliability, recognition, and trust relations. <b>The</b> <b>design</b> <b>is</b> driven by the brand vision and strategy.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> last <b>design</b> by model {{engineer}} Curly Lawrence ("LBSC") {{was for a}} {{live steam}} 3½ inch gauge model BR 9F Locomotive. <b>The</b> <b>design</b> <b>was</b> unfinished before his death on 4 November 1967. <b>The</b> <b>design</b> <b>was</b> subsequently completed by Martin Evans.|$|R
5000|$|Wind tunnel {{tests for}} <b>the</b> {{aircraft}} <b>design</b> have <b>been</b> completed. <b>The</b> <b>design</b> <b>was</b> noted to be [...] "workable and robust." ...|$|R
5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>design</b> {{specification}} <b>was</b> {{issued in}} 1930 and <b>the</b> <b>design</b> <b>was</b> approved in 1931. The project numbers (3, 53, 53-U or 58) were retroactively applied in 1939.|$|R
5|$|More {{recent works}} have {{improved}} {{sections of the}} highway in Perth. Great Eastern Highway's intersection with Roe Highway was upgraded to a grade separated interchange. <b>The</b> <b>design</b> <b>is</b> a diamond interchange, with free-flowing traffic on Roe Highway, and an additional looped ramp for northbound to eastbound traffic movements. Construction of the $101.5million project began in late 2010, and the interchange was officially opened to traffic on 9 June 2012.|$|E
5|$|The East Midwood Jewish Center building's {{architect}} is uncertain. <b>The</b> <b>design</b> <b>is</b> officially {{credited to}} the Building Committee and Irving Warshaw, the construction superintendent. The architect's {{name is not}} recorded in synagogue records, nor on the building's dedicatory plaque. The Center's National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) nomination form, however, argues that the architect was Louis Abramson, based on visual evidence and one piece of written evidence.|$|E
5|$|The team {{colors are}} burgundy, steel blue, black, silver and white. For the 2007–08 season, the NHL {{introduced}} the new-look Rbk EDGE jerseys. The Avalanche debuted their {{new version of}} the Rbk EDGE jerseys on September 12, 2007, at an Avalanche press conference. <b>The</b> <b>design</b> <b>is</b> similar to the previous jerseys, with some added piping.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>design</b> <b>was</b> {{selected}} by <b>the</b> Tokyo Metropolitan Symbol Selection Committee (東京都シンボルマーク選考委員会) from 20 candidates. <b>The</b> winning <b>design</b> <b>was</b> created by Rei Yoshimura (レイ吉村), a professional graphic designer.|$|R
50|$|In 1959, <b>the</b> <b>design</b> <b>was</b> modified, {{adding a}} hole in the center due to {{complaints}} that <b>the</b> <b>design</b> <b>was</b> confusing with <b>the</b> 100 yen coin, and changing the reverse side to show a chrysanthemum viewed from above. The metallurgy remained unchanged. This <b>design</b> <b>was</b> issued every year from 1959 to 1966.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>design</b> <b>was</b> {{originally}} {{conceived as}} an enlarged version of <b>the</b> s. <b>The</b> <b>design</b> <b>was</b> however changed radically with a CODOG machinery suite comprising gas turbines and diesels. These ships introduced {{the use of}} ship-based helicopters and variable depth sonar into the Italian Navy.|$|R
5|$|Two of the statues, both in Arkansas, are {{individually}} {{listed on}} the National Register of Historic Places; one in Helena and one in Fort Smith. Installed in cemeteries, town squares, and parks, outside museums, on courthouse lawns, and countless other places, <b>the</b> <b>design</b> <b>is</b> {{said to be the}} most-viewed example of outdoor statuary in the U.S. (after the Statue of Liberty) although many people do not even realize they have seen it.|$|E
5|$|A new wing {{was added}} in early 1980 to provide {{additional}} space for the arts, with a large room for orchestra and music and another for studio art. Filling in the previously open {{east side of the}} courtyard, <b>the</b> <b>design</b> <b>is</b> nearly identical in design to the original school, built of red and white-washed brick with a cloister on the courtyard side. The Gatehouse, which was built in 1929 and had served as the headmaster's residence, was remodeled to house the early childhood program in 1988.|$|E
5|$|During the {{construction}} of the James Bay transmission system, the cross-rope suspension tower was invented. This type of tower features two guyed-tower legs similar to the V-guyed tower, but the two legs don't converge at the tower base. In the case of the cross-rope suspension tower, the tower legs are spread apart on two different foundations. In addition, the crossbar is replaced by a series of suspension cables with three vertical insulator strings to support the three bundles, which allows this design to consume only 6.3 tonnes of steel per kilometre of line. <b>The</b> <b>design</b> <b>is</b> also known as the Chainette (little necklace).|$|E
50|$|The {{company went}} {{bankrupt}} before {{production of the}} Master <b>was</b> started and <b>the</b> <b>design</b> <b>was</b> later acquired by Blackshape of Monopoli, Italy and developed into the Blackshape Prime. <b>The</b> <b>design</b> <b>was</b> also developed into the Pelegrin Tarragon by Pelegrin Limited in conjunction with CFM Air.|$|R

5|$|In 1909, the City of Bridgeport {{created a}} special {{commission}} {{to oversee the}} construction of a bridge at Congress Street. A local engineer, Raymond F. Stoddard was hired as design consultant and obtained the license to use the Scherzer design. A Scherzer rolling-lift bridge with a double-leaf bascule was chosen for construction. <b>The</b> <b>design</b> <b>is</b> a Deck-type plate girder bridge; using two plate girders to support the deck. The Scherzer bascule was a popular design because it avoided the expense of high-stress pivot bearings; though it requires stronger foundations to support the weight of the bridge's operation. The engineering firm, J. R. Worcester and Company designed and constructed the concrete-arch approach and Fort Pitt Bridge Works fabricated the movable bridge. The cost of construction was $300,000, which was offset through funding from the Connecticut Company. A contemporary account from the Hartford Courant gave stated the contract was for $305,000 to Snare, Tristo and Company. The bridge was opened to the public July 16, 1910.|$|E
5|$|On June 22, 2015, {{the sixth}} {{anniversary of the}} accident, the Legacy Memorial Park {{in honor of the}} victims was opened; ground was broken exactly one year {{previously}} by Mayor Vincent C. Gray. The park features a memorial wall and nine inscribed sculptures, one in honor of each person killed in the crash. The sculptures were created by sculptor Barbara Liotta, and the memorial was designed by the firm of Hunt Laudi; <b>the</b> <b>design</b> <b>is</b> titled A Sacred Grove. Representatives of victims' families and city government officials attended the dedication, but Metro officials did not. The park is located at the entrance to Blair Memorial Gardens, which is close {{to the site of the}} collision.|$|E
5|$|The Isidore H. Heller House {{is a house}} {{located at}} 5132 South Woodlawn Avenue in the Hyde Park {{community}} area of Chicago in Cook County, Illinois, United States. The house was designed by American architect Frank Lloyd Wright. <b>The</b> <b>design</b> <b>is</b> credited {{as one of the}} turning points in Wright's shift to geometric, Prairie School architecture, which is defined by horizontal lines, flat or hipped roofs with broad overhanging eaves, windows grouped in horizontal bands, and an integration with the landscape, which is meant to evoke native Prairie surroundings.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>design</b> <b>was</b> {{based on}} Nissan Cima.|$|R
50|$|The Fano {{plane is}} a small {{symmetric}} block design, specifically a 2-(7,3,1)-design. The points of <b>the</b> <b>design</b> <b>are</b> <b>the</b> points of the plane, and the blocks of <b>the</b> <b>design</b> <b>are</b> <b>the</b> lines of the plane. As such it is a valuable example in (block) design theory.|$|R
25|$|Six large escort vessels {{based on}} a scaled-up version of <b>the</b> Bathurst <b>design</b> <b>were</b> {{considered}} for construction in mid-1941, but <b>the</b> <b>design</b> <b>was</b> determined to be inferior to the River-class frigate.|$|R
5|$|The comb-line filter {{is similar}} to the {{interdigital}} filter in that it lends itself to mechanical assembly in a metal case without dielectric support. In the case of the comb-line, all the lines are short-circuited at the same end rather than alternate ends. The other ends are terminated in capacitors to ground, and <b>the</b> <b>design</b> <b>is</b> consequently classified as semi-lumped. The chief advantage of this design is that the upper stopband can be made very wide, that is, free of spurious passbands at all frequencies of interest.|$|E
5|$|The {{majority}} of the guns were small iron guns with short range that could be aimed and fired by a single person. The two most common are the bases, breech-loading swivel guns, most likely placed in the castles, and hailshot pieces, small muzzle-loaders with rectangular bores and fin-like protrusions {{that were used to}} support the guns against the railing and allow the ship structure to take the force of the recoil. Though <b>the</b> <b>design</b> <b>is</b> unknown, there were two top pieces in a 1546 inventory (finished after the sinking) which was probably similar to a base, but placed in {{one or more of the}} fighting tops.|$|E
5|$|The menu at the Whopper Bar {{features}} {{as many as}} 10 variants on the Whopper, including the Western Whopper, the Texas Double Whopper and the Angry Whopper. Additionally, a customization section allows the customer to have a personalized Whopper made with ingredients such as jalapeño peppers, steak sauce or blue cheese. The open station differs from the company's usual kitchen model {{in that it is}} in plain sight of the customer instead of being located in the back-end of the store. The intent of <b>the</b> <b>design</b> <b>is</b> to add a sense of showmanship to the concept.|$|E
50|$|Discovery Offices {{construction}} began {{construction on}} 1 March 2011 and {{is estimated to}} complete on 1 March 2015. <b>The</b> <b>design</b> <b>was</b> changed two times before <b>the</b> final <b>design</b> <b>was</b> decided upon.|$|R
50|$|Six large escort vessels {{based on}} a scaled-up version of <b>the</b> Bathurst <b>design</b> <b>were</b> {{considered}} for construction in mid-1941, but <b>the</b> <b>design</b> <b>was</b> determined to be inferior to the River-class frigate.|$|R

5|$|The {{national}} flag of Singapore was adopted in 1959, the year Singapore became self-governing within the British Empire. It was reconfirmed as the {{national flag}} when the republic gained independence on 9 August 1965. Prior to its independence, {{it was the only}} state flag in Malaysia not to have a 1:2 ratio. <b>The</b> <b>design</b> <b>is</b> a horizontal bicolour of red above white, overlaid in the canton (upper-left quadrant) by a white crescent moon facing a pentagon of five small white five-pointed stars. The elements of the flag denote a young nation on the ascendant, universal brotherhood and equality, and national ideals.|$|E
5|$|Members are {{arranged}} in a hemicycle according to their political groups (in the Common Assembly, prior to 1958, members sat alphabetically) who are ordered mainly by left to right, but some smaller groups are placed towards the outer ring of the Parliament. All desks are equipped with microphones, headphones for translation and electronic voting equipment. The leaders of the groups sit on the front benches at the centre, and in the very centre is a podium for guest speakers. The remaining half of the circular chamber is primarily composed of the raised area where the President and staff sit. Further benches are provided between the sides of this area and the MEPs, these are {{taken up by the}} Council on the far left and the Commission on the far right. Both the Brussels and Strasbourg hemicycle roughly follow this layout with only minor differences. The hemicycle design is a compromise between the different Parliamentary systems. The British-based system has the different groups directly facing each other while the French-based system is a semicircle (and the traditional German system had all members in rows facing a rostrum for speeches). Although <b>the</b> <b>design</b> <b>is</b> mainly based on a semicircle, the opposite ends of the spectrum do still face each other. With access to the chamber limited, entrance is controlled by ushers who aid MEPs in the chamber (for example in delivering documents). The ushers can also occasionally act as a form of police in enforcing the President, for example in ejecting an MEP who is disrupting the session (although this is rare). The first head of protocol in the Parliament was French, so many of the duties in the Parliament are based on the French model first developed following the French Revolution. The 180 ushers are highly visible in the Parliament, dressed in black tails and wearing a silver chain, and are recruited {{in the same manner as}} the European civil service. The President is allocated a personal usher.|$|E
5|$|The {{remains of}} the priory church are {{dominated}} by the eastern gable wall of the presbytery that still stands to its full height. Its great east window is {{regarded as one of}} the finest examples of late-13th-century church architecture. <b>The</b> <b>design</b> <b>is</b> so close to that of the eastern arm of Ripon Cathedral, which was built around the same time, that it is thought to have been modelled on Ripon's design. The window's tracery has disappeared, as has its sill, but from the stubs and surviving fragments it can be deduced that it had seven major lights (the glazed openings in the window). At its centre was a great circle of tracery filled with trefoiled lights. The main gable of the east wall is flanked by massive buttresses capped with gables and octagonal pinnacles. A similar pair of pinnacles top the main gable, flanking a window of unusual design; a bracket projects from the lower lobe to support a statue (no longer present), possibly of the Virgin Mary, to whom the priory was dedicated.|$|E
50|$|Where {{a design}} forms {{part of a}} more complex product, the novelty and {{individual}} character of <b>the</b> <b>design</b> <b>are</b> judged on <b>the</b> part of <b>the</b> <b>design</b> which <b>is</b> visible during normal use.|$|R
2500|$|The Fano {{plane is}} a small {{symmetric}} block design, specifically a 2-(7,3,1)-design. [...] The points of <b>the</b> <b>design</b> <b>are</b> <b>the</b> points of the plane, and the blocks of <b>the</b> <b>design</b> <b>are</b> <b>the</b> lines of the plane.
