Examples of this would be: Assef's pedophilia, Nazism, drug abuse, and sadism, {{and the fact that he}} is an executioner. The American Library Association reported that The Kite Runner was one of its most-challenged books of 2008, with multiple attempts to remove it from libraries due to its [...] "offensive language, sexually explicit , and unsuit age group." [...] Afghan American readers were particularly hostile towards the depiction of Pashtuns as oppressors and Hazaras as the oppressed.

He also stated that he had exchanged uniforms with a bunkmate of Ernst and entered Birkenau in the company of Ernst. Avey got details about events inside Birkenau which he sent home to his mother and sister in code. His mother sent two letters regarding this to the War Office but never received a reply. He was interviewed on BBC Radio Derby in 2003. In 2005 the Daily Mirror reported that Avey claimed to have swapped uniforms with Ernst and entered Birkenau where he witnessed prisoners being sent to the gas chambers.|$|E
2500|$|Originally {{operating}} in two kebele in Ethiopia, the organization began by surveying community members about practices and informing {{the community of}} the results, focusing education efforts on individuals who would then spread what they had learned to others. On request of the United Nations, they turned to hosting [...] "community conversations" [...] encouraging people in the region <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> <b>these</b> subjects. These community conversations, a concept created by AIDS activist Moustapha Gueye, are based on traditional African conventions whereby communities come together for several hours on a regular basis to reach consensus on matters of communal concern. Hundreds of men and women were trained to serve as facilitators at the KMG community conversations, which initially focused on AIDS education. In 2004, due to its successful implementation of the community conversation strategy, KMG was chosen by the Ethiopian government to train people to lead conversations across the country as a key component of HIV prevention in Ethiopia.|$|E

30|$|Building {{trust between}} Asian {{immigrants}} and hosts and host services {{emerged as an}} area needing attention. Asians are not accustomed to confidentiality in the public sector; consequently, they are hesitant to trust health or other services with confidential information. Ensuring that Asian communities have confidence in service providers is essential to successful intervention. Furthermore, seeking help for gambling related problems is not the norm for most Asians; hence, it is important <b>to</b> normalise <b>talking</b> <b>about</b> <b>these</b> problems and help-seeking behaviour. This {{can be done by}} reducing the stigma associated with problem gambling, changing perceptions of help-seeking and providing culturally appropriate services. Asian immigrant communities also appear to have limited knowledge about the dangers of gambling and need to be educated <b>about</b> <b>these.</b> There is a need to dispel misconceptions about gambling behaviours and to provide information on services.|$|R

40|$|Adults {{commonly}} use spatial motion <b>to</b> <b>talk</b> <b>about</b> time. <b>These</b> metaphors are of {{at least}} three different types: moving-time, moving-ego, and sequence-as-relative-position-on-a-path. But when children grasp the meaning of spatial metaphors for time and what cognitive factors account for this understanding? In this study, we aim to answer these questions by studying young children’s comprehension of three different spatial metaphors for time. Our findings show that children begin to understand metaphors for time by age five and to explain the meaning of these different metaphors by age 6. Additionally, children’s comprehension varied by metaphor type, with moving-time and moving-ego metaphors being mastered earlier than sequence-as-relative-position-on-a-path metaphors. Moreover, we found children’s comprehension ability to be associated with their understanding of the time concept. Overall, these results suggest that comprehension of time metaphors is an early emerging linguistic ability that has strong ties to children’s cognitive understanding of the time concept...|$|R

Under the influence, however, of a cup of tea, which he seemed to stir indefinitely, he began to speak at last. A new vista of life was thus opened up, a promised land of talk, where he could find a harbour against the waves of anticipation and regret; where he could soothe his soul with the opium of devising how to round off his property and make eternal the only part of him that was to remain alive.|$|R
