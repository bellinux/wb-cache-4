To quote McKinstry, Ipswich had neither [...] "glittering {{pedigree}} or status" [...] nor [...] "strong footballing tradition"—the club had joined the Football League only in 1938, and its home ground at Portman Road was small and basic. One of the team's advantages was the patronage of the aristocratic Cobbold brewing family, to which the chairman and much of the club hierarchy belonged. [...] "I had no plan for Ipswich when I went there," [...] Ramsey later said. [...] "In fact the first thing I had to do was to forget my set ideas on how football ought to be played.

500|$|Peart {{has often}} been {{categorized}} as an Objectivist and an admirer of Ayn Rand. This is largely based on his work with Rush in the 1970s, particularly the song [...] "Anthem" [...] and the album 2112; the latter specifically credited Rand's work. However, in his 1994 Rush Backstage Club Newsletter, while contending the [...] "individual is paramount in matters of justice and liberty," [...] Peart specifically distanced himself from a strictly Objectivist line. In a June 2012 Rolling Stone interview, when asked if Rand's words still speak to him, Peart replied, [...] "Oh, no. That was forty years ago. But {{it was important to}} me at the time in a transition of finding myself and having faith <b>that</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> believed was worthwhile." [...] Peart has also ascribed to a philosophy that he has called [...] "Tryism," [...] which means that anything that one tries to attain will be attained if one tries hard enough.|$|E

Afterward, a lot of people told me that on that episode I was so 'unlike' Scully or that 'it showed my range'. I told them I thought they were wrong. I don't think <b>that</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> did here was out of character for Scully. The only thing different is that the audience hadn't seen it before." [...] Initially, Anderson called up Morgan and asked him to write a story wherein Scully [...] "fall hard" [...] for another man, which leads to an [...] "intense kind of romantic or passionate relationship". Morgan obliged and wrote a scene where Scully enjoys a passionate night with Jerse.

[...] Lincoln's statement angered abolitionists; William Seward's wife Frances complained to her husband that Lincoln had made it seem [...] "that the mere keeping together a number of states is more important than human freedom." [...] Greeley felt Lincoln had not truly answered him, [...] "but I'll forgive him everything if he'll issue the proclamation". When Lincoln did, on September 22, Greeley hailed the Emancipation Proclamation as a [...] "great boon of freedom".

500|$|The {{album was}} re-released in 1985 for the European market and re-packaged as Madonna: The First Album with a {{different}} artwork created by photographer George Holy. The cover features Madonna in similar style of dress to the original cover but this time with crucifix as her earrings. Madonna's trademark style was catching on as a fashion statement among club kids and fans, with her crucifix accessories becoming the jewelry of the moment. Madonna said that wearing a crucifix is [...] "kind of offbeat and interesting. I mean, everything I do is sort of tongue-in-cheeks. Besides, the crucifixes seem to go with my name." [...] In 2001, Warner Bros. Records released a remastered version of the album with its original artwork and two bonus remix tracks of [...] "Burning Up" [...] and [...] "Lucky Star". Madonna dedicated the album to her father, Tony Ciccone, with whom her relationship had not been good until {{the release of the}} album.

[...] He graded the songs performed [...] "C−" [...] through to [...] "A−", commending what he deemed [...] "by far the greatest performance of [...] "Ice Ice Baby" [...] ever". The Houston Chronicle Bobby Hankinson also felt the episode was a return to form. He praised the decision not to [...] "apply meaningless rules to their musical selections", writing: [...] "The freedom to not have to use songs by one artist let the storylines take priority, and not sticking to songs that share a common lyrical theme kept those choices from feeling too forced." [...] Dave Itzkoff of the New York Times recapped the episode positively, describing it as: [...] "pack more camp into an hour's worth of television than most kids will get all summer." [...] Todd VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club graded [...] "Bad Reputation" [...] "B+", writing that he: [...] "enjoyed the episode quite a bit, even as [...] found some of it rather messy." [...] Though VanDerWerff felt that not everything in the episode worked, he stated: [...] "the stuff that did reminded me <b>that</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> like about the show is its all-out embrace of a crazy mishmash of tones." ...|$|E

In an exclusive with Rap-Up, when asked about how the connection came about, Mandler said, [...] "I’m {{a big fan of}} Drake and I was really excited when he called me about doing it, and really put a lot into making it special and capturing what I think is an image he hasn’t had yet. Here’s a guy whose lyrical presence does not equal his visual presence yet, by any means. That’s something that he and I spoke a lot about. He felt strongly that nobody had really captured him, and some of the videos that had been done were less iconic than he would like to be represented as." [...] On Drake and the song he said, [...] "It’s so refreshing that he’s confident, but he’s not arrogant. I think that dimensionality is so important in a genre that is very one note with words like “bravado” and “swagger” and “arrogance” and “promiscuity.” Here’s a guy that’s finally putting a duality to the words and saying, “Yeah, I have all that and I do all that, but I’m also somebody that’s asking, is <b>that</b> <b>what</b> <b>I</b> should be doing with my life?" [...] When asked of the concept of the [...] "Over" [...] video, Mandler said that it was something that would not be expected. Mandler explained, [...] "Drake and I were very conscious about trying to push the limits and trying to push things forward. He came to me because he wanted to throw away the conventions of a medium, and take chances and be daring and take certain themes that are relevant to him and try to visualize them in not the obvious way".|$|E
