50|$|FMK's first {{generation}} polymer lower receiver was the FMK AR1 Patriot. It had reports of breakages {{at the rear}} <b>takedown</b> <b>pin.</b> After redesign in 2013 the FMK AR1 Extreme was introduced replacing the Patriot. The redesign included beefing up {{the area around the}} rear <b>takedown</b> <b>pin.</b> There may have also been reformulation of the composite polymer that is used in the production of the lowers.|$|E
50|$|Unlike {{the later}} {{generation}} Beretta 92/96/M9 series, the Px4's trigger guard is rounded for better concealed carry. The <b>takedown</b> <b>pin</b> of earlier models {{is replaced by}} a spring-loaded bar, accessed via frame recesses on both sides, which must be grasped and pulled down simultaneously to release the slide. The slide spring is doubly captive, being inserted approximately an inch into the transfer block at one end and a receiving hole {{in the front of the}} slide at the other. It is a self-contained assembly, completely captured by the polymer guide. The magazine holds the top round directly behind the barrel's breech end so only a slight feed ramp is needed. This allows the barrel to fully support the case. The 6-R rifling of the barrel generates counter-clockwise torque which is harnessed by the locking system to reduce the amount of pressure required from the rotating barrel lock's cam and pin system to effect unlocking. The steel transfer block's cam pin is 5 mm wide and 2 mm deep. The entire hammer unit mechanism can be removed from the Px4, without the use of special tools, as a single group. This allows easy access to the firing mechanism for cleaning. The Px4's design makes it impossible to assemble incorrectly from a field-stripped takedown.|$|E
5000|$|This {{style of}} rifle {{is made by}} {{combining}} an AR-15 upper receiver with an AR-15 lower receiver {{which has not been}} banned by specific name, and which has a fixed, non-detachable 10-round (maximum, anything above 10 is a felony) magazine. In such a configuration, otherwise prohibited features such as a telescoping stock, pistol grip, and flash hider may be present. While formerly prohibited under the now-expired federal assault weapon ban of 1994-2004, the presence of a bayonet lug is not prohibited by California state law and can be present on firearms without violation. However, the magazine cannot be detachable, so to load the rifle the shooter must either [...] "top load" [...] or use a tool to release the magazine lock (such as the tip of a bullet in [...] "bullet button" [...] equipped rifles). To top-load, the shooter pulls the rear <b>takedown</b> <b>pin,</b> hinges the upper receiver on the front pivot pin, and loads the now exposed magazine. Alternatively, several [...] "magazine lock" [...] devices are available which replace the magazine release button with an inset pin that requires the use of a special tool to release the magazine, thereby, disallowing a readily [...] "detachable magazine", to be compliant with California state firearms law.|$|E
