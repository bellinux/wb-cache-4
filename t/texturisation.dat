40|$|Alkaline {{anisotropic}} etching with potassium hydroxide (KOH) and the additive 2 -propanol (IPA) {{is a widely}} used process to texture monocrystalline silicon wafers industrially {{in order to reduce}} their reflection. Using IPA as additive in hot KOH (aq) the alcohol evaporates easily during the <b>texturisation</b> and the bath composition changes. Therefore IPA has to be redosed either during the <b>texturisation</b> or afterwards. The IPA concentration strongly influences the air to liquid surface tension of the etching solution. Adding IPA to an alkaline etching solution reduces its surface tension because IPA is surface active, resulting in a reciprocal proportionality. Online measurement of the surface tension allows dosing IPA to the bath solution using the surface tension as a control parameter.

40|$|During the {{manufacturing}} of crystalline silicon solar cells, several {{wet chemical etching}} and cleaning steps {{play an important role}} for the resulting solar cell efficiency. One important step especially for monocrystalline silicon is texturing by anisotropic alkaline etching which takes place in an aqueous solution of potassium hydroxide and isopropanol at a temperature between 70 and 80 degrees C. The evaporation of isopropanol and water, the consumption of potassium hydroxide and the accumulation of alkaline silicates change constantly the composition of the process bath. A replenishment of the converted chemicals is necessary to keep the <b>texturisation</b> results at a constant high level. To this clay, closing parameters are often based on operator's experience, but not on analytical data. In this paper, we investigated the suitability of near-infrared spectroscopy as a fast and cost-efficient method for the analysis of alkaline <b>texturisation</b> solutions. The effects of the chemical composition of the alkaline <b>texturisation</b> solution on the near-infrared spectra were investigated, as well as the influence of temperature variations and process induced gas bubbles in the circulation line. A partial least squares (PLS) model, which includes all the disturbing effects was created and validated in a semi-industrial scale texturing system.

This work aims at evaluating the possibilities and restrictions to determine the thickness of the ARC with inline vision irrespective of the wafer surface. Special emphasis has been put on textured monocrystalline wafers. Considering the reflection after <b>texturisation</b> the accuracy of ARC thickness measurement by color vision inspection may be improved significantly.

40|$|Purpose: Surface <b>texturisation</b> is {{a common}} {{technological}} process in solar cell manufacturing aiming at a reduction of the light reflection losses. The standard alkaline texturing of multicrystalline silicon for solar cells is not effective because of random orientation of the grains.

Electrical parameters of produced solar cells were characterized by measurements of I-V light characteristics under standard AM 1, 5 radiation.

Wafer surfaces were analysed first by thermal desorption followed by gas chromatography with mass spectroscopy (TD-GC-MS) to determine the organic contamination from the storage and transportation. The fingerprint as human organic residues on the silicon surface is additionally investigated. The silicon surface is exposed with specific estimated organic contaminations to analyse their influences on the alkaline <b>texturisation</b> process.

Silver (Ag) pastes {{are commonly used}} to form electrodes to phosphorus-doped n+ Si. However, there is still ambiguity {{about the influence of}} the random-pyramid surface texture on Ag screen-printed contacts for mono-Si solar cells. We present an experimental study to investigate this influence using screen-printed p-type mono-Si cell groups fabricated with a controlled variation in the alkaline surface <b>texturisation</b> process. It is observed that cell groups fabricated on Czochralski (Cz) wafers with smaller pyramids achieve higher average fill factor (FF) and lower average specific contact resistance than cell groups fabricated on Cz wafers with larger pyramids. To explain these observations, the pyramid texture height distributions are characterised statistically and the distribution statistics are correlated to electrical solar cell measurements and microstructure investigations of the Ag/n+ Si contact interface. Microstructure investigations reveal that most Ag crystallite growth is concentrated around {{the upper part of the}} pyramids and hence pyramid density is identified as an important parameter influencing contact formation. The influence of average pyramid height and pyramid height uniformity within a pyramid texture height distribution is also clarified with regards to contact formation. It is further observed that direct Ag crystallite contacts to the bulk Ag metallisation are not a prerequisite for achieving high FF (> 80 %).

As well as <b>texturisation</b> and an anti-reflection coating on the front side, the rear-side needs a reflector for the wavelength region exceeding 600 nm to enhance the long-wavelength response of the solar cell. In our Recrystallised Wafer Equivalent (RexWE) [1] the rear-side of the silicon layer is not accessible during the solar cell process. Therefore, several important features have to be implemented via an intermediate layer: it needs {{to act as a}} diffusion barrier of sufficiently high electrical conductivity, an excellent optical reflector, and ideally also as a passivation layer for interface defects. We try to satisfy these requirements with a specially designed reflector. It consists of SiC and SiO 2 layers with alternating refractive indices and varying characteristics that can be realised by changing the stoichiometry and layer network. These layer-stacks were implemented into RexWE solar cells by a process sequence including thermal annealing, Si seeding layer deposition, recrystallisation and epitaxial Si growth. To surmount the lack of electrical conductivity of the SiO 2 layers we drilled holes through the stacks using a laser. We call this process laser-fired rear access (LFA). The best solar cell incorporating the SiC/SiO 2 reflector shows a Jsc of 26. 3 mA/cm 2 (with front side plasma texture) which constitutes an enhancement of 4 mA/cm 2 compared with a single SiC layer.

The material's abundance and low cost make it a potentially attractive alternative to the current standard technology. Silicon nanocrystals have recently been identified as exhibiting properties potentially suitable for multiple exciton generation (MEG), which could theoretically improve the efficiency of solar cells above the thermodynamic limit on the current standard solar cell design. Silicon-doped ZnO thin films were deposited by a radio frequency co-sputtering technique, using ZnO and Si targets, onto glass substrates and Si wafers.

Merr.; SPI), pea (Pisum sativum L.; PPI) and sweet lupine (Lupinus albus L.; LPI) were evaluated. In aqueous systems, protein cross-linking by microbial transglutaminase (MTG) was significantly improved when NaCl (1 - 2 g hg- 1) was added, but respective doses of CaCl 2 reduced gel strengths. As shown by emulsion model systems of PPI and SPI with oil/protein ratios of 1 and 2 g g- 1, emulsification of corn oil into aqueous protein suspensions prior to enzymatic cross-linking enhanced gel formation depending on the emulsification technique. The impact of NaCl and oil varied among the protein isolates as to obtainable maximum gel strengths and optimum doses of these ingredients. The applicability of MTG to leguminous proteins in complex plant foodstuffs was finally deduced from their performance in complex food models of the liquid (thickened s oup), foamed (mousse) and solid (sausage-like substitute) type, respectively. The sensory characteristics of the latter were evaluated by trained panellists relative to their milk-, gelatin- and meat-based counterparts. Texture was appealing in the foamed and solid food models, but the liquid soup model suffered from unfavourable grittiness.
