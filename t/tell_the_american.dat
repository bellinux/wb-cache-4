40|$|This Article {{explores the}} deep {{connections}} between the crises facing the military and affirmative action. The military struggles with a sexual assault epidemic and a related failure to achieve gender and racial equality, both of which undermine its ability to effectively carry out its mission. Affirmative action faces growing skepticism from the American public and from the courts, which have been gradually eliminating the ground on which gender- and race-conscious measures can be constitutionally justified. In this time of crisis for both, the military and affirmative action need each other like never before. Affirmative action needs the military to <b>tell</b> <b>the</b> <b>American</b> public and the courts, once again, {{the story of how}} race- and gender-conscious measures permitted it to endure earlier crises and emerge as a stronger, highly respected institution. And the military needs affirmative action because it cannot hope to eliminate the damaging gender hostility within its ranks unless it uses gender-conscious measures to rapidly integrate its leadership—especially by assigning women to the combat positions from which they were unfairly excluded. If the military can once more lead by example, it may persuade a conservative Court to accept that there is still a place for affirmative action in American life. But the military must be willing to act and to use all of the available constitutional arguments in defense of its own policies, as well as those in civilian institutions. If affirmative action cannot survive in the military, it probably cannot survive anywhere in public life. Its fate and that of the military are inextricably intertwined...|$|E
40|$|When Guam {{received}} its Organic Act in 1950, after {{half a century}} of US naval occupation, it was not a benevolent gift from a generous colonizer nor a prize awarded to the Chamorro people for their loyalty throughout a brutal wartime experience. Rather, its long-overdue passage in an era of decolonization is attributable to various factors, including a half-century of Chamorro resistance climaxing with a walkout by the Guam Congress in 1949. The walkout generated intense national publicity, and friends of Guam residing in the United States stepped up their lobbying efforts, using the walkout to illustrate graphically Chamorro dissatisfaction with US naval rule. In a recent interview, former member of the Guam Congress, Carlos Taitano disclosed, "We knew something had to happen. We had to <b>tell</b> <b>the</b> <b>American</b> public. Martial law was really horrible and we had to create an incident which would bring publicity to Guam " (Carlos Taitano, personal communication, November 29, 1993). Taitano revealed that several months prior to the Assembly walkout, two news correspondents- one representing the Associated Press and the other the United Press- visited Guam to report on military affairs. He entertained them at his home in Mangilao and narrated to them a brief history of Guam under the oppressive naval government. Taitano and the newsmen agreed that if the Chamorro people's desire for self-government was to be heard, an incident of substantial magnitude must occur, great enough to warrant major coverage in the newspapers. Taitano agreed that should such an incident unfold, he would personally 1 inform the two reporters by radiogram. Details of the congress ' walkout were reported in newspapers throughout the United States. A few of the 1949 headlines read...|$|E
40|$|Masters final project {{submitted}} to the Faculty of the Historic Preservation Program, School of Architecture, Planning and Preservation, University of Maryland, College Park, in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Historic Preservation. 	HISP 710 / 711 final project, May 2012. One {{of the goals of}} the modern Indian movement is the protection and perpetuation of tribal cultural practices, which includes the retention of tribal language, religion, oral histories, and the protection of sacred sites. Both the modern Indian movement and the preservation movement can trace similar paths in their rise in popularity, and their efforts to advance certain policy initiatives in the 20 th century. These movements, however, have sometimes come into conflict with one another. U. S. preservation policies and programs were initially strictly focused on the preservation of historic buildings, and using preservation to <b>tell</b> <b>the</b> <b>American</b> story. Recognition of sacred sites or tribal connections to the land, as well as telling the Native American point of view of western expansion was not a priority of federal efforts to preserve America’s past. Throughout the 1970 ’s and 1980 ’s, tribes fought for greater recognition of the significance of traditional cultural properties and the repatriation of Indian human remains and sacred and funerary objects. In response, Congressional directed the National Park Service (NPS) to report on funding needs related to sites of historical significance on Indian lands. The NPS subsequently issued a report titled Keepers of the Treasures: Protecting Historic Properties and Cultural Traditions on Indian Lands (Keepers of the Treasures). The report concluded that tribes must have an opportunity to participate fully in the national historic preservation program, but on terms that respect their cultural values, traditions, and sovereignty. The report concluded with thirteen policy recommendations to Congress regarding ways in which the federal government could create, adapt, or change preservation programs to better suit the unique needs of Indian tribes. Keepers of the Treasures was issued 21 years ago and raised many concerns about the effectiveness of federal preservation programs in relation to Indian tribes and cultural preservation. After two decades, many issues and questions raised in the report remain unresolved or unanswered. Through an evaluation of NPS preservation programs and the thirteen recommendations made in Keepers of the Treasures, this paper analyzes the efforts made by the federal government to adapt its preservation programs to assist Native American communities (American Indian tribes, Native Alaskan Villages and Corporations, and Native Hawaiian Organizations) with cultural preservation projects. Additionally, this study attempts to document the ways in which preservation priorities of Native American communities have shifted over the last 21 years. The overall goal {{of this paper is to}} help the federal government improve its effectiveness in assisting tribes as they work to preserve not only significant sites, but also tribal language and culture...|$|E
