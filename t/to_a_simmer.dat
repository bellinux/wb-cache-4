25|$|Because of its bitter taste, lingzhi is {{traditionally}} prepared as a hot water extract product. Thinly sliced or pulverized lingzhi (either fresh or dried) {{is added to}} a pot of boiling water, the water is then reduced <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>simmer,</b> and the pot is covered; the lingzhi is then simmered for two hours. The resulting liquid is fairly bitter in taste and dark, with the more active red lingzhi more bitter than the black. The process is sometimes repeated for additional concentration. Alternatively, {{it can be used}} as an ingredient in a formula decoction or used to make an extract (in liquid, capsule, or powder form). The more active red forms of lingzhi are far too bitter to be consumed in a soup.|$|E

5000|$|The term [...] "poaching" [...] is {{used for}} this method but is {{actually}} incorrect. The egg is placed in a cup and suspended over simmering water, using a special pan called an [...] "egg-poacher". This is usually a wide-bottomed pan with an inner lid, with holes containing a number of circular cups that each hold one egg, with an additional lid over the top. To cook, the pan is filled with water and brought <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>simmer,</b> or a gentle boil. The outer lid holds in the steam, ensuring that the heat surrounds the egg completely. The cups are often lubricated with butter in order to effect easy removal of the cooked egg, although non-stick egg poachers are also available.|$|E

50|$|There {{is a large}} {{variety of}} camping stoves on the market ranging in {{specialty}} from being extremely lightweight to focusing on using very little fuel. The majority of campers rely on a stove for their cooking needs as they boast several advantages over cooking over a campfire. Since most camping stoves have an adjustable heat source, they can be much easier to use than a campfire. The ability to quickly adjust the flame to reduce your pot from a boil <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>simmer,</b> for example, is considered invaluable to many campers. Campfires can {{take a long time}} to start and get to a point where they are suitable for cooking over. Since a cook-stove can be ready in minutes, this is an advantage for many campers. Many types of cookware exist for outdoor cooking.|$|E
40|$|Weld {{porosity}} {{is being}} investigated for long-pulse spot welds produced by high power continuous output lasers. Short-pulse spot welds (made with a pulsed laser system) are also being studied but to a much small extent. Given that weld area of a spot weld is commensurate with weld strength, the loss of weld area due to an undefined or unexpected pore results in undefined or unexpected loss in strength. For this reason, {{a better understanding of}} spot weld porosity is sought. Long-pulse spot welds are defined and limited by the slow shutter speed of most high output power continuous lasers. Continuous lasers typically ramp up <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>simmer</b> power before reaching the high power needed to produce the desired weld. A post-pulse ramp down time is usually present as well. The result is a pulse length tenths of a second long as oppose to the typical millisecond regime of the short-pulse pulsed laser. This study will employ a Lumonics JK 802 Nd:YAG laser with Super Modulation pulse shaping capability and a Lasag SLS C 16 40 W pulsed Nd:YAG laser. Pulse shaping will include square wave modulation of various peak powers for long-pulse welds and square (or top hat) and constant ramp down pulses for short-pulse welds. Characterization of weld porosity will be performed for both pulse welding methods...|$|E
40|$|Obwervers of {{the federal}} tax scene have often noted a {{recurring}} phenomenon which enlivens the day-to-day work of the entire tax fraternity. I refer, of course, to those general upheavals caused by court decisions, treasury rulings, or new bits of legislation which purport to settle touchy issues. The result of these periodic upheavals is {{a sharp increase in}} the output of critics and commentators, all of which raises the commentative cauldron to the boiling point. By the time the boil has quieted <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>simmer,</b> a new issue and a new pronouncement (or perhaps a new pronouncement about an old is- sue) will appear upon the scene and the process will begin again. The deduction for interest is no exception to the boil-simmer-boil cycle. Although Code section 1632 contains brief and seemingly straightforward provisions, the variety of transactions which lend themselves {{to the use of the}} interest deduction has provided the impetus for a loving exploration of its possibilities. By definition, such taxpayer exploration focuses on the outer limits of the statutory provisions. The administrative and judicial reaction to this probing has again produced a shock wave, this time emanating from two distinct centers. The first such center is Revenue Ruling 68 - 643, 2 ̆ 7 dealing with the issue of prepayment of interest by cash basis taxpayers. The second, and perhaps more important, center encompasses three sections of the Tax Reform Act of 1969 : 2 ̆ 7 (1) Section 221, which limits the deductibility of 2 ̆ 2 excess investment interest 2 ̆ 2 over 2 ̆ 2 net investment income 2 ̆ 2 (as those terms are defined in that section); (2) section 421, which authorizes the Commissioner to issue regulations regarding the classification of corporate interests as either stock or indebtedness; and (3) section 411, which limits the deductibility of interest on certain corporate indebtedness issued to acquire the stock or assets of another corporation. These developments constitute new pronouncements relating to old problems. Inevitably, they will give rise to analysis, speculation and rethinking of taxpayer activity, for they embody some radically new approaches. It is the purpose of this paper to examine and evaluate these new substantive ground rules and to consider the manner in which they redefine the deductibility of interest...|$|E

6000|$|Your most kind gratulatory note {{deserved}} {{an answer}} more gratefully prompt than this. But I extended my absence from town <b>to</b> <b>a</b> short visit at Cheltenham, {{and the whole}} thing was virtually, till yesterday, a complete extinction of leisure. Delightful of you to want [...] "details." [...] I think, if I were to inflict them on you, they would all be illustrative of the cheering and rewarding side of our feverish profession. The passage from knock-kneed nervousness (the night of the première, as one clings, in the wing, to the curtain rod, as to the pied des autels) <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>simmering</b> serenity is especially life-saving in its effect. I flung myself upon Compton after the 1st act: [...] "In heaven's name, is it going?" [...] "Going?--Rather! You could hear a pin drop!" [...] Then, after that, one felt it--one heard it--one blessed it--and, at the end of all, one (after a decent and discreet delay) simpered and gave oneself up to courbettes before the curtain, while the applausive house emitted agreeable sounds from a kind of gas-flaring indistinguishable dimness and the gratified Compton publicly pressed one's hand and one felt that, really, as far as Southport could testify to the circumstance, the stake was won. Of course it's only Southport--but I have larger hopes, inasmuch as it was just the meagre provincial conditions and the limited provincial interpretation that deprived the performance of all adventitious aid. And when my hero and heroine and another friend supped with me at the inn after the battle, I felt that they were really as radiant as if we were carousing among the slain. They seem indeed wondrous content. The great feature of the evening was the way Compton [...] "came out" [...] beyond what he had done or promised at rehearsal, and acted really most interestingly and admirably--if not a [...] "revelation" [...] at any rate a very jolly surprise. His part is one in which I surmise he really counts upon making a large success--and though I say it who shouldn't, it is one of incontestable opportunities. However, all this is to come--and we stumble in judgment. Amen. Voilà, ma chère amie. You have been through all this, and more, and will tolerate my ingenuities....|$|R
