He earned a reputation for producing some of the nation's best goalkeepers when David Vanole, Brad Friedel, and Matt Reis came through the university. By 1994, he had coached 16 players at UCLA who were later selected for the U.S. national team. Schmid avoided recruiting foreign <b>talent</b> <b>to</b> bolster his squad.

5|$|Unlike most WWE events, where {{rules and}} {{participants}} for matches {{were determined by}} WWE's creative staff, {{this was the first}} event where at least some part of each match was determined by votes from WWE fans conducted on WWE's official website. The event was scheduled to feature eight professional wrestling matches. Various wrestlers were involved in pre-existing scripted feuds, plots and storylines leading to the matches taking place at this event. Wrestlers were portrayed as either villains or fan favorites as they followed a series of tension-building events. The event featured wrestlers and other talent from the Raw brand– a storyline division in which WWE assigned its on-air <b>talent</b> <b>to</b> separate television brands.|$|E
5|$|Former Germany manager Berti Vogts was {{appointed}} Scotland manager in January 2002. A {{number of players}} retired from international football after Craig Brown resigned, which meant that Vogts had {{to build a new}} squad. He tried new players and formations, but the team suffered a number of heavy defeats in early friendly fixtures. Scotland reached the UEFA Euro 2004 qualification play-offs and won the first leg at home against the Netherlands, but were then beaten 6–0 in the return match. Vogts continued as manager into the 2006 FIFA World Cup qualification matches, but resigned after the team took just two points from their first three matches. Debate about why Vogts had failed centred on whether Scotland had sufficient playing <b>talent</b> <b>to</b> compete, or if poor results had been due to his own failings.|$|E

5|$|Glencross {{was born}} December 28, 1982, in Kindersley, Saskatchewan, but {{grew up in}} Provost, Alberta. He {{is the son of}} Mel and Robin Glencross, and has a younger brother, Matthew, and sister, Kari. His parents both played hockey and say he {{inherited}} an intense competitive nature from them. His family moved to Red Deer, Alberta when he was a teenager as his parents began a livestock auction business. Glencross was small for his age, standing less than five feet tall when he was15, and as a result was often left off the top teams in minor hockey despite having the <b>talent</b> <b>to</b> play; he played Midget C hockey in Provost. He experienced a rapid growth spurt, growing a full foot in a period of 17months, and was recruited to play Junior A hockey for the expansion Brooks Bandits of the Alberta Junior Hockey League (AJHL) in 2000. He {{went on to become the}} first Bandit alumnus to play in the National Hockey League (NHL), and his number 17 was retired by the team in 2011.|$|E
5|$|Over {{the course}} of the game's development, Gearbox {{acquired}} various outside <b>talent</b> <b>to</b> assist in designing some aspects of the game. In June 1999, Gearbox announced that the successful level designer Richard Gray would be assisting in developing the multiplayer aspects of the game. Several other designers subsequently joined the project in September 1999, with collective experience from the development of Daikatana, Quake II, Doom and Shadow Warrior. In the subsequent two months, media releases displaying a variety of screenshots were unveiled. The game was released on November 19, 1999. Gearbox later released a multiplayer update in May 2000, adding a new capture the flag mode to the game, along with various new items to accompany the new mode. Opposing Force was later released on Valve Software's Steam content delivery system. Opposing Force was also published as part of Sierra's Half-Life: Generation compilation in 2002, and as part of Valve Software and Electronic Arts' Half Life 1: Anthology on September 26, 2005.|$|E
5|$|The game's {{popularity}} {{has led to}} several mentions in popular culture. References to Myst made appearances in an episode of The Simpsons ("Treehouse of Horror VI"), and Matt Damon wanted The Bourne Conspiracy video game to be a puzzle game like Myst, refusing to lend his voice <b>talent</b> <b>to</b> the game when it {{was turned into a}} shooter instead. Myst has also been used for educational and scientific purposes; Becta recognized a primary school teacher, Tim Rylands, who had made literacy gains using Myst as a teaching tool, and researchers have used the game for studies examining the effect of video games on aggression. A parody computer game, Pyst, was released in 1996; the game is a satirical free roam of Myst island which had been apparently vandalized by frustrated visitors.|$|E

5|$|The {{offensive}} line was another uncertainty for the 1997 team. Three linemen from the 1996 team {{had been selected}} in the 1997 NFL Draft: center Rod Payne (3rd round, 76th overall), offensive guard Damon Denson (4th round, 97th overall) and defensive tackle William Carr (7th round, 217th overall). As a result, Michigan began the season with only one {{offensive line}}man, offensive tackle Jon Jansen, who had started a game. Jansen, a junior, had 25 consecutive starts entering the season. The offensive line was further weakened when left tackle, Jeff Backus, suffered a ruptured appendix. In spring practice, offensive line coach Terry Malone made a plea for help during a staff meeting, searching for <b>talent</b> <b>to</b> fill in on the line. To fill the holes on the offensive line, two defensive linemen, Steve Hutchinson and Chris Ziemann were moved to the offensive line.|$|E
5|$|After {{the season}} ended, Joss {{returned}} to Wisconsin where he led Racine to the 1901 Wisconsin baseball state championship against Rube Waddell's Kenosha squad. He also enrolled at Beloit College and played American football. It {{was reported that}} Joss had signed with the Brooklyn Dodgers of the National League as early as August 18 and received a $400 advance ($), but Joss denied receiving any money. Mud Hens owner Charles Stroebel stated that he had signed Joss and other Mud Hens players for the 1902 season on August 12 and that the Western League was {{under the protection of}} the National League through September 1901. Before 1901 ended, the Cleveland Bronchos offered $500 ($) to Toledo in exchange for Joss and manager Bob Gilks, who would be a scout for Cleveland. Toledo and Joss agreed and Joss was now a member of the American League, which was paying a premium on baseball <b>talent</b> <b>to</b> rival the National League. Dodgers owner Charles Ebbets invited Joss for a meeting, which Joss declined, and Joss {{let it be known that}} he had told Stroebel he would play for the Mud Hens for the 1902 season, and received a $150 ($) advance in February 1902.|$|E
5|$|Moore {{wrote to}} Spargo on September 18, stating that his {{commission}} had approved {{the head of}} Allen but was dissatisfied with the lettering. Spargo had mentioned that President Coolidge liked the Bennington Monument, and Moore stated that the Fine Arts Commission was anxious to get right a coin for the president's state of birth; Fry, he wrote, had the <b>talent</b> <b>to</b> design a handsome coin, but had not done so. The next day, Spargo replied, hopeful that they would soon resolve the dispute. He stated that the Sesquicentennial Commission felt that designs other than the monument would not do; for example, {{the use of a}} Green Mountain Boy would both require stretching history and risk charges of imitating the Minuteman seen on the Lexington-Concord Sesquicentennial half dollar, issued earlier in 1925. He was also unwilling to have a two-headed coin, as such a design combined with the depiction of Allen would be. Spargo suggested that Moore put his objections in writing and be as clear as possible to induce Fry to continue with the project, because the sculptor wanted to withdraw from it. Despite conciliatory efforts, Fry refused to continue, and after the failure of brief negotiations with Theodore Spicer-Simson, the Vermont commission engaged Charles Keck.|$|E
