25|$|Climate was a {{particular}} problem for rugby in the Soviet Union. In 1978, a game in the RSFSR set the record {{for one of the}} coldest matches ever to be played. Krasnoyarsk played Polyechika Alma at -23' C. Because Krasnoyarsk had travelled over 2,000km to be there, the game was not called off. Instead, players resorted to wearing balaclavas, gloves, and several pairs of <b>tracksuits</b> to combat the cold. The extreme climate of the former USSR remains a problem in many regions, with winter sometimes being a split season, or the game of snow rugby being played.|$|E

25|$|The {{football}} casual subculture {{first appeared}} in the UK around 1983, when many ex-skinheads began dressing in designer clothing and sportswear to blend into the crowd and avoid police attention at soccer games. Popular clothing for English and Scottish casuals included Burberry coats, Stone Island, Lacoste, Ben Sherman and Fred Perry polo shirts, <b>tracksuits,</b> bomber jackets, Adidas or Nike sneakers, Fila or Ellesse jackets, flat caps, baseball caps, soccer shirts, and scarfs or bobble hats in their club's colours. Although shaved heads remained the most common haircut, some fans also wore undercuts, Caesar cuts, mod haircuts, and short mullet haircuts. During the late 80s, Casuals mostly listened to acid house, new wave music, and later indie rock or Madchester but a hip-hop influenced offshoot of the subculture, known as chavs, appeared during the late 1990s and early 2000s.|$|E

All over the world, Syria and Egypt, people were rioting for freedom. And these kids in England are rioting for <b>tracksuits.</b> It's embarrassing." [...] Gallagher claimed that violent video games and violent {{television}} shows which children were being exposed to were partially to blame for social problems.|$|E

500|$|After relegation {{back to the}} Fourth Division in 1970–71, the Gills {{were soon}} {{promoted}} back to the Third Division in the 1973–74 season. After this the club seemed to find its level in Division Three, regularly mounting a challenge for promotion which ultimately fell short each time, never {{more so than in}} 1986–87 when they reached the play-offs only to lose in the final to Swindon Town. [...] During this period the club produced future stars Steve Bruce and Tony Cascarino, who was famously bought from non-league Crockenhill in exchange for a set of <b>tracksuits.</b>|$|E
500|$|Following good {{performances}} in {{practice in the}} buildup, Oxford were considered pre-race favourites. [...] They won the toss and elected to start on the Surrey station, handing the Middlesex {{side of the river}} to Cambridge. [...] In the warm-up to the race, the Light Blues opted for calm waters in Wandsworth Reach while Oxford rowed part of the course, in rough conditions, up to the Mile Post and back. [...] Arriving back at the stake boat, the Dark Blues spent considerable time attempting to alleviate their boat of large amounts of water, using their <b>tracksuits</b> as makeshift sponges.|$|E
500|$|For Spring/Summer 2007, Stefani {{opted for}} a {{presentation}} rather than a catwalk show. The models, all donning identical blond wigs, wore designs Stefani said were inspired by Michelle Pfeiffer's role as Elvira Hancock in the 1983 Scarface. [...] The show included some of Stefani's trademark <b>tracksuits</b> and extensively referenced prints from Guatemala, India, and Japan. On September 5, 2007, L.A.M.B opened New York's Spring/Summer 2008 Mercedes-Benz Fashion Week. [...] The collection [...] "looked like the sixties as seen by someone {{who grew up in}} the eighties" [...] and incorporated influences from Stefani's ska roots. Fashion week organizer Fern Mallis said that celebrity designers provided synergy and energy to the fashion industry, which made Stefani's collection a desirable opener.|$|E

500|$|Run-D.M.C. rapped {{over the}} most sparse of musical backing tracks. In {{the case of}} [...] "Sucker MCs", there was a loud, Oberheim DMX drum machine, a few {{scratches}} and nothing else, while the rhymes harangued weak rappers and contrasted them to the group's success. [...] "It's like That" [...] was an aggressively delivered message rap whose social commentary has been defined variously as [...] "objective fatalism", [...] "frustrated and renunciatory", and just plain [...] "reportage". Run-D.M.C. wore street clothes, <b>tracksuits,</b> sneakers, one even wore glasses. Their only possible concession to an image extraneous to that of kids on the street was the stylistic flourish of black fedoras atop their heads. This stood {{in sharp contrast to}} the popular artists of the time, who had variously bedecked themselves with feathers, suede boots, jerri curls, and red or even pink leather suits.|$|E
500|$|Elaborating on the series' costumes, Carol Case, {{who also}} served as costume {{designer}} on Fargo, explained that she [...] "didn’t want anyone to be too locked into that 60s feel, because we were ultimately going for a ‘no period’ look." [...] Case took the series' color palette from [...] "60s rock bands—the golds and yellows and oranges and greens ... Noah said {{he wanted it to}} look like David was rescued by The Kinks". She then assigned colors from that palette to each lead character: Barrett wears orange and black; Carry and Kerry Loudermilk wear mostly navy and tan; Melanie Bird wear beige and pastel colors to [...] "convey her role as a caretaker"; and Haller wears different blues and greys, though his palette was [...] "more open than others’, given that his character {{is a bit of a}} work in progress." [...] Case sourced clothing from various vintage stores, but created other pieces from scratch, including all of the costumes worn by Katie Aselton which [...] "are more deeply rooted in the Swinging Sixties aesthetic than others." [...] The pink beanies worn by members of Division 3 were knitted by Case's sister and her friends for the series. Case deliberately avoided referencing any costumes from the comics [...] "to take this story out of where people think it sits". For the patients of Clockworks Psychiatric Hospital, Case initially used [...] "a bunch of space-age-y looks that didn’t feel right", before settling on <b>tracksuits</b> with exaggerated collars to give them a [...] "futuristic feel". The orange <b>tracksuits</b> include colored stripes to indicate the seriousness of each patient's diagnosis, ranging from white stripes for Barrett ("which puts her in the ‘least crazy’ category"), to yellow stripes for [...] "moderate" [...] Haller, and red stripes for Busker which [...] "basically means she’s never getting out of there." [...] Busker's costumes evolve throughout the series to reflect her changing role, going from the orange and red focus to black and [...] "businessy" [...] clothes to show that [...] "She’s got a job to do, and she’s determined to do it." [...] Her design then become [...] "unhinged"; eventually she wears a twizzler as a collar bar, after being seen eating them throughout the season.|$|E
500|$|The {{line was}} mostly well {{received}} by critics and Stefani was appreciated for taking fashion seriously {{even though she}} is a celebrity. Fern Mallis of IMG praised the line and Stefani as well and said, [...] "the L.A.M.B. line is clearly at the top of these lines and is as unique and individual as Gwen herself." [...] The shoes were well received by the critics, though considered to be pricey. Desiree Stimpert of About.com said, [...] " ... these shoes aren't for everyone, but will most definitely appeal to fans of Ms. Stefani's music and fashion - sense." [...] Tim Stack of Entertainment Weekly said, [...] "L.A.M.B.'s embellished <b>tracksuits,</b> Rasta-inspired knits, and gaucho-heel combos deliver the edge" [...] Nicole Phelps of Style.com said, [...] "The collection, which looked like the sixties as seen by someone {{who grew up in the}} eighties, was altogether more wearable and on trend." [...] Fashion journalist Cathy Horyn of The New York Times differed and said, [...] "If ever there was a reason for a pop star to concentrate on her vocal skills, it was Gwen Stefani's fashion meltdown." ...|$|E

50|$|When {{the strip}} began, Billy simply wore a T-shirt and black shorts. In a late 1970s strip, Billy's dad sends {{him out to}} buy a new pair of trousers, {{supposedly}} to slow Billy down, but as he buys a pair of <b>tracksuit</b> bottoms this doesn't happen, though from that point Billy wore those trousers. A more dynamic change came in the early 1990s when he began to wear a black <b>tracksuit</b> marked with a lightning bolt. When depicted in colour, originally all the non-black areas of the <b>tracksuit</b> were in yellow, though soon all but the lightning flash was in red, and later the lightning flash turned red itself. Billy initially wore ordinary shoes but around {{the same time as the}} <b>tracksuit</b> was introduced he started to wear trainers, whichare usually worn out very quickly by whizzspeed running, and as a result often have holes in the soles.|$|R

500|$|After {{guiding the}} club to {{promotion}} Andy Nelson left to take over as manager of Charlton Athletic {{and was replaced by}} Len Ashurst, but his managerial reign lasted only 16 months. [...] Gerry Summers took over and was to take the club the closest it had ever come to promotion to Division Two when, in 1978–79, Gillingham finished just one point off a promotion place, [...] but two years later Summers was replaced by Keith Peacock. [...] Peacock put together a team which developed a reputation for exciting, attacking play, and also brought through the ranks a number of young players who went on to achieve success at a higher level, including Micky Adams, Steve Bruce, and Tony Cascarino, who was famously bought from non-league Crockenhill in exchange for a set of <b>tracksuits.</b> [...] Gillingham came close to promotion several times during Peacock's reign, with four top-six finishes in six years, and in 1986–87 reached the play-offs (in their first year of existence) only to lose in the final to Swindon Town. [...] Deadlocked at 2–2 after the home and away legs of the final, the two teams had to play a third match at a neutral venue, which Swindon won 2–0.|$|E
500|$|Following a {{trial at}} the club, Gill signed for Cheltenham Town on 25 February 2004 on a non-{{contract}} basis {{until the end}} of the season. He was given a one-year contract for the 2004–05 season and, at the age of 34, played in all 46 league games; he believed that all the fitness work he did during rehabilitation from his knee injury had given him a new lease of life. Gill acted as regular deputy when club captain John Finnigan was unavailable through injury. For the following season, he was given another one-year contract, with an option for 2006–07 if he managed to play 20 games during the season. Not only did he start twice that number, he contributed to the club reaching the final of the League Two play-offs at the Millennium Stadium. His starting place and winners' medal, achieved with the help of his [...] "excellent last-ditch defending", went some way to alleviate the disappointment of missing the 2001 League Cup final. In addition, his sales experience enabled the players to look smart for the occasion; expecting to be wearing <b>tracksuits</b> for their big day because the club was unable to afford a set of new suits, Gill persuaded a local outfitters to supply a set of suits at reasonable cost. While at Cheltenham Town he became a fan favourite and even had a song created by the fans who jokingly sung about his less than impressive goal scoring abilities, [...] "If Jerry scores, We're on the pitch, if Jerry scores, We're on the pitch!" [...] to the tune of Tom Hark.|$|E

[...] Another trend in hip hop clothing was pioneered by Dapper Dan in the early 1980s (est. 1982) with the adaptation and brandishing of high-net-worth fashion house brands such as Louis Vuitton, Fendi, and Gucci and logos in custom-designed <b>tracksuits,</b> jackets, mink coats.|$|E

2500|$|Gopnik is a pejorative term to {{describe}} a particular subculture in Russia, former Soviet republics, and other East Slavic countries. Gopniks are often seen squatting in groups.

The Slav squat is associated with Gopniks in Eastern European countries together with stereotypical Eastern European behavior such as consumption of vodka and cigarettes and participation in street gambling. It is a full squat with both heels down.|$|E
