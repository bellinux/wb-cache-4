40|$|Pyridazines are a heterocyclic {{aromatic}} compound containing a characteristic N-N bond that are utilized in many fields, including medicine and electronics. It is this latter field that Dr. Snyder 2 ̆ 7 s research group is focused upon. Organometallic compounds are a better conducting material {{than the current}} inorganic compounds used in electronics due to better conductance of electricity, lower production cost, {{and the ability to}} be formed into thin films. With this in mind, Dr. Snyder 2 ̆ 7 s research group has set out to synthesize organometallic compounds for this purpose. Following procedures set forth by Snyder etc, and altered to form an off-metal route, we have successfully synthesized a library of fulvenes, <b>Thalium</b> Cp salts, 5, 6 fused pyridazines, and pyridazial complexes. <b>Thalium</b> Cp salts were converted to Rhenium and Magnenese complexes through transmetalation. We have had success with the off-metal route at both higher yields and greater purity than the previous published on-metal route. These compounds have been fully characterized by 1 H NMR, 13 C NMR, IR, and Elemental Analysis. In addition, progress has been initiated to form Bromo Thiophene complexes following procedures set forth in Snyder, etc and modified for the off-metal route.

The band structures have been obtained within the density functional theory (DFT), the modified Becke-Johnson (MBJLDA) approach for the exchange-correlation potential, and fully relativistic pseudopotentials. The calculated band-gap dependence on Tl content in this hypothetical alloy exhibits a linear behaviour up to the 25 % of <b>thalium</b> content where its values become close to zero. In turn, the split-off energy at the Gamma point of the Brillouin zone, related to the spin-orbit coupling, is predicted to be comparable in value with the band-gap for relatively low <b>thalium</b> contents of about 5 %. These findings suggest TlxIn(1 -x) N alloy as a promising material for optoelectronic applications.

40|$|We study {{periodic}} lattices, such as vortex lattices in type II superconductors in {{a random}} pinning potential. For the static case we review the prediction [1, 2] that the phase diagram of such systems consists of a topologically ordered Bragg glass phase, with quasi long range translational order, at low fields. This Bragg glass phase undergoes a transition at higher fields into another glassy phase, with dislocations, or a liquid. This proposition is compatible {{with a large number}} of experimental results on BSCCO or <b>Thalium</b> compounds. Further experimental consequences of our results and relevance to other systems will be discussed. When such vortex systems are driven by an external force, we show that, due to periodicity in the direction transverse to motion, the effects of static disorder persist even at large velocity[3]. In d = 3, at weak disorder, or large velocity the lattice forms a topologically ordered glass state, the “moving Bragg glass”, an anisotropic version of the static Bragg glass. The lattice flows through well-defined, elastically coupled, static channels. We determine the roughness of the manifold of channels and the positional correlation functions. The channel structure also provides a natural starting point to study the influence of topological defects such as dislocations. In d = 2 or at strong disorder the channels can decouple along the direction of motion leading to a “smectic ” like flow. We also show that such a structure exhibits an effective transverse critical pinning force due to barriers to transverse motion, and discuss the experimental consequences of this effect. 1...|$|E

The aim of our study is to identify myocardial viability after post myocardial infarct with SPECT myocardial imaging in patients proposed for a revascularization procedure. This prospective study looked at patients who experienced previous infarct and in whom we performed a SPECT <b>Thalium</b> 201. The myocardial viability at SPECT was revealied by a residual ischaemia higher than 50 % within a necrosed territory. The segmentar kinetics abnormalities were studied by echocardiography before revascularisation procedure then at 6 and 12 months after to estimate a recovery or at least an improvement of the kinetics after the procedure. The Segmentar kinetics study was made by qualitative analysis having allowing a codification of segments according 3 grades. We had 138 patients who benefit from revascularization procedure after detection of myocardial viability by SPECT in {{the territory of the}} MI (71 transluminale coronary angioplasty (TCA) and 67 aorto-coronary bypasses). We then confronted viable territories with the segmentar kinetics of these same territories at echocardiography, before and at the 6 th and 12 th month after the procedure. A functional recovery in term of improvement of the segmentar kinetics at the 6 th or the 12 th month is held as assessment criterion confirming the myocardial viability. 75 % patients have improved their kinetics at 6 or 12 months The SPECT in the TL 201 allowed to detect a myocardial viability and thus to predict a functional recovery in post myocardial infarct period with a 96 % sensitivity, a 80 % specificity, a positive predictive value of 94 % and a negative predictive value of 86 %.

40|$|ObjectiveComposite {{arterial}} grafting causes splitting {{of internal}} thoracic artery flow to various myocardial regions. The amount of flow supplying each region depends on the severity of coronary stenosis. Competitive flow in the native coronary artery can cause occlusion or severe narrowing of the {{internal thoracic artery}} supplying this coronary vessel. MethodsTwo hundred three consecutive postoperative coronary angiographies of 163 patients who underwent bilateral internal thoracic artery grafting using the composite-T-graft technique were analyzed. Angiographies were done in symptomatic patients or in patients with positive <b>thalium</b> scan between 2 and 102 months after surgery and were compared with preoperative angiograms. ResultsIn 123 patients, both internal thoracic arteries were patent. The remaining 40 control patients had at least 1 nonfunctioning internal thoracic artery. A lower stenosis rate in the left anterior and circumflex arteries was associated with higher occlusion rate of the left internal thoracic artery (P <. 005) and the right internal thoracic artery (P <. 005), respectively. In 19 angiograms of 18 patients, graft failure {{could be related to}} competitive flow. This included 7 patients with disease of the left main artery and a preoperative stenosis degree ranging between 50 % and 80 %, 8 patients with moderate stenosis (70 % or less) of the circumflex artery, and 3 with moderate stenosis of the left anterior descending artery. Three of the patients with disease of the left main artery, 2 of the patients with competitive flow in the circumflex artery, and all patients in the subgroup with left anterior descending arterial disease underwent percutaneous or surgical reintervention. ConclusionThe composite T-graft technique of bilateral internal thoracic artery grafting should be reserved for patients with severe (70 % or more) left anterior descending and circumflex arterial stenosis...|$|E
40|$|AbstractObjectives. The {{study was}} {{designed}} to compare pharmacologic and exercise stress during thallum- 201 single-photon tomography in a multkenter prospective crossover trial. Background. Both exercise and adenosine myocardial perfusion imaging have high sensitivity and specificity for detection of coronary artery disease. However, few data are available comparing these two stress tests in the same patients. Methods. The study group consisted of 175 subjects: 55 healthy volunteers and 120 patients with suspected coronary artery disease. All subjects underwent two <b>thalium</b> tomograpltic tests performed 30 days apart, one during intravenous administration of adenosine (140 μg/kg per min for 6 min) and one during exercise stress. All images were computer quantified and interpreted without knowledge of the stress test performed. Interpretation agreement was assessed by kappa and Z statistics. Results. Agreement on the presence of normal or abnormal tomograms by adenosine and exercise scintigraphy was 82. 8 % by visual analysis with kappa and Z statistics of 0. 65 (p < 0. 0001) and 11. 1 (p < 0. 00001), respectively. The agreement by computer quantification was 86 % with kappa amd Z statistics of 0. 709 (p < 0. 0001) and 12. 2 (p < 0. 00001), respectively. Agreement on localisation of the perfusion defect to a specfic coronary vascular territory varied from 82. 7 % to 91. 4 % with highly significant kappa and Z statistics (p < 0. 0001). There was a good correlation between quantified perfusion defect size by adenosine and exercise (r = 0. 80, p < 0. 0001), but the values for defect size were significantly greater by adenosine scintigraphy (p = 0. 0073). Adenosine side effects were frequent but transient and ceased spontaneously in most subjects within 1 to 2 min after the infusion was discontinued. Conclusions. Adenosine thallium- 201 scintigraphy provides diagnostic information similar to that of exercise scintigraphy, although values for defect sizes are greater with adenosine...|$|E

Aspects of the dosimetry and implementation of five radiation therapies are examined, namely total-body irradiation (TBI), total-skin electron therapy (TSET), electron therapy, superficial therapy and ophthalmic brachytherapy. Computational techniques, in particular, Monte Carlo and several other numerical methods are used. The Monte Carlo platform, EGS 4, and the treatment planning system, GRATIS, have been implemented on SUN and Silicon Graphics workstations. Monte Carlo methods {{are used in the}} investigation of electron therapy planning and superficial and brachytherapy dosimetry practices. Monte Carlo techniques are used for radiation protection calculations of linear accelerator bunker design and for the optimisation of an in vivoX-ray fluorescence (XRF) technique used to measure platinum uptake associated with cisplatin chemotherapy. Inverse Monte Carlo methods have been examined and implemented. Inverse methods, applied to in-phantom dose measurements, are used to determine phase-space information. such as spectra, for an incident electron beam. Analogous methods are examined for megavoltage and superficial X-rays in particular, source parameterisation with attenuation and photoactivation techniques. Two linear accelerators, a Varian 2100 C and a Varian 600 C, provide Megavoltage X-rays or electrons. The TBI therapy uses a 6 MV X-ray beam. The TSET technique uses 6 MeV electrons which degraded to a lower energy by a screen placed in front of the patient at an extended source distance. The 9 Me V and the 20 Me V electron modalities are also closely examined. Two Philips superficial therapy units, RT 100 and RT 50 provide 10 through 100 kVp X-rays. 1251 seeds are used for the investigation of ophthalmic brachytherapy dosimetry. Methods of dosimetry incorporated in this work include in-phantom, ionisation chamber and diode measurements. Thermoluminescent dosimeters (TLDs), Silverhalide and radio chromic films are used. Measurements have been performed in water, solid water. polymethyl-methacrylate (PMMA), and polystyrene phantoms. Fricke, ferrous based gels are investigated as a method of dosimetry in a uniform medium. Three-dimensional dose distributions are examined for several radiation modalities. The concentration of radiation-induced ferric ions and hence dose is determined using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI).

40|$|Selenium is a biologically active microelement, {{contained}} {{in a number of}} hormones and enzymes. In a bird or animal organism selenium performs the following functions: strengthens the immune system, stimulates formation of antibodies, macrophages and interferons. Also, it is a powerful antioxidant agent. It stimulates processes of metabolism in the organism, protects the organism against toxic manifestations of cadmium, lead, <b>thalium</b> and silver; stimulates reproductive function, decreases acute development of inflammatory processes; stabilizes functioning of the nervous system; normalizes functioning of the endocrine system. Furthermore, it stimulates synthesis of hemoglobin, takes part in secretion of erythrocutes, neutralizes toxins, prevents and stops development of malignant tumors. It also has a positive effect on the cardiovascular system of an animal organism: prevents myocardosis and decreases the risk of development of cardiovascular diseases. Deficiency of selenium in the organism causes (depending upon the extent of deficiency) either physiological changes within the regulatory norm, significant disorders of the metabolism, or specific diseases. Around 75 different diseases and symptoms of pain are related to selenium deficiency. In most countries, the level of selenium consumption remains low (20 – 40 µg/day). There are several ways of improving of the selenium consumption of a population: consumption of selenium as a medication or dietary supplement, producing selenium-enriched bread, growing greens and vegetables rich in selenium, producing selenium-enriched beverages, products of animal origin, which would be rich in selenium. In the scientific-agricultural sphere studies have been made on the influence of adding different doses (0. 2 – 0. 6 mg/kg) of selenium in mixed feeds and peculiarities of its depositing and distribution in the muscle tissues of young growth of different species of poultry. It has been found that feeding broiler chickens, baby geese and ducklings with mixed feeds containing selenium in studied doses contributed to a reliable increase in concentration of this microelement in the chest muscles respectively by 21. 7 – 106. 7 %, 35. 1 – 40. 0 % and 23. 2 – 66. 0 % and the leg muscles – by 13. 0 – 85. 7 %, 57. 4 – 61. 7 % and 20. 5 – 79. 4 %. The meat of these types of birds is safe for human consumption from the perspective of food hygiene, for its selenium content is not higher than the TLV of this microelement for meat products (1. 0 mg/kg). Consuming selenium-enriched meat of chickens, baby geese and ducklings within recommended physiological norms (115 g of meat products/day) satisfies the daily need of an adult for this microelement (70 µg) y 12. 0 – 23. 5 %, 29. 1 – 30. 6 % and 11. 3 – 21. 5 % respectively. Taking this into account, selenium-enriched bird meat can be considered a dietary foodstuff suitable for biocorrectional function in humans. The viability of enriching bird meat products with selenium by adding selenium-containing premixes to fodder was proven experimentally. It was proven that adding optimum doses of selenium to mixed feeds for young birds bred for meat has a positive effect on the quality of meat, particularly on its biological value...|$|E
40|$|Une étude {{concernant}} le transfert du césium radioactif dans une chaîne trophique simplifiée d'eau douce, a été réalisée dans le cadre des Contrats (CCE) n° BI 6 -B- 198 -P et n° BI 6 - 0245 -P. Les objectifs étaient la connaissance de la radioécologie du fleuve Tejo (Tage) et le comportement du césium radioactif dans un écosystème naturel. Dans le présent document, sont présentées l'accumulation par voies différentes et la rétention du 134 Cs par Daphnia magna Straus (Crustacea, Cladocera). L'accumulation directe à partir de l'eau du fleuve contaminée avec du 134 Cs, a été effectuée avec une concentration initiale, approximative de 10 Bq ml- 1. Le facteur de concentration (FC), rapporté au poids frais des daphnies, a évolué selon la fonction : FC(t) = 57, 4 (1 - e- 0, 275 t), avec {{le temps}} (t) en jours. L'élimination du radionucléide est exprimée par la fonction de rétention : R(t) = 8, 5 e- 12, 211 t + 91, 5 e- 0. 441 t, qui indique donc deux périodes biologiques, Tb 1 = 0, 06 jour et Tb 2 = 1, 6 jours. Quand la contamination de D. magna se réalise à partir de la nourriture (Selenastrum capricornutum) contaminée au 134 Cs,le facteur de transfert trophique suit la fonction : F T (t) = 5, 1 (1 - e- 0, 245 t). Dans ce cas, le processus de rétention est représenté par une fonction exponentielle à un seul terme : R(t). 100 e- 0, 410 t et correspond donc à une seule période biologique, Tb = 1, 7 jour. La contamination simultanée par les deux vecteurs semble montrer que la voie de contamination la plus importante est le transfert à partir de l'eau. Etant donné que la concentration cellulaire et la concentration en 134 Cs de la microalgue S. capricorrrutum étaient approximativement stabilisées, la nourriture n'a été responsable que de 28, 5 ± 8, 3 % de la concentration du radionucléide dans D. magna. En ce qui concerne l'étude de la rétention, on observe que, pour la contamination par l'eau, la période biologique la plus courte doit correspondre à une désorption au niveau des surfaces, tandis que la période la plus longue doit correspondre à l'élimination du 134 Cs assimilé. La rétention consécutive à la fixation par l'ingestion de nourriture contaminé, conduit à une seule période biologique, qui ressemble beaucoup à la période longue du premier cas. Considering the potential radiological risk, {{due to the}} normal operation of the spanish nuclear power plants (Jose CABRERA, TRILLO and ALMARAZ) sited in the Tejo (Tagus) River watershed, the radioecological study of the river is of the utmost interest. Aiming for {{a better understanding of}} radionuclides behaviour in the Fratel dam, a particular freshwater ecosystem in the Tejo River located a few kilometers from the border, several studies have been carried out. Besides the field follow up, an experimental study concerning the radioactive cesium transfer in a simplified freshwater trophic chain was developed, under the Contracts (CEC) n° BI 6 -B- 1 98 -P and n° BI 6 - 0245 -P, whose objectives were respectively the knowledge of Tejo River radioecology and the radiocesium behaviour in a natural ecosystem. In a radiological assessment, the use of site specific data is always recommendable, instead of using default values, what is another perspective of the present work. The importance of cesium behaviour in the environment, is related to its chemical similarity with potassium, which is a wide-spread element in the living tissues. Following a hypotetical ingestion of radiocesium contaminated foodstuff or water by man, the contamination may then be extended to the whale body, mainly the muscles. Recently, the accident in the ucranian Chernobyl power plant, has alerted the international scientific community to the problem of the environmental dispersion of this radionuclide. 134 Cs, a gamma radiation emitter, was the isotope selected for the experiments. Its usual concentration in the radioactive liquid effluents released by PWR plants, is similar to the one of 137 Cs, an isotope with a half-life of 30. 15 years. 134 Cs has a half-life of only 2. 07 years, which is an advantage regarding the production of radioactive wastes resulting from the experiments. Our objective is to understand the mechanisms of the 134 Cs transfer along the trophic chain, and to determine the parameters that might integrate e radioecological model, namely the concentration factors between organisms and water, and the trophic transfer factors between consumers and nourishment. The simplified trophic chain concerned : a primary producer, the green microalgae Selenastrum capricernutum Printz (CORISCO and CARREIRO, 1990 a); a primary consumer, the planktonic crustacean Daphnia magna Straus; and a secondary consumer, the omnivorous fish Tinca tinta L. (CORISCO and CARREIRO, 1990 b). In this paper the 134 Cs uptake and retention by Daphnia magna Straus, (Crustacea, Cladocera) via different pathways, are presented. D. magna is a filter-feeding organism very common in freshwater ecosystems and frequently used as a test organism in toxicology. Several authors have been using it, as well, in the field of experimental radioecology. These small crustaceans, hardly exceeding a 3 mm mesh size, reproduce predominantly by parthenogenesis and, in laboratorial conditions, this process may be permanent if optimum temperature, abundant feeding and water quality are maintained. The main chemical characteristics of Fratel water, which was used in this study, are presented. The average stable cesium concentration, determined by instrumental neutron activation analysis, is 6 x 10 - 5 ppm. During the experiments, the temperature was kept at 20 ± 2 °C and artificial light was maintained for 15 h a day, using daylight fluorescent tubes (36 watt). The radiocesium used was a 134 Cs chloride in a 0. 1 M solution, with a total cesium content of 1 µg ml- 1. The radioactive measurements were performed in e well type 1 1 / 4 " diameter and 2 1 / 2 " deep sodium iodine (<b>thalium</b> activated) detector of 4 " x 4 ", connected to monochannel analyser. The direct uptake from 134 Cs Iabelled river water was carried out using an initial radionuclide concentration in the water near to 10 Bq ml- 1. The concentration factor (CF), referred to wet weight of daphnids, evolved according to the function : CF (t) = 57. 4 (1 - e- 0. 275 t), with time (t) referred to days. When the contamination of D. magna was carried out through the nourishment, 134 Cs Iabelled Selenastrum capricornutum, the trophic transfer factor (TF) followed the exponential function : TF(t) = 5. 1 (1 - e- 0. 245 t). Combining both pathways simultaneously, water appears to be the main contamination source. The number of cells and 134 Cs concentration in microalgae S. capricornutum being approximately stabilized, nourishment was responsable for 28. 5 ± 8. 3 % of the radionuclide concentration in D. magna. However, using the functions issued from the separated pathways experiments, the assessed contamination of D. magna suggests that the trophic pathway would be predominant. The evaluation of the relative importance of the contamination pathways, would very likely be dependent on the experimental conditions. Therefore, experimental results must be carefully taken in consideration, and an approach as best as possible to the environmental conditions should be attempted. The elimination of the radionuclide, after the uptake from water, is expressed by the retention function : R (t) = 8. 5 e- 12. 211 t + 91. 5 e- 0. 441 t, meaning two biological retention compartments with half-lives Tb 1 = 0. 06 day and Tb 2 = 1. 6 days. Following the uptake from the food pathway, retention is expressed by an exponential with only one term : R(t) = 100 e- 0. 494 t and, therefore, only one hall-life, Tb = 1. 7 days. From the retention study after 134 Cs uptake from water, it appears that the shorter hall-life might correspond to the surface desorption, whereas the longer one might correspond to the loss of assimilated 134 Cs. Following uptake from ingestion of labelled food, retention study lead to a single hall-life, very similar to the longer one in the previous case. These results would suggest that water and food pathways act differently when tested together or separately, and assimilation must be the main concentration mechanism of 134 Cs for the crustacean Daphnia magna. Considering the importance of these planktonic crustaceans as a link in the freshwater trophic chains, the concentration factor at equilibrium (57 ± 3) and mainly the trophic transfer factor et equilibrium (5. 0 ± 0. 6), a significative contamination concerning the 134 Cs, could be reached...|$|E
