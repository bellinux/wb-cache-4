500|$|Many episodes {{written by}} Lawrence develop {{and explore the}} {{relationship}} between Karen and her husband. Lawrence has stated that he feels Karen makes Plankton-focused episodes more humorous and that her presence helps portray him as a multidimensional character. In a 2009 interview with Andy Goodman, he said, [...] "I want more Karen on the show... The married life of an evil genius is <b>the</b> <b>funniest</b> <b>thing</b> to me, so in that regard [...] definitely enhances Plankton's stories, making him more than just your typical bad guy." ...|$|E
500|$|When {{asked in}} an {{interview}} with Australia's Herald Sun if Brown knew him, Harris replied, [...] "Well, he's never heard of me, that's <b>the</b> <b>funniest</b> <b>thing.</b> But the producer he's worked with, DJ Frank E, has definitely heard of me. He's a respected producer, he's worked with Tiësto on a few tracks, perhaps that's where the link is. It's all a bit of fun." [...] Brown later spoke with Harris and upon hearing the similarities between the two songs, had Harris' name added to the songwriting credits.|$|E
500|$|Later, Doug Herzog from Comedy Central saw the Jesus vs. Santa {{short and}} {{considered}} {{it to be}} [...] "literally <b>the</b> <b>funniest</b> <b>thing</b> 'd ever seen," [...] and requested Parker and Stone to develop a show for his network. During the negotiations, Parker and Stone brought {{up the idea of}} a Mr. Hankey episode, with Parker claiming to have asked [...] "one thing we have to know before we really go any further: {{how do you feel about}} talking poo?" [...] The network's executives were receptive to the idea, which would be one of the main reasons Parker and Stone decided to sign on with the channel. The first episode of the series, [...] "Cartman Gets an Anal Probe", debuted on Comedy Central on August 13, 1997, while Mr. Hankey debuted a few months later in the ninth episode, [...] "Mr. Hankey, the Christmas Poo".|$|E

500|$|Initially, Reitman {{had wanted}} to direct but had made only one film, Cannibal Girls, for $5,000. The film's {{producers}} approached Richard Lester and Bob Rafelson before considering John Landis, who got the director job based on his work on Kentucky Fried Movie. That film's script and continuity supervisor was the girlfriend of Sean Daniel, an assistant to Mount. Daniel saw Landis' movie and recommended him. Landis then met with Mount, Reitman and Simmons and got the job. Landis remembers, [...] "When I was given the script, it was <b>the</b> <b>funniest</b> <b>thing</b> I had ever read up to that time. But it was really offensive. There {{was a great deal}} of projectile vomiting and rape and all these things". There was also friction between Landis and the writers early on because Landis was a high-school dropout from Hollywood and they were college graduates from the East Coast. Ramis remembers, [...] "He sort of referred immediately to Animal House as 'my movie.' We'd been living with it for two years and we hated that". According to Landis, he drew inspiration from classic Hollywood comedies featuring the likes of Buster Keaton, Harold Lloyd, and the Marx Brothers.|$|E
500|$|In two {{separate}} 2016 AMAs on Reddit, both Nick Jonas and Joe Jonas {{reflected on the}} episode. [...] "When it first came out I didn't think it was funny to be honest, but probably because I was actually living all of that in real time, so it just made it harder to come and live your life as a young person and have all that going on," [...] Nick said. [...] "But years later and once the purity rings were no longer around, it was very funny to me and I've actually watched the episode a few times." [...] "I loved it. When it first came out I was so pumped". Joe said. [...] "I know that Nick was really kind of not into watching it, but I thought it was <b>the</b> <b>funniest</b> <b>thing</b> {{at the time and}} it's kind of a compliment because obviously {{if you go to a}} comedy show and they pick you out and make fun of you, you can't heckle back, you gotta just take it and enjoy it, and for me I've always been a fan and I knew that was kind of a wow we made it moment, and also they were kind of attacking Disney more than me, so I didn't really feel threatened. Now I watch it back and laugh and Mickey kicked my ass so I won the episode by being beat up by Mickey Mouse." ...|$|E
500|$|Bathurst reprised {{the role}} in the Cold Feet series, which ran for five years from 1998 to 2003. He {{described}} the character of David as an [...] "emotional cripple", originally with little depth. The third series features an affair between David and a political activist played by Yasmin Bannerman. Bathurst appreciated the opportunity to bring some depth to a previously one-dimensional character, but was more impressed with the storylines {{that came out of}} the affair, rather than the affair itself: [...] "It was the deception, the guilt and the recrimination rather than the actual affair, which was neither interesting nor remarkable". Like other cast members, Bathurst was able to suggest storylines as the series went on; one episode features David celebrating his fortieth birthday and Bathurst suggested the character could get a Harley-Davidson motorbike. Granada paid for him to take motorcycle lessons and a test. On the day before taking his test, the filming of a scene where David takes off on his new bike was scheduled. Bathurst [...] "wobbled, missed the camera and crashed into the pavement", leading director Simon Delaney to exclaim it was <b>the</b> <b>funniest</b> <b>thing</b> he had ever seen. In another episode, David buys a racehorse – ostensibly as a birthday present for his wife – in a plot born out of Bathurst's own love of horseracing. The role made him more widely recognisable and he often received prospective scripts that were [...] "obvious rewrites of the character". He turned them down, preferring to play a [...] "good person", which would be more interesting from a dramatic point of view.|$|E

500|$|Pornographic Apathetic {{received}} positive reception from journalist Gary Dowell of The Dallas Morning News, {{who described}} it as [...] "Especially notable ... an experimental work that strips the mystique from porn". Pornographic Apathetic was selected {{for inclusion in the}} Puchon International Fantastic Festival (PiFan) in South Korea; the festival [...] "aims to identify the important elements of fantastic films, such as creativity and popularity". The movie was shown at the Paris Porn Film Fest at the Le Brady cinema, in Paris, France. The film was featured in an exhibit in Vienna, examining the nature of pornography. Writing for San Antonio Express-News, Mike Greenberg observed, [...] "T. Arthur Cottam's Pornographic Apathetic is just about <b>the</b> <b>funniest</b> <b>thing</b> I've ever seen. (The excellent actors are mostly clothed, never touch each other and are nearly motionless, but the dialogue is not suitable for children or bluenoses.)" [...] The film was given a favorable review by reporter Robert W. Butler of The Kansas City Star who covered the piece during its presentation at the Kansas City Filmmakers Jubilee. Butler wrote, [...] "Your ears will burn while watching T. Arthur Cottam's superlative satiric essay on the desensitizing effects of pornography, but you'll also be laughing. ... It's lurid. It's raunchy. It's vile. But all this nasty lubricity is delivered deadpan, a device that deconstructs the whole intention of porn." [...] Marc Mohan reviewed the film during its feature at the Portland International Short Short Film Festival, and wrote that it [...] "makes the most of its one-joke premise". In 2007, The Orlando Sentinel characterized Cottam as a favorite film-maker at the Florida Film Festival. Los Angeles Times journalist Borzou Daragahi cited the film as an example of problems with the adult film industry in an article about a sexual art exhibit; he commented, [...] "The piece makes you laugh while illustrating one of the paradoxes of smut: At its core, it's rather idiotic and boring." ...|$|E
500|$|In the 1971 Candidates matches, Fischer {{was set to}} {{play against}} Soviet {{grandmaster}} and concert pianist Mark Taimanov in the quarter-finals. [...] "Their match was to begin in May 1971 in Vancouver, Canada, on the beautiful campus of the University of British Columbia." [...] "Analysts and players alike predicted that Fischer would win the Candidates, but not without a struggle. Tal predicted that Fischer would win 5½–4½ against Taimanov." [...] " [...] saw himself as the firm favorite in the Taimanov match. He was not alone; the noncommunist press was of the same mind. Only Taimanov insisted that he could win, dismissing Fischer as a mere computer". Taimanov had reason to be confident. He was backed by the firm guidance of Botvinnik, who [...] "had thoroughly analysed Fischer's record and put together a 'dossier' on him", from {{when he was in}} talks to play Fischer in a match [...] "a couple of years earlier". After Fischer defeated Taimanov in the second game of the match, Taimanov asked Fischer how he managed {{to come up with the}} move 12. N1c3, to which Fischer replied [...] "that the idea was not his—he had come across it in the monograph by the Soviet master Alexander Nikitin in a footnote". Taimanov said of this: [...] "It is staggering that I, an expert on the Sicilian, should have missed this theoretically significant idea by my compatriot, while Fischer had uncovered it in a book in a foreign language!" [...] With the score at 4–0, in Fischer's favor, the fifth game adjournment was a sight to behold. Schonberg explains the scene:Taimanov came to Vancouver with two seconds, both grandmasters. Fischer was alone. He thought that the sight of Taimanov and his seconds was <b>the</b> <b>funniest</b> <b>thing</b> he had ever seen. There Taimanov and his seconds would sit, six hands flying, pocket sets waving in the air, while variations were being spouted all over the place. And there sat Taimanov with a confused look on his face. Just before resuming play [...] the seconds were giving Taimanov some last-minute advice. When poor Taimanov entered the playing room and sat down to confront Fischer, his head was so full of conflicting continuations that he became rattled, left a Rook en prise and immediately resigned. Fischer beat Taimanov by the score of 6–0. [...] "The record books showed that the only comparable achievement to the 6–0 score against Taimanov was Wilhelm Steinitz's 7–0 win against Joseph Henry Blackburne in 1876 in an era of more primitive defensive technique." [...] "Who would have imagined that any challenger's match would ever have been decided by a perfect score, when the participants are all to be ranked among the strongest players in the world?" [...] "It is difficult to portray to non-chess players the magnitude of such a shutout. A typical result between well-matched players might be, say, six wins to four, with nine draws". Taimanov later recalled, [...] "When Grand Masters play, they see the logic of their opponent's moves. One's moves may be so powerful that the other may not be able to stop him, but the plan behind the moves will be clear. Not so with Fischer. His moves did not make sense..." ...|$|E
2500|$|Among {{those with}} a more {{negative}} view of the album was Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic, who described the album's sound as [...] "passé" [...] and summed the band's effort up as [...] "opting to create a muddled, colorless murk", giving it 2 and a half out of 5 stars. Johan Wippsson from Melodic acknowledged the band's progression but felt that the album is [...] "weak" [...] and [...] "too shattered". [...] NME magazine's Dan Silver gave it a rating of 2/10, calling it the [...] "sound of a band trying and failing to forge a new identity", and referring to the song [...] "Hands Held High", a song about terrorist attacks and war, as [...] "far and away <b>the</b> <b>funniest</b> <b>thing</b> you will hear all year".|$|E

2500|$|On 15 October 1858, Our American Cousin premiered in New York. After {{a couple}} of unhappy weeks in the small role, Sothern began portraying the role as a lisping, skipping, eccentric, weak-minded fop prone to {{nonsensical}} references to sayings of his [...] "bwother" [...] Sam. His ad-libs were a sensation, earning good notices for his physical comedy and spawning much imitation and merry mockery {{on both sides of}} the Atlantic. His exaggerated, droopy side-whiskers became known as [...] "Dundrearys". Sothern gradually expanded the role, adding gags and business until it became the central figure of the play. The most famous scene involved Dundreary reading a letter from his even sillier brother. The play ran for 150 nights, which was very successful for a New York run at the time. Sothern made his London debut in the role when the play ran for 496 performances at the Haymarket Theatre in 1861, earning rave reviews. The Athenaeum wrote, [...] "it is certainly <b>the</b> <b>funniest</b> <b>thing</b> in the world... a vile caricature of a vain nobleman, intensely ignorant, and extremely indolent".|$|E
