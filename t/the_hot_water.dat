5|$|In total, 36% of all {{materials}} and labour costs were spent in Wales, with approximately 1,000tonnes (157,500 stone) of Welsh slate used. The environmental {{features of the}} building have allowed energy savings of between 30% and 50% compared to buildings without these features. The features include 27 pipes that were drilled 100m below ground, so that during cold spells, water is pumped through the pipes and heated to 14°C by geothermal energy. <b>The</b> <b>hot</b> <b>water</b> is then pumped {{back up to the}} slate floor to warm the building to a constant temperature. In warm spells, the same system helps to keep the building cool. A biomass boiler was installed to use wood chips from recycled waste wood to heat the building, and rainwater is collected from the roof to flush the toilets in the building.|$|E

25|$|There is also {{a growing}} concern {{about the use of}} {{oversized}} heat plates inside the HIU. Some customers use a 50kW heat plate for <b>the</b> <b>hot</b> <b>water</b> and yet if they had a gas boiler at most would use 23kW.|$|E
25|$|An {{added benefit}} is reduced oxygen levels {{in such a}} closed system, which allows for some {{relaxation}} in the requirements for materials used in <b>the</b> <b>hot</b> <b>water</b> storage tank and the closed water circuits, external heat exchangers, and associated pipework.|$|E
25|$|While in {{the water}} the divers will often use a hot water suit {{to protect against the}} cold. <b>The</b> <b>hot</b> <b>water</b> comes from boilers on the surface and is pumped down to the diver via the bell's {{umbilical}} and then through the diver's umbilical.|$|E

25|$|Injected poisons (e.g., {{from the}} sting of animals) can be treated by binding the {{affected}} body part with a pressure bandage and placing the affected body part in hot water (with a temperature of 50°C). The pressure bandage prevents the poison being pumped throughout the body, and <b>the</b> <b>hot</b> <b>water</b> breaks it down. This treatment, however, only works with poisons composed of protein-molecules.|$|E
25|$|The {{event-driven}} SOA software could {{shut off}} the heating element of water heaters to the pre-set response limits established by individual homeowners. For example, if the market price of electricity for a given hour exceeded the home owner's limit, the home owner could plan to go without recharging the water's hot temperature for that hour, when prices were high, and opt to delay <b>the</b> <b>hot</b> <b>water</b> temperature recharge to the next hour when electricity market prices might be lower.|$|E

50|$|Despite his namesake {{being given}} to the area, Breitenbucher {{was not the first}} white man to visit the springs. As early as the 1830s, the springs were known to be visited by pioneers and other trappers, who used <b>the</b> <b>hot</b> <b>waters</b> to cook meat.|$|R
25|$|When flow {{starts from}} the {{uppermost}} outlet, cold water enters the tank at the bottom. This drop in temperature causes the thermostat {{to switch on}} the electric heating element {{at the bottom of}} the tank. When the water at the top of the tank is drawn off <b>the</b> <b>hot</b> <b>water</b> at the top is displaced by relatively cooler water, the top thermostat turns the top element on. When the flow stops, the elements stay on until their settings are met.|$|E
25|$|Accordingly, an {{arbitrary}} volume {{of hot water}} can be stored, {{as long as the}} stratification is kept intact. In this case there must not be vertical metal plates or tubes as they would conduct heat through the water layers, defeating the purpose of stratification. When effectively employed this technique can maintain water as high as 95°C (i.e. just below boiling) yielding a higher energy density, and this energy can be stored a long time provided <b>the</b> <b>hot</b> <b>water</b> remains undiluted.|$|E
25|$|Another {{method to}} store {{heat in a}} {{hot water storage tank}} has many names: Stratified hot water storage tank with closed water circuit, {{stratified}} thermal storage, thermocline tank and water stratified tank storage but in all cases the significant difference is that pains are taken to maintain the vertical stratification of the water column, in other words to keep <b>the</b> <b>hot</b> <b>water</b> {{at the top of the}} tank while the water at the bottom is at a distinctly lower temperature.|$|E

25|$|In the Eastern Orthodox Church, altar servers {{assist the}} higher clergy during services. They might carry the cross, candles or liturgical fans in processions and entrances; {{maintain}} the censer, ensuring it has enough live charcoal, loading it with incense and {{handing it to}} the priest or deacon when required; preparing <b>the</b> <b>hot</b> <b>water</b> (zeon) in time {{for it to be}} added to the chalice at the Divine Liturgy; prepare the antidoron for the people to receive after Holy Communion; and any other necessary tasks so that the priest need not be distracted during the service.

25|$|Heated {{water in}} the suit forms an active {{insulation}} barrier to heat loss, but the temperature must be regulated within fairly close limits. If the temperature falls below about 32°C, hypothermia can result, and temperatures above 45°C can cause burn injury to the diver. The diver may not notice a gradual change in inlet temperature, {{and in the early}} stages of hypo- or hyperthermia, may not notice the deteriorating condition. The suit is loose fitting to allow unimpeded water flow. This causes a large volume of water (13 to 22 litres) to be held in the suit, which can impede swimming due to the added inertia. When controlled correctly, <b>the</b> <b>hot</b> <b>water</b> suit is safe, comfortable and effective, and allows the diver adequate control of thermal protection, however hot water supply failure can be life-threatening.|$|E
25|$|Geysers: Geysers such as Old Faithful are {{a type of}} {{geothermal}} {{feature that}} periodically erupt scalding hot water. Increased pressure exerted by the enormous weight of the overlying rock and water prevents deeper water from boiling. As <b>the</b> <b>hot</b> <b>water</b> rises it is under less pressure and steam bubbles form. They, in turn, expand on their ascent until the bubbles are too big and numerous to pass freely through constrictions. At a critical point the confined bubbles actually lift the water above, causing the geyser to splash or overflow. This decreases {{the pressure of the}} system and violent boiling results. Large quantities of water flash into tremendous amounts of steam that force a jet of water out of the vent: an eruption begins. Water (and heat) is expelled faster than the geyser’s recharge rate, gradually decreasing the system’s pressure and eventually ending the eruption.|$|E

25|$|Hot water {{suits are}} used in cold water {{commercial}} surface supplied diving. A hose in the umbilical line, which links the diver to the surface support, carries <b>the</b> <b>hot</b> <b>water</b> from a heater on the surface down to the suit. The diver controls the flow rate of the water from a valve near his waist, allowing him to vary {{the warmth of the}} suit in response to changes in environmental conditions and workload. Tubes inside the suit distribute the water to the limbs, chest, and back. Special boots, gloves, and hood are worn. These suits are normally made of foamed neoprene and are similar to wetsuits in construction and appearance, but they do not fit as closely by design. The wrists and ankles of the suit are open, allowing water to flush out of the suit as it is replenished with fresh hot water from the surface.|$|E
25|$|In 302 BC he {{returned}} {{a second time}} to Greece as liberator, and reinstated the Corinthian League, but his licentiousness and extravagance made the Athenians long for the government of Cassander. Among his outrages was his courtship {{of a young boy}} named Democles the Handsome. The youth kept on refusing his attention but one day found himself cornered at the baths. Having no way out and being unable to physically resist his suitor, he took the lid off <b>the</b> <b>hot</b> <b>water</b> cauldron and jumped in. His death was seen as a mark of honor for himself and his country. In another instance, Demetrius waived a fine of 50 talents imposed on a citizen in exchange for the favors of Cleaenetus, that man's son. He also sought the attention of Lamia, a Greek courtesan. He demanded 250 talents from the Athenians, which he then gave to Lamia and other courtesans to buy soap and cosmetics.|$|E
25|$|Opponents {{say that}} nuclear power poses many threats {{to people and}} the environment, and that costs do not justify benefits. Threats include health risks and {{environmental}} damage from uranium mining, processing and transport, the risk of nuclear weapons proliferation or sabotage, and the unsolved problem of radioactive nuclear waste. Another environmental issue is discharge of hot water into the sea. <b>The</b> <b>hot</b> <b>water</b> modifies the environmental conditions for marine flora and fauna. They also contend that reactors themselves are enormously complex machines where many things can and do go wrong, {{and there have been}} many serious nuclear accidents. Critics do not believe that these risks can be reduced through new technology. They argue that when all the energy-intensive stages of the nuclear fuel chain are considered, from uranium mining to nuclear decommissioning, nuclear power is not a low-carbon electricity source. Those countries that do not contain uranium mines cannot achieve energy independence through existing nuclear power technologies. Actual construction costs often exceed estimates, and spent fuel management costs do not have a clear time limit.|$|E
