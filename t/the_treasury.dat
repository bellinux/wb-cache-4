5|$|By {{the late}} Stuart period, <b>the</b> <b>Treasury</b> was often run {{not by a}} single {{individual}} such as a Lord High Treasurer but by a committee of Lords of <b>the</b> <b>Treasury,</b> led by the First Lord of <b>the</b> <b>Treasury.</b> The last Lords High Treasurer, Lord Godolphin (1702–1710) and Lord Oxford (1711–1714), ran the government of Queen Anne.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>Treasury</b> Building is {{the center}} of a network of {{underground}} tunnels. In addition to the tunnel connecting it to the White House, another tunnel runs from <b>the</b> <b>Treasury</b> Building to Riggs National Bank, while yet another connects to <b>the</b> <b>Treasury</b> Annex (since 2015 known as Freedman's Bank). Unlike the White House to Treasury Building tunnel, which was constructed as an emergency exit, the other tunnels were built to facilitate the movement of freight and access to utility lines.|$|E
5|$|The {{office of}} {{quaestor}} {{was considered the}} lowest-ranking of all major political offices. Quaestors were elected by the Tribal Assembly, and the assignment of their responsibilities was settled by lot. Magistrates often chose which quaestor accompanied them abroad, and these quaestors often functioned as personal secretaries responsible for the allocation of money, including army pay. Urban quaestors had several important responsibilities, such as {{the management of the}} public treasury, (the aerarium Saturni) where they monitored all items going into, and coming out of, <b>the</b> <b>treasury.</b> In addition, they often spoke publicly about the balances available in <b>the</b> <b>treasury.</b> The quaestors could only issue public money for a particular purpose if they were authorized to do so by the senate. The quaestors were assisted by scribes, who handled the actual accounting for <b>the</b> <b>treasury.</b> <b>The</b> <b>treasury</b> was a repository for documents, as well as for money. The texts of enacted statutes and decrees of the Roman Senate were deposited in <b>the</b> <b>treasury</b> {{under the supervision of the}} quaestors.|$|E

5|$|Among {{the issues}} that the Mint Bureau had to face in 1933 and 1934 was the calling-in of most gold coins. When <b>the</b> <b>Treasury</b> Department issued {{regulations}} allowing such coins to be surrendered at branches of the Federal Reserve Bank, O'Reilly sent out a memorandum over her signature as acting director noting that the Fed had no facilities to accept any gold other than bars with a government stamp. At the time, the Mint Bureau {{was one of the}} lowest-status branches of the Department of <b>the</b> <b>Treasury,</b> esteemed far less than the Secret Service and other law enforcement-related agencies that fell under <b>the</b> <b>Treasury</b> Secretary. Burdette points out that the gold regulations showed a lack of basic Mint knowledge both by Roosevelt's appointees and the holdover senior officials from the Hoover administration.|$|E

5|$|In {{the early}} 1960s, a large {{quantity}} of unissued Morgan dollars {{was discovered in}} <b>the</b> <b>Treasury</b> vaults, including issues once thought rare. Individuals began purchasing large quantities of the pieces at face value, and eventually <b>the</b> <b>Treasury</b> ceased exchanging silver certificates for silver coin. Beginning in the 1970s, <b>the</b> <b>Treasury</b> conducted a sale of silver dollars minted at the Carson City Mint through the General Services Administration. In 2006, Morgan's reverse design was used on a silver dollar issued to commemorate the old San Francisco Mint building.|$|E
5|$|Pierce charged Treasury Secretary James Guthrie with {{reforming}} <b>the</b> <b>Treasury,</b> {{which was}} inefficiently managed and had many unsettled accounts. Guthrie increased oversight of Treasury employees and tariff collectors, {{many of whom}} were withholding money from the government. Despite laws requiring funds to be held in <b>the</b> <b>Treasury,</b> large deposits remained in private banks under the Whig administrations. Guthrie reclaimed these funds and sought to prosecute corrupt officials, with mixed success.|$|E

50|$|<b>The</b> ante-bellum <b>Treasury</b> Notes did {{not have}} legal tender status, but {{financial}} innovation during the Civil War caused <b>the</b> term <b>Treasury</b> Note to become associated with legal tender instruments such as the United States Notes introduced in 1862 and <b>the</b> Compound Interest <b>Treasury</b> Notes introduced in 1863. The appearance of these new obligations, together with the changes {{brought about by the}} National Banking Act, effectively eliminated most of the uses of <b>the</b> old <b>Treasury</b> Notes as money and the term Certificate of Indebtedness was introduced to apply to new notes which possessed the debt-like aspects of the pre-war Notes. Today <b>the</b> <b>Treasury's</b> short term debt needs are fulfilled by Treasury bills.|$|R

5|$|Support for {{bimetallism}} {{grew in the}} 1870s, {{and resulted}} in {{the passage of the}} Bland–Allison Act of February 28, 1878, over the veto of President Rutherford B. Hayes. This legislation required <b>the</b> <b>Treasury</b> to purchase {{millions of dollars worth of}} silver bullion each month, and coin it into silver dollars—the denomination was restored as a legal tender, except when gold was specified by law or private contract. Renewed support for silver led to the passage of the Sherman Silver Purchase Act of 1890, greatly increasing the silver purchases, and requiring <b>the</b> <b>Treasury</b> to pay for them in banknotes that could be redeemed for gold. Over the next three years, $132,000,000 in gold was withdrawn from <b>the</b> <b>Treasury,</b> and amid another depression President Grover Cleveland secured the repeal of the silver purchase act.|$|E

5|$|Charles VI died on 20 October 1740, {{probably}} of mushroom poisoning. He {{had ignored}} {{the advice of}} Prince Eugene of Savoy who had urged him to concentrate on filling <b>the</b> <b>treasury</b> and equipping the army rather than on acquiring signatures of fellow monarchs. The Emperor, who spent his entire reign securing the Pragmatic Sanction, left Austria in an impoverished state, bankrupted by the recent Turkish war and the War of the Polish Succession; <b>the</b> <b>treasury</b> contained only 100,000 florins, which were claimed by his widow. The army numbered only 80,000men, most of whom had not been paid in months; they were nevertheless remarkably loyal and devoted to their new sovereign.|$|E

5|$|Congress created {{executive}} departments during Washington's {{first months}} in office in 1789, including the State Department on July 27, the Department of War in early August, and <b>the</b> <b>Treasury</b> Department on September 2. The President also received two additional officers without departments: the Attorney General and Postmaster General. Washington appointed Richmond lawyer Edmund Randolph as Attorney General and Samuel Osgood as Postmaster General. He also appointed fellow Virginian Thomas Jefferson to be Secretary of State and Henry Knox as Secretary of War. Finally, he appointed Alexander Hamilton to head <b>the</b> <b>Treasury</b> Department. Washington's cabinet eventually developed into a consultation and advisory body, although this was not mandated by the Constitution.|$|E

White's father John Baker White also served in the Confederate States Department of <b>the</b> <b>Treasury</b> until his death on October 9, 1862.
