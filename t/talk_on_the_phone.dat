There is a sexual energy between the girls which is kind of authentic, because I know when I was a teen-aged girl, the friendships that I had with other girls were almost romantic, they were so intense. I wanted to sleep at my friend's house every night, I wanted to wear her clothes, we would <b>talk</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>phone</b> until our ears ached. I wanted to capture that heightened feeling you get as an adolescent that you don't really feel as a grownup.

40|$|Listening {{to music}} or <b>talking</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>phone</b> while cycling {{as well as}} the growing number of quiet (electric) cars <b>on</b> <b>the</b> road can make the use of {{auditory}} cues challenging for cyclists. The present study examined to what extent and in which traffic situations traffic sounds are important for safe cycling. Furthermore, the study investigated the potential safety implications of limited auditory information caused by quiet (electric) cars and by cyclists listening to music or <b>talking</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>phone.</b> An Internet survey among 2249 cyclists in three age groups (16 – 18, 30 – 40 and 65 – 70  year old) was carried out to collect information <b>on</b> <b>the</b> following aspects: 1) the auditory perception of traffic sounds, including the sounds of quiet (electric) cars; 2) the possible compensatory behaviours of cyclists who listen to music or <b>talk</b> <b>on</b> their mobile phones; 3) the possible contribution of listening to music and <b>talking</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>phone</b> to cycling crashes and incidents. Age differences with respect to those three aspects were analysed. Results show that listening to music and <b>talking</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>phone</b> negatively affects perception of sounds crucial for safe cycling. However, taking into account the influence of confounding variables, no relationship was found between the frequency of listening to music or <b>talking</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>phone</b> and <b>the</b> frequency of incidents among teenage cyclists. This may be due to cyclists’ compensating for the use of portable devices. Listening to music or <b>talking</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>phone</b> whilst cycling may still pose a risk in the absence of compensatory behaviour or in a traffic environment with less extensive and less safe cycling infrastructure than the Dutch setting. With the increasing number of quiet (electric) cars <b>on</b> <b>the</b> road, cyclists in the future may also need to compensate for the limited auditory input of these cars...|$|R
