40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to {{investigate}} knowledge and beliefs of primary care physicians (e. g. family practitioners and pediatricians), pharmacists, and parents regarding the use of antibiotics for <b>the</b> pediatric <b>common</b> <b>cold,</b> using a self-administered questionnaire for physicians and pharmacists and a telephone interview for parents. This article suggests that parents' expectation for antibiotics is a minor factor, and health care providers' unfounded beliefs in the effectiveness of antibiotics and exaggeration of parents' demand for antibiotics may be the major contributing factor underlying antibiotic over-prescription for <b>the</b> pediatric <b>common</b> <b>cold</b> in Korea. Most physicians and pharmacists knew the correct cause of <b>the</b> pediatric <b>common</b> <b>cold,</b> but majorities of the physicians and pharmacists believed that antibiotics could treat and reduce its complications. On the other hand, 34 % of the parents believed that antibiotics could prevent complications. Seventy three per cent of the physicians reported that they perceived expectations for antibiotics from parents, but only 2 % of the parents reported asking their physicians for antibiotics. In summary, this study suggests that physicians' knowledge and faulty beliefs can be more important factors for inappropriate antibiotic prescription. <b>Common</b> <b>cold</b> Prescribing Primary care physician Pharmacist Antibiotics South Korea...|$|R
40|$|To {{examine whether}} intakes of wine, beer, spirits, and total alcohol are {{associated}} with <b>the</b> risk of <b>common</b> <b>cold,</b> in 1998 – 1999 the authors analyzed data from a cohort study carried out in a population of 4, 272 faculty and staff of five Spanish universities.

The authors detected 1, 353 cases of <b>common</b> <b>cold.</b> Total alcohol intake and beer and spirits consumption were not related to <b>the</b> occurrence of <b>common</b> <b>cold,</b> whereas consumption of wine was inversely associated with <b>the</b> risk of <b>common</b> <b>cold.</b> When drinkers of> 14 glasses of wine per week were compared with teetotalers, the relative risk was 0. 6 (95 % confidence interval: 0. 4, 0. 8) after adjustment for age, sex, and faculty/staff status.

The reason for the seasonality has not been conclusively determined.

Methods. 180 healthy subjects were randomized to receive either a foot chill or control procedure. All {{subjects were asked to}} score <b>common</b> <b>cold</b> symptoms, before and immediately after the procedures, and twice a day for 4 / 5 days. Results. 13 / 90 subjects who were chilled reported they were suffering from a cold in the 4 / 5 days after the procedure compared to 5 / 90 control subjects (P = 0. 047). There was no evidence that chilling caused any acute change in symptom scores (P = 0. 62).

5|$|The {{economic}} impact of <b>the</b> <b>common</b> <b>cold</b> is not well understood {{in much of the}} world.

An estimated 22–189 million school days are missed annually due to a cold. As a result, parents missed 126 million workdays to stay home to care for their children.
