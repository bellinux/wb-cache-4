5|$|As {{with the}} Ju 87 A-0, the B-1s were {{returned}} discreetly to the Reich. The {{experience of the}} Spanish Civil War proved invaluable - air and ground crews perfected <b>their</b> <b>skills,</b> and equipment was evaluated under combat conditions. The Ju 87 had not been tested against numerous and well-coordinated fighter opposition; this lesson was learned later at great cost to the Stuka crews.|$|E

5|$|Scott and {{his brother}} were inseparable {{when they were younger}} and often played hockey together. While their father was often their team doctor, their mother taught them to skate. She {{enrolled}} them in figure skating to aid <b>their</b> <b>skills</b> development and taught power skating classes in Cranbrook in exchange for ice time for her sons. An offensive defenceman, Scott led his Cranbrook midget team in scoring with 55 goals and 92 points in 1988–89.|$|E
5|$|The use of {{scientific}} themes mark the play's position {{at a major}} turning-point in Verne's ideology. In Verne's earlier works, knowledgeable heroes aim to use <b>their</b> <b>skills</b> {{to change the world}} for the better; in his later novels, by contrast, scientists and engineers often apply their knowledge toward morally reprehensible projects. The play, by exploring science in both positive and negative lights, shows Verne in transition between the two points of view.|$|E
5|$|As {{the final}} game of the 1995 college {{football}} season for Texas and Virginia Tech, the 1995 Sugar Bowl provided a final opportunity for players to demonstrate <b>their</b> <b>skills</b> on the field prior to the next NFL Draft. Several players from both teams announced their intention to enter the draft and attempt to play in the National Football League. Star Virginia Tech defender Cornell Brown was not one of these players. Prior to the draft, he announced his intention to remain at Tech for his senior year.|$|E

5|$|As {{the final}} game of the 19981999 regular season, the 1998 Music City Bowl gave Virginia Tech and Alabama players a chance to show <b>their</b> <b>skills</b> prior to the 1999 NFL Draft. Alabama had one player {{selected}} in the draft. Cornerback Fernando Bryant was selected by the Jacksonville Jaguars in the first round with the 26th overall selection. Virginia Tech had two players taken in the draft: defensive back Pierson Prioleau (110th overall) and guard Derek G. Smith (165th overall).|$|E
5|$|As {{the final}} game of the 2008–2009 regular season, the 2009 Orange Bowl gave Virginia Tech and Cincinnati players a chance to show <b>their</b> <b>skills</b> before the 2009 NFL Draft. Cincinnati had six players {{selected}} in the draft. Defensive end Connor Barwin was the first Bearcats player taken. He was picked in the second round, 46th overall. He was followed by punter Kevin Huber (142nd overall), cornerback DeAngelo Smith (143rd), cornerback Brandon Underwood (187th), cornerback Mike Mickens (227th), and guard Trevor Canfield (254th). Several Cincinnati players were signed as free agents after the draft. These included defensive tackle Adam Hoppel, linebacker Corey Smith, and offensive lineman Khalil El-Amin.|$|E
5|$|Asia League {{was created}} {{primarily}} {{for the development of}} hockey in Asia. The league allows teams to hire a small number of imports to play on the team in order to even out strength as well as increase the level of competitiveness in the league. Playing against more skilled foreign players will allow players from the participating countries to increase <b>their</b> <b>skills</b> and benefit from having some more experienced players on their teams. China is allowed the most imports while the experienced Japanese teams are allowed the fewest. As part of some sponsorship deals China was provided western players from the San Jose Sharks, and the two Chinese teams were provided Swedish players when the Nordic Vikings were active in the league.|$|E

5|$|Government {{among the}} Yavapai {{tended to be}} informal. There were no tribal chiefs, such as Chief of the Guwevkabaya or Chief of the Ɖo:lkabaya. Certain men became {{recognized}} leaders based on others choosing to follow them, heed their advice, and support their decisions. Men who were noted for <b>their</b> <b>skills</b> as warriors were called mastava (″not afraid″) or bamulva (″person who goes forward″). Other warriors were willing to follow such men into combat. Some Yavapai men were noted for their wisdom and speaking ability. Called bakwauu (″person who talks″), they would settle disputes within the camp and advise others on the selection of campsites, work ethics, and food production.|$|E
5|$|Hand's {{three years}} at Harvard Law School were intellectually and {{socially}} stimulating. In his second year, he moved into a boarding house {{with a group of}} fellow law students who were to become close friends. They studied hard and enjoyed discussing philosophy and literature and telling bawdy tales. Hand's intellectual reputation proved less of a hindrance at law school than it had as an undergraduate. He was elected to the Pow-Wow Club, in which law students practiced <b>their</b> <b>skills</b> in moot courts. He was also chosen as an editor of the Harvard Law Review, although he resigned in 1894 because it took too much time from his studies.|$|E
5|$|Operation Shed Light was a crash {{development}} project in aerial warfare, initiated in 1966 by the United States Air Force {{to increase the}} ability to accurately strike at night or in adverse weather. During the 1960s the United States military worked hard to interdict the movement of men and materiel along the Ho Chi Minh trail. The North Vietnamese were experts {{in the use of}} weather and darkness to conceal their movement, and understanding the superiority of American air power put <b>their</b> <b>skills</b> immediately to good use. US forces seeking to impede the steady flow of supplies attempted to locate largely static targets during the day with poor results.|$|E

5|$|Several {{players from}} each team participated in all-star games {{following}} the Chick-fil-A Bowl. Virginia Tech's Kam Chancellor, Sergio Render and Stephan Virgil {{played in the}} 2010 East-West Shrine Game. Tennessee's Morgan Cox, Chris Scott and Dan Williams played in the Senior Bowl, while Jonathan Crompton and Vladimir Richard participated in the Texas vs The Nation game. These all-star games were a chance for graduating players to highlight <b>their</b> <b>skills</b> before the 2010 NFL Draft, {{which took place in}} April. A handful of players from each team were selected through the draft to play for National Football League teams.|$|E
5|$|Students of Confucian {{studies were}} {{potential}} {{candidates for the}} imperial examinations, the graduates {{of which could be}} appointed as state bureaucrats in the local, provincial, and central government. There were two types of exams that were given, mingjing ('illuminating the classics examination') and jinshi ('presented scholar examination'). The mingjing was based upon the Confucian classics and tested the student's knowledge of a broad variety of texts. The jinshi tested a student's literary abilities in writing essay-style responses to questions on matters of governance and politics, as well as <b>their</b> <b>skills</b> in composing poetry. Candidates were also judged on <b>their</b> <b>skills</b> of deportment, appearance, speech, and level of skill in calligraphy, all of which were subjective criteria that allowed the already wealthy members of society to be chosen over ones of more modest means who were unable to be educated in rhetoric or fanciful writing skills. There was a disproportionate number of civil officials coming from aristocratic as opposed to non-aristocratic families. The exams were open to all male subjects whose fathers were not of the artisan or merchant classes, although having wealth or noble status was not a prerequisite in receiving a recommendation. In order to promote widespread Confucian education, the Tang government established state-run schools and issued standard versions of the Five Classics with selected commentaries.|$|E

The Malkavians have separate dialog options, reflecting their inherent insanity. Upgrading some skills provides additional dialog options; attractive and charismatic characters seduce to get their way, aggressive characters threaten, and others persuade their targets to cooperate.|$|E
5|$|The {{quality of}} health care is {{generally}} low. In Cameroon, {{there is only one}} doctor for every 5,000 people, according to the World Health Organization.

Some of them help out voluntarily so they will not lose <b>their</b> <b>skills.</b> Outside the major cities, facilities are often dirty and poorly equipped.|$|E
