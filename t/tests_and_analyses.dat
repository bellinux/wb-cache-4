Although Beech did not {{encounter}} {{any problem}} in detanking during acceptance tests, {{it was not}} possible to detank oxygen tank no. 2 using normal procedures at KSC. <b>Tests</b> <b>and</b> <b>analyses</b> indicate that this was due to gas leakage through the displaced fill tube assembly added. [...] f. The special detanking procedures at KSC subjected the tank to an extended period of heater operation and pressure cycling. These procedures had not been used before added, and the tank had not been qualified by test for the conditions experienced. However, the procedures did not violate the specifications which governed the operation of the heaters at KSC. [...] g. In reviewing these procedures before the flight, officials of NASA, ER, and Beech did not recognize the possibility of damage due to overheating. Many of these officials were not aware of the extended heater operation. In any event, adequate thermostatic switches might have been expected to protect the tank added. [...] h. [...] "A number of factors contributed to the presence of inadequate thermostatic switches in the heater assembly. The original 1962 specifications from NR to Beech Aircraft Corporation for the tank and heater assembly specified the use of 28 V added dc power, which is used in the spacecraft. In 1965, NR issued a revised specification which stated that the heaters should use a 65 V added dc power supply for tank pressurization; this was the power supply used at KSC to reduce pressurization time. Beech ordered switches for the Block II tanks but did not change the switch specifications to be compatible with 65 V dc." ...|$|E

40|$|In this study, {{prior to}} the {{production}} of composites, auxetic and conventional polypropyl-ene (PP) fibres were produced by the melt spinning technique. The fibres were <b>tested</b> <b>and</b> <b>analysed</b> in terms of Poisson’s ratio, linear density, elongation at break and tenacity. The auxetic and conventional PP stable fibre reinforced composites were fabricated by the hand lay up method. Several mechanical properties of the composites were examined, including tensile strength, Young’s modulus, elongation at break, energy absorption, impact velocity and damage size. SEM analysis was also conducted to identify microscopic changes to the overall composite structures. It was found that the auxetic fibre reinforced composites (7. 5 % and 10 %) had the highest tensile strength and the auxetic fibre reinforced composite (5 %) had the highest Young’s modulus. The highest energy absorption was observed for the composite made with 10 % auxetic fibre loading.
