25|$|The {{recording}} {{sessions for}} Is <b>This</b> <b>What</b> <b>You</b> Want? began in London in June 1968. The {{majority of the}} songs were recorded in Los Angeles in October–November that year, after Harrison had completed work on the Beatles' White Album. Among the other guest musicians on the album {{were members of the}} Wrecking Crew, Eric Clapton, Nicky Hopkins, Klaus Voormann and John Barham. Although the album received favourable reviews, it failed to achieve commercial success. The 2010 reissue includes bonus tracks covering the rest of Lomax's output while on Apple Records.|$|E
500|$|In 2010, Apple reissued Is <b>This</b> <b>What</b> <b>You</b> Want? as both an {{individual}} release {{and as part}} of the seventeen-disc box set titled The Apple Box.

500|$|Harrison wrote [...] "Sour Milk Sea" [...] {{to promote}} Transcendental Meditation, which the Beatles had been {{studying}} in Rishikesh with Maharishi Mahesh Yogi. The group recorded a demo of the song while considering material for their 1968 double album, The Beatles (also known as the White Album). On release, Lomax's single was overshadowed in Apple's [...] "Our First Four" [...] promotional campaign by the Beatles' [...] "Hey Jude" [...] and Mary Hopkin's [...] "Those Were the Days"; it enjoyed only minor success internationally, becoming a top 30 hit in Canada. Together with its B-side, the Lomax-written [...] "The Eagle Laughs at You", the song was included on the singer's only Apple album, Is <b>This</b> <b>What</b> <b>You</b> Want?, released in March 1969.|$|E
500|$|In [...] "Is <b>This</b> <b>What</b> <b>You</b> Call Love?", Susan {{learns that}} Julie is six months {{pregnant}} {{and has no}} relationship with the baby's father. To her dismay, Julie plans to put the child up for adoption. When Susan discovers that Lynette's son, Porter (Max Carver), is the father, she supports his decision to raise the child himself. In [...] "You Take for Granted", Mike is murdered by a vengeful loan shark. The final episodes of the series deal with Susan grieving and eventually moving on from Mike's death. In the series finale, Julie gives birth to a daughter, whom she now plans on keeping. Susan sells her home on Wisteria Lane and she and M.J. move to help Julie raise the baby.|$|E
500|$|... "Butterflies" [...] was {{recorded}} by Michael Jackson in 2001 for his tenth studio album, Invincible, which was released the same year. The song {{was written by}} Andre Harris and Marsha Ambrosius, who is {{one half of the}} London bred neo-soul act Floetry, and was produced by Jackson and Harris. Jackson first met Ambrosius and Natalie Stewart, who {{is also a member of}} Floetry, through John McClain, who is DreamWorks's senior urban executive and Jackson's manager. Stewart said she was surprised that Jackson invited her and Ambrosius to a studio and asked for their input on the recording of the track. She recalled in an interview with LAUNCH magazine, [...] "It was incredible because he asked, he continually asked, 'Marsh, what's the next harmony? Girls, does this sound right? What do you think? Is <b>this</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> were looking for? He was so open".|$|E

500|$|During the 2010 {{shows of}} the tour, the {{performance}} of [...] "Monster" [...] was changed a little to include an ending, where Gaga is portrayed as getting killed by a murderer, after which she lies [...] "dying" [...] {{in a pool of}} blood. Her performances of that scene in Manchester, England, triggered protests from family groups and fans {{in the aftermath of the}} Cumbria shootings, in which 12 people were murdered by a taxi driver. [...] "What happened in Bradford is very fresh in people's minds and given all the violence which happened in Cumbria just hours earlier, it was insensitive," [...] said Lynn Costello of Mothers Against Violence. Chris Rock later defended her flamboyant, provocative behavior. [...] "Well, she's Lady Gaga," [...] he said. [...] "She's not 'Lady Behave Yourself.' Do you want great behavior from a person named Gaga? Is <b>this</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> were expecting?" ...|$|E
500|$|In his {{preview of}} Apple's 2010 reissues, for Rolling Stone, David Fricke listed Is <b>This</b> <b>What</b> <b>You</b> Want? third among the label's top five non-Beatle album {{releases}} and praised [...] "Sour Milk Sea" [...] as, variously, a [...] "get-off-your-ass rocker" [...] and [...] "dynamite". Chicago Tribune critic Greg Kot considered {{it to be}} [...] "a knockout version". Among reviews of the Come and Get It compilation, Douglas Wolk of Pitchfork Media opined that [...] "Sour Milk Sea" [...] "would've {{been one of the}} best songs on [...] if George had kept it for himself", while Uncuts David Cavanagh described the track as [...] "sensational". AllMusic editor Stephen Thomas Erlewine calls the song [...] "a dense, brilliant, and soulful psychedelic rocker". In his liner notes to the compilation, Andy Davis, formerly the editor of Record Collector magazine, highlights [...] "Sour Milk Sea" [...] as [...] "the greatest record The Beatles never made".|$|E
500|$|The song's exhortation to [...] "Get back {{to where}} you should be" [...] was partly {{appropriated}} by McCartney in his lyrics to [...] "Get Back", which the Beatles recorded in January 1969. Both sides of Lomax's single were included on his only album for Apple, Is <b>This</b> <b>What</b> <b>You</b> Want?, released in March 1969. The album similarly failed to achieve commercial success, a result that perplexed the Beatles, who continued to believe in his talents. Due to the song's strong association with the Beatles and Eric Clapton, [...] "Sour Milk Sea" [...] retained a degree of renown among rock music fans; Danny Eccleston of Mojo magazine later {{described it as a}} [...] "cult rendering". In 1970, Sour Milk Sea, one of singer Freddie Mercury's pre-Queen bands, was named after the track. In June the following year, Apple re-released [...] "Sour Milk Sea" [...] with [...] "Fall Inside Your Eyes" [...] on the B-side, but this single also failed to chart.|$|E
5000|$|The 12" [...] remixed {{version of}} the song is {{featured}} on Commercial Zone as [...] "Love Song".

2500|$|Following the {{completion}} of the White Album, Harrison and Lomax went to Los Angeles to carry out further work on Is <b>This</b> <b>What</b> <b>You</b> Want? The sessions there took place at Sound Recorders Studio from 20 October to 11 November. Seven songs were recorded at this time, six of which were used for the album: [...] "Is <b>This</b> <b>What</b> <b>You</b> Want?", [...] "Speak to Me", [...] "Take My Word", [...] "Baby You're a Lover", [...] "How Can You Say Goodbye" [...] and [...] "Little Yellow Pills". Lomax was supported at these sessions by Harrison (on guitar), Larry Knechtel (keyboards), Joe Osborn (bass) and Hal Blaine (drums) – the latter three among the top LA sessionmen at the time and veterans of Phil Spector's Wrecking Crew. Moog synthesizer pioneers Paul Beaver and Bernie Krause also contributed. Harrison later used a Moog piece played by Krause, recorded {{in the early hours of}} 12 November, on his experimental album Electronic Sound.|$|E
2500|$|Richie Unterberger of AllMusic {{offers a}} less {{favourable}} opinion of Is <b>This</b> <b>What</b> <b>You</b> Want?, describing Lomax as [...] "a passable but unarresting singer and songwriter". Unterberger identifies the best moments as the [...] "Beatlesque" [...] songs [...] "Is <b>This</b> <b>What</b> <b>You</b> Want?" [...] and the [...] "uncommonly tender" [...] "Fall Inside Your Eyes". Discussing the 2004 reissue in Record Collector, Terry Staunton described Lomax's style as [...] " [...] the same seam as Joe Cocker, albeit {{with a voice}} neither as distinctive or as powerful" [...] and singled out the [...] "gentle balladry" [...] of [...] "Fall Inside Your Eyes" [...] and [...] "Baby You're A Lover" [...] as highlights. Staunton concluded that Lomax's only Apple album was [...] "a fairly pleasing blue-eyed soul set, which is probably more revered {{today than it was}} 35 years ago". Writing in the Encyclopedia of Popular Music, Colin Larkin says that next to the list of celebrated contributors, Lomax's [...] "stylish compositions and superb voice were equal to such esteemed company".|$|E
2500|$|Is <b>This</b> <b>What</b> <b>You</b> Want? is {{the debut}} album by English rock and soul singer Jackie Lomax, {{released}} in 1969 on the Beatles' Apple record label. It {{was produced by}} George Harrison and features contributions from Harrison's Beatles bandmates Paul McCartney and Ringo Starr. The album includes Lomax's debut single for Apple, the Harrison-written [...] "Sour Milk Sea", while the US version added [...] "New Day", which was produced by Lomax and released as a non-album single in Britain.|$|E
50|$|By 1984, both Levene and Wobble had departed, and {{the group}} came under the {{direction}} of Lydon, who released a number of subsequent albums, including <b>This</b> Is <b>What</b> <b>You</b> Want... <b>This</b> Is <b>What</b> <b>You</b> Get (1984). After a late 1990s hiatus, Lydon reformed the group and has released several further albums, most recently What the World Needs Now... (2015).|$|R

Is <b>this</b> <b>what</b> <b>you</b> should be doing?" [...] Mi Fang felt ashamed when he heard Yu Fan's remark.|$|E
2500|$|Author Bill Harry {{has written}} that Lomax's lack of chart success [...] "completely baffled The Beatles because Jackie {{had one of the}} rare and {{distinctive}} voices which have the potential of turning its owner into a superstar". Leng attributes the album's underachievement to the Beatles' inexperience as label owners. He says that they relied too heavily on establishing their artists with a hit single and that, after [...] "Sour Milk Sea" [...] had failed to become a hit, this formula left Is <b>This</b> <b>What</b> <b>You</b> Want? without an adequate marketing strategy.|$|E
2500|$|Barham {{also worked}} on Harrison's {{projects}} with acts signed to the Beatles' Apple record label. Among these releases was Is <b>This</b> <b>What</b> <b>You</b> Want? (1969) by Jackie Lomax, That's the Way God Planned It (1969) by Billy Preston, and Radha Krishna Temple (London)'s 1970 hit single [...] "Govinda". The latter was a musical adaptation of a sacred Hindu poem from the Satya Yuga. Through his connection with Harrison, Barham also played harpsichord on Yoko Ono's [...] "Who Has Seen the Wind?", released in February 1970 as the B-side to John Lennon's Spector-produced single [...] "Instant Karma!" ...|$|E

50|$|Commercial Zone is {{an album}} of studio {{recordings}} by Public Image Ltd., recorded in 1982 and 1983, and released in 1984 by PiL founding guitarist Keith Levene. Commercial Zone includes five songs that were later re-recorded for PiL's fourth official studio album, <b>This</b> Is <b>What</b> <b>You</b> Want... <b>This</b> Is <b>What</b> <b>You</b> Get (1984) - for this reason, Commercial Zone is often {{considered to be an}} earlier/alternative version of that album.|$|R
2500|$|Harrison was {{the last}} Beatle to return from India, on 21 April, after which he and Lomax ran through {{material}} intended for the album at Harrison's Esher bungalow, Kinfauns. Lomax recalls first hearing the song [...] "Sour Milk Sea" [...] there, played by Harrison on acoustic guitar with Lomax accompanying on bass. Among Lomax's own material was the Motown-inspired [...] "Speak to Me", and [...] "Is <b>This</b> <b>What</b> <b>You</b> Want?", a song that {{has been described as}} both bearing a close resemblance to the Beatles' [...] "I Am the Walrus", and, conversely, pre-empting the similar-sounding [...] "Come Together" [...] by a full year.|$|E
2500|$|On release, Is <b>This</b> <b>What</b> <b>You</b> Want? {{received}} enthusiastic reviews. In a 1970 {{interview with}} Robert Greenfield of Rolling Stone, however, Lomax lamented that commentators {{tended to focus}} on the line-up of superstar backing musicians, saying, [...] "they're always talkin' about who's on the album and not the album itself." [...] Writing in ZigZag in July 1974, Andy Childs advised the magazine's readers: [...] "it's worth its weight in gold, so if it's absent from your collection, add it to your shopping list of second-hand records." [...] Greenfield and Childs both recognised Harrison's [...] "Sour Milk Sea" [...] as a highlight of the album.|$|E
2500|$|Recording resumed in London in December 1968, with {{horns and}} backing vocals being overdubbed on [...] "Baby You're a Lover" [...] and [...] "You've Got Me Thinking". The album (in its UK version) was {{completed}} in London during January 1969, in between Harrison's commitments to the Beatles' ill-fated Get Back project. Although only John Barham would be credited for orchestration on Is <b>This</b> <b>What</b> <b>You</b> Want?, Beatles producer George Martin can be heard on Get Back audio tapes from 10 January wondering whether Harrison, who had just walked out on the band, would be attending a strings overdubbing session Martin had arranged that evening for one of Lomax's tracks.|$|E
