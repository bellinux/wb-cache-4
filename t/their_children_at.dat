5|$|Stuart {{left his}} family deeply in debt, {{and his wife}} and daughters were unable to {{purchase}} a grave site. He was, therefore, buried in an unmarked grave which was purchased cheaply from Benjamin Howland, a local carpenter. His family recovered from their financial troubles roughly ten years later, and they planned to move his body to a family cemetery in Newport. However, they could not remember the exact location of his body, and it was never moved. There is a monument for Stuart, his wife, and <b>their</b> <b>children</b> <b>at</b> the Common Burying Ground in Newport.|$|E
5|$|The {{number of}} {{orphaned}} children in Malawi {{has increased dramatically}} since the HIV/AIDS epidemic began in 1985, with certain surveys indicating that more than 35% of schoolchildren have experienced the death {{of at least one}} parent due to HIV/AIDS. Because HIV is transmitted sexually, married couples who engage in unprotected sexual relations put <b>their</b> <b>children</b> <b>at</b> increased risk of becoming double orphans, or children who have lost both parents to HIV/AIDS. Older children who have lost both parents to HIV/AIDS often become responsible for the care of their younger siblings, and many double orphans drop out of school or migrate to urban areas to try to support themselves and their siblings. Girls who have been orphaned by HIV/AIDS have unusually high rates of school absenteeism in Malawi.|$|E
5|$|The {{parents and}} {{families}} of Indigenous children resisted the residential school system throughout its existence. Children were kept from schools and, in some cases, hidden from government officials tasked with rounding up children on reserves. Parents regularly advocated for increased funding for schools, including {{the increase of}} centrally located day schools to improve access to their children, and made repeated requests for improvements {{to the quality of}} education, food, and clothing being provided at the schools. Demands for answers in regards to claims of abuse were often dismissed as a ploy by parents seeking to keep <b>their</b> <b>children</b> <b>at</b> home, with government and school officials positioned as those who knew best.|$|E

5|$|The film {{begins with}} two {{unemployed}} parents obtaining employment {{in an upcoming}} theater production. Shortly after returning home, the landlady shows up and demands the rent, but can not collect. She gives them one week, but the theater production does not manifest and the parents again search for work. While they are out, the landlady finds a tenant and puts the children out on the street. They end up dancing for an organ grinder and are saved by a theater manager who puts them on his vaudeville bill. The parents come into a fortune and are reunited by <b>their</b> <b>children</b> <b>at</b> the theater. The film was met with positive reviews and some criticism for its acting and scenario, but the industry had reasons to encourage the success of Edwin Thanhouser's company.

25|$|A {{major goal}} of the series was to improve skills such as creativity, reading, math, {{critical}} thinking & problem solving, and foreign language abilities for children in preschool to about grade three or four. The growth {{in the development of}} educational computer software in general was thought to reflect the desire among parents to start teaching <b>their</b> <b>children</b> <b>at</b> younger ages. To this end, developers consulted with children, parents, and teachers during the design and development of each installment. Madeline Classroom Companion: Preschool and Kindergarten was playtested by children and their parents at Redwood City Kid's Club and Sequoia Children's Center. Many reviewers indicated that the developers achieved many of these goals well.|$|E
25|$|By 1976, Ike Turner's {{addiction}} to cocaine {{was so strong}} that he had burned a hole in his nasal septum, leading to nosebleeds, from which he would relieve himself by using more cocaine. During this time, Ike was spending more time at Bolic Sound than he was with Tina and <b>their</b> <b>children</b> <b>at</b> their home in Inglewood. Tina Turner, meanwhile, had looked inward to alleviate her own problems and soon found solace after a friend introduced her to the teachings of Buddhism. In July 1976, Ike intended on signing a five-year contract with a new record company, Cream Records, for a reported yearly amount of $150,000. The contract had a key person clause, meaning Ike would have to sign the contract in four days, keeping Tina tied to Ike for five more years.|$|E

The campaign was designed to raise sufficient funds, $85,000, to avoid pushing back the title from the planned mid-2015 release, and would be aided, if its goal is met, by personal loans and funding from the Indie Fund. The Kickstarter was successful, raising more than $100,000 from nearly 3,700 backers, and through it, several funders shared with the Greens their own photos and stories of their losses of <b>their</b> <b>children</b> <b>at</b> young ages due to incurable or inoperable maladies, which will be included within the game.|$|E
25|$|The Uyghurs {{are one of}} the 56 {{recognized}} {{ethnic groups}} in China, and Uyghur is an official language of Xinjiang Uyghur Autonomous Region, along with Standard Chinese. As a result, Uyghur can be heard in most social domains in Xinjiang, and also in schools, government and courts. Of the other ethnic minorities in Xinjiang, those populous enough to have their own autonomous prefectures, such as the Kazakhs and the Kyrgyz, have access to schools and government services in their native language. Smaller minorities, however, do not have a choice and must attend Uyghur-medium schools. These include the Xibe, Tajiks, Daurs, and Russians. In some instances Uyghur parents decide to enroll <b>their</b> <b>children</b> <b>at</b> Mandarin schools over Uyghur schools because of the better quality education offered, leading to many Uyghur children having more trouble learning their native language over Mandarin. However, in 2017, Xinjiang's Hotan government have issued a directive completely banning the use of the Uyghur language at all education levels up to and including secondary school.|$|E
25|$|By {{the time}} he was {{nineteen}} years old in 1871 he was living with his parents in Havelock Road and articled to an attorney. He became a partner in the firm sometime after 1873. By 1881 at age twenty-nine he was describing himself as a timber merchant like his father, and living with his parents at Priory Mount in Cambridge Gardens, Hastings. He continued under the same company name after his father retired in 1882 and the original firm was dissolved. He married Mrs Lilla Harford (b. Barnstaple ca.1856; d. Wandsworth 1930) of Cambridge Gardens, Hastings on 7 June 1882, when his employees received a half-day holiday, an afternoon of entertainment at Field's Farm, Ore and an evening dinner at the Grand Hotel in Queens Road, Hastings. Around a hundred of the men took advantage of this. By 1991 the family was living at Rothesay, Clive Road, Hastings, with five of their children: Cecil, Gladys, Reginald, Mabel and Herbert. They had seven servants living in: a housekeeper, parlourmaid, cook, housemaid, under-nurse, coachman and gardener. The 1901 Census finds John Howell Junior as a solicitor still living with his wife, his stepson Hugh Cardinal Harford (b. Middlesex ca.1877) and five of <b>their</b> <b>children</b> <b>at</b> Rothesay. His eldest son Cecil was at that time a commercial clerk living at a boarding house in Rochester, Kent. John Howell Junior died aged 52 years on 13 December 1903 in his home at 20 Holmesdale Gardens which he had built with his father soon after joining the firm. He left £53,352 in his will.|$|E

40|$|Objective: To {{identify}} {{the perceptions of}} parents of children who died from cancer regarding the palliative and supportive care they received in hospital and in community settings. Method: Face-to-face or telephone questionnaires. Setting Tertiary paediatric oncology centres in Western Australia, New South Wales, Queensland and Victoria. Participants: 69 parents. Results: Parents indicated the need for clear and honest information about <b>their</b> <b>child’s</b> condition and prognosis throughout the trajectory of illness. Parents also required access to, and advice from, multidisciplinary health professionals when caring for <b>their</b> <b>child</b> <b>at</b> home. Parents preferred to care for <b>their</b> <b>child</b> <b>at</b> home wherever possible throughout the palliative care trajectory of <b>their</b> <b>child’s</b> cancer and were well supported by immediate and extended family and friends. However, many families were affected emotionally and financially by the burden of caring for <b>their</b> <b>child</b> with incurable cancer. Families required financial and practical assistance with providing care from <b>their</b> <b>child.</b> Parents wanted and needed more practical resources and information {{to assist with the}} management of <b>their</b> <b>child’s</b> nutrition and pain, {{as well as for the}} support of <b>their</b> other <b>children.</b> Conclusion: Care for <b>children</b> and <b>their</b> families should be coordinated by a multidisciplinary team in consultation with <b>children</b> and <b>their</b> families, and should be linked and integrated with the treating hospital in collaboration with community services...|$|R
