5000|$|Hyperthyroidism {{occurs in}} about 0.2-0.4% of all pregnancies. Most cases {{are due to}} Graves’ disease {{although}} less common causes (e.g. toxic nodules and thyroiditis) may be seen. [...] Clinical assessment alone may occasionally be inadequate in differentiating hyperthyroidism from the hyperdynamic state of pregnancy. Distinctive clinical features of Graves’ disease include the presence of ophthalmopathy, diffuse goitre and pretibial myxoedema. Also, hyperthyroidism must be distinguished from gestational transient thyrotoxicosis, a self-limiting hyperthyroid state due to the <b>thyroid</b> <b>stimulatory</b> effects of beta-hCG [...] This distinction is important since the latter condition is typically mild and will not usually require specific antithyroid treatment. Red cell zinc may also be useful in differentiating the two. Hyperthyroidism due to Graves’ disease may worsen in the first trimester of pregnancy, remit in later pregnancy, and subsequently relapse in the postpartum.|$|R
40|$|Myxedema {{crisis is}} a {{life-threatening}} extreme form of hypothyroidism {{with a high}} mortality rate if left untreated. Myxedema crisis is commonly seen in older patients, especially in women, and is associated with signs of hypothyroidism, hypothermia, hyponatraemia, hypercarbia, and hypoxemia. Patients might present with different organ specific symptoms. Seizures are a recognized but rare manifestation of myxedema with a very high mortality rate. Prompt diagnosis and appropriate management may improve the prognosis. Many contributory factors may involve development of seizures in a patient with myxedema. Hyponatraemia is one such cause, which is seen in moderate-severe form {{in the background of}} myxedema. We report an elderly male who presented with generalized tonic clonic seizure preceded by memory impairment and drowsiness. He had moderate hyponatraemia and very high <b>thyroid</b> <b>stimulatory</b> hormone levels in association with low free thyroxin levels. Diagnosis of myxedema crisis was made and patient was successfully treated with sodium correction and thyroid hormone replacement...|$|R
40|$|Graves’ {{disease is}} {{characterized}} by thyroid hyperfunction and hyperplasia which lead to thyrotoxicosis and goiter. Hyperthyroidism has been clearly related to the presence in plasma of immunoglobulins which stimulate the TSH receptor via its adenylate cyclase, the <b>thyroid</b> <b>stimulatory</b> immunoglobulins (TSI) (1 – 4). With regard to growth, several facts have suggested that additional mechanisms may be involved. There is no simple relationship between level of function in Graves’ disease and goiter size; indeed there are cases of hyperthyroidism with little increase in thyroid size and others with slight thyrotoxicosis and large goiters. Moreover, the presence of circulating growth-stimulating factors in euthyroid and hypothyroid patients with goiter has been reported (5 – 10). On the other hand, depending on the species, several biochemical pathways {{may be involved in}} the regulation of thyroid cell proliferation: 1) the TSH-activated adenylate cyclase-cAMP cascade (11 – 13); 2) the cAMP-independent epidermal growth factor mechanism, probably involving protein tyrosine phosphorylation (11, 13); and 3) as in other types of cells, the phosphatidylinositol-Ca 2 + cascade (14). It is, therefore, quite conceivable that some factors may activate growth of thyroid cells without influencing the rate of hormone synthesis and secretion. It should be pointed out, however, that in a careful study, Jin et al. (15) have been unable to dissociate the cAMP and the proliferative response to TSI in a rat thyroid cell line (FRTL 5). © 1987 by The Endocrine Society.

40|$|BackgroundHyperthyroidism relapse in Graves disease after {{antithyroid drug}} (ATD) {{withdrawal}} is common; however, measuring the thyrotropin receptor antibody (TRAb) at ATD withdrawal {{in order to}} predict outcomes is controversial. This study compared measurement of <b>thyroid</b> <b>stimulatory</b> antibody (TSAb) and thyrotropin-binding inhibitory immunoglobulin (TBII) at ATD withdrawal to predict relapse. MethodsThis retrospective study enrolled patients with Graves disease who were treated with ATDs and whose serum thyroid-stimulating hormone levels were normal after receiving low-dose ATDs. ATD therapy was stopped irrespective of TRAb positivity after an additional 6 months of receiving the minimum dose of ATD therapy. Patients were followed using thyroid function tests and TSAb (TSAb group; n= 35) or TBII (TBII group; n= 39) every 3 to 6 months for 2 years after ATD withdrawal. ResultsTwenty-eight patients (38 %) relapsed for a median follow-up of 21 months, {{and there were no}} differences in baseline clinical characteristics between groups. In the TSAb group, relapse was more common in patients with positive TSAb at ATD withdrawal (67 %) than patients with negative TSAb (17 %; P= 0. 007). Relapse-free survival was shorter in TSAb-positive patients. In the TBII group, there were no differences in the relapse rate and relapse-free survivals according to TBII positivity. For predicting Graves disease relapse, the sensitivity and specificity of TSAb were 63 % and 83 %, respectively, whereas those of TBII were 28 % and 65 %. ConclusionTSAb at ATD withdrawal can predict the relapse of Graves hyperthyroidism, but TBII cannot. Measuring TSAb at ATD withdrawal can assist with clinical decisions making for patients with Graves disease...|$|R
40|$|A double {{antibody}} radioimmunoassay {{has been}} developed to measure thyroglobulin in rat (RTg) serum. The lowest detectable quantity measurable was 5. 0 ng/ml. Specificity was documented by: (a) fall in serum RTg to undetectable levels after thyroid ablation; (b) the fact that L-thyroxine, D-thyroxine, L-triiodothyronine, D-triiodothyronine, triiodothyroacetic acid, tetraiodothyroacetic acid, triiodothyropropionic acid, moniodotyrosine, diiodotyrosine, and human thyroglobulin (HTg) in concentrations up to 40, 000 ng per tube did not cross-react in the assay; (c) the demonstration that constant levels of serum RTg were observed while varying amounts of serum (criterion of parallelism) were introduced in the assay. The mean RTg concentration in tail vein blood of adult Sprague-Dawley rats were 101. 5 +/- 13. 0 ng/ml (SEM) (n= 21); values ranged from 12. 0 to 258. 0 ng/ml. Chronic administration of a high-iodine diet (HID) did not affect serum thyroglobulin levels. Chronic administration of a low-iodine diet (LID) and propylthiouracil (PTU) led to a statistically significant increase in serum RTg that {{was accompanied by a}} significant rise in serum thyrotropin (rTSH). Serum thyroxine (T 4) administered to normal rats for 14 days (20 mug/day subcutaneously) depressed serum RTg concentration from a mean level of 119. 4 +/- 17. 5 ng/ml (n= 19) to a mean of 35. 0 +/- 0. 27 ng/ml (n= 19) (P less than 0. 001). While rats were on continuous T 4 suppression, bovine thyroid-stimulating hormone (bTSH) given intravenously (2 IU) resulted in a mean maximal increment of RTg of 332. 0 +/- 81. 5 ng/ml (n= 6) at 24 h. IgC-(LATS) long-acting <b>thyroid</b> <b>stimulatory</b> injected intravenously resulted in a mean maximal increment of RTg concentration at 96 h of 87. 2 +/- 14. 3 ng/ml (n= 5).

40|$|We {{examined}} the relative effects of thyrotropin (TSH) and TSH receptor autoantibodies in the sera {{of patients with}} autoimmune thyroid disease on three TSH-lutropin/chorionic gonadotropin (LH/CG) receptor extracellular domain chimeras. Each chimera binds TSH with high affinity. Only the chimera with TSH receptor extracellular domains ABC (amino acids 1 - 260) had a functional (cAMP) response to <b>thyroid</b> <b>stimulatory</b> IgG. The chimeras with TSH receptor domains CD (amino acids 171 - 360) and DE (amino acids 261 - 418) were unresponsive. The lack of response of the chimera with TSH receptor domains DE was anticipated because it fails to transduce a signal with TSH stimulation, unlike the other two chimeras. A different spectrum of responses occurred when the TSH-LH/CG chimeras were examined in terms of autoantibody competition for TSH binding. IgG with TSH binding-inhibitory activity when tested with the wild-type TSH receptor also inhibited TSH binding to the chimera with TSH receptor domains DE. Dramatically, however, these IgG did not inhibit TSH binding to the chimera with TSH receptor domains CD, and had weak or absent activity with the chimera with TSH receptor domains ABC. Chimeras with TSH receptor domains ABC and DE were equally effective in affinity-purifying IgG with thyroid-stimulatory and TSH binding-inhibitory activities. Nonstimulatory IgG with TSH binding-inhibitory activity inhibited the action of stimulatory IgG on the wild-type TSH receptor, {{but not with the}} chimera containing TSH receptor domains ABC. In summary, TSH receptor autoantibodies and TSH bind to regions in both domains ABC and DE of the TSH receptor extracellular region. Stimulatory and inhibitory TSH receptor autoantibodies, as well as TSH, appear to bind to different sites in domains ABC, but similar sites in domains DE, of the receptor. Alternatively, TSH and the different TSH receptor antibodies bind with differing affinities to the same site in the ABC region...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this work}} was to {{investigate}} {{some aspects of the}} thyroid epithelial cell kinetics during the iodide-induced involution of a hyperplastic goitre in the rat. Rats were made iodine-deficient for 6 months, and propylthiouracil (PTU) (0. 15 %) was added to the diet during the last 2 months. Thereafter, rats were refed with iodide and PTU was removed (day 0). Forty-eight hours previously, all the rats were injected with tritiated thymidine ([3 H]TdR) (1 microCi/g). Some animals were killed 1 hr or 24 hr after [3 H]TdR injection (i. e. on day - 2 and - 1, day 0 corresponding to the restoration of a normal iodine diet); the other animals were killed after different delay periods and following [3 H]TdR injection. Autoradiography of thyroid sections, iodine determination of plasma iodide and protein-bound iodine (PBI), and RIA of plasma <b>thyroid</b> <b>stimulatory</b> hormone (TSH) were performed. Plasma TSH concentration was very high on day 0 of iodide refeeding (3000 +/- 330 ng/ml) and remained at this level until day 8. Plasma PBI was very low on day 0, remained so until day 4 and greatly increased on day 8. Plasma iodide was also very low on day 0, but markedly increased on day 1, then did not vary significantly until day 43 of iodine refeeding. Thyroid weight, elevated on day 0, decreased relatively quickly until day 30, then more slowly until day 73. The [3 H]TdR labelling index (LI) of the thyroid epithelial cells (TEC) was high on day 0 (56 +/- 3 labelled cells/ 10, 000 cells), and 24 hr thereafter increased to 104 +/- 3, by division of the labelled cells. On day 1 of iodine refeeding, the LI had abruptly decreased to about half this value and then remained stable for 3 more days. Between day 4 and day 16, a progressive decline in the LI, (by about 3 - 4 per day), was observed. The LI showed no further modification, up to day 73, the longest period investigated. The decrease in LI occurred without any significant changes in the labelling intensity (grain count) of the remaining labelled cells between day 1 and 16, this indicates that no cell division took place during this period. The data are therefore interpreted as showing a biphasic elimination after iodide refeeding, of cells that were actively proliferating during the goitrous state.

40|$|The {{differential}} proteomic approach (2 D gel analysis {{coupled to}} MALDI-MS analysis) of nuclear proteins {{can provide an}} extremely useful tool to understand control of cell proliferation and differentiation. In order to identify possible markers of dedifferentiation between normal and cancerous thyroid cells, we used a differential proteomics approach by comparing nuclear extracts from the normal rat thyroid cell line FRTL- 5 and the completely undifferentiated Ki-mol cell line, obtained by transformation with the Ki-ras oncogene. Galectin- 3 (Gal- 3) was identified as highly expressed, in the nuclear compartment, only in the transformed cell line. By using different human cancer cell lines, we showed that Gal- 3 is maximally expressed in nuclei of papillary cancer cells. We focused on the functional relationship existing between Gal- 3 and the thyroid-specific transcription factor TTF- 1, whose expression is maintained in papillary cancer where it {{can contribute to the}} proliferating status. By using gel-retardation and transient tranfection assays, we demonstrate that Gal- 3 upregulates the TTF- 1 transcriptional activity. GST-pulldown experiments demonstrate the occurrence of interaction between Gal- 3 and TTF- 1 homeodomain. Since several lines of evidence suggest a role for Gal- 3 in controlling proliferation and tumor progression in <b>thyroid</b> cancer, the <b>stimulatory</b> activity played by Gal- 3 over TTF- 1 would account for a possible molecular mechanism through which the galectin controls proliferation in thyroid cell...|$|R
40|$|Objective/Background: To {{discuss a}} unique {{clinical}} entity where inappropriate activity of inhibitory and <b>stimulatory</b> <b>thyroid</b> antibodies resulted in alternating hypothyroidism and hyperthyroidism. Methods: We report the clinical history, laboratory data, and results of imaging studies, {{along with the}} pathophysiological mechanism and the subsequent treatment in a patient with fluctuating thyroid functional status. Results: A 52 -year-old female was treated for hypothyroidism {{for more than two}} decades. She started having symptoms of hyperthyroidism along with a suppressed thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH). She continued to have persistent symptoms despite stopping her levothyroxine. Her free T 3 and T 4 were elevated along with an increased radioactive uptake scan. She was diagnosed with Graves’ disease and started on methimazole, which relieved her symptoms for a few months. Subsequently, her TSH began to rise beyond expected level, her hypothyroid symptoms reappeared, and methimazole was discontinued. Following this, she again developed symptoms of hyperthyroidism and thyroid values revealed an undetectable TSH. She had at least two such documented cycles of hyperthyroidism alternating with hypothyroidism. She was eventually treated with radioactive iodine ablation followed by levothyroxine replacement. Swinging dominance of TSH-blocking autoantibodies (TBAb) and thyroid-stimulating autoantibodies (TSAb) triggered by methimazole and levothyroxine, respectively, is likely the underlying mechanism. Conclusions: Physicians should be vigilant to the phenomenon of spontaneous conversion of hypothyroidism to hyperthyroidism, or vice versa, in a subset of patients with autoimmune thyroid disease. Repeated assessment of thyroid function along with measurement of TBAb and TSAb are invaluable in identifying this rare clinical entity...|$|R
40|$|Aims]: The sodium–iodide symporter (NIS) mediates the uptake of I− by {{the thyroid}} {{follicular}} cell and {{is essential for}} thyroid hormone biosynthesis. Nis expression is stimulated by thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) and also requires paired box 8 (Pax 8) to bind to its promoter. Pax 8 binding activity depends on its redox state by a mechanism involving thioredoxin/thioredoxin reductase- 1 (Txn/TxnRd 1) reduction of apurinic/apyrimidinic endonuclease 1 (Ape 1). In this study, we investigate the role of Se in Nis expression. [Results]: Selenium increases TSH-induced Nis expression and activity in rat <b>thyroid</b> cells. The <b>stimulatory</b> effect of Se occurs {{at the transcriptional level}} and is only observed for Nis promoters containing a Pax 8 binding site in the Nis upstream enhancer, suggesting that Pax 8 is involved in this effect. In fact, Se increases Pax 8 expression and its DNA-binding capacity, and in Pax 8 -silenced rat thyroid cells, Nis is not Se responsive. By inhibiting Ape 1 and TxnRd 1 functions, we found that both enzymes are crucial for TSH and TSH plus Se stimulation of Pax 8 activity and mediate the Nis response to Se treatment. [Innovation]: We describe that Se increases Nis expression and activity. We demonstrate that this effect is dependent on the redox functions of Ape 1 and Txn/TxnRd 1 through control of the DNA binding activity of Pax 8. [Conclusion]: Nis expression is controlled by Txn/Ape 1 through a TSH/Se-dependent mechanism.

40|$|The {{glycoprotein}} hormones, Luteinizing Hormone (LH), human Chorionic Gonadotropin (hCG), Follicle Stimulating Hormone (FSH) and Thyroid Stimulating Hormone (TSH) are heterodimeric proteins with {{an identical}} α-subunit associated non-covalently with the hormone specific β-subunit and play {{important roles in}} reproduction and overall physiology of the organism [1]. The receptors of these hormones belong {{to the family of}} G-protein coupled receptors (GPCR) and have a large extracellular domain (ECD) comprising of 9 - 10 leucine rich repeats (LRR) followed by a flexible hinge region, a seven helical transmembrane domain (TMD) and a C terminal cytoplasmic tail [2]. Despite significant sequence and structural homologies observed between the ECDs of the receptors and the specific β-subunits of the hormones, the hormone-receptor pairs exhibit exquisite specificity with very low cross-reactivity {{with other members of the}} family. The TSH receptor (TSHR) is an especially interesting member of this family as it not only recognizes is cognate ligand, i. e. TSH, but also binds to the non-cognate ligands such as autoantibodies. TSHR autoantibodies come in different flavors; inhibitory antibodies that compete with the hormone for receptor binding and block its action, stimulatory antibodies that activate the receptor in a hormone independent manner and neutral antibodies that bind to the receptor but do not directly influence its functions. The inhibitory autoantibodies cause hypothyroidism and are responsible for Hashimoto’s Thyroiditis, whereas the stimulatory autoantibodies cause Graves’ thyrotoxicosis characterized by hyperthyroid condition [3]. The exact epitopes of these autoantibodies are not well delineated although it has been hypothesized that the blocking type- and the stimulatory type- autoantibodies have predominant epitopes in the TSHR ECD that overlap with hormone binding regions [4]. Insights into the mode of hormone or autoantibody binding to the receptor was primarily derived from the crystal structure of FSHR leucine rich repeat domain (LRRD) bound to single chain analog of FSH, and the crystal structures of TSHR LRRD bound to the stimulatory type human monoclonal antibody M 22 [5] and the inhibitory type- monoclonal antibody K 1 - 70 [6]. Both these crystal structures propose LRRDs as the primary ligand binding site which interacts with the hormone through its determinant loop in a hand-clasp fashion [7] while the autoantibodies mimics the hormone binding to a large extent [8]. These structures, while providing detailed understanding of the molecular interactions of the LRRs with the hormone, shed little light on the mechanism by which the signal generated at the LRRD are transduced to the downstream effector regions at the distally situated TMD. Hence, while one understands the ligand binding to a large extent, the activation process is not well understood, one of the central objective of the present study. Ligand-receptor interactions are typically studied by perturbing ligand/receptor structure by mutagenesis or by mapping conformational changes by biophysical or computational approaches. In addition to the above-mentioned approaches, the present work also uses highly specific antibodies against different domains of the receptor as molecular probes due to the ability of antibodies to distinguish between conformations likely to arise during the activation process. Use of antibodies to understand the receptor activation process is especially apt for TSHR due to the presence of physiologically relevant TSHR autoantibodies and their ability to influence hormone binding and receptor activation [9, 10]. Chapter 2 attempts to provide a comparison between the interactions of the hormone and the autoantibodies with TSHR. For this purpose, two assays were developed for identification of TSHR autoantibodies in the sera of patients suffering from autoimmune thyroid diseases (AITD), the first assay is based on the ability of TSHR autoantibodies to compete for radiolabeled hormone (The TSH binding inhibition (TBI), assay) and the second based on the capability of stimulatory antibody to produce cAMP in cells expressing TSHR (TSHR <b>stimulatory</b> <b>immunoglobin</b> (TSI) assay). A stable cell line expressing TSHR capable of recognizing both TSH and TSHR autoantibodies was thus created and used for prospective and retrospective analysis of AITD patients. Based on the TBI and TSI profiles of IgGs, purified from AITD patient's sera, it was recognized that TSHR stimulatory and TSH binding inhibitory effects of these antibodies correlated well, indicating overlap between hormone binding and IgG binding epitopes. It was also recognized that stimulatory IgGs are not affected by negative regulatory mechanism that governs TSH secretion substantiating the persistence of these antibodies in circulation. Kinetics of cAMP production by Graves’ stimulatory IgG was found to be fundamentally distinct, where the autoantibodies displayed pronounce hysteresis during the onset of the activation process when compared to the hormone. This could possibly be explained by the oligoclonality of the autoantibody population, a different mechanism of receptor activation or dissimilarity in autoantibody and hormone epitopes. To gain additional insights into the epitopes of TSHR autoantibodies and the regions that might be critical in the activation process, different overlapping fragments encompassing the entire TSH receptor ECD were cloned, expressed in E. coli as GST fusion proteins and purified: 1] the first three LRRs (TLRR 1 - 3, amino acid (aa) 21 - 127), 2] the first six LRRs (TLRR 1 - 6, aa 21 - 200), 3] the putative major hormone binding domain (TLRR 4 - 6, aa 128 - 200), and 4] the hinge region of TSH receptor along with LRR 7 to 9, (TLRR 7 -HinR, aa 201 - 413). The receptor fragment TLRR 7 -HinR was further subdivided into LRR 7 - 9 (TLRR 7 - 9, aa 201 - 161) and the hinge region (TSHR HinR, aa 261 - 413), expressed as N-terminal His-Tagged protein and purified using IMAC chromatography. Simultaneously, the full-length TSHR ECD was cloned, expressed and purified using the Pichia pastoris expression system. ELISA or immunoblot analysis of autoantibodies with the TSHR exodomain fragments suggested that Graves’ stimulatory antibody epitopes were distributed throughout the ECD with LRR 4 - 9 being the predominant site of binding. Interestingly, experiments involving neutralization of Graves’ IgG stimulated cAMP response by different receptor fragment indicated that fragments corresponding to the TSHR hinge region were better inhibitors of autoantibody stimulated receptor response than corresponding LRR fragments, suggesting that the hinge region might be an important component of the receptor activation process. This was in contrast to prevalent beliefs that considered the hinge region to be an inert linker connecting the LRRs to the TMD, a structural entity without any known functional significance. Mutagenesis in TSHR hinge region and agonistic antibodies against FSHR and LHR hinge regions, reported by the laboratory, recognized the importance of the hinge regions as critical for receptor activation and may not simply be a scaffold [11 - 13]. Unfortunately, the mechanism by which the hinge region regulates binding or response or both have not been well understood partially due to unavailability of structural information about this region. In addition poor sequence similarity within the GpHR family and within proteins of known structure, make this region difficult to model structurally. In chapter 3, effort is made to model the hinge regions of the three GpHR based on the knowledge driven and Ab initio protocols. An assembled structure comprising of the LRR domain (derived from the known structures of FSHR and TSHR LRR domains) and the modeled hinge region and transmembrane domain presents interesting differences between the three receptors, especially in the manner the hormone bound LRRD is oriented towards the TMD. These models also suggested that the α-subunit interactions in these three receptors are fundamentally different and this was verified by investigating the effects of two α-subunit specific MAbs C 10 / 2 A 6 on hCG-LHR and hTSH-TSHR interactions. These two α-subunit MAbs had inverse effects on binding of hormone to the receptor. MAb C 10 inhibited TSH binding to TSHR but not that of hCG, whereas MAb 2 A 6 inhibited binding of hCG to LHR but not of hTSH. Investigation into the accessibility of their epitopes in a preformed hormone receptor complex indicated that the α-subunit may become buried or undergo conformational change during the activation process and interaction may be different for LHR and TSHR. Fundamental differences in TSHR and LHR were further investigated in the next chapter (Chapter 4), especially with regards to the ligand independent receptor activation. Polyclonal antibodies were developed against LRR 1 - 6, TLRR 7 -HinR and the TSHR HinR receptor fragments. The LRR 1 - 6 antibodies were potent inhibitor of receptor binding as well as response, similar to that observed with antibodies against the corresponding regions of LHR. Interestingly, the antibodies against the hinge region of TSHR were unable to inhibit hTSH binding, but were effective inhibitors of cAMP production suggesting that this region may be involved in a later stage of a multi-step activation process. This was also verified by studying the mechanism of inhibition of receptor response and their effect on ligand-receptor association and dissociation kinetics. Hinge region-specific antibodies immunopurified from TLRR 7 -HinR antibodies behaved akin to those of the pure hinge region antibodies providing independent validation of the above results. This result was, however, in contrast to those observed with a similar antibody against LHR hinge region. As compared to the TSHR antibody, the LHR antibody inhibited both hormone binding and response. In addition,|$|R
