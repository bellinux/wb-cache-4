25|$|Despite {{it being}} {{increasingly}} {{clear to the}} organizers of the project that it would never be finished in time <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>difference</b> <b>in</b> the war, the construction of Weingut I was approved on a 6-month time-line. Of a total of 10,000 workers who worked on the project, 8,500 were forced laborers and inmates of the Mühldorf concentration camp network. Of these more than 3,000 would die of overwork, underfeeding, and SS brutality. By the war's end, only 7 of the planned total of 12 bunker sections had been built, and construction of the factory itself had not begun.|$|E

Three of the sightings are supported by video footage of birds with flights, behaviors, field marks, and other characteristics that {{do not seem to be}} consistent with any species of the region other than the ivory-billed woodpecker.

2500|$|The Gates of Heaven {{and several}} of her albums in those years {{reflected}} an optimistic atmosphere in Japan caused by the asset price bubble {{around the end of}} the 1980s and early 1990s. She was often called [...] "Charisma of Youth" [...] or [...] "The Enthusiastic Leader of Love" [...] in those days. After hearing from her record company Toshiba-EMI that single sales were quickly overtaking album sales due to a slowing economy, Matsutoya decided <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>difference.</b> <b>In</b> order to make people buy the album, she did not release any physical singles at all for about four years in the early 1990s, although she did promote songs from her albums to radio as [...] "album cuts".

During his activist outings, Mraz wrote and recorded his fourth album, Love Is a Four Letter Word, with producer Joe Chiccarelli. In an interview for Billboard, he confessed that he was less interested in following up his biggest hit than using the power that [...] "I'm Yours" [...] gave him to fuel positive change.

2500|$|The first {{production}} meeting between U2 and their creative {{team for the}} Innocence + Experience Tour was held in March 2013. Although Songs of Innocence was still in progress {{at the time and}} did not yet have a title, the autobiographical narrative that would characterise the album was already a driving idea for their tour. The band wanted {{to tell the story of}} their adolescence in Dublin in the 1970s and how they were [...] "trying to figure out how they fit into the often violent and disrupted world outside" [...] their homes. The manifesto for the tour was summarized by two phrases: [...] "I can't change the world, but I can change the world in me", and [...] "I can the change the world, but I can't change the world in me." [...] The first is a lyric from the band's 1981 song [...] "Rejoice" [...] and represents the mindset of a teenage Bono feeling powerless <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> <b>difference</b> <b>in</b> a world plagued by the Troubles, who instead views personal psychological changes as a possibility; the second phrase represents the modern-day realization that the same person could make a difference in the world through philanthropic efforts but still struggle with the complexities of internal change. Devlin said, [...] "The space between these two statements is the territory of the album and of the show." [...] The band intended to stage shows in pairs and alternate the setlist between [...] "innocence" [...] and [...] "experience" [...] motifs night to night. Williams said, [...] "The artfulness in this tour is in the ideas, not the hardware".|$|E
