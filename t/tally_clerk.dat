50|$|By {{the end of}} {{the year}} on Tuesday, December 1, 1887, by order of President Charles Moran, a {{reduction}} of wages and salaries of employees went into effect, owing to the hard times and the critical condition There were 250 laborers at the pier at Piermont, handling freight. They were divided into night and day gangs, and were known as laborers, checkers, <b>tally</b> <b>clerks,</b> porters, and stowers. Their pay had been $1 per day.

6000|$|... "Oh, he didn't invent it. He {{was born}} to it, in Bethnal Green, as it came out during the proceedings. He was {{in the habit of}} {{alluding}} to his Scotch connections. But every great man has done that. The mother, I believe, was Scotch, right enough. The father de Barral whatever his origins retired from the Customs Service (tide-waiter I think), and started lending money in a very, very small way in the East-End to people connected with the docks, stevedores, minor barge-owners, ship-chandlers, <b>tally</b> <b>clerks,</b> all sorts of very small fry. He made his living at it. He was a very decent man I believe. He had enough influence to place his only son as junior clerk in the account department of one of the Dock Companies. `Now, my boy,' he said to him, `I've given you a fine start.' But de Barral didn't start. He stuck. He gave perfect satisfaction. At the end of three years he got a small rise of salary and went out courting in the evenings. He went courting the daughter of an old sea-captain who was a churchwarden of his parish and lived in an old badly preserved Georgian house with a garden: one of these houses standing in a reduced bit of `grounds' that you discover in a labyrinth of the most sordid streets, exactly alike and composed of six-roomed hutches." ...|$|R
60|$|Some of {{them were}} like Royal Academicians of a certain kind. They never startled you by a touch of originality, by a fresh audacity of inspiration. They were safe, very safe. They went about solemnly in the {{assurance}} of their consecrated and empty reputation. Names are odious, but I remember one of them {{who might have been}} their very president, the P.R.A. of the sea-craft. His weather-beaten and handsome face, his portly presence, his shirt- fronts and broad cuffs and gold links, his air of bluff distinction, impressed the humble beholders (stevedores, <b>tally</b> <b>clerks,</b> tide-waiters) as he walked ashore over the gangway of his ship lying at the Circular Quay in Sydney. His voice was deep, hearty, and authoritative--the voice of a very prince amongst sailors. He did everything with an air which put your attention on the alert and raised your expectations, but the result somehow was always on stereotyped lines, unsuggestive, empty of any lesson that one could lay to heart. He kept his ship in apple-pie order, which would have been seamanlike enough but for a finicking touch in its details. His officers affected a superiority over the rest of us, but the boredom of their souls appeared in their manner of dreary submission to the fads of their commander. It was only his apprenticed boys whose irrepressible spirits were not affected by the solemn and respectable mediocrity of that artist. There were four of these youngsters: one the son of a doctor, another of a colonel, the third of a jeweller; the name of the fourth was Twentyman, and this is all I remember of his parentage. But not one of them seemed to possess the smallest spark of gratitude in his composition. Though their commander was a kind man in his way, and had made a point of introducing them to the best people in the town in order that they should not fall into the bad company of boys belonging to other ships, I regret to say that they made faces at him behind his back, and imitated the dignified carriage of his head without any concealment whatever.|$|R

5000|$|In Burma, {{he found}} work in Rangoon as a <b>tally</b> <b>clerk</b> in a logging firm before {{becoming}} {{interested in the}} Burmese Buddhism he saw practised all around him. Around 1884, he took ordination as a novice monk under the name Dhammaloka. Fully ordained sometime prior to 1899, he began work as a teacher (probably in the Tavoy monastery in Rangoon).

[...] He completed his Bachelor of Laws in 1896 and a Master of Laws in 1898. He was called to the Victorian Bar in 1896 but continued working for the State Government rather than practice in his own right.|$|E
50|$|A party vote is {{the most}} common method, and occurs for non-{{conscience}} issues and some conscience issues. In this method, the Clerk of the House reads out each party's name in order of the number of seats each party has, starting with the largest party, followed by any independent members and any members wishing to cross the floor. A member of the party (usually a whip) will respond to their party's name by stating how many members of the party are in favour or opposed. The <b>Clerk</b> <b>tallies</b> up the votes and gives the results to the Speaker, who declares the result. A split party vote is a variation of the party vote, used for some conscience issues. The main difference is voting members state how many members of their party are in favour and how many members are opposed, and once the voting is completed, must table a list {{of the members of the}} party and how they voted.|$|R
50|$|Gray {{was born}} in Upper Stratton, Wiltshire, England, to Wilmott (née Barnett) and George Gray. He left school {{at the age of}} 14, and was apprenticed to a baker and {{confectioner}} in Swindon. He was later employed in a bakery in Hull before finding work as a steward on a transatlantic ocean liner. Gray arrived in Australia in 1898, working his way over on a cargo boat and then getting a job at the smelting works in Port Pirie, South Australia. He moved the following year to Broken Hill, New South Wales, initially working in a timbermill and then opening a bakery and catering business. Gray moved again in 1910, to Western Australia, and for eight years farmed near Tambellup. He then moved to Fremantle, becoming a <b>tally</b> <b>clerk</b> on the Fremantle Wharf.|$|E
50|$|Williams {{was born}} in Perth, to Eliza Ann (née Harvey) and David Guthrie. He enlisted in the Australian Imperial Force in 1915, and during the war served as a private in the 16th and 48th Battalions. He was wounded in action in France in 1917, losing a leg. After the war's end, Guthrie worked as a <b>tally</b> <b>clerk</b> on the Bunbury wharf. He {{was elected to the}} Bunbury Road Board in June 1934, and served until its {{abolition}} in March 1950, including as chairman for twelve years. Guthrie was elected to parliament at the 1950 state election, reclaiming the seat of Bunbury for the Labor Party from the Liberal Party's James Murray. He was re-elected unopposed at the 1953 election, but died in office in September 1955. The resulting by-election was won by the Liberal candidate, George Roberts.|$|E
5000|$|The need {{to extend}} the area of land under lease was {{determined}} by the need to provide accommodation for employees. The development of small self-contained [...] "timber towns" [...] in relatively remote locations occurred throughout the Wide-Bay Burnett. Other examples existed at Wengenville, Manumbar and Eel Creek. At Elgin Vale, two houses for the manager and <b>tally</b> <b>clerk,</b> a number of smaller family cottages, a boarding house, and barracks for single men were constructed. A small school was also built on the reserve, which remained in operation until 1977 (later adapted to a QCWA meeting room and regazetted to form a separate reserve). When a new set of barracks were later built (s), the earlier building was converted into a community hall, which became an important social space for the settlement. In 1961 two houses, seven cottages, a set of barrack's and community hall (in addition to the sawmill and detached office) were recorded on-site.|$|E
50|$|The representative's vote is then {{displayed}} in two summary panels above the press gallery seats {{and to the}} right and left of the speaker's dais. The panel shows the member's name and a light corresponding to how that member voted (green for yea, red for nay, and amber for present), keeps a running count of vote casts, and displays time remaining for a vote (most votes are held open for at least fifteen minutes). The system as used today is much the same as that used in the 1970s, although today, member's voting cards are magnetic stripe cards that contain identification information. Once a representative has voted, he or she may check the vote by reinserting the card and seeing which light is illuminated at the voting station. For the first ten minutes of a vote, a representative may also change his or her vote by reinsert the card to change the vote. If a representative wants to change his or her vote in the last five minutes of a fifteen-minute vote, the representative must use a teller card in the well of the House. A <b>tally</b> <b>clerk</b> then manually enters the vote into the electronic voting system.|$|E
5000|$|At {{the age of}} 22, {{finding his}} {{prospects}} in London dim, Hughes decided to emigrate to Australia. Taking advantage of an assisted-passage scheme offered by the Colony of Queensland, he arrived in Brisbane on 8 December 1884 after a two-month journey. On arrival, he gave his year of birth as 1864, a deception {{that would not be}} uncovered until after his death. Hughes attempted to find work with the Education Department, but was either not offered a position or found the terms of employment to be unsuitable. He spent the next two years as an itinerant labourer, working various odd jobs. In his memoirs, Hughes claimed to have worked variously as a fruitpicker, <b>tally</b> <b>clerk,</b> navvy, blacksmith's striker, station hand, drover, and saddler’s assistant, and to have travelled (mostly on foot) as far north as Rockhampton, as far west as Adavale, and as far south as Orange, New South Wales. He also claimed to served briefly in both the Queensland Defence Force and the Queensland Maritime Defence Force. Hughes' accounts are by their nature unverifiable, and his biographers have cast doubt on their veracity - Fitzhardinge states that they were embellished at best and at worst [...] "a world of pure fantasy".|$|E
