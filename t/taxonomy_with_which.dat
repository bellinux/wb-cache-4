In this paper we present the SSL problem in contrast with supervised and unsupervised learning. In addition, we propose a <b>taxonomy</b> <b>with</b> <b>which</b> we categorize many existing approaches described in the literature based on their underlying framework, data representation, and algorithmic class. ...|$|E
40|$|The full {{transformational}} {{effects of}} Social Media {{have yet to}} be understood. Alongside its heavily discussed benefits, a number of potentially harmful effects have become apparent lately. Phenomena such as still increasing information overload, cyber-bullying, or loss of identity have been described in recent research literature from various domains. By means of a literature review our paper aims at reviewing, cataloguing and classifying these psychological and social disorders that have been reported to be related to Social Media engagement. We distinguish between active participation in and mere exposure to Social Media. Using a psychopathological classification scheme, we structure the identified symptoms and syndromes, providing a common language and <b>taxonomy</b> <b>with</b> <b>which</b> the identified disorders can be described and classified accurately. Thus, we are laying out a foundation necessary for the research into and the understanding of the aetiology and eventually the means for the prevention of the negative effects of Social Media usage within individuals in information societies...|$|E
40|$|The {{revitalization}} {{of a language}} involves speakers making thousands of individual language choice decisions, with the pooled choices resulting in increased use of the language. Understanding individual language choice motivations is key to understanding and having some bearing on these individual language choice decisions. This paper first addresses the importance of motivations by providing a <b>taxonomy</b> <b>with</b> <b>which</b> to discuss and better understand language choice motivations. Back in 1985, John Edwards attributed language shift to “pragmatic decisions in which another variety is seen as {{more important for the}} future " (1985 : 71). Among his “pragmatic considerations ” are power, social access, and material advancement. He maintains {{that the only way to}} influence language shift (revitalize a language) is to alter the entire social fabric of the language community (1985 : 98). t This paper also addresses the importance of motivations in the sense of what leaders and members of a language community can do to modify the motivational fabric of their society in order to encourage language choice decisions that lean toward language revitalization. The key to language revitalization is motivations...|$|E
50|$|Enterprises have varying {{interest}} in the usage of taxonomies, from the usual enterprise information searches to the direct business benefits of taxonomies benefiting quicker and more accurate searches for the merchandise or the services of e-commerce or e-library sites. Such organisations may need to build large and complex vocabularies and deal with information assets that are largely in the public domain. Consequently, they are looking to shortcut their metadata schema development and avoid reinventing the wheel. Such shortcuts include the licensing of ready-built <b>taxonomies</b> and vocabularies <b>with</b> <b>which</b> to enhance their search results quickly.|$|R
