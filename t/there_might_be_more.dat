But then, when he sees the sword – <b>there</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>more</b> to his {{involvement}} than he originally thought… Starring Adrian Paul and Toby Longworth.

25|$|The normal {{constitution}} of the chapter of a secular cathedral church comprised four dignitaries (<b>there</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>more),</b> {{in addition to the}} canons. These are the dean, the precentor, the chancellor and the treasurer. These four dignitaries, occupying the four corner stalls in the choir, are called in many of the statutes the quatuor majores personae of the church.|$|E
25|$|The {{mainline}} railway stations at London Bridge, Waterloo East, Charing Cross and Cannon Street {{were also}} closed. The Home Secretary approved {{the deployment of}} a military counter terrorist unit from the Special Air Service (SAS). The helicopters carrying the SAS landed on London Bridge to support the Metropolitan Police because of concerns that <b>there</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>more</b> attackers at large.|$|E
60|$|Impatient as they were, {{however, the}} troops {{had to wait}} for two days before another {{movement}} was made. During this time supplies were hurried forward in large quantities, that <b>there</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> no <b>more</b> delays in the future.|$|R
6000|$|Mamie {{took it all}} in, though <b>there</b> <b>might</b> well <b>be</b> <b>more</b> of it {{than one}} could quickly embrace. [...] "But if she has had time," [...] she flashed, [...] "to find out he isn't one?" ...|$|R
60|$|Nevertheless, it was {{looked for}} again, {{and still not}} found. She entreated that <b>there</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> no <b>more</b> searching; {{but it was still}} sought for, in a {{desultory}} way, until she was quite well, and the company took their departure.|$|R
25|$|There is, moreover, {{significant}} political complexity to be treated, {{more than enough}} to complicate any consideration of individual culpability: it is imperative to note that some Social Democrats viewed the National Socialists {{as an alternative to the}} Christian Social Party and later Vaterländische Front in the context of reunification with Germany; for example, Karl Renner, a chancellor who served in both the First (1919–33) and Second (post-1945) Austrian Republics, favored a German Anschluss as an alternative to the then Austrofascist regime, under which Berg, Webern, and the Social Democrats suffered. And Webern's professional circle in Vienna included, besides many Jews, many Social Democrats; for example, for David Josef Bach, a close friend of Schoenberg's as well, Webern conducted many workers' and amateur ensembles. Under the Nazis, some Social Democrats expected, <b>there</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>more</b> work and protections for workers and laborers, as well as other social reforms and political stability, if not democracy; Webern may well have hoped to again be able to conduct and to be better able to secure a future for his family.|$|E
25|$|Along {{with the}} sealed orders were {{warnings}} of possible Spanish men {{of war in}} San Luis d'Apra, the main port of Guam, and notification of it being protected by a heavy battery of guns. The existence of the heavy armament was verified by reputable travelers who had visited the island within {{the two or three}} years before 1898. Definite information {{of the size of the}} Spanish garrison was not given, and in the absence of direct knowledge, the captain of the cruiser had to assume that <b>there</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>more</b> than a thousand fighting men on the island who were thoroughly familiar with the terrain. Glass held a conference on the Australia, and invited General Anderson, Commander William C. Gibson, naval officer in charge of the transports, and the captains of the three troop carriers were invited to participate in the discussions. Also present at the meeting was T. A. Hallet, third officer of the Australia and a former whaling captain, who had been to the Mariana Islands many times. Hallet told the group that on his last visit to Guam, San Luis d'Apra was strongly fortified. Fort Santa Cruz and the battery on Point Orote, he stated, were efficiently manned and equipped. After a complete appraisal of all the known and unknown factors in the impending battle, the officers completed the arrangements for the attack on Guam.|$|E
500|$|In 1975, the Columbia album The Basement Tapes was compiled, {{mainly by}} Robertson and {{engineer}} Rob Fraboni. Robertson and Fraboni put thirty-five {{of the songs}} onto composite reels of tape, and Heylin believes these represented {{a short list of}} candidates for the album. [...] "Santa-Fe" [...] was included on these composite reels, but was not ultimately chosen for the album. The Basement Tapes included sixteen Dylan songs recorded at Big Pink in 1967, as well as eight Band demos from various times and locations between 1967 and 1975. One Dylan song on the album, [...] "Goin' to Acapulco", had not appeared on his 1967 fourteen-song acetate or on bootlegs, and this alerted the world to the possibility that <b>there</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>more</b> Basement Tape songs in existence. In 1986, at least twenty-five previously unknown 1967 songs by Dylan and the Band passed into collectors' hands by way of a former roadie of the Band's. In the early 1990s, a third batch of songs, these ones from Garth Hudson's archives, came to light around the time Columbia was preparing The Bootleg Series Volumes 1–3; [...] "Santa-Fe" [...] comes from this group. In his liner notes for The Bootleg Series Volumes 1–3, John Bauldie commented on these second and third stages in which groups of Big Pink songs had come to light: [...] "Despite the... emergence [...] in collectors' circles of a further couple of hours of Basement Tapes, it seems as though there's a good deal left unheard. 'Santa-Fe' is just one example of a batch of previously unsuspected Basement tracks". By 1992, the [...] "Santa-Fe" [...] batch of songs had been obtained by bootleggers, and almost all known Dylan Basement Tape songs were assembled onto the 5-CD bootleg The Genuine Basement Tapes. [...] "Sante-Fe" [...] was also included on the 2014 compilations [...] and the latter album officially released a fourth batch of previously uncirculating Basement Tape songs.|$|E

500|$|In {{the first}} half of the 1880s, Stanford collaborated with the author Gilbert à Beckett on two operas, Savonarola, and The Canterbury Pilgrims. The former was well {{received}} at its premiere in Hamburg in April 1884, but received a critical savaging when staged at Covent Garden in July of the same year. Parry commented privately, [...] "It seems very badly constructed for the stage, poorly conceived and the music, though clean and well-managed, is not striking or dramatic." [...] The most severe public criticism was in The Theatre, whose reviewer wrote, [...] "The book of Savonarola is dull, stilted, and, from a dramatic point of view, weak. It is not, however, so crushingly tiresome as the music fitted to it. Savonarola has gone far to convince me that opera is quite out of [...] line and that the sooner he abandons the stage for the cathedral, the better for his musical reputation." [...] The Canterbury Pilgrims had been premiered in London in April 1884, three months before Savonarola was presented at Covent Garden. It had a better reception than the latter, though reviews pointed out Stanford's debt to Die Meistersinger, and complained of a lack of emotion in the love music. George Grove agreed with the critics, writing to Parry, [...] "Charlie's music contains everything but sentiment. Love not at all – that I heard not a grain of. ... And I do think that <b>there</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>more</b> tune. Melody is not a thing to be avoided surely." [...] In 1896 a critic wrote that the opera had [...] "just such a 'book' as would have suited the late Alfred Cellier. He would probably have made of it a charming light English opera. But Dr. Stanford has chosen to use it for the exemplification of those advanced theories which we know him to hold, and he has given us music which would incline us to think that Die Meistersinger had been his model. The effect of the combination is not happy." ...|$|E

"Laid his mountains": According to Grotius, it {{was done}} by Nebuchadnezzar {{five years after the}} captivity of the Jews, in {{fulfilment}} of the prophecy of Jeremiah, Jeremiah 49:7 but this was done by the Nabatheans. Mount Seir was the famous mountain that Esau dwelt in, Genesis 36:8 <b>there</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>more</b> in his country; or this might have many tops, and therefore called [...] "mountains"; and to this account of the waste and desolate state of this country agrees what is at present related of it, by a late traveller in those parts.|$|E
2500|$|The {{targets for}} newly {{identified}} snoRNAs are predicted {{on the basis}} of sequence complementarity between putative target RNAs and the antisense elements or recognition loops in the snoRNA sequence. However, there are increasing numbers of 'orphan' guides without any known RNA targets, which suggests that <b>there</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>more</b> proteins or transcripts involved in rRNA than previously and/or that some snoRNAs have different functions not concerning rRNA. There is evidence that some of these orphan snoRNAs regulate alternatively spliced transcripts. For example, it appears that the C/D box snoRNA SNORD115 regulates the alternative splicing of the serotonin 2C receptor mRNA via a conserved region of complementarity.|$|E
