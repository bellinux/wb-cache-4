40|$|CONTEXT: Malnutrition is {{frequently}} observed in inpatients with <b>malignant</b> <b>diseases</b> and {{may contribute to}} longer hospital stays. OBJECTIVE: To compare the nutritional status, lymphocyte count, hemoglobin values and length of hospital stay of patients with and without <b>malignant</b> <b>diseases.</b> METHODS: This comparative study assessed indicators of nutritional status, namely body mass index, recent weight loss, lymphocyte count, hemoglobin and length of hospital stay, of 928 surgical patients with and without <b>malignant</b> <b>diseases</b> (50. 2 % females and 49. 8 % males). The chi-square {{test was used to}} compare proportions and the Mann-Whitney test was used to compare continuous measurements between two groups. The significance level was set at 5 %. RESULTS: Patients with <b>malignant</b> <b>diseases</b> had longer hospital stays (P< 0. 0001), furthermore, a higher percentage of patients with <b>malignant</b> <b>diseases</b> had body mass index < 18. 5 (P< 0. 0001) and experienced recent weight changes (P< 0. 0002). Lymphocyte count also differed statistically between the groups (P = 0. 0131), which lower levels were identified among patients with <b>malignant</b> <b>diseases.</b> CONCLUSION: The lymphocyte count, hemoglobin values and weight loss are important findings of nutritional depletion in patients with <b>malignant</b> <b>diseases...</b>|$|R

Plasma levels of TIMP- 1, CEA, CA 19 - 9, and YKL- 40 were determined in samples collected just before endoscopy and compared with subsequent development of a <b>malignant</b> <b>disease</b> within a period of 7 - 8 years.

We conducted a 10 -year prospective survey on patients with cardiac tamponade requiring an emergency drainage. METHODS: From 1996 to 2005, 114 consecutive patients were {{admitted to the}} University Hospital of Brest for medical cardiac tamponade. Data on medical history, and volume, characteristics and histology of the pericardial fluid as well as short- and long-term follow-up data were collected. RESULTS: <b>Malignant</b> <b>disease</b> was {{the primary cause of}} medical tamponade (74 patients; 65 %), followed by viral history (11; 10 %) and intra-pericardial bleeding due to anti-coagulation treatment (4; 3 %). In 12 cases, aetiology remained unknown (10 %). Pericardiocentesis was immediately performed in 80 cases and surgical pericardiotomy in 34. The mean volume drained was 593 +/- 313 ml. In-hospital mortality was 10 % without any difference between <b>malignant</b> and non-malignant <b>diseases</b> (p = 0. 8). One-year mortality was 76. 5 % in patients with <b>malignant</b> <b>disease</b> and 13. 3 % in those without <b>malignant</b> <b>disease</b> (p < 0. 0001).
