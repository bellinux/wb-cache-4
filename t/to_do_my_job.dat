His parents were Gerald Joseph, a roofer, and veteran in the United States Army (1944–2007) and Pauline Cyr Nadeau. Nadeau's {{ancestors}} originate from St. John's Valley, Maine. He has one sister, Debbie. Nadeau was educated at Henry Abbott Technical High School and studied automotive technology. His family had connections to auto racing; Gerald raced modifieds at the Danbury Race Arena. Nadeau was given a go-kart by his father when he was four and one-half years old. He also worked with his father in the construction industry to support his career. Speaking about his father's role in his career, Nadeau said, [...] "I learned a lot from my dad, Gerry, while I was growing up. He wasn't afraid to yell and get on my toes <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>my</b> <b>job</b> because he hated to lose and I hated to lose. He made me the hungriest guy on the race track." ...|$|E

After he {{performed the}} song he gave an on-air apology for his recent behaviour after using a homophobic slur in a freestyle track he recorded the previous month. He swiftly apologised to those he offended, but was later involved in a heated argument with Lucy Spraggan over his remarks. Speaking to Dermot O'Leary on the show, he said: [...] "It's been an amazing year for me. There's been incredible highs paired with some terrible lows. I've made a few very silly mistakes. I just {{want to thank all}} the people who are still supporting me and especially The X Factor for giving me the opportunity <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>my</b> dream <b>job.</b> Above all, I'd like to say sorry for abusing my position as an X Factor winner, because I owe everything to this thing." ...|$|R
2500|$|The documentary's {{director}} and its driving force, Simcha Jacobovici…, {{said there was}} enough mitochondrial DNA for a laboratory in Ontario {{to conclude that the}} bodies in the [...] "Jesus" [...] and [...] "Mary Magdalene" [...] ossuaries were not related on their mothers' side. From this, Mr. Jacobovici deduced that they were a couple, because otherwise they would not have been buried together in a family tomb. In an interview, Mr. Jacobovici was asked why the filmmakers did not conduct DNA testing on the other ossuaries to determine whether the one inscribed Judah, son of Jesus was genetically related to either the Jesus or Mary Magdalene boxes; or whether the Jesus remains were actually the offspring of Mary. [...] "We're not scientists. At {{the end of the day}} we can't wait till every ossuary is tested for DNA," [...] he said. [...] "We took the story that far. At some point you have <b>to</b> say, I've <b>done</b> <b>my</b> <b>job</b> as a journalist." ...|$|R

5000|$|Green Lantern {{came into}} {{direct contact with}} Ergono and was {{subsequently}} captured by Olivia, who has been possessed by it. While subdued, {{he comes to the}} following realization: [...] "The first time I was blasted by Ergono I was hammered by an awareness of my own mortality. It shook me. It nearly finished me. I rallied back on pure emotion -- but after the incident was over I never felt quite the same. Just a few days later I had that confrontation in Star City with Green Arrow. I stopped a young ghetto dweller from attacking a slumlord -- and Arrow ridiculed me, accused me of playing super-cop to feed my ego. Normally, I'd've told him <b>to</b> let me <b>do</b> <b>my</b> <b>job.</b> But instead -- it shook me to the core of my being. For years after that my will was shaky. I lacerated myself with doubt and indecision. Dear Lord. Were all those years of confusion caused by that one blast of Ergono?"

5000|$|According to {{the first}} indictment, in 2002 {{assistant}} coach Mike McQueary, then a Penn State graduate assistant, said he walked in on Sandusky anally raping a ten-year-old boy. The next day, McQueary reported the incident to head coach Joe Paterno. (Later while testifying during the Sandusky trial, McQueary spoke {{about what he had}} relayed to Paterno: [...] "I told him and I want to make sure I'm clear. I made sure he knew it was sexual and wrong. There was no doubt.") [...] Paterno told McQueary at the time, “You did what you had <b>to</b> <b>do.</b> It is <b>my</b> <b>job</b> now to figure out what we want to do.” [...] At the Preliminary Hearing for Tim Curley and Gary Shultz, McQueary testified that Paterno was [...] "shocked and saddened, kind of slumped back on his chair." [...] He said that Paterno told him: [...] "'I'm sorry you had to see that. It's terrible.' And he said, 'I need to think and tell some people about what you saw and I'll let you know what ... what we'll do next.'" [...] Paterno then informed Penn State athletic director Tim Curley. At the Preliminary Hearing, McQueary also testified that he [...] "believed" [...] Sandusky was having [...] "some type of intercourse" [...] with the boy. He said that this was based on [...] "the positioning" [...] of Sandusky and the boy, but that he never saw [...] "insertion" [...] or [...] "penetration" [...] and is not [...] "100 percent sure" [...] that intercourse was occurring.|$|R

[...] Senator Brown responded, [...] "I was elected and the votes are certified and I’m here <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>my</b> <b>job.</b> It's unfortunate that he would use mean-spirited comments like that at a time when we’re just trying to solve the problems of the Commonwealth." ...|$|E
40|$|This {{paper is}} an {{extended}} abstract for a talk at OOP 2004 on “Persistence Options for Object-Oriented Programs”. It {{gives you a}} bird’s eye view {{of the field of}} persistence options for o-o programs with a deeper look at object/relational access layers. You will get an idea of an ideal persistent o-o language and the ODMG standard. This will lead to forces which you need to know when deciding about persistence options. You will look at various options like flat files, object databases, relational databases, o/r databases, and finally at how o/r access layers for relational databases can be built. Starting with application types we move on to a rough overview of how to handle persistence in business information systems. We will come by the mechanisms needed for build-your-own cheap solutions to heavier ones using meta-data. The paper ends by showing you what to expect in environments like J 2 EE/EJB and. NET. 2. Who Will Profit from this Paper and How If you are an open source developer of persistence layers or a senior software architect who hibernates on the Server Side or sleeps at the Java Lobby then this paper will bore you. This paper is meant as an introductory article that shows developers what factors to look at, when tackling persistence. Senior developers may also profit as they might draw a few new aspects from the paper – especially the application styles in section 5. They might also profit as this paper is suited to spoil their appetite for a “roll your own ” persistence solution. Software managers will get the opportunity to ask their tech people a lot of nasty questions if they enter the door with the idea to build their own persistence solution. In most occasions you will find ready made solutions that do the job. ♣ this paper is not written under the logo of my employer AMB Generali Informatik, as the topic has not got much <b>to</b> <b>do</b> with <b>my</b> daily <b>job</b> obligations there.

[...] The program instead aired in its regular network timeslot on KWBF (now KARZ-TV) on Fridays following WB primetime programming.

Phillip Knightley reported a conversation with Howard in 2003 in which Howard had said Wilson [...] "understood I was only trying <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>my</b> <b>job</b> but he had a job to do, too, and his was more important than mine.

Theron then played the Evil Queen Ravenna, Snow White's evil stepmother, in the film Snow White and the Huntsman, which began production in 2011 and was released in 2012. In 2011, she described her process for becoming the characters in her film: When I'm figuring out a character, for me it's easy, since once I say yes to something, I become super-obsessed about it - and I have an obsessive nature in general. How I want to play it starts at that moment. It's a very lonely, internal experience. I think about character all the time - I observe things, I see things and file things my head, everything geared to what I'm going to do. I'm obsessed with the human condition. You read the script and become obsessed with character's nature, her habits. When the camera rolls, it's time <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>my</b> <b>job,</b> to do the honest truth.
