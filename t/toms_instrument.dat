In this study, a significant improvement in fit from previous studies is obtained using a model which assumes {{a change in the}} rate of drift between TOMS and Dobson around the middle of 1982.

The causes of this drift cannot be definitively separated between residual uncorrected drift in the <b>TOMS</b> <b>instrument</b> (a similar drift is apparent in the SBUV-Dobson comparisons), limited sensitivity of the TOMS to increases in tropospheric ozone, and the effect of local increases in pollution levels on individual Dobson stations...|$|E

Likewise, meteorological fields show that two pronounced ozone streamers extending north and northeastward into Canada at high levels are not bands of stratospheric air feeding into the cyclone; one is a channel of exhaust downstream from the system, and the other apparently previously connected the main cyclonic circulation to a southward intrusion of polar stratospheric air and advected eastward as the cut-off cyclone evolved.

40|$|Poor Insight is {{a common}} symptom of {{schizophrenia}} and it is conceptualised as having at least three principal components, namely unawareness of symptoms, unawareness {{of the need for}} treatment, and unawareness of the consequences of the disorder. These deficits have long been of clinical interest and have been shown to predict poorer treatment compliance, clinical outcome, social function, and response to vocational rehabilitation (Amador & David, 2004). Additionally, difficulties to establish and maintain social relationships are core features of schizophrenia, and there is evidence that these may to some extent stem from an alteration of the neural circuits that regulate social behaviour, and in particular deficits in Theory of Mind (ToM) (Lee et al., 2004). While deficits in insight in schizophrenia have been widely and consistently reported in the literature, evidence {{on the nature of the}} ToM dysfunction in this disorder is still controversial. This is mainly due to methodological differences across studies as well as limitations regarding the <b>instruments</b> used for <b>ToM</b> assessment. The first aim of this research consisted of clarifying some of these issues -whether a specific ToM dysfunction existed in schizophrenia and whether this most suitably fitted in the state or trait deficit views- trying to overcome previous methodological drawbacks. We did so by the use of a well matched control group, by controlling for important confounds and by the inclusion of <b>ToM</b> <b>instruments</b> of different nature (verbal and pictorial tasks). Results of this project were included in a first paper (Pousa et al., 2008 a) and also led to the publication of a letter discussing part of the conclusions of a recent meta-analysis on ToM in schizophrenia (Pousa, Ruiz & David, 2008). Following this preliminary work and on the basis of a number of phenomenological parallelisms between insight and ToM dysfunctions that could be appreciated both clinically and in the literature, we decided to explore the relationship between insight and ToM. Given the scarcity of previous studies specifically focused on this issue, the nature of the study was mainly exploratory. The most relevant results of this investigation led to a second paper (Pousa et al., 2008 b). Besides the mentioned publications, two complementary published works are added in the present thesis for their relevance to the project. The first is the manuscript of the Spanish adaptation of the SUMD (Ruiz et al., 2007). The second is a chapter of a book on mental disorders from an evolutionary perspective, titled "Theory of Mind as an evolutionary brain module". This chapter describes the concept of ToM, its measurement, as well as its neurobiological basis and philogenetic development, and was part of the literature review carried out while working on the design of the project (Obiols & Pousa, 2005).

40|$|ABSTRACT: It {{is crucial}} to {{quantify}} the amount of absorbing aerosol present in the atmosphere because it may lower the single scatter albedo of otherwise mainly scattering aerosol. These absorbing aerosols consist primarily of dust, smoke from biomass burning, and carbonaceous aerosol associated with fossil fuel burning. These aerosols also may act as cloud condensation nuclei, thereby increasing reflection of solar radiation by clouds. In order to estimate the indirect effect, the quantification of the fraction of absorbing, carbonaceous aerosol relative to natural organic aerosol is needed. In this proposal we plan to use our global aerosol model in combination with meteorological fields that have been nudged towards observed or analyzed fields to enable us to compare predicted absorbing aerosols with observed aerosols as derived from the <b>TOMS</b> <b>instrument</b> (Herman et al., 1997). The <b>TOMS</b> <b>instrument</b> is only able to record absorbing aerosol above about 2 km.

Because the <b>TOMS</b> <b>instrument</b> measures backscattered UV radiation, it does detect ozone lying below dense water vapor clouds.

In the CCD method, tropospheric column ozone (i. e., the total vertical column of ozone lying in the troposphere) is computed by taking total column ozone with low reflectivity (R less than 0. 2) and subtracting from this a nearby measurement of above-cloud column ozone amount under conditions of high reflectivity (R greater than 0. 9).
