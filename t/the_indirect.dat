5|$|The {{direct or}} American process starts with diverse {{contaminated}} zinc composites, such as zinc ores or smelter by-products. The zinc precursors are reduced (carbothermal reduction) by heating with {{a source of}} carbon such as anthracite to produce zinc vapor, which is then oxidized as in <b>the</b> <b>indirect</b> process. Because of the lower purity of the source material, the final product is also of lower quality in the direct process as compared to <b>the</b> <b>indirect</b> one.|$|E

40|$|To assess <b>the</b> {{direct and}} <b>indirect</b> effect of an intervention, {{multilevel}} 2 - 1 - 1 studies with intervention randomized {{at the upper}} (class) level and mediator and outcome measured at the lower (student) level are frequently used in educational research. In such studies, the mediation process may flow through the student-level mediator (<b>the</b> within <b>indirect</b> effect) or a class-aggregated mediator (<b>the</b> contextual <b>indirect</b> effect). In this article, we cast mediation analysis within the counterfactual framework and clarify the assumptions that are needed to identify the within and contextual indirect effect. We show that unlike <b>the</b> contextual <b>indirect</b> effect, <b>the</b> within <b>indirect</b> effect can be unbiasedly estimated in linear models {{in the presence of}} unmeasured confounders of the mediator-outcome relationship at the upper level that exert additive effects on mediator and outcome. When unmeasured confounding occurs at the individual level, both indirect effects are no longer identified. We propose sensitivity analyses to assess the robustness of the within and contextual indirect effect under lower and upper-level confounding, respectively...|$|R

5|$|In more derived {{orders of}} insects, such as Diptera (flies) and Hymenoptera (wasp), <b>the</b> <b>indirect</b> muscles occupy the {{greatest}} {{volume of the}} pterothorax and function as {{the primary source of}} power for the wingstroke. Contraction of the dorsolongitudinal muscles causes the severe arching of the notum which depresses the wing while contraction of the dorsoventral muscles causes opposite motion of notum. Other more primitive insects, such as Orthoptera (locusts), Coleoptera (beetles), and Odonata (dragonflies) use direct muscles that are responsible for developing the needed power for the up and down strokes.|$|E

5|$|Many Metro {{stations}} {{were designed by}} Chicago architect Harry Weese, and are examples of late-20th century modern architecture. With their heavy use of exposed concrete and repetitive design motifs, Metro stations display aspects of Brutalist design. The stations also reflect the influence of Washington's neoclassical architecture in their overarching coffered ceiling vaults. Weese worked with Cambridge, Massachusetts-based lighting designer Bill Lam on <b>the</b> <b>indirect</b> lighting used throughout the system. All of Metro's original Brutalist stations are found in Downtown Washington, D.C. and neighboring urban corridors of Arlington, Virginia, while newer stations incorporate simplified cost-efficient designs.|$|E

5|$|The French 55th Infantry Division was not {{prepared}} for such an attack. French soldiers had commented on the massive psychological effect of the bombardment, in particular the siren of the Ju 87. However, after the war, {{it was discovered that}} none of the bunkers had been destroyed by direct hits. Moreover, just 56 French casualties were suffered. It was <b>the</b> <b>indirect</b> effect that did the damage. The telecommunication cables were destroyed (most had been laid out in the open) through bombing, paralysing the division's communications, and the psychological damage crippled its defensive capacity.|$|E
5|$|A {{study by}} Arima et al. {{published}} in May 2011 used spatial regression modeling {{to provide the}} first statistical assessment of ILUC for the Brazilian Amazon due to soy production. Previously, <b>the</b> <b>indirect</b> impacts of soy crops were only anecdotal or analyzed through demand models at a global scale, while the study took a regional approach. The analysis showed a strong signal linking the expansion of soybean fields in settled agricultural areas at the southern and eastern rims of the Amazon basin to pasture encroachments for cattle production on the forest frontier. The results demonstrate the need to include ILUC in measuring the carbon footprint of soy crops, whether produced for biofuels or other end-uses.|$|E
5|$|In <b>the</b> <b>indirect</b> or French process, {{metallic}} zinc {{is melted}} in a graphite crucible and vaporized at temperatures above 907Â°C (typically around 1000Â°C). Zinc vapor reacts with the {{oxygen in the}} air to give ZnO, accompanied by a drop in its temperature and bright luminescence. Zinc oxide particles are transported into a cooling duct and collected in a bag house. This indirect method was popularized by LeClaire (France) in 1844 and therefore is commonly known as the French process. Its product normally consists of agglomerated zinc oxide particles with an average size of 0.1 to a few micrometers. By weight, most of the world's zinc oxide is manufactured via French process.|$|E

5|$|Lead-ions (Pb), like magnesium-ions (Mg), blocks NMDA receptors. Since {{the normal}} Pb {{concentration}} in the extracellular fluid is low (adult average of 120mg), even a low increase in Pb concentration has a significant positive affect on the blockage of NMDA-receptors. Therefore, an increase in Pb concentration, will, effectively, inhibit ongoing long-term potentiations (LTPs), and lead to an abnormal increase long-term depression (LDPs) on neurons on the effected parts of the nervous system. These abnormalities lead to <b>the</b> <b>indirect</b> downregulation of NMDA-receptors, effectively initiating a positive feedback-loop for LDP. The targeting of NMDA receptors {{is thought to be}} one of the main causes for lead's toxicity to neurons.|$|E

Seven people are confirmed dead from Rita's direct effects, and total damage from the storm is estimated at $10billion, almost entirely in Texas and Louisiana. 55-112 indirect deaths have also been reported, most resulting from incidents during the evacuation of Houston when the storm was predicted to strike the city. Many of <b>the</b> <b>indirect</b> deaths were caused by a single bus fire in the mass exodus.|$|E
