5|$|The Gaelic overkingdom of Dál Riata was on {{the western}} coast of modern Scotland, with some {{territory}} on the northern coasts of Ireland.

Dál Riata is commonly viewed as having been an Irish Gaelic colony in Scotland, although some archaeologists have recently argued against this. <b>The</b> <b>inhabitants</b> <b>of</b> Dál Riata are {{often referred to as}} Scots, from Latin scotti, a name used by Latin writers for <b>the</b> <b>inhabitants</b> <b>of</b> Ireland.
