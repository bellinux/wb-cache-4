2500|$|At first, most courts {{ruled that}} a {{sentence}} of imprisonment imposed upon revocation cannot be followed by an additional <b>term</b> <b>of</b> supervised release, unless the defendant is convicted of a new crime for which supervised release is an authorized punishment. However, this law was changed, and now states, [...] "When a <b>term</b> <b>of</b> supervised release is revoked and the defendant is required to serve a <b>term</b> <b>of</b> imprisonment, the court may include a requirement that the defendant be placed on a <b>term</b> <b>of</b> supervised release after imprisonment. The length <b>of</b> such a <b>term</b> <b>of</b> supervised release shall not exceed the <b>term</b> <b>of</b> supervised release authorized by statute for the offense {{that resulted in the}} original <b>term</b> <b>of</b> supervised release, less any <b>term</b> <b>of</b> imprisonment that was imposed upon revocation of supervised release." [...] The original [...] had included a clause stating that the <b>term</b> <b>of</b> imprisonment had to be less than the maximum <b>term</b> <b>of</b> imprisonment authorized by [...] in order for a <b>term</b> <b>of</b> supervised release to be available, but this led to perverse effects in that, for instance, if the maximum <b>term</b> <b>of</b> imprisonment was two years, a judge could sentence a defendant to two years less one day, and then be able to sentence him to a year of supervised release. If supervision is revoked, it means the defendant spends part of supervision imprisoned, and then supervision is continued until it is terminated by the court or expires.|$|R
