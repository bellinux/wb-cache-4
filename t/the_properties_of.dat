As a corollary, <b>the</b> <b>property</b> <b>of</b> being (pointed) movable is sequential strong Whitney-reversible property for curves. This is an affirmative answer to [8, (5. 2) ].

50|$|When one now {{analyzes}} the round square copula using the MOTdc, one {{will find that}} it now avoids the three common paradoxes: (1) The {{violation of the law}} of contradiction, (2) The paradox <b>of</b> claiming <b>the</b> <b>property</b> <b>of</b> existence without actually existing, and (3) producing counterintuitive consequences. Firstly, the MOTdc shows that the round square does not exemplify <b>the</b> <b>property</b> <b>of</b> being round, but <b>the</b> <b>property</b> <b>of</b> being round and square. Thus, there is no subsequent contradiction. Secondly, it avoids the conflict of existence/non-existence by claiming non-physical existence: by the MOTdc, it can only be said that the round square simply does not exemplify <b>the</b> <b>property</b> <b>of</b> occupying a region in space. Finally, the MOTdc avoids counterintuitive consequences (like a 'thing' having <b>the</b> <b>property</b> <b>of</b> nonexistence) by stressing that the round square copula can be said merely to encode <b>the</b> <b>property</b> <b>of</b> being round and square, not actually exemplifying it. Thus, logically, it does not belong to any set or class.|$|R
