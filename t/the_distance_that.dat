5|$|The {{throwing}} events involve hurling {{an implement}} (such as a heavy weight, javelin or discus) from a set point, with athletes being judged on <b>the</b> <b>distance</b> <b>that</b> {{the object is}} thrown. Combined events involve {{the same group of}} athletes contesting a number of different track and field events. Points are given for their performance in each event and the athlete with the greatest points total at the end of all events is the winner.|$|E
5|$|A {{factor that}} {{influences}} how easy or difficult a bike {{will be to}} ride is trail, <b>the</b> <b>distance</b> <b>that</b> the front wheel ground contact point trails behind the steering axis ground contact point. The steering axis is the axis about which the entire steering mechanism (fork, handlebars, front wheel, etc.) pivots. In traditional bike designs, with a steering axis tilted back from the vertical, positive trail tends to steer the front wheel into {{the direction of a}} lean, independent of forward speed. This can be simulated by pushing a stationary bike to one side. The front wheel will usually also steer to that side. In a lean, gravity provides this force. The dynamics of a moving bike are more complicated, however, and other factors can contribute to or detract from this effect.|$|E
5|$|Gliese 581d orbits Gliese 581 at 0.21847 AU, {{approximately}} {{a fifth of}} <b>the</b> <b>distance</b> <b>that</b> the Earth orbits the Sun, though its orbital eccentricity has not been confirmed. There are currently two models for its orbit, a circular one like Earth's, and an eccentric one like Mercury's. These {{are based on the}} four planet and six planet model for the Gliese 581 system, respectively. Under the four planet model Gliese 581d would most probably be in a spin-orbit resonance of 2:1, rotating twice for each orbit of its parent star. Therefore, the day on Gliese 581d should approximately be 67 Earth days long.|$|E

5|$|In December 2010, it was {{reported}} that only 20% of the game was complete. Numerous features {{were not included in the}} final product due to time and budget constraints. The developers originally planned to add a special weapon designed to be used underwater and acquired from Chris at the end of the eight episode, but the plot of the game changed during development and the team had to discard it. Additionally, the land in <b>the</b> <b>distance</b> <b>that</b> can be seen from the ship in the first episode was originally going to be the setting of the last episode, where Jill would have found something from her past.|$|E
5|$|In the 3000 m team race on {{the next}} day, Nurmi and Ritola again {{finished}} first and second, and Elias Katz secured the gold medal for the Finnish team by finishing fifth. Nurmi had won five gold medals in five events, but he left the Games embittered as the Finnish officials had allocated races between their star runners and prevented him from defending his title in the 10,000 m, <b>the</b> <b>distance</b> <b>that</b> was dearest to him. After returning to Finland, Nurmi set a 10,000 m world record that would last for almost 13 years. He now held the 1500 m, the mile, the 3000 m, the 5000 m and the 10,000 m world records simultaneously.|$|E

25|$|Because, {{especially}} in digital signal processing, switching frequencies {{have continued to}} rise, the demand for high frequency decoupling or filter capacitors increases. With a simple design change the ESL of a MLCC chip can be reduced. Therefore, the stacked electrodes are connected on the longitudinal side with the connecting terminations. This reduces <b>the</b> <b>distance</b> <b>that</b> the charge carriers flow over the electrodes, which reduces inductance of the component.|$|E
25|$|To {{be in the}} star's {{habitable}} zone, any suspected planet around Alpha CentauriA {{would have}} to be optimally placed about 1.25AU away – about halfway between the distances of Earth's orbit and Mars's orbit in the Solar System– so as to have similar planetary temperatures and conditions for liquid water to exist. For the slightly less luminous and cooler Alpha CentauriB, the habitable zone would lie closer at about , approximately <b>the</b> <b>distance</b> <b>that</b> Venus is from the Sun.|$|E

25|$|Temperature effect: A fog can {{be caused}} by a {{temperature}} inversion where cold air is pooled at the surface which helped to create the fog, while warmer air sits above it. The inverted boundary between cold air and warm air reflects sound waves back toward the ground, allowing sound that would normally radiate out escaping into the upper atmosphere to instead bounce back and travel near the surface. A temperature inversion increases <b>the</b> <b>distance</b> <b>that</b> lower frequency sounds can travel, by reflecting the sound between the ground and the inversion layer.|$|E
25|$|There {{is concern}} {{that climate change}} will {{dramatically}} affect the monarch migration. A study from 2015 examined the impact of warming temperatures on the breeding range of the monarch, and showed {{that in the next}} 50 years the monarch host plant will expand its range further north into Canada, and that the monarchs will follow this. While this will expand the breeding locations of the monarch, this will also have the effect of increasing <b>the</b> <b>distance</b> <b>that</b> monarchs must travel to reach their overwintering destination in Mexico, and this could result in greater mortality during the migration.|$|E

Her first international title followed the next year, as she won the 100m gold medal at the 1985 Universiade. She won a medal of each colour at that tournament, through a 200 metres bronze and a 4×100 metres relay silver medal. Her 100m winning time of 11.11 ranked her in the top ten athletes in the world for <b>the</b> <b>distance</b> <b>that</b> year.|$|E
25|$|Steely {{returned}} {{to compete in}} 1998 and ran frequently, mainly out of necessity as she {{no longer had a}} sponsor. She was in the top three at the 1998 USA Outdoors in the 10,000 meters, came fourth in the event at the 1998 Goodwill Games, and ranked second nationally in <b>the</b> <b>distance</b> <b>that</b> year. She won the US titles in the 25-kilometer and 10-mile events that year, as well as runner-up placing in the national 12-kilometer and half marathon events. Her performance over the latter distance gained her a spot at the 1998 IAAF World Half Marathon Championships, where she placed 42nd overall.|$|E
25|$|In the 1980s, a {{committee}} {{was set up}} to get La Tinta to municipality status but these pioneers confronted serious problems, including death threats and had to desist. A new committee was formed in 1987, {{but it was not until}} 1999 that the group directed by José Gilberto Artola Choc accomplished the new designation. The reasons they argued to get their independent status were <b>the</b> <b>distance</b> <b>that</b> Panzós was from La Tinta -30km, approximately- the increase in economic activity in La Tinta -and the decay in Panzós after the Verapaz Railroad ceased operations in the 1960s-, the population was more than enough to get the municipality designation and the lack of support that Panzós gave La Tinta.|$|E

25|$|When the British {{formed a}} line of battle, Landolphe thought from <b>the</b> <b>distance</b> <b>that</b> they were a fleet of {{powerful}} warships and turned to escape. Belliqueux captured Landolphe’s Concorde. Two East Indiamen set out {{in pursuit of the}} other two frigates, with Exeter and Bombay Castle chasing Médée. As darkness fell, Exeter caught up with Médée and Meriton had lights displayed throughout his ship and behind the gun ports {{to give the impression that}} she was a ship of the line. Exeter fired a broadside; Bombay Castle possibly did so also. Believing himself outgunned, Captain Jean-Daniel Coudin surrendered Médée, only to discover when he came aboard Exeter that she was a merchant vessel. Horrified, he demanded to be allowed to return to his ship to continue the fight, but Meriton declined the demand.|$|E
25|$|In 1919 Ricardo was {{studying}} the phenomena affecting the combustion within the petrol engine and the diesel engine. He realised that turbulence within the combustion chamber increased flame speed, {{and that he}} could achieve this by offsetting the cylinder head. He also realised that making the chamber as compact as possible would reduce <b>the</b> <b>distance</b> <b>that</b> the flame had to travel and would reduce the likelihood of detonation. He later developed the induction swirl chamber, which was an attempt to achieve orderly air motion in a diesel engine, the swirl being initiated by inclined ports and accentuated by forcing the air into a small cylindrical volume. Finally he developed the compression swirl chamber for diesel engines. This design embodied intense swirl with a reasonable rate of pressure rise and good fuel consumption.|$|E
