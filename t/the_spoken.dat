5|$|Apart {{from the}} Imperial court, {{administration}} and military, the primary language {{used in the}} eastern Roman provinces even before {{the decline of the}} Western Empire was Greek, having been spoken in the region for centuries before Latin. Following Rome's conquest of the east its 'Pax Romana', inclusionist political practices and development of public infrastructure, facilitated the further spreading and entrenchment of Greek language in the east. Indeed, early on {{in the life of the}} Roman Empire, Greek had become the common language of the Church, the language of scholarship and the arts, and, to a large degree, the lingua franca for trade between provinces and with other nations. Greek for a time became diglossic with <b>the</b> <b>spoken</b> language, known as Koine (eventually evolving into Demotic Greek), used alongside an older written form until Koine won out as <b>the</b> <b>spoken</b> and written standard.|$|E

30|$|From {{the study}} {{done in the}} {{previous}} subsections analyzing the independent effect {{of each of the}} acoustic correlates of speech like <b>the</b> pitch, <b>the</b> <b>speaking</b> rate, <b>the</b> glottal parameters, and the formant frequencies on children's speech recognition performance, it is noted that the significant improvements in the recognition performance are obtained with the normalization of <b>the</b> pitch, <b>the</b> <b>speaking</b> rate, and <b>the</b> formant frequencies only. In this subsection, we study the effect of combined normalization of only these three acoustic correlates of speech on children's speech recognition performance. The combined normalization of the acoustic correlates of speech has been done in sequential manner, that is, for obtaining both <b>the</b> <b>speaking</b> rate and <b>the</b> pitch-normalized speech signals; first <b>the</b> <b>speaking</b> rate of <b>the</b> speech signal is normalized followed by its pitch-normalization. As mentioned earlier, VTLN is performed in the feature domain whereas <b>the</b> <b>speaking</b> rate and <b>the</b> pitch-normalization are done in the signal domain. Thus, to incorporate VTLN in combination with <b>the</b> <b>speaking</b> rate and <b>the</b> pitch-normalization, the signal is first speaking rate and/or pitch-normalized followed by VTLN. Between <b>the</b> <b>speaking</b> rate and <b>the</b> pitch-normalization, we have first normalized <b>the</b> <b>speaking</b> rate since <b>the</b> <b>speaking</b> rate transformation may result in slight modification of the pitch of the signals.|$|R

5|$|Matangi {{represents}} {{the power of}} <b>the</b> <b>spoken</b> word (Vaikhari) {{as an expression of}} thoughts and the mind. She also relates to the power of listening and grasping speech and converting it back to knowledge and thought. Besides spoken word, she also governs all other expressions of inner thought and knowledge, like art, music and dance. Matangi presides over the middle part of speech (Madhyama), where ideas are translated into <b>the</b> <b>spoken</b> word and in her highest role, represents Para-Vaikhari—the Supreme Word manifested through speech and that encompasses knowledge of the scriptures. She is described as the goddess of learning and speech, and the bestower of knowledge and talent. She is also called Mantrini, the mistress of the sacred mantras. She also {{represents the}} word of a guru, who serves as a spiritual guide. Matangi is described as dwelling in the Throat chakra—the origin of speech—and on the tip of the tongue. She is also associated with a channel called Sarasvati from the third eye to the tip of the tongue. According to David Frawley, her description as impure refers to the nature of <b>the</b> <b>spoken</b> word, which labels things and stereotypes them, thereby hindering actual contact with the soul of things. The goddess is described as one who helps a person to use words in the right way and to go beyond it to seek the soul and inner knowledge, which lie outside the demarcated boundaries of tradition.|$|E
