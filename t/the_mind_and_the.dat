One building (now Tech Tower, an administrative headquarters) had classrooms to teach students; The second building featured a shop and had a foundry, forge, boiler room, and engine room. It was designed for students to work and produce goods to sell and fund the school. The two buildings were equal in size to show the importance of teaching both <b>the</b> <b>mind</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> hands, though, at the time, there was some disagreement to whether the machine shop should have been used to turn a profit.|$|E

The species was shown in the 1742 Index Testarum Conchyliorum, quae adservantur in Museo Nicolai Gualtieri (List of the shells of shellfish which are preserved in the museum of Niccolò Gualtieri) by Italian physician and malacologist Niccolò Gualtieri. In both books, the morphology of an adult shell was shown from different perspectives.|$|E

25|$|Conquest of Mind is a {{book that}} {{describes}} practices and strategies for leading the spiritual life. Written by Eknath Easwaran, the strategies are intended to be usable within any major religious tradition, or outside of all traditions. The book was originally published in the United States in 1988. Multiple revised English-language editions have been published, and translations have also appeared in several other European and Asian languages. The book has been reviewed in newspapers and magazines. In Conquest of Mind, Easwaran provides a much more extensive discussion of how his program {{can be used to}} train <b>the</b> <b>mind,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> importance of training the mind.|$|E
25|$|Dr. Cadbury {{was also}} one of the few doctors known to {{rehabilitate}} both <b>the</b> <b>mind</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> body of his patients. Genuinely concerned for the wellbeing of his patients, he was known to check on them and wear his stethoscope at all times. Those around him observed that he was a very knowledgeable, highly skilled, and effective doctor. Over the years, he became the most well-known internist in Canton. He tried to emulate William Osler, who was a famous internist in the 1800s. In 1913, he was named the principal doctor for the Canton Hospital. Then, in 1914, he joined the specialized medical staff of Canton Hospital.|$|E

25|$|Body psychotherapy, part of {{the field}} of somatic psychology, focuses on the link between <b>the</b> <b>mind</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> body and tries to access deeper levels of the psyche through greater {{awareness}} of the physical body and emotions.

These approaches are {{not to be confused with}} body work or body-therapies that seek to improve primarily physical health through direct work (touch and manipulation) on the body, rather than through directly psychological methods.|$|E

500|$|There {{are some}} brain {{states in which}} {{consciousness}} seems to be absent, including dreamless sleep, coma, and death. [...] There are also a variety of circumstances that can change the relationship between <b>the</b> <b>mind</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> world in less drastic ways, producing {{what are known as}} altered states of consciousness. [...] Some altered states occur naturally; others can be produced by drugs or brain damage. Altered states can be accompanied by changes in thinking, disturbances in the sense of time, feelings of loss of control, changes in emotional expression, alternations in body image and changes in meaning or significance.|$|E
500|$|In the {{philosophy}} of perception Putnam came to endorse direct realism, according to which perceptual experiences directly present one with the external world. In the past, he further held {{that there are no}} mental representations, sense data, or other intermediaries that stand between <b>the</b> <b>mind</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> world. By 2012, however, he rejected this further commitment, in favor of [...] "transactionalism", a view that accepts both that perceptual experiences are world-involving transactions, and that these transactions are functionally describable (provided that worldly items and intentional states may be referred to in the specification of the function). Such transactions can further involve qualia.|$|E
500|$|At {{the end of}} the 1980s, Putnam became {{increasingly}} disillusioned with what he perceived as the [...] "scientism" [...] and the rejection of history that characterize modern analytic philosophy. He rejected internal realism because it assumed a [...] "cognitive interface" [...] model of the relation between <b>the</b> <b>mind</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> world. Putnam claimed that the very notion of truth would have to be abandoned by a consistent eliminative materialist. Under the increasing influence of James and the pragmatists, he adopted a direct realist view of this relation. For a time, under the influence of Ludwig Wittgenstein, he adopted a pluralist view of philosophy itself and came to view most philosophical problems as nothing more than conceptual or linguistic confusions created by philosophers by using ordinary language out of its original context. In 2017 a book collecting articles on pragmatism by both Ruth Anna and Hilary Putnam was published, Pragmatism as a Way of Life: The Lasting Legacy of William James and John Dewey (Harvard UP, 2017, [...] ).|$|E

500|$|Bates placed {{importance}} on mental images, {{as he felt}} relaxation {{was the key to}} clarity of imagination as well as of actual sight. He claimed that one's poise could be gauged by the visual memory of black; that the darker it appeared in <b>the</b> <b>mind,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> smaller the area of black that could be imagined, the more relaxed one was at the moment. He recommended that patients think of the top letter from an eye chart and then visualize progressively smaller black letters, and eventually a period or comma. But he emphasized his view that the clear visual memory of black [...] "cannot be attained by any sort of effort", stating that [...] "the memory is not the cause of the relaxation, but must be preceded by it," [...] and cautioned against [...] "concentrating" [...] on black, as he regarded an attempt to [...] "think of one thing only" [...] as a strain.|$|E
500|$|The Georgia School of Technology {{opened its}} doors {{in the fall of}} 1888 with only two buildings, under the {{leadership}} of professor and pastor Isaac S. Hopkins. One building (now Tech Tower, the main administrative complex) had classrooms to teach students; the other featured a workshop with a foundry, forge, boiler room, and engine room. It was designed specifically as a [...] "contract shop" [...] where students would work to produce goods to sell, creating revenue for the school while the students learned vocational skills in a [...] "hands-on" [...] manner. Such a method was seen as appropriate given the Southern United States' need for industrial development. The two buildings were equal in size and staffing (five professors and five shop supervisors) to show the importance of teaching both <b>the</b> <b>mind</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> hands. At the time, there was some disagreement as to whether the machine shop should have been used to turn a profit. The contract shop system ended in 1896 due to its lack of profitability, after which point the items produced were used to furnish the offices and dorms on the campus.|$|E
500|$|To most philosophers, {{the word}} [...] "consciousness" [...] connotes the {{relationship}} between <b>the</b> <b>mind</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> world. To writers on spiritual or religious topics, it frequently connotes {{the relationship between}} the mind and God, or {{the relationship between the}} mind and deeper truths that are thought to be more fundamental than the physical world. [...] Krishna consciousness, for example, is a term used to mean an intimate linkage between the mind of a worshipper and the god Krishna. [...] The mystical psychiatrist Richard Maurice Bucke distinguished between three types of consciousness: [...] Simple Consciousness, awareness of the body, possessed by many animals; Self Consciousness, awareness of being aware, possessed only by humans; and Cosmic Consciousness, awareness of the life and order of the universe, possessed only by humans who are enlightened. [...] Many more examples could be given, such as the various levels of spiritual consciousness presented by Prem Saran Satsangi and Stuart Hameroff. The most thorough account of the spiritual approach may be Ken Wilber's book The Spectrum of Consciousness, a comparison of western and eastern ways of thinking about the mind. Wilber described consciousness as a spectrum with ordinary awareness at one end, and more profound types of awareness at higher levels.|$|E
