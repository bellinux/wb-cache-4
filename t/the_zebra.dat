5|$|There is robust {{morphological}} {{support for}} the placement of <b>the</b> <b>zebra</b> shark, the whale shark (Rhincodon typus), and the nurse sharks (Ginglymostoma cirratum, Nebrius ferrugineus, and Pseudoginglymostoma brevicaudatum) in a single clade. However, the interrelationships between these taxa are disputed by various authors. Dingerkus (1986) suggested that the whale shark is the closest relative of <b>the</b> <b>zebra</b> shark, and proposed a single family encompassing all five species in the clade. Compagno (1988) suggested affinity between this species and either Pseudoginglymostoma or a clade containing Rhincodon, Ginglymostoma, and Nebrius. Goto (2001) placed <b>the</b> <b>zebra</b> shark as the sister group to a clade containing Rhincodon and Ginglymostoma.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>zebra</b> shark feeds {{primarily}} on shelled molluscs, though {{it also takes}} crustaceans, small bony fishes, and possibly sea snakes. The slender, flexible body of this shark allows it to wriggle into narrow holes and crevices in search of food, while its small mouth and thickly muscled buccal cavity allow it to create a powerful suction force with which to extract prey. This species may be preyed upon by larger fishes and marine mammals. Known parasites of <b>the</b> <b>zebra</b> shark include four species of tapeworms in the genus Pedibothrium.|$|E
5|$|An {{animal that}} is {{commonly}} {{thought to be}} dazzle-patterned is <b>the</b> <b>zebra.</b> The bold stripes of <b>the</b> <b>zebra</b> have been claimed to be disruptive camouflage, background-blending and countershading. After many years in which {{the purpose of the}} coloration was disputed, an experimental study by Tim Caro suggested in 2012 that the pattern reduces the attractiveness of stationary models to biting flies such as horseflies and tsetse flies. However, a simulation study by Martin How and Johannes Zanker in 2014 suggests that when moving, the stripes may confuse observers, such as mammalian predators and biting insects, by two visual illusions: the wagon-wheel effect, where the perceived motion is inverted, and the barberpole illusion, where the perceived motion is in a wrong direction.|$|E
50|$|There {{are three}} species of zebras: <b>the</b> plains <b>zebra,</b> <b>the</b> {{mountain}} <b>zebra</b> and <b>the</b> Grévy's <b>zebra.</b> <b>The</b> plains <b>zebra</b> and <b>the</b> mountain <b>zebra</b> belong to <b>the</b> subgenus Hippotigris, but Grévy's <b>zebra</b> is <b>the</b> sole species of subgenus Dolichohippus. The latter resembles an ass, {{to which it}} is closely related, while the former two are more horse-like. All three belong to the genus Equus, along with other living equids.|$|R
40|$|This study {{investigated}} the seasonal patterns of vegetation community use by <b>the</b> Cape mountain <b>zebra</b> within <b>the</b> Mountain <b>Zebra</b> National Park over one seasonal cycle. Day-time censuses revealed that <b>the</b> <b>zebras</b> utilised all <b>the</b> different vegetation commu- nities that were defined in the park, {{with the exception of}} the riparian bush community. Year-round <b>the</b> <b>zebras</b> made greatest use of the grassland vegetation communities, together with those shrubland and dwarf shrubland communities that offered high grass biomasses. Selectivity for vegetation communities was greatest during the wet season, when <b>the</b> <b>zebras</b> favoured those grassland communities on the plateaus over other vegetation communities on the mountain slopes and in the ravines. During the dry season <b>the</b> <b>zebras</b> showed a greater diversity in their use of vegetation communities, and made greater use of those vegetation communities on the mountain slopes and in the ravines. The results suggest that the seasonal variations in vegetation community use by <b>the</b> <b>zebras</b> were in response to changes in the annual rainfall pattern...|$|R

5|$|Individuals {{living in}} large groups may be safer from attack because the {{predator}} may be {{confused by the}} large group size. As the group moves, the predator has greater difficulty targeting an individual prey animal. <b>The</b> <b>zebra</b> has been suggested by the zoologist Martin Stevens and his colleagues {{as an example of}} this. When stationary, a single zebra stands out because of its large size. To reduce the risk of attack, zebras often travel in herds. The striped patterns of all the zebras in the herd may confuse the predator, making it harder for the predator to focus in on an individual zebra. Furthermore, when moving rapidly, <b>the</b> <b>zebra</b> stripes create a confusing, flickering motion dazzle effect {{in the eye of the}} predator.|$|E
5|$|Naja nigricollis {{belongs to}} the cobra genus Naja under the family Elapidae.

5|$|Another origin tale {{claims that}} King Solomon {{was given a}} pure Arabian-type mare named Safanad ("the pure") by the Queen of Sheba.

5|$|Some {{freshwater}} bivalves have very restricted ranges. For example, the Ouachita creekshell mussel, Villosa arkansasensis, is known {{only from the}} streams of the Ouachita Mountains in Arkansas and Oklahoma, and like several other freshwater mussel species from the southeastern US, it {{is in danger of}} extinction. In contrast, a few species of {{freshwater bivalves}}, including the golden mussel (Limnoperna fortunei), are dramatically increasing their ranges. The golden mussel has spread from Southeast Asia to Argentina, where it has become an invasive species. Another well-travelled freshwater bivalve, <b>the</b> <b>zebra</b> mussel (Dreissena polymorpha) originated in southeastern Russia, and has been accidentally introduced to inland waterways in North America and Europe, where the species damages water installations and disrupts local ecosystems.|$|E

50|$|Duncan (1992) {{recognized}} <b>the</b> Upper Zambezi <b>zebra</b> (Equus quagga zambeziensis Prazak, 1898).

5|$|The ROH World Championship is a {{professional}} wrestling world championship owned by the Ring of Honor (ROH) promotion. The championship was created and debuted on July 27, 2002, at ROH's Crowning a Champion event. Originally called the ROH Championship, the title was renamed to the ROH World Championship in May 2003 after the title was defended outside the United States for the first time—earlier that month, then-champion Samoa Joe had defeated <b>The</b> <b>Zebra</b> Kid in London, England at the Frontiers of Honor event co-promoted with the FWA. On August 12, 2006, the ROH World Heavyweight Championship was unified with the ROH Pure Championship after then-champion Bryan Danielson defeated ROH Pure Champion Nigel McGuinness in Liverpool, England. The Pure Championship was deactivated after this match.|$|E
5|$|<b>The</b> <b>zebra</b> shark has a {{cylindrical}} {{body with a}} large, slightly flattened head and a short, blunt snout. The eyes are small and placed {{on the sides of}} the head; the spiracles are located behind them and are as large or larger. The last 3 of the 5 short gill slits are situated over the pectoral fin bases, and the fourth and fifth slits are much closer together than the others. Each nostril has a short barbel and a groove running from it to the mouth. The mouth is nearly straight, with three lobes on the lower lip and furrows at the corners. There are 2833 tooth rows in the upper jaw and 2232 tooth rows in the lower jaw; each tooth has a large central cusp flanked by two smaller ones.|$|E
5|$|Zebra {{sharks are}} nocturnal and {{spend most of}} the day resting {{motionless}} on the sea floor. At night, they actively hunt for molluscs, crustaceans, small bony fishes, and possibly sea snakes inside holes and crevices in the reef. Though solitary for most of the year, they form large seasonal aggregations. <b>The</b> <b>zebra</b> shark is oviparous: females produce several dozen large egg capsules, which they anchor to underwater structures via adhesive tendrils. Innocuous to humans and hardy in captivity, zebra sharks are popular subjects of ecotourism dives and public aquaria. The World Conservation Union has assessed this species as Endangered worldwide, as it is taken by commercial fisheries across most of its range (except off Australia) for meat, fins, and liver oil. There is evidence that its numbers are dwindling.|$|E

5|$|Docile and slow-moving, zebra {{sharks are}} not {{dangerous}} to humans {{and can be}} easily approached underwater. However, they have bitten divers who pull on their tails or attempt to ride them. As of 2008 there is one record of an unprovoked attack in the International Shark Attack File, though no injuries resulted. They are popular attractions for ecotourist divers in the Red Sea, off the Maldives, off Thailand's Phuket and Phi Phi islands, on the Great Barrier Reef, and elsewhere. Many zebra sharks at diving sites have become accustomed {{to the presence of}} humans, taking food from divers' hands and allowing themselves to be touched. <b>The</b> <b>zebra</b> shark adapts well to captivity and is displayed by a number of public aquaria around the world.

5|$|Howard Shore composed, orchestrated, conducted, and {{produced}} the trilogy's music. He {{was hired in}} August 2000 and visited the set, and watched the assembly cuts of The Fellowship of the Ring and The Return of the King. In the music, Shore included many (85 to 110) leitmotifs to represent various characters, cultures, and places - the largest catalogue of leitmotives {{in the history of}} cinema, surpassing - for comparison - that of the entire Star Wars saga. For example, there are multiple leitmotifs just for the hobbits and the Shire. Although the first film had some of its score recorded in Wellington, virtually all of the trilogy's score was recorded in Watford Town Hall and mixed at Abbey Road Studios. Jackson planned to advise the score for six weeks each year in London, though for The Two Towers he stayed for twelve.
