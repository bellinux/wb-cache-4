5|$|As the Internet grew in {{popularity}} and its traffic was required <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>routed</b> into private networks, the TCP/IP protocols replaced existing {{local area network}} technologies. Additional technologies, such as DHCP, allowed TCP/IP-based computers to self-configure in the network. Such functions also existed in the AppleTalk/ IPX/ NetBIOS protocol sets.|$|E
5|$|The {{importance}} of the crossing to vehicular traffic was underpinned when the Great Britain road numbering scheme was drawn up in the 1920s. The planners wished the arterial A9 road <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>routed</b> across the Forth here, although the unwillingness to have a ferry crossing {{as part of this}} route led to the A90 number being assigned instead.|$|E
5|$|Until 1864, {{communications}} between Fort Greble {{and its neighbors}} had <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>routed</b> through departmental headquarters in Washington. After {{a test of the}} system completely failed, efforts were made to establish signaling points between the forts, and the forts themselves were connected to Washington via telegraph wire. Signal detachments were present at Fort Stanton, near Uniontown, and sometimes visited Fort Greble as part of training efforts.|$|E
50|$|Trains <b>to</b> Iraq must <b>be</b> <b>routed</b> via Syria; {{the section}} of the tracks within Syria, between the Turkish and Iraqi borders is 81 km long. From March 5, 2012 due to the civil war in Syria, all rail {{services}} from Turkey <b>to</b> Syria <b>were</b> stopped; as a consequence freight going from Turkey <b>to</b> Iraq <b>was</b> <b>routed</b> <b>to</b> Nusaybin in southeast Turkey, from where it <b>was</b> transported <b>to</b> Iraq by truck.|$|R

5|$|ARC is {{an audio}} link meant to replace other cables between the TV and the A/V {{receiver}} or speaker system. This direction is used when the TV {{is the one}} that generates or receives the video stream instead of the other equipment. A typical case is the running of an app on a smart TV such as Netflix, but reproduction of audio is handled by the other equipment. Without ARC, the audio output from the TV needs <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>routed</b> by another cable, typically TOS-Link or coax, into the speaker system.|$|E
5|$|In the meantime, on the Roman left wing, Severus {{must have}} {{suspected}} the prepared ambush, and held back from advancing into the woods, according to Ammianus. Libanius contradicts this, {{claiming that the}} Romans charged the enemy and flushed {{them out of their}} hiding places. But Ammianus' version is more likely, as the Romans would hardly have benefited from advancing straight into a prepared trap. Ammianus does not report further action in this sector. But {{it is likely that the}} hidden Germans eventually lost patience, advanced out of the woods and charged at Severus' division, only <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>routed</b> by Severus' crack troops.|$|E
5|$|Route 41 {{was chosen}} {{as one of the}} initial routes <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>routed</b> through the Metro Bus Tunnel in Downtown Seattle, but due to a delay in the {{production}} of special dual-mode buses for the tunnel, route 41 was not moved into the tunnel until 1991. Route 41 ran primarily during peak hours, with some limited midday service, and was supplemented by route 307, which ran from Downtown Seattle to Northgate and Bothell on weekends and nights. The northern terminus of route 41 was moved from Magnuson Park to 5th Avenue NE and NE 125th Street in 1997, eliminating service to Sand Point and Lake City.|$|E

5|$|The {{periscopes}} {{also had}} problems with their optics: periscope users reported difficulty in refocusing after changing magnification, duplication of images, and bands across the field of vision. These problems were attributed to RAN demands that the optical view be the first exposed when a periscope was raised above the water, instead of placing the infrared sensor and single-pulse radar at the head as on other submarines, requiring the optical path <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>routed</b> around these components. The periscopes were gradually improved, and were no longer a problem {{by the time the}} fast track submarines entered service.|$|E
5|$|The highway through Imperial Valley was {{originally}} a plank road made {{of pieces of}} wood that were tied together. The Ocean-to-Ocean Bridge across the Colorado River was open in 1915. Following this, US80 was built through the valley as the main east–west route. Plans for a new freeway across the southernmost reaches of California date from before 1950. The bridge over the Colorado River was replaced in 1956, {{at a cost of}} $1.2 million, and was in use until 1978, when the I-8 bridge was built. In 1957, the City of El Centro expressed a desire for the new freeway to replace US80 <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>routed</b> along the southern limits of the city. Caltrans engineer Jacob Dekema stated {{at the time that the}} four-lane freeway would not be constructed on the US80 routing due to possible expansion of the Naval Air Facility El Centro.|$|E
25|$|The ACARS {{equipment}} on the aircraft {{is linked to}} that on the ground by the datalink service provider. Because the ACARS network is modeled after the point-to-point telex network, all messages come to a central processing location <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>routed.</b> ARINC and SITA are the two primary service providers, with smaller operations from others in some areas. Some areas have multiple service providers.|$|E
50|$|Palestine Post is {{responsible}} for providing postal service in West Bank, while the Ministry of Telecom and Information Technology of the State of Palestine {{is responsible}} for postal service in the Gaza Strip. Generally, international letters addressed <b>to</b> West Bank <b>are</b> <b>routed</b> through both Jordan and Israel and the international letters addressed <b>to</b> Gaza <b>are</b> <b>routed</b> through only Israel. Delays often happen during sending and receiving letters from Palestine. Without these two national postal authorities, no international courier service would be serving the areas.|$|R

25|$|Freenet {{is fully}} distributed, but employs a {{heuristic}} key-based routing {{in which each}} file {{is associated with a}} key, and files with similar keys tend to cluster on a similar set of nodes.

25|$|The {{plan was}} for {{utilities}} <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>routed</b> under water, with water plants {{at each of}} the hubs pumping fresh water to the islands. Power was to be supplied by the Dubai Grid and distributed through underwater cables, however as of February 2015 no cables had been laid, so that developers currently have to provide their own power from diesel generators. Waste water and refuse systems are an individual concern for each island.|$|E
25|$|To enable {{censorship}} of undesirable sites, all Internet traffic {{into and out}} of Singapore was required <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>routed</b> through local proxy servers. As a token of this restriction, to placate social conservatives, prominent porn websites such as Playboy and Penthouse were blocked. The official explanation was that the Government wanted to signal a stand on undesirable sites without unduly hindering the development of the Internet. However, websites of local origin were monitored more closely than those from overseas.|$|E

25|$|Additionally, many UK Internet {{users were}} unable to edit Wikipedia pages unless {{registered}} and logged in with Wikipedia. This {{is reported to be}} due to the single blacklisted article causing all Wikipedia traffic from ISPs using the system <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>routed</b> through a transparent proxy server. Wikipedia distinguishes unlogged-in users from each other by their IP address, so interpreted all unlogged-in users from a particular ISP as a single user editing massively from the proxy address, which triggered Wikipedia's anti-abuse mechanism, blocking them.|$|E
25|$|Supported by 12 cannons, Jacques Félix Jan de La Hamelinaye's brigade stormed Villeneuve and Grand-Maison at 3:30 pm. Gérard held Georges Joseph Dufour's brigade in reserve. As the Bavarian foot {{soldiers}} bolted from both positions, {{they were set}} upon by Bordesoulle's cavalrymen. When some Allied cavalry tried to rescue the Bavarians, the French horsemen rode into them and chased them away. Next, the Iller Mobile Legion tried to intervene, only <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>routed</b> by the French recruits. Altogether, Bordesoulle's half-trained horsemen inflicted about 300 casualties on their foes. They apparently took no prisoners except a wounded Austrian officer who Bordesoulle had to personally save.|$|E
25|$|Maucune {{lost about}} 400 casualties. Of these, about 300 were {{captured}} {{along with the}} division's baggage train. British losses were about 100 killed and wounded. As the French soldiers fled, many threw away their knapsacks. The division reorganized at Miranda de Ebro. Joseph was furious with Maucune for allowing his division <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>routed.</b> The unit was so roughly handled that the king decided {{it was no longer}} fit for combat and assigned it to guard a convoy bound for France. The convoy set out from Vitoria at 2:00 AM {{on the morning of the}} 21st. The division would be sorely missed at the Battle of Vitoria later that day.|$|E

25|$|The {{increasing}} {{tension between}} Berke and Hulagu was {{a warning to}} the Golden Horde contingents in Hulagu's army that they had better escape. One section reached the Kipchak Steppe, another traversed Khorasan and a third body took refuge in Mamluk ruled Syria where they were well received by Sultan Baybars (1260–77). Hulagu harshly punished {{the rest of the}} Golden Horde army in Iran. Berke sought a joint attack with Baybars and forged an alliance with the Mamluks against Hulagu. The Golden Horde dispatched Nogai to invade the Ilkhanate but Hulagu forced him back in 1262. The Ilkhanids then crossed the Terek River, capturing an empty Jochid encampment, only <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>routed</b> in a surprise attack by Nogai's forces. Many of them were drowned as the ice broke on the frozen Terek River.|$|E
25|$|Over time, {{these new}} masters of Racha – {{henceforth}} {{known as the}} Eristavi of Racha – significantly expanded their possessions, confiscating estates of other noble families and even those belonging to the crown. They were embroiled in incessant feudal wars that plagued Georgia at that time, frequently changing their side as they sought to achieve more autonomy from the kings of Imereti. The powerful duke Rostom (r. 1750-1769) was able to maintain Racha virtually independent, eventually to be defeated and removed from office by King Solomon I of Imereti, who turned Racha into a royal domain. His successor David II restored the duchy to Rostom’s grandson and his own sisterly nephew Anton in 1784. The rival noble clans, especially Tsulukidze and Tsereteli, attempted to counter the move by invoking a force of Ottoman and Dagestan mercenaries, only <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>routed</b> by the royal army in 1786. This restoration proved to be short-lived and the next Imeretian king Solomon II finally annexed the duchy in 1789.|$|E
25|$|The clocks at CERN and LNGS {{had to be}} in sync, and {{for this}} the {{researchers}} used high-quality GPS receivers, backed up with atomic clocks, at both places. This system timestamped both the proton pulse and the detected neutrinos to a claimed accuracy of 2.3nanoseconds. But the timestamp could not be read like a clock. At CERN, the GPS signal came only to a receiver at a central control room, and had <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>routed</b> with cables and electronics to the computer in the neutrino-beam control room which recorded the proton pulse measurement (Fig.3). The delay of this equipment was 10,085nanoseconds and this value had {{to be added to the}} time stamp. The data from the transducer arrived at the computer with a 580nanoseconds delay, and this value had to be subtracted from the time stamp. To get all the corrections right, physicists had to measure exact lengths of the cables and the latencies of the electronic devices. On the detector side, neutrinos were detected by the charge they induced, not by the light they generated, and this involved cables and electronics as part of the timing chain. Fig.4 shows the corrections applied on the OPERA detector side.|$|E
