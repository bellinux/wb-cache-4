5|$|As he {{had when}} he {{directed}} The Wrath of Khan, Meyer attempted to modify the look of Star Trek to fit his vision. Cinematographer Hiro Narita's previous work had been on effects films such as The Rocketeer, where he had <b>time</b> <b>and</b> <b>money</b> <b>to</b> make a lavish period fantasy; with The Undiscovered Country, he was constantly under time and budgetary pressures. Though Narita confessed that {{he knew nothing about}} Star Trek, Meyer replied {{that he did not want}} him to have any preconceived notions about the look of the series.|$|E
5|$|Before {{specialized}} {{bulk carriers}} existed, shippers had two methods to move bulk goods by ship. In the first method, longshoremen loaded the cargo into sacks, stacked the sacks onto pallets, {{and put the}} pallets into the cargo hold with a crane. The second method required the shipper to charter an entire ship and spend <b>time</b> <b>and</b> <b>money</b> <b>to</b> build plywood bins into the holds. Then, to guide the cargo through the small hatches, wooden feeders and shifting boards had to be constructed. These methods were slow and labor-intensive. As with the container ship, the problem of efficient loading and unloading has driven {{the evolution of the}} bulk carrier.|$|E
5|$|In 1905 the Heroic Self Sacrifice Memorial Committee had {{suggested}} to Mary Watts that public funds be raised {{to complete the}} memorial, but she objected and promised to complete the 120 tablets at her own cost or provide funds in her will to do so. However, in 1910 she told the Committee that {{she was unable to}} fund the project, as she was devoting her <b>time</b> <b>and</b> <b>money</b> <b>to</b> the Watts Mortuary Chapel and the Watts Gallery in Compton. Work to fill the three empty rows of the memorial was abandoned.|$|E

5|$|In 1935 Wong {{was dealt}} {{the most severe}} {{disappointment}} of her career, when Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer refused to consider her for the leading role of the Chinese character O-Lan in {{the film version of}} Pearl S. Buck's The Good Earth, choosing instead the white actress Luise Rainer to play the leading role. Wong spent the next year touring China, visiting her family's ancestral village and studying Chinese culture. In the late 1930s, she starred in several B movies for Paramount Pictures, portraying Chinese, and Chinese Americans in a positive light. She paid less attention to her film career during World War II, when she devoted her <b>time</b> <b>and</b> <b>money</b> <b>to</b> helping the Chinese cause against Japan. Wong returned to the public eye in the 1950s in several television appearances.|$|E

25|$|The {{propensity}} {{for a higher}} number of recall is greatly increased with platform sharing. If a defect is found in one model and that model shares its platform with ten other models, the recall would be magnified by ten thus costing the manufacturer more <b>time</b> <b>and</b> <b>money</b> <b>to</b> fix. An example of problems spreading across platforms and numerous versions of models are the 2009â€“11 Toyota vehicle recalls.|$|E

AMD gave the NexGen design team their own building, left them alone, and gave them <b>time</b> <b>and</b> <b>money</b> <b>to</b> rework the Nx686. The result was the K6 processor, introduced in 1997. Although the K6 was based on Socket 7, variants such as K6-3/450 were faster than Intel's Pentium II (sixth-generation processor).|$|E

40|$|Modular {{components}} were refined or replaced {{to improve the}} performance of the electrolysis module in a system which generates both oxygen and hydrogen from hydrazine hydrate. Significant mechanical and electrical performance improvements were achieved in the cathode. Improvements were also made in the phase separation area but at considerable cost in <b>time</b> <b>and</b> <b>money</b> <b>and</b> <b>to</b> the detriment of other investigative areas. Only the pump/bubble separator failed in a manner necessitating redesign. Its failure was, however, due to its being operated above the temperature range for which it was designed. The basic electrolysis cell design was not changed...|$|R

25|$|Not surprisingly, {{those who}} are high in global human {{identification}} are less prejudiced toward many groups, care more about international human rights, worldwide inequality, global poverty and human suffering.

There was concern that the early announcement of the change would cause an Osborne effect, and there was the possibility that Intel could force Apple to use the Intel Inside branding. In addition, Apple had nurtured a feeling of animosity toward Intel among its loyal base. It would take <b>time</b> <b>and</b> <b>money</b> <b>to</b> convince Apple's most loyal customers that Intel was acceptable.|$|E

25|$|The {{influence}} of British newspapers on creating {{the public perception}} of mods as having a leisure-filled club-going lifestyle {{can be seen in}} a 1964 article in the Sunday Times. The paper interviewed a 17-year-old mod who went out clubbing seven nights a week and spent Saturday afternoons shopping for clothes and records. However, few British teens and young adults would have had the <b>time</b> <b>and</b> <b>money</b> <b>to</b> spend this much time going to nightclubs. Paul Jobling and David Crowley argue that most young mods worked 9 to 5 at semi-skilled jobs, which meant that they had much less leisure time and only a modest income to spend during their time off.|$|E

Also, the economic boom allowed more people the <b>time</b> <b>and</b> <b>money</b> <b>to</b> play golf and tennis and to take vacations, which required clothing adapted to these activities; the flapper's slender silhouette was very suitable for movement.|$|E
