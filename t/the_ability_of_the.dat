5|$|Both innate and {{adaptive}} immunity depend on <b>the</b> <b>ability</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{immune system to}} distinguish between self and non-self molecules. In immunology, self molecules are those components of an organism's body that can be distinguished from foreign substances by the immune system. Conversely, non-self molecules are those recognized as foreign molecules. One class of non-self molecules are called antigens (short for antibody generators) and are defined as substances that bind to specific immune receptors and elicit an immune response.|$|E

5|$|Dominican {{folk music}} is an oral tradition, learned informally through {{watching}} others perform. As of 1987, most performers of traditional music were either over 50 {{years old or}} under 35, which indicates an ongoing revival of previously declining traditions.

5|$|In {{contrast}} to DNA damage, a mutation {{is a change}} in the base sequence of the DNA. A mutation cannot be recognized by enzymes once the base change is present in both DNA strands, and thus a mutation cannot be repaired. At the cellular level, mutations can cause alterations in protein function and regulation. Mutations are replicated when the cell replicates. In a population of cells, mutant cells will increase or decrease in frequency according to the effects of the mutation on <b>the</b> <b>ability</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> cell to survive and reproduce.|$|E

40|$|AbstractIn {{previous}} work {{we showed that}} automatic SAT-based model-checking techniques based on a reduction of protocol (in) security problems to a sequence of propositional satisfiability problems {{can be used to}} effectively find attacks on protocols. In this paper we present an optimized intruder model that may lead in many cases to shorter attacks which can be detected in our framework by generating smaller propositional formulae. The key idea is to assume that some <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>abilities</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> intruder have instantaneous effect, whereas in the previously adopted approach all <b>the</b> <b>abilities</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> intruder were modeled as state transitions. This required non trivial extensions to the SAT-reduction techniques which are formally described in the paper.

The {{earliest}} poems were religious hymns which portrayed the holy king as the apostle of the Hungarians.

Poets described Stephen as the symbol of national identity and independence and of <b>the</b> <b>ability</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Hungarian nation to survive historical cataclysms during the Communist regime between 1949 and 1989.|$|E
