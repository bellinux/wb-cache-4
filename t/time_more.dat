Instead of returning to Basra, however, he encamped at Bakhamra, a location on the road between the two cities. There, on 21 January, Ibrahim with his troops, reduced by defections to some 15,000 men, confronted the Abbasid army under Isa ibn Musa. Isa's vanguard was at first beaten, but the battle ended in a crushing Abbasid victory. Ibrahim himself was heavily wounded and escaped {{with a handful of}} supporters.

5|$|All dinosaurs lay amniotic {{eggs with}} hard shells made mostly of calcium carbonate. Eggs are usually laid in a nest. Most species create {{somewhat}} elaborate nests, {{which can be}} cups, domes, plates, beds scrapes, mounds, or burrows. Some species of modern bird have no nests; the cliff-nesting common guillemot lays its eggs on bare rock, and male emperor penguins keep eggs between their body and feet. Primitive birds and many non-avialan dinosaurs often lay eggs in communal nests, with males primarily incubating the eggs. While modern birds have only one functional oviduct and lay one egg at a <b>time,</b> <b>more</b> primitive birds and dinosaurs had two oviducts, like crocodiles. Some non-avialan dinosaurs, such as Troodon, exhibited iterative laying, where the adult might lay a pair of eggs every one or two days, and then ensured simultaneous hatching by delaying brooding until all eggs were laid.|$|E

The army of the Principate probably reached a peak of nearly 450,000 (excluding fleets and foederati) {{at the end of the}} 2nd century.

5|$|Endometrial cancer {{frequently}} metastasizes to {{the ovaries}} and Fallopian tubes when the cancer {{is located in}} {{the upper part of the}} uterus, and the cervix when the cancer is in the lower part of the uterus. The cancer usually first spreads into the myometrium and the serosa, then into other reproductive and pelvic structures. When the lymphatic system is involved, the pelvic and para-aortic nodes are usually first to become involved, but in no specific pattern, unlike cervical cancer. More distant metastases are spread by the blood and often occur in the lungs, as well as the liver, brain, and bone. Endometrial cancer metastasizes to the lungs 20–25% of the <b>time,</b> <b>more</b> than any other gynecologic cancer.|$|E

30|$|Thus, this ratio might {{vary from}} country to country and by gender, as a higher ratio was {{observed}} in women. For example, in the USA, the percentages of female and male half-marathoners in 2014 were 61 and 39  %, respectively (www.runningusa.org/half-marathon-report- 2015). For marathoners in the same year and the same country, the percentages were, however, 43 and 57  %, respectively (www.runningusa.org/marathon-report- 2015). In other terms, 1.56 <b>times</b> <b>more</b> women competed in half-marathon running, but 1.32 <b>times</b> <b>more</b> men in marathon running in 2014 in the USA. When we compare the 2014 data of the USA to the data from 1999 – 2014 in Switzerland, 10.2 <b>times</b> <b>more</b> marathoners competed in the USA (550, 637) compared to Switzerland (53, 694). Considering the sexes, there were 23.2 <b>times</b> <b>more</b> women and 7.2 <b>times</b> <b>more</b> men in the USA than in Switzerland. For half-marathon running, there were 4.5 <b>times</b> <b>more</b> athletes in the USA (2046, 600) compared to Switzerland (454, 324). There were 9.9 <b>times</b> <b>more</b> women and 2.4 <b>times</b> <b>more</b> men in the USA compared to Switzerland. Considering the data of Leyk et al. (2007) investigating 65 half-marathons and 69 marathons held in Germany between 2003 and 2005, a total of 156, 717 men and 144, 640 women were considered with a ratio of 1.08. There were 4.85 and 2.6 <b>times</b> <b>more</b> men in marathons and half-marathons, respectively (Leyk et al. 2007). When we compare their data to the data from Switzerland, we had 2.9 times fewer marathoners, but 3.1 <b>times</b> <b>more</b> half-marathoners. In details, we considered 2.6 times fewer male (43, 489 vs. 129, 929) and 2.98 fewer female (10, 205 vs. 26, 788) marathoners. For half-marathoners, we investigated 3.1 <b>times</b> <b>more</b> female half-marathoners (125, 894 vs. 39, 998) and 3.1 <b>times</b> <b>more</b> male half-marathoners (328, 430 vs. 104, 042).

5|$|III. Scherzo: Allegro vivace – Trio: Un poco più lento. The A {{section of}} the scherzo uses a playful leaping rolled chord figure that is rhythmically and harmonically {{reminiscent}} of the opening bars of the sonata. The B section {{is dominated by the}} juxtaposition of two distant tonal realms. It commences in C-major for a rollicking theme that is abruptly interrupted by a downward-rushing C-sharp minor scale without any modulatory preparation, in a striking cyclic reference to the climax of the preceding movement's middle section. Following this outburst, the B section quietly ends in C-sharp minor a grace-note melody identical in contour to a figure from the theme of the Andantino (2–1–7–1–3–1), before modulating back to the movement's tonic. C major returns in the concluding A section, this <b>time</b> <b>more</b> tonally integrated into its A-major surroundings, by modulatory sequences. The ternary form trio in D major uses hand crossing to add melodic accompaniment to the chordal theme, and is rhythmically and harmonically based on the opening of the Allegro.|$|E

Ælfhere's rival Æthelwine, while a staunch protector of his family monastery of Ramsey Abbey, treated Ely Abbey and other monasteries harshly. At some point during these disorders, Ælfhere and Æthelwine appear to have come close to open warfare. This may well have been related to Ælfhere's ambitions in East Anglia and to attacks upon Ramsey Abbey. Æthelwine, supported by his kinsman Ealdorman Byrhtnoth of Essex and others unspecified, mustered an army and caused Ælfhere to back down.|$|E
