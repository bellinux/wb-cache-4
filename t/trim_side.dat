50|$|Stone {{used in the}} foundations, wall facades and the two remarkably large fireplaces, was {{obtained}} from old walls on the properties acquired for Bear Mountain State Park. Chestnut timber used for framing, certain <b>trim,</b> <b>siding</b> and floor-covering, was also obtained from local parklands and milled on site. Despite appearances to the contrary, the building's basic framework is constructed of steel.|$|R

5000|$|New-construction {{windows of}} recent vintage {{typically}} have a [...] "nailing fin" [...] along the outer frame. This fin provides a surface {{so that the}} window can be nailed in from {{the outside of the}} home before the application of flashing, siding or brick and stone veneers. Most replacement windows are manufactured without this fin {{so that they can be}} installed with minimal disruption to the existing <b>trim,</b> <b>siding,</b> sheetrock or exterior veneer.|$|R
50|$|The {{limited edition}} 2014 Chrysler 200 Super S was a Mopar {{modified}} version and included two stages. Stage One enhancements up front include a chin spoiler, mesh {{upper and lower}} grilles with the upper grille finished in gloss black, and satin chrome grille and fog light <b>trim.</b> <b>Side</b> sills and gray or hyper black 18-inch wheels give a firmly planted look, while black chrome badges and satin chrome side molding further differentiate the Super S. In back, more satin chrome finishes the light bar, and a new trunk lid spoiler and a matte black diffuser with integrated exhaust complete the package.|$|E
5000|$|At introduction, the MPV {{used the}} same 170 hp DOHC 2.5 L Ford Duratec V6 unit that powered the Ford Contour and Mercury Mystique and Cougar. DX models {{featured}} a two-place middle bench seat. The LX model featured two middle buckets with a feature whereby the passenger side seat could slide sideways (marketed as [...] "side by slide"), power windows and locks, heated power mirrors, privacy glass, and antilock brakes. The ES model added leather seating surfaces, wood tone interior <b>trim,</b> <b>side</b> impact air bags on the front seats, bigger wheels, and dual zone front and rear air conditioners.|$|E
5000|$|In February 1960 the BLSIP-2 was released. The {{front end}} was {{modified}} with quad headlights {{and although the}} grille opening remained the same, the grille itself was changed, with six thick horizontal bars replacing the 13 thin horizontal bars. The rear end was completely redesigned; the tail lights were moved low to just above the rear bumper. The tail fins were capped off with stainless steel trim that ran from one fin, down under the trunk lid opening and back up the fin on the other side. The trunk lid featured a [...] "Prince" [...] badge and a [...] "Gloria" [...] badge {{to the right of}} it. The panel between the tail lights was covered in metal <b>trim.</b> <b>Side</b> trim remained identical from the BLSIP-1. The BLSIP-2 continued to use the GB-30 engine.|$|E

50|$|The {{official}} {{pictures of}} the new C3 were revealed on 29 June 2016. The C3 takes front styling cues from the facelifted Citroën C4 Picasso, {{as well as the}} Grand C4 Picasso and receives side Airbump mouldings from the Citroën C4 Cactus, and is available with Airbumps or without them. It is offered with a choice of nine exterior colours, and three contrast shades that appear on the roof, foglight <b>trims,</b> <b>side</b> mirrors and Airbump surrounds. Citroën claims the range will offer a total of 36 different colour combinations.|$|R

It is distributed {{under the terms of the}} Creative Commons Attribution 3. 0 licence. Small plastic clips are used in large numbers in automotive vehicles to connect interior trims to vehicle structures. The variability in their properties can contribute to the overall variability in noise and vibration response of the vehicle. The variability arises due to their material and manufacturing tolerances and more importantly due to the boundary condition. To measure their stiffness and damping, a simple experimental rig is used where a mass is supported by the clip which is modelled as a single degree of freedom system. The rig is designed in a way that it simulates the boundary condition as those of the real vehicle. The variability in clip and also due to the boundary condition at the structure side is first examined which is 7 % for stiffness and 8 % for damping. To simulate the connection of the <b>trim</b> <b>side,</b> a mount is built using a 3 D printer. Rattling occurs in the response of the clips with loose connections, however by preloading the mount the effective stiffness increases and the rattling is eliminated. The variability due to the boundary condition at the <b>trim</b> <b>side</b> was as large as 40 % for stiffness and 52 % for damping...|$|E
40|$|This is an Open Access article {{published}} by Sage and distributed {{under the terms}} of the Creative Commons Attribution Licence, [URL] large number of plastic clips are used in an automotive vehicle to connect the trim to the structure. These are small clips with very small masses compared to the structural elements that they connect together; however, the uncertainty in their properties can affect the dynamic response. The uncertainty arises out of their material and manufacturing tolerances and more importantly the boundary conditions. A test rig has been developed that can model the mounting condition of the clips. This allows measurement of the range of their effective stiffness and damping. Initially, the boundary condition at the structure side is replicated. The variability is found to be 7 % for stiffness and 8 % for damping. In order to simulate the connection of the <b>trim</b> <b>side,</b> a mount is built using a 3 D printer. The variability due to the boundary condition on both sides was as large as 40 % for stiffness and 36 % for damping. A Monte Carlo simulation is used in order to assess the effect of the uncertainty of the clips’ properties on the vibration transfer functions of a door assembly. A simplified connection model is used in this study where only the axial degree of freedom is considered in connecting the trim to the door structure. The uncertainty in the clip stiffness and damping results in a variability in the vibration transfer function which is frequency dependent and can be as high as 10 % at the resonant peaks with higher values at some other frequencies. It is shown that the effect of the uncertainty in the clips effective damping is negligible and the variability in the dynamic response is mainly due to the uncertainty in the clip’s stiffness. Furthermore, it is shown that the variability would reduce either by increasing or decreasing the effective stiffness of the clips...|$|E

2500|$|Also {{with this}} generation, each model of Taurus {{received}} different exterior trim. The lowest level Taurus L had light grey plastic mirrors and window trim, while the bumpers and <b>side</b> <b>trim</b> were also light grey. The GL, the mid priced model, got chrome window trim and body color mirrors, while still retaining the grey bumpers and <b>side</b> <b>trim.</b> The top-of-the-line LX model had its bumpers color keyed, {{as well as}} having the grey <b>side</b> <b>trim</b> replaced with color keyed body cladding. 1992 L and GL models (and the Mercury Sable GS) could also be ordered with a two-tone paint job, in which instead of being grey, the bumpers and <b>side</b> <b>trim</b> were painted a slightly darker shade of the vehicle's body color. [...] To cut costs, this was discontinued for the 1993 model year, as all models received color-matched trim and bumpers from that year onward.|$|R

A new Custom trim level, which used <b>side</b> <b>trim</b> {{similar to that used}} on the 1962 Daytonas, stepped into the Regal's former place. Daytonas received new <b>side</b> <b>trim</b> that started as a narrow molding on the front fenders and widened toward the rear. The basic design of this trim was shared with the Cruiser.|$|R
