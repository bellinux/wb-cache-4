25|$|In 1979, Ronald Reagan {{visited the}} NORAD command base, Cheyenne Mountain Complex, {{where he was}} first {{introduced}} to the extensive tracking and detection systems extending throughout <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>and</b> <b>into</b> space. However, {{he was struck by}} their comments that while they could track the attack down to the individual targets, there was nothing one could do to stop it. Reagan felt that {{in the event of an}} attack this would place the president in a terrible position, having to choose between immediate counterattack or attempting to absorb the attack and then maintain an upper hand in the post-attack era. Shultz suggests that this feeling of helplessness, coupled with the defensive ideas proposed by Teller a decade earlier, combined to form the impetus of the SDI. In the fall of 1979, at Reagan's request, Lieutenant General Daniel O. Graham, the former head of the DIA, briefed Reagan on a concept he called the High Frontier, a missile shield composed of multi-layered ground- and space-based weapons that could track, intercept, and destroy ballistic missiles, which would theoretically be possible because of emerging technologies. It was designed to replace the MAD doctrine that Reagan and his aides described as a suicide pact. In September 1981, Graham formed a small, Virginia-based think tank called High Frontier to continue research on the missile shield. The Heritage Foundation provided High Frontier with space to conduct research, and Graham published a 1982 report entitled, “High Frontier: A New National Strategy” that examined in greater detail how the system would function.|$|E

50|$|Organizations {{such as the}} Electronic Privacy Information Center and the Electronic Frontier Foundation {{challenged}} the Clipper chip proposal, saying {{that it would have}} the effect not only of subjecting citizens to increased and possibly illegal government surveillance, but that the strength of the Clipper chip's encryption could not be evaluated by the public as its design was classified secret, and that therefore individuals and businesses might be hobbled with an insecure communications system. Further, it was pointed out that while American companies could be forced to use the Clipper chip in their encryption products, foreign companies could not, and presumably phones with strong data encryption would be manufactured abroad and spread throughout <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>and</b> <b>into</b> the United States, negating the point of the whole exercise, and, of course, materially damaging U.S. manufacturers en route.

The program was originally launched as a summer replacement series; it was then presented on a once-a-month basis during the 1978-79 television season, before being given a regular weekly timeslot on Thursdays at 10:00 p.m. Eastern Time beginning May 31, 1979. Ratings were generally very good {{during the summer months}} during its eight years on Thursday nights despite competition from Knots Landing on CBS and Hill Street Blues on NBC. It was around this time that the program started using the Brock Brower-written signoff line [...] "We're in touch, so you be in touch" [...] to end each program, which continues to be used to now (the program also used the line [...] "Around <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>and</b> <b>into</b> your home, {{the stories that touch your}} life" [...] as the introduction during the show's opening titles for much of the 1990s).|$|E
5000|$|Jaxon-Bear’s eighteen-year spiritual path {{began after}} the 1971 May Day Protests, {{when he became}} a federal {{fugitive}} during the Vietnam War. As he described, “I was brought face-to-face with death. Through grace, I passed to the other side: I awoke to the truth of my own nature as empty, immortal consciousness.” This experience led him on a spiritual search that took him around <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>and</b> <b>into</b> many traditions and practices. In 1978, Kalu Rinpoche appointed him the president of Kagyu Minjur Choling, the first Kagyu Tibetan Buddhist dharma center in Marin County. In 1982, he was presented with a Zen Teaching Fan at Cho Sho-ji Zen Temple in Beppu, Japan. [...] Through the 1980s, Jaxon-Bear ran a Clinical Hypnosis and Neurolinguistics certification program at the Esalen Institute. Also during that time, he studied the ancient Sufi wisdom teachings of the Enneagram. His first writings and teachings on the Enneagram emerged in 1989. He was a keynote speaker at the first International Enneagram Conference at Stanford University in August, 1994. His talk was entitled “The Enneagram and Self-Realization”.|$|E
5000|$|I’ve spent 25 years {{heading off}} alone into deserts, and jungles and tundra; I’ve {{been to the}} last remote corners of our planet. Back in the 16th and 17th centuries, {{in the age of}} discovery, men set out to find whole new worlds. The 18th and 19th centuries was the era of exploration, when adventurers went to exploit these discoveries. The last century though was the age of the traveller, when the world was safe enough for {{individuals}} to make their own way, to set off and record their personal impressions; as it happens the British particularly loved to do this…But why, and what does this say about us? Is it a legacy of the British Empire? Or perhaps being members of only a small off-shore nation we’ve learnt that we need to study the curious ways of foreigners in order to survive.

5000|$|Early in his career, James H. Cromartie {{reports to}} have often {{surveyed}} the printed works of Andrew Wyeth {{for hours on}} end attempting to decode a technique so seamless it did not even bear the stroke of a brush. It would be years before Cromartie, confident that he had finally mastered Wyeth’s technique, actually stood in front of an original Wyeth only to find the canvas, so immaculately rendered in his books, covered in brush strokes. [...] Thus, in simply attempting to emulate Andrew Wyeth, James H. Cromartie inadvertently spawned Hard-Edge Realism, “launching him on a journey that would take him around <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>and</b> <b>into</b> the company of many of society’s elite.” James H. Cromartie, himself, while accepting the popular use of the term, Hard-Edge Realism, believes his style to be more correctly stated as “surrealistic impressionism.” [...] Cromartie, describes his work in Nantucket Portrait: Fun & Games with the Super Rich the Birth of Hard-Edge Realism thus, [...] “if you compare a photograph with my paintings you would see a great [...] difference. My lighting is better than real life. My composition is better [...] than real life. I add things to the painting that might not actually be there [...] if you took a photograph. Sometimes I leave things out that are there. My [...] paintings have emotion and feeling in them that cannot be captured on film." ...|$|E

5000|$|Judaism's {{purpose is}} to carry out what it holds {{to be the only}} Covenant between God and the Jewish people. The Torah (lit. [...] "teaching"), both written and oral, tell the story of this covenant, and {{provides}} Jews with the terms of the covenant. The Oral Torah is the primary guide for Jews to abide by these terms, as expressed in tractate Gittin 60b, [...] "the Holy One, Blessed be He, did not make His covenant with Israel except by virtue of the Oral Law" [...] to help them learn how to live a holy life, and to bring holiness, peace and love into <b>the</b> <b>world</b> <b>and</b> <b>into</b> every part of life, so that life may be elevated to a high level of kedushah, originally through study and practice of the Torah, and since the destruction of the Second Temple, through prayer as expressed in tractate Sotah 49a [...] "Since the destruction of the Temple, every day is more cursed than the preceding one; and the existence of the world is assured only by the kedusha...and the words spoken after the study of Torah." [...] Since the adoption of the Amidah, the acknowledgement of God through the declaration from Yishayah 6:3 [...] "Kadosh holy, kadosh, kadosh, is HaShem, Master of Legions; the whole world is filled with His glory". as a replacement for the study of Torah, which is a daily obligation for a Jew, and sanctifies God in itself. This continuous maintenance of relationship between the individual Jew and God through either study, or prayer repeated three times daily, is the confirmation of the original covenant. This allows the Jewish people as a community to strive and fulfill the prophecy [...] "I, the Lord, have called you in righteousness, and will hold your hand and keep you. And I will establish you as a Covenant of the people, for a light unto the nations." [...] (...)
