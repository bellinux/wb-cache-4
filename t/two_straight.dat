5|$|In March 2010, Mayor Daley {{nominated}} Chico {{as chairman}} of the board of trustees of the City Colleges of Chicago and the board elected Chico chairman. Along with Chancellor Cheryl Hyman, Chico reformed the City Colleges budget by laying off 225 employees, removing unfilled jobs, and reducing executive spending to increase spending on technology and training for students. Furthermore, Chico and Hyman reduced taxation on property for <b>two</b> <b>straight</b> years, and cancelled nursing programs. He resigned 8 months later to run for Mayor of Chicago.|$|E
50|$|Track cycling {{has been}} around since at least 1870. When cycling was in its infancy, wooden indoor tracks were laid which {{resemble}} those of modern velodromes, consisting of <b>two</b> <b>straights</b> and slightly banked turns.|$|R
50|$|A velodrome is {{an arena}} for track cycling. Modern velodromes feature steeply banked oval tracks, {{consisting}} of two 180-degree circular bends connected by <b>two</b> <b>straights.</b> The straights transition to the circular turn through a moderate easement curve.|$|R
50|$|In athletics, {{a typical}} 400 m track {{features}} <b>two</b> <b>straights</b> and <b>two</b> bends. The final straight before {{the finish line}} {{is known as the}} home straight, or the pit straight in Formula One, while the other is known as the back straight.|$|R
5|$|The French did {{not pursue}} the Austrians {{immediately}} {{because they were}} exhausted from <b>two</b> <b>straight</b> days of vicious fighting. After recuperating, they chased the Austrians and caught up with them at Znaim in mid-July. Here Charles signed an armistice with Napoleon and agreed to end the fighting. Military conflict between France and Austria was effectively ended, although a few more months of diplomatic wrangling were required to make the result official.|$|E
5|$|The {{first round}} of the 2012 Fed Cup saw three wins in the single competition, two of which were made by Kuznetsova, the first against Silvia Soler Espinosa, the second against Carla Suárez Navarro. The pair Kuznetsova/Petrova retired in their last match due to Kuznetsova's fatigue, but Russia still won in 3–2. Team Russia lost against the Serbian team in the semifinal, 2–3. Although winning the first match against Ana Ivanovic in three sets, Kuznetsova was later {{defeated}} by Jelena Janković in <b>two</b> <b>straight</b> sets.|$|E
5|$|Capcom auditioned {{actors to}} be used as {{references}} by the character designers. The faces of the main protagonists were shaped and based on real people, while motion capture was used to animate their models. About 60 percent of the characters' motions were animated based on the captured data, while the rest was created from scratch. The developers initially struggled to develop a system for computer graphic animation. However, Nintendo provided Capcom with assistance and the problems were eventually solved. Capcom also hired new voice actors and rewrote the game's script to make the plot more convincing. The game was developed over the course of one year and two months. Final development of the game was very intense, as programmers had to work for <b>two</b> <b>straight</b> months with no days off to meet the proposed deadline. Resident Evil was released in March 2002 in Japan, April 2002 in North America, and September 2002 in Europe.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The {{paper is}} divided into two parts. In the first one we present a survey about the theory of Darboux for the integrability of {{polynomial}} differential equations. In the second part we apply all mentioned results on Darboux theory to study the integrability of real quadratic systems having an invariant conic. The fact that <b>two</b> intersecting <b>straight</b> lines or <b>two</b> parallel <b>straight</b> lines are particular cases of conics al-lows us to study simultaneously the integrability of quadratic systems having at least <b>two</b> invariant <b>straight</b> lines. Key words: Integrability, quadratic differential systems, algebraic solutions...|$|R

Once again, they were eliminated in the first round and did not win a single game against the Dallas Mavericks.|$|E
5|$|Predictably, the Giants {{struggled}} {{to start the}} season. They were 2–2 when Taylor returned from his suspension. With Taylor back and playing well, however, they won six out of their next eight games. After <b>two</b> <b>straight</b> losses, the Giants won their next three contests {{to set up a}} win-or-go-home game against the Jets in the season finale. The Jets defeated the Giants 27–21. When the Eagles beat the Cowboys, and the 49ers lost to the Rams later that night, the Eagles won the NFC East and the Rams clinched the final Wild Card berth. The Giants finished {{on the outside looking in}} despite a 10–6 record, because in the tiebreakers, they were swept in the season series by Philadelphia and had a worse conference record than the Rams.|$|E

50|$|The {{measurement}} of the track is made half a meter into the lane. The total length of the track is the distance a competitor skates each lap, i.e. the length of <b>two</b> <b>straights,</b> one inner curve and one outer curve, {{in addition to the}} extra distance skated when changing lanes in the cross-over area, which on a standard track equals 7 centimeters.|$|R
5|$|The rig {{consisted}} of a Front of House truss, two three-quarter angled trusses, and <b>two</b> <b>straight</b> mid-stage trusses. These were all located up-stage, and had two sub-hung trusses directly below them. There were two Lycian Starklite medium-throw truss spots, and an accumulation of specialty lights. The specialty lights included 54 two-light Molefays, six PAR 36 rotating beacons, 24 Martin Atomic 300 Strobes, 2 six-light Molefays, and 10 four-light Molefays. The rig also had LED units, which can be very bright, and which shone into the audience. Throughout the tour, 65 Philips Color Kinetics ColorBlast 12s, seven Color Blaze 48s, and twelve CK ColorBlaze 72s were used to light up {{the wall behind the}} band.|$|E
5|$|The {{team was}} founded in 1883 as the Ottawa Senators, a {{successful}} independent team that joined the NHL as a charter member in 1917. From the mid-1920s onward, they endured financial strain caused, in part, by being in the NHL's smallest market. The financial problems forced the Senators to suspend operations for the 1931–32 season. Upon their return to play, having sold their better players {{in an effort to}} raise funds, the Senators finished in last place for <b>two</b> <b>straight</b> seasons and continued to lose money. Following the repeat last place finish, the team decided that it could not survive in Ottawa and hoped to move to a bigger market.|$|E
5|$|In early 1934 Plaa and Cochet {{went on to}} {{showcase}} in Rio de Janeiro where they were challenged by the Pilo Facondi and Perico Facondi brothers, Chile's leading professionals, who both lost their matches against Cochet but managed to win at least one set. Plaa and Cochet returned in February to the Madison Square Garden where Vines and Tilden were already practising and waiting for them. In a three-day round robin indoors tournament Vines and Tilden outclassed Cochet in a four and five-set match respectively and the Americans were victorious in the doubles over the French pair as well. They then {{set out on a}} ten-city tour across the United States and Canada where the Tilden-Cochet match was always the main fixture. Tilden finished the tour as winner by an eight to two head-to-head margin against Cochet. In April in Providence Cochet was drawn to play Vincent Richards in singles and with Plaa played Barnes and Richards, both matches resulted in a French <b>two</b> <b>straight</b> sets victory. The first official knock-out tournament was held in May at the Park Avenue Tennis Club, New York and was called the Eastern Pro Championships. Cochet was eliminated in the semifinals.|$|E

5|$|In {{the first}} inning, after {{striking}} out Earle Combs and Mark Koenig, Rhem {{gave up a}} solo home run to Babe Ruth. Bob Meusel was then walked, but was tagged out at home after attempting to score on a Lou Gehrig single. The Cardinals came {{into the bottom of}} the first with <b>two</b> <b>straight</b> singles to put runners at first and third base. Rogers Hornsby singled in Taylor Douthit to tie the game at 1–1 and moved Billy Southworth to second base. Jim Bottomley flied out to left field, and Les Bell followed with a sacrifice fly to center fielder Combs. With the go-ahead run at third base, Hornsby stole second, but Chick Hafey struck out to end to the Cardinals' run-scoring threat. Two innings later, Ruth came up to the plate with two outs and hit Rhem's pitch for a solo home run, his second of the game. Gehrig led off the next inning with a strikeout. Tony Lazzeri followed with a walk, and Joe Dugan hit a run-scoring double. Catcher Hank Severeid hit a single into center field, and Dugan ran towards home. He was tagged out at the plate by catcher Bob O'Farrell. The Yankees' starter Hoyt struck out to end the inning.|$|E
5|$|Two {{years after}} {{advancing}} to the finals, the Rockets traded Malone and had two losing seasons, with the first having a franchise-low 14 victories. This gave Houston <b>two</b> <b>straight</b> first overall picks, used to bring future Hall of Famers Ralph Sampson and Hakeem Olajuwon, who eventually got the Rockets {{all the way to}} the 1986 Finals, where they lost again to Boston. In the next seven seasons, they lost in the first round of the playoffs five times. They did not win their first championship until 1994, when Olajuwon led them to a franchise-best 58 wins, and the championship. The Rockets repeated the feat in 1995, but in the following seasons, they did not advance to the finals again. They missed the playoffs from 1999 to 2003, and did not reach the playoffs again until they drafted Yao Ming in 2003. However, they would not advance past the first round of the playoffs for 13 years. In the 2007–08 NBA season, the Rockets had their most successful campaign in the 2000s, winning 55 games, with 22 of those victories in a row, but still lost in the first round. The following season, the team managed to win a playoff series for the first time since 1997, defeating the Portland Trail Blazers in the first round of the 2009 NBA Playoffs and pushed the eventual champion Los Angeles Lakers to seven games in the 2009 Western Conference Semifinals.|$|E
5|$|In {{the first}} round of the French Open, Kuznetsova lost to Meghann Shaughnessy. She was also {{unsuccessful}} with Jared Palmer in the mixed doubles, losing to Nadia Petrova and Paul Haarhuis in the round of 16. Kuznetsova paired with Navratilova in the doubles match, but lost to Kim Clijsters and Ai Sugiyama in three sets in the quarter final.
