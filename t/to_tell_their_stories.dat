In a post-junta Chile where restrictions on free speech were steadily eroding, independent and seemingly reliable witnesses at last began <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>their</b> <b>stories</b> to the news media and to human rights researchers.

[...] In 1968, the house dissociated from the national fraternity, and adopted the name Chi Phi Heorot. [...] The [...] "Heorot" [...] in Chi Phi Heorot comes from the medieval poem Beowulf, in which Heorot is the great hall where warriors converge <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>their</b> <b>stories.</b> [...] After several suspensions by the college in the early 1980s, it re-joined the Chi Phi national in 1981. [...] This was short-lived; in 1987, because of damage done to the house that the college insisted upon having repaired for safety reasons but the Chi Phi national refused to help finance, the Dartmouth brotherhood again opted to become a local fraternity. [...] In exchange for financing renovations to the structure, the college assumed ownership of the property and house. [...] In its second incarnation as a local fraternity, the brotherhood chose the name Chi Heorot. Notable alumni include Gerry Geran '18, Adam Nelson '97, and Andrew Weibrecht '09, all Olympic medalists.|$|E

Dylan plugged an entire generation into the milieu of the singer-songwriter. Often writing from an urban point of view, with poetry punctuated by rock rhythms and electric power, Dylan's fusing of folk and rock freed up emerging singer-songwriters to use elements of both traditions <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>their</b> <b>stories.</b> In the mid- to late 1960s, bands and singer-songwriters began to proliferate the underground New York art/music scene.

2500|$|One of {{the main}} film genres {{associated}} with the Weimar Republic cinema is German Expressionism which {{was inspired by the}} expressionist movement in art. Expressionist movies relied heavily on symbolism and artistic imagery rather than stark realism <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>their</b> <b>stories.</b> Given the grim mood in post-WWI, it was not surprising that these films focused heavily on crime and horror. The film usually credited with sparking the popularity of expressionism is Robert Wiene's The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari (1920), produced by Erich Pommer. The film {{tells the story of a}} demented hypnotist who is using a sleepwalker to perform a series of murders. The film featured a dark and twisted visual style - the set was unrealistic with geometric images painted on the floor and shapes in light and shadow cast on walls, the acting was exaggerated and the costumes bizarre. These stylistic elements became trademarks of this cinematic movement. Other notable works of Expressionism are Friedrich Wilhelm Murnau's Nosferatu (1922), Carl Boese and Paul Wegener's [...] (1920) and Metropolis directed by Fritz Lang. The Expressionist movement began to wane during the mid-1920s, but perhaps the fact that its main creators moved to Hollywood, California, allowed this style to remain influential in world cinema for years to come, particularly in American horror films and film noir and in the works of European directors such as Jean Cocteau and Ingmar Bergman.|$|E
2500|$|In October 2010, The Forward {{reported}} on {{the current state of}} Jews and the level of antisemitism in Sweden. Henrik Bachner, a writer and {{professor of history at the}} University of Lund, claimed that members of the Swedish Parliament have attended anti-Israel rallies where the Israeli flag was burned while the flags of Hamas and Hezbollah were waved, and the rhetoric was often antisemitic—not just anti-Israel. But such public rhetoric is not branded hateful and denounced. Charles Small, director of the Yale University Initiative for the Study of Antisemitism, stated, [...] "Sweden is a microcosm of contemporary anti-Semitism. It's a form of acquiescence to radical Islam, which is diametrically opposed to everything Sweden stands for." [...] Per Gudmundson, chief editorial writer for Svenska Dagbladet, has sharply criticized politicians who he claims offer [...] "weak excuses" [...] for Muslims accused of antisemitic crimes. [...] "Politicians say these kids are poor and oppressed, and we have made them hate. They are, in effect, saying the behavior of these kids is in some way our fault." [...] Judith Popinski, and 86-year-old Holocaust survivor, stated that she is no longer invited to schools that have a large Muslim presence to tell her story of surviving the Holocaust. Popinski, who found refuge in Malmö in 1945, stated that, until recently, she told her story in Malmö schools as part of their Holocaust studies program, but that now, many schools no longer ask Holocaust survivors <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>their</b> <b>stories,</b> because Muslim students treat them with such disrespect, either ignoring the speakers or walking out of the class.
