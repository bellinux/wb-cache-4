5|$|His {{business}} interests having collapsed, Baker abandoned his farm and relocated from New South Wales {{to the southern}} settlement of Hobart in Van Diemen's Land. In 1814 he is recorded as holding the office of government storekeeper in Hobart. A year later, at an approximate age of 54, he accepted a job as town crier for the newly created Deputy Judge Advocate's Court, calling witnesses and announcing verdicts on the roadside outside the courthouse. Any remaining business links with New South Wales were severed in 1819 with the sale of Baker's former farm <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>colleague,</b> Samuel Terry, who had recently visited him in Hobart. His wife, Elizabeth Baker, died in April 1824 and was buried in Hobart Cemetery.|$|E
5|$|In 1937 Reich {{began an}} affair with a female patient, an actress who had been married <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>colleague</b> of his. According to Sigurd Hoel, the {{analysis}} would stop because of the relationship, then the relationship would end and the analysis would start up again. The patient eventually threatened to go to the press, but was persuaded that it would harm her as much as it would Reich. Around the same time, Reich also had {{an affair with}} Gerd Bergersen, a 25-year-old Norwegian textile designer.|$|E

5|$|Judge Vanaskie instead found {{guidance}} from the Supreme Court's 1994 holding in Waters v. Churchill, {{in which it}} had upheld an Illinois public hospital's dismissal of a nurse for her comments about a supervisor <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>colleague,</b> despite an ongoing factual dispute about the substance of those comments. The Court found that the hospital administration had made a reasonable attempt to investigate what the nurse had said before firing her. In that case, the Court had said explicitly that disciplining employees for things they did not actually do did not {{rise to the level}} of a constitutional violation.|$|E
25|$|In 1932, Albizu {{published}} a letter accusing Dr. Cornelius P.

25|$|The Catholic Counter-Reformation group, {{founded by}} theologian , takes the {{position}} that the released text is the complete Third Secret, but refers to Pope John Paul I rather than John Paul II, pointing out that the latter, after all, did not die when he was attacked, while the bishop in the Third Secret did. John Paul I had met Lúcia Santos while he was Patriarch of Venice, and was deeply moved by the experience. In a letter <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>colleague</b> after his election, he vowed to perform the Consecration of Russia which Lúcia said Mary had asked for.|$|E
25|$|After {{completing}} his national service, Book returned his bricklaying job in Bath and started playing for Frome Town. During the 1955–56 season Frome suffered financial difficulties, and sent letters to all their players permitting {{them to leave}} if they wished. Book showed his letter <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>colleague,</b> who played for Bath City of the Southern League. He in turn informed the Bath chairman, and Book signed for the club in January 1956. He spent {{seven and a half}} years at Bath, becoming captain {{in the latter part of}} his Bath career, and winning the Southern League title in 1960. In the 1962 close season, Malcolm Allison became Bath manager, beginning a long association between the two.|$|E
25|$|Cabot went to Bristol {{to arrange}} {{preparations}} for his voyage. Bristol was the second-largest seaport in England. From 1480 onward it had supplied several expeditions {{to look for}} Hy-Brazil. According to Celtic legend, this island lay somewhere in the Atlantic Ocean. There was widespread belief among merchants in the port that Bristol men had discovered the island at earlier date but then lost track of it. Note: Ruddock had contended in a private 1988 letter <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>colleague,</b> Quinn, that she had found evidence in Italian archives that Bristol men had discovered North America pre-1470. As the island {{was believed to be}} a source of brazilwood (from which a valuable red dye could be obtained), merchants had economic incentive to find it.|$|E

25|$|Wilson {{was also}} given the honorary {{appointment}} of Colonel of the Royal Irish Rifles on 11 November 1915, and {{was made a}} Commander and later Grand Officier of the Légion d'honneur for his services. Wilson attended the Anglo-French Chantilly Conference (6–8 December 1915) along with Murray (CIGS), French and Robertson, as well as Joffre, Maurice Pellé and Victor Huguet for France, Zhilinski and Ignatieff for Russia, Cadorna for Italy and a Serb and Belgian representative. Wilson disapproved of large meetings – a view he shared with Joffre – and thought the British and French War Ministers, C-in-Cs and foreign ministers (6 men in total) should meet regularly which might discourage ventures like Antwerp, Gallipoli and Salonika. During the conference Wilson passed a note <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>colleague</b> describing it as “a mass meeting between two vomits”.|$|E
25|$|The Labor Party {{replaced}} Rudd with Julia Gillard in 2010 {{owing to}} Rudd's unpopularity both among his frontbench and the public, so then Julia Gillard {{became the first}} woman prime minister in Australian history. Following the 2010 Election, Labor secured office in the first hung parliament since the 1940 election. The Gillard Government struggled on multiple policy fronts, trying to wrestle with a hung parliament. A scandal rocked the parliament: Speaker of the House Peter Slipper, who was a former Liberal Party member turned Labor ally, had sent sexually suggestive messages <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>colleague.</b> This resulted in his removal. Opposition to Gillard's government following her misogyny speech intensified. Leadership rivalry continued and Kevin Rudd was reinstated as prime minister in a Labor leadership spill on 27 June 2013. At the 2013 Election, the Second Rudd Government lost office and the Liberal-National Abbott Government formed.|$|E
500|$|It was Rudolf Camerarius (1665–1721) who was {{the first}} to {{establish}} plant sexuality conclusively by experiment.

500|$|Ludwig van Beethoven {{admired the}} concerto {{and it may}} have {{influenced}} his Piano Concerto No. 3, also in C minor. After hearing the work in a rehearsal, Beethoven reportedly remarked <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>colleague</b> that [...] "e shall never be able to do anything like that." [...] Johannes Brahms also admired the concerto, encouraging Clara Schumann to play it, and wrote his own cadenza for the first movement. Brahms referred to the work as a [...] "masterpiece of art and full of inspired ideas." ...|$|E
500|$|During the Manhattan Project, Teller {{advocated}} {{the development of}} a bomb using uranium hydride, which many of his fellow theorists said would be unlikely to work. At Livermore, Teller continued work on the hydride bomb, and the result was a dud. Ulam once wrote <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>colleague</b> about an idea he had shared with Teller: [...] "Edward is full of enthusiasm about these possibilities; this is perhaps an indication they will not work." [...] Fermi once said that Teller was the only monomaniac he knew who had several manias.|$|E
500|$|In {{a letter}} <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>colleague</b> dated November 18, 1938, film {{producer}} David O. Selznick wrote, [...] "I would give anything {{if we had}} Olivia deHavilland under contract to us {{so that we could}} cast her as Melanie." [...] The film he was preparing to shoot was Gone with the Wind, and Jack L. Warner was unwilling to lend her out for the project. DeHavilland had read the novel, and unlike most other actresses, who wanted the Scarlett O'Hara role, she wanted to play Melanie Hamiltona character whose quiet dignity and inner strength she understood and felt she could bring to life on the screen.|$|E

500|$|After a month's time, {{as early}} adopters started {{receiving}} their first monthly bills, stories of unusually large and expensive iPhone bills began to circulate. The 300-page bill was exceptional, but other heavy users received 50- to 100-page bills. One {{of the first}} to attract wider attention was from Ben Kuchera, gaming editor for the technology-related website Ars Technica, who described his 34-sheet, double-sided bill and another 104-page bill sent <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>colleague,</b> writing, [...] "While many of us have had smart-phones for some time, we've never seen a bill like this." [...] However, it was the release of Justine Ezarik's video that acted as a catalyst to bring widespread media attention to this aspect of the iPhone story.|$|E
500|$|On 12 November 1975, the First Fraser Ministry {{was sworn}} in by Kerr.

[...] According to those accounts, Senator Margaret Guilfoyle laughed and said <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>colleague,</b> [...] "That's all he knows." [...] Guilfoyle later stated that, if she did make such a remark, it {{was not meant to}} imply that the Coalition senators would have broken. However, Kelly lists four Coalition senators who stated, in subsequent years, that they would have crossed the floor and voted for the appropriation bills.|$|E
500|$|The fresh trial, {{scheduled}} for 20 May, was postponed when the prosecutor {{announced that he}} was not ready. The delay gave MacGregor and Merilhou time to prepare an elaborate, largely fictional 5,000-word statement purporting to describe the Scotsman's background, activities in the Americas, and total innocence of any endeavour to defraud. When the trial finally began on 10 July 1826, Merilhou was present not as MacGregor's defence counsel but as a witness for the prosecution, having been called as such because of his links with the Nouvelle Neustrie company. Merilhou entrusted MacGregor's defence <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>colleague</b> called Berville, who read the 5,000-word submission in full before the court. [...] "Maître Merilhou, as the author of the address the court had heard, and Maître Berville, as the actor who read the script, had done their work extremely well," [...] Sinclair writes; Lehuby was convicted of making false representations regarding the sale of shares, and sentenced to 13 months' imprisonment, but the Cazique was found not guilty on all charges, while the imputations against Hippisley and Irving were stricken from the record.|$|E
