25|$|After Maudgalyāyana's and Śāriputra's death, the Buddha {{stated the}} monastic {{community}} had now become less, {{just like a}} healthy tree had some branches that died off. <b>Then</b> <b>he</b> <b>added</b> to that all impermanent things must perish. In some accounts of Maudgalyāyana's death, many of his students fell ill after his death, and died as well.|$|E
25|$|Savannah's {{existing}} Fort Jackson, {{about three}} miles downriver from the city, was supplemented with two additional batteries. Defenders built fire barges. Lee first placed a battery at Causton’s Bluff commanding navigable estuaries leading to the Savannah River behind Fort Pulaski. <b>Then</b> <b>he</b> <b>added</b> another battery situated farther upriver on Elba Island, blocking all river approach to Savannah. The Union naval commander, Admiral Samuel F. Du Pont, conducted a reconnaissance of Lee's system of defense upriver. When the commanding military general, Gen. Thomas W. Sherman, insisted on forcing Lee's riverine batteries against Du Pont's recommendation, Thomas Sherman {{was transferred to the}} western theater and replaced by General David Hunter.|$|E
500|$|Despite Harrison's claims {{during the}} tour that the {{negative}} press only {{made him more}} determined, the criticism hit him hard, {{following the end of}} his marriage to Pattie Boyd. In a radio interview with Dave Herman of WNEW-FM in April 1975, recorded in Los Angeles, Harrison said that he accepted the validity of professional criticism, but objected when it came continually from [...] "one basic source"; <b>then,</b> <b>he</b> <b>added,</b> it became [...] "a personal thing". Author Simon Leng writes that the [...] "bitterness and dismay" [...] Harrison felt manifested itself on his follow-up to Dark Horse, titled Extra Texture (Read All About It), which would be the final studio album issued on the Beatles' Apple record label.|$|E

5000|$|His letter goes on {{to outline}} at length the general eschatological {{framework}} of Buddhist belief. <b>Then</b> <b>he</b> <b>adds,</b> “By the way, a problem given by the Zens for meditation is the following: If you clap your hands, does the sound come from the left hand or from the right?” ...|$|R
500|$|American {{recording}} artist Kanye West {{also contributed to}} three tracks on the album; Madonna called him [...] "the black Madonna" [...] and said, [...] "We're comrades in the envelope-pushing genre". Madonna said, [...] "It's {{a little bit of}} a bullfight, but we take turns. He knows that he's walking into a room with a person with a strong point of view, and I do, too. I listen to what he has to say, take it in, and he listens to what I say and takes it in. We didn't agree on everything, but he has good ideas." [...] She told Rolling Stone that of the songs she played him, West connected the most with [...] "Illuminati" [...] and that, [...] "e loved the melody, and he was actually jumping up and down on the soundboard. He literally stood on top of the mixing board—we were worried he was going to hit his head on the ceiling, but he didn't. He ended up being very excited about that track, and <b>then</b> <b>he</b> <b>added</b> his spin to it, musically, and I love it. To me, he elevated the lyrics with the music. It's like a siren, alerting people." [...] In December 2014, thirteen demos of tracks for the album, including [...] "Illuminati", were leaked to the Internet. To avoid further leaks, Madonna released six completed tracks, including the final version of [...] "Illuminati" [...] with the addition of West's writing and production, with the pre-order for the album on the iTunes Store on December 20, 2014, as an [...] "early Christmas gift".|$|E
2500|$|During an {{exchange}} with Donald Rumsfeld in the 2004 senate {{hearing on the}} Abu Ghraib scandal, Lieberman denounced the abuses as [...] "immoral" [...] and deserving of an apology. <b>Then</b> <b>he</b> <b>added,</b> [...] "I cannot help but say, however, that those who were responsible for killing 3,000 Americans on September 11th, 2001, never apologized. Those who have killed hundreds of Americans in uniform in Iraq working to liberate Iraq and protect our security have never apologized." ...|$|E
2500|$|On October 23, 2013, bassist Greg K. told May the Rock Be With You {{that the}} Offspring had been [...] "working {{on a couple}} of singles", but was unsure what they were [...] "going to do with them." [...] <b>Then</b> <b>he</b> <b>added,</b> [...] "As far as a full scale album there's nothing in the works, if we do {{something}} it wouldn't be until at least next year, but we're still moving forward and still going to keep trying to put out new stuff." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "As it happens, he did," [...] said Ethel. [...] "He {{describes}} the cold as fierce, and gives some interesting {{details of his}} sensations when the warmth first comes back to his half-frozen hands or limbs; <b>then</b> <b>he</b> <b>adds</b> a vivid account of a blizzard that George and he nearly got lost in." ...|$|R

In the end he calls her: [...] "Come close to me. Let yourself go".|$|R
2500|$|Aaron Titan from [...] {{gave the}} album a {{positive}} review, awarding it {{eight and a}} half stars out of ten, stating [...] "It’s definitely better than IV", <b>then</b> <b>he</b> <b>added,</b> [...] "The album kind of rides out the awesomeness of that track with Saints and Sinners and War and Peace and then climbs with the off-beat Love-Hate-Sex-Pain." [...] He also praised the band for choosing [...] "The Oracle" [...] to be the last track, stating [...] "This is a slamming instrumental that was a fantastic choice to close out the album." ...|$|E
2500|$|Scott Ward of Sea of Tranquility {{gave the}} album {{extremely}} positive review, awarding it {{four and a}} half stars out of five, and stating [...] "There is so much good on this album from top to bottom {{that it is hard to}} find any fault with it at all. This one is just great music from start to finish. Sully has given us a special treat that is meant to be savored.", <b>then</b> <b>he</b> <b>added,</b> [...] "As good as the Godsmack album was earlier this year, this one is a much more powerful musical statement" ...|$|E
2500|$|Scott McLennan from The Boston Globe {{commented that}} the album has [...] "fresh moments, such as the scrappy {{delivery}} of What If and the up-tempo snap of War and Peace", <b>then</b> <b>he</b> <b>added,</b> [...] "On the few occasions that he is freed from formulaic constraints, guitarist Tony Rombola effectively knocks some texture into these otherwise slick and efficient songs. Godsmack also sticks to its stock songwriting topics — spiritual angst, mental torment, and social discomfort. The Oracle certainly reiterates all that has made Godsmack a successful band, and it proves that these locally bred players are capable of big-sounding, attention-grabbing music." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Thank you. You {{have done}} everything,' {{returned}} Leonard, quietly; 'and--' <b>then</b> pausing, <b>he</b> <b>added,</b> 'I know the day now--the day after my birthday.' ...|$|R

6000|$|<b>Then</b> <b>he</b> sighed, <b>adding,</b> [...] "You see, Arbuthnot, {{we have to}} {{take things}} as we find them in this world and hope for a better." ...|$|R
2500|$|Colin McNamara of Reflection of Darkness {{gave the}} album nine stars of ten, stating [...] "For Godsmack fans {{who felt that}} their latest album, The Oracle, was a letdown {{due to a lack}} of tribal/spiritual influences, Avalon is the perfect remedy for that.", <b>then</b> <b>he</b> <b>added,</b> [...] "Every song is a spiritual journey that doesn’t preach religion, just the stuff of life. Erna {{certainly}} respects his Wicca/ pagan beliefs, but his ultimate goal with Avalon was to connect his own life through readers in numerous ways, not his religious practices. Definitely worth looking into for those who like new age or acoustic music with strong messages." ...|$|E
2500|$|Queen's {{subsequent}} {{album was}} Innuendo, on which May's contributions increased, although more in arrangements than actual writing in most cases; {{for the title}} track he {{did some of the}} arrangement for the heavy solo, <b>then</b> <b>he</b> <b>added</b> vocal harmonies to [...] "I'm Going Slightly Mad" [...] and composed the solo of [...] "These Are the Days of Our Lives", a song for which the four of them decided the keyboard parts together. He changed the tempo and key of Mercury's song [...] "The Hitman" [...] and took it under his wing, even singing guide vocal in the demo. May also co-wrote some of the guitar lines in [...] "Bijou".|$|E
2500|$|In a 1950 {{interview}} with journalist Edward R. Murrow, Arnold reported seeing similar objects on three other occasions, and said other pilots {{flying in the}} northwestern U.S. had sighted such objects {{as many as eight}} times. The pilots initially felt a duty reporting the objects despite the ridicule, he said, because they thought the U.S. government didn't know what they were. Arnold did not assert that the objects were alien spacecraft, although he did say: [...] "being a natural-born American, if it's not made by our science or our Army Air Forces, I am inclined to believe it's of an extraterrestrial origin." [...] <b>Then</b> <b>he</b> <b>added</b> that he thought everybody should be concerned, but [...] "I don't think it's anything for people to get hysterical about." ...|$|E

It'll drive {{himself out of the}} house maybe, bad cess to him, and him stayin' half the night. (Nora waits to hear no more but darts back, {{shutting}} the door behind her. Billy takes the chair in front of the table. Carmody sits down again with a groan.) The rheumatics are in my leg again. (Shakes his head.) If Eileen's in bed long those brats'll have the house down.|$|R
6000|$|Read {{the first}} chapter of Genesis without prejudice, and you will be {{convinced}} at once. After the narrative of the creation of the earth and brute animals, Moses seems to pause, and says:--"And God said, Let us make man in our image, after our likeness." [...] And in the next chapter, he repeats the narrative:--"And the Lord God formed man of the dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life;" [...] and <b>then</b> <b>he</b> <b>adds</b> these words,--"and man became a living soul." [...] Materialism will never explain those last words.|$|R
2500|$|<b>Then</b> <b>he</b> <b>adds,</b> [...] "Like I said, when I said collaborative, on the {{new record}} we did this all four of us in a room. Like all four, we'll play a riff, I'll come in with the drums, and {{next thing you know}} were jamming, and then it sounds like a verse, or a chorus or {{breakdown}} part. And then we'll stop. [...] "Alright, man, we got a great verse, let's try to get a chorus for it." [...] So, you know, that's how the process goes. So it is a full band collaboration, much more than ever." ...|$|R
2500|$|Just a {{week before}} this new wave of {{international}} controversy began, U.N. Secretary General Ban Ki-moon had commented that several U.N. agencies were conducting {{a comprehensive review of}} the policy on biofuels, as the world food price crisis might trigger global instability. He said [...] "We need {{to be concerned about the}} possibility of taking land or replacing arable land because of these biofuels", <b>then</b> <b>he</b> <b>added</b> [...] "While I am very much conscious and aware of these problems, at the same time you need to constantly look at having creative sources of energy, including biofuels. Therefore, at this time, just criticising biofuel may not be a good solution. I would urge we need to address these issues in a comprehensive manner." [...] Regarding Jean Ziegler's proposal for a five-year ban, the U.N. Secretary rejected that proposal.|$|E
2500|$|Allmusic {{was one of}} {{the first}} {{websites}} to comment on The Oracle, with their reviewer Jason Ankeny describing the album' as [...] "the most aggressive disc Godsmack have issued since their debut", awarding it three stars out of five, and praising it for being a return to the band original sound, stating, [...] "The Oracle is, if nothing else, a return to the band’s signature sound of yore. It seems as if Godsmack heard the cry of their dedicated hoard and went back to making the kind of record that defined them.", <b>then</b> <b>he</b> <b>added,</b> [...] "Those fans seeking a return to Godsmack’s roots will not be disappointed; for others, the sound may be a retrenchment because there was no place else for them to go. The only undebatable thing is that The Oracle is the most aggressive disc Godsmack have issued since their debut." ...|$|E
2500|$|As the war {{wound down}} in spring 1945, the Germans disbanded the Muldorf camp {{and sent the}} inmate {{population}} on yet another death march, chasing them {{from place to place}} without food or rest. Sometimes they were loaded aboard rail cars and driven to and fro. On Friday, April 27, the train suddenly stopped in a small town and SS officers jumped aboard, declaring, [...] "You are free!" [...] and ripping the insignia from their uniforms. Many prisoners believed them and jumped off the train. But Halberstam told the people around him, [...] "Today is the eve of Shabbat. Where will we go?" [...] <b>Then</b> <b>he</b> <b>added,</b> [...] "My heart tells me that not everything here is as it should be." [...] Suddenly, SS soldiers rode in on bicycles from all directions, firing machine guns and killing hundreds of people. At the same time, American bombers dove in, strafing the field. Only Halberstam and those who stayed with him on the train escaped injury. Two days later, their real liberation came when the train stopped near a village and the Nazi guards deserted them. American soldiers boarded the train with smiles, candy and chocolates.|$|E
