40|$|Introduction The Committee inquired {{into the}} administration, {{transparency}} {{and effectiveness of}} the Register of Environmental Organisations under the Income Tax Assessment Act 1997. In seeking to improve the natural environment, many not-for-profit environmental organisations work hand-in-hand with communities across Australia. Much of this work relies on the generous financial contributions of members and supporters. Often these donations are tax-deductible, which recognises the public good that comes from environmental work. As such, public trust and confidence in the tax-concessional arrangements for environmental organisations is essential. The public should be assured that tax concessions are granted appropriately. Similarly, donors should be assured that their donations are distributed and used in line with their expectations. This inquiry considered the administration and <b>transparency</b> of the <b>Register</b> of Environmental Organisations, which is the Commonwealth scheme to enable eligible environmental organisations to receive tax-deductible donations. Consistent with the terms of reference, {{the focus of the}} inquiry was on the effectiveness of the Register in supporting communities to undertake practical action to improve the environment. In preparing the report of the inquiry, the Committee has identified measures to strengthen the integrity of tax-concessional arrangements for environmental organisations. The Committee has also identified scope to streamline the administration of the system. The recommendations outlined in the report are intended to make the system clearer for donors, environmental organisations, and the wider community...|$|R
40|$|The Italian {{property}} market, {{compared to}} other European markets, is not well established. It {{is dominated by the}} two major cities of Rome and Milan and, within those cities, the principal property investments available are offices and retail. In the residential sector, the 80 % of families own their house, so that the investments in this sector are very limited. There has been a period of sustained growth in the market {{since the end of the}} 1990 s and the timing of the introduction of funds in 1999 coincided with the upward trend of the property cycle. Capital value growth has been strong in all sectors, as has income return on the commercial real estate sector. The nature of the Italian market meant that it experienced significant growth from a relatively low base level. However, the lack of maturity also makes it is difficult to judge performance against an established benchmark due to data issues and the lack of transparency. Within the Jones Lang LaSalle global <b>transparency</b> index, Italy <b>registered</b> a significant improvement in its transparency score. The main issue is a paucity of available information at a national level and while there are many local databases of price information for all sectors and some national databases relating to rents and market value, none of these are complete performance indices showing full return information. In the contribution we discuss the introduction of Italian Property Funds and Reits and what they changed in the property sector...|$|R

50|$|In {{the context}} of the European Transparency Initiative, which was {{introduced}} in 2005 by EU Commissioner Siim Kallas, the European Commission introduced the voluntary register of lobbyists in the European Union on 23 June 2008. The so-called Transparency-register of both European Parliament and EU Commission was established three years later, on the 23 of June 2011. The registration is not mandatory, however, it is a precondition to accreditation and physical access to buildings of the European Parliament. The objective of the joint <b>transparency</b> <b>register</b> is to increase transparency of the EU lobbying system by enabling public inspection of the lobbying process itself, including an insight on who the lobbyists are, that try to shape EU governance, and whose interests they represent. Organisations as well as private actors and individuals can register in one of the six broadly composed categories of the <b>Transparency</b> <b>Register.</b> These include law firms, trade and professional associations, non-governmental-organisations (NGOs) and organisations which represent interests of local, regional or communal authorities and other public institutions. Moreover, during the process of registration the applicant must provide certain information which is published on the website of the <b>Transparency</b> <b>Register</b> by the European Union. These include the main office, the particular ambition, mission and interests, memberships, clients and an estimate of financial resources including received EU funding. By registering, applicants agree to a unitary code of conduct.|$|E

5000|$|The <b>Transparency</b> <b>Register</b> is a {{voluntary}} lobbyist register operated {{jointly by the}} European Parliament and the EU-Commission since June 2011. Its coverage extends beyond lobbyists to law firms, NGOs, and think tanks, and it includes information on staff numbers, the legislative proposals they have attempted to influence, {{and the amount of}} EU funding they have received. It should be appealing that only registered lobbyists are granted passes that ease access to the parliament. As maximum means of sanction a commented deletion of the entry out of the registry and a withdrawal of the access pass is possible.The transparency gained by this register is seen as minor, since entries are voluntary, were drawn back arbitrarily by lobbyist in the past and incorrect information (which the co-signed code of conduct [...] does not officially allow) is not sanctioned in practice. The register is however in an evaluation phase and there is the prospect of further improvement.The European Parliament is still working to transform it into a mandatory register, while the EU Commission is reluctant. First the reason given for this was {{that there would be no}} juristic basis. After a legal study disproved this, the EU-Commission agreed that it was juristically possible, but stated that the current voluntary approach was sufficient. The need for a mandatory EU <b>transparency</b> <b>register</b> has also been highlighted by the anti-corruption organisation, Transparency International [...] which has argued for the need to create a robust and credible mandatory register which would serve to increase the public trust in the EU institutions.|$|E
