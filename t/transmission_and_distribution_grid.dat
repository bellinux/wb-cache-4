40|$|AbstractIn this paper, the {{simultaneous}} optimization of <b>transmission</b> <b>and</b> <b>distribution</b> <b>grid</b> has been proposed. The dynamic {{model of the}} grid consists of turbine governors (TG), automatic voltage regulators (AVR) as well as wind turbines, solar power units and energy storage units. Grid stability is obtained by line stability and voltage stability indices and also by conducting eigenvalue analysis of the complete power system grid. Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm adjusts the grid control settings (active and reactive power management) to maximize the renewable penetration at all layers of the grid. IEEE 14 bus system {{in conjunction with a}} micro grid is used as the test system. The results demonstrate that simultaneous reactive power management of <b>transmission</b> <b>and</b> <b>distribution</b> <b>grid</b> can maximize the renewable penetration at transmission and distribution layers of the grid. However different case studies with different renewable power pro-files at each layer of the grid are remained to be optimized, this study recommends that real-time management of reactive power at all layers of the grid can be a good candidate to deal with intermittency of renewable sources...|$|E
30|$|Traditionally, the {{transmission}} grid VSA {{and the distribution}} grid VSA are implemented by the upper level transmission control center and the lower level distribution control centers respectively and separately.

30|$|There {{are several}} {{technological}} challenges {{in solving the}} global power flow problem. Firstly, the <b>transmission</b> <b>and</b> <b>distribution</b> <b>grids</b> are operated <b>and</b> managed by different control centers in existing dispatch and control system of power grid. The models of TPSs and DNs are maintained separately and transferring models is against privacy protection rules, so {{it is hard to}} directly solve a whole power flow model in the field. Secondly, the <b>transmission</b> <b>and</b> <b>distribution</b> <b>grids</b> are different in voltage level, topology structure and impedance parameters, which would lead to numerical difficulties. Thirdly, the size of the integrated power system is considerably large. In addition, the three-phase unbalanced characteristic of the <b>distribution</b> <b>grids</b> is prominent while the transmission grids are balanced. A “master-slave-splitting” (MSS) based method was proposed in [5, 6]. By decomposing the global power flow into a single transmission power flow master sub-problem <b>and</b> multiple <b>distribution</b> power flow sub-problems, this method addresses the above challenges effectively.|$|R

This paper presents a distributed continuation power flow method for VSA of global <b>transmission</b> <b>and</b> <b>distribution</b> <b>grid.</b> Two different parameterization schemes are adopted to guarantee the coherence of load growth in transmission and distribution grids. In the correction step, the boundary bus voltage, load parameter and equivalent power are communicated between the transmission and distribution control centers to realize the distributed computation of load margin. The optimal multiplier technique is used to improve the convergence of the proposed method. The three-phase unbalanced characteristic of distribution networks and the reactive capability limits of DGs are considered.

Attaining this target poses a considerable challenge as the electricity sector is “locked” into a carbon-intensive system, which hampers the adoption of RES-E technologies.
