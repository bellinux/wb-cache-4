25|$|Pere Maire, the Provicaire of the Roman Catholic Mission here, called <b>this</b> <b>morning</b> <b>to</b> {{show me a}} {{telegram}} which he had just received from a native priest of his Mission at Tali. The telegram, which is in Latin, is dated Tali, the 24th April, and is {{to the effect that}} the lamas of Batang have killed PP. Musset and Soulie, together with, it is believed, 200 converts. The chapel at Atentse has been burnt down, and the lamas hold the road to Tachien-lu. Pere Bourdonnec (another member of the French Tibet Mission) begs that Pere Maire will take action.|$|E
500|$|On 1 September 1917, Kerensky {{declared}} Russia a republic. Michael {{wrote in}} his diary: [...] "We woke up <b>this</b> <b>morning</b> <b>to</b> hear Russia declared a Republic. What does it matter which form the government will be {{as long as there}} is order and justice?" [...] Two weeks later, Michael's house arrest was lifted. Kerensky had armed the Bolsheviks after a power struggle with the commander-in-chief and in October there was a second revolution as the Bolsheviks seized power from Kerensky. With a permit to travel issued by Peter Polotsov, a former colleague of Michael from the Savage Division who was now a commander in Petrograd, Michael planned to move his family to the greater safety of Finland. They packed valuables and prepared to move, but their preparations were seen by Bolshevik sympathisers and they were placed once more under house arrest. The last of Michael's cars were seized by the Bolsheviks.|$|E
500|$|The album's opening {{series of}} songs have {{straightforward}} lyrics. On [...] "Back to Love", Bilal flatters his date's shoes and {{is backed by}} a bubbling funk groove. The song draws on the music of Prince, while the jazz guitar licks of [...] "Winning Hand" [...] draw on Steely Dan. [...] "Climbing" [...] has a rugged beat and a lyrical allusion to The Notorious B.I.G.'s 1993 song [...] "Party and Bullshit". The middle section of the album explores broader emotions and themes of loss and lament. [...] "Slipping Away" [...] is a slow-building meditation on loss, with sentimental music backing the narrator's plea to a departing love. On the slow burning pop rock song [...] "Lost for Now", he comes to terms with being alone and leaves town, but finds salvation in [...] "a smile that changes everything" [...] as the song closes with a shimmer of cymbal. The stark ballad [...] "Butterfly" [...] is built around Bilal's soaring falsetto and Glasper's rippling piano. Its music explores jazz, and also features dreamy Moog accents. The album closes with lyrics about the promise of tomorrow: [...] "Woke up <b>this</b> <b>morning</b> <b>to</b> {{the sound of a}} bluebird singing / Suddenly I knew just where to begin / Something so simple / How can it speak so loud to me?" ...|$|E
