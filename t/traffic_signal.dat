5|$|Between 1927 and 1953, Route 83 {{was a part}} of Route 49, which {{originally}} ran {{south of}} Millville along Route 47 between Millville and South Dennis and along the entire length of Route 83. In 1953, the route became Route 83 when Route 49 was realigned to follow what was then Route 47 between Millville and Tuckahoe and Route 47 was aligned to follow Route S49 between South Dennis and Wildwood. In 2007, the state completed reconstruction of the intersection with Route 47 to include a <b>traffic</b> <b>signal.</b> A school bus accident has prompted the New Jersey Department of Transportation (NJDOT) to install a <b>traffic</b> <b>signal</b> at the Y intersection of Route 83 and US 9.|$|E
5|$|Caltrans {{proposed}} {{the installation of}} a metered <b>traffic</b> <b>signal</b> on I-8 west in Lakeside during 1987, {{in order to improve}} traffic flow in the mornings by inserting a short delay before entering San Diego should the rate exceed 2,000vehicles per hour. However, the state put its plans on hold shortly thereafter, following several concerns from the public, and from state senator Jim Ellis.|$|E
5|$|In 2006, the New York State Department of Transportation (NYSDOT) {{converted}} NY376's intersections {{with the}} main gate of Vassar College and College Avenue into roundabouts. Both of the roundabouts replaced traffic lights. A <b>traffic</b> <b>signal</b> used to control traffic for a pedestrian crosswalk was also removed {{as part of their}} construction. Another roundabout was constructed in 2008 at Fulton and Collegeview Avenues. NYSDOT has called the installation of roundabouts a success, stating that it has significantly calmed traffic, decreased congestion and increased traffic flow.|$|E

50|$|In 2011, the {{intersection}} of Centennial Drive & Main Street received the first <b>traffic</b> <b>signals</b> in Martensville's history. Five years later, the city installed <b>traffic</b> <b>signals</b> at Centennial Drive and 3rd Street North.|$|R
5|$|In March 2009, {{construction}} {{began on}} {{the reconstruction of the}} bridge that carries MD 139 (Charles Street) over I-695. The bridge will be decorative, featuring ornamental street lights. As part of the MD 139 project, the interchange will be reconstructed and the traffic circle at the MD 139/I-695 ramps will be removed and replaced with a <b>traffic</b> <b>signal.</b> This project is expected to cost $50 million and be completed in 2012.|$|E
5|$|North of Modena, the {{surrounding}} area becomes slightly more wooded near where NY32 crosses into the Town of New Paltz. The highway curves before entering the village next to the campus of State University of New York at New Paltz. Two blocks north of campus, at New Paltz Middle School, it turns west at a <b>traffic</b> <b>signal</b> to join NY299 as the village's Main Street.|$|E
5|$|With the {{construction}} of the extensions and connecting turnpikes, the highway was envisioned {{to be a part of}} a system of toll roads stretching from Maine to Chicago. When the Delaware River Bridge was completed in 1956, a motorist could drive from New York City to Indiana on limited-access toll roads. By 1957, it was possible to drive from New York City to Chicago without encountering a <b>traffic</b> <b>signal.</b>|$|E
50|$|In {{many parts}} of Western Europe transit signals (for trams, {{and in some cases}} buses as well) employ <b>traffic</b> <b>signals</b> that are phased {{similarly}} to main <b>traffic</b> <b>signals</b> but replace the green light with a vertical white bar, the red light with a horizontal white bar and the yellow with a white dot or diamond. This is intended to avoid confusion between transit <b>signals</b> and main <b>traffic</b> <b>signals</b> at intersections where both sets are visible.|$|R

5|$|The {{construction}} of the Emerald Drive interchange was scheduled for the year 1971. While the El Camino Real interchange was already a diamond interchange, the state planned to add traffic signals to the ramps to accommodate more congestion from the nearby mall. The Emerald Drive interchange was completed in September, {{and the rest of}} the project was to be completed by the end of the year, leaving Jefferson Drive as the only remaining <b>traffic</b> <b>signal.</b> Construction on the Jefferson Street interchange began in early 1972; the section from I-5 east to Melrose Drive (along the routing of the Vista Way Freeway) had been upgraded to full freeway standards as of 1973.|$|E
5|$|The {{street is}} one of the key bus {{corridors}} in Central London. It is used by London bus routes 2, 10, 13, 16, 36, 73, 74, 137, 148, 414, 436 and night bus routes N16, N73, N74 and N137. The nearest tube stations are Hyde Park Corner on the Piccadilly line near the street's southern end and Marble Arch on the Central line near its northern end. At Brook Gate, partway along the road, there is a <b>traffic</b> <b>signal</b> controlled pedestrian and cycle crossing connecting Hyde Park to London Cycle Route 39 the recommended cycling route from the park to the West End.|$|E
5|$|But in 1960, Jacob Dekema, the {{district}} highway engineer, stated {{that due to}} lower traffic on US 80, {{the completion of the}} freeway through the mountains would be delayed until at least 1971. Construction of the section of US 80 from Magnolia Avenue to Third Street was contracted for $2.7 million in April. That year, work continued on the freeway, and in August, only one <b>traffic</b> <b>signal</b> was left on the highway west of El Cajon, at Ward Road. In August, Dekema announced that bids for the portion between Lake Murray Boulevard and Third Street would be opened the following month; once that was completed, the entire freeway west of El Cajon would be complete. Eastbound lanes between US 395 and Fairmount Avenue opened on November 23.|$|E

5|$|In late 2006, the Jamul Indian tribe {{prepared}} {{to construct a}} casino, but many expressed concerns {{about the amount of}} traffic that would now travel on SR 94. In 2007, Caltrans declared that the construction required a permit to connect to SR94 and to construct on the state right-of-way. At the end of the year, the tribe had started construction on the driveway to the casino, while Caltrans stated that it lacked the information needed to determine if the proposed <b>traffic</b> <b>signal</b> should be approved. In late 2009, the tribe filed a lawsuit against Caltrans over the inability to get approval to connect the driveway with the highway. The tribe made the claim that they were a sovereign nation and did not need the approval, but this was rejected by the court. Caltrans and the tribe came to an agreement in 2009, where the tribe would provide its own studies and pay for environmental mitigation.|$|E
5|$|SR78 {{begins in}} Oceanside as a {{continuation}} of Vista Way. As it encounters a <b>traffic</b> <b>signal</b> and crosses over I-5, the route becomes a suburban freeway traveling east through Oceanside. The freeway loosely parallels Buena Vista Creek before entering the city of Vista. Turning southeast, SR78 continues into the city of San Marcos near California State University San Marcos and enters Escondido, where it has an interchange with I-15. A 2011 Caltrans study estimated that the average commuter encountered a delay of 10minutes on the portion from I-5 to I-15. After passing the Center City Parkway (I-15 Business) interchange, the freeway abruptly ends at the intersection with Broadway. SR78 then makes a turn south onto Broadway and continues through downtown Escondido by turning east onto Washington Avenue and south onto Ash Street, which becomes San Pasqual Valley Road.|$|E
5|$|SR666 {{begins at}} a <b>traffic</b> <b>signal</b> with SR60 and SR146, on the {{northeast}} side of Zanesville. The route heads east as a two-lane highway, before curving northeast. While passing through Zanesville the route passes woodland, with some commercial businesses. The highway makes a sharp curve due west, before another sharp curve northeast. After the second curve the route leaves Zanesville, running parallel to the Muskingum River and an Ohio Central Railroad track. The road makes a sharp curve northwest and passes under the Ohio Central Railroad track. After passing under the railroad track the route curves north-northeast and the railroad track curves due east. The roadway passes through the Zanesville State Forest Nursery, followed by a curve northwest, passing through the state forest nursery again. After leaving the state forest nursery, the highway passes through farmland heading due north. The route curves northeast passing through the state forest nursery {{for the last time}} and the highway has an intersection with County Road 40 (CR40), in rural Jefferson Township. Following this intersection, SR666 turns due west, before curving towards the north. This section of roadway passes mostly through farmland, with wooded areas when the route is close to the river. SR666 ends at an intersection with SR208 near Dresden, on the east bank of the Muskingum River.|$|E
