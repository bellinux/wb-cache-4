5|$|An {{advisory}} committee {{was formed by}} the city council in 1956 to propose sites for a new city hall and civic center campus. The city council placed a $250,000 bond issue on the November 1956 ballot to fund {{the construction of a}} new city hall, but voters defeated the proposition. City offices instead moved <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>former</b> hardware store near the Bellevue Square shopping center in 1960.|$|E
5|$|By 1929, {{the first}} highway {{designation}} along the current M-247 was assigned. That first number was M-111, which lasted until 1937 {{when all of}} M-111 became part of M-47. In early 1961, the roadway changed numbers once more. This time M-47 was realigned <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>former</b> section of US Highway 10 (US10), and the connection to the state park was assigned the M-247 designation. This was the highest highway number in the state, excluding Interstates, until the 1998 designation of M-553 in the Upper Peninsula.|$|E

5|$|The Germans {{occupied}} Le Touquet on 22 May 1940 and Wodehouse had {{to report}} to the authorities daily. After two months of occupation the Germans interned all male enemy nationals under 60, and Wodehouse was sent <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>former</b> prison in Loos, a suburb of Lille, on 21 July; Ethel remained in Le Touquet. The internees were placed four to a cell, each of which had been designed for one man. One bed was available per cell, which was made available to the eldest man—not Wodehouse, who slept on the granite floor. The prisoners were not kept long in Loos before they were transported in cattle trucks <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>former</b> barracks in Liège which was run as a prison by the SS. After a week the men were transferred to Huy in Liège, Belgium, where they were incarcerated in the local citadel. They remained there until September 1940, when they were transported to Tost in Upper Silesia (then Germany, now Toszek in Poland).|$|E
5|$|The National Human Rights Commission of Korea, after {{initially}} {{dismissing the}} 50 individual complaints, eventually recommended the government stop its mandatory HIV testing of foreign English teachers, after the commission allowed {{the case to}} be taken to the UN Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination, which told Korea in 2015 to apologize and pay compensation <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>former</b> assistant teacher at an elementary school who lost her job after she had refused to submit to an HIV test.

5|$|The Patterson Post Office {{underwent}} several re-locations {{throughout the}} years.

Residents complained that the new location was inadequate, claiming that parking was insufficient at nearby companies, and that walking along a busy road to reach the post office was dangerous. After a bidding process to determine the future location, the office was again moved <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>former</b> car service station along Front Street.|$|E

5|$|Currently Ariel is not {{involved}} in any orbital resonance with other Uranian satellites. In the past, however, it may have been in a 5:3 resonance with Miranda, which could have been partially responsible for the heating of that moon (although the maximum heating attributable <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>former</b> 1:3 resonance of Umbriel with Miranda was likely about three times greater). Ariel may have once been locked in the 4:1 resonance with Titania, from which it later escaped. Escape from a mean motion resonance is much easier for the moons of Uranus than for those of Jupiter or Saturn, due to Uranus's lesser degree of oblateness. This resonance, which was likely encountered about 3.8 billion years ago, would have increased Ariel's orbital eccentricity, resulting in tidal friction due to time-varying tidal forces from Uranus. This would have caused warming of the moon's interior by as much as 20K.|$|E
5|$|Forensic {{anthropologist}} Clyde Snow {{learned of}} the massacre {{during his visit to}} Zagreb in October 1992.

In a meeting Snow had with the dean of the Zagreb University School of Medicine, he was introduced <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>former</b> soldier who claimed to have survived the massacre and told Snow where it took place. Three days later, Snow went to Vukovar and drove to Ovčara accompanied by Royal Canadian Mounted Police Sergeant Larry Moore who was deployed to the region with the UNPROFOR. At the site, Moore spotted a human skull in the mud. A few days later, the UN declared the site a crime scene and deployed Russian UNPROFOR troops to guard it.|$|E
5|$|In 1956, Wheeler {{retired from}} his {{part-time}} professorship at the Institute of Archaeology. Childe was also retiring {{from his position}} of director that year, and Wheeler involved himself in the arguments surrounding who should replace him. Wheeler vocally opposed the nomination of W.F. Grimes, deeming his career undistinguished; instead, he championed Glyn Daniel as a candidate, although ultimately Grimes was selected. That year, Wheeler's marriage broke down, and he moved from his wife's house <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>former</b> brothel at 27 Whitcomb Street in central London. From 1954 to 1959, he served as the President of the Society of Antiquaries, and after resigning supported Ian Richmond as his replacement; however, Joan Evans was selected.

5|$|In July 1869 Van Gogh's uncle Cent {{obtained}} a position {{for him at}} the art dealers Goupil & Cie in The Hague. After completing his training in 1873, he was transferred to Goupil's London branch at Southampton Street, and took lodgings at 87 Hackford Road, Stockwell. This was a happy time for Van Gogh; he was successful at work, and at 20 was earning more than his father. Theo's wife later remarked that this was the best year of Vincent's life. He became infatuated with his landlady's daughter, Eugénie Loyer, but was rejected after confessing his feelings; she was secretly engaged <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>former</b> lodger. He grew more isolated, and religiously fervent. His father and uncle arranged a transfer to Paris in 1875, where he became resentful of issues such as {{the degree to which the}} firm commodified art, and was dismissed a year later.|$|E
5|$|In July 2015, FUNCINPEC {{announced}} {{the formation of}} the Cambodian Royalist Youth Movement, a youth organisation aimed at garnering electoral support for the party from younger voters. Meanwhile, tension persisted between Nhek Bun Chhay and Ranariddh, which erupted into a public spat, as Ranariddh threatened to expelled Nhek Bun Chhay who in turn, accused the party president of holding a grudge against him. Subsequently, on 3 February 2016, Nhek Bun Chhay announced that he was quitting the party, and went on to form his new party, the Khmer National United Party (KNUP). The KNUP adopted a logo which was similar <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>former</b> logo of FUNCINPEC, featuring the Cambodian Independence Monument. The secretary-general, Say Hak accepted Nhek Bun Chhay's resignation, {{while at the same time}} challenged KNUP's use of its new logo as he lodged a successful complaint with the interior ministry.|$|E

5|$|Liz Lemon (Tina Fey) and Dennis Duffy (Dean Winters) {{have gotten}} back {{together}} after Dennis {{was the only}} person who remembered her birthday. Disturbed by Liz's acceptance of mediocrity, her boss, Jack Donaghy (Alec Baldwin), tries to reform her into someone who enjoys the good life. He refers Liz to the fanciest restaurant in the city, Stone. Nevertheless, Liz declines Jack's offer to be her mentor. That night at Stone, Jack and his date walk by Liz and Dennis's table, with Jack very unimpressed by Dennis's manners. The following day, Jack introduces Liz <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>former</b> mentee of his, Howard Jorgensen (Brian Stack). At lunch the next day, Liz realizes she is frustrated with her relationship with Dennis, then she storms off to Jack's office to ask for help. Jack motivates Liz to end it with him. Liz comes home to break up with Dennis, only to find him distraught after a loss of his favorite hockey team, the New York Islanders. As a result, Dennis moves in with her.|$|E
5|$|Professional theatre {{returned}} {{briefly to}} the East End in 1972, with {{the formation of}} the Half Moon Theatre in a rented former synagogue in Aldgate. In 1979, they moved <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>former</b> Methodist chapel, near Stepney Green and built a new theatre on the site, opening in May 1985, with a production of Sweeney Todd. The theatre enjoyed success, with premières by Dario Fo, Edward Bond and Steven Berkoff, but by the mid-1980s, the theatre suffered a financial crisis and closed. After years of disuse, it has been converted to a public house. The theatre spawned two further arts projects: the Half Moon Photography Workshop, exhibiting in the theatre and locally, and from 1976 publishing Camerwork, and the 'Half Moon Young People's Theatre', which remains active in Tower Hamlets.|$|E
