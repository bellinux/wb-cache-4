Antarctica is a desert, with annual precipitation of only 200mm (8in) along the coast and far less inland.

Anywhere from 1,000 to 5,000 people reside throughout the year at the research stations scattered across the continent. Organisms native to Antarctica include many types of algae, bacteria, fungi, plants, protista, and certain animals, such as mites, nematodes, penguins, seals and tardigrades.

5|$|The {{mesosphere}} of Venus can {{be divided}} into two layers: the lower one between 62–73km and the upper one between 73–95km. In the first layer the temperature is nearly constant at 230K (−43°C). This layer coincides with the upper cloud deck. In the second layer temperature starts to decrease again reaching about 165K (−108°C) at the altitude of 95km, where mesopause begins. It is <b>the</b> <b>coldest</b> part of the Venusian dayside atmosphere. In the dayside mesopause, which serves as a boundary between the mesophere and thermosphere and is located between 95–120km, temperature increases to a constant—about 300–400K (27–127°C)—value prevalent in the thermosphere.

40|$|Abstract. Air {{curtains}} {{are commonly}} used to cut off air flow between <b>the</b> <b>cold</b> store and hot environment, and reduce heat and mass transfer {{in order to maintain}} the low temperature in <b>the</b> <b>cold</b> store. CFD can be used to predict operation rule of air curtain used in <b>the</b> <b>cold</b> store intuitively and modelling is the most important part of numerical simulation of air curtain used in <b>the</b> <b>cold</b> store. In this study, different numerical models including standard εκ − model (with and without boussinesq approximation) and RSM (with and without boussinesq approximation) were used to simulate the temperature field and air flow field in <b>the</b> <b>cold</b> store and operation rule of air curtain used in <b>the</b> <b>cold</b> store after air curtain opened for 60 s. Meanwhile, the actual operation of air curtain used in <b>the</b> <b>cold</b> store was tested and the simulation values were compared with the experimental values. The results showed that the velocity of the central mainstream decayed slowly, but the velocity of both sides of air curtain decayed fast. The optimal model used to predict the temperature field and air flow field in <b>the</b> <b>cold</b> store and operation rule of air curtain used in <b>the</b> <b>cold</b> store was standard εκ − model with boussinesq approximation, the relative error was within 20 %. The optimal model can be used to predict the temperature field and air flow field in <b>the</b> <b>cold</b> store during different times in the future research...|$|R
