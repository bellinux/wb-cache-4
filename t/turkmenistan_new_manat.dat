50|$|In 2005, a <b>new</b> {{series of}} <b>manat</b> {{banknotes}} was introduced. They {{had originally been}} intended to replace the first manat at a fixed rate, with 1000 equal to 1 of the first manat, but the revaluation was postponed and the issue released to circulate with previous manat issues. The series of notes was introduced in denominations of 50, 100, 500, 1,000, 5,000 and 10,000 <b>manat.</b> Two <b>new</b> coins were also introduced in only two denominations, 500 and 1,000 manat.

Like other CIS republics, Turkmenistan has established an Environmental Fund based on revenues collected from environmental fines, but the fines generally are too low to accumulate significant revenue.

Although T. mirabilis is tentatively placed in the subfamily Plusiocampinae, its true affinities remain uncertain.

5000|$|The first {{feature-length film}} to be {{produced}} at the <b>new</b> <b>Turkmenistan</b> film studio was Alexander Vladychuk's documentary Beloe Zeloto (White Gold) in 1929, which focussed on collectivization in the cotton industry. The same topic was covered by the first feature film, Zemlya Zhazhdet (The Earth is Thirsty), directed by Yuli Raizman and released in 1930. This film was made for Vostokkino and was originally silent, but had a soundtrack added a few months later. The first feature-length film {{to be produced}} with sound was Alexander Ledashchev's 1935 film I'll Be Back, which focused {{on the story of}} a young labourer, Kurban. According to Swetlana Slapke, the film [...] "made an indelible impression on the audience, mainly because it was the first feature film in their lives and about their lives". Its release was accompanied by a kind of festival, with music from a military brass band. Other directors active at the studio at the time included Vladimir Lavrov, Djavanshir Mamedov, Nikolai Mikhailovich Kopysov, Djuma Nepesov and Shadurdy Annaev.|$|R
50|$|Afghanistan as a {{landlocked}} country needs more diversified transit policy. Alternative routes and corridors are always helpful for the domestic economy {{as well as}} regional connectivity. This was the biggest motivation for Waissi to initiate an alternative transit route, later called the Lapis Lazuli Transit and Transport Route. His ideas was accepted by Jawed Ludin, former Deputy Foreign Minister of Afghanistan and later by Zarar Ahmad Osmani, former Minister of Foreign Affairs of Afghanistan. Waissi was being appointed immediately by Minister Osmani to follow with the concerned counties and coordinate to become party of the this initiative. Turkmenistan, Azerbaijan and Georgia immediately joined and Turkey was the last country to become as a party to this initiative. In early 2014 Waissi {{and a team of}} experts from the Afghan Government started the negotiation from Ashgabat in Turkmenistan. Waissi was leading the negotiation for the agreement on behalf of Afghan Government. The Lapis-Lazuli Transit & Transport Route (known as the 'Lapis Lazuli Route') agreement aims to enhance regional economic cooperation and connectivity between the countries of Afghanistan, Turkmenistan, Azerbaijan, Georgia, and Turkey, thereby expanding economic and cultural links between Europe and Asia. In doing so, the initiative seeks to improve transport infrastructure and procedures (including for road, rail, and sea), increase exports, and expand the economic opportunities of citizens in countries benefiting from this new transport corridor. Barriers to regional trade and transit and transaction costs will be reduced, in part, through a new Custom Integration Procedure and, between Afghanistan and <b>Turkmenistan,</b> a <b>new</b> Cross-Border Transport Agreement. Its projected impact is considerable not only because most of the needed infrastructure is already in place, but also because most of the investment required will focus on improving policy and governance.The Economic Rate of Return and Net Present Value still need to be established, but with a discount rate applied at 12%, the overall returns are expected to be positive. The Lapis Lazuli Route will connect with Turkey’s Middle Corridor Project (“East-West Trans-Caspian Trade and Transport Corridor”).|$|R
