5|$|A dry track during Q2 {{saw the two}} Mercedes drivers fastest, Rosberg four-tenths of {{a second}} faster than Hamilton. Fernando Alonso failed <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>into</b> Q3, the seventh time that season. He had missed {{the last part of}} {{qualifying}} seven times over the entire course of his Ferrari stint in the five previous seasons. Daniel Ricciardo was eliminated in 14th place, meaning that he - like Button - was unable to take the full extent of his ten-place grid penalty.|$|E
5|$|Consistent with {{previous}} form, the Hondas of Barrichello and Button failed <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>into</b> the top ten; they qualified 13th and 15th respectively. Takuma Sato, once again out-qualified the two Honda cars, just {{missing out on}} the top ten, in front of Vitantonio Liuzzi. He made it through to the second session of qualifying by 94 hundredths of a second, where he qualified in 14th. Scott Speed was the slowest car in the second session of qualifying putting him in 16th position.|$|E
5|$|Gatski {{was elected}} to the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1985 as part of a class that {{included}} Joe Namath, Pete Rozelle, O.J. Simpson, and Roger Staubach. Gatski said he had not expected <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>into</b> the hall. He had not played for 28 years when he was selected by an old-timers committee. Two decades later, Marshall University retired Gatski's number 72 during a homecoming game against the University of Alabama at Birmingham. Gatski was the first and remains the only Marshall football player to be so honored.|$|E

5|$|Hamilton {{once again}} {{set the time}} in Q2, almost a second ahead of second-placed Kimi Räikkönen, while Felipe Massa went faster than Sebastian Vettel in third. Alonso was {{eliminated}} in 14th position, ahead of Max Verstappen in the Toro Rosso, who was half a second slower than Carlos Sainz Jr., his teammate. Sergio Pérez joined the two Sauber drivers as the last three cars not <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>into</b> the top 10.|$|E
5|$|He {{finished}} the 2013–14 season with five league goals, {{in addition to}} nine assists. He failed <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>into</b> the Bundesliga Team of the Season, but was included in {{a list of the}} Best Defenders for the 2013–14 campaign. Rodríguez's nine assists also meant that he created more goals than any other full-back in Europe. His impressive displays during the season included 2.3 key passes per game, the same number as Andrea Pirlo, the two-time reigning Serie A Footballer of the Year, and 2.6 successful dribbles per game, more than Cristiano Ronaldo, the reigning Ballon d'Or winner.|$|E
5|$|In Q2, lap times {{improved}} {{and the two}} Mercedes drivers led the way, with Rosberg {{a little over a}} tenth of a second ahead of teammate Hamilton. Fernando Alonso went faster than Valtteri Bottas and looked <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>into</b> Q3, when Max Verstappen went faster and eliminated the McLaren driver. Also not in the top ten were both Lotus and the second McLaren of Jenson Button. Conditions soon worsened, preventing faster lap times. Many drivers spun out {{in the latter part of}} the session, complaining about aquaplaning.|$|E

5|$|Q2 {{started with}} a busy track once more, {{but many of the}} top drivers elected not {{to go out on a}} second timed run after setting {{sufficient}} lap times first time around. The eliminated drivers were determined rather quickly, with the two Renault drivers qualifying 14th and 15th respectively. The two McLarens were next to go out of contention, before Bottas was eliminated for 11th place on the grid, failing to improve on his lap time. Both Force India drivers were the last not <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>into</b> Q3, with Sergio Pérez beating his teammate Hülkenberg to ninth.|$|E
5|$|The {{second session}} saw Hamilton post the fastest time, {{even though his}} car lost contact to pit lane and his seat {{overheating}} once more. He was three-tenths clear of his teammate Rosberg, with Sebastian Vettel in third. Daniil Kvyat suffered engine problems and failed <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>into</b> Q3, as did the second Force India of Sergio Pérez, both Toro Rosso drivers and the Lotus of Pastor Maldonado.|$|E
5|$|Qualifying {{consisted}} of three parts, 18, 15 and 12 minutes in length respectively, with five drivers eliminated from competing after {{each of the first}} two sessions. Since the cars of Manor Marussia failed to start, only three drivers were eliminated during the first session of qualifying (Q1), all of which was run in dry conditions. The McLaren cars of Jenson Button and Kevin Magnussen struggled as expected, following their lack of pre-season testing and failed <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>into</b> Q2, just as Sauber driver Marcus Ericsson. Mercedes and Williams' Valtteri Bottas were the only ones not having to use the softer tyres to proceed into the next part of qualifying.|$|E

5|$|Central Coast Mariners' {{bid for a}} {{franchise}} in the Football Federation Australia's new A-League competition was aimed at filling the one spot for a regional team that was designated by the FFA. Media speculation prior to {{the announcement of the}} franchises in the new league suggested that the Mariners' bid may be favourable due to its new blood. Backing from former Australian international player and club technical director Alex Tobin, as well as Clean Up Australia personality Ian Kiernan—who would act as inaugural club chairman—also strengthened its proposal. As the only regional bidder, Central Coast was expected <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>into</b> the league by default. Following a reported signed deal with the FFA, the club signed former Northern Spirit coach Lawrie McKinna as manager and Ian Ferguson, a former Rangers and Northern Spirit player, as coach. To aid the FFA's goals of building the profile of the sport, the Mariners created formal links with local state league team Central Coast United. On 1 November 2004, after much expectation, the club was announced as one of eight teams to become part of FFA's domestic competition, the A-League. The decision made Central Coast Mariners the first Gosford-based professional sports team to play in a national competition.|$|E
5|$|Martin's first {{event of}} the 2011–12 World Curling Tour was the Point Optical Curling Classic, where he {{finished}} as a runner-up to Mike McEwen. He then won his first {{event of the}} season, the Westcoast Curling Classic, against McEwen. He next participated in the Cactus Pheasant Classic as the defending champion, but lost to Randy Ferbey in the semifinals. At the World Cup of Curling, Martin finished the round robin with a 4–1 win-loss record, but missed {{a chance to win}} another Grand Slam title after he was edged past by John Epping, 3–4. He failed <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>into</b> the playoffs at his next event, the Sun Life Classic. He and his team then competed in the Canada Cup of Curling, securing close wins over Glenn Howard and Jeff Stoughton in the round robin and finishing the round robin undefeated. He then played Howard in the final, and managed to defeat him with a score of 7–4, winning his record 4th Canada Cup title as skip. He and his team also earned berths into the 2012 Canada Cup, Continental Cup, and, most importantly, the 2013 Olympic Trials.|$|E
5|$|Morison {{continued}} his scoring form throughout Stevenage's 2007–08 campaign, scoring 22 times in 43 appearances, as the club narrowly {{missed out on}} the play-offs. He scored his first goal of the campaign in Stevenage's 2–1 victory against Histon in the club's first home fixture of the season, following this up with goals in victories against Weymouth, Stafford Rangers, and York City respectively. Morison scored his first brace {{of the season in}} a 4–0 win over Farsley Celtic in September 2007. He went on to score six goals in four games during the Christmas period – scoring doubles against Altrincham, Stafford Rangers, and Droylsden. He also scored {{on the last day of}} the season in a 2–1 win against Halifax Town. Although his least prolific season at Stevenage, Morison still managed a one-in-two ratio. At the end of the season, Morison handed in a transfer request as he sought a return to the Football League. Despite the club granting him his wish, and attracting interest from League Two side Crewe Alexandra, nothing materialised and Morison signed a new three-year contract at Stevenage. There was a clause in the contract that stated he could leave the club at the end of the 2008–09 season for a pre-arranged fee if Stevenage failed <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>into</b> the Football League.|$|E

5|$|Qualifying {{followed}} the usual road and street course system, {{with the field}} being split into two groups. In {{the first group of}} twelve runners, Wilson topped the session, 0.46 seconds ahead of the HVM Racing machine of Switzerland's Simona de Silvestro—one of four female drivers in the race—with Alex Tagliani in third position. Other drivers <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>into</b> the second session of qualifying were Power, Takuma Sato and Raphael Matos. The remaining twelve drivers took part in the second group, with Hunter-Reay topping his second session of the day. Hélio Castroneves, Briscoe, Franchitti, Dixon and Kanaan were the other competitors in the top six, and thus progressed to the second round of qualifying. In the Top 12, Power recorded the fastest lap time, holding off the British pair Wilson and Franchitti. Hunter-Reay, Kanaan and Tagliani finished between fourth and sixth, and would be {{the other half of the}} drivers that progressed to the Fast Six. Franchitti saved his best lap of qualifying to the last possible moment, taking his thirteenth career IndyCar Series pole position, and his 24th in American open-wheel racing. Tagliani took second on the grid, on his début with the FAZZT Race Team. Wilson took third ahead of Hunter-Reay, Power and Kanaan.|$|E
5|$|Wizards & Warriors is a {{platformer}} {{in which}} players control Kuros {{as he makes}} his way through the forests of Elrond to Castle IronSpire, where he must defeat Malkil and rescue the princess. After starting the game, the map is briefly shown for players to look at; afterwards, gameplay starts. Starting in the Elrond forest, players must explore the trees – both on top and inside – to find items and <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>into</b> the caves and tunnels. There, players start collecting the various magical items and treasure; they must make their way through caves filled with ice as well as lava. Afterwards, players fight through a second set of forests before arriving at Castle IronSpire, in which the player must go over the castle in order to enter it. The castle consists of a series of mazes in which players must use keys to open doors and possibly find other damsels which can be rescued. At the end lies the final confrontation with the wizard Malkil.|$|E
5|$|The Aniplex {{producer}} of Angel Beats!, Hironori Toba, was interviewed in the November 2009 issue of Dengeki G's Magazine, where he commented that a 13-episode anime with about 21 minutes per episode {{was not enough}} to tell the whole story of Angel Beats! Maeda had envisioned. Therefore, the various additional media, such as the illustrated short stories and manga, contain some of the story that was unable <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> <b>into</b> the anime because of time constraints. Toba wanted fans of the series to be able to enjoy it to the fullest by exploring all of the media types. Maeda found it tiring to go back and forth between Osaka and Tokyo for business meetings {{when he was in the}} process of writing the script, and found it difficult to write an entire script by himself, since he had never done that before with any of the games he produced as a member of Key. It was only after the script was done that Maeda was able to work on the music, which he greatly enjoyed and never tired of it. Maeda composed about 15 songs for Girls Dead Monster and spent about two days each composing each song. He made sure to create songs for Girls Dead Monster that high school girls would compose, including the lyrics. Due to this, Maeda pointed out that the opening and ending theme songs for Angel Beats!, which Maeda also composed, sound like they were composed by a different person compared to the Girls Dead Monster songs.|$|E
