The newlyweds spent their honeymoon week at the Lafayette Hotel before sailing to Galveston, where Nancy and the Bledsoes had already established residences. Houston retained a house he owned in the city named for him, but Margaret had no taste for <b>the</b> <b>hustle</b> <b>and</b> <b>bustle</b> and preferred the lesser-populated Galveston. She and her personal slaves, who had accompanied the newlyweds from Alabama, shared her mother's house while Houston traveled.|$|E

25|$|For {{many years}} Upper Hutt was a rural service town {{supporting}} the surrounding rural farming and forestry community. Serious urbanisation {{of the upper}} Hutt Valley only started around the 1920s but from the late 1940s onwards Upper Hutt's population exploded as people moved from <b>the</b> crowded <b>hustle</b> <b>and</b> <b>bustle</b> of inner city Wellington into a more secluded yet sprawling Hutt Valley. In 1950 Trentham Memorial Park was created with an area of almost 50 hectares. In July 1955, the electrification of the railway line from Wellington to Upper Hutt was completed, allowing fast electric multiple unit trains to replace steam- and diesel-electric-hauled carriage trains.

2500|$|A {{beautiful}} {{example of}} this mix of principles {{is seen in the}} Park's Mall in New York's Central Park, a large promenade leading to the Bethesda Terrace and the single formal feature in Olmsted and Vaux's original naturalistic design. The designers wrote that a [...] "'grand promenade' was an 'essential feature of a metropolitan park'"; however, its formal symmetry, its style, though something of an aberration, was designed so as to be subordinate to the natural view surrounding it. Wealthy passengers were let from their carriages at its south end. The carriage would then drive around to the Terrace, which overlooked the Lake and Ramble to pick them up, saving them the trouble of needing to double back on foot. The Promenade was lined with slender elms and offered views of Sheep Meadow. Affluent New Yorkers, who rarely walked through the park, mixed with the less well-to-do, and all enjoyed an escape from <b>the</b> <b>hustle</b> <b>and</b> <b>bustle</b> of the surrounding city.|$|E
