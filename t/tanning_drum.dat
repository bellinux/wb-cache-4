40|$|The {{content of}} {{the paper is the}} {{industrial}} application of enzyme hydrolysis of tanning solids waste with a view to minimizing the price of enzyme hydrolysate product, which has widely used. On the base of the energy balance of the enzymatic hydrolysis we estimated the critical minimal charge of a <b>tanning</b> <b>drum.</b> We performed of the critical minimal {{on the basis of a}} balance model for heat transport from reaction mixture into the environment through reactor wall. Employing a <b>tanning</b> <b>drum</b> for hydrolytic reaction allows to process tanning wastes in the place of their origin. It means thus considerably to enhancing economics of the whole process...|$|E
40|$|In {{the paper}} {{we deal with}} study of the {{problems}} of non-stationary heat conduction in a plane plate. In the first part of paper we formulate mathematic model for the cases of symmetric and asymmetric heating or cooling of a solid plate. In the second part we compute various cases of temperature fields in the plate during the mentioned process by mathematic software Maple. Finally we present formulated mathematic models using for optimization of two real technological operations of natural and synthetic polymers processing - modeling of moulding of plastic material and modeling of temperature field in wall of <b>tanning</b> <b>drum</b> by enzymatic hydrolysis...|$|E

"A <b>tanning</b> <b>drum</b> is {{to the left of}} Vince Martino. The person on the right was not in the tannery for long and his name is not recorded. There are double butts, used for sole leather. Each hide is slit in the centre of the back to facilitate handling. In the background, Jimmy Coleman operates a setting machine, basically a barrel with a set of blades which had rounded edges. These flattened the fibres and squeezed some moisture from hides before drying" [...] Information supplied by photographer...|$|E

40|$|Toxic odour causes {{pollution}} to environment. Removal of odour from {{wet processing}} sections of leather tanneries {{is important to}} preserve safety and occupational health. Such odour causing gases are identified in nature and are identified mostly as ammonia, Hydrogen sulfide and Volatile organic compounds. These gases, evolving from <b>tanning</b> <b>drums,</b> were experimentally quantified and analysed. Techniques for the abatement of odorous gases are designed using chemical methods. Scrubbing towers based on absorption of gases by liquid are designed and fabricated to evaluate {{the performance of the}} system in laboratory scale. Those gases were reduced in the concentration by absorbing through the packed bed vapour phase absorption using the activated carbon as the adsorbent. Results are helpful to conclude that the absorption technique presented here to reduce these toxic emission loads, seems to be simpler and economically cheaper...|$|R

40|$|In {{order to}} ensure safe and {{efficient}} operation of unit processes, foremost requirement is accurate measurement of process variables, with which quality can be monitored and controlled. Understanding the necessity of online monitoring of process temperature in tanning/dyeing process, the article is focused on wireless measurement of physical parameters involved in wet processing of hides/ skins and monitoring through digital computer for further analysis. It’s a challenging task to measure and communicate the process information from a closed rotating drum. Wireless communication is proposed because of its enhanced security, superfast operating speed, and increased mobility. The physical parameters which are predominant in tanning process are temperature, pH, conductivity etc. of the process fluid. It is necessary to carryout dyeing at 65 0 C for producing raw to wet blue process. As a first attempt, wireless module for temperature measurement has been developed. The module includes signal transmitter and receiver section. In the transmitter section, the temperature which is measured by an integrated sensor is converted into frequency signal and imposed on a radio frequency signal (career signal) and get transmitted in air. On the other side, receiver section receives the radio frequency signal and converts that into electrical signals to interface with the digital computer for online monitoring. The module is able to receive and control temperature of <b>tanning</b> <b>drum</b> within a distance of 100 meters. Real time experiments on the fabricated model show interesting results for commercialization. ...|$|E
50|$|The {{traditional}} {{occupation of}} the Kanjar was hunting, but over time, many took to agriculture. They still depend on the forest, extracting roots of the khas grass and collecting reeds from river banks. From the stalks of the munji grass and {{the roots of the}} palas tree, they made ropes to sell. The community is involved in <b>tanning,</b> from which <b>drums</b> are made and sold. Many urban Kanjar are now wage labourers and involved in rickshaw pulling.|$|R
