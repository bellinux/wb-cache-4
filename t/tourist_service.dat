5|$|The 1920s {{also saw}} an upsurge in holiday traffic, as Britain {{recovered}} from the war and tourism gained in popularity. The Talyllyn saw summer passenger numbers grow significantly and regularly had to supplement its formal passenger stock with slate wagons fitted with planks as seats. An unusual <b>tourist</b> <b>service</b> offered by the railway was to hire a slate wagon, which would be left at Abergynolwyn. At {{the end of the}} day the tourists would return to Tywyn in the wagon, powered by gravity. This service was discontinued in the early 1930s. The additional income from the tourist trade defrayed some of the costs of operating the railway, but never enough for it to make a profit during Haydn Jones' ownership.|$|E

After the success of open top RT-type AEC Regent III on tourist routes on Guernsey two former Jersey Motor Transport Tiger PS1s were purchased. Their Reading of Portsmouth bodies were too decayed to be restored so the first Tiger was rebodied as a single-deck open topper (Southport Corporation had used Ribble PS2s as such in the 1960s) and the second became a 35-seat coach with full-length sunshine roof. Both went to Mac Tours of Edinburgh after Guernseybus closed and passed to the Ensignbus preserved fleet, although the open topper is to operate a <b>tourist</b> <b>service</b> back on Jersey in 2012.

25|$|Both freight and {{passenger}} services have featured at Lyttelton since it opened in 1867. With the cessation of suburban passenger trains to Lyttelton in the 1970s, freight became the mainstay of the railways’ business at Lyttelton and today passenger traffic from Lyttelton plays only a minor role. Tranz Scenic have run a limited <b>tourist</b> <b>service</b> from the station in recent years during the summer season though patronage of these trains is limited to cruise ship passengers. Proposals {{have been made to}} reinstate a commuter rail service from Lyttelton, however this is not considered to be a realistic possibility for the foreseeable future. Operations at Lyttelton have included all three forms of motive power, with steam being dominant until the late 1960s when diesel began to take over, and electric power from 1929 to 1970. All trains at Lyttelton are now diesel-hauled.|$|E
