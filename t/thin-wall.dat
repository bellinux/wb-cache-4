5|$|While the {{aerospace}} industry {{is one of the}} primary users of gas tungsten arc welding, the process is used {{in a number of other}} areas. Many industries use GTAW for welding thin workpieces, especially nonferrous metals. It is used extensively in the manufacture of space vehicles, and is also frequently employed to weld small-diameter, <b>thin-wall</b> tubing such as those used in the bicycle industry. In addition, GTAW is often used to make root or first-pass welds for piping of various sizes. In maintenance and repair work, the process is commonly used to repair tools and dies, especially components made of aluminum and magnesium. Because the weld metal is not transferred directly across the electric arc like most open arc welding processes, a vast assortment of welding filler metal is available to the welding engineer. In fact, no other welding process permits the welding of so many alloys in so many product configurations. Filler metal alloys, such as elemental aluminum and chromium, can be lost through the electric arc from volatilization. This loss does not occur with the GTAW process. Because the resulting welds have the same chemical integrity as the original base metal or match the base metals more closely, GTAW welds are highly resistant to corrosion and cracking over long time periods, making GTAW the welding procedure of choice for critical operations like sealing spent nuclear fuel canisters before burial.|$|E

40|$|In {{metal cutting}} processes, {{excessive}} vibration or chatter has an {{adverse effect on}} productivity and product surface quality. Various studies {{have been reported in}} the literature over the past few decades. However, the real application of the outcome of these studies has been very limited. A new system has been developed in this study for chatter detection and chatter suppression. The coherence function values of the frequency spectra from two accelerometers in orthogonal directions were used as a chatter indicator. The vibration energy was used to offset the over-vigilance behaviour of the coherence function. A fuzzy logic control approach was used for chatter suppression based on both the coherence function value and vibration energy level. To improve the adaptability of the fuzzy controller, a self-learning algorithm has also been developed for on-line updating the fuzzy rule base. A direct output tuning method was also proposed to improve the responsiveness of the system. The proposed system has been tested using both steel and aluminium workpieces with and without <b>thin-walls.</b> The experimental results show that the proposed system worked reasonably well for on-line chatter detection and suppression. The thesis also explored the possibility of using the coherence function for chatter prediction. The verification of its feasibility may be carried out in the future...|$|R

40|$|Recent {{observational}} data of supernovae {{indicate that}} we may live in an underdense region, which challenges the Copernican principle. We show that the integrated Sachs-Wolfe (ISW) effect is an excellent discriminator between anti-Copernican inhomogeneous models and the standard Copernican models. As a reference model, we consider an anti-Copernican inhomogeneous model that consists of two inner negatively curved underdense regions and an outer flat Einstein-de Sitter region. We assume that these regions are connected by two <b>thin-walls</b> at redshifts z = 0. 067 and z= 0. 45. In the inner two regions, the first-order ISW effect is dominant and comparable {{to that in the}} concordant flat-Lambda models. In the outer Einstein-de Sitter region, the first-order ISW effect vanishes but the second-order ISW effect plays a dominant role, while the first-order ISW effect is dominant in the flat-Lambda models at moderate redshifts. This difference can discrimate the anti-Copernican models from the concordant flat-Lambda model. At high redshits, the second-order ISW effect is dominant both in our inhomogeneous model and the concordant model. In the outer region, moreover, the ISW effect due to large-scale density perturbations with a present matter density contrast much less than 0. 37 is negligible, while the effect due to small-scale density perturbations (such as clusters of galaxies, superclusters and voids) with matter density contrast much larger than 0. 37 would generate anisotropies which are larger than those generated by the ISW effect in the concordant model.

40|$|Aeroelastic {{phenomena}} {{can occur}} to many engineering structures: aircraft wings, rotor blades, wind turbines and slender bridges, for instance, are typical structures where severe, potentially catastrophic, aeroelastic events can take place. Current design trends are aimed to engineering solutions prone to aeroelastic phenomena. Typical examples are {{given by the}} design of slender wind turbines or aircraft wings. On the other hand, the increasing success of composite materials has opened new design scenarios where the occurrence of aeroelastic phenomena can be postponed by means of tailoring. Reliable aeroelastic analysis tools are {{needed in order to}} reduce the need of expensive and time consuming experimental tests. The development of reliable and computationally efficient analysis capabilities for aeroelasticity represents one of the most intriguing challenges of our times. Flutter is certainly the most known aeroelastic phenomenon. Catastrophic flutter events can occur to lifting surfaces (e. g. aircraft wings, rotor blades and wind turbines), bridges and missile panels. Depending on the flow condition, different flutter analysis capabilities are required. For instance, linear low-fidelity analysis can be sufficiently accurate for subsonic and supersonic flutter of lifting surfaces with no separations events, whereas transonic flutter requires nonlinear capabilities and high-fidelity tools taking into account flow viscosity effects. Computational costs can be significantly different from theory to theory. The trade-off between accuracy and computational efficiency is of primary interest. To date, the doublet lattice method (DLM) is one of the most powerful tools for linear flutter analyses in subsonic regime. DLM emerged in late 1960 s and, more recently, an improved version of DLM has been proposed. The following main features are responsible of DLM success: 1. it offers good accuracy (unless transonic regimes are considered and/or separation occurs); 2. DLM is computationally competitive with respect to simpler methods such as strip theories; 3. fairly complex geometries can be analyzed including whole aircraft. One-dimensional (1 D) structural models, commonly known as beams, are intensively exploited in many engineering applications. Beam theories are, in fact, used to analyze the structural behavior of slender bodies, such as columns, arches, blades, aircraft wings and bridges. In a beam model, the 3 D problem is reduced to a set of variables that only depends on the beam-axis coordinate. One-dimensional structural elements obtained are simpler and computationally more efficient than 2 D (plate/shell) and 3 D (solid) elements. This feature makes beam theories still very attractive for the static, dynamic and aeroelastic analyses. Classical models (Euler-Bernoulli and Timoshenko) have intrinsic limitations which preclude their applications for the analysis of a wide class of engineering problems. This work is aimed to the development of an aeroelastic formulation based on DLM and higher-order structural models. The structural formulation is based on the Carrera Unified Formulation (CUF) which allows the use of any-order structural models in a unified manner with no need of ad hoc implementations. CUF 1 D models are extremely cost competitive with respect to 2 D (plate/shell) and 3 D models with no accuracy loss. In other words, CUF 1 D structural elements lead to shell- and solid-like solutions with computational cost comparable to those of classical beam formulations. Linear flutter analysis was chosen to show the benefits of the present formulation and its possible extension to more sophisticated aeroelastic capabilities. Results from purely mechanical analyses have shown the enhanced capabilities of the 1 D structural formulation proposed. Shell- and solid-like accuracies have been obtained by using CUF 1 D models for a number of different structural problems, such as: <b>thin-walls</b> structures undergoing point loads, shell-like natural modes of hollow cylinders, composite structures. The number of degrees of freedom of a CUF 1 D finite element model is typically some 5 - 10 times lower than shells and 20 - 25 times lower than solids. Flutter analyses have been conducted on isotropic and composite wings and results have been compared with those from models based on plate and shell finite elements. Results have highlighted the high accuracy assured by 1 D CUF models in detecting bending-torsion couplings of <b>thin-walls</b> and laminated structures. Excellent matches with results from plate models have been found with considerably lower computational effort...|$|R
