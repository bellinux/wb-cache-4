30|$|Several {{surgical}} {{techniques were}} suggested {{in order to}} treat certain nerve injuries including “external neurolysis” (Joshi & Rood, 2002), the use of grafts to channel the nerve defect, or direct suturing (Rosen, 2014; Pogrel, 2007; Juodzbalys et al., 2011; Leung et al., 2012).

40|$|BACKGROUND. Consultant {{gynecologic}} oncologists {{from the}} regional Comprehensive Cancer Center assisted community gynecologists in the surgical treatment {{of patients with}} ovarian carcinoma when they were invited. For this report, the authors evaluated the effects of primary surgery by a gynecologic oncologist on treatment outcome. METHODS. The hospital files from 680 patients with epithelial ovarian carcinoma who were diagnosed between 1994 and 1997 {{in the northern part}} of the Netherlands were abstracted. Treatment results were analyzed according to the operating physician's education by using survival curves and univariate and multivariate Cox regression analyses. RESULTS. Primary surgery was performed on 184 patients by gynecologic oncologists, and on 328 patients by general gynecologists. Gynecologic oncologists followed <b>surgical</b> <b>guidelines</b> more strictly compared with general gynecologists (patients with International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics [FIGO] Stage I-II disease, 55 % vs. 33 % [P = 0. 01]; patients with FIGO Stage III disease, 60 % vs. 40 % [P = 0. 003]) and more often removed all macroscopic tumor in patients with FIGO Stage III disease (24 % vs. 12 %; P = 0. 02). When patients were stratified according to FIGO stage, the 5 -year overall Survival rate was 86 % versus 70 % (P = 0. 03) for patients with Stage I-II disease and 21 % versus 13 % (P = 0. 02) for patients with Stage III-IV disease who underwent surgery by gynecologic oncologists and general gynecologists, respectively. The hazards ratio for patients who underwent surgery by gynecologic oncologists was 0. 79 (95 % confidence interval [95 % CI], 0. 61 - 1. 03; adjusted for patient age, disease stage, type of hospital, and chemotherapy); when patients age 75 years and older were excluded, the hazards ratio fell to 0. 71 (95 % CI, 0. 54 - 0. 94) in multivariate analysis. CONCLUSIONS. The surgical treatment of patients with ovarian carcinoma by gynecologic oncologists occurred more often according to <b>surgical</b> <b>guidelines,</b> tumor removal more often was complete, and survival was improved...|$|R

40|$|Purpose: Surgery {{represents}} a main {{and often the}} only treatment in patients with testicular Malignant Germ Cell Tumors (MGCT). We analyzed the compliance to <b>surgical</b> <b>guidelines</b> and the results {{in a series of}} patients with testicular MGCT -/+ retroperitoneal node involvement, without distant metastases. Method: 42 patients, observed in 15 Centers were enrolled in the Italian Cooperative Study on MGCT (January 2004 –December 2010). 14 / 42 were younger than 2 y. of age, 28 / 42 between 13 – 18 y. Treatment was delivered according to COG-Staging-System: St. I patients (complete excision with inguinal orchifunicolectomy+decrease of markers, +hemiscrotectomy if scrotal involvement) did not receive further treatment; St. II patients (scrotal involvement after hemiscrotectomy and/or retroperitoneal node (RPN) enlargement: 2 cm) had RPN Dissection if residuals were suspected after PEBx 3 or 4. Results: St. I: 26 patients. 3 / 26 had a scrotal approach due to suspected testicular torsion: 1 / 3 underwent hemiscrotectomy, 2 did not receive further therapy after decrease of alphaFP, due to patient’s or physician’s decision respectively. 3 / 26 were successfully treated for RPN relapse, occurred at 3, 6, 9 months after adequate surgery (2 adolescents, 1 infant). St. II: in 4 patients CTwas delivered due to slight enlargement of RPN (+persistent alphaFP in 1). St. III: 12 patients received CT and RPND (bilateral in 1). Histology was negative in 11 / 12. All patients are alive without disease, 39 in 1 stCR, 3 in 2 ndCR (f. u 9 – 86 m. :med. 48). 1 St. 1 patient suffered from postoperative scrotal hematoma.

40|$|Using {{a simple}} {{mathematical}} formulation, {{the relationship between}} the position of the lag screw tip (relevant to both intramedullary and extramedullary devices) and the concept of tip-apex distance (TAD) was derived. TAD is widely used in operating theaters as a <b>surgical</b> <b>guideline</b> in relation to the fixation of trochanteric fractures, and in clinical studies as a predictor of lag screw cut-out. In order to visualize better this concept, the locus of points having the same TAD was plotted and the dependence of TAD on the location of the lag screw tip was also reported. It was shown that TAD should be adjusted for the size of the femoral head (a variable which varies a lot according to the sex of the patient) while no correlation was found between TAD and bone morphometry indices obtained from micro-CT data (BV/TV and Tb. Th). Therefore, these results seem to suggest that TAD lacks mechanical justification and that predictors which are based on mechanical properties, such as bone density, should be investigated further...|$|R
