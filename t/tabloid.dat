5000|$|With the {{emergence}} of Headline Daily and am730 into Hong Kong's print media industry in July 2005, the competition among the numerous newspapers (free and traditional) is becoming increasingly stiff and unhealthy. In fact, the existence of free circulated <b>tabloids</b> in general {{can be seen as}} a form of [...] "self killing" [...] in the industry, in which free <b>tabloids</b> are [...] "killing off" [...] the traditional broadsheets in terms of readership and advertising revenue. Besides this, the saturated market of three free <b>tabloids</b> in Hong Kong can also result in non-profitability for weaker competitors.|$|R

Types of features have also been studied in correlation to categories of news content. Theory: Marketing, marketing communications theory, and web theory are applied for the purpose of describing the differences and similarities in choices made by <b>tabloids</b> and broadsheets, in regards to selection and use of interactive features. Method: A quantitative method of analysis has been applied. The content of four of Sweden’s best known newspapers, Aftonbladet, Expressen, Dagens Nyheter (DN) and Svenska Dagbladet (SvD), has been analysed during the length of a week in December 2015. Results: Results indicate that <b>tabloids</b> interact more with their readers than broadsheets, using a broader variety of types of interactive features connected to a spectrum of social media outlets. Broadsheets use fewer types of interactive features, but offer them to their audience as much as the <b>tabloids</b> do. <b>Tabloids</b> let their readers comment on news more often than broadsheets, but broadsheets present more of actively solicited user generated content in their content. <b>Tabloids</b> offer most interactive features in news categorized as sports and entertainment. Broadsheets offer most interactive features in content categorised as news and entertainment...|$|R
