The third suggests that black-and-white plumage evolved once from the blue-and-white ancestral condition, and later the mainland species re-evolved blue plumage.|$|E

Upon initial antigen encounter in peripheral lymph nodes (PLN), T cells become activated, proliferate and express homing receptors {{that enable them to}} recirculate to the (inflamed) tissue that contains the antigen. Differentiation into the T helper lineages Th 1, Th 2, Th 17 and induced regulatory T cells (iTreg) requires additional antigen presentation by tissue macrophages and other antigen presenting cells (APCs) in the inflamed tissue.

25|$|Understanding {{how these}} troughs {{formed in the}} young Raditladi basin could provide an {{important}} indicator of processes that acted relatively recently in Mercury’s geologic history. There are two main theories of graben formation. The first is that they represent a surface manifestation of ring dikes or cone sheets. Both types of structures form when magma from a deep reservoir intrudes into the overlying rocks along conical or cylindrical fractures. <b>The</b> <b>second</b> <b>hypothesis</b> holds that the graben formed {{as a result of}} the floor uplift caused by the weight of the smooths plains outside the crater.

40|$|Intra-abdominal {{infections are}} a common entity faced by general surgeons, which, when {{complicated}} by pneumonia lead to increased mortality.

Further, augmentation of systemic PMN number by {{granulocyte colony stimulating factor}} (G-CSF) will decrease mortality. We established a murine model for peritonitis and pneumonia. PMN counts in the blood, lung tissue, peritoneal cavity and bronchoalveolar system were measured.

2500|$|Detective Ron Phillips {{testified that}} when he called Simpson in Chicago to tell him of his ex-wife's murder, Simpson sounded shocked and upset, but did not ask about how she died. Detective Tom Lange testified that Brown was {{probably}} killed first because the soles of her bare feet were clean, implying that she was struck {{down to the ground}} before any blood flowed. This was a key point that suggested Simpson might have set out to kill Brown, whereas Goldman appeared to have inadvertently stumbled upon the scene, prompting Simpson to kill him as well. In cross-examining Detective Lange, Cochran proposed two hypotheses for what happened at the murder scene. First, he suggested that one, or more, drug dealers encountered Brown while looking for her friend and house guest, Faye Resnick, an admitted cocaine abuser.

The Allies and the Germans {{had no interest in}} acknowledging the importance of improvisation and chance in the sensational victory of 1940, the fabrication of a Blitzkrieg Myth was convenient for the Allies, to hide the incompetence that had led to defeat. Rather than resort to technological determinism, German propaganda emphasised the machinery of the German army and that of the Allies, juxtaposing it with the heroic individualism of German soldiers, notably in the film Sieg im Westen (1941).

40|$|Learning a new {{language}} is not always easy.

Mandarin Chinese is a logographic language, meaning that each character represents a word and voice tone is used to differentiate between what would otherwise be homophones. In this thesis, I present two hypothesized methods for improving a student's ability to learn to recognize Chinese characters. The first is the use of radicals, components that make up Chinese characters almost like letters make up English words. <b>The</b> <b>second</b> is <b>the</b> use of studying example sentences when learning new words. To test these hypotheses, I performed a pilot experiment using 10 MIT undergraduate students, none of whom were native speakers of Mandarin Chinese.

Mr. Macdonald, Assistant- Surgeon of H.M.S. Herald, now in the South-Western Pacific, has lately sent home some very valuable observations on living forms of this kind, met with in the stomachs of oceanic mollusks, and therefore certainly inhabitants of the superficial layer of the ocean. But it is a singular circumstance that only one of the forms figured by Mr. Macdonald is at all like a Globigerina, and there are some peculiarities about even this which make me greatly doubt its affinity with that genus. The form, indeed, is not unlike that of a Globigerina, but it is provided with long radiating processes, of which I have never seen any trace in Globigerina. Did they exist, they might explain what otherwise is a great objection to this view, viz., how is it conceivable that the heavy Globigerina should maintain itself at the surface of the water? ...|$|E

It will also claim that the present lines, whether on the whole really or only approximately parallel, sometimes fork or send off branches on one side or the other, producing new lines (varieties), which run for a while, and for aught we know indefinitely when not interfered with, near and approximately parallel to the parent line. This claim it can establish; and it may also show that these close subsidiary lines may branch or vary again, and that those branches or varieties which are best adapted to the existing conditions may be continued, while others stop or die out. And so we may have the basis of a real theory of the diversification of species and here indeed, there is a real, though a narrow, established ground to build upon But as systems of organic Nature, both doctrines are equally hypotheses, are suppositions of what there is no proof of from experience, assumed in order to account for the observed phenomena, and supported by such indirect evidence as can be had.|$|E
