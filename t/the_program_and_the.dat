5|$|The ZBGM-75 Advanced Intercontinental Ballistic Missile, {{also known}} as Weapons System 120A (WS-120A), was a program to develop an {{intercontinental}} ballistic missile (ICBM), proposed by the United States Air Force in the 1960s {{as a replacement for}} the LGM-30 Minuteman as the Air Force's standard ICBM. Funding was not allocated for <b>the</b> <b>program</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> project was cancelled in 1967.|$|E
5|$|Convinced of Barclay's claims, the Doctor {{prepares to}} destroy the ship when Chakotay (Robert Beltran) arrives and gives an {{alternative}} story: The Doctor is indeed the Voyager EMH, but his program is stuck in the malfunctioning holodeck. The crew is trying to extricate his program so he only needs to wait it out; if he destroys the ship as Barclay suggests, it will prematurely end <b>the</b> <b>program</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Doctor will be lost. Even though Barclay introduces Kes (Jennifer Lien) as Zimmerman's wife, the Doctor finally opts to believe in his holographic existence. The simulation ends and the Doctor finds himself on the holodeck; Chakotay's story was true and the Doctor is safely returned to sickbay.|$|E
5|$|In March 1896, the Matabele again rose {{up against}} the British South Africa Company {{administration}} in what became called the Second Matabele War or the First Chimurenga (liberation war). Mlimo, the Matabele spiritual leader, is credited with fomenting much of the anger {{that led to this}} confrontation. The colonists' defenses in Matabeleland were undermanned due to the ill-fated Jameson Raid into the South African Republic (or Transvaal), and in {{the first few months of}} the war alone hundreds of white settlers were killed. With few troops to support them, the settlers quickly built a laager in the centre of Bulawayo on their own and mounted patrols under such figures as Burnham, Robert Baden-Powell, and Frederick Selous. The Matabele retreated into their stronghold of the Matopos Hills near Bulawayo, a region that became the scene of the fiercest fighting between Matabele warriors and settler patrols. It was also during this war that two scouts of very different backgrounds, Burnham and Baden-Powell, would first meet and discuss ideas for training youth that would eventually become the plan for <b>the</b> <b>program</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> code of honor for the Boy Scouts.|$|E

5|$|When {{registration}} commenced on October 16, 1940, no {{structure was}} in place to handle thousands of anticipated conscientious objectors. Church representatives meeting with government officials learned that little thought had been put into <b>the</b> <b>program,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> churches were advised to create a plan. Because the government wanted to deal with one body, not individual religious denominations, the National Council for Religious Conscientious Objectors was formed as a liaison between the churches and the federal government. The historic peace churches outlined a plan that included running and maintaining CPS camps under church control. However, President Roosevelt opposed any plan not involving military control over the draftees. To save their plan and retain civilian direction of the program, the churches offered to fund the camps. Aides convinced Roosevelt that putting the COs to work in out-of-the-way camps was preferable to repeating the difficulties of World War I. Selective Service and the peace churches agreed to a six-month trial of church supported and funded camps for conscientious objectors and thus Civilian Public Service was born.|$|E

25|$|Arguably, {{concurrent}} {{logic programming}} {{is based on}} message passing and consequently {{is subject to the}} same indeterminacy as other concurrent message-passing systems, such as Actors (see Indeterminacy in concurrent computation). Carl Hewitt has argued that, concurrent logic programming is not based on logic in his sense that computational steps cannot be logically deduced. However, in concurrent logic programming, any result of a terminating computation is a logical consequence of the program, and any partial result of a partial computation is a logical consequence of <b>the</b> <b>program</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> residual goal (process network). Consequently, the indeterminacy of computations implies that not all logical consequences of the program can be deduced.|$|E
