5000|$|A cable-backed bow is a bow {{reinforced}} with a cable on the back. The cable {{is made from}} either animal, vegetable or synthetic fibers and is tightened to increase {{the strength of the}} bow. A cable will relieve <b>tension</b> <b>stress</b> {{from the back of the}} bow by raising its neutral plane: the border between the back of the bow that stretches and the belly of the bow that compresses when bent. A good cable-backed bow can thus be made of poor-quality wood, weak in tension. The material, the diameter, the distance from the back of the wooden element, and the level of stress (tightness) of the cable determines how much it relieves <b>tension</b> <b>stress</b> from the wooden element of the bow and increases the power of the shot.|$|E

30|$|At present, {{the studies}} on {{tensioning}} processes of {{circular saw blade}} mainly focus {{on the effect of}} tensioning process on dynamic stability of circular saw blade [5 – 15]. Only a few studies are about the generation process of <b>tensioning</b> <b>stress</b> during <b>tensioning</b> process. The theoretical model of roll tensioning process was established by Szymani. The <b>tensioning</b> <b>stresses</b> obtained by the model were generally in good agreement with the experimentally determined <b>tensioning</b> <b>stresses</b> [1]. The model of roll tensioning process was established by Nicoletti based on finite element method and the <b>tensioning</b> <b>stresses</b> were obtained, the introduction of these stresses into a modal analysis allowed us to predict the dynamic behavior of circular saw blade [16]. A finite element model for roll tensioning of circular saw blades which allowed the investigation of various roll tensioning parameters was developed by Heisel [17]. There is little theoretical research about the generation process of <b>tensioning</b> <b>stress</b> during multi-spot pressure tensioning process at present. For an in-depth research of generation process of <b>tensioning</b> <b>stress</b> during multi-spot pressure tensioning process, a numerical model which could both meet the requirement of computational efficiency and accuracy should be established first.|$|R

5000|$|Tension is {{also used}} to {{describe}} the force exerted by the ends of a three-dimensional, continuous material such as a rod or truss member. Such a rod elongates under tension. The amount of elongation and the load that will cause failure both depend on the force per cross-sectional area rather than the force alone, so stress = axial force / cross sectional area is more useful for engineering purposes than <b>tension.</b> <b>Stress</b> is a 3x3 matrix called a tensor, and the [...] element of the stress tensor is tensile force per area, or compression force per area, denoted as a negative number for this element, if the rod is being compressed rather than elongated.|$|E
5000|$|Kahn {{discovered}} that concrete was much stronger in compression than tension, so {{came up with}} the idea of distributing the stresses. He did scientific engineering experiments and {{came up with the}} concept that if the steel beam edges were bent back at a 45 degree angle forming projecting tabs or [...] "wings" [...] before going into the molded form led to better stress distribution. The winged sheared members are cut and turned up to form an angle from the thin edge of the steel bar but are still permanently attached. When the wet concrete mixture poured in hardened there was no slippage of the steel beam because the <b>tension</b> <b>stress</b> is distributed throughout the beam.|$|E
30|$|The <b>tensioning</b> <b>stress</b> {{distribution}} of {{circular saw blade}} after roll tensioning was described by Szymani [2]. In the inner loop of the tensioned region, the tangential <b>tensioning</b> <b>stress</b> is compressive, and its value increases gradually from loop of the tensioned region to inside. In the exterior loop of the tensioned region, the tangential <b>tensioning</b> <b>stress</b> is tensile, and its value decreases gradually from loop of the tensioned region to outside. This {{distribution of}} tangential <b>tensioning</b> <b>stress</b> is not very ideal relatively. The tangential <b>tensioning</b> <b>stresses</b> of circular saw blades tensioned by three levels of hammering were measured by X-ray stress meter [3, 4]. The tangential <b>tensioning</b> <b>stress</b> outside hammer region increases with radius, which is an ideal distribution. This phenomenon indicates that the distribution of tangential <b>tensioning</b> <b>stress</b> produced by hammering is more reasonable than that produced by roll tensioning. However, hammer tensioning has its limitations because the hammer tensioning creates a very irregular surface and produce localized, non-axisymmetric stresses because the force and position of spots are controlled by workers and its reproducibility and controllability {{are very difficult to}} be mastered, and it depends heavily on the experience and skills of saw repairing workers. The precision of hammer tensioning is relatively poor. Multi-spot pressure tensioning process is one kind of tensioning methods and a quasi-static process. The fixed areas of circular saw blade are pressed by spherical or cylindrical surface during multi-spot pressure tensioning process. The force and position of spots are controlled precisely by automated machinery during the multi-spot pressure tensioning process. A cyclic symmetry stress distribution and appropriate macroscopic deformation can be obtained by the multi-spot pressure tensioning process. Therefore, a more ideal distribution of tangential <b>tensioning</b> <b>stress</b> is produced during multi-spot pressure tensioning process. This tensioning approach is conducive to the realization of the automatic tensioning operation, especially in the production of ultra-thin circular saw blades.|$|R
30|$|As {{shown in}} Fig.  11, the {{tangential}} <b>tensioning</b> <b>stress</b> distribution of {{circular saw blade}} after unloading and the measured results in specified radial path of circular saw blade had the same trend and the value was similar in most regions, which proved that the tangential <b>tensioning</b> <b>stress</b> of circular saw blade calculated by finite element method in this paper was true and reliable. In the edge area of circular saw blade, the tangential <b>tensioning</b> <b>stress</b> was increased with the ratio of radius, and the feasibility of multi-spot pressure tensioning process was theoretically proved.|$|R
30|$|Tensioning is {{the most}} {{important}} and advanced technological process for production of circular saw blade for avoiding the above-mentioned phenomenon. Among all the tensioning processes, roll tensioning process is most widely applied in the cutting tool industry. The tangential tensile <b>tensioning</b> <b>stress</b> field is produced which can compensate for the tangential compressive stress caused by thermal stress and improve the stability of circular saw blade [3 – 5]. However, circular saw blade can also obtain radial compressive <b>tensioning</b> <b>stress</b> during roll <b>tensioning</b> process which is easy for the blade to lose stability and buckle into a “dish” shape. The thin circular saw blade requires higher tangential tensile <b>tensioning</b> <b>stress</b> and lower radial compressive <b>tensioning</b> <b>stress</b> for maintaining stability, which brings a challenge to roll tensioning process of thin circular saw blade.|$|R

For example, rawhide {{is often used}} to cover saddle trees, which make up the foundation of a western saddle, while wet: it strengthens the wooden tree by drawing up very tight as it dries and resists the abrasion regularly encountered during stock work or rodeo sports. It can also be used as a backing on a wooden bow. Such a backing prevents the bow from breaking by taking a share of the <b>tension</b> <b>stress.</b> Bows made from weaker woods such as birch or cherry benefit more from a rawhide backing.|$|E
50|$|The {{role of the}} {{tangential}} viscous {{stress is}} essential in establishing a steady meniscus shape in flow focusing, as illustrated {{in the case of}} a simple liquid jet surrounded by a gas. In the absence of a sufficiently strong tangential stress, a round-apex meniscus is obtained. Both the inner liquid and the external gas flows would exhibit stagnation regions around the round apex. The surface <b>tension</b> <b>stress</b> σ/D would be simply balanced by an appropriate pressure jump across the interface. If one slowly pushes a liquid flow rate Q, the system would spit intermittently the excess of liquid to recover the round-apex equilibrium shape. However, when the tangential stress is sufficiently vigorous compared to σ /D, the surface can be deformed into a steady tapering shape, which allows the continuous and smooth acceleration of the liquid under the combined actions of the pressure drop ΔP and the tangential viscous stress τs on the liquid surface.|$|E

Through controlled and mechanically applied <b>tension</b> <b>stress,</b> Ilizarov was able to show that the bone and soft tissue can be made to regenerate in a reliable and reproducible manner. The top rings of the Ilizarov (fixed to the healthy bone by the tensioned wire) allow force to be transferred through the external frame (the vertical metal rods), bypassing the fracture site. Force is then transferred back to the healthy bone through the bottom ring and the tensioned wires. This allows the Ilizarov apparatus to act as a sort of bridge, both immobilizing the fracture site and relieving it of stress, while allowing for the movement of the entire limb and partial weight-bearing. Middle rings (and tensioned wires) act to hold the bone fragments in place and to give greater structural support to the apparatus and limb. However, the critical load bearing rings are the top and bottom rings which transfer the force from the healthy bone down to the healthy bone, bypassing the fracture site.|$|E
