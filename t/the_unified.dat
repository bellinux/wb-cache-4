5|$|In 2006, the Association of Boxing Commissions (ABC) held a {{committee}} meeting to revise <b>the</b> <b>Unified</b> Rules. During it, Kizer and Lembo proposed altering the rule on downward elbow strikes to permit 12-6 elbows to anywhere except {{the head of}} a downed opponent. However, the proposal was strongly rejected by doctors on the committee on the grounds that 12-6 elbows could still cause serious injury, even when not done on the head. The ABC, despite endorsing <b>the</b> <b>Unified</b> Rules, does not have statutory authority over the individual state athletic commissions in the United States though governs through influence. As a result, in some states such as Mississippi, 12-6 elbows are permitted in MMA fights. As a result, a commission was set up by ABC to look at the regional MMA rule variations, including 12-6 elbows, to standardise MMA in the United States.|$|E

5|$|Because of the {{initially}} {{broad definition}} of 12-6 elbows in <b>the</b> <b>Unified</b> Rules, referees often had differences in {{interpretation of what}} was classed as one. Referee Herb Dean differed from McCarthy's definition and argued that elbow strikes parallel with the floor in side control (sometimes called 9-3 elbows) were classed as 12-6 elbows, as he considered 12-6 elbows as being based on where the fighter throwing them was positioned.|$|E
