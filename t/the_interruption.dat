40|$|Research {{has shown}} that with {{practice}} people improve on most tasks. It has also been made clear that over time interruptions become less disruptive. It is unclear whether <b>the</b> reduction in <b>interruption</b> disruptiveness {{is due to a}} general practice effect or specific to the interruption/resumption process. In this experiment, participants performed three sessions of a task with one, two, or three of <b>the</b> sessions containing <b>interruptions.</b> We found that in addition to all participants showing primary task improvement, those with more exposure to interruptions also showed improvement in dealing with <b>the</b> <b>interruptions.</b> Specifically, participants with practice on only the primary task did not show improvement with <b>the</b> <b>interruptions.</b> These results suggest that the mitigations of the disruptions are directly related to people getting better at handling <b>the</b> <b>interruptions...</b>|$|R

40|$|A {{large part}} of the time losses in {{production}} in modern manufacturing industry are a cause of unplanned interruptions in production. In this essay we have studied the effects of an unplanned <b>interruption</b> in production. <b>The</b> study was performed during one month on a press production line at Volvo Cars Body Components (VCBC) in Olofström. The effects of <b>the</b> <b>interruptions</b> have been studied on the basis of two perspectives of the environment of the production. The study started at the level of automation and was mainly done as a survey of <b>the</b> unplanned <b>interruptions</b> in production. After the survey we realised that it was important for our study {{to take a closer look}} at how the operators were affected by <b>the</b> unplanned <b>interruptions.</b> We called this perspective the social individual level. As a basis for our survey over <b>the</b> <b>interruptions</b> we have used collected information from VCBS’s internal information system. To better understand the effects of <b>the</b> <b>interruptions</b> on <b>the</b> social level we performed interviews with operators and the production manager of the examined production line. The effects on the working situation for the operators were our main focus when we examined on the social individual level. The collected material from the above-mentioned levels has been revised and analyzed to become the basis of our conclusion. We came to the conclusion that <b>the</b> <b>interruptions</b> in production were a part of the operator’s every-day life and that it was a challenge for the operator to master those situations...|$|R

5|$|Robert Urie {{completed}} his H15class mixed-traffic 4-6-0 design in 1913 and the prototype {{was built in}} August 1914. It showed a marked improvement in performance over Dugald Drummond’s LSWR T14 class 4-6-0 when tested on local and express passenger trains. The introduction of ten H15 engines into service coincided with {{the outbreak of the}} First World War, which prevented construction of further class members. Despite <b>the</b> <b>interruption</b> caused by the conflict, Urie anticipated that peacetime increases in passenger traffic would necessitate longer trains from London to the south-west of England. Passenger loadings on the heavy boat trains to the London and South Western Railway’s (LSWR) ports of Portsmouth, Weymouth and Southampton had been increasing prior to the war, and was beginning to overcome the capabilities of the LSWR’s passenger locomotive fleet. His response was to produce a modern, standard express passenger design similar to the H15.|$|E

5|$|Continuous zonal {{patterns}} {{can take}} the form of whitish subsutural bands (A. similis), heavy subperipheral pigmentation (A. perversus var. infraviridis), subsutural color lines (A. columellaris), broad spiral color bands (A. metabletus, A. webbi), or narrow spiral bands (A. laevus). Interrupted zonation can consist of <b>the</b> <b>interruption</b> of bands into spots in (A. maculatus); highly irregular splitting of zones (A. perversus vars. sultanus and interruptus); formation of oblique radial streaks which run parallel to (in A. inversus) or cross (in A. latestrigatus) the incremental growth lines; or almost every conceivable combination and variation of these factors. Often the pattern will change radically from the apex to the body whorl (in A. quadrasi vars.). The aperture, parietal callus, columella, lip, and umbilical region are variously marked with pink, brown, purple, white, or black. Haniel (1921) includes several color plates which clearly demonstrate the extent of color variation within two species of the Syndromus type. A. perversus and A. maculiferus of the subgenus Amphidromus are equally variable, whereas species such as A. inversus and A. similis are almost uniform in coloration.|$|E
5|$|Evolutionary {{theory can}} argue against the {{selection}} of the deferred gratification trait since there are both costs and risks associated with delaying gratification behavior. One such cost is the basic opportunity cost associated with time spent waiting. While waiting, individuals lose time {{that could be used to}} find other food. Seeking high calorie food conveys a clear evolutionary advantage. There are also two risks associated with being patient. First, there is a risk that another animal might get to the food first, also known as an interruption risk. Second, there is the risk that the chance to get the reward will be cut short, perhaps by a predator, also known as a termination risk. These costs and risks create situations in which the fitness of the individual is threatened. There are several examples that show how reward delay occurs in the real world. For example, animals that eat fruit have the option of eating unripe fruit right away, or waiting, delaying gratification, until it becomes ripe. <b>The</b> <b>interruption</b> risk plays a part here, because if the individual forgoes the unripe fruit, there is a chance that another individual may come along and get to it first. Also, in extractive foraging, such as with nuts and shellfish, the outer shell creates a delay. However, animals that can store food and defer eating are more likely to survive during harsh conditions, and thus delaying gratification may also incur an evolutionary advantage.|$|E
5|$|World War I {{resulted}} in many Haflingers being taken into military service and <b>the</b> <b>interruption</b> of breeding programs. After the war, {{under the terms}} of the Treaty of Saint Germain, South Tyrol (including Hafling) was ceded to Italy, while North Tyrol remained in Austria. This split was extremely detrimental to the Haflinger breed, as most of the brood mares were in South Tyrol in what was now Italy, while the high-quality breeding stallions had been kept at studs in North Tyrol and so were still in Austria. Little effort at cooperation was made between breeders in North and South Tyrol, and in the 1920s a new Horse Breeders' Commission was established in Bolzano in Italy, which was given governmental authority to inspect state-owned breeding stallions, register privately owned stallions belonging to Commission members, and give prize money for horse show competition. The Commission governed the breeding of the Italian population of both the Haflinger and the Noriker horse. In 1921, because of the lack of breeding stallions in Italy, a crossbred Sardinian-Arabian stallion was used for the Haflinger breeding program, as well as many lower-quality purebred Haflingers.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT Objective: {{to analyze}} <b>the</b> <b>interruptions</b> {{experienced}} by nursing professionals while undertaking care activities. Method: an observational study undertaken in two intensive care units. Two nurses observed 33 nursing professionals for three hours. The data {{were recorded in}} real time, using a semistructured instrument. Results: after 99 hours of observation of 739 activities, it was identified that 46. 82 % were interrupted, resulting in 7. 85 interruptions per hour. On average, <b>the</b> <b>interruptions</b> compromised 9. 42 % of the nursing professionals' worktime. The activities geared towards indirect care of the patient suffered {{the highest number of}} interruptions (56. 65 %), with the nursing records being the activity interrupted most. The principal source of <b>the</b> <b>interruptions</b> was external, coming from the health professionals (51 %), and the main causes were those related to the patients (34. 70 %) and to interpersonal communication (26. 47 %). Conclusion: the activity of nursing suffers a high number of interruptions, mainly caused by the health professionals themselves, indicating that the work environment needs to undergo interventions aiming {{to reduce the risk of}} compromising of the professional's performance and to increase the patients' safety...|$|R
5|$|England {{had started}} the Third Test at Sydney strongly. Australia took its first wicket when Miller caught Washbrook from Johnson with a {{horizontal}} diving catch at slip. England were still in control at 1/128 when Miller came on to bowl. He removed Hutton and Reg Simpson before bowling Compton for a duck. In the space of four overs from Miller, England were now 4/137. Miller had contributed to all four wickets. Miller ended with 4/37 as England were bowled out for 290 on the second day. Miller batted patiently on the third day, reaching 96 by stumps with Australia at 6/362. The next day, with his century four runs away, Miller arrived late, leaving his batting partner Johnson waiting at the players' gate. Miller progressed to 145notout despite <b>the</b> <b>interruption.</b> It has been a patient innings by his standards, taking almost a day. England collapsed for 123, leaving Australia to take an innings victory. In the first innings of the Fourth Test in Sydney, Miller scored 44 and did not take a wicket, but he was heading for consecutive Test centuries in the second innings. He reached 99 when a leg break from Doug Wright spun across him and clipped the off bail. The innings helped Australia to set England a target of 503. Miller took 3/27 on the final day, helping {{to cut through the}} middle order as Australia won by 274runs. Miller was out for seven and a duck in the Fifth Test at the MCG. He took 4/76 in the first innings, joining Lindwall in cutting down the middle order, despite which England won by eight wickets. Miller topped the Test batting averages with 350 runs at 43.75, and for the entire first-class season, he scored 1332runs at 78.35, the highest among all comers. His bowling was also strong, with 17wickets at 17.70, second only to Jack Iverson (21 wickets at 15.23). However, an attack by Morris (182) and Miller (83) in a Shield match dispirited Iverson, and he never played Test cricket again.|$|E

30|$|In this section, {{we propose}} an {{alternative}} approach to analyze the preemptive and non-preemptive priority queueing service disciplines in OSA networks. As interruptions have a preemptive behavior, we can model <b>the</b> <b>interruptions</b> as <b>the</b> highest priority type of traffic whose packet inter-arrival time is distributed with a random variable Y and whose busy periods are distributed with a random variable R. We can then have an estimate for the service time of these virtual highest priority packets whose busy period models <b>the</b> <b>interruptions.</b> Closed-form relations cannot be derived in general since for any distribution of R and Y, a different formula for the busy periods and consequently for the service time exists. If Y is exponentially distributed with parameter α, we can assume an M/G/ 1 queue for <b>the</b> <b>interruptions.</b> Note that, as discussed in the introduction, this alternative approach provides an approximation {{because we know that}} the real distribution of the busy periods in an M/G/ 1 queue is a complicated function built on the Bessel function[9], which cannot exactly be matched to R. We discussed this alternative approach in this paper for completeness and {{as an extension of the}} analysis provided in[6, 12, 13] for multiple classes of traffic with preemptive and non-preemptive service disciplines.|$|R
