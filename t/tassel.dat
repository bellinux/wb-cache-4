5|$|Crane later becomes {{suspicious}} when {{he realizes}} the diagram made by Katrina he thought summoned the Horseman is {{really one of}} protection, and also that the corpse of Lady Van <b>Tassel</b> has a wound {{that seems to have}} been caused post-mortem. The corpse is revealed as that of a servant when Lady Van <b>Tassel</b> (Miranda Richardson) emerges alive to ambush Katrina. Lady Van <b>Tassel</b> tells Katrina that her family was driven from their ancestral home by the Van Garretts, who then sold it to the Van Tassels. She proceeded to pledge her soul to Satan and become a witch, summoning the Horseman to kill Van Garrett, his son, new wife, unborn child, and every villager who knew about his new will, marriage, and child, {{in order to be able}} to claim everything that she deemed to be rightfully hers uncontested. She then sends the Horseman after Katrina to remove the last obstacle to inheriting the combined Van Garrett and Van <b>Tassel</b> estates.|$|E
5|$|Following a {{fight and}} a stagecoach chase, Crane {{eventually}} thwarts Lady Van <b>Tassel</b> by throwing the skull to the Horseman, who reattaches his head to his body and breaks Lady Van Tassel's curse. The Horseman, no longer under her control, hoists Van <b>Tassel</b> up on his horse and gives her a bloody kiss against her will. He then rides to Hell, taking her with a smile, fulfilling her end of the deal with the Devil. Crane returns home to New York City with Katrina and Young Masbath, {{just in time for}} the new century.|$|E

5|$|Later that month, Emmerich's Chasseurs, {{an elite}} unit of Loyalist militia and Hessian mercenaries, staged a midnight raid on Storm's Bridge. Hoping to capture Storm and his cousins the Van Tassels, all {{active in the}} local Patriot militia, the Chasseurs settled for burning and looting Storm's house and tavern. Proceeding on to the Van <b>Tassel</b> houses, they trapped Cornelius Van <b>Tassel</b> Jr., one of the cousins' teenage sons. As the Chasseurs {{set fire to the}} houses, he hid on a roof, then jumped off, fended off some {{putative}} captors, and fled into the cold waters of the nearby Saw Mill. He got away, but soon died of hypothermia.|$|E
5|$|A {{council is}} held in the church. The Horseman {{seemingly}} kills Katrina's stepmother, Lady Van <b>Tassel,</b> and heads off to the church to get Baltus. Crane realizes the Horseman can't enter the church due to it being holy ground. A fight breaks out between the village elders in the church resulting {{in the deaths of}} Reverend Steenwyck and Doctor Lancaster, only ending when the Horseman harpoons Baltus through a window, dragging him out and acquiring his head. The next day, Crane believes Katrina {{to be the one who}} controls the Headless Horsemen.|$|E

5|$|Crane {{starts to}} believe that a {{conspiracy}} links all the deaths together, so he looks into Van Garrett's last will. Van Garrett had made a new will just before he died, leaving all his possessions to his secret new bride, Emily Winship, whom Crane discovers was pregnant with Van Garrett's child. Crane deduces that all who knew about the new will, the marriage and the pregnancy were the victims of the Horseman and that Katrina's father Baltus Van <b>Tassel</b> (Michael Gambon), who would have inherited the fortune, is the person holding the skull. Katrina, finding out that Crane suspects her father, burns all the evidence that Crane has accumulated.|$|E
5|$|In late 1957, Cameron {{moved to}} San Francisco {{with her friends}} Norman Rose and David Metzer.

She began a relationship with the artist Burt Shonberg, and with him moved into a ranch outside of Joshua Tree. Together they began exploring the subject of Ufology, and became friends with the ufologist George Van <b>Tassel.</b> After Kimmel was released from a psychiatric ward, Cameron re-established her relationship with him, and in 1959 they were married in a civil ceremony at Santa Monica City Hall; their relationship was strained and they separated soon after.|$|E
5|$|Clergy of the Church of England {{who were}} not bishops {{historically}} bore arms identical to a layman, with a shield, helm and crest, and no ecclesiastical hat. In England in 1976 a system for deans, archdeacons and canons was authorized by the College of Arms, allowing a black ecclesiastical hat, black or violet cords, and three violet or red tassels on each side. A priest uses {{a black and white}} cord with a single <b>tassel</b> on each side, and a deacon a hat without tassels. A Doctor of Divinity may have cords interwoven with red and a hat appropriate to the degree, and members of the Ecclesiastical Household add a Tudor rose {{on the front of the}} hat. According to Boutell's Heraldry, this system represents the practice of the Church in England in the 16th century.|$|E

50|$|Umchwasho is a {{traditional}} chastity rite in Swaziland. While the rite is active, unmarried women {{are not allowed to}} have sexual relations and must wear {{a traditional}} set of <b>tassels.</b> The <b>tassels</b> are usually made of wool and are worn around the neck like a scarf. Girls aged 18 and under must wear blue-and-yellow <b>tassels</b> and are not allowed any physical contact with males. Those aged 19 or over must wear red-and-black <b>tassels</b> and are allowed some physical contact with males but not sexual intercourse.

40|$|Healthy <b>tassels</b> from 50 -day-old corn plants {{contained}} more IAA (both {{free and}} bound) {{than did those}} from Peronosclerospora sorghi-infected plants. Free IAA content was higher in both healthy and diseased <b>tassels</b> than the amt. of bound IAA. Of the bound form, the alkali-sol. fraction was greater than the acid-sol. fraction. The decrease in auxin content probably is responsible for proliferation of the infected corn <b>tassels.</b> [on SciFinder(R) ...|$|R
5|$|Lesser Roman Catholic prelates use {{a variety}} of colors. Violet hats were once {{actually}} worn by certain monsignors, and so in heraldry they have used a violet hat with red or violet tassels in varying numbers, currently fixed at six on each side. The lowest grade of monsignor, a Chaplain of His Holiness, uses a black hat with violet tassels. The superior general of an order displays a black galero with six tassels on each side, while provincial superiors and abbots use a black galero with six or three tassels on each side, although Norbertines (White Canons) use a white galero. Although a priest would rarely assume arms unless he had an ancestral right to arms independent of his clerical state, a priest would use a simple black ecclesiastical hat with a single <b>tassel</b> on each side. Priests who hold an office such as rector would have two tassels on each side.|$|E
5|$|Within Presbyterian Church heraldry, a minister's hat is {{represented}} as black {{with a single}} <b>tassel</b> on each side, sometimes blue, though a doctoral bonnet or Geneva cap may replace the brimmed hat. Clergy of the Chapel Royal display red tassels. The office of moderator does not have corporate arms, but for official occasions, a moderator may add tassels to his personal arms to indicate parity with offices of other churches: three for a moderator of a presbytery, and six for a moderator of a regional synod. The moderator of the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland now uses a differenced version of the General Assembly's arms, with a hat having a blue cord and ten tassels on each side, and may also show the moderator's staff, a gold Celtic crosier, behind the shield {{as can be seen}} in vol 41, p 152 of the Scots Public Register.|$|E
5|$|On {{the morning}} of commencement, Alumni Hall is {{outfitted}} with patriotic red white and blue banners and flags. Commencement exercises begin each year at 1:50 pm {{as members of the}} senior class gather in the Stoutenburg Gymnasium and process through the campus, crossing by the Cushing Center and Hilary Hall and arriving at Alumni Hall for the commencement ceremony. The graduating class processes onto the quad to the designated seating area directly in front of Alumni Hall as a hired brass ensemble plays the Pomp and Circumstance March. If the weather is inclement, commencement takes place in the Thomas F. Sullivan Arena. The academic processional of the College's Mace, color guard, graduands, members of the monastic community, and the faculty can take over twenty minutes. The national anthem is performed by a student or students selected. The performer is usually a member of the Saint Anselm College Choir. Next, a student selected by the administration delivers the coveted student address that he/she submitted for consideration. This is followed by the College President's address. The faculty award of the year from the Saint Anselm College Chapter of the American Association of University Professors is presented to a deserving faculty member. The student award for service and citizenship is presented to a community service-minded senior in recognition for an outstanding community project. This award is not given every year, only when there is consensus among administration that a particular student is deserving. Honorary doctorates are then conferred among selected honorary degree recipients. After the keynote address by one of the honorary degree recipients, the graduates are awarded their degrees of Bachelor of Arts or Bachelor of Science. After the benediction, graduates flip their graduation <b>tassel</b> to the opposite side of their cap and process out to the recessional song as the Abbey bells resound throughout campus. Finally, family and friends meet with the new graduates to take photographs.|$|E
5000|$|Doctors in {{full dress}} wear a black Tudor bonnet with cord and <b>tassels</b> of the {{appropriate}} faculty colour. In the case of higher doctors (DSc, DLitt and LLD) the bonnet is of black velvet; for other doctors the bonnet is of black cloth.

5000|$|The Torah {{commanded}} that Israelites wear <b>tassels</b> or fringes (ẓiẓit, [...] ) {{attached to}} the corners of garments (see , [...] ). Numbers 15:39 records that the <b>tassels</b> were to serve as reminders to keep the Lord's commandments.|$|R
50|$|The galero {{continues}} to appear today in ecclesiastical heraldry {{as part of}} the achievement of the coat of arms of an armigerous Catholic cleric. The ecclesiastical hat replaces the helmet and crest, because those were considered too belligerent for men in the clerical state. The color of the hat and number of <b>tassels</b> indicate the cleric's place in the hierarchy. Generally, priests and ministers have a black hat with cords and <b>tassels,</b> the number depending upon their rank. Bishops generally use a green hat with green cords and six green <b>tassels</b> on each side, archbishops have likewise a green hat with green cords and ten green <b>tassels</b> on each side, and cardinals have a red hat with red cords and fifteen red <b>tassels</b> on each side. Depiction in arms can vary greatly depending on the artist's style.|$|R
25|$|The apex of {{the stem}} ends in the <b>tassel,</b> an {{inflorescence}} of male flowers. When the <b>tassel</b> is mature and conditions are suitably warm and dry, anthers on the <b>tassel</b> dehisce and release pollen. Maize pollen is anemophilous (dispersed by wind), and because of its large settling velocity, most pollen falls within a few meters of the <b>tassel.</b>|$|E
25|$|<b>Tassel</b> - In most universities, {{before the}} {{commencement}} ceremony, undergraduates' <b>tassel</b> {{are placed on}} the left position, and during the graduation procession students will received their degree scroll/diploma and then move their <b>tassel</b> to the right. Tassels are also color-coded.|$|E
25|$|Sometimes a <b>tassel</b> is {{attached}} to the hilt. During the Ming Dynasty these were usually passed through an openwork pommel, and in the Qing {{through a hole in the}} grip itself; modern swords usually attach the <b>tassel</b> to the end of the pommel. Historically these were likely used as lanyards, allowing the wielder to retain the sword in combat. There are some sword forms which utilize the <b>tassel</b> as an integral part of their swordsmanship style (sometimes offensively), while other schools dispense with sword tassels entirely. The movement of the <b>tassel</b> may have served to distract opponents, and some schools further claim that metal wires or thin silk cords were once worked into the tassels for impairing vision and causing bleeding when swept across the face. The tassel's use now is primarily decorative.|$|E
