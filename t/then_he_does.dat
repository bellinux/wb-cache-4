2500|$|If Rivers {{ever did}} come to access the veiled memory <b>then</b> <b>he</b> <b>does</b> not appear to make a note of it so {{the nature of the}} {{experience}} is open to conjecture. One such supposition was put forward by Pat Barker, in the second novel in her Regeneration Trilogy, The Eye in the Door. Whatever the case, in the words of Barker's character Billy Prior, Rivers's experience was traumatic enough to cause him to [...] "put his mind's eye out".|$|E
2500|$|The {{conditions}} at the Abu Ghraib prison, which Guillou claims to have visited as the first Western journalist, are described as excellent and even [...] "better than Swedish prisons" [...] (pp.249–250). The book was published two years before Saddam Hussein became President of Iraq in 1979. In his 2009 autobiography, Ordets makt och vanmakt (The Power and Powerlessness of the Word), Guillou states that quotes {{such as the ones}} cited could be considered true back <b>then.</b> <b>He</b> <b>does</b> however also write that Saddam Hussein, who at the time of publishing was the vice-president under President Ahmed Hassan Al Bakr, was the actual leader of Iraq.|$|E

2500|$|A lot of {{historical}} films sometimes feel like people reading a Wikipedia page to you onscreen, like just reciting [...] "and <b>then</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> that, and <b>then</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> that, and <b>then</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> this other thing" [...] – it's like a [...] "Greatest Hits" [...] compilation. We wanted {{the movie to}} be emotional and passionate. Our goal was to give you [...] "What does Alan Turing feel like?" [...] What does his story feel like? What'd it feel like to be Alan Turing? Can we create the experience of sort of [...] "Alan Turing-ness" [...] for an audience based on his life? ...|$|R
60|$|<b>Then</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> turn, {{and walked}} back to London with a trusting heart.|$|R
6000|$|... "No, that I {{am certain}} he would not," [...] cried Alice, enthusiastically; [...] "but, <b>then,</b> <b>he</b> <b>does</b> not {{know we are}} here, and will never think of looking for us in such an {{unlikely}} place." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It is {{four o'clock}} now; we dine at five o'clock, when {{the office is}} closed. Many dine at one, but my husband likes it when he has done his work, as <b>then</b> <b>he</b> <b>does</b> not need to hurry." ...|$|E
60|$|MALONE. Possibly not. <b>Then</b> <b>he</b> <b>does</b> without me: that's all. I daresay you are {{prepared}} for that. When a young lady writes {{to a young man}} to come to her quick, quick, quick, money seems nothing and love seems everything.|$|E
50|$|<b>Then</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> {{prolonged}} meditation at Lingkar Drak, a place {{blessed by}} Guru Padmasambhava.|$|R
60|$|And <b>then</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> {{not do it}} a {{bit like}} they {{do it on the}} stage.|$|R

6000|$|... "He does that," [...] Skinner agreed; [...] "that is what riles {{me in the}} fellow. He {{can play}} a ripping good game when he likes, but <b>then</b> <b>he</b> <b>does</b> not always like. However, as I said, we will give him another trial." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "If {{he ought}} to know <b>then</b> <b>he</b> <b>does</b> know," [...] said Mrs. Holt with great certainty. [...] "I am sure we may leave all that to Cecilia herself. If he is {{satisfied}} with her, {{it does not matter}} much who else may be dissatisfied." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh! there's much {{owing to}} the {{habitual}} languor of that long illness. That satirical mumble is the only trouble he will take to lift up his testimony, except when a thing is most decidedly his duty, and <b>then</b> <b>he</b> <b>does</b> it as England expects." ...|$|E
5000|$|... "He Goofy {{was someone}} who never really knew how stupid he was. He thought long and {{carefully}} before <b>he</b> <b>did</b> anything, and <b>then</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> it wrong".|$|R
6000|$|... "That is better!" [...] <b>he</b> murmured, and <b>then</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> {{not speak}} {{again until the}} landlord, with {{considerable}} skill, bandaged up the shoulder.|$|R
6000|$|<b>Then</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> never cease nor blinne Till John of the Scales house <b>he</b> <b>did</b> winne. When {{that he came}} John of the Scales, Up at the speere {{he looked}} then; ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Are they {{arrangements}} that couldn't possibly be altered?" [...] asked Mr. Perkins, with his quizzical smile. [...] "I shall be very sorry to lose you. In schools the rather stupid boys who work always {{do better than}} the clever boy who's idle, but when the clever boy works--why <b>then,</b> <b>he</b> <b>does</b> what you've done this term." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I have, {{but he only}} {{laughs and}} {{promises}} to behave, and <b>then</b> <b>he</b> <b>does</b> it again when I am so placed that I can't say anything. You will never understand, and I cannot explain, for {{it is only a}} look, or a word, or some little thing but I won't have it, {{and the best way to}} cure him is to put it out of his power to annoy me so." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It's true of him. But <b>then</b> <b>he</b> <b>does</b> {{not know}} what is his own, or what ought to be. He's almost the biggest fool I have ever known, and will do an {{injustice}} to that boy simply from ignorance." [...] Then he drafted his letter to Mr. Prosper, {{and gave it to}} Dolly to read. [...] "That's what I shall propose. The clerk can put it into proper language. He must offer less than he means to give." ...|$|E

60|$|<b>Then</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> {{the trick}} again. Mr. Coombes {{said it was}} the card next the coal-scuttle this time, and wanted to put five shillings on it.|$|R
60|$|So I said it again, and he {{said his}} again, and I said mine again, and <b>then</b> <b>he</b> <b>did,</b> and <b>then</b> I <b>did,</b> and <b>then</b> <b>he</b> <b>did,</b> and we kept on doing it, and doing it, and I never had such a good time, {{and he said}} the same. In my opinion there isn't {{anything}} that is as killing as one of those dear old ripe pensioners {{if you know how to}} snatch it out in a kind of a fresh sort of original way.|$|R
60|$|In {{the first}} place, I would {{leave out the}} Dative case. It confuses the plurals; and, besides, nobody ever knows when {{he is in the}} Dative case, except he {{discover}} it by accident--and <b>then</b> <b>he</b> <b>does</b> not know when or where it was that he got into it, or how long he has been in it, or how he is ever {{going to get out of}} it again. The Dative case is but an ornamental folly--it is better to discard it.|$|E
6000|$|... 'If a king thinks only of pleasure, <b>then</b> <b>he</b> <b>does</b> not {{interfere}} with matters of state. But if he is conscientious, he tries {{to do what he}} imagines to be his duty, and so he causes trouble. Look at Charles, for example. He was a very good man, and yet he caused a civil war. George the Third was a most exemplary character, but his stupidity lost us America, and nearly lost us Ireland. They were each succeeded by thoroughly bad men, who did far less harm.' ...|$|E
60|$|Yesterday was bright, calm, and frosty. I {{went to the}} Heights as I proposed: my {{housekeeper}} entreated me to bear {{a little}} note from her to her young lady, and I did not refuse, for the worthy woman was not conscious of anything odd in her request. The front door stood open, but the jealous gate was fastened, as at my last visit; I knocked and invoked Earnshaw from among the garden-beds; he unchained it, and I entered. The fellow is as handsome a rustic as need be seen. I took particular notice of him this time; but <b>then</b> <b>he</b> <b>does</b> his best apparently to make the least of his advantages.|$|E
5000|$|Andrew Thornton (4th): [...] "Dunwoody {{was a real}} legend. We {{agreed to}} stay {{together}} until we jumped the last, but <b>then</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> me half-a-length for third place!" ...|$|R
60|$|Even <b>then</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> {{not turn}} to her, but he answered. Curious to relate, though {{his heart was}} breaking, his voice was steady--steady as it always had been.|$|R
50|$|Reed was the {{promotion}} executive at NBC, for two years, and <b>then</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> voice-work for cartoons such as Disney's Gargoyles, Spider-Man and The Real Adventures of Jonny Quest.|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{may appear}} strange to you, Corny," [...] he said, [...] "to find so much {{depression}} in camp, after a debarkation that {{has certainly been}} successful, and a little affair that has given us, as they assure me, {{a couple of hundred}} prisoners. I tell you, however, my friend, it were better for this army to have seen its best corps annihilated, than to have lost the man it has. Howe was literally the soul of this entire force. He was a soldier by nature, and made all around him soldiers. As for the Commander-In-Chief, he does not understand you Americans, and will not use you as he ought; <b>then</b> <b>he</b> <b>does</b> not understand the nature of the warfare of this continent, and will be very likely to make a blunder. I'll tell you how it is, Corny; Howe had as much influence with Abercrombie, as he had with every one else; and an attempt will be made to introduce his mode of fighting; but such a man as Lord Howe requires another Lord Howe to carry out his own conceptions. That is the point on which, I fear, we shall fail." ...|$|E
6000|$|Ver. 7. [...] "If thou doest well, shalt thou not be accepted? and if thou doest not well, sin lieth at the door. And unto thee {{shall be}} his desire, and thou shalt rule over him." [...] "If thou do well." [...] Why, is not worshipping of God, well-doing? It may, and may not, {{even as the}} person that worships is found. If he be found righteous at his coming to worship, and if he worship {{according}} to rule, <b>then</b> <b>he</b> <b>does</b> well, then he is accepted of God; but if he be not found righteous before, be you sure he cannot do well, let the matter with which he worshippeth be wrong or right. [...] "Who can bring a clean thing out of an unclean?" [...] (John 14:4). Let Cain be clean, and his offering will be clean, because brought to God in a vessel that is clean; but if Cain be unclean, all the holy things he toucheth, or layeth up in his skirt, it is made unclean by the uncleanness of his person: [...] "And so is this nation before me, saith the Lord; and so is every work of their hands, and that which they offer there is unclean" [...] (Haggai 2:11-14).[21] ...|$|E
6000|$|But {{abstinence}} {{is not a}} {{good thing}} in itself. If it were, we should all be bound to abstain always from everything pleasant, and make ourselves as miserable and uncomfortable as possible, as some superstitious persons used to do in old times. Abstinence is only good when it is used for a good reason. If a man abstains from pleasure himself, to save up for his children; if he abstains from over eating and over drinking, to keep his mind clear and quiet; if he abstains from sleep and ease, in order to have time to see his business properly done; if he abstains from spending money on himself, in order to spend it for others; if he abstains from any habit, however harmless or pleasant, because he finds it lead him towards what is wrong, and put him into temptation; <b>then</b> <b>he</b> <b>does</b> right; then he is doing God's work; then he may expect God's blessing; then he is trying to do what we all prayed God to help us to do, when we said, [...] "Give us grace to use such abstinence;" [...] then he is doing, more or less, what St. Paul says he did, [...] "Keeping his body under, and bringing it into subjection." ...|$|E
6000|$|Paul was on {{the point}} of asking what <b>then</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> talk about, but {{discretion}} checked it and he said instead: [...] "Do you think he's unhappy at home?" ...|$|R
