5|$|A few holdouts {{remained}} for a time. The island of Monemvasia refused to surrender {{and it was}} first ruled {{for a short time}} by an Aragonese corsair. When the population drove him out they obtained the consent of Thomas to place themselves under the Pope's protection before the end of 1460. The Mani Peninsula, on the Morea's south end, resisted under a loose coalition of the local clans and then that area came under Venice's rule. <b>The</b> <b>very</b> <b>last</b> holdout was Salmeniko, in the Morea's northwest. Graitzas Palaiologos was the military commander there, stationed at Salmeniko Castle. While the town eventually surrendered, Graitzas and his garrison and some town residents held out in the castle until July 1461, when they escaped and reached Venetian territory.|$|E
5|$|All stories {{starring}} Jon Pertwee as the Third Doctor are complete, {{though many}} episodes no longer survive on their original videotapes and were only available from black-and-white overseas prints upon recovery; these episodes have subsequently been restored to colour {{using a variety}} of methods. In order of original transmissions, <b>the</b> <b>very</b> <b>last</b> Doctor Who master videotapes to be wiped were the first episodes of the 1974 serials Invasion of the Dinosaurs and Death to the Daleks.

Concerts were held on Saturdays, and anniversaries celebrated, but there were growing feelings of despondency as time passed with no sign of the ship. The toes on Blackborow's left foot became gangrenous from frostbite, and on 15 June had to be amputated by the surgeons Macklin and James McIlroy in the candle-lit hut.

According to Lactantius, the crowd listening to Diocletian's resignation speech believed, until <b>the</b> <b>very</b> <b>last</b> moment, that Diocletian would choose Constantine and Maxentius (Maximian's son) as his successors. It was not to be: Constantius and Galerius were promoted to Augusti, while Severus and Maximinus Daia, Galerius' nephew, were appointed their Caesars respectively.

25|$|Several {{elements}} recur in {{the films}} series. You can note the main sponsor {{by looking at the}} villain's cars, the security cars, the police cars, the gang's car, and so on. Usually, Toyota has been the main sponsor of the film series, supplying the films with civilian cars parked on the sidewalks, Crowns as taxis, Toyota Cressida as police cars, Hiace as security vans and money transports, and so on. There have been exceptions, notably Olsenbandens aller siste kupp (<b>The</b> Olsen-Gangs <b>very</b> <b>last</b> coup) from 1982, which was sponsored by Datsun.|$|R

The film was also issued in a very limited 2-disc LaserDisc release in November 1999, making it one of <b>the</b> <b>very</b> <b>last</b> feature films to ever be issued in this format, as LaserDiscs ceased manufacturing and distribution by the year's end, due in part to the growing popularity of DVDs.|$|E
5|$|The {{music video}} was {{released}} on Vevo on May 21, 2013. The video was directed by Rich Lee. The video features Levine and Emily Ratajkowski as his love interest, {{as well as the}} members of the band, covered in grey paint. Levine initially paints himself out of a purely white background and then paints Ratajowski in front of him. The last scenes feature the band member's instruments spraying paint when played continually, a girl dancing seductively, and Levine and his love interest passionately embracing - all while covered in grey paint. In <b>the</b> <b>very</b> <b>last</b> scene, Levine reverses what he has done, removing all the paint from the scene, leaving no trace of them behind.|$|E
5|$|Addie Joss {{was born}} in Woodland, Dodge County, Wisconsin. His parents Jacob and Theresa (née Staudenmeyer) worked as farmers; his father, a cheesemaker who was {{involved}} in local politics, had emigrated from Switzerland. A heavy drinker of alcohol, he died from liver complications in 1890, when Joss was 10 years old; Joss remained sober throughout his life {{as a result of his}} father's death. Joss attended elementary school in Juneau and Portage and high school at Wayland Academy in Beaver Dam, Wisconsin. By age 16 he finished high school and began teaching himself. He was offered a scholarship to attend St. Mary's College (also known as Sacred Heart College) in Watertown, where he played on the school's baseball team. He also attended the University of Wisconsin (now University of Wisconsin-Madison), where he studied engineering. Officials in Watertown were impressed with the quality of play of St. Mary's and put the team on a semipro circuit. During his time on the semipro circuit, Joss employed his unique pitching windup, which involved hiding the ball until <b>the</b> <b>very</b> <b>last</b> moment in his delivery.|$|E

40|$|Characterizes {{conflict}} {{and cooperation in}} the intertwined careers of Gunnar Myrdal and Dag Hammarskjöld as economists, actors in Swedish policy 1940 - 1947 and international civil servants, Myrdal being Executive Secretary of the UN ECE 1947 - 1957 and Hammarskjöld being General Secretary of the UN 1951 - 1961. In economics the difference between dynamic and neoclassical approaches are noted. It contrasts Myrdal’s very early formulation of growth oriented financial policy with <b>the</b> <b>very</b> <b>lasting</b> refusal of counter-cyclical policies of the Swedish government {{under the influence of}} Hammarskjöld. In regard to official US postwar policies their differences are highlighted from the pre-cold war period {{as well as from the}} early fifties, Myrdal defending a ‘universalist’ position trying to defend the ECE against power policy intrusion whereas Hammarskjöld wanted to ‘proceed with caution’ in regard to what he considered to be ‘a friendly government’. Their differences are traced to personal backgrounds while at the same time expressing principal dilemmas facing civil servants in international organisations in a political climate of strong tensions between national interests.
