An experimental apparatus to show the hot spot cooling of an IC chip using a <b>thermoelectric</b> <b>cooler</b> (TEC) is developed. The spot heating in very small area is achieved by applying CO 2 laser source and temperatures are measured using miniature thermocouples. The active effects of <b>thermoelectric</b> <b>cooler</b> on the hot spot cooling system such as rapid heat spreading in the chip and lowering the peak temperature around the hot spot region are investigated. The experimental results are simulated numerically using the TAS program, which the performance characteristics, such as Seebeck coefficient, electrical resistance and thermal conductivity of the <b>thermoelectric</b> <b>cooler</b> are searched by trial and error.

40|$|This paper {{described}} the study for heat transfer through <b>thermoelectric</b> <b>cooler</b> TEC {{by use of}} multistage thermoelectric module. To satisfy the heat dissipation of modern electronic element thermal designers have to increase fin area and fan speed to improve its cooling capacity. However the increase of fin area is restricted by the space. Besides the increase of fan speed would induce noise which damages human health. So air cooling by fan is hardly to meet the requirement of modern electronic component. Recently <b>thermoelectric</b> <b>cooler</b> TEC is applied to electronic cooling with the advantages of small size quietness and reliability. A typical <b>thermoelectric</b> <b>cooler</b> consists of p-type and n-type semiconductor pellets connected electrically in series and sandwiched between two ceramic substrates. Whenever direct current passes through the circuit it causes temperature differential between TEC sides. As a result one face of TEC which is called cold side will be cooled while its opposite face which is called hot side is simultaneously heated. The main problem {{over the use of}} TEC is the limited COP and its thermal performance. But these can be eliminated by use of multistage <b>thermoelectric</b> <b>cooler...</b>|$|R

40|$|Abstract. <b>Thermoelectric</b> <b>cooler</b> has the {{advantage}} of being portable, simple, compact, noiseless, reliable, and environmentally benign. It is quite suitable for transporting and storage for bio-medical products (such as vaccine and blood) which are very sensitive to temperature variation. However, the coefficient of performances (COP) and the cooling capacity of the thermoelectric coolers available in the open market are relatively low. In this study, the effort will be focused on the design of the heat transfer aspect for a <b>thermoelectric</b> blood <b>cooler</b> specific for bio-medical application. Optimized thickness at 0. 0025 m of a plate fin with length at 0. 598 m could be obtained through heat transfer analysis. Performance tests have been conducted to investigate the influence of cabinet temperature in the <b>thermoelectric</b> blood <b>cooler.</b> Experimental tests revealed the optimized plate fin can provide satisfactory cooling performance, and to cool down the cabinet until 2 o C within 40 minutes. Some tests including different voltage input, loading condition and ambient temperature tests for blood storage have been conducted as well to validate the quality of blood cold chain storage.
