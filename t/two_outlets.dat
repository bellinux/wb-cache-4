500|$|Y and H {{cylinder}} valves have <b>two</b> <b>outlets,</b> {{each with}} its own valve, allowing two regulators to be connected to the cylinder. If one regulator [...] "freeflows", which is a common failure mode, or ices up, which can happen in water below about 5°C, its valve can be closed and the cylinder breathed from the regulator connected to the other valve. The difference between an H-valve and a Y-valve is that the Y-valve body splits into two posts roughly 90° to each other and 45° from the vertical axis, looking like a Y, while an H-valve is usually assembled from a valve designed as part of a manifold system with an additional valve post connected to the manifold socket, with the valve posts parallel and vertical, which looks a bit like an H. Y-valves are also known as [...] "slingshot valves" [...] due to their appearance.|$|E
