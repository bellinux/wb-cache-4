Digital Spy's Daniel Kilkelly wrote that Lewis' renewed relationship with Audrey and their plans {{to go on a}} round-the-world cruise would cause a feud between her and David. Audrey's money is <b>tied</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> salon, so she asks David to sign it back to her so she can pay for the holiday. However, David refuses to sign the salon back as he thinks Lewis might be planning another fraud. Kilkelly said Lewis tries to play peacemaker and suggests postponing the trip until he can save the money himself, but Audrey insists David will co-operate and she tears up their contract.|$|E

25|$|Although timber barons orchestrate {{the illicit}} operations, {{including}} export, their operations are financed by international sources. This financing {{comes in the}} form of down payments of up to half the total sale from foreign buyers and loans from international banks that have branches in Antananarivo. The loans are critical, even in such a profitable industry, because without full payment, most of the capital gets <b>tied</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> stockpiles of logs waiting to be exported.|$|E
25|$|The {{official}} {{stance of}} the Irish Volunteers was that action {{would only be}} taken were the British authorities at Dublin Castle to attempt to disarm the Volunteers, arrest their leaders, or introduce conscription to Ireland. The IRB, however, was determined to use the Volunteers for offensive action while Britain was <b>tied</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> First World War. Their plan was to circumvent MacNeill's command, instigating a Rising, and to get MacNeill on board once the rising was a fait accompli.|$|E

Festers are the reincarnation of slave traders who ran their slave ship aground on Carnate, and left their slaves <b>tied</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> hold to be eaten by rats, rather than freeing them. Infernas are the trapped spirits of three children who accused eleven innocent people of being witches during the time of a Puritan settlement on the island. The eleven people were burnt alive.|$|E
25|$|In {{all schools}} of Hinduism, {{the meaning of}} life is <b>tied</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> {{concepts}} of karma (causal action), sansara (the cycle of birth and rebirth), and moksha (liberation). Existence is conceived as the progression of the ātman (similar to the western concept of a soul) across numerous lifetimes, and its ultimate progression towards liberation from karma. Particular goals for life are generally subsumed under broader yogas (practices) or dharma (correct living) which are intended to create more favorable reincarnations, though they are generally positive acts in this life as well. Traditional schools of Hinduism often worship Devas which are manifestations of Ishvara (a personal or chosen God); these Devas are taken as ideal forms to be identified with, as a form of spiritual improvement.|$|E
25|$|There is {{some debate}} amongst critics {{as to the}} meaning and purpose of this speech, {{although}} all tend {{to agree that the}} meaning is inherently <b>tied</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> elaborate language. Some critics (such as Stanley Wells) argue that the speech, with its wordiness, abstraction, strained allusions, and lengthy metaphors, is poorly written, evidence that Shakespeare was not yet in control of his medium. Proponents of this theory point to The Contention, where only seven lines are retained, with the argument being {{that the rest of the}} speech was cut from performance. L.C. Knights, by contrast, argues that the speech is deliberately excessive and highly-wrought because Margaret is trying to deflect the already confused and dejected Henry from accusing Suffolk of the murder.|$|E

25|$|The 1806 Invasion of Naples by Napoleon's forces was {{provoked}} when King Ferdinand I of the Two Sicilies {{joined the}} Third Coalition against Imperial France. The Kingdom of Naples was rapidly overrun by Imperial soldiers, but Hesse stubbornly held out at Gaeta. The garrison put up such fierce resistance {{that a large}} part of Masséna's Army of Naples was <b>tied</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> siege for nearly five months. This prevented Masséna from sending reinforcements to quell an uprising that had started in Calabria as well as allowing the British to land an expeditionary force and score a victory at the Battle of Maida. However, because the British failed to relieve the garrison of Gaeta, the city was finally captured in mid-July after French artillery smashed gaps in the city's defences.|$|E
25|$|However, {{during that}} same season Finley's wife sought a divorce, and would not accept {{a stake in the}} A's in a {{property}} settlement. With most of his money <b>tied</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> A's or his insurance empire, Finley had to sell the team. He agreed in principle to sell to businessman Marvin Davis, who would have moved the Athletics to Denver. However, just before Finley and Davis were due to sign a definitive agreement, the Raiders announced their move to Los Angeles. Oakland and Alameda County officials {{let it be known that}} they would not allow any prospective owner to break the Coliseum lease, forcing Davis to call off the deal. Forced to turn to local buyers, Finley sold the A's to San Francisco clothing manufacturer Walter A. Haas, Jr., president of Levi Strauss & Co. prior to the 1981 season. It would not be the last time that the Raiders directly affected the A's future.|$|E
25|$|Cornelia calls Dr. Wells back to {{the house}} to examine Richard's body. Dale asks Wells to hide the {{blueprint}} she took from Richard, because the others might think that she killed him for it. Reginald Beresford, a lawyer waiting in his car after he drove Richard to the house, comes inside. Reginald recognizes Jack, and the exposure of her fiancé makes Dale admit that she gave Wells the blueprint with the hidden room. Wells claims that he does not have the blueprint; Cornelia reveals other evidence incriminating him, and Anderson asks to question him alone. Wells knocks Anderson unconscious during the interrogation and drags him into another room. Before Wells can go to the hidden room, a stranger claiming to have lost his memory after he was attacked and <b>tied</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> garage appears at the terrace door.

500|$|The {{sales tax}} {{proposal}} caused a rift in the Democratic party generally and in Laffoon's administration specifically. As presiding {{officer of the}} Senate, Lieutenant Governor A. B. [...] "Happy" [...] Chandler had led opposition to the tax in the legislature. Highway Commissioner Ben Johnson sided with Chandler, as did former Laffoon supporters Allie Young and J. Dan Talbott. In retaliation, Laffoon vetoed $7 million in appropriations and a measure to cut property taxes {{at the end of}} the legislative session. Among the few pieces of legislation that passed during the session were bills reorganizing the highway department, making the state Board of Charities a partisan entity, and further removing the Fish and Game Commission from the control of sportsmen. A redistricting bill was hastily passed {{at the end of the}} session, reducing the number of congressional districts from 11 to 9, per the most recent census results, but charges of gerrymandering kept the bill <b>tied</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> courts, preventing it from taking effect in time for the 1932 congressional elections. Consequently, all of Kentucky's representatives that year were elected at-large. The Louisville Courier-Journal called the 1932 legislative session [...] "about the worst legislative session in Kentucky's history".|$|E
500|$|The United States Shipping Board made {{available}} a World War I cargo ship, the 4865 gross ton USS Mount Shasta, {{that had been}} <b>tied</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> James River for a decade. An Army mine vessel towed the hulk to sea [...] off Currituck Beach Light. The next morning, August 11, Major Harbert A. Dargue led nine B-3A and B-5 bombers of the 2nd Bombardment Group, little different from the Martin NBS-1s that had destroyed the Ostfriesland, to locate and attack the Mount Shasta, but a combination of bad weather and failed communications resulted in the planes being unable to locate the ship. Worse, the failure was witnessed by several dozen reporters, movie newsreel crews, a broadcast team from NBC radio, and observers from both the Army and Navy, some aboard airplanes that did find the ship. The Navy responded immediately with scornful public mocking of the effort. When a second attempt three days later scored only a few hits with inadequately small 300- and 600-pound bombs, and failed to sink the Mount Shasta, a pair of United States Coast Guard ocean-going tugboats used small guns to sink it.|$|E

500|$|Before Kościuszko {{left for}} France, he {{collected}} his back pay, wrote a will, and entrusted it to Jefferson as executor. Kościuszko and Jefferson had become firm friends by 1797 and thereafter corresponded {{for twenty years}} {{in a spirit of}} mutual admiration. Jefferson wrote that [...] "He is as pure a son of liberty as I have ever known." [...] In the will, Kościuszko left his American estate to be sold to buy the freedom of black slaves, including Jefferson's own, and to educate them for independent life and work. Several years after Kościuszko's death, Jefferson, aged 77, pleaded inability to act as executor due to age and the numerous legal complexities of the bequest, which was <b>tied</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> courts until 1856. Jefferson recommended his friend John Hartwell Cocke, who also opposed slavery, as executor, but Cocke likewise declined to execute the bequest. [...] The case of Kościuszko's American estate went three times to the U.S. Supreme Court. He had made four wills, three of which postdated the American one. None of the money that Kościuszko had earmarked for the manumission and education of African Americans in the United States was ever used for that purpose. Though the American will was never carried out, its legacy went to found an educational institute for African Americans in the United States—at Newark, New Jersey, in 1826, bearing Kościuszko's name.|$|E
500|$|Among the {{products}} Boulton {{sought to make}} in his new facility were sterling silver plate for those able to afford it, and Sheffield plate, silver-plated copper, for those less well off. [...] Boulton {{and his father had}} long made small silver items, but there is no record of large items in either silver or Sheffield plate being made in Birmingham before Boulton did so. [...] To make items such as candlesticks more cheaply than the London competition, the firm made many items out of thin, die-stamped sections, which were shaped and joined together. [...] One impediment to Boulton's work was the lack of an assay office in Birmingham. [...] The silver toys long made by the family firm were generally too light to require assaying, but silver plate had to be sent over [...] to the nearest assay office, at Chester, to be assayed and hallmarked, with the attendant risks of damage and loss. [...] Alternatively they could be sent to London, but this exposed them to the risk of being copied by competitors. Boulton wrote in 1771, [...] "I am very desirous of becoming a great silversmith, yet I am determined not to take up that branch in the large way I intended, unless powers can be obtained to have a marking hall [...] at Birmingham." [...] Boulton petitioned Parliament for the establishment of an assay office in Birmingham. [...] Though the petition was bitterly opposed by London goldsmiths, he was successful in getting Parliament to pass an act establishing assay offices in Birmingham and Sheffield, whose silversmiths had faced similar difficulties in transporting their wares. [...] The silver business proved not to be profitable due to the opportunity cost of keeping a large amount of capital <b>tied</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> inventory of silver. [...] The firm continued to make large quantities of Sheffield plate, but Boulton delegated responsibility for this enterprise to trusted subordinates, involving himself little in it.|$|E
