5|$|Amira goes to Yusef for help, {{saying she}} needs him on her side, {{threatening}} to tell Zainab that Yusef {{bought her a}} plane ticket {{if he does not}} help her get Syed back. She convinces Zainab to talk to Yusef, and when Yusef sees 15-year-old Ben Mitchell (Joshua Pascoe), who has recently come out as homosexual, running out of Christian's flat, he asks if Christian acted inappropriately. At first Ben says nothing happened but later Ben tells Yusef that Christian <b>touched</b> <b>him,</b> and they tell Ben's father, Phil. This turns out to be untrue, but leads to Christian leaving Syed and Walford.|$|E
5|$|However, Osborn had {{no control}} over his Super-Adaptoid abilities; he would {{automatically}} absorb the powers of any superhuman he touched, even if he did not consciously want to. He was also limited in how many powers his body could hold, as the A.I.M. scientists warned him that absorbing too many powers at once could overload his systems. In the end, he inadvertently absorbed the abilities of all the Avengers and New Avengers when they all <b>touched</b> <b>him</b> at once, and the unstable combination of their multiple different powers caused significant damage to his body chemistry, resulting in him going into a coma. After he regained consciousness, these powers were apparently burnt out, returning him to his Goblin-level strength instead.|$|E
5|$|Mariano {{was told}} that this refined cloth was {{restricted}} for use only by the bishop of the city. Mariano {{went to see the}} prelate, who was surprised by the request. He ordered an inquiry of Manuel, directed by the priest of Oncogate (Quispicanchi), a village close to the mountain. On June 12, 1783, the commission ascended Qullqipunku with Mariano; they found Manuel dressed in white and shining with a bright light. Blinded, they retreated, returning with a larger party. On their second try they reached the boy. But when they <b>touched</b> <b>him,</b> he was transformed into a tayanka bush (Baccharis odorata) with the crucified Christ hanging from it. Thinking the party had harmed his friend, Mariano fell dead on the spot. He was buried under the rock where Manuel had last appeared.|$|E

25|$|Ishwar Chandra Bandyopadhyay {{was born}} in a Hindu Brahmin family to Thakurdas Bandyopadhyay and Bhagavati Devi at Birsingha village in the Ghatal {{subdivision}} of Paschim Midnapore District on 26 September 1820. At the age of 6, he went to Calcutta and started living in Bhagabat Charan's house in Burrabazar, where Thakurdas had already been staying for some years. Ishwar felt at ease amidst Bhagabat's large family and settled down comfortably in no time. Bhagabat's youngest daughter Raimoni's motherly and affectionate feelings towards Ishwar <b>touched</b> <b>him</b> deeply and had a strong influence on his later revolutionary work towards the upliftment of women's status in India.|$|E

25|$|On April 30, 1988, {{during a}} home {{game against the}} New York Mets, with two out {{in the top of}} the ninth inning, umpire Dave Pallone made a late call at first base that allowed what would be the {{eventual}} game-winning run. Rose argued the call vehemently and forcefully pushed the umpire. Rose, who only appeared to contact Pallone with his shoulder and forearm, told reporters after the game he shoved Pallone only after the umpire made contact with him; he said a scratch near his left eye proved Pallone <b>touched</b> <b>him</b> first. In his 1990 book, Pallone claimed that scratch was self-inflicted in the clubhouse after the ejection. Cincinnati fans showered the field with objects including radios and cigarette lighters.|$|E
25|$|The Colts {{took the}} opening kickoff and stormed down the field. James gained 39 {{yards on the}} first five plays of the drive, and then Manning {{finished}} it with a 31-yard touchdown pass to Stokley. Denver responded on their ensuing drive, advancing the ball 49 yards in 12 plays and taking 8:13 off the clock. Jason Elam capped off the drive with a 49-yard field goal to cut their deficit to 7–3, {{but it was as}} close as Denver would ever get {{for the rest of the}} game. After the kickoff, Harrison caught three passes for 70 yards, including a pass in which he made a diving catch around three Denver players. All of them thought Harrison was down by contact and started to leave the field, but no one had actually <b>touched</b> <b>him,</b> and Harrison got back up and ran 46 yards for a touchdown.|$|E
25|$|Mariano's first {{experience}} with art was at fours years old with his cousin, teaching him how to draw simple shapes. He and his brother, Jonathan Ching who would also grow up to become an artist, would spend their time to draw instead of playing outside. He was greatly influenced by the anime Mazinger Z and Voltes V which was widely popular during his youth. They would significantly affect his future works. Reaching his high school years, his parents reminded him to think carefully about his life career. They {{said there is no}} money in art and should consider medicine or engineering as career and to make art as a hobby. But despite his parents' constant reminder, Mariano still pursued the road of becoming an artist. He enrolled to a lot of art workshops to hone his skills. One of the workshops that he attended became the turn point of his life. At the art workshop which is headed by Elemer Borogan and Gina Morales, the art style of the paintings has <b>touched</b> <b>him</b> and made him to decide to switch from his fourth year engineering major to painting major in University of the Philippines. During his years in University of the Philippines, he co-founded the art group Surrounded by Water. There, he found his future wife, Yasmin Sison which {{is also a member of}} Surrounded by Water. Mariano Ching, at that time, was still new at the art scene and he has not garnered any recognition yet.|$|E

500|$|Talk of {{a sequel}} to Toy Story began around {{a month after the}} film's opening, in December 1995. A few days after the {{original}} film's release, Lasseter was traveling with his family and found a young boy clutching a Woody doll at an airport. Lasseter described how the boy's excitement to show it to his father <b>touched</b> <b>him</b> deeply. [...] Lasseter realized that his character no longer belonged to him only, but rather it belonged to others, as well. [...] The memory was a defining factor in the production of Toy Story 2, with Lasseter moved to create a great film for that child and for everyone else who loved the characters.|$|E
500|$|In a 1980 {{interview}} with Playboy magazine, John Lennon expressed his {{doubts about the}} notion of [...] "subconscious" [...] plagiarism, saying: [...] "He must have known, you know. He's smarter than that... He could have changed a couple of bars in that song and nobody could ever have <b>touched</b> <b>him,</b> but he {{just let it go}} and paid the price. Maybe he thought God would just sort of let him off." [...] Ringo Starr's reaction was more charitable: [...] "There's no doubt that the tune is similar but how many songs have been written with other melodies in mind? George's version is much heavier than The Chiffons – he might have done it with the original {{in the back of his}} mind, but he's just very unlucky that someone wanted to make it a test case in court." ...|$|E
500|$|Eva Perón {{has often}} been {{credited}} with organizing the rally of thousands that freed Juan Perón from prison on 17 October 1945. This version of events was popularized in the movie version of the Lloyd Webber musical. Most historians, however, agree that this version of events is unlikely. At the time of Perón's imprisonment, Eva was still merely an actress. She had no political clout with the various labor unions, and it is claimed {{that she was not}} well-liked within Perón's inner circle, nor was she liked by many within the film and radio business at this point. When Juan Perón was imprisoned, Eva Duarte was suddenly disenfranchised. In reality, the massive rally that freed Perón from prison was organized by the various unions, such as General Labor Confederation, or CGT as they came to be known. To this day, the date of 17 October is something of a holiday for the Justicialist Party in Argentina (celebrated as Día de la Lealtad, or [...] "Loyalty Day"). What would follow was shocking and nearly unheard of. The well connected and politically rising star, Juan Peron, married Eva. Despite Eva's childhood illegitimacy, and having an uncertain reputation, Peron was in love with Eva, and her loyal devotion to him even while he had been under arrest <b>touched</b> <b>him</b> deeply, and so he married her, providing a respectability she had never known. Eva and Juan were married discreetly in a civil ceremony in Junín on 18 October 1945 and in a church wedding on 9 December 1945.|$|E

500|$|Zacharias {{was born}} in Madras, India. He is descended from {{a woman of the}} Nambudiri Brahmin caste and a Christian man of the Boatman caste. His mother was from Madras (now Chennai) while his father was from Kerala. He grew up in Delhi. According to Zacharias, before her marriage, Swiss German missionaries had spoken to his Brahmin {{ancestor}} about Christianity and she had converted and had been made an outcast by her Brahmin family and community. Zacharias grew up in a nominal Anglican household, and says that he was an atheist until the age of 17 when he tried to commit suicide by swallowing poison. While in the hospital, a local Christian worker brought him a Bible and told his mother to read to him from John 14. [...] Zacharias says that it was [...] that <b>touched</b> <b>him</b> and meant to him as the defining paradigm: [...] "Because I live, you also will live." [...] He said that he thought, [...] "This may be my only hope: A new way of living. Life as defined by the Author of Life." [...] and that he committed his life to Christ praying, [...] "Jesus if You are the one who gives life as it is meant to be, I want it. Please get me out of this hospital bed well, and I promise I will leave no stone unturned in my pursuit of truth." [...] In 1966 Zacharias emigrated with his family to Canada, earning his undergraduate degree from the Ontario Bible College in 1972 (now Tyndale University College & Seminary) and his M.Div. from Trinity International University. In 1990 Mr. Zacharias did a 2-3 month sabbatical at Ridley Hall in the town of Cambridge. Zacharias has multiple honorary doctoral degrees.|$|E
