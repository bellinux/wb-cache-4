5|$|In a dogfight, {{particularly}} when attacking Allied aircraft in a Lufbery circle, Marseille would often favour dramatically reducing the throttle and even lowering the flaps <b>to</b> <b>reduce</b> <b>speed</b> and shorten his turn radius, {{rather than the}} standard procedure of using full throttle throughout.|$|E
5|$|Dartmouth—faster than Bristol—closed to {{effective}} engagement range with the Austro-Hungarian ships, and opened fire. A shell from Dartmouth struck Novara, {{at which point}} the Austro-Hungarian ships laid a smoke screen in order to close the distance. Dartmouth was struck several times, and by 11:00, Acton ordered the ship <b>to</b> <b>reduce</b> <b>speed</b> to allow Bristol to catch up. Novara was hit several more times, and her main feed pumps and starboard auxiliary steam pipe had been damaged, which caused the ship to begin losing speed. At 11:05, Acton turned away in an attempt to separate Saida from Novara and Helgoland. At this point, Sankt Georg was approaching the scene, which prompted Acton to temporarily withdraw to consolidate his forces. This break in the action was enough time for the Austro-Hungarians to save the crippled Novara; Saida took the ship under tow while Helgoland covered them.|$|E
5|$|The High Seas Fleet {{managed to}} punch through the British light forces without drawing the {{attention}} of Jellicoe's battleships, and subsequently reached Horns Reef by 04:00 on 1June. Off Helgoland, Grosser Kurfürst had taken in so much water that she was forced <b>to</b> <b>reduce</b> <b>speed.</b> She fell out of formation, but later rejoined the fleet outside the Schillig roadstead. Upon reaching Wilhelmshaven, Grosser Kurfürst went into harbor while several other battleships took up defensive positions in the outer roadstead. The ship was transferred to Hamburg where she was repaired in AG Vulcan's large floating dock. Repair work was completed by 16 July. In {{the course of the}} battle, Grosser Kurfürst fired a total of 135 shells from her main battery and 216 rounds from her 15cm guns. She was hit by eight large-caliber shells, which killed fifteen men and wounded ten.|$|E

5|$|Watney {{begins the}} 90-sol journey to Schiaparelli and the pre-positioned Ares IV MAV. To {{rendezvous}} with Hermes, Watney removes many components from the MAV, including the nose cone, to lighten it, {{replacing it with}} a piece of the Hab's canvas. As the MAV fails to reach the required speed and altitude, Lewis is forced to use maneuvering thrusters to change course and explosive decompression of Hermess internal atmosphere <b>to</b> <b>reduce</b> <b>speed.</b> When even that is not enough, Commander Lewis uses a Manned Maneuvering Unit, but still cannot reach Watney. Watney pierces the glove of his pressure suit and uses the escaping air to propel himself towards Lewis, effectively rescuing him after being alone for 560 Sols on Mars.|$|E
25|$|Initially {{everything}} went as planned, {{but as the}} journey progressed, the wind started {{to pick up and}} later developed into a fierce storm, which created difficulties for the ships. The crews had to increase the internal distance between the ships, and they were also forced <b>to</b> <b>reduce</b> <b>speed.</b>|$|E

50|$|In {{places where}} 20 mph speeds are desired but where {{excessive}} speeds (85th percentile speed of 24 mph or above) occur, 20 mph zones are recommended. These {{have to use}} traffic calming measures <b>to</b> <b>reduce</b> <b>speeds</b> <b>to</b> below 20 mph.|$|R
25|$|The {{report was}} {{critical}} of the crew's actions, particularly for failing <b>to</b> <b>reduce</b> <b>speed</b> before investigating the noises emanating from the bow, and for being unaware that the list was being caused by water entering the vehicle deck. There were also general criticisms of the delays in sounding the alarm, the passivity of the crew, {{and the lack of}} guidance from the bridge.|$|E
25|$|The Tōkaidō Shinkansen often {{experiences}} {{heavy snow}} {{in the area around}} Maibara Station in winter. Trains have <b>to</b> <b>reduce</b> <b>speed,</b> which can disrupt the timetable. Sprinkler systems were later installed, but delays of 10 to 20 minutes still occur during snowy weather. Additionally, treefalls related to excess snow have caused service interruptions. Along the route of the Jōetsu Shinkansen, winter snow can be very heavy, with snow depths of two to three metres, so the line is equipped with stronger sprinklers and slab track, to mitigate the effects of deep snow.|$|E
25|$|Following {{the deaths}} of Senna and fellow Grand Prix driver Roland Ratzenberger at Imola in 1994, many Grand Prix {{circuits}} were modified in order <b>to</b> <b>reduce</b> <b>speed</b> and increase driver safety. As a consequence of this the entry from Hangar Straight into Stowe Corner was modified in 1995 {{so as to make}} its entry less dangerous. In addition, the flat-out Abbey kink was modified to a chicane in just 19 days before the 1994 GP. Parts of the circuit, such as the starting grid, are 17 metres wide, complying with the latest safety guidelines.|$|E

40|$|Speeding {{is still}} common {{practise}} on many roads {{and contributes to}} {{a significant number of}} crashes. Intelligent Speed Assistance (ISA) systems aim <b>to</b> <b>reduce</b> <b>speeding</b> in a more or less intrusive manner. This is promising, however, the acceptability of ISA systems is still very low. Another promising approach to_reduce speeding is by improving the credibility of speed limits. A driving simulator study is conducted to investigate the effect of credibility, with or without using an open informative and warning ISA. The results show that both ISA and credibility of speed limits are effective measures <b>to</b> <b>reduce</b> <b>speeding.</b> Non-ISA users appear to be more sensitive for the credibility of speed limits than ISA users.

50|$|The track's layout {{has changed}} {{slightly}} {{from its original}} layout. It appears that the curve prior to where the pits are now was tightened {{to create a more}} pronounced corner ahead of the pits, and perhaps <b>to</b> <b>reduce</b> <b>speeds</b> on the racing line going past the new pit exit. On {{the opposite side of the}} lake, where start/finish used to be located, a chicane has been added at the first high speed bend along that stretch. Also, on the initial descending run along the lake, there has been another chicane added <b>to</b> <b>reduce</b> <b>speeds</b> into the following corner that has limited run-off. Therefore, the original course had slightly shorter length of 6.186 km (3.844 mi).|$|R
25|$|In July 1972, Air National Guard units began {{supporting}} Air Force tanker {{task forces}} overseas with second-line KC-97 Stratofreighter propeller-driven tankers and volunteer crews when needed. Triggered by a 1974 decision by Secretary of Defense James R. Schlesinger to save money, the Ohio Air National Guard's 145th Air Refueling Squadron acquired the ANG's first jet tanker in April 1975 {{when it began}} converting from KC-97Ls to KC-135A Stratotankers. Altogether, the Air Force transferred 128 older KC-135s to the air reserve components to retire the slow prop-driven tankers, which modern fighters had <b>to</b> <b>reduce</b> <b>speed</b> to nearly stall speed in order to refuel from.|$|E
25|$|By then, the {{aircraft}} had insufficient speed to abort the landing. Aware that {{the aircraft}} most likely would overrun, the commander opted to not steer {{it off the}} left {{where there was a}} steep descent, or to the right where there were rocks. As a last resort, the commander attempted <b>to</b> <b>reduce</b> <b>speed</b> by skidding the aircraft by first steering it right, and then abruptly to the left. The aircraft overran the runway at 22.8 seconds after touchdown, at 07:32:37. At the same time, the crash alarm was activated by AFIS. The aircraft slid off the runway at about a forty-five degree angle, roughly north-west.|$|E
25|$|The W.2B/23C engines {{upon which}} the Welland was based {{produced}} 1,700lbf (7.58kN) of thrust each, giving the aircraft a maximum speed of 417mph (670km/h) at 3,000m {{and a range of}} 1,006miles (1,610km). It incorporated a hydraulically driven engine starter developed by Rolls-Royce, which was automated following the press of a starter button in the cockpit. The engines also drove hydraulic and vacuum pumps as well as a generator via a Rotol gearbox fixed on the forward wing spar; the cockpit was also heated by bleed air from one of the engines. The acceleration rate of the engines was manually controlled by the pilot; rapid engine acceleration would frequently induce compressor stalls early on; the likelihood of compressor stalls was effectively eliminated upon further design refinements of both the Welland engine and the Meteor itself. At high speeds, the Meteor had a tendency to lose directional stability, often during unfavourable weather conditions, leading to a 'snaking' motion; this could be easily resolved by throttling back <b>to</b> <b>reduce</b> <b>speed.</b>|$|E

Olympic officials claimed the changes were [...] "not for safety reasons but to accommodate the emotional state of the lugers". In addition, {{the start of the}} men's luge was moved to the women's starting point <b>to</b> <b>reduce</b> <b>speed,</b> while the start of the women's luge was also moved farther down the track.|$|E

Shortly before 16:00 on 25 May, Tovey detached the aircraft carrier [...] and four light cruisers to shape a course that would position her to launch her torpedo bombers. At 22:00, Victorious launched the strike, which comprised six Fairey Fulmar fighters and nine Fairey Swordfish torpedo bombers of 825 Naval Air Squadron, led by Lt Cdr Eugene Esmonde. The inexperienced aviators nearly attacked Norfolk on their approach; the confusion alerted Bismarcks anti-aircraft gunners.|$|E

500|$|The {{initial action}} was fought {{primarily}} by the British and German battlecruiser formations in the afternoon, but by 18:00, the Grand Fleet approached the scene. Fifteen minutes later, Jellicoe gave the order to turn and deploy the fleet for action. The transition from their cruising formation caused congestion with the rear divisions, forcing Marlborough {{and many of the}} other ships <b>to</b> <b>reduce</b> <b>speed</b> to [...] to avoid colliding with each other.
