25|$|The light-front coupled cluster (LFCC) {{method is}} a {{particular}} form of truncation for the infinite coupled system of integral equations for light-front wave functions. The system of equations <b>that</b> <b>comes</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> field-theoretic Schrödinger equation also requires regularization, to make the integral operators finite. The traditional Fock-space truncation of the system, where the allowed number of particles is limited, typically disrupts the regularization by removing infinite parts that would otherwise cancel against parts that are retained. Although {{there are ways to}} circumvent this, they are not completely satisfactory.|$|E
25|$|The raw {{material}} used for {{these kinds of}} soap is olive oil. The Tripoli soap is also composed of: honey, essential oils, and natural aromatic {{raw material}}s like flowers, petals, and herbs. The soaps are dried in the sun, in a dry atmosphere, allowing the evaporation of the water that served to mix the different ingredients. The drying operation lasts for almost three months. As the water evaporates, a thin white layer appears on the soap surface, from the soda <b>that</b> <b>comes</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> sea salts. The craftsman brushes the soap very carefully with his hand until the powder trace is entirely eliminated.|$|E

As a perfect emitter of radiation, a hot material with black body behavior would create an efficient infrared heater, particularly in space or {{in a vacuum}} where convective heating is unavailable. They are also useful in telescopes and cameras as anti-reflection surfaces to reduce stray light, and to gather information about objects in high-contrast areas (for example, observation of planets in orbit around their stars), where blackbody-like materials absorb light <b>that</b> <b>comes</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> wrong sources.|$|E

25|$|Guazzini's latest moves include renting the Parc des Princes, Stade de France, {{and most}} {{recently}} King Baudouin Stadium for big games, and using pink jerseys. Stade Français are heavily criticised by old-timers, especially in France's rugby bastions in the south, for their innovative spirit which tends to hurt traditional image and values of rugby such as humility and seriousness. Some people are wary of the club's relation {{to the world of}} media and show business (players are regularly invited as TV show guests). The critiques can also be explained by the historic Paris vs provinces divide and some form of acrimony {{in the rest of the}} country for everything <b>that</b> <b>comes</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> capital. Others consider it is good for rugby in its quest to maintain itself as France's second most popular sport after Association football and shed its image as a gross rural south-western form of fistfight.|$|E
25|$|The Northern and Western {{parts of}} the city, which are closer to the Fijeh springs, receive better service than the Southern and Eastern parts {{that are at the}} end of the {{distribution}} network. Service is also better in winter when the yield of the spring is highest. During winter residents in the Northwestern parts of Damascus typically receive a continuous flow of water, while residents in the Southeastern {{parts of the}} city receive water for only a few hours per day or even every couple of days during summer. For example, the town of Sahenya, 16km south-west of Damascus, was for 10 days without water in 2006. Most houses in Damascus have rooftop tanks to store water during periods of supply. Many houses have dual plumbing systems, with one tap for water that comes directly from the network and another tap for water <b>that</b> <b>comes</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> rooftop tank. As a consequence, many residents do not perceive a water crisis during most of the year, because they have sufficient water either from the network or from their rooftop tanks.|$|E
25|$|Research on priming and {{practice}} use single word tests to assess {{for the presence}} of TOT states. The first letter of the target word or a similar-sounding word is given in order to prime for the target word. Evidence <b>that</b> <b>comes</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> usefulness of priming {{and practice}} in reducing TOT states is that most information in TOT states is low-frequency; that is, it has not been used or recalled for some time. The recency of information use can influence the retrieval process of that information. The presentation of a prime is only needed once for it to facilitate TOT state resolution. Support for priming has been found in that when individuals are given the first letter of the word they are trying to recall, {{they are more likely to}} overcome their TOT state. When the prime is a related word instead of the first letter, an interesting effect occurs: When the prime word has similar phonology to the target word, an increase in the frequency of TOT states and a higher frequency of correctly recalled words when the TOT state is resolved is observed. Incorrect words come to mind involuntarily that share similar phonological features with the target word. Thus, phonological similarity can both decrease and increase TOT states. However, it is possible to fix this problem by changing the syntactic class of the priming word. Priming words that are in the same syntactic class as the target word create no difference in TOT state resolution. The TOT state resolution was the same for priming words in the same syntactic class and unrelated priming words. If the priming word is being listed in conjunction with other unrelated priming words, then the position is of importance. The earlier in the list the priming word is, the less likely it is to help resolve the TOT state.|$|E

500|$|Legend of Mana, {{released}} for the PlayStation in 1999, features music {{composed by}} Yoko Shimomura. She had previously composed for several Square games including Live A Live and Parasite Eve and had originally joined Square {{for the purpose}} of composing music for fantasy role-playing games. She was initially hesitant to compose for the Mana series, as she felt that it was so associated with the music of Ito and Kikuta. In 2002, Shimomura said that of all her compositions to date, she considered the soundtrack to Legend the one that best expresses herself. Shimomura claims that she prefers [...] "passionate music <b>that</b> <b>comes</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> heart", and that she has to [...] "feel the emotions of a piece in the extreme before I am able to write" [...] the music by putting herself in the same mood as the piece is supposed to be in.

Shimomura carefully chose the songs to be included on the album based on their apparent popularity among fans and how suitable they are for orchestra. In addition to the soundtrack album, a promotional album of music from Legend of Mana was produced and was included with preorders of the game in North America.|$|E
500|$|Discussing the {{apparent}} {{failure of the}} cinematic universe's first team-up film, , to establish a successful equivalent to the MCU, Todd VanDerWerff noted that where the MCU has a television-like [...] "showrunner" [...] in Feige, [...] "the visionary behind Marvel's entire slate", the DCEU has director Zack Snyder, whose DC films [...] "seemingly start from the assumption that people have come not to see an individual story but {{a long series of}} teases for other ones. It's like he knows {{what he needs to do}} but can't focus on the task at hand. TV certainly isn't immune to that problem, but shows that get caught up in high-concept premises and big-picture thinking before doing the necessary legwork to establish characters and their relationships tend to be canceled." [...] Subsequently, in May 2016, Warner Bros. gave oversight of the DCEU to Johns and executive Jon Berg in an attempt to [...] "unify the disparate elements of the DC movies" [...] and emulate Marvel's success. The two were made producers on the Justice League films, on top of Johns' involvement in several [...] "solo" [...] films, such as the post-production process of Suicide Squad or the writing process of a standalone Batman film. After the successful release of Wonder Woman in June 2017, DC decided to begin deemphasizing the shared nature of their films, with DC Entertainment president Diane Nelson stating, [...] "Our intention, certainly, moving forward is using the continuity to help make sure nothing is diverging in a way that doesn’t make sense, but there’s no insistence upon an overall story line or interconnectivity in that universe... Moving forward, you’ll see the DC movie universe being a universe, but one <b>that</b> <b>comes</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> heart of the filmmaker who’s creating them." [...] Additionally, DC began focusing on films [...] "completely separate from everything else, set entirely outside the" [...] DCEU as part of a new label, with the first centered on the Joker.|$|E
