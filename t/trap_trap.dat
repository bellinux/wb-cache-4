Preconcentration efficiency of 95 ± 5 % was found. The detection limits reached were 29 and 143 pg ml- 1 Sn, respectively, for 120 second preconcentration period and on-line atomization mode without any preconcentration. The interference extent of other hydride forming elements (As, Se, Sb and Bi) on tin determination was found negligible in both modes of operation.

40|$|The Bacillus subtilis trpEDCFBA operon is {{regulated}} by a transcription attenuation mechanism {{controlled by the}} trp RNA-binding attenuation protein (<b>TRAP).</b> <b>TRAP</b> binds to 11 (G/U) AG repeats in the trp leader transcript and prevents formation of an antiterminator, which allows formation of an intrinsic terminator (attenuator). Previously, formation of the attenuator RNA structure {{was believed to be}} solely responsible for signaling RNA polymerase (RNAP) to halt transcription. However, base substitutions that prevent formation of the antiterminator, and thus allow the attenuator structure to form constitutively, do not result in efficient transcription termination. The observation that the attenuator requires the presence of TRAP bound to the nascent RNA to cause efficient transcription termination suggests TRAP has an additional role in causing termination at the attenuator. We show that the trp attenuator is a weak intrinsic terminator due to low GC content of the hairpin stem and interruptions in the U-stretch following the hairpin. We also provide evidence that termination at the trp attenuator requires forward translocation of RNA polymerase and that TRAP binding to the nascent transcript can induce this activity...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. This work {{is focused}} on {{recombination}} processes in low temperature plasma down to 10 K. When reaching this low temperature in atomic gases, Collisional Radiative Recombination (CRR) where extra electron carries off energy, is dominant. A few accomplished CRR experiments do not follow theoretical predictions of very strong negative dependence. We propose to study transition from dissociative and radiative recombination to CRR at cryogenic temperatures. For this study we are constructing electron-ion trap. Electrons will be trapped in combination of electrostatic and magnetic field (magnetic-mirror like). Ions will be trapped in 3 D potential minimum {{in the middle of}} the trap formed by space charge of trapped electrons. The trapped electrons and ions will be cooled by collisions with helium buffer gas. From the decay of the ion density recombination rate coefficient will be obtained.

In a guinea pig model of ST-segment elevation acute myocardial infarction (AMI), local application of hirudin, a thrombin antagonist, significantly decreased AMI-induced ST-segment elevation in a dose-dependent manner. Hirudin-induced (5 antithrombin units [ATU]) decrease in ST elevation was reversed by 250 nmol/L thrombin receptor activator peptide (<b>TRAP).</b> <b>TRAP</b> (250 nmol/L [100 μL]) significantly induced ST-segment elevation in hearts without AMI. The TRAP effect was blocked by 4 mg/kg glibenclamide and 4 mg/kg HMR 1098 and partially blocked by 3 mg/kg 5 HD. Pinacidil (0. 45 mg/kg) simulated the effect of TRAP (250 nmol/L [100 μL]) on hearts without AMI. Moreover, single-channel recordings showed that TRAP induced ATP-sensitive K+ channel (KATP channel) activity, and this effect was blocked by HMR 1098 but not 5 HD. Finally, TRAP significantly shortened the monophasic action potential (MAP) at 90 % repolarization (MAP 90) and epicardial MAP (EpiMAP) duration. These effects of TRAP were completely reversed by HMR 1098 and partially reversed by 5 HD.

The study watershed, located in western Oregon, was above a natural barrier to upstream movement. Emigration {{out of the}} watershed was estimated with a rotating fish trap. Approximately 70 % of recaptured coastal cutthroat trout with PIT tags and 86 % of those with radio tags moved predominantly at the channel-unit scale (2 – 95 m); fewer tagged fish moved at the reach scale (66 – 734 m) and segment scale (229 – 3, 479 m). In general, movement was greatest in April as spawning peaked and lowest in October, when discharge was at its lowest. Only 63 (, 1 % of tagged and marked fish) coastal cutthroat trout were captured in the fish <b>trap.</b> <b>Trap</b> efficiency was about 33 %, and the expanded estimate of emigrants between February and June was 173 fish. These results suggest that unit-scale movement is common throughout the year and that reach- and segment-scale movements are important during the winter and spring. Although movement in headwater streams is most common at the channel-unit scale, restoration of individual channel units of stream may not benefit the population at the watershed scale unless these activities are undertaken {{in the context of}} the greater whole.

40|$|Coherent {{coupling}} {{between a}} large number of qubits is the goal for scalable approaches to solid state quantum information processing. Prototype systems can be characterized by spectroscopic techniques. Here, we use pulsed-continuous wave microwave spectroscopy to study the behavior of electrons trapped at defects within the gate dielectric of a sol-gel-based high-k silicon MOSFET. Disorder leads to a wide distribution in trap properties, allowing more than 1000 traps to be individually addressed in a single transistor within the accessible frequency domain. Their dynamical behavior is explored by pulsing the microwave excitation over a range of times comparable to the phase coherence time and the lifetime of the electron in the <b>trap.</b> <b>Trap</b> occupancy is limited to a single electron, which can be manipulated by resonant microwave excitation and the resulting change in trap occupancy is detected by the change in the channel current of the transistor. The trap behavior is described by a classical damped driven simple harmonic oscillator model, with the phase coherence, lifetime and coupling strength parameters derived from a continuous wave (CW) measurement only. For pulse times shorter than the phase coherence time, the energy exchange between traps, due to the coupling, strongly modulates the observed drain current change. This effect could be exploited for 2 -qubit gate operation. The very large number of resonances observed in this system would allow a complex multi-qubit quantum mechanical circuit to be realized by this mechanism using only a single transistor.
