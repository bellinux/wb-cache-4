40|$|Background:With the {{objective}} of combining multiple resistant traits from wild relative species in florist’s chrysanthemums, <b>trigeneric</b> hybridization was conducted by crossing two intergeneric F 1 hybrids Chrysanthemum grandiflorum 6 Artemisia vulgaris and Chrysanthemum crassum 6 Crossostephium chinense. Methodology/Principal Findings: To assess post-pollination phenomena, we investigated pollen germination on the stigma and embryo development, using fluorescence and scanning electron microscopy and paraffin-embedded sections, respectively. We selected eight putative <b>trigeneric</b> hybrid lines that showed the greatest morphological differences from the parents from among the progeny derived via embryo rescue. The hybridity of one <b>trigeneric</b> hybrid was further confirmed by fluorescent genomic in situ hybridization; in addition, the aphid resistance and salt tolerance of this hybrid were {{higher than those of}} the chrysanthemum parent and the C. grandiflorum 6 A. vulgaris F 1 hybrid, respectively. Conclusions/Significance: The enhanced aphid resistance of the hybrid line reflects the inheritance of chromosomes from A. vulgaris, which carries genes that encode bioactive components. The enhanced salt tolerance of the <b>trigeneric</b> hybrid is attributable to inheritance of genetic materials from Chrysanthemum crassum and Crossostephium chinense, which act to maintain the compartmentation of Na+ and K+ ions and their selective transportation among different organs to avert deleterious effects and protect the photosynthetic apparatus.

40|$|Kiggelaria L. is {{endemic to}} Africa {{and the only}} {{representative}} of tribe Pangieae (Flacourtiaceae) on the continent. Molecular genetics, phytochemistry and host-parasite relationships have indicated a relationship between this woody, pantropical tribe of Flacourtiaceae and a small, <b>trigeneric</b> family of herbaceous, southern African endemics, the Achariaceae. In the present study, ovule and seed structure in Kiggelaria were investigated and compared with relevant data recently reported for Achariaceae. Support for an alliance with Achariaceae {{were found in the}} presence of anatropous, bitegmic. sessile ovules with zigzag micropyles. deep-lying embryo sacs covered by an epistase in the ovule and seed, endotestal-exotegmic seed coat layers, suspensorless embryos and sarcotestal seed with a prominent, plate-like hypostase. Unlike Achariaceae.   Kiggelaria seeds do not have chalazal seed lids, pronounced raphal ridges, a fringe layer, or stomata in the outer epidermis of the sarcotesta.

40|$|This {{version was}} {{published}} by NRC Canada [URL] nucleolar activity in interspecific hybrids between tritordeum, wheat, and triticale was studied using the silver salt – nylon technique. rRNA genes from the major NORs from wheat (chromosome pairs 1 B and 6 B) and Hordeum chilense (chromosome pairs 5 Hch and 6 Hch) were active in genomic constitutions AABBHchHch, AABBHch, and AABBDHch. The rye chromosome 1 R NOR suppression found in triticale and in wheat × rye F 1 hybrids is also observed in <b>trigeneric</b> hybrids, genome constitution AABBRHch, derived from crosses between triticale and tritordeum. As expected, {{the maximum number of}} NORs per metaphase cell is coincident with the maximum number of nucleoli per interphase cell. Occasional extra nucleolar activity was observed, probably owing to minor sites of wheat NORs, since no other sites of active or inactive rRNA genes were detected in H. chilense. However, it is notable that the two H. chilense loci and two major rDNA loci of wheat origin are expressed together...|$|E
40|$|The {{chromosome}} affinity {{among the}} P genome from Agropyron and the D and H(ch) genomes of Triticum and Hordeum {{in the absence}} of the Ph system controlling homoeologous chromosome pairing provides information for breeding purposes. Hybrids between two accesions of the diploid barley Hordeum chilense (H(ch) H(ch)) and the fertile amphiploid Triticum tauschii-Agropyron cristatum (DDPP) were made, giving rise to the <b>trigeneric</b> hybrid genomic combinations H(ch) DP from which such information could be obtained. The meiotic pairing of these hybrids using fluorescence genomic in situ hybridization (FISH) on metaphase I pollen mother cells yield data on allosyndetic and autosyndetic chromosome pairing between the three genomes. The results showed that the A. cristatum tetraploid parent of the amphiploid DDPP is a segmental alloploid. A higher pairing between the D and H(ch) genomes than between them and the P genome from A. cristatum is observed.

40|$|Quantitative and {{qualitative}} data are presented on wood anatomy of root, basal stem, and upper stem of Montinia caryophyllacea. Anatomy of twig wood of Kaliphora madagascariensis is compared with these results, {{as is the}} data of Ramamonjiarisoa (1980) on wood of the genus Grevea. Features common to the three genera in wood {{as well as other}} portions of the plant are reviewed; these are consistent with the interpretation that Montinia and Kaliphora are very close to each other, despite previous positions of the two genera in Saxifragaceae and Comaceae, respectively. Grevea, although more distant from Montinia than is Kaliphora, can be included in a <b>trigeneric</b> family, Montiniaceae. The ordinal position of Montinia is reviewed in terms of Rosales (Saxifragales) and Myrtales. Resemblances between Montiniaceae and rosalean families are fewer than resemblances between Montiniaceae and myrtalean families. Montiniaceae have (in part) storied wood structure, a feature not found in Rosales or Myrtales sensu stricto. However, storied structure does occur in Thymeleaceae, which have sometimes been placed in or near Myrtales. Both Montiniaceae and Thymeleaceae might be regarded as outliers ofMyrtales, closer to that order than to others. The presence of iridoid compounds in Montinia complicates the task of placement...|$|E
40|$|Fusarium {{head blight}} (FHB), leaf rust, and stem rust {{are the most}} {{destructive}} fungal diseases in current world wheat production. The diploid wheatgrass, Thinopyrum elongatum (Host) Dewey (2 n = 2 x = 14, EE) is {{an excellent source of}} disease resistance genes. Two new Triticum–Secale–Thinopyrum <b>trigeneric</b> hybrids were derived from a cross between a hexaploid triticale (X Triticosecale Wittmack, 2 n = 6 x = 42, AABBRR) and a hexaploid Triticum trititrigia (2 n = 6 x = 42, AABBEE), were produced and analyzed using genomic in situ hybridization and molecular markers. The results indicated that line RE 21 contained 14 A-chromosomes, 14 B-chromosomes, three pairs of R-chromosomes (4 R, 6 R, and 7 R), and four pairs of E-chromosomes (1 E, 2 E, 3 E, and 5 E) for a total chromosome number of 2 n = 42. Line RE 62 contained 14 A-chromosomes, 14 B-chromosomes, six pairs of R-chromosomes, and one pair of translocation chromosomes between chromosome 5 R and 5 E, for a total chromosome number of 2 n = 42. At the seedling and adult growth stages under greenhouse conditions, line RE 21 showed high levels of resistance to FHB, leaf rust, and stem rust race Ug 99, and line RE 62 was highly resistant to leaf rust and stem rust race Ug 99. These two lines (RE 21 and RE 62) display superior disease resistance characteristics and have the potential to be utilized as valuable germplasm sources for future wheat improvement...|$|E
40|$|Hexaploid {{triticale}} is {{an important}} forage crop and a promising energy plant. Some forms were previously reported for developing the hexaploid triticale, such as crossing tetraploid wheat or hexaploid wheat with rye, crossing hexaploid triticale and/or hexaploid wheat with octoploid triticale, and spontaneously appearing in the selfed progenies of octoploid triticale. In the present study, we developed an effective method for production of diverse types of hexaploid triticale via wheat-rye-Psathyrostachys huashanica <b>trigeneric</b> hybrid. Genomic in situ hybridization (GISH) and {{fluorescence in situ hybridization}} (FISH) karyotyping revealed that D genome chromosomes were completely eliminated and the whole A, B, and R genome chromosomes were retained in three lines. More interestingly, the composite genome of the line K 14 - 489 - 2 consisted of complete A and B genomes and chromosomes 1 D, 2 R, 3 R, 4 R, 5 R, 6 R, and 7 R, that of line K 14 - 491 - 2 was 12 A-genome (1 A- 6 A), 14 B-genome (1 B- 7 B), 12 R-genome (1 R- 3 R, 5 R- 7 R), and chromosomes 1 D and 3 D, and that of the line K 14 - 547 - 1 had 26 A/B and 14 R chromosomes, plus one pair of centric 6 BL/ 2 DS translocations. This finding implies that some of D genome chromosomes can be spontaneously and stably incorporated into the hexaploid triticale. Additionally, a variety of high-molecular-weight glutenin subunits (HMW-GS) compositions were detected in the six hexaploid triticale lines, respectively. Besides, compared with its recurrent triticale parent Zhongsi 828, these lines showed high level of resistance to stripe rust (Puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici, Pst) pathogens prevalent in China, including V 26 /Gui 22. These new hexaploid triticales not only enhanced diversification of triticale but also could be utilized as valuable germplasm for wheat improvement...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (MSc (Genetics)) [...] Stellenbosch University, 2008. Thinopyrum distichum (2 n = 4 x = 28; J 1 dJ 1 dJ 2 dJ 2 d) is a hardy, salt-tolerant {{maritime}} wheatgrass {{indigenous to}} southern Africa. In order to transfer its salt-tolerance to cultivated cereals, the Thinopyrum chromosomes involved {{must first be}} characterized with molecular markers. Thinopyrum distichum chromosomes 2 J 1 d, 3 J 1 d, 4 J 1 d and 5 J 1 d have previously {{been found to be}} major determinants of salt-tolerance. A genotype panel consisting of two triticale/Th. distichum allopolyploids, two Th. distichum/ 2 *triticale doubled-haploids, eight triticale addition-lines (for chromosomes 2 J 1 d; 2 J 1 dβ; 3 J 1 d; 3 J 1 dL; 4 J 1 d; 4 J 2 d; 5 J 1 d and 7 J 2 d, respectively) and two triticale translocation-lines (involving chromosome arms 3 J 1 dS and 3 J 1 dL, respectively) were used for fluorescence-based, semi-automated AFLP-analyses {{and to a lesser extent}} for EST-SSR microsatellite marker-development, to identify molecular markers specific to the critical Th. distichum chromosomes. Thirteen EST-SSR primer pairs produced four putative Th. distichum-specific microsatellite-markers, one of which was specific for critical chromosome 5 J 1 d. AFLP-analysis with 60 selective EcoRI/MseI and 18 Sse 8387 I/MseI primer combinations produced 159 AFLP-fragments specific for Th. distichum. These included seven putative markers for chromosome 2 J 1 d, 15 for 3 J 1 d, one marker for 4 J 1 d and two for 5 J 1 d. A salt-tolerance experiment was done to determine which chromosome 2 J 1 d and 3 J 1 d regions may carry genes for salt-tolerance. Plants were selected that had a monosomic addition of a chromosome 2 J 1 d variant (either the complete chromosome or a modified version referred to as 2 J 1 dβ) in addition to one of four chromosome 3 J 1 d variants (the complete 3 J 1 d chromosome; a 3 J 1 dL-telosome; a 3 J 1 dS-translocation or a 3 J 1 dL-translocation). The results suggested that Th. distichum chromosome-arms 2 J 1 dL and 3 J 1 dS are probably involved in salt-tolerance. A group of 93 <b>trigeneric</b> (Triticum/Secale/Thinopyrum) F 2 secondary hybrids were then analyzed in order to: (i) Evaluate some (ten) of the newly developed putative AFLP-markers; and (ii) attempt to find translocations, telosomes or substitutions involving the critical Thinopyrum chromosomes. Five (50 %) of the ten putative AFLP-markers could be reproduced, but only four proved to be chromosome-specific. It was also possible to assign hese four markers to chromosome arms: E 32 M 49. 118 (2 J 1 dS); E 41 M 49. 103 (2 J 1 dS); E 35 M 49. 137 (3 J 1 d); and E 41 M 49. 188 (3 J 1 dL). The selective primer combination that produced marker E 41 M 49. 103 (2 J 1 dS), also amplified a fragment of the same size on chromosome 4 J 1 d. These markers will be useful for further mapping and selection of the salt-tolerance genes. The fact that only four of the ten putative AFLP-markers evaluated proved to be repeatable implies that the remaining untested markers need to be confirmed against larger genotype panels as well. Probable reasons for the relatively low frequency of markers that turned out to be reliable are discussed. The marker-association study also revealed that visual examination of all electropherograms produced by AFLP-fragment analysis is necessary to correctly identify all AFLP-fragments. Use of the AFLP- and STS-/SCAR-markers in conjunction with the group of 93 F 2 secondary hybrids showed that 18 of these probably carried a 3 J 1 dL-translocation. Several hybrids possibly had translocations involving the 4 J 1 d and 5 J 1 d chromosomes. However, these results need to be confirmed. Various hybrids also appeared to have critical Th. distichum substitutions, although this still requires further confirmation. The identified plant material could prove useful for further characterization of salt-tolerance in Thinopyrum, and its eventual utilization in cereal crops...|$|E
