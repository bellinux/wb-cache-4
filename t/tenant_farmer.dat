5|$|Pleydell {{was born}} by 1519. The sixth of nine children, {{he was the}} fourth son of wealthy <b>tenant</b> <b>farmer</b> William Pleydell of Coleshill, Berkshire—now Oxfordshire—and Agnes Reason (daughter of Robert Reason of Corfe Castle, Dorset). His younger brother was John Pleydell, Member for Cricklade in 1593. The Pleydell family were thought to descend from Thomas de Coleshill, a knight who was awarded lordship of the eponymous parish on 2 March 1275 by King Edward I. Gabriel came of age by 1540, holding land once owned by Sir Anthony Hungerford at Eisey (near the parish of Cricklade).|$|E
5|$|In {{the land}} {{adjacent}} to Carthy's Castle is Orlagh House {{which has been}} owned by the Augustinian Order since the mid-nineteenth century and is a retreat and conference centre run by the friars. It was built in 1790 by Mr Lundy Foot, a wealthy snuff merchant, who named the house Footmount. He was also a magistrate and was instrumental in condemning {{three members of the}} Kearney family to death for the murder of John Kinlan, the gamekeeper at Friarstown, near Bohernabreena, in 1816. Foot was subsequently murdered in 1835, an act that was attributed to relatives of the Kearneys. In fact, Foot was killed by James Murphy, the son of an evicted <b>tenant</b> <b>farmer</b> whose land Foot had bought following the eviction.|$|E

50|$|<b>Tenant</b> <b>farmers</b> in Muskogee were {{displaced}} {{in great}} numbers during the Great Depression. The collapse of cotton prices led to the 1933 Agricultural Adjustment Act, which led landowners to evict <b>tenant</b> <b>farmers</b> as they took land out of production to receive farm subsidies. That same year, thousands of displaced <b>tenant</b> <b>farmers</b> helped kick off the Okie migration to California.|$|R
5|$|When the Empire of Brazil began aiding Uruguay in its {{struggle}} against Argentina, Rosas declared war in August 1851, starting the Platine War. This short conflict ended with Rosas being defeated and absconding to Britain. His last years were spent in exile {{living as a}} <b>tenant</b> <b>farmer</b> {{until his death in}} 1877. Rosas garnered an enduring public perception among Argentines as a brutal tyrant. Since the 1930s, an authoritarian, anti-Semitic, and racist political movement in Argentina called Revisionism has tried to improve Rosas's reputation and establish a new dictatorship in the model of his regime. In 1989, his remains were repatriated by the government in an attempt to promote national unity, seeking forgiveness for him and especially for the 1970s military dictatorship. Rosas remains a controversial figure in Argentina in the 21st century.|$|E
5|$|The manor of St Catherine {{belonged to}} Prior Cantlow of Bath Abbey in medieval times. It takes {{its name from}} the Church of St Catherine beside the manor house. When the house was not {{occupied}} by the monks it was leased. In 1536 the lease was to Thomas Llewellyn who remained as the tenant after the Dissolution of the Monasteries. Henry VIII granted the manor to his tailor, John Malte, in 1546. Part of the condition of the gift was that he adopt the kings illegitimate daughter Ethelreda Malte. Ethelreda inherited the house and married John Harington. After Ethelreda's death in 1551 Harrington married again. His son from this marriage was another John Harington who grew up and became a courtier of Elizabeth I and invented the first flush toilet. He {{spent most of his time}} at his principle seat at nearby Kelston and, in 1591, sold St Catherine's Court to John Blanchard. His son William Blanchard, remodelled the house. His initials appear in the plasterwork frieze of a bedroom. The Blanchard family lived at the court for several generations. In 1610 the porch was added and a terraced garden laid out. The house passed by marriage to the Parry family but was not maintained and the fabric of the building was declining by the 18th century, when half of the building was used by a <b>tenant</b> <b>farmer.</b>|$|E

Their interests rested mainly in not allowing federal welfare to undermine their authority and the economic structure that favored landowners. <b>Tenant</b> <b>farmers,</b> however, exerted significant counterpressure by organizing the Southern <b>Tenant</b> <b>Farmers</b> Union and the Alabama Sharecroppers' Union {{under the auspices of}} the Socialist Party and the Communist Party. The unions agitated for welfare assistance, and their events and campaigns drew national publicity. While <b>tenant</b> <b>farmers</b> remained terribly disadvantaged politically, their collective efforts improved matters substantially in areas where their organizations were strongest.|$|R
2500|$|For {{many months}} the {{agriculture}} sector {{had been in}} recession due to bad harvests and cheap imports. The law as it stood was {{considered by many to}} unfairly favour landowners over struggling <b>tenant</b> <b>farmers,</b> leading to landowners evicting [...] "unprofitable" [...] <b>tenant</b> <b>farmers</b> and turning the land over to grazing. The traditionally somewhat conservative <b>tenant</b> <b>farmers</b> were becoming desperate for relief and willing to listen to aggressive nationalists who linked economic with political oppression in their messages and raised the question of who morally owned the land.|$|R

50|$|Historically, {{rural society}} {{utilised}} a three tier structure of landowners (nobility, gentry, yeomanry), <b>tenant</b> <b>farmers,</b> and farmworkers. Originally, <b>tenant</b> <b>farmers</b> {{were known as}} peasants. Under Anglo-Norman law almost all tenants were bonded to the land, and were therefore also villeins, but after the labour shortage occasioned by the Black Death in the mid 14th century, the number of free tenants substantially increased. Many <b>tenant</b> <b>farmers</b> became affluent and socially well connected, and employed {{a substantial number of}} labourers and managed more than one farm. Tenancy could be either in perpetuity or rotated by the owners. Cottiers (cottagers) held much less land.|$|R
25|$|Classical economics, {{developed}} in the 18th and 19th centuries, included a value theory and distribution theory. The value of a product was thought {{to depend on the}} costs involved in producing that product. The explanation of costs in Classical economics was simultaneously an explanation of distribution. A landlord received rent, workers received wages, and a capitalist <b>tenant</b> <b>farmer</b> received profits on their investment. This classic approach included the work of Adam Smith and David Ricardo.|$|E
25|$|A lynching in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, {{changed the}} {{political}} climate in Washington. On July 19, 1935, Rubin Stacy, a homeless African-American <b>tenant</b> <b>farmer,</b> knocked on doors begging for food. After resident complaints, deputies took Stacy into custody. While he was in custody, a lynch mob took Stacy from the deputies and murdered him. Although the faces of his murderers {{could be seen in}} a photo taken at the lynching site, the state did not prosecute the murder.|$|E
25|$|The system {{started with}} Blacks when large {{plantations}} were subdivided. By the 1880s, white farmers also became sharecroppers. The system was distinct {{from that of}} the <b>tenant</b> <b>farmer,</b> who rented the land, provided his own tools and mule, and received half the crop. Landowners provided more supervision to sharecroppers, and less or none to tenant farmers. Sharecropping in the United States probably originated in the Natchez District, roughly centered in Adams County, Mississippi with its county seat, Natchez.|$|E

Barnes, who was born to a slave and married a <b>tenant</b> <b>farmer,</b> had fifteen children; 11 of whom preceded her in death. Inconsistent records {{suggested}} that she was born on 6 March 1882 at the latest, but possibly a year earlier.

25|$|Adams {{was born}} at Lidcot, a farm at Laneast, near Launceston, Cornwall, the eldest of seven children. His parents were Thomas Adams (1788–1859), a poor <b>tenant</b> <b>farmer,</b> and his wife, Tabitha Knill Grylls (1796–1866). The family were devout Wesleyans who enjoyed music and among John's brothers, Thomas became a missionary, George a farmer, and William Grylls Adams, {{professor}} of natural philosophy and astronomy at King's College London. Tabitha was a farmer's daughter but had received a rudimentary education from John Couch, her uncle, whose small library she had inherited. John was intrigued by the astronomy books from an early age.|$|E

The next year was tragic for Obregón as his wife and two of his children died, leaving him a widower with two small children, who were henceforth raised by his three older sisters. In 1909, Obregón invented a chickpea harvester and soon founded a company to manufacture these harvesters, complete with a modern assembly line. He successfully marketed these harvesters to chickpea farmers throughout the Mayo Valley.|$|E
25|$|The {{estate of}} Pockerley Old Hall is {{presented}} {{as that of a}} well off <b>tenant</b> <b>farmer,</b> in a position {{to take advantage of the}} agricultural advances of the era. The hall itself consists of the Old House, which is adjoined (but not connected to) the New House, both south facing two storey sandstone built buildings, the Old House also having a small north-south aligned extension. Roof timbers in the sandstone built Old House have been dated to the 1440s, but the lower storey (the undercroft) may be from even earlier. The New House dates to the late 1700s, and replaced a medieval manor house to the east of the Old House as the main farm house - once replaced itself, the Old House is believed to have been let to the farm manager. Visitors can access all rooms in the New and Old House, except the north-south extension which is now a toilet block. Displays include traditional cooking, such as the drying of oatcakes over a wooden rack (flake) over the fireplace in the Old House.|$|E
