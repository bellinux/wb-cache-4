The film's release was marked by many rumours that the group were about to split, which were quickly denied by the six. However, ten days after the release of their movie, the rumours were confirmed when it was announced live on stage—during their S Club United tour on 21 April 2003 – that, after a final single and greatest hits album, S Club would part ways. The band cited a mutual split, expressing it was simply a time [...] "to move on and face new challenges". Many fans felt [...] "betrayed" [...] and [...] "disappointed" [...] by the breakup, as well as [...] "angry" [...] due to the group denying rumours only two weeks before at the Seeing Double premiere.

[...] After a long, bloody and exhaustive withdrawal over two miles of woodland, the Canadians and natives slipped away, leaving Frenchtown to the Kentuckians. This skirmish would later be called as the First Battle of the River Raisin.|$|E
