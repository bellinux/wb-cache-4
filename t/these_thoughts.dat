5|$|<b>These</b> <b>thoughts</b> are {{employed}} on various important situations and {{incidents in the}} ordinary life of females, and are, in general, dictated with great judgment. Mrs. Wollstonecraft appears to have reflected maturely on her subject;… while her manner gives authority, her good sense adds irresistible weight to almost all her precepts and remarks. We should therefore recommend <b>these</b> <b>Thoughts</b> as worthy the attention {{of those who are}} more immediately concerned in the education of young ladies.|$|E
5|$|Coleridge {{began writing}} The Eolian Harp on 20 August 1795 during his {{engagement}} to Sara Fricker. Like his previous poem Lines Written at Shurton Bars, the poem discusses both his engagement and his future marriage. Coleridge {{was inspired to}} write the poem after {{a visit to a}} house in Clevedon that would serve as his and Fricker's home after their marriage. As Coleridge worked on the poem, he and Fricker were married and they moved to the Clevedon home. During this time, Coleridge held an idealised view of his life with Fricker, and <b>these</b> <b>thoughts</b> work their way into the poem. The poem was published in the 1796 edition of Coleridge's poems and in all subsequent collections. Of his poems for the 1796 collection, Coleridge felt that The Eolian Harp was his favourite.|$|E
5|$|Retrospective {{coverage}} of Burnout 3: Takedown has been overwhelmingly favourable, with many publications considering {{it to be}} among the best games released for the PlayStation 2 and Xbox consoles, as well {{as one of the greatest}} racing games ever made. Edge magazine called the game a pivotal moment for the series and reflected positively on the fundamental changes that had Criterion made in designing it. They praised the game for being balanced all round while noting that later instalments like Revenge and Dominator had pushed the series too far in a particular direction, consequently diluting a lot of what Burnout 3 had accomplished. IGN reaffirmed <b>these</b> <b>thoughts</b> in 2015, by declaring the game as the most perfect arcade racer ever conceived and the peak of the series. In 2015, USgamer listed Burnout 3: Takedown as the twelfth best game since 2000, stating that it remained at the forefront of the arcade racing genre.|$|E

5|$|To create Lou Bloom's character, Gilroy {{explored}} {{the ideas of}} unemployment and capitalism. He wanted to portray Lou as someone who perpetually focuses on the precepts of capitalism, and how <b>these</b> <b>thoughts</b> not only give him sanity, but also push him over the edge. Gilroy did not give Lou a character arc, as he believed that people develop their ideals {{at a certain point}} in their life, and that they stay that way regardless of what happens. This is depicted in the opening scene of the film, when Lou attacks a security guard, which informs the audience that Lou is a criminal, and not someone who lost their morality {{as a result of the}} job. Lou's backstory was purposefully left out of the script, as Gilroy felt that without one, the audience would create their own backstories for Lou, and become more engaged with the character. Gilroy remarked that Lou eventually became a vehicle for the ideas and themes that he wanted to express in the film.|$|E
5|$|Patton left France for New York City on March 2, 1919. After {{the war he}} was {{assigned}} to Camp Meade, Maryland, and reverted to his permanent rank of captain on June 30, 1920, though he was promoted to major again the next day. Patton was given temporary duty in Washington D.C. that year to serve on a committee writing a manual on tank operations. During this time he developed a belief that tanks should be used not as infantry support, but rather as an independent fighting force. Patton supported the M1919 tank design created by J. Walter Christie, a project which was shelved due to financial considerations. While on duty in Washington, D.C., in 1919, Patton met Dwight D. Eisenhower, who would play an enormous role in Patton's future career. During and following Patton's assignment in Hawaii, he and Eisenhower corresponded frequently. Patton sent Eisenhower notes and assistance to help him graduate from the General Staff College. With Christie, Eisenhower, {{and a handful of other}} officers, Patton pushed for more development of armored warfare in the interwar era. <b>These</b> <b>thoughts</b> resonated with Secretary of War Dwight Davis, but the limited military budget and prevalence of already-established Infantry and Cavalry branches meant the U.S. would not develop its armored corps much until 1940.|$|E

40|$|The {{purposes}} of this study are (1) to subdivide the categories of thought involved in the execution of fine motor skills，(2) to capture the range of individual patterns，and (3) to examine their charteristics from the perspectives of various influences and functions. The participants were required to think aloud while undertaking a dart-throwing task. The results reveal seven categories of thought. Subsequent cluster analysis of the occurrence ratios of <b>these</b> <b>thought</b> categories identified five patterns: stable type，task-concentration type，unstable type，concentration-difficulties type，and self-control type.

25|$|Collateral {{information}} or parallel information is information obtained from family, friends or treatment providers of the patient.

25|$|The stream-of-consciousness style {{being so}} {{prominent}} in this work, {{a summary of}} the plot based on physical action does not give a thorough understanding of the content of the work.

Some discretion must be made in a plot summary as to which of <b>these</b> <b>thoughts</b> and memories warrant detailing.|$|E
40|$|Thought {{experiments}} led Einstein to {{discovering that}} gravity and acceleration were identical, {{which lead to}} his famous theory of relativity. Thought experiments {{can also be used}} in critical thinking and understanding about the relationship between physics and computation.

Thought provoking questions will be developed from <b>these</b> <b>thought</b> experiments, as well as other questions people asked during this period. <b>These</b> <b>thought</b> experiments and questions will be discussed in light of actual research supporting those issues, and the result will be the view that information laws are topological constraints that precede physical laws and therefore are protophysical. 1. 0 Introduction to information and spacetime: When Dr. Landauer argued that information was physical [1] he turned the concept of informatio [...] ...|$|R

25|$|Philo {{probably}} {{was the first}} philosopher who identified Plato’s Ideas with Creator’s thoughts. <b>These</b> <b>thoughts</b> make the contents of Logos; they were the seals for making sensual things during world creation. Logos resembles a book with creature paradigms. Architect’s design before {{the construction of a}} city serves to Philo as another simile of Logos. Since creation, Logos binds things together.

25|$|This chapter {{begins with}} a {{detailed}} description of the exquisitely decorated drawing room where the Salina family recites their daily rosary. Afterwards, the Prince wanders out into the garden, where the sickly, over-ripe smells of lush foliage threaten to overwhelm him with memories—specifically, of a dead Neapolitan soldier who, in his last moments, had clawed his way into the lemon grove and died there, guts spilled.

25|$|This {{process has}} been studied {{extensively}} in social psychology as implicit associations and implicit attitudes, a component of implicit cognition. Implicit attitudes are evaluations that occur without conscious awareness towards an attitude object or the self. These evaluations are generally either favorable or unfavorable. They come about from various influences in the individual experience. Implicit attitudes are not consciously identified (or they are inaccurately identified) traces of past experience that mediate favorable or unfavorable feeling, thought, or action towards social objects. <b>These</b> <b>thoughts,</b> feelings or actions have an influence on behavior of which the individual may not be aware.|$|E

He went on to say, that as a socio-political force, ABRI had to choose the right political partners that had proved their desire to maintain Pancasila and the 1945 Constitution, because there were socio-political forces who had their doubts about them.

25|$|Along with asking moral questions, Slaughterhouse-Five {{is also a}} {{novel that}} focuses on the philosophies of fate and free will.

When abducted by the Tralfamdorians, Pilgrim asks them why he is chosen among all the others. He questions the fate of the situation and what led up to that point. Billy Pilgrim considers his fate and actions {{to be a part of}} a larger network of actions, his future manipulated by one thing over another based on decision. All things that happen would happen for a reason. Indeed, Pilgrim’s beginning mindset would suggest that he believed in free will, fate, whys, decisions and things happening for reasons.

Seeing that Joseph Stalin {{did not intend to}} change his policies, Paasikivi supported compliance with some of the demands. When the war broke out, Paasikivi was asked to enter Risto Ryti’s cabinet as a minister without portfolio—in practice in the role of a distinguished political advisor. He ended up in the cabinet's leading triumvirate together with Risto Ryti and Foreign Minister Väinö Tanner (chairman of the Social Democrats). Paasikivi also led the negotiations for an armistice and peace, and continued his mission in Moscow as Envoy. In Moscow he was necessarily isolated from the most secret thoughts in Helsinki; and when he found out that <b>these</b> <b>thoughts</b> ran in the direction of revanche, of retaking, with Germany's aid, territory lost in the Winter War, he resigned.

25|$|When {{he reached}} puberty, Dahmer {{discovered}} that he was homosexual. He did not divulge his sexual orientation to his parents, although in his early teens, he did engage in a brief relationship with another youth, although the pair never had intercourse. By his later admission, {{as he began to}} fantasize sexually, issues of dominance and control over a completely subservient partner were prevalent in his thoughts. <b>These</b> <b>thoughts</b> gradually became intertwined with dissection. On one occasion, when he was approximately 16 years old, Dahmer conceived a rape fantasy of rendering a particular male jogger he found attractive unconscious and then making sexual use of his unconscious body. To render the man unconscious, Dahmer concealed himself in bushes on the route he had noted the jogger took, baseball bat in hand, and lay in wait for the jogger. On this particular day, the jogger did not pass him and, although Dahmer never attempted to implement this plan again, he later stated this was his first attempt to attack another individual.|$|E
