5|$|After a gap {{of several}} decades, {{in the early}} 1980s, Vimala Begley studied the {{ceramics}} find of the site and proposed a preliminary version of the chronology of the occupation of the site. At {{the same time she}} started researching on <b>the</b> <b>beads,</b> organized a proper sequential display of the artifacts of the site at the Pondicherry Museum, and brought out an information brochure.|$|E
5|$|The {{extensive}} {{findings of}} glass and stone beads at the site provided Begley the link to Arikamedu's history. She identified <b>the</b> <b>beads</b> as Indo-Pacific beads crafted at Arikamedu. Based on the antiquities and structural features from the excavations, Begley and Raman established a revised sequence of six major periods of occupation of the site. Finds of new variety of Roman Amphorae ware also facilitated revision of the dates of occupancy. They have also inferred that the site has been in continuous occupation since at least 2nd or 3rd century BCE to much more recent times.|$|E
50|$|Putting <b>the</b> <b>bead</b> between <b>the</b> two {{stitches}} {{is done by}} positioning <b>the</b> <b>bead</b> on <b>the</b> yarn connecting two stitches, i.e., {{between two}} bights. This results in <b>the</b> <b>bead</b> being visible {{from both sides of}} <b>the</b> work when <b>beads</b> are slipped on both sides. <b>The</b> <b>bead</b> has a tendency to not lie straight when placed with this method. The axis of <b>the</b> <b>bead</b> is horizontal with respect to the work. This is the method shown in the picture.|$|R
5000|$|As {{you look}} at <b>the</b> near ﬁxation <b>bead</b> you should see two strings, each of which appears to come from your eyes. if your ﬁxation of <b>the</b> <b>bead</b> is accurate, <b>the</b> two strings should appear to meet exactly at <b>the</b> <b>bead</b> forming an [...] "X"( [...] See illustration). As <b>the</b> <b>bead</b> is moved into one inch from your nose, the two strings should appear to meet exactly at <b>the</b> <b>bead</b> forming a [...] "V".|$|R
50|$|Allow <b>the</b> <b>bead</b> to {{cool and}} <b>the</b> <b>bead</b> is moisturised (traditionally with the tongue) and dipped into the sample {{to be tested}} such that only a tiny amount of the {{substance}} adheres to <b>the</b> <b>bead.</b> If too much substance is used, <b>the</b> <b>bead</b> will become dark and opaque. <b>The</b> <b>bead</b> and adhering substance is then heated in the lower, reducing, part of the flame, allowed to cool, and the colour observed. It is then heated in the upper, oxidizing, part of the flame, allowed to cool, and the colour observed again.|$|R
5|$|The {{grass fields}} {{at the back}} of the White House at Gilwell Park are known as the Training Ground and The Orchard, and are where Wood Badge {{training}} was held from the early years onward. A large oak, known as the Gilwell Oak, separates the two fields. The Gilwell Oak symbol is associated with Wood Badge, although <b>the</b> <b>beads</b> for the Wood Badge have never been made of this oak.|$|E
5|$|Beads {{made from}} {{meteoric}} iron in 3500BC or earlier {{were found in}} Gerzah, Egypt by G. A. Wainwright. <b>The</b> <b>beads</b> contain 7.5% nickel, which is a signature of meteoric origin since iron found in the Earth's crust generally has only minuscule nickel impurities. Meteoric iron was highly regarded due to its origin in the heavens and was often used to forge weapons and tools. For example, a dagger made of meteoric iron {{was found in the}} tomb of Tutankhamun, containing similar proportions of iron, cobalt, and nickel to a meteorite discovered in the area, deposited by an ancient meteor shower. Items that were likely made of iron by Egyptians date from 3000 to 2500BC. Meteoritic iron is comparably soft and ductile and easily forged by cold working but may get brittle when heated because of the nickel content.|$|E
5|$|Gedi's {{participation}} in maritime trade {{can be seen}} in the increasing frequency of imports found at Gedi over the course of the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries. Conditions along the Atlantic coast prevented European nations from opening sea lanes until the early-sixteenth century, limiting maritime trade to states with easy access to the Red Sea and the Indian Ocean. Many artifacts found at Gedi including much of the ceramics, all <b>the</b> <b>beads,</b> and the two Chinese coins resulted from either direct or indirect trade with the Near East, Arabia, China, India, and Indochina. Swahili coastal settlements exported gold, ivory, slaves, ebony, mangrove poles, copper, copal gum, frankincense, myrrh, and crystal rock.|$|E
40|$|The {{directional}} {{movement on}} a microtubule {{of a plastic}} bead connected elastically to a single one-headed kinesin motor is studied theoretically. The kinesin motor can bind and unbind to periodic binding sites on the microtubule and undergo conformational changes while catalyzing the hydrolysis of ATP. An analytic formalism relating the dynamics of <b>the</b> <b>bead</b> and <b>the</b> ATP hydrolysis cycle of the motor is derived so that the calculation of the average velocity of <b>the</b> <b>bead</b> can be easily carried out. The formalism was applied to a simple three-state biochemical model to investigate how the velocity of <b>the</b> <b>bead</b> movement {{is affected by the}} external load, the diffusion coefficient of <b>the</b> <b>bead,</b> and <b>the</b> stiffness of the elastic element connecting <b>the</b> <b>bead</b> and <b>the</b> motor. <b>The</b> <b>bead</b> velocity was found to be critically dependent on the diffusion coefficient of <b>the</b> <b>bead</b> and <b>the</b> stiffness of the elastic element. A linear force-velocity relation was found for the model no matter whether <b>the</b> <b>bead</b> velocity was modulated by the diffusion coefficient of <b>the</b> <b>bead</b> or by <b>the</b> externally applied load. The formalism should be useful in modeling the mechanisms of chemimechanical coupling in kinesin motors based on in vitro motility data...|$|R
5000|$|<b>The</b> <b>bead</b> {{loosening}} system releases <b>the</b> tire <b>bead</b> from <b>the</b> rim of <b>the</b> wheel. <b>The</b> <b>bead</b> loosening system {{consists of}} an arm near the bottom {{right side of the}} tire changer.

5|$|On {{completion}} of the course, participants are awarded the Wood Badge beads to recognize significant achievement in leadership and direct service to young people. The pair of small wooden beads, one on each end of a leather thong (string), is worn around the neck {{as part of the}} Scout uniform. <b>The</b> <b>beads</b> are presented together with a taupe neckerchief bearing a tartan patch of the Maclaren clan, honoring William de Bois Maclaren, who donated the £7000 to purchase Gilwell Park in 1919 plus an additional £3000 for improvements to the house that was on the estate. The neckerchief with the braided leather woggle (neckerchief slide) denotes the membership of the 1st Gilwell Scout Group or Gilwell Troop 1. Recipients of the Wood Badge are known as Wood Badgers or Gilwellians.|$|E
5|$|Kodumanal {{was popular}} for the {{gem-cutting}} industry and manufacture of jewels. Sites bearing natural reserves of semi-precious stones such as beryls, sapphire and quartz {{are located in}} the vicinity of Kodumanal. Beads of sapphire, beryl, agate, carnelian, amethyst, lapis lazulli, jasper, garnet, soapstone and quartz were unearthed from here. The samples were in different manufacturing stages – finished, semi-finished, drilled and undrilled, polished and unpolished and in the form of raw material. Chips and stone slabs, one with a few grooved beads, clearly demonstrate that these were manufactured locally at Kodumanal. Excavations at Korkai have yielded a large number of pearl oyesters at different levels, indicating the practice of the trade in this region. Some of the objects excavated from Kodumanal show a lot of artistic features such as paintings on the pottery, engravings on <b>the</b> <b>beads,</b> hexagonal designs on beads, inlay work in a tiger figurine and engraved shell bangles. More than ten designs are noticed in the paintings and bead etchings.|$|E
25|$|<b>The</b> <b>beads</b> are {{approximately}} five millimeters {{in diameter and}} come {{in a wide range}} of colours. Bindeez are available in various different kits with accessories such as a drying fan, applicator pen, design templates for <b>the</b> <b>beads,</b> and water spray bottles. The product is labelled for ages four and above.|$|E
5000|$|The {{only other}} {{contemporary}} attestation of Imyremeshaw {{is a white}} steatite <b>bead</b> bearing <b>the</b> inscription [...] "The good god, Smenkhkare, beloved of Sobek, Lord of Shedyt". <b>The</b> <b>bead</b> {{is now in the}} British Museum, numbered BM EA74185. Although the provenance of <b>the</b> <b>bead</b> is unknown, egyptologists Darrell Baker and Kim Ryholt propose that the reference to Shedyt, a town close to Memphis, on <b>the</b> <b>bead</b> could indicate that <b>the</b> <b>bead</b> originates from this location.|$|R
50|$|One {{end of a}} polymer is {{attached}} to a small bead (tens to hundreds of nanometer), while the other end {{is attached}} to a surface.Both the polymer and <b>the</b> <b>bead</b> stay in an aqueous environment, so <b>the</b> <b>bead</b> moves in Brownian motion. Because of the tether, the motion is restricted. Using an optical microscope and CCD camera, one can track <b>the</b> <b>bead</b> position in a time series. Although <b>the</b> <b>bead</b> is usually smaller than the diffraction limit, so the image is a spot which is larger than <b>the</b> <b>bead</b> itself (point spread function), the center of the spot represents the projection on the X-Y plane {{of the end of the}} polymer (end-to-end vector). Analyzing the distribution of <b>the</b> <b>bead</b> position can tell us a lot of information about the polymer.|$|R
50|$|Nowadays, <b>the</b> <b>bead</b> size {{commonly}} in use for Peranakan beadwork are sizes 15 to 18 (the {{larger the}} size number, <b>the</b> smaller <b>the</b> <b>bead).</b>|$|R
25|$|RNP, Scl-70, Jo-1, dsDNA, {{centromere}} B and histone. Serum is incubated with <b>the</b> <b>beads</b> and in {{the presence}} of anti-dsDNA antibodies, or any other ANA, the antibodies will bind and fluorescent labelled secondary antibodies will be used for detection. <b>The</b> <b>beads</b> are run through a flow cell which uses a laser to detect fluorescence.|$|E
25|$|The Chibuene {{series is}} {{distinct}} from other glass beads {{in the area in}} morphology and chemistry. <b>The</b> <b>beads</b> are tubular in shape with ends that have been rounded through reheating and suggested to be older than Zhizo beads at the site. These only match beads located at Nqoma in western Botswana, contemporaneously. The glass used to manufacture <b>the</b> <b>beads</b> appear to have a Near East origin.|$|E
25|$|An adapted abacus, {{invented by}} Tim Cranmer, called a Cranmer abacus is still {{commonly}} used {{by individuals who}} are blind. A piece of soft fabric or rubber is placed behind <b>the</b> <b>beads</b> {{so that they do}} not move inadvertently. This keeps <b>the</b> <b>beads</b> in place while the users feel or manipulate them. They use an abacus to perform the mathematical functions multiplication, division, addition, subtraction, square root and cube root.|$|E
50|$|For example, if a bead is {{constrained}} {{to move on}} a hoop, {{its position}} may be represented by the position coordinate θ, which gives the angle at which <b>the</b> <b>bead</b> is situated. Say that <b>the</b> <b>bead</b> is at <b>the</b> top. Moving <b>the</b> <b>bead</b> straight upwards from its height z to a height z + dz would represent one possible infinitesimal displacement, but would violate the constraint. The only possible virtual displacement would be a displacement from <b>the</b> <b>bead's</b> position, θ to a new position θ + δθ (where δθ could be positive or negative).|$|R
50|$|Air pressure, via the ply cords, exerts {{tensile force}} on <b>the</b> entire <b>bead</b> {{surrounding}} <b>the</b> wheel rim {{on which the}} tire is mounted, pulling outward in a 360 degree pattern. Thus <b>the</b> <b>bead</b> must have high tensile strength. With no force applied to the outer tread, <b>the</b> <b>bead</b> is pulled equally in all directions, thus no additional net {{force is applied to}} <b>the</b> tire <b>bead</b> and wheel rim. However, when the tread is pushed inward on one side, this releases some tension in the corresponding sidewall ply pulling on <b>the</b> <b>bead.</b> Yet <b>the</b> sidewall ply on the other side continues to pull <b>the</b> <b>bead</b> in <b>the</b> opposite direction. Thus the still fully tensioned sidewall ply pulls <b>the</b> tire <b>bead</b> and wheel rim {{in the same direction as}} the tread displacement with equal force as that applied to push the tread inward.|$|R
5000|$|Electromagnets {{are placed}} above the sample slide, and an {{inverted}} microscope is placed below. The image is captured via a CCD camera {{and transferred to}} a computer, where the three-dimensional positions of <b>the</b> magnetic <b>beads</b> are determined. <b>The</b> position of <b>the</b> <b>bead</b> within <b>the</b> horizontal plane of the glass slide, x and y, are determined by real-time correlation of <b>the</b> <b>bead</b> images. [...] <b>The</b> vertical length of the hairpin, measured by the vertical position of <b>the</b> attached magnetic <b>bead,</b> is measured by <b>the</b> <b>bead’s</b> diffraction ring diameter, which increases with distance.|$|R
25|$|The Russian abacus, the schoty (счёты), {{usually has}} a single slanted deck, with ten beads on each wire (except one wire, usually {{positioned}} near the user, with four beads for quarter-ruble fractions). Older models have another 4-bead wire for quarter-kopeks, which were minted until 1916. The Russian abacus is often used vertically, with wires {{from left to right}} {{in the manner of a}} book. The wires are usually bowed to bulge upward in the center, to keep <b>the</b> <b>beads</b> pinned to either of the two sides. It is cleared when all <b>the</b> <b>beads</b> are moved to the right. During manipulation, beads are moved to the left. For easy viewing, the middle 2 beads on each wire (the 5th and 6th bead) usually are of a different color from the other eight beads. Likewise, the left bead of the thousands wire (and the million wire, if present) may have a different color.|$|E
25|$|During {{the middle}} ages, {{evidence}} suggests that both the Our Father and the Hail Mary were recited with prayer beads. In 13th century Paris, four trade guilds existed of prayer bead makers, who were referred to as paternosterers, and <b>the</b> <b>beads</b> were referred to as paternosters, suggesting a continued link between the Our Father (Pater noster in Latin) and the prayer beads.|$|E
25|$|A popular children's toy, Bindeez (also {{known as}} Aqua Dots, in the United States), {{produced}} by Melbourne company Moose, was banned in Australia in early November 2007 {{when it was}} discovered that 1,4-butanediol (1,4-B), which is metabolized into GHB, had been substituted for the non-toxic plasticiser 1,5-pentanediol in the bead manufacturing process. Three young children were hospitalized as a result of ingesting a large number of <b>the</b> <b>beads,</b> and the toy was recalled.|$|E

5000|$|Shift ﬁxation to <b>the</b> middle ﬁxation <b>bead</b> {{and then}} to <b>the</b> far ﬁxation <b>bead</b> and repeat. if your ﬁxation of <b>the</b> far <b>bead</b> is accurate, <b>the</b> two strings should appear to meet exactly at <b>the</b> <b>bead</b> forming a [...] "V".|$|R
25|$|For a bead sliding on a {{frictionless}} wire subject only {{to gravity}} in 2d space, the constraint on <b>the</b> <b>bead</b> can be {{stated in the}} form f(r) = 0, where the position of <b>the</b> <b>bead</b> can be written r = (x(s), y(s)), in which s is a parameter, the arc length s along the curve from some point on the wire. This is a suitable choice of generalized coordinate for the system. Only one coordinate is needed instead of two, because the position of <b>the</b> <b>bead</b> can be parameterized by one number, s, and the constraint equation connects the two coordinates x and y; either one is determined from the other. The constraint force is the reaction force the wire exerts on <b>the</b> <b>bead</b> to keep it on the wire, and the non-constraint applied force is gravity acting on <b>the</b> <b>bead.</b>|$|R
25|$|In archaeological surveys {{performed}} between 1995 and 2001 {{from the}} lower levels of occupation (600-1000 AD), 2800 beads were collected from the site with the vast majority being of the Zhizo tradition and the discovery of a new typology, named the Chibuene series. The Zhizo beads were made of plant-ash glass which suggests a Near Eastern origin, as only sites west of the Euphrates utilized plant-ash glass at this time, but <b>the</b> <b>beads</b> were manufactured with South Asian technology, making the place of manufacture difficult to ascertain.|$|E
25|$|In 1876 Baden-Powell {{joined the}} 13th Hussars in India with {{the rank of}} lieutenant. He {{enhanced}} and honed his military scouting skills amidst the Zulu in the early 1880s in the Natal province of South Africa, where his regiment had been posted, and where he was Mentioned in Despatches. During one of his travels, he came across a large string of wooden beads. Although Baden-Powell claimed <b>the</b> <b>beads</b> had been those of the Zulu king Dinizulu, one researcher learned from Baden-Powell's diary only {{that he had taken}} beads from a dead woman's body around that time, and indeed the bead form is more similar to dowry beads than to warrior beads. <b>The</b> <b>beads</b> were later incorporated into the Wood Badge training programme he started after he founded the Scouting Movement. Baden-Powell's skills impressed his superiors and he was brevetted Major as Military Secretary and senior Aide-de-camp of the Commander-in-Chief and Governor of Malta, his uncle General Sir Henry Augustus Smyth. He was posted in Malta for three years, also working as intelligence officer for the Mediterranean for the Director of Military Intelligence. He frequently travelled disguised as a butterfly collector, incorporating plans of military installations into his drawings of butterfly wings. In 1884 he published Reconnaissance and Scouting.|$|E
25|$|A {{misrepresentation}} is a {{false statement}} of fact or law that is relied on by the other party in entering a contract. For example, in Curtis v Chemical Cleaning and Dyeing Co Ms Curtis took a wedding dress with beads and sequins to the cleaners. They gave her a contract to sign and she asked the assistant what it was. The assistant said it was to stop risk to <b>the</b> <b>beads.</b> In fact the contract exempted all liability. The dress was stained. But the exclusion was ineffective because of the assistant's misrepresentation.|$|E
40|$|The {{motion of}} a {{cylindrical}} bead in a fluid contained within a two-dimensional channel is investigated using the boundary element method {{as a model}} of a biomolecular-motor-powered microfluidics pump. The novelty of the pump lies in the use of motor proteins (kinesin) to power <b>the</b> <b>bead</b> motion and <b>the</b> few moving parts comprising the pump. The performance and feasibility of this pump design is investigated using two model geometries: a straight channel, and a curved channel with two concentric circular walls. In the straight channel geometry, it is shown that increasing <b>the</b> <b>bead</b> radius relative to the channel width, increases the flow rate at the expense of increasing the force the kinesins must generate in order to move <b>the</b> <b>bead.</b> Pump efficiency is generally higher for larger bead radii, and larger beads can support higher imposed loads. In the circular channel geometry, it is shown that <b>bead</b> rotation modifies <b>the</b> force required to move <b>the</b> <b>bead</b> and that shifting <b>the</b> <b>bead</b> inward slightly reduces <b>the</b> required force. <b>Bead</b> rotation has a minimal effect on flow rate. Recirculation regions, which can develop between <b>the</b> <b>bead</b> and <b>the</b> channel walls, influence the stresses and force on <b>the</b> <b>bead.</b> These results suggest this pump design is feasible, and the kinesin molecules provide sufficient force to deliver pico- to atto- l/s flows...|$|R
5000|$|... #Caption: Ray optics {{explanation}} (focused laser). In {{addition to}} keeping <b>the</b> <b>bead</b> in <b>the</b> {{center of the}} laser, a focused laser also keeps <b>the</b> <b>bead</b> in a fixed axial position: The momentum change of the focused rays causes a force towards the laser focus, both when <b>the</b> <b>bead</b> is in front (left image) or behind (right image) the laser focus. So, bead will stay slightly behind the focus, where this force compensates the scattering force.|$|R
5000|$|Invented in 1984 by David Allen Dayton. A {{bead breaker}} {{is a tool}} used for {{separating}} tires from rims. The inner-most diameter of the tire that interfaces with a wheel is called <b>the</b> Tire <b>Bead.</b> <b>The</b> tire <b>bead</b> is a thicker section of rubber, and is reinforced with braided steel cable, called <b>the</b> <b>Bead</b> Bundle. [...] <b>The</b> inner-most surface of <b>the</b> tire <b>bead</b> creates <b>the</b> air seal between the tire and rim on a radial-ply tire and a bias-ply tire. Often, <b>the</b> <b>bead</b> can become frozen to the rim after rusting or corrosion occurs, requiring {{the use of a}} bead breaker in order to be removed.|$|R
