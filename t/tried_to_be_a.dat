25|$|The Antioch Review, {{founded in}} 1941, {{is one of}} the oldest {{continuously}} publishing literary magazines in America. They publish fiction, essays, and poetry from both emerging as well as established authors. Throughout the history of the magazine questions about race, ethnicity, sex, education, and the American experience have had a large place. Academic questions in their formal sense have not loomed large, and the magazine’s policy of refusing to run footnotes is, in fact, a statement about the non- (rather than anti-) academic nature of the journal. Academics by the score have contributed, but always within a belles-lettres or journalistic tradition. So the magazine was open to both Malcolm Bradbury and Eric Bentley, sans footnotes. The Antioch Review has always avoided narrow academic debates and tried to suggest that although professors may be for the academy, their commentaries can bear on larger social and intellectual processes. The Review has always <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> forum for new writers and ideas in poetry and the short story.|$|E
500|$|Lyrically [...] "I Don't Give A" [...] {{describes}} {{a day in}} the life of Madonna, with the singer working through her schedule. The verses during the chorus are representative of how Madonna had previously ignored her detractors, instead choosing to express it with her music with the lines, [...] "I'm moving fast, Can you follow my track, I'm livin' fast, And I like it like that, I do ten things all at once, And if you have a problem, I don't give a." [...] During the bridge, the lyrics presumably talks about a marriage which did not work out for unknown reasons, [...] "I <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> good girl/ I tried to be your wife/ I diminished myself/ And I swallowed my light." [...] Many critics agreed that the song has pretty direct lyrics that seem to take aim at her ex-husband, film director Guy Ritchie. However, when asked if Ritchie was indeed the subject of the song, Madonna's representative Liz Rosenberg added that [...] " [...] has not explained the lyrics and if they are about someone specifically ... I appreciate that people will speculate." [...] The song ends with Minaj uttering the final line, [...] "There's only one queen and that's Madonna. Bitch!" ...|$|E
500|$|The episode {{received}} largely positive {{reviews from}} critics. Noel Murray of The A.V. Club {{wrote that the}} episode was [...] "a good introduction to the show, establishing the characters and the premise quickly and cleanly, before ending on a cliffhanger". Murray, however, did note that it contained a [...] "dialogue that sounds more faux-clever than actually clever" [...] {{and that there was}} [...] "an overall flatness to the action/horror sequences" [...] that would continue until the second season. John Levesque, writing for the Seattle Post-Intelligencer, called the fledgling series [...] "witty, intelligent and thoroughly entertaining" [...] and dubbed it [...] "the best thing I've seen on The WB". He praised the acting of Sarah Michelle Gellar, noting that she [...] "plays Buffy to perfection". Phil Kloer of The Atlanta Journal and the Atlanta Constitution called the show a [...] "kicky little mix of camp comedy, high school hi-jinks and monsters" [...] and likened its plot to the Fox sci-fi series The X-Files and the Nickelodeon horror-themed anthology series Are You Afraid of the Dark?. He ultimately gave the episode a B. Nikki Stafford, in her book Bite Me!, called the first episode [...] "excellent" [...] and complimented the strengths of the main cast as well as the show's unique approach. She contrasted it with the earlier movie, noting that [...] "the movie version [...] was like Clueless, but near the end suddenly <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> serious film. The television show carries comedy, action, and drama simultaneously and features a far superior ensemble cast." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{starting}} {{title track}} of Crime Cutz derived its title {{from a person}} {{of the same name}} who gave Holy Ghost! a drum break {{to be used in the}} song; it was not included in the final mix, however. It begins with [...] "spacey" [...] synthesizers, before the acoustic drum beat kicks in around a minute into the song. Halfway into the song, diva vocals from the East Coast Inspirational Singers group join in, which Frankel, [...] "literally found them on the internet. We met up the next day, and it was awesome and really moving to hear them sing. In general we've <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> bit more off the cuff when recording recently, [...] a last minute addition while mixing the song." [...] Sequenced synth arpeggios, [...] "super-dry" [...] guitars, and falsetto lead vocals are also present in the arrangement. [...] "Stereotype" [...] is about the band's self-awareness and pride towards them being of a very well-known musical genre, singing in a mournful tone that [...] "I know I'm a stereotype, don't be so critical [...] Let go." [...] In the track's first draft, the drum parts and chord progression were developed first. Holy Ghost! traveled to Los Angeles to work with DJ and production duo Oliver on the song, but with little success in making the type of track Holy Ghost! wanted it to be. It was not until Oliver created a bassline for the duo that Holy Ghost! reworked the arrangement of the song into what would be the final mix that ended up on Crime Cutz.|$|E
2500|$|Martin was nicknamed [...] "Mr. Silvertone" [...] by saxophonist Johnny Hodges. Chu Berry named Martin his {{favorite}} saxophonist. He {{has also been}} idolized by many other saxophonists, including Eddie Miller. Although his playing has been admired by so many jazz musicians, Martin never <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> jazz musician. Martin always led a sweet styled band. Unlike most sweet bands that just played dull music, Martin's band {{turned out to be}} one of the most musical and most melodic of all the typical hotel-room sweet bands. According to George T.

When asked about For Keeps (1988), Ringwald said, [...] "I didn't want to give the wrong message to teenagers. I sort of felt a certain {{responsibility}} – I mean, I was a very, very famous teenager and I thought a lot of teenagers were looking up to me and emulating me, and I really didn't want to make a movie that said in any way that having a baby at that age was going to be easy." [...] She was parodied on the Family Guy episode [...] "Meet the Quagmires" [...] as Peter Griffin's wife in an alternative timeline.|$|E

2500|$|Sinclair {{announced}} in March 2009 that the series' second season would rely less on 90210 alums like Jennie Garth and Shannen Doherty to boost ratings. She felt that [...] "the show <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> {{lot of things}} {{to a lot of people}} in its first season [...] I think the center lies with the generation of kids that are in high school now." [...] It was also announced that Dustin Milligan ('Ethan Ward') would not be coming back for season two, while Matt Lanter would be joining the cast as a series regular. Casting soon began for new characters to be introduced in the second season. In June 2009, the series was reportedly looking for an actor to play the recurring role of Teddy, a tennis champ returning to West Beverly. Actor and model Trevor Donovan was later cast in the role. Ann Gillespie returned in the second season for multiple episodes as Jackie Taylor, Silver and Kelly's mother. Her character was once again sober and hoped to reconnect with her daughters after being diagnosed with cancer.|$|E
2500|$|The hits just {{inspired}} {{confidence in}} us. We became totally involved in getting dressed up {{and going out}} to gigs, the gigs and rehearsals were everything. Nothing worried us, we were so busy consuming what was happening around us. We were super aware, on top of every trend in music and clothes and language. We tried {{to be honest and}} sincere with our music, only playing and recording what we liked. The guys in the good record bars dug what we were doing and they got in all the latest English R records for us. We were listening to Zoot Money, John Mayall, Manfred Mann, The Animals, all that sort of stuff and trying to create that sound. We were different from groups like The Underdogs who just played 12-bar blues all night; we <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> lot more imaginative about what we did ... We had no idea what we were earning on tour, we just spent what we wanted and ploughed the rest back into the band. We had our way with girls, bought more clothes and equipment and just enjoyed being stars.|$|E
2500|$|With the {{departure}} of the Reds' two regular third basemen, Chico Ruiz opened the 1964 season as the Reds' starting third baseman, and Boros was returned to San Diego. However, Boros was quickly called up by the Reds and became the team's regular third baseman by the second week of May 1964. By early July, Boros was batting slightly under [...]300, set a club record with 50 errorless games, and had established himself as [...] "one of the top favorites among Red fans." [...] Boros' streak was seven games short of the National League record of 57 errorless games by third baseman Bob Aspromonte. Boros credited his improvement in fielding to his studying the play of Ron Santo in Chicago during the 1963 season. Boros concluded that Santo was the best third baseman he had ever seen. Previously, Boros had <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> [...] "cool, graceful player of the Gil McDougald type." [...] Based on his observation of Santo, he changed his philosophy and changed into [...] "a scrambling, aggressive type." [...] He later described the 50-game errorless streak as his biggest thrill in baseball.|$|E

2500|$|Meanwhile, Emperor Xuanzong made Yang Guozhong You Xiang (右相) -- {{the head}} of the {{legislative}} bureau of government (中書省, Zhongshu Sheng) and a post considered one for a chancellor; he also made Yang the minister of civil service affairs (文部尚書, Wenbu Shangshu), and further allowed him to keep his command of Jiannan. [...] It was said that Yang was capable in rhetoric but lacked abilities and presence. [...] While he <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> responsible official and was decisive, he was frivolous and insolent to other officials. [...] He personally assumed over 40 posts, and expelled those officials who had good reputations but were not willing to follow his orders. [...] It was further said that he tried to show off his talent by having important matters decided at his home without discussion with other officials, and then simply announce his decisions once he arrived at the government halls. [...] Meanwhile, for his and Chen's contributions in [...] "discovering" [...] Li Linfu's involvement with Li Xianzhong, Emperor Xuanzong created both of them dukes in 753—in Yang's case, the Duke of Wei (魏), although he declined on account that the title was overly honorable for him, and so Emperor Xuanzong made him the Duke of Wei (衛, note different character) -- a slightly lesser title.|$|E
2500|$|The album's {{cover was}} {{unveiled}} on July 8, 2010 {{and met with}} positive reception. 'Idolator' said [...] "Ciara has been tempting us with her sexy new single 'Ride' ... but if you're looking for her goodies keep on looking because their [...] not on her Basic Instinct album cover (unless it's a seductive Playboy-esque fold out). The songstress, whose music video proved to be too hot for BET, kept things simple for the cover art." [...] Ciara then outlined plans for a mixtape to precede the album's release, in preparation she recorded remixes to Soulja Boy Tell 'Em's [...] "Pretty Boy Swag" [...] ("Pretty Girl Swag") and Waka Flocka Flame's [...] "Hard in Da Paint", {{as well as a}} cover of Young Jeezy's [...] "Lose My Mind". When asked by Gerrick D.

I one day look forward to being able to share with my fans (things that happen).' Right now, this is about living in a world of possibility and doing my best, [...]. Getting the record out there, I just want my fans to hear it. This album is really for my fans, and it's good to know the energy and the feedback has been great. It really is just the beginning". In February 2011, following rumors that Ciara had been dropped by Jive Records, Ciara released an official statement to her Facebook page. Amongst her complaints, were a lack of funding and support from the label with regards to promoting Basic Instinct. In addition to disagreeing with the label over single choices, Ciara personally funded the $100,000 video for her third single [...] "Gimmie Dat". [...] "I'm dedicated to my music, performance and to my fans! I've <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> team player with the label only to have compromised what I truly believed..
