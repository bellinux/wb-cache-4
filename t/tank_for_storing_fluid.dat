40|$|Drug {{delivery}} in biomaterials requires {{consideration of the}} pore network to store and deliver greater concentrations {{over an extended period}} of time. The porous structure in wood is used for delivery of water and therefore presents a possible pore architecture <b>for</b> <b>storing</b> <b>fluids.</b> The goal was to determine the pore characteristics of dried and pyrolysed wood and then investigate the ability to uptake water into the porous network. Balsa (Ochroma Pyramidale Urb) and oak (American: Quercus Alba and European: Quercus Robus) were selected based on the large pore size (100 – 200 μm). The microstructure was characterized by scanning electron microscopy and the pore volume determined by mercury intrusion porosimetry. The open and closed porosity was determined by the Archimedes method. Wood was pyrolyzed in a non-oxiding atmosphere between 800 and 1400 oC, the pore structure evaluated and the water uptake determined. Oak provides an open porosity 2. 8 times greater than balsa. Pyrolysis of the wood open the pits, connecting vertically oriented tracheids with the other channel systems in wood (vessels and rays) for greater pore interconnectivity. The uptake of water, as determined by a liquid permeability test shows an initial linear uptake of 60 % of the total water capacity, followed by a slower uptake of the remaining volume. This study shows that American oak has a larger open porosity and that pore connectivity can be improved by pyrolysis at 800 oC. Such a bimodal interconnected pore structure may find use for drug {{delivery in}} biomaterials applications...|$|R

Guzzlers are typically installed in remote mid- to high-elevation basins, where precipitation data are often scarce. In this study, small-game guzzlers were examined for feasibility as potential sites for improving estimates of climatic parameters in remote Nevada catchments. Instruments measuring liquid precipitation and water level were installed at two guzzler field sites. Although one field site was vandalized during the study, field results indicated that water levels in the tank measured by Hobo pressure transducers corresponded well with precipitation events measured by the Texas Electronics tipping-bucket rain gauge, and that measured data were similar to Parameter–Elevation Regressions on Independent Slopes Model (PRISM) estimates. Minimum temperatures from the guzzler sites were similar to PRISM; however, maximum temperatures were a few degrees higher, possibly because temperature sensors were unshielded. With over 1600 guzzlers in Nevada and thousands more throughout the western United States, this study initiates exploration of the feasibility of augmenting individual guzzler sites to enhance climatic monitoring at a relatively low cost to improve the quality and density of climate observations, benefiting hydrologists, climatologists, and wildlife managers...|$|R
40|$|Abstract — Internal fluid {{pressure}} when {{approaches to the}} yield stress of the material used for cylinder, it leads to the infinite thickness of the cylinder.

The system supplies heating and cooling demands to two greenhouses with temperature ranging 308 similar to 323 K and 273 similar to 291 K respectively and utilizes an ice storage tank to subcool the condensed refrigerant, which can enhance the system coefficient of performance (COP). The ice storage <b>tank</b> charges <b>for</b> <b>storing</b> ice, when the cooling load {{is less than the}} nominal cooling capacity. While the cooling load is larger than the nominal cooling capacity, the ice storage <b>tank</b> discharges <b>for</b> subcooling. The results show that in the charge mode the heat pump COP of ice storage system is 12 % higher than that without ice storage tank. Under the discharge mode, the ice storage system provides the refrigerator COP 15 % higher than that without ice storage tank. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd and IIR. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|Solar {{radiation}} {{is the main}} source of thermal energy for almost all the processes developing in the atmosphere, hydrosphere, and biosphere. The total duration of sunshine in Tajikistan ranges from 2100 to 3170 hours per year. Solar collectors can be mounted on the roof of a house after its renovation and modernization. One square meter of surface area in Central Asia accounts for up to 1600 kW/h of solar energy gain, whilst the average gain is 1200 kW/h. Active solar thermal systems are able to collect both low- and high-temperature heat. Active systems require the use of special engineering equipment for the collection, storage, conversion and distribution of heat, while a low-grade system is based on the principle of using a flat solar collector. The collector is connected to the storage <b>tank</b> <b>for</b> <b>storing</b> the heated water, gas, etc. The water temperature is in the range 50 - 60 °C. For summer air conditioning in hot climates, absorption-based solar installations with open evaporating solution are recommended. The UltraSolar PRO system offers an opportunity to make a home independent of traditional electricity. Combining Schneider Electric power generation and innovative energy storage technology results in an independent power supply. Traditional power supply systems can be short-lived since they store energy in lead-acid batteries which have a negligible lifetime. Lead-acid batteries operate in a constant charge-discharge mode, require specific conditions for best performance and can fail suddenly. Sudden failure of lead acid batteries, especially in winter {{in the northern part of}} Tajikistan, completely disables the heating system of a building. Instead, it is recommended to use industrial lithium-ion batteries, which have a significantly longer life and reliability compared to lead-acid type. UltraSolar PRO are ideal and provide a complete package, low noise and compact lithium-ion power supply...|$|R

40|$|Dairy {{farming in}} Ireland generates an {{effluent}} known as dairy soiled water (DSW), {{which consists of}} a relatively dilute mixture of cow faeces, urine, spilt milk and detergents that is typically applied to grassland. However, relatively {{little is known about}} the volumes generated, nutrient content and management factors that influence volume and concentration. Sixty dairy farms that had a separate storage <b>tank</b> <b>for</b> <b>storing</b> DSW were selected for this study. The spatial distribution of the farms reflected the spatial distribution of dairy cows across the 26 counties of the Republic of Ireland, with each farm representing between 10, 000 and 20, 000 dairy cows. Samples were analysed for biochemical oxygen demand (BOD), ammonium N (NH 4 -N), total nitrogen (TN), potassium (K), phosphorus (molybdate-reactive and total) (MRP and TP) and dry matter (DM) content. Management characteristics and parlour properties were quantified. Factors influencing volume and concentration of DSW were determined using mixed model multiple regression analysis. On average, 9784 l (standard error 209 l) of DSW, including rainfall, was produced cow− 1 year− 1 and this contained significant quantities of total N, P and K (587, 80 and 568 mg l− 1, respectively). A typical Irish dairy farm stocked at 1. 9 cows ha− 1 could therefore supply approximately 13, 2 and 12 kg ha− 1 of total N, P and K, respectively, across the farm, annually to meet some of the nutrient requirements for herbage production and potentially replace some of the synthetic fertilizer use. Seventy one percent of samples were within the regulated concentration limits of soiled water for BOD (< 2500 mg l− 1), rising to 87 % during the closed period for slurry spreading (mid October to mid-late January), while 81 % were within the concentration limits for DM (< 1 % DM), rising to 94 % during the closed period. The efficiency of a milking parlour (cows per unit, time taken) plays a key role in determining the volume of DSW generated. This, in turn, also influences the concentration of nutrients and other chemicals. Large variability was found in nutrient concentrations and this presents a challenge for effective nutrient management to maximise the fertilizer replacement value of DSW. peer-reviewe...|$|R
40|$|The Bureau of Mines {{conducted}} a study to develop a standard fire test for 5 -gal containers used <b>for</b> <b>storing</b> combustible <b>fluids</b> in underground coal mines. A standard test method was developed which evaluates {{the performance of the}} container in a 4 -min tray fire. Bureau investigators used the standard test method to evaluate several types of closed 5 -gal plastic and metal cans in outdoor tests. Each can tested contained 1 gal of nonfire-resistant (NFR) hydraulic oil. A container failed the test if it lost its contents in any of seven trials. Contents spilled either as a result of thermal rupture or melting. Fewer than 10 pct of the metal containers failed this criterion, but all the plastic containers failed. The metal container failures were usual-ly due to tipping over during pressure relief, which spilled the NFR oil. Replacing the NFR oil in the container with kerosene resulted in failure of more than 30 pct of the metal containers. The standard tests and preliminary tests showed that plastic containers are not equivalent to metal containers in their ability to contain combustibles such as lubricants and greases in a fire. For solvents and lubricants more volatile than NFR hydraulic oil, approved metal safety containers are recommended...|$|R
