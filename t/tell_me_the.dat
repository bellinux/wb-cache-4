500|$|Robson {{appeared}} on The Today Show on May 16, 2013, {{to discuss the}} allegations. Robson told interviewer Matt Lauer that Jackson was [...] "a pedophile and a child sexual abuser" [...] who [...] "performed sexual acts on me and forced me to perform sexual acts on him" [...] over a seven-year period, beginning in 1990 when Robson {{was seven years old}} when he visited Jackson's Neverland Ranch for the first time. In a 1993 deposition Robson's mother, Joy Robson, said that Jackson had [...] "special friends", boys with whom he spent extra time with that he replaced each year, and that Wade was Jackson's [...] "special friend" [...] in 1990. In August 1993, after the allegations against Jackson were made public, Wade Robson and Jackson's other [...] "special friend", Brett Barnes, held a press conference in which they stated that they had slept in Jackson's bed but nothing sexual had occurred. Robson said in the Today Show interview that his denial of wrongdoing on Jackson's part during the 1993 investigation was a result of Jackson's [...] "complete manipulation and brainwashing" [...] of him. Robson alleged that at the time Jackson [...] "would call me every day and role play and <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> <b>the</b> same sort of things and also tell me then that if anyone ever thought that we did these things, any of these sexual things, that both of us would go to jail {{for the rest of our}} lives." [...] Robson was also a star witness for Jackson's defense at his 2005 trial. He said that his change of story was provoked by becoming a father and experiencing nervous breakdowns in 2011 and 2012.|$|E

2500|$|Niven {{grew tired}} of the peacetime army. Though {{promoted}} to lieutenant on 1 January 1933, he saw no opportunity for further advancement. His ultimate decision to resign came after a lengthy lecture on machine guns, which was interfering with his plans for dinner with a particularly attractive young lady. At {{the end of the}} lecture, the speaker (a major general) asked if there were any questions.

[...] "Just Like You" [...] reached No.47 on the Mainstream Rock Chart.The album's critical reception was lukewarm, with many reviewers praising Davis' voice but noting that the album sounded lightweight and lacking atmospheric punch. Soon afterwards, Davis asked {{to be released from}} her contract with Capitol Records.|$|E
2500|$|During the battle, Langiewicz {{lost control}} over his troops who {{initially}} panicked. It was Rochebrune, who {{with the help of}} his Zouaves, managed to restore discipline and lead a successful attack on Russian positions. [...] He did so by personally grabbing panicked soldiers, throwing them back into the line, pointing his gun at them and cursing in broken Polish ("Psiakehv! Ktoha godzina?" [...] – [...] "Goddammit! Would you <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> <b>the</b> time?" [...] – which according to contemporary sources was the only Polish he knew). As a consequence after the battle, Rochebrune was promoted to the rank of general and considered for the role of the overall leader of the uprising (ultimately rejected for political reasons).|$|E
2500|$|Sartine {{personally}} analyzed {{an enormous}} correspondence and received his subordinates and commissioners of police anytime {{of day and}} night. He {{was the first to}} use repentant thieves and reprieved convicts as informants and agents. To courtiers who found this shocking, he used to say: [...] "Pray <b>tell</b> <b>me</b> <b>the</b> name of honest people who would like to do such a job." [...] Sartine was also a man of action, with great presence of mind. On one occasion, having to quell a riot on the Place Maubert, he met the crowd {{at the head of a}} company of musketeers and had an officer respectfully remove his hat and tell the crowd: [...] "Gentlemen, we come here in the name of the King, but our orders are to shoot at the scoundrels only. I therefore pray the honest people to leave the square." [...] The crowd disbanded without a gunshot.|$|E

2500|$|The Chicago {{metropolitan}} {{area is the}} third-largest media market in North America, after New York City and Los Angeles. Each of the big four U.S. television networks, CBS, ABC, NBC and Fox, directly owns and operates a high-definition television station in Chicago (WBBM 2, WLS 7, WMAQ 5 and WFLD 32, respectively). Former CW affiliate WGN-TV 9, {{which is owned by}} the Tribune Media, is carried with some programming differences, as [...] "WGN America" [...] on cable and satellite TV nationwide and in parts of the Caribbean.

I don't want to trivialise cancer in any way. You have to let the emotion out then sit down and become realistic ... I never asked if my life was in the balance. My parents taught me, my school taught me, sport taught me but in particular cancer taught me that trust is the most powerful emotion we have. I trusted my doctors and nurses implicitly. It was amazing what I learnt about the power of the mind and how important trust is... There were the [...] "how in the hell did I get it?" [...] moments.
