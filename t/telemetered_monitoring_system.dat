The device, called ring sensor, is worn by the patient at all times, hence the health status is monitored 24 hours a day. The ring is equipped with LEDs and photo detectors where the technology of pulse oximetry is implemented for monitoring pulse waves and blood oxygen saturation. The measured data are transmitted to a computer through a digital wireless communication link and the patient health status is analyzed continuously and remotely.

Most of the current health <b>monitoring</b> <b>systems</b> has interfaces like monitor, LCD display and some control switches.

By changing the worn tool before or just at the time it falls, the loss caused by defect product can be reduced greatly and thus product quality and reliability is improved. To achieve this, an on-line tool condition <b>monitoring</b> <b>system</b> using a single-chip microcomputer for detecting tool breakage during cutting process is discussed in this paper. Conventionally, PC-based <b>monitoring</b> <b>systems</b> are used in most research works. The major shortcoming of PC-based <b>monitoring</b> <b>systems</b> is the incurred cost.

40|$|Automated {{production}} <b>systems</b> require reliable <b>monitoring</b> <b>systems.</b> Unfortunately, {{the effort}} of adapting classical <b>monitoring</b> <b>systems</b> to a specific production process is very high and hence only pays off for processes with large batch sizes. The Fraunhofer Institute for Manufacturing Engineering and Automation developed a new approach for <b>monitoring</b> <b>systems</b> that explicitly fit the needs of small batch production processes. This new approach uses active learning methods to model the underlying production process. As a result, this <b>monitoring</b> <b>system</b> requires only a small set of training data for an initial adaption to the process. Subsequently, active learning algorithms refine the system's rediction model if required. This refinement happens while the monitored production process is running.
