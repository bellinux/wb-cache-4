5|$|The AFM {{is one of}} {{the oldest}} Pentecostal {{movement}} is South Africa with roots in the Azusa Street Revival, the Holiness Movement <b>teachings</b> <b>of</b> Andrew Murray and the <b>teachings</b> <b>of</b> John Alexander Dowie. The AFM had an interracial character when it started, but, as in American Pentecostalism, this interracial cooperation was short-lived. The decades from the 1950s to the 1980s were marked by the implementation of apartheid. After 1994, the white AFM moved rapidly towards unification with the black churches. By 1996, all the AFM churches were united in a single multi-racial church.|$|E

Müllenkamp, founder of the city of Leá Monde featured in the story, used to be a priestess of Kiltia, and bore the rood on her back. The followers of St. Iocus are outwardly intolerant of magic, seeing it as an abomination, and yet its higher members continue to use it behind the scenes. This hypocrisy is revealed {{over the course of the}} story, though it goes unresolved.|$|E

His Dvaita Vedanta gained popularity, enabling him to establish eight mathas in Udupi.

5|$|The {{effect of}} these {{religious}} developments on culture, literature, poetry and architecture in South India was profound. Important works of literature and poetry based on the <b>teachings</b> <b>of</b> these philosophers were written during the coming centuries. The Saluva, Tuluva and Aravidu dynasties of Vijayanagar empire were followers of Vaishnavism and a Vaishnava temple with an image of Ramanuja exists in the Vitthalapura area of Vijayanagara. Scholars in the later Kingdom of Mysore wrote Vaishnavite works upholding the <b>teachings</b> <b>of</b> Ramanuja. King Vishnuvardhana built many temples after his conversion from Jainism to Vaishnavism. The later saints of Madhvacharya's order, Jayatirtha, Vyasatirtha, Sripadaraja, Vadiraja Tirtha and devotees (dasa) such as Vijaya Dasa, Gopaladasa and others from the Karnataka region spread his teachings far and wide. His teachings inspired later philosophers like Vallabha in Gujarat and Chaitanya Mahaprabhu in Bengal. Another wave of devotion (bhakti) in the 17th century–18th century found inspiration in his teachings.|$|E
5|$|The {{impact of}} these {{religious}} developments on the culture, literature, and architecture in South India was profound. Important works of metaphysics and poetry based on the <b>teachings</b> <b>of</b> these philosophers were written over the next centuries. Akka Mahadevi, Allama Prabhu, {{and a host of}} Basavanna's followers, including Chenna Basava, Prabhudeva, Siddharama, and Kondaguli Kesiraja wrote hundreds of poems called Vachanas in praise of Lord Shiva. The esteemed scholars in the Hoysala court, Harihara and Raghavanka, were Virashaivas. This tradition continued into the Vijayanagar empire with such well-known scholars as Singiraja, Mallanarya, Lakkana Dandesa and other prolific writers of Virashaiva literature. The Saluva, Tuluva and Aravidu dynasties of the Vijayanagar empire were followers of Vaishnavism and a Vaishnava temple with an image of Ramanujacharya exists today in the Vitthalapura area of Vijayanagara. Scholars in the succeeding Mysore Kingdom wrote Vaishnavite works supporting the <b>teachings</b> <b>of</b> Ramanujacharya.

5|$|There is a {{significant}} Deshashta population {{in the state of}} Karnataka, and here, the sub-classification of Deshastha Brahmins is based on the type of Hindu philosophical system they follow. These are the Deshastha Madhwa Brahmins who follow the <b>teachings</b> <b>of</b> Madhvacharya and the Deshastha Smartha Brahmins who follow the <b>teachings</b> <b>of</b> Adi Shankaracharya. The surnames of these North Kanataka based, Kannada speaking Deshastha Brahmins, can be identical to those of Maharashtrian Deshastha Brahmins, for example, they have last names like Kulkarni, Deshpande and Joshi. Intermarriages are allowed between the Karnatak Brahmans and the Deshasthas and so the classification of the Southern India Brahmans into the Maharashtra, the Andhra (Telugu) and the Karnatic are in this respect, more of a provincial or linguistic character than an ethnographic one.|$|E
5|$|Weber {{abandoned}} {{research into}} Protestantism because his colleague Ernst Troeltsch, a professional theologian, had begun {{work on the}} book The Social <b>Teachings</b> <b>of</b> the Christian Churches and Sects.

5|$|After {{he gained}} Kevala Jnana, Mahavira taught that the {{observance}} of the vows ahimsa (non-violence), satya (truth), asteya (non-stealing), brahmacharya (chastity), and aparigraha (non-attachment) {{is necessary to}} spiritual liberation. He gave the principle of Anekantavada (many-sided reality), Syadvada and Nayavada. The <b>teachings</b> <b>of</b> Mahavira were compiled by Gautama Swami (his chief disciple) and were called Jain Agamas. These texts were transmitted through oral tradition by Jain monks, but {{are believed to have}} been largely lost by about the 1stcentury when they were first written down.
